    "transcript": "so this paper came out um about a month\nago\nso half of adults with adhd have had a\nsubstance use disorder alcohol use\ndisorder is the most common among adults\nage 20 to 39 with adhd followed by\ncannabis use disorder and other drug\ndisorders more than one quarter of those\nwith adhd had major major depression\nso what i want to share with you all\ntoday is um\nsomething that i think is really\nimportant which is understanding why\npeople with adhd are actually prone\nto substance use disorders\nso in order to kind of explore that with\ny'all today here's what we're going to\ndo\nwe're going to explain first of all what\nadhd is a disease of we're going to talk\na little bit about like you know what is\nreally wrong in adhd what is wrong in\nsubstance use disorders we're going to\nsort of explore the overlap between\nthose two things and kind of the\nneuroscientific vulnerabilities of both\nof these disorders\nand once we understand the\nneuroscientific vulnerabilities and\nprocesses we'll start to develop an\nunderstanding of like how we can fix it\nright\nand so this is going to be really tricky\nbecause i'm going to try to send you all\nsome pretty complicated neuroscience\nthat first of all i don't fully\nunderstand because it's so incredibly\ncomplicated\nbut secondly it's going to be very\nsimplified\num and then\nyou know really ask you all to sort of\napply that understanding to like what\nyou can do if you have adhd and a\nsubstance use disorder\nso to begin with\nlet's start talking a little bit about\nyou know what is adhd\nso\nif i had to summarize i'd say that adhd\nis first and foremost a disease of\nexecutive dysfunction and so what does\nexecutive dysfunction mean executive\ndysfunction is\nso our executive function is our brain's\ncapacity to plan and execute tasks\nso for example if i want to like study\nfor a test there are many things that go\ninto studying for a test and one of the\nkey things that i have to do when\nstudying for a test first of all is\nbehavioral inhibition so i sit down to\nstudy uh for a test\nand\nin order to study for the test i have to\nstop myself from like doing other things\nlike pulling out my phone\nyou know logging on to reddit like\nwatching twitch playing video games\nlike\ngoing to get a snack so there's a part\nof my brain that when i focus it in one\ndirection like prevents me from doing\nall the others\nall those other things\ni may have um\nyou know impulses to do those things but\nessentially my brain is like no we're\nnot going to do that now like we'll\ncheck the phone later\nso the first thing that happens in\npeople with adhd is that they're they\nhave deficiencies in their behavioral\ninhibition circuitry that kind of comes\nfrom the frontal lobe okay we'll talk\nabout that in a second the second thing\nis that people with adhd have altered\nsensitivity to reinforcement\nand so what that means is that things\nthat are low hanging fruit and easily\nenjoyable\nare\nfar much more enjoyable to people with\nadhd so if you look at like delayed\ngratification studies and people with\nadhd where you ask someone with adhd hey\ni'll give you a dollar now or i'll give\nyou five dollars in five minutes which\none do you want literally the brain of\nsomeone in adhd is gonna pick the dollar\nnow as opposed to the dollar and five\nfive dollars in five minutes\nso compared to the neurotypical brain\nthe sensitivity to reward and\nreinforcement is altered in adhd\nthe third thing that that happens in\nadhd is a high amount of impulsivity so\npeople may say like is\ndecreased inhibition the same as\nimpulsivity and it turns out that\nneuroscientifically they're actually\nlike discrete mechanisms so people with\nadhd tend to be like a lot more\nimpulsive so when they have like an\nimpulse they're much more likely to act\non it that may correlate with decreased\ninhibition may also correlate with\nreward sensitivity right so if i have an\nimpulse to like eat chocolate and i\nenjoy chocolate more than the\nneurotypical person it'll be hard for me\nto diet in a healthy way okay so when we\nkind of summarize i kind of think about\nexecutive dysfunction and adhd as having\nthree major components the first is\ndeficient behavioral inhibition so it's\nhard for me to inhibit behaviors\nthe second is an altered sensitivity to\nreinforcement so things that are fun for\nother people are actually like way more\nfun for me if i have an adhd brain\nand we'll get to the neuroscience of\nthis because it involves dopamine\nreinforcement circuitries and things\nlike that and the third is a as a\ncertain amount of inhibit i mean\nimpulsivity which is and that\nimpulsivity has a lot to do with\nintolerance to delayed gratification\nokay\nso these are the three things that we're\ngoing to kind of talk about when it\ncomes to what adhd is\nso the next thing that we're going to\nkind of touch on is that\num\nso substance use is actually like\nvery\nthe adhd brain is very vulnerable to\nsubstance use because of these three\nthings so if we think about like\nsubstance use you know it involves\nrestraining our ability to like get high\nfor example\nit could be hard enough on its own right\nbut when i've got an adhd brain that has\nlike\na deficiency in behavioral inhibition\nhas an altered sensation of reward and\nhas like more impulsive kind of\nbehaviors it makes it really easy for me\nto use substances so i think if we kind\nof look at what gets people to use\nsubstances and what protects people from\nusing substances\nthe way that our brains protect us from\nusing substances are kind of handicapped\nin the adhd brain\nso it makes us much more prone to using\nsubstances\nso this is where if we kind of look at\nthe kind the mechanisms of um\n[Music]\nadhd and\nif we look at kind of the mechanisms of\nadhd it'll what we'll kind of see is\nwe'll map these mechanisms onto a few\ndifferent parts of our brain okay\nso what we're going to now do is take a\nquick look at\nthe brain\nand so let's take let's understand the\nneuroscience of this okay\nso we have a couple of different parts\nof our brain\nso the first is going to be the\nprefrontal cortex\nso the prefrontal cortex is responsible\nfor inhibition\nso\nthere's also another part of our brain\ncalled the anterior cingulate cortex\nwhich is kind of back here in the\nanterior cingulate cortex\nor\nresults in poor selective attention\nand poor inhibitory control\nso the frontal lobes are responsible for\ninhibition but the anterior cingulate\ncortexes as well and what we know in\npeople with adhd is that they've got\nlike basically like a reduced activity\nin the anterior cingulate cortex okay\nand the third thing that we're going to\nkind of talk about and this is important\nfor drug use\nis\nimpair dopamine activity across the\nbrain\nso\nthis may sound kind of weird\nbut you guys know that like with adhd we\nactually give people stimulant\nmedication right so this is going to\nsound kind of weird\nbut if you look at the per the brain of\nsomeone with adhd what essentially\nhappens is that like\nthey're getting too many thoughts too\nfast and if you look at that what that\nreally is\nis not it's not that their brain is\nactually moving too quickly it's that\ntheir brain is not able to turn down the\nvolume of some thoughts\nso when you give someone with adhd\nstimulant medication what you're\nactually stimulating\nis the pfc\nso stimulant medication\nincreases the activity of stimul of the\npfc and allows you to actually focus on\none thing so it doesn't actually speed\nup the brain it actually boosts your pfc\nfunction which in turn will allow you to\nnegatively inhibit like other thoughts\nand impulses does that make sense\num\nokay\nso the next thing to understand is that\npeople with adhd have impaired dopamine\nactivity\nand so part of the problem is that we we\nknow that in the pfc in the anterior\ncingulate cortex and we'll get to the\nstriatum in a second\nwe know that we have low dopamine or\nsome kind of dopamine dysfunction in the\nbrain of adhd\nand so if you kind of look at it like\nwhat\ndrug use will actually do is increase\nyour dopamine levels so one of the\nreasons that people with adhd will use\nsubstances is to almost self-medicate so\nthey have a baseline low dopamine\nactivity which results in adhd symptoms\nand when i add drugs\ni'm gonna boost\noh add drugs\nwhen i add drugs it's actually gonna\nincrease my dopamine activity which will\nresult in almost like some amount of\nself medication\nthe problem\nis that this effect is temporary so over\ntime when i use drugs at the very\nbeginning it'll stimulate parts like the\npfc\num it'll and that but it'll also kind of\nhave some effects on kind of the\namygdala\nover here in the hippocampus so like\nyou'll get stimulation here by drugs\nokay\nbut the problem is that over time is you\nuse drugs\nthey stop increasing dopamine over here\nand let me know if this is too much okay\nand\nwhat actually happens is they start to\nlike affect this part of our brain\ncalled the striatum so drug use when i\nuse drugs temporarily it sort of has\neffects let's say over here\nand over here\nbut over time it'll start to activate a\ndifferent part of my brain called the\nstriatum and then what happens once it\nstarts acting in the striatum what it\nactually does is decrease dopamine\nso then when i increase my drug use it\nactually has a paradoxical effect to\ndecrease dopamine and then makes the\nadhd worse\nthis has to do with the way that our\nbrain actually like acclimatizes to drug\ndrug use so um just to kind of recap and\napologies if i'm saying this over and\nover again so in the beginning we have\ndopamine deficiency here and not a good\namount of activity in our pfc if i use\ncertain drugs i can actually boost the\ndopamine over here and it creates a\nself-medicating effect this will sort of\nexplain to you why people with adhd may\nbe vulnerable to substance use because\nit's almost self-medicating in some way\nthen what happens through chronic drug\nuse is that the parts of my brain that\nget affected change and once we get to\nthe striatum what we actually see is a\ndecrease in dopamine activity and then\nadhd worsens and there's some\ninteresting evidence for this\nso if you look at the d2 receptor so i\ndon't know if you guys kind of know this\nbut you know like\num\nso if i have a molecule of dopamine\nthe number of receptors i have will kind\nof increase the signal so if i have like\nthree receptors in one molecule of\ndopamine and this molecule of dopamine\nis kind of floating around\nit has a very high chance of like\nincreasing the dopamine signal i can\nalso increase the dopamine signal by\nincreasing the molecules of dopamine\nright because then i can go over here i\ncan go over here i can go over here\nso what we actually see\nin people who are abstinent i know this\nis going to sound kind of weird\nbut what we see in people who are\nabstinent is a lower number of dopamine\nreceptors and so if you have a lower\nnumber of dopamine receptors shouldn't\nthat mean that you will get\nless dopaminergic activity and the\nanswer paradoxically is no because the\nreason you have a lower number of\nreceptors\nis because you're not bombarding\nyourself with dopamine\nso over time what happens i know this\nsounds kind of weird\nbut over time what happens is we develop\ntolerance\nand so as we develop tolerance it can\nkind of make some weird changes to our\ndopamine receptor circuitry and actually\nlike\nalter our sensitivity to dopamine so\nwhen people actually become abstinent\nit's the reason that their dopamine\nreceptors kind of go down is actually\nresults in them not being bombar or\nsorry i just got confused there um\nbut as as you sort of decrease the\nnumber of dopamine receptors within\nabstinence it sort of signals a\nresetting of your dopamine system\nthe other thing that we sort of\nuh seem to understand is that dopamine\nblockade\nin this part of your black brain if you\nblock dopamine\nit reduces\nadhd symptoms\nand reduces substance use\nsymptoms so this is what's kind of\ninteresting here is that like once we\nmove from this part of our brain to this\npart of our brain\nwe start to like alter our dopamine\nmetabolism in some way that's honestly\nlike pretty complicated and and is hard\nto follow but the end result is that\nonce we're acting from the striatum we\nwe see increased negative increased\nimpacts of dopamine and adhd symptoms\nworsen okay that's kind of the key\ntakeaway\nand i apologize if i confused you all\nthere for a few seconds\nthe key takeaway here though is that if\nwe look at the different regions of our\nour brain\nwhat we can sort of start to see is\nfirst of all\nwhy dopamine increase originally helps\npeople with adhd and as our brain adapts\nand we start to see dopaminergic changes\nover here we'll see an increa a\ndecreased dopamine response and adhd\nactually worsening over time and so this\nis and then what happens with this this\nperson once we have like striatal\nactivity of substance use in substance\nuse or prolonged substance use is that\nnot only they kind of addicted to the\nsubstance but the adhd actually gets\nworse okay\nso\nnext thing\nmed school ptsd\nso next thing to kind of explore is like\nlet's talk a little bit about the\nmechanisms of adhd\nokay\nand um\nlet's talk about some of the mechanisms\nof adhd and understand why people with\nadhd are prone to substance use so we\nreviewed a little bit of the\nneuroscience but the first reason that\npeople do it is to self-medicate\nright and this is essentially what i was\nexplaining earlier which is that people\nare dopamine deficient in adhd\nthis may be part of the reason why\nthey're sensitive to rewards\nand so as we increase dopamine\nthrough substances\nfor some amount of time it may actually\nimprove the adhd\nand this is also why we'll use you know\nstimulants which can be substances of\nabuse\nto treat adhd\nso it kind of makes sense okay so the\nfirst reason is self-medication\nthe second reason is a little bit\npsychological\nokay so this isn't something that we\nreally understand the neuroscience well\nuh very well but this is something i've\nobserved as a clinician\nand we'll talk about this maybe in a\nfuture lecture so adhd is associated\nwith a lot of shame\nokay so this is what happens in people\nwith adhd\nlike you're smart you know you're smart\nyou look around and there are other\npeople\nthat are able to do normal things people\nthat are stupider than you are that are\nable to do normal things and you can't\ndo those things despite your iq you\ncan't do those things despite all of\nyour potential you can't do those things\ndespite being in gifted and talented\nclasses when you were in the third grade\nyou can't seem to focus your mind and\npass a single exam in high school\nso what happens in adhd is people don't\nunderstand that they've got adhd so what\nwhat happens is that they just feel like\nthey're busted in some way and they feel\nlike they suck at life\nthey don't really understand because the\nother problem that we see in adhd is\noftentimes people have high iqs and they\ndevelop compensatory mechanisms\nso what that means is that despite your\nadhd\nyou you basically use like\nsome kind of weird iq compensation\nto\nmake it so that you can function\nsemi-normally but this iq compensation\nit's sort of like i have a flat tire but\ni'm so strong that i can just push the\ncar\nwhich like allows you to go 15 miles an\nhour when everyone else is going like\nsuper slow so you're like doing exerting\na ton of effort to ultimately get\nsomething\nthat's kind of normal despite a very\nheavy handicap and over time these\ncompensatory mechanisms no longer work\nand so you used to be able to do what\nother people could do and despite your\nhigh iq now you suddenly suck at life\nwhich deals which results in a bunch of\nshame and the more shame you have\nthe more you need coping mechanisms\nand then generally speaking because your\nbrain is remember\nsensitive\nto reward\nbecause you've got an adhd brain the\nkinds of coping mechanisms you end up\nwith are maladaptive ones\nso it's hard for you to sit there and\nmeditate if you've got adhd so instead\nwhat you're going to turn to is drugs\nand video games\nand social\nmedia right because you're so ashamed of\nyourself\nso this is kind of the second place\nwhere drug use comes in where generally\nspeaking what i\nwhat drugs do i kind of think about them\nlike clinically\nas an escape\nand so adhd gives people's minds things\nto escape from\nright because in my mind like i'm an\nidiot like i should be able to do it but\ni can't do it so i need to run away from\nthat so i get prone to drugs\nand so the third thing uh which i'm sort\nof separating out even though it's kind\nof you know maybe under self-medication\nis that i do think that there's a neuro\nvulnerability here which is important\nso like i've kind of outlined\nthere are a lot of things about the\nbrains of people with adhd that are a\nlittle bit different their sensitivity\nto reward their inability\nto inhibit impulses\nand so what this kind of results in is\num\nyou know like a vulnerability to\nsubstance use\nso vulnerability to substance use\ndisorders so if we kind of look at like\nyou know why these things correlate\nthere's definitely like this\nself-medication kind of hypothesis\nthere's a psychological component and\nbasically like your brain has substance\nuse if we kind of think about it in\nvideo game terms you know like you've\ngot fire resist and ice resistant\nlightning resist and like substance use\ndisorder or addiction resist for adhd\npeople is like minus 50\nso you're kind of born with this\ninherent trait of like having minus 50\naddiction resist\nand so this is why people with substance\nuse disorders and\npeople with adhd while like half of them\nhave substance use disorders so then the\nnatural question is okay okay dr k what\ndo we do about it\nokay\nso now i think i can just kind of say\nthis to y'all so this is going to be\ntricky so this is going to be one of the\nparts\nof\nwhen we talk on stream where i'm going\nto say\nparticular things and they're going to\nbe hard to implement but i'm still gonna\ngo ahead and do this okay\nso a lot of times here on stream what we\ntry to do is give you guys easily\naccessible solutions that like you can\ndo it in five minutes or ten minutes\nthis is one of the cases where actually\nwhat i really want to do is not give you\nall an easily accessible solution but a\nplan of attack that unfortunately is\nquite difficult\nthe first thing that you've got to do is\nstop separating out substance use from\nadhd and this is really important\nso a lot of people that i work with who\nhave adhd will say oh dr k\ni have\nyou know like i have trouble with\nmotivation right like i'm so adhd like i\nhave trouble in school i have trouble in\nmotivation with motivation how do i get\nmotivated how do i find out what i want\nto do in my life\nand they mentally separate out the fact\nthat they smoke pot every day from like\nthese problems\nthey're like oh no i'm lazy it's not\nlike the pot like i'm lazy it's not the\nalcohol it's not the video games they're\nnot a causative factor\nthey aren't the reason i'm lazy they are\nthe result of my laziness\nright so it's kind of interesting but if\nyou have a motivational problem if you\nhave adhd and you use any kind of\nsubstance\nokay marijuana alcohol stimulants even\nvideo games\nyou have to understand that as long as\nyou're using that substance all of this\ncycle is going to be going on in your\nbrain and you're really not\nhelping your brain to achieve motivation\nso anytime you have a comorbid disorder\nso this gets into the idea of dual\ndiagnosis so when you've got depression\nand alcohol addiction\nyou can't deal with either of them\non their own because if you've got\ndepression and you're depressed\nit's going to make it far easier for you\nto reach for like booze\nand if you drink all the time your brain\nis going to be more prone to depression\nso like you can't separate out these\nproblems anymore so like this is it's\nkind of harsh but like\ni i've heard so many people who will say\noh my problem is motivation laziness or\nadhd or it's this but it's certainly not\nthe pot\nlike\nthat's fine like haven't you read all\nthe research like pot doesn't make you\nstupid or pot doesn't cause this it's\nfine like it's being legalized it's like\nsafe like i like it i enjoy it it's good\nand i hate to break it to you but if\nyou're using any kind of substance and\nyou have problems with adhd those two\nthings are going to be\nthe substance is going to be\ncontributing to the problem like 100\nso first thing you've got to do is stop\nseparating out the substance use from\nall of your other problems your problems\nare not going to get fixed as long as\nyou're using substances\nokay maybe a little bit of a hyperbole\nthere like\nbut\nhonestly it's been my experience as a\nclinician that like you've got to take\nthe substance you seriously\nso what that practically means is you\ngot to get sober so if you really want\nto fix this you have to start by getting\nsober and i know that that's not easy\nand has its own\nown you know challenges but the simple\ntruth is that if you're using substances\nand you've got adhd and you think the\nproblem is adhd you got to get sober\nthe second thing is that you have to\ndeal with the shame of adhd right so\nthis is a psychological thing getting\nsober is more about neuroscience right\nso it's about resetting your dopamine\nand stuff like that but you got to deal\nwith the shame of adhd so this is where\ngetting into therapy is a very good idea\nso oftentimes\nwhen i stream i will talk about how\ncoaching is fantastic and you should\nsign up for coaching for reasons a b and\nc this is one of the cases where i'm\nseriously going to say if you have a\nsubstance use disorder and you have adhd\ndon't sign up to see a healthy gamer\ncoach go see an actual dual diagnosis\nclinician go to someone who can help you\nwith adhd and substance use\nbecause you've got to like do the\ntherapy right you've got to deal with\nthat shame which causes you to reach for\nthe substance of abuse\nthe third thing that you've got to do is\ndo a dopamine detox\nso this is going to be very hard for\nsomeone with adhd because remember that\nyour propensity for boredom is going to\nbe like your tolerance of boredom is\ngoing to be super low\num but the unfortunate thing is that\nyou're kind of handicapped you're stuck\nbecause if you're using the substance\nand you have the paradoxical effect of\ndopamine in the striatum which is that\nover time you're decreasing your\ndopamine usage and remember that low\nlevels of dopamine are correlated with\nadhd which means that your substance use\nis literally making your adhd worse\nso you've gotta not only get sober but\ndo a dopamine detox\nand give your chance and give yourself a\nchance to reset whatever that dopamine\ncircuitry is\nuh so that you can start to like respond\nin kind of healthier ways okay\nand then the fourth thing that you've\ngot to do is\nmeditate so i know we talk a lot about\nmeditation on stream we say it's like\nreally good for all kinds of stuff\nthe the reason i include it here is\nbecause everything that we're all of the\nsolutions to this are basically removing\nbad things right it's like getting sober\ngoing to therapy\ndoing a dopamine detox it's all removal\nof stuff it's all restriction of stuff\nso the one thing that you can really do\nto like add it's something that you can\nactively do it's not getting rid of\nsomething is meditate and there's oh\ngood evidence overwhelming evidence i\nwould say that meditation strengthens\nyour frontal lobes right so that's where\nwe go back to the idea of the prefrontal\ncortex\num it strengthens things like your\nability to control impulsivity it\nstrengthens your capacity to inhibit\nthings\nuh like inhibit impulses\nand then the fifth thing to do is to\nrecognize that your environment\nthat you are prone to particular\nweaknesses based on your environment so\nyou must very carefully control your\nenvironment\nso let's remember what are the three\nvulnerabilities for people with adhd and\nsubstance use\num\ndecrease so you're more impulsive right\nand you can't control your it's\ndifficult to inhibit behaviors\nso if you are in a situation where there\nare going to be\nnotifications and things pulling at your\nattention your attention is going to use\nany excuse it can to not study so if you\ngive it any kind of excuse to not study\nit will get distracted as easily as\npossible so what i say very practically\nfor people is think for a second\nabout all of the things that could\ndistract you from studying so\nnotifications on your phone access to\nreddit\nyou know being able to alt tab\nusing a laptop even right so using a\ncomputer or using your phone for school\nwork because all of those things are\ngoing to make it easy for you to get\ndistracted so if you want to be\neffective what you really have to do is\ncontrol your environment because\nremember that you have like a high level\nof distractibility right\nso you have like your impulsivity\nresistance is also minus 50\nso if you are in an environment where\nyou're being exposed to impulsive\ndistractions\nyou're much more likely to get\ndistracted\nthe other thing to remember is that your\nyour reward sensitivity is also kind of\nmessed up\nso if you\nlook at twitter if you not only are you\nmore prone to open up twitter but you\nare once you open up twitter compared to\nthe neurotypical brain you are much more\nlikely to enjoy twitter than another\nperson which means that for a normal\nperson who gets distracted they may\nspend 15 minutes on twitter and their\nmind will once again restrain itself and\ngo back to the studying but for someone\nwith adhd that 15 minutes is gonna be\ntwo hours\nbecause the dopaminergic response that\nyou get the the sensitivity to reward\nthat you have you're actually far more\nsensitive to reward so all of these\nthings like social media and twitter and\nvideo games are actually going to pull\nyour brain in even more than the\nneurotypical person\nso it's really hard like i'm not saying\nthat any of this stuff is easy but you\nmust control your environment and as as\nlike as\nlike strongly as you can as rigidly as\nyou can as you strict as strictly as you\ncan think about all of the impulsive\nsources of distraction you may have and\nrecognize that if any one of those\nthings happens there's a decent chance\nyou're screwed because if you get\ndistracted and you do something that's\ndopaminergic and rewarding your brain is\nliterally going to love that reward so\nmuch even if you don't personally like\nenjoy it or you think it's fun\nthe ability for your brain to engage in\nthat behavior for two hours is actually\nway higher so you've got to be like far\nfar more careful it's like you're\nwalking a tightrope with your attention\nand any kind of gusts of wind can blow\nyou off course\nokay\nso just to kind of summarize it is\nunfortunate that people with adhd are\nvery prone to substance use disorders\ni'm not surprised at all that half of\npeople with adhd end up having a\nsubstance use disorder as it turns out\nif we look at what adhd is it sort of is\ncomposed of three things as it relates\nto substance use disorders it's more\nthan that for example so we talked about\nemotional dysregulation and things like\nthat\nbut there are three kind of major\nmechanisms that we're thinking about one\nis increased sensitivity reward so the\nbrains of people with adhd are more\nlikely to enjoy enjoyable things okay\nso that's what makes it easy to love\ndrugs right because someone else can get\njust a regular amount of high or a\nregular amount of drunk but boy is it\nsuper awesome when you get high and when\nyou get drunk\nthe second thing is that people with\nadhd are more impulsive so if we look at\ndrug use like impulsivity correlates\nwith an increased amount of drug use\nthere was even one study that i looked\nat that like people with adhd are more\nlikely to engage with in harmful\nhigh-risk drug-associated behaviors like\npeople with adhd are more likely to\ndrive while intoxicated than people\nwithout adhd\nthe third thing with that adhd does is\nprevents you from inhibiting your im\nprevents inhibition so in our brains\nlike i may want to do something but then\nlike i feel like doing something else\nand then my frontal lobes will inhibit\nthat part of my brain\nthat will inhibit that impulse so that i\ncan stay focused on task\nso the combination of being able to\nof dysregulated inhibition\nof impulsivity\nand sensitivity to reward really make it\neasy to fall into drugs\na quick summary of the neuroscience and\nthis is there's this kind of a couple of\nkey takeaways here so the first is that\npeople with adhd have\nsome kind of problem with their dopamine\ncircuitry and that low levels of\ndopamine are\ncorrelated with high adhd symptoms\nwhat that means is that when you use\ndrugs originally it'll actually increase\nyour dopamine and i suspect that a lot\nof the people a lot of the reasons that\npeople with adhd use drugs is because it\nactually offers some element of\nself-medication\nthe problem is that if we look at\nchronic drug use originally drugs\nactivate dopamine levels in the\nprefrontal cortex and other parts like\nour mesolimbic system and via the\nnucleus accumbens this is called the\nmesolimbic pathway i didn't really get\ninto it but over time when we use\nsubstances our brain adapts and it\naffects the levels of dopamine in other\nparts of our brain so we start to see a\nshift from those circuits to the\nstriatum and once you're into the\nstriatum we actually see a drop in\ndopamine with drug use and with that\ndrop of dopamine with drug use we see\nworsening of adhd symptoms\nso people get into it originally out of\nself-medication but then it ends up\nself-sabotaging\nthe second thing the second reason that\npeople with adhd reach for drugs in my\nclinical experience is because of the\nhigh amount of shame and like i suck at\nlife because i have adhd very common and\nunfortunate experience and then there's\nanother set of you know neuro\nvulnerabilities that we've kind of\ntalked about that sort of make you prone\nto\nsubstance use so the end result of this\nis that like you you end up getting like\n50 vulnerability to substance use if you\nhave adhd\nso the question becomes what do we do\nabout it and unfortunately this is where\nthere are a lot of important things to\ndo and none of them are easy and none of\nthem are simple at the top of the list\nis get sober i'm sorry but you can't\nconvince yourself anymore\nthat drugs are like an acceptable thing\nto do if you've got adhd if you have\nadhd that is not well controlled and\nit's negatively impacting your life\nhonestly the first thing to do is to get\nsober\nsecond thing to do is ideally work with\na dual diagnosis clinician\nwho can do therapy to help you work\nthrough shame as well as like do cbt\naround adhd and stuff like that and can\nhelp you like\nget into the process of recovery\nthird thing that you can do is a\ndopamine detox so this is going to be\nreally tough for people with adhd\nbecause dopamine detox the primary\nproblem is essentially boredom we have a\nvideo about dopamine detox that you all\ncan check out\num\nbut dopamine detoxes are going to help\nyou reset your dopamine levels hopefully\nadjust that that d2 receptor level in\nthe striatum and once that reset happens\nhopefully the adhd will get better as\nwell and like that sensitivity to reward\nstuff will sort of get normalized some\nand then the last thing uh the\nuh that was third thing right so fourth\nthing to do is to meditate so meditation\nhas been shown to strengthen the frontal\nlobes improve things like impulsivity\nimprove things like your ability to\ninhibit info inhibit distractions and\nfocus your attention\nand then the fifth thing to do is\ncontrol your environment so this is\ncrucial because you do have impulsivity\nvulnerabilities you do have distraction\nvulnerabilities so if your environment\nis like a normal environment other\npeople may be able to not get that\ndistracted or if they do get distracted\nthey'll spend 15 minutes on reddit\nbefore they go back to studying\nwhereas your sensitivity to reward\nis so like out of whack that if you\nstart on twitter your brain is gonna\nlove it so much that you'll lose two\nhours before you realize it so you must\nmust must be very very strict about your\nenvironment if you were trying to do\nwork\nso i hope that's been helpful for y'all\ni think unfortunately adhd and substance\nuse are two of the most challenging\nconditions\nto try to build a healthy life with\nit's so hard because so much of our\nsociety is like\nhow can i say this so much of our\nsociety preys on the vulnerabilities\nthat the adhd brain has and as\ntechnology is getting more robust as you\nknow these mega companies and video game\ndevelopers are like paying people\nmillions and billions of dollars to\nfigure out how to engage your attention\nand increase user engagement it's just\npreying on the adhd brain even more and\nmore and more so it's really unfortunate\nthat it's honestly like quite an uphill\nbattle\nbut\ni don't know how to simplify it i mean i\nthink our goal here at healthy gamer is\nto help y'all with this stuff\nand helping you all with this stuff\nstarts with like an honest assessment of\nlike where we are right if you want to\novercome cancer\nsticking your head in the sand is not\nhow you do it it involves surveillance\nit involves diagnosis it involves\nprognostication it involves\nunderstanding what's the hill that we\nhave to climb and even if it's a super\nhigh hill we have to really acknowledge\nthat and understand like what we're\ngetting ourselves into because that's\ngoing to be ultimately how we come up\nwith the best sort of plan\nyou"
