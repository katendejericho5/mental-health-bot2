    "transcript": "so\nlet's start with this so anyone with\nadhd get overly angry at certain games\nso i get literal migraines when i lose\nat league if i lose two to three games\nmy day is ruined until i go to sleep i\ndid some research and recently found out\nthat people with adhd have issues with\nemotional regulation wondering if anyone\nelse has had this issue or if it's\nrelated or if it's not adhd related i\nlove the game but the way it makes me\nfeel after losses isn't normal i\nliterally have to avoid my favorite game\nbecause of how angry i get so this is a\nreally cool post not because this person\nunfortunately gets super angry when they\nplay league but because first of all the\nperson recognizes that they have adhd\nand they've done research about it and\nthey've started to discover that oh like\nmaybe my experience of life can be\nunderstood through like science and by\nunderstanding science maybe i can learn\na little bit more about my situation and\nthen like actually it can empower me to\nlike move in the right direction so what\nwe're gonna do today is talk a little\nbit about the relationship between adhd\nand emotional regulation so the first\nthing to understand is that people who\nplay video games and rage in the video\ngame that's completely normal if you've\ngot adhd and it is worse for you than\nfor other people there's plenty of\nevidence that one of the key features of\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nis emotional dysregulation okay so if we\nthink about adhd there are five\nattributes of emotional dysregulation\nthat we kind of look for when we're\nthinking from a clinical perspective\nabout adhd so that's mood lability and\nmood lability means high fluctuations in\nmood so what that sort of means is that\none moment you're feeling this way and\nthe next moment you're feeling a\ndifferent way okay so it's fluctuating\nmood so a lot of people who say oh my\ngod i'm so bipolar i'm happy one minute\nand then i play game of league and then\ni'm so pissed off i'm so bipolar that's\nnot bipolar disorder that's mood\nmobility so rapidly fluctuating moods\nthe second thing is irritability so one\nof the signs of of emotional\ndysregulation especially in adhd is that\npeople are prone to a lot of\nirritability that can also turn into\nanger outbursts and what we call low\nfrustration tolerance so your ability to\ntolerate things that are annoying is\nlike quite low so people like it's easy\nto get under people's skin and this has\nbeen shown to correlate with adhd the\nlast attribute of motivational i mean of\nemotional dysregulation is actually\nmotivation deficits so in people who\nhave adhd we see all five of these we\nsee anger we see irritability we see low\nfrustration tolerance we see rapidly\nfluctuating moods and we actually see\nmotivational deficits as well and we'll\nget to that in a second in adhd\nunfortunately these things do somehow\ncorrelate with the disease and let's try\nto understand that for a second so when\nresearchers look at emotional\ndysregulation within adhd the first\nthing that we that they kind of\nacknowledge is that these things happen\nin people with adhd but they're not\nexclusive to adhd and this is something\nthat i've seen a lot whereas if you like\nif you look at like the normal\npopulation okay so let's just use paint\nfor a second so let's say like here is\nthe normal population in terms of\nemotional regulation and then here's\nlike adhd\nso this is what it'll look like where\nemotion dysregulation is is worse in\npeople with adhd than it is in the\nnormal population but even in the normal\npopulation there's still this overlap\nover here of people who are\nmaybe have adhd maybe normal but they\nhave emotional dysregulation the more\ntroubling thing is that we're seeing\ntrends in society so the rate of adhd\ndiagnosis is increasing even according\nto theories like ayurveda and stuff with\ntechnology addiction or vata is\nincreasing i think what we're beginning\nto see\nis that the overlap between the regular\npopulation and the adhd population is\nshrinking\nso this is what it looks like now where\nthere there's like the amount of overlap\nis increasing so these two curves are\nactually getting closer together this\nhas been my experience so what i'm going\nto talk to you all about today about\nadhd and emotional regulation i'm going\nto cite studies and stuff from adhd\nresearch but it's been my experience and\ni think we sort of see this\nepidemiologically as well that the gap\nbetween healthy people and adhd people\nis shrinking that society as a whole is\nbecoming more emotionally dysregulated\nthat we're becoming our attention span\nseems to be shrinking we're having\nmotivational problems and i think it has\na lot to do with the effect of\ntechnology so let's try to dive in and\nunderstand a little bit about how this\nworks so the first thing that i'm going\nto do is share with you all a couple of\ninteresting tests that we use to study\nadhd so the first is the stop signal\ntest which basically like you take\nsomeone with adhd and then you show them\nlike a picture that'll say like go and\nwhen when the screen flashes with go\nthey're supposed to start some task so\nstart stacking blocks as soon as you see\nthe screen flash go the screen flashes\ngo people with adhd start they start\nstacking blocks and then what it does is\nit tells them to stop so then the\nscreen's flashes stop and when you flash\nstop you're supposed to stop the task so\nif you look at the brain of someone with\nadhd versus the brain of someone who's\nnormal or neurotypical let's say what\nyou find is that both of them are really\ngood at starting right away so as soon\nas you see the the screen flash go they\neveryone starts stacking blocks but then\nwhen the screen flashes stop a\nneurotypical person will stop right away\nwhereas there's a lag time for the\nperson with adhd so what people have\ndiscovered is that someone with adhd has\ndifficulty restraining their impulses so\nyou can start things easily but if you\nhave to stop doing something and shift\nyour attention somewhere else that's\nmuch more difficult in adhd the second\nthing that we're going to talk about for\na second because this is going to relate\nto gaming okay second thing that we're\ngoing to talk about is the delayed\ngratification test so if you look at\npeople with adhd they seem to have\nproblems with executive function and so\nwhat executive function is the\ndefinition of executive function is\nself-directed actions needed to choose\ngoals and to create and act and sustain\nactions towards those goals so basically\nwhat the internet is bad at right like\nthe ability to self-direct create goals\nenact goals and sustain actions towards\ngoals so people have found that their\nexecutive deficits and in researchers\nhave found that their executive deficits\nand adhd right it's attentional problems\nso i'm not able to restrain my attention\ntherefore i can't create goals and act\ntowards them in a sustainable way so the\nway that we measure there's a there's a\ntest here that becomes important as well\nwhich is like if you give someone with\nadhd let's say you say i'll give you a\ndollar now or i'll give you five dollars\nin five minutes for a neurotypical\nperson it's easier for them to choose\nfive dollars in five minutes it's easier\nfor them to choose delayed gratification\nand for the person with adhd it's much\nharder to choose delayed gratification\nso there's something about the way that\ntheir brain kind of assesses choices\nthat makes them default towards like\ninstant gratification and this also gets\nexplored in terms of impulsivity we're\nkind of not going to go into that\nbecause the neuroscience of adhd is like\nawesome and complicated it's so\nfascinating so these are kind of two\ntests that teach us a couple of\nimportant things the first is that\npeople with adhd tend to go impulsively\ntowards like easier things like low\nhanging fruit and secondly like their\nability to restrain those impulses is\nrelatively low so what does all this\nhave to do with emotional dysregulation\nso let's talk about that very quickly\nokay we also know through research that\npeople with adhd have difficulty\nregulating their emotions and there are\na couple of important dimensions to this\nthe first is that it appears that the\nbrains of people with adhd are more\nsensitive to negative emotions so that\nmeans is that if something bad happens\nto two people and you have an adhd brain\nin their neurotypical brain that\nfrustrating thing is more likely to feel\nworse in the brain of adhd and why is\nthat that probably has to do with this\nexecutive dysfunction and this inability\nto like restrain impulses so there's\nsome evidence that the frontal lobes are\npart of what restrains or suppresses our\nexperience of negative emotion so when\nthat pro that part of our brain isn't\nfunctioning what we sort of think of as\nneurotypically anytime an adhd person\ngets exposed to something that pisses\nthem off like losing a game of league of\nlegends their brain amplifies that\nnegative emotion much more than a\nneurotypical brain the second thing\nabout emotional regulation that's a\nlittle bit different for people with\nadhd is that they tend to be more\nunaware of their emotions so this is a\nreally fascinating study that was\npublished in neuropsychology about 20\nyears ago but researchers essentially\ntook neurotypical people and adhd people\nand they assessed their awareness of\nemotion and what they essentially found\nis that for a neurotypical person the\nmore powerfully you feel an emotion the\nmore aware you are that you feel it i\nknow this sounds kind of weird but like\nif i lose a loved one as the intensity\nof my grief increases i'm more likely to\nbe aware that like i'm grieving right so\nthe more powerful the emotion is the\nmore aware i am that i'm feeling it so\nlike if i'm super super sad it's easier\nfor me to detect sadness within myself\nso they found something really\ninteresting which is that in adhd the\nmore powerful the emotion is the more\nthat the adhd brain becomes blinded to\nit okay which is a really interesting\nit's an interesting dichotomy and so\nit's a fascinating paper so this is this\nkind of becomes more important for adhd\nfolks because as you begin to feel more\nintense emotion you kind of become\nblinded to it so like if you're playing\na game of league of legends like even\nthough you're starting to feel angry\nlike you're not going to become aware of\nit the more angry you feel like it sort\nof like suppresses your ability to\nbecome aware of it and so what it does\nis kind of rises to the surface and then\noverflows like a volcano so this is\nreally common in people with adhd who\nplay video games is that their their\nsensitivity to the emotion is greater\ntheir ability to restrain the emotion\nfrom a frontal lobe standpoint and kind\nof like suppress it is weaker and their\nblindness to the emotion actually\nincreases so it's really fascinating but\nit does appear like there are a lot of\nthings about video games that really\nlike interact with the adhd brain in a\nvery specific and unique way so if we\nkind of go back to like delayed\ngratification and and that kind of stuff\nthe stop signal test we can also see why\npeople play league of legends and get\nreally frustrated right so the adhd\nbrain is like looking at my options for\nthe day and like literally my brain is\ngoing to overvalue things that offer\nimmediate gratification i'm more likely\nto be impulsive and not be able to\nrestrain my decisions so i can apply for\na job today which my brain is going to\nlike devalue because of literally the\nway that it does calculations and it's\ngoing to emphasize things like playing\nvideo games because those have very\nimmediate gratifications so that's why i\nstart to play the game as i play the\ngame and i start to get emotional\nremember that my brain is a little bit\nmore prone to emotional dysregulation i\nhave low frustration tolerance that\nprobably has to do with my frontal lobes\nas well and then as i start to get angry\ni start to become blinded to that\nemotion which then lets me perpetuate\nand not restrain and adjust my behavior\ncauses the anger to compot compound kind\nof builds on itself and then it kind of\noverflows and then you wind up with\nheadaches so for this person who's\nsaying is it normal like as have other\npeople experience this like what you're\nexperiencing is completely in line with\nwhat we understand about adhd in video\ngames which is like low frustration\ntolerance blindness to your emotion and\nexperiencing emotion and raging more\nthan a neurotypical brain another\nimportant caveat to remember is that\nremember as is the difference between\nneurotypical and adhd starts to shrink\nwe start to see people who may not have\nadhd start to manifest with some of\nthese behaviors and so you know people\nwill sort of ask okay like what do i do\nabout it and this is interesting because\nthe first thing that you have to do is\nunderstand the emotion that you\nexperience there's a model of emotional\nregulation which basically breaks\nemotional regulation and the value of\nemotional regulation into five steps\nokay so what's the value of emotional\nregulation and like how do i get it the\nfirst step to emotional regulation is\nsituation selection and this is where we\nare our emotions influence\nwhich situations we'll let ourselves go\ninto situation modification which is\nchanging relevant aspects of a situation\nbased on how it could like how i could\nfeel emotionally if i'm gonna be anxious\nby going to a party like i may not go to\nthe party because other people are there\ni may go to a small gathering right so\nmy emotions and my anticipation of how i\nfeel emotionally will select the\nsituation that i go into the second\nthing is situation modification so if i\ndo go to a party and i'm anxious if i'm\naware that i'm going to be anxious i may\nbring a friend with me so it reduces my\nanxiety attentional deployment is the\nthird piece of kind of emotional\nregulation and that's once i'm at the\nparty what am i going to choose to focus\non because if you know this if you have\nsocial anxiety that your mind like is\npaying attention to the 20 people who\nare like who may be thinking things\nabout you and what you're wearing and\nyou can't restrain your attention and\nactually like attend to the conversation\nthat you're having so that actually has\nto do with emotional regulation as well\nbecause our emotions will dictate where\nour attention is deployed another aspect\nof emotional regulation that's really\nimportant is reappraisal so this is\naltering the way that we think about a\nsituation so that our emotions are not\nlike really influencing it so if i'm not\naware of emotions like if i'm filled\nwith shame and i go and i like try to\nget a job and then i get i don't get the\njob what's going to happen is like that\nshame will appraise that situation in a\nparticular way the way that i make\njudgments about that situation are going\nto be due to my emotional appraisal\nright so i'll conclude oh you know i'm a\nterrible person they're gonna have far\nmore qualified candidates whereas like\nthere are a thousand reasons why i may\nnot get a job it may have nothing to do\nwith me but i have to be aware of that\nemotional contribution to my judgments\nand then the fifth thing is response\nmodulation so p people who have a high\ndegree of emotional regulation can\nliterally modulate their emotional\nresponses when i rage in a game of\nleague of legends like how do i regulate\nit how do i modulate that response so i\ndon't get as upset so these are kind of\nthe five components of emotional\nregulation and people with adhd tend to\nbe not great at those and so the\nquestion becomes okay how do i fix this\nhow do i like regulate my emotions and\nit all starts with being able to\nrecognize emotions and so i know it\nsounds kind of unsatisfying but to a lot\nof people what i'll say is like just\nnotice your emotions like you can't\nstart anywhere except for noticing your\nemotions and there's good evidence that\npeople who train themselves in\nunderstanding their emotions will\nimprove in all five of those domains and\nthis is what's kind of interesting is if\nyou're listening to that solution and\nyou're saying like that's not enough i\nneed to modulate my emotions i'm not\nlike understanding emotions feels\ninsufficient that's probably your adhd\nbrain like looking for a short term\nsolution and devaluing like a long-term\nsolution that doesn't appear to\nimmediate gratification right so it's\nkind of interesting because even if you\nsay that's not enough that's not what i\nwant\nwhere is that judgment coming from\n[Music]\nyou"
