    "transcript": "therapy seems useless should i stop\ntrying\nno\ni feel like i'm doing all the right\nthings yet if i continue this trajectory\ni will never make progress in life\nafter watching dr kane healthy gamer for\nsome quite some time now i realize that\nthe root burden and obstacle in my life\nis my crushingly low self-esteem and\ndominating shame i started therapy at\nthe beginning of the year and have only\nimproved in my lexithymia and gained eq\nbut my immense shame and low self-esteem\nseems impenetrable my therapist is\npretty much\nhas tried pretty much everything\ncb style cbt style work for the inner\ncritic emdr hypnotherapy asking me about\nearlier times i felt ashamed about\nmyself talk about times where i felt\ncompetent\ncontempt from my parents but my memory\nis so poor to where i can't even\nremember any specific incident\nonly that something kind of vaguely sort\nof happened because understanding my\norigins doesn't seem to be an avenue but\nbecause of how useless cbt approach type\napproaches feel i genuinely think that\ntherapy has nothing to offer me\num as for why this is an issue i'm\nunable to live the life that i want i\nsigned up for coaching but i am inclined\nto believe that coaching will not help\nme why because i know that my my low\nself-esteem the not good enough and they\nwill hate you to oblivion thoughts in my\nhead are the root of the problem and\nunderlying obstacle\nso now they go into their different\ninterviews and stuff\ni've told my therapist everything and i\nthink even\nhe was not sure how to help me entirely\ni found a new therapist but honestly i\nthink my problems are beyond what\ntherapy can help i don't think coaching\ncan help me either because i know what\nmy problem is and what i need to do to\nreach my goals but it's simply just not\nworking\ntldr\nit's an infinite cycle\ncan't improve overwhelming shame and\ninsecurity\ncan't do job interviews because of shame\ncan't get better job stuck in current\nbrain dead job slipping back into\ndepression because hate job in life\ncan't focus on making better resume feel\neven more stupid reinforcing shame and\ninsecurity can't improve shame and\ninsecurity etc the cycle repeats\nso there's a lot of important\nthings to tease apart in this language\nokay\nso\ntherapy seems useless\ni will never make progress in life\ni feel like i'm doing all the right\nthings\nokay\num\ncan't improve\noverwhelming shame and insecurity\nstarted therapy at the beginning of this\nyear have only improved in my alexa\nthymia and gained eq okay\nso so what we're going to talk about\nright now is how shame literally shapes\nyour thoughts and projections\nokay\nso the first thing to understand about\ntherapy is that\nit doesn't solve everything at once you\nhave to start somewhere okay\nand so if you're someone who has\ncrippling shame and it sounds like this\nperson has had shame for a while\nyou know starting therapy at the\nbeginning of the year and after eight\nmonths not being fixed i don't think is\nlike\nunusual\nso if you've made some progress in\ntherapy after eight months but your\nself-esteem and dominating shame feels\noverwhelming\nthat's actually like pretty good and i'd\nsay keep at it because if you've had\nthis this if this cycle has been\nrepeating\nfor like years\nlike eight months of therapy isn't gonna\nbe enough to fix it right like you said\nit's very impenetrable right now it\ndoesn't seem like it's gonna change\nso\nthe more\nthe harder the shame is to overcome the\nlonger time it's gonna take to overcome\nit\nand the harder it's going to be to see\nthe progress that you're making\nso there's also something that's kind of\ndangerous going on here\nwhich i want to kind of highlight i\ndon't know if this is going to make\nsense\nbut this is almost like more for\nclinicians\nso this reads to me like a desperate\nclinician patient\nscenario so sometimes as a doctor\ni will come i will talk to patients who\nare like desperate they'll come in and\nthey say i have this unsolvable problem\nand then i'll get freaked out and i'm\nlike oh my god this person has an\ninsolvable problem like what am i going\nto do let me try this let me try emdr\nlet me do cbt didn't work okay let's\nwhat's next another medication let's try\nthis medication that medication let's\ntry this thing and this thing in this\nthing\nand then what happens the really tricky\nthing is that the more desperate i\nbecome as a clinician like what happens\nto the client's hope\nit like gets worse and worse and worse\nright because each thing that you try\nand fails\nteaches both of you the lesson\nthat like nothing works\nright it's a very devastating and\ndangerous conclusion to come to and so\nthe more things that you try and the\nmore things that fail\nlike the more hopeless you become which\nimproves the cycle of desperation right\nlike so then i become more desperate as\na provider and now like i'm forced to\ntell the client i've tried everything i\ncould and nothing is working you are\nhopeless i'm sorry i don't know how to\nhelp you i've done everything in my\nplaybook and then you this person goes\nto the next therapist and they say i've\ndone therapy i've done five things and\ni'm a failure i'm too hard to treat so i\ndon't know if this is going to help and\nso they come in and their attitude\nshapes everything so when five different\ntherapies fail i don't think it's a\nproblem with the therapy i think it's\nsomething about the relationship or the\nperson\nso that kind of desperation i know\nsounds kind of weird leads to bad\noutcomes there's this thing called the\nno sibo effect which is the opposite of\nthe placebo effect which we know that\nfor example 70 percent\nof antidepressant medication\nis due to placebo effect so if i reduce\nyour depression by 50\nokay\nabout\n35 to 40 percent of that improvement is\nplacebo\nit's belief the pharmacologic value of\nantidepressant medication is only about\n30 percent\nso the nocebo effect is the opposite it\nmeans that if if a patient goes into a\ntreatment\nnot believing believing that it won't\nwork\nso let's be precise believing that it\nwon't work the likelihood of that\ntreatment to fail skyrockets\nokay\nso it's kind of interesting because this\nperson's cognitive bias could be\nnegatively impacting the therapy\nrelationship and the therapist is i\ndon't really know what's going on but i\nas a clinician have been in that place\nwhere i feel that desperation i become\ndesperate and then as a therapist i walk\ninto the room every single day desperate\nevery time the person shows up in my\noffice i'm feeling desperate i'm not\nshowing it but i'm feeling it on the\ninside and then that's going to shape\nthe way that i interact with that person\ni don't feel hopeful as a therapist and\nthen what chance does a client have if i\nstart to feel hopeless right it's like\ngg game over it's like you're hopeless\ni'm hopeless\nso first thing to do is to just take a\nstep back and slow down\nall right like don't worry about whether\nit's gonna work or not work it's giving\nyou some benefits\nlearn to kind of sit with that shame\ntalk about with your therapist what it's\nlike to have this this unsolvable\nproblem right what does it feel like to\nhave an unsolvable problem\nhow do you manage that like how do you\nget up in the morning like wow life is\ntough dude like that sounds really hard\nright and then over time what's gonna\nhappen is you have all of this shame and\nthis is how i think therapy or what we\ntry to do with coaches because coaches\nthey they help people with shame but\nlike here's here's how coaches help with\nshame okay therapists are maybe actually\na little bit better than this but\nso i want y'all to understand that if\nyou like in this person's brain there's\nlike a cycle of thoughts right and we\ncan see them kind of fighting against\nthem\nso pay attention to this\nright so can't focus\nstuck can't can't can't do you guys\nunderstand that these words are coming\nout of the thoughts in this person's\nbrain\nso what happens and this person goes in\nnow into like held three jobs and then\nlike i feel like my brain is rotting and\ni can no longer do this this is going to\ncontribute to nocebo effect\nokay\nso it's kind of weird but what can you\ndo what i would advise a coach who is\nworking with this client\nis first you have to model as a coach\nhow to tolerate shame so as this person\nis this person like you know goes to\ntherapy and feels really ashamed and\nhopeless\nif the therapist can sit with that\nhopelessness or the coach can sit with\nthat hopelessness and not feel hopeless\nin turn you're going to show the person\nhow to do that right if we think about\nlike self-dialogue how do we change our\nself-dialogue it usually start i mean\nyou can change it on your own but when\nyou work with a coach the way that our\ncoaches like change self-dialogue is by\ngiving you an alternate option\nso when you fail to apply for a job and\nyou tell yourself oh my god it's because\ni'm like so hopeless and i have this\nimpenetrable shame woe is me and your\ncoach is like wow that sucks it sounds\nlike you were really hard on yourself\nand you genuinely have a lot of like\ndifficult challenges that you're dealing\nwith it sounds like you're paralyzed by\nyour shame and like that's part of the\nreason that you feel stuck i know it\nsounds kind of weird but like they're\nsort of giving you a pass right they're\nlike treating you with compassion and\nthen something weird happens in your\nbrain like when people start like\nconsistently treating you with like\ncompassion and they don't kind of beat\nyou up on a regular basis\nyour brain learns how to talk to itself\nand then over time what happens is that\nlike you'll start to chip away at that\nchain right if you continue to work with\na therapist and your therapist is\nsupportive\nand continues to demonstrate hope then\nyou'll start to like model that behavior\nyou'll pick it up almost like slang so\nwe know that human beings learn through\nobservation of like other kinds of\nbehaviors even if you look at like the\nway that people walk right like people\nin different parts of the country or\ndifferent parts of the world will like\nwalk in a different way if the way that\npeople talk the way that they have body\nlanguage in the way that they like you\nknow greet each other like some people\nwill shake hands some people will hug\nlike i remember when i moved to boston\nfirst from texas like i used to be a big\nhandshaker and like like people they're\nlike shaking hands but it's not like a\nbig thing\nand then when i went to india it's like\neven more confusing because they do\nnamaste right so there's no bodily\ncontact\nso all of these things like you have to\nlearn by like sitting with someone or an\nefficient way to learn i should say is\nby sitting with someone and having them\nliterally like model the right response\nand over time as you learn to sit with\nthe shame and tolerate the shame and\nrecognize oh that shame is there and\nit's actually not my fault\nthat\ni'm failing because as long as like that\n that shame is like weighing me down\nhow could i how should i even expect\nmyself to be able to do anything the\nshame is so crippling\ni can't do anything and then something\nfunny happens there because if you start\nto say that then you've forgiven\nyourself then the shame is over here and\nthat's what's causing the shame is\ncausing you to fail it's not i am\nfailing the shame is making me fail and\nthen you externalize it and then your\nvalue becomes separate from the shame\nand then you can start building that\nback up\nokay yeah so when someone says i'm\nashamed and i'm ashamed of that\nabsolutely it's a cycle it's like it's\nelephants all the way down chat\nyou can you can get lost in that cycle\nas much as you want to breaking out of\nthat cycle literally oftentimes the\nfastest way to do it is to sit with\nsomeone so i'd say continue therapy\nright even arguably with with the person\nyou've got you can try someone else by\nall means try someone else\nbut go there and learn to sit with that\nshame have them sit with the shame have\nthem teach you how to sit with the shame\nsit with it because as long as you are\nsitting with it it is outside of you do\nyou all get that like if i'm sitting on\na park bench with someone else like that\nperson isn't me it is outside of me at\nthat point so learning to sit with shame\nis like i'm over here the shame is over\nthere but if it's over there then it's\nno longer a part of me and then all of\nthese things i am a failure is not\ncorrect you can't say that if you're\n sitting sitting with shame\num\nso you can't you can't say that right\nlike\nonce you sit with the shame then i'm\nover here and then the shame is over\nthere\nokay\ndoes that make sense\nso i wouldn't give up on therapy\nand and if i say just have hope you\ncan't just have hope if you don't have\nhope that's okay but if you've signed up\nfor coaching it's your coach's job to be\nhopeful for you and teach you how to be\nhelpful and that's totally fine like\nthat's fair\nyou must everyone i want you to\nunderstand you must do the the shooting\nwith the shame\n with it it's wonderful\nyou"
