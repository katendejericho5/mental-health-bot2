    "transcript": "okay we're ready to go thanks so much\nfor making time to see me uh i'm a big\nadmirer\noh thank you so uh thanks for the kind\nwords anthony um so i understand that\nyour story is uh a little bit different\nfrom some people in our community\nis it okay if i call you anthony\nyeah that would be preferable thank you\nokay so can you tell us a little bit\nabout yourself and um how you got to\nwhere you are\nsure so should i lead with the headline\nuh you know having murdered somebody and\ngot the prison or should i give a little\nbit of backstory to explain who i am\nbefore i before i completely shatter\nthat\num what\nyour choice i i think you've led with\nthe headline at this point i don't know\ni've already shared an app well i mean\nit's on the title of the stream so it's\nnot a surprise i think\nso i'm 41 years old now\num american\nobviously um\ngrew up very poor\num\nin a really abusive home\nno father\nuh\nmom was a drug addict pretty bad when i\nwas young\nshe sold me and my brother one time to\nthe drug dealers\nwell\npawned us i guess would be a better way\nto say it\nuh and then my grandma ended up having\nto come and pay her debt to get us to\nbond us out of the drug dealers i only\nheard that story later excuse me\nthankfully i have no memory of that so\nthat that's just to give you a little\nbit of context i never knew that version\nof my mom thankfully\num\nwhen i was two or three years old i got\nran over\nuh my mom ran me over with a with a\nchevy blazer which is a one ton truck i\nthink\num on accident\num\ni remember remembering parts of it but i\nhave no memory of it um\ni know she was in a rage with her\nboyfriend\nand uh was going to leave\nin in the truck\nand i evidently tried to stop her and\nshe didn't notice and she ran me over\nso then i spent the next hmm\nthis is pretty emotional just bear with\nme this is a hard [ __ ] to talk about\ni've never talked to anybody about this\nactually\num\ni spent the next several years in\nhospitals and wheelchairs and\ncrutches\ntrying to walk\nand uh\nnever playing never getting to play or\nanything because\nyou know\nblack cast on both legs\nso it was tough\nand uh\nthankfully i can walk that's something\nyou know\nand uh to this day\nactually finally as i get older the pain\ngets worse\njust every day it gets worse in my legs\num the gift that keeps on giving you\nknow\nso anyways\nthat was my childhood\nand uh\nso then i finally got it i finally got\nthrough that\nand uh\nstarted going to school and everything\nnever made any friends everybody hated\nme\nuh never could figure out why\nlike\nwe moved a lot a lot\nand i was the common denominator in\nevery scenario where i had no friends\nuh\ni was always bullied and picked on\nand i'm big i was big as a kid i was the\nbiggest in my class so you would think\nwell how do you get bullied\nit\ni wonder it's because i was a [ __ ] and\ni don't think it is i don't think that's\nwhat it was i think i just wanted to be\nliked\nand\ni'm very cerebral\ni'm not usually this emotional i'm very\ncerebral and so\nwhen people would come and attack me it\nwas like\ni wasn't getting mad i was just like why\nlike i don't get it yeah i mean i wanted\nto know why i wanted to talk about it\nand understand the situation and i never\ncould\nand so probably an easy prey type of\nthing you know\nand plus i was big so it looks good\nyou're you're bullying the big guy you\nknow and so that\nthat that i never had any friends really\nor i would always have like maybe one\noutcast fellow outcast it was a friend\num\nand that never lasted long i don't know\nwhy i drive all my friends away and\nagain i know i'm the common denominator\nin all of these things so i would like\nto know\nwhat that is and i know you wouldn't\nhave that insight in a two-hour\ninterview but\num\nthat's something i've been trying to\nfigure out like go ahead please i was\ngoing to say i may not have that insight\nbut you may have that insight\ni may and that's what i'm hoping you're\nvery good at leading questions you're\nvery very good at that that's your\nstrength and i've never seen a therapist\nbefore or anything like that but if\nthey're all like you and that's the\nmethod they use i mean that's phenomenal\nyou know you help the person find the\nanswer within and i think that's\ncritical you don't preach to them from\nwithout and i think that that's really\nimportant so first of all anthony thank\nyou so much for sharing i mean it sounds\nlike\num\nthat's a lot bro\nyeah i was kind of a dump right there um\nno i mean i i wasn't so much thinking\nabout the dump just as you know it's one\nthing to dump that but to have all of\nthat to dump\nyou know that that's sort of more of\nwhat i mean it's like wow like can you\ncatch a break in any dimension\ni feel i feel that much of the time to\nbe honest with you um\ni'm constantly\nand i see a lot of your your people talk\nabout this that it resonates with me i'm\nalways waiting for the other shoe to\ndrop\nwhen something good's happening all\nright now what now what's the you know\nwhere's the lightning it's got to be\ncoming it's got to be coming if you know\nif my past history is any is anything to\ngo by you know the bad the bad is coming\nright away\nokay\num\nanyway i i sort of jumped in for a\nsecond but i think you were sharing a\nlittle bit about so it seems like you\nwere getting bullied a lot had trouble\nmaking friends you kind of called\nyourself the common denominator because\nyou're moving around and this keeps\nhappening\nright new set of people new set of kids\nsame patterns\nyes exactly and so those are my school\nyears um\njust to give a little insight into\nmyself um\ni coasted through school with a's and\nb's and when i say coasted i mean\nbasically did no work\nuh i would show up\nlisten to the lectures take the take the\ntest and that's it like i i absorb\nthings quite easily except mathematics i\nstruggle with that greatly but otherwise\ni\nit in and i've got it right one time and\nso that's that's a blessing i have that\ngoing for me and i'm really appreciative\nof that\num so i really never had to put in\neffort at school and that's a trend that\ncontinues to this day i'm a full-time\nstudent in college and while i would\nreally like to be applying myself\ni don't\ni i wait till the very last minute\ni breeze through it and then i get\nstraight a's so there's like no\nincentive\nto break that pattern and that's kind of\na drag because\nat some point that's gonna blow up in my\nface i'm just waiting on that to happen\nand i\ni would like to find the there's the\nother shoe\nyeah exactly\nexactly good call exactly yeah um so\nthose are my school years we were pretty\npoor like i said\nmade me start working a full-time job\nwhen i was\ni think 12 i had to lie about my age to\nget a job so i had to work full-time and\ngo to school\nand i had to pay rent and to my mom and\nbuy my own clothes and all that kind of\nstuff\num\nshe had sent my brother away she gave my\nbrother to state when a couple years\nprior to that so i was the only\nremaining kid\num\nto kick me out of the house\nwell\nshe had me put in jail she looked she\nlied about me and had me put in jail\nwhen i was\n14 i believe\n15\nyeah i was 15.\num\nshe was very volatile person and by that\ntime i was big enough she couldn't beat\nme anymore\nuh\njust to give you an instance so it\nwasn't it wasn't just beatings my mom\nwas very physically abusive um i was 10\n11.\nyou first start to get your adult teeth\nand i didn't wear a shirt she picked out\nfrom me one day\nand she took my head\nand she slammed it into the side of the\nbathtub repeatedly and she broke that\ntooth which is still broken to this day\nand she knocked out that tooth\nand she broke that tooth\nand then mom told me\nyou better not tell anybody you better\ntell them you fell off the monkey bars\nor something\nbecause if you don't i'm going to kill\nyou\nand nobody's going to care i'm allowed\nto i'm your mom\ni'm 10 i'm however old i was and so\nabsolutely i believe that that's gospel\ntruth i said and even if they do and\neven and she didn't say it in this tone\ni'm trying to try to make light of it\nbecause it's very painful for me and\nthat's how i defuse tension\num\nshe said\nand even if they did care\nall they would do is put you in a foster\nhome and you'd get molested so you know\ntake your choice\nand so of course i never said anything\nto her she didn't have to say that by\nthe way that was my mom i loved her to\ndeath i wasn't going to tell on her i\nmean i didn't think i was being abused\nit was only later i came to that\nrealization\ni thought\nshe was being a mom\nso\nvery volatile but eventually i got big\nenough to where she couldn't manhandle\nme like that\nand uh\ni remember\nso keep in mind at this time\ni'm going to school to high school\nfull-time\nof course since high school\num and i'm working full-time\nand so i'm getting like five hours of\nsleep a night\num\ni don't mind it you know that's life you\ngot to learn how to work eventually yeah\ni mean so it is what it is um what i did\nmind\nis that every day she would come home\nfrom work and it's this co-worker was\nsuch a piece [ __ ] this co-worker had\ndone that she got in a fight with this\nco-worker for that reason uh you know\nshe's dead now you know bless her soul\nshe dead but\nshe was never happy unless she was in\nconflict i don't know if you've ever\nknown anybody like that but that's\nunless there was some kind of conflict\nshe wasn't happy\nand so uh\ni [ __ ] up this day she came home and\nshe you know this co-worker blah blah\nblah and\nyou know i'm working too i'm going to\nschool i'm i'm having hell at school no\nyou know it's bullying only gets worse\nas you get older believe it or not in\nschool um more violent\nand now i wasn't the biggest so you know\nand uh\ni never said [ __ ] i just went about my\nlife i didn't cry about it i complained\nto her about it i just did my business\nbut every day i got to listen to her\nnegativity\nand uh\nso she tells me she tells me all this\nand i [ __ ] up\ni said wow you just sound like you have\na hard time getting along with anybody\nat work\noh man she freaked out\nshe pulled a knife out on me she she\njust she just went [ __ ] ape [ __ ] so\nnothing really came of that\nexcept that she went to her room i went\nto bed we went to our corners we went\nback to our corners\nand the next morning i woke up and i was\nbeing arrested by the police\nand she told him i pulled a knife on her\nand threatened her life and\nthis and that and the other thing\nactually that was it that was what she\ntold him was that i pulled a knife on\nher and threatened her life and she's my\nmom so they took my they took her word\nfor it no questions asked\nand an interesting fact when you're a\njuvenile the only person who can get you\nout of juvenile hole is your legal\nguardian which in my case was my mom who\nhad put me in there so she had me\nhostage\nin there and i had to agree to whatever\nshe wanted me to agree to to get out\nand uh\ni dreamed of going to college that was\nmy escape that was my lifelong dream was\nthat uh\nthat i was gonna go to college but no\nmoney none\nno money so\nscholarship was what i was hoping for\nbut now i had a criminal record\nand so\ni went that dream\ni thought i didn't know i thought\nand so i dropped out of school after\nthat\ncause what's the point\nthere's no end game anymore you know\nuh\nand my mom kicked me out of the house\ni guess i dropped out because she kicked\nme out of the house\nuh\nand so i went to live with my uncle\nand he he was that he actually turned\nout to be a violent drunk\nand so then i went to live home i went\nto go live on the streets\nand i i wandered around the country i\nhitchhiked across the country for a\nwhile\nbest time of my life\nin a way\nthat freedom\nyou know what i mean\ntuckers are amazing people\ngo ahead i was just saying when you said\nyou know what i mean i was about to say\nno no i don't can you help me understand\nmaybe yeah yeah\nit's well number one i'm not living\nunder constant fear anymore of my mom my\nuncle whoever you know\nbut believe it or not living on a\nhighway is it was less\nemotionally traumatizing\nso\num\nunless you i i never had a bad\nexperience and i'm a big guy and i was a\nbig guy at that point i'm over six feet\ntall and i'm big you know i'm a big guy\nso\nit would not be the same i think for a\nwoman hitchhiking across the country but\nfor a man i i've never had a negative\nexperience\nyou know truck drivers would give me a\nride\nthey would shoot the ship with me they\nwould give me a little cash to help me\non my way and i just met really good\npeople i just met a lot of really good\npeople across the country\nand uh\nso\nto cut to the chase\ni ended up at one point oh so my brother\nwas 18 by this point he had been\nreleased by the state\nhe'd been let she had given him away to\nthe state he was now living on his own\nso i went to go stay with him\nmy brother always hated me i think\ni think he always hated me\nhe was he\ni i can't even give you i don't even\nwant to go into that too deeply because\nit it doesn't really matter he hated me\nbut i looked up to him he was the only\nmale in the house even though he was\nonly a couple of older years older than\ni\nhe was like a father figure i suppose in\nmy mind\nbut he always hated me and rejected me\nand and uh never want to be around i was\nthe annoying little brother you know i\nwas a tag along little brother who had\nzero social skills of\nand make friends\nuh\nas you know when other people are\nlearning those social i've i've only\nread this in recent months when i've\nbeen wondering what the [ __ ] up with\nme\num\ni didn't get that socialization at the\ncrucial years\nyou know and so uh you know there's no\nmaking up for lost time i think with\nthat so that's something i've gone\nthrough my whole life\ncomplete lack of social skills\num\nand uh\nso i went to stay with my brother\ntemporarily\nhe said i could i could stay with him\nfor a couple of months\nand uh so i wouldn't stay with him\nand i thought well that'd be cool\nand it was it was in a way but\nhe lived in a place\nhe lived excuse me\nhe lived in a place you can't even call\nwhere he lived in town it was it was\nnothing it was in nowheresville there\nwas no jobs there was no businesses\nthere was no nothing there was there was\nit was nothing\num he just happened to live there and so\nthere was nothing for me to do he was at\nwork all day there was nowhere for me to\nget a job there was nothing for me to do\nso i was just there bored and then he\nwould go hang out with his friends and i\nhe didn't want me coming along\nand so\ni guess i felt rejected by that all\nright i definitely felt rejected by that\nbut i only realized that now i didn't\nrealize that at the time\num\nfunny how hindsight is so useful but\nforesight would be even better\num\nso\nhe had a good friend so\nthey were like\nthey were in a gang\nright\nbut the thing is this town like they had\ntwo rival gangs but\nthere's no town there's nothing to fight\nover so i don't understand right to this\nday i still don't so they were in this\ngame\nand um\none night\nthey uh\nmy brother was out with his friends\nand then the friends came back and my\nbrother wasn't there\nand so i asked my brother's friend i\nsaid well where's my brother\nand he said um\noh well we got jumped by by these rival\ngang members and they pulled a gun\nand so i ran away and your brother's\nstill there\nand so i said what the what what so\nwe went and got a guy i went got my gun\nand we were gonna go get my brother and\ntry to rescue him and then he just\nhappened to pull up at that time well\nthat that that is why i tell people i\nkilled that guy okay that scenario the\nfact that he let my brother\nhave a gun pulled on him and abandoned\nthem\nand that's true that is that is\npartially true\nthat is publicly true and that that is\ntrue within me as well but that's not\nthe whole story i don't think\ni think a lot of it was jealousy the\nrelationship he had with my brother that\ni didn't right\nthe fact that my brother liked him more\nthan me and clearly obviously no no\nbones about it right\nand um\nso i think it was that sort of jealousy\nthat caused me to do that and i've only\ncome to that realization later\nthat\nperhaps if it were not for that\nthat's if it were not for that\njealousy i would not have let that be a\nreason to shoot him\nso i just want to make a couple things\nclear anthony so first of all um\nyou know are i want to make sure\ni don't know how we're going to make\nsure of this but um i understand that\nyou spent some time in prison but like\nis there anything that you could be\nsaying right now that could get you in\ntrouble\nno i've been convicted of it i was\nguilty i've already done my prison\nsentence okay so i i just want to make\nbecause i'm not a lawyer it doesn't\nsound like you're a lawyer\num i i you know the last thing that i\nwould want is anything negative to\nhappen to you by no no this is okay this\nwas a case that long long since been\nadjudicated i've i've fulfilled my\nsentence for it uh it's it's so so it\nsounds like the dude that abandoned your\nbrother you ended up killing\nyes i shot him\nlike at that time or like later\nlater on later on so that that that\nwhole night\nso when my brother showed up\nthe guy was like oh you're one of us now\nyou proved your loyalty you're you're\npart of the gang now by getting jumped i\nguess i don't know my brother was all\nbeat up\nso they shaved his head\nuh i guess this was a sereno ritual or\nwhatever i don't i don't know anything\nabout it i i'm speaking it out of\nignorance so i just don't know\num\nand so there was a big party that night\nand um\neverybody left slowly but surely\neverybody trickled out\nand santiago is my victim's name\ni want to call him by name because he\ndeserves that respect what i did was\n[ __ ] up\nand santiago was the last was still\nthere in fact they stayed overnight\nnow santiago was 24\nand his girlfriend was 14\nand uh yeah that was kind of creepy you\nknow but they were there that night\nand he was sleeping on the couch and she\nwas sleeping on the floor and my brother\nwas in bed\nand they went to sleep\nand so then i went to my room and i went\nto sleep well the next morning my\nbrother went to work this was six a.m\nroughly um and so i was up\nand they were still asleep\nand so\ni woke the guy up\nand i said hey\nso what's up\nso you know you're a real [ __ ] right he\nsaid what's that\ni said you're a real [ __ ]\nhe said why is that i said you almost\ngot my brother killed\nand he had this little\n18 inch\naluminum crowbar\nand he picked it up and he said what do\nyou want to have a problem or what\nand he didn't know i had a pistol right\nthere in my lap\nand so i said yes i do and i shot him in\nthe face\nand he died later at the hospital\nand his girlfriend woke up\nand said what what what's happening\nto nothing i don't know what do you mean\nand uh\nanyways that's i'm not gonna get into\nthe nitty-gritty of it because that's\njust gossip and there's no point that's\nwhat came of it\nuh the police came\ni got arrested\ni got second degree murder i did i was\n16 years old\ngot charges i got charges in adult\ni got 20 years in adult prison\nuh the maximum possible sentence\ni was terrified going into prison\nbecause you know\npeople know what prisons like\nenjoy they think they do i i guess i\nwould say\nand you know school bullying's bad but\nprison prison there's nowhere to go\nthere's no home to go to you're there\nand i knew that i knew that um\nif you get victimized once it'll never\nstop in there it will never stop\nand so\ntruthfully at 16 and 20 felt like a life\nsentence\ni see people saying like 20 years is not\nthat bad and things like that but\ntrust me it's in prison it's not 20\nyears it's it's 20 lifetimes\num\nso\ni got 20 years but it felt like a life\nsentence to me so all my give a [ __ ]\nwere gone and i didn't want to be a\nvictim\ni knew that much going in i didn't want\nto be a victim if nothing else i knew\nthat\nand so\ni kind of just went crazy in there like\ni didn't care if somebody talk if\nsomebody talked\nslick it was going down that was the\nbell immediately you know i mean and i\nstabbed people and i got new time i got\nnew prison sentences in there i got\nincreased sentences in there for\nstabbing people and\nlong story short\num\nprison is about what you expect maybe\nit's real boring i don't really have too\nmuch too much to go into about that i\ndon't feel like it gave me anything\npositive\nat all\ni feel like it was only a negative\nexperience\ni deserved i had coming i deserved it i\nhave zero regrets about going to prison\ni deserved every bit of it so so i'm not\nhere feeling sorry for myself about that\neverything else yeah that no i i deserve\nthat 100 percent longer i feel but\nthere's a lot of self-loathing i feel\nabout that\nand uh\nwhat do you mean by about killing that\nkilling santiago\nand so\ni've been out\nare you able to hear me okay because\nyour screen just cut out yeah sorry i'm\nswitching servers again it kind of\nlagged out for a second i can hear you\nand so\nand so uh i've been out\nfive or six years\ni had to start from square zero\nall my family cut me off when i went to\nprison\num so i have no fam i had i still have\nno family\nmy mom tried to make\nmy mom tried to make um\ntry to make a connection when i got out\nonly when i got out but i went to prison\nwhen i went when i got arrested she told\nme she hoped i got the death penalty\num\ni was a monster\nit's like well\nthank you creator dr frankenstein i\nappreciate that assessment\num\nso\nwe didn't talk for 20 years\nand i got out and she wanted to\nreconnect\nand um\ni tried\ni couldn't forgive her i just couldn't\nforgive her\nand\nshe later died she had drank herself to\ndeath over the years\num\nand\ni did tell her though i remembered the\ngood things she did for us you know not\njust the bad but the good\nthe only thing i ever wanted her to\nacknowledge was it\nshe was young\nshe didn't know how to parent and she\ndid a shitty job\noh we were bad kids that's all there was\nto it we were bad kids\nnobody ever had bad kids\nlike what she did nobody\nyou're the worst thing that ever\nhappened how do you feel about not being\nable to forgive her\nall i wanted was an acknowledgement\ni guess i've forgiven her i guess i've\nforgiven her internally but not a\nhundred percent i don't think\nbecause without that acknowledgement\n[ __ ] that she [ __ ] up\ni just can't get past there or yeah i\nguess i can forgive i just can't get\nover it\nand uh\ngo ahead i see your i see you're poised\non the verge of yeah\nlooks like you know my tells well\nanthony yeah cause i i was just gonna\nkind of ask like you say you can't\nforgive her but like\nyou know\nwhose fault is that\nfine yeah i mean i can only i can only\ncontrol my emotions myself\ni mean so that that's where i know it's\nkind of weird but like\ni'm not so sure right so i i would say\nand i i mean anthony i'd sorry if i'm\ninterrupting and if you want to keep\ngoing go for it but no no just to kind\nof jump in for a second so i think like\nsomething weird has happened with\nforgiveness\nwhere we've placed the burden of\nresponsibility\non like the person who does the\nforgiving the victim the victim right\nright which is sort of weird like i\nthink it's just interesting because i i\nthink that forgiveness is like yours to\ngive or not to give and it's entirely\nyour choice\nyou know just forgiveness earned\ni think so\nit's kind of isn't that what they say\nthat you have to earn somebody's\nforgiveness and so yeah i guess i get\nwhere you're i picked up what you're\nputting down there yeah\nright so so it's in in this i'm noticing\nthat there's like themes which you know\nyou're sharing a lot with me like i said\ni don't know that i can figure things\nout in two hours but you may be able to\nand and just kind of noticing that like\nyou know what's the common denominator\nwho's to blame\nyou know this idea that if i want to be\na good person like i should forgive\nright because we sort of associate that\nwe say like good people are the ones\nthat are forgiven if i don't forgive\nwhat that also means is that like then\ni'm a bad person and i haven't been\nyou know good enough my heart is not big\nenough to where i can forgive my mom\nwho's never acknowledged any of the crap\nthat she's done to you\nand and there's a part of me that says\nlike that's fine\nright you don't you don't have to\nactually forgive her like you don't need\nto forgive and you don't need to forget\ni think making peace with it\nis one thing but i think that you can\nmake peace with it without forgiving you\ncan say that i will never forgive this\nperson for what they did\nyou know that can never be repaired\nand i got the short end of the stick in\nthat relationship and i will\nbe disappointed and hate them as well as\nlove them and that can be like a\nconfusing piece to come to\nbut i don't think you need to forgive\nher\nyou know especially if she never asked\nfor it\nright\nwell because she didn't feel like she\nneeded forget there was she had done\nnothing wrong in her eyes yeah in fact\nshe she and i want to emphasize here the\nthings i described my mom did to me i\nwas the favorite\nmy brother was the\nshe made it very obvious that he was the\nleast favorite he got it so much worse\nthan i did\nand he kind of lucked out\nand that she turned him over to the\nstate because he ended up at this boys\nranch that he loved and just so he kind\nof lucked out in a way but also with a\nhorrible mom right yeah and so when i\nconfronted her years later after prison\ni said well why did you do these things\nto me i was imagining things she said\nand i said oh am i imagining broken\nam i imagining those broken teeth\ni said you not you slammed my face\nagainst the bathtub\nand you knocked my oh and she broke my i\nforgot to mention that my jaw got broken\nin that as well so i had to have my jaw\nwired shut after that as well\nand i said so until you broke my jaw and\nknocked out three of my teeth am i\nimagining that she said i caught you\nsmoking\nso it wasn't that she didn't remember\nwhat she had at first alleged it was\nthat she thought she had caught me\nsmoking which i guess if that's good\nenough to abuse your child but that\nwasn't even the cause it was this shirt\nso\nto get over that is very difficult\nbecause\nlike without the acknowledgement or the\nasking of the forgiveness or even the\nrealizing that she needs forgiveness\nit's very difficult for me to overcome\nthat\nso i've been out now six years\nstarting from square zero like i said i\ni i started out with call center jobs\nand i i've just been pulling myself up\nby the bootstraps as they say um\nthat's rough yeah that's been rough\nbecause the felony is also a gift that\nkeeps on giving\na little known fast you can't rent you\ncan't rent a place with a felony on your\nrecord\nuh\nyou can't really get most jobs but yet\nyou also were supposed to work and and\nlive somewhere and live lawfully so i\ndon't understand how that conundrum\nworks for a lot of people but thankfully\nthrough sheer dumb luck i guess i've\nmanaged to scrape by so far and keep a\nroof over my head and a job\nand\nthen the coronavirus thing happened\nand uh\ni've been out of work\nfor quite a while now\nyear and a half\nand uh i think idleness has been causing\ni know it has i i've i went through i'm\ngonna assume it was a depression\nthis last year months long like verge of\nsuicide\nand i'm not exaggerating i mean\ntrying to figure out a reason to live\ntrying to figure out a reason to go to\ntomorrow\nand coming up empty\ntoo cowardly to kill myself\nand um\ni had never experienced believe it or\nnot 20 years in prison never experienced\ndepression never experienced anything\nlike that\num\nit was crippling it was horrible\ni think it was the idleness\nand uh\nso\ni've just been coasting along trying to\nfigure out what what the [ __ ] am i\nsupposed what am i supposed to do i'm\nsorry i don't know if you i i'm gonna\ntry to stop cussing because i don't know\nwhat how your format is on that um\nbut\ni gotta figure out what i'm gonna do\nwith myself and you know and i don't\nknow\nnothing nothing is appealing nothing is\nappealing um i don't leave my house i'm\npretty much a shut-in at this point\nso eventually i just said you know what\nyou gotta land on something\nand so i'm going to college full-time\nfor computer programming\nbecause like i said i'm pretty\nintelligent i can pick things up pretty\neasily and that looks like something\nwhere even with a felony\nyou can at least make a reasonable\nliving\num\nand so yeah that's what i'm doing and\nit's it's going fine it's all right um i\ni'm 4.0 gpa i'm in my sophomore year\ni've been 4.0 every semester but\nagain i don't i don't apply myself i'm\nunable to apply myself to this it's like\ni can do the bare minimum to coast wow\nokay if i got anything less than an a i\nwould actually apply myself i have to be\nhonest i'm pretty egotistical about my\ngrades but the fact that i'm able to\ncoast along and just get that i feel\nlike sort of is handicapping me in a way\num for the future\nor maybe not i i i'm kind of torn\nbetween that or are my motors going to\nkick in when they need to kick in and\nright now i can idle and so i'm just\nidling you know and i i don't know the\nanswer that's some things i'm hoping you\ncan help me figure out am i lazy am i\nunmotivated\nuh i don't know\ni'm very lazy i'll tell you that right\nnow\ntell me about that\ni would love to tell you about that\nbecause that's something i would like to\ntalk about\num\nsmall things that require no\nintelligence or no thought or no no\npresent no challenge\ni i i till the till the dishes are piled\nup in the sink and i'm out of clean\nclothes those things aren't getting done\nuntil the floors look disgusting they're\nnot getting swept and mopped so the\ntable is covered in dust i'm not gonna\ndust it\ni hate that kind of thing i i don't hate\nit i\nand the interesting thing is\ni don't hate it when i'm doing it i\ndread it when i'm planning it when i'm\ndoing it it's sort of a zen thing you\nget into where you just turn your brain\noff and you go\nand yet i dre i dread it right so i\ndon't know\nbut on the other hand if a pro if\nsomething comes up and it seems really\nreally challenging and difficult and oh\ngod it's going to be brutal\nlet's go i'm on it and i will work\nmaniacally until in\ndone and so\nso\nis that a bit\ni would say that would be a benefit if i\nwould feel the fill that other time was\nsomething productive but i don't i feel\nit with watching youtube and playing\nvideo games and just time wasting reddit\nand just time wasting do you do you have\nfun playing video games and watching\nyoutube\nwatching youtube know i feel like i'm\nactually addicted to uh youtube to be\nhonest with you i\nit's addictive man it pulls you in\nyou're going to watch one thing and then\nthe next thing you know you're just\nblindly clicking videos that sound\nmildly interesting trying to find\nsomething a video that you can actually\nmake it through to the end that's in\nand it's like a vicious cycle and i will\nkeep you up till three in the morning\nsometimes when i have to be in bed at\n10.\num\nthat's something i struggle with a lot\nmy video game at the love hate\nrelationship i play world of tanks i'm\nterrible at it but\nwhat are you gonna do one of us if you\nsay that a video game is a is a\nlove-hate relationship that means you're\none of us\nright absolutely if you don't hate at\nleast half eight your video game you're\nnot doing it right\nhmm\nso anthony what can i help you with\nwell\ni guess just like how do how do i\nokay another thing i guess i'm not done\nokay um\ni have not been with a woman since i've\nbeen out\ni've not really seen any that i've been\nattracted to\nto be honest with you that aren't in a\nrelationship or whatever the case may be\nbut also i just don't seem to feel a sex\ndrive that other people feel like ever\nwell i mean i i masturbate i stop\nevery month or so once a month or so but\nthat's quite low i know i i see the\nurges that other people have and i've\nnever really felt those i've never felt\nvery\nvery uh i guess that a very cerebral\ni've never felt very\nvery sexually uh\ndriven\nand uh\noh but a lot of people ask me what are\nyou gonna hook up with a woman man\nand i would like to i'm not saying i\nwouldn't like to very much like to\nbut i just don't have that impulse to go\nout and get it i'm waiting on her to\nknock on my door i suppose\nyou mentioned that there's damage to\nyour legs and you feel pain is that\nright yeah yeah i learned pretty bad how\nare you i know it's kind of like a weird\nquestion do you know if you have like\nany atrophy of the of the quadriceps\nmuscles\nso i don't have a calf muscle at all i\ndon't know let me see if you can see\nwhat we're working with here\ni don't know may i don't know what the\nquadricep is so i don't know thighs are\nyour thighs atrophied\nso no but my calf muscle is okay um and\nmy feet are deformed i have horrible\nsciatica\nuh back pain um\njust like\nand it's getting worse like i've been to\ndoctors and they pretty much tell me i'm\nimagining things or that there's nothing\nthey can do about it basically is what\nit boils down to\num\nbut then they don't look either they\ndon't they never touch you they won't\nactually cut your back and i don't know\nif that's how you examine a back but i\nwould think that touching the back as a\nprofessional would be a good place to\nstart they won't even lay a finger on\nyou they won't even touch you\nthey ask you questions they send you in\nfor an mri that's about that big you get\nthat much of them to look out of your\nback oh no we don't see anything sorry\ntry these exercises try these stretches\nthose don't work oh then we're out of\nideas\nand so\nthat's very frustrating like a straight\nleg test where they lift up your heel\ndo they do this i don't know\ni don't i think maybe a physical\ntherapist did\ni'm a [ __ ] psychiatrist\nyou're supposed to do that\nokay so\ni would like to learn\nokay\nwhy am i so lonely and alone\ncan that be changed and if not how do i\nmake peace with that\nand\num\nhow do i find a purpose in life like i\ndon't\nlike computer programming is just for\nit's just something to do i feel no\npassion for it whatsoever it's just it's\ninteresting i'll give it that it's\ninteresting and it's challenging but\nit's not something i'm like\nah this is something i'm really driven\nto do and i used to feel that way about\nthings and i\ni still do about some things you know\npolitics but\ni\nprobably shouldn't honestly i i got\ninvolved in prison politics pretty\nheavily\nas a white person\nand\ni'm a pretty virulent anti-semite\num\nand i feel very strongly about that i'm\nnot a racist but i'm very anti-semitic\num\nand so\nthat's not something that's really\nsocially acceptable in 2021\nand uh\nis what it is i don't care i believe\nwhat i believe and i\ni know what i know and so it is what it\nis it's not up for debate or negotiation\num\nbut\ni want to know what to do with my life i\nwant to know how do i find passion about\nsomething\nanything i used to believe in in\nreligion well i was the first thing to\ngo\nyou know although interestingly the more\ni study quantum physics in the beginning\nof the universe the more that just\nsounds like god so i don't know maybe\nthe more i learn the more\nthe more religious i become\ninterestingly um so i guess i'm just\nmore questioning on a religious aspect\nbut\nthat really doesn't that institution\ndoesn't have the the faith for me it\nonce had the government has lost all\ncredibility with me long since probably\njust as i got older\num maybe that's natural you see you know\nhow the sausage is being made and that's\nan ugly process in general\num\nand so politics has lost all of its\nthat institution has lost all its\ncredibility for me the media has lost so\nlike\nwhat do i believe in i guess that's what\ni'm what am i to believe in maybe that's\nwhat i'm trying to get to what am i to\nbelieve in\ndo you feel lonely\nyes\nand no i love solitude but at the same\ntime i feel so lonely sometimes i see\nbeing with other people looks like fun\nfrom the outside\nbeing with other people is a trying\nchore for me tell me about that\nit's nothing not bad it just it feels\ntiring i i at the end of it i want the\nwhole time i want to go home\ni don't say that but i'm just like i'm\njust like i'd rather be home doing my\nthing anyway i'm out\nwhat what what is it that's trying about\nbeing with other people\nwhat drains you\nthey're trying to be interest facade\nperhaps putting on a facade\num\nbecause in reality so i displayed a\nlittle bit of personality here you know\ni can make a little joke now and then\nbut in reality everybody that is a\nfacade if it were just me being me i'm\nprobably the most boring\nmonotone person you've ever met in your\nlife until i get interested in a topic\nand then i will just spew\nthis wall of\nknowledge at you about that subject\nyou know more than you ever wanted to\nknow about this subject probably you\nnever wanted to know anything about it\nbut i knew it right\nand i want to share it with you and\nthat's the only thing i ever get excited\nabout is things that i know learning\nknowledge\num i love learning i love i love knowing\nthings and i love learning and if there\nwere a way to monetize that that would\nbe fantastic but\nlike being a professional student\nyes that would be amazing\nokay\nhmm\ni'm gonna need like a minute to think\nyeah yeah process i'm ready for you\nso you know anthony my first reaction is\nthat i would expect to feel emotionally\nworse listening to your\nstory like it sounds like you've been\nso you know once again we don't diagnose\nthings on stream\nbut there's one diagnosis that comes to\nmind which is a diagnosis that one of um\nso there was a nurse who worked in the\nemergency room where i trained or did\nmost of my emergency shifts\nand so she was like awesome is awesome i\npresume i'm sure she's still working\nthere so she was like older wiser you\nknow i think a lot of times we think\nabout doctors as experts but in my\nexperience like wisdom comes from nurses\nmore often than not\nand and so\ni think that um she had an interesting\ndiagnosis so sometimes we'd see these\npeople honestly like yourself to be\ncompletely honest like 16 years old\nusually adolescents\nuh a list of different diagnoses\num a list of like you know you look at\ntheir like chart and it's like they were\nin this foster home went to juvie for a\nyear like we'd get these like 17 year\nold kids\nreally nasty to talk to\nyou know like you go into the room and\nthey're they're like you know\nkind of\nacidic\nnot pleasant\num and so her diagnosis was [ __ ] life\nsyndrome\nso it's not any of the fancy stuff\nthat's in the chart it's not depression\nit's not bipolar it's not substance use\nit's not trauma like they have all of\nthose things\nbut the real diagnosis is [ __ ] life\nsyndrome\nand it was one of the most like\neye-opening\num\nkind of like\nteaching points for me that like we can\nput all kinds of labels on you right but\nlike i don't think that any of those\nlabels actually capture who you are\num you know convicted felon um you know\nchad with a 4.0 gpa without studying\ncomputer science you know like\nthere are all kinds of labels like\ntrauma victim like absolutely like all\nthose labels check out\nyou know i i don't think cerebral is\nanother example\ni don't think they're all bad\num someone who can't forgive which i\nthink is fair enough i don't think you\nshould try very much harder to be honest\nbut i don't think any of those are who\nyou are and so oddly enough like what i\nsee is like a dude who's basically had\nsome like really really bad luck have\nyou made some bad choices sure but i\ndon't know that you were ever taught\nwhat a good choice is\num\nyou know should you be held responsible\nfor\nshooting someone absolutely\nand yet should you also should we also\nlike\ni don't know how else to say this i\ndon't think we should overreact to that\ndata point in determining who you are\nright it's an action\nlike is it a bad action is it a horrific\naction is it an action that you may\nnever get forgiveness for sure i think\nall of those things are correct\ni'm not implying otherwise\nand at the same time it's still an\naction is it a catastrophic one\nabsolutely but i don't think it\ndetermines who you are and this is where\nlike you know i draw a little bit on on\nkind of eastern philosophy and i think a\nbig part of that is that\nthe human ego identifies with actions\nyou cannot be a failure that's not a\nthing you can fail\nbut you can't be a failure but the human\nbrain and especially our ego our hamkar\nidentifies with our actions right so\neven if you like look at me and you say\nlike i'm a doctor like that's not a real\nthing\nlike very s\nprecisely\nhow do you know that someone is a doctor\nwell i have like a piece of paper that\nhas a medical degree\nbut i would be the first to say the\nmoment i got that medical degree is not\nthe moment i became a doctor it happened\nlike six months later\nbut i i like know when it\nbut it's not anything that you can\nmeasure i mean you can in because\nthere's a societal you know agreement\nthat i'm a doctor\num\nbut i as and so i think that like a lot\nof this is like there's a lot of stuff\nhere for sure and a lot of it's bad for\nsure have you been through a lot\nabsolutely has that screwed you over in\nsome very fundamental ways like\nabsolutely\nso like did you miss core developmental\nmilestones that help you understand like\nhow to engage with other people yes\noddly enough i find myself not being\nhopeless\nso i think that just hearing you and\nlistening to you and like just like\nseeing the way that you relate\nlike are you what i'm sort of getting\nthe sense of is that your\nhow can i say this\ni think ninety percent of what holds you\nback is what you've had to learn to\nsurvive\nand so the good news is that like i\nthink you can unlearn that stuff\nand you can i'm not i'm not kidding\nanthony when i say you could on your\n50th birthday\nbe married have a stable job be paying a\nmortgage and like live in the burbs like\ni don't think that that's an\nunreasonable thing for you to have\nnine years from now\nright like\nis it is it a long road sure is it gonna\nbe tough absolutely\nhave you pulled yourself up by your\nbootstraps it sounds like you're in the\nprocess are there a lot of like oh i own\nmy own house right now\nokay out in the mountains\nuh i got a beautiful house like honestly\nit's my dream house it's it it was it's\nstill a crap hole but it's i built this\noffice myself like everybody that's\ncoming along so that's i'm making\nsignificant progress but i just i feel\nlike that other person to share with is\na vital missing component\nbut it also fills me with dread the\nthought of having to go out and\nobtain that and and and put myself out\nthere and\nand share my life with somebody else you\nknow what i mean that sounds very trying\nyeah so what what fills you with dread\nabout finding someone\nso every girl every girl i've ever\nexpressed any interest in\nonly likes me as a friend or boy that\nshe sure likes me like a brother you\nknow i get that a lot friends um okay so\nyou really are one of us\nright and this is going to come off as\njudgmental but that's only because i am\njudgmental and as shitty as that is\nthat's who i am as a person and they try\nto hook me up with anybody\nit's usually a bridge troll to be honest\nand it's like is that how little you\nthink of me\nthat this is somebody you think i would\nbe sexually attracted to right i see\nyour disgust on your face and and like i\nsaid i'm a judgmental person\nunfortunately you see disgust on my face\noh maybe i'm misreading maybe i'm\nmisreading what are you reading i'm\ncurious\njust when i when i when i said the thing\nabout the bridge troll you look like a\ndisapproving look perhaps perhaps i\nmisinterpreted\num but nevertheless um those are my\nfeelings and uh i must be true to myself\num\ni know i'm not that attractive but i\nwant okay so i put myself at about a\nthree maybe but i'm looking for like an\neight\nand so i have not and but i also don't\nwork out i also don't go anywhere to\nwhere i can meet anybody\ni also don't uh\ni also don't actually talk to any women\nother than when they engage the\nconversation like in a professional\nlevel or whatever the case may be or men\ni'm it's not just women don't get me\nwrong i i don't have any friends i i i'm\npretty much a hermit shut-in\ni leave when i need to leave to go do\nsomething i come back as soon as i can\nand other than that i i'm content in my\nhouse\num\nuh probably a lot of social anxiety\ni i'm not even gonna say that because\ni'm not gonna self-diagnose i don't know\nanything about it sure so\ni would like to\ni would like i would like to\nlike i said come to terms with that\naspect of myself or figure out a way to\novercome it\num i would like to know who i am as a\nperson\ni know that's a lot to ask for but\num\nwhat makes it a lot to ask for\ni'll tell ya\nthe question i always dread in a rat in\nan interview\ntell me about yourself\ni i don't know what's i don't have\nanything i come up empty\ni come up empty i have no likes i have\nno dip i have not many dislikes i have a\ncouple's pretty specific ones but not\nmany dislikes\num\ni'm pretty\nindifferent about everything i'm just\nlike i can take it or leave it you want\nto go here let's go i don't care i have\nno opinion on the matter right\num\nso i almost have no i'm all i feel like\ni almost lack a personality in a way\nbecause\nif you were to ask me to list 10 things\ni'm interested in\nphysical things not subjects that i can\nlearn about because i could list you 100\nof those\nwhy why\nbut why do you discount subjects from\nlike things that you're interested in\nwhat i mean is okay so if you ask me 10\nthings i wanted to go out and do\nactually do in the world\ni would struggle with that\nokay\ni would struggle with that\nin general yeah i just i don't know who\ni am and i don't i don't know how to\nstart\nlearning what i like in the world and\nwhat i don't like in the world because\n16\n36 i was incarcerated okay\nthose are the years where you go to\ncollege those are the years where you're\nin your 20s and you're out and whatever\npeople in their 20s do i've only seen\nsitcoms about it so i don't know um jail\nstunted him yes but form poker butt farm\npoker that's exactly right um jail\nstunted me um i missed out on a lot of\nthe the um the the the experiences that\npeople that people have and so\nokay can you possibly know anything\nabout the world yes yes let me just let\nme think okay\nlet me just compose my thoughts\nso let's think about what are the issues\nhere because there's a lot\nokay\nthank you builder or\ngive me a second\nyes please take all the time you need\nso\ni don't know where to put this okay\nokay\nuh\nokay so let's i'm just gonna think out\nloud all right so you let me know\nso you've given me a lot of pieces\ni'm gonna try to assemble them in some\nway\nfeel free to jump in if you feel like\nthere's a piece that doesn't fit\nproperly\nso the first thing is\nyou got born into [ __ ] life syndrome\nokay that's gonna screw you in a lot of\nways so like let's think about the\nimpacts of like so we get conditioned\nby our upbringing and we get all this\nsuper basic conditioning like how to\nrelate to other people\num even like how to understand what we\nfeel\nuh\neven like discovering what we\ndiscovering what we like\nand who we are\nso who we are comes from external\nconditioning actually so like this is\nsomething so let's just like take a step\nback and understand what's going on okay\nso when you're like a three-year-old kid\nyour brain is absorbing all kinds of\nstuff it's like understanding like how\ndoes gravity work like what's the\npurpose of smiling\nlike who am i so identity in its most\noriginal form is actually formed by the\nreflections of people around us\nso i don't know like if i'm a if i'm a\nsix month old like i don't know who i am\ni don't know what i'm feeling all i know\nis that something is unpleasant so it is\nthe way that people relate to me that\nhelp me understand oh this\nunpleasantness is something called\nhunger and if i you know get some food\nor drink some milk like then i will feel\nbetter maybe this unpleasantness is like\ni need a diaper change so like the way\nthat we make sense of the world and how\nwe understand the world works is all\nlike taught to us in our early\nupbringing okay\nso you're screwed there so far we'll get\nto that okay you're not screwed forever\nbut i think you know in terms of how do\ni form relationships how do i love\nsomeone like i don't know that you know\nhow to love someone\num and we'll get to that in a second\nexpand before you move on yeah sure\nso\ni try to get love by buying people\nthings i try to keep friendships by\nbuying people things with money or\nextravagant gestures and it never works\ni found that all my friendships end the\nfirst time i say no to some outrageous\nfavor that i don't want to do\nthey fall off the face of the earth and\nso that's how i relate to love please\ncarry on yeah so that's case in point\nright so like that's what i'm saying is\nlike i i don't think you were ever\ntaught like how to form a healthy\nrelationship\nand so you're gonna enter into these\nself-fulfilling prophecies of like enter\ninto a relationship and so cerebrally\nlike this is hard because essentially\nwhat you're doing is your intellect\nis like carrying you\nupstream against like a tide of like\nempathic blindness so you don't know\nlike normal humans and i don't mean to\nbe denigrating when i say that but i i\ngenuinely do think that you've like\nmissed some mate like regular\nopportunities and when i when i said i\nthink it's important to acknowledge that\nbecause a lot of us like take this for\ngranted right like i grew up with two\nloving parents so like it wasn't hard\nfor me to learn how to love my kids\nbecause i was taught like i know how to\ninteract with a two-year-old because\ni've been on the receiving end of it\nright i'm not trying to make a\ncomparison i'm just saying that i've\ncome to appreciate so many advantages\nthat i had that like other people don't\nhave and if we want to fix a problem we\nhave to start by understanding like\nwhere it comes from\nso i think you missed a lot of different\nmilestones so there's like concrete work\nthat you need to do about learning how\nto behave in a relationship um you know\nhow to understand even what you feel\num\ndiscovering like who you are so i want\nyou to imagine that you know when you've\ngot a six-year-old who goes to like\nt-ball practice\nand hits a home run\nthen like\nthe way that people respond to that\nsix-year-old helps that six-year-old\nlike understand who he is\nright so like that six-year-old benz is\nlike oh i'm a champion cool\nand then the six-year-old goes around\nand tells people i'm a champion i'm a\nchampion i'm a champion and if he has\npoor parents they will encourage him to\nthink that he is a champion and better\nthan all other human beings and he will\nbecome a spoiled brat\nif he has parents that are a little bit\nbetter or other people like or other\nkids who are like hey you're not a\nchampion i'm a champion\nthen you know like he'll learn over time\nthat okay i can be a champion but like\nother people can be champions too\nthere's just so much like subconscious\nprogramming that goes on with like\nhealthy human relationships and our\nbrain is sort of wired to like absorb\nthis stuff like a sponge and i think\nthat unfortunately like your brain\nabsorbed a lot of bad things or like\nunfortunate lessons\nright like like in terms of how you\nestablish relationships how you deal\nwith dissatisfaction within\nrelationships right so like it's yelling\nat people blaming others i think that\nyou have some of that programming baked\nin\nbut through\nvirtue of your cerebral nature and\nself-reflection and like a lot of for\nlack of a better term spiritual work i\nthink you've learned how to not be those\nthings but i would not be surprised if\nunder periods of stress some of those\nbehaviors activate\nso you're not instantly instantly tell\nme instantly go to anger when i like\nunder stress\ni\neither shut down yep\nis the best i can describe it\nalmost like when it burst into tears as\nweird as that sounds like a child\nlike just helplessly like ah or\nanger\nyou know\ni was backing out of a spot at\nmcdonald's\nand the car behind me honked\nyou know i stopped my car i put it in\nthe park i got out i went up to the car\nand i started screaming at that car what\nare you honking about and only when the\nwindow rolled down and i realized it was\na woman with a little girl in there did\ni say oh i apologize and i got back in\nmy car and i went about my business\nand that's not me generally that very\nmuch surprised me i have to be honest\nand i didn't even feel like i was under\na particularly lot of stress\num\nbut\nyou know i also find myself binge eating\nlate at night\num i'm a chronic heavy drug user\nright now of marijuana\nfrom the time i wake up to the time i go\nto sleep i'm high\num\nand so i'm like am i binge eating or do\ni have the munchies because because\nwhat's funny is\nmaybe you can help me answer this\nbecause i'll get up and i'll find myself\nin the fridge binge eating and i look at\nthe clock and it's always about 1103\n1104 at night like 11 o'clock comes and\nall my restraints fall and if i'm still\nwatching youtube at that time i ain't\ngoing to sleep till like three in the\nmorning it's not like is that a thing\nwhere after a certain time you're a\nstraight out yes it's absolutely a thing\nso if let's just talk about binge eating\nfor a second\nso i'm the same way by the way\n10 to 11 is my time too\nand and so this is where if we\nso\nour brain\nhas impulses\nand as our brain gets fatigued\nespecially our frontal lobes our ability\nto restrain impulses goes down so if you\nlook at for example like i don't know\nhow to say this but\nyou know\nit's easier to go to bed at 10 sometimes\nthan it is at like 12 or 1\nbecause like at 10 even though you're\nless tired you have enough like frontal\nlobe function that you can restrain your\nability to stay up and then once you\ncross into like midnight and then your\nbrain is fatigued you can't pull\nyourself away from things as powerfully\nright right\nwe absolutely see an increase in\nimpulsive behavior and binge eating\nbecause your brain is just tired and you\ncan't control yourself anymore right\nlike you're fatigued\num\nbut yeah so like i said i think that you\nknow as you get under periods of stress\nlike that programming is kind of baked\nin it's very like subconscious in terms\nof how your neurons have been wired and\nlike you know when i feel mad when i\nfeel frustrated or when i feel\nfrightened because i can imagine that\nactually your physiologic response is\none of a startling in fear\nand then adrenaline pops through your\nsystem and then like your brain is like\nkind of goes into fight or flight mode\nand since you spent 20 years in prison\nwhere\nflight is an option\nyou've adapted to fight with when you\nhave an adrenaline response right so now\ni'm kind of getting ahead of myself\nbecause i want to start with like let's\nstart with let's say\n[ __ ] life syndrome which you're going to\nhave a lot of it's an uphill battle bro\ni'm sorry to say like it's just an\nuphill battle that's just the truth of\nit\nthe second thing is that i think that\nwhat's happened is you've adapted to\nyour circumstances so you've learned how\nto survive\nright and like learning how to survive\ninvolves a second layer of programming\nwhich is you know how do i deal with\nconflict well like you know you shift\nsomeone because like that's what you got\nto do in prison\nand and so you know in that moment like\nthis is like it's not in a sense it's\nkind of not your fault because your\nbrain has been wired a particular way i\nstill think you're responsible but you\nknow if you think about the instinctual\nreaction of like fight or flight and how\nyou respond to that if we think about\nyou know like a veteran who was in a war\nwho's got ptsd and then a door slams and\nthey like they think they're under\nattack our brain is wired and responds a\nparticular way\nso i think half of what we're dealing\nwith the shitlife syndrome half of what\nwe're dealing with is the adaptations to\nshitlife syndrome and this is where i\nthink actually there's a lot of stuff\nthat you can work on\nso um you know you i think that in some\nways uh\nanthony you're very cerebral but i also\nthink it sounds like you're incredibly\nrigid you don't sound open-minded to me\nso i think that this is where\nso like like i think in some directions\nyou're willing to learn but once your\nmind gets made up so like when you talk\nabout anti-semitism for example when you\ntalk about other things or like when you\ntalk about the bridge trolls you know so\nso it's interesting because you're\nopen-minded like except for some issues\nin which case i'm a three and i deserve\nan eight and like there's a lot there\nyou know i i wasn't responding with no\ndeserve hope to get but no you're\nabsolutely right about the rigidity\nthank you and your and\nthe way you put it was perfect once my\nmind is made up because i don't make up\nmy mind easily in fact that's something\ni have a very hard time doing but once i\nmake up my mind it is made up\nso so then i think the the challenge\nthere is that i want you to think for a\nsecond take a step back\nand imagine all of the conclusions that\nyou have been forced to accept over the\nlast let's say 30 years\nright and so what's happening is you've\ngot a lot of conclusions which have been\nmade up for a good reason but like\nthey're\nthey're adaptations to situations which\nyou don't exist in anymore\nright so like the way that you relate\nlike the way that you love someone\nis like confusing because you clearly\nlove your mom she taught you what love\nis and she was incredibly abusive\nso you know i imagine that it's gonna\nfeel very strange for you if you ever go\non a date and like someone expresses\ncompassion and so then what you end up\ndoing is like\nyou know you play the game the way that\nyour intellect has told you it's to be\nplayed which is like okay how do i get\nsomeone to like me i like do things for\nthem that's what happens in a\nrelationship but then you sort of enter\ninto the self-fulfilling prophecy which\nis kind of like bullying where there's\nsomething and i hate to break this to\nyou but i think you are the common\ndenominator that's a interesting\nthing\nokay so let's just talk about this for a\nsecond because when a lot of times\npeople's shame and sense of failure\nkind of piles onto this idea of being a\ncommon denominator\nbut i think there's a really tricky\nthing to understand is that if you are\nthe common denominator the power to\nchange is also in your hands\nright that's interesting yeah it's true\nso like if you kind of think about it\nlet's just be honest because your\nintellectual mind is saying hey i'm the\ncommon denominator like it's something\nto do with me and that's where you have\nto be kind of careful because if you've\ngrown up with bullying\nwhat your mind automatically does is oh\nit's like my fault and there's something\nfundamentally wrong with me but chances\nare it's some kind of behavior\nright like so as you kind of noted that\nkids can get a lot of social status by\nstanding up to you\nand so early on you know you didn't\nrespond to kids in a particular way\nwhich like sort of sets you out as a\ntarget and then when you go to prison\nyou realize oh like i can't be a target\nanymore and then you kind of swung the\npendulum the other way and then you're\nyelling at you know mom's in the\nmcdonald's parking lot because like\ndamned if because you had to learn that\nit was like survival it was adaptation\nright and that's gonna echo\nand so probably what you're dealing with\nis some combination of the two where at\ntimes you feel like\nyou know the other shoe is gonna drop\nand like no one is gonna care about you\nand you're gonna wind up getting bullied\nand like if people express compassion\nyou know like you don't know how to\nhandle it\num and then on the flip side maybe you\ngo into survival mode but it's like\nreally hard to be like kind of tranquil\nand in the middle\nbecause i think the really interesting\nthing is like you know how do you think\nyou are coming across in this interview\ni don't know i to be honest with you i'm\ntrying to drop all my guards and just be\nas honest as i can so i'm not really\neven trying to focus on that i\nunderstand that so how does that feel\nfine because you're a complete and total\nstranger and i'll never see you\nnor will i ever see anybody in chat\nwould i share any of these things with\nsomebody i would ever see again i i\nthink no i would have a really hard time\non i'm so i'm burdening myself like that\nso let's play this tape through to the\nend\nif we were gonna see you what so like\nyou're like you're saying that there's\nno consequence because we're never gonna\nsee you again right\nright let's pretend that\nwhere i'm gonna see like we're gonna see\neach other\nwe're gonna like hang out once a week\nfor the next four weeks\nwhat would you be afraid of me believing\nabout you after this conversation like\nwhat do you think you're how do you\nthink you're coming across\nsmart maybe i i i'm at a loss i just i\ndon't understand how other people know\nthings like that i don't know the answer\nto your question i'm sorry yeah so that\nthat's totally fine you don't need to so\ni think that's kind of telling because\ni want you to just point i want to point\nout to you that you're afraid of being\njudged right that's why you would you're\nlike you're afraid of being judged but\nas we tunnel down into what is the\njudgment that you're afraid of you come\nup empty\nso this general all right\nso this is really important anthony so\nwhat that means\nis that\nthe fear that you have is like an echo\nfrom a primitive state of your brain\nso like there's like there's no\nthere's no like nuance or specificity to\nit it's just like i can't tell people\nhow i feel otherwise bad [ __ ] happens\nyou know like the one time you're\nauthentic with your mom and you're like\nwow it sounds like you have trouble\nrelating to people at work it's just\nlike a simple observation that's\ncompletely authentic and boom\nyou're screwed so i think almost like a\nptsd kind of thing where you're you've\nlearned that like being authentic with\npeople is tough but let's be straight\nbro like you call in women bridge trolls\nyou're voicing being anti-semitic\nyou know you're telling people that you\nkilled someone\nand\nare i think generally speaking people\nlike you\nlike i think i don't think that like\nchat i don't know i'm not looking at\nchat and i encourage you not to but i\nthink that like you know people can\nrespect you\ndespite these things that are negative\nand i think part of that comes from like\nowning the things that are negative in\nyour life right\nand so i think there's a really tricky\nthing and this is kind of how i would\nrecommend you move forward is that you\nkeep on putting on a mask whereas like\nif you really want to form a connection\nwith someone you have to like let people\nin on the inside\nand then it's terrifying because then we\nmay think you're a racist [ __ ] which\nyou could be\nbut just because you're\nyeah but i'm also a good person i feel\nlike there's a dichotomy yeah i i i\nagree right so i think that people can\nbe you know you can the people are not\nlike black or white\nand so i you know i would and we'll get\nto the rigid thinking and stuff later\nbut so i i think it's kind of\ninteresting because what you're afraid\nof is like you're literally like having\na conversation with thousands of people\non the internet and and you're like\nbeing relatively authentic i don't get\nthe sense that you're bsing us\num\nand\nyou're afraid of some consequence which\nmakes perfect sense\nbut at the same time like the more that\nyou tunnel down into like oh what are\nthey gonna think and you're like i don't\nreally know\nso then it's like a very primitive fear\nthat doesn't actually have like legs to\nstand on does that make sense\nwell it's rejection i know what i'm\nafraid of it's rejection because it's\nconsistent\ni've never successfully asked a woman or\na girl out through school or is it i've\nnever successfully managed that the one\ntime i had sex\ni was in my brother's town and she was\njust\nthe very friendly girl in town who was\npretty much the man maker um if you went\nto her house you're pretty set so that's\nhow that went down\nand\nit was awkward and uncomfortable and\nand embarrassing and i did not enjoy it\ni got zero enjoyment out of it zero\num\nso\nyeah so\nso here's what i'm getting the sense of\nlike honestly anthony what i feel more\nthan anything else talking to you is\nthat you're dormant\nlike i get the sense that there's\nthere's a whole\nlife and person\nand like positivity that's just been\nlike slumbering and you just haven't had\nthe chance\nto like wake up and really like\nbe for lack of a better term\nand so i think you know when you were\ntalking about like motivation and\nfeeling lazy like i wasn't worried at\nall i think your\nthe problem is that there's just nothing\nto motivate you like\nso i'm pretty sure that when a challenge\nkicks in you'll be fine like i think\nthat you're gonna do great it's gonna be\na bumpy ride so when the challenge kicks\nin you're gonna find out that your\nhabits are lacking but i think generally\nspeaking\nmy recommendation to you if you're lazy\nis like do more not less like don't if\nyou don't feel motivated don't go\nhunting for artificial motivation i know\nit sounds kind of weird don't just like\nwake up every day and be like oh my god\nlike i need to do the dishes because\nlike that's motivation i'm gonna find my\ninternal self i'd say\nyou've missed out on life you've missed\nout on 41 years of life basically\nso what i'd say first and foremost is\nlike start living right like that's your\njob forget about purpose forget about\nmaking the world a better place you've\nmissed out\nso missed out on all kinds of things\nbeing challenged failing even then i\nknow you say you've gotten rejected a\nlot but i don't think that you've ever\ngotten rejected maybe you have but i\nfeel like every failure you've had has\nbeen part of a rigged game\ni don't know that you've ever been on\nyour a game and really been the best\nhuman you can possibly be\nwhen you ask out a girl i don't know\nthat you've had a career and like you\nknow been in shape and and like you know\ndone some emotional work and like worked\nwith a therapist like i don't think that\nyou've you know you've never played a\nfair [ __ ] game so you got to be super\ncareful about the identity of i am a\nfailure when you've never played a fair\ngame\nand something tells me so i'd say that\nyou know programming is going to get\nharder you can slide through with 4.0\nfor now but i'd say let it get harder\nand then rise to the challenge\nand then keep climbing and eventually\nyou'll equilibrate and i think that'll\nbe like fulfilling for you even if you\ndon't love programming at least you're\nnot going to be [ __ ] bored\nright because your enemy right now is\nlike idleness and\nyou're slumbering like i feel like i'm\ntalking to a slumbering giant and i\ndon't know if you're gonna turn into a\nprogrammer i don't know if you're gonna\ndo like\nanalytics for like cambridge analytica\nand and you know help promote\nanti-semitism around the world or like\nwhatever you end up doing you know but i\nthink something challenging is gonna it\nis\nis gonna engage you right and it's gonna\ndemand of you like what you look at that\nnow this is a facial expression we\nhaven't seen at all\nwhat is it what are you smile\nno you've smiled here\nthis is different you made a really good\njoke and then i was thinking that would\nbe great if i could put that into action\nbut unfortunately i don't feel like my\nanti-semitic semitism is an exportable\nexportable good\ni'm pretty sure that some people would\ndisagree with you but i think what i saw\nfor the first time anthony was\nexcitement\nwe've seen you smile we've seen you\nlaugh i don't think i've ever seen\nexcitement even now you're kind of\nlagging so it was frozen and kind of an\nexcited\nframe but\ni i think i got a touch i wasn't sure\nbut you know i think that there's\nthere's something when i when i speak\nabout this stuff i get that there's like\nactually like a very very there are a\ncouple embers\nburied in the coals\nyou know like there's a bunch of ash and\nthere's something down there that i\nthink just needs to wake up\nso practically i'd say keep studying cs\nby all means\num you know you'll rise up i think also\nin terms of like sexuality i think\nthere's been a lot of dormancy\nright when i kind of think about it it's\nsort of like you're rusty\nyou know so so it and not rusty isn't\njust in terms of a physical sense like a\nlot of sexuality has to do with like\nemotional intimacy and things like that\nwhich i think that you're rusty on or\nnever really learned how to do\num i do think there are a couple of\nreally high points i know this sounds\nkind of weird especially if we're\ntalking about sexuality but really not\nrelated but i think your hitchhiking\nexperience really gives me hope\nbecause what i'm what i'm really hearing\nfrom that experience is that you met\nlike random people\nand you were able to connect with them\nin like an authentic and and like\nmeaningful way\nright and like even when you talk about\nit like it's some of the best years of\nyour life and like why was that\nit's because you don't have to worry\nabout what people thought right like you\nwere just you\nand like you were didn't have a house\ndidn't have a job like you were in\nnothing\nyou didn't have to give anyone any gifts\nand what did they do for you anthony\nit helped me\nabsolutely and so just think about that\nfor a second that like when you are who\nyou are and you have nothing to give and\nthey don't owe you anything\nthat they see something within you that\nis worth helping\nand i see it too i'm pretty sure all of\nchat sees it too is that you are\nabsolutely someone who is scary and also\nworth helping\nyou know you're you have a certain like\ncranky bareness to you\nand i guess that a lot that am i upset\nbut i think i just have resting [ __ ]\nface because\nright now i feel completely new this is\na neutral face yeah you certainly but\nthat too is also like adaptive\nright\nwhere like you want to have neutral\naffect so people who grow up in abusive\nhouseholds learn how to become invisible\nlike because being noticed in some way\nis like you know\ni can imagine in prison resting [ __ ]\nface helps you\nlike it's actually quite adaptive and so\ni think the biggest\nproblem anthony that i think you you\nhave to face and this is going to be\nhard\nis there's a life like there's\nabsolutely life i'm not worried about\nthat at all i think the problem is that\ndiscovering that life requires you to\nundo all of the things that how can i\nsay this when you go to prison at the\nage of 16 and that feels like 20 life\nsentences\nthe only way you can survive that is to\nnumb yourself to the prospect of life\ni don't need life anymore right that's\nthe only way you survive your 18th\nbirthday in prison 21st birthday in\nprison 30th birthday in prison 35th\nbirthday in prison\nthe only way you survive that is by\ngiving up on life entirely and saying\nlike\ni have to exactly what i did yes\nany kind of joy\ngoal\nnot just dead you had to kill it bro\nright when a tiny bit of hope on your\n21st birthday\nyou don't dare hope hope hope keeps\nwanting to sprout up in your garden like\na weed and there you are every day\nplucking it out\nand then you\nyou wind up and you're asking like i\ndon't know what to get out of life and\nlike that's right bro because you spent\n20 years doing your level best to get\nnothing out of life\nright so i i don't think i know it\nsounds kind of weird but i don't think\nyou need to actually discover\nwhat you want from life i don't think\nit's this deep\npersonal journey\nthat you have to like go and spend time\nin the himalayas and things like that to\nlike discover what you want life i think\nall you've got to do is stop pulling out\nthe weeds\nand you've gotten so good at pulling out\nthe weeds that\nyou know it'll it'll come up and this is\nwhere you know i think there are a lot\nof things that you're doing that are\nquite amazing like 4.0 gpa in computer\nprogramming is not easy i imagine for a\n41 year old dude to do\nright like so you've got you've\ndefinitely got like things in your\ncorner that are working for you\nand so oddly enough i think your road\nforward is not about like\ndoing more it's actually about stopping\nto do what you have learned how to do\num\nis that can i keep going\nyes please do okay\nso\na couple of things to think about\npractically so i think you've got to\nthink long and hard i'm gonna zero in on\nthe bridge troll for a second okay\nyou've gotta think long and hard about\nsome of these things that you accept for\nyourself which i think you really need\nto reconsider\nso the first is like in your mind you're\na three i don't think you're three maybe\nyou are i don't know i'd like i'd like\nstick you to five okay\nand that you want an eight and that's\nfine but i think that when you really\nthink about what's important to you in a\nrelationship you don't sound like you're\nhorny all the time\nyou know you don't sound like like\nyou're i mean it sounds like you want\nsomeone\nwho you know if i could find someone for\nyou it's not so much about the physical\nattractiveness as it is about\nsomeone who can kind of like just listen\nto you talk about stuff right like you\njust need well because i like a\nconversation i like i like a smart\nperson who can give back as good as they\nreceive i like a conversationalist\nsure so if that's what you like and i\nsuspect that that's actually i know you\nlike it but i don't know if that's what\nyou need\ni i think what you need is probably like\na good woman who makes you think sh\nyou're having a conversation but is\nactually just letting you talk\nand i say this as someone who's being\nmarried to what i i know what it's like\nto be someone who likes to talk and\nlikes to think that they have a\nconversation but really what we like to\ndo people like us anthony we just like\nto talk\nright talking is great yes\nand and we like to think we're having a\nconversation but if someone's you know\nletting us speak our peace\nabout how the jews are ruining\neverything like you're going to love\nthat that's what you're that's what\nyou're going to want\nyes i go on those tangents sometimes i\ndo go on those tangents um\nyou know i i\nso it's like a cerebral maybe you can\nhelp me with this because it's like a\ncerebral wanting a family it's like a\ncerebral wanting a wife\nbut really it's i want to impress other\npeople and i think everything i do is is\nin an attempt to impress and i was\nactually this was just something that\ncame to me the last two three days i was\nthinking\nyou know when i was a kid i was a i was\na compulsive liar like\noutrageous lies not that i invented the\nquestion mark but uh\ni i remember when i was a kid i said i\ni was probably 11. i said i do like 120\nmile an hour fastball and of course\neverybody said i was full of [ __ ]\nbecause i knew nothing about\nbaseball whatsoever and i was just\ntrying to impress people and it feels\nlike\nevery decision i make\ni wanted the car what will other what\nwill what will other people think about\nwill other people be impressed by will\nit make other people\nyeah i i\nyeah i feel like i i feel like i try to\nimpress people\nor the other way i say things that are\nshocking yep\nright\nis it just attention-seeking behavior or\ndon't no what it is\nit's it's [ __ ] distraction from what\nyou really are\nright so you want to go you want to show\npeople the best parts of you or the\nworst parts of you as long as they don't\nsee you\noh\nthat is interesting\nwell i but i feel like i have nothing to\noffer yep that's why you don't want to\nsee it have no opinions like i said i\nhave no opinion no of course you haven't\ngot a doctor that's not true that's not\ntrue i have no like but hold on a second\nwrong preferences and hold on hold on\nbut there's another problem that you're\ndoing which is you're setting up a\nrigged game for yourself\nwhen you say like so earlier we had this\nconversation about like i'm not\ninterested in anything\nand then you like you walked yourself\nback and you're like no i'm interested\nin hundreds of things if you asked me\nabout an activity i wouldn't be able to\ncome up with a single one\nso it's like here's here's the test\nyou're able to pass this test and so\nsome part of your mind is like [ __ ] that\nwe don't want to pass the test let's\npick the one that we're going to fail\nright whereas like who you you may just\nnot be like a doer you're like a thinker\nyou're like a philosopher\nyou're like one of these guys that like\nthinks deeply okay\nyeah of course it's okay\nhow do you live like that\nyou hang out with other people who can\nhave conversations with you how do you\nhow do you feed yourself like that\nhow do you physically make money how do\nyou make money like that by being a\nthinker\nyeah\nso it's paying people to think\ni mean so any author who writes a book\nis someone that people\nokay okay okay fair enough right i got\nit yeah any any video essayist\nare you you're a thinker yeah you're\nabsolutely right yeah it's like you have\nto i have to be a little more\nimaginative with the medium yeah you're\nabsolutely right so i'm not saying you\nshould steer away from computer\nprogramming i think it's a really good\nso i'm on that\nbut i think long term and this is also\nwhere like who you are and how you get\npaid ideally we'll we'll get together\nbut honestly bro from like how far\nbehind you are i wouldn't shoot for that\nyet\nokay you know i think there's lower\nhanging fruit i'm not going to tell you\nmaybe it's a mean thing to say but i\nwouldn't shoot for you know you've just\ngot so many like people who can afford\nto be thinkers\noh yeah\nsometimes don't have\nthey have some advantages that you're\nplaying with a handicap so i i'd like\nshoot and you by all means like we\nshould cry over that if anything right\nthat life is so [ __ ] unfair to you\nthat other people have opportunities\nthat you may not have but on the flip\nside i could absolutely totally see\na really interesting kind of angle of\nhey i killed someone for 20 you know i\nspent 20 years in prison here's how i\nmade sense of my life like you could\nwind up on [ __ ] oprah and and you\nknow lifetime and like you could like\nput your like you could go down that\nroute like a lot of people are looking\nfor guidance and if you're able to find\nit you may be able to help other people\nas well like i don't know\nright when i say asperger's does that do\nanything for you\nbecause i read the descriptions of all\nthese various ailments and they all seem\nto match me perfectly so that\nyeah so here's here's here's what i'll\nsay about asperger's okay so if you want\nthat's where you should really get a\nfull mental health evaluation but\nwhat i will say is that\nif you look at the symptoms of\nasperger's\nthere are many things that can\ncontribute to those kinds of symptoms\nlike i've already explained to you you\nknow a lot of hypotheses besides\nasperger's or autism spectrum that can\ncontribute to your cognitive and\nempathic and friendship difficulties\ncertainly so the symptoms of asperger's\nor autism spectrum have multiple causes\nso sometimes it's autism spectrum but\nfrankly we see this in the gaming\npopulation as a whole\ni was talking to literally like my\npediatrician the pediatrician of my kids\nand she was saying that as technology\nusage has increased\nshe is getting like more asperger's like\npresentations from children but she\ndoesn't think that all these kids are on\nthe spectrum she thinks it has something\nto do with the way that they interact\nwith technology and how it shapes their\nbrains in terms of like social\ninteractions\nso that science is really interesting\ni'd say that you know we'll get to\nconcrete recommendations about mental\nhealth treatment a second but\num going back to like impressive\nyeah please and at the murder thing i\ndon't want to make light of it somebody\nlost their life and i see people joking\nand chat about i'm going to make a\nyoutube channel real life murder now\nthat somebody lost their life and i was\nmessed up that i did that that's not\nsomething i even like to talk about\nmuch less use as a as a form of\nadvertisement or i caused that family a\nlot of pain and that's really messed up\nthat i did that\nsure sure so i i completely agree with\nthat but i i think it's important to\nalso acknowledge that that's the way the\ninternet is\nright that we live in a world where if\nyou did something like that\nthere are going to be people who due to\nshot and freud or voyeurism or like\nbecause they're all looking for\nsomething like you know they're just\nlike you said they're like addicted to\nyoutube and they're looking for\nsomething that's gonna like excite them\nand make them feel something so i know\nit sounds kind of weird but i think that\nyour karma\nyour karma has set you up in a very\nunique way that i think could be an\nadvantage i know it sounds kind of weird\ni think it's hard to make that case and\ni mean overall that disadvantage\nabsolutely but it still makes you the\nperson that you are and i think the\nperson that you are\ni mean you have such a unique\nperspective on life\nthat could be very educational to people\nlike i've learned a lot you know and i\ndo this this is my job and i've still\nlearned a lot i've worked in prisons for\nmonths\nand i've never had a conversation with\nanyone in prison the way that i've had\nwith you\nbecause most of the time they're not as\nscribal as you are unfortunately right\nthey haven't done i wouldn't i had one\ncome to try to talk to me when i was\nlike 17 and and i would\ni always thought therapists were for\n[ __ ] were for where for fakers people\nwho just wanted attention or to cry and\nfeel sorry for themselves i think that\nwas just more of mom's\nmom's upbringing right there because\nthat's kind of what she instilled in me\nis that you know it's every man for\nhimself you got to pull yourself up by\nyour bootstraps you better keep your\nmouth shut nobody wants to hear you cry\nyeah i mean you just suck it up\nand so that's kind of that's kind of\nthat's kind of the philosophy i lived\nunder most of my life\nso can we go back to impressing people\nfor a second because i think there's a\nlot here yes carry on so so i i think\nthat um when it comes to impressing\npeople like i think it makes sense\nbecause you know you're concerned for\ngood reason\nthat what you are on the inside people\naren't gonna like right so like when you\nwere five and you don't know how to put\non a mask your mom was like really cruel\nto you your brother was like pretty\nneglectful you know i wonder a little\nbit about whether he was you know since\nyou were the favorite whether he\nresented you for that\num\nyou know there's there's a lot of stuff\nthere where you learned early on that\nlike who i am is like not an okay person\nand then that gets reinforced by you\nknow going to prison and putting on a\nmask and this kind of stuff and then you\nsort of also gets reinforced when you\nstart like doing really nice things for\npeople and you begin to see like oh if i\ngive people gifts like they're going to\nlike me and they'll want to hang out\nwith me this is how this game is played\nit's all very cerebral\nright\nso i think that as a result you're going\nto want to impress people because\nthere's probably also if we want to just\nbe blunt about there's some amount of\nshame right because you're a 41 year old\ndude you got laid like 25 years ago you\nknow\nthere's a lot of that crap and so to\ncompensate for all of that stuff\nthere's gonna be like i wanna because i\nfeel like i'm down here if i impress\npeople to this level i'll end up\nsomewhere in the middle where i can be\ncomfortable\nyou know even if i and so there's a lot\ngoing on there and so i'm not surprised\nthat you'll also swing to the other end\nof the sp spectrum because\nif you i don't know how to say this but\nif you advertise something really\nterrible you've done\nand then people hate you for it\nthat's the reason they hate you it's not\nbecause that's understandable exactly\nit's not because there's something\nbroken and unfixable and deep down and\npart of your dna\nthat\nif people saw like you would be\nabsolutely terrified if they hated you\nfor that but you're fearful that there's\nsomething within me that like\nif i ever let people see so then what\nyou do is you advertise all this\nnegative crap and it actually protects\nyou both ways either way what's\nhappening is no one is getting an\nauthentic you\nand so the tricky thing there is you\nknow i think stepping away from all of\nthis stuff\nso you try so hard you're trying to\nfigure out who am i well like i think\nall you need to do is stop moving away\nfrom it and you'll figure it out i think\nactually we know who you are i feel like\ni have a pretty good sense of who you\nare can you share\nyeah so i mean i think you're i think\nyou're the dormant philosopher\ni think that you like to think big\nthoughts you like to have your thoughts\nchallenged you want to have you want to\nput your thoughts out into the world and\nyou want to have respect for the quality\nand excellence of your thoughts\nwith all of that yep that it's who you\nare bro\nright like you want to say to the world\nlike i'm going to work really really\nreally hard at this and i'm gonna make\nit awesome and i'm gonna show it to you\nand y'all are gonna [ __ ] think it's\nawesome too\nthe day that you're able to do that i\nthink is gonna be the opposite end of\nthe spectrum of when you were suicidal\nand trying to find a reason to wake up\ntomorrow for tomorrow\nas long as you're moving in that\ndirection you're gonna fight to stay\nalive\nand the problem is that you've just been\ngiven such a shitty circumstance\nthat\nthat part of you has never had a chance\nto like\nexist in the world because who's going\nto listen to an ex-con who's going to\nlisten to this guy who's going to listen\nto like it\ndude without a shin\nyour mind is gonna fill in all these\ndifferent reasons why no one has had a\nchance to reason to listen to you but\nyou have a lot to say and it has immense\nvalue\nwhat do you think about that\ni think that'd be fantastic um\nif anybody wanted to talk to me about\nanything that'd be great yep\nso so and i think this is the tricky\nthing so now we get to like the rigidity\nright so you have to be careful because\nthe ego i think is shooting you in the\nfoot in some ways\nso when you know someone when you're\nattracted to someone because they're an\neight and you want to impress everyone\nbecause\nyou know this person's an eight and you\nwant to go on a date with them\nand they say hey i think you should\nreally meet my friend who's probably not\na three she's probably not maybe she\nreally is a bridge troll but i suspect\nthat your mind is warping her\nattractiveness\nand the second thing is like you're not\nlike a super sexual guy to begin with\nand do you want a hot girlfriend sure\nbut i think it would be wonderful if you\ncould like because attraction is more\nthan physical stuff right there's like\nintimacy there's emotional stuff people\nhave very healthy loving sexually\narousing relationships in their 70s\nlike they do that it's like normal right\nso i think a big part of that is is like\nyou're not giving people a chance\nto\nlike\nyou you're kind of writing yourself off\nright it's back to this idea of here's\nthe test that i can pass therefore i'm\ngoing to throw that one out the window\nand let me find one that i can fail\nand so when you talk about rejection\nfrom women that's fine but you know i\ndon't know that you're also playing a\nfair game there\nwhere like maybe\nyou are\nyou know and i'm not saying that you\ncan't get an eight like i think you can\nget an eight i think it's going to take\nsome work\nbut i think this is where other\nself-fulfilling prophecies could come in\nbecause the eight shows up and you're so\nconcerned about her not rejecting you\nthat you do a lot of nice stuff for her\nyou meet her emotional needs while not\nasking for anything in return in an\neffort to get her to like you and then\nshe starts treating you like a friend\nbecause that's like that's the thing\nright we're friends like friends are\nthere for each other\nand the start of the romantic\nrelationship is like different like\npeople usually make their intentions\nknow early on but this is how people\nkind of repeatedly get into the friend\nzone is you're afraid she's going to\nreject you so you want to stack the deck\nin your favor by doing a lot of nice\nthings yeah yeah the friend zone that's\nwhere i live that's my that's my address\nso so you stack you stack up on your\nside to get her to like you in a\nparticular like to get her to like you\nso you're there for her and then you\nknow women this is going to be a\ngeneralization which you know\nanyone can criticize me for fairly but i\nthink generally speaking like women are\nbetter at\noffering emotional support and receiving\nemotional support without it having a\nsexual connotation to it whereas like if\nyou were like the things that you do for\nthe women that friendzoned you you\nwouldn't do for your dude your boys\nright right\nyou know like like you treat them\ndifferently so like there's there's a\ninteresting thing about emotional\nsupport and sexual intimacy which men\ntend to tie together a little bit closer\nand women don't\nbroad sweeping generalization that's\nvery open to criticism\nbut i do think that the more you stack\nthe deck in your favor to try to get\nsomeone to like you the more likely\nyou're you are to end up in the friend\nzone\nso in this hypothetical scenario where i\ndo have an eight\nor even a seven or six i gotta be honest\ndo you i feel and i would want to know\nif you feel as well\ni i fear i would be extremely insecure\nand jealous\none time i had a girlfriend when i was a\nkid i was ex\nmassively insecure like like grossly so\nlike creepily weirdly\npsychotically so\nyep you're only with me because you like\nmy brother and and\nyeah so\ni don't know that i'm emotionally\nequipped for uh for a relationship of\nany kind you're you're do you think that\noh okay okay so i'm right then okay yeah\nso i i don't think you're emotionally\nequipped for a relationship but that\ndoesn't mean you shouldn't start dating\nand that also doesn't mean that you\nwon't become emotionally equipped over\ntime\nbecause if you've gotten this far\nwith this shitty hand of cards like i\nthink you could be emotionally equipped\nfor a relationship in no time\ndon't sell yourself short\nyou know you haven't really been trying\ni mean i know you've been trying in your\nway i don't think you've been engaged in\na in a positive learning environment\nthat's what i'd call it right so like\neven if you end up they end up\nrecommending what you call a three\nit's probably closer to a five\nand i think you should do your best to\nlike go and have a conversation with the\nperson you don't have to sleep with them\njust try to go and like make a friend\nlike fine well that hasn't by the way\nthat hasn't happened since i was sick 15\n14 years old so this is nothing reason\nthat has happened\nyeah so i yeah okay i don't even have\nany friends too i don't even have any\nfriends to refer anybody for me i don't\nknow how to make friends i don't go\nanywhere so that makes it hard\nthink to myself okay where do i go to\nmeet people well corona virus happens so\nokay fair enough but in normal\ncircumstances i don't know where one\ngoes as an adult to me\nfriends lovers you know just just other\nadults\nyeah so that's a challenging question\num i'm gonna i'm gonna table that for a\nsecond okay we'll get to concrete advice\num\nso the last thing that i want to share\nwith you is i think that like like you\nsaid you're going to be very insecure if\nyou enter into a relationship so the\nquestion is\nhow do you learn how to be insecure\nright so and this is the challenge and\nsecure or secure sorry secure so\nokay um\nyou know and i think this is gonna be\ntough\nbut i think this is where you got to\nwork on the rigidity of your thinking\nokay so like if your mind is telling you\nsomething and it's telling you this is\ntrue this is true this is true this is\ntrue\nthere's a general capacity to be less\nrigid with your thinking and be more\nflexible\nso i know this is this is i i say this\nnot entirely i say this with judgment\nokay so like if you can learn how to\nlove a jewish person you will be no\nlonger insecure\nso i didn't really want to get into this\nbut i don't hate\nthe jews i just hate jews\nmaybe i mean it the other way i don't\nhate jews i hate the jews individually i\nhave no opinion on them okay sure so i\nget what you're saying i get what you're\nsaying if i can overcome something that\ni have made my mind up on exactly so\nthat's why it doesn't have to be the\nanti-semitism right that's me taking a\nsucker punch at you so i apologize for\nthat that's fair totally fair i knew i\nhad it coming so yeah now that we've\ndone it\nwe're good right\nso the other thing is i would say that\nyou've made other statements i keep on\nharping on that because maybe that\nstatement did bother me so i should have\ni should have processed those emotions a\nlittle bit better but um and maybe you\ndid detect disgust i'm sort of\nreflecting now\nbut i i think that uh\nwhat i would say is that there are\nseveral things that you said today where\nyou're like that's the way that i am\nright and i think flexibility around any\none of those things basically\ntraining yourself to be cognitively\nflexible i think is the most important\nthing that you need to learn\nbecause i do think i mean it's not hard\nto figure out what you should do in your\nlife i think like to summarize like so\nhere's what i'd say anthony first of all\nwhat you should your purpose in life\nright now is to [ __ ] live it because\nyou haven't had a chance\nso i'd say if you enjoy playing video\ngames play video games go and seek as\nmany experiences as you can because like\ngo eat burgers you know study computer\nprogramming be at the top of your class\nlike get a [ __ ] award with the day\nthat you graduate you know like be on\nthe honors list\ndo the things that kids normally go to\ntheir parents and are proud of\nand then like you know do the things\nthat make your parents brag about you\nand then you're not gonna have any\nparents to brag about you and you're\ngonna do that thing and you're gonna\nfeel devastated and alone and [ __ ]\nfeel that [ __ ] too\nand then pity yourself and let other\npeople pity you and let other people\nhave compassion towards you\nand let go of your like you know\ni i don't know there's some strength in\nthere which is like a strength of\nsurvival and let go of that let yourself\nbe weak\nyou know like feel all of those things\nand have someone to share that with\nand start to date and start to play\nvideo games and go for walks you're in\nthe mountains fantastic build shelves\nlike build your house get a dog\ndo all of the things that life has not\nlet you do\nand in terms of who you are read think\nwrite\nstudy\nand then you say that's going to be hard\nbecause i have no one to talk with which\nis exactly right so i don't know this is\nwhere practically like you have to find\npeople you have to recognize that as you\nenter into places with people there's\ngoing to be this tsunami of feelings\nthat arises\ninsecurity what are they going to think\nwhat do i have to say how do i get them\nto like me but you're not going for them\nto like you you're just going to get\nfood for your mind\nbecause the rigid thinking especially on\npolitics and stuff if you're on the\ninternet like you're never going to get\na contrary opinion or you're going to\ndiscount a contrary opinion you know\nlike whatever\nso just go and like i don't know where\nyou engage with people so i'd say that\nyou know sometimes there are like\ndifferent kinds of classes and stuff\nlike um you know even i it sounds like\nyou're in school online i assume because\nof covet and you're living in the\nmountains right\nright\nso so this is where i don't know where\nyour school is and and you know whether\nit's a local university but it's online\nclasses yes or in person classes i could\ntake so not just in person classes i\nwould look at in-person extracurriculars\nand you are going to feel like a weirdo\nbecause it's going to be a bunch of 18\n19 year old kids\nand you're going to be a 41 year old\nex-con with tattoos\nright\nbut like that carries a certain like\ngravitas and respect\nthey're all children and you're a man\nyou know you may not feel like it on the\ninside but it's kind of scary and with\nyour resting [ __ ] face you know because\nyour smile like really lights up your\nface\nit does wonders for it right you've got\na beautiful smile and and and so i think\neven when you see it there's like\nmischievous in like there's\nmischievousness right there's\nplayfulness there there's excitement\nand so i think all of those things you\nactually have to give too is the resting\n[ __ ] face terrifying absolutely are you\n[ __ ] xcon with tattoos like\nabsolutely but the moment you smile it\nall comes falling apart\nand even to be able to smile like that\nanthony that's what you've missed man\nyou know i want to see i want to say\nthat your goal should be having that\nmischievous smile\nevery day\nhave a conversation with someone play a\ntrick on them you know pour some ice\nwater down their back like do whatever\nit is that like you haven't gotten to do\nhave conversations with people and i'd\nsay if you want like a compass\ntry to go as close as you can to the\nperson that you were in the way you\ninteracted people when you hitchhiked\nright because i think that that's\nthere's something about\nacknowledging that you may not deserve\nmuch but you're gonna give people a\nchance to give you something anyway\nand what i'm really seeing right now is\nthat once again you're holding yourself\nback you're not giving people a chance\nto care about you\nall you do is you put up facades that\nare guaranteed to get their respect and\nenjoyment you're not giving people a\nchance\nyou're tricking them into engaging into\na false relationship with you\nso go and do stuff i'd say go see a\nmedical doctor if you if you don't have\none you know get yourself checked out\nespecially in terms of the sexuality\nstuff there's some medical conditions\nlike for example low testosterone\nproduction can lead to decreased libido\npart of the reason i was asking you\nabout the leg muscles and the leg injury\nis because the largest source of\nendogenous testosterone in from the male\nbody comes from actually the quadriceps\nmuscles so people that i work with have\nlow uh testosterone like i'll tell them\nto do like squats\nlike if you want to you know\nget horny again do squats it's kind of\ninteresting\nso it's a very endogenous kind of source\nof testosterone there are other things\nin terms of sexuality like just you know\nthe brain you know the body kind of like\nyou know\nputs things on standby if they're not\nlike regularly used right so for 20\nyears while you're in prison we don't\nknow what your sexual activity is like\ni'm not gonna ask zero but zero you know\nso your your body's like hey we don't\nneed this thing so let's like shut it\ndown for now and you'll be surprised\nit'll come back so i do think in terms\nof hope by the way\ni do think that everything that i'm\nhearing you have a lot of handicaps but\ni don't think you're like the boy who\nwas raised by wolves\nright i don't think you missed\ndevelopmental milestones in such a\ncrucial way to where you won't be able\nto engage in these things and this\nconversation really reassures me because\nyou seem like a quite a relatable guy\nlike you seem like a good dude\nright you're very in tune with facial\nexpressions you're very sensitive to\ndifferent kinds of judgment you're\nbetter at detecting my sensitive my\ndisapproval than i am and i'm pretty\n[ __ ] good at detecting myself that\nmeans you're an absolute beast and we\nsee this in people who are raised in\ntraumatic households because you have\nit's a survival for you you have to be\nable to read your mom's facial\nexpressions\nright like whether you're gonna get hit\nthat day or not like you need to know\nso be careful because you're going to be\ninterpreting a lot of information that\npeople themselves are not going to be\naware of\nso you you will see dislike in people's\nfaces that they're not even aware of and\nmay not even\nbecause i definitely see the facial\nexpressions and it's like it's like\noh i see where this is leading let me go\nahead and exit with some grace while i\nstill can exactly and this is the thing\nthough i know it sounds kind of crazy\nbut\nthey're only there's only a 20 chance\nit's going to go where you think it's\ngoing to go\nbecause the other thing about your brain\nand there's been overwhelming research\nabout this is that your brain is also\nespecially tuned to negative facial\nexpressions\nsure absolutely\nso you're gonna miss\nall of the positive facial expressions\nand you're gonna amplify all of the\nnegative ones which is in turn gonna\nreinforce your insecurity\nis going to cause you to stack the deck\nin your favor\nand will set you up for a relationship\non false pretenses which is going to\nwind up in the friend zone\nand i fear that i have women flirt with\nme and i have literally no idea they're\ndoing it i i fear that does happen and i\nwould have no way of knowing yep\ni i believe it\nyou know so\ni think very practically anthony i think\nthe first thing is to understand\nyourself and understand your rigidity\nand try to engage in a little bit of\ncognitive flexibility\nreally start to question what does that\nmean practically it means question your\nconclusions because like you said you\nsee where this is going hold on a second\nlet's actually play the tape through to\nthe end because when i ask you i forgot\nwhat question i asked you about oh yeah\nwhat are you afraid that you know why\nare you reassured that we're never going\nto meet again what is the judgment that\nyou're afraid i'm making and like it\ndoesn't there isn't one\nright so it's actually there's this\nreally tricky thing going on where like\nyour insecurity is like shaping your\nthoughts and it feels logical to you\nand it feels like oh this has happened a\nthousand times before so i know i'm\nright\nbut like it's all like if you kind of\nit's going to be smoke and mirrors it's\ngoing to be a mirage i'm like pretty\nsure about this stuff\nthat most of the problems that you see\nare going to be mirages when closely\nexamined your insecurity is going to be\na mirage or there'll be some truth to it\nlike there's some good reason you know\ni'm missing a shannon i'm an ex-con i'm\n41 years old you know i may not be the\nthe you know the highest what most women\nare looking for\nright so there's some truth to that we\njust have to acknowledge that but i\nthink that don't let those things define\nwho you are because you're so much more\nthan that\nnow\nyou mentioned that\nyou imagine it might be hard for me to\nimagine myself as an adult inside what\nmade you say that because that's very\ntrue i tell people i don't even know\nwhat i want to be when i grow up and i\ni'm only half joking when i say that um\nwhat what what brought you to that\nconclusion because that's exactly how i\nfeel\nso the first is that you weren't shown\nhow to be an adult\nso you don't know what it looks like\nright\nand then the second thing is that you've\nmissed a lot of the developmental\nmilestones that people\nlike that help people become adults\noh yeah that's true i get what you're\nsaying yeah you go to the weddings you\ndo the whole thing the girl you go to\nprom\nor you ask a girl out for prom and she\nsays no\nyou ask a girl out freshman year and she\nsays no\nyeah ask a girl out fresh sophomore year\nand she says yes\nthat's how you grow up you you graduate\nfrom college you get a college degree\nyou know you get your first job\nyou have a career\nand then you're like adulting\nyou like talk with friends of yours and\nthis is your it's gonna be uh uphill\nbattle okay anthony i hate to break it\nto you but like there's also like you\nknow when you're 21 years old and you're\nlike late night hanging out with your\nfriends and you have a conversation\nabout i don't know if i want to be an\nelectrical engineer\ni really love art and then you have a\nconversation about that and your friends\nare like then you should do art and then\nyou wake up the next day and you realize\nhow stupid it is to not be an electrical\nengineer and you try to have a\nconversation with your parents like\nthat's idiotic and then you decide to\nbecome an electrical engineer that's how\nyou grow up because you kill a tiny part\nof your childlike self on the inside\nyou know\nand so i think all those things so i\nthink it's a lack of modeling\nand then also like you just haven't gone\nthrough the developmental milestones the\ngood news is that\ngenerally speaking data i don't know\nabout data but i guess i'm just making a\nconclusion it's been my experience that\nmissed milestones you can catch up on\nvery quickly\nso i would not be surprised if four\nyears from now you felt like a 45 year\nold and you were doing most of the\nthings that a 45 year old is doing\nsure\ndo you think it's possible i only want\nfriends and a girlfriend because that's\nwhat is expected by society is to have\nfriends and a girlfriend to be normal\nyes absolutely i think that's half your\nproblem\nis that you're trying to do\nnormal yep is you're trying to do what\nyou think you should be doing instead of\nactually doing what feels right to you\nso why do you want the eight instead of\nthe three it's because\nthe eight other people would be\nimpressed that i have\nbut you may actually you may genuinely\nif you got the eight to marry you and\nyou got the three to marry you\ni'm not convinced that you would be\ngenuinely happier with the eight because\ni don't think that physically more\ninsecure if anything right\ncase in point right you're the one who's\ntelling me it's a bad idea so like\ninstead gravitate towards what is\nauthentically you but the problem is\nyou've been weeding that [ __ ] out for so\nlong you don't even know what that is\nright right\nright so i don't know who i am yeah well\nbut so here's the thing so you get\nthere's there's a there's a trick you\ncan play\nso as you observe your thoughts and as\nyou begin to realize\nthat\ni want this eight because people will be\nimpressed then you know you should move\nin a different direction\nif i'm doing it for external motivations\nokay that's that's great that's really\ngood inside that's great right so then\nbe like okay hold on a second what do i\nactually want this is what i would feel\nsecure with because everything in your\nbrain understand this anthony when\nyou've had trauma like yours\neverything in your brain is wired not\nfor happiness it's wired for safety and\nsecurity\nwhat have you never had [ __ ] safety\nand security\never right right so like everything\nyou're going to be doing is going to be\nthe safe route computer programming like\nthat's a safe pick\nwell i figured future proof right that's\nexactly the logic that went into it what\nis the most future proof job i could\npick that i would be capable of doing\nand that a felony would\nnot hamper as much you're absolutely\nright you're right so it's it's all\nsafety and security and like safety and\nsecurity is important don't get me wrong\ni think it's it's a good choice but at\nthe end of the day if that's where\nyou're moving towards in your cognitive\nthought process move the other way\nlike i i can almost guarantee you that\nif you start meeting women and stuff\nyou're going to meet a woman who is\nabsolutely amazing and would be a\nwonderful partner and she's going to be\nless attractive than what you would want\nand really like look at yourself in that\nmoment examine that rigidity\nyou know and it's not about security or\nany of that crap to be honest it's just\nlike do i enjoy spending time with this\nperson do i enjoy having a conversation\nwith this person that's what's important\ni mean 25 years from now like everyone's\ngonna be ugly anyway\nso it's you know what\nthat's what i got some stuff right there\nthat's what i got for you\nthat's much appreciated i i think that's\nsome good insights um\ni think\ni i really i i don't know how like\ni just i really wonder if i wouldn't\njust be happier alone like maybe that's\nwhat i really want and the only reason i\nwant other people okay i would like to\nhave a sounding board you're absolutely\nright about that when you say somebody\nyou could just talk at in the guise of\nconversation that does sound phenomenal\num\nand honestly somebody to share life's\ntriumphs and things like that with right\nand and and that would be great to have\num\nbut like\nalso it terrifies me the thought of\nhaving to\nthe rigidity you're 100 right about the\nrigidity because it's like i have a set\nway of doing things i have and this is\nhow i think of it i have a set schedule\nof when i clean the house on sundays\nsundays when i do laundry sundays you\nknow i mean like i have a very rigid\nschedule and i think a lot of that is is\nis prison\nyeah i mean\nit's a rigid schedule in there you eat\nwhen told to eat what you're told to eat\nand how you're told to eat it and so you\nyou kind of you begin to find comfort in\nthe routine i began to find comfort in\nthe routine and\ni was literally the only thing that kept\nme going day to day is the routine one\nmeal to the next one meal to the next\nand then wake up made one meal to the\nnext and so i think that that's that's\num\nyeah i think that that rigidity\novercoming that rigidity and sharing my\nlife and letting somebody into my\nintimate space would be difficult for me\nyeah so\nbaby steps\nright\nso here's what i'd say anthony to sum\nyou up your problem is not one of\nlearning what you want to do it's about\nunlearning\nthe second thing is you you may be right\nthat you may at the end of the day be\nhappier alone but you don't get to make\nthat choice until you've tried\ntried\ndude you have to live [ __ ] life\nand living life means making mistakes to\nfigure out what your life looks like\nthank you for that because i think that\nwas just giving up saying that i think\nthat was just talking myself into giving\nup so thank you you may be right but you\ndon't get to make that decision yet\nuntil you've tested the alternative\nhypothesis right and it's turned out to\nbe a train wreck after train wreck after\ntrain wreck if you want to grow up to be\nan adult you have to have as\nyou have to have a string of bad\nrelationships in your teenage years and\nearly 20s\nit's part of the process\nyou know\nso i'd say like if you're not\nentirely ready yet like slow steps you\ndon't have to open up completely but i'd\nreign in some of that stuff\nabout you know trying to impress people\nand like you're a genuinely good dude\nyou don't have to fake it\nyou know\nso just let let that authentically show\ndo you think that professional therapy\nwould be advisable or not absolutely\nis it necessary\nis it necessary\ndo you sense something in there me that\nthat is off\nno granted it's only been two hours i\nknow so let me let me explain let me\nexplain to you anthony this is very\nimportant to understand\ni i would strongly recommend\nprofessional therapy to you not because\nsomething is broken because you're so\ncerebral and you would get so much out\nof it\nis a bunch within you broken yeah man\nit's like\na hurricane went through your internal\nself\nbut that's not the reason i'm\nrecommending therapy i'm recommending\ntherapy because you are really good at\nhaving conversations and boy if someone\ndevoted one hour a week to helping you\nunderstand yourself you would learn so\nmuch\nit's not about fixing something\nit's about like think about this for a\nsecond you could spend one hour a week\nhaving someone reflect on your\ninterpersonal journey\nhelping you discover who you are\nwhat holds you back how does all this\nprogramming get laid down\nyou know what's what software and what's\nhardware all of these questions i think\nyou can\ndo in therapy that's why you should do\nit because you'd love it\nnot because you need it\nwill will it help you practically i\nthink so like especially with insecurity\nand emotional you know that kind of\nstuff like\nbut yeah and i'd say you know in terms\nof resources and stuff i don't know\nexactly what your financial situation is\nlike but you know if you're a student\noftentimes they have discounted or\navailable resources depending on\nyou know what\ntheir ways to get it you can kind of\ngoogle search\nyou know for community mental health\ncenter and oftentimes they can help you\nin some way they can even like help you\nget on insurance if your financial\nsituation is like below a certain level\nlike you can basically get insurance to\nget therapy\num\nbut i would absolutely recommend it i\nthink\ni mean if you find a decent therapist\nthat fits well with you\ni think uh you know it doesn't\ni think the thing you got to be careful\nabout is like some therapists may over\npathologize you\nso they may like think like oh my god\nlike anthony's like such a oh he's like\nsuch a poor traumatized little baby and\nthere may be a part of you that really\nwants that compassion because you\ndeserve it right there's a part of you\nthat it's going to piss you off\nit would yeah it would it would be very\nawkward right it would be very like pity\nis very uncomfortable for me as was\ncompel actually i i don't know the\ndifference between compassion and pity\nto be honest with you and so i don't\nfeel the difference that you're\nabsolutely right it's very shameful for\nme to get compassion very shameful yeah\nso here's the difference so pity\noftentimes comes at the cost of respect\nright so what you really need is a\ntherapist who can recognize that you've\nhad a bunch of [ __ ] happen to you but\nthat you are not like a victim\nlike you are a victim\nbut like\nlet me say it this way you have been\nvictimized but you are not a victim i\ndon't feel like i'm talking to a victim\ni feel like i'm talking to a survivor\nand that degree of respect i think is\ngoing to be very important to you and\nyou have to be patient with therapists\nbecause when they hear about your life\nwhat they're going to see is a victim\nand as you overcome your ego and your\nrigidity you will allow yourself to\nbecome a victim too\nand you will say actually it's okay for\npeople to pity me it doesn't mean that\ni'm a weak person\nbut that's\nthat's going to take time my friend\nand you know i want to thank you for\nthis time dr k you know one of the\nthings i like about you i i just i don't\nknow if i've heard this word before but\nyou don't over pathologize people um\ni've watched a lot of your previous\nsessions i really resonated with the\ngifted group and i hope you get to have\na follow-up session with them i thought\nthat was an amazing session i would love\nto see it again um but\nas\nyou don't just jump straight to well i\nsee that you're suffering from bipolar\nyou know you know all these\nself-diagnosis that people lay on\nthemselves that's you don't indulge in\nany of that you say let's be let's have\ncommon sense and here's some very\npractical you know easily applicable\nthings that you can that you can put\ninto your life and that's what i really\nlike about your style and that's why i\nwanted to come on here so thank you so\nmuch for the experience i really got a\nlot out of it um\ni don't know if you ever want to talk\nagain you guys have my contact\ninformation sure um but thank you again\nso much thank you to chat for the\nsupport\num\nyou you've been awesome it's been a\ngreat experience thank you so much yeah\nthank you so much for coming on anthony\nthank you for sharing thank you for\nbeing authentic\nand to a certain degree vulnerable\ni i think um\nyou know i know that there's some mental\nprotections in terms of not seeing us\nagain but i think what you're doing is\nawesome\ni think that this is the story that\nyou're sharing is one that not enough\npeople share\nbecause the truth is that there are a\nlot of people out there who are like you\nand that you know ex-cons are not people\nthat\nshould be relegated to menial labor for\nthe rest of their life\nyou know many of them are talented and\ngifted and and dormant\ni'll toss that word out again i think\nyou're just dude you're just like\nyou're just waking up\ngive yourself time but you'll be amazed\nat what you can accomplish\nso thanks for coming on and good luck\nthanks doctor okay you have a great one\num just uh\ni can't teach meditation today because\nwe're about 20 minutes over but\notherwise um i would highly recommend i\nthink you should get an access code if\nyou don't have one already just because\nyou're a guest to the stream but i would\ndefinitely recommend the meditations in\nthe atman\nof dr k's guide to mental health\num\nso we'll we'll send you that but uh i'm\nsorry i can't teach you meditation today\njust because we're kind of ran over best\nof luck seriously anthony like i'm\nrooting for you man appreciate you\ni appreciate you guys yeah take care\nthanks you too bye now\nokay chat we are over time gg\noh that was interesting\num anthony's fantastic\nright it's so interesting\nso here are a couple of takeaways i\ndon't know if y'all if i need to say\nthis but\nso too often\nour identities get dominated by\nparticular events in our life right i am\na failure versus i fail to test i am a\nconvicted felon versus i committed a\nfelony and you know served a prison\nsentence\nand so\num\nand sometimes lsd is amazing\nso i think i think if we want to talk\nabout lsd for a second i think it just\nspeaks to the the potential therapeutic\nvalue of psychedelic substances which\nare being studied just a reminder i\ndon't know if you all know this but like\nyou know people will have bad outcomes\nfrom lsd too people will like develop\nanxiety and panic attacks and ptsd and\nall kinds of stuff so i don't recommend\nthat people use it\nat least until it gets sort of kind of\nverified through clinical trials we try\nto stay as evidence-based as we can in\nterms of our recommendations here\nbut we do also offer a lot of\nnon-evidence-based recommendations to be\nfair so in terms of lsd you know i'd say\nbe careful\nbut i i think you know for all of y'all\nthe thing that really shocked me about\nanthony is how relatable he is right\nbecause when we think about these labels\nright someone who like you know\ncommitted murder at the age of 16 it\nsounds like\nand went to prison for 20 some odd years\nlike we don't think about someone who's\nso relatable but i think part of why i\nlove doing this work is because we're\nall human and the experiences that we\nshare are like surprisingly similar\nand so a lot of the stuff that he's\ndealing with i think is very common in\nour community about this whole business\nof friend zone and being insecure and\nlike doing things for people and then\nfeeling resentful because you've\ninvested so much and they haven't given\nyou anything because you were and then\nyou feel that entitlement and then you\nstart to feel like constantly rejected\nand and it kind of changes the way that\nyou think so be super careful about your\nrigid thinking i think part of what\nholds us back in general is our very\nrigid thinking and anthony's a smart guy\nso clearly he's like super high iq is\ncapable of a lot\num and and you know he's just\nanother key kind of takeaway is that\na lot of what holds us back a lot of\nlike growing and learning is not so much\nas actually not about learning it's\nabout unlearning\nthat usually what human beings do is\nwe'll develop adaptations to our\ncircumstances and those help us survive\nparticular periods and then growing as a\nperson involves letting go of those\nadaptations and actually trying\nsomething different it's letting go of\nthe strategy that works\nyou know if i kind of think about a\nvideo game analogy it's sort of like you\ncan get away with something in like low\nlevel games right you can be like a one\ntrick pony and like zerg rush\nyour opponents like six pool people\npeople even know what that means\nyou know you can do like some kind of\ncheese strat when you're in bronze\nleague but as you ascend through the\nranks like you can't keep using that\ncheese strat over and over and over\nagain you actually have to unlearn\nthings and start to come up with\ndifferent strategies as you rise through\nthe ranks\nand so if you feel stuck like i'm\nconcerned that if anthony doesn't\nunlearn what he's had to\nlearn to survive he will stay stuck\nright another six years will go by he\nwon't be in a relationship\nand so if you all are feeling stuck in\nlife it's not so much that you're you\nknow bad at something or you're a\nfailure or you're lazy or dis\nundisciplined that's all unactionable\ninformation so let go of that crap\ninstead what you need to be asking\nyourself is like how did i learn to do\nthe things that i do\nyou know when did i how did i benefit\nfrom playing video games 24 7. and you\nmay say to yourself oh i didn't benefit\nat all it's all a waste that's when your\nyour thinking needs to be better you\nneed to be a little bit more clinical a\nlittle bit more scientific\nrecognize that playing video games all\nday long protects you from all kinds of\nstuff\nyou don't have to feel shame while\nyou're playing a game\nwhen you have a 60 minute game of dota\nand you come back at the last second\nagainst medi mega creeps\nyou get to feel like the best thing on\nearth\nand what else in your life gives you\nthat feeling what else in your life\ngives you a feeling of absolute triumph\nand dominance\nright when you don't have access to\nthose feelings in the rest of your life\nthat's why you play the game\nit does things for you that you aren't\nable to do in your regular life so you\nmay think that all of the things that\nhold you back are negatives which you\nneed to understand is that all of those\nthings are actually positives they're\nnot problems they're solutions\nand moving forward actually\nis about undoing solutions that have\ngotten us to where we are"
