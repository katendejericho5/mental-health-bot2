    "transcript": "good at side quests but bad at the main\nquest\nokay hello all basically as the title\nsays i'm good at completing the\nnecessary daily mundane chores and\nactually don't mind doing them things\nlike the dishes cleaning outdoor work\ntaking care of small errands here and\nthere and i'm quite bad at moving\nforward with the main quests of life\nfinancial independence relationships a\nplan for the future and i'm 25 and\nliving with my parents while unemployed\nand feel quite a bit of shame about it i\nhave a university degree in classical\ncivilizations which i love but haven't\nfound a job using the skills i've\nlearned\ni went to school because i was\npassionate about the field but never\nonce took into consideration what was\ngoing to happen after i graduated\ni have many interests and i spend a lot\nand i spend my days engaging in in these\nhobbies but it has occurred to me lately\nthat i need to get going and on on a\nlife path or something\nto my detriment now i tend to be very\ngood at idling spending a good chunk of\nmy day doing leisurely activities like\nwalking through the woods near my house\nor reading at the park under the sun\nnot that these things are bad but i\nprobably spend too much time doing them\nas opposed to doing things that are more\nobviously productive as far as having a\ngoal to move towards\ni apply for jobs almost every day but\nthese are mostly dead end jobs that have\nnothing to do with the things that i'm\ninterested in i think it's time to stop\ni stopped doing that i guess my issue is\nthat i'm not good at breaking down the\nmain quest in the smaller chunks because\nit feels like it's never enough\nmaybe someone here could relate\nsomeone's like yeah i want to be friends\nwith this guy absolutely\nokay\nso this is a fantastic post and my\nanswer is going to be kind of weird okay\nso the first thing is that i think\nyou've discovered your main quest it's\njust your main quest happens to be other\npeople's side quests\nokay so this is what i'm hearing from\nthis person's life first of all there\nisn't a whole lot wrong\nit just doesn't fit\nwhat people perceive to be like what\nlife is supposed to be\ndo you all get that\nit's not like this person is like\nsuffering it's just like they're\ninterested in stuff they like have a\nhealthy work-life balance because they\nhave no work\nand they're actually really good at\nexecuting on small tasks and it doesn't\nbother them to do that and they tend to\nbe like philosophical in thinking right\nso i love this line in particular\nit's uh\num\nwhere is it oh yeah\ni have many interests i spend my it\noccurred it has occurred to me lately\nthat i need to get going on a life path\nor something i love this sentence\nbecause here's what i'm envisioning\nhere's this person who studies classical\ncivilizations in university who's going\nfor a walk in the woods and is kind of\nlike\nperhaps i should start living life and\nget a job\nright so i think this is actually\nawesome this is who you are okay so\nyou're contemplative\nright like you're a thinker\nyou're like\nlike you like to take life slow and you\ntend to be like detail-oriented\nthis sounds very okay so\ndr k is going to go to pseudoscience\nayurveda astrology whatever for a second\nsounds really guppa right like hard to\nchange\nnot really too ambitious\npretty detail-oriented can kind of get\nthings done\nis like very like earth element okay\nso i'd be curious whether this person is\nphysically kapha\nbut seems very mentally\nguffa y'all get that like no ambition\nbut like nothing's wrong i'm just kind\nof chilling just chilling so the first\nthing is that so i i make two concrete\nrecommendations please god become a\npersonal assistant or executive\nassistant please stop looking for dead\nend jobs\nso i don't know if you guys know this\nbut like good executive assistants can\nget paid like six figure salaries like\ni've i've known some executive\nassistants that will get like 250 300k a\nyear\nso it's a very very valuable like skill\ngrossly underestimated like in the\nmarket\nso becoming a personal assistant or\nexecutive assistant you can make like\ndepending on you know where if you're\nanswering a facebook ad for someone who\nwants to pay you like two dollars an\nhour like that's gonna suck\nbut i don't know exactly how these\npeople become executive assistants i\ndon't know like how they got there\nand i've even asked a couple of times\nbut it seems like there isn't like a\nformal process to it it's sort of like\nyou're good at detail-oriented stuff\nsomeone who has a pile of money\nrecognizes that they're bad at this crap\nand you're good at this crap and they're\nlike hey can i pay you 50k a year to\nmake sure that\nmy registration sticker is updated in my\nin my car so i don't get like\npulled over in my car impounded because\ni have this crap to do\nso if you're looking for a job i would\nstrongly strongly look for like\nhigh-value personal assistance and\nexecutive assistants and like help\npeople who have more money than you do\nand don't have the time to do all the\nlittle crap that\nyou are good at like just do it for them\nand it'll be like a good exchange for\neveryone involved\nso i think you'd be very well suited to\nthat kind of job\nso second thing is\nrecognize that like in your life what i\nwould envision for you i have no idea if\nthis is possible or not it's like you're\nan executive assistant to someone making\nlike 80k a year okay so you take care of\ncrap during the day that they need to\ntake care of\nbut it's like\nthey're going to give you a list of\nthings and you're going to kind of take\ncare of it your leisure and the rest of\nthe time you're just going to be like\nthinking right because you're going to\nlike go do things like pick up their dry\ncleaning\nand so you're going to like go pick up\ntheir dry cleaning and on the drive\nthere you're going to be thinking about\nclassical civilizations like you do so\ni'd encourage you to like carry a\nnotebook and start to like write or do\nsomething because you've got something\nin there that's philosophical and\ncontemplative and needs to come out in\nsome way\nand so essentially you want to like pay\nyour bills being someone's like personal\nassistant or executive assistant\nand while you're doing that just let\nyour mind slowly like nurture and grow\nwhatever the kind of contemplative crap\nyou want to do is\nbut your skill set and your degree can\nbe completely independent okay\nlike even if you look at me like i'm a\ntwitch streamer\nmy degree is in medicine those are not i\ndon't this isn't even medical care like\nwhat we're doing right now is not\nmedical care\nmy skill set my degree are different\nand so a lot of what i see in our\ncommunity is people are so hung up\non\nthe traditional road of life that they\ndon't realize\nthat like your side quest is your main\nquest\nif you're just good at doing random\ntasks for like\nand it's easy for you and it's so hard\nfor our vata-esque adhd no one can get\ntheir crap done on time\nand you can do it for them like some\npeople will pay you\npiles of money to do it\nso that's what i think you should do for\na job i don't usually give advice but\ni'd say for this person it's the first\nthing that popped into my head and then\nover time like continue to cultivate\nwhatever it is that you actually find\ninteresting and i'd say take that\ninterest and start creating with it and\nwhat i mean by creating is like\nliterally produce something so like\nstart journaling\nwrite things down\ntype up stuff in a word document just\ncapture your thoughts and put them out\ninto the world in some way they don't\nhave to be read by anyone i don't mean\nlike you can start a blog if you want to\nbut take all the things that you're\ninterested in this is probably the\nbiggest problem with our community is\nthat\nthey don't recognize that we're we are\nall actually pretty smart\nand that our thoughts have value but in\norder for our thoughts to have value we\nhave to translate them into some medium\nthat can be helpful to another human\nbeing\nit's that translation into a separate\nmedium that our community really falls\napart at right you may have a great\ntaste in music but at some point you've\ngot to like make it\nat some point like you may know a lot\nabout dota\nbut at some point like like it doesn't\nhave to you don't have to write a blog\nlike just start a youtube channel just\nstart creating we've had so many\ncreators that we've interviewed and we\nasked them like how did you start and\nthey just like i just started and it was\nsmall and insignificant for a while\nright and then like 10 years later they\nhave like 8 million followers\nso\nanyway for this person you know my heart\ngoes out to you but i i think that like\ndon't adopt a main quest just because\nother people are adopting it the whole\npoint of the main quest is that it's\nlike spawn specific right your main\nquest is different from other people's\nmain quests and i think you've got\nparticular skills that are highly valued\nyou just have to figure out how to\nmarket them which is it's it's a big ask\nyou can't just show off someone\nsomewhere and be like pay me 60k to be\nyour for a year you know like you\ncan't that people aren't going to take\nthat but\nat the same time like these tasks can be\nvery very valuable like what you're good\nat and what you excel at can be really\nvaluable to some people i just don't\nknow how you find them but i'd start\nthere so i look for like openings for\npersonal assistance and just keep on the\nlookout because someone will pay a lot"
