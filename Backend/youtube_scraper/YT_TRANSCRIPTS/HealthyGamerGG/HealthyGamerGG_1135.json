    "transcript": "so we're trying something a little bit\nnew this week at healthy gamer um so a\nlot of people like thousands of people\nhave expressed interest or curiosity\nabout becoming coaches um i also know\nthat a ton of people in our community\nare really interested in like\nunderstanding motivation\nso part of what we're going to be doing\ntoday is teaching our coaches like how\nto think about goal setting and\nmotivation we're going to be explaining\nsome principles of psychology and\nneuroscience and things like that and i\nthink actually it can be useful for\npeople in our community to kind of like\nlearn this stuff on their own\num\na one or two interesting kind of points\nto remember the first is that this is\nnot really geared towards a diy\nperspective right so this is a training\nthat we do for our coaches so they can\nhelp other people do it so um that\nperspective may be a little bit\ndifferent so a lot of people had\nquestions yesterday about like can i do\nthis myself how do i do this by myself\num there are certainly ways of doing\nthat but that's not quite the focus so\nwe're still going to share all the\nprinciples because we think those are\nuseful but especially today for example\nwe're going to share some of the\nmechanisms through which behavioral\nchange happens in a neuroscience from a\nneuroscience perspective and so some of\nthose mechanisms are specifically\nthey specifically inform how we've\ndesigned our coaching program so our\ncoaching program is sort of designed to\ntake advantage of some of these things\nwhich it may be harder for you to\nimplement kind of on your own but you\ncan absolutely sort of still benefit\nfrom them now we get to the four types\nof intent\nor the four dimensions of intent\nso when when someone says i have a goal\ni\nwhat are the four things that could be\ndriving this person like why do people\npick goals\nlike outside pressure like like family\nor a society or something\nokay so pressure excellent\nsociety\nfamily what else\nvalues\nuh what do you mean by that\num it's like something they care about\nokay\nso when someone feels pressured\nand they say\nthey they're saying that i have to\naccomplish this goal what is the verb\nthat they\nuse\ni know it's kind of a weird\nokay good excellent what else do they\nsay\nshould\nabsolutely\nokay\nso what else goes into\nyou know why someone does something\nit's their duty\nokay\nso duty so what do they what's the word\nthat they use there so care about is a\ngood example of a value\nwhat's the\nworst responsibility absolutely\nright\nor obligation\nso do you guys see how like these are\ndifferent things what i n what i should\ndo is different from and we'll get to\nshould and an obligation in a second\nbecause you could say that your duty is\nwhat you should do\num and i'd say the key well let's just\ntalk about it now so i think the big\ndifference is like the duty is like owed\nto someone else\nand there are all kinds of things that\nyou should do that you don't owe to\nsomeone else does that make sense\nlike i should eat healthier but that's\nnot like a duty it's just\ni should eat healthier because society\nyou know judges me because of my body\ntype and if i don't want to be poorly\njudged by society or my family makes fun\nof me for being like overweight or\nunderweight or whatever\nlike that's that's a should but it's not\nsomething that i owe someone so you can\nuse the word should for duty but this is\nexactly the point of like having this\ndiscussion because these are actually\ndifferent internal drives that share the\nsame language and so when people use\nunsophisticated language they don't\ndiagnose the problem correctly like i'm\nsick\nso as a doctor it's like sick with what\nright like there isn't medicine for\nsickness\nthere are treatments for diseases and we\nneed specificity of our language to\nfigure out where the problem is so that\nwe can fix it\nthere's one big bucket that we're\nmissing\nwhat desire or what yeah perfect desires\nright\nthis has nothing to do with duty or\nobligation it's like sometimes you know\ndr k just needs a hot dog like that has\nnothing to do with you know what i\nshould be eating or or values or\nanything like that it's just like i\nsmell you know there's some korean\ncorn dog place that opened up sort of\nnear where i live there's always a line\nout the door i don't actually like\nreally want to eat it but sometimes when\ni walk by i get curious and i smell it\nand and so that's you know there are\ndesires right i want to play league\nbecause i want to school some noobs\nso if we kind of look at these\none of the things that i i kind of\nnotice is that some of these result in a\nloss for me like i have to give\nsomething up and some of these result in\na gain\nand then the other kind of dimension is\nthat some of these lead to like\nexternal\num what's the term i want to use here\nonce i figured out a good term\nyeah so external reward\nand internal reward\nokay\nso where do you all think desires go\nwhich quadrant would you put them in\nwhen i satisfy my desires do i gain\nsomething or do i lose something\ngain absolutely and do i gain an\ninternal reward or an external reward\nexternal\nyeah so this is where desires go so this\nis going to be kind of weird but like i\ndefine external reward as something that\nincludes a bodily satisfaction right\nit's like some kind of pleasure so let's\nthink a little bit about the things that\ni should do\nlike my family wants to become a doctor\nwhere does that go is that a gain or a\nloss\nfor me\nit's a loss\nyeah it's kind of weird so you gotta you\ngotta run with my system here okay\nit's not this isn't signed there's no\nohm's law for this dr k's impression\nlike i have to give something up that's\nthe way i kind of think about a loss\nright so i have to give up potentially\nlike my own happiness\nand what about internal reward or\nexternal reward what's the advantage of\ndoing things that i should do\nit's an external reward absolutely right\nso i want to be a professional video\ngamer but that's not a respectable\nprofession and i can't really hold my\nhead up high while i'm grinding like a\nprofessional video game but if i'm a\ndoctor and i put that on my tinder\nprofile that comes with a lot of\nprestige even though i hate myself on\nthe inside because you know i did\nsomething that i don't really want to do\nfor the wrong reasons\nso shoulds\ngo here\nwhere do values go\nbottom right\nabsolutely so walk me through that\num you're gaining\nsomething because you're doing it\nbecause you value it and it's also\ninternal to yourself\nas opposed to a hot dog\nyeah right so like when i when i do\nthings that i care about i usually get\nsomething out of it\nright so like if like let's say that i\nyou know i care about my children so i'm\ngonna take care of them when they're\nsick\nactually that may be a\nobligation we'll get get to that in a\nsecond but generally speaking things\nthat you care about in my experience\ntend to come to\num tend to come with some kind of gain\nlike you get some sort of like personal\nsatisfaction out of it and like the\nreward that you gain is not something\nthat is shown to the the external world\nthere's no prestige with it there may\nnot necessarily be like bodily enjoyment\nwith it so like a good example of this\nis let's say that i enjoy hiking and i\nclimb to the top of a mountain\ni i'm not it's like generally speaking\nlike does it cost me something sure like\nit requires effort right so doing things\nthat you care about sometimes require\neffort but it like feels good on the\ninside and you get to the top and\nthere's like a view and like you feel\nkind of like amazing so that's something\nlike doing things that you care about\nand so then our last bucket is duty kind\nof goes up here\nand so if we think about duty duty\nusually involves sacrifice right so it's\nlike a loss it's not something that\nnecessarily like i want to do for my\nsake it's an obligation or something\nthat i owe so it like costs me something\nbut it's very satisfying to do so for\nexample taking care of my kids when\nthey're sick like overnight\num is something that feels like\ninternally satisfying as a parent\nbecause like i know i'm being a good\nparent\nit's not something that i'm posting on\nsocial media or anything that i'm gonna\nlike get prestige or enjoyment out of\nand it actually costs me something right\nbecause i have to stay up all night and\nlike try to take care of them and all\nthat kind of good stuff\nso duty kind of goes up here does that\nmake sense\nso let me ask y'all when people kind of\ncome to you and they they come up with\ngoals and they say like oh i have these\ngoals what\nquadrant what quadrant or quadrants do\nyou think the average client that you\nall deal with is operating from\nshows her desires\nwhat do y'all think about\nthat\nagree with is that alan yeah i would say\nshould's\nright so\nso we've got two votes for shoulds\none vote for desire what about the\nrustial\nyeah\nokay i think should because if someone\nhad a desire they would be able to do it\nwithout a coach\nokay so when you think about their lives\nand the behaviors that they engage in\nwhat what do you think actually drives\nthem and like what shapes their behavior\neli\nso not just the things you asked me the\nquestion again yeah so you said that\nthey come to coaching and they i've\nalready satisfied their desires what\nthey need help with is the shoulds well\nvery well said so i'm going to ask you\nto dig a little bit deeper and for the\nthings that like most of what they\nactually do the behaviors that your\nclients engage in what do you think is\nthe driving force for what they're able\nto what they're doing without you\ngotcha um i'd say a lot of times desires\nlike if you take your corndog example\nmost people don't need a coach to go buy\na corn dog they have enough motive\nmotivation if you will by themselves to\ngo do that okay and so like i know this\nso this is going to be kind of actually\nforget the leading question so well said\nso i completely agree so in my\nexperience\nmost people operate from the left side\nof the quadrant and operating from the\nleft side of the quadrant can sometimes\nmake people happy but generally speaking\nlike what we're talking about is living\na life of external reward and then the\nother thing that tends to happen is like\nwhen you're living a life of external\nreward\nand it's kind of like loss oriented like\nthe loss of the should if if you're\nliving a life of external reward you\ncan't\nlike\nafford that loss i don't know how else\nto put it right so what i'd say is that\nwhen people actually move from this\nquadrant to this quadrant or this\nquadrant to this quadrant or this\nquadrant to this quadrant this is when\ntheir motivation starts to move in a\npositive direction they feel good about\nthemselves and they take control of\ntheir lives what do y'all think about\nthat\nthat's a that's a hypothesis or\nassertion that i'm putting forward which\nall can agree or disagree with\ndefinitely agree\nright so this is something that we also\nsee in addiction psychiatry so in\naddiction psychiatry people have a\npowerful biological driver\nthat is forcing them to use a substance\nright so biology doesn't even enter this\nlike this equation when you have biology\nentering it what we kind of go more\ntowards is like i'd say that biology is\nsort of maybe undesires right because\nthat's like reward circuitry and\ndopamine and stuff like that\nso this also maybe is like where youtube\nand gaming and stuff live\nand so when it when it comes to helping\nsomeone overcome an addiction like\nliterally the process that we try to do\nthere's a whole system of therapy called\nacceptance and commitment therapy which\nis sort of based on it's another one of\nthese like novel therapies that takes a\nsprinkling of eastern wisdom and then\npackages up in a western way and calls\nitself something new some interesting\ncultural appropriation going on there so\nact as an evidence-based treatment for\num\nis an evidence-based treatment for\naddictions\nand what the goal of act is is it sort\nof says that the more that you move\npeople into this quadrant the easier it\nis to overcome addictions\nand that's been my experience as well\nlike like people have to have a clear\nreason\nto make the sacrifice right like they\nhave to make the sacrifice or give up\nthe external reward and there has to be\nsomething i want you all to understand\nit's like any time we're talking about\nmotivation right there's a pro and a con\nin someone's brain there's a calculation\nthat's going on constantly should i do\nthis thing or should i not do this thing\nshould i eat the hot dog or should i not\neat the hot dog and what keeps people\nstuck is essentially like a conflict\nbetween two of these quadrants\nso i should do this\nbut i want to do this and then we feel\nparalyzed\nit's my duty to do this\nbut i want to do this\nright\ni want to do this but this is what i\ncare about\ni actually do genuinely care about like\nbeing healthy and i hate the way that i\nfeel when i like drink too much\nat the same time i want to get\nabsolutely hammered and go party and\nhave fun with my friends\nand so what keeps people stuck is\nactually like conflicts between these\ntwo\nthese different quadrants does that make\nsense\nso as a coach what our goal is is to\nhelp people essentially move from this\nside\nover here\nand how do y'all think we do that\nwhat's our methodology\ncreate awareness and understanding of\nwhat's going on\nabsolutely\nabsolutely that's that's the key thing\nawareness and understanding\nokay\nand that may sound kind of weird because\nlike wha how does awareness and\nunderstanding like actually create how\ndoes that drive behavior like once you\nclarify this stuff for people like how\ndoes that help them\nbecause when you can see\nlike the\ndriving forces behind these things it's\nmuch easier to understand them and then\nshift around your own personal values\nfor your choices absolutely right so i\nknow it sounds kind of weird but like\nyou know like when when our clients come\nin and they say like i have this goal\nand i should do it so like let's use the\nexample of like the student who doesn't\nfeel like studying\nright so like what is the student who\ndoesn't feel like studying like what do\nthey say to you\nlike what language you should study\nabsolutely\nright and then you ask them what makes\nit harder like why don't you study and\nwhat do they say\ni don't want to there you go there it is\nright it's that simple so they're stuck\nright here\nand so like the way that you help that\nclient like is by sort of clarifying\nlike their values right like so this is\nwhere you know when i work with clients\nwho are like that it's sort of thinking\nabout okay like what do you actually\ncare about why are you actually in\ncollege\nyou know why did you go here is it to\nfulfill a societal obligation is that\nwhy you went to college or is there\nsomething genuinely that you can come to\nappreciate about college is there\nanything that we can figure out here\nthat aligns with what you actually care\nabout because if you can help that\nperson uncover\nwhat\nwhat about college aligns with them and\nthat could even be duty you could even\nlike come to the revelation i've had\nstudents do this who sort of say that\nlike okay my parents have supported me\nthey're paying for my college i owe them\nlike some degree of like work right\nbecause they're paying for me so i\nshould do this\nand then what and then it's it's not\nlike a vague should it actually even\nthough they use the word should it\ncrosses over into duty and then we see a\npositive behavioral change once you\nalign studying with their values we see\na positive behavioral change because\nthen even if you're if you're giving\nsomething up even if there's a loss\ninvolved if it kind of like if you're\ngiving something up but you can make\nthat class your own like if you kind of\nsay okay well i'm in college i'm\nstudying finance but i really care about\nphilosophy and what i'm going to do is\nlike minor in philosophy and you sort of\nhelp them sort of uncover\nyou know some plan to help them act in a\nway that's aligned with their values and\nyou'll see positive behavioral change\nokay does that make sense\nokay yes so the second thing so the key\ntakeaway here is that you know as a\ncoach what you want to do is clarify\nlike what is driving this person clarify\ntheir intent and as you clarify that\ntheir intent you can start to ask them\nquestions that sort of\nhelp them understand like what is on\nthis side of the equation and how do we\nget from like this side of the equation\nto this side of the equation how do we\nget and what's the conflict that they\nface and the cool thing about human\nbeings is once you bring a subconscious\nconflict to the surface in a conscious\nmanner it tends to move towards the\nright direction okay\nso that those are the four types of\nintent any questions before we move on\nokay\nso the next thing that we're going to do\nis talk about raising the uh the\nawareness of negative\nso this is a big problem that a lot of\npeople who set goals and like have\nintent you know these kind of intent\nproblems have which is that they don't\nreally appreciate the negative so when\nsomeone talks about a goal\nlike and they say like okay my goal is\nto study every day like what kind of\nyou know is that like a positive thing\nin their mind or a negative thing in\ntheir mind\nwhen people think about like meeting\ntheir goals so what is like the\nemotional energy behind that what's the\nvalence there\nsome part of it is like resemblance or\nthe situation they're in ah okay\ngreat good\nis that conscious or unconscious\nwhat do you would say unconscious\nyeah i mean they may be somewhat\nconscious of it but for the most part\nit's unconscious right so when i think\nabout losing weight\nis that idea filled with resentment or\nlike\nor what\nright when i think about getting a 4.0\ngpa like is the primary emotion that i\nfeel when i think about that resentment\nwhat's the primary emotion that people\nfeel when they they kind of think about\nfulfilling their goals\nsome kind of excitement yeah so it's\npositive in nature right so it's like\nexciting\nachievement\npride\nright so this is interesting so like\nwhen someone's is kind of thinking about\ntheir goals in a very positive manner\num you know you're i'm gonna post it on\nsocial media like i'm gonna advertise\ni'm gonna get into harvard and i'm gonna\nlike buy a harvard hoodie in a harvard\nhat and then a harvard bumper sticker\nand then everyone's gonna know i went to\nharvard it's gonna be great\nso what happens when they sort of have\nall of these like positive like\nexpectations or ideas of achieving their\ngoals and they set out to actually like\nachieve their goals\ndoesn't easily work sustainably\nwhy not\nbecause part of their brain is sort of\nthought that they've already done it and\nso there's less motivation to do it and\npart of it is that whenever there's like\nan implicit judgment about what you're\ndoing it's like putting white gas in\nyour car like it'll kind of get you\ngoing for a little while like you can do\nalmost anything for a week or two and\nthen it's just not going to work all\nthat well\nokay excellent someone's been watching\ndr k's guide i think\ntheir motivation is hinged oh sorry\nallen go ahead oh it's just gonna say\nyeah it's pretty good have you have you\nseen it\nsteve\ni was gonna say their motivation is\nhinged on the outcome not absent their\naction\nright so when we so when we people think\nabout goals in a positive way which is\nlike sort of how we defaultly think\nabout them it's like it's a weird\nsentence to say because like of course\nwe want to achieve our goals like why do\nwe want to achieve our goals because of\nlike some something positive duh that's\nwhy they're my goals to begin with but\nthere's interesting it's interesting\nbecause what actually happens is we\ncreate an expectation\nso let's say like i think about how\nawesome it's going to be when i get into\nshape it's going to be great i create\nthis expectation of how like i'm going\nto be a chad and i'm going to go to the\nbeach and like it's gonna be like chad\ncity up in here\nand then i go to the gym\nand what's my experience in the gym\nit's hard\nyep right i'm huffing i'm puffing the\nshame and afterwards people there who\nare in shape and you're not oh there you\ngo right\nand after one week\ni look at my flabby ass in the mirror\nand what do i see am i am i dr chad\nthundercock now\nhis is the action that i've taken\nwhat is the correlation between the\naction that i've taken and the\nexpectation that i have\nit's fallen way short absolutely and\nthen what does that do to my motivation\ndecrease\nabsolutely right\nso this is the big thing like when\npeople come in and they're like i'm\nfired up like i'm achieve this goal i'm\ngonna make my life\nwhat i want it to be\nyou know i'm gonna crush it\ni'm gonna make a million dollars i'm\ngonna get into shape i'm gonna like it's\ngonna be awesome like i'm gonna do so\ngood\ni'm gonna become a pro league of legends\nplayer it's going to be awesome\nand so like it's kind of weird but like\none of the key things we can do as a\ncoach is raise awareness of the negative\nso a couple of important things there\nthe first thing that we do when we raise\nawareness of the negative is we fix this\nexpectation issue because we set\nappropriate expectations and the problem\nis that when they set inappropriate\nexpectations and they go out and they do\nsomething\nand what happens doesn't align with\ntheir expectations it tanks their\nmotivation and then they quit\nright and then they feel ashamed of\nthemselves\nand then they feel they get the identity\nof a quitter\ngg get wrecked noobs\ngame over\nright so this cycle happens so fast and\nit starts with here\nokay or it doesn't identify the quitter\nsounds harsh so they're like all these\nlike milder versions of this right\nthey're like oh i'm not good at that\nlike i'm good at being a programmer but\ni'm like not good at actually making\nvideo games\nlike you know there are things that\nwe've spent a decade training in and so\nwe'll see this a lot in our community as\nwell where they're like they're people\nwho are doing pretty well in life but\nlike when it comes to doing things that\nthey find\nthat they value so there are a lot of\npeople that can actually do the should\ncolumn really well we'll get these\npeople too and when you talk to them\nthat they feel unhappy and you talk to\nthem about oh you know what about things\nthat you value there'll be some kind of\nidentity thing there\nright they'll feel like okay i'm not\nquite as talented as like other\nmusicians\nor they'll say things like i've already\ninvested so much into this career that\nlike\ni would feel behind if i switched now or\nit's too late right and if they start\nsaying things like that what is that\nwhere what part of the mind is that\ncoming from\nif they say i'm behind other musicians\nbecause i've spent 10 years as a\nprogrammer that's that's the ego\nego absolutely right so it doesn't have\nto look like you know a quit\nshamed\nlike neat kind of person right like th\nthis stuff this cycle manifests in\npeople who are like very healthy and\nvery successful it's just the way that\nthe mind works\nso first thing that we're going to do by\nraising awareness of the negative is\nthat we're going to like deal with the\nidea of expectation and as your clients\nlearn how to expect\nappropriate things from their actions\nit'll actually like\ndisable this cycle and they'll be able\nto retain motivation\nthe second thing that raising awareness\nof the negative does\nis\nlet me think about what number two is\nhas to do with ambivalence\nokay\nso can somebody define ambivalence for\nme again\nit's like you're sitting on the fence\nabsolutely right so like\non the fence\nso if we kind of go back oh\nif we go back to this like these\nconflicts or ambivalence you'll see that\nthis is this is ambivalence right here\nso anytime that humans have a desire to\ndo something or i mean i'm using the\nword desire loosely here\nanytime that a human wants to do\nsomething\nif they don't do it there's something\nthat's getting in the way and so the\nother thing that happens with our\nclients is like they think about\nyou know\nwhat they want to accomplish but they\ndon't really appreciate what keeps them\nfrom accomplishing it so this is kind of\nweird but like a lot of people in in the\ndigital generation they say that they\nlack motivation they don't lack\nmotivation they actually have a ton of\nmotivation and i want you guys to think\nabout this is going to sound kind of\nweird\nif i play a video if i wake up and i\nlet's say like i'm a video game addict\nright and i watch video i play video\ngames all day long and my life is\nfalling apart\nand i describe myself as unmotivated\nwhat do y'all think about that\nam i unmotivated\nno\nwhy do you say no david you just really\nmotivated to play video games absolutely\nright so i want you guys to really\nappreciate this\nif playing video games is destroying\nevery dimension of my life\nit's screwing up my relationships it's\nscrewing up my health it's screwing up\nmy professional prospects it's screwing\nup my grades\nfor that high of a cost i want you all\nto recognize that there must be a pro on\nthe other side of that equation\nin order to continue that behavior and\nthis is the thing that no one thinks\nabout being a video game addict is a\nhuge pro in their mind but it absolutely\nis because that's just like literally\nhow the brain works\nhuman beings do not engage in like\ngenerally speaking negative things we\ndefault to things that on balance\nbenefit us that's how we've evolved so\nhow do i know like how you know how far\nto hunt or what kind of territory to\nhave it's because on balance the pros\noutweigh the cons that's just how\nevolution works\nso by raising awareness of the negative\nwe're sort of highlighting costs\noh sorry i said highly\nso we highlight costs and then we kind\nof like help people understand like what\nis on the other side of the equation\nbecause the other problem with people\nwho are unmotivated is they they just\ndon't understand it right they're like i\ndon't know every part of my life is\nfalling apart because i'm addicted to\nvideo games i just don't know why i\ncan't do something about it there's a\nhuge blind spot in their mind and the\nhigh the blind spot is actually\nhighlighting the costs or in a weird way\nfor a negative behavior it's\nhighlighting the benefit\nso in either case it's about both sides\nof the fence\nokay\nso the advantage of sort of highlighting\nthe negative or in some sense the pro\nlike the reason i'm talking about the\nnegative is when i think about okay i\nwant to become a doctor and that's the\ngoal that i have there's like a negative\nto that there's a huge cost to that\nwhich is why i'm not doing it that's why\ni'm not engaging in the behavior\ndoes that make sense so it can be\npositive or negative but we're basically\ntalking about the flip side of the coin\nand the cool thing about that is once\nagain we have evidence-based\nmotivational interviewing and once you\nhighlight the negative and you raise\nthat ambivalence and you start working\nwith them using the stages of change\nmodel\nthat's when you start to see positive\nchange but that has to start with\nawareness of the negative and working on\nthat ambivalence until you can't move\nsomeone past ambivalence you can't move\nsomeone past an internal conflict if\nthey don't know what the internal\nconflict is and eventually what you want\nto get to is to the point where your\nclient is making a choice\nand once they understand that they're\nmaking a choice every single day i have\na choice today to play league of legends\nor take one insignificant step towards\nthe life that i want to which one am i\ngoing to pick and once they understand\nthat it's going to be an insignificant\nstep it's going to feel insignificant\nthey're going to study today but it's\nnot going to give them a 4.0 that\nthey'll never get a 4.0 but who do i\nwant to be do i want to live a life that\nis in service to my values filled with\nexternal rewards or do i want to live a\nlife that is in service to what i care\nabout and is going to lead to internal\nreward once that choice becomes clear in\ntheir mind which you're going to help\nthem do and we'll explain a little bit\nabout the neuroscience of how that works\nthen they start making choices in the\nright direction right and also from\nmotivational interviewing we know from\nnumerous scientific studies that this\nmethodology is actually effective at\ncreating a behavioral change in the\nright direction\nokay\nso working on ambivalence\num\nokay and then we get to the third\nadvantage of raising the awareness of\nthe negative which is that this is kind\nof weird but paradoxically\nso this is going to sound kind of weird\ni may have kind of\nspoiled you all already but once the\ncost of a behavior increases in my mind\nwhat does that actually do to my ability\nor with my likelihood to engage in the\nbehavior\nit lowers it so that's what one would\nthink\nbut paradoxically increasing cost\ncan sometimes\ndrive behavior\nokay\nand that may sound really weird because\nit is so this is where like we're not\nreally sure how this works we just know\nmultiple instances of like human\nbehavior where this is the case\nso the first example is actually comes\nfrom wine tasting okay so people have\ndone studies on wine tasting\nand like\nwhat do you all think so if i if i blind\na group of people like let's say expert\nsommeliers which are like professional\nwine tasters and i blind them to a wine\nlike to like let's say i give them five\nbottles of wine that have various costs\nwhat do you think happens do you think\nthe sommeliers can tell which wine is\nlike\ndo you think they can tell that the more\nexpensive wine actually tastes better\nno\nso it's interesting because you're\ncorrect so like people like the\ninteresting thing about sommeliers is\nthey'll agree there'll be consensus\nabout which wines are better than others\nso they can rank the wines from one two\nthree four five but there will be like\nno correlation with dollar signs\nnow they do a second experiment\nwhere they tell them\nthey're not blinded to price\nwhat do you think happens when\nwine tasters are not blinded to price in\nterms of how they rate wines\nthe more expensive ones taste better\nabsolutely so the price drives the\nperception of quality\nokay so this is like there have been\nscientific studies on this\nand so like like corporations use this\nall the time in terms of like you know\nthey'll use it for sales for example so\nwhen i say that oh this this car costs a\nhundred thousand dollars but you can get\nit on sale for like forty thousand\ndollars there's this perception of value\nthat like is created by the cost that\nyou pay\nit's kind of bizarre the other good\nexample of this is there have been a lot\nof studies on hazing\nand what effect does hazing have on\nsomeone's like value of the group\nthey're being hazed to join\nlike if i get hey if i have to get hayes\nto join a frat what happens to my\nperception of the value of the frat\nit goes up\nabsolutely\nincreases value and if we think about it\nlike if i tell you\nlike i'm going to tell you hey if you\nwant to join this frat it's going to\n[ __ ] suck we're going to tie you up\nnaked seriously happened at\nyou you know the university i went to\nwhen i was a freshman\nlike there was one fraternity that would\ntie up their pledges naked on a tree\nthey'd like\ntie them up onto trees and then the\npeople in the frat would piss on them\nmake you naked i'm going to piss on you\nand it's going to be awful what do y'all\nthink like how many people do you think\ndropped out of hazing like after the the\npledge process after being demeaned and\npaying this huge humiliating cost\nnot my friend by the way but\ni'll say like none\nabsolutely\nso i know it's\nweird okay like i don't understand\nexactly why this happens\nbut as coaches like we sort of don't\ncare right so what we're gonna do as\ncoaches is we're gonna use psychology\nand neuroscience to help our clients get\nto where they need to go\nand like we're not saying we're going to\nhaze them or anything like that right we\ndon't want to do that that's not we're\nnot going to be we're going to be like\nauthentic and compassionate but what we\ncan learn is that paradoxically high\nfront loaded costs can actually\nincentivize behavior and what we see\nthis time and time and time again right\nif you tell your client hey like what do\nyou think going to the gym is like\nthey're going to be like oh i think it's\ngoing to be tough and you guys raise\nawareness of the negative you're going\nto be like it may be really hard you may\nfeel ashamed okay what's gonna happen\nlike let's think about it how are we\ngonna deal with that shame where does\nthat shame come from like how are you\ngonna feel\nand then what do they say when you\nactually like get them to go if you've\nprepped them about the negative costs\nwhat do they say when they come back\nit wasn't that bad\nabsolutely so here's the key thing\nall right\nwhat does this\nstatement do to their motivation\nhow does this statement affect whether\nthey go tomorrow or\nnot it increases absolutely\nright\nso this is why we want to raise\nawareness of the negative there are\nactually multiple mechanisms that are\nreally important about raising awareness\nof the negative the first is that we\ndeal with their expectations we set\nappropriate expectations the second is\nthat by elevating the cost\nso i don't know if you all have this or\nif you all have ever seen this but like\nwe see examples of this all the time so\nanother good example is like you know\nparents who are like living vicariously\nthrough their children\nso they've given up\nso much for their child and so the value\nof that sacrifice like increases in\ntheir mind and like drives all kinds of\nsometimes negative behaviors you can see\nthis in like narcissistic parents too\nwhere they've like paid a big cost so it\nmust mean\nthat like there's big value to what i've\ndone if i quit my job and i gave up my\ncareer to raise you\nthat means that i must have done a very\ngood job does that make sense like they\ncan't tolerate the idea there's a bunch\nof cognitive dissonance which is\nprobably the mechanism here by the way\nis like cognitive dissonance\nis that we're sort of leveraging\ncognitive dissonance in a positive way\nto like get people aligned to move in\nthe direction that they want to go and\nin the case of like narcissistic parents\nit's kind of the other way around where\nlike to prevent that cognitive\ndissonance like it feels dumb to like\npay a cost and not get value out of it\nso as you sort of raise awareness of the\ncost you can actually drive positive\nbehavior okay and then the third thing\nis ambivalence and sort of working\nthrough that ambivalence which sort of\ndrives people in the right direction\nquestions about you know how to clarify\nintent or the value of raising awareness\nof the negative\nyeah i don't fully understand how the\nlast part the paradoxical thing might\nwork in a session so i i guess my\nunderstanding is okay so we're going to\nraise a lot of awareness of the\nnegatives which increases the cost and\ntherefore when they actually try it then\nit drives the behavior more is that\nwhat it is\nso so\nin session i think the main thing like\nso the questions that you want to ask is\nlike for a given goal like what's it\ngoing to cost you\nright like that's the question you want\nto ask\nlike what do you have to give up by\ndoing this\nso if i start if i if the goal is to get\nme to stop playing like a game all day\nwhat do i give up what do i lose\nby\nnot playing the game\nbecause that's not something most people\nthink about what what most people just\nthink about is like what do i gain by\nquitting gaming\nand so then what happens is like they're\nnot aware that there's like\nlike and then it's kind of silly because\nlike when they try to give up gaming so\nlet's say that the advantages of gaming\nis that like let's just take this\nexample okay so for gaming\nwhat are the advantages if i play video\ngames all day like what do i get from\nthat\nemotional suppression\nabsolutely\nfun\ndistracted socialization\nyep socialization\ndopamine get some of that sweet sweet\ndopamine or fun right\nso and everyone what what people tend to\nlook at is like the advantages of\nachieving a goal so they think like oh\nmy god like i'm gonna get money and i'm\ngonna you know get healthy and i'm gonna\nbecome independent\nand i'm gonna be confident\nright this is what they're focusing on\nand then when they try to do it like\nthey're not prepared for like this\nso like the cause they're not prepared\nfor the shame\nthey're not prepared for the loneliness\nand they're not prepared for the boredom\nand so if they're not like ready for\nthis like what's gonna happen when they\nstop playing games for a day\nlike this is gonna hit and then like\ntheir brain is like this feels bad\nwhy the hell are we doing this\nlet's go back to the gaming like which\none do you think your brain is gonna\npick\ni give you a choice red pill blue pill\none involves having fun and having\nfriends and one involves shame\nloneliness and boredom which one are you\ngonna pick\nso you have to help people understand\nthat there's a cost\nand oddly enough like\nthe more that you emphasize cost\nso let me ask y'all like when you\nemphasize cost like which way are you\nmoving\nin this quadrant\naway from desires\naway from desire is sure so i'd say that\nlike if we think about cost right cost\nis up here so like this is how you move\npeople in this direction\nand then what you do is you help people\nlike okay what do you care about as you\nclarify that\nyou know so this is how you get away\nfrom desires absolutely and then you're\nin the shoulds and then like you know\nthere are other techniques that you can\nuse to move people to the right\ndoes that make sense\ndoes that answer your question tom\ni think so so we're trying to highlight\nthe\nthe cost that it's going to cost a lot\nin terms of shame loneliness boredom and\nthen for some reason paradoxically that\nactually drives behavior yeah so so like\nyou know we don't want to over emphasize\nit because chances are they're blind to\nit so we want to raise some awareness of\nit and then what happens is like once\nthey know what to expect right then\nwe're engaging this circuit whatever the\nhell this is\nbecause then when they try and you say\nhey like i think this next week so if\nyou want to quit gaming i'm behind you\n100\ni think it's going to be tough\ni know you can do it bro but it ain't\ngoing to be easy\nright does that like does that make\nsense in terms of a coach like as a\ncoach like how that will help someone\nmove in the right direction\nyeah that that definitely helps to\nclarify right so like it's like hey bro\nthis ain't gonna be easy\nor but like this is what it could look\nlike so i want you to be prepared and\nthen you can also engage a lot of other\nlike super practical stuff since it's\ngonna be so hard you know i know you\nwant to stop gaming for a week but like\nyou may just last one or two days at a\ntime how are you going to feel if you\nfail after one or two days\nand let's remember that this can take\npractice right so then you're going to\nprep them from failure you're going to\ndo all that kind of good stuff and then\nwhen they come in they say okay i was\nonly able to make it three days and you\ncould say hold on a second on your first\nattempt\nyou didn't meet your goal of one week\nbut you actually went 72 hours without\nplaying a single video game\nthat's amazing\nand you view that as a failure\nand you went 72 hours\nlike i can see that you didn't meet your\ngoal but on the flip side like if you\ndid it for one day if you did it for two\ndays and you did it for three days like\nyou could probably do it for three days\nagain\nlet's figure out how you can do it for\nthree days again you adjust their goal\nwe'll kind of get to that in a second\nbut that's the iterative aspect right\nso it all kind of ties together in a\npractical sense we've got you know a\nlist of questions and exercises by the\nway and like even dialogue sample\ndialogue for y'all that we'll give y'all\nin the manual\nokay\nthat'll clarify a lot of these things\nokay so now we get to the fun part\npresuming this hasn't been fun already\nokay so now what we're gonna do\nis talk about\nhow\nawareness changes people\nso here we are\nsaying oh just like have conversations\nabout their shoulds and their values and\ntheir desires and have conversations\nabout this and make them aware of the\ncosts so the question becomes like how\ndoes that from a neuroscience\nperspective\nactually result\nin like changes in their behavior and\nthis gets really fascinating so have you\nall seen the video versus nyan um video\nin dr k's guide\nand can anyone kind of explain like a\ntldr of like what what the takeaway from\nthat guy does i think if i remember\ncorrectly vidya is knowledge and yana's\nunderstanding so it's like objective\nknowledge and subjective understanding\nand the differences between the two\nyep so it's information\nit's objective\nand then neon is\nunderstanding\nand it's subjective so which one do you\nthink is more responsible for behavioral\nchange\nyeah\nabsolutely\nright so this is once again the problem\nof the internet which is that we have\ntons of information out there\nabout how to fix your life\nright\navailable to you for the low price of\n300\nif you sign up now\nbut everyone watches these things and\nlike it doesn't actually change their\nbehavior and there's new there's tons of\ninformation from like medical science\nthat\ninformation does not change behavior\nright so if i have someone who's like\nsmoking and i say hey if you smoke\nyou're gonna get lung cancer\ndo you want lung cancer they say no do\nthey quit smoking\nno okay right so then the question\nbecomes how does awareness\ngo from here to here like so this is\nessentially what we're gonna do we're\ngonna what we focus on in coaching is\nnot giving them information we focus on\ngiving them understanding so how does\nthat process work so it starts by\nunderstanding two things one is that\nthere's explicit memory\nand there's implicit memory\nokay\nand then there's working\nwe're memory\nto kind of gloss over working memory for\na second so explicit memory is\ninformation\nfacts\nand uh\nmemories\ndoes this make sense so like if i ask\nyou\nyou know what your name is\nor where was the what was the address\nlike what city did you grow up in\nthat's like explicit memory it's stored\nin a particular part of the brain like\nthe hippocampus\nokay\nand then implicit memory is like is\nunderstanding so let me give you all an\nexample and it's stored in other parts\nof the brain so let's say i want to\nlearn how to play basketball\nso if i want to learn how to play\nbasketball i go and i watch youtube\nvideos on basketball i go and i read\nbooks about michael i watch the michael\njordan documentary\ni learn all these facts about basketball\ni study like the physics of the body and\ni figure out i learn all these tips\nright so people say that when you're\nshooting\nyou should you know when you're shooting\nhoops you should follow through have you\nall heard that before in terms of\nbasketball\nso i like i know all the tips\nwhat happens when i go and play\nbasketball i have all the information\ni'm really inexperienced and not good at\nmaking the basket\nabsolutely right so it doesn't actually\ntranslate into like\nworkable\ninformation right so what happens in the\nbrain is we have these like infra look\nwe have these tips and the cool thing is\nthat we can turn this tip of\nfollow-through into understanding but\nthen where that lives is actually the\ncerebellum for basketball\nso what happens is like memories\nexplicit memories are stored in the\nhippocampus but then what happens is\nthat as we catalyze understanding\nthat information moves from the\nhippocampus to other parts of our brain\nand specifically for us it moves to the\nfrontal lobe or the neocortex\nokay\nso like we can i can read i can read\nabout motivation there are people here\nwho are listening to this on stream\nright now and they can understand the\nconcepts theoretically and they can even\ni can even quiz them right like the next\nday i can ask chat chat what did y'all\nremember about what i said but that's\nall explicit memory and it lives in the\nhippocampus and they can recall it but\nit's not actually going to change their\nlives in order to change their lives\nthere's actually a very in a sense\nwell-known process where explicit\nmemories from the hippocampus\nessentially get encoded in other parts\nof our brain\nin the cerebellum in the frontal lobes\nand in parts of our cortices and once\nthey get encoded there then they\nactually affect our behavior okay so\ni'll give you all an example like once\nit clicks for me that i need to follow\nthrough when i'm shooting hoops then my\nbody like kind of responds but the way\nthat it clicks is how like how do i get\ninformation to click with shooting hoops\nhow do i learn how to like\nshoot effectively in\nyour basketball\nabsolutely practice i gotta be saying a\nwhole bunch of times\nplay it uh play on the court right so i\ngotta get on the court\nokay\nso now\nand this sort of makes sense right like\nonce i play on the court like once i\npractice once i get out there once i\nstart fluidly applying the concepts\nswimming around in the concepts i don't\nquite understand it right so like a lot\nof being on the court is about being at\nthe barrier of your understanding so let\nme ask y'all\nwhat is the mental equivalent of get\nplaying on the court\nhow do we do that\nhow do we get in there and actually\nstart shooting hoops when it comes to\nmental concepts\nlike desires studying for just 30\nminutes or whatever the applicable goal\nwould be nope incorrect\nstudying is explicit information\noh sorry i meant studying in the sense\nof like if your goal is\nlike to get a 4.0 but the small\ninsignificant step is studying\nthen you take that small insignificant\nstep okay so but i can't take that small\ninsignificant step except right steve\nlike that's my whole problems i can't\nstudy\nso what's the equivalent i know it's\nsort of like a read my mind question but\ni'm gonna stick to this one what's the\nequivalent of playing on the court when\nit comes to like these mental internal\nprocesses\npicking up the ball and shooting hoops\nsee if chat can get it\nit's not doing it\nokay so i know this is this is i love\nthese answers\nthis is it this is literally what we do\nright so like here's the thing\nthere's all this theoretical crap\nfloating around in their head\ngetting them to play with it getting\nthem to understand i know you guys know\nthis right this is literally what you do\nyou get on the court of the mind\nand you help people like understand\nthese concepts they play around with\nthem you test it this way you test it\nthat way you talk about it you have\nrevelations you have emotional catharsis\nthey're starting to play with these\nconcepts and you're bringing it out with\nthem that's literally what coaching is\nso that's why we do coaching in the way\nthat we do it so like as someone you can\nexplain this stuff to people but as you\nall work with them as you talk about\nthese concepts\nthese concepts move from information to\nunderstanding they start to move into\nyour frontal lobes and like your\nneocortex and like other parts of your\nbrain\nand then they start to actually affect\nyour behavior\nso this is also why you know as we look\nat some of the the format of coaching\nwhy do we coach people one hour a week\nover eight weeks as opposed to eight\nhours in one day\nwhat do y'all think that is\nwe want them to do the work\nuh sure\nyou need practice over time\nabsolutely so this mechanism\nwhen does this happen do you all know\nthis process right here it happens at a\nvery specific time\nwhen does explicit memory get encoded as\nimplicit memory\nwhen does sleeping\nabsolutely during sleep\nokay so theoretically and we've tried\nthis okay so we've had coaches who will\nwork with clients twice a week\nthis is also why um\nwe actually like generally speaking keep\nsessions to an hour because remember you\nhave this working memory and so your\nworking memory gets overwritten\nafter 45 minutes\nso like a lot of times clients will want\nlike 90 minute sessions or two hour\nsessions because it feels good\nbut what we really want is we don't want\nthem to lose the first 45 minutes in the\nnext 45 minutes so a lot of the way that\nwe've structured our intervention is\nbait\nhas some of these concepts baked in that\nchange happens over time like sure we\nsort of generically know that but\nhippocampus consolidation into long-term\nmemory and application into your\ncerebellum happens during sleep so if\nyou want to study effectively for\nexample like when i was studying in\nmedical school part of the reason i was\neffective is because i tried to take a\nnap every day because studying for four\nhours at a stretch is not as effective\nis start studying for two hours taking a\nnap and studying for two hours you give\nyour brain time to consolidate that\nmemory and turn it into understanding\nquestions about this\nokay right on time finish on time\nall right\nso let's go ahead and um\nbut just summarize this quickly so like\nif we think about basketball right it's\nessentially practice\nand so what is practice for the mind\nlike that's what we try to do in\ncoaching so this is where like as you\nunderstand these concepts as you play\nwith these concepts as you work with\nclients over time and you kind of\nreinforce them what will happen is like\nthese concepts will start to be\ninternalized by your clients and then\nthey'll start to affect their behavior\nbecause then then at that point it's\nworking from the frontal lobe like i\ndon't know if this sort of makes sense\nbut if you look at motivation and you\nthink about a should\nso\nlike when i ignore the shoulds those\nshoulds are coming from explicit memory\nit's like i'm sitting down i'm about to\nplay league of legends\nfirst thing in the morning which is like\n11 a.m for me\nand then this this thought pops up this\nfact pops up in my head i have a thought\nthat gets generated from explicit memory\nthat says hey you should not do this but\nit does not actually drive me my\nbehavior when you look at people who\nmake behavioral changes\nthe thought comes from a different place\nit doesn't just pop up as a fact or a\nbit of information that then quickly\ngets ignored it comes from a completely\ndifferent place of their brain and when\nit comes from the frontal lobe then it\nactually results in things like impulse\ncontrol\nnot a fact that is coming from their\nhippocampus it's an actual understanding\nthat results in impulse control from the\nfrontal lobe does that make sense to you\nall or is that like a bit too abstract\ndo you all know what i mean\nlike if you examine your own thought\nprocess\nyou'll recognize like you know you have\nsome good behaviors and if you pay\nattention to where those good behaviors\ncome from or where change comes from in\nyour mind it's not actually a fact it's\nsomething that's coming from a different\npart of your brain it's something that\nreigns in an impulse and drives your\nbehavior and that's what the frontal\nlobe does as long as it's coming from\nthe hippocampus as long as it's a piece\nof information as long as it's vidya as\nlong as it is it's me telling you or\nyour parents telling you this is bad for\nyou you should stop doing it it will not\nchange behavior it'll just be explicit\nmemory\nthis is also why parents can tell you a\nthousand times to do something\nbut as long as it's floating around you\ncan remember that they told you to do\nthat but as long as it's coming from\nyour hippocampus and explicit memory\nit's not going to drive behavioral\nchange and so the mechanism from moving\nfrom explicit memory to implicit memory\nis literally how we have designed this\ncoaching intervention this is the goal\nand that's why we kind of say awareness\nfirst raise awareness raise awareness\nraise awareness because raising\nawareness is the process that gets you\nfrom here to here\nthey have to like get it right they have\nto understand it they have to be aware\nof it and by the way awareness is also\nwhat strengthens the frontal lobe so\nawareness comes from the frontal lobe as\nwell\nso from a neuroscience perspective it's\nlike boosting the frontal lobe"
