    "transcript": "not good enough is not a reason to keep\nfrom acting\nyou got to start somewhere like if you\nend up with a 4.0 great\nbut if you open if you never crack the\nbook\nbecause you're saying to yourself\nwhatever i do today is not going to be\ngood enough that's a self-fulfilling\nprophecy\nokay so let's get on to the meat and\nbones of the training all right\nso um\nso the first thing that we're going to\ntry to do is explain a little bit about\nhow motivation like how we can\nunderstand motivation\nso if you look at motivation they're\nactually a bunch of different\ndisciplines that like will talk about\nmotivation and behavior so for example\nthere's neuroscience there's psychology\nthere's even behavioral economics\nthere's spirituality even like the\nsystem of psychotherapy has its own\ntradition about understanding motivation\nthey're also like these more novel\napproaches to motivation so there's like\nthe self-help section right of like the\nbookstore where people are sort of\ntalking about personal experiences and\nmotivation and my most most recent\nfavorite one is like they're all the\nlife hacks right so you have like in our\nsociety when you look at motivation\nthere are a lot of different disciplines\nand approaches that people will take to\nactually like figuring out okay what is\nmy motivation like how does motivation\nwork like how do i fix this problem\nso then the question becomes okay if\nwe're coaches and we're here to help\nclients sort of fix this problem how are\nwe going to approach it\nand so what we're going to start with as\nwe do with most things in healthy gamers\nwe're actually going to start with sort\nof the yogic approach and then what\nwe're going to do is sprinkle in i think\nkey findings from psychology and\nneuroscience\nand also some things from like\npsychotherapy and stuff you'll find that\na lot of this stuff is actually baked\ninto\nthe curriculums that y'all have already\ngone through but we're going to kind of\ntake a step back and think about it so\nlike i was saying earlier there's no\nsanskrit word for motivation because\nmotivation is actually an umbrella term\nso what do y'all think are the\ncomponents of motivation like what do\nyou think determines whether someone is\nmotivated or not\nintrinsic value\nwhat does that mean\nwhen they sort of have\na purpose that they care about that they\ncan work and commit towards working\nokay\nso a sense of value\nwhat else what do you think like what\ngoes into like come on like when y'all\nare motivated towards something or not\nmotivated towards something what goes\ninto that\nlet's start with steven\nease of access is a big one like how\nlikely am i to get that thing okay\nwhat i was going to say desire for the\noutcome\ndesire for the outcome sure right so\nthere's like outcome orientation there's\nlike likelihood of success\ngreat\nwhat else like feel about it like your\nemotional like sort of attitude towards\nit okay your emotional attitude towards\nit right so let's say that\nall i have to do is go to class and\ni'll get the points for attendance right\nlikelihood of success is very high and\nyet\nmy emotional attitude can keep me from\ngoing to class right\nbrian what did you say\ncan you all hear him or is it just me no\nno we can't hear oh you can hear me\nthere you\nokay yeah i was saying is um\nlike\njust like\nlike fulfilling a purpose\nor like okay\nyeah my analogy is like just like\nfilling up a hole like that you just dug\nover something like that that's how i\nam okay great\nwillingness to suffer\nuh what do you mean by that\ni mean like what level of tolerance do\nyou have for going through whatever\nadversity you're gonna have to go\nthrough for this goal right so like\nthe adversity to getting a snack might\nbe walking up the stairs that's not a\nlot of adversity i can go through that\nbut\nmaybe to getting a\nphd the adversity is years of struggle\nand sacrificing having fun so i can\nstudy and\nyeah that might be a lot more\nso spot on so this is where uh crap my\nipad is pooping out hold on\nokay so the first thing that i kind of\nwant to point out is that um\nif we look at motivation y'all are\ncoming up with like a lot of different\nthings right there's like what's the\nlikelihood of success there's like how\nyou feel about it what the outcome is\nhow important it is to you um there are\nlots of different\nattributes that we can kind of think of\nwhen it comes to\nlike what goes into motivation so this\nis the first problem with motivation is\nthat when people say that they're\nunmotivated\nthey don't know like which of these\nthings is the problem\nyou know am i not engaging in the action\nbecause i believe that the likelihood of\nsuccess is low so let's take a step back\nfor a second and imagine that i have an\nahamkar that views me as a failure who\nwants to explain real quick for the\npeople who are streaming what an aham\ngod is\nthe ego it's the part of your mind\nthat's trying to prevent you from you\nknow incurring any damage just trying to\nlike\nyou know sort of ease you into like or\nnot really ease but it's trying to\nprotect you from anything that's like\nkind of unusual or uncomfortable or like\nyou know undesirable yep so if i have an\nidentity or ego as a failure what do you\nthink that does to my calculation of the\nlikelihood of success of taking an\naction\nit's gonna say that you're gonna fail so\nso don't do it in the first place\nexactly right\nso like if we think about this as\ncoaches like this is kind of interesting\nbecause someone says oh i'm not\nmotivated to do something\nwhereas the reason they're not motivated\nis because the calculation in their mind\nsets the likelihood of success is very\nlow and therefore it's not worth doing\nand so if we think about like this is\nkind of tricky because when this client\ncomes in\nand they say i want to\nyou know i want to i want to find a\nromantic partner but i can't because i'm\nugly\nlike how would you work with that person\nas a coach\nhelp them explore where they got the\nidea of\nhow they are ugly and like what is their\nperspective on that perfect right so so\nlike this is and this is the real\nchallenge that we have as coaches is\nthat a lot of times what will happen is\nthat coaches will come in with a\nparticular goal\nbut like if they want to find a romantic\npartner and then what they'll do is\nthey'll go to like pick up artists or\nlike you know whatever to learn\nparticular skills whereas like that's\nthe treatment that the the solution that\nthe client is coming up with is actually\nbased on like a false formulation of\nwhere their problem is\nso instead like by understanding\nconcepts like a hum car and you sort of\nrealize like oh the problem is like you\ncan learn as many pick up skills as you\nwant to but as long as you are you know\nasking someone out and you feel like\nyou're not worth dating and that you're\na failure that's going to come across as\nunattractive become a self-fulfilling\nprophecy and then like you know they'll\nreject you oh i'm more of a failure and\nthe next person that you ask out you're\nkind of like\nlike you're kind of like exuding that\nlike loser musk right and that makes you\nlike less attractive and then you kind\nof fail again and so what we try to do\nin coaching is once we understand oh\nthis is actually a problem of a hum car\nwhere they think going into the\ninteraction that they're doomed to\nfailure so once we sort of decompress\nthat ahamkar we start to ask them hey\nwhere did you get the idea that you're a\nfailure to begin with once we kind of\nsit with them and work with them and as\nthat identity goes down like what we'll\nobserve and this is i'm sure you all\nhave seen this\nyou know where like you're working with\na client and they seem like super stuck\nand you're sitting there week after week\nlike helping them understand themselves\nand then like the next week they just go\nand like do what they were supposed to\ndo you all had that experience before\nyeah so everyone's nodding because\npeople can't see that who here wants to\nshare an experience not really violating\nprivacy or anything like that but who\nhere wants to share an experience about\nthat with a client like has anyone can\nanyone say something like where you\nthought you were doing a terrible job it\ndidn't seem like y'all were getting\nanywhere and then all of a sudden\nanyone feel like sharing\nyeah i'll share what oh go ahead david\num yeah i had a client and i'm going to\ntalk slow just to make sure that i'm not\nsort of violating anything um but i had\na client\num for about 16 weeks um\nand we sort of just kept exploring and\nunderstanding and\num sort of there\nthey kept talking about their goals and\ndidn't really feel like they were\ngetting anywhere um\nand then you know i i felt like i wasn't\ndoing anything um they never sort of\nreported back any like progress or\nanything\nand then\ni think i think it was before 16 weeks\nprobably like 12 or 13.\nthey just sort of had this story of yeah\nthey went out and did everything that\nthey had wanted to do\nand up until that point i'm like i i'm\nlike i'm doing nothing i don't know what\ni'm doing i like brought the case to\nlike supervision a bunch um\nand then yeah like they just turned\naround like oh yeah this has been super\nhelpful like i have a great\nunderstanding of everything\nthanks and it was it was good after that\ngreat yeah so i think that's where it's\nit's interesting but even in psychiatry\nwe have a saying that all boats rise\ntogether\nand so i think a big part of what we do\nin coaching is helping people like and\npeople do this in therapy as well i mean\nit's like a general observation of\nhumans that a lot of times you know\nthere's some fundamental things that\nhold us that keep us from like moving\nforward in multiple dimensions of our\nlives\nand so i i think part of the key thing\ndid somebody else want to share before\nwe move on\ni have a success case if i'm sure go for\nit um i had a client who\nwe spent like maybe like four or five\nweeks really trying to get him like\noutside of his house he like spent a\nwhole bunch of time indoors um and like\ncould never really get there and then\nhe really wanted to go for a walk down\nthe street to get some like some\nbreakfast and one day he did or so like\nwe had our session he had his week he\nhad he then later told me that on the\nfirst day he went out and did it\nrealized it actually wasn't too bad and\nlike went like another three or four\ntimes and went to the gym twice that\nweek and like all of a sudden just\ncrushed all his goals it was really\nnow he's a crusher\nyeah so so i know it sounds kind of\nweird but what we're gonna explain to\ny'all over the next four days is why\nthat happens\nokay we're gonna start to talk a little\nbit about like so we've we've figured\nthis out so on the back end at hg what\nwe've done is like done all these\ncalculations it goes into the way that\ny'all like the curriculum that we put\nyou all through and so y'all are already\ndoing it and now we're going to kind of\nbump you all up to the next level by\nteaching you all how that happens and\nwhy that happens so the first thing that\ni want to share about motivation is that\nit's an emergent property and so what i\nmean by that is if we listen to what\ny'all are saying y'all are saying okay\nthere's like emotions involved there's\nlike likelihood of success involved\nthere are all these different variables\nthat go into motivation and the\nchallenge with like um issues of\nmotivation is that\nwhen a client feels like they're not\nmotivated like\nwhat they see is an emergent property\nright so what we're gonna see from from\neli's case for example is someone who's\ndoing all their things from david's case\nit's someone who's crushing it on all\nlevels and then the question kind of\nbecomes like well\nhow do i duplicate that so when we look\nat so motivation is a term and this is\nwhy i don't think there's a sanskrit\nword for motivation\nit's a term that is\ndesigned from external observation so if\nyou look within yourself you won't find\nmotivation you'll find emotions you'll\nfind desires you'll find things that you\ncare about\nbut motivation is something when i look\nat someone who's crushing it on the\noutside and i look at them and i make a\njudgment from the outside i call them\nmotivation\nso motivation is almost like this\nemergent property that people see from\nthe outside and if you go and you talk\nto someone who goes to the gym every day\ni know it sounds kind of weird but they\nwon't say that they're highly motivated\nit's not like they get up every day and\nare like filled with like passion and\nlike yeah like i'm gonna go to the gym\nit's just like they're like no it's just\nkind of like what i do now you know i\njust it makes me feel better but there's\nsort of this idea of like\nof motivation which is built from people\nstanding on the outside and watching\nsomeone else and saying oh wow that\nperson must be like intrinsically driven\nin some deep and profound way that i\ndon't feel and the reason that they make\nthat conclusion is because on the inside\nwhat they feel is something deep and\nprofound that keeps them stuck\nso as we kind of understand motivation\nwhat we're going to try to do is unpack\nlike what are all of the things that go\ninto it and as we unpack all of the\ndifferent variables of motivation my\nhope is that y'all as coaches will be\nable to help their clients figure out\nlike what's the problem here and this is\nalso why we have a a gigantic motivation\nlike industry we have tons of\ninformation about motivation and we have\nthe least motivated generation like in\nthe history of humanity i don't know if\nthat's actually factually true or not\nthat's how it feels\nand so it's kind of interesting because\nhow can we account for sort of like this\ndiscrepancy between all the information\nthat's out there and how unmotivated\npeople are and we'll kind of get to that\ni think the issue is that\nyou know when i look at a life hack or i\nlook at like a success youtuber\nthey're not going to be able to like\ntailor what they say to me right there's\nno process of like interaction where we\ncan figure out okay which advice is\nactually the advice that i should follow\nso we have people like consuming all\nthis advice and like not making changes\nin their life so the real advantage and\nthis is where i think this is your duty\nas a coach is to understand all these\ndifferent dimensions and help a client\nfigure out okay what are we dealing with\nhere is this an issue of a hump god is\nthis an issue among us is this an issue\nwhere like you feel too much emotion or\nnegative shame is this an issue where\nthere are people around you who are like\nyou know preventing you from being your\nbest self like do you have like you know\nyour gamer buddies like\nmessaging you you know at 5 p.m every\nday and want you to get on and like play\ngames with them like how does that\nimpact your motivation the next day\nso as a coach really the key thing here\nis that as we teach you this model like\nyou need to take this model and apply it\nto your clients so that you can guide\nthem in a more specific manner there's\nalso other advantages to that which\nwe'll kind of get to\nquestions about that\nokay so kind of the analogy that i'd use\nabout motivation just to kind of wrap up\nis remember i kind of called it an\nemergent property and so the thing about\nemergent properties is that any\nindividual component\ndoes not appear to be like irresponsible\nfor what we see\nand just like you know you can look at a\num a uh\njust like you can look at\nlike a bird right and you can look at\nthe property of flight it's not the\nmuscle that creates flight it's not the\nbone that creates flight it's not the\nthe wing that creates light and what\nhappens is we have clients that look\naround and they see other birds flying\nand they themselves don't see themselves\nflying and so then what happens is they\njust\nend up basically like um\nuh\nyou know they end up trying to figure\nout why can't i fly and it's your job as\na coach to basically help them figure\nout okay what's what's the part of your\nwing that's busted\nokay\nokay so\num next thing that we're gonna do\nis so any questions about that\nokay\nso now we're gonna get started with goal\nsetting and motivation\num let me just go ahead and screen share\nthis with y'all\num\nand then\nlet's see here\ngive me one second so let's\ngo to screen share and change\nokay\nand then\nlet's go here okay\nso our model for goal setting\nand motivation is built on a couple of\ncore concepts okay\nthe first is that um\nnot all people are the same\nso your job as a coach\nis to help people find a customizable\nsolution to their individual or to their\nproblems okay\nthe second thing is that good\ngood diagnosis\nprecedes good treatment\nand if we look at the efficacy of a\ncoach\num you know you aren't diagnosing or\ntreating anything\nbut\nyour efficacy as a coach and why we help\nclients is because like they're actually\nnot good diagnosticians they will look\nat themselves and they won't actually\naccurately diagnose where their\nmotivational problems are\num\nand then the third thing is going to be\na little bit contradictory but while\npersonalized approaches are important\nlike a big part of what we do at\nhealthygamer is that we can rely on\ndisciplines\nto give us framework\nframeworks\nuh to give frameworks so what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna teach all some\nthings from neuroscience psychology\nspirituality and things like that and\nthe key thing here is that if we kind of\nthink about okay could and\nlike couldn't anyone do this and the\nanswer is yes anyone can do this but\nwhat we're going to do is by giving you\nguys these key like takeaways from\ndifferent disciplines you'll be able to\nhelp a client faster and to a greater\ndegree than they would be able to do on\ntheir own because we're going to kind of\ngive you all the information sure and\nanyone out there could go and read about\nneuroscience about psychology about\nbehavioral economics about spirituality\nand if they do enough of that self-study\nthat like they'll be able to figure out\nyou know what works for them eventually\nwhat we try to do as coaches those we we\nhave all of the rel not all but you know\nwe give you guys the most relevant\ninformation and it's your job as a coach\nto apply that information when necessary\nwith your client any questions about\nthat\nokay so now we're gonna have kind of an\ninteresting uh question so here's the\nbasic premise under which we're gonna\nunderstand motivation so who knows what\nthis equation is\nanyone know\nlook familiar\nis that\nvoltage equals current over resistance\nvery good steven bonus points because my\nhandwriting is so bad so who here\nunderstands does anyone know what\nvoltage means\nlike what is voltage\nit's like a measure of electricity right\nlike how how strong it is\nuh it is it is involved in electricity\nso this is ohm's law for people who are\ncurious\nokay\nso let's let's move on to another\nvariable what is the i\ncurrent okay\nso we've got twitch chat helping us out\nso ohm's law says basically that voltage\nlike steven said equals current\nover resistance\nokay\nso if we think about current current is\nwhat we put into the circuit\nit's the energy input okay resistance\nis like what's resistance\nyou could you're controlling the amount\nof current\nit gets\nuh yeah so it's kind of it's the\nresistance right so it's like what takes\naway\nuh how can i say this is like what takes\naway\nwhatever you're trying to do so the\nother way we can think about current law\ntakes away is a terrible definition hold\non let me think about what's a better\ndefinition for this\num\nyou know it's it's the force that\nour current has to act against let's\ncall it that\nuh\nbefore it's a force opposing what we're\ntrying to do\nokay\nand then the voltage is sort of the\npotential difference and the potential\ndifference is like where you start and\nwhere you end up so i'll give you all\nkind of another analogy let's say i have\na pipe\nthat is flowing from the second floor\nto the first floor\nright so the potential difference like\nthis is a measure of voltage is like the\ngravitational potential from here to\nhere is what causes water to move this\nway are we good on that does that make\nsense right because that's a\ngravitational potential energy so when\nyou look at something like a battery\nthat voltage across the battery this may\nnot be an accurate term but if you look\nat like why electrons move from one\npoint like the cathode to the er sorry\nfrom the anode to the cathode there's an\nelectrical potential there like a\nvoltage that causes things to move in a\nparticular direction so this is where we\nstart\nand this is where we end\nokay\nand so i'm going to ask you also if we\nthink about you know how can i get more\nwater over here what are the different\nthings that i can do to increase the\nwater flow that's on this side\nput more water in the pipe yep so you\ncan add more water right so that's\ncurrent we can pump more water and what\nelse can we do\nand uh reduce the resistance yep so we\ncan widen the pipe\nright\nso resistance in in terms of flow\nmechanics is like\nthe width of the pipe so anyone who's\nyou know had bubble tea with a bubble\ntea straw versus like a tiny little\nstraw like you get more liquid if the\nstraw is wider right we can reduce the\nresistance\nwhat else can we do\nwe can put our pipe like this\ndoes that make sense\nso we can\nactivate that gravitational energy like\neven better\nright we can increase the strength of\nthe cathode or the anode so i know it\nsounds kind of weird but i think this is\na fantastic equation to even understand\npsychological resistance\nso there's the goal\nright and like where you want to go\nthere's the energy we put in\nor the intent\nand then there's the resistance\nright so these are things like shame\nemotions\nokay aham god is here too yeah\nit's v equals ir\nuh\nmultiplication not division\noh interesting okay\nuh yeah so that\ntanks particular things but let's stick\nwith this for now\nwe can talk about the current instead\nyeah so i think it's it's still fine\nso just turn resistance into a negative\nyeah let me think about that\na bunch of nerds um\nlet me think about that let me think\nabout that okay i'll get back to y'all\non that\nso let's kind of keep going for now just\nbecause we're in this already um so\nso this is where so as we kind of think\nabout this in terms of like coaching\nwhat we want to do\nis actually think about it this way so\nwhen we think about a behavior there's\nthe intent that people put in\nokay\nthen there's the resistance that they\nhave to overcome\nand then there's the action that they\ntake towards the end\nall right so these are the three\ndimensions that we're going to be\nexploring and in my experience the\nproblem that most people have with goal\nsetting and motivation is that like they\ndon't understand that all three of these\nthings can be acted on okay\nso\nwhat a lot of people will sometimes do\nlet's just talk about willpower for a\nsecond\nso i think like i think about willpower\nis like a limited mana pool\nthat you can use to kind of like power\nthrough this equation so i can just\nexpend a certain amount of willpower to\nlike overcome this resistance hump and\ntake an action\none time\nand then you know i can do that again\nand each time that i like sort of drain\nmy willpower battery oh damn it\nwhat'll happen is like i can take\nactions but it's not sustainable so we\nsee this pattern a lot with students who\nare not happy with the kind of um\nhow can i say this\nwe see this a lot with students who are\nnot like happy with being students so\nthey'll start the semester off with like\na fully charged battery and they'll use\nwillpower to like study for the first\nmonth\nthey'll like dig real deep and study for\nthe first the second month and then like\nby the end of it they're like burnt out\nand they don't really like enjoy what\nthey're doing they never enjoyed what\nthey were doing it was a slog from day\none it's just they were relying on\nwillpower to get there\nso as coaches what we're going to kind\nof focus on is understanding intent\nresistance and action okay\nthese are the three major components\nso\nwhat do i mean by intent\nso so a lot of times people will say\nlike like i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut when your clients have a goal like\nwhere does that goal come from\nwhat do you all think\nusually like desires like that are\nexternal or like you know uh what's the\nword uh in three is right\nokay desires from the indireas\ngood\nindriyas are sense organs\nwhat else where else do does when\nsomeone says i have a goal\ni want to do something where is that\nintent coming from why do they want to\ndo it\nsometimes they it's a desire\nwhat else could it be\ncould be pressure from like culture\nfamily excellent\nokay so i'm gonna call this should\nright so like this is something i want\nto do that's a desire\nthis is something i should do\nwhat else\nwhat else can drive someone to action\ndo people do things that they don't want\nto do and that they should\ndo people do things that they don't want\nto do and that they shouldn't do\nabsolutely yes\nright so this is where we look at other\nthings i'm going to kind of call so yeah\nokay pressure was fine so i'd say that\nwe also do things because we're driven\nby our values so like what drives what\nwe want to do our values and our duty\nso these are kind of the four things\nthat i kind of think of when i think\nabout what goes into intent the other\nkey thing about uh so when we think\nabout these four things the goal of this\nas a coach is like a lot of times people\ndon't realize that\nthe goals they set for themselves aren't\ntruly their goals and so the ability to\nget energy up and engage in those goals\nwhen this is something that i should do\nversus something that i actually like\ncare about so we see this a lot like\nwith you know second generation indians\nis that like everyone wants to be a\ndoctor\nand\nvery few of us actually want to be\ndoctors most of us like should be\ndoctors and there's like societal\npressure to do a particular thing\nwe also see this a lot with our clients\nwho um for example like we don't you\nknow not all of our clients\nare\nd gens\nright so some of our clients are\nactually like you know they have jobs\nand things like that a lot of our\nclients do so sometimes we see this with\nclients who\num for example\nlike they have a job that is very\nsuccessful like they're successful but\nthey feel unfulfilled and how do i like\nhow do i manage that right because i\nshould stay in my job because this is a\ngood job to have\nwhy isn't this\nmy pen busted\nweird okay hold on\num let me just go go to this in a second\nso they may have like a particular thing\nthat they feel like they should do or\nit's dumb to not do this thing there we\ngo\nbut\nwhat they really care about is something\nelse what they value is something else\nso like i may be a successful programmer\nat google but what i care about is like\nrunning d campaigns and telling stories\nand so oftentimes what keeps clients\nstuck is that their intent is not\nclarified so there's a conflict of\nintent\nand this is why they stay stuck\nand so the key thing that we want to do\nhere as coaches is help them clarify\nlike okay what is a desire what's\nsomething that you want\nwhat's something that you should do what\ndo you care about and what are you what\nare you duty bound to do what's your\nobligation\nand it's interesting but just even\nhaving this conversation and helping\npeople realize that oh this is something\nthat you should do but it's not\nsomething that you want to do\ndo you all think once someone\nunderstands that are they more likely or\nless likely to engage in the behavior\nmore likely\nwhy do you say that eli\nthey're not trying to fight their\nemotions anymore they can validate how\nthey feel about it and it kind of\nnaturally\nlike reduces the intensity of that\nperfect so this is this i know it's kind\nof weird but like i'm going to give you\nall like a scenario okay i'm curious i'm\nsure you all have heard this from your\nclients but okay i need to do x\ni can't\ndo x\ntherefore\ni'm\nan idiot\nso we see this a lot in people with adhd\ni should be able to do x\nand then let me ask you something\nwhat do you think this statement\ndoes to their ability to like engage in\naction and how does that affect their\nmotivation\nit strengthens the hum car and makes it\nharder to act because now your identity\nis like you know i suck at doing stuff\nso how can i ever do it exactly\nso\nthis is the key thing so another key\nthing that we're going to do in terms of\nintent we can clarify these intents but\nremember that when people are stuck\noftentimes they're ambivalent\nright can someone explain what\nambivalence\nmeans about one thing on the fence\nwhat did you say stephen\njust thought you were feeling two ways\nabout one thing yeah feeling two ways\nright so this is the other thing so when\nwhen human beings don't engage in a\nbehavior\nright they're\nconflicted there's like a pro side and a\ncon side and one of the biggest\nchallenges that our clients recognize is\nthat they never see the con side they're\nblind to it so i'll give you all an\nexample like they say oh i should study\ninstead of playing games all day\nso they don't see like\nit's one dimensional for them this is\ngonna sound kind of abstract but all\nthey see is what they should do like\nthey have their eyes set on the goal and\nthat's all they're focused on\nwhat they don't see is what they gain by\nplaying games all day\nthey don't see the other side of the\nequation and so this is what creates\nthis kind of this mentality over here\nthis is this is a thought process that's\ncreated from blindness\nit's a thought process that people don't\nrealize that they can't do x for a very\ngood reason there's something within\nthem that is keeping them from doing x\nright and it's not just that they're\nundisciplined it's that they may have\nsome kind of fear or they have this id\nlike this this identity which is telling\nthem and we'll get to this in a second\nlike an identity that's telling them oh\nyou're gonna fail so don't bother and\nthat's the reason that they can't do it\nis because there's literally a br a part\nof their brain\nthat is calculating the likelihood of\nsuccess so there's a there's a part of\nour brain that continually makes a\ncalculation that is like what is what\nare the pros what are the cons what's\nthe risk what's the benefit or what's\nthe what's the benefit what's the cost\nand what's the likelihood of success\nit's sort of like benefit\nminus cost\ntimes\nlikelihood of success\nis a calculation that our mind is always\ndoing\nanytime we're like doing anything and\nthen that sort of results in behavior or\nnot behavior\nand so what people don't recognize is\nthat there's like actually a benefit to\nbeing unmotivated\nso a big part of what we do here in\nterms of how we deal with intent we're\ngoing to spend a whole day on this is\nwe're going to talk about clarifying\ndesires you know shoulds values and\nduties\nand when we do this with clients like\nthey'll be i don't it's like magic\nthey'll just be like more prone to\num\nengage in the right behavior\nand it's hard to describe but when you\ngive human beings\nan open-ended or like sort of an honest\nassessment of what something will cost\nthem they're more likely to pay that\ncost for the benefit so by clarifying\nfor people like oh if you stop playing\nvideo games and you start going to class\nyou're gonna be behind you're gonna feel\nbehind you're gonna no matter how hard\nyou study you won't be able to get an a\nand if you kind of think about it like\nthat's devastating for your motivation\nand by helping clients understand that\nno matter how hard you work now the\nhighest grade you can get as a b you can\nget a hundred percent on every single\ntest from here on out and the best you\ncan get as a bee\nthat crushes people subconsciously it\nkeeps them from ever engaging in the\nbehavior but when you make that cost\ntransparent to them once they really\nunderstand and digest that cost\nthey are much more likely to engage in\nthe behavior\nand so this kind of hidden cost that\nthey don't realize is also where their\nambivalence comes from because there's a\nsubconscious part of their mind that\ndoesn't want to pay that cost and we\nknow from from evidence-based\nmotivational interviewing that\nclarifying ambivalence leads people in\nthe right direction right so there have\nbeen lots of studies we teach all some\nmotivational interviewing techniques how\nyou play with that ambivalence and this\nis the really interesting thing i had a\nreally cool case from\nuh someone presented a case in case\nreview where someone had a client who is\ndoing something incredibly idiotic like\njust making terrible decision after\nterrible decision after terrible\ndecision is it related to a particular\nrelationship\nand so the coach like was tearing their\nhair out and they're like this is a\nterrible idea you just need to go no\ncontact with this person and cut this\nperson out of your life and every time\nthat their client tells\nthis story to their friends their\nfriends say the same thing you need to\ngo no contact with this person go no no\ncontact with this person this person is\ntoxic\nand then the coach was like i have no\nidea how to get my client to see\nthat this is a terrible relationship\nthat you're engaging in and you should\ngo no contact with them\nbut interestingly enough they resisted\nthat impulse they didn't play into the\nthe drama that the client was recruiting\nthem in because\nwhat do you think happens so\nif if your client tells you something\nthat you think is idiotic and you tell\nthem it's idiotic how is that going to\naffect their behavior are they going to\nkeep doing it or are they going to\nlisten to you and stop doing it\nthey're probably going to double down\nabsolutely right and that's the key\nthing i know it sounds bizarre that's\nthe key learning from motivational\ninterviewing\nso when you you know when you try to\npush someone in a particular direction\nin terms of behavior there's a decent\nchance that the the if you're kind of\npushing this way\nand they're ambivalent about it oh you\nneed to stop [ __ ] smoking like it's\nterrible for me you're gonna die and\nlike everyone hates it you're so bad at\nsmoking oh my god like stop the smoking\noh my god what they're gonna do is\nthey're gonna double down and push back\ntwice as hard\nso this is where reflective listening\nand sort of playing with that\nambivalence and even holding the side\nof oh it sounds like you know you this\nperson must mean a lot to you because\nit's clear that they're like really\nscrewing with your life so the\nrelationship must be really important to\nyou in some way when you say something\nlike that like what is the client gonna\nsay\nyou guys seen this play out before in\ncoaching\nyeah usually like some amount of\nconfusion and just like thinking about\nit like oh [ __ ] like huh you know that\nkind of thing exactly right so when you\nkind of say oh like it sounds like this\nrelationship is really important to you\nbecause they're super toxic and\neveryone's telling you to go no contact\nwith them they must be like super\namazing and then they're like kind of\nconfused because that's not usually what\nthey hear and then they start thinking\nabout it and when they start thinking\nabout it that's when the change begins\nto happen\nright it's really interesting\nso this is the intent so what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to work with\nambivalence which you guys should be\npretty familiar with we're going to\nteach you guys how to clarify your\nclient's intent\nand for some people like this is the\nproblem like they're just\ntheir intent is confused the next thing\nin terms of resistance\nso when someone has a clear intent and\nthey try to engage in a in a um you know\na problem so it's a v equals ir right\noops\nso there's resistance over here\nand so you know the the greater the\nresistance the less likely they are to\nengage in um the behavior right\nso the two main contributions of\nresistance are manas or emotions\nand ahamkar or in our ego\nokay what do y'all think about that\ni mean that's straight facts yeah\nthat's not a lot to say so we'll go into\nmore detail you know so we have a whole\nday about this\nso the other interesting thing is that\nresistance manifests\nas stuck behaviors\nokay\nso what this means is like when people\nare like watching youtube all day\nwhen they're doing drugs when they're\ngaming all day\nyou know when they're procrastinating\nlike all these things are like\nmanifestations of resistance so if you\nkind of think about like why do our\nclients like watch youtube all day like\nwhat does that do for them\nkeeps them in the present\nabsolutely right\nwhat's another way to put it\nsteven here also mindfulness chad\nit just kind of looks like i mean\nthe youtube and drugs and all that stuff\nshuts off a lot of the mundus and active\nhum car and things like that absolutely\nright so the youtube so the other way to\nlook at is we can look at neuroscience\narticles about on internet addiction\nand if we do an fmri study\nwhich is a study of blood flow to the\nbrain what we can what we discover from\nthese like various you know articles on\ninternet addiction is that fmri studies\ndemonstrate that these activities\nshut down negative emotions circuits\nso what they're essentially doing is\nactually self-medicating against this\ncrap over here\nand oftentimes i'm sure you all\nunderstand this as well like what is\narguing with strangers on the internet\ndue to your ahamkar\nit's like really fun\nfantastic it really feeds into it boosts\nthe ahamka and remember that the ahamkar\nbecomes active when\nwhat activates the ahamkar what does it\ndo\nit's like a threat that protects you so\nif i feel like a failure\nand i go argue and school some noob on\nthe internet how do i feel\nyou feel good that you're like pumping\nyourself up yeah right i'm owning these\nnoobs\nwho cares that i'm 28 years old and\nliving in my mom's basement i'm owning\nnoobs on the internet i'm on the libs\nyou know\ni'm i'm owning the conservatives i'm a\nstrong social justice warrior and i do\nlots of virtue signaling\nsignaling or\ni i'm owning the libs like it goes\neither way like whatever it is it's all\na hum card\nand so what people will do is like the\nworse they feel about themselves the\nmore they'll engage with these kinds of\nthings and this is what's great like so\nthis is where it gets really devastating\nbut you know there are platforms like\ntwitter and youtube and stuff that like\nrecognize that engaging people involves\nlike activating their own god\nyou know so people get pissed off on\ntwitter so much like why is that it's\nbecause no one can make like a fair or\nnuanced argument it's all just\nemotionally charged crap that people are\nreacting to\nright there's no way to have a\ndiscussion over twitter you can have an\nargument over twitter\nyou know like but like\nyou know i don't know if you all saw the\njimmy from philly interview but like\njimmy from philly interview is\nimpossible to have over twitter you have\nto like actually have a conversation you\ncan argue with jimmy from philly\nyou could tell him he's dumb and he can\ntell you that you're dumb\nthat works great so it's kind of\ninteresting but all of these things that\nwe see in this generation like we need\nto understand these principles and as a\ncoach it's your job to help them\novercome their resistance\nand kind of work through some of these\nbehaviors and get them in the direction\nthat they want to go\ni would say that resistance is probably\nthe biggest blind spot for our clients\nand this is why oftentimes we'll do\nthings that clients will be kind of\nconfused about and they'll say like is\nthis something i should be talking to\nour my therapist about because you're\nkind of focusing on negative emotions\nand you can absolutely talk to the\ntherapist about it this is where it\ncomes back to what the goals are because\nwhat everyone in our community knows is\nthey know what they need to do\nthey just don't understand why they\ncan't do it and why they can't do it so\nlike i know i have a clear intent i need\nto do this thing so it's this part over\nhere that they're blind to\nand so that's what we have to help them\novercome\nso the way that we practically are going\nto do that is you know we're going to\nuse like reflective listening and be\ncompassionate and authentic and all that\ngood stuff we're going to call them out\non their bs\nright when we sort of sniff it out\nsometimes but we're gonna do it for the\npurpose of growth\nand as we kind of explore this stuff\nwith them as we sort of decompress them\non us as they no longer feel ashamed no\nlonger feel afraid you know their ego no\nlonger needs to activate and once their\nego gets out of the way what's left\nwhat's running the show afterward anyone\nremember\nwhat's the third part of the mind that\nwe want to be operating from\nintellect\nyep\nand this is the big problem if you guys\num you know have watched dr k's guide\nhopefully people will understand this\nconcept\nbut the the big problem is that everyone\nthinks that they're they're operating on\nintellect all the time but oftentimes\nit's a god controlling the internet the\nin intellect\nand so what happens is they have a lot\nof uh\nbiases right they think that they're\nbehaving perfectly logically and the\nperson they're arguing with thinks\nthey're behaving perfectly logically as\nwell everyone's perfectly logical\nbecause it's my mind is logical right\ni'm not irrational everyone else is\nirrational but as long as the ahamkar is\ncontrolling the buddhi the conclusions\nof the buddha are going to be incorrect\nso this is the problem is that they all\nthink they're operating well and this is\nwhy it's tricky as a coach but helping\nthem recognize their blind spots in\nterms of emotion is how you're going to\novercome the resistance we'll give you\nall more techniques and more details on\nthat\nlater\nand this is also what's kind of\nfrustrating for a lot of a lot of our\nclients is when they have resistance\nit's kind of like a blocked pipe and so\nthen what they do is they're pumping\nmore stuff into this end right\nand like this is what leads to burnout\nand frustration\nbecause they're kind of focusing on like\nbuilding up motivation and dumping\nenergy into the system and they dump\nmore energy and they dump more energy\nand more energy whereas all it really\ntakes is an elegant solution of reducing\nthis resistance clearing that blockage\nand then suddenly the amount of energy\nthey need to put in the system is\nactually less and they get more output\nand this is where if we go back to the\ncases that we heard earlier people were\nlike it wasn't they weren't doing\nanything they weren't doing anything\nthey weren't doing and suddenly they're\ncrushing all their goals like how the\n[ __ ] does that work it's because y'all\nare removing that resistance in the\nmiddle and then suddenly they it starts\nflowing and it feels natural and this is\nthe thing because when people think\nabout motivation they think like oh my\ngod it's like i have to like work really\nhard uh no true motivation is like feels\nvery natural it actually feels\neffortless and that's what we want to\nshoot for with our clients\nokay\num another thing that i should mention\nso oftentimes this resistance is also a\nsum scott\ni guess that goes without saying with\ny'all but you know just for the sake of\ncompleteness\nand then we get to the third dimension\nwhich is action\nso this is probably the area healthy\ngamer that we've been the least\nsupportive of y'all with\nwe really could have done a better job\nand that's actually the main thing\naround this um\nuh you know this training is a big part\nof that so at the end of the day\nsetting the right kind of goals is like\nreally really important for our clients\nso we've got a couple of steps here\nfirst is understand the person\nso i'm going to ask you all a couple of\nquestions\nhow do your clients decide what goal to\npick\nwhere do their goals come from\nwhen they want to change them\nokay should do go ahead ken\nwhen they want to change something about\nthemselves but how do they know that\nthat's something that they should change\nor in what way they're going to change\nit\nthey look around a lot and see\nother people doing stuff or being things\nall right so what what games y'all play\ngames\nwhat do y'all play\nleague\nokay league noob okay\nso like you know this is kind of\ninteresting because but like\nso what you know if i i let's say i\nwatch a video on league and i see some\npro player like owning with this hero or\nchampion right and then i'm like oh like\nif i want to own games\nand climb and gain gain mmr like i need\nto play that hero how effective is that\nis a strategy to like win at league\nterrible\nwhy\nbut your character choice isn't why\nyou're winning or\nlosing but no pax dude i saw this guy he\nwas crushing with his hero\nyeah well maybe if you were more of a\nsigma male you would have like won with\nthat character\nokay\nright so it's interesting so like this\nhappens all the time in dota 2 where\nlike you know you'll look at what other\npeople are owning with and you're like\noh like i just happens all the time so i\ndon't know if you guys have had this\nexperience where you get owned by a\nparticular hero in a game and it's like\nnext like that's so easy it's so broken\noh my god it's so op in the next game\nwhen you queue up you're like i'm gonna\npick that op hero it's gonna be an easy\nwin it's so broken what happens\nyou get crushed\nabsolutely right so i want you all to\nthink about this because this is this is\nlegit okay\nthat's literally how our community picks\ntheir goals they look at some random ass\nperson and they say look at what that\nperson did to be successful let me just\nmimic what they did and then i will be\nsuccessful and then they get crushed\nbecause steven's spot on they look\naround for their goals\nokay one of my first coaching clients\never\ngot out of jail\nand i was like\nhe's like i need to find a job and i was\nlike how are you like what kind of job\ndo you want and he's like well\ni have a buddy who works at a car wash\nso i guess i'll work there and it's like\nhold on a second bro take a big step\nback\nyou know you've got two weeks of like\nstuff where you have to find a job\nbefore you start working at the car wash\nlet's think about like what all of your\noptions are so after talking to him for\na long time and like working through\nstuff he started to get a job at a car\nwash but he also like started getting\ninto emt training became an emt started\nworking as an emt for a while then like\nwent into the med tech field and then is\nnow like a\nlike a medical device rep or something\nlike that\nbut most of what where our clients goals\ncome from is just like what they see\nother people doing oh it worked for this\nperson\nit worked for you know reading one book\na day is how this person made a million\ndollars so i'm going to start reading\none book a day\nso the first thing that we want to do in\nterms of setting the right at the right\ngoals is understand the person and a lot\nof times like they don't do this step\nright they focus on they look outside of\nthemselves to try to figure out what the\nright goal is this can be very\nfrustrating for our clients because\nthey're coming the first week and\nthey'll be like how do i fix my life\ngive me the plan\nbut we can't give them the plan yet we\nhave to understand who they are first\nthen we can worry about the plan okay\nso\num\nyou know understand the person the\nsecond thing is set appropriate goals\nand there are a couple of techniques\nhere that we're going to teach all\nright so so it's not going to be you set\nthe goal for them it's the two y'all are\ngoing to like work together to set the\nright goal and then you know you're\ngoing to develop an action plan\nthey're going to try it and when they\ntry what's going to happen\nthey going to do it\nthey're going to fail\nthey're going to fail excellent then\nwhat's your job as a coach\nprovide compassion through their trial\nand error\nexcellent\nbecause here's the big thing\nright so when i when i set a goal for\nmyself and i fail like that creates all\nthe crap\nmana sahamkar all that sort of stuff so\nas a coach we're going to help them pick\npick themselves up off the ground dust\nthemselves off and try again right so\nwe're going to provide emotional support\nand we're also going to provide feedback\nso we're going to be a lens because in\nthat mindset like it's hard to be\nobjective right so we're going to be\nobjective for them and we're going to\ntry to figure things out and then\nessentially\nour you know\nour goal setting and like accountability\nuh you know approach as coaches is\niterative\nwho knows what this word means\nmeans you have to iterate which means\neach time something goes wrong you\nchange one thing and you keep doing that\nuntil you find something that works yep\nperfect right\nso we want to set appropriate so as a\ngoal we want to set uh as coaches we\nwant to set appropriate goals\nthese goals should\nfactor in\nstrengths and weaknesses\nof the client\nright\nnext thing that we need to do\nsupport them when they screw up\nand then fourth thing is iterate\nhow can we okay how can we do it better\nnext time\nand so in my experience when y'all do\nthis\nokay when you clarify intent when you\nwork with their resistance when you set\nappropriate goals\nthis is how you help someone change\ntheir life\nquestions\nyeah i had one question about the um\nyou said your first client you know he\ngot out of jail and then you know he was\nlike okay i should start working at the\ncar wash because my friend is there the\nway you told the story it sounds like\nyou know you kind of immediately kind of\nlike he said that and then you were like\nwell hang on like let's think about this\num\ni don't know if that's how it actually\npanned out or if that was just like the\nsummary version because you know my\nunderstanding is like sometimes like you\nknow it kind of depends on where you're\nat with like the relationship sometimes\nlike\nputting the brakes on something\nyou know like those that kind of\nassumption is like\nyou know you kind of have to like let it\nride for a little bit first before you\ncan like actually explore alternatives\nbut it sounds like the way you told it\nwas like you went straight to there\nyeah so i'll tell you what i did i think\nyou all would handle this\nyou all would have done the same\nbasically um so i basically asked him\nhelp me understand\nor let me ask you so if your client\nlet's see if y'all's\ni'll just say so i asked him like help\nme understand like how you came to the\nconclusion to work at the car wash\nright\nand then i asked like you know simple\nopen-ended questions that made him\nrealize that he had like huge errors in\nhis thought process and catalyzed change\nwhich is what else did you consider\nand he was like\ni didn't consider anything else that's\nnot what he said he's like i don't know\nright so like people don't so this is\nthe big problem this is why y'all are\nuseful to be blunt is because people\ndon't they're blind to their own blind\nspots\nright that's the biggest problem so if\nwe think about like why people stay\nstuck like human beings are smart\nespecially our community\nlike if they understand a problem\ncorrectly they will fix it themselves so\nby definition the problems that people\nget stuck on are the ones that are\nmisdiagnosed this is a concept that\nstarted with carl jung and he kind of\nsaid like everyone has a shadow and the\nmost growth that a human being can have\nis in looking at the shadow because the\nshadow is the part of yourself that by\ndefinition you neglect to look at\nand so like most of the things like if\nthere's one part of the world that's\nlike forbidden\nthat's where there's the most\nopportunity for discovery\ndoes that make sense facts\noh for sure\nright so so like in terms of how i\nworked with this person so i asked him\nlike what else did you consider and he's\nlike\nwhat\nthat's not how he operates right he\ndoesn't like he doesn't think about\napproaching his life in a systematic way\nhe just kind of like does what he sees\nother people doing which is how most of\nus do it\nit's how our brain let's monkey see\nmonkey do right that's how like you\nthink about how you learn slang\nlike how does that happen there's no\nintent\nthere are like circuits in your brain\nthat are literally designed\nto adjust your behavior based on what\nyou see and shape your behavior\ni don't know if you all have ever like\nlived in a different country where there\nwas like a social custom that like\npeople there didn't do\nso for me it's like shaking hands\nit's like i went to india and i'd like\nshake people's hands and they were like\nconfused\nbecause they don't do that there and\nafter a while i kind of stopped\nright so i just like and so there's like\nliterally a part of my brain that's like\nconstantly adjusting how i\nview situations\nand then over time i started asking\nquestions like what do you care about\nyou know like do you are you passionate\nabout car washes like do you want to be\nan entrepreneur do you want to open up\nyour own car wash one day he's like no\nand he's like what he cared about was\nexcitement so his options were like join\nthe military or like do something else\nthat's exciting\nso i would ask him like what do you find\nexciting he's like i think combat would\nbe cool\ni was like okay what else\nand he's like well like\nmaybe like being a police officer\nand like we kind of stumbled on empty\nand i was like okay like maybe if you\nwant to you know go into combat\nmaybe emt training would be helpful and\nhe hated school like he hates he hated\nemt training but he was totally fine\ndoing gave it 100 because like oh\nlike this is going to be useful for me\neven though i detest doing it going to\nschool for the purpose\nof like it's good for me is not a good\nmotivator\neven doing school that you detest doing\nbecause he wants to live an exciting\nlife he doesn't want to sit in a\nclassroom somewhere and telling him hey\nif you like wind up in combat somewhere\nmaybe it'll be useful to get emt skills\nand he's like yeah i can get behind that\nand then he's motivated\nright and then you do like further work\nwith him you ask him you know why are\nyou craving excitement things like that\nyou kind of get deeper and deeper and\nthen eventually he ends up with one of\nthe most boring jobs in the universe or\nmaybe it's exciting i don't know\nhe's a medical device rep\nhe likes his job he's happy\nhas the added benefit of you know lower\nchance of casualty\nother questions\nyeah i'm curious where like focus or\nattention comes into play like\nmotivation or like the intent resistance\naction\nthe focusing of attention\nyeah like focus attention stuff like\nthat\nso we'll get into that so there's stuff\num that there's a lot of stuff that has\nto do with motivation which is a little\nbit outside the scope of coaching but\nwhen we think about that intent so focus\nis there is what i would put on the\nintent side so if we think about like if\ncheck out i don't know if you all have\nwatched if you all watch the video on\ndaruna the origin of motivation and dr\nk's guide\nyou'll gone through that\nyep\nso\nyou know there's a lot of stuff there\nbut basically if we think about how do\nyou sustain motivation i recognize that\nwe just sort of said motivation isn't\none thing but i'd say that\nfocusing your attention is like the\nmajor way of doing it and where does\nattention\nfit into that graph it fits into the\nintention side it's the energy that you\nput in so the more focused your mind is\nthe more like cognitive energy you can\nleverage into a particular thing\nwouldn't it also come into play into\naction to keep yourself like focused on\nwhat you're doing\nyes you could definitely put it there\num\nthat has probably more to do with the\nway that i'm defining action which is\nlike around appropriate goal setting\nand adjusting expectations and things\nlike that so it's absolutely a part of\nlike physically what they have to do yes\nabsolutely but in terms of and so this\nis what's a little bit different about\ntalking about motivation in general and\ntalking about it as a coach\nso what we're doing here is trying to\nhelp you\nfigure out how can you like essentially\nlike increase you know the gravity of\ntheir situation so that\nthe the potential difference between\nwhere they want to go and where they are\nwhere they are and where they want to go\nis like easy for them that's your goal\nas a coach\nright so an example of that is you know\nyou all know the the you know the half\nof half rule in terms of goal setting\nyou guys have picked this up yet\nso in terms of goal setting what we\nrecommend is think about where you are\nthink about where you want to go cut\nthat in half and then cut that in half\nagain that should be your first target\nso that's something that the parent\nprogram\nwas very successful because of like that\nprinciple because all these parents like\nhave this idea that they want they want\nto transform their kids into like you\nknow 4.0 valedictorians who are playing\nsports and you know\nlearning a musical instrument just like\nain't going to happen\nyou got to like adjust your expectations\nand start small\nand then like over time like it's\ninteresting because we can get 100 of\nthe way there like it's absolutely\npossible\nwe just want to start in a particular\nway as a coach you want to help your\nclient set a goal for themselves that\nthey can achieve and then like build on\nthat success\nand then the challenge we'll get to this\nin the goal setting but\nthe challenge with that is that they're\ngoing to say like what is a client going\nto say if they say oh i want to like i\nneed to like you know get a 4.0 and you\ntell them like why don't you start with\na 2.0 what's their resistance going to\nbe that's not good enough exactly right\nso that's where you do the work as a\ncoach of helping them let go of that\nidea\nlike not good enough is not a reason to\nkeep from acting\nyou got to start somewhere like if you\nend up with a 4.0 great\nbut if you open if you never crack the\nbook\nbecause you're saying to yourself\nwhatever i do today is not going to be\ngood enough that's a self-fulfilling\nprophecy which is why they believe it in\nthe first place\nbecause what they've tried in the past\nhas not been enough\nso you got to get underneath that and\nlike help them dismantle the idea of\nlike not good enough it's not a thing\nthere's only action\nyou"
