    "transcript": "so\nyou know i just want to start\ntoday by sharing with you guys a little\nbit about why i left harvard so um\nyou know and this kind of story sort of\nstarts with i want to the reason i want\nto share this is because\nwhen we think about being successful or\nbeing a failure and we think about okay\nwhat do i want to do with my life a lot\nof times what we do is we define success\nas a particular external goal\nso like for example we'll say like you\nknow oh like being an engineer at google\nor like being on a film set for like\nnetflix\nor being a best-selling author or you\nknow being faculty at harvard medical\nschool is like\nhow we sort of define success\nand for a lot of us what we tend to do\nis we kind of think about okay if i\ndon't feel like i'm successful or i want\nto be successful what i'll kind of do is\npick that external target and i'll say\nlike okay if i\nachieve that then i will be successful\nso when we think a little bit about\nwhat's the nature of success what we\nsort of think about is an external\ntarget\nthe interesting thing is that being\nsuccessful as a person if you think\nabout that framework has nothing to do\nwith you right like the the checkbox of\nsuccess has nothing to do with you as an\nindividual it's just completely an\nexternal criteria so people who go to\nharvard are successful that's just\nthat's kind of how we define it and\nthere's no individuality there's no\nsense of like who who that person is or\nwhat they want or what they care about\nthere's no um kind of emphasis on your\npersonal strengths or your ability to\nlike make contributions to the world\nwhen we think about success all we sort\nof really think about is an external\nkind of perspective\nand so that's something that you know\nover time what i've come to figure out\nis that um\nyou know what we kind of consider as\nsuccessful has not actually\nsort of led to\nme kind of being successful i i i know\nit sounds kind of bizarre but a lot of\nlike my best decisions in life and a lot\nof the things that i i think are um\nreally that i'm grateful for and proud\nof actually come from not moving towards\nsuccess but actually like\nmoving away from success\nand what i mean by that is there have\nbeen lots of times in my life where like\nsomething didn't feel right even though\non paper it was the right choice and i\nthink we're increasingly living in a\nworld where like following what\ninternally feels like it resonates with\nyou and sort of like following kind of\nlike not to sound corny but like\nfollowing your heart actually does lead\nto some of the best outcomes and if we\nreally think about what what makes you\nkind of the most successful it has to be\nthe things that are individual to you\nand so i guess you know like many places\nyou know the way that this story is\ngoing to start is like me failing out of\ncollege\nand you know when i was in high school\nlike and people were asking me like what\nwhat do i want to be when i i grow up\nyou know i was the parent i mean i was a\nchild of two doctors both of my parents\nwere doctors\nand so i i realized that like being a\ndoctor is a cool thing and was like\nsocially respected i didn't sort of\nunderstand this consciously but i sort\nof recognized that like oh people who\nare doctors like get respect and like\nthat's what i wanted i was like a\nteenager like you know not in very good\nphysical shape had trouble talking to\ngirls like didn't have a whole lot of\nfriends got bullied a lot like more in\nmiddle school and stuff less so in high\nschool\nlearned how to be invisible in high\nschool\nand so realize that like you know i\nwanted respect and if i become a doctor\nlike that's how i'm going to get\npeople's respect so i would people would\nask me like what do you want to be when\nyou grow up and i would say i want to be\na doctor and people would be like\nimpressed like right there\nand so i was like great so i was gonna\nand then i had dreams actually of you\nknow when i started college and and sort\nof\nmajored in pre-med that i was gonna be\nlike i was gonna be an awesome doctor\nand i was gonna be the best and i was\ngonna go to the best place and i was\ngonna go to harvard and all that kind of\nstuff right like most other you know\nfreshman pre-meds i had big big\nambitions for myself\nand that quickly didn't work out for me\nright because i had no real reason to do\nit it was just all about ego and\nsatisfying other people and living up to\nan external standard of success it had\nnothing to do with what i cared about it\nhad nothing to do with what i was\naligned towards it had nothing to do\nwith what i was interested in it's all\nfor the sake of external success so no\nsurprise i got a whopping like 1.2 gpa\nor something my first year in college\nlike i was on academic probation\num you know which is like i got like an\nd average basically like got like a a b\nmaybe a couple of c's and a few f's\nand so you know that wasn't working out\nfor me well and so like at some point i\ndecided that after my sophomore year i\nincreased my grades a little bit was\nlike solid like 2.2 gpa kind of student\nand so realize that like you know this\nwasn't working and so i went to india\nand what i found in india was awesome i\nabsolutely loved it and i was like oh\nyou know what's also like super cool and\nsuper respectable is becoming a monk and\nlike forsaking worldly things and all\nthose noobs who are chasing success and\ntrying to be the best at everything and\ngetting 4.0 gpas they're all\nmaterialistic and you know what i'm\ngoing to be better than them i'm going\nto be not materialistic so all those\nsuckers over there who are succeeding at\nthe things that i failed at i'm going to\ndevalue them in my mind by setting a\ngoal for myself that's lost loftier and\nin kind of bonus points because that\ngoal actually involves like not really\nplaying their game to begin with so i\ndecided you know my ego took an\ninteresting spin and i decided okay i'm\ngonna become a monk right because that's\neven cooler like i'm gonna forsake my\nworldly things\nand so then i was like a monk were\nplanning on becoming a monk for a while\nso trained for several years and spent\ntime you know studying at monasteries in\nlike india and south korea and japan and\nall that good stuff mostly india\nand so then i had like my idea of like\nwhat success was right so i'd abandon\nthe idea of being a doctor and then i\nset a target like i'm gonna be like this\nrevolutionary monk who like makes the\nworld a better place and i'm gonna learn\nhow to levitate and do all these cool\nthings because i did encounter\npotentially back then\nand so you know that's sort of what i\ngravitated towards and i did work\ntowards that goal right so i worked\nreally hard and i spent a lot of time i\ni did a lot of very rigorous meditation\npractices and you know spent time in\nlike the indian wilderness like in\nisolation like meditating basically all\nday long and it was kind of actually\nlike grueling and difficult and i was\nlike moving towards my goal and like i\nactually learned a lot of good stuff\nright\nand then sort of what happened is is i\nwas kind of well on my path to becoming\na monk and and i kind of met my wife and\nthen i got kind of confused and like\nhere was this thing that i had built\nlike devoted seven years of my life\ntowards right so like i was on the road\nto becoming a very successful monk\nand so i sort of like walked away from\nit because it just didn't feel right\nlike it just something about becoming a\nmonk didn't like resonate with me i\nstarted to realize you know as i\nactually did real spiritual training\nlike the re my reasons for becoming a\nmonk were actually like very egotistical\nin nature\nand so i had sort of this like ego of\nhaving no ego so you'll see this in\npeople who are you know into\nspirituality but not actually spiritual\nlike they talk the talk but they don't\nwalk the walk and so there are people\nwho will be like oh like i don't want to\nbe materialistic so i'm not going to pay\nmy bills\nand i don't want to be like i don't want\nto\nchase the rat race and capitalism is\nevil and stuff like that so can i borrow\n20 bucks and never pay you back\nso it's like oh you're so attached to\nlike man like you're so full of greed\nand you're so money-minded like i don't\nknow why you're always asking me to pay\nyou back like why don't you just give me\nmore money like i don't understand man\nbe like not materialistic like just let\ngo bro like let go by the way can i\nborrow 20 bucks\nand so like you know so that i realized\nthat i sort of had that kind of false\nspirituality where i used spirituality\nas an excuse\nto get away with all of like my baser\nneeds and instincts it was a way to use\nspirituality to absolve myself of\nresponsibility\nand i realized actually like you know\nthat that was kind of all false but even\nthough i had sort of trained for it\ni kind of left i walked away from it it\njust didn't feel right and then i was\nsort of screwed like if you look at it\nlike objectively like that was a\nterrible idea right so there i am at the\nage of 26 i have no professional\nexperience practically i've been out of\ncollege for like three years i've got a\ncrappy gpa and like i'm deciding not to\nforsake the world and i'm gonna try to\nlike make it in this world like that's\nterrible my resume is crap i haven't had\na job like if i try to get a job like\npeople are gonna ask me like you know\nwhat have you been doing i'm like\nplaying video games maybe studying to\nbecome a monk like i don't know i\nhaven't been doing much so it's a\nterrible idea and meanwhile i like you\nknow i had all these connections in\nindia and had been doing like some stuff\nover there and like you know even doing\nresearch and things like that and i was\nbeing like groomed by a particular you\nknow organization to sort of like be\nyou know kind of like a\num a\nlike a a missionary of sorts right i was\ngonna be another one of these because i\nwas like fluent in english and things\nlike that\nand and so they were like oh like you\nknow you can go and like spread our\nmessage and stuff so that was you know\nit was good in some ways\num but i decided to walk away and then i\nkind of floundered a bit\nfor a while again and i struggled for a\nwhile i like got back into school like\ngot a master's degree like applied to\nmedical school for a few years in a row\ndidn't get in\nfinally got lucky and and got into\nmedical school and then it was like okay\nwell what am i going to move towards how\nam i going to be successful and so then\ni decided i was gonna become like a\nholistic cancer doctor right i was gonna\nlike save lives with like you know i was\ngonna like take these cancer patients\nbecause like cancer is like a real\ndisease right it's like a real problem\nand i'm like save their lives and it's\ngonna be great i'm gonna use like all\nthis eastern wisdom and like it's gonna\nbe like holistic and it's going to be\nholistic and it's going to be holistic\nand it's going to be awesome so i\nposition myself to like move towards\nthat goal right\nand so um you know had thoughts about\nlike you know being the next the buck\nchopra or something like that i don't\nknow if i actually wanted to do that but\nlike just something like that\nso i was going to be this like\nrevolutionary like missionary visionary\nlike call it whatever you want to all of\nthe aries\nand and so i did like you know research\nin a rheumatology lab and like did all\nthis stuff around like meditation and\nlike you know different kinds of\nphysical illnesses did some stuff around\nchronic pain and i was like positioning\nmyself right\nthen i sort of realized like what i\nreally love is like talking to people\nand what i really love is the mind and\nso i really appreciate you know an\neducation and and you know physical\nmedicine but what i really loved was\npsychiatry and that got kind of tricky\nbecause then when i like i remember\ntelling my mom\nmy dad had passed away at that point i\nwas like hey i'm thinking about being a\npsychiatrist and she's like oh that's a\nbad idea and then i talked to my my\ngrandmother and she was like well if you\nbecome a psychiatrist like you're gonna\ngo crazy yourself so i went to my family\nand i was like hey i'm thinking about\nbeing a psychiatrist even went to my\nwife at the time and i was like hey i'm\nthinking about doing psychiatry and\nshe's like\nneurosurgery she was super into grey's\nanatomy at that point\nshe's like\nbecause you've got the hair from\nmcdreamy you know you should become a\nneurosurgeon i was like no i think i\nwant to be a psychiatrist\nand so she was you know not thrilled at\nthe beginning but was actually\nreally supportive and so then i ended up\nyou know going for psychiatry and wound\nup you know doing residency at harvard\nmedical school\nand so\nstarted there\nand so harvard was a fantastic place and\ni think that you know there's a reason\nwhy it has the reputation it has so i\nwent to tufts for medical school i went\nto university of texas for undergrad and\nwinding up you know doing psychiatry\ntraining at harvard like i could tell a\ndifference right so there's like there's\na difference so like the people there\nare super motivated i found amazing\nmentors you know i i had people who kind\nof early on like you know i told them\ni'm like hey my goal is to integrate you\nknow complimentary and alternative\nmedicine um into psychiatry and like how\ndo i do that and i had some awesome\nawesome\nmentors and stuff and like they sort of\ngave me opportunities i started teaching\nmeditation on the inpatient psychiatry\nunit um i started teaching meditation in\naddiction rehabs i started teaching\nmeditation like all over the place i\ntaught it to physicians\ni taught it to emergency room staff i\nstarted working in jail so they were\nlike really awesome they also helped me\nlike sort of connect with research\nopportunities and i started doing\nstudies and then i also was really\ninterested in sort of like making it\nwork financially so i actually opened up\nmy own clinic doing complimentary and\nalternative medicine consultations\nfor patients at massachusetts general\nhospital which like my mentors were\nsuper supportive it was fantastic\nso\nthere i am kind of like you know on\ntrack and then they also like were super\nsupportive in terms of after i graduated\nthey were like hey you know if you want\nto do like\nyou know this kind of work in a rehab or\nif you want to work here you want to\ncontinue doing your consults like we can\nbuild a program and stuff like that they\nwere awesome really fantastic so really\nvisionary very supportive you know\nreally really high quality science\npeople helped me kind of think through\nthings and on the side i've got\nyou know i've got this kind of like\nvoice in the back of my head that's kind\nof like but what about video games like\npeople are playing a bunch of video\ngames like what's up with that so i\nstarted asking people you know like\neveryone knew that i had like this\nresume right and like i was kind of like\ngeared towards that that's what i was\nknown for\nyou know people from the hospital would\nlike email me and be like hey i've got a\npatient who needs\nso like you know who's interested in\nthis like what do you think about that i\nwas like really cool\nand and then like i started asking\npeople like what do you all think about\nvideo game addictions like this kind of\nside thing right like i'm the\ncomplimentary alternative medicine guy\nand there's like they're like what about\nvideo game addiction and i went to one\nof my supervisors who's an awesome\nsupervisor and i kind of asked her she\nwas a psychoanalyst\nand i asked her like you know why do you\nthink people get addicted to video games\nand then so she's like an older person\nright so he's in her 70s at that point\nand she was like classically trained\nlike you know has been practicing\npsychoanalysis for like 40 years\n45 years\nand so she was like you know i think the\nreason people get addicted to video\ngames is for the same reason that they\nget tattoos\nand i was like\nwhat and she's like then she like goes\ninto this like really complicated\nexplanation about like psychodynamic\ntheory and stuff like that\nand and she was like you know like\ntattoos are all about like\nself-expression and we don't when we\nhave like parts of our being that we\ncan't vocalize we can't express\nand then like we find some way to like\nexpress ourselves and like people get\nlost in video games because like it's\nself-expression it's like lady what are\nyou talking about like and so then i\nstarted asking like more and more people\nabout video games and and you know\ni got a mix of responses you know that\nwas probably the most disconnected\nresponse\nand then i as i started like talking to\nall these experts in the field of\npsychiatry like i i realized like what\ni'm talking to is a bunch of people who\nare like older right so like if you\nthink about leaders in the field of\npsychiatry they're like in their 50s in\ntheir 60s\nand\ni mean that's how you like you don't\nbecome chair of psychiatry you know at\nmassachusetts general hospital or\npresident of mclean hospital or like\nchief of psychiatry at you know harvard\nmedical school or like whatever like you\ndon't get to be in that position at the\nage of like 35 like you just don't do\nthat right you spend a whole career\ndoing research establishing yourself\ngoing and presenting at conferences\ngetting grants becoming an expert in\nsomething becoming like an academic\nheavyweight like there's a path to\nsuccess\nat harvard medical school\nand all of the people who are sort of\nleading the charge there you know they\ndon't really understand video games like\nthey haven't really played video games\nand so it started to concern me a little\nbit and and as i and during this time i\nwas like actually working with a lot of\ngamers like on the side i probably\nworked with about 500 gamers over the\ncourse of residency like not as part of\nmy job\ni would just kind of help randos on the\ninternet\nand so what i started to realize is like\nthese people are like suffering really\nreally bad and like this is a real\nproblem there's a generation of people\nwho are like lost and they don't know\nwhat to do and so as i went to my\nmentors and i started to ask these\nreally brilliant psychiatrists really\nbrilliant academics like what do we do\nabout this problem and they were like\nthey were good right so they like\nrecognized they're like recognized by\npassion and you know i i\nhad chosen to respect me despite my\nyouth\nand my inexperience and they were like\nokay here's how you if you want to\nbecome an expert in video game addiction\nlike here's how you do it and they laid\nout for me the path of success you know\nyou apply for grants like you don't\nreally know much about it right it's a\nnew phenomenon so the first thing that\nyou should do is like study for the\nphenomenon so apply for this kind of\ngrant it's a five-year grant it'll give\nyou funding you can ask all these\nquestions you can try to understand\nvideo game addiction and then after you\nget that grant and you sort of produce\nand you publish and stuff like that then\nyou can apply for a bigger grant and\nthen that'll fund you for another 10\nyears and then you start doing studies\nand then you can start doing\ninterventions we can start a clinic here\nand we can kind of do like you know you\ncan see a certain number of patients and\nwe'll kind of do like these kind of\ninterventions and then like 10 or 15 or\n20 years later you'll understand video\ngame addiction and you'll understand how\nto help these people right this is the\nroad\nand and we can help you do it\nand that's when i kind of realized like\nthis doesn't feel right to me right so\nlike what i realized is like there are\npeople struggling in like 20 years from\nnow like this is evolving so quickly\nthat by the time i get my research\nfunding for this grant to study you know\npeople with diablo 3 addiction like\ndiablo 3 is going to be dead like it's\ngoing to be done\nby the time the study ends like the pace\nof video gaming is like so quick that\nyou can try to do a study on any\nparticular video game and like by the\ntime you recruit subject from the study\nno one's going to be playing it like if\ni want to study like people who play\nfortnite like you know\neight months later like they're not\ngoing to be playing fortnite anymore\nright they'll have moved on to apex\nlegends they'll move on to something\nelse there's going to be something else\nso i just realized that like the\ninstitutions that medicine has\nto study and evaluate a problem are like\nno longer working and i think that that\nyou know that's a bold statement to make\nand it's probably unfair and there are\nlots of caveats to it right like so\nobviously there's like a lot of good\nthings that medicine is doing like we\nhave good treatments for psychiatry\nwe've got good treatments for kovid now\nwe've got a vaccine so that's you know i\nkind of retract that statement because\nit's a little bit hyperbolic but what i\nmean is especially when it comes to\ntechnology addiction and mental health\nsomething isn't working here right so\nthat i feel very confident saying that\ndespite advances in medicine despite\ntons of research towards neuroscience\nand psychology and stuff like that\nmental health outcomes are not\nnecessarily improving right like you\nknow mental health got worse during the\npandemic\nsuicide rates continue to be high like\nthey've been kind of relatively high and\nstable in men for decades and arguably\neven getting worse so mental health has\nnow surpassed cancer and cardiovascular\ndisease in the united states is the\nleading cause of morbidity and mortality\nwhich is kind of staggering right so the\nmost\nlaw\nthe biggest impact to our society's\nhealth now comes from mental health\nand it used to be cancer it used to be\ncardiovascular disease and that's\nbecause i think part of the reason that\nthe impact is so great is because mental\nhealth is like affecting young people at\nan alarming rate whereas if you compare\nthings like cancer and cardiovascular\ndisease it doesn't do a whole lot of\ndamage to our 20 year olds our 30 year\nolds our 40 year olds our 10 year olds\nour 15 year olds but when you have\nsomeone who's depressed at the age of 18\nyou know drops out of college due to\ntheir depression and never finishes that\nis a life of like productivity and like\nyou know\ninvolvement in society that kind of gets\ntanked and we see this all over the\nplace right we see this um you know it\nin\nin neets we see this in neenies\nso he's like and and i just got like i i\ngot concerned\nthat the institutions and approaches\nthat we have are not\npaced well enough\nto deal with the challenges that we face\nand so i did something super bizarre\nright so there i was at harvard having a\ncareer and you know i worked there for\nuh you know about a year afterward\nbecause i was still trying to figure out\nhow to do this but\nyou know like like i had this career\npath land planned out it was going to be\nlike super successful\nand i did the most bizarre thing i\nwalked away from it right and and the\nreason that i walked away is because it\nsort of didn't feel right and i know it\nsounds kind of weird but what i realized\nis like\nyou know there's a path to success and\nsomeone has laid it out to me like\nthey've you know they've given me\nthey've laid out the red carpet and\nthey've said all all you have to do is\nwalk down it and like this is how you do\nit we will help you\nand it just didn't feel right and so i\nthink it's super bizarre but i think\nthat most of my success has come from\nwalking away\nfrom things that are objectively\nsuccessful\nand moving towards things that feel\nsubjectively right\nand i think that our society is like\nreally strange but i think it's like\ncool now\nthat we live in a world where if you\nhave a particular niche if you have\nsomething that you care about if you\nwant to do things a different way\nthat society is well positioned to\nactually support you now more than ever\nand i think about some of these indie\ngames is like a great example of this\nlike undertale for example i think was\nmade by one person right axiom verge was\nmade by one person and some of y'all may\nhave never heard of these games but i\nthink it's a good example of like\nyou know there's there's a very clear\nniche and like you don't have to follow\nthe traditional path of success now more\nthan ever right if you want to write a\nbook like now with the explosion of\nthings like e-books and e-publishing i'm\nnot saying that it's like an easy route\nbut like you can write more niche books\nwe're seeing a true revival of the\nfantasy genre because like so many\npeople are like reading and so you can\nwrite a you know a book that you really\nlike and that you're super passionate\nabout and there's a good chance that\nthat book will be more successful than\nit would have been 30 years ago when\neverything was about mass market and so\ni know it sounds kind of weird but\nsometimes in life and especially if you\nall are trying to think about you know\nwhat to do\nyou may sort of have this objective idea\nof what it means to be successful and\nlike what what an objective idea of what\nit means to be successful is sort of\nlike what everyone can kind of agree on\nand we set our targets based on those\nkinds of ideas instead of actually\ntapping into and taking advantage of the\nthings that make us unique\nand so if you're really thinking about\nhow to be successful i know it sounds\nkind of weird but like i would encourage\nyou to follow your instinct and move in\nthe direction that feels right to you\ni'm not saying just follow your heart in\nsort of like you know in an excuse kind\nof way to shirk your responsibilities at\neach step of the way you know i walked\naway from becoming a monk i walked away\nfrom becoming an oncologist i walked\naway from you know being faculty i mean\ni'm still technically faculty at harvard\nmedical school but you know i walked\naway from a job there\nand working there and following their\npath because it just didn't feel right\nlike that system of of you know\naddressing the world's mental health\nproblems didn't resonate with like my\npersonal goals\nand so i walked away and so sometimes i\nthink being the most successful in life\nactually comes from ironically walking\naway from like excellent opportunities i\nthink the best decisions that i ever\nmade were the ones where i walked away\nfrom a great opportunity\nand so i would encourage all of you all\nto think long and hard about what is it\nthat you want what is that what is it\nthat you care about what is it that like\nthat you can do for the world and you\nmay think to yourself oh i can't do\nanything like i don't have any skills\nthat are you know\nworthwhile\nand and this is where you know i'm going\nto use the example of professional dms\nlike you know there's a crowd of people\nwho are like i'm a good dungeon master\nbut like there's no\nthat's not a job but it is right so\nbecause like there's a change there's a\ntrend in our society where people are\nstarting to institute more work-life\nbalance they're willing to you know not\neveryone needs to drive you know a\nhundred thousand dollar car\npeople some people just want to play d d\nlike i i have a t-shirt you know this is\nwhat i wear basically every day i have\njeans that are eight years old this\nfleece is like good god this fleece is\nnow seven years old and i wear the same\ncrap every day what do i care about i\nwant to spend money on the things that i\nenjoy and for a lot of people those are\nthings like video games and playing\ndungeons and dragons\nand so are a lot of things that you may\ncare about and i encourage you to like\nreally think about okay how do i make\nthis work\nright forget about what society tells\nyou is the road to success\nand take a look at our current situation\nand try to take a look at like okay what\ncan i do differently because a\nsuccessful psychiatrist is someone who\nhas you know a really nice private\npractice in a very fancy office and\ncharges six hundred dollars an hour and\nall that kind of stuff and like that's\nwhat i was doing right so i had these\nlike people like these you know\ntech startup ceos and all these kind of\npeople come into my office to learn\nabout you know meditation and work-life\nbalance and the meaning of life and like\ndealing with their anxiety and dealing\nwith their stress and i'd put them on an\nayurvedic diet and give them these kinds\nof supplements and like teach them\nmeditation it's all evidence-based\nscientific stuff and they'd get better\nright it was fantastic\nthat's what successful psychiatrists do\nthey don't stream on twitch and talk to\na group of people who are all centrally\nyou know well we all aren't broke that's\nnot fair i think i sometimes unfairly\ncharacterize twitch but you know it's\nit's like you know trying to like\ntalk to gamers on twitch like what how\nam i going to make money here like\nwhy don't i charge 600 bucks an hour\nlike i'm gonna help rando's on the\ninternet for two hours and do what\nyou know and so then it becomes an issue\nof like trying to make it work right so\nthen you have to be like a little bit\ncalculating you have to think about it\nokay how am i going to make this work\nhow many hours there's a reason why i\nonly stream six hours a week i literally\ncannot afford to stream like eight hours\na day like a lot of streamers do right i\ncannot afford it and so i have other\navenues of income and things like that\nyou find some way to make it work\nand so i encourage all of you all to\nthink\nabout you know what is it that you can\noffer what is it that you care about\nbecause i think what we find is what we\nsee time and time again is that like a\nlot of the most successful stories that\nwe see are from people actually\nfollowing their passion but in like a\ncalculated and careful way right it's\nnot like follow your passion like sort\nof like the use it use that as an excuse\nto shirk your responsibilities i have\ntwo kids i can't just follow my passion\ni have to figure out some way to like\nyou know buy them clothing and buy them\nfood and stuff like that you can't just\nfollow your passion but i would\nencourage you to think long and hard\nabout what is your approach to success\nand what do you think of as success and\ntake a step back from that and really\nlisten to like your inner self because\nthe the big thing that i found is that\nyou know i showed up on twitch and i\noffered you guys what i have to offer\nyou\nand it worked out really well because\nit's something that i care about it\nbrings out the best in me right because\ny'all are the people that i care about\nthis is a place that i love and this is\nthese are people that i care about and\nso i'm gonna it's gonna bring out my\nbest performance\nso trust yourselves listen to yourselves\nand don't follow the traditional paths\nof success without thought be thoughtful\nabout it and what you may find somewhere\nalong the way is that like you have to\ndo that for a little while right even if\ni had set out to do this work i still\nthink i would have said okay i need to\nget some kind of formal training as like\na medical professional because like\nthat's how i need to understand gamers i\nneed to understand neuroscience i need\nto understand spirituality like\nyou know this is how i would still do it\nyou still have to do things that you\ndon't like but once you're doing those\nthings in service to your own goals\ninstead of like you know the grind at\nyour job so that you can get promoted\nyour experience of life your enjoyment\nof life and your performance will will\nbe so much higher\nwhen the work that you do is aligned\nwith your goals and things that you care\nabout even if you hate doing that\nparticular work it becomes so much\neasier\nquestions\nso one person's asking do you need to\nlive a do you need to succeed how about\njust living a satisfying life\nso it's a good question right so some\npeople may say like okay like life is\nabout satisfaction i know it sounds kind\nof weird but i'm gonna say you need to\nsucceed\nand what i mean by that is like you\nshould have something in your life that\nyou can be proud of\ni don't think it's just and maybe that's\nwhat satisfaction is like maybe you\ncould define satisfaction as having a\ncomponent of that but i do think that\nlike just from like a worth standpoint\nright like i want you all to live a\nbuild a life for yourself where you can\nwake up and even if you don't enjoy your\nwork you can at least be proud of it\nright you can hold your head up high you\ndon't have to be embarrassed when people\nlike ask you what you do or how you\nspend your time or whatever it doesn't\nhave to be like their barometer of\nsuccess like you don't have to use their\nmeasurement of success but i think in\nterms of yourself if you have goals you\nshould strive to be successful\nabsolutely and you should sacrifice to\nachieve those goals like absolutely\nthat's what i think ultimately leads to\nsatisfaction\nis you know setting a target for\nyourself that's aligned with the person\nthat you are and like strive for success\ndon't just cha i mean if if you're\ncalling success a part of satisfaction\nthat's fine but the concern that i get\nis some people will say i want to live a\nsatisfying life or an enjoyable life\nand that may not be the same thing as\nwell but like there are some people who\nwill sort of have more like i'm gonna\nlive in the present and essentially live\nlike a life of hedonism of pleasure\nright and like maybe that means like\neating tasty burgers all the time and\nlike eating good food and stuff like\nthat\nbut there's good evidence there's a\nreally fascinating study that um\nessentially demonstrated that like\nsuffering actually like you know\ncorrelates with like how can i say this\nthat going through something bad makes\nthings more pleasant\nso this is a really interesting it's\nit's somewhat of a stretch of an\ninterpretation i don't have the\nreference right at the top of my head\nbut they did a really interesting\nexperiment where they put they had\npeople put their hands\nin like uncomfortably and painfully cold\nwater so they sort of like set it to\nlike maybe negative 10 degrees or\nsomething like that and they had someone\nstick their hand in it okay and so like\nthat water is objectively worse\nlike it's bad it's objectively painful\nand then what they did is they they took\na second group of people and then they\nhad them put their hands in like\nnegative 15 degree water which is\nobjectively worse than the negative 10\ndegree water so they gave people a\nstimulus that is objectively worse\nthan the prior stimulus\ntowards the end what they did is warm up\nthe water from negative 15 to negative\n10. so group number one had negative 10\nall along group number two had negative\n15\nand then up to negative 10. so they were\nobjectively started worse and ended up\njust as bad as group number one\nand people's experience of those two\nevents people in the second group\ncomplained less\nthey felt like it was a more pleasant\noverall experience and less painful\noverall experience even though\nobjectively their experience was worse\nso as human beings there's something and\nand you know i can sort of share this\npersonally where like when you stay up\nwith your kid like the first night that\none of my kids had coveted i had coveted\ntwo but i woke up every two hours and\nand checked her oxygen level because\nthat's the scary thing right so it was\nlike an exhausting night but like it\nfeels worth it right like you wake up\nthe next day and you feel like crap and\nyou're exhausted\nbut\nyou can take pride in it right like i\ncan be like even though i feel like crap\ni can i'm glad i did it and i'm like\nhappy with the person that i am today\nand a big problem that i see in people\nnowadays is that like\nyou know\nwe're exposed to so much suffering\nwithout purpose\nso if you look at like people who are\nlike working in the grind right like you\ncan think about someone like an amazon\nwarehouse worker or like a ups delivery\nperson and they can get compensated well\nbut like they're working really hard but\nit's not for a purpose and so i think a\nbig part of satisfaction with life a big\npart of like feeling successful and\nbeing proud of yourself is not the\navoidance of pain you don't need to\navoid pain and gravitate towards\npleasure all you need to do is have pain\nfor a damn good reason\nand if you think about like i'm just\ngonna think about a gaming analogy for a\nsecond okay so if i think about the\ngames that i enjoy playing the most the\nmultiplayer games like the best and most\nepic moments\nthe most epic moment in a video game is\nnot when you stomp objectively from\nminute 1 to minute 30 and just destroy\nthem the most epic moments are the ones\nwhere you are behind and you make a\ncomeback\nright so it's that exactly that water\nthat water experiment\nis if you think about what makes the\nsweetest part of life it's actually the\nbitterness that comes ahead of time\nand there's this is also found in\nayurvedic medicine where there's a\nparticular herb called um\nwhat's it called uh it's neem it may\nhave a different carlo limburo is like\nsort of\nthe you know the ethnic term but neem\nleave so these are very very bitter\nleaves and if you guys can get these\nleaves i encourage you to try them it's\na great meditation practice so you eat\none of these leaves and it's like so\ndamn bitter and then you drink water\nafterward and it tastes so sweet\nand so it's so interesting but i think\nwhen people are sort of asking okay like\ndo you need to be successful like is it\nokay to live a satisfying life and what\ni'd say is that like don't avoid pain\nand don't avoid suffering\nbuild a life for yourself where you can\nsucceed through pain and suffering and\nthen you'll have a life that's truly\nsatisfying\nyou"
