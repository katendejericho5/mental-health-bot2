    "transcript": "and so for each and every one of you if\nyou all are stuck\nstart by planting the smallest positive\nkarmic seed you can\ntake whatever tiny action you can to set\nyourself up for a better tomorrow it may\nit may bear fruit it may not\nbut you are still going to act\nall right today my dad told me i'm not\nhis son anymore i don't know if i can\nupload this does that mean okay well\ni'll vote\nwhen i was 11 my family went through a\nrough divorce a rough and long divorce\nmy father\nhas become abusive and heavily drug\ndependent for a few years\ni'm 19 now wow dude that sucks and the\nlast time i spoke to him was when i was\n15. he's a top tier scientist and this\nyear after a lifelong passion\nfor all kinds of science i chose the\nsame career path as him\nnot because of him but because i my own\nlove for the thing\nevery three months i've\ni have to send him an email and briefly\ntell him if something is important like\nmy address\nphone number changed\nso i did that yesterday telling him that\ni got accepted to the best university in\nmy country into a biochemistry course\nthe same course in school that he\nattended and to be honest i i hoped a\nlittle bit that he would reply and at\nleast say something slightly nice\nhe replied by calling me a mister\ninstead of my name told me that i am not\nhis son anymore and basically blamed the\nwhole divorce on me in a long and\nhateful paragraph\ni called my mom ouch dude shared the\nmail with my girlfriend had it on the\nback of my mind the whole damn day to be\nhonest even after being physically and\nmentally abused for six years\nstraight getting sued by him multiple\ntimes\nliterally watching trying to kidnap my\nfour-year-old sister this really hurts\nand i don't even know why i care so much\nthe only thing i can do now is to cope\nin a healthy way and this is what this\npost is about i've decided to cope in a\nhealthy and mature way this time even\nand even though my entire being\nliterally just wants to get drunk and\nself-harm i'm not going gonna do it good\nfor you man or woman\ni will visit my family instead spend\nsome time some extra time with my\ngirlfriend and cat and get some quality\nalone time whatever just to relax and\nclear my head so [ __ ] you dad and you\nwon't get the best of me this time\ngood for you being human sucks ass yeah\nso this is this is also like a fantastic\npost so like we're just going to talk\nfor a second i think it's a great final\npost\nso first thing is that like\nyeah being human sometimes sucks us\nand i think that this post is i don't\nknow if it's just because i've been\ntalking about spirituality but\ni feel like talking about karma for a\nsecond i think this post be beautifully\nillustrates karma\nso sometimes it's not your choice what\nhand you're dealt right so this person\nwas born\nto someone who sounds like they have a\nsubstance use problem and are highly\nnarcissistic and uncaring and that sucks\nand it hurts and it damages you like\nthat's just the truth of it right like\nit's the truth if you have a parent who\nblames you for their divorce who's\nincredibly toxic who despite you know\nall of that toxicity you try to do the\nright thing you try to do your dharma\nyou try to be a good child and like\nevery three months at least give them an\nupdate and try to maintain some kind of\nconnection with them first of all you're\nnot stupid for doing that you're not\nweak for doing that i think it's doing\nyour dharma as you're as as a as a child\nto a parent right it's important to try\nto forgive and maintain\nrelationships at the same time i think\nyou've done your dharma right so your\ndharma means making a solid effort\nit doesn't mean making an effort until\nthe end of time\nit means giving it your best shot and\nrecognizing that relationships are\ntwo-way and enough is enough\nit doesn't mean that you always have to\nlook for their approval and that if your\nrelationship sucks it means it's\ncontinuously your fault and that you\nneed to continue trying\nin my mind you've done a fantastic job\nof trying to keep them in your life and\ngive them every chance to re-engage with\nyou and if they choose not to that is\nthe extent of your dharma you don't need\nto ever send them an email again if they\never reach out to you and they want to\nexpress remorse you don't have to give\nthem an opportunity to apologize you\ndon't have to let them back into your\nlife you've given them a chance and they\nchose to pass\nthey may try to make you feel guilty and\nsay like oh i deserve a chance and\nyou're they're right they do deserve a\nchance and they had it they had several\nchances\nthey had a year of chances and that boat\nhas sailed\nyou don't have to bring the boat back to\nshore just because they're a few years\nlate\nright that is dharma it is doing your\nduty and also recognizing that your duty\nis not bending over backwards\nthe second thing is this is a beautiful\nexample of karma\nso it's not your choice who your dad was\nand yet\nyou can take steps to\ndetermine your future by the karma of\nyour present actions\nright like in this person is doing a\nbeautiful job so in this moment\nit's not their choice that their dad was\nan abusive [ __ ] that's not something\nso they get they get damaged by that\nthey get the abuse and they have to deal\nwith that [ __ ] it's unfortunate but it's\ntrue\nand then we all have choices right so\nthey have a choice right now that they\ncan self-harm or drink but instead\nthey're gonna spend time alone with\ntheir girlfriend they're going to hurt\nthey're going to post on writing they're\ngoing to spend time with their cat that\nis a karmic choice which will then lead\nto a karmic fruit\nso i really love this post because i\nthink it exemplifies like these two\nprinciples right these are just\nframeworks for looking at this thing\nthe first is that you should do your\nduty\nand\nalso you should not do any more than\nyour duty\nso one of my my most brilliant mentors\nwho i quote the most once told me that\nthe doctor who goes the extra mile for a\npatient goes a mile too far\nand you actually shouldn't go the extra\nmile for a patient\nyou should go the mile that you're\nsupposed to go\nright you should do your duty\nand you shouldn't go an extra mile\nbecause then you've got a mile too far\nthat the patient actually has\nresponsibility as well\nright so like if your patient doesn't\nshow up on time should you give them\nextra time maybe maybe not\nif they show up late chronically should\nyou make adjustments maybe maybe not you\nshould do your duty and you should let\neveryone else do theirs\nthe second principle here is karma which\nis that you can't control\nwhat happens to you what you can control\nis what you do about it\nyou can't control for the pain like\nthat's gonna hurt right like and you\nstill want your your dad's approval\nabsolutely makes sense we all want our\ndad's approval right like that's what we\nwant it's fantastic my dad passed away a\nfew months after i got into medical\nschool passed away one month before i\ngot married\nand it was really great because like the\nday that i got into medical school\nhe cried in a way that i had never seen\nhim cry before and it was like so like\nwonderful because i knew he was proud of\nme and then he passed away and he never\nsaw me get into harvard never saw me\nbecome faculty never saw me become a\nsuccessful twitch streamer never saw any\nof those things and i don't need him to\nsee because i got that one dose of like\nsolid approval that has stuck with me\nright\nand so to not get that absolutely sucks\nbut what we do with our negative karma\nor our positive karma\nhas to do like that's our that's\nthat's our choice right as as a human\nbeing you're entitled to your actions\nyou're not entitled to the outcomes of\nyour actions so i applaud this person a\nhundred percent for venting some of\nthose feelings for processing a little\nbit through writing that post for\nrecognizing notice what they're doing in\ntheir mind they have a their thought\npops up there's a cultivation that's\nvery important here their mind says oh\nlet's go get drunk and self-harm because\ni'm hurting and there's another part of\nour our mind that says actually we're\nnot going to do that\nwe're going to spend time with our cat\nwe're going to spend time with our\ngirlfriend we're going to post on the\ninternet\nwe're going to process these emotions\nwe're going to build something out of\nour life\nit doesn't take the pain away\nbut it does sow seeds for the future\nso for all of you who are in these kinds\nof situations i don't blame you for\nstupidly wanting the approval of your\nparents\nit's biologically built in it's\nculturally built in you make think that\nyou're dumb but you're not dumb at all\nit's very normal and natural to want the\napproval of people who are abusive to\nyou it's why people stay in abusive\nrelationships it's how we're wired we as\nhuman beings adore and need to be\nappreciated and respected by people\nespecially the people that are like our\nparents and that are close to us right\nwe can spend our whole lives very\nunderstandably\nchasing after the approval of our\nparents\nand so i do i think you should cut them\noff with all ties and call them an\n[ __ ] no i think you should actually\ndo your duty you should make an effort a\nsolid effort to forgive them and give\nthem another chance\nand\nthat effort should be limited\nright you should do your duty and\nnothing more\nand once that duty is passed\nbe able to sleep at night give yourself\na pat on the bat because you gave it a\nshot right you extended your hand you\ntried to repair the relationship and\nthey chose not to meet you there and so\nthen you don't have to do anything with\nthem anymore they're done\nright they say they're dead to you\ni think\nthey actually just knock themselves out\nof your life\nand so be it like you don't need to be\nalive to them right your dad can\nwallow in his drinking and his\nhurt and his resentment he can hold on\nto the past and blame a 10 year old for\na divorce like how stupid can you be\nyour dad gets to do all those things and\nthen you're gonna build the life that\nyou want to build and i commend you a\nhundred percent for doing that\nand so think a little bit about the\nkarma you can't control what happened to\nyou can't control the pain that life\nthrows your way\nwhat you can control to some degree is\nwhat you do about it and there are days\nwhere the depression gets too bad and\nthere are days where you don't have the\nwillpower and you give in to the alcohol\nthere are days where you lose that fight\nand that's okay right so like be\nforgiving towards yourself have some\ncompassion and just because you've lost\nthat fight quite a few times doesn't\nmean you have to lose that fight\ntomorrow or today\nand so as you start to cultivate this\nthe tiniest little victories they will\nbegin to support you i have no doubt\nthat this 19 year old person who has a\ngirlfriend and a cat\nand maintains a relationship with their\nmom\nhad many opportunities to not have that\ngirlfriend not get a cat right they\ncould have chosen not to do any of those\nthings\nbut since they made what i'm sure is\ndifficult choices because if you have\nabusive parents it's like hard to\nfind a girlfriend and like engage in\nrelationships and you can deal with a\nlot of terror and fear but as they start\nto deal with those things they start to\naccumulate positive karma around them\nand then you deal with a problem like\nthis and they have support structures in\nplace\nand so for each and every one of you if\nyou all are stuck\nstart by planting the smallest positive\nkarmic seed you can\ntake whatever tiny action you can to set\nyourself up for a better tomorrow it may\nit may bear fruit it may not\nbut you are still going to act\nright it doesn't matter how many\nmistakes you made it doesn't matter how\nmany f's you have on your transcript\nthe question is what are you gonna do\ntoday\nand as you take each of those steps\nforward it doesn't matter that you've\nchanged your major eight times and you\nhaven't been able to find a career so\nfar the question is what are you gonna\ndo today it doesn't matter that you're\n21 and you've never had sex and you\ndon't have a girlfriend or whatever the\nquestion is what are you going to do\ntoday and in the tiniest way so a\npositive karma for yourself\ndo five push-ups\ncook yourself some dinner eat a piece of\nfruit\nyou know journal a little bit go for a\nwalk\nthere is evidence that vitamin d\noverwhelming evidence that vitamin d\nactually helps your mood\nthere's less good evidence that plant\naerosols\nhave anti-anxiety benefits\nso if you're struggling with depression\nand anxiety and you literally go for a\nwalk there is scientific\ndata that suggests that you have\nimproved your depression and anxiety for\ntomorrow\nright so each tiny thing that you do you\ndon't realize what you're doing you\ndon't see the effect right away which is\nwhy it's great that we have that that\nmean post right\nyou can't let your actions\nbe dictated\nby the progress that you see\nyou cannot let your actions be dictated\nby the outcome\nyou have to let your actions be dictated\nby what you like what direction you want\nto go\nand the more that you focus on that and\nthe less that you let go of outcomes the\nmore you will build like a positive\nkarmic life which will then support you\nand then you'll be amazed at what you\ncan accomplish"
