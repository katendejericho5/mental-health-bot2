    "transcript": "so i really liked today's interview\nbecause like so tyler's fantastic um i\nthink he did a really good job of like\nsetting some really like healthy\nboundaries\nand you know not everyone is ready for\nemotions right at the beginning\nand the second thing to remember is that\nif you're struggling to do something\nremember that like emotions are just one\npart of it so like why do we try to\nteach people about emotions and explore\nemotions it's because of the way that\nemotions interact our like thought\nprocess our motivation our ability to do\nthings so like digging into emotions for\nentertainment value or\nself-understanding or like things like\nthat like all that stuff is like fine\nand all but what i've really found is\nthat emotions are just one part of us\nright and as we begin to understand like\nif i want to do a particular task and i\nset out to do that task and i judge\nmyself if i feel incompetent if i'm\nperfectionistic if i'm avoiding\nparticular things related to that task\nthat's why you need to understand\nemotions because as you understand those\nkinds of things it actually helps you do\nthe things that you want to do\nhey man\nhello\ncan you hear me okay\nuh i can hear you just fine awesome man\ni can hear you just fine too thank you\nso much for coming on today hey thanks\nfor having me yeah um so can you uh what\ndo you go by how would you like\ntyler or wildcat tyler's mine okay\num\nso thank you very much for coming on\ntoday tyler uh you know any anything in\nparticular that you wanted to kind of\ntalk about today or\num um anything you've got questions\nabout anything you want to share\ni mean nothing real specific i guess but\num you know i\nstruggled a little bit with like anxiety\nuh and i i had tweeted out that like one\nof my biggest weaknesses is like how i\nhandle stress and like being overwhelmed\nand that's when uh you guys reached out\nand was like hey would you be interested\nin talking and you actually reached out\nlike a year ago\nand at the time i was like nah i just\ndidn't feel like i was\ni don't know ready to do that i guess\nlike sure on on on stream and everything\num but now i'm a little i'm more open to\nit\nokay sure um\nyeah so you know a couple of just ground\nrules since it seems like in the past\nmaybe you were a little bit reluctant um\nyou know you don't have to talk about\nanything that you don't feel comfortable\ntalking about\num you know if i sense that we're going\ninto territory that may feel\na little bit hesitant i may actually\npoint that out to you like hey i'm\nnoticing that maybe this is making you\nfeel uncomfortable\nand you're welcome to just kind of step\naway from those topics\nuh so we'll try to keep things kind of\nsafe and and you know in territories\nthat\num\nyou know you're comfortable talking\nabout\nand the last thing that i want to say is\ni really appreciate you coming on\nbecause i think how to handle stress is\nsomething that a lot of people really\nstruggle with\ni think it's like\num you know we use the word stress like\na catch-all but like what does that mean\nand as we get into the different\ncomponents of stress we can start to\nfigure out almost like targeted ways to\nthink about our stress level and like\npotentially like\nmechanisms that we can use to sort of\nmanage it um so i think it's a really\nimportant topic\nand if you're willing to you know talk\nabout that today i think a lot of people\ncould benefit from it\nyeah\nhopefully okay\nokay so so when you say you have trouble\nhandling stress help me understand what\nthat means\nuh yeah i not necessarily that i have\nlike trouble handling i just think i\nhandle it poorly in terms of like\ni don't\ni feel like when i feel overwhelmed what\ni should be doing is you know getting\nmotivated to take things out one by one\nand just getting getting everything done\nbut instead what i do is i generally\njust block out the things that are\neither least interesting\nor not as important or whatever and i\nand i i put my focus on other things uh\nespecially when it comes to like doing\nyoutube\nlike i feel like i make an excuse for\nmyself where\nyou know whatever it may be like i\nrecently moved and so like moving was\nlike a big ordeal i was like oh it's so\noverwhelming there's all these things i\nhave to do and i was like i'll just\nfocus on my youtube channel just make\nsome videos or whatever because i have\nto do that anyway you know like i would\njust kind of make that excuse for myself\nyeah um\nyeah\nso i'm noticing that your mind sort of\nretreats from things that feel important\nto you\nyeah\nyeah in a way yeah and it sort of picks\nother important things to focus on yeah\ni guess i kind of like i set like a\npriority list in my own head and like\ninstead of taking things out one by one\ni just focus on like the top two or\nwhatever like the most you know a couple\nimportant things that are\nyou know both important but also like\neasier you know\nokay\nso it looks like sometimes your mind\nchooses to tackle chooses to tackle\neasier problems rather than hard ones\nyeah just the things that come natural\nto me um\nsure\nso tyler i'm gonna ask you kind of weird\nquestion\nwhat's wrong with that\num\ni just think it's like a little lazy and\na little like unproductive\num\nyou know i feel like everybody has\nthings that they don't want to do that\nthey need to do and it's just it's\neasier to just do them but for whatever\nreason sometimes i just can't especially\nwhen it's like a lot of stuff and i feel\noverwhelmed and i i don't know how to\nlike\neven break it down of like a list of\nthings to do and where to start\ni guess that's really where it is when\ni'm so overwhelmed i don't even know\nwhere to start that's when it's really\nhard\nokay\nwhat's lazy or unproductive about that\nuh i'm just putting things off i don't\nknow just not getting not getting things\ndone i guess\nwell so i'm gonna play devil's advocate\nby the way your camera seems to be like\nzooming in or out i'm not sure if that's\nlag on my end or it just blurs and then\nrefocuses yeah i think it's trying to\nauto focus i could change it over to\nmanual but\num\nso i'm gonna just play devil's advocate\nand push back for a second okay which is\nokay you know totally fine because i\nthink it'll we'll learn as as we kind of\nso here you you make a priority list and\nyou say okay there's there are 10 things\nto do\nand you kind of rank them in terms of\npriority and what i'm hearing you say is\nthat like you pick number one and number\ntwo on the list and you just focus on\nthose and kind of forget about\neverything else that seems to be like a\npretty good\nyou know strategy right like if you've\ngot a ton of stuff to do and you can't\ndo it all\nyou know making a priority list and then\nfocusing on the most important seems\nlike actually kind of a winning strategy\nuh\nkind of\nexcept when one and two are like things\ni can do infinitely you know when it\ncomes to like making videos or content\nlike i can i can literally do it all day\nand call myself being productive but at\nthe end of the day i'm still putting off\nother things i need to do\nand the more i put off those little\nthings you know every day another little\nthing gets added and it just adds up and\npiles up then it gets overwhelming\nyeah\nso that's kind of interesting so what\ni'm using or what i'm hearing this is\ngoing to sound kind of weird\nis that you use being productive as an\navoidance strategy\nyeah\nyeah\nbut it's like almost overproductive it's\nlike being productive in something that\ni don't need to be productive in anymore\nbecause there's other things i should do\nbut oh absolutely right so when we think\nabout avoidance strategies\nthe purpose of being productive is to\navoid doing this other stuff so you will\nbe\nlike productive until the end of time i\nthink you brought up a really good point\nthat the things at number one and number\ntwo you never check like you never check\nthe box you're complete you're now time\nto move on to number three\nso it's really interesting that like\ni've you know i i've actually heard this\nevery now and then that some people will\nuse productivity as a method of\navoidance\nyeah\num and so let's try to understand what\ndo you think it is that you're avoiding\nby\nyou know focusing on youtube\num\ni don't i don't know if it's necessarily\ni'm i guess it's just like it's just\nmundane boring stuff i guess you know\njust because youtube has always like\nbeen so compelling and interesting and\nit's always exciting and fun\num i also value like maintaining\nrelationships and so that's like another\nthing that i think is high on the\npriority list where it's like not\nnecessarily being productive you know\nmaybe it's like going out to eat with\nfriends or something but it's\nmaintaining relationships that i do feel\nis important whether it's just\nfriendship family or you know business\nwhatever\num\nlike that's another thing where it's not\nreally being productive but it is\nimportant\nsure\nso i'm hearing that relationships is\nimportant like youtube is important\num\nand so what kind of stuff do you tend to\navoid you mentioned like mundane like\nwhat what's something that you wish you\ncould do more easily\num\ni don't know i guess one example was\njust like i moved recently and it was\nlike that was just such an overwhelming\nlike\ntask to me it was like to move\neverything out of one house into a new\nhouse and i still am not fully done like\nall my boxes are in this new house but i\nhaven't gone through all my boxes and\norganized everything and done all that\nand it's like ah they're fine\nsitting in the box in my garage or\nwhatever like technically this stuff is\nhere it's fine but it's like something i\nneed to do but it's something i can\neasily excuse and be like i'll just go\nlike stream or make a video or something\nor do something like that instead\num i guess that would be an example\nand what do you so\nyou mentioned earlier that like you\ndon't handle stress well is there\nsomething stressful about this\nsituation that we're describing\nuh yeah it just gives me like a lot of\nanxiety i guess to like\nthink about\ntrying to do it i guess\nso when it comes like the moving it's\njust like it's so overwhelming there's\nso much stuff to go through and organize\nit's gonna take so much time\nand at the end of the day it's like it's\njust fine sitting there in the box or\nwhatever you know like that's how my\nhead works\nokay\nso can you help me understand what you\nmean by anxiety\num\ni don't know i i mean just like an\nanxious feeling just you know my heart\ngets racing or whatever and my brain\njust like tries to figure out and just\ncan't and she's like it's just so much\neasier to just go focus on something\nelse you know\nwhat what is it that your brain can't do\num\nbreak down like\nwhere to start doing something like that\nokay um\nyou know it's like like i get it yeah\nsure just go open the first box and like\nsee what's in it and start organizing it\nbut like that sounds easy but to me for\nwhatever reason my brain is just like oh\nthat's\nthat's not the best way to do it you\nshould do it this way or like you know i\ndon't know\nokay\nhow are you feeling right now tyler\ntalking about this\nuh i feel fine i just want to make sure\ni convey\nhow i feel appropriately you know\ndo you feel like you're doing a good job\nof conveying how you feel or you think\nwe're like missing pieces of it\nno\nno i think i just is i don't know i\nthink i'm doing okay okay\num i think you're doing great man\ncan i think for a second and just try to\nput some stuff together\nyeah um\noh we may go into teaching mode today\nare you hoping to like have some kind of\nemotional catharsis on stream today and\ncry and\nlearn something no\nno but i mean we can't i don't\nif there's positive to come out the\nother end yeah so i mean sometimes\npeople are sort of like\nyeah i guess the only reason i'm anxious\nabout that is just because like\nlike we're on twitch right and twitch is\na bit of a bubble in terms of like\nuh you know like a lot of people on\ntwitch probably haven't heard of me\nbecause i don't really stream on twitch\num so it's like i don't know i feel like\ni'm opening up to like a lot of\nstrangers right now you know\nyeah so i\nyou know what we try to do tyler so look\nlet me just kind of take a step back and\nexplain so i you know i have a lot of\ndifferent experience so i studied for\nabout seven years to become a monk and\nthen i did neuroscience research and\nwent to medical school and became a\npsychiatrist so through all of that you\nknow i've gained a lot of interesting\nperspectives\nand sometimes um when we try to like\nteach people about themselves it\ninvolves like digging into their\nemotions and stuff we'll get there i\nthink there's a piece of that here\nbut basically what i\nyou know what we can try to do is try to\nlike help you understand like the\nmechanism of your mind like what are the\nrules because there's definitely like\nall kinds of consistent programming in\nyour mind that something feels\noverwhelming you don't know how to\nstart it's not the best way to do it\nlike all of those thoughts\ni think are really important because i\nthink they make it hard for you to\nactually engage in the action\nand then what happens is you've got\nsomething that your mind can justify\nas a good use of your time and so here\nyou you've got thing number one that\nlike you kind of don't want to do you\ndon't really know how to do and even if\nyou just open the first box you would\nsort of be doing it inefficiently like\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nand then on the other side you've got\nthings that are like clearly important\nlike how can you argue against like hey\nmy you know i'm like i'm a youtuber so\nmaking like youtube content is like part\nof my job like relationships are\nimportant to me as a human being and so\nanytime there's that conflict in your\nmind like youtube and relationships like\nalways win out because it's like you\nknow compared to doing a crappy job of\nopening boxes like come on man like\nyeah why you know so i i think that that\nwhat we can try to do is sort of\nunderstand a little bit about how your\nmind like looks at those problems and\nhopefully help you\nmake it easier for you to sort of\nopen up boxes\nby helping you understand like what the\nresistance in your mind is\ndo you think that's a good use of our\ntime today\nyeah okay yeah\num so\ncan i just ask you a couple of like uh\nyou know background questions a little\nbit about how you got to where you are\nand yeah so can you tell me a little bit\nabout where you grew up and and how you\nwhat growing up was like for you\nuh yeah i guess first of all i'll just\nfully introduce myself my name is tyler\na wildcat um i have a youtube channel uh\ni have almost 8 million subscribers i've\nbeen doing it for damn son almost a\ndecade\nuh my channel will turn 10 years old in\na month\num i'm 28 years old i've already said\nthat uh but i grew up in northeast\nindiana pretty much the middle of\nnowhere small town\num\nand recently moved six years ago to\nnashville tennessee area\ni've been living here since\nand yeah so yeah i started my channel\nlike 10 years ago and i've been doing it\nfull-time for like seven almost\num and doing it as a job for like eight\nokay um yeah\ncan you tell me what growing up in\nindiana was like\num\nit was interesting i guess uh when i was\nfirst growing up like up until i was\nlike eight or ten somewhere in there i\ndon't remember like third grade or\nfourth grade uh my family lived in like\na little subdivision there was a bunch\nof other kids i was playing with kids\nall the time\num\nyou know going to elementary school and\nthen my parents moved out to like the\ncountry and that was like a little\nisolating because at the time i was an\nonly child used to just be able to walk\noutside and go play with a bunch of\nfriends do whatever\nnow you know it was like\nthere was one neighbor over\nthat\nuh they had kids but i didn't really\nknow them very well and they were like\nhomeschooled which at the time i was\nlike these are weird or whatever i think\nthat was just how my 10 year old brain\nworked um\nand then\nhigh school was fun you know once i got\nthe ability to drive or like friends\nstarted to get the ability to drive was\nlike okay now i don't feel so isolated\nme and my friends can go drive somewhere\ngo do stuff um you know there's a lot of\ncountry redneck activities i guess like\nbonfires and going four-wheeling and all\nthat kind of stuff so\nyeah\nyeah sounds good man so it sounds like\nyou were were you pretty happy growing\nup\nuh yeah yeah\nyeah there were there were definitely\ntimes where like i felt you know like\nlonely or whatever like i said like when\nwe first moved here a new area didn't\nhave any friends lived at home you know\naway from a bunch of you know i couldn't\ngo outside and play with friends anymore\nand i was an only child but\nyeah oh you said you were an only child\nare you still an only child or not\nanymore no not anymore um my parents had\nmy sister when i was 12.\nso yeah\nwhat's it like\nwhat's it like having a younger sister\nuh it's cool it's cool it's very it's\nfunny because like she's getting into\nhigh school now and so\nuh like she's like a little zoomer\nand so like we're like\nwe're both on the internet but like at\ntwo spectrums almost\nso it's like it's pretty fun uh like we\nknow of all the same stuff but we're at\ntwo different ends of everything so\nwhat's it like for her having a brother\nwho's youtube famous\nuh i don't know i've talked about it\nsometimes uh i feel like she tries to\nlike kind of hide from it a little bit\nbut like kids at her school know um i\nfeel like she tries not to make a big\ndeal about it but yeah\nand and how did you\num sounds like it's fun to have a\nyounger sister\nyeah yeah\nand how did you start how did you get\nthe idea to start making stuff on\nyoutube\num\nwhen i went when i was in high school i\nwas in like a mass media class where we\nlike me and my friends like would put on\nthe school news which was like the\nannouncements in the morning but it was\nlike in a video news broadcast format we\nhad a ton of fun with that\nuh and then we would make like videos to\npromote like upcoming events like prom\nwe would make some goofy advertisement\nto advertise prom or whatever and that\nwas like one of my favorite like\ncreative processes was like making goofy\nskits and like putting on the news and\nthat kind of stuff and then when i\nstarted to go to college\num\ni was originally gonna go for\ncommunications but i realized i was like\nwhere am i gonna get a job like in film\nproduction or video production in\nnortheast indiana so i quickly changed\nto just what i was good at which was\nmath i was like all right i'll do\nelectrical engineering or whatever but i\nstill had that itch to like be creative\nvideo wise and i've always been into\nvideo games and so right around that\ntime is when i discovered youtube and\nother people uploading like video game\nstuff so i was like oh i can do this\ni just looked into what to get and just\nstarted\nit was terrible at first\nuh and then on my first ever video i\nuploaded a guy named vanossgaming\nmessaged me on my first video he had\njust started as well and he was like hey\ni'm looking for other people that are\njust starting out uh i liked your first\nvideo he's like you want to play some\ntime we can play and that guy now has 25\nmillion subscribers so\nthat was pretty crazy that literally my\nfirst video i met one of the most\nimportant people in terms of like my\nyoutube career and friends\num\nhow do you how do you understand that\nwhat do you mean\nlike\nwhat do you think about just you know in\nyour first video meeting one of the most\nimportant and influential people\nuh i don't know it's just crazy i mean i\nfeel very lucky um but also it was like\nyou know\nhe just all he did was message and then\njust from there it was just like it was\na natural fit we got along together and\nwe made a lot of funny videos together\nand stuff so complimented each other\nwell\ndo you remember what your first video\nwas about\nlike what were you playing yeah it was\nit was a call of duty commentary like\neverybody back in 2010 2011 it was\nterrible it was filmed on like uh what\nwas it roxio game capture or whatever\nwhich was like 480p but it was like kind\nof upscale it looked terrible i sounded\nterrible i had no idea what i was\ntalking about i was like saying that\nlike i wanted to like create a channel\nto like help people get better but i was\nlike not even good\ni had no idea what i was doing and then\nover the course of the next like year\nand a half everything kind of evolved\nand i actually found out like what type\nof videos i was good at making hey what\nkind of videos are you good at making\nuh just like comedy videos just like\ngoofy stuff with friends so like me and\nmy friends will play whatever game we're\nplaying for a couple hours and turn that\ntwo hours into the funniest edited 10 15\nminutes that we can\num you know it's a lot of just like\ngoofy improv stuff a lot of like role\nplaying stuff\nsounds awesome man sounds like a lot of\nfun\nyeah\ni'm not surprised that you would rather\ndo that\nthan open up boxes oh yeah it's yeah\nyeah\nabsolutely\nthat's how i justified it it makes sense\nto me but yeah man\ni mean you make a strong case for it bro\nyeah\nit's like let me open up this box\nor\nyou know i can get on with friends and\nand make a fun like play games for a\nwhile and yeah and have some fun and\nthen oh by the way this also happens to\nbe my work\nyeah and and so i can pay my bills doing\nthis it sounds like it's a strong\nargument against you know\nopening up boxes\num\nand so it sounds like it took you about\na year and a half and i'm curious like\nwhen you said that you know you kind of\nstarted out out terrible and it took you\na while to kind of find your niche or\nkind of discover what you were good at\nwhat was the process like of being\nterrible\nlike how did you feel about what you\nwere doing\nsix months in yeah i mean i wasn't like\nterrible it was more just like i was in\nno place to like give people tips or\nwhatever so like at the time i made my\nfirst video was like 2011 i think i had\njust gotten high-speed internet at my\nhouse like a few months prior like\nbecause we used to live like i said we\nlived down the middle of nowhere we had\ndial up until like 2010 and then we got\nhigh-speed internet that was like two\nmegabits down like one up\num\nso like i hadn't even really played\nonline much um but like i was decent but\njust definitely in no position like give\ntips and i slowly realized that like i\ndon't take video games that seriously\nlike i you know i just i just play to\nhave fun\ni might get good at a game or something\nbut i don't ever try to like you know\nthat's that's not my goal is to like be\nthe best at any game i play or whatever\nor like i only care about winning like\nit's just having fun with friends and\nmessing around\nokay makes sense\num so i'm i'm kind of hearing that you\nweren't really like you didn't think it\nwas really a problem that six months in\nyou weren't making what you deemed to be\nlike great youtube videos like you it's\ni'm hearing that you were kind of okay\nwith\nnot being good at stuff oh yeah no i no\nyeah i mean i i enjoyed making the\nvideos regardless and they did get some\nattention early just because me and my\nfriends kind of like\nwe acted as a group where if one person\ngrew everybody kind of grew and we\nnetworked in that way\nand so\ni didn't know that they were\nas terrible as i know they are now but i\nmean everybody's old videos are you know\nnot great um but they were getting\nattention and i was growing and so\nyeah i didn't really\nthink too much of it\nokay\nso um thanks for kind of and what's it\nlike making being a uh you know youtube\ncontent creator now like how how do you\num\ni mean it's still really really fun and\nstill just as rewarding um you know i\nfeel very lucky\nbut there's a lot more like\ni don't know i guess like hurdles and\ndifferent things that\nmake it\nhard but it's not\ni don't know it's not too hard even just\nsaying that like\nthat's one of the things like even\ntrying to like make any complaint or\nwhatever about the job just seems so\nlike stupid just because compared to you\nknow\nyou know what what other people do for a\nliving or just i know i'm fortunate to\nbe in the position i'm in so\nhmm\njust did something sneaky there tyler\nso so i do you so i'm hearing you say\nlike you know that there are hurdles and\nchallenges and difficulties to being a\nyoutuber\nand then you were like it's stupid to\nsay those\nwhat things\nyou think about that a little bit\nuh\nwell i just feel like i have a lot of\nlike my problems are not that\nimportant in the grand scheme of things\nin terms of like you know the problems\nthat a lot of people face\num yeah\nwhat does that mean about the problems\nthat you face\num\ni don't know i i don't know\ni just don't feel that they're\nso important that i like\ni don't know i just feel like\ncomplaining about them comes across\nwrong to a lot of people\num\nbecause at the end of the day it's like\na lot of people go through a lot worse\nstuff\nthan just being stressed out or\noverwhelmed or anxious about things\ncan i think for a second\nsure\ni'm almost kind of hearing that because\nyou've been so lucky\nand you're so grateful for what you have\nthat it's not really fair for you to\ncomplain because so many other people\nhave it worse\nsome things yeah i think so\nso if we think about you know the things\nthat we're stressed out about\nif you're stressed out about something\nrelating to your youtube channel and you\ndon't think it's really fair for you to\nbe stressed out about it\nhow do you think that affects your\nability to deal with it effectively\num i definitely think it makes it harder\nhow so\nbecause it\ni feel like i have a natural bias to\njust like shrug a lot of things off\njust like uh like i just i just have to\ndeal with it like it's not that big a\ndeal\nyeah\nso let me ask you a question\nif i say to something in my mind it's\nnot that big of a deal\nand when i sort of\ndownplay something or even devalue it\nwhat do you think that does to my\nability to deal with it\nmakes it a lot harder\nhow\num\njust because you're not making it as\nimportant of a thing to tackle or deal\nwith i guess yeah\nyeah right it's interesting because like\nwhat i'm sort of hearing is that you\nactually go through a process in your\nmind\nthat makes things feel less important\ndoes that make sense\nyeah i mean i i still feel like these\nthings like\nthat they're important but i internalize\nthem a lot more you know i don't like\ni don't like reaching out to other\npeople i guess really\nwhat as much\nwhat makes it hard for you to what makes\nyou not like to reach out to other\npeople\num i don't know i guess i just\nwhen i when i feel personally like all\nlike a lot of people go through a lot\nmore stuff like it's not\ni feel like i would just be reaching out\nto someone that probably has worse\nproblems that they're dealing with than\nmy own i guess\nin some in some ways\nsounds very isolating\na little not i don't know\ni mean i have some i have close friends\nthat i can reach out to you know but\nyeah\nso tyler i'm gonna need your help with\nsomething\nokay\nso i'm gonna need to try to figure out\nso sometimes when i'm talking to people\nand like i point out a potential you\nknow emotional block or something to\nthem they'll say yeah it's like a small\nproblem\nand so i don't know\nif\ni'm making a mountain out of molehill\nor\nyou're making a molehill out of a\nmountain\nbecause the problem with my profession\nis that once we get a hypothesis in our\nmind\nwe come up with all kinds of ideas to\nprove ourselves true irrespective of\nwhat you say right oh he's he's defended\nhe's got resistance he can't face it oh\nhe's got like all these defense\nmechanisms active right versus like like\nhow do we really figure out because what\ni'm hearing is actually like\ndoes it sound\nhow can i say this so i think a lot of\ntimes when i work with content creators\nthey have trouble holding something\ncalled the dialectic which is like\ntwo things that feel opposing but can\nactually coexist at the same time\nso sometimes when i work with my\npatients for example like some of them\nwill feel like\nif someone is angry with me it's\nimpossible for them to love me the idea\nthat someone can love you and be angry\nwith you at the same time is like\nsomething that their mind can't compute\nso what they end up doing is they like\ntip the scales in one way or the other\nso either this person loves me or\nthey're angry with me and when they're\nangry with me they certainly don't love\nme and what i'm hearing you almost do is\nsort of say like do you have a lot to be\ngrateful for do you have it easier than\nother people like absolutely and at the\nsame time like i don't know if you get\nthis bro but being like a successful\nyoutuber is like a pretty high stress\nprofession\nright there's like a lot\nyeah right\nand and furthermore like when you\ndevalue like\nyour experience of that stress as you\npointed out it makes it like way harder\nto deal with\nyeah\nand i'm sort of noticing are you how are\nyou feeling right now you doing okay\nyeah i feel fine okay good so i'm kind\nof noticing that maybe the first step to\nlike why you feel overwhelmed is that\nlike there's a part of your mind\nthere's a problem that you have to deal\nwith but there's a part of your mind\nthat's actually trying to shrink it\nand once you try to shrink it like\nyou can't deal with it appropriately\nlike if i think something is you know\nthis sized\nand then it's easy for me to hold but\nlike i don't really appreciate that it's\nactually this size then this is like way\nharder for me to hold\nand this is the reality of it but\ninstead my mind is like oh it's like not\nthat big of a deal\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nso\ni'm also kind of\ncurious i mean what's stressful so if\nit's okay with you what i'm gonna do is\nlike ask you some questions\nand maybe then what we'll try to do is\nlike try to figure out whether like\nit's you know we'll try to figure out\nwhat the right size is does that make\nsense\nso i'm going to try to unpack some of\nthe devaluing that you do for your own\nproblems\nand i want you to pay attention to how\nyou feel talking about this like do you\nfeel like you're coming across as\nungrateful do you feel like you're\ncoming across as like\nsomeone who's like arrogant and\nshouldn't be complaining and stuff like\nthat can i trust you to do that\nyeah okay so tell me what's stressful\nabout you know you said there are\nhurdles that you have to go through what\ncan you help me understand those\nuh with regards to\nlike you i i asked you like what's it\nlike being a youtuber now and you said\nthere are hurdles and then you went down\nthis track of like i shouldn't complain\num\ni've yeah um\ni don't know\ni feel like there's\na lot of expectations\nput on people with a platform\num\npeople like you know i don't know like\npeople expect a lot of perfection these\ndays i feel like\num\n[Music]\nwhat's i think\ngo ahead go for it\ni don't even remember what i was saying\nbecause you can go oh\nyou're fine\nuh so tell me what what's it like to\nhave people expect perfection from you\nuh i mean it's definitely like stressful\nbecause i know i'm just you know i'm\njust\nanother person we all nobody's perfect\neverybody has\ntheir problems everybody has you know\nlaws\num\nyeah\nwhat's it like to be\nnot perfect and have people expect you\nto be perfect\nstressful\nwhat does that mean\nwhat is it what's stressful about it\ntrying to please people that have an\nunexpected like an un\nan expectation that's just not like\nreality i guess\num\nit sounds like you're being held to an\nimpossible standard\nyeah i mean only to some people right i\nfeel like most people know but only some\npeople yeah\nyeah that sounds i mean it sounds like a\ngame that's rigged that you can't win\nyeah i think i tweeted something similar\nto this like a couple months back was\njust like\nto do youtube you need to like be real\nbut don't be too real because if you're\ntoo real people realize you're not\nperfect and people expect you to be\nperfect i think it's something i tweeted\nlike a couple months ago because that's\nhow that's pretty much how i feel\nsounds like you have to be artificially\nreal\nyes like i like i like trying to be\nauthentic\nbut being authentic means you're going\nto show your own flaws and when you show\nyour own flaws people will judge you and\nyou know\nthink negatively about you\nespecially more so i feel like these\ndays\nwhen i started but\nit sounds hard to be judged by\npeople i mean it just sounds tough like\nit sounds like a game that you're\ndestined to lose\nyeah\nhow do you deal with that man\num\ni don't i i brush a lot of stuff off i\nguess you know like i mean just\nkind of have to have thick skin a little\nbit not care what too many people say\nbut it's also\ndoing youtube it's also important to\nlisten to what people are saying\nyou know um\nat the end of the day you know you have\nto\nyou know you want to have an audience\nand that audience has things that they\nwant from you or or how you behave i\nguess\num\nand so like you want to please those\npeople but at the same time realize that\nlike you're not going to please everyone\nsure\nyeah sounds like you've\nlearned a lot about yourself and how to\nlike interact with like\nthe youtube sphere and people\nyou sound sound like you've really\nadapted to the challenges of your\nenvironment\nyeah i would say\ni'm kind of curious when you say you\nbrush things off\nwhat what does that\nhow do you do that\nwhat happens can you give me an example\nof something that you've had to brush\noff like tell us a story about that\num\ni i don't even know i\ni can't even think of one example but\nokay\num when you made that tweet how did\npeople respond\ni mean a lot of people agreed\num\ni mean i don't think that tweet was\nanything like super controversial but i\nguess that's another thing is like\nalmost anything you say or any opinion\nyou put out these days is controversial\nyou know you have people that disagree\nand\num\nwill judge you based off of that\nthat's really like\nkind of stressful\nso you keep on using this word stressful\nso when people are judging you can you\nhelp me understand like pretend i'm an\nalien\nand i'm trying to understand how humans\nwork and when someone makes a comment\nabout you like what happens in your mind\nand what happens in your body\nlike what does that mean stressful\nwell i mean anytime someone i think says\nsomething about you or like makes a\nstatement about you or judges you in\nsome way you're\nnaturally going to want to be\ndefensive but at the same time it's\nimportant to like\nnot be so confident in yourself that you\nthink\nyou know\nyou're right all the time you know maybe\nthere is some validity to what someone\nis saying and so i think that you know\nit makes your brain\ngo crazy trying to think of all the\npossibilities and everything\nyeah so it's so what happens in your\nmind so i'm i'm hearing\nthere's like i know it sounds kind of\nweird but like\nyou get a comment and then you want to\nbe defensive what does that mean\nuh you want to just shrug it off be like\noh this person doesn't know what they're\ntalking about or this person only knows\nyou know they only know\nthey only know who i am through like\nwhat i you know this window or whatever\nwhatever content i make or whatever i\nsay online or whatever\num you know they don't actually\nknow\nsure\nand so i know i know it sounds kind of\nweird but before you have those thoughts\ndo you feel hurt\ni mean sometimes it depends yeah yeah\nokay\num because you know when you use the\nword defensive i generally think like\nboth the body and the mind we react\ndefensively like when we get hurt\nright so if you think about like a\nphysical like defensive reaction it's\nusually because\nthere's some kind of like stimulus that\nwe're responding to\nyeah\ni guess it's yeah\ni'm not hurt in the sense of like what\nthey say necessarily hurts me but it's\nmore of just like oh there's someone out\nthere that like dislikes me this much or\nwhatever or hates me this much for like\nwhat i see is a dumb reason or whatever\nyou know\num i guess that's what like\ni guess that's what hurts yeah so so i'm\nnoticing there's kind of an initial\nsomething sinks into your mind and then\nyou have a defensive reaction and then\nhow do you end up\ndo you respond to the defensive reaction\nin some way i know we're kind of really\ntunneling down now\num\nsorry what was the question again sorry\num so you get you get defensive\nand then what do you do\num\nyeah i guess just like think whether or\nnot\nlike if there's genuinely something that\ni'm doing wrong or that\nis wrong or there's like what you know\nif there is a flaw\nor if this person is just having\nunreasonable expectations or this person\njust doesn't know me or whatever you\nknow\nso it sounds like then you go go through\nthe process of like thinking through it\nkind of analyze and get things like that\nyeah\nso i'm gonna toss out\num a definition for you i'm curious what\nyou think about that\nso you use the word stressful\nand i was about to ask you tyler what's\nstressful about this process but let me\ntry to toss something out so i i would\nalmost venture that like what i imagine\nis stressful for you is that like you're\ntrying to go about your day and live\nyour life right you got boxes to unpack\nand then someone makes a comment on the\ninternet and then like\nyou no longer get to focus on what you\nwant to do and now your mind has to\nthink through this crap\nit's like you feel a little bit hurt\nthen you kind of feel defensive then you\nhave to kind of think through it it's\nalmost like it's stressful to have this\nthing like dumped on your plate\nyeah i mean i think those two things are\nmore separate than that like i mean if\ni'm disconnected you know if i'm doing\nsomething like just organizing boxes or\nwhatever like i'm\nyou know i'm disconnected from online at\nthat point you know like i'm in my own\nworld just doing my own thing\num\n[Music]\nyeah\nso what do you think what does it mean\nto be what's stressful about this\nprocess of like online judgment\num\n[Music]\ntrying to be just trying to be yourself\nwhile also trying to like make everyone\nhappy that you can't make everyone happy\nyou know okay\nnow sometimes when people have a\nchallenge like that it's something that\nthey actually had like growing up\nand sometimes it's just\ncreated by the internet because that's\nwhat the internet does\nwere there periods of time in your life\nlike before\nyoutube where you felt like you were\nstuck trying to make everyone happy and\ncouldn't live up to expectations\num\nnot\nnot not really in terms of like trying\nto make everyone happy but i guess\num\nyou know trying to like make friends and\nand whatnot\num like like i said when i had first\nmoved you know it was hard for me to\nmake friends in a new environment um\nyeah\nand how did you feel do you remember how\nyou felt\ntrying to make friends in a new\nenvironment\noh yeah like very overwhelmed and\nlonely and upset yeah\nexactly like fourth grade but yeah\nokay so i know this is gonna sound kind\nof weird\nbut\nthe way that you feel nowadays dealing\nwith stress does it feel similar to the\nway that you felt in the fourth grade\nyeah kind of\ncan you help me understand that a little\nbit in some ways\num\njust the the same kind of overwhelming\nfeeling i guess i don't know\nokay\nthe same overwhelming feeling okay\ncan you tell me about the fourth grade\ntyler\num i mean it was fine after i made\nfriends like i i didn't have any kind of\nlike\nreal issues growing up or anything it\nwas more of just\num\nyeah\nthat that you know moving i don't i\ndon't think there's really\nanything from like my childhood that\nreflects on things now i think i'm\ni think it's a very different\ncircumstance now\nbut\ni would agree i think the circumstance\nsounds quite different\nwhich is why i'm a little bit surprised\nthat the feeling feels somewhat similar\nyeah\ni don't know\nso i don't know i don't know if it's\nthat similar but more of just yeah\nall right\ni'm easily overwhelmed i would say\nokay kind of always have been\nokay\ncan you tell me about when you say you\nkind of always have been can you tell me\nlike\ncan you tell me about the fourth grade\ni'm gonna ask again so now i'm hammering\nokay so you got to let me know if this\nfeels weird\nbecause you're you're sending me a lot\nof mixed signals which i can help you\nunpack in a second but\num\nyou say you've always easily been\noverwhelmed which implies that there\nhave been times when you were like\nbefore this whole youtube thing where\nyou got overwhelmed so can you does\nanything pop into your mind about like\nwhen you felt like super overwhelmed\num\nno i i guess the biggest comparison i\nguess would be\num like in school i tried to like\nalways be perfect in terms of like my\nschoolwork\num that could be overwhelming uh and i\nwas like really\nkind of hard on myself\nand always wanted to do really well\num\ni would strive for perfection in that in\nthat way\num\ncan you tell me a little bit about how\nyou decided to major in engineering\nyeah i was just that was just i was\nnaturally good at math math was easy for\nme math was fun\num and so it just seemed like the best\nfit\nobviously there's there's good jobs you\nknow yeah why did you um\nwhy do you think you were so\nperfectionistic in terms of grades\num\ni don't know i guess that was just i\nschool was easy to me\nand so\nand it was like the only you know it was\nlike the most important thing at the\ntime\nand so i just wanted to make sure i did\na good job at it i don't know\nand what's overwhelming about that\nuh\nmaking mistakes not understanding\nsomething you know i didn't understand\nsomething it was really\nstressful to like try and\nyou know have an expectation on myself\nand not be able to meet it i guess\nsure\nand how did you feel about yourself when\nyou didn't live up to your expectations\ni yeah i mean i would get really upset\nat myself\nwhat does that mean\nwhat does that look like um\ni don't i don't know um\ni don't even know just upset at myself\nout you know\ncrying whatever stress whatever i don't\nknow\nwould you kind of beat yourself up in\nyour head tell yourself things like you\nshould be able to do this\nyeah\num\nis that at all how you feel when you\nthink about unpacking a box\nin some ways yes in some ways yeah\nlike this is not a complicated thing but\ni don't understand why like it's so hard\nfor me\num\nor you know or even if it is actually\nhard for me if i'm just being lazy like\nanother expectation i guess\nso\ni'm also wondering whether your mind did\na similar thing when it was like when\nyou didn't get grades like were you like\noh\nhow can i say this is this just hard for\nyou or am i just stupid it's almost like\ncorrelating like is this hard for me or\nlike am i just lazy\nlike i'm\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\ncan i think for a second\nwhat do you think about this\nconversation tyler\num\ni don't know\nit's interesting\na little\nnerve-wracking i guess in a sense just\nyeah but\ni'm trying to figure out do you get the\nsense would it help you if i try to try\nto tell you like where i'm going\nsure yeah okay\nso i'm noticing a couple of connections\num and i want to just explain to you a\nlittle bit about how i understand the\nmind to work\nnow a lot of this this what i'm about to\nshare with you doesn't really come so\nmuch from western psychology but\nthe way that like yogi's studying in\nindia sort of understood the mind to\nwork okay\nso\nit's kind of interesting because they\nnotice that when we experience negative\nemotions especially when we're young we\ndon't know how to process them properly\nand so if you think about the emotional\nenergy of the mind until you like digest\nit so in the west for example we have\nmethods of emotional digestion like\ngoing to therapy\njournaling we go through these like very\nlike you know like active emotional\nprocesses to like you know process\nbreakups grief whatever we go to like\nfunerals and stuff and we like share\nstories like all that kind of stuff is\nlike emotional processing but when\nyou're a kid you don't you know you\ncan't give a eulogy when you're a kid\nbut giving a eulogy can be incredibly\ntherapeutic so what they sort of\nrealized is that we have these\nexperiences early in life and then what\nhappens is we kind of store those\nemotions\nand then what happens is our brain has\nthis scanning function so i know this is\ngoing to sound kind of weird but like\nyou know you can look at a toilet that\nyou've never used before and know how to\nuse the toilet well how is that it's\nbecause your mind has an impr like it\nhas all this data\nand then it recalls the appropriate data\nbased on the appropriate circumstance\ndoes that make sense and so sometimes\nthe emotions that we feel\nin benign situations like unpacking\ncan feel\nactually extra overwhelming because the\nemotion isn't created from the unpacking\nit's actually stored emotion that then\ngets recalled into your mind and makes a\nbenign action feel overwhelming\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nso a good example of this is like if we\nthink about someone with like ptsd right\nso if i've got ptsd and i was like you\nknow in afghanistan or something and\nthen i come back\nhome\nand then they're benign stimuli like\nsomeone banging a car door which will\ntrigger a reaction in me that is\ndisproportionate to the actual like\nevent does that make sense\nyeah so one of the things that i've been\ntrying to suss out is whether\nyour difficulty in unpacking boxes\nbecause you use these like interesting\nwords like because i'll ask you what\ndoes it mean to be stressed what does it\nmean to be overwhelmed and you're not\nable to really give me a good answer you\nkind of noticing that\nyeah\nand so part of the reason for that is\nbecause sometimes when we're young the\nresolution of our feelings is like very\npoor\nand so when i talk to adults that are\nnot able to describe like how they feel\nin the present oftentimes it's because\nit's emotional energy from the past that\nhas a very low resolution we're talking\nlike 120p\nand so i can ask you lots of questions\nabout it doesn't mean you're stupid it\njust means that like\nthe resolution of the emotion is like\nsuper rough because all you really\nremember was feeling like overwhelmed\nbut we're absolutely like if we go back\nand we like listen to the words that you\nuse to describe your current\nstresses and we listen to the words that\nyou use to describe your previous\nstresses they're actually all the same\nwords it's overwhelmed stressed and\nisolated\nthose are the three things that i'm\nhearing from you over and over and over\nagain\nand then it's kind of interesting\nbecause when i ask you about like\nunpacking boxes you're like yeah there's\nsome overlap it's not like one to one\nwhich it's not gonna be because i think\nthere's some amount of stress from\nunpacking boxes and then some amount of\nstress that your mind is like pulling\nback from the past and kind of\nprojecting onto the present\nthere's also a very similar pattern in\nterms of your cognition\nso these are just observations i don't\nknow if this is like true or not right\nthere's no like test for this but one is\nthat like when you're faced with a task\nthere's also the other theme that i'm\nhearing here is expectations\nso it seems like you set high\nexpectations on yourself you have you\nknow a lot of expectations of perfection\nplaced upon you by by you like you know\nthe youtube audience it's really\ninteresting because i've worked with a\nlot of content creators and i've seen\nthis pattern where the kind of\nexpectation that they live up to has to\ndo with what they put on themselves\nso like you have an expectation you're\nlike it's hard to be perfect whereas\nsomeone else may say like it's hard to\nbe like\nyou know\nfunny\nand that's because and then when i talk\nto them it's like back when they were\nyounger they had like concerns that\npeople didn't think they were funny or\nsomething like that so i think like does\nthis make sense like i'm kind of\npointing out themes to you and now i'm\ngoing to kind of just put it back to you\nlike what do you think is any of this\nstuff making sense or am i just you know\nbeing way too analytical and trying to\nlike craft a constellation out of a pile\nof stars\ni mean i think some of it makes sense i\nthink some of it might be a little\nyou know a little\nextrapolated i guess sure i feel like a\nlot of it is just kind of\num like i've never been diagnosed with\nlike adhd or anything but i've heard a\nlot of like\ni forget i saw something on twitter that\nwas like um people with adhd struggle\nwith\nuh tasks if they don't live up to if\nthey don't meet four\nconstraints or something which was\num was it interesting challenging novel\nor urgent and that like resonated with\nme like\na lot\nlike if something is not interesting or\nchallenging or new to me then i will not\ndo it until it is urgent like that is\n100\nhow my brain works\nyeah um\nso have you ever seen a mental health\nprofessional\nno\never been kind of interested in seeing\nif you have adhd\nyeah\nwhat\nwhat keeps you from seeing one\num\njust i guess busyness and\ni feel like i function pretty okay like\ni don't feel like i'm\nyou know i just have\nsome things that i struggle with but i\ndon't think it's like\nenduring my life in any crazy way\num\nyeah\nyeah so i think that's a reasonable\nso i you know i think it's not a bad\nidea to get checked out and at the same\ntime you know one of the criteria for\nbasically any psychiatric disorder or\nany diagnosis is usually impairment to\nfunction\nso if we try to figure out like what's\nthe line between like you know being sad\nand like having clinical depression it's\nlike impairment to function so everyone\nfeels sad everyone i'm not surprised i\nmean i'm kind of the same way where you\nknow it's really hard for me to do\nthings that are\nnot urgent not interesting not\nchallenging\nso out of the stuff that i was kind of\nsharing with you what seemed to make\nsense and what do you think was like too\nmuch of a stretch like what did resonate\num\ni don't i don't know i'm trying to\nremember\ni mean a lot of it definitely resonated\ni think some of\nyou know\ni don't i don't know that there's too\nmuch of like ties from like my childhood\nreally aside from just expectations on\nmyself i definitely think that that\nmakes sense um\nexpectations i put on myself based off\nof\nexpectations\nother people have you know i guess if\nthat makes sense\num\nthat makes sense like that's kind of\nbeen a thing for sure okay so yeah so i\nthink you know the the purpose of having\nconversations like this is like\noccasionally i'm gonna you know sort of\ntake a shotgun approach where i'm gonna\ntoss a lot of crap out and then like i'm\nit's actually like you're the expert\nhere so you're the one who has to say\nhey i think a lot of this stuff is like\nkind of doesn't make sense to me and\nthis kind of thing does\nnow i suspect if you\ni suspect there's there may be a little\nbit of like\nmoney to be found if we talk about\nwhat the early stages of fourth grade\nwas like\num but if you don't want to we don't\nhave to\ni yeah i probably wouldn't want to but\nokay i don't think there's anything\nthere that like that's that significant\ni don't think it was like\ni don't know okay that's totally fine it\nwas just out you know just a kid trying\nto make friends in a place i didn't\ndidn't know you know i think any kid\nwould struggle with that i don't think\nthere's anything really much deeper than\nthat personally but\nyeah so i mean if if you're\nif you don't think it's useful to talk\nabout i think that's totally fine um i i\ndo think you know just like you said\nit's\ni think your experience there\nsounds quite common\nright in the sense that like any kid\nwho's moving to a new place would\nstruggle to make friends like\num the reason that i was thinking that\nmaybe there's something there is because\neven though the experience is common and\nexpected it doesn't it still means that\nmost kids in that situation would be\naffected a particular way yeah\nand even when it comes to sort of\nreaching out with people now like it\nsounds like when you struggle sometimes\nyou feel kind of isolated and you feel\nlike\nnot wanting to reach out to other people\nyeah maybe in terms of like\nyou know yeah with like my problems like\ni don't have any problem like making\nfriends or yeah yeah connecting even\nconnecting with people it's more of just\nlike i just try not to\nburden people i guess with like my\nproblems because i don't feel like like\ni said at the end i don't feel like my\nproblems are\nthat\nyou know\nbad in the grand scheme of things\nsure um\nyeah and that i think makes a lot of\nsense too i think you have a lot to be\nlucky uh uh you have a lot to be\ngrateful for and you're you're quite\nlucky in a lot of ways\nso let me ask you tyler what do you\nthink would be a good use of our time\nif you have any particular ideas that's\nfine otherwise i can give you like two\nor three options\num yeah you can give me some options\nokay so number one is we can try to\nunderstand the process of like unpacking\nboxes because i think we have a little\nbit more information now and we can kind\nof revisit that and try to understand um\nyou know like how does that work like\nhow does our mind work you know how do i\ngo about doing things that are not\nimportant challenging\nurgent\nuh\nthe second thing that i think we the\nsecond track we could go down is you\nmentioned that out of all the stuff that\nsort of resonated with you the\nexpectations that you place on yourself\nseem to be like what kind of stuck out\nthe most so we can try to explore and\nunderstand those a little bit better\nand then\ni think the third thing to potentially\ntalk about is that i do think that\nyour ability to do particular things if\nyou got a little bit better at\nnot devaluing or not\ndiscounting some of your own experiences\nbecause you relate your experience to\nsomeone else\nlike\nyou know i i don't know how to say this\nbut\nyou know i've had\npatients come into my office since you\nknow\nwho've had trauma\nand then what they always do is say like\nbut i it's not like i'm an afghani\nrefugee trying to flee the country right\nwhat they'll do is they'll take their\nexperience which is like painful and\naffects them and they'll say like other\npeople have it worse like i have it\nrelatively like so i had one patient for\nexample who had like\na single encounter of of kind of like\nsexual assault in a public place with a\nstranger\nand so you know he was like a teenage\nkid at the time and then like but one of\nthe things that he kept on saying when\nhe would come to my office is like there\nare people who would get like you know\nabused by family members or pre there\nare people at some like i was just like\na one-time thing it wasn't actually that\nbad you know my parents showed up before\nthings got too crazy and so he had like\nthis really common pattern of saying\nlike oh other people have it bad but for\nsome reason like we kept on kind of\ncoming back to it and he sort of felt\nlike you know it's not really that\ntraumatic\nwhereas it actually was right because it\ndoesn't it sort of doesn't matter\nyou know if i get hit by eight bullets\nand you get hit by one bullet like\nyou've still been hit by a bullet\nyou know that damage is there\nso i'm a little bit\nyou know i think it could help and this\nis something that i found when i work\nwith content creators to sort of you\nknow be able to accept some of the\nfeelings that you have about being like\nyou know kind of getting a bad beat\nsometimes and you can be grateful for\nthings and at the same time hold the\ndialectic of like stuff can suck for you\nlike you're not impervious to that as\nyou pointed out earlier like you are\nhuman\nand just because you have a lot to be\ngrateful for doesn't mean that like\nyou can't\nyou know\nbe unhappy or complain\nyeah\nwhat do you think about those three\noptions so boxes expectations and\nkind of\num\ni think\ntrying to like\nhelp myself\nhandle\ntasks that i find overwhelming i think\nwould be\nmost useful to me\nokay i feel like that's something that i\nreally struggle with\nokay it's only getting worse is like i\nget older and have more responsibilities\nand stuff so\ninteresting okay so let's talk about\nthat so can you tell me a little bit\nabout how it's getting worse with more\nresponsibilities\nthat sounds scary um\nyeah i don't know i mean just as you get\nolder you have more responsibilities you\nhave more people in your life to\nmaintain relationships with or\nyou know more\nthings to take care of or maintain\num you know like my youtube channel\ngrows year over year you know so there's\nalways something new and different um\nso\ni think that kind of stuff\nokay um so do you feel like\nyeah go ahead\nno just there's there's you know there's\njust it feels like you're over here\nthere's always\nnew things that\nneed\nmanaging i guess\nand\nam i hearing that there's like a trend\ntowards like maybe things are getting\nunmanageable at some point or will\nbecome unmanageable at some point\nbecause it's just\nyeah\nis that something you think about or\nworry about\num\nkind of\nlike sometimes i feel like\ni maybe should simplify things you know\num\nbut yeah\nokay\num\nlet me just think for a second so tyler\nwhat do you think would be more helpful\nso if we're taking uh if we're taking\nlike you know how to manage tasks is our\nproblem do you think it would be more\nhelpful for me to sort of explain\nframeworks and like teach a little bit\nor do you want me to try to like help\nexplore like with you and ask you\nquestions what would you prefer\num i think teach i think okay i'm kind\nof getting that vibe too\nso let's start with um\n[Music]\ntasks okay so the first thing that i\nwant to point out is that\nokay let me just can i compose my\nthoughts for a second and kind of come\nup with like\ni'm halfway there okay give me a minute\nyou're fine\ni just don't know how i'm gonna wrap up\ni've got the first half of it\nokay\nall right\ni'm going to compose a story of pure\nfiction\nbased on conjecture about your life\nokay\ngive me a second so i'm gonna pull out\num an ipad and i think i'm gonna need to\ndraw for this so i'm gonna screen share\nwith you okay\nso one of my um\nthere's a streamer who gave me a bit of\nadvice which was to\nhave two wi-fi networks\nand was saying that you know if you have\ntwo wi-fi networks like if one of them\ngoes out you don't have to stop\nstreaming\nso i've done that\nand it works well\nbut the only problem is that um\nnow sometimes all of my things are not\non the same network\nand so like this may be like completely\nbs okay so you tell me if this sounds\nlike it makes sense or not okay so can\nyou see this\nuh yes\nokay\nokay but it's kind of blank right now\nright okay\nso let's start with this so we've got\ntasks\nokay\n[Music]\noh man how am i going to stitch this\ntogether okay so\nso sometimes you do things that are\nstressed like like you've got tasks that\nyou've got to do and then there are the\ntasks that are like important\nlike youtube\nrelationships right\nand then there are the tasks that are\nfun\nsorry for my handwriting i am a medical\ndoctor which means that i suck at\nwriting things i think it's fine um and\nthis can also be relationships right\nyeah and so then you've got your\npriority list and so what happens is\nthat you know naturally like you're\ngonna pick important stuff\nand fun stuff so here's relationships\nand then you know\ndown here is going to be boxes\nbut i think there's\nso we may say that this priority list is\nbased on\num\nyou know things like importance and fun\nbut i think that there are a couple of\nother things that we've sort of hit on\none is avoidance\nokay one is going to be expectation\nand what i mean is like i should be able\nto do this\nright so this is a thought that you have\nwhen it comes to boxes right\nyeah\nokay\nand then um\nthere's also kind of like a where to\nstart\nso i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike these are sort of easy\nbecause you know how to do this and this\nis kind of hard because you don't really\nlike know where to start\nand then the other problem here is that\nlike perfectionism is also in play do\nyou know how so you're like kind of a\nperfectionistic person right\nyeah\nbecause there you are opening a box and\nyou're like but there's like a complete\nsystem\nto do this\nand and opening a box is not something\nthat you can just you can't just open a\nbox\nright what you've got to do is like\nunpack\nand unpack is a really\nlike broad thing that you can't really\nsee to the end of\nyou so it's hard to start because you\ncan't see the end does that make sense\nyeah\nokay so i'm going to teach you something\ninteresting how long have you been\nplaying video games\nuh\ni don't feels like forever i don't know\nsince i was like five or six probably\nokay\nso your brain has wired differently from\nlike people other people's brains so\nhere's an interesting observation i made\ni don't know how much actual data there\nis to support this but i've seen this\npattern time and again is there's two\nkinds of problem solving close-ended\nproblem solving\nand open-ended problem-solving\nand what close-ended problem-solving is\nis like if i give you a set of tasks and\ni kind of give you the rules of the game\nyou will be very good at this\ngamers are very good at close-ended\nproblem-solving like as i understand you\nkind of do like a variety of games right\nso you're not like necessarily an expert\nin a particular thing\nbut if i give you a set of criteria you\ncan shine within it so like if i say\num tyler i want you to make content i\nwant you to play this game with these\nthree people and i want you to have fun\ndoing it like you can do that like you\ncan see the start you can see the end\nand you can sort of figure out like how\nto get from a to z does that make sense\nyeah\nand and you can thrive like you don't\neven need to like really script it out\nor anything you can be kind of organic\nbut you sort of know\nthe steps between like a and z and you\ndo an awesome job with it does that make\nsense\nyep\nso if you look at video games because\nthat's what video games do right like so\nvideo games put boundaries\naround the task to be solved\nso like gamers are really good at\noptimizing dps rotations because\nall of like the buttons that i can press\nand the damage that they do in their\ncast times and things like that those\nare all like entered into the system and\ni have all the puzzle pieces does that\nmake sense\nyeah it's it's almost like if i give you\na bunch of legos like you can put\nsomething together because legos are\nconstrained and like what the pieces are\nso what i found with people who played\nvideo games for a very long time is that\nthey're very good at close-ended\nproblem-solving\nthe other interesting thing is they seem\nworse at open-ended problem-solving\num and so this is like people who are\nlike non-gamers\nso uh i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike if you give a gamer like a task\nlike unpack\nthere is no real start and no real end\nto that right it's kind of like this\nopen-ended thing so this is why gamers\nstruggle to do things like find a job\nso find a job is actually like a pretty\ncomplex abstract process where it's like\nhow do you know you know or get a good\njob let's say that so how do you know\nlike when a job is good enough right\nlike you know you can find maybe a job\nbut like a good job you know that's\nsomething that we really struggle with\nand if you kind of think about it if you\nlook at the development of let's say\nlike someone who's a non-gamer\nthere's this system of graduated\nopen-ended solving okay and what i mean\nby that is like when you're in when\nyou're in school like grade school like\nyou don't really have any choices about\nyour classes right and then you go to\nhigh school and you kind of get to pick\nlike then you have like more choice so\nwhen you're like 10 years old this is\nthe scope of your choice and then when\nyou're 15 years old this is the scope of\nyour choice and then when you go to\ncollege this is the scope of your choice\nand then when you graduate from college\nthis is the scope of your choice does\nthat make sense\nyeah like because you can take like you\nknow you can take a gap year or not take\na gap year and so over time if you look\nat people who are sort of like you know\nkind of like living a regular life\ntheir ability so the abstraction\nincreases the older that you get does\nthat make sense\nbecause at 25 you know you can do\nwhatever you want to\nbut generally speaking what i found with\ngamers is that you know when they're 20\nyears old and they spend their time\nplaying video games instead of getting\nan internship or instead of doing\nextracurriculars the path of a gamer is\nactually like a little bit different\nso what i mean by that is\nhow do i get this thing to\num\nso let's like so if you look at the path\nof the gamer this is the same\nat 15 maybe people are doing\nextracurriculars but gamers are kind of\nhere and then at 20 like you know i may\ngo to classes and i may pick a major and\nstuff but i'm kind of over here and then\nat 25 it's like you've been making\nyoutube for a long time so it's kind of\nlike you're kind of you're kind of doing\nwhat you're doing so and then this gap\nis what i tend to see between gamers and\nnon-gamers with their ability to deal\nwith open-ended problem solving with me\nso far\nyeah so i think the first thing to\nunderstand is that you know this is why\nthese things feel easy like i hate to\nbreak this to you tyler but making a\nsuccessful youtube channel is actually\nlike more complicated than unpacking\nboxes agree or disagree no i agree yeah\nso but why does this feel easier to you\nuh because it just it already happened i\nguess and it kind of just did happen\nnaturally like it wasn't something i\ntried to make happen\nso i would say the reason this feels\neasier is because you're more\nexperienced so what your brain like\nliterally i know this sounds kind of\nweird but what your brain is able to do\nis if i tell you tyler i want you to\nmake a video about fortnite that is like\nan abstract goal but literally what your\nbrain can do is take like video about\nfortnight\nand it can day okay step one's gonna be\nthis step two is gonna be this step\nthree is gonna be this step four is\ngonna be this step five's gonna be this\nstep six is gonna be this and you can do\nthat like you do it in your\nsleep does that make sense\nyeah\nso this is the process that we call\noperationalizing a problem\nso what operationalizing a problem is is\ntaking an abstract goal\nand turning it into steps\ndoes that make sense\nyeah and this process like is actually\nreally hard like if you were to ask me\ndr k make a successful youtube video i\nwould be absolutely overwhelmed i would\nnot know how to do that but in your mind\nlike you're thinking about thumbnail\nyou're thinking about title you're\nthinking about okay who would be good to\npartner with for this particular game\nand your mind is actually like you're so\nyou're so good at this right because\nyou've got like eight million\nsubscribers on youtube or whatever so\nlike you're kind of good at this and you\nknow how to do this process which is\ngoing to be overwhelming for like 99.9\npercent of people\nso the first thing to understand is that\nthis is something that you may want to\noperationalize so if you have trouble\ndoing a process\ninstead of holding it in your head\nokay which i don't know if that makes\nsense but like you know your mind\nautomatically like does this stuff for\nyoutube you may have to like\noperationalize it out like in a\nparticular way so what i mean by that is\nsort of think about okay so if we're\nunpacking boxes one one thing we can\nlook at is number of boxes\nand another thing we can look at is like\nrooms in the house\nyeah\nright and then so the more you kind of\nsit down and you can think like okay but\nthe problem is that like if you unpack\none box maybe it's got kitchen stuff and\nmaybe it's got bedroom stuff\nand that's kind of chaotic and then if\nyou've got rooms in the house the\nproblem is there's stuff stuff in box\none and stuff in box a\ndoes this sort of make sense like why\nthis is hard\nyeah yeah right and so this is what\nfeels overwhelming about\nunpacking because it feels like and yeah\ngo ahead and and what adds to that is\nlike that's not the only task that is\nlike this you know like i might have\nthree or four other things where it's\nlike\nso not only is there a complicated\nprocess to do each individual task but\nthen there's multiple tasks to be done\nand trying to figure out which one you\nknow i should do which is why it's like\noh it's just easier just go\nto youtube or whatever\nyep so now we get to should do love it\nso basically like\nwhat we are asking you to do tyler is\nthe equivalent of asking my my\ngrandmother to figure out a dps rotation\nin final fantasy 14. she can unpack\nboxes\nbut she just doesn't know where to start\nright and it's not that she's stupid and\nit's not that you're stupid it's just\nlike literally think about this bro\nyou've been playing games since the age\nof five where you've been given the\nlegos\nand now what we're doing is we're giving\nyou plato\nand it's like wait this is like way too\nabstract like i need some way to turn\nplato into legos and then i can put\nsomething together like if i were to\ngive you 30 balls of play-doh and say\nmake a horse you could assemble the\nballs into a horse shape easier than you\ncould take a lump of play-doh and like\nform it into a horse does that make\nsense yeah\nand so this has nothing to do with you\nbeing you know like\nincompetent or anything it's just like\nliterally i've noticed that when people\nplay games a lot and especially if\nyou've been making youtube videos for a\ndecade like your brain is equipped to do\na particular task well\nokay\nso so what i would recommend is you know\ntry to create some sort of system\nand be careful because when you create\nthe system this is what your mind is\ngoing to do the perfectionistic\ntendencies are gonna pop up so now\nokay so step number one so if you're\ntrying to do a task okay step number one\nis operationalize it\nthe second thing that you're gonna need\nto do is when you operationalize it\nyou're gonna get resistance\nso when you try to do step number one\nwhat is your mind gonna tell you if i\nwere to tell you okay\num tyler what i want you to do is like\nmake a list of boxes and a list of\nplaces where the things in the boxes go\nand then what's your mind going to say\nto that\nlike oh my god\nwhat is the most efficient way to do\nthis or the best way to do it there it\nis\nyeah\nwhy are you a successful youtuber tyler\nwhat did you do when you started making\nyoutube videos\nuh i always tried to improve them i\nguess i was a bit of a perfectionist\nover time sort of sort of but if you\nreally pay attention go back and watch\nthe vod\nwhen you made your first youtube video\noh i just did it i just\nyeah and that's something that i've\nthat's something that i've been able to\nlike take into doing more things youtube\nrelated like it's like i wanted to do a\npodcast and i was like i don't know how\nto do a podcast i don't really know how\nto interview people so i was like i'm\njust gonna do it and i have gotten\nbetter about that when it comes to\nlike youtube related stuff but yeah i\ndon't know why i still struggle with\nthat in like\nreal life stuff yeah so i think the\nreason you struggle with that in real\nlife stuff is because you are skilled at\nyoutube\nright whereas you're not skilled at the\nother stuff like on your character sheet\nyou're like level 88 at youtube\nand you're like level four and other\nstuff\nyeah so so what we see here if we really\nlook at the times that you've been\nsuccessful what you've been able to do\nis let go of the perfectionism whereas\neven like who the cares if you're\ninefficient with unpacking your boxes\nlike yeah\nyou know\nyou know like but the answer is you care\nyeah just in my head i'm like i want to\nget this done as fast as possible and so\ni yeah\nyeah so now you have to be careful\nbecause\neven when you try to do something so\nthis is the other thing when it comes to\nlike i'm not motivated to do a task so\none thing we can do is operationalize\nthe problem so that we can like create\nbite-size chunks and then approach it\nthis is the tricky thing is that that is\ninsufficient because when we do that our\npsychology creates some kind of\nresistance\ndoes that make sense\nand then the resistance this is\nsomething that's going to feel\nemotionally uncomfortable\nand then what we do\nis when we feel emotionally\nuncomfortable what we do is avoid\nand then this creates the avoidance and\nthen you go back and then once we are\nonce our mind is decided hey this feels\nemotionally uncomfortable i feel like an\nidiot doing this i feel like there's a\nbetter way to do it i feel kind of\nincompetent like how dumb can i possibly\nbe that i can't unpack these boxes\nthere's all that self-judgment and crap\nthat we sort of hit on right and this is\nwhat you call stressful by the way\nthis process is i think what you mean\nwhen you say the word stressful then\nwhat happens is then we get to\njustifications and rationalizations\nso once there's something that you feel\nuncomfortable or you're self-judging\nabout or you're not doing it good enough\ni know i'm tossing a lot of words at you\nbut like\ndoes this sort of make sense\nand then you avoid that and then once\nyour mind decides emotionally\nthat you want to avoid something once it\nbecomes emotionally untenable then it\nrecruits our intellect to rationalize\nand justify and then what it tells you\nis oh by the way like this is more\nimportant and this is more fun it is\nobjectively better for me to do youtube\nthan it is to unpack boxes and then it's\ngame over\nyeah and then you're not going to do it\ndoes that make sense yeah this is yeah\nthis is exactly this is exactly what\nhappens yeah right so now let's think a\nlittle bit about okay how do we deal\nwith this this resistance so this is why\ni was asking you kind of like the\npsychological questions and what we\nreally try to do at healthy gamer it's\nnot about you know digging for like you\nknow deep emotional stuff just for the\nsake of digging for emotional stuff it's\nrecognizing that you have had particular\nexperiences\nwhich are going to create a psychology\nthat you'll be like vulnerable to that\nwill control you in particular ways so\nthe real thing that i would advise you\nto do is the next time you try to pack a\nbox\nlook for this part of the script in your\nmind telling you not to\nright and as long as you see that script\nand then you ask yourself you know why\ncan't i\nand now we're going to get to a stretch\nbecause i don't know if this is actually\nthe case but like i would imagine that\nyou feel somewhat stupid\nfor\nwhen you try to unpack a box\nyeah\nand and then what happens is like you've\ngot this remember this crap up here\nabout self-judgment and like devaluing\nthe way that you feel then we get into\nproblem number three is that you feel\nstupid\nfor not being able to unpack a box\nand then what you say is i shouldn't\nfeel stupid\nyou know this is dumb like i shouldn't\nfeel this way and then when you devalue\nthis feeling you're like ignoring it and\nonce you ignore a particular feeling\nlike you can't deal with it it's sort of\nlike you know if i'm getting aggroed by\na mob and i'm like the mob isn't there\nit's stupid there shouldn't be like this\nthing shouldn't spawn in this zone it's\ndumb it shouldn't be there but does it\nstop the mob from like\nmessing you up right so when you devalue\nyour emotions\nthey start to go like kind of dormant\nin a sense or invisible is maybe a\nbetter word\nand then what they do is they fuel this\nresistance\nbecause most of the resistance that we\nhave to things is actually like\nemotional\nand if as long as you're devaluing it\nnot taking that feeling of stupid like\nseriously it's gonna like mask itself\nand it'll just manifest as resistance to\nyou doing a task\ndoes that make sense\nyeah yep so i know it sounds kind of\nweird but like i would start with first\nof all like the next time you feel like\nyou shouldn't feel a certain way like\ntry to stop yourself\nlike notice that you know even though\nyou're lucky and you've got 8 million\nsubscribers it doesn't mean that your\nlife isn't stressful\nright it's okay for you to feel stressed\nit's okay for you to feel isolated it's\nokay for you to feel alone do other\npeople have it worse than you do yes but\njust because someone else got you know\nyou know like just because bad things\nare happening to other people doesn't\nmean that like bad things aren't going\nto happen to you\nand\nyou know the the guy who found it\nstarted buddhism this guy named buddha\nbuddha\nhad a really interesting revelation that\ni think we've forgotten despite all of\nthe propagation of like mindfulness and\neastern wisdom nowadays which is he said\nthat like dukkha or suffering is like a\nconstant in life\nthat like no amount of privilege or\npower actually\nwill like protect you from suffering\nthat suffering comes it's sort of like\nan internal thing and sure there's like\ndefinitely advantages to having\nprivilege right like there's like lower\nlevels of stress and health outcomes are\nimproved for people who have like\nfinancial security and things like that\nthere are a lot of advantages but the\ninteresting thing is that i don't know\nthat suffering is what we protect from\nand so one of the the hardest things\nthat i try to do is for people who are\nlucky in a lot of ways trying to get\nthem to accept their suffering like you\ncan be lucky and still suffer that kind\nof goes back to the dialectic where like\nsomeone can be angry at you and still\nlove you right but it can be hard to\nhold both of those things like i'm\nincredibly lucky and i also have a lot\nto be stressed out about right like just\nbecause i'm lucky and i'm privileged\ndoesn't mean that like i don't get to\nfeel stress and doesn't mean that i\ndon't deserve compassion from other\nhuman beings or myself\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nquestions\num\nno i mean that all that is yeah that is\nexactly what happens and why i struggle\nto do a lot of things\num and i've i've\ntried to take some steps to like get\nbetter at things so like i have\ni have like i have like a notebook where\ni like write down a to-do list every day\nand i i noticed that like the more i\nbreak everything down\nuh you know like whatever the task like\nunpack boxes instead of that it's like\nunpack these boxes or whatever like\ni break the list down\nas minimal as i can i even put in things\nlike eat or like shower or and it just\nfeels good to cross stuff off like i've\nbeen doing that recently that's been\nsuper helpful\num but yeah is\nwhat you just described is exactly what\nhappens so so you stumbled upon\noperationalizing because then that\nabstract problem in your mind\nyou're chunking up\nand then when you chunk it up it's like\nmore manageable so the other other thing\nand the last thing that i'm going to\nkind of i'm going to share one other\nprinciple with you which is cognitive\nram\nso\nyou know you you kind of said at the\nvery beginning of our interview like the\nmore stuff that piles up on your to-do\nlist\nthe more\ni should be able to like\nyou know like the more\nthe bigger my to-do list is the the\nhigher it should increase in urgency\nand since urgency is a motivator i\nshould be able to act does that make\nsense\nyeah and i also get that get tones of\nthis when you talk about the increased\namount of responsibility with age\nwhich i think you're actually quite\nscared of i think you're afraid that now\ni'm hypothesizing okay so i'm i'm i'm\nhypothesizing that there's a part of you\nthat's actually pretty scared that\nsoon enough things will get so bad that\nyou won't be able to handle it\num\nand we don't we don't have to go down\nthat route but\njust something for you to think about\npossibly yeah um but so you kind of\nthink as urgency increases i should be\nable to do something there's the\nself-judgment by the way\nsee that\nbut the interesting thing is that our\nbrain\nhas like a certain amount of cognitive\nram\nand so like if your mind is holding on\nto like 10 tasks that you need to manage\nthen you only have this much like\nworking ram\nand then something interesting happens\nis that if we only have two tasks that\nwe have to remember then we have this\nmuch working ram\nand so people think that as the number\nof tasks increases the urgency should\nincrease and i should be able to do like\nit should like push me to do things but\nactually what i found and one of my\nyou know meditation teachers told me\nthis like really kind of really\ninteresting is that like the more stuff\nthat your mind has to hold on to it's\nsort of like you know i can't fix\nsomething if i have my hands full\nright i can't actually do any work if i\nhave my hands full so what you really\nwant to do is try to empty your mind and\nthen the more working memory you have\nlike the more you'll be able to do\ntasks does that make sense\nyeah\nand so this is why if you look at it\nlike if i have ten tasks to do and i\ncomplete one\nis nine tasks easier or harder than ten\ntasks\nyeah easier right so we what people\nnotice is like there's the snowball\neffect of like you know 10 is taking up\nthis much space and then nine is taking\nup this much space and then eight is\ntaking up this much space and so what\npeople find is once they start checking\nthings off their to-do list it frees up\nmore of your mind and then you have more\nram to actually work on the remaining\ntasks\nthat's just something for you to kind of\nthink about it's another principle that\ni found\nquestions\num\nno i no this all makes a lot of sense um\nthe cognitive uh ram thing is pretty\nlike i i always use the term mental\nbandwidth so i have something that's\nlike the exact same thing yeah yep yep\nyeah yeah i definitely get like periods\nwhere i feel like\ni can't handle like i don't like someone\nwill message me or something with\nsomething and i just my brain was i\ncan't handle it like i just don't have\na mental bandwidth like\naddress this new thing\nwhen i'm worried about all these other\nthings\nmakes perfect sense\nyeah that's another that's another part\nof all this i guess is like\nnot responding to people right away like\ni feel like you know if i have enough\nthings to do and someone has something\nelse they need from me or whatever it\nmay be\nas simple as it might be i brush it off\nuntil it's like i don't even have like i\ncan't even think about that right now\nlike i have to worry about these things\nor whatever\nyeah so there's two other if you're\ncurious um you know there's a little bit\nlike there's a couple of other\ninteresting things about mental ram\nso\ni'm gonna just share um\ntwo perspectives okay\nso one of my teachers in in india once\ntold me that like every task that is\nleft on complete\nis a karmic drain\nand so what he means by that is like you\nknow if you have i don't know if this is\nreally true but he was kind of saying\nthat like you know if you have an\nintention you make a promise to someone\nand you don't keep that promise\nit sort of karmically like drains your\nenergy because you still have like that\nincomplete task to do and so i thought\nthat it was like kind of an interesting\nexample of like the more things on your\nto-do list you have the harder it is to\ndo things\nand so what he was kind of saying is as\nyou go back and you you sort of complete\nall of your karmic tasks as you complete\nthose karmas and you become like\nspiritually free from it what it\nactually does is like gives you\nspiritual energy and then eventually\nyou'll start like manifesting success\nthat's kind of a weird spiritual\nperspective that i think sort of maps\nonto cognitive ram in some way and the\nother really interesting evidence-based\nperspective is alcoholics anonymous\nand in alcoholics anonymous so\nalcoholics anonymous is really\ninteresting because it seems to be like\na good intervention\nyou know in some ways it like helping\npeople overcome like this biological\naddiction and so if you think about it\nlike you know how does that work we\ndon't really know but alcoholics\nanonymous when i talk to people who are\ntrying to get sober they talk about um\none particular\nstep which helps them a lot and that's\nthe making of men's step\nand so what they do is like they've done\nall of this bad crap in the past and\nsomething about all of that like\nemotional energy creates some degree of\nresistance in avoidance in their mind\nthat then causes them to chase alcohol\nand the ones who do really really well\nare the ones who do the making amends\nstep so like literally what they do is\nthey'll go and they'll like apologize to\nlike random people from 10 years ago\nwhen they were drinking and when they\nwere an and they go back and\nthey just like try to set things right\nthey don't necessarily have to you know\nfix everything they don't have to like\ngo back and graduate from college but\nthey go through this mental process of\nthinking about you know who's everyone\nthat i've screwed over like what are all\nthe bad things that i've done and then\nthey go and they try to track those\npeople down they say hey i'm sorry for\ndoing that and something really cool\nhappens which is that when they go\nthrough this making amends phase\nsomething happens with their cognitive\nram and they're much more able to sort\nof like control their alcohol and like\nresist its impulses so i think these are\njust sort of two really interesting\nobservations from other dimensions based\non that kind of relate to mental\nbandwidth unclear what's sort of\nscientifically valid and what isn't it's\njust interesting when there's you know\nthree different perspectives that are\nall kind of speaking to the same thing\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\num but it's really fascinating that you\nknow the science the neuroscience and\npsychology of how alcoholics anonymous\nworks\num\nokay so other thoughts or questions\num\nno um\ni think\ni think i also prioritize like doing\nthings for others before\nmyself when it comes to like like that\nkind of ties back to the relationship\nthing yeah in terms of like if i have\nsomething\nsuper simple that i need done but you\nknow a friend of mine or something has\nsomething super simple that they need\ndone like that always like is something\nthat takes priority too\num\nyeah bro so you really gotta work on\nnot devaluing yourself\nyeah\ni totally get that\nright because relationships is up here\nand yeah like i like i i\ntyler is not necessarily that i like i\nprioritize other people more of just\nlike i'd rather\nlet myself down you know than like let\nsomeone else down you know what i mean\nlike if i have someone who expects\nsomething from me\nthat's definitely like yeah\nso i i it's classic tyler because if a\nfriend asked you hey tyler this saturday\ncan you help me move in you'd be like\nabsolutely bro\nyeah all right\nyou'll help someone else unpack boxes at\nthe drop of a hat\nreally common\nreally really common\nit's just because you're a good person\nbut there's a there's an interesting\npart of that which is that so here's\nkind of what i would summarize for you\ntyler it sounds like you've already\nstarted to figure out how to\noperationalize that will help you unpack\nyour boxes\nwhen you think about unpacking a box be\ncareful because watch i want you to look\nfor it okay i want you to like you know\nplace a hidden camera and prepare\nyourself for like oh this is inefficient\nand i could do this better i should do\nthis better it would be so much easier\nif i did it this way look for that\nthought\nand then like look for this thought too\nwhere i i shouldn't feel stupid this\nshould be easy for me i should be able\nto handle this\nbecause all that crap is going to be\ndevaluing it and as best as you can what\ni want you to do in that moment is like\nkind of notice those thoughts and like\nlook for them because they're going to\nbe psychological patterns it's like\nprogram it's like malware in your brain\nso prepare when i open up firefox\nthere's going to be pop-ups telling me\nto purchase this penis enlargement pill\nright like you're going to look for it\nand then if you're prepared for it it's\ngoing to be a lot easier to close\nokay\nand\nyeah\nand then it it you know in a more\nlong-term sense you know if you're\ninterested in seeing a mental health\nprofessional i think it could be good\nyou know if you're curious about whether\nyou have adhd or not you could kind of\nget an evaluation for that but i i think\nthis there's you got to be really\ncareful because you're such a good dude\nand you recognize that you're so lucky\nand you have so much gratitude that\nyou're almost kind of skirting right on\nthe edge of what i would call toxic\npositivity\nwhich is like oh my god like i should be\ngrateful like yeah and you are grateful\nright like the important thing is to be\ngrateful and also be compassionate\ntowards yourself\n[Music]\nthoughts\nquestions no that makes sense\nokay um\ngo ahead\nnope\ngo for it\nso you were gonna ask a question yeah i\nwas just gonna ask like how how was this\nfor you like in terms of when we kind of\njust went through that and like is this\nlike helpful or\nyeah definitely helpful um i just know\nthat i feel like there's like\na lot to unpack i feel like and it's\nyeah it's just a lot to think about and\nunpack and\ni'm still\nuh you know admittedly like i'm\ndefinitely still like a little anxious\nand nervous about this just like i said\nopening up in front of you know an\naudience is something that's like really\nsure uh difficult and even i feel like\neven for me more so than like you know a\nstreamer or something like i don't\ntypically stream most of my stuff is\njust making videos and so like when it\ncomes to my online presence it's just\nlike i said it's just those 10 minutes\nof funny good times with friends i don't\nreally try to delve into\na whole lot of\nyou know behind the scenes kind of\npersonal stuff um\nit's definitely it's hard for me but\nyeah so i i kind of noticed that and i\nthink that's totally fine like we don't\nhave to do what's hard for you so this\nis where it's important tyler i think\nyou doing that work is important it's\nabsolutely not necessary to do live in\nfront of the internet\nlike you know\nit's about your growth and what you feel\ncomfortable with so i would encourage\nyou to you know spend a little bit i\ndon't know like who you've got in your\nlife but like you know if you want to\nsee a therapist or something that's\ntotally fine otherwise you know i would\nhonestly spend some time like thinking\nabout the first few weeks of fourth\ngrade\nand what that was like for you and like\nlet yourself\nalmost be like an older brother\nto your fourth grade self\nand tell yourself like you know you must\nhave been frightened that you wouldn't\nmake friends like it's\nterrifying dude like does it happen to a\nlot of kids yeah like it happened to me\ntoo and like i remember\nhow terrifying it was\nbecause you didn't know like the second\nday you went and the third day you went\nyou didn't have friends like you didn't\nknow like does this like am i gonna make\na friend on the fourth day\nit feels like you're never gonna make a\nfriend\nyeah and so some of those kinds of like\nthoughts and emotions and stuff like\nthey still carry with you\nyou know and i don't think you need to\ntalk about it here i'm glad you told me\nyou know we talked a little bit about\nboundaries even even at the beginning\nbut um so i'm glad you sort of said yeah\ni don't think that would be that useful\ni think it's actually important for you\nto do but i don't think you need to go\non stream\nyou know this way\njournal or take a walk or like talk to\nyour dog\nyou know like yeah\nyou know the dog's gonna listen a whole\nlot right now but yeah no he'll you'll\nbe surprised\nso you know pet therapy is an\nevidence-based intervention that helps\npeople with with you know dealing with\ngrief and things like that people live\nlonger\npets are awesome at this kind of stuff\nyeah\nbut i i don't think you need to open up\nin front of the internet you know we're\nhere to help you and like do whatever\nmeet you where you're at and we're here\nto help and if it\nopening up on the internet doesn't have\nto be a part of it\nyeah\nyeah it's just i don't know it's just\nvery hard for me um yeah\nfor whatever reason i don't know\nif you want to be conscious in that\nregard i guess yeah sure i mean if you\nwant to we can talk for a second about\nwhy it's hard for you but we also don't\nhave to\nwhat makes it hard for you\nuh\ni don't know i guess just circling back\nto like what i talked about before is\njust like caring about how people\nperceive me and stuff um i mean\nobviously\nit's\nimportant when it comes to doing youtube\nlike i said to like listen to what\npeople think but at the same time it's\nlike i i\nyou only let in\nyou only show people what you want to\nshow them and\ni don't know i guess it's just worrying\nin that regard not funny being judged i\nguess you know and what are you afraid\nof what is the judgment that you're\nafraid will happen if you open up on the\ninternet\ni don't know\ni don't know i guess it's probably a\nlittle irrational i guess because i\ndon't feel like\ni don't know\nhard to explain\nyeah so i don't think it's irrational\nso watch out for those kinds of\nstatements\nright so there you are doing what to\nyourself\nuh i guess devaluing yeah i feel a\nlittle bit yeah yeah right oh it's\nstupid for me to feel this way\nyeah\nno it's not\nand and so i i think if you really like\nlook at it like i suspect\num\nyou know i don't i don't know how much\nwe want to have this conversation\nbecause i think we could get to feelings\nso we'll just i'll get you started\num and and so you know i suspect you\nknow what are you afraid people will\nthink\nlet me just ask you that\ni don't\ni'm not afraid of any like one specific\nthing i guess just\nlike i don't it's not fun to be judged\nby people who just they don't know you\nyou know and in\ni'm not i don't feel like i'm the\ngreatest at like articulating how i feel\nor\nyou know my thoughts a lot of times so\nmaybe someone could have form an opinion\nabout me based on something i said even\nthough what i said is not really\nhow i felt it was just how i happened\nyou know what i mean like how i happen\nto say it or whatever\num\n[Music]\nyeah so i know this sounds kind of weird\nbut like\nthat's a very common\nthing for your profession\nso it's almost like it's own like i i\ndon't know you know i don't know how\nmuch of this is you and how much of this\nis just being a streamer because like\nliterally what happens on youtube is\nlike people will take a slice\nof what you're trying to represent and\nread into it and judge it\nright so like like people who are on\nyoutube and twitch and tick tock and\ninstagram and stuff like you all get\nreally really you all learn the hard way\nthat like any kind of communication that\nis unfiltered\nis like\nyou know letting off a firework inside\nthe house you have no idea where it's\ngonna end up\nbecause you all get punished\nfor being unfiltered\num is this something deep and\npsychological relating to your you know\nearlier life or is it a function is it\nlike just one of the consequences of\nyour job i'd probably say like 50 50.\nyeah i would say probably more the\nsecond but maybe\nyeah\nmaybe more the second like i said i've\nseen it in just about every successful\ncontent creator i've ever worked with\num so i think that that makes a lot of\nsense\nbut i think it's you know are you\nconcerned about your inability to open\nup\num\na little bit\ndefinitely something i've struggled with\na lot\num\nwhat are you concerned about\nnot not i i just don't think it i mean i\ndon't think it's healthy\nnot even about like opening up online\nbut just in general you know like it's\ngood to talk to people and\nand\nvoice you know your thoughts and\nfeelings\num\ni found myself doing that\non twitter at times and i'm like why why\nof all places would i ever like\ngo to twitter like i don't know\nwhat are you looking for when you post\non twitter like that i don't know it's\nmore just venting i guess you know just\ngetting something off my chest it's not\neven like i'm looking for approval from\nanyone specific or anything it's more of\njust\nit's a thought collected and then put\nout i guess\nyeah\nwhat do you think makes it hard for you\nto do that even in private\num\ni don't know\nno idea okay\nso i'll\ngive you\ngive you some thoughts okay so first of\nall\nwell actually let's let's\none more question so do you feel a\nlittle bit incompetent at not being able\nto do that\nyeah i would say yeah okay so this is a\ntheme so when i said 50 50.\nso i i'm noticing a thread\nthat when there's something that you\nfeel like you should do\nyou feel kind of incompetent and then it\nmakes it really hard to do it to begin\nwith\nso whether that's opening up whether\nthat's unpacking boxes there's something\nabout and and this i think is like now\npretty specific\nto something that you carry with you\nright because you've got a particular\nlike psychological thing where like\nyou're it's not specific to you by the\nway tons of people have this which is\nwhy we do this online in the first place\nbecause i can guarantee you there are\nlike you know hundreds or thousands of\npeople who feel the exact same way and\nso this is something that's really\ncommon is that somewhere along the way\nour society teaches us that like\ncompetent like we we blur the lines\nbetween like experience and like talent\nso i'd say that the reason that it's\nhard for you to open up is because you\nhaven't had practice\nyeah it makes sense\nand so i don't think that you're\nbusted in some way i don't think that\nthere's anything wrong with you i think\nit's like hard for you to open up\nbecause\nyou know you may have just grown up in\nan environment where there wasn't a\nwhole lot of that you know if we really\nwant to hypothesize like\ni'd say 20 percent of people with your\nexperience when you were back in the\nfourth grade i know i keep going back\nthere we don't have to talk about it but\ni'm trying to copy with stuff yeah you\nknow there's a chance that you had a\nconversation with your mom and your dad\nwhere you said hey i don't like school\ni'm not making any friends i want to\nmove back\nand i'd say one out of five people\nhad an experience like that that where\ntheir parents said sorry we can't do\nthat and even though it's completely\nreasonable\ntheir answer is completely reasonable it\ncan be psychologically jarring\nalmost like traumatic in a sense\nand then like people\neven people who are normal healthy\npeople with happy upbringings\nwe all have things because our minds are\nunderdeveloped so we don't really know\nhow to interpret that stuff and what you\ncan learn in that moment is like opening\nup to other people like doesn't help\nand once your mind learns that kind of\nthing it can be like really hard to open\nup to other people\nthat makes sense yeah so i'd say lack of\npractice\num you know once again i would notice\nthat self-judgment and and remind\nyourself that it's okay to not be able\nto open up\nyou know like even if you're\ntheoretically coming on twitch to open\nup you know open up you do what\nyou're you do what you're ready for\ntyler and whatever you do today is\nperfect there's nothing better that you\ncould do and nothing worse that you\ncould do you're great just the way that\nyou are whatever you've done is awesome\nwhich i know may sound like a foreign\nidea but like really i believe that\nand practice you know like maybe open up\nto a therapist or something like that\ni'd recommend doing it you know\nprivately because i think every\nadvantage to help you in opening up\nwould be a good thing\nand then the last thing to really think\nabout is have there been times in my\nlife where i've tried to open up to\npeople and it hasn't worked really well\nand even something that you said about\nthe sensitivity of like you may not be\ntrying to convey something but like you\nyou convey something that then get gets\nmisinterpreted by people so that's a\nspecific fear that you have now i don't\nknow if that fear comes from the\ninternet which is completely reasonable\nor whether there have been times that\nhave nothing to do with the internet\nwhere you've tried to articulate\nfeelings\nand you've learned hey i'm not very good\nat this and i'm not able to convey what\ni want to\ntherefore i'm not going to try\nso those kinds of experiences could\nexist in your past as well\nyeah\nthat makes a lot of sense\num\nyeah i have like now now i'm thinking of\nexact scenarios yeah that has happened\nyeah yep\num\nyeah definitely stuff things in school\num\nlike where i would get emotional\nwould have you know like i would get\nmade fun of\nand stuff in school for that you know\num\nyeah that's definitely one thing for\nsure yeah\nso i noticed we're coming right up on\nthe edge of emotions\nand based on some of the boundaries that\nyou've set i'm not gonna ask you about\nthat today\ni think we're gonna go ahead and wrap up\nare you okay with that yeah that's\nperfect okay\nso so just the connecting the dots is\nwhat we're here for not the\nentertainment value so we're just gonna\nyou know so now that you kind of you\nknow think about those things you can\nfeel that emotion coming up that's that\ndormant emotion which has been there all\nalong\nright and as you kind of feel it like i\nwant you to go take a walk with your dog\nor whatever and like if you want to go\ncry in the bathroom or whatever you need\nto do you go and you process your\nemotions with someone that you care\nabout in a place that you feel safe\nand then then you'll be able to express\nit you'll you're on your journey dude\nyou'll get there right\nyou've focused you've invested all of\nyour leveling up points into being an\nawesome youtube creator\nand look at how awesome you've done and\nso you've got this other side of the\nskill set your character sheet which you\nneed to spend some time work on so work\non it you know it's all good bro\nyeah you're very welcome man no yeah\nthat's been good um\nyeah i definitely\ndefinitely probably should go\ntalk\nsomeone and work through a lot of stuff\nmakes a lot of sense yeah yeah yeah yeah\nyou don't have to do it on the internet\nyeah\nthe purpose of you coming here is to get\nyou to a place where you can go and and\nyou know\ndo it in a place that you feel safe\nbecause i think you owe it to yourself\nand especially i don't the one thing\nthat i really dislike about your thought\nprocess is the way that you blame\nyourself for things that i really don't\nthink are your fault\nand that it's okay to not be perfect and\nit's okay to not know how to do stuff\nlike it's just\nyou know you're heavily invested in\nbecoming an awesome youtube creator so\ncool so you're 28 years old you have a\nlong way to go i have no idea if you're\nin a relationship or you have kids or\nthings like that\nbut you know as those things become a\nmore important part of your life you\nshould do this kind of work and it'll be\nawesome like you'll be able to you know\ndo awesome and all that kind of stuff\ni'm sure\nwhatever you try you're already good at\nbut\nsound good\nyeah that was great you want to tell\npeople um any last thoughts or questions\nand then maybe tell people where they\ncan find you and and stuff like that\num\nyeah no no last thoughts other than um\nthat was good thank you
