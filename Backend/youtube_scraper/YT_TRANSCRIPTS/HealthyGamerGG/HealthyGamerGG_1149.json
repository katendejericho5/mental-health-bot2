    "transcript": "so for this person and everyone else out\nthere who's stuck trying to find a\ncareer what i'd say is like think about\nwhat you're passionate about first\nand then try to figure out how can i\nmake this work as a job how can i get\ncompensated for doing this\nhow do i find a career when everything\nin life is boring to me i've tried\ncollege and self-study in the past but i\nnever finished anything i've switched\nmajors like eight times and i was still\nunhappy i just can't see really see\nmyself doing anything to be honest in\nthe past ten years the only career\nfields i've worked on have been\nrestaurants\nand clinics working in the billing call\ncenter departments i've hated them both\nbecause both are dead end low paying\nstressful and soul-crushing\ni don't care about being super rich i\njust want to find something that pays\ndecent and that also doesn't make me\nwant to kill myself by the end of the\nweek\nthis is something that i can absolutely\nsympathize with empathize with\num you know i had a period of time in my\nlife when i was like\nreally felt like everything was sort of\na dead end and and nothing was really\nworking for me so let's take a look at\nthis because i think this is a really\ncommon problem so nowadays a lot of\npeople\nstruggle to find a career and find\neverything to be boring right so they're\nlike i tried this i found it boring i\ntried this i found it boring like how do\ni figure out like what kind of career to\nhave\nso i want to talk to you all a little\nbit about how we approach decision\nmaking and how to find the right career\nfor you okay so the first thing\nis that we have this idea that like we\nneed a career right and so like there's\nwe're sort of like taught like\nsocietally that there is oh god so this\nis a really common problem that people\nhave right they'll say like how do i\nfind the right career for me like i've\ntried this i've tried this i did this\nfor a while\nand um you know none of it really worked\ni didn't enjoy it how do i find the\nright career\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwe tend to think about\na career right we say to ourselves like\noh like i need a career of some kind\nthe other thing that tends to happen is\nif we look at how people make decisions\nit's basically like monkey see monkey do\nso i remember i was working with a a you\nknow a young patient of mine who um had\nstarted to use substances and so i was\nhis addiction psychiatrist and he had\ngone to a 30-day rehab and he was trying\nto figure out you know what to do with\nhis life and i you know i was kind of\nasking okay so like what's your plan\ngoing forward and he's like well you\nknow i've got a body that works at\nan auto shop so i think he can hook me\nup with a job\nand so it was really interesting because\nas i talked to him what i realized is\nlike the options that he was considering\nare basically\nexactly what's in front of him so we as\nhuman beings tend to be like very monkey\nsee monkey do so like based on when we\nthink about the options for like what we\nshould do with ourselves\nit tends to be based on things that are\nimmediately available like so i'm the\nchild of two doctors and i grew up in a\nsmall town in east texas\nwhere three out of five of the indian\nkids in my class like in my grade there\nwere like five indian kids that were in\nmy grade in the entire city three of\nthem wound up becoming doctors so when i\nwas growing up and i went to college\nlike i majored in pre-med because that's\njust what people\ndid\nright\nso when we look at decision making\nwhat we tend to do is we don't actually\nmake like\nobjective decisions we don't really look\nat all of the choices available to us we\ntend to reach for the first thing that\nis available to us\nso like it's kind of weird because this\nis there's a there's a good um\nexploration of this kind of thing\nin um who's that nobel prize-winning\neconomist daniel kahneman so i think he\nsort of talks about this it's important\nin medicine as well\nwhere one of the things that doctors are\ntrained how to do is to not\nmake decisions based on the first thing\nthat pops into their head or the second\nthing or the third thing or the fourth\nthing so a lot of times doctors make\nmistakes when they sort of rely on like\ntheir first instinct to make a decision\nand what we train doctors to do is\nsomething called differential diagnosis\nwhich is to think through all of the\npossibilities before settling on one\nso i see this a lot where people are\ntrying to figure out what should my\ncareer be i've tried all this stuff i've\ntried switching majors eight times and\nit still hasn't worked what do i do so\ni'd say the first thing to do is to take\na step back and to really think about\nokay what are all of the possibilities\nhere construct a differential diagnosis\nabout how you can spend your time and\nwhen someone says i can't figure out\nwhat my career is i'd say that's\nactually too narrow to begin with\nbecause forget about a career like i you\nknow even a career is maybe not like is\nthe problem is that your mind is coming\nup with solutions that are already so\nnarrow so if your problem is that i\ndon't i can't find a career i enjoy i\nthink part of that problem is because\nyour mind is narrowly chasing options\nfor a career and by doing so you may\nactually miss out on all kinds of things\nthat you could earn like a livable wage\nwith but your mind won't even consider\nthem because you're locked into this\nidea of career\nbecause the problem is that when you\nthink about career right like then you\nstart thinking about things like call\ncenter oh i can get a job at a call\ncenter i can get a job at a billing\ndepartment i can get a job in food\nservice so you're reaching for the\nsimplest thing the most available thing\ninstead of considering all of your\noptions\nso what i'd strongly recommend is take a\nstep back from the idea of a career\nentirely even if we look at how we\nstarted a healthy gamer like this is a\nmental health startup that's relatively\nsuccessful right like we're doing some\ngood stuff we're helping some people\nthings like that i did not start out\nlike thinking i'mma create a mental\nhealth startup and quit my job that is\nreally not what i cared about at all it\nwas like hey there's uh there's there's\nlike people who are really struggling in\na particular way and i'm gonna try to\nhelp these people because it seems like\nno one else is\nand so when you're really thinking about\nwhat you should do the first thing i do\nis take a step back from the idea of\ncareer\nand so this person was kind of saying\neverything that i've tried is boring\nso then what i'd say is like take even a\nfurther step back and ask yourself the\nquestion if you're trying to find a\nnon-boring career start by asking\nyourself what do you enjoy and forget\nabout the career right start to think\nlike okay what what was the was what's\nsomething that i'm genuinely interested\nin what's something that i enjoy doing\nwhat's something that i you know really\nlike\nkind of been passionate about when was\nthe last time that i really had a lot of\nfun doing something\nwhen was the last time i was\nintellectually engaged what do i care\nabout what do i think i can do to make\nthe world like a better place like\nwhat's some kind of problem in the world\nthat i would like to have an impact on\nand you have to be kind of careful here\nbecause your mind may go for more what\nwe call premature closure because it may\nsay oh i'm really passionate about\nyou know\nlike equal rights\nbut i have no qualifications okay and so\nthen then what your mind does is it'll\nsay oh that's not an option because i\nhave no qualifications that's a\npremature closure too\num thinking about a career is also a\npremature closure so what we want to do\nis take a really big step back\nand then start to think about what you\nactually care about what you find\ninteresting\nand then once you pick a couple of those\nthings then what we're gonna do is like\nan investigation based on what you find\ninteresting\nand what the purpose of an investigation\nis a couple fold the first is like it's\nreally interesting because i don't know\nif you guys know this but like there are\nprofessional dms in new york city that\nwill charge like 400 a week to run like\na dm'ing session right and so you may\nsay to yourself like i never realized\nthat was a career i don't even know if\nit is a career but what some people\ndiscovered is that hey i'm really really\npassionate about this and it does seem\nlike there's a lack of good dms so\nthere's actually like people who are\nwilling to pay like like 400 bucks a\nweek you've got like you know people who\nare\nyou know maybe investment bankers or\nwhatever like in new york city there's\nlike five people in the group they're\nall willing to chip in 80 bucks a week\nand like that's their entertainment\nbudget because if you go out a single\nnight like you go to dinner and you get\ndrinks in new york city it's like 200\nbucks at a minimum right so there's\nactually like supply and there's demand\nand like i've actually met some\nprofessional dms and it's kind of\ninteresting\nyou may say to yourself oh i never\nrealized that was a career and like yeah\nbecause we don't think about that as a\ncareer right it's not something that\npeople around you are going to be\nregularly doing but there are all kinds\nof niche opportunities for you to make a\nlivable wage doing something that you\nlove\nand the key thing to get into that kind\nof thinking is to step out of the idea\nof a career so i'd say start with\nsomething like thinking about what do\nyou actually enjoy what do you care\nabout what do you like find interesting\nand then what you want to do is start to\nthink a little bit about okay like i'm\nhow can i pursue this how can i make\nthis work and then something really\nfascinating will happen so let's say\nthat you're interested in like you know\nequal rights or whatever like\nthen the interesting thing is you may\nnot have any skill set\nbut as you start to like move towards\nsomething that you genuinely care about\nthe ability to do things that you don't\nenjoy will become far more tolerable so\nthe problem right now is that we have a\ngroup of people who like go to school\nand they have no end game in mind\nthey're not going to school for a\nparticular reason that they're\npassionate about this is something in\naddiction psychiatry that we call a\ncompeting interest so this is a really\nimportant principle\nif you want to do something that's very\nvery difficult\nyou have to have a competing interest so\nan addiction psychiatry if you want to\nget someone to quit smoking smoking\noffers a strong biological reward it\noffers dopamine it offers nicotine it\noffers socialization it helps calm you\ndown it's an easy way to meet people so\nsmoking has all of these advantages and\nit turns out that if you want to get\nsomeone to quit smoking you can't just\ngive them information and say hey you're\ngoing to get heart disease you're going\nto get lung cancer you'll get bad you\nknow complications of covid all of that\ninformation doesn't actually affect\nbehavior what affects behavior is a\ncompeting interest something that you\ncare about and once you develop a\ncompeting interest so you know my\nfavorite thing in terms of working with\nsmokers is i'll ask them like what do\nthey care about right what do they think\nis interesting\nand so i had you know one patient and\nthis is sort of the example that i use\nso i had one patient who was a smoker\nand i tried to explain and this is early\non in my career and so i tried to\nexplain to them i was like okay if you\nif you smoke you're gonna get lung\ncancer do you want lung cancer and he's\nlike no i don't want lung cancer comes\nin a month later i'm like how's your\nsmoking going is oh i'm still smoking\ni'm like okay you'll also get heart\ndisease you'll get stroke comes in a\nmonth later\nand he's like still smoking right\nso then finally i get to like talk to\nthe guy and i get to know him and then\nlike it turns out that he's got a\ndaughter and he's like really happy and\nlike he's you know he likes his daughter\na lot and then you know i even try this\nsort of thing where it's sort of like\nhey like you know if you want to stay\nalive and healthy for your daughter like\nyou know maybe you should quit smoking\nhe's like yeah that sounds really\nimportant but he still continues to\nsmoke so one day we talk a little bit\nabout oh you know would you like to walk\nyour daughter down the aisle one day and\nhe's like yeah absolutely and then i\nasked him you know when you walk your\ndaughter down the aisle do you want to\nbe wheeling an oxygen tank behind you\nand then he's\nlike no\nright so like he's got this vision he's\nworking really hard he's like trying to\nbe a good parent he wants to like\nlike be there for his daughter and then\nit's about finding something that they\ncare about and once you develop that\ncompeting interest\nthat competing interest that thing that\nyou care about then becomes enough to\novercome all of the biology all of the\ndopamine all of the nicotine all of the\nthe you know social aspects of smoking\nand then over the next like six to eight\nmonths he actually like quit smoking\nand it's all about developing a\ncompeting interest and the problem right\nnow that i see is that a lot of people\nlike find a career because it's logical\nit's good on paper but that logical\nadvantage of like oh i should do this\nand should do this is not enough to\nactually overcome\nthe suffering that you have to go\nthrough for the career\nso as you think about what you actually\ncare about and then you enroll in a\nschool with a purpose and then even\nthough you don't want to take statistics\neven though you don't want to take you\nknow philosophy or like intro to\nchemistry\nonce you have a good competing interest\nand you're like hey this is something\nthat i actually care about i want to\nlearn this and this\nthis is what i'm passionate about and\nthen what you do is you align your\ncareer behind your passions right\nit's not how do i find a career that i\ncan enjoy and like your passions are\nsitting over here you start by like\nthinking about what you care about what\nyou enjoy and then you try to do like a\nvery systematic process of making it\nwork\nso i'd say like if we go back to this\nreddit post we can kind of see it pretty\nclearly that like you know i want you\nall to pay attention to this how do i\nfind a career when everything in life is\nboring to me i don't think everything in\nlife is boring\nright what we see is that i've tried\ncollege and self-study but i never\nfinished anything i keep on switching\nmajors and i'm still unhappy so the real\nquestion that this person should be\nasking is what are you attracted to what\ndo you gravitate towards what do you\ncare about what do you genuinely enjoy\ndoing\nand then be careful because your mind\nmay tell you oh you can't do that\nbecause x y z\nand the cool thing is that when your\nmind tells you you can't do that because\nxyz\nthat is actually going to be like your\nsolution\nso as your mind tells you you can't do\nthat because you haven't graduated from\ncollege then you know what you need to\ndo you need to graduate from college\nwell you can't graduate from college\nuntil you get into college okay so then\nit sounds like what we need to do is get\ninto college you can't get into college\nwithout applying to college okay then it\nsounds like i need to write an\napplication and the cool thing is then\nwhen you write your college application\nand you write your college essay if you\nhave that end goal in mind like when you\nlook at your essay it's going to be like\nwhy do you want to go to college i want\nto go to college because i'm interested\nin supporting equal rights and\ndeveloping countries i want to go to\ncollege because i'm interested in\nesports i want to study creative writing\nbecause i want to be a professional dm\nand i want formal training and sort of\nconstructing adventures and storytelling\nlike\ncolleges love\nseeing unorthodox candidates that have\nlike interesting ideas about what they\nwant to do\nright it's really fascinating and what i\nfound time and time and time again is\nthat people who are able to do this\nprocess of taking a step back really\nthink about what you enjoy doing think\nabout what you're passionate about and\nthen if you have to make some sacrifices\nalong the way to get to where you want\nto go it works out really really well\nso for this person and everyone else out\nthere who's stuck trying to find a\ncareer what i'd say is like think about\nwhat you're passionate about first\nand then try to figure out how can i\nmake this work as a job how can i get\ncompensated for doing this\nand like literally it was like i enjoy\ntalking to gamers all day like that's\nwhat i like doing i like helping people\nwith their problems so one way that i\nwas able to turn that into a career is\nby going to medical school and becoming\na psychiatrist but then i was also like\nyou know that's not insufficient for me\ni actually like vibing with chat so what\nare we gonna do i guess maybe i'll start\nstreaming on twitch and like i don't\nknow if y'all get this but like i just\nstarted streaming on twitch one day\nright like i had like 10 people who were\nviewers and then we had like 15 and then\nwe had 50 and then we had 200 we were\nlike sitting around 200 viewers for a\ncouple of weeks and if you're passionate\nabout something and you kind of give it\nyour all and you try really hard it\nturns out that i think the world will\nkind of respond to you like pretty well\nand that's why we have professional dms\nwe've got people who are like hey i\nreally love dming and like that's their\njob now so what if he doesn't know what\nhe enjoys doing or he lost interest in\neverything he used to love like me so\nthat's a great question so then the\nquestion becomes how did you lose\ninterest right because that passion is\nthere it's just buried and so then well\ni think we'll have a couple of other\nposts today that that may relate to that\nbut like\ninterest is something that is not like\ngained or lost i think it tends to be\nburied or not buried\nso a case in point like i had kova the\nlast two weeks so like all of the things\nthat i was passionate about and\ninterested in i didn't care about\nright like when you've got covid you\njust don't care about anything you're\nkind of an hedonic\neven playing video games and stuff would\nlike not be fun so then there's like a\nthere's a process of sort of uncovering\nwhat you enjoy what you love like where\ndid you lose sight of it what made you\nlose sight of it there also all kinds of\nlike physical things that you can do\nright you can take care of your body and\nthen your interest will naturally grow\nso you can do stuff like yoga meditation\neating healthy food like all that kind\nof stuff is going to be good for you you\nknow if you go see your doctor you know\nget your vitamin d levels checked\nget um you know there are all kinds of\nbiological things that can result in a\nlack of motivation so you can kind of\nwork on some of those things\nand remember that just because you've\nlost your interest doesn't mean that you\ncan't find it again you have to really\nfigure out how it got buried"
