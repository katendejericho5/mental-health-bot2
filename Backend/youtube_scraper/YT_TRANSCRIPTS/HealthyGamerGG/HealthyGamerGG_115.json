would say on a on a deeper level\nit's more like when when we say work on\nyourself that involves all kinds of like\nthings about moving your life forward\nand they struggle with motivation in\nthese\nthings it's because when I don't think\nI'm worth\nit I'm not worth fixing\n[Music]\n[Music]\nyou\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\nwhen you develop empathy and compassion\nfor other\npeople there's going to be room for\nsomeone else in the\nrelationship and then this in turn is\ngoing to reduce the feeling of being an\nobject\nnow two people can\nconnect and now it's not about

gamer\nG stream my name is allo kenoa just a\nreminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if youall have a medical concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional and good luck with that\nhighly recommend him huge fan huge fan\nof licensed\nprofessionals um let's see what are we\ntalking about today so let's just get\nchat where we can see you I need to be\nable to see a chat eyes on chat today so\nuh welcome everybody we're halfway\nthrough mental health awareness month\nwhich is a huge month for us we have a\nlot of cool stuff that we try to do um\nwe work really really hard to try to get\nit going\nso um yeah I see someone saying happy\nFriday someone else is saying uh I don't\nknow what ADHD is anymore yeah that's\nwhat we're going to be talking about so\ntoday you know it's so interesting\nbecause the\nmore so like we talk about\nADHD and when we talk about ADHD people\nlike oh that's so interesting and then\nlike like people seem to be interested\nin it right because the the rate of ADHD\ndiagnosis is increasing and not just\nthat but we also see a lot of people who\nidentify with having\nADHD without necessarily a formal\ndiagnosis of it so something is going on\nwe'll talk a little bit about\nthat um but yeah so we're we're going to\nlike dive into it further we're going to\nlook at a couple of different angles for\nADHD we're going to focus a little bit\ntoday on time blindness socializing and\na couple of other interesting like\naspects of it so we're learning more and\nmore about the Neuroscience of it and\nwhat's actually going on and it's\nfascinating um so we're going to be\ntalking about ADHD and hopefully we'll\nunderstand I I think I'm still\nunderstanding like what it is like as a\npsychiatrist you know I think it's it\nit's so\ninteresting what I mean we learned some\nBasics right but like it's so\ninteresting How deep the research\nactually goes and how much we've learned\nabout what's going\non I think we have a a video coming out\nsoon on ADHD and women specifically so I\nthink that's in post- production but\nbefore we um get into that we got to do\nsomething else\nso in May he we do a lot of cool stuff\nhere at HG so we've\ngot we got some different stuff going on\nand what we try to do in May in addition\nto making like good lectures and things\nlike that having interviews um which you\nknow we've been streaming a lot more\nthan we usually do uh we also have a lot\nof cool community events and the reason\nthat we do this is\nbecause watching YouTube videos and or\nwatching live streams on Twitch or\nwhatever like watching videos about\nimproving your life doesn't NE\nnecessarily improve your life so that we\nhave some very very very limited data\nvery poor quality it's really just a\nsignal that we\ndetected um kind of on the side so\nbasically what we found is that our\ncoaching program was becoming less\neffective over time so we like noticed\nthat we had particular outcomes that\nwere quite strong and then like a year\nlater our outcomes seemed to be getting\nworse and then we were super confused by\nthat worried by that we looked into why\nour outcome is getting worse so what we\nnoticed is that the percent of\nimprovement was\ndecreasing and it turned out that the\nreason that the percentage of\nimprovement was decreasing is because\npeople were coming in healthier right so\nif I if I like measure my healthiness\nfrom 1 to 10 and my unhealthiness like\none is like I'm super unhealthy so what\nused to happen in our pilot study was\nlike people would come in at like a four\nand they would like move to a seven and\nthen about a year later they would like\ncome in at a five and they would move to\na seven so the delta went from like 3 to\ntwo and so we were a little bit worried\nthat like oh does that mean that you\nknow the quality of coaching is\ndegrading no it just means that people\nare coming in healthier and then we\nlooked into that a little bit further\nand it seemed like people who you know\nwatch a lot of our content seem to maybe\nbe getting better um but we haven't\nreally formally studied that in a\nprospective way so that's not really a\nstatement we can it it's a hypothesis\nit's not a statement of fact if that\nmakes sense um anyway so that being said\nI know so maybe maybe we can help a\nlittle bit right and we certainly hear\nthat feedback that oh I watched this\nlecture and it was like really helpful\ngreat that's why we do them but I I\nthink what we really want yall to do\nhere at HG is like put your lives\ntogether right don't just watch videos\nabout putting your lives together\nactually put your lives together and we\nhave a lot of cool stuff going on uh on\nDiscord right now so I'm going to show\nyou all a couple cool things we have a\nhackathon and we have a creative Jam so\num this is so yall can join the Discord\nright now and if y'all like actually\nwant to do stuff right and I think Thor\nis a great example of someone who like\nprompts his community to do a lot of\nthings and it's really great and we've\nbeen doing this kind of stuff for a\ncouple years and we try to mix it\nup right so looking for group this is\ngreat so it's like you can log into your\nMMO and join the lfg group and then you\ncan do some kind of raid and you can get\nsome piece of shiny loots that is a\ndifferent color from the other loots and\nthe numbers on the those shiny loots are\nlarger than the numbers on the less\nshiny loots and then you can celebrate\nafter 8 hours of effort yay or what you\ncan do is join our hackathon looking for\ngroup and like join a group of people\nfind projects that actually matter uh\nyou know to build something practice\nlike and it's awesome our our community\nis great at this so we also have a\ncreative\nJam um so this is looking for teams so\nthese are people who share their uh you\nknow who they are and what they're good\nat um you know designer 3D modeling\nrendering and then you can also like how\nto use this forum so like this is for uh\nyou know if if you want to post about a\nproject you can go over to organizing\nteam let's make a card game bartering\nactivity for building local communities\napp development like that's really\ninteresting right so there's like all\nkinds of stuff going on so definitely\ncheck it out I I think a big part of\nwhat we try to do here is give you all a\nchance to apply what you learn and and\nreally operationalize it out and um I\nknow we're going to be talking about\nADHD today\num but it's also interesting because one\nof the the deficits in ADHD is the\ninability to self-organize very easily\nand so often times people with ADH do\nbetter do better with external structure\nand so if you're one of those people you\nknow definitely try to use this the\nstructure that we're trying to provide\nfor yall and and try to actually build\nsome\nstuff um so in the creative Jam we've\ngot teams of two to six that make\nwhatever yall decide right so it can be\nlike an infographic animated skit film\nwhatever um and then we're going to vote\non submissions to help choose the\nwinning piece and then in the hackathon\nuh we're going to create you all get to\nkind of decide whatever to create but\neither tools to develop improve mental\nhealth um develop something like a game\napp whatever else you want to uh\nsubmissions will be judged by some of\nour devs and every member of the winning\nteam gets access to the new trauma\nmodule um which by the way uh and this\nstuff is going to run until Monday okay\nso y'all can still get involved and\nbuild something over the weekend um\nwhich also we have the trauma module\ncoming out so I I don't know if youall\nhave seen Dr K's guide to trauma let me\nsee if I can find it\num let's\nsee can I\nactually how can I\nsee the trauma\nmodule okay I can't there we\ngo right so this is where we talk about\na lot of things there are a lot of\nConcepts that I think were really\nreally\num important for our community and we've\nsort of built that into a trauma model\nmodule it's something that we really\nbuilt for yall so this is not like a\nmodule that's about I mean it can be\nuseful for clinicians but the the way\nthat we built and this has been about\ntwo years in the works by the way and\njust so you all understand basically\nlike I have a choice between writing a\nbook and making a a module um it's about\nthe same amount of effort and uh the the\nthe goal behind the trauma module was\nwas like two things first of all like\nwhen I look at our community and I see\nand I I read subreddit a lot I read what\ny'all say you know I I pay attention to\nchat and so I I'm kind of like listening\nto what y'all struggle with and then the\nquestion kind of becomes\nso you know the question becomes how can\nwe help you and the challenge is that if\nyou look at people asking for help in\nour community it is a specific instance\nI struggle with this I struggle with\ndating I'm I'm 24 years old and I\nhaven't graduated from University\nI I graduated from University and I\ndon't have a a job that I enjoy I feel\nlike switching careers but it also feels\nlike a waste we see all of these\nindividual\nproblems and so my challenge is like\nokay so we could we could like take this\nindividual problem and solve it\nindividually but that is very difficult\nto do it's um I mean that's what we do\nin our coaching program right so was\nlike we help people work through things\nand we get really good outcomes there\nbut then the question is\nthey're solving the problem which we can\nget really good outcomes in a short\namount of time but the other thing that\nwe can also do is equip yall with a\nbasic understanding of yourself your\nmotivation why it's difficult to make\ndecisions how to deal how to understand\ninternal conflict we can give you all\nkind of like a Playbook about yourselves\nand if we give you a Playbook about\nyourselves it won't solve your\nindividual problem but it will give you\na robust toolkit to better understand\nyourself and solve problems by yourself\nin the future so that\ntoolkit is a huge part of what went into\nthe trauma module the second thing that\nwent into the trauma module is in my\nwork as a\npsychiatrist I noticed that there is a\nlot of stuff that I think qualifies as\nfully Psychotherapy which is individual\nthings but that for a lot of my patients\nI end up teaching so part of\nPsychotherapy is also something called\npsychoeducation which is not exclusively\nin in the therapy realm so psycho\neducation is very important it's about\nteaching people how they work so the\ntrauma module is also like okay if I was\na clinician and I did not have enough\ntime and I don't have enough time to\nteach all of these things to my patients\nand I could send each of my patients who\nhave some history of trauma to a class\nand I was like go learn these these\nparticular things about trauma then we\ncan work together that's what the trauma\nmodule is so it's not by any means a\nreplacement for therapy it's not even\nsomething that is trying to be a\nreplacement for therapy what it really\nis is an adject right so it's all the\nstuff that you can learn about the way\nthat your body works your physiology\ngets wired the way that trauma is\nManifest in the mind what is the\nNeuroscience of it how does trauma lead\nto things like emotional numbness and\nhow you can like understand all those\nConcepts so that you can utilize\nwhatever healing modity you decide to\nuse like more effectively so that's\nreally what it's about um we've been\nworking on it for 2 years so and it\ncomes out on Monday um and so\nyeah uh I see someone got the audible\n[Laughter]\nbook um someone's saying that they they\ngot the book yeah so the other thing is\nif you guys want help with communication\nI'd say definitely check out our book\nit's like it's designed for parents\ncommunicating with their kids but the\nmore that I real\nwhat so I was thinking about it you know\nwhat I should have done is I should have\nwritten a book about kids communicating\nwith your parents that's what I should\nhave done right how to how to talk to\nyour parents and then I see this a lot\nlike I I see a lot of you know today's\nrelationship Fridays so uh you know the\nReddit is is extra fun today and what I\nI really think that like if y'all\nlearned like really not even\ncommunication 101 like the book teaches\ncommunication 101 and communication 20\none it's like some highle communication\ntechniques it's a lot of what I do on\nstream um I I saw that uh Charlie Hooper\ndid a review of our interview with sneo\nand like if y'all want to learn how to\ntalk like that check out the book like\nwe we teach y'all the the most basic you\nknow like if you're like playing Street\nFighter there's like you know short\npunch medium punch and long punch and\nthen there's block and there's short\nkick medium kick and long kick and it's\nlike that's what we're going to teach\nyou it's not some super ex whatever it's\nlike some of the basic nuts and bolts\nthat actually gets you like 80% of where\nyou need to go in communication that's\nmy honest to God opinion of it and um\nthe these communication skills are\nreally really\ngood so it it really is no so like\nspacing you guys are talking about\nspacing and all this kind of stuff like\nwe're not even there yet right so like\nwe got to understand this okay so and I\nguess we can we can hop right in\nokay so this is like now I guess we're\ngetting to it\nchat okay\nso neurod Divergent people tend to move\nin packs like poorly emotionally\nregulated wolves so if all of your\nfriends have ADHD I have some news for\nyou so this is somewhat true but this is\nwhat I'm saying is like what we're\nworking on is like we're playing Street\nFighter but we don't even know how to\npunch your kick so like we're losing\ngames and the reason we're losing games\nis because we don't know the basics so I\nI want youall to think about this\nokay if you want to be a good\ncommunicator if you want to be a a\ncommunicator that is in the top 20% of\ncommunication skills on the planet maybe\neven top\n10% you need to do very little\nwork now this may sound\nconfusing because you're saying hold on\na second how can I get into the top 10 %\nby doing very little\nwork and I want yall to think about how\nmuch formal communication training have\nyou received how many how much form\nformal communication training have your\nparents received how much formal\ncommunication training have your friends\nreceived how how much formal\ncommunication have has your pack of\nneurode Divergent emotionally\ndisregulated wolves friends received so\nthe reason that you can become such a\ngood community Ator so easily is because\nwe don't formally study it at all right\nso like I want yall to imagine that\nthere's some tribe that existed\nsomewhere on the planet like 10,000\nyears\nago and the concept of like focus\ntraining on archery or exercise or\nclimbing or something like that this\nidea of like focused and deliberate\npractice see most human beings just kind\nof do like what we feel like right our\nbrain does some like automatic learning\nfor us and then if our brain's automatic\nlearning circuits are messed up then we\nrun into some problems but very little\nformal training can go a very long way\nand that's what we see like when we have\nour parent program and even when we we\nhave our our coach curriculum right so\nwe'll take like people from the internet\nand we'll put them through some\ncommunication skills stuff and like they\nthey become very good communicators very\nquickly and like really like\ncommunication is one of the most\nimportant skills because it's I mean\nit's like a buff for Co-Op right it like\nit it's a buff for Co-Op it allows you\nto play co-op better and better and\nbetter it's like Charisma which in 5 is\nan OP\nstat so definitely check that out if you\nguys are interested in being better\ncommunicators um but we're going to dive\nmore\ninto ADHD\nokay all right so let's let's dive\nin every ADHD at some point what if I\ndon't really have ADHD what if I just\nhave a complex series of personal flaws\nthat map onto ADHD experiences that are\nincredibly relatable to other AD other\npeople with ADHD and every failing in my\nlife is entirely and unequivocally my\nfault okay so this is a very common\nexperience of people with ADHD where\nthey like look at\ntheir forget about adg for a second this\nis a very common experience right and\nthis experience happens for three\nreasons the first is\nthat when we have flaws and someone\ntells us hey this flaw is due to your\nADHD what our mind actually says is it\nresponds with this every failing isn't\nthe ADHD it is entirely and\nunequivocally my fault okay so this is\nwhere like we don't like to blame our\nADHD for our problems this is number one\nso why don't we like to blame ADHD for\nour problems it's very simple because\nour understanding of ourselves is not\nconsistent with blame of of of an\nexternal thing so our understanding of\nourselves is consistent with blaming\nourselves so let's understand literally\nwhat\nhappens so we know for example that\npeople with\nADHD um I'll just pull up a quick paper\nOkay so let's take a look at some\nresearch in summary ADHD increases the\nrisk for depression especially during\nadolescence and young adulthood however\nit is not well understood why ADHD\nincreases the risk for depression at\nthis stage so this is true this actually\nwe figured out okay so this is a a\nreview paper that's looking at cognitive\nmechanisms underlying depressive\ndisorders in ADHD a systematic review\nand this is sort of looking at how ADHD\nleads to depression so if we look at\nthis let's understand a couple of things\nabout depression actually let's go back\nto this real quick okay so let's look at\nthis so oh I have a complex series of\npersonal flaws that map on to ADHD and\nevery failing in my life is entirely and\nunequivocally my\nfault so this is very common for people\nto think and it turns out that the\nreason people think this way is not\nbecause it's true but because we've been\ntrained to conceptualize things in that\nway if we have ADHD so I'll explain what\nI\nmean so here's what happens we have a\nton of research on\nthis give me a second\nchat so here's why people with ADHD\ndon't think that they have ADHD they\nthink that they just have a set of very\nunique personal problems and they don't\nlike to blame their\nADHD question is why why chat let's\nunderstand so here's what\nhappens here's you as a kid\nand humans are actually pretty good at\nestimating IQ maybe that statement is\nfactually incorrect I don't know but\ngenerally speaking like kids can tell\nwhen like another kid is smart or\nanother kid is dumb this may change a\nlittle bit later once we start getting\nphds and we use big words but generally\nspeaking like you can tell when\nsomeone's stupid right and you can kind\nof tell when someone's smart so kids go\nto school and there's a group of kids\nand we all sort of recognize I that our\nIQ is in the same\nballpark okay now here you have a kid\nwith\nADHD and you recognize that I'm about as\nsmart as the other kids then what\nhappens is you look at your performance\nthis kid gets an a this kid gets a b and\nI get an\nf and there are lots of studies that\nshow this we we go into a lot of the\ndetailed research in Dr K's guide to\nADHD and doing stuff it's like super\nscary so there's a study that looks at\nif you look at kids with ADHD and\ndepression there's one study that found\nthat if you get diagnosed with\ndepression first there is a 3% chance\nthat you will get diagnosed with ADHD as\nan adult if you get diagnosed with\ndepression as a kid if you get diagnosed\nwith ADHD as a kid there is a 70% chance\nthat you will have depression as an\nadult this is from a comorbid population\nokay so that's important to keep in mind\nso there's some something wonky it's not\nthat it's don't please don't take this\nas 70% of kids with\nADHD grow up to have depression I don't\nthink that that is factually correct the\ncomorbidity is somewhere around 30%\nright so the majority of people have one\nor the other but when you look at people\nwho have both the likelihood that the\nADHD precedes the depression is way\nhigher than the other way around now I\nknow that's a slightly complicated\nsentence but we're trying to stay\nfaithful to the research and the nuances\nokay so now you're a kid and what we\nknow from ADHD is that when you were a\nkid with ADHD often times it is not\ndiagnosed so ADHD is both the most\nunderdiagnosed and\noverdiagnosed mental illness in my\nopinion which means that we diagnose it\na ton in people who don't have it and we\ndiag we miss it a lot in people who do\nso this is also incredibly common for\ngirls so if you're a girl with ADHD the\nrate of diagnosis of girls to boys is 1\nto three so three boys get diagnosed\nwith ADHD for every one girl gets\ndiagnosed the interesting thing is that\nif you look at\nwomen to men this is one:\none so how do we understand this two\nthings one is that girls usually have a\nfrontal lobe that is developed one year\nahead of their male counterparts so one\nstudy showed that if you look at a boy\nwho uh a girl at the age of 10 will have\nlike a frontal lobe that's about 11.5\nyears old versus a boy will have a\nfrontal lobe that's about 10.5 years old\nat somewhere around 10 years okay so\nwhat that means is that when someone is\nlike looking at a a boy versus a\ngirl the girl is like their brains are\nlike one year more\nmature another reason for that we miss\ndiagnose uh girls we miss the diagnosis\nof ADHD and girls is because the most\nmost common symptom that leads to\ndiagnosis is hyperactivity and girls are\nmuch less likely to be hyperactive the\nthird thing that changes is during uh\npuberty we get an in increased\nestrogen Alters our dopaminergic\ncircuitry and so we start to see a lot\nof like impulsivity and other kinds of\nlike seek dop Bean seeking activity\nhappen more in women so there's a\npuberty effect as well anyway Point here\nis that this doesn't get\ndiagnosed so when this kid doesn't get\ndiagnosed I want youall to think about\nimagine that you're a seven-year-old\nchild and you recognize that you are\njust as smart as your friends but you\nsee that there is a huge performance\ndifference and then on top of that what\nhappens is your\nteachers your\nparents diagnose you with an effort\nproblem they said that you just need to\ntry hard\nI don't understand why you can't just\nstudy why can't you sit still why can't\nyou go to bed on time I've been calling\nyou 15\ntimes you need to try\nharder so now this is really confusing\nso what really [ __ ] people up is when\nyou were\ndoing see when you're doing everything\nright and you know this may be like bold\nstatement here but\nso I think the single most damaging\nthing and this is I guess it's hyperbole\nbut honestly it's the way I feel in this\nmoment like the single most damage thing\ndamaging thing I've seen as a\npsychiatrist is when someone is doing\nsomething completely correctly and you\ntell them that they are doing it\ncompletely wrong so the single most\ndamaging thing what really screws people\nup for life is when they get taught that\nUp Is Down and Down is up so I'll give\nyou all a simple examp example of this\nso let's say I have abusive\nparents and I am doing my best to make\nthem happy right so I'm actually like\nbeing extra careful I'm trying extra\nhard I'm working extra hard I don't want\nmy parents to yell at me but my parents\nare\nalcoholics and so they're drunk and then\nthey yell and then they blame me even\nwhen I don't do anything\nwrong so the reason that this is so\npsychologically damaging is because your\nbrain brain thinks that doing the right\nthing is the wrong thing and then if you\ngo through life thinking that the right\nthing is the wrong thing it [ __ ] up so\nmany parts of your\nlife and we see this also I see this in\nlike romantic relationships right that\nare abusive where there's like one\npartner who's like you do everything\nwrong but the person is is like\ntechnically doing everything right so\nwhen you get taught that right is\nwrong and that there is no way to\nachieve right this creates learned\nhelplessness this creates a very\nconfusing way to navigate life because\nin the right answer no longer becomes\nright you know it's like you you want\nyou want to know how to [ __ ] up people's\nability to do Finance in mathematics you\ntell them 2 plus 2 is 5 and they're like\nno I think it's four and you're like No\n2 plus 2 is 5 2 plus 2 is five there's\nthis great scene from Star Trek\nTNG where captain peard is getting oh\n[ __ ] I wonder if I can find it can I\nshow this or is it do I\nget oh\nman yeah so this is like this is a great\nepisode I don't know if you guys watch\nTNG\nbut one of the best lines in start in\ntrack has to be peard yelling there are\nfour lights so this is like in this part\nof this episode I mean the spoiler let\nthe show aired in the 80s okay so like\nbasically like in this episode and this\nwhat is what makes Captain bicard such a\nChad so there's like he's being tortured\nand like this this is portrayed in Star\nTrek let's see if we can find the\nclip um this is being portrayed in Star\nTrek\nas Captain\nPicard there are yeah look at that dude\nlet's go okay\nso this this is great us as you will be\nfor a long long\ntime you do however have a\nchoice you can Dev out your life in\nmisery hell we're just going to watch\nthis cuz it's subject to my\nwhims or you can live in Comfort with\ngood food and warm\nclothing women as you desire them allow\nto pursue your studies of philosophy and\nhistory I would enjoy debating with you\nyou have a ke you familiar with this\nchat it's up to you A life of ease of\nreflection and intellectual\nchallenge or\nthis TNG is such a great show dude what\nmust I\ndo nothing\nreally tell\nme how many lights you see\nhow\n[Music]\nmany how many\nlines this is your last chance the\nguards coming don't be a stubborn fool\nhow\nmany you told me he would be ready to\ngo we had some unfinished\nbusiness get him cleaned up a ship is\nwaiting to take him back to the\nEnterprise Captain\nBard if you'll go with the guards\nthey'll take care of\n[Music]\nyou if you guys haven't seen this I know\nit's kind of weird\nfor\n[Music]\nlight there's the legs okay so I I guess\nthere you it doesn't really show the\ngreat context so all right we're going\nto explain this a little bit all right\nso in this\nepisode Picard is getting tortured by\nthe card Kardashians\nKardashians and and so basically the\nguys like you know there's four lights\nand he's like trying to convince he\ntortures peard until peard says there\nare five lights so he's like trying to\nget peard to lie so he's like trying to\ndivorce this person's mind from\nreality and what I think is is is\nhilarious and sad about this is in the\nshow Captain peard is like very very\nResolute right so he's like very strong\ninternally so he can resist torture and\nthe problem with ADHD is it's the exact\nopposite so peard is like a\n65-year-old you know Starship captain of\nthe the flag sheet Flagship of the\nEnterprise I mean the flag Flagship of\nthe\nFederation and but when you're like six\nwith ADHD you don't have the internal\nfortitude of a\n65-year-old fictional character like you\njust don't have that internal fortitude\nso when the rest of the world tells you\nthat you need to be working\nharder it really messes you up you you\nbegin to learn that 2 plus 2 is you\nbegin to learn because everyone around\nis telling you everyone around you is\ntelling you that you're screwing up and\nyou need to put forth more effort so\nwhat happens is I want youall to think\nabout this\nokay so what ends up happening is when\nyou're in this situation where you're\ngetting fs and your friends are getting\nas's and B's and everyone tells you you\nneed to be working\nharder I want you all to think about\nthis if my IQ is equal to other people\nplus a variable X\nF and if someone else's IQ plus variable\nor actually let's let's say let's just\ndo\nthis so actually I'll do it this\nway right so let's say that what you see\nin other people is you see that they\nhave an IQ of 100 and they get an A you\nhave an IQ of 100 plus X but you get an\nF so what do you conclude here you\nconclude that X must be some large\nnegative number\nnumber and this is literally what\nhappens that we have studies on this so\nthen what happens is you you begin to\nbelieve that you have some kind of\ndeficit there is something wrong with me\nthere is something fundamentally broken\nand when there's something wrong with me\nand fundamentally broken this belief is\nwhat contributes to the\ndepression so what happens is people\nwith ADHD carry they have this learned\nbelief of Shame and that there's\nsomething I am putting forth so much\neffort because my brain does not have\nthe capacity to focus and yet I'm\npushing it I pushing it I pushing it and\nI yield very little therefore I must be\nfundamentally broken this mathematical\nequation is what I see time and time and\ntime again with\nADHD and now what happens is you carry\nthis belief even though it's not true\nnow later on you have this belief that\nyou have a broken something that is\nalways with you and when you have a\nbroken\nsomething then what happens is you look\nat your life and you say I am broken\nthere's something every failing is my\nlife uh in my life is entirely and\nunequivocally my\nfault this is what this is what happen\nso this is a consequence of ADHD if you\ndoubt your ADHD in this way this is the\nconsequence of\nADHD and why do you believe this it's\nbecause when\nwhen you were failing no one said\nsomething else is wrong right the blame\ngot placed on you there's a lack of\neffort you need to live up to your\npotential if you just applied yourself\nyou'd do so much better where is the\nflaw where is the flaw where is the flaw\nit's inside me it's inside me it's\ninside me and what happens with these\nkids it's super sad because at some\npoint the kid may try to talk to the\nparent and say like I know I'm smart but\nthey don't know how to articulate like I\ndon't know what's wrong with me\nsometimes they'll say that right\nactually that's what they say literally\nthey say I don't know what's wrong with\nme but there is something wrong with you\nyou've got\nADHD right you're a neurodiverse\nindividual trying to succeed in a\nneurotypical world so there's even some\nevidence when we look at sort of the the\nstress diathesis model of\nillness what it presumes is that illness\nis the the result of an environment plus\nlike a genetic\nrisk right so it's not even that\nsomething is objectively wrong with you\nit is that there is an environmental\ncomponent to the manifestation of\ndisease so you can look at someone who\nhas a predisposition for alcohol\nuse or alcohol dependence and then you\ncan give them stressful circumstances\nyou can give them trauma you can even\nstart them on an SSRI or anti-depressant\nmedication which by the way increases\nyour risk of alcohol dependence which is\nsuper\nwild right I don't know if you guys know\nthat but we can show that too this is a\nreally\nfascinating oh no sorry SSR anti\nalcohol\ndependence right so 93 cases of alcohol\ndependence following SSRI treatment\nreally interesting so quick PSA\nthere\num and this is what happens in ADHD so\neven the com the idea that no this is\nnot ADHD this is something that what if\nI have a complex of personal flaws that\nmap on to ADHD you all see how absurd\nthat is but this is the way that the\nMind thinks and why does the Mind think\nthis way because it was taught to think\nthat way because as a kid you may have\nasked or wondered I don't know what's\nwrong with me and no one actually took\nthat question seriously no one sat down\nand did did a differential diagnosis no\none stopped to think what could be wrong\nwith this kid and instead what we get\ntold\nis\neffort live up to your potential and we\nknow this there are studies that show\nyou know we go into a lot of detail in\nin Dr K's guide but we also have uh I\nthink like a YouTube video about um\nlet's\nsee you can go back\nto I think there's we have one about\nADHD and\ndepression okay that that's\ninteresting um that's so weird I guess\nmaybe this is promoted or\nsomething 90,000 views 5 years\nago 800,000 views two years\nago um it's so funny\nanyway so yeah so like this is what\nhappens so there's like this this\ncomplex that develops in the mind of\nsomeone who has ADHD where they think oh\nlike this isn't actually ADHD like\nthere's something like these are all my\npersonal flaws and I have to own them a\nlot because that's what you were taught\nyou were taught to blame yourself and\nchances are parents don't let you make\nexcuses right so they're like no you\ncan't make excuses this is your fault\nnow there are a lot of good parents out\nthere who do allow their children to\nmake excuses those are the kids that get\ndiagnosed those are the kids that don't\nwind up with depression right remember\nthat the comorbidity between ADHD and\ndepression is somewhere around\n30% right so still there's 70% of people\nout there who don't wind up with\ndepression and if you have some amount\nof luck some amount of genetics some\namount of like whatever the cognitive\nmechanisms\nare um then that that you know underly\nthe two if you dodge that bullet then\nyou're you're in good\nshape the last thing to\nconsider about this this like shame that\nof ADHD\nis experiences that are incredibly\nrelatable to other people with ADHD\nright so you've got like oh people say\nthey have ADHD and and I have it too\nlike I experience the same thing but I'm\nnot willing to diagnose myself with ADHD\nand you shouldn't diagnose yourself you\nshould go go get a clinical evaluation\nbut you know this is exactly what it\nlooks like this is the manifestation of\nthe\nshame I I don't I mean it's possible\nthat you have a collection of things\nthat perfectly overlap with ADHD relate\nto other people's experiences with\nADHD and you still don't accept that you\nhave it I think that's completely like\nnormal I I don't think it's correct but\nit's a very very common experience and\nit's because of the shame\ncomplex\nokay\nquestions before we move\non\num yeah\nso you know some people are saying\ntooking getting on ADHD meds took away\nmore than half of my depression almost\nimmediately so that's uh that can\nabsolutely happen so a lot of medic I\nmean medication for ADHD is incredibly\neffective and it is also doesn't work\ndoesn't is not a miracle for like a lot\nof people out there so for some people\nthey see instant benefits there's also\nEuphoria component to stimulant\nmedication which I think elevates\npeople's mood\num and and you someone else is saying\nshort acting focal in messes me up more\nthan than taking nothing yeah so like\nthat's like really common is that\nthere's a highly\nvariable effect especially for women so\nlet me see if I can find this\npaper\num\nuh right um so just to give you all like\na quick\nexample hold on I'm confused there we\ngo so just to give you all so this is a\nfemale side of pharmacotherapy for ADHD\na systematic\nreview several sex differences are\ndemonstrated in the prescription usage\nand efficacy effectiveness of both\nstimulant and non-stimulant ADHD\npharmacotherapy a single daily use of uh\nthis is probably methylphenidate um may\npossibly not be optimal for girls with\nADHD and adoxa tee may be a promising\nmedication for girls and women with ADHD\nso there's there's actually several\nstudies that show\nthat ADHD medication may not be quite as\neffective in women and the reason for\nthat is really simple or not the reason\na reason for that is really simple is I\nwant yall to think a little bit about\nhow ADHD drugs are developed so what is\nthe most what is the symptom or sign\nit's really a sign that correlates the\nmost with ADHD diagnosis is it it is\nhyperactivity and so what do we what do\nwe really look for what makes a parent\nor a teacher happy with a medicated\nchild it is the reduction of\nhyperactivity right so the kid [ __ ]\nsits in their seat the kid stays seated\nduring dinner the kid isn't running\naround all over the place thank God\nthey're finally medicated for their ADHD\nso when when you're when this is the\nmain sign that we're looking to treat\nand then we develop a stimulant\nmedication turns out stimulants are very\ngood at dealing with\nhyperactivity the problem is that\nhyperactivity is more common in boys\nthan in girls so the medication was\ndeveloped specifically for and not\nspecifically for hyperactivity but\nthat's a huge part of the efficacy of\nthe medication and it applies more to\nboys than girls so so the mileage for\ngirls varies quite a bit\nreally\nimportant\nokay\num all right so now we get to the fun\nactually I'm let's take a look at uh\nquestions any other\nquestions okay so what if I live in a\ncountry where it is almost impossible to\nget diagnosed with\nADHD I don't know man like so or or girl\nlike I I think so this is the challenge\nright so large parts of the world do not\nhave access to good mental health\ntreatment um part of the reason that we\nwe do the work that we do part of the\nreason that we even keep the prices the\nway that we keep them I don't know if\nyall are familiar with like you know\npricing on the internet and courses by\nHarvard trained whoever the [ __ ] but\nyou know part of what we're really proud\nof here at HG is that guides have been\npurchased I think in 121 countries and\nso we have people from like subsaharan\nAfrica and like you know southeast Asia\nand these places that that you know\nthere aren't a whole lot of resources so\nI'd say that the right move is always to\ntry to see a clinician as best as you\ncan right so if you've got if you're\nworried that you have a mental illness\nlike that's the right\nanswer at the same time that answer\nisn't available for everybody and so we\ntry to do what we can not to say that\nit's a substitute but there there is\nsome value to Psycho education learning\nabout things yourself the good news\nabout ADHD is that um basically like\nPsychotherapy and like organizational\ntraining techniques even executive\nfunctioning\ncoaching so there's lots of things that\nyou can do that are about as efficacious\nas\nmedication so people with ADHD will\ncompensate and people who are good at\ncompensating can essentially leave nor\nlead normal lives presuming their ADHD\nis not very\nsevere right and then like it it's super\nsad but that's you know the right answer\nis do the best that you can to get some\nclinical support and just because\nthere's an absence of clinical support\ndoesn't mean that you can't get some\nimprovement through non-clinical means I\nwould say that the the physiologic\nanalogy to this is let's say someone has\nType 2 diabetes and I don't have any\nendocrinologists available just because\nI don't have endocrinologists available\nand endocrinologists are the gold\nstandard people that you should go to\nfor management of type 2 diabetes there\nare still things that you can do to\nimprove your type 2 diabetes that are\nnot the practice of medicine so as you\nexercise as you adjust your diet there\nare things that you can do to improve\nyour physical health there are things\nthat you can do to improve your mental\nhealth that don't necessarily involve\nPsychotherapy or\nmedication so avail yourself of those\nkinds of\nthings just procrastinate to compensate\nperfect let's move\non okay now we get to fun stuff\nchat all right undiagnosed or\nunmedicated unmanaged ADHD is saying\ntomorrow will be the day I'll finally\nget up do the stuff that needs to be\ndone and start living my life to its\nfullest and you unironically believe at\nevery time until you look up one day and\nrealize you're\n30 tomorrow is the day I'll put my life\ntogether sometimes I'm late because I\nsit like this for a long time so if we\nlook at this like what on Earth is going\non where we just sit there nothing is\nhappening we're not actually doing\nanything and we get super confused and\nthen we're saying to ourselves tomorrow\nwill be the day I'll finally get up and\ndo the stuff that needs to be\ndone so there are a couple of Concepts\nfrom ADHD that become incredibly\nimportant to understand why this happens\nso one is the way that the ADHD brain\nrelates to time and the second is the\nworking memory of the ADHD\nbrain so Russell Barkley is an expert in\nin ADHD\npathology and um he has this super cool\npaper and he has a great concept for\nADHD um let me find\nit\nyes hold on\nnot that paper here it\nis so Barkley's take on\nADHD is that there are can you guys see\nthis okay I'm gonna have to move it\naround a little bit is there some way\nto okay so Barkley's take on ADHD is\nthat there are certain core deficits\nwhich then result in like other\nDownstream\ndeficits so for\nexample um let me think about what's\nlike a good example of like a core\ndeficit resulting in a downstream\ndeficit so let's say\nlike um let's say I\nlag right let's say I'm I'm playing on\nPING so if I have a slow or crappy\ninternet connection that will lead to\nother Downstream deficit so that'll lead\nto me like losing games that'll lead to\nme like being able to do my homework\nmore slowly that'll lead to me like you\nknow having a scuffed download for\nwhatever lecture I need to watch in\nschool so like the problem of ping will\nalso lead to more disconnects and more\nlosses that way so if I play on PING I\nhave a lower rank in a video game but\ngenerally speaking we correlate rank\nwith in a video game with skill but I'm\nnot less skilled there is another factor\nthat is leading to a downstream\nconsequence and there are lots of\nDownstream consequences to having a\ncrappy internet\nconnection so in the same way in ADHD\nthere are a couple of fundamental\nproblems and then these fundamental\nproblems intersect with each other and\nthen create further problems and it's\nusually the stuff up here that we really\nsee so for example women with ADHD are\n60% have a 60% chance of being divorced\nI think that also is a weird I'm citing\nthis to statistic in a weird way so one\nstudy looked at male and female partners\nwith ADHD so man has ADHD what is the\nlikelihood of divorce woman has ADHD\nwhat is the likelihood of divorce and\nfor women are divorced 10% of their\nhusbands because of ADHD men will\ndivorce 60% of their wives because of\nsomething related to ADHD because is a\nstrong word it's not that causal but it\nit's it's a shocking\nstatistic so the point here is that if\nwe look at like the downstream outcome\nof divorce or single\nparenting there is an upstream there's\nsomething going on in the brain that\nresults in this Downstream\nconsequence okay and if you guys are\nskeptical and want to get into the the\nactual data we can do\nthat so uh this was a theory that I\nthink was\nreally propagated by\nBarkley and what he noticed is that\nthere are three basic things\ndisinhibited prepotent responses\nperseveration of ongoing responses and\npoor interference control and these\nresult in all kinds of problems and what\nwe're going to talk about today is poor\nnon-verbal\nmemory so basically in\nADHD inability to hold events in the\nmind unable to manipulate or act on the\nevents impaired imitation of complex\nsequences defective hindsight defective\nforethought poor anticipatory set set\nlimited self-awareness diminish sense of\ntime deficient nonverbal rule govern\nbehavior and delayed cross-temporal\norganization so this also results in\npoor okay we'll talk about verbal memory\nin a second so let's talk a little bit\nabout verbal and non-verbal memory\ndeficits in ADHD because this is\nsomething that is responsible for a lot\nof problems okay so we have something\ncalled\nnonverbal\nworking\nmemory and in ADHD this is impaired this\nis a huge huge huge debuff right so\nduring character creation when you're\ntrying to figure out what traits to get\nand what is worth a lot of points like\nyou know how you can take a negative\ntrait for like extra an extra eight\npoints to distribute some of the things\nas you all know if you play like a solid\nyou know computer RPG is that some of\nthe traits are worth it easy points that\nyou can pick up and other traits are\nlike crippling for your character a\nnon-verbal working memory deficit is one\nof the things that is crippling for your\ncharacter doesn't mean that things are\nhopeless right I'm laughing about it it\ncan be fixed it can be worked on Etc but\nlet's understand what non-verbal working\nmemory is so non-verbal working\nmemory is essentially our\nRam okay so we have like so a normal a\nneurotypical brain may have this much\nRAM so when I have a lot of ram I can do\na lot of different I can hold a lot in\nmy mind whereas someone with ADHD has\nthis much RAM so what this means is that\nif I want to for example like get an\napartment first I have\nto uh you know first thing I need to do\nis like fill out\napplications then I need to maybe do\nsome\nresearch I need to look at my\nfinances I need to Google search\nneighborhoods I need to think about\nfurniture I need to cancel my\nlease see there's lots of different\nsteps and in order for me to get an\napartment and move out of the house my\nbrain needs to be able to organize and\nhold hold all of these steps in my\nmind now the problem with ADHD is that I\nhave this much space and maybe a little\nbit of space for two so this results in\nall kinds of interesting things this is\nmy\nfavorite this results in this adhders\ntrying their best to not interrupt and\nlet you finish your sentence despite\ngrasping your point in the first few\nseconds so this is a hilarious meme\nwe'll talk about this meme in and of\nitself because there's some cool stuff\naround communication and relationships\nand ADHD but the reason that this meme\nis true is because when someone else\nspeaks this is their working\nmemory they have concept number 1 2 3 4\n5 6 7 the problem is with ADHD you cut\nthem off\nhere you can't pay attention to the rest\nof what they say there's no space for\nit and then if you wait till the end of\ntheir long ass di tribe then you forgot\nwhat they were going to say here you\nforgot this and then you're just left\nwith this one and then you stopped\npaying attention to these and you forgot\nwhat was going on over here so this is a\ndeficit of working\nmemory the other problem with working\nmemory is that it results in problems\nwith time so clinical implications of\nthe perception of time and attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder um is\nthis\n[Music]\nthe right so this is a a study that\nthat's looking at children who have\ndifficulties in time perception let's\nlook at\nthis so\nuh so practical approaches to time\nperception and SE valuation have shown\nthat individuals with ADHD have\ndifficulties in time estimation and\ndiscrimination activities as well as\nhaving the feeling that time is passing\nby without them being able to complete\ntasks accurately and well so if we look\nat\nlike a big problem that people with ADHD\nhave if we look at these two memes and\nwe're like what is going on here okay\nwhat we find is that a lot of this has\nto do with working memory and time\nperception and literally what you can do\nis you can do a study of kids with ADHD\nand here's an example of how time\nperception is\nscuffed so you can tell someone with\nADHD I want you to fold this paper\nairplane and then I want you to wait 15\nminutes and then I want you to fold a\nsecond paper airplane\nso people with\nADHD their ability to measure that 15\nminute minute increment is impaired so a\nneurotypical person has a sense of how\nmuch time\npasses and this is why people with ADHD\nhave so much difficulty with doing [ __ ]\nso I don't know if this makes sense to\ny'all but in order to do things you need\nto have a perception of time like your\nbrain needs to be able to calculate time\nright like you you need to like it's\nreally hard to do stuff if you are not\naware of the dimension of time I don't\nknow how else to say it like you think\nabout all the tasks that we do involve a\nTime Dimension like I have to study for\na test okay how many hours between now\nand the test how many hours does it take\nto sleep how many free hours do I have\nhow many hours do I have to game how\nmany hours does it take to study one\nchapter all of these things the\ndimension of time is messed\nup and so so if the dimension of time is\nmessed up this is what results in an\nexecutive function deficit so let's go\nback to Barkley's\npaper\nOkay so this results this diminished\nsense of time results in\nthis impaired execution of goal directed\nresponses diminished goal directed\npersistence behavioral inflexibility\nless task engagement following\ndisruption poor control of Behavioral uh\nby internally represented information\nsome of those things come from these\nother other things but like it's very\ndifficult like if you can't if you don't\nhave\nhindsight if you have defective\nhindsight if we look at this meme what\ndoes this mean this is defective\nhindsight right oh tomorrow will be the\nday that I do it tomorrow rolls around\nand then what do you say tomorrow you'll\nsay when tomorrow rolls around you'll\nsay tomorrow tomorrow will be the day\nand then tomorrow becomes today and then\nyou say tomorrow will be the day\ntomorrow will be the day tomorrow will\nbe the day tomorrow will be the day how\ncan you wake up and realize you're 30\none day what the [ __ ] it is because\nthere is a problem with the perception\nof\ntime and as long as there is a problem\nwith the perception of time all of the\nthings that relate to time like a b c d\ne FG diminished uh uh sorry persistent\nFocus follow through EX executing nine\nsteps to move out of your apartment if\nthe the dimension of time is messed up\nall of these things become\nimpaired this is what we've discovered\nnow part of the reason that we struggle\nwith this is because of our working\nmemory so working memory is the capacity\nfor our brain to hold stuff so like you\nguys know like when you play World of\nWarcraft or any other like loot based\nRPG we have\nbackpacks we have inventory space\nand the more inventory space you have\nthe more you can\nhold and youall know that the worst\nthing in an RPG is to have very little\ninventory space like if you've got six\nslots in your inventory it's [ __ ]\nannoying you can't do anything you're\nconstantly tping back to town to offload\nwhatever stuff because you can't be out\nthere in the world actually grinding\ntowards anything this is what a small\namount of working memory is like you can\nonly hold a very little amount of stuff\nin your head at a time\nso this is why people can actually do\nthings like persevera ofely Focus right\nso if we kind of go back to Barkley's\npaper we'll see\nthis right so if we kind of go over here\nthere's perseveration of ongoing\nresponses which means your mind stays\nfocused on one thing for a long period\nof time yeah that's because like when\nyou have very little Ram if there's one\nthing inside the ram that's okay the\ndeficit is not in holding one thing so\nif I'm playing a video game that's all\nI'm thinking about I'm not and the video\ngame operationalizes things for me I\ndon't need to think about what comes\nnext and what comes next and what comes\nnext see if I'm trying to study for a\ntest I have to think about when am I\ngoing to eat when am I going to go to\nthe library what's going to happen then\nhow long am I going to be there when am\nI going to meet up with my friends when\ndo I need to go pick up food for dinner\nyou have to think about all these things\nbut in a video game you don't think\nabout okay like what's going to happen\nsix hours after IQ for this game you\ndon't think about that because the game\ncreates a Time boundary for you and this\nis why people who have working memory\ndeficits have difficulties with time get\naddicted to video games because the game\ndoes it's like it's a bite-sized chunk\nthat your brain can\nhandle and this is exactly the problem\nright this is why we get addicted\nbecause then what happens is like I\ndon't think about the next hour I can't\nthink about the next hour I have time\nblindness so I don't think about the\nnext hour I have a deficit in hindsight\nso I forget about the previous hour and\nso8 hours go by eight years go by one\nday I wake up and I'm\n30 and I say tomorrow I'll do everything\nthat needs to be done part of this\nperception of time being messed up means\nthat when you say I'll do everything\nthat needs to be done there are studies\nthat show that once again kids with ADHD\nhave a poor perception of understanding\nhow long it takes to get something done\neven without ADHD for forget about the\nfact that you can't focus that's an an\nadditional layer right so it takes you\ntwice as long but is the capacity to\nestimate the amount of time it takes\nthat is\nimpaired now think about this if you\ncan't estimate properly how long\nsomething\ntakes what does that mean right so I\nwant yall to like let's use this analogy\nof money instead of\ntime so imagine I went to the grocery\nstore and I was blinded to all the\nprices you all been to these [ __ ]\nrestaurants\nthat they don't show the price on the\nmenu it's like what the [ __ ] you're like\nlooking at this menu there's a lot of\n[ __ ] on there everything's got truffle\noil and it's like what's the price like\nI don't know it's a surprise how much\nmoney do I need to spend on this meal no\none has a clue you'll find out at the\nend how long how much money you spent is\nsomething you'll figure out at the very\nend this is what it's like to live with\nADHD and time blindness it's like you're\nlooking at a men you have no [ __ ]\nidea how long everything takes okay what\ndo you need to do today I need to go to\nthe grocery store and I need to send one\nemail how long will that take I don't\nknow an hour and five minutes\nincorrect nothing's on the menu you\ndon't get to see the pricee takes 16\nhours you didn't even send the email you\njust got to the grocery store and you\nforgot something so you have to go back\ntomorrow this is what the experience of\nbeing with ADHD is like right we have\ndata to support this this isn't just me\nsaying oh like ADHD is like it's\nterrible like look at this [ __ ] this is\ncrazy dude right this is\nlike time perception in ADHD a\nmetaanalysis\nokay right so time perception has been\ncharacterized as the ability to predict\nanticipate and respond efficiently to\nupcoming information this is [ __ ]\nimpaired like think about this for a\nsecond\nokay right so temporal abilities\nEncompass perception of timing motor\ntiming in imagination of timing\nimagination of timing being able to\npredict how long something will\ntake\num so like for instance impulsivity is\ncorrelated with a reduction in tolerance\nto delays poor temporal foresight right\nlike I didn't think about the\nconsequences of opening up my phone and\nsteeper delay discounting oh this one's\ndevastating this one is like it'll be\neasier tomorrow\nokay so there there are a lot of studies\nof you know time perception in adult\nADHD\nlike\num and and there there by the way\nthere's some mixed data here okay so I\nthink this paper is from where is this\npaper this paper was published in 2022\nso in this meta analysis it's a point\nimportant to point this out actually I\nwant to show you all something from this\nwhereas some studies were able to\ndemonstrate a distinct deficit in time\nestimation that's the most consistent\nthing that we see in ADHD time\nreproduction and time management uh\nother studies were unable to demonstrate\na clear association between ADHD and\ntime estimation and time reproduction\ndeficits so that there's some aspects of\nof time temporal stuff that may be more\nor less impaired in ADHD right so it's\nnot like everything is you're not\nscrewed for\nlife now a lot of people are going to be\nasking okay what do I do about this\nso I think there's a couple of important\nthings the first is to let go of the\nshame right so instead of like thinking\nthat you're fundamentally busted\nrecognize that there is a\ndeficit and can you own that deficit\nabsolutely the good news is that there\nare compensations for deficits so if you\nlook at like um you know executive\nfunction coaching or you look at like\nCBT for ADHD\nor ADHD related\npsychotherapy what you find is first of\nall this is just as effective as\nmedications so generally speaking the\neffect size of psychotherapy modalities\nfor ADHD are as effective as\nmedication and what a lot of these\nmodalities are are building in tools\nthat compensate for your\ndeficits so using stuff as simple as a\ncalendar and timers so what you'll find\nis there are a lot of people in our\ncommunity who have ADHD who will use\nthings like Pomodoro Technique and all\nthis kind of stuff so the cool thing is\nthat you can use external\ntools and this is where people who\nstruggle with ADHD often times if they\nhave enough sufficient external\nstructure right so if you you have the\nright\nprompting then this kind of stuff\nbecomes less of a problem so the the\ncapacity for perseveration is only a\nproblem when the perseveration is not in\nthe right direction and generally\nspeaking the basic problem is that\nfrequently we can't control it but I've\nworked a lot with people who have ADHD\narguably have some kind of subclinical\nADHD\nmyself um ADHD runs in my family\nespecially on my mom's side so like and\nthe key thing is that if you can focus\nif you can create an external\nscaffolding for the mind then ADHD is\nless\nproblematic and this is literally what\nthese cognitive behavioral therapy\napproaches are to\nADHD there's also other kinds of things\nthat we can do so this is a consequence\nof not just the time blindness but\nthings like immature self-regulation or\nuh the ability to regulate our internal\nemotional state is poor right so poor\nself regulation of arousal in the\nservice of goal directed action I can't\nget myself to do\nanything so self-regulation of arousal\nthe ability to arouse yourself and move\ntowards goals is a motivational problem\nis a is an emotional problem in ADHD all\nof those things can be worked on so this\nis part of the reason that we do so much\naround alexiy and emotional regulation\nlike right in the fields which we've\ndone before here at\nHG so there's all kinds of stuff that\nyou can do it's not\nhopeless\num so basically like if yall are\nstruggling with time blindness and a\npoor working\nmemory what we know is that meditation\nprobably improves your non-verbal\nworking\nmemory we know that using tools like\ncalendars like and this is like Dr K\nsaying meditate use a calendar and use a\ntimer and like that's kind of the right\nanswer right there's more detail to it\nwe'll kind of look into that I'll think\nabout like if there are particular\ncognitive techniques that are very very\nhelpful but I think the first cognitive\nTech technique that's incredibly helpful\nis like noticing the shame and noticing\nthat many of the conclusions that you\nform so here's a really common thing\nthat I see is that someone looks at\ntheir life with ADHD and says my life is\nso hard things are so difficult and they\nlook at something like an alarm and a\nand a calendar and they say this is a\nsmall intervention there is no way that\na small intervention can make up for the\neyes of difficulty that I\nexperience but even that\nanalysis is filtered through a shameful\nmind this is filtered through a mind\nthat\namplifies because of the depressive\ncharacteristic of ADHD amplifies the\nsize of your problems because it feels\ninsurmountable right so if I'm sitting\nin a bathtub and I have a spoon and I'm\nlike holy [ __ ] there's so much water in\nthis bathtub and I'm spooning one spoon\nout at a time carrying it to the sink\nand pouring it into the sink and I think\noh my\nGod this is so much work and someone\ntells you hey I have this crazy idea\nthere is one thing you can do that'll\nmake the water drain on its own you just\nhave to unplug the drain in the bathtub\nitself you don't need to spoon it a\nthousand times this is what working with\nADHD is like well there are a couple\npeople who will figure out a couple of\nthings that really click for them and\nthen you start to see movement in the\npositive\ndirection so first of all be careful\nabout the conclusions that your mind\ncomes up with especially if your mind is\nnot in the healthiest of places so the\nmore behind you are the more things are\nworse for you the more likely shame and\ndepression are filtering your thoughts\nwhich which means that it will\nmisestimate the value of things that you\ncan do the other problem that I see a\nlot in ADHD is when you start to do a\ngood job at stuff your difficulty with\nhindsight and difficulty with foresight\nmean that you don't understand your\nbrain doesn't process that even a 5%\nImprovement every week will result in\nlike a complete Improvement in 20 weeks\nbut your brain can't see that because of\nthe time blindness so this is what I\nreally see in ADHD is that there's so\nmany things that handicap your ability\nto improve that are not the deficits\nthemselves they are the consequences of\nthe\ndeficits the deficiencies in hindsight\nmean that when you do something good you\nmay not notice\nit and we see this as well that you\ndon't learn from your mistakes right\nthat's what this whole meme is\nabout in ADHD you don't learn from your\nmistakes just sit there do nothing for a\nlittle while why don't you learn from\nyour mistakes it's not just that you\ndon't learn from your mistakes the real\ndevastating thing is that you don't\nlearn from your\nsuccesses that's the real devastating\nthing so even though you're doing things\nright and if you look at your life\nchances are you're doing some stuff\nright it's it's harder but you have\nactually probably a lot of wins in your\nhistory right this is what's devastating\nating is the the capacity for the mind\nto see and once again why is that\nbecause the ram is very small so you can\nonly look at one thing at a\ntime right this there's this is why the\nattention shifts so much because you\ncan't hold multiple things in your mind\nat the same time so you have to move\nfrom one thing to another and then if\nyou stop moving then you're only focused\non one thing it's deficit of non-verbal\nmemory now there's another really\ninteresting thing which we can talk\nabout\n[Music]\num okay so we'll talk about\nthis okay next thing that we're going to\ntalk\nabout is the mood\nmeter high energy and low energy and\nunpleasant and pleasant so when we're\nhigh energy and we're Pleasant let's\n[ __ ] go\nson and somewhere right before that that\nhigh is we're back yay we're feeling it\nI don't know exactly what this\nmeans and then we're vibing over here\nand then this is great when we're kind\nof neutral it is what it is and then we\nget to it's so over and this is so this\nis so beautiful mom would be sad right\nso the opposite the the worst place we\ncan be in\nADHD is people will be disappointed in\nus this is what really hurts this is the\nnature of our lowest of the low it is\nnot even disappointment in ourselves\nit is Disappointment in ourselves\nbecause we are disappointing to other\npeople now why does this\nhappen why are we like this so there are\na couple of different things to keep in\nmind\nokay the\nfirst is that in\nADHD are arousal levels we remember we\nhave a\ndeficit um\nright so we have a deficit in poor\nself-regulation of\narousal so this is the first thing so\nour ability to control this axis is poor\nso there are times where we\nare high\nenergy and low\nenergy and what we know from\nneurotypical people is their ability to\nget into the mood they're better at that\nthan people with\nADHD so there is an\narousal\ncontrol deficit it isn't that you become\nless or more aroused it's your ability\nto control the arousal that's a problem\nsecond thing that we\nsee is unpleasant and\npleasant right so let's talk about\naffect so the other thing that we know\nis that in ADHD we have affective\ndisregulation\nokay\num let's see if we can\nfind yeah so limited self-regulation of\naffect so what this means is that my\nability to\nregulate my emotional\nstate is\nimpaired so there's even people of\nhypothesize you know we have things like\nadd attention def disorder then we have\nADHD attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder and then we have\nADD which is attention deficit disorder\nemotional disregulation subtype so some\npeople have hypothesized that there's\neven a third type of of add where if you\nlook at our frontal loes so this is\nusually what's deficient in ADHD so we\nhave a a frontal lobe deficit and the\nfrontal loes are what\nregulate our negative emotional\ncircuitry so when our frontal loes are\ndeficient we cannot stop our brain from\nfeeling intense periods of anger sadness\nwe can't regulate our negative\nemotions\nokay so now what we have is we have an\narousal control deficit and we have an\nemotional regul a deficit which means\nthat while this is a\ngreat representation of what it's like\nthe problem is that we don't get to\ncontrol where we are right so we\nbasically it's like we're going to play\ndarts and we're going to play darts\nblindfold and on on any given day we may\nwind up in one of these squares so the\nability to take sustained action over\ntime becomes very\ndifficult right so poor self regul of\narousal in the service of gold directed\naction and this results in behavioral\ninflexibility we can't stop doing what\nwe're doing diminished goal directed\npersistence\nwhy because on today [ __ ] it we ball\ntomorrow we're\nvibing the next day it is what it is the\nnext day Mom would be sad and the next\nday let's [ __ ]\ngo and then the next day it's so over so\nthere's like our our productivity and\nmood is like a scatter\nplot now you guys may say okay Dr K does\nthis mean we're screwed no now we're\ngoing to give you all a cool\nanswer now we talk about poor verbal\nworking\nmemory so there's one really cool thing\nthat you can\ndo so people with ADHD have poor\nverbal working\nmemory what does this\nmean so let's look at poor verbal so\nreduce description and\nreflection poor\nself-questioning okay hold on let me do\nthis give me a second chat\nself-questioning also terrible\nhandwriting poor problem\nsolving okay\num even some of these things like\ndelayed moral reasoning I don't know\nwhat that means honestly but I'm going\nto write it\ndown okay you guys can't even this is\njust off I'm going to just write this\nagain this is just this is too much this\nis terrible chat what the [ __ ] okay\nreduced\ndescription and\nreflection\nokay um\npoor\nself\n[Music]\nquestioning and poor problem\nsolving now if you are looking at these\nproblems okay deficient rule schol\ngoverned behavior let's talk about\nthat so if you were looking at this and\nyou were saying okay this sounds\ncrippling this sounds like we're\nscrewed okay because we have all these\nproblems like oh my God I don't I can't\nproblem solve I can't question myself I\ncan't learn about myself iterate on\nmyself I\ncannot make a rule and follow\nit and there's even some weird delayed\nmoral reasoning I don't know what that\nmeans to be honest so you may look at\nthis and you say like okay hold on a\nsecond Dr K this means\nthat I can't make rules and follow them\nI can't question myself and therefore\nfigure out what's wrong and improve it\nmy ability a problem solve is impaired\nthis is what's really important to\nunderstand if you think you're screwed\nyou're not\nscrewed why because these are deficits\nof verbal working\nmemory you may say what is that what's\nthe significance of that that means that\nif you improve your verbal working\nmemory all of these things will improve\nthe problem with ADHD is we find that\nokay I make a rule for myself and I'm\nnot able to follow it I'm not able to\nlearn from my mistakes I'm not able to\neven understand what I'm feeling and I\ndon't know how to control my\nemotions there's something super cool\nabout\nthis which is that if we use our verbal\ncapacity all of these things can\nactually improve this makes no sense but\nyou it's true so I'll explain this okay\nso this is where we get to\ntrauma so what we know about trauma is\nwhen a human being forms a narrative\nwhen they are able to\narticulate something about their life\nwhatever capacity that is\nimproves okay so in\ntrauma we have this phenomenon called\nhemispheric lateralization which means\nthat the right Hemisphere and the left\nhemisphere don't talk to each other\nthey're not able to communicate so if\nyou ask someone who has ADHD has a\nhistory of trauma or is a Lex ayic what\nare you feeling how does that make you\nfeel they'll say I don't know bad or\nfrustrated stressed these are the only\nfour words that their brain has access\nto because the part of their brain the\nleft hemisphere that comes up with\nlanguage is not connected to the right\nhemisphere I mean it's not like the\nCorpus colossum is severed that doesn't\nthat has happened medically before but\nthat's not drama we're talking about is\nthere's decreased activity across the\nparts of these brains that talk to each\nother\nso I'm unable to articulate my emotions\nbecause literally the verbal center of\nmy brain doesn't have access to the\nemotional center of my brain what we\nknow from studies on trauma is that when\nI am able to articulate that\nemotion there is an increased\nconnectivity between these two parts of\nthe brain and in the struggle for\nfinding language my brain my left brain\nwill reach across and form connections\nwith my right brain the beautiful thing\nis the moment that happens that Highway\nhas been built and then it can be used\nfor other things like emotional\nregulation so awareness of what you are\nfeeling is the same as regulating what\nyou're feeling articulating what you're\nfeeling is the same as regulating what\nyou're\nfeeling this is why Psychotherapy is a\nmodality is so powerful a lot of people\nget confused and they say I don't\nunderstand what the point is how does\ntalking about my problems help it\ndoesn't actually fix my problems\nincorrect incorrect\nscientifically because what we know from\nstudies of trauma is that when you are\nable to articulate your problems it\nthere's other stuff going on in the\nbrain that has to happen before you can\narticulate your problem you have to\norganize the information you have to\nmanipulate the information you have to\nbe able to access the information which\nis\nsuppressed and once all of these things\nhappen stuff\nimproves and this is second example of\nthis is what we know is that when when\nsomeone articulates and makes narrative\nout of their trauma not only does the\ntrauma the negative impact of the trauma\ndiminish the trauma becomes a source of\ngrowth what doesn't kill makes you\nstronger so what is the difference\nbetween someone who is crippled with\nPTSD and someone who has post-traumatic\ngrowth the difference is literally the\nability to make narrative and narrative\ncannot be made without your verbal\nworking\nmemory and so in the process of trauma\nhealing what we do is we take someone\nwho is dissociating disconnected from\ntheir emotions I ask them what's been\ngoing on in your life and they say I\ndon't know I'm not even a real person I\nfeel like I'm a husk I've been existing\nI haven't been living this is the\nversion that they come in when they're\nin my this is the version that shows up\nin my office a year and a half later\nafter doing verbal working memory work\narticulating what their experiences is\narticulating what their emotions are\nthey start to form a narrative identity\nonce they have a narrative identity to\nbe they become a trauma Survivor then\nwhen they something bad happens in their\nlife when they get diagnosed with cancer\nthe trauma Survivor in them boosts\nthem we have tons of studies on\npost-traumatic growth and development of\nnarrative the key thing to understand is\nthat all of this relates to being able\nto put things into language Freud also\ndiscovered this Freud said something\nreally interesting which was that\nlanguage can s serve as a substitute for\nAction we kind of know this right\nbecause there people who talk really big\nand never [ __ ] do any because it's\none or the other those who can't do\nteach here I am\nwe sort of know this instinctively but\nwhat this means for you is that people\nwith ADHD feel\ncrippled that I cannot I make rules for\nmyself and I don't [ __ ] follow\nthem okay I cannot figure out what is\nwrong with me I don't even know what's\ngoing on with\nme if I you ask me to describe what my\nproblems are I don't even know where to\nstart everything is going wrong the\nthese are consequences I want you all to\nunderstand this that the brain does not\nknow how to articulate what is\nwrong the brain doesn't know how to\narticulate what I\nfeel and the cool thing about this is\nthat all we have to do to fix these\nproblems right including things like\nless task re-engagement following\ndisruption poor control of behavior by\ninternally represented information this\nis really important I want youall to\nthink about this poor control of\nbehavior by internally represented\ninformation let me ask youall something\nif you have\nADHD why do you do\nthis you will say I don't\nknow you cannot articulate it and this\nis the really wild thing that we've\nlearned about science is unless you can\narticulate what is going on inside you\nyou can't control\nit this is crazy it's absolutely crazy\nnaming a problem takes its power\naway understanding what it is takes its\npower away you cannot you cannot name\nsomething you cannot understand what's\ngoing on right so even if we look at the\nprocess of\ndiagnosis so if I ask you why did I lose\nthis game I played so well I don't\nunderstand what I could have done we\n[ __ ] see this [ __ ] all the time on\nthe internet and then someone who is\nlike way higher than you in rank is says\nthis is the problem this is the problem\nthis is the problem this is the problem\narticulation of a problem and Analysis\nof a problem go hand in hand improving\nyour verbal proficiency will improve all\nof these things because then your brain\nknows what's going on and like I\nmentioned in the trauma thing this is\nwhat's really wild that a lot of people\ndon't understand is that when you\narticulate something you are forming a\nconnection and willpower can take that\nhighway to it's not really how it works\nbut effectively it's kind of like\nthat so all you need to not all a major\nthing that people with ADHD do is they\nlook at\nthis and they're like how do I change\nthis\nBehavior how do I fix\nthis you don't fix this or you can fix\nthis sure you can take stimulant the\nother thing that you can do is\narticulate what is going on look at Bart\nwhat the [ __ ] is going on in here he has\nno idea there's a cartoon and you can\ntell he's got no clue it's such a great\nrepresentation so what we really need to\ndo is articulate articulate\narticulate the process of articulation\ninvolves so many different things going\non in the\nbrain and the more that we articulate\nthe better we will be so focusing on\nyour verbal working memory deficits can\nbe very important in ADHD and just name\nthings just name them and then you'll\nsay how do I do\nthat great question right so this is\nwhere try to use as many words as you\ncan so a great place to start as just\nthe feelings wheel so when you're\nsitting like this on a given day how\nmany emotions do you experience just\narticulate the emotions that you\nexperience really useful so we can start\nleveling up this working\nmemory and then like that we get to\nother questions like what makes this\nhard for you to do\ntoday what makes it hard for you to do\nright\nnow so as you ask yourself these\nquestions this kind of goes back\nto\nthis poor self- questioning and problem\nsolving I want youall to appreciate how\nthe there's a slash here problem solving\nand self-questioning go hand in\nhand so we here we are focusing on the\nproblem solving we're not focusing in on\nour inability to articulate and\narticulate what is going on or even our\ninability to ask ourselves\nquestions and this is why people are so\ncrippled because we're not we're trying\nto solve this Downstream thing instead\nof solving the Upstream cause and as you\nimprove\nnon-verbal memory working memory and\nverbal working memory things will get a\nlot a lot a lot better and what we see\nis this is what we do clinically\nright so we've sort of figured this out\non a clinical sense like what works is\ngetting people to articulate their\nproblems and something about\narticulation of the problem helps people\nsolve\nit and that's because when you\narticulate it your frontal loes have to\ndo some work in order to articulate it\nand then it's laid out for your frontal\nloes and it becomes easier to execute on\nokay let's take a look at some\nquestions then we have maybe time for\none\nmore um man these are so good questions\nokay maybe we'll just need do questions\nthe rest of the time all right hold\non\nuh through these practices I can cause\nneuroplasticity and cure myself of 8\nADHD so I don't know if ADHD can be\ncured so like I we're very hesitant with\nthat word in\nPsychiatry because what we know is that\nADHD is a neurodevelopmental disease\nwhich means that it is a consequence of\nthe way that our brain\ndevelops now there are a small number of\npeople probably somewhere at most 30%\nwho will quote unquote grow out of ADHD\nso since it is\nneurodevelopmental some some studies\nwill cite higher my guess is it's around\n30% that as your frontal lobes\nmature some of these deficits in frontal\nlobe problem because frontal lobe\nmaturity happens until you're about 30 I\nsuspect it's even later now because I\nthink we're changing the rate at which\nour brain\nmatures so until you're like 30 to\n32 like you can your brain will\nnaturally level up with relation to\nADHD there are a couple of challenges\nwith this the first is\nthat sometimes the\nconsequences of undertreated undiagnosed\nor untreated ADHD can impair us quite a\nbit so there's like growing up with\nundiagnosed ADHD that causes certain\npychological problems which then have to\nbe\nfixed so it's not just even if your\nbrain is mature some of the shame that\nyou live with you can't mature yourself\nout of the shame like the the growth of\nyour neurons in your frontal lobe\nneurons don't grow the pruning of your\nneurons in your frontal lobe and the\nstrengthening of your your frontal lobe\nin other parts of the brain that is a\nnatural\nbiological developmental process but the\npsychological trauma of growing up with\nADHD is not something that the frontal\nlobe just matures out of so often times\nthat needs to be addressed there are\nlots of practices that indu\nneuroplasticity things like meditation\nis a good example that's all very\nhelpful but I I would say the most\neffective thing that people do is a\ncombination of some neuroplasticity some\ncombination of healing the damage of\nADHD some combination of growing your\nbrain and this is the most important\nthing developing compensatory\nmechanisms so in the same way that we\nhave a prosthetic leg for someone who is\nmissing a leg we can develop a\nprosthetic\nbrain and that is what people with ADHD\nneed a prosthetic brain is a external\ninstrument that does some of the work\nfor our frontal\nloes great examples of a prosthetic\nbrain are a calendar an alarm so what\nare the deficits that we need need to\naddress we need to address time\nblindness right so one of the deficits\nso we need some kind of system to track\ntime so I'll even use like like I'll\neven track stuff in Excel as it relates\nto time I'm [ __ ] obsessed with time\nI'll show youall real\nquick so I do this myself I don't know\nif you guys can see this so this is just\nme keeping track of stuff like I know\nit's weird I know it doesn't make any\nsense we're not going to talk about what\nthis is but like I just this is like on\nApril 1st and then I track what I do in\nsome way this is on the [ __ ] the back\nof the door my office so I use external\ntools to function as a prosthetic brain\nand the three most important external\ntools are things around time blindness\nso keeping track of stuff using alarms\nand\ncalendars the second external tool that\nI would recommend that you all use I\nmean I did this a while ago but now I've\ndeveloped a compensatory mechanism I\ndon't need it quite as much is something\nlike a feelings\nwheel so when you're sitting there like\nthis give me a\nsecond like to look at a feelings wheel\nand then just ask yourself what am I\nfeeling right now you will be amazed at\nhow much you learn about\nyourself\nokay and then the third thing that you\ncan do that's really important as a\nprosthetic brain is manage your sensory\ninput so the brain has difficulty\noscillating your attention or holding\nyour attention where it needs to be and\nwhat is it that causes our attention to\nwaver sensory input we have this part of\nour brain called the thalamus which is\nbasically constantly\nintegrating input from our sensory\norgans and so what we what we really\nwant to do is be very careful about our\nsensory\ninput so as you control the environment\nthat you live in by reducing your\nnotifications this is all stuff that\npeople know even moving to a separate\narea to do a certain kind of\nwork right so like sometimes when I'm\nlike trying to do a certain kind of work\nlike I won't sit here I'll sit behind me\nI'll sit on that couch when I'm doing\nspecifically reading because if I try to\nread here I'll [ __ ] alt tab so it's a\nmess and so the more that you can build\nyourself a prosthetic brain the less of\nan impact ADHD will have and like CBT\nfor ADHD is like half of it is building\na prosthetic\nbrain it's like developing all these\ncompensatory mechanisms so that your\nbrain can function the way that it's\nsupposed\nto okay great question\num okay any hints as to whether you then\nactually have ADHD or just relating\nother than a diagnosis because I do\nrelate and have a massive\nprocrastination problem but it's not\nlike I'm trying and somehow failing I\nI'm I actually am extremely lazy in\nschool my intelligence brought me\nthrough but in uni my inability to study\nhas been detrimental to\nme okay so the other that we're seeing a\nlot is that everyone thinks that they've\ngot ADHD\nnowadays so why is this right why is\neveryone so if you look at I think the\nactual epid prevalence of ADHD I think\nit's under\n10% let me double check the statistics\nreal\nquick\num so let's see what the prevalence of\nepidemiology of ADHD\nlet's see so the prevalence of ADHD\nvaries from 2 to\n18% okay the prevalence in school-aged\nchildren is estimated to be between 9\nand\n15% in a met analysis of 175 studies the\nestimated pulled prevalence of ADHD was\n7.2%\nokay\nso 7% of people have ADHD\nif you look at the internet today it's\nlike 70% of people have ADHD\nwhy and you relate to this you have a\nmassive procrastination problem you call\nyourself extremely\nlazy why what's going on so I think\nthere are two things going\non the first is that I think we are\ncatching a lot more ADHD\ndiagnosis so we're seeing\nthat um a lot of people who were Miss\ndiagnosed or underdiagnosed we're now\ncatching them because there's greater\nawareness of ADHD so some of these\nstudies show a a prevalence of about 15%\nmaybe even\n20% second thing that's going\non is that so ADHD is a\nneurodevelopmental disorder which means\nthat it is something about the way that\nour brain\ndevelops now let's understand what\naffects brain\ndevelopment brain brain development is\n100% affected not to say that it is\nthat's the only thing that affects but\nwe absolutely know that brain\ndevelopment is affected by\nenvironment right so if you if a child\nis not exposed to Language by the age of\nfive if they're like like never no one\never talks to them like they may never\nlearn to\nspeak we have a lot of really\ninteresting stuff that came out of these\nRomanian orphanage\nstudies so we know that the brain\nrequires exposure for development\nnow what are we what's what's happening\nto the exposure of\nour our kids nowadays what are we doing\nto our brains H you guys\nknow let me find\nthis right so like this is this is like\nsuper\ncreepy but let's take a look at this I\ndon't know if you guys saw this video\nthis scared me so\nmuch right this is like and it's got\ncreepy music I guess I don't know if\nwe we need the music that's kind of\natrocious right so this kid is like\nscroll is like nightmare\nscrolling so what we're seeing is that\nwe're exposed to technology at a far\nyounger age and in a very high\ndose and I think there's like pretty\ngood data that suggests that exposure to\ntechnology really messes with our\nfrontal loes and our attention span but\nmay also mess with some of these other\nthings that we're talking about like\nnon-verbal working memory and working\nmemory and the reason that it really\nmesses with our attention span is when\nwe use a\ndevice the people who make the stuff on\nthe device are working very hard to keep\nour\nattention they're doing all the lifting\nwith bright even if we look at that Tik\nTok someone added some creepy music to\nmake it more engaging the more\nengaging the internet\nbecomes the less engaged our brain\nis so if the whole world started using\npersonal drones to fly around and we\neliminated stairs and walkways and we\njust flew everywhere carried if we took\nelevators instead the stairs every time\nwe went anywhere we would become\nphysically deconditioned and what we're\nseeing in society today is a mental\ndecondition a neurological\ndeconditioning and so part of I think\nwhat we're seeing is that it's not\nnecessarily that everyone has this\ndiagnosis of\nADHD but we're seeing that people's\nbrains are being affected by technology\nand they're moving in the ADHD\nDirection so we see less emotional\nregulation right we have all these\npeople nerd raging on the Internet or\nX right like people just yelling at each\nother all the time like the the internet\nis like just it's like a bunch of people\njust emotionally vomiting into a\nswimming pool and if you go on the\ninternet you're just swimming around and\njust a pile of vomit this emotional\nvomit where people are trolling each\nother ignoring each other saying all\nkinds of hateful things and this all\nfloats to the top even the stuff that\nyou disagree with floats to the top and\nyou engage with it because it makes you\nangry so this is what's going on on the\ninternet so we see emotional dis\nderegulation we see a lack of attention\nwe also see negative impacts on the\nperception of\ntime and all of these things are\nconsistent with\nADHD so I really think that our society\nlike our our technological input is\nmaking our brains closer to ADHD it's\nit's affecting our brain\ndevelopment I see this a lot like it's\nscary what's going on in schools where\nlike teachers are complaining more and\nmore and more that kids are becoming\nmore and more incapable of anything\nthere's a lot of learned helplessness an\ninability to operationalize problems so\nlike when a kid has a problem they like\ndon't know how to fix\nit like there's a there's a basic decay\nin like kids being able to fix their own\nproblems like cell phone usage is a huge\nhuge huge problem in schools right now\nit's a\nmess that combined with like a lack of\nlike\nproper\nreinforcement or like we don't\napparently like kids don't get punished\nanymore so like you know there's no\nthere's no consequences for actions so\nthen there's all kinds of\nproblems in\nschool so this is what's going on with\nADHD I don't I I mean so some of it were\ndiagnosing more the other really\ninteresting thing is that there are some\nstudies that show\nthat advanced parental age correlates\nwith the degree of neurodiversity and\nthe really interesting thing is that\nthere are some studies that show that\neven paternal age matters so most of the\ntime when we're looking at\nlike impacts on the fetus and the child\nit appears\nthat the age of the mother is very\nimportant but specifically when it comes\nto studies of things like autism\nspectrum and neurodiversity the paternal\nage appears to have an influence as well\nso we don't know exactly what's going on\nthere so people are having kids later\nthis all results in a greater appearance\nof\nADHD now the last thing is people say oh\nlike I don't know if I actually have\nADHD or I'm extremely lazy I'm actually\nlazy so I want to ask\ny'all what is laziness\nwhat is\nlaziness see we use this term\nlazy\num and like we're not sure what we mean\nby\nit right so like in the brain where does\nlaziness come from and people think that\nlaziness is a lack of willpower but I'm\ngoing to show y'all\nit's really cool that someone mentioned\nthis because we've got some really\ninteresting research about\nthis\nso would\ny'all argue that behavioral\ninflexibility insensitivity to response\nfeedback diminished goal directed\npersistence do you all think maybe this\nis what laziness\nis um limited ability to regulate your\nemotions\ndiminish self-regulation of\nmotivation poor self-regulation of\narousal in the service of goal directed\naction does that sound like ra laziness\nto y'all kind of sounds like laziness to\nme and then let's look at this one oh\ndid I get rid of it yes oh beautiful\nthis thank God I have this paper so\npulled up a moderated mediation analysis\nof\nconscientiousness time management\nstrategies effort regulation strategies\nand University students students\nperformance so there's a lot of interest\nin five Factor personality analysis and\none of the five factors in the big five\nis conscientiousness which is the\nability to work hard towards a goal\nwithout gratification and everyone\nthinks oh my God if you have high\nconscientiousness you have won the game\nof life because this means you're not\nlazy but this is a really cool study\nthat shows that\nconscientiousness in an of itself does\nnot determine whether you are successful\nor not that conscientious the effect of\nconscientiousness is mediated by time\nmanagement strategies and effort\nregulation strategies\nokay\num so results of both studies indicate\nthat the effect of conscientiousness on\nacademic performance so it is not just\nthat the more conscientious you are the\nbetter you are at academic performance\nis mediated by using effort regulation\nstrategies and time management\nstrategies see when you're very very\nfocused on climbing to the top of the\nladder and you play 15 hours of video\ngames a day and you're\ngrinding people wonder why can't I grind\nin real life the way that I do in video\ngames so this could be that you're\nactually highly\nconscientious the problem is that your\nconscientiousness is mediated by certain\nskills and strategies like time\nmanagement strategies and effort\nregulation strategies so when you lack\nthese strategies you can't perform\nacademically but the conscientiousness\ncan come out in in the in the uh topic\nof video games Rel relating to video\ngames and the reason for that is because\nthe video games do these two things for\nyou right they make it easy for you to\nregulate your effort by giving you small\nrewards along the way and they make it\neasy for you to manage your time by\nhelping you forget that you have\nanything else to do and then you queue\nup for a thing and then you you get into\na match and then you leave and then you\njump back into the queue so time\nmanagement and effort regulation go out\nthe\nwindow okay do executive dysfunction\ndelay aversion and time perception\ndeficit um predict ADHD symptoms and\nearly academic performance in\npreschoolers delay aversion oh I'm lazy\nI can't delay my\ngratification I'll do it tomorrow I'm\nlazy I\nprocrastinate do you all understand that\nprocrastination requires the dimension\nof\ntime because we know that perception of\ntime is impaired in\nADHD see\nlazy is the lazy person's word for the\nconcept of laziness\nthere is no lazy center of the\nbrain and willpower or an absence of\nwill power does not explain\nlaziness laziness is\na umbrella term that describes all kinds\nof neuroscientific mechanisms and we\ndon't know what those mechanisms are so\nwe call it\nlaziness so if I suck at a video game\nand then people say what you know tell\nme about your gaming you say I suck at\ngames that is not that is a lazy way of\ndescribing it right so what does sucking\nat games mean does this mean that my\naccuracy is bad does it mean that my\nstrategic thinking is bad what does it\nmean so laziness is not a thing a thing\nit is actually a thousand different\nthings and since we don't know what\nthose things are we call ourselves\nlazy procrastination and laziness is a\ncombination of time blindness\nan inability to control your\narousal an inability to uh regulate your\nemotions because when I'm lazy I don't\nfeel like doing something what does that\nmean feel like what is the\nneuroscientific mechanism of feel\nlike there's an emotional\ncomponent right and here we see\nit so if we go to this thing this is\ngreat\ngo to this\none see when you can regulate your\nemotions you can move from any one of\nthese squares to any of these other\nsquares when you can regulate your\narousal you can move from any of these\nsquares to any of these other squares\nyou can go from here to here every\nsingle day if you know how to regulate\nyour emotions and regulate your\narousal that's it\nhi your\nturn okay let me wrap up give me like\nfive\nminutes regular five minutes\nokay so people will say like oh I'm\nlazy so learn these\nthings right so how do you regulate your\narousal how do you regulate\nyour emotions like we have a ton of\ndifferent stuff on that like we have all\nkinds of stuff but what I what I want to\nknow like what I'm like trying to signal\nto you all is that a lot of what we\nperceive as\nproblematic is like an imprecise\nunderstanding of what the actual problem\nis and once you able to correctly\ndiagnose the problem then you can treat\nit right good diagnosis preds good\ntreatment and the biggest problem that I\nsee in ADHD right now is that we don't\nunderstand what we're actually dealing\nwith with even clinicians don't\nunderstand the depth of what goes on in\nthe brain with someone with\nADHD right so I don't think I read a\nsingle Russell Barkley paper when I was\nin residency maybe they were assigned\nand I just chose not to read them but I\nthink like this this very deep way of\nthinking because most of our like mental\nhealth training is really focused on\nlike diagnosis and treatment at a very\nsurface\nlevel right there's a lot of clinical\nlike how do you adjust your medication\ndose and there's a lot of good stuff\nlike it's all important stuff to learn\nI'm not saying there's it's not useful\nbut there's so much depth to\nthis and the sad thing is that as a\nclinician you can't understand all this\nstuff there's just way too much I mean\nlike you know I have the luxury of\nreading 400 papers and building a trauma\nmodule that's why I understand trauma\nthe way that I do in addition to\nclinical experience and good training\nand had some great train like great\nmentors but like the average clinician\ndoesn't have the time for\nthis right they just like don't have\nthat like I I have you know I I read\npapers for 10 or 12 hours a day and like\nI'm lucky like I can do that it's part\nof my\njob so if yall are struggling with\nADHD\num you know it can feel like you're lazy\nit can feel like you're procrastinated\ncan feel like oh my god do I have ADHD\nor do I not have ADHD everyone says they\nhave ADHD chances are I don't know if\nyou have it or you don't have it that's\nwhy you should go see a\nclinician but here are the two things\nthat I would say whether you have it or\nyou don't have it if you notice these\ndeficits there are things that you can\ndo to correct them that's the important\nthing from our perspective from the\nscope of our relationship and the work\nthat we are doing here it is not to\ndiagnose you and treat you with\nsomething it is to recognize that these\nmechanisms are at play in these\nparticular diagnoses and they have\ncertain antidotes and whether you have\nthe diagnosis or not whether you are\nblind to the perception of time because\nyou have ADHD or you're blind to the\nperception of time because you're stuck\non a device and you wake up in the\nmiddle of the night and you go to the\nbed bed in the middle of the day\nwhatever the situation is understand the\nproblem and take control of it that's\nwhat we're here\nfor because the cool thing about all\nthis stuff is that it goes beyond\ndiagnosis and\ntreatment there's so much you can learn\nabout yourself that goes beyond\ndiagnosis and treatment that goes beyond\ntaking a stimulant medication and\ngetting a\nlabel and so what we really want to do\nhere is Empower you to understand those\nthings this is not a replacement for\nmedical treatment it is not one or the\nother that's not why we're here\nliterally I'm a doctor and the reason I\nshowed up here is not to do the work of\na doctor it's to recognize when I had\npatients in my office there's so much\nstuff that they can do outside of the\noffice and this is what I saw in my\npatients two patients comeing with the\nsame diagnosis one person gets better\none person doesn't what's the difference\nthe clinical intervention is the same\nit's my dumbass either\nway what is the difference the\ndifference is what they do I see people\nin my office for one hour a\nweek they're asleep for 56 hours of the\nweek right the rest of the time 56 hours\nof the week they're asleep 1 hour they\nspend with me so 57 hours of the week is\nout the window there is a whole pile of\nother hours left to\nthem it's what they do in those hours\nthat really makes the big\ndifference so that's what we want to\nhelp yall optimize it's all the other\nhours of the\nday five minute is\nup okay let's call her back she says\nit's her turn I don't know if it's her\nturn for what\nlet us call\nher hey I'm I'm\nready\nokay she said she can't believe I'm\ncalling her my\nbad\nokay\nsure yeah put it on\nyeah it's big but it's\nfun Dr KB hyperfocusing on papers yeah\nI'm hyperfocusing on papers

like a\nfactory reset\nand see if we can find them I haven't\nseen any of that if we can it's the\neasiest correction in post I just like\nlooking at it and I mean the other thing\nis like the L on here was\nalready we're watching some behind the\nscenes from all um on the set of the\ntrauma\nguide this is intro take one maybe\ncommon\n[Music]\nwork so welcome to Dr K's guide to\ntrauma and so as we know experience is\nthe best teacher so the trauma is about\nto begin prepare to be\ntraumatized yeah that's a terrible so\nthis is going to be\n[ __ ] I remember hard this yeah okay can\nstart it's okay it's okay\nthere this is a guide about trauma and\nso the first question becomes what do we\nmean by the word\ntrauma unmute this now you're I know I\nknow I'm going I'm going but want to I'm\njust going to set up chat for you the\nway that you like it and then I'm going\nto go thank you\nokay um me just close out some of the\nstuff\nokay give me just okay\nthere don't touch anything just call me\nif you need something okay you have okay\nyeah I have it do you have yours yes I\nhave mine but where's yours it's right\nhere okay okay bye you need\nokay guys so I'm just here to answer\nquestions about the trauma module and\nanything else you might want to know\nabout healthy gamer um and if it's too\nquiet just let me know but I'm really\nhoping that this setup is working\nbecause I don't know how to fix anything\nall right any questions from\nanyone how do I stop being lazy I\nbelieve I overheard that lazy is the\nlazy person\nword for being lazy I probably got that\nwrong guide to makeup right um his skin\nlooks really good in this we took a lot\nof care of his skin because so what\nhappens is up until the guide ol is very\nparticular about his like eat sleep\nhydration cination during these shoots\nbecause he is filming like he is talking\nto a camera like blah blah blah blah\nblah blah blah for like 10 hours eight\nhours a day and he's got a like I think\nbig Cal told us there are production\ncompany that work with us on producing\nthe guides they told us that essentially\nthey get like four feature films worth\nof footage for one guide so one guide\nhas four movies worth of film um and\nit's just him mon logging so we do a lot\nto take care of his voice we do a lot to\ntake care of um his\nskin um because it's stressful so every\nonce in a while there'll be a breakout\nwe take a lot of care of like his diet\num he sleeps in a very particular way\nit's a\nwhole thing like and it's for weeks\nright so\nbefore we shoot about three weeks before\nwe start shooting we're sitting down\nwith big cow and we are doing um a\nscript review so we're going through and\nwe're cutting because every mental\nHealth Concepts like they're all related\nso and the way that the guides are is\nlike one thing goes into the next it\ngoes into the next and so when you're\nsequencing everything out\num it's hard to not be like oh and we're\ngoing to learn more about that later or\nyou preview a topic and then you have to\ncut it and anyway there's just a lot of\ngoing through the script before so this\nprocess starts 3 weeks before he sits in\na camera but in front of a camera with\nthe production company and before that\nhe is writing the scripts and that takes\nfour weeks about and before that he's\ndoing the research read throughs and\nthat takes months and before that he's\nsketching things out to say like well it\nshould be this topic then this topic and\nthis topic and this topic um and before\nthat he is doing the research pools and\nthat's where he's saying hey um Jake's\nour research manager he'll say Hey Jake\npull me everything you know about PTSD\npull me all the most recent stuff about\num complex PTSD pull me everything we\nknow about post-traumatic growth and so\nhe'll do these different pools and as\nhe's going through the research there\nwill be different concepts that are\npopping up and then there will be a\nsecondary or\ntertiary sometimes five rounds of\nresearch pools where he's editing like\nokay this concept was in this paper but\nthis is outdated cross that out New\nConcept more updated info so it's um\nabout two years in the making um with\nlike literally everything we know about\ntrauma and when I say we I mean like the\nscientific Community because we are\npouring through mountains of research um\nand it's really cool and then\nmeanwhile um at meanwhile so he Alo is\nshooting all of the\nvideos and then the team our development\nteam and our product team is going\nthrough and saying okay what of this\nneeds a worksheet what of this could use\num a glossery definition how do we want\nto design these worksheets how do we\nmake this concept um a little easier to\nunderstand or a little bit more visual\nso there's a lot of really amazing\ngraphic work um that the team has put\ntogether and then on top of that we've\nhad so much feedback about the guide\ninterface\num and that's a whole monster because\nyou know it started off with three\nmodules and we were like okay if it\nworks on mobile great but if it doesn't\nlike most of us are on our PCS anyway\nbut that was during the pandemic and now\nhere we are and it has to be mobile\ncompatible and all this stuff so it's a\nlot of work are we paying Jake enough\nhonestly probably not um and that's\nsomething that I really want to work on\na lot of our team comes in very Mission\ndriven and we really want to be able to\ngrow people here um meaning we want\npeople to have a career with healthy\ngamer and that's why you're going to see\num you know some of the price increases\nand stuff like that and we started\noff wanting to make this like super\nsuper super affordable for everyone and\nas inflation has inflated\num as people have been with us for a\nwhile you know we're really\nsaying let's pay people what they would\nmake somewhere else they deserve it\nthey're putting in that much work here\nso that's why you're seeing some of the\nprice increases the way you are and I\njust want you to know that it it really\ngoes into building a team there are\nabout 200 people on the healthy gamer\nteam at this point including mods\ncoaches editors\nstaff it's a big it's a big shift to\nsteer at this\npoint can mental health workers\nreference your work and their sessions\nwith clients yeah sure please do we\nactually um just stood up the HG\nInstitute which has accredited trainings\nfor mental health clinicians so if you\nwant um more clinical language or more\nclinical data in some of your clinical\nwork um you can get credit for that at\nthe HG\nInstitute fix my lipstick\num what positions are you hiring for\nright now if any we are hiring um as we\nstand up the Institute we are currently\nrecruiting and going through the process\nfor our coaching\noperations we are um you know what we're\nlooking for more designers to contribute\nto all things growing the brand because\none designer if you're a designer you\nknow um one person who's great at Brand\ndesign isn't necessarily going to be the\nbest illustrator and they're not going\nto necessarily be the best animator and\nif you're an amazing animator you're not\nnecessarily the best video editor the\nvideo graphic Motion Graphics artist so\nif you're a designer and you want to\ncontribute um send us an email at teamat\nhealthy gamer and we'd love to you know\nwork with you guys and I think that's\nhonestly one of the most gratifying\nParts about this whole thing\nis being able to work with the community\nSource a lot of talent from this\ncommunity and that get it Factor plus so\nmuch talent and so\nmuch I think intrinsic motivation to do\nthe right thing for the healthy gamer\nCommunity is what makes this team so so\nspecial I appreciate that it takes a ton\nof work but it still feel feels weird to\nme that the guides are commercial\nproducts I don't know maybe I'm just a\nfreak I don't think you're a freak\num here's my take on\nit one is if healthy gamer was a\nnonprofit We would be up here constantly\nasking for your donations and we\nwouldn't be able to put our heads down\nand do the work and I know this because\nI used to run digital strategy\nat a marketing agency for nonprofits and\nI saw very like on the p&l I saw all of\nthis money that they could have been\nspending on programmatic work they're\nspending on fundraising and it's super\ninefficient so I didn't like that\nmodel\num it could be free which is why we put\nout so much free content at such high\nquality and you'll see allo explain\nthings Soup To Nuts\num on a given topic for free the guides\nhave a lot of work there's a lot of\nexpense for those guides and I guess we\ncould get them\nsponsored um but I don't like that\neither because then we'd be promoting\nsome commercial interest and you know\nwe've had conversations with different\npeople who want to sponsor things and\nlike the whole mission and the rationale\ngets completely wor\nso the answer we landed at is price them\nas affordably as we possibly can that\nenables us to keep\ngrowing but make it affordable so that's\nwhat we\ndid uh any other what are your plans for\nthe summer meaning the teams as a whole\nany project so mental health May is\nlike Christmas plus I don't know Fourth\nof July plus like Memorial Day all\ntogether I guess Memorial Day is in May\nbut it's like every holiday together in\none um so after May the whole team is\nencouraged to go ahead and take their\ntime in June or July um we'll be\ntraveling ol really wants to go on like\na fairy tale kind of vacation with our\ngirls so we want to go to like castles\nand lakes and rivers and all that stuff\nso we're thinking about a vacation to\nlike Central\nEurope and um we just got a pretty cool\ninvite to hang out with some YouTubers\nat the White House of all places and\nI've been invited to speak at a couple\nevents\nand also in Washington um so I'm really\nexcited to be able to like contribute\nmore on Mental Health\npolicy so that's really exciting and\nwhat else for this\nsummer this summer we're taking it easy\nwith the kids last summer we did a lot\nof summer camps and things like that and\nour kids are like can we just be home\nand I'm really excited to kind of just\nhang out with them I feel like we get\nsuch little quality time with kids these\ndays because you know they get home and\nif they have extracurriculars and when\nyou get off of work it's like 6 6:30 and\nthen it's bed time dinner time or dinner\ntime bath time bedtime so I want to like\nactually hang out with\nthem thank you T toile um I don't know\nif I'm saying that right but I agree I\nthink there is a universe where someone\nlike Al with someone who has the\nknowledge base that he does would be\nselling this for 10 to 20 times to 50\ntimes as expensive I as we do and it's\nreally important I would rather 10 to 20\nto 50 to 100 times people get access to\nwhat we do so that's why we price the\nway we\ndo the guide right now if you have pre\nokay I might get this wrong but please\ncheck it's on the healthy gamer. site um\nif you have purchased all modules before\nand when you purchase them they $20 a\npop you the trauma guide is available to\nyou for\n$20 um if you purchase them when they\nwere 25 they're available for 25 during\npre-sale and then on the 20th it'll go\nup to $30 so it's still $30 it's not you\nknow it's the price of I guess like a\nreally nice entree at a nice\nrestaurant no it's not too $100\nno uh is there any discount on the\nguides for people on the AOE\ntier I don't think there's an additional\ndiscount on top of the pre-sale but I\nthink for members we are making um some\nof the resources from the guide\navailable but I don't quote me on that I\nthink we're still trying to figure it\nout\nare there going to be guides for dating\nrelationships and social skills this is\nsuch a good question ol and I argue\nabout this all the time\num because it's dating slash\nrelationships slash social skills the\nscope on a guide like that keeps getting\nbigger and\nbigger and\nto me this is this is my point of view I\nwant a guide on addictions before a\nguide on social skills and here's why I\nsee Dr K's guide as a way to get\nclinical level education out there so on\nactual mental health conditions\ndisorders diagnosis because we don't do\nthat in coaching but that is where\nthere's such a huge need so to me the\nguides are\nclinical and contain like capital m\ncapital H mental health\neducation whereas our coaching\ncomplements that with all of the way\nforward now that you know all this stuff\nwhat do you do with it um how do you\nimplement it and the best outcomes I see\nacross everything healthy Gamer does is\non dating relationships and social\nskills in coaching so\ngroups in particular um we've priced\nthem to be super super affordable so\nthat way you have a place to practice\nbecause here's the thing with dating\nrelationships and social skills you can\nhave all the theory in the\nworld but when it comes down to like in\nthe moment what you say how you react\ncan you pause can you depersonalize can\nyou do all that stuff um group is a\ngreat place to grow that\nis there an OCD\nguide no not to my knowledge I think we\ntouch on OCD in the guides but there's\nnot a specific guide on OCD if that's an\ninteresting topic to you guys one thing\nthat we're doing\nis\num we're starting to collaborate we're\nstarting to plan how to collaborate with\nother mental health professionals\nbecause I think I mean obviously I think\nAl is brilliant\num there are\nother there are other professions and\nother professionals that we've met that\nare amazing at things like skills\nbuilding or have a real expertise in\nchildhood trauma for example or\nchildhood um like if you start an\naddiction or a substance use um as a\nchild as opposed to as an adult that\nkind of looks a little different so\npeople that specialize in that so let's\nsay you start experimenting with\nmarijuana in at the age of around 14 or\n15 right that it looks different for\ndifferent people so having Specialists\nand that are specialists in um so we're\ntalking to somebody who has a specialist\nin addiction someone who has actually\nrun\nrehabs um someone who these are\ndifferent people a lot of them are on\nour Advisory board if you want to check\nthem out um on the\nwebsite and it's just cool to bring in\nother perspectives so if you guys have\nquestions on Mental Health topics that\nwe haven't really talked about much um\nat healthy gamer I would love to know\nwhat those are um feel free to drop\nthose suggestions in our subreddit or\nthe Discord and we'll see who we can\nsource\nI am not a clinician I am a Healthcare\nManagement MBA so I run all of the\noperations at healthy gamer all of\nThe Not So Glamorous stuff all\nthe thorny problems and growing pains\num it's a really fun company but it is\nit's a lot um normally this is when I've\nspent my whole career in startups so\nyou know year five is usually when the\ncompany is growing up and that is a\nharder\nstage yeah I'm technically alak's\nboss uh no I did not get my MBA online I\ngot it um in person at Boston\nUniversity how can we best support and\npromote\nHG you know that's so personal\num I love it when people kind of take\nwhat they've learned and keep growing um\nI don't necessarily feel the need that\neverybody should be posting about us or\num donating like we're here to give\npeople what they need the way that they\nneed it so whatever feels right to you\nis what I would\nsay yeah ol has a performance review he\num we need to get into\nit we need to get into his performance\nuh I think he has done amazing in many\nmany areas and still some room to grow I\nwould say in a few and I think it's hard\nfor me to give him a performance review\nbecause I empathize so much um you know\nhe is a brilliant individual\ncontributor he's not a great manager and\nwhen you're the brains of the operation\nright um You have to be a good manager\nyou have to be able\nto delegate effectively communicate\neffectively give feedback effectively I\nthink Al is actually phenomenal at\nfeedback um he's gotten so much better\nat\ndocumenting and kind of clarifying what\npeople need he's terrible at managing\nhis own schedule so he often overcommits\nor needs people to chase him down which\nis really frustrating it was fine at the\nbeginning um but at this point it\nis you know a product team needs him a\nresearch team needs him the foundation\nteam needs him the executive team needs\nhim the marketing team needs him um and\nnow we're doing a few more\nsponsorships which go back and forth\nback and forth um the mods are like hey\nwhat do we do what are we doing so some\nof that just like coordinating um but\nI I'm really glad that he has\nprioritized where he has and he has\nprioritized being really good at the\nthings that he's really good at\neverything else um we can work\non okay don't mean to ask this in an\nunkind\nway but it feels like companies really\nlose their souls once the mbas get\ninvolved how do we know the drive for\nprofit won't undermine the mission of\nhealthy gamer okay thank you for asking\nthis thank you for um you know I think\nmaking an effort to ask it as politely\nas you can um I appreciate that because\non Reddit it's not always so nice\num I agree companies really do lose\ntheir souls once the MB get involved and\nthat's why I think we hire the way that\nwe do we really prioritize hiring from\nthis community and I've seen what\nhappens when we hire\nexternally um and I you know my my\ncareer path has been startups and then I\nworked for startup agency that\nspecialized in nonprofits and social\nEnterprises so I've also seen what\nhappens when you hire all heart and not\nthe\nskills so for us we always kind of do\nthis Vibe check this culture fit um the\nmost commercial aspects of healthy gamer\nthat you're going to see are coming from\nme\num I'm the only MBA technically um not\non purpose but more because you know we\ndon't have a bunch of we don't ha we\ndon't drive so much profit that we can\nhire a bunch of six figure like\nstrategists that's not what we're here\nto do um we have a lot of really great\ntalent we hire people that are\ncollaborative that are passionate that\nare really talented um and usually\nlooking for you know a place and an\nopportunity to\nshine sorry it's okay do I don't think\nso um\nyeah you can blame me for the ads that's\ntotally fine you can blame me for the\nsponsorships you can blame me for\nhealthy Gamers selling out um you can\nblame me\nfor bad like if you're not getting great\ncustomer service it's probably because I\nhaven't been able to fill the vacancy\nfast enough um but it's it's a big\noperation at this point\nand because we are bootstrapped because\nwe are ultimately a bunch of humans that\nare just doing the best we can um\nbecause we're very insistent that we\ndon't take a lot of outside capital or\nthat we're I mean you guys are my boss\nso you'll tell me if I'm doing a bad job\num but most everything we are aware of\nand we're working on\nit yeah you can also blame me for this\nchannel still\nexisting um all right\num well thank you guys for all of the\nnice comments um if there's any\nquestions about what we're building or\nwhere we're going I am cool with hanging\nout for a couple more\nminutes what did you think of the Dr\nMike interview\num it's\nfunny I thought it was a good\nconversation um it's funny because you\nknow he was part he was on his press\ntour for the book so he was there to\ntalk about the book and I think some of\nthe\num I think some of it was a little\nsurprising where it was like wait I'm\nhere to talk about you know screen time\nand Tech hygiene and mental health and\nTechnology why are we talking about um\nyou know why are we in a fight about\nayur I think was a little\num it was kind of a curveball but I I\nthought it was an interesting\nconversation Code Monkey can a coach\nhelp me find a girlfriend no a coach\ncannot help you find a girlfriend but if\nthere is a girl you're interested in and\nyou are trying to figure out an approach\nor making a relationship last or any of\nthat stuff\num coaching has been shown and measured\nand studied to be able to help with\nthat it's so funny because Alo um I\ndon't know if you've seen the trauma\nguide trailer but Alo really has a hard\ntime promoting things this is in the\nperformance review\num he went on Diary of a CEO he went\nwith Dr Mike he's been on the news he\nwas on NBC daily and I'm texting him I'm\nlike you've got to promote the book quit\njust answering questions you have to\nactually promote the book this is your\nbook tour I think he promoted the book\none time over the whole thing um Step\nBartlett with diova CEO was like in the\nbook you mention and all's like and by\nthe way like something completely\nunrelated um just because he's really\npassionate\nabout the topics he's not passionate\nabout promoting things yeah Mission\nfailed constantly so if you see me like\nsneaking ads in there it's probably\nbecause Alo didn't actually say like oh\nand by the way you can buy it now\num which is you know endearing and\nadorable and that's why we love him but\nalso come\non yeah Dr he's so bad at advertising\nhe'll like look at me and he'll be like\ndo I have to say this and\nthat's why I was like you know what fine\nI will say it it's\nokay yeah the man Cooks a lot and\ndoesn't promote\nanything um all\nright have you considered Financial\nHealth Combined with mental health good\nquestion we have considered it here's my\nthing\num I am really looking for people that\ncan do Financial Health without feeling\nscammy and I think there\nare there's two different tiers to this\nright I think part of our community is\nlike I've got my stuff together it's\ntaken me a while but I've got my stuff\ntogether now what do I do with my newly\nfound disposable income what do I do\nwith this and another part of our\ncommunity is like not there yet they're\nstill trying to figure out how to get to\nthat\nBaseline\num like you know just a place of like\nFinancial stability and so not\nknowing I think it's somewhat I I don't\nfeel good about going like super Finance\nbro on people who are still figuring it\nout and if you're already there I don't\nthink we're just I just don't think\nwe're the best place for that\nlmop that is a very nice sentiment to\ndonate to a rainy day fund um part of\nthe thing that we do so we have two ways\nof giving back one is we have a subsidy\nfund with healthy gamer and healthy\nGamer's subsidy fund will cover the cost\nof coaching for people who can't afford\nit um and what we'll do is we'll match\npeople with a coach who is trying to get\nhours as part of their\ncertification so that's kind of a um two\nbirds one stone approach where this\nperson wants coaching this person needs\npractice we can kind of subsidize that\nfor free and then another thing that we\ndo is with the foundation we are\nstarting to ramp that up we haven't been\nable to do as much with the foundation\nas like we want to I think that's part\nof just growing and being ambitious um\nbut the foundation will write uh what we\ncall Second Chance grants and those are\ngrants that um help offset the cost of\nwhat happens when you have mental health\nissues right because mental health isn't\njust oh I need my meds it's oh I can't\nfinish this semester at school or I've\nreally got get out of my parents house\nbecause this environment is debilitating\nfor me or I'm stuck in this job but I\nreally want to start my own thing but I\ncan't because of whatever reason\num so I\nthink kind of offsetting the cost of the\nimpacts of mental health is what the\nfoundation will write grants for so if\nyou want to\ndonate um to a rainy day fund I would\nsay the foundation's the best\nplace\num uh horoscopes any way any possibility\nof getting products FSA or HSA eligible\nI'm working on this uh part of this is I\nthink it's the national board of health\nand wellness coaching that is newly\nFSA eligible so we are working on\ngetting the healthy gamer coaching\ncurriculum accredited by Boards that can\nthen be eligible for um\nsome of these plans but it's a big like\nthe second you step into like those more\nregulated areas like your overhead costs\njust go through the roof so we're kind\nof stair stepping towards that but it's\na big it's a big thing to kind of bite\noff I think it would be amazing too um\nwe are working on it it is a long road\nand I don't want to promise you anything\nbut but we are working on\nit more family content is coming um I\nwanted to do something about people\nPleasers because I am a newly reformed\nor not that new I suppose but recently\nreformed people pleaser um and I see a\nlot of people kind\nof when you have kids and you're a\npeople pleaser that can be very uh that\ncan be a bad combo sometimes so I was\nthinking about a video on\nthat uh yes I have hijacked the stream\nfor a few minutes I just wanted to talk\nto you guys a little bit about what\nhappens behind the scenes and Alo\nis alive and well don't\nworry MBA and people pleasing is an\ninteresting combo you know it is very\ncommon um a lot of corporate grind\nculture comes from people that are\nambitious capable educated and people\npleasing and when you put them all\ntogether and ask them to compete that's\nwhen you get these toxic hustle work\nenvironments oh what was the question\nabout Regional\npricing it's probably can we do it um\nokay so Regional pricing is tricky for\nfor a few reasons one\nis on the coaching side we don't have\nlike apples to apples for like where the\nclient is the coaching is so for\ncoaching Regional pricing doesn't\nnecessarily work um we have coaches all\nover the world but um things are paired\nmore on goals and availability sometimes\nlanguage\nbut not always like the more\nsegmentations you do the more like\npermutation combinations there are and\nthe more complicated things get the\nharder it is to make a match so adding\nRegional pricing to that gets really\nwacky the other part is for the guides\num for the guides it's probably a simple\nplug-and-play Tech solution we haven't\nbeen able to prioritize that because\nwe're going through so many growing pain\naround having clients in 100 plus\ncountries\num the team has prioritized Spanish\nlanguage um translations for the guide\nso that should be available soon which\nis really like that's really exciting\nbut we're doing it one language kind of\nat a\ntime\num I'm looking forward to better AI\nenabled language Solutions but\neverything we've tried is like like like\nwhen the language is so Technical and\nthere are so many analogies and it's\nsprinkled with like gamer\nlanguage the AI translations just get\nwacko how has the book performed from\nyour\nPOV um you know I feel like if the book\nAlo wanted to write was about male\nmental health and I think that book\nwould have performed better\nthe book that Publishers wanted him to\nwrite was for their moms so I think it's\nperforming I know the impact is there\nand we're because we're Mission driven I\nthink it\nis it's the right thing to do I am not\num sometimes in publishing you want a\nbook\nto kind of make that bestseller list and\nthen once it's on the bestseller list\nyou can say it's a besteller and then\nonce you say it's a besteller then it\nwill stay a besteller and so there's\nthis like weird um engineered like just\nget it on the bestseller list and then\nit'll actually\nsell um which is I don't know I don't\nknow but this book I think will be\nrelevant for a really long time so\ninstead of like a quick Splash for it to\nhave stain power on an issue that will\ncontinue to be an issue\nunfortunately um for\nparents um trying to raise kids in this\nage I think it'll be relevant for a good\nlong time so we're in it kind of for the\nLong Haul more than like you know a\nquick quick Buck I\nguess\num is the coaching good for 14-year-old\nwith\nADHD good kid but very determined and\ndifficult for Mom to guide sometimes so\nwondering if coaching would be good\nhelpful PS love your mission and support\nthank you Bellis spy\num 14 is too young for our coaching\nprogram our coaches do have um\nsupplementary certifications to be ADHD\ninformed\nso a lot of coaches really can work on\nthose organ organization routine um\nalerts and reminder systems helping like\ncarve out good\num like Tech hygiene to be able to like\nfocus and things like that so our\ncoaches can work with ADHD\nfolks um of course it's not treatment\nfor ADHD but it can help somebody with\nwith ADHD like figure out a good routine\nand\nlifestyle\num but 14 I wouldn't say coaching we do\nhave parent coaching\nfor parents um that are trying to kind\nof figure it out and we know that it's\nreally tough right\nnow\num is Alo interested in making a cooking\nguy Olo is interested in all sorts of\nthings I think he's got some fiction\nbooks started I think he's\ngot he is like a Grill Master he is um\nmaking up all sorts of like kids stories\nfor our kids so he is very\nlike a million different projects\nstarted but um I don't know I don't know\na cooking guide would be a lot of\nwork um okay I see a lot of questions\nabout Teal Swan I don't really know who\nthat\nis I well wait no I have heard of\nher I don't know what you want me to\nanswer exactly about Teal\n[Music]\nSwan yes classic someone with ADHD with\na lot of like ideas and start stops\nhow much actual hell is Ol really doing\nhe seems like he has multiple lives yeah\nhe he's he's doing a lot um it's really\nfunny because I think if I was under\nthat much stress like the way I would\ncope with that stress would be pretty\nself-destructive I think but the way he\ncopes with this much stress is he's just\ngotten really into like a meditation\nroutine and really like prioritize going\nto the gym working with the trainer all\nthat kind of stuff so I'm really proud\nof how he's handled this much stress and\nlike public scrutiny on\nhim it's not easy sometimes I see the\nthings that people say about him and\nlike my heartbreaks for him and they're\nnot even talking about\nme but\nI don't know it really takes a lot to be\nable to handle that much public scrutiny\non\nyou gentrify we probably will be doing\nanother round of Coach recruiting later\nin the year the requirements and\nqualifications are you either hold a um\nindependent certification from a\ncoaching Institute like ICF or the nbhw\nUC or a different coaching Institute um\nand if you don't you can get um HG\nInstitute provides the certifications at\nno\ncost behind the scenes yeah so for the\ntrauma guide I think there are a couple\nof behind theen scen Clips on the\noriginal Three anxiety depression and\nmeditation um every episodes has behind\nthe scene um kind of\nouttake will Dr K be on any more\npodcasts I think we're going to take a\nlittle bit of a break over the next\ncouple of weeks um to kind of rest and\nrelax from mental health May and all of\nthe madness from it um and then there\nwill be a couple more collaborations\ncoming up later in the\nyear has there been any talks of a a\nretreat type of offering or even a\nconference where the community can get\ntogether we would love to do this when\nwe do it how we plan for it all of that\nis very complicated um we really do want\nto do this I can't see it happening this\nyear but I can see iten happening next\nyear what's the status on the of the\ndondor oven all right let me tell you\nwhat happened with the\ndondor um we we got the dondor and we\nmarinated a bunch of stuff and we made\nall of the like dough for the na and the\nflatbreads and then we started putting\neverything on the\nskewers and he would put it in the D\ndoor and everything just slid off so\nthere was just a bunch of burnt stuff at\nthe bottom of a tandor I don't know if\nyou've ever seen a tandor but it's like\na\ncylinder so it all just goes down and\nyou can't like reach down and get it\nbecause you'll burn your arm off so\nthere was that and then we made the naan\nand tried to what you're supposed to do\nis like stick it to the side of the oven\nso we'd Stick it and it would fall down\nand eventually all of the aunties just\ngot irritated and they were like let's\njust use the stove\nso that's what happened with the dondor\nand hate to say I told you so but I told\nyou\nso where can we keep track of all the\ncollaborations if you can find out you\ntell me I can barely keep track of all\nthe\ncollaborations um I think on the YouTube\npage there is a featuring Dr K section\nwhere kind of like the best of goes\nthere yeah tandor skills issues for sure\nhe's great at the\ngrill um and every year we throw a big\nholiday party and we usually do a bunch\nof stuff on the grill um which is all\nlook's all's happy place one one because\nI think it's good for his like\nintrovertness because he can just like\nhang out by the grill and talk to people\nkind of one at a time because there's\nthe way that the space is like they kind\nof have to be like either right beside\nhim or kind of behind him or like over\nthere so he can kind of just like call\nout to them every once in a while so I\nthink when we throw a big party his\nintrovert self is happiest at the grill\ntalking to people one at a\ntime which honestly is a great uh party\nhack if you're an introvert just be like\nI'll take care of the drinks and you\njust be the drink pour and you can talk\nto people one at a time um or like you\nknow I'll stock the whatever and you can\nkind of just hang out by the chips or\nthe I don't know whatever is going on at\nthe party you can like just be\nresponsible for one of the more High\nturnover food items and you can talk to\npeople one at a time that's my I can go\neither way where I'm introverted or EXT\ninted so when I'm more introver I'll\nlike play bartender or whatever\nelse um or I'll like take the coats or\nwhatever just to help more one-on-one\ninteractions does he pause your\nconversations to think our conversations\ncan be real painful because we'll just\nsit there stare at each other look up\nkind of craft the perfect sentence in\nour head and then we'll say it and other\nperson will be like\nhm well what did you mean by this and\nwe'll like clarify each other six or\nseven times it's uh our conversations\nare painful but we like are very\noneandone we don't have to talk about\nthe same thing over and over again which\nis really\nnice like it is full closure on whatever\nit is that we were talking about\ndoes Dr K ever get\nangry I think he runs out of patience um\nat the end of the day he can run he\ncan not have a lot of patience but he\ndoesn't get angry he's just kind of\nlike I don't have he'll just say I don't\nhave the patience for this right now\nlike it's the most like emotionally\naware um way to be angry I guess but\nit's not really\nanger it's not even frustrated it's like\nyou know you're trying to put the kids\nto bed they're jumping up and down and\njust kind of like girls I don't have the\npatience for this right now I'll be back\nin 10 minutes kind of and that kind of\nthing Christopher Dano what Pats would\nyou recommend for someone like me who\nstruggles with issues close to bringing\nme to the SW word but lost my job so\ndon't have the money to spend on good\nhelp I'm really sorry you're going\nthrough this um I'm not an expert in\nthis money should not be a\nbarrier\num actually Crow you're modding right\ncan you link\nthe what is it the full Mental Health\nResources cuz there's a bunch of um cuz\nthere's like a crisis line and I feel\nlike some people um hesitate on the\ncrisis line because it feels very last\nresort but honestly the crisis lines are\ngreat for helping navigate to Good\nresources thank\nyou wait there's the resource packs but\nisn't there the there it is thank you\nit's the explore.\nhealthygamer thank you\nall claims he isn't psych psychic or\nphysic um do you agree that sounds like\nsomething someone who psychic would\nsay no\ncomment Angelo is saying the crisis line\nis a great resource I agree\nwhat is my meditation practice um I am a\nwhat's called a thric so I I do more\num I do more like chanting and something\ncalled a yanthra which is something you\nkind of look at and meditate\non are these fake plants fun fact every\nplant that's ever been in here has\ndied um these are these are all fake\nthey used to all be real versions of\nlike a beautiful palm and orchids and\nVines They're All\nDead what happened to the DanTDM\ninterview um unfortunately we had we're\ntrying to reschedule it I think there\nwere some um last minute kind of Health\nEmergency there are windows but we keep\nthem closed um for this but also it's\nlike the front of the house so I don't\nknow it's very our neighborhood is very\num like we are very Suburban I don't\nknow if you guys have seen like\nDesperate Housewives or weeds or any of\nthose shows but it's very like all the\nneighbors know what you're doing and\nwe're the total weirdos because we're\nhome all day and I don't know like all\nof our neighbors are like accountants or\nit professionals are doctors and all\nthese like respectable professions and\nwe're just\nlike home all day all like screens and\niPads and everything\n[Music]\neverywhere yeah Deen house I think I\nthink some of the neighbors\ntalk how do you pick a meditation in the\nguide to\ndo so meditation in my my mind should\nnot be hard like it should be something\nthat makes you feel good and that is\neasy for you to kind of slip\ninto so I would give them a shot try a\ncouple of different practices and\nwhatever feels good to you do that one\nmeditation if meditation is like oh I\ncan't focus or I can't do\nthis I would start with something that\nhelps you get in the habit more than\nsomething that you think is like\nidealistic for I want to do that\none happy birthday IL\npresento all right well it was
