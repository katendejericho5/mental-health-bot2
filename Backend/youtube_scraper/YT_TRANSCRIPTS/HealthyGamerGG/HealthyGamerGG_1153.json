    "transcript": "okay how do i stop being this kind of\nperson what's up a vote\nyeah hold on let me think about this so\nhow do i stop being this kind of person\nwhenever i have something coming up\nlater in the day i can't relax until it\nhappens\neven if it's just meeting up with a\nfriend i hate how i\nam uh i have an appointment at 4 p.m so\ni can't do anything\nall day type of person let me just think\nabout how to answer this for a second\nso if you're the kind of person who has\nan appointment at 4pm\nand can't do anything all day\nthe challenge there or the weakness\nthere is that\nfor your mind to be relieved the event\nhas to be over\nright you can't detach from the event\nprior to it occurring so i want you all\nto like just think about this for a\nsecond\nso in the mind of this person who has an\nappointment at 4pm and can't do anything\nall day\nthey wake up in the morning and then\ntheir mind is like squeezed by that\nthought\ni have to do something at four i have to\ndo something at four i have to do\nsomething at four\nand then like what these people have\nlearned is that\nafter the four pm appointment then you\ndon't have anything at four and then the\nmind relaxes\nand so in order for your mind to have\nspace for other things it can't be\noccupied by one thing because\nyour mind can only have one thought in\nit at a time okay\nso like if your mind is like fully\noccupied by your appointment at 4 pm\nand you don't have time for anything\nelse like you can't think about anything\nelse\nthen the solution and is to actually\nlike train yourself to kind of let go\nof that thought right and so then the\nquestion becomes okay well how do i do\nthat\nso we just taught you all anthracica so\nthat's actually like a good way to like\nbecause if you think about what rataka\nis dratika is\ntraining your mind to point\nwhere you tell it to so if i train my\nmind to concentrate on\nlike this if i'm looking at this and\nthen like my mind because if you think\nabout the process of meditation\ni'm going to tell my mind i'm going to\nsit here and then the mind is like but\nlet's go over here let's go over here\nlet's go over here let's go over here\nbut i train my mind and i tell it no no\nno we're going to sit here we're going\nto sit here we're going to sit here\nwe're going to sit here\nso one thing that you can do is\nliterally train your mind how to focus\nwhich we kind of just did\nthe other thing that oftentimes happens\nwhen there is like a 4pm thing that you\ncan't think about\nit has to do with the consequences of\nthat thing\nokay so what you need to let you're\ntrying to not\nthink about your 4pm appointment whereas\nwhat you really need to let go of and\nit's hard to let go because\nthat's not actually what you're holding\non to you're not thinking about the\nappointment you're thinking about the\nconsequences of the appointment\nright so what i would do is sit down and\nthink to yourself for a second about\nlike\nwhy is thinking about this so important\nto me\nwhat is it about this that makes me not\nbe able to think about other things\nand then what you'll inevitably find is\nbecause the consequence of that\nappointment\nis so important so like\nit may be like a really important\nappointment\nand and it's kind of interesting because\nwhat you're doing is you're relying on\nyour circumstances to dictate where your\nmind\ngoes which kind of needs to be you can\ntrain it to do\notherwise but i i don't have a\nyeah so you can train your mind i think\nthe second thing to think a little bit\nabout\nis um you know the consequences of the\nthing which is actually what you're\nattached to\nbut i i feel like there's a better\nanswer somewhere there that i'm not\nreally\nable to suss out right now"
