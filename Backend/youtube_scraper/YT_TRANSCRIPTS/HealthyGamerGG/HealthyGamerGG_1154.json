    "transcript": "like even even sheesh do you know sheesh\nno is that a person or a\nthing okay i'll do it once for you okay\nare you ready\n[Music]\nawesome nice to meet you dr k\nnice to meet you too what do you go by\nfriend\num you can call me harrison or you can\ncall me asian doesn't really matter\num what would you what would you prefer\num i think most people call me june june\nokay\njune it is then are we going to be able\nto are are we doing a video interview\ntoday june\nno no no i don't usually do face gun\nokay sure so then let me just make a\nquick adjustment\nokay um so tell me a little bit about\nwhat you'd like to talk about today and\nhow i can be helpful\noh\ni think i want to talk about like maybe\nthree topics maybe\nmaybe one of the three topics if we have\nenough time sure\num i think one of them is like um\nlike opening up in in friendships\nand like relationships because i feel\nlike um\ni can make friends really easily but at\nthe surface level\nbecause i feel like um if i if i think\nof like really close friends right like\nbest friends\nlike people usually open up about like\nsuper personal stuff\nbut then like i tend to never do that to\nother people\nwhere i talk about myself because i feel\nlike i don't\nreally have a moment where i feel like i\nneed to do that\nbecause i feel like i deal with it alone\nanyways\nbut then because i don't do that i feel\nlike\nmost friendships end up just at the\nsurface level\nand i want to change that somehow why do\nyou want to change that\nbecause i want closer friends\nand what makes you want closer friends\ni know it's kind of a weird question\ni think having a lot of friends is\nactually not as good as having a few\nreally close friends\nso you value close friendships\nhave you ever had a close friend\nuh yeah i like close friends from high\nschool\nokay yeah go ahead sorry\nyeah we were able to get like you know\nreally close but\num as time goes on you know like you\nkind of drift apart right because\nabsolutely everyone goes different paths\nso there's not that many times that you\ncan like\ncatch up with them so you meet new\nfriends\nthat are for example like if your\nstreamer you meet other streamer friends\nand what do you think it is that makes\nit hard for you to open up\nhmm i just don't feel the need to\nlike it's just like kind of random to\njust talk about personal stuff\nwith someone that you just met not too\nlong ago\nyeah so that's the first thing i you\nknow i asked you kind of a weird\nquestion which is like\nwhy do you want close friends because i\nthink the first\nthe first question is is really like to\nthink a little bit about\nyou know is there is there a part of you\nthat wants to open up\nbut can't or\ni know this sounds kind of weird but\nlike another possibility is that\nyou sort of know theoretically that like\npeople have close friends and you've had\nclose friends before but it's actually\nnot something that you actually need\nright now\nwhat do you think about that\ni think that also ties into my\nrelationships too where\num like if you don't open up to anybody\nthen how are you supposed to get\nemotionally attached to them right\ndo you want to be emotionally attached\nto people\nyeah i think i i'm not i'm not one to\nget like super\nlonely and stuff like that but i think\nespecially with you know the coveted\nstuff\nlike i feel like um if i do this i might\nend up single\nuntil i'm like 40 or something okay\nand are you so so i know this sounds\nweird june but like\nis the reason that you want to open up\nto people because you want to avoid\nbeing single\nat the age of 40. no no no\nwhy do you not the reason why okay\nthat's very helpful no i just feel like\nit's it's just better to have\nyou know like let's say i do have a\nmoment where i do need people right\nthen i don't really have that moment\nright now\nbut i know later on there's eventually\ngonna be\nyou know moments like that where i need\nsomeone\nbut then like if i never did that with\nanyone then it would be kind of weird to\njust like do it out of the blue right\nyes but i do love listening to other\npeople though\nokay so so i know this is going to sound\nkind of weird june and maybe i'm just\nmissing something because i\nsometimes i when i can't see people's\nfaces i'll like\nmiss play a little bit so apologies but\nbut\ni'm hearing you sort of say a lot of\nlogical reasons why it's good to open up\nto people\nlike oh like what if i need someone one\nday\nright so so but that's kind of\ninteresting because what i'm hearing\nthere is that i should\nopen up to people so if we thought to\nthink about like there's like what i'm\nhearing from you is that you know in\nyour mind you're kind of saying oh it's\nlike\nit's a good idea to open up and form\nconnections with people\nbut there's a difference between like it\nbeing a good idea and it being something\nthat you want\ni think i want to i think you do too but\ni do see it in a logical way as well\nyep so i think this is where like we've\ngot to get underneath the logic to try\nto get\nat what the wanting is because when i\nask you about your motivations\ni get a logical answer does that make\nsense\nyeah that makes sense you see i watched\nyour interviews before and then you'd\nalways ask\nwhy why do you what do you say that\ni thought that was very interesting and\nthat was happening to me so cool\nwhat i'm confused you just lost me\nyou're getting to the bottom of it and i\nusually don't do that with myself\nyeah i just thought that was really cool\nso so i think that what we're seeing\nhere i know this sounds kind of weird\nbut like\nso like june this is going to be weird\nbecause like\ni'm going to try to get you to open up\nright but that's not\nwhat you want to do you want to want to\nopen up\ndoes that mean yeah so you want to be\nsomeone who wants to open up\nyes but you don't actually want to open\nup\nhmm\ni think i just don't know how to like\nhow do how do people\nget to the point where people open up\nyeah totally\ntotally fine so we'll we'll we'll try to\nget you there\nokay june okay\nso a big piece of this is going to be\nlike so what i'm when i say that you\nare someone who wants to be someone\nwho wants to open up so like you're\nstriving to be someone who opens up\nright because that's good and that's\nhealthy and you just don't know how to\nso if we think about is that fair are we\non the same page now\nso if we think about what keeps people\nfrom opening up\nlike so it's almost like something's\nholding you back\nand so the the blockage is between\nopening up like i don't know how to say\nthis but like you want to be someone who\nopens up so there's something\nholding you back from being what you\nwant to be does that make sense\nso we're going to dig into that so can\nyou tell me about your relationships\nuh like friendship was you use the word\nrelationships i don't know what you're\nreferring to there whatever you mean by\nthat oh\ni meant like friendships and then you\nknow also relationships\nbecause i feel like well\nokay just to you know talk about myself\na little bit please\num like right out of high school i went\nto college\nand then um around the same time i\nstarted playing this game called rust\nokay so it's like a survival you know\nfps kind of game\nand then all i did really was you know\nplay that game\nuntil like 18 to like 23.\nokay so basically my entire adulthood\nwas playing that game and then\neventually\ni made youtube videos and then i became\na youtuber and then i started streaming\nand then i became streamer and only\nrecently where\nyou know i'm kind of getting burnt out\nof rust so i'm like venturing out\ninto other games okay and then i met a\nlot of like new friends\nso because i made a lot of new friends i\nwanna\nlike i like them a lot and i want to get\nclose with them\nright but because\ni don't i haven't usually done that\nlike i don't even i i don't like small\ntalk\nso like even at the first step like\nit's already doomed you know what i mean\nwhat why is it tuned doomed\nbecause i feel like if you don't even\nsmall talk then how are you supposed to\nget to the\nthe deep talk\nokay that makes sense it makes a lot of\nsense so what i'm hearing you say is\nthat like\ngenerally speaking the way that\nrelationships progress is that you have\nsome amount of small\ntalk and then you progress to deep talk\nand do you say that you don't like small\ntalk or are you\nnot good at it i'm probably not good at\nit\nokay where do you get that idea\nhmm i just don't know what to say when\nwe're talking about like\nsurface level stuff do you know what to\nsay when you're talking about deep level\nstuff\ni think so i'm really good at like\nlistening to other people\ntalk about deep stuff but then when\nsomeone asks me\nit's like i don't really know what to\nsay because let's say like someone's\ntalking about like super emotional stuff\nright and then they ask me\nlike was there a very like emotional\nmoment for you\nor like that i don't really know what to\nsay because it's not really about like\ni think this also ties to my other topic\nthat i will talk about with you\num i feel like i'm too emotionally\nmoderate\nand what i mean by that is like i never\nget like super depressed\nbut also i don't get super happy either\nokay so like there's not that many like\nmoments of\nvulnerability that i can really talk\nabout with people\nyeah do you think that that's a problem\num i think if i don't\ntalk about stuff like that with people\nthen\nit's not really like a two-way thing\nright\nand you want it to be a two-way thing\nyeah okay\ncan i think for a second june yes\ncan you tell me about your friends from\nhigh school\num well we're all gamers we actually met\nuh playing league of legends together\nand uh they're all very smart\nso basically i'll like sit with them and\nthen the teacher will think that i'm\nsuper smart too\nso are you not super one of them uh\ni would say i'm above average but i'm\nnot smart as them\ndefinitely not supported them okay\nall right so t you would sit with them\nand then the teachers would think you\nwere super smart\n[Laughter]\nwhat was that like oh that was great\nso like in english clash class um\ni sat next to the smartest\nkid in my school which is my best friend\nand then the second smartest\nso the english teacher was like yo this\nguy must be smart he must be like third\nsmartest or something\nso even though i write like\nyeah maybe like uh 86 level\nshe still gave me like a 95 level great\nhmm i'm confused by that\nso like no because she has like a\npre-conception of what i will be like\nso like whatever she reads that i write\nit was it was\nbetter than what it was\nokay so you're saying that she had a\ncognitive bias that caused her to\ninflate the value of your work\nyes okay so let me ask you a question\nokay because you're a super\nlogical dude in above average\nintelligence\nso how would we know if you are a person\nwho\ngets the benefit of a cognitive bias\nfrom a teacher\nor you're misjudging your own skill\nbecause of a cognitive bias on your part\n[Music]\nhow do we know if the paper is really in\n95 and that you believe you're\nyou deserve an 86 which is incorrect\nor whether your paper is an 86 and you\nactually deserve it\nand it gets inflated to a 95.\nhmm i wouldn't know that\ni think i do that a lot though i think\nyou do too\ntell me tell me other other ways that\nyou do that\nso for example if i want to get like\nreally good at something\ni would look at people that\nare really good at that specific thing\nso for example\nlet's say it's like gaming right then\nif i want to be really good at the game\ni would look at the very best\nthe very best in the game and then i\nwould constantly like\ntry to strive to get there\nand then i would just always assume that\ni'm always like under\nyeah i think that's a good and bad thing\nsay more gene i'd agree 100 explain that\nto us please\nbecause i think that always like keeps\nlike a fire underneath you\nto keep going but then um\nyou wouldn't really have like\nsatisfaction\nof getting somewhere because you're\nalways under that\nlevel that you want to get to see that's\nanother thing\num i think i really hate the feeling of\nlike being mediocre\nyep you and me both\nbecause\nbecause like ever since high school i\ntried a lot of things right so in high\nschool i tried like\nwell i still sing like for fun\nbut i really like singing i really like\ndancing\nlike basketball like i like gaming\nobviously\num but i felt like i was like never the\nbest at something i was maybe like\nnumber two or like number three\nlike above average is number two or\nnumber three above average\ni mean i guess technically the answer is\nyes but i don't think about number two\nor number three like i wouldn't\nyou know like if i think about the\nsilver medalist at the olympics\ni hope like when i think about that\nperson i'd\nthe the words above average is not what\ncomes to mind\num but then i think how i was\nlooking at it was like maybe i'm number\ntwo in this school\nbut then like i'll be like oh okay the\nnumber one in my school\nis this guy but then that guy is like\nnumber\n500 million in the world\nsure so\njune how can you tell me about like\nwhere like what growing up was like for\nyou\num in what way\nlike where did you grow up what who\nlived with you at home\noh i lived in vancouver i grew up here\ni'm korean um so basically\ni learned korean first and then learned\nenglish\ni have both my parents living with me\neven until now\ni have one older brother one older\nsister\nand they're much older than me so i\nalways play like diablo 2\nand play the same games that they've\nplayed\nand and i think yeah go ahead\ni think it was a it was a good childhood\ni can't really think of any like traumas\nsure i don't i don't have anything like\nsuper bad i can think of like a time\nwhere i was like super sad\nyeah that's what i mean by\nbeing too emotionally moderate\nlike i don't really like take things too\nseriously so i feel like there's no\nreal significant highlight of my life\nyet\nwhich kind of feels empty sometimes\ncan i think for a second june for sure\nlet me just think okay\ndid your did you\ncompare yourself a lot to other people\nwhen you were young or did your parents\nlike sort of compare you to other people\nwhen you were young\num i think i just did that\nmyself a lot my parents don't really do\nthat\ndo you have a sense of of how you\nstarted doing that\nwhen i see like a good quality in people\nlike\ni want to\n[Music]\ntry to do the same so i would see that\nquality in my\nmy brother or my sister or maybe my\nclassmates\nor maybe like someone older than me or\nsomething i see on tv or whatever\nso and and i know this sounds kind of\nweird but like\nuh so i'm getting a sense that you\nstrive to be more than you are\nit's always about moving forward\nno no\nhmm always striving to move forward\nand the things that i'm passionate about\nnot in like life\nor my career wise but if i\nreally like gaming for example i'm gonna\nalways strive to be better\nyeah okay so so what i'm hearing you say\nis that it's true for the things that\nyou're passionate about but not like\nevery random thing yeah okay\nand so i have a weird question june what\ndo you\nlike are you good enough\ni think i'm good enough\nif you're good enough\nwhat makes you want to be better\nbecause it doesn't give me satisfaction\nthen why do you think you're good enough\nwell i think being good enough doesn't\nnecessarily mean that it's going to give\nyou satisfaction\nwhat does give you satisfaction\nhmm\ni think more than like career like\nmilestones just like having fun\nwith friends probably because i remember\nlike\ndistinctly like i so within the russ\ncommunity\ni made like three tournaments last year\ncalled uh trust and rust\nit's like where we uh brought all the\npeople from the russ community together\nall the creators all the streamers all\nthe youtubers and then we\ndid like a huge event and then we raised\nover like i think\n200 000 in that year\nbut then like when i was done i was like\noh\nwow that was great but then that that\nfeeling was more like relief oh it's\nit's over\nbut i wasn't really like super satisfied\nbut then when i play video games\nwith friends and it was like a really\nfun night i feel like i get more\nsatisfaction from that\nthan something like doing something\nreally cool\nlike if you think logically raising all\nthat money for charity and like helping\nall those people is awesome right\nbut didn't really give me that much\nsatisfaction\nokay so june um i'm noticing a couple of\ndisconnects which which i probably need\nto like try to understand you a little\nbit better here\num so on the one hand you're kind of\ntelling me that like you always are\nlooking at number one right and\nand you kind of recognize that that's\nlike adaptive because it sort of like\nkeeps the fire going and keeps you\nimproving\nand so i i'm sort of i think we're\nrunning into a couple of different like\nconflicts because i think if i ask you\nare you good enough\ni wonder if i'm getting a logical answer\nbut like\nyou know there's a part of me that sort\nof gets the sense that you're striving\nto be number one\nand until you're number one you're not\ngoing to be like good enough or\nsatisfied\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i think you're right i think um\ngood enough is like more like\na logical answer yes yeah so so like if\ni like because\nbecause like you said like you know\nyou're not like you don't have like\nsuper low self-esteem or anything so\nlike you think you're like a decent dude\nright you're above average just a cut\nabove mediocre\nwhy is that funny\nsorry no i think it's\ni think we hit a nerve there\n[Music]\nnow i think a lot of people would be\nsatisfied if\nthey were above average but even if we\neven if i do like something really cool\ni just\ni don't know there's like\ni think it just stems back to like\nemotionally moderate\ni so i i agree so we'll get to so first\nof all june i want to commend you bro\nlike you've done a really good job of\ntying together i think a lot of things\nthat\nfeel like that can seem really far apart\nbut i really do think\nhave a shared root so i think the\nemotional moderation\nthe inability to open up all of this\ntalk about like\nyou know being like never the smartest\nkid in the class\nand essentially like a bias that causes\nyou to devalue where you are\nand and like what i mean by that is like\nyou know you're getting 95s and\nyou're friends with the two smartest\nkids in the class but you sort of don't\nthink you're\nof yourself okay maybe i'm the third\nsmartest kid and i think if we\nif we look at like how that works it's\nbecause your mind\nwill find some the second that you start\nto get towards the top\nwhat does your mind do\ni know it's kind of like a really weird\nabstract like open-ended question\nso i'm just going to toss it out and\nthen i'll give you like an answer\nbut i'm curious if you're kind of can\nread my mind there for a second\nright so like like we kind of we kind of\nheard you say like\nokay even if i think about the number\none in my high school like\nwhat is that number one compared to the\nrest of the world\nso like your mind plays this your mind\nplays this game of constantly moving\ngoal posts\nyeah i think so right so even if you\nrise to the top like what does your mind\ndo\ndoes it let you say good job june you're\nnumber one\nno it doesn't do that what does it do\nmove the goal post absolutely\nright so you're on this like treadmill\nand no matter how far\nyou move forward like you're never going\nto be satisfied\nwhat do you think about it i'm trying to\nfind ways to get that satisfaction\nyeah well so that's because like so\nyou're so you're someone who's like\nwalking on a treadmill instead of\nwalking on a path and then you're asking\nme\nhow do i get to the end of the road\nright where i think the problem is that\nlike as long as you're on a treadmill\nit'll never end\nthat's true so like even if you figure\nout what the treadmill is\nand what the path is yeah so i think the\ntreadmill is that your mind continuously\ncompare\nlike so as soon as you get like even if\nyou became the biggest rust\nyoutuber then your mind is like okay but\nwhat about the biggest\nrust streamer and then if you become the\nbiggest streamer then it's like\noh but they're people who play other\ngames who are bigger than i am\nand then you start comparing yourself to\nthem\num so what i'm hearing from you is you\ndon't think that way in like career-wise\nthough\ndo you feel satisfied in your career\num i feel like right now\nbecause i don't have a game that i enjoy\nlike if i'm not passionate about\nsomething i don't really have that drive\nlike right now i don't have that drive\nyeah so let let me\ntoss something back at you okay so you\nsaid that like if i have a fun\nnight with my friends then i feel\nsatisfied\nyeah like i go to bed like satisfied oh\nthat was a good day yep yep and so\nwhat goal post did you hit by having a\ngood night with your friends\n[Music]\nlike are you thinking about being number\none\nno right so this is like an important\nthing to understand that satisfaction\ndoesn't come from hitting the end of the\nroad\nit comes from not walking on the road\nbut the second you have a goal post and\nespecially if you move the goal post\nyou're never going to be satisfied\nbecause we've seen moments where you\nhave been satisfied but i think i know\nthis sounds kind of like now we get to\nsome of those generic\nyou know yoga calendar stuff but i think\nlike in those moments you're like\nliving in the present you're like today\ni'm gonna play with my friends and we're\ngonna do some cool stuff\nand like then you can feel satisfied but\nwhen you start living in the future when\nyou start living towards\ngoals when you start like thinking about\nbecoming something your mind won't let\nyou be satisfied because like no matter\nhow good you do\nit's gonna advance the goal posts\n[Music]\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i think just like\nprobably finding other ways\nto get satisfaction like whether that's\nlike you know building friendships or i\nthink one thing\nthat did help me recently is\nlike having another avenue where i feel\nlike i'm always making progress\nso like that could be like going to the\ngym or something\nyeah so i think so even if my goal post\nis still there on somewhere else i feel\nlike i'm still moving on a different\npath\nyeah so june now we get to something\nreally hard okay like this is probably\ngonna be like\nreally challenging because i think\nyou're so\num you've come\nto rely on this part of yourself so much\nas a cornerstone of your success\ni think it's going to be really hard to\nlet it go but like\nyou know if you are progressing\nprogress can't come without\ndissatisfaction does that make sense\nlike you're always striving to be more\nbut like if you're striving to be more\nif you want to be better that means that\nyou're not\nhappy with where you are\ndoes that make sense that makes sense\nso like i think there's this weird thing\ngoing on where like\nwhat you use to motivate you\ndooms you to be unsatisfied\nbecause it's never enough right like you\nneed to see the progress to feel good\nabout yourself\nbut that progress implies that like\nyou're\nnot good enough because you need to be\nbetter\nand if you need to be better then like\nyou're not good enough like those two\ncome hand in hand\ndoes that make sense that makes sense\nokay so then like and this is where i\nthink we see this like fundamental idea\nthat you have that you're not\ngood enough play out in the school\nenglish teacher example\nbecause if you believe you're not good\nenough\nand you get a 95 what does your mind\nconclude\nabout why you got the 95\nwas it because you did a good job\nbecause i sat next to two two kids there\nyou go right so like it's weird because\nyour mind\nstarts from the foundation of like\ni'm not good enough so even when life\ntells you like hey man you did a great\njob\nyou're like uh no it's actually a\ncognitive bias\nbecause of where i sit in a classroom\nmy score is nine points higher than\nwhere it deserves to be\nlike just think about that for a second\nbro\n[Music]\nlike i'm sure that teachers have\ncognitive biases but usually those\ncognitive biases\nhave to do with people who kiss their\nass not like where they sit in the\nclassroom\nthat's true and they usually don't have\nlike a\nnine point swing unless you really are\nlike you know stuff in your nose way up\nthere\n[Laughter]\nright okay i definitely didn't do that\nyeah so\nit's it's interesting right\nand so now we get to opening up because\nlike i i know this sounds kind of weird\nbut like\nif you open up to people like what do\nyou think they'll see\num the vulnerable side\nyeah but what is in the vulnerable side\nwhat is in the vulnerable side yeah so\nthis is where i'm going to try to help\nyou out okay\nso like i'm going to give you a\nhypothesis whereas like i think that\nsometimes the reason that we have\ndifficulty\nopening up is because we believe that\nwhat is on the\ninside is ugly\nlike that's the biggest reason to not be\nvulnerable because\nyou don't want to show people like\nwhat's ugly\nright like you can think about people\nwho like are self-conscious about going\nto the beach because of\nthe body that is underneath their\nclothes like who's self-conscious about\ngoing to the beach it's like people who\nare like\nembarrassed to have you know\nlike a flabby stomach or whatever\nand so like like the people who hesitate\nto be vulnerable\nare the ones that have something to hide\ndoes that make sense that makes a lot of\nsense\nbut if i try to think like what\nthings i can talk about\ni don't i don't really know i'm trying\nto think like am i am i hiding something\nbecause i'm trying to like you know\nlisten to what you're saying right but\ni don't know if i have have that\nyep i make sense i i think that it's it\nseems\nit seems very inaccessible to me talking\nto you\nso we'll get to that in a second but\nsomething that i\ni want you to kind of play around with\nis like\nyou know i suspect june that you know i\nmean\ni don't know this could be wrong but\nlike i think there's this weird like\ncomplex of like\nnot being good enough which strives you\nto be better so you love it\nbut that also means that like you never\nview yourself as good enough\nand if you never view yourself as good\nenough like it can be hard to open up to\npeople because like what are you\ndisplaying to them\nlike what do you want to show the world\nlike what do you want people to see you\nas jun\njust a fun guy to be around yeah and so\nif you start telling people like\nand what are you\ni think i think i'm a fun guy to be\naround okay\nright so i think this is where if you\nwant to be a fun guy to be around like\nand you start\nsharing your vulnerabilities with them\nlike what are you then\n[Music]\nfun friend i don't think so man\nright because i don't think you're fun\nanymore\nso now we get to like a couple of\ninteresting questions these are shots in\nthe dark okay\nso on the one hand like maybe we're just\ndigging like i don't really know\nthe first question is have you ever\nopened up to someone\nand like been hurt by it\nhave i opened up to someone and been\nhurt by it yeah\num\nand specifically like we can even like i\ncan ask you very specifically like has\nthere been a case where\nyou felt like someone pulled away from\nyou because you showed them\na side of june that is not fun and fun\nto be around\nthat's the thing i don't think i've done\nthat yet okay that's totally fine\nso other option is have you been on the\nreceiving end of that\nwhere have there been sort of situations\nwhere like people have opened up to you\nor and then like you've sort of seen or\nyou\nyourself have withdrawn from someone\nbecause they show you a part of them i\nknow you're a really good listener so\nthis is probably unlikely but have there\nbeen situations where like\nyou kind of pulled back or you saw other\npeople pull back from someone who's\nvulnerable\ni think i've seen other people that like\ntold me vulnerable things and then\npulled back themselves because they\nyou know kind of exposed that and maybe\nthey thought\nthat i would think differently of them\nor whatever\nyeah but how and what ended up happening\nthere so they pulled back and did you\nlet them or\num i think it's slowly kind of like\ndrifted apart probably\njune i feel like we're missing something\nwhat do you think\ni think\num i think it's um\ni think we're focusing too much on like\nnot being good enough part\nbecause i don't that's not my main issue\nokay so what should we be focusing on\ninstead and what's your main issue\nthat's very helpful feedback by the way\nthank you\ntrying to think as well\ni think in terms of like friendships and\nrelationships\ni think like for example let's say\nin high school i was probably\nafraid to start a relationship because\nif i did i was scared of the\naftermath because i hate conflict\nso i hate the awkwardness\nand i feel like um in the friendships\nthings too if i open up\nand if someone else opens up and then\nthey felt uncomfortable with that\nthen there's the awkwardness as well\nokay what do you what help help me\nunderstand what you hate about the\nawkwardness\n[Music]\num\nyou know like the awkwardness when you\nlet's say date someone\nand then like you're in the front same\nfriend group\nor or whatever\nand then there's like that tension there\nas well like if you didn't date\nit wouldn't be awkward for anyone\ninvolved\nso you're trying to protect people or\nyourself from the awkwardness\nyeah i think for myself yeah so june do\nyou mind if i\nyou don't have to answer this so i'm\ngonna ask a pretty specific personal\nquestion are you\nin a relationship right now no\nhave you been in a relationship that's\nserious before\num not a serious one can you tell me\nabout\na relationship that you have been in\nuh yeah it's quite a long time ago\nthough\nyeah tell me about it\num it was more of like\nthe girl liked me so i was like oh a\ncute girl likes me so you know i got\ninto the relationship\num but then i think i learned from that\nrelationship that\nyou shouldn't really like get into a\nrelationship just because you're lonely\nand the other person is lonely and then\nyou know you have less like infatuation\nbecause like the aftermath is like oh i\ndon't want to see that person anymore\noh i don't want to see their like\nfriends anymore either\nso i feel like just makes everything\nlike kind of uncomfortable\nokay so what happens in a relationship\num it's mostly like just too different\nyeah so so that's maybe why the\nrelationship kind of\nended but can you help me understand\nlike what it looked like from the\noutside or what the sequence of sort of\nevents were\nwell i was like super young i was like\n14 so\nrelationship since then no\nhow do you feel about that\n[Music]\ni don't really have strong like super\nstrong feelings about it but i do feel\nlike i'm missing out\nbecause because i focus so much on like\nrust like from my 18 to like 23\nlike i didn't really travel that much i\ndidn't really live life\ni didn't really date didn't really go\noutside so\ni do feel like i'm missing out and maybe\nthat's like\npart of the reason why i'm not satisfied\nwith all the other things\nbecause i'm only focused on one thing\nokay\nso when you say missing out how does\nthat feel\nmissing out how does that feel\nif that question is hard for you i can\nask it a different way\nsure do you ever think about what the\nconsequences of missing out are\nyou don't know what it's like what does\nthat mean for you going forward\nmakes me curious really\nthat's why i want to travel more once um\nit gets better with covert and stuff\njune do you ever feel like what i was\nexpecting to hear was something along\nthe lines of actually like being a\nlittle bit afraid that like once you've\nmissed out like it's really hard\nbecause like now like everyone's kind of\npast you\nright and so if you try to like date\nsomeone\nsometimes people will feel like oh like\nshe's gonna be more experienced than i\nam and like i'm not\nreally gonna be sure like it'll be\nawkward\ndo you ever have thoughts like that\nnot really interesting okay\nsee i think i know what kind of\nquestions you're asking and i know\ni know the answers that could be said\nbut like\nit's i don't know it's just not like\nthat for me\nyep and i know i know i know people can\nbe like oh he's just hiding it but like\ni don't my my feeling of the\nsatisfaction is that\nit's it's that i don't really feel those\nthings and that's what makes it feel\nempty\nyeah so it looks like what we're coming\nback to\nso i'm i'm really happy you said that\njune because i i don't think that just\nbecause\nyou know so like we can it's just as\nimportant to close off the wrong paths\nas it is to find the right one\nso in medicine you know we have this\nconcept called differential diagnosis\nand like you know if someone has a fever\nlike maybe it's the flu maybe it's\ncoveted maybe it's\nyou know strep throat maybe it's\nlymphoma\nor lupus and sometimes in medicine we\nhave to order tests\nnot to necessarily find the right\ndiagnosis\nbut we'll order a test to make sure it\nisn't lymphoma\nin order test to make sure it isn't\nlupus and so we can almost use like a\nprocess of elimination approach\nand so i think i think part of what\nwe're doing here today is sort of a\nprocess of elimination approach\nwhat do you think yeah i had a tough\ntime answering those questions actually\nyep and if you think about it it's like\nreally simple questions\nwhy do you think you have a tough time\nanswering them\nbecause i think if you ask like like how\ndo you feel about that right\nit's like\nthat's the thing i didn't really feel\nanything about that yep\nand so i feel like i feel like that\nwould be like a\nsuper mundane answer\nbut then like if i said anything else it\nwould be it'll be a lie\nyep and so how do you feel about giving\nme on dana\nmundane answers hey you know what i\nthink i think i tied this together\nhuh because because i don't have\nexperiences like that\ni feel like that's why i can't open up\nbecause i don't want to i don't want to\ngive boring answers\nokay okay yeah so\nyou feel like the answers that you give\nwhen you open up aren't going to be good\nenough\nthey'll be boring no i'm i'm being\ncompletely honest right now like i'm not\ntrying to like\ni'm making sure honestly i'm talking i'm\ntalking about other people though\nright because you say that like if i\noffer what's on the inside\nit's gonna feel bland to people\nyes right so like i'm just noticing\nan interesting theme like sure i get\nthat it's bland\nand i'm not i i know i i get the sense\nyou're being authentic with me i don't\nthink you're trying to like you know\nhide i don't i genuinely don't think\nyou're hiding but at the same time i do\nnotice that there's sort of like a theme\nthat like what you have to give isn't\ngood enough\nyeah that could be a thing so then let\nme ask you this like\nso let's go let's go to the emotional\nmoderation then\nso you you don't feel things quite as\nintensely as other people feel them\nand i'm very jealous of that so like if\npeople are like\nsuper sad about something or like if\nsomeone's super ecstatic about something\nlike i see that i'm like i wish i had\nthat\num have you ever felt\nsuper sad or excited about something\nsuper sad or excited about something\ni think i probably have but like in\nhindsight if i look back to it\ni think i always like downplay it\nso like during the moment i was probably\nsuper excited but then like if i look\nback like two years later\ni'd be like oh it wasn't that good\nso i don't remember that feeling as\nintensely as i probably had it when it\nhappened\nso like if i try to look back right now\nlike i can't really recall\nany specific moment to tell you\num do you ever let me just think about\nthis\nokay so june here's so i know this may\nbe like a little bit\nunsatisfying but i'm gonna like toss out\nlike a possibility okay so have you ever\nheard of this term alexithymia\nno so alexithymia is a condition\nin which you are not aware of what your\ninternal emotions are\nso it's almost like you're colorblind to\nemotion\nso lexithymi is very common um\nin like three populations so like\nyou know a lot of like asians are alexa\nthymic\num indians too uh\nmen and gamers so if you think about\nlike the culture that you grew up in\nwhat was like was there a lot of emotion\nexpressed in your household growing up\nno did your parents tell you that they\nloved you\ni think no okay i could see that i mean\nthey\nare great parents yep and i could feel\nthe love\nbut we never verbally said it and i\nthink\nat when i was like around 17\ni think i had a feeling where i was like\nwhy is my family not\nlike the ones i see in movies like\nthe ones you see in movies are like\nsaying oh i love you and like\ndoing like all this affectionate stuff\nbut then i realized\nthat like part of the problem is not\njust my parents\nit's also me i was also afraid to say i\nlove you\nlike i would say like i love you too\nlike girls like that i didn't even\n[ __ ] care about\nwhen i was younger but then i was so\nscared to say that to my mom\nright so i think starting from then\ni did start saying it to my mom and dad\nand then we are pretty regularly saying\nthat now\nwhat made you scared to say that to your\nmom and dad\nit's embarrassing it was embarrassing at\nfirst\nwhat's embarrassing about it\nwell i think growing up and not doing\nthat kind of stuff and then all of a\nsudden doing it\nwhen you're an angsty teenager i think\nthat's pretty\num you're like going to put in a\npretty vulnerable place i think\nand what if i say that what if i say\nthat and then you know\nthe response is like oh why are you\nsaying that\nor whatever\nand and i'm curious is is that\nso we're talking about vulnerability and\nhow people may respond to it\num you know but it sounds like you've\nnever been in a situation where you have\nopened up to someone so it sounds like\nyou were actually vulnerable with your\nparents like you went on a limb\nand you said i love you and they said i\nlove you too you're great june\nyes yeah so\ni feel like that's significant and\nrelates to our conversation but i'm not\nquite sure how\nwhat do you think\ni think i think something's clicking\ni think um just like\ncan't really expect other people to be\nvulnerable with me if i don't take the\ninitiative\nto be vulnerable with them as well sure\nbecause that's like saying i love you to\nyour mom or that's like i don't know\nsharing like something\nemotional with your friends\nwhat would you share\ni don't know that's what i'm\ntrying to figure out yeah so i i feel\nlike that's\ni feel like something clicked for me\nthere too i don't know exactly what it\nis but it certainly has the themes of\nvulnerability\ngoing out on a limb being accepted\nyou know and i think this is where when\ni when we talk about culture so i think\nthat like\nlike so you know june it sounds like\nyou're good at singing sounds like\nyou're good at dancing sounds like\nyou're good at basketball it sounds like\nyou're really good at rust\nand so when it comes to understanding\nour emotions that's a skill too\nright so like we we can be just like you\ncan train your palate\nor train your eyesight or train your you\nknow your reflexes\nyour hand-eye coordination your ability\nto like get the\nball in the basket you can also train\nyourself to understand\nwhat you feel on the inside and there\nare a couple of different things that i\nthink could be going on so i'm going to\ngo like academic for a second\nand let's like forget yeah because\nbecause i'll ask you lots of questions\nabout how you feel about stuff and\nyou'll\nyou generally give me umbrella terms so\nyou'll say like\nuncomfortable or awkward but like\nwhat is awkward right so like usually\nawkwardness is an umbrella term\nthat like means something like fear of\njudgment\nfor feeling guilty for making like\ndestroying your friend group\nright so when i think about like the\nactual emotions\nthat people are feeling if you date\nsomeone in your friend group and then\ny'all\nbreak up there's actually a whole\nconstellation of feelings there\nthat we call awkward because we don't\nknow how to\ndefine what they are okay i i gotta know\nright so like\nlet's just think through what people\ncould be feeling the first is you guys\ngo to a party\nand then like all of your friend group\nis there or maybe\neven before the party starts it's like\npeople are texting each other\nand then you feel guilty because like\npeople don't know like who to text\nit's supposed to be fun but now that you\nand your girlfriend broke up\nthe entire group like can't have fun\nanymore\nso maybe you feel guilty yes\nright but like guilty yeah but it's\nweird because like you don't\nlike we don't put words to that or maybe\nyou feel ashamed\nlike maybe you feel like you know she\nhas some friends in the friend group\nthat are closer to her than\ncloser to you and as she's crying every\nday\nlike she's gonna make you look bad\nbecause the friends are gonna think oh\nyou're an [ __ ]\nand so then like maybe you feel a little\nlike you that can create all kinds of\nfeelings maybe you feel a little bit\nshamed ashamed for hurting her\nmaybe you feel a little bit like angry\nbecause\nshe's talking [ __ ] about you and like\nsince those are her friends better like\nthey're gonna start thinking less of you\nand you don't deserve that\n[Music]\ndoes that make sense that people could\nkind of feel that way\nyeah that makes a lot of sense because i\nfor me i was like oh awkward okay that\nencapsulates what i feel really well but\nnow that you like\nbreak it down i can see what you mean\nthat right so so and\nand then there's like they're even all\nlike all kinds of kinds of other layers\nlike\nwhat if you're crushing a little bit on\nsomeone else in the friend group\nand so like what's gonna happen there\nnow that you broke up with this person\nor like what if one of your friends is\ncrushing on her\nand now you broke up with her and now\nyou've like that's complex\nit's very complex yeah i\ni don't like that at all okay\nso now i hate conflict of any kind okay\nso now we're getting somewhere so the\nfirst thing is like\nwhat do you hate about conflict\ni just don't want to have any bad blood\nwith anyone why\nwhy i want all my interactions to be\npositive\nyeah so that's why you're not going to\nopen up to anyone\nhmm maybe that's it right because you\ngotta like\nhere's the thing like so here's the\nthing june so when it comes to alexa\nthymia\nwhat happens so this is what happens is\nlike so culturally we're like taught to\nsort of suppress emotions so we don't\nlike\nunderstand what they are so we use these\nterms like awkward right\nfine secondly when you play a lot of\nvideo games like literally\nvideo games will shut off like i was\njust talking about this i can't believe\nthis\nbut video games will shut off your\namygdala\nwhich is like the part of your brain\nthat experiences emotions\nyeah right absolutely right so like rust\nis like\nso so then what's happening is you've\ngot like you know eight hours a day or\nwhatever where you're like playing rust\nand so what you're doing is you're like\nswitching off this emotional circuitry\nso it starts to get rusty\nand then on top of it it sounds like\nyou're a dude\nand so like generally speaking\nespecially like like culturally\nin most cultures that like you know\nwomen\nwill emotionally express things to each\nother\nin a platonic way but as men\nlike you know like like it's weird we\nuse like the language of body\nright so like if i get like dumped by my\ngirlfriend\nor if i break up with my girlfriend i'm\nnot gonna come to you and say\nhey june i feel really bad about myself\nand then you're gonna say like yeah man\nsucks bro and then i'm not gonna say\nlike\nyeah i'm now afraid i'm now afraid that\ni will never be able to find love again\nand that there's something fundamentally\nbroken in me because i couldn't make\nthis relationship work\nthat's so true right what i'm gonna say\nyou're gonna be like sucks bro and i'm\nlike yeah man i'm gonna be like yeah it\nfeels like she tore my nut sack off\nand you're like yeah man i know exactly\nwhat you're talking about\nyeah i see i see girls do that a lot\nlike like being like super\nlike open with each other and you know\nbeing like very descriptive with their\nwords and like\nyou know actually explaining their\nemotions well i i i'm really jealous of\nthat\nbecause like if i try to uh like when\nyou ask me\nabout my emotions like i had no idea\nwhat to say yeah\nyep so so so i think that like the first\nproblem here is alexa thymia\nbecause when i point it out to you right\nso like so\neven if we pay attention i don't know if\nthis makes sense june but how are you\nfeeling emotionally right now\nright now yeah um\nso i i'm not actually i'm not gonna feel\nlike it's getting getting more clear\nyes okay so that's but that's not an\nemotion\noh man right it's an emotion yeah yeah\nit's it's okay it's okay\ndon't get frustrated so like what is\nwhat is the energy of the conversation\nnow\nwhat's the energy it's a little bit more\ncomfortable yep right so like there's a\nchange in the tone of your voice\nyou're laughing\nright whereas like before it clicked\nyeah before it's like\nhmm because i couldn't really think of\nlike what to say\nright so so what's happening how to\ndescribe what i was thinking\ntotally fine so like as we get closer to\nthe truth\nsome kind of emotion is going to come up\nand like it doesn't matter what it is\nit's like in what we're hearing you do\nis laughing like i can\nhear the animation in your voice\nand there's the hmm\ni can't help it yeah that's fine you\ndon't need to help it like we're we're\nhere to help it right it's it's totally\nfine\nyou do you baby so\nso like it and that's where like okay so\nbecause now as i as i explain these\nemotions to you like\nyou know i know this sounds kind of\nweird jun sometimes i say things that\nsound so basic they sound idiotic but\nwhen i point these possibilities out to\nyou you\nunderstand exactly right so like but\nyou can't understand when i point it out\nunless on some level you know\nif you truly did not feel those things\nand i said oh like maybe this person is\nfeeling this you'd be like scratching\nyour head you'll be like\nyeah i can sort of see that does that\nmake sense\nyeah but you're like yes yes i can\ni can understand all those things i'm\nconflict-avoided like you call it\nconflict avoid it because that's what it\nlooks like from the outside or that's\nthe surface level\nway that you describe it but really what\nit is is like i can't tolerate people\ndisliking me\n[Music]\nright and so if we think about you know\nwhy can't you tolerate people disliking\nyou like\nthere's an emotion there that could be\nfear\ni'm afraid i can't i can't tolerate\npeople that i like disliking me\nyeah that's what scares me if someone\nrandom\ninternet stranger didn't like me i\nwouldn't care at all\nabsolutely so now my family or my\nfriends or\nlet's say like my community then i'll be\nlike oh\nthere must be something i did wrong and\nthat would bother me a lot\nso so now we get to so there's origins\nto that but before we go there like now\nwe get to the vulnerability\nso anytime you have a surface level\nrelationship with someone\nand you be vulnerable with them what are\nthe possible\noutcomes of that vulnerability\n[Music]\nyou wouldn't talk to them anymore\npossibly right it either strengthens the\nrelationship\nor shatters the relationship yeah\nand so like i can sort of see like why\nyou may feel\nlike i imagine that you almost feel\nparalyzed in these relationships like\nyou're kind of stuck\nat the surface level\nand and i think if you really look into\nthat one of the possibilities is that\nlike\nyou don't know how to make sure that\nwhen you vulnerably express something\nthat it's going to advance the\nrelationship forward\nyeah i have no clue you don't know how\nto say something that\nwon't make things awkward\nnot awkward like i can i can\nso it's not i can't i can't talk about\nlike personal stuff without making it\nawkward that's what i mean yeah so so\nyou don't know like you can talk about\nsurface level stuff but like it's your\navoidant like you don't want to make\nthings awkward right june\nlike scale of one to ten with friends of\nyours\nten being is absolutely terrible one\nbeing is no big deal\nhow much do you want to avoid\nawkwardness\nso they're not on any awkwardness right\nso like\nand now this is like the crux of it\nbecause if you're\nlike you don't know how to be vulnerable\nwith someone without making it awkward\nand so you're avoiding awkwardness at\nall costs the\ner ergo like you can't be vulnerable\nwith anyone\nand so the challenge here is it comes\ndown to control june\nlike the whole point about advancing a\nrelationship i know this sounds weird\nand it's gonna sound terrifying\nand if you're trying to figure out how\nyou feel when i'm about to say what i'm\ngonna say\nthe answer is terror when you are\nvulnerable with someone\nyou are opening the door to awkwardness\nyou are seeding control of the\nrelationship and it could rupture\nhow does that make you feel\nvery afraid there it is and so now we\nsee why you can't open up because that's\nthe whole point about vulnerability\nright it's like\ni'm gonna let like vulnerability is like\nlike literally the word means\ni'm going to let give you the\nopportunity to hurt me\nand right now you control your [ __ ]\ncharismatic guy aren't you june\nyou're so good at making friends you are\nso good at getting people to like you\nyou can show this shell to people and\nyou can like man\neveryone when they meet june within 15\nminutes look at this chad\nokay dancer\nyou're gassing me up a little bit too\nmuch right no but like come on bro like\ntell me i'm wrong tell me if i if i met\nyou in real life in 20 minutes\nwould i like you\nuh maybe i think the answer is yes\nright look at [ __ ] look at how humble\nyou are i hope so\nhow how down to earth is this guy right\nlike he's not an arrogant prick he's\njust like so\nlike how is that not the perfect\nresponse\nlike just think about it right it's\nperfect i hope you like me man\nlike i'm confident in myself and i hope\nyou can appreciate that\nbut you don't say no because you don't\nhave [ __ ] low self-esteem and you\ndon't say yes because you're not an\narrogant prick\nit's so perfect it's so [ __ ] silky\nsmooth man like teflon right here\nwd-40\noh man because people do like you right\njune\nuh i like to think so yeah yeah well\nit's still so humble\nright like it you can state it without\nbeing arrogant like i think you're\nyou're probably charismatic\nand like now the problem though is that\nlike that\nshell which you have which makes people\nlike you\nis something that you have to discard\nand you have to make\nlike risk making things awkward if you\nwant to advance the relationship\n[Music]\nand like you know when it comes to girls\ni don't know if like the reason that you\ni mean i'm assuming that you're\nheterosexual because it sounded like you\nwere talking about a girlfriend but\nyeah um you know like\ni mean i don't know if it's like because\nyou've become a big youtuber and\nstreamer that you don't really have\nopportunities to engage in relationships\nor\nthere like have been girls that you've\nbeen interested in\nand like something has kept you\nfrom like asking them out\nyeah i've actually never asked someone\nout before\nokay so like here we go baby so like\nwhen you think about asking someone out\nwhat are you afraid of right i'm like\nit's like golden word\nis awkward there it is right there it is\nagain\nand so like what like but awkward it's\nnot a thing\nright it's just like it's like it's not\na thing\nit's yeah it's an umbrella term like i\nget that it makes things awkward but\nlike what is the awkwardness that you're\ntrying to avoid is it like\noh we're kind of friends right now and i\ndon't want to screw that like what is\nlike\nit's it's there jude like don't like you\nmay not be able to find it but like\ni don't even know if we're gonna find it\ntoday but it's there right what like\nwhen you\ni guess i'm gonna have to guess because\ni don't know if you can find it but like\nso there's this girl like so tell me\nabout it like can you do you feel okay\ntalking about a girl or is that too\nawkward\nno i can talk i can talk so like talk to\nme about a girl that you liked\nokay i think there's only like two girls\nthat i actually seriously liked\nand it's mostly people that were\nwhat i was super interested at the time\nand they were what i considered like\nlike the most passionate about it\ni think i think passion is a big thing\nso like passion's a big turn on for you\nyes so one of them was like a martial\nart right and they would always like\nwork super\nhard so like i would first get that\nattention and then it's like admiration\noh\nwow this person's working so hard like\ni'll work as hard as them and then it\nturns into infatuation\nso it sounds like what do you mean by\ninfatuation\nwell you admire them as people first and\nthen\nand then you start liking them okay\nand so and so like what did you want to\nlike and that you thought about asking\nher out\num\nthe first girl actually did like me back\nbut then i don't know i just like\nit was kind of gone the second girl was\nlike in dance\nand it was like the same thing like she\nwas like super good at dance and i was\nlike\nwow like she was super passionate about\nit\nand then i liked her like as a person\nand as like a dancer\nand then i wanted to be i wanted to be\nlike them and then\ni started liking them afterwards and\nthen what happened\nthe two are kind of different because\nthe first one\ni kind of did say wait i didn't really\nask her out but\nwe kind of figured out that we liked\neach other but then\nit kind of fizzled out so i don't really\nhave much to say about that\nwhat do you mean by it kind of fizzled\nout\ni think i just lost interest\nokay so june i want to just like point\nout to you what i'm seeing okay like\nlet me know if you feel judged but like\ni'm seeing like blind spots\nin this conversation\nright so it's it's like you can trust me\ni do too yeah yeah yeah yeah\nso it seems really weird but that's just\nhow it was yeah yeah no i i understand\nso i think what we've got to do is like\nincrease your like ability to detect\nright so like\nlike here's this girl you're infatuated\nwith her\nyou respect her as a human being like\nhow are you not just like the perfect\nboyfriend jun\nlike you respect her as a human first\nand then like you like you you like her\nyou guys like each other\nand then it fizzles out it's like that\nsounds like lost interest\nmaybe maybe it was because like if i if\ni really try to think about it\ni think um\nbecause i saw her in like such a\npositive light at first\nlike once i got to know her maybe she\nwasn't what i expected\nand then it fizzled out is that the case\ni think that was the case for the first\none okay what about the second one\nthe second one i never really made a\nmove\nwhat kept you from making a move\nprobably just insecurity what does that\nmean\nbecause i like regarded her so highly i\njust didn't think\nthat i'll be good enough\ni'm sorry have we talked about that\nbefore you not being good enough\nright so so now it's interesting because\nlike you know were you afraid that\nthings would get awkward if you asked\nher out\num yeah because i enjoyed our company\nlike\neven without dating but then if i\ncross that line that would be gone too\nyep\nso so that's the thing right so like\nremember like so this is why i think\nyour relationship state okay so june\nthis is tying together for me now okay\nmay not tie together for you but it's\nseeming like we're kind of hitting these\nsame notes like over and over and over\nagain\ni don't know if it's because i'm making\nlike i'm drawing a constellation out of\nstars\nand there really isn't like a horse in\nthe sky it's just stars\nit's all over the place there's no\nthere's no image with my constellation\nso maybe it's just me over interpreting\nbecause that's a bias of people in my\nprofession\nis we like to come we like to listen to\nhuman beings and reduce them to simple\npatterns that we can divine\nout of our psychiatric brilliance so i\ncould be falling into that trap\nbut i really don't think so so here's\nwhat i'm hearing from you okay so the\nfirst thing is that like\nyou like this person and then like the\nproblem is that like\nat some point to advance the\nrelationship you've got to take a risk\nright like and this is where like stuff\ncomes together so there's this girl\nshe's in dance like you respect her\nbecause she puts in the work like you\nput in the work it's something that you\npride very heavily about yourself\nyou may not be the smartest kid in the\nbunch you may not be the gold medalist\nbut god damn it you're gonna at least\nget a bronze because like\nyou can progress like you can put in the\nwork and you can put in the time\nand here she is she's into dance she's\nprobably in shape\nshe's relatively hot and then like you\nknow so\nyou're like you're into her and you guys\nare friends because you're\ncharismatic and you're a likable guy\nand then probably what happened is like\na couple of things maybe you felt her\nout a little bit right like\nyou kind of put out some signals like\nhey but like you never were\ntoo transparent about it because like\nyou said with the first girl like you're\npretty good at like sussing things out\nbut you're never gonna ask directly\nyou're never gonna make anything awkward\nright\nyou're never gonna put her in the place\nof like hey i'm really into you like are\nyou interested in going out\nbecause oh my god that would be so\nawkward what if she says no\nand so now the problem is that like\nthere's this is where things really\nstart to like come together\nin this terrible storm because if you're\ninsecure about yourself\nthat makes it even harder for you to\nrisk if you were secure if you were good\nenough\nthen you'd be okay rolling the dice\nbecause then it's i know it sounds weird\njune but it's not even rolling the dice\nat that point right\nlike the risk is low the more confident\nyou are in yourself\nyeah and so you strive for progress\nand you strive to be the gold medalist\nbecause if you're the gold medalist\nthen you can roll the dice and it won't\nmatter\nbecause you're so good like you you know\nthat people will accept you\neven though that's not true like i know\nit's not true you know it's not true but\nit's like this kind of like clicks\ntogether\nin this weird way because you're always\nstriving to be better always striving to\nbe better always striving to be better\nand then\none day if you're good enough then you\ncan ask someone out and then there's no\nrisk\ndoes that make sense yeah\nbut now the problem is that like even\nwith your relationships the very nature\nof asking someone out\nis that it is a risk the very nature of\ndeepening\ndeeping deepening a relationship is that\nit involves vulnerability\nyeah and you try so hard to control your\nrelationships\nto keep them perfect you want no\nyou don't want anyone that you care\nabout to dislike you\nat all and that's sort of like it's kind\nof like\nbro if i'm like never willing to get\ninto the ring\nand take a couple of punches like i'm\nnever going to be able to play the game\nyou know like i mean it sounded like you\nplayed league of legends i'm not too\nfamiliar with russ i mean i know it's\nlike a cooperative survival mmo kind of\nthing\nright let's look at the common ground as\nleague of legends i played that game a\nlot so it's like it's like if i'm afraid\nof losing\nand i never queue up from league like\nthat's what i hear you\nsaying to me that like i don't know how\nto queue up for a game of league because\nyou're so terrified about like losing\nand it's like\nit's just part of the game\nyeah that actually gave me a lot of\ninsight what you just said\nbecause i actually never thought about\nit but i do\ni do wait until everything's perfect if\ni want to do something big\nyeah then wait until it's perfect\nbecause i hate risk yeah\nright and this is the thing so like risk\ntolerance\nties to confidence because if we think\nabout what confidence\nis confidence is the ability to face\nuncertainty\nand the more that you stack the deck in\nyour favor before you act\njune what happens to your confidence\nif i stack the deck in my favor and then\ni act am i more confident afterward\nno probably not the exact opposite it\nreinforces my insecurity\nbecause it's not me that did it it's all\nof these\nother things that made sure that it\nworked out ridiculous planning\nyes and so like now i'm going to give\nyou just an analogy for medicine\nokay okay so can i share a story about\nmyself\noh yes okay i love that so like i\nfinished medical school and then\neveryone called me a doctor\nbut i know this sounds kind of weird but\nwhen you finish medical school like\nyou're not really a doctor\nyou know does that make sense like you\njust get your md it's like with the day\nbefore medical school you don't have\nyour md degree and then\nyou walk down the stage and someone\nhands you a piece of paper and then like\nmagically you're a doctor you're not a\ndoctor you're just\njust like one day you're a fourth year\nmedical student you're not a\nfull-fledged doctor sure technically\nyou're a doctor\nbut does that make sense that makes\nsense\nand so like i\ni still remember the day that i became a\ndoctor i was at a wedding\nand then someone was like is there a\ndoctor here and i was like oh [ __ ]\nbecause normally like when you yeah so\nlike normally like\nso then you start residency okay which\nis like where you really learn how to be\na doctor\nso you go to the hospital and then\nyou're taking care of patients but you\nhave like\nsupervisors who are above you so i'm\nthere at the hospital i'm taking care of\npatients but i have a senior resident i\nhave an attending physician\nso there's a dude with 20 years of\nexperience there's a dude with three\nyears of experience there's a dude\nhe's one year ahead of me and this is my\nteam i'm the bottom on the totem pole\nbut there are three people looking over\nmy shoulder all the time\nwhat we're like butt buddies like the\nbody system oh\nright so they're okay i know where\nyou're going with this and so then you\nwant me to finish or you want to\nyeah let me finish no no go ahead go\nahead so like here i am at the wedding\nand it's like oh crap and i'm like\nwaiting for someone else to say\nyou know i'm i'm but there's like it's\nbizarre my mom is a doctor\nso my mom [ __ ] my mom volunteers me\nshe's a doctor she's been practicing for\n30 years\nand then she's like oh yeah like my son\nis a doctor i was like\nyou're like i've been doing this for six\nmonths you've been doing this for 30\nyears\nand then she like points at me like i\nstill remember she points at me we're in\nthis big hall with like 400 tables\nthere's over 400 people like 50 tables\nand she points at me\nand then i see like people walking over\nand i'm like what\nand then they're like oh like your mom\nsaid you're a doctor and i was like yes\nthat is true and then we walk outside of\nthe hall and there's like this 70 year\nold lady who's like\nlaying down on a couch and i'm like oh\n[ __ ] and my mom is there i don't think\nshe realizes what she had done\nand then and then so they're like you\nknow oh like she's feeling light-headed\nthis is like like like the bride of the\ni mean the grandmother or the bride\nand she's like my grandma's like\nlightheaded and i'm like oh [ __ ]\nis she having a heart attack is she\nhaving a stroke is she\nyou know so then i'm like okay well\nand then like your training kicks in\nthere's no senior residents no\nattendings\nand my mom has abandoned me which is you\nknow\nif i ever talk to a psychiatrist on\nstream we can talk about that\nbut and so there i am and it's like okay\nso i talked to her you know i'm like\nokay what do i do like okay i check her\nblood pressure you know ask her a couple\nof questions like\ni do a neurological exam i'm like okay\nblink and then do this and look to the\nright and look to the left\nswallow smell my fingers i know it\nsounds weird but something that you do\num you know try to smell this thing and\nlike okay like can you can you wiggle\nyour fingers wiggle your toes\nokay you know are you having any chest\npain and then i look at her and she\ndoesn't seem that\nsick right like i know this sounds weird\nbut like even you june\nlike you know you see some people\nsometimes and you're like that person is\nsick\nand then other people are like oh like\nthat person isn't that sick she doesn't\nlook sick and i'm like yeah it sounds\nlike maybe you're dehydrated have you\nlike had any water today\nand she's like yeah i had a little bit\nand i was like why don't you have some\nwater i'm gonna sit here with you i\ndon't think we need to call 9-1-1 yet\nbut i'm going to sit here with you with\nfor 15 minutes like i get you some food\nget you some water she's feeling better\nokay let's like\nit's fine no one needs to go to the\nhospital\nokay and it's like holy [ __ ] i'm a\ndoctor\nyou're a doctor and so like where does\nthat confidence come from\nthere's no attendings it's just me\nand grandmother of the bride and the\nproblem\nis that like you're good at rust right\njune\nand when you start on a rust server\nwho's got your back\nwho's got my back yeah\nmy teammates okay right\nbut there are other teams\nand so like yeah like like sure your\nteammates have your back but like you\nknow when you go into a game of league\nof legends like even it's a team game\nit's you right like it's not like it's\nnot like\nyou know riot games is like sitting\nthere like recoding things to make your\nhero overpowered\nwhich is exactly what you do in real\nlife is you try to like\nyou know open up dev tools\nand structure your life so that you\nnever have to take risks\nand then the more that you do that like\nthe harder it becomes to open up because\nyou want to avoid that awkwardness\nat all costs and like i don't know how\nto say this bro but like\nif you're never willing to you know make\nthings awkward\nit's gonna be really hard to ask a girl\nout\nbut you have your plan june and you know\nwhat your plan is\nyour plan is to wait until you're 100\nsure that she likes you and she's gonna\nsay yes\nand then you will ask her out\nyou're going to ask your friends you're\ngoing to ask her friends and you're\ngoing to make sure that everything\ni'll never do that okay that would make\nthings too awkward\nbut you got to be sure before you take\nyour shot\nand as long as that's the case bro\nyou're gonna be like stuck at this level\nthat was a really good uh story because\ni think it relates\nbecause like even if you even if you\ndidn't think you were a doctor at the\ntime because you were like six months in\nand there was like all these other\npeople that had way more experience than\nyou you were still a doctor\nand then once you're like put into that\nposition you're able to do it anyways\neven though you didn't think you were a\ndoctor at first yep\nso here's the thing june did i think i\nwas good enough\nno but you did it anyways was i good\nenough\nyes did you get an 86 or did you get a\n95\ni got a 95. and what did you think you\ndeserved\na hundred months ago\nsee i'm getting close to something you\ncan deflect with humor if you want to\nbecause here's the thing june you are\ngood enough you've been good enough\nyou deserve the 95 then your parents\nhave loved you since the day you were\nborn\nand those chicks were totally into you\nyou don't need to be any better than\nwhat you are right now you're\nyou're golden bro like should you\ncontinue to grow as a human being\nabsolutely but you're good enough\nthank you i think um right now\ni am trying to be like opening up more\nlike i'm like\ntalking to people more like initiating\nmore friendships\nbecause i never used to do that honestly\nlike even last year i didn't really do\nthat\nbut then like this year i'm really\ntrying to do that um\ni think in terms of like dating i'm not\ni'm not too worried\nback then i didn't have a lot of\nconfidence i think i grew like over the\nlast five years i did grow\na little bit more confidence i think\nright now the only issue is\ni'm just not able to even\nhave the first step where i have a girl\nthat i like\nbecause i like because i code\nbasically yeah so if that's the case\nlike that's why\nyou know this is this is why we're gonna\nhave this conversation now and like\nhopefully people will get vaccinated\nturns out people may need a third\nbooster\nbut i think you'll get there but i think\nthe main thing june is you've got to\nstop running away from awkwardness\nright and that's where like like like\novercoming awkwardness is not going to\nhappen as long as you don't know what it\nis\nand so the next step is going to be like\nunpacking what is awkwardness in a given\nsituation\nright so like if you think about someone\nwho you want to deepen a relationship\nwith\nwhat are you saying that would make\nthings awkward and like what is the\nawkward is it fear\nis it guilt is it shame you know like i\nwill send you something called the\nfeelings wheel\nand if you have like a friend or\ntherapist or something like that that\nyou can work with dude that'd be awesome\nuh like we're i'm gonna send you the\nfeelings we'll like you're gonna just\ncircle the feelings okay oh it looks\nlike\nsomeone is fog\nokay so let me forward this to you\noh you actually have the feeling wheel\nyeah one\none of our how do i\ncopy image so i will just\nokay so yeah can you take a look at that\noh my god\nokay this is so big\nyes hold on chat let me let me open this\nwait there's like there's like a hundred\nwords here\nyes wow this is like beyond my\nvocabulary\nwell yeah so like we're gonna we're\ngonna progress\njune because that's something you're\ngood at\nright so like this is the feelings wheel\nso when we talk about awkward\nyou know it's gonna be feeling rejected\nexcluded in that group after you break\nup with a girlfriend\nfeeling inadequate feeling anxious\nfeeling bitter\nfeeling humiliated feeling resentful\nfor your friends for siding with her\ninstead of fight siding with you\nfeeling overwhelmed out of control\npressured to ask her out quickly or\nbe nice or fix your problems\nyou know you know i i really think\njust like just being a streamer\nlike really made me worse in being\ndescriptive\nbecause what ends up happening dr k\ni don't know if you've already reached\nthis point\nin streaming where you just like say\neverything as kw\nyeah yeah you know it's it's it's\ninteresting right because i i think that\nlike\nlike you know when i was talking about\nhow men describe\nyou know feelings and physical ways\ni i think actually one of the things\nthat's really cool um\nis that we do have our own vocabulary\nright and it's just not mine right now\nis sag\nyeah but but so that's the thing right\nis if you really look at it like the\nreason that there are so many different\nicons\nis because bad man and sag and pepe han\npepe hands is different from pepe crying\ntrue right pepe with tears in his eyes\nis different from pepe crying\nand and like there's like feels bad man\nand then there's sag and then there's\nfeels sag\nman so it's almost like you could\nconstruct a feeling wheel\nwith like all of the emotes\nand that would work right like\nunderneath sag\nthere's feels bad man and then there's\nfeels sag man\nand then there's pepe with tears in his\neyes and then there's pepe crying\nlike you could do this so i i think it's\nit's interesting that you say everything\nis cac w i don't think everything is\nkeck i don't even know what keck w means\nbut but like you know i i definitely\nthink we are developing our own\nvocabulary\nyeah honestly yeah and even like you\nknow the fish\nlike i love the fish you know the fish\nemote the fish emote you mean um\nwhat was it called which one it's the\none\nyeah yeah yeah yeah right so there's\nthere's ooh\nand there's pog and there's pog champ so\nlike in the pog\nwedge of the feeling wheel there's\npoggers pog champ\nyou know i don't know what the other\nones are\nyeah it's becoming a real problem\nactually like twitch talk\nlike even even sheesh do you know sheesh\nno is that a person or a\nthing okay i'll do it once for you okay\nare you ready\nyeah shush\nis that a mating call or what what is it\nyou know it could be very well be\nlike a mating call because actually i\nhave a story from today\ni went to the gym and i was done working\nout and\ni went to the locker room right i was\njust showering and then a bunch of dudes\ncame in right\nuh and they were like changing and i\noverheard the conversation i may not be\nready for this\nno no one guy one guy was like yo i've\nbeen like doing intermittent fasting i\nwas like\nand and the other guy was like oh what\nfor and then the other guy was like yeah\ni'm cutting right now and the other guy\nsaid uh and then i actually had\nlike i was like in the shower room and i\nhad like\nmy first instinct when i heard that was\nthe sheet with that guy\nit's actually becoming a problem wait so\nwhy didn't you though\nbecause it would make things awkward\nyeah but that's like actually\ngo for it june next time i'll i'll shish\nwith him yes okay\nyes you got to put yourself out there\nright you you gotta like let that pog\nchamp within you\nout oh my god\nright like the the\nscared it's okay to be scared\nit's okay to be scared but don't let\nthat stop you\nnext time i will i will sheesh from the\nshower room yeah she\nsheesh from the shower that's that's\nthat's my concrete advice to you at the\nend of the conversation\nso i don't know what you were planning\non getting from this but what we're\ngoing to end up with is shishing from\nthe shower room\ni'm going to choose from the shower room\nnext time thank you very much\num any questions june i mean because i i\ndo feel like we're at sort of like a\ngood stopping point but i i don't know\nif\ni don't know how you feel about that or\nno i think this is really good\nuh honestly i really love talking with\nlike super intelligent people like you\nbecause i think it gives me\na lot of insight i\nlike at the beginning of our\nconversation\nhonestly i didn't even know what to say\nbecause i wasn't really sure how to\ndescribe anything\nbut then i feel like i got a lot of\ninsight um\nyeah gave me a lot of hope so i i\nappreciate your positive sentiment and\nyour\nyour gratitude for the conversation and\ni still feel like i gotta bounce that\nback a little bit and\nremind you that it takes two to tango\nso i know that you appreciate i i just\ndrive this point home\nwhich is like what is your contribution\nto the conversation\nbecause what i'm hearing is you call me\nsuper intelligent and you being ignorant\nno no no no no i just no that was not\nlike uh\nokay right because you said but i i just\nwant to reflect back to you that i enjoy\nthese conversations too\njune and it's because i recognize that\nthere may be some things that you don't\nunderstand but i think you actually did\nan amazing job\nbecause the problem is that like i swim\nin these waters all the time\nit's my day job whereas like we're\nqueuing up\nright and like this is like i grind\nevery single day\nand like we're queuing up together\nand and you're you know you're holding\nyour own in lane\nlike that's the way we win\nright so i think it's really awesome\nlike i think this conversation is a good\nexample\nof like you know you putting yourself\nout there feeling awkward i'm sure\num and then really like i i'm really\nlike i'm i think you did a fantastic job\nthank you cool\num do you sometimes i teach people how\nto meditate\ndo you oh\ni i actually love meditating but i\nhaven't done it in a while\nokay coincidentally ever since i started\nrest\nlike can i tell you a story about like\nthe first time i tried meditating yes\nplease\nso i think i was like 13\nand i was just like laying down in my\nbed and then\non my youtube recommendations i got a\nthis guided meditation thing and this\nguy had like a super deep voice and i\nwas like oh my god\nso i like put my earphones on and then i\ndid this guided meditation thing\nand then i was like listening to this\nguy's like beautiful voice\nand he puts me into like a stance and\nthen\ni literally felt like i was in the\nmiddle of space\nit was like super cool but i haven't\nbeen able to replicate it since no\nmatter how hard i tried\nokay so you\nyou felt this a a sensation of vastness\nyeah i was just like floating in like\nmiddle of nothing\nyeah it felt like that so cool are you\nsitting up or\nwhat right now uh i can i can\ni can lay down on my chair let me just\nthink about how to teach this to you\nso this is going to be a little bit more\nof a of an\nadvanced technique but it's actually\nrelatively simple\nyour back should be straight and if\nyou've done this lying down\ni think you can try doing it lying down\nagain\ni think this is gonna take practice i\ndon't know if it's gonna work right now\nbecause i think that you need a certain\ndegree of like calmness\nand i think actually like we're\nenergized right now is what i'm feeling\njune\nbut i'm happy to share the technique\nwith you that you can try to practice\nokay so um the technique is very simple\nand we can kind of try to do it together\nso you can lay down if you want to but\ni'm going to go ahead and sit up\nstraight\nthe main thing for meditation is that\nyour back needs to be straight\nso you can do that laying down standing\nup sitting up straight\nis there a reason for that yes\num so what it's not there isn't a\nscientific reason\num i'm sure there's a scientific reason\ni don't know what the scientific reason\nis i should say that\nbut in the sort of eastern systems\nof like you know energy and qi and and\nall that stuff\nthe energy of like spiritual growth is\nsituated along your spine\nlives at the base of your spine and as\nthat energy\nrises along the back of your spine you\nstart to have more spiritual experiences\nand spiritual growth\nso there's no scientific correlate to\nthis energy like no one's been able to\nfind it or detect it\nor anything like that but essentially\nlike\napparently the spine according to these\ntheories like the people who developed\nthe practice of meditation\nthis is what they said is that you want\nto facilitate\nlike it's like a pipe that you know\nwater flows through and it starts at the\nbottom and then it works its way up\ndoes that answer your question and offer\nyeah that's okay very interesting\nso it's gonna be kind of weird but what\ni'm gonna ask you to do it's hard to\ndemonstrate i'm gonna ask you to close\nyour eyes\nand then there's a point that's sort of\nlike maybe right above\nyour the middle of your eyebrows i don't\nknow if you can kind of tell it's like\nnot you know it's it's maybe like a\nquarter inch or a few centimeters above\nthe middle or you can kind of find it\nfor some people it feels a little bit\nhigher but what i want you to do is\nclose your eyes\nand then i want you to look at that\npoint\nso i know it sounds kind of weird but\nand then you're gonna never done\ni think that's the first time i've ever\ndone that in my life\nso i want you to you can lay down or sit\nup straight and then i want you to just\nlook at that and just keep focusing on\nthat point\nas if you're trying to like look through\nit with your eyes\nlike imagine that your eyes are behind\nyour forehead it's hard to describe\nbecause these things are so experiential\nbut like imagine your eyes are behind\nyour forehead and you're trying to look\nthrough like that point in your forehead\nis like a telescope\nand so you're like looking through that\npoint into something else\ndoes that make sense yep\nokay so this may cause some amount of\neye strain\nwhich then you want to relax once it\nstarts to feel uncomfortable\nand then you want to resume again once\nyour eyes have calmed down\nyou don't want to push yourself or hold\nit for a long period of time\nbut gradually over time you want to\nbuild up the strength and focusing on\nthat point\nyou may also learn that at some point\nyou can actually relax your\neyes and focus on the point anyway which\nis totally fine\ndoes that make sense that makes sense\nokay so let's try to practice for like\nthree or four minutes okay\nso you can try to hold it for maybe 10\nseconds 15 seconds 30 seconds\nrelax for a little bit hold again relax\ndon't strain your eyes too much okay\nso let's begin\nyou\nforeign\nokay go ahead and relax let your eyes\nremain closed\ngo ahead and take a deep breath in and\nexhale slowly\nyou can go ahead and rub your eyes a\nlittle bit\nokay and then go ahead and open them\nwhat what was that like for you jun\ni didn't get to the state i was talking\nabout\nbut it is really relaxing okay\nyeah so you could try practicing this um\ndid you feel like\ndizzy at all no but i did i did see the\ni did feel the eye strain are you\ntalking about yeah sometimes like i'm\nlike trying so hard to like look\nup and then like naturally gradually\ngoes down\nso i have to like do it again yeah so\nso it may take a little bit of practice\nyou know this may not be the right\ntechnique for you\num i i tend to find that\nsome people will sometimes feel dizzy\nand then i know it's not like this is\ngonna\nprobably not gonna make any sense but as\nthe dizziness kind of like expands\nthis is a technique that i consistently\nhear from people when i teach it\nthat it gives them the feeling of what i\ncall vastness\nwhich is that they like that i know it\nsounds kind of weird\nlike you feel dizzy and then it like\nkind of like\nsounds so bizarre but it kind of like\ngrows and grows\nand then like a lot of people that i\nteach this technique will sort of\nshare that experience with me that's\nkind of what i experienced\nback then yeah so so one thing i would\nsay june is that\none of the things that gets in the way\nof meditation or experiences in\nmeditation is seeking experiences in\nmeditation\nso when our mind is calm and tranquil\nand we don't have\nexpectation then it can truly shut off\nand\nopen ourselves up to whatever experience\nwe can have\nthe challenge is that if you go into a\npractice\nseeking something that very expectation\nwill prevent your mind from relaxing\nso i i would say you know just do\nmeditation without\nsort of thinking about that or try to\nlet go of that expectation\nlike learn to let go of your goal which\ni think is also very healthy for you in\ngeneral\n[Laughter]\nbut always finds a way to tie it\ntogether\nyeah maybe that's just me looking you\nmeditate\ndo i meditate every day\ni'm gonna go with no\nso i i tend to have much more intensive\nperiods of meditation\nand then i do lots of different kinds of\nmeditation but i also think that like\nwhere i am in life right now\nit is important for me to not meditate\nevery day and just like let that go\nyou know you have like a cheat day in\nterms of diet or like you'll take a week\noff from going to the gym\nso i think meditation is sort of the\nsame way\nwhere i tend to meditate a fair amount\nbut i let go of the everyday\nthing a long time ago where\nit's like you know that at this point\nfeels a little bit artificial to me so\nwhat i will do is like\nembark on sprints essentially of\nmeditation\nand then i'll do a particular practice\nin depth for a particular amount of time\nand then i'll also let my practice wane\ndo you ever like think about stuff while\nmeditating or do you try to keep your\nmind empty\nyou can't keep your mind empty your mind\nhas to\nnaturally empty and i'm usually\npretty good at not thinking about things\nwhen i meditate but that just comes with\npractice\nso the way that meditation works june is\nyou don't\nstop thinking about stuff so your body\nand mind have a very simple principle\nof like tolerance to a constant stimuli\nso if i put on my shirt first thing in\nthe morning or after i shower\ni'm gonna feel the shirt on my body\nright\nand then the sensation of the shirt\nstops\ndoes that make sense yeah\nand then if i concentrate on feeling the\nshirt\ni will ign like my mind will stop\nfeeling\nall other things does that make sense\nthat doesn't make too much sense we're\ngonna illustrate it really simply\ni want you to do this with your hands\nokay now i want you to concentrate on\nthe sensation of your hands can you feel\nyour hands\nare you wearing a shirt yes\nnow i want you to concentrate on the\nfeeling of the shirt\nas you focus on the shirt what happens\nto the sensation of your hands\nuh you forget about him absolutely\nright so in the same way our mind has\nlots of thoughts\nand so what we do in meditation is we\nactually start with a focusing technique\nlike focusing on the breath and when i\nput my attention on the breath\nthe breath knocks out all of the other\nthoughts but we're still thinking about\nthe breath\ndoes that make sense then what happens\nis eventually our mind\nstop acclimatizes to the sensation of\nthe breath\nand if we're lucky we're left in a no\nmind state\nwow that sounds awesome okay\ni don't know i don't know if i can get\nto that point\nmy mind races all the time sure sounds\nlike you may not be good enough\ni'll try it actually i'll try for a week\nthere we go\nright so it just takes practice june\nyou'll get there\nall minds are capable of it and\nsometimes if you like work out\nor dance that may actually be like your\navenue because like\nyou know sometimes when you dance or you\nsing or you work out\nyou're like one with the practice\ndoes that make sense like you lose\nyourself in the dancing and all\nall you are is like a dancing elemental\nlike you become an elemental if that\nmakes sense\nyeah like you're no longer june you're\njust like someone who is dancing\nso that can be a form of meditation yeah\nso you\nyou've done it so you may just be\nsomeone it sounds like you're quite\nkinesthetic\nby nature kinesthetic meaning being like\nyou have a good like\nsense of your body so what you may\nactually want to do is not\nsitting down meditation something like\nyoga or tai chi may work way\nbetter for you like a very solid like\nhata yoga have you ever done like hot\nyoga\nno i never tried hot yoga so\ni would say like hot yoga is like a good\nthing for you to try i mean cove it\naside because i don't know\nthat's probably awful with a mask on but\nyou know i'd say\nin your case just i don't know that you\nneed to sit and do like a quiet sitting\nmeditation\npractice you may be someone who just\nreally gets to that clear state of mind\nand that feels so good through physical\nthrough a physical focus\nas opposed to a breath focus or a mantra\nor something like that\n[Music]\ni might try it there's a lot of things\nthat i used to\nhave like used to do that gave me that\nsatisfaction\nthat i was talking about but i stopped\ndoing them\nfor whatever reason sure so and i think\nif i do that more\npick it up again should pick it up again\nyeah\ncool you want to just tell us june where\nwe can find you before um we wrap\nup for the day uh where you can find me\nuh just on twitch
