    "transcript": "when you guys have a problem and you\nkind of find the middle of it\nright like you find that core and you\ndiscover it and start working on it all\nthe other crap will come crumbling down\nit's just how it works i feel like i\nhave no personality and i am hollow\ni feel afraid of talking to people in\nreality or online i feel like i'm too\nboring for them and have nothing\nof value to offer sometimes i muster up\nthe courage to message people or respond\nto their messages\nbut then i end up ghosting them for\nweeks just because i don't want to end\nup having a conversation\nwith them and them realizing i am boring\nand then stopping\ntalking to me i feel like i will end up\nalone\neven if i do or don't want to talk to\npeople because if i do\nthey will realize i have no substance as\na person or that i\ni'm just uninteresting or unfunny if i\ndon't then i will just be alone\nin the end because i never talk to\nanyone\ni do have a few close friends and i talk\nto them regularly\nbut they're just too close to realize\nthat i'm like this they tell me that i'm\ninteresting and funny but i think\nonly they find me that way it's like\nwhen your mom tells you you're good\nlooking\nwhen you know you aren't i think the\npeople i've been avoiding\ntalking to are really cool and would be\nreally great friends but i just don't\nthink i'm on their level as a person\nhow do i overcome this fear of rejection\ngreat question\nokay so hold on chat\ndr k needs to think for a second okay so\nfirst thing that we're going to do chat\nis we're going to map out i'm going to\njust show let me just do this with y'all\nso i'm going to map out what this\nperson's mind looks like\ni'm going to share with you all how i\nunderstand the mind of this person\nand i want to show you guys if you can\nrelate to this how to understand your\nmind okay\nwhat i'm going to ask you all to do is\ngo ahead and just\nopen up the reddit post on a side window\nbecause i'm gonna have it here i'm gonna\ngo through line by line\nand i'm gonna show you guys sort of how\nthis mind works okay\nokay so let's start with this so the\nfirst thing to understand\nis that these are the core beliefs i am\ntoo boring\nsorry guys i am actually a medical\ndoctor which means that my handwriting\nis terrible\num i'm not valuable right and so then\nsometimes what this person actually does\nis builds up courage and then reaches\nout\nand then over time they'll end up\nghosting okay i don't want to end up\nhaving a conversation with them\nand them realizing they\nwill realize okay\nso what this means they will realize\nthat i'm not valuable so\nyou're pretending\nor being an imposter okay so there's a\ntouch of that you'll see that\ni need to talk\nto other people or i\nwill be alone\nso what i'm sort of noticing here\nis that there's like a war between these\ntwo parts\nof the mind you guys see that so like\nsometimes like this part wins\nand then sometimes this part wins this\npart usually ends up winning\nokay so then they will realize my\nclose friends are\ntoo close to realize\nso that's why this isn't this is i'm\ngonna put like a green arrow here\nbecause\nokay so we're gonna have our realization\noriented stuff this way i know this is\nlike this is why i wanted to think for a\nsecond because i don't know exactly\nwhere i'm going with this but\nokay so this is the mom example okay\nand then i think i have been avoiding\ntalking to\nare really cool and could be really\ngreat friends but i\njust don't think i'm on their level as a\nperson\ni'm not valuable so let's look at this\nmind\nso this over here is the sum squad\ndo you guys see how like everything here\nthat we're talking about\nrevolves around this complex\nas long as this is here the rest of the\nstuff\nwill actually just you know everything\nhere\nall of this stuff will continue to\npersist\nso let's look at their current pattern\nof behavior so they start here\nthey build up the courage okay they\nreach out\nand then the courage goes away they lose\nthe courage and then they end up\nghosting\nso there's almost like there's a\nso really what it is is courage\nversus ghosting\nokay and so this is a balance and on a\ngiven day they can use willpower\nto bolster courage right they can ignore\nall of these thoughts and then what's\ngoing to happen\nis courage will be greater than the\ntendency to ghost and disappear\nand then but the problem is that\nwillpower is not sustainable so over\ntime the willpower will decrease\nwill cross this threshold and then\nyou'll ghost\nand once you ghost you're gonna feel bad\nand then as you feel bad you're gonna\nreinforce this\ny'all with me because now you feel\nguilty you're like oh my god\ni'm so pathetic i can't even i can't\neven\nyou know like i can't even like text\npeople back oh my god\nand so this thing then gets stronger it\nlevels up\ny'all see that this cycle gg noobs\nokay so now let's now these\nare rationalizations they will realize\nright like i can only put on a mask for\nso long\nand this doesn't even make any sense\nrationally my close friends are too\nclose to realize how pathetic i am no\ndude it's the opposite\nright the closer someone is to you the\nmore they get your authentic self\nso if you're close friends really\nlogically if your close friends\nlike you they're closer to the real you\nthat's not usually the mask\nbut if i were to say that to this person\nthey would argue with me until they were\nblue in the face like i wouldn't get\nanywhere\nbut do y'all see chat how these are\nrationalizations\nthey're fears it doesn't make any sense\nso this is like when your mind tells you\nall kinds of stuff like don't bother\nit's a waste of time no point\nin trying to hang out if\nthey are going to\nyou ready for a chat here's the climax\nfind\nout eventually that's what the mind\ntells you right\nthese are all the rationalizations these\nare the responses\nof your mind this is what it tells you\nto protect against rejection\nbecause what this person is trying to\navoid is this cycle\nright if i never reach out in the first\nplace\nbecause every time i reach out i'm going\nto end up ghosting then i'm going to\nfeel bad and this is going to get worse\nso this is what you have to understand\nreaching out just makes you feel bad\nand that's why we don't do it you guys\nsee that\nso then the mind says hey buddy the mind\nis smart this is a smart person right\nso these thoughts come over here and\nthey're like hey wait a minute\nthis is bad every time we reach out\nwe end up over here and we feel worse\nabout ourselves\nso don't bother stop doing it stop doing\nit\nand then this is the last part so this\nis like the the warring part right\nwe go over here which is like i need\npeople this isn't healthy\nso the first thing to understand is that\nyou can tackle\nany of these but i'd say that you can\ntackle the\nthe cognitions and defense mechanisms if\nyou want to you can tackle this cycle if\nyou want to but i think this is where it\nstarts\nand if this if you can cross this out\nyou can cross this out everything else\nis going to come crumbling down\nthis is going to come crumbling down\nthis is going to come crumbling down\nthis is going to come crumbling out\nit'll all just\nall come crumbling down okay so there's\none question that i have for you\nif this person is watching or anyone who\nrelates to this\nis where did you learn that you're not\nvaluable\nbecause as long as that belief is held\nall this crap is going to persist\ndo you all get that like you guys see\nhow like as we draw it out like you can\nargue with the rationalizations\nand the problem that people run into\nwith these things\nis that they'll deal with any one of\nthose things right so if you you go to\nsomeone you're like\nhow do i stop ghosting people and it's\nlike that is\nsuch a weird adaptation of an adaptation\nof an adaptation it's so far from the\nroot\nlike you can work on that and it is\nvaluable right so what we want to do is\nwe want to approach it from both ends\nwe want to approach it like in the\nmoment in symptomatic relief and root\ncause relief\nbut i would start with this is where did\nyou learn\nthat all these other people are better\nthan you because you can even see it\nokay it's it's subtle i mean actually\nit's not subtle what am i saying\nit's brightest day could be really great\nfriends but\ni just don't think i'm on their level as\na person\nwhy not when did you stop being on their\nlevel as a person\nwhat level are you on how did you get on\nthat level why are they on a different\nlevel\nright and so you can go back to like you\nknow this is we see the ahm god\nyou guys see the sense of self the\nidentity the identity\nis like i'm a bad person and then\neverything that we talked about in terms\nof like the non-traditional narcissism\nactually applies here too\nright because they idealize all of their\nfriends because their ahamkar is active\nso you look up to everyone oh my god\neveryone's so awesome oh my god\nso where does that come from and as you\nstart to dismantle that belief\nokay we i saw an interesting post from\num a week ago\nso i'll show you guys what this so my\nsurprising experience with coaching\num so they've been in the self\nimprovement online world with books and\nall this for years\nso like my first session started out\nwith some overviews and just thinking in\nthe basics of what coaching is\nsecond session i was actually planning\non cutting things short i\nreally felt like i had a lot of\nself-awareness from therapy and\nself-improvement stuff\ni know i have self-value problems i know\ni have anxiety about work\nwhen i clicked the call button on\ndiscord to have my second session i had\na mental\ni made a mental note to mention to my\ncoach that i was considering ending\nafter the session\ni never planned on breaking down about\n20 minutes later with emotion there was\nsuch an intense some scar that i\nalways felt there but and had never\naccessed\nin the way that i had my coach asking my\ncoach was asking me seemingly basic\nquestions and reflecting\nback to me the things i said i was so\nsure initially that i knew\nmore about myself than anyone could and\nit was a waste of time to do coaching\num i identified the sum scar and where\nit came from and\nblah blah blah okay and so you all can\nread the rest of the post i think i\ni just highlight this to illustrate a\ncouple of things the first is that\nthis is how a sum scar works okay blah\nblah blah they got better\nsure and so the the key thing though is\nthat like\nonce you hit it and it's kind of hard to\ndescribe but like\nonce you find it like stuff starts\ncrumbling down yeah let me drop the link\nsorry i i didn't mean\ni just realized you know i just felt\nsomething i felt\nlike it was arrogant to show something\nabout a success story from like our\nprogram\nso i felt like it was that was my own\nego actually getting in the way it\nhappened quick\nand so i felt embarrassed to share how\nthis person had made progress which is\nsilly\nyeah so exactly so osterholtz is saying\ncoaching it just works hashtag ad that's\nactually exactly what i was trying to\navoid which is why i didn't read the\nrest of the post\nyou guys see that it's interesting like\ni just got my ego\nhappened so i didn't want to share\nbecause i didn't want it to come across\ni was thinking about what y'all were\nthinking about\nand i was like oh i don't want these\npeople to perceive me as a narcissist so\ni have to stop reading this success\nstory\nright so it happens quick the couple of\nkey points though is that when you guys\nhave a problem\nand you kind of find the middle of it\nright like you find that core and you\ndiscover it and start working on it all\nthe other crap will come crumbling down\nit's just how it works now a couple\nthings to remember\nso this this sounds like a wonderful ad\nfor coaching which i actually need to\ngive you guys a big caveat about\nthis person is like oh my god i was not\nexpecting this this coach was\nbrilliant i can guarantee you every\ncoach out there who's watching the\nstream\nis currently terrified because they're\nlike\ni don't know if i can do that are people\ngonna be expecting this emotional\ncatharsis\nafter two sessions like i can't do that\nbecause they can't do that\nthis is where i want you guys to\nremember that this person has been doing\nself-improvement work\nand therapy and stuff for years so i\nthink it was right under the surface\nright it was ready to come out and so i\ndon't think the coach was i'm sure the\ncoach was great\nlike they probably did a good job and at\nthe same time\nyou have to be careful about your\nexpectations because this person i think\nwas like\nit's like right underneath the surface\nso it'll come out relatively easily they\nwere ready for it\nright so our coaches do a fantastic job\ndon't get me wrong\nand at the same time i would be really\nreally careful about not expecting this\nso just show up try to do the best that\nyou can\nyour coach is going to show up and try\nto do the best that you can we have a\nbig policy here at hell it's not really\na policy it's like a\nethos that you know we just show up and\nwe do the best that we can on a given\nday\nthat's our dharma our dharma is to show\ni'm going to show up on stream\ni'm going to talk is i'm going to try to\nhelp as much peop as many people as i\ncan in two hours\nand that's what we're going to do maybe\ny'all will like it\nmaybe you won't am i going to have the\nanswers i don't really know\nwe're just going to show up and we're\ngoing to give it everything we've got\nand that's kind of and that's what i\nencourage you all to do as well just\nshow up and give it everything you've\ngot"
