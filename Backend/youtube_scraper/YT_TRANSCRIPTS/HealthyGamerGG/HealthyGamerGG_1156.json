    "transcript": "you have a muscle that you can use to\nhave your penis flop up and down you all\nknow what i'm talking about\npenis-flopping muscle\nyeah so this is a meditation someone\nsomeone's asking a meditation that helps\nwith no fat this is this will do that\nokay\nso what i'm going to teach y'all is a\nmulat chakra meditation\nso the muladhara chakra is the root\nchakra and remember that in the like the\nkundalini system\nthere's this idea that we have these\nseven major chakras which are like\nenergy hubs\nand that each chakra governs a\nparticular like attribute hormonal\npsychological spiritual whatever\nso for example um\n[Music]\ni do third eye or agna chakra\nmeditations i've been doing them for\nabout 17 years i have like a consistent\npractice that i do and i believe it\nhelps me become a good psychiatrist so\nmy intuition so the agna chakra governs\nintuition and understanding so my\nintuition is pretty good and i lean on\nthat pretty heavily when i'm talking to\nother human beings now do i think that\nthis is some kind of like mystical like\nlife hack or like spiritual hack\nuniverse kind of stuff maybe i don't\nreally know but i think that what's\nplausible and we have good evidence of\nthis is that different meditation\ntechniques\nactually create different changes in the\nbrain so we know that different\nmeditation techniques will have\ndifferent eeg\nreadings so the electrical activity\nis actually specific to the kind of\nmeditation technique that you do we also\nhave functional mri studies which looks\nat blood flow to the brain and we know\nfrom those studies that doing different\nkinds of techniques will actually send\nblood flow to different parts of our\nbrain\nso my understanding as a scientist\nis that essentially what people sort of\nfigured out is that like if you meditate\nin a particular way it probably\nstimulates a particular part of your\nbrain and\nin some way so that's the best example\nthat's the best scientific hypothesis i\ncan come up with there actually is not\nany evidence to that it's just\na hypothesis okay\nso that being said we'll talk about i'll\ngive you guys just a couple of examples\nso we do third eye practices like\ncharging the laser beam and then if you\nguys have emotional digestion issues you\ncan do money board practices navel\nchakra or agni oriented practices agni\nis our metabolic fire so it takes things\nit digests stuff\nso for people who are who have trauma\nand are trying to like digest their\ntrauma and move on i'll teach them navel\nchakra or manipura chakra practices and\nthey seem to work really well i will not\nteach them mindfulness mindfulness bad\nidea for people with trauma and so now\nwhat i'm going to teach you guys is some\nmuladhara root chakra practices\nand the goal of these practices is that\nthe root chakra governs our impulsive\nbehavior and our animalistic instincts\nit also um\ngoverns like sexual impulsive like\nsexual behavior and lustful thoughts\nso we do know uh actually like so\nthere's actually good evidence of what\ni'm about to share this is not what i\nwould recommend there's a particular\nasan or or posture that i like to call\nthe nut buster asan\nwhich is one where you press your heel\ninto the space between your so you sit\ncross-legged but you kind of press your\nheel\ninto the space between your scrotum and\nyour anus the taint and the interesting\nthing is that you meditate in that\nposture and what that's supposed to do\nis like\ntake care of your muladhara chakra so\nthere's an interesting physiologic\nreason for that is that the blood supply\nto your gonads if you're male\nis actually goes through the taint so\nit's kind of like in the bottom so when\nyou press your heel there and you sit in\nthat posture what it actually probably\ndoes physiologically is com restricts\nthe blood flow to your your testes and\nthen reduces\nlike it's almost like a temporary slight\nlike castration kind of effect right so\nthese are practices that you should\nabsolutely not do i'm just using it to\nillustrate that there is some\nphysiologic evidence\nthat these kinds of practices do appear\nto affect like lustfulness right so\nthat's not the one that we're gonna do\nself vasectomy absolutely not vasectomy\nis a completely different part of the\nbody\ncompletely different\nso there does seem to be some\nphysiologic evidence to support the\ntheories that the yogis did so we're not\ngonna do that when i don't recommend it\nso instead of what we're gonna do is a\nvery simple one which is uh essentially\nit's gonna be hard to describe but\nif you're a man\nyou have a muscle that you can use to\nhave your penis flop up and down you all\nknow what i'm talking about\npenis-flopping muscle\nokay\nyep\nso kegels pelvic floor exercises for\nwomen\nso what we're going to do is just\nflex that muscle so what we're going to\ndo is breathe in and kind of flex it\ncontract hold\nand then relax\nokay so we'll do rounds of that kegels\nso what you'll also notice is that it's\nusually combined with the same muscle\nthat contracts the anus so you'll sort\nof notice a universal tightening there\num and then the uh the muscle is also\nused to prevent or stop the flow of\nurine once it flows\nokay\ni know look chat so this is i know that\nthings are mimicked you guys understand\nthat like we're actually trying to teach\ny'all something right like\nlike i i don't know how else to say this\ni'm not trying to be obscene and if you\nknow if we get banned for this i'll\nlearn my lesson but\nlike\nlike so i'm a medical doctor and one of\nthe things that you learn as a medical\ndoctor is like we have a human body\nright and like the penis vagina scrotum\nare all\nparts of our body\nthey're just parts of our body just like\nour fingers and toes and eyes and nose\nand so there are practices that involve\nthose parts of body just like our\nstomach and like we don't have to be\nlike you know kindergarteners but\npenis\ni mean i i sort of i mean i personally\nfind it funny too so i get where you all\nare coming from but like let's try to do\nthe practice a little bit seriously okay\nso\noh my god what have i done\nchad oh my god\ni just had a realization of what the\nstream has been like\nokay whatever let's just focus\nlet's focus on our penis push-ups chat\nokay so for women there's contraction\nyou can also kind of think a little bit\nabout\nwhat you would do when you are trying to\nstop the flow of urine through your\nurethra and so you'll kind of have\na contraction there\nif you know how to do kegel exercises\nit's basically like the moonlit practice\nso what i tend to find is that\nso if you guys know the muscle we're\ngoing to contract it so we're going to\nbreathe in and we're going to contract\nat the same time\nand what i want you all to kind of\nimagine is like when you contract you'll\nfeel\nit's like you're squeezing like the\nbottom of like you know\nsome like a bag of fluid and then like\nthe fluid is going to go up right so\nwhat i want you guys to imagine is\nyou're sending like the energy you're\ngoing to feel that tension and energy\ndown there you're going to send it up\nokay\nso we're going to breathe in contract\nand then exhale and relax\nbreathe in contract exhale and relax\nbreathe in contract exhale and relax\nokay so we'll go ahead and do nine\nrounds with our eyes closed\nso go ahead and\nclose your eyes\ntake a deep breath in\ncontract\nand exhale\n[Music]\nin\nand relax\nso contract with the exhalation that's\nround two we're gonna do seven more in\ngoing for four\nround five\nnow\nround six\nand out\nround\nseven eight\nand out\nlast round\nnow we're just going to relax\nspend about 60 seconds\nyou can go into a different meditation\npractice if you want to\nor just observe your breath chant a\nmantra charge your laser beam\nyou can do another kind of breathing\npractice if you'd like\nbut take a moment to just notice the\nrelaxation\nof your pelvic and genital area\nwill meditate silently for about 60 to\n90 more seconds\nme\nnow go ahead and\ncome on back\nthat sounds kind of weird but\nin all seriousness maybe\ntrucker practices are what we're going\nto need to protect ourselves from the\nwaifu revolution\nbecause don't get me wrong chat there's\nsomeone out there i was about to use the\nword degenerate\nit was dreaming up how to make the waifu\nexperience more real\nbut instead of degenerate maybe we will\nsay visionary one day\nright because there's something about\nhostess clubs only fans\nwaifu video games virtual reality haptic\nfeedback\nsome of that\nis gonna come together\ngotta be careful"
