    "transcript": "he treats you the way he treats everyone\nelse\nand that can be one of the most\ndevastating things to feel\nif you're in love right it can be so\npainful to be treated\njust like everyone else\nso happy to see others fail okay\nhey everyone i'm posting this on a\nthrowaway hope that's okay totally fine\nso i have this guy in my class whom i\nhave feelings for but he's straight as\nan arrow and i'm a guy\nof course i won't tell him about my\nfeelings but we are very close friends\nand it has become really draining he's\nthe kind of guy who walks into a room of\nstrangers and befriends them all within\nfive minutes\nit has become so bad that i'm actively\navoiding school since he\nalways comes and sits next to me and\nrecently we had\ntests which he bombed thanks to a\nblackout and i was really happy about it\ni don't really know how to feel about it\nbut it feels like he's hurting me by\nsitting next to me\nand i dislike him for it but he doesn't\nknow about it so i can't blame him and\nthat's only adding to the frustration i\nhave towards myself\nbut i don't want to ruin the friendship\nwe have so let's try to understand\nwhere does happiness from seeing others\nfail come from\nokay so where does delight in another\nhuman being's suffering come from\nso this is actually turns out to be\nsomewhat simpler than than you may\nexpect\nokay no it's not envy it's not\ninsecurity\nit's not jealousy what is the root of\nall that stuff\nwho do you want to hurt it's the people\nwho are you\nit's that simple right so if we look at\nsome of these things like if you look at\nlike toxicity right like where does\ntoxicity\nin its most fundamental form come from\nit comes from like hurt\nso like we have this circuit in our\nbrain\nright i don't know exactly what circuit\nit is but i'm sure it's there because\nit's conserved across the human race\nwhere if you hurt me i want to hurt you\nthat's how we respond right so like\nwe've evolved because like\nif you look at like you know animals\nfighting over territory it's like we're\ngonna like if you're gonna cross into\nwhat's mine\ni'm gonna repel you and we're gonna\nfight we're gonna joust we're gonna\ndo whatever so human beings have like\nthis retaliatory mechanism and so like\nthat was\none thing when we were like animals\nfighting over territory but now human\nbeings\nit's changed like what is territory what\nyou know what is hurt\nwhat are we entitled to what's mine\nwhat's yours\nand so what i've what i've seen working\nwith a lot of people who are like\nvery angry at like other people so i've\nworked with a fair number of in cells at\nthis point so that i think they fall\nkind of in this category\nright where a lot of them like they have\na lot of hatred and it's not just in\ncells i\nwork with people who have like strong\npolitical beliefs\nand what i tend to find is that like\nwhen someone with strong political\nbeliefs\nhas hatred towards something else a\ncertain amount of it is like\nconditioning and\nindoctrination and then like a certain\namount of it is like hurt\nright and and we'll see this like kind\nof all over the place where\ngenerally speaking in my experience\npeople who delight in the suffering\nof others are usually\npeople who have been hurt themselves\nright even if you like look at movies\nlike if you look at a movie where you\nknow\nthere's justice in the end and boy does\nit feel good when the hero\nbeats the bully right and like the\nbully's like humiliated\nlike it feels so good like why do you\nthink it feels good\nuniversal like why do movies like that\nsucceed it's because we can empathize\nwith that character we know what it's\nlike to be hurt by someone\nand we know how good it feels to like\nhurt them back\nto win sometimes we call this justice\nright so like we have a word for that\nbut i'd say even deeper than that\nis like a sense of like you know justice\nkarma but like if you hurt if i get hurt\nby you i want to hurt you and we see\nthis a lot in relationships too\nright like when one partner let's say\nlike is unfaithful to the other\nlike to make it even like i want to make\nyou feel the way that i feel it doesn't\nhave to be with a lack of faith it can\nbe like any kinds of other things\nif i feel emotionally neglected i'm\ngonna like act out\nand make you feel bad too so human\nbeings in general so i choose to believe\nthis there's certainly people who are\nyou know a little bit more on the\nsociopathic side\nconditioning there are all kinds of\nother reasons why human beings hate\nother human beings\nit's not exclusive to this but generally\nspeaking i'm a psychiatrist and my\ni work with a sample size of like one\nperson at a time so what i've seen\nin eighty percent of cases if not more\nis that most people who are angry and\nfeel satisfied\nwhen they see someone else get hurt it's\ncoming from they themselves being hurt\nright because like if you think about it\nyou know when you see someone get hurt\nour usual reaction is like compassion\nand empathy\nso what gets in the way of our usual\nreaction it's us being hurt ourselves\nand so how do you what do you do about\nthis i'd say the first thing is to kind\nof acknowledge right that this person\nhas like hurt you in a lot of ways\nand i don't know if you sort of\nrecognize that and you may have trouble\nadmitting that someone has hurt you if\nthey've done it unintentionally\nright if the person doesn't know that\nthey're hurting you you don't want to\nblame them for it like it's fair to say\nit's not really their fault\nbut it also still causes damage right\nlike if i'm like\nif i'm walking around and i've got like\nyou know i'm\ni'm trying to figure out what what the\nright analogy is but you know i can\ncause\ninadvertent pain to people and it may\nnot be my fault\nbut the pain still exists the hurt still\nexists within you\nand i'd kind of ask yourself you know\nhow do you feel when this person walks\ninto a room and makes tons of friends\nwhat do you feel in that moment\ni know it sounds kind of weird but like\nreally pay attention\nbecause i adventure it's one of a couple\nthings one is that you wish he would\nmake friends with you\nright you wish that the attention that\nother people got that the way that this\nperson was like\nacting so friendly like laughing with\nthat other person like you want to be\nthat other person and you blame him\nfor not letting you be in the other\nperson's shoes\nbecause you it sounds like you've got\nfeelings for him like you want to be the\nrecipient of that\nintention like any time you look across\nthe classroom or whatever\nand you see him like laughing with\nsomeone else and like patting him on the\nback you're like i want that\ni want you to do that with me i want to\nbe part of that interaction\nand so it's it's your yearning for that\nand your inability to be a part of that\nthat probably hurts and then you kind of\nlike\nsubconsciously you blame him right\nyou're kind of like\nwhy don't you do that for me and then\nthere's a lot of other stuff that kind\nof goes into that where like you want to\nbe a part of that interaction maybe you\nenvy him in some way right maybe you\nwere like oh if i was like\nthat friendly and that awesome if i was\nthat likable\nthen people would like me like i'd be\nthe one who walks into the room and then\neveryone would want to be my friend\nand if everyone would want to be my\nfriend maybe someone would be attracted\nto me\nand then maybe i could be with someone\nmaybe if i was as friendly and\nopen as likable as that guy he would\nlike me\nso i think that there's a lot of\ndifferent stuff that could be going on\nhere\nand i think at the end of the day you\nreally have to pay attention if you\nfeel happy when someone else gets\nhurt shot and freud right there's a word\nfor it\num i this doesn't feel to me quite like\nshot and freud but i think there's more\nthere\nmore here but i really think a lot about\nyou know what this\nyou know what you feel like so this\nperson says when this person sits down\nnext to me\num let me find the exact phrase but it\nfeels like he's hurting me\nby sitting next to me so i really try to\nunderstand that i think you've got\nyou know the beginning of the thread and\ni'd follow that throne what's what hurts\nby him sitting next to you what hurts\nbecause it could even be something like\nyou know that\nhe treats you the way he treats everyone\nelse\nand that can be one of the most\ndevastating things to feel\nif you're in love right it can be so\npainful to be treated just like everyone\nelse\nyou know be a little bit compassionate\ntowards yourself be a little bit\nunderstanding towards yourself\nand and really pay attention to like\nwhat is the nature of these feelings\nbring awareness to them\nand as you bring awareness to them\nyou'll be able to start to process\nyou'll be like okay that's what it is\nthat i really do want him to treat me\ndifferently\nand then once you realize that that's\nwhere the heart is coming from you can\nstart\nyou know working on it go see a\ntherapist do some journaling go for long\nwalks\nyou know maybe talk to people on discord\nwork with a coach and i think that's\nwhere you gotta you gotta look at\nyou know are you are you envious of the\npeople that he gives affection to\nare you envious of him do you think that\nif you are more like him he would spend\nmore time with you\nand then the third thing is are you\nreally upset that he does treat you like\neveryone else because you don't treat\nhim like everyone else\nbecause that certainly sounds unfair\nright because you're treating him a\ncertain way in your mind\nbut he's not treating you the same way\nso there's like an imbalance there\nand this is where it gets further\ncomplicated because you can't really\nblame him for that stuff\nif you can't blame him then you feel\nstupid and you feel guilty and you feel\nlike\nif i can't blame him i shouldn't feel\nthis way and so you disregard all of\nyour feelings instead of like accepting\nthem and owning them\ncan this apply to friends too absolutely\ndoesn't have to be love"
