    "transcript": "when i don't deserve something and it\nhappens\nanyway it reprograms\nmy understanding of what is deserved and\nwhat is not deserved\nand then i carry that programming\nthrough life\nwhich is where you carry the identity of\nshame\nwould dr k make a video about shame i've\nrecently come to realize that my social\nanxiety and low self-esteem is rooted\nin a core of feeling of shame and not\nthe circumstances around me i say\nfeeling because\nas much as it is a belief i am bad it's\nalso\nan this overwhelming sensation that\nseems to hijack my life\ni can't remember much about my childhood\nso it is hard to identify if this\nis something that was learned but i felt\nthis way my whole life\ntherapy has been slow but helpful but my\ntherapist\nseems to focus mostly on a cvt driven\napproach\nthe problem with this is that i struggle\nwith an overwhelming emotion sensation\nand not so much a thought\nfeeling shame makes me feel even more\nashamed\nyou know this is why this is why shame\nis the elite mob\nof emotions it's really the best emotion\nthat makes you feel more of the emotion\nand when the shame gets bad enough it\nleads to anger hatred self-sabotage and\ninability to hold relationships that is\nright\num things that i'm curious about how\ncore\nshame becomes implanted in our minds and\nwhat it really is\nif understanding the origins of our\nshame can help us overcome it and if so\nhow\nnotable physiological patterns that\nmight serve as helpful tools to overcome\nshame meditative approaches this has\nbeen a slow grind for me and one of the\nbiggest things that\nkeeps me going is listening to dr k\nbreak down these topics\nokay thank you and take care you are\nvery welcome and thank you for posting\ni think friends it is teaching time can\nyou all hold on a second\ni'd like to blame my children but today\ni have only myself to blame\nso let's talk about shame so you know\ni'll ask i'll say things like\nbecome aware of it notice it notice what\nyou feel see where the hurt is coming\nfrom\nso i want you all to pay attention to\nthis sentence first i've recently come\nto realize that my social anxiety and\nlow self-esteem is rooted in a core\nfeeling of shame\nand not the circumstances around me this\nis a huge step forward okay\nand this is why i think this person is\nalready getting better because they've\ncome to realize\nthat what shame so shame is tricky okay\nso the first thing to understand about\nshame is that it's a tricky tricky\ntricky tricky tricky one the first thing\nwith shame is that shame comes from\nwithin\nbut it's sneaky sneaky one because\nit tricks you into thinking it comes\nfrom outside\nso this is the first thing to understand\nabout shane\nand this actually is the the thing that\nleads to the most stumbling\nbecause if i assume that shame\nis coming from the outside then the\nsolution is on the outside but like so\nlet's say like\nyou know let's say once again like an\nabusive relationship okay so if i'm in\nan abusive relationship with someone\nwho's emotionally abusive and makes me\nfeel ashamed of myself\nwhat i will wind up doing is trying to\nappease that person\nbecause that person kind of controls the\nlever on whether i feel ashamed or don't\nfeel ashamed\nright so then what happens is i wind up\ndoing like all these kinds of appeasing\nbehaviors and then like it just\npropagates\nthe the negative experience okay\nso that's the first thing to understand\nabout shane so if you want to overcome\nshame the first you the first step is to\ntry to figure out you know your mind\nwill be telling you\nyou aren't as smart\ngood competent likable\nlovable etc you take your pick\nright and then what it'll do is it'll\ncite evidence\nto that effect you'll say because oh\nlook at that person\nyou see he got a better you got better\ngrades than you did\nthis person is more likable this person\nis more competent this person is better\nlooking\nso once again as we sort of talked about\nyou know once you have an emotion it\nhijacks\nyour thinking your rational mind and\nthen what happens is it mis-attributes\nit misassigns where the problem lies\nbecause then like if all of these things\nare true on the outside\nthen you really do deserve to be ashamed\nof yourself okay that's the first thing\nto understand about shane\nyou know like where does this come from\nso what shame\nis i know it sounds kind of weird but we\nthink about shame as an emotion right\nso like we think like you know emotions\ninclude shame\nanger you know fear etc\nand so i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut then our approach is like okay how\ndo i stop feeling this emotion whereas\nwe actually don't we can't stop feeling\nan emotion like i know it sounds sort of\nweird but\nthese are just byproducts\nthey're things that our mind produces\ndue to other things which we're going to\nget into so it's sort of like you know\nif i think about how do i deal with fear\ndealing with fear is not i don't want to\ndeal with the emotion i want to deal\nwith like the associations that create\nthe fear\nso let's say i get afraid every time i'm\nin a social situation\nthat fear is the consequence of\nsomething else in my mind right there's\nsomething else so either\nsome scar but in this case the real\nthing is a hum\ngod or ego so i want you to understand\nthat the problem here\nwhen we talk about core shame okay\nbecause even this person describes it as\ncore shame\nit's not just an emotion because\nemotions come and go\ndo you guys get that so like this is\nsomething neuroscience-wise\nemotions equilibriate and this is this\nthis is really sad that they really do\nokay so if we think about we think about\nbridezillas\nright so the bridezilla is like i want\neverything in my wedding to be perfect\nthey want everything they're going to\nspend so much money everyone's going to\nbe perfect\nit's gonna be my perfect day\nso if you create the perfect day and you\ndestroy your relationships and you spend\nso much money\nand everything is perfect how long do\nyou stay happy\nhow long does the happiness last if it\nwas a little bit more perfect\nwould the happiness last 40 years if it\nwas a little bit less perfect would it\nlast 30 years\nso the truth of the matter is that\nemotions equilibriate it's just how our\nbrain is designed\neven major depressive disorder and\ndepressive episodes\ntend to be generally speaking time\nlimited\nso the evidence suggests that even if\nyou're depressed that that depression\nwill go away over time\nokay if you're angry it'll go away over\ntime\nso what where does core shame come from\nso it's not actually an emotion it is\nsomething that\ncontinuously creates or triggers emotion\nthat's the difference and where core\nshame comes from is the ego\nso the ahamkar is continuously creating\nnew shame and so then you ask the\nquestion okay what is the ahamkar what\nis the ego\nit's a sense of identity and as long as\nthis sense of identity persists\nit will continuously\nincrease your shame it's like a shame\ngenerating\nfactory right because the shame is just\nthe emotion like you can the emotion\nwill go away on its own\nif you're someone who's dealing with\ncore shame what you really need to\nunderstand\nis what is the identity structure that\ncreates the shame okay\nso i hope that that makes sense and so\nnow this person is asking how does core\nshame become implanted in our mind what\ni would say becomes implanted as a sense\nof self\nthat is shameful and now we can even see\nso the person sort of says i don't know\nexactly where this comes from but i felt\nthis way my whole life\nso when this person says things like oh\ni i've been feeling this way my whole\nlife like i don't understand\nyou know it's not it's been it's like\nnormal for me and yeah that's because\nit's\nyou carry it around with you constantly\nit's your sense of identity\nso then they have another question so if\nunderstanding the origins of our shame\ncan help us\novercome it and if so how yes absolutely\nso what i would say is that the way that\nthis is going to work for you if you\nwant this to if you want to stop\npersistently feeling ashamed of yourself\nyou have to dig into this identity and\nas long as you\nare someone who is like deserves to be\nashamed of yourself\nthe shame will continue and then what\nyou have to do is remap your identity so\ni'll give you guys just another example\nof this okay something i referenced a\nlittle bit earlier i want y'all\nyou know i'm going to say something\nthat's sort of self-positive but i think\nit\nit illustrates the point so i want you\nguys to think about the person who got\n50 rejections from medical school and\nthen 60 rejections from medical school\nand 70 rejections from medical school\nended up getting into medical school i\nwas really happy right i was a dude who\npersevered\ni overcame my weaknesses i persevered i\nwas like oh man i was so good\nthen i wound up at harvard and then i'd\nreally overcome my weaknesses\ni'd overcome my weaknesses that's who i\nwas that was my identity i was first a\nfailure\nand then i was someone who overcame\nweaknesses and now\ni know it sounds kind of weird but what\nam i what do i want to hang on my wall\ni don't want to hang the diploma from\nharvard i want to hang the failures\nand so now what i've come to realize is\nthat this was never a failure to begin\nwith\nthis is incorrect it's part of who i am\ni am period that's it i am what i\nam i am neither a failure nor successful\ni am neither special nor worthless\ni'm just me and so what i've observed\nwithin myself\nis like an interesting remapping of\nidentity because i know it sounds kind\nof weird but like when you get into\nharvard that's what you want to hang on\nyour res\non your wall right when you get it\nframed you're like man i\ni need when i was looking at my office\nmy ego was like well i hope there's\nenough wall space for all my wonderful\ndiplomas\nbecause this is ego oh look at me\ni am triumphant\nbut you can't triumph unless you failed\nthese two come hand in hand so with my\nidentity of failure\ncomes my identity of triumph and now\nactually what i've done is i've\ncrossed it all out i am that's just\nit i'm neither special nor worthless\nand so what you really need to do if you\nwant to stop this sense of shame\nis to remap your identity so start to\nask yourself like\nwho are you okay like really like who\nare you who have you become who were you\nand really pay attention to like what\ncomes up there\nand so then the last kind of question\nthat they've got is are there particular\nphysiological patterns\nthat might serve as helpful tools to\novercome shame absolutely we'll talk\nabout that in a second\nand meditative approaches okay so now\nif we're talking about overcoming shame\nthere's two elements\nwe got to take a two-pronged approach\none is\nidentity and the second is emotion\nbecause remember even if we have the\nidentity it's still you're still feeling\nashamed in the moment and that makes it\nhard to do things right\nso we still gotta deal with that so\nwe're gonna deal with this one first\nbreath\nthere's other stuff you can do but let's\nstart with this so when you experience\nan emotion\nyour pattern of breathing alters as a\nresult\nand when you breathe a particular way it\nalters your emotions\nthis is scientific fact we kind of know\nthis now\nokay i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike it's actually what happens\nso i don't know if you all realize this\nbut in\nscientific experiments when they are\ntesting anxiety if you're looking at a\ntreatment for anxiety\nthe way that you reproduce anxiety\nin a laboratory right so if i'm testing\nlet's say a medication for anxiety\nwhat i need is a lab full of like\nanxious people\nso how do i create all of these people\nand how do i induce anxiety in the\nmoment\nwhat i do is increase the co2\nconcentration\nthat they inhale this literally is the\nscientific\nstandard for creating anxiety in another\nhuman being for research purposes\nso you give them a gas mask that has a\nhigher level of co2 concentration\nit's it's wild that's like literally\nwhat you do i hope it's\nincrease maybe it's decreased i know\nit's 7.5 percent can someone check\nwhether atmospheric if that's lower that\nor higher than atmospheric concentration\ni'm pretty sure it's 7.5\nco2 and so it's interesting because you\ncan literally induce an emotion by\naltering\nthe co2 and oxygen concentration of what\nyou breathe\nso breathe so i guess that shame has a\nrelatively\ndeep and rapid breathing pattern okay\ni'm not so sure that it's actually\nshallow but if you alter your breath\nyour mind will change with it\nso what i would recommend is nari shuddi\nthat's our go-to and it's a go-to for a\nreason\nif you want to do something a little bit\nstronger you can do ohm chanting\nand just chant the shame out right\njust let it out and you can be like oh\nmy god that's so embarrassing\ni'd feel like an idiot yes exactly and\njust chant through it\nwe'll practice that today okay so that's\nwhat i would do so in the moment this is\nhow you physiologically handle shame\nnext thing identity what do we do about\nthat so this is where there's a lot of\nstuff\num you know we can talk about i think uh\nonce again the atman\nlike there's a reason why the dr k's\nguide is what it is chad it's because\nlike most of the stuff is in there\nso if we think about you know who are\nyou and why do you deserve to be ashamed\nof yourself\nlike why are you deserving of shame so\nthere's dealing with the actual emotion\nbut i would ask yourself the question\nwhy do you deserve\nto be ashamed and then i would ask\nyourself you know how long\nhave you deserved\nto be ashamed and i'd really pay\nattention there\nand then the third question is what\nhappened\nright to take a look at like you know\nremember when you were five years old\nwere you ashamed of yourself and then\nwhen you were eight years old were you\nashamed of yourself and you'll say yes\nokay so what happened between five and\neight you may not be able to uncover\nanything\nbut then i know it sounds kind of weird\nthis is tough it requires some\nintrospection and if you do these\nthese practices regularly over time\nthis part will become easier then what i\nwould do when you\nexperience the shame and this is kind of\nwhen to how to tie it together so\nin a moment of shame i would ask\nyourself one last question\nwhich is are you someone that deserves\nto be ashamed right now\nor are you ashamed right now i know it\nsounds kind of weird but like think\nabout the identity versus the\ncircumstance\nand what you'll discover is that there\nis a part of your mind\nthat basically assumes that you should\nbe ashamed\nokay so now someone is saying\nfive-year-olds don't deserve shame\nokay but i want you all to understand\nthis when you don't deserve\nsomething and it happens to you anyway\nthat is what rewires your perception of\nwhat is deserved\ndo you guys get that like that is it in\na nutshell\nthat's where the core comes from when i\ndon't deserve\nsomething and it happens anyway it\nreprograms my understanding\nof what is deserved and what is not\ndeserved\nand then i carry that programming\nthrough life\nwhich is where you carry the identity of\nshame\nso that's where you have to go back\nand remap it figure out oh this\nfundamental principle which i have grown\nup with\nlike gravity like do you guys get that\nwhen you're five years old\nyou're understanding you're laying down\nthe cement\nto understand gravity in\nsocial interactions an identity a one\nmonth old doesn't know who they are they\ndon't have the capacity to know who they\nare\nthe five-year-old just sort of knows on\na broad sense whether i'm good or i'm\nbad\nhave i been a bad boy or have i been a\ngood boy and when some things happened\nto me that like\ni'm just playing with my blocks when dad\ncomes over\nhits me upside the head because i'm\nplaying with my blocks\noh boy is playing with my blocks bad no\nbecause i play with my blocks at school\nso how do i explain that oh it must be\nme\nkids play with blocks all the time i saw\nthese look at all these commercials\nwhere people are playing with blocks why\nam i getting it it must be\nme and it changes the idea of what you\ndeserve\nand then you carry the idea forward that\nyou deserve to be ashamed so you have to\ngo back\nand re-examine that right and recognize\nand this is really emotionally painful\nby the way\nliberating painful and we've done this\non stream a lot right like\ni'd say the who's the there's the guy\nwho's in the cult\nwhere like i i encourage y'all to watch\nthat and there was the other guy who\nhadn't cried in a long time he's tired\nof crying\nhe doesn't need to cry anymore watch\nthat one too\nbut i think it's like these people were\ntaught that this is what they deserve\nthis is your lot in life\nand so you have to go back and hopefully\nyou know you can do it to a certain\ndegree on your own you can absolutely do\nit in therapy like some of our coaches\ncan probably handle this kind of stuff\nactually a lot of them can it's\nsomething we deal with a lot\nand then the other thing is it doesn't\nhave to be through that right like you\ncan just grow as a human being and begin\nto realize like i did that like i was\nnever a failure and i was never a\nsuccess\nthe whole paradigm is incorrect there's\nno such thing as either one\nright like it's just i am what i am\nand i have just as much reason to be\nproud of\nof all of my rejection letters as i do\nof my diploma\nright like the rest of it the shame and\nthe failure and crap like that that's\nall crap that my mind\ncreates it's not real and once you kind\nof realize that then it changes who you\nare that's how you remap your identity\nyou"
