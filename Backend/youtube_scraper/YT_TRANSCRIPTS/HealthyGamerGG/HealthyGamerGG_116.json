    "transcript": "the one thing that I think is actually\nthe worst thing in society right now is\nthat everyone's perception has become\nvery very weak so like I agree no I\nfully agree with that we see it mostly\non uh social media you see it mostly on\nsocial media you have people that have\nextremely like extreme opinions rather\nthan having nuanced approaches to things\nthey don't know how to perceive anything\nbeyond the exact thing that they've\nhyperfocused on in that one area they\ndon't know how to see a greater picture\nbeyond that and it usually comes across\nas they don't want to they're being you\nknow jerks or anything like that a lot\nof people who are in those positions\ndon't believe that they're being jerks\nthey're just hyper fixated on one little\ntiny thing and their perception isn't\nwide enough to see the rest of the\npicture on that and that's not like a\nthat's not like a malicious thing a lot\nof the times it's just a failure to\nexpand the perception and I it sucks\nright it's made the internet really\ntoxic it really has"
