    "transcript": "and so i encourage all of you to accept\nresponsibility for your situation in\nlife\nbecause if you accept responsibility for\nyour situation\nyou also have the power to control it i\nknow it sounds kind of weird but\nif other people are to blame then i\ncan't do anything about it\nbecause i can't change other people you\ncan try but it's not going to work\nso let's kind of get started so a lot of\ntimes people kind of assume\nthat you know if they're highly rational\nthat they're like not emotional\nso we see this a lot in argument right\nwhere people will kind of be like\noh you know this person is a is a you\nknow this person is getting emotional\nand therefore their argument is wrong\nand it's really tricky because we you\nknow especially like a lot of people of\nour generation will think of themselves\nas like rational thinkers and part of\nthe reason that they\nconclude that they are a rational\nthinker i am a rational thinker and\nsomeone else is not\nis because this person is displaying\nemotion and i am not displaying emotion\nso if this person displays emotion and i\nam not displaying emotion then i am the\nmore rational thinker therefore my\nargument is more correct\nand it's almost like we sort of say that\nthe display of emotion\nbecomes like a point against our\nrational argument like if i make a\nrational argument but i make it\nemotionally you know if i have an\nargument but i make it emotionally then\nit becomes\nnot rational which is kind of\ninteresting because\nthat's not really the case so i know a\nlot of people think of themselves\nas like very rational thinkers but if\nyou really like engage them in\nconversation and they don't think of\nthemselves as emotional like you can\nactually uncover a lot of emotion very\nquickly\nand the simplest way to tell you know\nsomeone who thinks that they're a\nrational thinker\nthat they're you know a simple way to\nelicit emotion is to tell them that\ntheir logic is wrong\njust be like no bro like you're the\nlogical chain that you are outlining is\nincorrect\nand if you say that you will see an\nemotional response\nthe emotion will definitely come right\nright out right\nso it's kind of interesting because we\nsort of think about rationality and\nemotionality at opposite ends of the\nspectrum\nand in a sense that's actually somewhat\ntrue\nand we'll get to the neuroscience in a\nsecond but there is reciprocal\ninhibition between our cortices\nand our limbic system so our cortices is\nwhere a lot of our higher order thinking\ncomes from\nand there's there's a limbic system is\nwhere our emotions come from and\nwhat reciprocal inhibition means is that\nour cortices will suppress our emotions\nand our emotions will suppress our\ncortices\nso there's a reason why some people\nthink that you know if you're emotional\nyou're not going to be thinking\nrationally so there's some truth to that\nbut that's unfortunately not entirely\nhow the mind works\nso the first thing that we want to kind\nof dig into is that skill\nat argument does not necessarily make\nyou rational\nso a lot of times i'll see this in\ncouples counseling where like one person\nis like a better debater than the other\nperson\nand so anytime they have a conflict like\none person\nis like able to form their arguments\nmore like coherently and therefore they\nwill win the argument\nand then they assume that because they\nwon the argument\nthat their logic and their rational\nthinking is superior to the other\npersons\nit's kind of interesting right because\nif i win an argument doesn't that\nimply that the rationality that i used\nis more correct than yours\nbut hold on like let's take a step back\nand recognize that like debate\nand skill at argument is like a skill so\nif i had someone who was a master\ndebater\nand i even like i gave them a uh a bad\npremise\nto argue they would be able to like even\ntake something illogical and\nactually like out maneuver someone who\nis not as good as a debate\nright so one way that we sort of justify\nthe rationality of our\nargument is if we can out argue some or\nout argue someone else because\nso if i can convince someone or if i can\nout maneuver someone using my skill of\nargument\nthen i must be correct but that's not\nactually the case right because\nskillet argument is just skillet\nargument doesn't actually mean that\nyou're logically correct\nit just means that you're better at out\nmaneuvering another person\nand so this is kind of interesting\nbecause you know\nlike just because you're able to out\nmaneuver someone doesn't actually make\nyou right but then you kind of scratch\nyour head and you're like but\nif then what does make me right how do i\nknow if i'm rational if like skillet\nargument doesn't mean i'm right\nand so it's kind of interesting because\nif you really look at it from a\nneuroscience perspective\nwhat you can actually find is that\nemotions can\nhijack your skill at argument okay so\nlet's take the\nthe example of like someone who's in\ndenial\nabout being addicted to alcohol so this\nperson\npeople can approach someone who's\naddicted to alcohol in in denial\nwith the most logical argument and\nemotionally\nif this person is not willing to accept\nthat they have a problem\ntheir rational mind will come up with\nall kinds of counter arguments and you\nwill never be able to convince them that\nthey have a problem\nright unless they are willing to\nentertain the idea that they have a\nproblem you will never be able to\nconvince them\nso it's kind of interesting because if\nyou really look at the mind what we find\nis that your skillet argument\ncan be hijacked by other parts of your\nmind\nand so it you know you can kind of get\nemotional like if you get someone who's\nlike very good at arguing you get them\nriled up they will argue with you\nthat their emotion will kind of fuel\nthat argument and then like\nthey will you will never be able to\nconvince them that they're wrong\nand they may even be able to outmaneuver\nyou and they will walk away from that\ninteraction thinking that they're right\nand so people are kind of confused about\nthat all you have to do is look at\npolitics right because when i hold a\npolitical belief\nand someone else holds the opposite\npolitical belief both of us\nwithin our mind are convinced that our\nbelief\nis logical and justifiable no one in\npolitics says\nmy belief is idiotic we always try to\nsay oh this other person isn't thinking\nclearly\nthey're emotional and both sides will\nsay this all the time and if you really\nlike kind of like\nask the person is your you know believe\nlogical they'll say of course it is\nthat's why i believe it but if we really\nget it get into it what we actually\nrealize is that's not the case\nbecause logic may exist objectively but\nwhen you take\nlogic and you stick it in a human brain\nsome weird stuff starts to happen okay\nso let's try to like dig into why\nrational\nthinkers are actually quite emotional\nand how unless you\nunderstand the emotional aspect of your\nthinking\nyou will never sort of be thinking\nproperly\nokay so it starts with this so a lot of\npeople will say\nokay i'm not feeling emotional\ntherefore i must be rational right and\nthat's kind of interesting but if you\nlook at it\nsome people are alexa thymic and so what\nthat means is that they're\nthey've actually trained themselves or\nbeen conditioned\nto turn down the volume on their\nemotional signals\nif you actually look at these people\ntheir eq or emotional quotient\nis like lower than other people who are\nnot a\nalexa thymic and so i know it sounds\nkind of weird but just because you don't\nfeel emotion doesn't mean that there\nisn't emotion that's active in your\nbrain\nso we all have this part of our brain\ncalled the limbic system and the limbic\nsystem is how we feel emotion\nand i know it sounds kind of bizarre but\nyou can even look at\nyou know cases of people and we'll we'll\nshow some papers quickly\nbut you can look at people who have you\nknow neuroscience things going on\nthat suppress their ability to feel\nemotion and what you actually find is\nthose circuits of the brain aren't\nturned off\nthey're actually turned on in acting in\nsome way\nalthough there isn't awareness that the\nemotion is present\nso now it's i know it sounds kind of\nweird but like if you engage in a\nlogical argument with someone\nthe emotional parts of your brain are\nnot going to be like\nnon-functional they'll be functional and\nsome amount of awareness will be\nsuppressed so one of the\nplaces that we actually see this is\nactually in schizophrenia research\nso if you look at people with\nschizophrenia their experience\nof emotion over time can be like blunted\nor diminished\nso people with schizophrenia can develop\nsomething called flat affect which means\nyou can't\nsee emotion in their face so even though\nthey could be experiencing emotion\ntheir the visibility of their emotion\nis kind of like there's a there's a\nbreak between these two\ncircuits of your brain and similarly\nwhat we see in alexa thymia is that the\nemotion is\nactive on some level in your\nneuroscience\nand is actually hijacking your\nrationality but your experience of it\nis not present which sounds really\nreally weird but that's because sort of\nlike\nyou you're just not aware of it but it's\nabsolutely there\nokay so this is where let's kind of turn\nto a little bit of research\nokay so we're going to explain this\nprinciple a little bit better\nso inhibition of action thought and\nemotion a selective neurobiological\nreview so this\nthis review goes into a lot of\ninformation that is less\nrelevant for us but is really\ninteresting\ntalks about you know inhibitory circuits\nfor thoughts and actions and emotions\nbut here's the important part for us so\nemotional dysregulation is a\ncharacteristic\nof a variety of forms of psychopathology\nand dysregulated fear responses play a\nprominent role in blah blah blah\nby studying extinction researchers\nhave made substantial progress in\nunderstanding the psychological and\nneural mechanisms underlying the\ninhibition\nof conditioned fear responses below we\nreview evidence indicating that the\nvm that's ventromedial prefrontal cortex\namygdala and hippocampus are critical\nbrain regions\ninvolved in fear extinction okay so\nlet's just think a little bit about what\nthis is saying and i'll try to translate\nfor y'all\nwhat this means if we're talking about\ninhibition of a con\nconditioned fear response what that\nessentially means is that\ni have a fear response that is\nactivating\nbut there are parts of my brain that are\nkind of inhibiting it or suppressing it\nso the fear is there and there are\ncertain circuits of my brain that will\nactually like\ngo out of their way to try to suppress\nit from actually happening\nand this is sort of what we see in cases\nof like a lexithymian argument\nis that a lot of people won't feel\nemotional\nbut there are actually emotional\ncircuits that are active that are being\ninhibited from like presenting in a\nparticular way by other circuits of our\nbrain\nso our ventromedial prefrontal cortex\nwhich\nis where a lot of our you know logic and\nexecutive function comes from\nactively will inhibit the experience of\nthings like fear or other kinds of\nemotions\nbut the really interesting thing is that\nthere's reciprocal\ninhibition so sometimes what can happen\nis even though we're trying to inhibit\nthat circuit\nthat circuit can activate and actually\nshape our rational thinking\nokay and no it sounds kind of weird but\nif you have a friend who's very\nemotional let's say that i'm afraid that\nmy partner is cheating on me\nthen what happens is that emotion drives\nmy rational thought process right\nand then i start thinking all these\nthings that if my friends try to\ndisprove me i'm like no man\nlike i'm texting her and she's not\nanswering but it's like dude\nmaybe she's asleep it's like 1am no man\nlike she's not answering because this\nright and you can try to argue with that\nperson as much as you want to\nbut as long as that emotional circuitry\nis hijacking their rational circuitry\nthey will never like respond to your\nrational argument\nright and so this is kind of the tricky\nthing when it comes to the human mind is\nwe have\nrational thoughts and we have emotional\nthoughts\nand we tend to think that if i don't\nsort of think if i don't\nfeel the emotion then i must be rational\nbut actually what what i've discovered\nand this is sort of what the vedic\nwith the yogis discovered as well is\nthat if you are not\naware of your emotions if you can't feel\nemotions\nthat doesn't mean that emotions don't\nexist that just means that the action of\nemotions\nis not visible to you and i would argue\nthat the less\nemotion you're able to feel the more\nlikely your rational thinking is\nactually hijacked by your emotions\nand this is where things like cognitive\nbiases come from right so if we think\nabout\nthese things in psychiatry like\ncognitive biases\ndenial defense mechanisms projection\nso what are what what does all this crap\nmean like why does this happen\nwhy do we have a cognitive bias why do\nwe have these psychological defense\nmechanisms\nwhen i am in denial that's a\npsychological defense mechanism so what\nam i defending against\ni'm defending against emotion so we tend\nto find\nis that hyper rational thinkers are not\nactually hyper rational\nthey're actually they're the at the\nconclusion that they come to is i'm a\nrational thinker because i don't feel\nemotion\nwhereas what's more likely and this is\nwhat we get trained in in psychiatry\nis to recognize that there are all these\npsychological defense mechanisms which\nmanifest as rationality but that person\nis not able to experience the underlying\nemotion\nand if they're not able to experience it\nit's essentially going to hijack\nyour skillet argument and start\ndisproving people\nright and left so it's kind of bizarre\nbut at the end of the day\nwhat i've seen is that if you want to\ndetermine whether your thought process\nis\ntruly rational or not the main question\nyou need to ask yourself is\nam i aware of my internal emotional\nstate\nand until you become aware of your\ninternal emotional state\nthere's a decent chance that your\nthinking is not actually going to be\nrational at all\nbut you'll be recruiting all these weird\npsychological defense mechanisms\nand like kind of hijacking your skill at\nargument\nto prove other people wrong but really\nyou're the one who's like\nwoefully incorrect it's really bizarre\nbut that's kind of how it works\nso if you want to be become a more\nrational thinker i know it sounds kind\nof weird but what you actually need to\ndo\nis gain emotional awareness right\nbecause\nwe when we really think about a rational\nthinker like someone who makes good\ndecisions\nit's the person who says oh like\nemotionally\ni feel embarrassed going to a party\nbut now that i'm aware that i have that\nembarrassment i can\nact in spite of it and kind of do the\nright thing whereas what will happen if\nwe're not careful\nis that emotional embarrassment will be\nlike ah it's not worth going to\nright oh i'm not even going to have a\ngood time oh it's so far away\ni come up with all of these i know this\nis a weird word i know you guys have\nnever heard this word before it's it's a\nvery rare sanskrit word\nrationalizations right and what does\nthat mean like what is a rationalization\nit's our brains emotion\nhijacking our skill of argument to come\nup with a logical response\nthat other people are not able to argue\nagainst\nright it's crazy we even have words in\nour\nlanguage where we intrinsically\nunderstand this stuff we intuitively get\nthis when we use the word\nrationalization\nand what we tend to find is that the\nmore unaware you are of your emotions\nthe more your rational thought process\nwill be filled with rationalizations\ninstead of real logic so that's how\nyou know you got to be careful but if\nyou consider yourself a rational thinker\nand you don't experience much emotion\nthere's a decent chance and you guys may\nknow people who are like this too\nthat actually your emotions are actually\nrunning the show from behind the scenes\nand that your rational mind is a puppet\nthat's being controlled by your emotions\nyeah people are mentioning ben shapiro\nand stuff like that yeah so like i i'm\nnot\nsurprised that people are drawing these\ncorrelations\ni don't really know like i try not to\nmake judgments about people unless i've\ntalked to them personally\num but when someone is saying rational\nis irrationalizing as making excuses\nabsolutely right so this is where\num you know\nif you kind of think about it like why\nare you making an excuse it's because\nthere's an emotional pain that you want\nto dodge it's a protective mechanism\nthat's why we call them defense\nmechanisms\nso when people are kind of asking the\nquestion okay how do i become more aware\nof my emotions\nso i know it's kind of weird but like if\nyou just actually sit down and pay\nattention you may discover\nthat there's a lot of stuff about your\nlife that your\nyour mind is really working hard to\navoid\nright because like if if we open that\ncan of worms if we do say\nokay like this was my fault or i am an\naddict\nholy crap what does that mean it means\ni'm letting my kids down it means i'm\nletting my spouse down\nit means that i'm disappointing the\npeople at work it means that like\ni have a problem that like i don't know\nif i can fix\nbecause i you know i can fix all of the\nrational things in my head\nbecause my mind is telling me it's just\nthis you can fix that\nbut there's a lot of fear with like\nletting go of your defense mechanisms\nand like\nyou know in a raw way like facing your\nproblems because you\nmaybe you can't fix the addiction you\ncan fix all this other stuff which you\nkeep on saying is the problem no\nit's not video games aren't the problem\nthe problem is i'm just like not\ndisciplined enough\ni just need to be more disciplined i\nwish i was more disciplined this isn't\nthe problem this is\nit's not the marijuana that's the\nproblem like the marijuana helps with my\nanxiety like i don't\nyou know the problem is that the\ncapitalistic society and student loans\nand\nand all this like the world is going to\nhell it's not marijuana that's the issue\nit's like\nlook at all of these things this is what\nhappens right once the emotions\nhijack the rational part of our mind we\ncome up with a lot of evidence which is\ncompelling it's not like our mind thinks\nfalse things\nit's just really selective and it's like\nno man like the reason that you're not\ndoing well in life is\nabsolutely because of capitalism which\nis fair like it's\nyou can say that there's a predatory\nwork environment you're not logically\nincorrect there\nit's just blaming you know the universe\nis an awesome way to give a pass\nto yourself right because then it isn't\nyour fault\nyeah like everyone else is wrong you\nknow and i see this a lot with like\npeople who are\nyou know i i don't want to get into this\nbut there there\nyou know there are some things that are\nmedically you know we know\nare like medically dangerous right so\nthere are certain\naspects of the self and in our desire to\nbe like an accepting society\nwhat what some people have started to do\nis normalize or even promote\nthings that are like scientifically\nmedically dangerous and they say like oh\nmy god like i don't want to deal with\nthe shame\nof a particular aspect of myself\ntherefore i'm going to demonize\nall of society instead of like take care\nof myself\nright and as a scientist like is medical\ndoctor like there there's clear\nyou know there's like a clear right\nanswer about what's healthy and what's\nunhealthy\nand then what once we get into these\nlike psychological like\ngames of like i don't wanna deal with\nthe shame\nthat i feel internally therefore\ni'm gonna play a really cool trick y'all\nready for it\ni don't have to be ashamed if there's\nnothing wrong\nright so i have an op\nop technique to deal with internal shame\njust blame society and normalize the way\nthat you are\nit comes back to if you don't deserve me\nyou don't if you can't handle me at my\nworst you don't deserve me at my best\nlike why do i need to grow as a person\nlike\npeople need to be more accepting it's\nnot my problem\nthat i'm an [ __ ] people need to be\nmore compassionate\nit's their problem everyone is so mean\nand cruel nowadays like\ni don't need to improve people need to\nbe nicer to me and now\neveryone so be careful be careful be\ncareful\nbecause now everyone's like oh like\nyou're\ntaking your particular the people that\nyou dislike\nor you disagree with and what is your\nmind doing yeah the people that disagree\nwith me\nthey're the ones that do what dr k is\ntalking about they're the idiots that\nhe's talking about\nyeah that's them that's the take your\npick\nconservatives liberals this person that\nperson take your pick\nwhichever side of the argument you're on\nwhat are you doing right now\nyou're putting the other people that you\nargue against you said dr k\nthat's these people no bro like you\ncould be that people that's what we're\nsaying we're not talking about the\npeople you argue against\nwe're talking about you it's crazy do\nyou see how your mind does that\nit's so damn quick because now it has a\njustification\nto disprove the other person's point\nit's like yeah i'm right\ndr k said so be careful\nokay be careful we're not here to talk\nabout other people\nthis stream is here to talk about you\nright why do you take this piece of\njuicy juicy evidence\nbecause damn it's a good piece of\nevidence do you guys see that scientific\npaper man\noh man it's definitely this person and\nit could be\nyou could be right right i'm not saying\nthat they're not like that\nbut just be careful about how your mind\nwhat does your mind emotionally feel\nwhen you assign this idiocy to your\nopponents\noh my god doesn't it feel so good feels\nso good\noh look at these noobs they're like this\nand then look at that emotion and what\ndo you think that emotion is doing\nit's hijacking your rational circuitry\nand it's saying like oh look\nnow i get to feel better than them that\nis my favorite thing to do\nis i need to be better than that person\noh that feels so\ndamn good be careful be careful\nokay be careful\nso we're not saying and this is the key\nthing to remember when your emotions\nhijack your rational circuitry\nyour rational circuitry never comes up\nwith stuff that's\nwrong okay this is the tricky thing\nbecause you think oh doesn't that mean\nmy rational circuitry is wrong\nincorrect it's selective huge difference\nit's incomplete\nright so if i ask a girl out girl says\nno\nthen i feel hurt rejected and\nashamed oh my god until i start dissing\nher\nand it's like oh she doesn't deserve me\noh then i don't have to feel ashamed\nher loss oh my god i get to feel better\nabout myself\ni was doing it as a favor it was charity\non my part\nif she doesn't want to accept the\ncharity\ni'm too cool for her beautiful she\nwasn't even that attractive\nright it doesn't have to be i'm just\nsaying that because you know my\nexperience when i\nyou speak in the first person i adopt a\nheteronormative masculine perspective\nbecause these are the thoughts that i\nhad when i was like 19 years old\na freshman in college asking a girl out\nand we when she turned me down\nthat's what my mind did came up with all\nthese reasons\nthat protected me from feeling ashamed\nof myself\nright it goes the other way like dudes\ncan do this with dudes\nwomen can do it with dudes women can do\nit with women it doesn't matter\ndoesn't even have to be romantic right\nit can be like a job interview it can be\nlike uh\nyou can invite a friend to a social\nevent\nand then they can turn you down and then\nyou feel rejected and like you're not\ngood enough for them and then the mind\nflips over and says oh like it's his\nloss\nright so where i'm not trying to\ndemonize y'all i'm y'all are great y'all\nare fantastic let's understand these\nparts of ourselves\nright and let's understand that it's\nactually okay to feel\nshame it's okay to feel rejected because\nsometimes we get rejected\nand as we start to look into that right\nas we start to face our problems and we\nface like oh wow like i really feel like\nshameful\nand rejected as we start to acknowledge\nthose emotions\nthen we can leverage our truly free\nrational thinking on it\nand then we'll discover one of two\nthings i know it's crazy we're gonna\ndiscover one of two things\none is oh crap maybe i deserve to be\nrejected\nmaybe there's something here that i need\nto get better at\nright like maybe like i'd do a better\njob at romantic relationships and\npeople would say yes if i you know\ngroomed myself\nso you that's how you make progress\nright you sort of notice that there are\nparticular things you could do wrong\nother option maybe you'll discover that\nthey're a toxic [ __ ]\nright because some people reject you and\nit's really not\nfair like some people reject you because\nthey've got an ego thing going on\nthey've got emotional crap going on\nmaybe you'll discover that there's\nsomeone in your life that persistently\nmakes you feel a negative way\nand that that actually isn't fair but\nyou're not gonna know the answer to that\nuntil you\nauthentically and calmly look at it and\nface what you feel\noh wow this person routinely makes me\nfeel really bad about myself\nso then like once you're like oh and\nthen it's kind of tricky i i know we're\nkind of going\noff on a tangent here but if you're not\ncareful\nwhat that'll turn into is like all kinds\nof things to make yourself feel better\nwhen you have a toxic person in your\nlife and they reject you\nwhat do you actually do to suppress that\nemotion\nyou bend over backwards for them right\noh like this person rejected me\nlet me oh do you want to go out to\ndinner on friday\noh you said no and i feel hurt and\nrejected oh it's my treat i just got a\nbonus and i'm looking to celebrate\ni'll pay for your food and then the\nperson is like uh\nokay fine and then they come out right\nand then it's kind of interesting\nbecause then what happens is you start\nengaging in all of this behavior\nto avoid that feeling of rejection and\npropagate the toxic relationship\nright it's really it's really tricky but\nthat's where once again the solution is\nstill the same as long as you're able to\nnotice\nthat shame notice that rejection be\naware of it even start to tolerate it\nbecause\nthat's a big part of it not even being\naware of it awareness is like 50\nintolerance to be honest and so as\nyou're able to do that then you're like\noh actually like i feel ashamed and\nonce you acknowledge the shame once you\nfeel the shame it's no longer\nsecretly working behind the scenes to\nlike manipulate your behavior\ninto propagating toxic relationships\ndoes rationalizing\nultimately feed a negative self-image\nabsolutely\nso remember the goal of rationalizing\nis to support whatever you feel right so\nif you look at like\ndoomers okay like\ndoomers actually maybe doomers is not a\ngood example let me think about this\nso does rationalizing ultimately feed a\nnegative self-image\nabsolutely let's look at someone who's\ndepressed so in the mind of a depressed\nperson\nthey have a core feeling of low\nself-worth\nokay and then like rationally they'll\ngive you a thousand justifications\nwhy there's low self-worth and you can\nargue i can i can argue with my patients\nthere's so much reason to live like you\nliterally have three kids\nthat are telling you that they hope you\nget better and they want to see you\nagain\nand they love you very much and they\ndon't want you to go anywhere they're\nliterally telling you that\nand then the stronger the emotion the\nstronger the rationalization\nthey're just saying that they don't\nunderstand that like i'm causing them so\nmuch pain by being sick\nthey would be so much better if they\ncould like worry about people who\ndeserved their love\nit's like the strength of the\nrationalization supports the emotion\nit's crazy right and so it absolutely\ncan reinforce the negative self-image\nand that's why talking to people\nlogically about why they should live\ndoesn't\nwork very well i mean it can help some\nand that's where you got to acknowledge\nthe emotion first then you can talk to\nthem logically about it\nsomeone's asking how do you deal with a\nstring of toxic relationships by looking\nat the common variable\ni'm not trying to be mean there but like\nwhat is it that you\ndo what are the emotional needs and this\nis the really tricky thing\nbecause people who wind up in strings of\ntoxic relationships\nthere's something really powerful that's\ndrawing you to that person\nthat's what you need to understand okay\nit's a fantastic question\nbut it's this kind of thing where like i\nknow it sounds kind of weird but if you\nlook at people who are\nroutinely in toxic relationships\nthe person in the toxic relationship\nmakes you\nfeel the way makes you feel the way that\nyou feel about yourself\nthat is why people wind up in toxic\nrelationships over and over and over\nagain\nthey confirm what you believe about\nyourself\nand so human beings will go for like\nconfirmation and order over\npain so you will like human beings are\njust wired this way it's like the way\nthat we've evolved\nwe'll accept a pain that we understand\nand are familiar with because there's a\npart of your mind that's like\nwe can survive this we've done it 10\ntimes before\nthis is home field advantage and so if\nyou believe something about yourself and\nthen the toxic person\nreinforces that belief it fits it's like\noh that\nthat's that's i knew it i knew it so\nit's really tricky\nbut that's the problem because i mean it\ncould be circumstances and stuff like\nthat like maybe just\nliterally your social circle is filled\nwith people who are toxic\nbut generally speaking what i find is\nthat people who engage in toxic\nrelationships over and over and over\nagain i know it sounds kind of weird but\nwhen they come into my office we don't\nwork on the people that they're dating\nwe work on them\nand so i encourage all of you to accept\nresponsibility\nfor your situation in life because if\nyou accept responsibility for\nyour situation you also have the power\nto control it\ni know it sounds kind of weird but if\nother people are to blame\nthen i can't do anything about it\nbecause i can't change other people you\ncan try\nbut it's not going to work but if you\naccept responsibility for your situation\nthat also means that\nif it's your fault that you're here you\ncould have done things differently which\nmeans that you can do things differently\nso it's really tricky but responsibility\nand empowerment come hand in hand\nwith great power comes great\nresponsibility is absolutely right\nbecause that's the only way it works\nso if you all feel if you if you're\nsaying to yourself it's all your fault\nthat also means that it's within your\npower to change it\nand that's just like are you willing to\ncarry that burden\nyou"
