    "transcript": "so if you're someone who says i don't\nknow if this is going to work therefore\ni'm not going to do it you are correct\nit may not work but it is because it may\nnot work that is\nwhy you should do it because it's never\ngoing to work until you keep trying\nso hard work doesn't matter only results\nmatter for the longest time i've had the\nbelief that it doesn't matter how hard\nyou work in life\nit's only really the results that matter\npeople won't really care about how hard\nyou work unless you give them the\nresults they want to see\nyou can spend days studying for a test\nputting countless countless hours into\nsomething or dedicating a lot of time\ntowards\nwhatever thing you're working hard at\nnone of it matters if you don't produce\nresults that you or others find\nsatisfactory\nthis mentality has pretty much been more\nharmful to me than it is helpful\nas it has pretty much stopped me from\nworking on anything with any amount of\neffort\ni pretty much look at anything i want to\ndo and go i wish i could do this\nbut i don't know if my work can produce\nthe results necessary to achieve success\nfor me or others so why bother i really\nwant to improve my life\nand work to make myself a better person\nbut i just fear that i won't get the\nresults needed to feel like\ni accomplished anything i want to do\ni really want to stop thinking like this\nbut it's just been really hard to get\nout of this mentality\nif anybody wants to help me out with why\nhard work matters\nor how to get out of this mentality it\nwould be appreciated\nsorry if this comes off as a ramble or\nanything i've been really nervous to\npost this\nokay so you know how sometimes i make it\ni try to bully twitch chat and say owned\ngg so i wanna i wanna actually give this\nperson mvp\nbecause i can imagine that this person\nwhen they were thinking about posting\nthis\nmaybe their mind said i wish i could\npost something and ask for help\nbut i don't know if posting something\nand asking for help will actually help\ntherefore i'm not going to bother and\nwhat did they do\nthey post it anyway so this whatever\nhappened here\nis the first step to fixing this problem\nand what do you guys notice about this\nsentence awareness\nof your internal emotional state\ninstead of this logical pile of\ndo you guys like how more simply can i\nsay this\nit's a beautiful illustration hey i\nthink this way\nit doesn't help i'm nervous and\nthey act it's a perfect example\nof exactly what you need to do because\nthis is what the mind is gonna tell you\nit's gonna produce the false rational\nthoughts\nwrong knowledge and so the first thing\nthat i'd say\nis how are you able to make this post\nwhat did your mind tell you\nwould happen if you made this post it's\nkind of interesting\nbut let's let's answer in a little bit\nmore of a complete way\nso if your mind is telling you all the\ntime\nthat results are the only things that\nmatter and\nbecause results are the only things that\nmatter and look at all the evidence that\ni have\nno one cares about how much you studied\nthey just care about your grades\nright like when i apply to college and\nhere's the evidence right so here's the\nrational mind\nwhen i apply to college they don't ask\nhow much i studied\nthey asked me for my transcript and they\nmake the decision based on the\ntranscript\nit's a good argument right it's true\nit's good\nso remember that when your intellect\ngets hijacked by\nsome emotion the arguments it comes up\nwith are never false that's why you\ncan't convince someone because the\narguments they come up with\nare logical on some level i don't have\nan alcohol problem because\ni'm not in jail and i know someone who\nhas an alcohol problem and he's in jail\nhe drives drunk i don't therefore\ni don't have a problem if you talk to a\nthousand alcoholics who are in denial\nthey'll draw the bar of who has a\nproblem\nso that they are on the safe side that's\nwhere they draw the line\nthe line is a little bit past where i am\nright that's just the nature of\nrationalization\nso how can we approach this okay how can\nwe help someone who thinks to themselves\nonly results matter now i want you guys\nto pay attention to a couple of things\nhere okay none of it matter none of it\nmatters\nif you don't produce results that you or\nothers find satisfactory\nokay achieve success\nso i'd start with this question what do\nothers find satisfactory\nand what is the nature and origin of\nsuccess what does that mean like what is\nthe target you're shooting for\nbecause it's kind of like a\nself-fulfilling prophecy if success\nmeans a 4.0 then you're right the only\nthing that matters is grades\nobviously right if my standard is like\nif success to me is a 4.0\nif my success is an outcome then of\ncourse\noutcomes are what matters for that\nsuccess it's like kind of a no-brainer\nso if you have a results-oriented\nperspective on success then results are\ngoing to matter it's sort of like\nyou know if we're judging if we have a\nheight contest\nwhat matters is your height it's like\nthe way that we set things up\nso instead what i would encourage you to\ndo is like think about this post\nwas this post a success was it\nwhat's the bar that you're measuring\nagainst and this is a common problem\nthat i have with the medical students i\ndon't\ndon't work with many of them now but\nlike a lot of times like medical\nstudents are so grades oriented they're\nso results oriented at some point\nat some point i kind of like you know\nmetaphorically slap them upside the head\ni'm like\nyou're not here for grades who cares\nabout your clinical grade like do you\nget that two years from now\nyou're gonna walk into a room or you're\ngonna be like at a party\nand someone is gonna ask the question is\nthere a doctor here and then like\nsomeone's gonna point to you they're\nlike that that person's a doctor and\nthen\nyou're gonna have to figure out what to\ndo with another human being that's why\nyou should study\nwho the hell cares what grade you get\nlike you're studying because the\ninformation has\nvalue in and of itself that will become\npractically useful for you at some point\nit's absolutely terrifying it's the\nscariest damn thing and so i'd say like\nwhat is\nhow do you define success and how do you\ndefine what is satisfactory how do you\ndefine what other\nyou know what other people find\nsatisfactory like where does that come\nfrom\nbecause as long as you're playing a game\nthat is rigged to be outcome oriented\nyou're gonna find that\nno individual thing will feel like\nenough\nthere's a second cognitive trap here\nwhich is that\nthe feeling of enough is like will\nparalyze you\nso let me just give you guys an example\nif i'm results focused let's say i want\nto climb to the top of a mountain i look\nthere\nand i say okay how do i get to the top\nof that mountain and i take one step\nforward\nthen i look at the top of the mountain\nhave i made progress\nno am i any closer no\nit's still the same distance away every\nstep you take\nis going to feel insufficient if you are\nfocused on your end goal\ntechnically have i moved forward yes but\nthat's not what my mind is going to tell\nme\nbecause remember my mind is thinking\nabout the the result right like what is\nhis mind\nthis person's mind tell him i wish i\ncould do this but i don't know if my\nwork can produce the results\nnecessary to achieve success so why\nbother\nwhy bother trying unless success is\nguaranteed and if you think about it\nlike\nnothing you do is gonna guarantee\nsuccess and so you're setting up a\nsituation for yourself where you're\nunable to act which is exactly what this\nperson's problem is and they even\nrecognize it's a problem so what do we\ndo\nand so it's odd but what you have to do\nis let go of success\nright so then like the bar is not\ngetting to the top of the mountain\nthe bar is how many steps am i gonna\ntake\nthe bar is not getting six pack abs the\nbar is not losing\n50 pounds the bar is am i gonna it's not\neven going to the gym every day\nbe careful because that's an outcome the\nbar is\nam i going to go to the gym today am i\ngoing to exercise\ntoday so you need to shift your mindset\nfrom a performance-oriented mindset to a\ngrowth-oriented mindset\nand this is work that carol dweck did an\nawesome job of sort of\nthinking about so she hit on on it that\nway\nthe other way to kind of think about it\nis from a yogic perspective garumafar\nas a human being you are not entitled to\nthe fruits of your actions\nall you are entitled to is actions as a\nhuman being you do not get to control\nresults\ni know it sounds weird you don't get to\ncontrol results\nall you get to control is actions so as\nlong as you are concerned\nat all about controlling a particular\noutcome\nthat is something that you will never be\nable to succeed in\ni know it sounds kind of weird but we\nthink we can control results but we\ncan't\nany job interview i go into i don't have\nthe ability to get that job\ni can't control that all i can control\nis whether i walk into the interview all\ni can control is whether i do my\nhomework the day before\nwhether i learn about the company or not\ni can't control whether i get an a or\nnot all i can control is whether i study\nand maybe if i'm woefully unlucky and it\nturns out that out of the hundred\nquestions\neleven questions were from the one\nlecture that i missed and couldn't find\nnotes on\nbecause my buddy who i relied on for\nnotes never came through\nthen i'm sol and i get a b g g\ni can't actually control getting an a\nall i can control is what i study so\ncarol dweck sort of talks about this\nfrom a research psychological\naspect but this has been known in\nhumanity and in the east\nfor literally thousands of years that as\na human being you don't control\noutcomes you only control actions so\nwhen i got on stream today\ncan i help you think about it for a\nsecond what's gonna happen if you come\nand listen to our streams what's the\noutcome you have no clue\nas do i i have no clue what are we going\nto talk about i don't know\nam i going to make sense maybe am i not\ngoing to make sense is it going to be\nconfusing is my vata going to get the\nbetter of me maybe\nbut we're going to show up and we're\ngoing to try and that's why we stream\nusually three days a week we're going to\nroll those dice as much as we can we're\ngoing to keep trying\nand if you roll the dice enough this is\nwhat the law of karma says generally\nspeaking if you roll the dice enough\nthings will end up in your favor so stop\nfocusing about the success adopt a\ngentian\nimpact mindset you gotta grind\ngotta put your wallet where your desires\nare right\nseriously life is a gamble chat right\nyou gotta the way to succeed like how do\nyou get a five star character and\ngunshin impact you roll the dice many\nmany many many times\nso who is the one who succeeds it's the\npeople who roll the dice over and over\nand over again\nso if you're someone who says i don't\nknow if this is going to work therefore\ni'm not going to do it you are correct\nit may not work but it is because it may\nnot work that is\nwhy you should do it because it's never\ngoing to work until you keep trying\nyeah so also chad i've kind of cooled\noff on genting impact it's getting kind\nof grindy and i'm not so sure i'm gonna\ncontinue playing it\nyou know but i i will say yeah so like\nwhen someone was a 0.01\nso chat i will explain to y'all okay\nlast example of rng\nwhen i graduated from college with a 2.5\ngpa\npeople know this story i'm sure i\napplied to 140 research positions\ngot one interview and 139 rejections\nthe 141st research position i applied to\nwas harvard medical school\nand i got it so keep trying on my wall\nmy biggest regret\nfrom applying to medical school for\nthree years in a row\nis that i did not keep all of the\nrejection letters\nwhat i want on my wall what deserves to\nbe on my wall\nis not my certifications from\nharvard medical school what deserves to\nbe on my wall is the\n90 rejection letters i got that's my\nstory\nit's not about the one that i got right\nit's about the 90 applications that i\nsent out\nthat's what i'm proud of and so i\nencourage each and every one of you when\nyour mind tells you it's not gonna be\nenough okay\nso what are you gonna do about it are\nyou going to try anyway\nare you going to let external\ncircumstances dictate your actions\nbecause if you want to take control of\nyour life you have to stop letting\nexternal circumstances\ndictate your actions controlling your\nlife is about\nacting and losing control of your life\nis letting other things control your\nactions\nwhether it be a toxic relationship\nwhether it be like applying are you\ngonna let your anxiety control you are\nyou gonna ask someone out\nyou can let your anxiety control you or\nyou're gonna apply for a job you're\ngoing to let your anxiety control you're\ngoing to sign up to learn how to play\nthe piano\nwhat do you control very little and the\nproblem is that everyone is so\nbent out of shape everyone spends so\nmuch time trying to chase success that\nthey forget action\nand what you essentially find is that\nthe people who are successful are the\nones who devote themselves to action\nso devote yourself to action that's all\nyou need to do just get up and act\nyou're like\nbut it may fail yes you're correct it\nmay fail it will probably fail and then\nif you do it again\nthe chances of failure are lower you do\nit again the chances are lower\nyou do it again chances are lower and\nthen depending on your beliefs\nyou know if you believe in god and what\nnot hopefully there's a pity timer\nyou never know right so i think maybe\ngetting getting into hms as a research\nassistant was my five star pity timer\nyou"
