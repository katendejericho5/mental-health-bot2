    "transcript": "i i know it's maybe sounds weird but the\nidea of like a sociopath where it\nbecomes all about\nmimicking the behaviors where you have\nto put all this thought into like\nokay i put my arm here this indicates\nthis behavior\nlike all those components into being\nable to start\ntrying to develop friendships yeah\nwelcome hello um so yeah\ncan you first tell me what you you know\nwhat you go by and\nand how you'd like to be addressed today\num dust is fine\nyes okay i'm all over dr k it's nice to\nmeet you desk\nnice to meet you as well um thank you\nvery much for\nyou know coming on we appreciate it\nabsolutely um is there something\nimportant so can you just tell us a\nlittle bit about\nuh you know i understand you're a\nstreamer so can you tell us a little bit\nabout\nwhat kind of what kind of streaming you\ndo and where we can find you\nuh so yes i i focus a lot on charity\num it's it's one of the things that i've\nreally found to just help with my own\nmental health\nand in fact one of the things that they\nrecommend is helping others tends to be\nlike that the best way to kind of just\ndeal with your own problems and kind of\nyou know get a lot of that um intrinsic\nvalue\nokay so i've been doing that a lot um\nyou can find me at\ntwitch.tv mephisto i mainly play a lot\nof world of warcraft\nuh things like speed running collecting\ni really really enjoy collecting things\nthat that sense of completion is really\nsatisfying\ncool thanks a lot and um is there\nsomething in particular that you wanted\nto talk about today des\num so really i just want to go ahead and\nget across\nwhat autism is i want to kind of engage\nwith the the community and\nhelp create some understanding of\num that that concept especially like\nwhen\ni didn't get diagnosed until i was 29\nand what i thought autism\nwas growing up as a kid isn't\nwhat it turned out to be and then there\nthere's the whole issue of things like\naba and there's there's this big charity\nevent going on right now\nthat is uh color the spectrum which i\nthink is sending out a lot of\nmixed messages about what autism is\nand is more so hurtful to autistics\nrather than helpful\ninteresting so um a lot of\nso okay so that that sounds\nuh like a great structure des do you\nmind if i ask you\num just throughout this conversation i\nthink a lot of times the way that we try\nto illustrate things\nis by asking people sort of like\npersonal questions about their\nexperience\nof a particular thing whether it be like\nyou know\ndealing with um you know toxicity and\ngaming\nor you know dealing with depression\nthings like that is it okay if i ask you\num you know personal questions about\nwhat your\nexperience of autism is things like that\nyes that's completely fine in fact i\num recently there was a video that just\nwent viral of a bpd per individual\nwho um was hitting themselves in the\nhead repeatedly after being\nharassed by a customer and that video\ngave me the strength to actually post a\nvideo of me having an autistic meltdown\non stream\num so i'm i'm very very open\nto to answer anything personal or to do\nthat because i see this as a way of\nhelping others\nyeah and and just you know for\nclarification if i ever ask you anything\nthat\num you don't feel is appropriate or you\ndon't feel comfortable answering\nyou know please just signal that to me\nin some way if i\ndetect from you that maybe we're talking\nabout things that could be making you\nuncomfortable i may point it out to you\num and you know at the end of the day\nlike we're really here to\nhelp people but i don't want you to hurt\nyourself or sacrifice anything\nfor the sake of the greater good okay\nif i do so it's it's of my own volition\ni understand to make a difference\npain is kind of necessary at times but\nit's important to recognize that i\nchoose that not that it's it's something\ni'm unwilling of\nyeah that's a that's a pretty profound\nstatement that pain is necessary\nsometimes to make a difference\ncan you help me understand that\num being like like being open about\nautism\nlike using my life as a kind of open\nbook to help others\none of the things that i've enjoyed most\nabout streaming is having\num individuals who didn't realize they\nthemselves were autistic\nand after saying and hearing my story\nand everything that i talked about make\nthat connection they go and see a\ntherapist\nthey go through the practice and then\nthey get diagnosed themselves\nright it's it puts you in these\npositions where\nyou know i really wish i didn't have to\nopen up about this but\nit really also at the same time helps a\nlot of people\nwhat makes you not want to open up about\nit\num it's it's it's\nthere is a lot of negativity that can\ncome from these things i mean\nfor example the the sharing the the\nvideo of\nmyself having an autistic meltdown where\ni i repeatedly punched myself in the\nhead\nit's it's scary right it's a scary thing\nto witness\nit's something that could potentially\nmake future\njob opportunities impossible\nand i understand though that\nthese things have value and that they\ncan help others\nand like it it's the hard thing where\ni know i can handle it i know that if\nthings\ngo bad i can at least\ni'm sure i can find a way to recover\nfrom it whereas\ngo ahead i was just going to say so\nyou've mentioned\nautistic breakdown or meltdown a couple\nof times now and\nand apparently you were um you know\nhitting yourself\ncan you help us understand what you mean\nby that term\nso an autistic meltdown is\ni would say in some ways it's similar to\nlike the the common understanding of a\nmeltdown\nin a neurotypical individual where\neverything is at its absolute worst\num in that you can't really process\nanything going on\num at least to my understanding and for\nmyself\nbasically it's like everything ceases to\nfunction the brain goes straight\ninto the fight or flight system but it\ndoesn't have a way to channel it\nso everything just kind of\nblows up and as a result\ni i can't think i can't function one of\nthe\nthe negative stems that i have to tends\nto just be\npunching myself in the head because i'm\nso overwhelmed\num it's taken a lot of practice and a\nlot of awareness\nto to be able to recognize the only way\nthat i can stop these things is to be\naware that i've reached the point\nof that i'm going to be overwhelmed\nsooner\nrather than when it already happens so\nit requires a great deal\nof self-awareness to avoid these\nsituations\nand can you share at all like what your\nexperience of being in in a meltdown is\nlike\nit's\nit's it's like\nit's it's almost like i guess a panic\nattack well maybe not a panic attack but\nit's it's a blur right so like i i don't\nreally have any cognitive processing\nover what's going on i don't really\nunderstand what's happening\num it it just\nit it is yeah and\nyeah it's it's really hard to like\nknow what's going on in those moments um\ni try to basically it's\nit's i don't want to say it's quite like\ndrowning but i do feel like there's\nthese little moments where i can get\nthat little breath of air\nto try and move myself away from it\nso of course sorry no go for it\num and of course like like the the\nbetter i get at it\nthe more i can kind of shut those\nfeelings down which\nwould result in a shutdown which is kind\nof like\nit's it's like a momentary to pre well i\nwouldn't call it momentary but\nit's it's like this this depression or\nthis this weighted blanket\nthis sinking feeling where everything\njust becomes super muted\num usually if i into that i'm\ni'm out for like two three four hours\ni'll just end up passing out\nyeah so uh you know it's interesting\nbecause what i'm hearing from you is\nthat\nyou know it takes a lot of awareness to\nmanage you know\npreventing a meltdown but that when\nyou're actually in the meltdown you sort\nof lose yourself\nyes um and and you know sometimes on\non stream we'll kind of joke a little\nbit about becoming an\nanger elemental where like your\nyour personhood becomes like\ndominated by a particular emotion and\nthen like some\npeople will be like anger personified or\nshame\npersonified and you sort of become like\na shame elemental\nand when i'm sort of hearing from you\njust like i'm trying to put myself kind\nof in your shoes it's that like\nyou are no longer there and you're just\ndominated or overwhelmed you don't have\nparticular\ncognitions or thought processes it\nsounds like there's a lot of emotion\nthat you're experiencing\nthat's quite negative and you're not\nreally in control of your behaviors\nnecessarily either and that you kind of\nlike well\nit almost reminds me a little bit of of\nwhat i think about kind of\nphysiologically as like like a seizure\nactually so you get this high\nstate of hyper excitation\nof electrical signal followed by this\nrefractory period where everything kind\nof shuts down\nand yeah and it and it's really yeah you\nwanted to say something sorry\noh no no yeah that's that's very yes\num and so can you tell us des a little\nbit about like you said you were\ndiagnosed at the age of 29\nand and you know what growing up was\nlike what you understood autism to be\num did you recognize in some way that\nyou may not have been neurotypical or\nhow did you understand that\nsure um so in retrospect\nlike looking back years later especially\nafter my diagnosis\nmy my uncle um is\nmentally challenged and also likely\nundiagnosed with autism\num i had kind of\nput myself through through\nmy own version of aba as a kid growing\nup because\ni saw the way he was treated um\nmy he was yelled at he was kind of\nshamed he was dismissed he\nwould have love withheld from him based\non his behaviors so\nevery time i saw him walking back and\nforth i did everything i could\nto um to\navoid displaying those behaviors if you\nknow the the sound\nof a spoon on a ceramic bowl was painful\nto my ears\ni would just grin and bear it because i\ndidn't want to display\nhis behavioral characteristics and be\ntreated the\nthe same way um\nand go ahead yeah\nsorry i i keep interrupting you um it's\nokay\nso i'm just so curious what were the\nbehaviors that you noticed in your uncle\nthat you didn't want to duplicate so so\nthe the rocking back and forth\nthe specific um uh reaction that sounds\nthe way that he interpreted or\ninteracted with\nproblems um and of course that that even\nthen extended\ninto um excitement so like things like\nchristmas i\nbegan to immediately mute that behavior\nas well\nso instead of being excited about\nchristmas i was like oh it's just\nchristmas and i did this at a very young\nage\nbecause i i didn't want any of those\nassociated behaviors\nwhich is i i think what resulted in just\na lot of\nknowing and unknowing masking growing up\nas a kid i was\noriginally diagnosed with adhd in third\ngrade\nand then i i always knew something was\nwrong\ni just didn't understand what was wrong\num the best way i could describe it is i\nalways kind of felt like\neveryone knew something i didn't know\nlike i i don't know how to like like\nfully explain that but i always felt\nlike\ni always just knew something was wrong\nand it wasn't until\nlike i i graduated um college that i\nstarted to experience\num what is known as autistic burnout\nwhere\ni lost a lot of my masking and abilities\nto kind of do things things like driving\nbecame hotter\num my um i that's when i ended up\ngetting diagnosed with\nocd pure o because i was having a lot of\nintrusive thoughts very obsessive\num my anxiety started shooting through\nthe roof\num basically all the the kind of coping\nmechanisms that i had learned how to\ndeal with throughout life they\nall came crashing down which ended up\nleading to the autism diagnosis\nand then you mentioned that um you know\nyou started like muting or masking\nparticular behaviors\nit sounds like that's a pretty like\nsubconscious process\nis that fair to say uh it was both\nconscious and subconscious\num i mean i i would probably\nuh equate it to um\nlike instead of being the person to to\ntouch a hot stove to be like oh that's\nhot i used\nothers to learn that so if i saw someone\nelse treat it a certain way\ni was like okay i'm not going to be act\nthat way because i don't want to be\ntreated that way\num honestly i'd say that was kind of\nlike a lot of how i learned things was i\nhad to study other people to understand\nthose behaviors\nyeah um so let me\ndo you mind explaining what aba is\nbecause some people aren't familiar with\nthat\num so aba is a\npsychological practice it's a therapy\nwhere behaviors that are considered\nundesirable are replaced with behaviors\nthat\nare considered desirable it is i\nwouldn't say basically like dog training\nbut very similar\num that that idea of like say\nif you wanted to get a person to make\neye contact\nyou you they used to be that you would\npunish them if they didn't make eye\ncontact now that they\nthey prefer kind of just uh reward\nreinforcement\nalthough at the same time there's a lot\nof question well not a lot of questions\nit's mostly an unethical practice\nwhat um okay so let's let's take sort of\nlike\ni'm gonna table some of the stuff about\naba\ncolor the spectrum things like that i\nthink um des\nit's very helpful i personally am\nlearning a lot talking to you and i'd\nlove to just hear more of your\nraw experience because i i think you\nknow rather than using like terms and\nstuff which we can definitely get to i\nthink that the\nis like you said a lot of people with\nautism feel like\nyou know everyone else is watching a\nmovie with the volume on\nand like you can tell like you're still\nwatching the movie so you kind of know\nwhat's going on like you can kind of\nenjoy what's going on but it seems like\nthere's something that other people are\nsort of getting that you don't seem to\nhave access to\ni think that's that is such a good and\nin some ways it's also devastating to\nkind of hear people talk like that\nbut when i when i work with people with\nautism like i think that's such a\nbeautiful way to describe their\nexperience\nit's sort of like you know some people\njust seem to know things that i don't\nknow i don't know exactly what i'm\nmissing because you can try to be like\ncalculating about it right like you can\nkind of say like okay well\nit's clearly not like you know i can\nhear things and they can hear things\nit's just\nthings seem to affect me differently or\nother people\nthings seem easier for other people and\ni don't know\nwhy this has to be so hard for me\num those are kinds of the sentiments\nthat i've kind of come away with what do\nyou think\nyes i absolutely agree with that uh\nlike just everything growing up like\nmaking friends\ninteracting in school the interactions\nteachers\nlike all these individual components\nevery single aspect felt like a struggle\nbecause i\ncouldn't i couldn't connect i i\nstruggled to start making friends until\ni was\n21 22 and the way i went about it\nwas i sat down with a therapist and i\ntold my plan that i was gonna go to bars\ni was going to sit there and i was just\ngoing to\nobserve like i wouldn't have a phone or\nanything i would just sit there and\nwatch everyone\nto the point that i would become so\nbored that the\nthe act of talking with someone would\nkind of at least\ncompensate for the fear of interaction\nto some degree as well\nbut also in that time i'd be watching\nyou know\nhow the body language displayed what\ntopics were they discussing\nyou know how how did they interact you\nknow like all these little components i\nobserved all that to try and\nreplicate um like i know it\nmaybe sounds weird but the idea of like\na sociopath where it becomes all about\nmimicking the behaviors where you have\nto put all this thought into like\nokay i put my arm here this indicates\nthis behavior\nlike all those components into being\nable to start trying to develop\nfriendships\nyeah it sounds quite labor-intensive\nand is it okay if i ask you one or two\nmore questions about your uncle\nyes i i don't want to go too too\npersonal on my uncle since he's\nnot me and sure totally understand so so\nthis\num uh i'll also you know let me know i'm\ni'm\nasking for permission for a reason so\nlet me know if we skirt that boundary\nbut\nwhat i'd like to understand is like you\nknow are there particular experiences\nthat\nsee so it sounds to me like you noticed\nthat your uncle behaved in certain ways\nthat maybe you shared certain tendencies\nwith him and then you started to mask or\nmute those behaviors\ndid i understand that correctly yes and\ni was wondering if you could just\nillustrate for us like an experience\nthat you had where you saw something\nand then you recognized like oh i\nshouldn't actually act like that\num the one that oddly like the one that\nstands on\nmy mind the most which is silly um\nwas literally how he held a fork uh\nmy my grandma yelled at him something\nfierce\nlike like just just chewed him out of\nlike we were having dinner\nand just the way that he held a fork um\nbecause like he would hold the fork like\nwith his fist rather than like that\nand that that just it's forever burned\nin my memory\num i remember things like kim\ncomplaining about the noises sound and\neveryone just\ndoubling down on that sound so that like\nthey all started doing it\nlike like those little components and\nseeing how how they were\nhow he was kind of treated was\nlike i i don't remember everything since\nit was this this is\nlike i but those those are like two of\nthe things that are really just\nburned into my memory yeah i i think\nthat's that was\nexactly sort of what i was looking for\nwhen i asked the question because i\nthink\na lot of times i'm trying to imagine\nthat i'm like a 15 year old autistic kid\nright now or a kid with autism depending\non you know what\nwhat's the appropriate way to describe\nit um\nand i think the challenge is that like\nyou know when we use technical terms\nlike\nit doesn't actually capture people's\nexperience\nand and i think the way that you're kind\nof describing that like there are these\nparticular things which seem like a\nlittle bit\nyou know unique or idiosyncratic but\nthen a lot of people like really\nyou know punish people for being a\nlittle bit different\num or they don't it's just so foreign to\nunderstand\nthat like um or have you ever heard of\nmisophonia\nno so it's interesting so there's some\ncorrelation potentially between i i\ndon't know if there's some\ncorrelation but misophony is actually\nlike a\na neurological illness or disorder\nwhere benign sounds cause people like\nexcruciating pain\nand what i'm hearing from you is that\nthat there are particular sounds which\nfeel\nvery like almost painful to you and it\nreminds me of\nactually misophonia but um yeah so thank\nyou for sharing that because i think\nthat really illustrates it\nand and what did you notice about\nyourself that was different\none of the major things well it's one of\nthose things like looking back on it now\nthat you noticed that it was different\nbut like for example always wearing a\nbeanie i've always been wearing shorts\num i think i got diagnosed with sensory\nprocessing processing disorder fairly\nearly on\num i i vaguely remember going to therapy\nfor it\nuh but it's it's more of these things\nwhere you look\nback and you start to realize when\nyou're growing up as a kid you don't\nnecessarily\nnecessarily think you know oh this is\nwrong it's\nwhy is this so hard why why is it so\neasy for everyone else\nwhy can't i accomplish what they're\naccomplishing\nit's hard to realize like i i didn't\ngrow up in the the\nbest of households and for me while\ngrowing up through that i thought that\nwas normal\nit wasn't until you know even when like\nvisiting other places where it was much\nnicer and everything\ni like that was the abnormality to me it\nwasn't until i grew up\nand you know met my wife and i started\nto realize like\noh that's this this isn't normal\nand so it's it's kind of that that uh\nyou don't really notice it when you're\nin there um\ni kind of forgot the question though\nthat's totally cool i\ni i loved your answer um so let me just\nask\na different one what what uh what was\ngrowing up like for you\nit was hard um\nit was it was hard uh\nfriendships were really difficult the\nfriendships that i\ndid make often resulted in harm to\nmyself\nso um people who i hung out with\nwould end up abusing me\num like i i would i'd been hidden in the\nhead with a shovel\na razor scooter punched in the head\nrepeatedly\num i i even\ni haven't had one instance and this this\nisn't a pc gamer article so it's it's\num but i was even pissed on at one point\num\nand these were people that i considered\nfriends because you know they they\ninteracted with me and\nthat was that was rough\num i actually caught a bit of asthma\ngold's interview and i could even relate\nto some of what he was talking about\nwell he specifically referenced it as\nlaziness i.e if a light bulb goes off in\na room\nhe he was oh i just won't use that room\nanymore\num that's kind of the household that i\ngrew up in\nso like if our our sink stopped working\nwe we just used the bathroom sink\ninstead so there was a point of time\nwhere there was like five\nor seven years where um our\nour kitchen sink just wasn't used\nyeah it's it it was rough\nhow does it feel to talk about things\nlike that yes\nhonestly it feels it feels like past\ntrauma\nright where like i i went through this\ni've talked with\nwith normal like not normal\nnumerous therapists about my experiences\ngrowing up as a kid that kind of like\ntrauma and stuff and it\nit is what it is it happened\nit sucks but focus on the now\nyeah yeah i can sort of i can sort of\ndetect your\num the imprint\nof therapy and all the work that you've\ndone in the way that you talk about it\nyou know i i think that there's i'm\nhearing a lot of acceptance\ni'm not hearing a whole lot of excuses\nor defensiveness\num which is which is interesting because\na lot of times you know when people will\ntalk about\ntheir upbringing and like or the\nnegative things that potentially their\nparents or loved ones used to do there\nwill be a lot of like caveats excuses\nyou know balancing the equation oh my\nparents\ndid love me a lot things like that you\nknow and and i'm not really hearing a\nwhole lot of that from you which doesn't\nyou know i'm not getting the sense that\nyour parents were um abusive or\nneglectful i mean maybe they were but\nlike\nyou know i'm not i'm not i think it's it\nsounds like there were just a lot of\nchallenges in the household you know\nit sounds like some of your caregivers\ncould have done a better job\nit's definitely one of those tough\nthings my mom she\nsingle mom all that my my father\nuh who i actually finally got to meet\nfor the first time when i turned 30\nwhich was interesting\num he was he was in prison and stuff so\nit's\nyou know it is what it is it's best to\nfocus on the now\nbecause like you can't do anything to\nfix the pass you can do plenty to fix\nthe present\nyeah what i'm hearing is that you kind\nof spawned in a rough location\nthat that puts it well yeah actually\n[Laughter]\ndidn't really get a winning spawn there\nbut\nbut you got to play from it right like\nwherever you spawned you got to you know\nyou got to work with it absolutely and i\ni feel i am plus i mean i feel like\nwhere\nwhere i spawned uh resulted in\nme doing a lot of good yeah i mean hell\nwe've we've raised over\n50 000 for charity since i've started\nstreaming which is just\nwow that's amazing man like i never\nthought someone\nsomeone like me would be able to do so\nmuch good\nand who is someone like you\ndisabled like struggling like i've\nalways struggled to\ndo full-time employment that kind of\nthing but i've always just\nyou know i never felt like i could\nconnect or fit in or do anything\nand to suddenly be able to be like oh no\nactually you found a place where things\nare working\nand you're actually doing a really good\njob at it it\nit really changes it's one of the things\ni love about twitch\nright where in a lot of instances where\nyou struggle in the world real world\nespecially as a disabled individual\nto finally find a platform where your\ndisability isn't as much of a limiter as\nit is in reality\ni mean streaming is reality but you like\nthe\nthe real world so to speak yeah i think\nthere's a lot of interesting\nphilosophical\npoints there about you know what's the\nreal world what isn't\ni'm curious um how do you feel about the\nterm disabled\nuh i'm i'm personally fine with it i\ni i understand that there's some some\nbacklash around the\nthe word and everything but i mean\nit's hard not to refer to it as a\ndisability because i feel like it limits\nme in so many ways going for my master's\nprogram\nthat was a nightmare and\nacademia in general for for those of us\nwith with disabilities is almost an\nimpossibility\nand then adding in covet into it and i\nwas completely wrecked i\ni couldn't even i i finished my master's\nprogram with the 4.0 but i couldn't\nfinish writing my thesis\nbecause everything changed and i just\nit was like there it just slipped\nthrough my hands\ninteresting what what's made it hard can\nyou help us understand like you said\nyou've struggled to maintain full-time\nemployment what's made that hard\num a lot of it\nis focusing\nand maintaining a lot of the\ninteractions the\nthe social interactions everything that\ngoes in at work understanding like the\nthe the hierarchy and the systems that\nare there and the clerks and the groups\nin office politics that's what they're\ncalled like like\nnavigating through all that was it\nbasically felt impossible um\nthere are certain tasks that you're\nexpected to be able to complete like\ntalking on a phone um i've learned\nways around it but it's difficult still\ni really really really really hate\nphones i do not like phones they are\nsuch a just overwhelming sensory\nespecially phones ringing\nand then of course you know like like\nsometimes because a lot of workplaces\nthey don't give you\nyou space you're all kind of in like uh\nenclosed so\nthings like um like i used to have\na a co-worker who would like\nspam click their mouse to activate their\ncomputer they're just like\nclick click click click click i could\nnot get any work done\ni would have i would have noise\ncancelling headphones and everything\nor you know people come up behind you\nstart having full count conversations\nthere are so many components in\na workplace that you know neurotypicals\nor just\nnormal individuals would be like oh\nwhatever like oh i can just cancel that\ni\ni can't um and\nthere there's also like when when i\nreach these points of where i'm\ncompletely overwhelmed like\nhey if i keep pushing myself i'm going\nto have a meltdown\nwork tends to not be a place where you\ncan go ahead and get the flexibility\nnecessary for that um and that that's\nagain one of the things that i love\nabout streaming\nis it's like hey i've reached i'm like\nnearing that point where i'm overwhelmed\ni'm going to have a meltdown\nand i can just stop like it's\nsorry go ahead and i don't know i was\ngonna say have you played darkest\ndungeon\ni have not i've always wanted to but i\ni've never actually started\nit it's interesting because here i've\nnever used a darkest dungeon analogy on\nstream before but hearing kind of like\nyour workplace environment like i don't\nknow if you\nare familiar with the mechanics but you\nknow you have an hp pool like any other\nrpg\nand then like essentially magic does\nstress damage\nand so this is like a reverse hp pool\nwhere like it goes from zero to 200 and\nif you hit 200 you die\nand then like once you hit 100 like your\ncharacter gets like a pretty significant\ndebuff\nwhat i'm almost hearing from you is that\nthere's like this stress like it's just\nlike darkest dungeon where\nthere's stuff that like racks up your\nstress and then if it hits a certain\npoint\nlike you have a meltdown and you can\neven\nkind of use a lot of your like cognitive\nenergy or mana pool\nto like suppress or like\nkind of keep that stuff buried but it's\nstill like building up in the background\nand if you force yourself into these\nsituations\nyou can kind of last for some amount of\ntime but i\nit sounds like you know that meltdown or\nburnout as you mentioned\nyou mentioned something about like\ncoping mechanism burn out\num i i forget what the term you used but\nyou said that you had like\nthe all of your autistic burnout yeah\num and and so it's it's bizarre but\nthat's kind of what i'm hearing is that\nkind of fair\nthat like you could manage it for a\nwhile but it really wouldn't get better\nand then you\nsort of it was too much for you to\nhandle yes\ni think that's a good comparison um\nspecifically like it it's\nwe can kind of push ourselves and this\nis one of the things that i had to learn\nin my my master's program is how often i\nhad to say no\nbecause if we push ourselves like i\ni don't like hitting myself in the head\nlike it's it's\none it's it's not a pretty thing to see\nand two\nit's not very good for myself and so\ni i had to start learning to say no more\noften\neven though like i wanted right like i\nwanted to play everything i wanted to\nget my master's degree i wanted to to\nsucceed in academia\ni i understood that i\ni had to just stop otherwise like it\nwould just get worse\nand worse and these these meltdowns like\nthe the more i have them the more i push\nmyself\nthe the worse that it would get yeah\ndes what's it like to want something so\nmuch and not be able to\ndo it\nit sucks um i think we can all kind of\nrelate to that\num but i think it's also something that\nwe all have to come to terms with\nthat the the notion that we can become\nanything\nisn't a reality and that sometimes it's\nbest to pay attention to what we can do\nand to strengthen that rather than\nclimb an impossible wall and i know that\ni\ni can you know get my masters i can get\nmy doctorates but it's going to be about\nfinding\num finding a program and\nthing that works with me\ndesk bro i think how did you learn that\nbecause i think like 99 of people out\nthere like\narguably myself included you know\nhave trouble learning the lesson of like\ni want this so much but i may not be\nable to get it\nhow do you believe me acceptance believe\nme once you punch yourself\nin the head enough times you learn\n[Laughter]\num seriously though like like when when\nyou\nreach those points where you you feel\nyourself breaking you realize\nsomething's going to to give right\nand i i think that's kind of one of the\nat least the the positive things\nis um learning that\nit was like i can't keep doing this i\ngot to find another way\nthe best way to describe my experiences\nis\nit's like trying to kool-aid man through\na bunch of walls and eventually you\ncan't kool-aid through the wall so you\nhave to find a way around it\nyeah and yeah beautifully sad\nyes you know it's it's also kind of\ninteresting\nlet me just think about this because you\nmentioned the cycle which i think is\nreally important to understand\num which is like you know once you\nkool-aid man through a wall or\nor you know once you fail it's something\nthat you really want\nit actually causes you to try to\nkool-aid your way through more walls\nright you dig deeper there's some amount\nof\nshame there's some amount of lack of\nacceptance there's some amount of\nattachment and wanting it\nthat you kind of like you like burn out\neven more\nlike you try even harder you dig deeper\nyou push yourself more\nbecause that's what we're sort of taught\nto do right like don't ever give up\nand where there's a will there's a way\nand then so then what happens is\nand the the crazy thing is that you can\nkool-aid your way through a wall right\nyou can smash through things\nby digging deep and then what happens is\npeople like\nthey dig deep and then they like they do\nit they sort of succeed\neven though they're like cannibalizing\nthemselves from the inside\nand then they say okay this works right\nbecause then they've been able to do it\nand then they got what they wanted and\nthey're sort of not really paying\nattention to the cost and then they\nthink to\nthemselves oh i can do this this is\npossible\nand that's almost what i find to be like\nthe most damning thing because it's sort\nof like yeah it's possible but\nwhat did you have to pay you know what's\nthe price that you pay\nto get to where you are and then if they\nfail again the whole cycle repeats and\nthey're like oh\nif i had dug deeper if i had sacrificed\nmore if i had done more\nif i wasn't just so messed up like if if\nall of these things and then like the\ncycle repeats and it repeats and repeats\nand what i'm curious about is you know\nwhen\nwhen you are able to push yourself and\nactually accomplish things\nand then like when you fail and you sort\nof like how did you get get out of that\ncycle you know like because i i can sort\nof see it going both ways one which is\nlike\nyou need to do better if you did better\nyou could do it\nversus recognizing oh actually like\nmaybe i can't do that\nyeah it's it's it's really hard to say\nhonestly the best way like the\nthe past ever since the diagnosis which\nis it's been almost\nfour years now i feel especially like\nevery well\nhonestly the past five years have been a\nblur like ever since i graduated college\neverything's just kind of\nit's it's i don't know like the the\nthe ability to grasp like what's\nhappened\nfeels less tangible than it did when i\nwas younger\nbut what i do know is each time i reach\nthe breaking point each time i hit a\nwall\num it got harder and harder to kind of\nbreak through and to keep going\nand i i know that\neventually i was it was hurting myself\nto to just\nbash into the wall and so i\nhad to i had to start thinking about it\nmore critically i had to look at the\nwall\nand you know sometimes there there\nactually happens to be a door right next\nto the wall\nsometimes i sometimes i have to\nto you know maybe get scaling gear or\nyou know whatever their various option\nbecause i\nwas literally like i was literally\nkilling myself so to speak by constantly\nrunning into these walls\ni think one of the the things that makes\nit more apparent for those of us with\ndisabilities\nis that we run into them more frequently\nwhich\nthe more frequently that you run into it\nyou're going to be more aware\nyeah whereas if it happens like you know\nevery six months every year\nyou might fall into that same trap where\nyou you i just gotta dig deeper i just\ngotta dig deeper\nso i really think that contributed a lot\nis that it's that\nwhen you have these problems you run\ninto them more frequently and\nyou learn faster so to speak yeah that's\nit's so wise and also a little bit\ndamning because\nkind of what i'm hearing for your answer\nis like you know oh des like how did you\nguys\nyou know figure out how to wipe rag i\nmean\nhow to down ragnaros and it's like yeah\ni wiped a whole lot\nlike other people may wipe every six\nmonths to a year but i wiped like\nonce a week and and it's really hard to\nsay but\nto listen to and to really think about\nbut i i do think that there's a lot of\nvalue to sort of like\nrecognizing that maybe you're just like\nmore experienced at wiping\nand and i don't know what that means for\npeople who are neurotypical who\nencounter things\nless frequently but i'm certainly\ndetecting a lot of like\nyou know awareness on your part and and\ncritical thinking and sort of\nrecognizing who you are accepting\nyourself for who you are\num separating out maybe what you should\nbe\nfrom what you are\nand i think in in some ways it sounds\nlike you started that process very young\nbecause you noticed when you were young\nthat like you were different from other\npeople\nabsolutely um what have been\nhow did you feel about getting an autism\ndiagnosis or what was that like for you\nto get diagnosed with autism it was a\nmajor relief to be honest\num it was it was a struggle\nuh the the therapist and kind of\neverything\nthey don't like diagnosing adults i was\nautistic\num they they don't really see or at\nleast my therapist didn't really see\nthat the resources were\nuseful to diagnosing an autistic adult\num that you were seen as like taking\nresources away from autistic children\nthat that's something that could be you\nknow benefiting someone that they could\nhelp\nbecause once you're an adult there's\nthere's no support network there's\nnothing that can really be\ndone um which is part of what led me\ninto charity because that's that's\nliterally horrifying to realize\nokay you invest so heavily in autistic\nchildren\nand then it's just like well it's\nsomeone else's problem now\nright it's like building a beautiful\ngarden\nand it's like ah we'll let the weeds\ntake over right like it just it makes no\nsense\nso getting that diagnosis not only gave\nme\nease of mind and understanding of who i\nwas\nbut it also connected me with the\nautistic community being able to connect\nwith other autistics that have had\nsimilar experiences\nto be able to to be a part of a network\nwhere i finally\nfelt a sense of belonging which like i\ni think a lot of that that um\nthat psychological usefulness is missed\nin these diagnosis because they're\nthere's it's super important\nit's really important to be able to have\nthat connection to have that belonging\nto know that you're not alone to go from\nfeeling like\nthere there's no one else like you no\none else going through the problems that\nyou're going through\nto someone like holy [ __ ] there's\nthere's other people out there that\nthat understand yeah\nsounds like you had felt alone for a\nlong time and now\ni'm sort of hearing you say a lot about\nbeing able to connect to other people\nbut\ni other people i've worked with have\nalso sort of emphasized that\nthey had a reason for why\nthings were that the way they were right\nbecause people like\nmy experience with people with autism\njust listening to them is they just feel\nso broken like arbitrarily because it's\nnot there isn't like a diagnosis or\nreason or rhyme\nlike you're just you're just bad at\nmaking friends\nthere's like something fundamentally\nbusted\nand you just suck at it there's no like\nexplanation there's no reason there's no\nlike\nyou know and and and for some people who\nget an autism diagnosis they sort of\nunderstand that\nwhat i have always experienced which is\nthat it's hard for me to live life like\nneurotypical people do\nactually has like a neurological or\nneuroscientific correlation to it\nthere are parts of my brain that\nliterally function\nin a different way from like what a\nneurotypical person's brain functions\nlike\nand so it's not like some kind of moral\ndeficiency\nor being weak or just sucking or like\na charisma stat that's like low\nit's that you're wired differently\ndid that sort of have an impact for you\nin that way or was it mostly about\nconnection\nuh no definitely like finally having\nthat answer and understanding\num absolutely like i focus on the\nconnection because i i think that's a\nreally\nimportant thing because i i think many\nof us with autism\nwe desperately want social connection\nthat was like one of the\nbig misunderstandings that i had about\nautism before getting my diagnosis\nwas that if if\nyou wanted to have friends if you wanted\nthat social interaction that you\ncouldn't be autistic\nbecause autistics weren't weren't\nsociable\nwhich it's simply not the case and there\nwas there was like a lot of these kind\nof\num this misinformation out there\nthat i had to search through to better\nunderstand\nwhat autism was when i went to seek my\nmy diagnosis\nand and can you help us understand a\nlittle bit about the sort of this\ni can imagine it's tricky because on the\none hand it can be hard to make social\nconnections\nand wanting social connections and what\nit's like kind of swimming through those\nwaters\na lot of it like one of the big things\nthat i struggled with growing up as a\nkid\nis noticing when i was being annoying\nright\nlike i would talk about something i'm\nvery passionate about something that i\ncare about\nand realizing that the other person was\nannoyed bored or\nwhatever in trying to like now\nnow like i have all this anxiety and i'm\nlike i'm constantly watching like facial\ninteractions i'm watching body language\nlike there's this huge anxiety where i'm\nlike okay i need to change the subject\nto the point that even\neven if someone is enjoying the\nconversation\ni'm ready to jump that like that\nconversation like wait i've been talking\nabout this for three four or five\nminutes okay i need to change subject\neven if they are liking it because it's\nit's almost like the script that plays\nin my head\num yeah like like a lot of those that\nkind of like\ntrying to figure it out was just it was\nconstant like okay i didn't get the\nreaction i wanted or\nokay this didn't happen the way it was\ntry again let's change one thing i mean\ni i definitely relied on science on like\nthings like scientific method\nto to be able to go and experiment and\nlike okay we'll try this one little\ntweak we'll try this week we'll try this\ntweak until i ended up with a script\nthat was somewhat successful\nyeah it sounds very intensive\nfrom an energy standpoint yes it's\nit can be exhausting yeah and and that\nyou know once you came up with your\nalgorithm that like even if\nthe conversation organically didn't\nrequire a shift\nthere's a part of your brain that has\nlearned that after four minutes about\ntalking about a subject the safest thing\nto do is to switch the subject\nyes yeah and but really\nand i i know you use the term\nsociopathic but i i think um\nyou know i think that somewhat apples\nand oranges but\ni am hearing a lot that you make like a\nlot of your\nsocial interactions are calculated and\nand not out of a desire to like take\nadvantage of anyone but just because i\ni think what i'm also hearing from you\nand this is my experience working with\npeople with autism is that\nyou know some of the empathic circuitry\nthat allows people to like\nnaturally like know how to swim is\nis not quite intact and so you have to\nrely you have to figure out other ways i\ni just had another analogy which maybe\nis devastating and offensive\nbut sort of like a duck without feathers\nyou're still a duck but like some of the\nthings that you\nnormally allow you to float like you\nhave to learn how to like swim\nin a different way\nand and so it sounds it sounds really\ntough man\nyeah you mentioned specifically about\nnot trying to take advantage of others i\ngrowing up before i knew i was autistic\nthat was one of the big things that i\ndealt with a lot\nwas um like because of how i approached\neverything and thinking about it to try\nand elicit specific responses\ni i like i had this this big fear\nthat i was deliberately trying to take\nadvantage of people\nright because it was literally how i had\nto solve all of my problems like i had\nto do this like this\nthis component that came so natural to\neveryone else\ni had to go all this deliberate and like\nthinking about each of these components\nwhere i literally felt like i was\nmanipulating others\nand it it sucked it definitely had a\nhuge kind of\nnegative mental toll i can completely\nunderstand that i think\nunfortunately um you know that's not\nnecessarily the case and i've i've met\num a ton of people who\nare very emotionally like not overly\ncognitive\nand at the same time are also incredibly\nmanipulative\nlike it's not that thinking very\ncognitively about social\ninteractions makes you manipulative or\nnot i've seen you know both versions of\nthat\nand and des i'm curious you mentioned\nthat you're you're married\nyes can you tell us a little bit about\nhow that happened because i know that's\nsomething that's very anxiety provoking\nfor\na lot of people with autism like\nromantic relationships\nso i actually it's it's kind of silly i\nkind of fell into my lap so to speak\num i i didn't\nreally have any relationship experience\nuntil\ni was 22\nwhen i was 22 i um\ni i this this sounds really bad\nuh i basically found a situation where i\ncould rely on my looks\nto be able to bypass romantic or\nthe the kind of romantic interactions to\nlose my virginity\num so i had to go through this this kind\nof like cold calculation to be able to\nfind myself in a position to be able to\nto go through that because i wanted to\nto solve that problem i'm sorry i'm\nlooking at chat\nyes you can't look at chad from\nsorry everyone wants to know how you did\nit\ni want to know but you can't look at\nchat you're on a roll\nwhen you're socially awkward and you're\nnot even if you're not neurotypical\nimagine all the neurotypical people with\nsocial anxiety who think that they're in\ncells and aren't even on the spectrum\nand here you have the answer for them\nand you get distracted by chat\njust let's put it on the adhd part as\nwell\num but yeah it is\num so that that whole situation i\ni basically it kind of allowed me to\ni don't know i've admit my way through\nit so\nlike like relationships are really like\nfine tasks where you need like\nyou know like you need to be able to\nlike\nbe able to move everything just right\nfor it to go through\nand i specifically reference oven mitt\nbecause that's what it feels like\ninteracting with social circumstances\nit's this very\num texturous fine-tuned interaction and\nwe have oven mitts\nso it feels really hard to to be able to\npiece through that\nand it it worked i\nlike looking back on it i feel bad\nbecause it definitely feels like a\nsituation where\ni may have manipulated someone\num into a romantic relationship in order\nto\num meet that right it's it's not\na it's not a nice thing\nat least i don't consider it a nice\nthing um\nbut it allowed me to kind of get past\nthat that\nbig fear when you're a virgin which is\nwhat happens when you do get to that\npoint right it completely\nchanged the kind of dialogue and\ninteraction for me\nuh can you help me understand i i i\ni find myself being curious about you\nknow what\nyeah i just have so many questions like\ncan you just share more about that\ni'm serious because i like i i think you\nknow\ndoing something because you want to get\nlaid like i can sort of understand where\nyou're coming from there but i think\njust as equally as important is like\nillustrating or helping people\nunderstand what felt unethical about\nfor you about that what felt\nmanipulative for you how you came to\nthat realization\ni feel like there's actually a lot of\nall the memes and stuff aside\ni think there's there's a lot of\nimportant wisdom here\nso mainly what made it feel manipulative\nis for the individual like i i didn't\nreally care specifically about them that\nit was\nkind of a means to an end\ni mean they they were obviously\ninterested and wanted to engage in\neverything so it was\nmutual but for me my\nunderstanding of sexual interaction has\nalways been based around things like\nlove right that that very romantic\nnature\nso utilizing it to\nnot utilizing love but utilizing sex to\nkind of\nunderstand was\nethically problematic to me i think um\ninteresting because you know to play\ndevil's advocate for a second i mean you\nwere the one who was there so i\nbut i'm sort of you know my\nunderstanding\nof of sex and love is that the two don't\nnecessarily have to go hand in hand\nand that especially if you're a 22 year\nold you know like\na little bit of figuring it out as long\nas and it sounds like the other person\nwas like interested in consenting and\nall\nyou know that's that's the really\nimportant stuff to me but you know i\ni i want to say that like i don't want\nto discourage people from\nfiguring it out because at 22 you're not\ngoing to know exactly what the\nrelationship is between sex and love\nright right you're just not and and so i\ni'm not hearing anything\nso far that seems kind of unethical to\nme\nexcept maybe some expectations that you\nhad but or that you you maybe were not\nthat much like\npotentially romantically into this\nperson but\num i i feel like i utilized them not for\nsex\nbut for what sex meant which is why i\nthink this became\na little bit more unethical to me\noh no it's one of those things where\nwhen you're 22\num it makes\nsense but like looking back on it i i\nbasically\ntreated it kind of like a science\nexperiment\nrather than like the the kind of like\nsexual experience\nright it was about seeing what it was\nabout getting through that and kind of\nremoving it as\na factor rather than\num\nrather than just trying to get laid\ninteresting okay\nand how did you meet your you said that\nyour current relationship sort of fell\ninto your lap\nso i i met um i met my wife\nthrough a friend that i was able to make\nthanks to you know sitting in bars\nconstantly watching language\nuh turns out they were like a big metal\nhead so we we\noh god it was amazing like finally this\nwas one of those scripts where i didn't\nhave to change the conversation every\nfour minutes\nwe would talk about metal for like hours\nand hours and hours like uh we love\nmetal um but\neventually he told me about this this\ngirl that he had met she was getting her\nbachelor's in neuroscience\ni wanted to get my bachelor's in\nneuroscience\nand so we we um we started talking on\nfacebook\nall that she was currently seeing\nsomeone else\nand you know as we talked more and more\ni\num i i basically just laid out my\nfeelings for her and talked like you\nknow about how\nlike i i cared for her and all that um\nand things just ended up working out she\nended up breaking up with the\nthe other guy who happened to be super\nabusive um\nwe we shared our first kiss august 11th\num and it is\ni don't know like i think because i\nspent so much time\nanalyzing every single situation having\nto be super aware\nof where i was cognitively where i was\nemotionally\nactually ended up preparing me for that\nrelationship\nso when we ended up in this i was very\nquick to\ni was very quick to be like hey this is\nproblematic or\nhey this is bothering me or hey i don't\nlike this\nand we would actually talk about things\nbefore they became a problem\num i i definitely do see like a lot of\nmy experiences as an autistic having\nbeen beneficial even unknowingly\nbecause of how much i had to rely on\nobserving literally every single detail\nyeah it sounds like you know i'm i'm\npurposely avoiding chat\nbecause i can only imagine you know all\nthe messages about\nyour autism and chadness rolled into one\nbut i i think it's great because i think\nit sort of illustrates something really\nreally important which is that\num what i'm really hearing from you is\nthat you took a lot of risks right so i\ni'm\nnot when you sort of confessed your\nfeelings for her had y'all met in person\num we we had men in person um we had met\na couple of times\nuh and this is still when i was trying\nto figure out how relationships worked\nso you know like the whole you know oh\nyou should you should ignore women that\nmakes them want you like like all those\nkind of like\nreally kind of crappy information that's\nout there for when you're young\nin trying to somehow cipher wisdom from\nall of that\nin in some form to interact in\nrelationship\nand so what do you think is useful\nto make a relationship so it sounds like\ny'all are married now\nyes um i i honestly i got lucky\ni'm gonna be real honest i like i don't\nknow how it happened\nit's it's like it's like doing that jump\nin a video game you do it once and you\nhave no idea how you did it and you can\nnever do it again\nthat that is literally like it's just\neverything lined up\ni i don't know um but what i will say\nas far as it lasting we've been married\nfor\nover we've been together eight years\nwe've been married six\num communication is so incredibly\nimportant\nis if the other if the other person\ndoesn't know where you're\nat they can't work with you\nand she didn't know i was autistic when\num we we got married and all that we\ndidn't find out until years later\nand there were points where you know it\nlooked like we might get divorced but\nhaving a conversation around there and\nunderstanding like yeah this is this\nsucks this is problematic we weren't\nquite expecting this\nbut um we got through it\nbecause we we talked we understand she\nknows how much i love her how much i\ncare about her\num i i do what i can to try and\nhelp out even though i struggle in so\nmany other ways like\nbeing being married to someone who isn't\nable to to bring in like full-time work\nor isn't able to bring in lots of money\nis difficult but\num communication really helps\nyeah i'm glad you said that because i\nthink that's what i'm hearing is\ndifferent\num so i i think that you know sometimes\npeople feel like they don't\nthey can't bring value to a relationship\nand i know you say\nfrankly it was luck or so therefore it\nwas rng\nand i certainly feel the same way about\nmy relationship in terms of getting\nreally really lucky\nbut i do think that you know there are a\nlot of really interesting things kind of\nobjectively\ndes about your relationship and how it\nevolved and i think there are a lot of\nlessons to take away for people\nso here's what i'm hearing you you know\nthis is this is what your character\nsheet shows right\nso you were born with the autism trait\nwhich is like\ncomes with like charisma penalties and\nand things like that\nlike it's hard for you to socially\ninteract with people it can be really\nchallenging and let me know if this\nsounds offensive at some point okay um\nand then also that like\nsome of your disability prevents you\nfrom doing things like working full-time\nand things like that and so\non paper you know i think a lot of\npeople will look at that and will say\nlike if if people are in your shoes like\ni could only imagine\nbeing you know a 24 year old person with\nautism who's unable to\nhold a full-time job and to think to\nmyself\nthat i'm not worthy of having a\nrelationship i can't ever be in a\nrelationship\nand yet what i'm hearing from you is\nthat ultimately like you can actually\nhave a very successful relationship\nand that as important and as it's hard\nright so there's some amount of shame\nand expectation and societal stuff and\nwhatnot\nbut at the end of the day that like\ncommunicating with your partner and like\nletting people know where you're at\nletting people like owning up to what\nyour shortcomings are and trying to\nsupport them the best that you can that\nlike\nyou can talk about things and like let\npeople know where you're at\nand and i think another thing that\nyou're not really mentioning i'd imagine\nyou're very good at listening\nand also like you know what people\nsometimes what\nthe the trickiest thing that i see in\nterms of like marriage counseling i\ndon't do a whole lot of it\nis that a lot of people make sacrifices\nand then feel resentful and then their\npartner says\ni never asked you to make that sacrifice\nright so like i'll make a big sacrifice\nand then i'll feel owed\nbecause i made this big sacrifice and\nthen the person on the other side of the\ntable is like\ni never asked that of you and then we\nget into this really tricky impasse\nbecause\nyou know one partner feels really owed\nbecause they've given something up\nand then on the other side the other\npartner was like i didn't buy that thing\nso i don't owe you anything\nyou know i never asked for that\nsacrifice and so what i'm kind of\nhearing from you i'm reading between the\nlines here is that i think you guys\nprobably did a really good job\nit's not about making the sacrifice or\nnot making the sacrifice or being able\nto be full-time employed or having\nautism or not having autism\nit's about ultimately being on the same\npage about where you guys are whether\nit's in a good place or a bad place\nand i'm hearing you say that you know\nyou all have talked about divorce which\nsounds like\nvery understandable because it sounds\nlike there are a lot of challenges\nthat you all face in your relationship\njust like any other relationship and\nthat\nyou guys have an additional layer of\nchallenge because on some level\nyou know there are a lot of things that\nsociety expects from you that you may\nnot be able to do and let me know if\nthis feels mean\nat some point i'm not really i think\nit's it actually is like a shining\nexample\nof how so many of what we assume about a\nsuccessful relationship\ni don't think is actually what makes a\nsuccessful relationship\nit's not having a particular career it's\nnot it's like really about being on the\nsame page and it doesn't it sort of\ndoesn't matter\nlike i mean it matters but to me the\nmost\ncrucial thing i've seen you know two\nneurotypical people who have successful\ncareers and are very charismatic\nwho have gotten divorced and i think the\nproblem is like they're not on the same\npage\nand i've seen a lot of people who feel\nhopeless because of certain\ndisadvantages they have that they're\nunable to find love\nor sex but what i'm really hearing from\nyou is that like\nyou know that it's possible to have both\nof those things as long as you really\nfocus on\nself-awareness attending to another\nperson's needs\nbeing somewhat transparent about what\nyour needs are these are the kinds of\nthings that i i'm really hearing have\nled to your success\nwhat do you think uh absolutely i i\nthink\nspending so much time observing studying\nbeing aware of recognizing i i think all\nthese things have played\nan important and critical role in my own\nsuccess with relationships\num i mean it's it's like any subject the\nmore you study it the better you get at\nit you might not\num like like i i didn't i didn't just\ni wasn't suddenly born with my\nunderstanding of neuroscience i had to\nstudy it i had to go through i had to\ntake classes\nand then you know i was able to actually\nstart to understand it\nand so for a lot of\nnormal individuals out there they might\nhave all this understanding already kind\nof pre-built in\nwhereas for for myself i had to study it\nand study and study and\ni think it paid off yeah\nwell said yes um so\ni had a couple of other like so i i\nreally appreciate everything you've\nshared with us i'd love to hear a little\nbit about\naba activism what's going on with with\nautism if you want to talk about that\num you know i think there are a couple\nof other things that you mentioned which\ni think are like really really\nimportant for people to hear like this\nconcept of love being withheld based on\nyour behaviors\nis there a particular direction you want\nto take things yes\num so i'm like this is this is a really\nimportant conversation for the autistic\ncommunity\nsince aba is is generally considered\nabuse by our community\num and on the idea of like the old\nschool aba being a way of withholding\nlove withholding attention with holding\ncertain characteristics and why i\ncompared earlier\nlike giving myself aba um for for those\nasking by what aba is\nit's it's basically um\nput the simplest way not to to downgrade\nwhat it is or to downgrade ourselves\nit's it's pavlovian right whereas like\nyou give a reward or you give a negative\nresponse to elicit a specific response a\nspecific behavior\nand in the instance where i was talking\nearlier about with my uncle\nis my uncle would do an action um i\nrespond negatively to the um\nclinking noise of a ball right my\nresponse would be\nokay i'm not going to react to that\nbecause i don't want that added\nthat added pain because they'll keep\nclanking the ball\nin a nearest response to this annoyance\nso that is a negative reinforcement that\ntells me not to elicit that behavior\nthis is similar to what we've seen in a\nlot of aba it's changed since then\ni've been told um but there's\nstill a lot of problems especially like\npositive reinforcement can still be\nproblematic if you're getting a behavior\nto respond that causes harm\nfor example i once had\na meltdown not one that resulted in me\nhitting myself but i threw my phone and\nended up running into a wall because a\nprofessor touched the lip of my cam\nso i had a can um and their their hand\ntouched the\nthe part where you drink from which\ncaused me to become everywhere\nvery overwhelmed it's something that's\nvery stressful and\nand painful for me but aba would see\nthis behavior as problematic\nand would expose me to it constantly\nuntil i didn't respond\nin a negative way\nso what what what's\nwhat is the problem you see with that um\nuh it elicits pain\nas a way of um\nno longer performing that behavior\nrather than acknowledging the the needs\nof the individual and what is going on\ni you know ask the person to move the\ncan\nversus moving the can yourself\nit it puts the burden on the autistic\nto suffer rather than creating a\nsituation where no one\nis suffering that's a good point i'm not\nsure if people were\num yeah so so that that's a good point\nso\ncan i share like a similar experience\nthat i've had sort of\nas a treatment professional go ahead so\ni was working with uh\na young guy with misophonia so\nmisophonia is a neurological disorder\nwhere like\nsomething is messed up where so normally\nwhen we hear a sound like you know sound\nhits our eardrum\nand then that you know the sound travels\nvia a neuron to our auditory cortex\nthen travels to our auditory association\ncortex\nso like i'm able to hear sounds but if i\nuse\nwords for example your brain does not\ninterpret words as sounds it interprets\nwords\nas words so that comes from your\nauditory association cortex so something\nis\ni we don't know exactly what happens in\nmisophonia but there are some\nsounds that elicit like pain like so\ninstead of\nyou know like this hearing a particular\nsound\nis like the experience of like rubbing\nyou know like this person described it\nto me as like\nrubbing like an open wound with\nsandpaper\nand so like literally sounds will hurt\nthem\nand so the interesting thing this is\nunfortunately this person is is older\nnow\nand so like back in the day they went to\ngo see a neurologist\nwho would essentially do exposure\ntherapy\nand was like focused on like making this\nperson more resilient\nand they're like you know much like\nexposure therapy like what we're gonna\ndo is expose you to the sound\nuntil your neurons acclimatize to it\nand so what this person sort of\ndiscovered is that like they didn't\never acclimatize to it because it's sort\nof like you know it doesn't matter how\nmany times you get\nkicked in the nuts like it's gonna hurt\nevery time there's no like acclimatizing\nto getting kicked in the nuts\nand so the bizarre thing that the reason\nthey wound up in my office is they were\nso\ntraumatized by the treatment\nthat they sort of developed ptsd and a\npersonality disorder\nas a result like chronic ptsd so to see\nptsd personality disorder it sort of\ncompletely changed the way that they\nlike interacted with like\nso like they started to think of like\ndoctors and parents\nlike it was really confusing because\nthey understood oh this doctor is trying\nto help me and like my parents are\ntrying to help me but like\nthey're hurting me a ton and they won't\nstop and they won't stop ever\nand they they tell me that every time i\nget hurt that like i need to be stronger\nand it completely reshaped the way that\nthey looked at their\nlike important relationships caused a\nton of problems\nand i think the re the way we were able\nto make progress is through recognizing\nthat\nyou know early on when you were like six\nyears old\nthese people who were supposed to\nprotect you actually would like take you\nonce a week\nand rub sandpaper over your open wounds\nand what do you think that does to a\nchild\nwhen it happens like clockwork once a\nweek\nfor an hour for a decade\nand and it's really kind of terrifying\nthat like a lot of times i think\nunfortunately as treatment professionals\nthere's a lot of iatrogenic which means\nlike you know treatment-induced\ninjury um and it's really sad\nbut just uh you know i get what you're\nsaying\ni i didn't i didn't realize this about\naba though so\nit's good to know yes there there's been\ntalks about changes i um recently read\nan article that came out in 2021\num and from there like the argument that\naba has changed\nit's still argued as unethical because\nthe practitioners are\nare working outside of their scope as\nwell i.e that they're not\nexperts on autism in that to treat\na neurological disorder from a\npsychological perspective is also\ntroublesome\nbecause it's it's not\nit can't be solely confined by behavior\nso\nit's kind of outside of the scope of the\nindividual to not\nhave experience with autism\num like like to actually be like an\nexpert on nazism so they can't even\nnotice\nlike if the autistic individual is\nin pain right because we we don't\ndisplay\nour our pain we don't display our trauma\nin the same way that\nneurotypical individuals will so it's\nvery problematic to say that well\nthey're not\nthey're not being hurt it's like anyone\ncan say that it's like well\nthey're not being hurt it it doesn't\nmean that you can't\nall right just because you can't see it\ndoesn't mean it's not there\nyeah i mean don't get me started there\nbecause it's\nit's like such an uphill battle to try\nto explain to people\nwho think that they're experts that\nthey're not experts\nlike the one lesson that i've come away\nwith\nuh desk like just personally as a\nclinician is that i can have all the\ntraining in the world\nbut every person i meet is an individual\nand when i run into trouble is when i\nstart\nwhen i start thinking about myself as an\nexpert\nand when someone comes to me and says\nyou don't know what you're talking about\nlike i've learned how to listen to what\nthey're saying\nno matter where i trained no matter how\nmuch experience i have\nbecause this is the bizarre thing about\nmedicine is like you know we we\nuse like these protocols and paradigms\nbut like literally\nevery human being is unique and so i\ndon't know\nis a system of medicine why we don't\nsort of like\nacknowledge or factor that into our\nday-to-day\noperations but i think it's really hard\nto explain to people\nwho believe themselves to be experts\nthat\nyou know you may not know as much as you\nthink there's a lot of like\nprofessional hubris certainly within\nmedicine\ni think we see it a lot in in especially\nunfortunately in mental health\nbecause you'll have a lot of people who\nare you know\ni i think i i have a bias here so you\nknow i have to kind of share that but\nit's my belief that a lot of our mental\nhealth is actually physical in nature\num there's a lot of evidence of this\nnowadays but if you look at like for\nexample you mentioned the fight or\nflight response right that's a\nphysiologic response\nand so i i don't know how much therapy\nis gonna help i i mean i think therapy\ncan help a lot with that kind of stuff\nbut\ni think that therapists if they ignore\nthe physiologic component of your\nyour autistic meltdown they're gonna be\ndoing you a disservice\nthe challenge is that most therapists\nare not trained in physiology\num right and and we see this a lot too\nin terms of\nof physical medicine as well where\nmedical doctors\nwho are not trained in psychology will\nlike ignore the symptoms of their\npatients because they think that they're\npsychological\nso like everyone's guilty of it you have\nmedical doctors that are ignoring the\npsychological component and you have\npsychologists who are ignoring the\nphysical component\num and and i think that unfortunately\nlike the problem is like the person who\ngets screwed is the patient\num which is sad and and i i've just seen\na lot of professional hubris like\nand i don't think it helps people like i\ndon't think it does right by our\npatients\nso i don't know what i'm trying to say\nthere but no\ni i i completely understand what you're\nwhat you're getting across\nit definitely is a problematic situation\nit there was something i actually i\nwanted to say on that too that was\nreally really important oh\nno damn it this is this is the problem\nwith the adhd brain as well we have that\nthought\nbut we didn't write it down so it's just\nit's gone well next time just interrupt\ni know you've trained see i've been\ntaught not to interrupt that i know it's\nthe problem\nso i know you've trained yourself not to\nbut like i think next time interrupt\nyou know i guess um let me try to run\nthrough the sequence so we were talking\na little bit about\nand see if we can catch it again even if\nit slipped away so\nuh you had talked a little bit about how\naba is still unethical\ni shared the story about misophonia how\na lot of times\ntreatment can actually be like\niatrogenically injuring\nthat we're trying to help people and we\nactually end up hurting them instead\num and then i talked i ranted a little\nbit about professional hubris and a big\nproblem that i see in sort of mental\nhealth treatment which is that\nuh you know meant yeah there you go\nautonomy\nautonomy it's the idea that\nthose with mental health issues don't\nhave it\nand so that these experts feel\nlike they have a power of authority\nover the individual because they\nthey're not as seen as having autonomy\nit's one of the big issues that we face\nas autistics\nis that we're emphasized things like the\nthe puzzle piece puzzle piece and how\nall these little different components\nit gives people the idea that we can be\nspoken over\nbecause we're not capable of speaking\nfor ourselves\ni think it's only approximately 30\npercent\nof autistics have an intellectual\ndisability\nso there's still a large portion of the\nautistic community that is capable\ni mean are not even those with\nintellectual disabilities they can still\nspeak from themselves\nthey might just need more help to be\nable to do so\nbut that 30 is what's seen rather than\nthe entire autistic community\nand it's it's sadly not just us as i was\nmentioning it's the entire mental health\nas well where you lose that autonomy\nas soon as you're seen as having a\ndisability\na good example is individuals in\nwheelchairs\npeople will go around and push them in\nthe wheelchair if they're in the way\nthey'll invade their their space above\ntheir head\nlike it that that kind of individual\ncontrol is gone\ni've never heard of the face i mean i\nthink it makes a lot of sense but i've\nnever heard the phrase\ninvade the space above your head their\nhead\ni never think about like when i think\nabout my personal space i mean i you\nknow i haven't sat in a wheelchair but\ni'm just\nappreciating for a moment that generally\nspeaking when i think about invasions of\nmy personal space i think about them in\nlike\nhorizontal directions i don't really\nthink about in a vertical direction i i\ni don't mean i mean i'm laughing just\nbecause i don't know what else to do\nright now but\ni it's bizarre like i i can't imagine\nwhat it's like to\nyou know have to worry about that space\nand i feel lucky to not have to worry\nabout that space but it's it's\nit's crazy um yeah i'm with you in terms\nof autonomy though and i think this is\nthe the other tricky thing\nyeah so that's why i was kind of curious\nabout you know this term disabled\nbecause\ni see this a lot too and i think\nsometimes\nyeah it's tough because i think we're\nquick\nto take away other people's autonomy\num i see this a lot too where a lot of\ntimes we like i see this with with\nour community actually and like when\nthey talk to their parents\nso we work on this a lot where people\nwill say\nyou don't understand right so like the\nparents will say to the kid like you\ndon't understand\nlike i wish like let me explain it to\nyou and it's like no like\ni'm allowed to understand and disagree\nit's not that i don't understand like\nyou're you're kind of assuming that i'm\nignorant whereas i just\ndisagree i'm allowed to have an opinion\nthat is different from yours and that\ndoesn't make it objectively wrong it's\nnot a deficiency in my understanding\ni see this a lot also in gender dynamics\num in terms of like sometimes you know\npeople will\nlike especially towards women and within\nour community\num you know people will be like oh\nbecause you are a woman therefore your\nopinion is worth less than someone\nelse's\nlike you need to understand or actually\ni don't even know that it's even that\nconscious but like i i see this a lot\nwhere\nwhere disagreements are viewed as like a\nlack of understanding\nanytime there's kind of like this power\ndynamic whether it's parents and kids or\nmen and women or whatever have you had\npersonal experiences where you felt like\nyou've been kind of shouted down or\nignored because of your disability\ni want to say yes but i'm not able to\npull anything right out of the top of my\nhead\ntotally fine man okay um i know i've had\nto argue a lot with like psychiatrists\nand everything as well\njust in general um things like\nmedication it's one of the reasons why i\npursued\npharmaceutical sciences and stuff\nbecause i wanted to have a bit more\ncontrol over my own medication since\nlike when it comes to like the\npharmaceutical side\nit's very it's not patient tailored\nbecause we're not going into like\ngenetics etc etc\nso finding those right mediums were very\ndifficult and so i wanted to have some\nsort of authority in that conversation\nto be able to better treat myself versus\nwhere it's just\nno i'm i know better\nyeah that really pisses me off like i i\nthink that i i recently had a\nconversation with a patient of mine\nwhere you know\nit was a tough it was a tough sort of\nimpasse um\nbecause i was sort of recommending a\nparticular medication that they didn't\nlike and then ultimately like\nyou know at some point in the\nconversation i was like i'm not the one\nit's easy for me to make this\nrecommendation because i'm not the one\nwho has to put that pill into my body on\na daily basis\nyou know and i think that's very easy to\nforget like we sort of think about\num you know what's like evidence-based\nand scientific but like\nas is pharmacologic prescribers like\nwe're not the one who has to\nyou know i have this book right and the\nbook has a list of side effects and i'm\nlike it can cause dry mouth it can cause\nweight gain\nit can cause erectile dysfunction but\nlike i'm not the one who has to live\nwith it right\nit's the patient who has to live with it\nand that's what makes it really really\nchallenging i think\noftentimes as prescribers like it's one\nof the things that i try really hard to\nremember\nit's something that i don't think we\nemphasize enough but i don't think that\nyou should\nneed to get formal training to be\ninformed about medications i think\nactually that's your right as a patient\nand it's the responsibility of your\ndoctors to equip you with the\ninformation to make an informed choice\nas opposed to overrule what you want to\nbased on their authority like do they\nknow about it more than you do\nabsolutely but it's their job informed\nconsent\nis like not about the consent it's about\nthe informed\nabsolutely um i i do actually have an\nexample as well\ni went to uh my friend's wedding\nand i had gotten lost um i was\nin the actual wedding venue but i guess\ni wasn't supposed to be there yet\nand i i told like this person came\nthrough and said like hey you're not\nsupposed to be here like he was like\ngetting really aggressive with me\nand so you know i i went in and opened\nup immediately hey i'm autistic\ni'm confused i don't know where i'm\nsupposed to be and his response\nimmediately\nwas to see me as a child he directly put\nhis hands on me\nit was like they're there bud like\nliterally all of my autonomy in that\ninstance was ripped from me\nrather than being like hey i might have\nsome trouble\ninteracting this conversation i just\nneed a little bit\nhelp like it was completely ripped from\nme and just\nlike like my personal space was invaded\nmy\nintellectual capability was invalidated\nit sucked like like i i don't want to\ncall it dramatic\nbut at the same time it\nit felt\ndisgraceful\nyou're good with words yes\ni i paid a lot i had to pay a lot of\nattention to words growing up\num like there was times where like i i\nthink i spent\ndays studying to understand metaphor\nsimiles stuff like that just because\ni wanted to have greater communication\ncapability\nyeah i think you do a very good job i\nthink you're you know we talk about\nalexa thymia sometimes on stream\ni'd be really curious about how you\nlearned how to put\nwords to what you feel because i even\nsaw like the gears turning in your mind\nthere where you were like recalling the\nexperience and trying to figure out\nwhat is the right word to describe how i\nfelt\num and and it was yeah you're good with\nwords man it's cool it's it's it it's\nit's a pleasure to hear you talk about\nstuff\nbecause i think i'm happy to hear that\nyeah you you're like\nyou're skilled with your words like in\nterms of the way that you paint\nand you can paint a very clear picture\nbecause your words are quite precise\num do you want to talk about color on\nthe spec color\ni'm sorry did you ever respond i mean i\ndidn't mean to shift gears on either\nbut so color the spectrum is event that\nis happening april 30th that is\nreally problematic for the those of us\non the autistic spectrum\num it's done by mock robber and i'm sure\nit's it's done with good intention\nuh some of the language used one of the\nlike problematic things are things like\nmy son will never be able to become an\nastronaut\nwhere there's a lot of this like a lot\nof autistics\nand a lot of parents are hit with this\nimmediately as soon as their child's\ndiagnosed with autism\nyour son will never be able to do this\nyour your daughter will never be able to\nbecome this\nright there's a lot of um\na lot of i can't think of the word\nthere's a lot of qualifiers placed on\nwhat a person can and can't be as soon\nas they have a disability\nand i this language is really harmful to\nthe autistic community\num we were kind of as mentioned\nemphatized where we're seen as children\na lot of everything going on is from the\nperspective of parent to child\nrather than adult to adult or\nadult to child right i think that the an\nadult to a child that communication is\ndifferent than a parent to a child\num and next for autism is the charity\nthat's being supported\nup until recently they wanted to cure\nand prevent\nautism which many of us in the autistic\ncommunity feel\nis very um\nthey they use eugenics um i i think\nthat's a very\nvery powerful term um\ni i see it as saying you don't want me\nto exist\nthat autistics shouldn't exist\nbecause we're seen as problematic um of\ncourse next raw autism\ncame out with a whole thing like oh we\nnever\nsaid that this is this is just gross\nmisinformation\nand then they silently remove their\ntheir mission statement that actually\ninclude cure autism etc\nand just didn't talk about it so they\nthey basically\ngaslit the entire autistic community\nand just like oh don't listen to them\nand sorry go ahead can can i can i play\ndevil's advocate for a second because\nnow actually i'm a little bit confused\ndevil's advocate means i'm supporting a\npoint but it's really\ni'm confused so when i as a medical\nprofessional\nwhen i think about a disability i do\ncertainly have a bias like for example\nwhen someone\nyou know loses a let or i i maybe that\nhas to do with losing\num i tend to think about restoration of\nfunction\nis an important part of my profession\nand so when i think about someone with\nlike a physical disability like if\nsomeone had lost a hand\nlike i would think that it is a good\nmove\nto for that person to no longer be\ndisabled\num when i think about you know like i'll\nwrite letters for like medical\ndisabilities for people with depression\ni certainly i mean i personally like\nhave a goal as a treatment provider\nto get that person to no longer be\ndisabled\nso now i'm a little bit confused about\num and apologies if i'm you know coming\nacross as\nlike not understanding because i i'm\nreally confused now because when i\nwhen when you use the word disability i\nthink about something\nas i that word triggers in me the idea\nthat something neat could or eventually\nshould be fixed\nwhat do you think about that\ni acknowledge that\nmy the it is a disability it does limit\nwhat i can do what i can accomplish\nbut i think it's a disservice to also\nwhat it allows for us to do and for what\nit allows for us to accomplish\nright it's important to acknowledge is\nautism a disability because it's a\ndisability\nor is it a disability because of society\nand understanding how our ability to\nfunction\nin society makes it a disability\nthat's right there's there's a lot of\nthat argument where\nit might not be something that needs to\nbe cured or prevented\nbecause rather it should be about\nmeeting us\nand understanding what we are or what\nwe're dealing with\nrather than be like you don't fit let's\nfix you because that\nthat yeah that's super problematic very\nwell said so i'm i'm gonna kind of just\nriff off that for a second and talk\nabout adhd so a lot of times when i work\nwith people with adhd\nalso as a clinician i try really really\nhard\nto not take the kid and make him\nsuccessful\ndon't default to making him successful\nat sitting in a classroom for eight\nhours a day\nso so my treatment if you can call it\nthat for adhd\nis to try to structure an environment\nwhere there are vata mines so they have\na mind that's far more dynamic\ncan handle a lot more varied stimuli and\nis not really suited to like staring at\na book for four hours a day\nso what i actually try to do with my\npatients with adhd is not to turn them\ninto\npeople who can read books but to help\nthem structure an environment because i\nthink that adhd\nis actually like more of a natural i\nmean there's definitely a clinical\nillness in there\nbut i think there are too many people\nwho get diagnosed with adhd\nbecause their minds are not suited for a\nparticular\nenvironment like school so there's a\nreally interesting bit of research that\nshows that\nas the student-to-teacher ratio gets\nworse\nmore kids get diagnosed with adhd so if\nyou have one teacher in 10 students\nvery few diagnoses of adhd if you have\none teacher and 50 students like half\nthe class is going to get diagnosed with\nadhd\nso i can totally get behind that did you\nwant to say\nactually i actually wish i had that kind\nof treatment growing up\ni for me the only place i can actually\nstudy is in a classroom now\nso i need like this this very specific\nenvironment anywhere else i can't study\nyeah it sucks yeah i think it's it's\nalso an interesting philosophical\nquestion about\nyou know how much do we change who we\nare versus how much do we\nadapt or shape our environment to\naccommodate us\ni'm curious and let me know if this\nquestion rubs you the wrong way if i\ncould give you a pill and\nand that would quote unquote cure your\nautism would you take it\nit's one of those hard things right it's\nlike it can't\ni can't quantify what part of me is\nautistic\nright that that's one of the big things\nin like why we we tend to prefer\nautistic individual versus individual\nwith autism\nis because we can't really separate that\nwe can't be like oh that's that's my\nautism part okay\nbye i don't like you it it's it's so\nmuch of who i am\nand so to secure my autism would mean\neliminating who i am and so\nlike i i i couldn't like ethically\nnot just like not just because of like\nthe other reason so even ethically i\nwould be\ndeleting a part of myself\ninteresting so uh can i\ndisagree with you a little bit yeah sure\nyou're more than welcome to disagree all\nright so\nall respect but so this is where like i\ntend to be in the minority and i realize\nwhat i'm about to say like may offend\nlike millions of people\nbut you know it's weird uh yes like\nbecause it's hard because what are you\nright like i can understand exactly\nwhere you're coming from but\nthe more i've meditated so a lot of what\ni'm saying comes from my experiences in\nmeditation\nwhere i've come to realize that core\nparts of my identity is not truly who i\nam\nso i i would potentially for example\nidentify as a doctor and i clearly do\nand there's a part of me that feels like\nif you took my medical license away\ni would not be me but oddly enough the\nmore i've meditated the more i've come\nto realize that even being a doctor is a\nfalse part of who i am\nthat the truest part of who i am is\nsomewhat transcendent and cannot be\nreduced to a particular quality\ni know it sounds weird but like like i i\ndon't think of myself so it's it's kind\nof bizarre so i work with a fair number\nof people who are transgender too\nand and you know my approach to them is\ni can't tell if this is like\nreally really offensive or really really\naccepting\nbut that their basic humanity is like\nmakes the core of who they are\nand that that transcendent humanity is\nfar\nmore important than what their\n[Music]\ngender is and some people get really\noffended by this and we have\nthat conversation and other people\nreally appreciate it i'm not sure what's\nright or wrong it's just been\nmy experience in terms of discovering\nwho i am\nbecause there's a part yeah sorry i\ndon't think i\nfollow doesn't that fit my statement\nbecause you said that it may sorry yeah\nso so that that's what's also kind of\nconfusing i think it's a different way\nof looking at identity\nbut like i there's a part of me that\nsays that we could change a lot of\nthings about you and you would still be\nyou\nbut what i'm hearing you say is that you\nconsider\nyour identity to be entangled with\nautism\nand so removing the autism is removing a\npiece of you\nright like philosophically and somewhat\nneuron scientifically\nspeaking like our our consciousness is\nour brain right we could argue that the\nstructure of our brain plays a large\nrole\nin our consciousness with autism being a\nneurological disorder\nthe way that my brain is shaped is\nshaped so by my autism\nso to change that neurological component\nwould be to change myself\nyeah so then my next question is is\nchanging yourself a bad thing\nthere is a difference between changing\nyourself and neuroplasticity and\nchoosing key components of your identity\num and in that i i can't think of a good\nexample right now\nthere there's superficial change that we\nall have that to some degree i think\ncan be critical um but\nat the the identity of it all it's the\nsame i think\nmaybe this is a good example of phineas\nphineas gage\nuh for those who don't know phineas gage\nhad a\nrod he was a railway railroad worker he\nhad a rod go through\nhis um his job basically i can't think\nof the specific\num and went through the frontal cortex\nwhich caused his entire behavior to\nchange\num so he started gambling he went from\nlike this religious devout person to\na gambling alcoholic very aggressive\nvery\num just\nvery horrible person so to speak by\ncomparison not saying that that is\nhorrible but\num was he still phineas gage\nright and like that that's the whole\ntheory of like mind and what is and\nisn't i don't think i'm equipped to\nreally have that that conversation\nbut to my understanding is that i cease\nto exist when that changes\nyeah so this is where things get a\nlittle bit tricky because i\ni you know it's it's interesting um yes\nbecause i\ni get exactly where you're coming from\nand i think autonomy is ultimately like\nwhat is most important so i think you\nget to decide whether you like who you\nare and whether you want to change i do\nthink it's arrogant for an organization\nor for someone else like\nincluding myself as a you know potential\ntreatment provider\nfor me to decide what is right for my\nautistic patients like i don't get to\nmake that decision you get to make that\ndecision\nand and so i can get i can totally\nsupport you 100\nin terms of you know you saying that\nautism has shaped the person that i\nam and i would it's i didn't hear you\nsay yes or no if i offered you the pill\nno no okay so i think that's totally\nfine i think that's\nthat's ultimately i think autonomy is\ntends to be the\nthe ethical principle that is a\ntreatment provider like i try to value\nabove everything else\num at the same time i also find that i'm\nin the profession\nof trying to make people change that a\nlot of times people will come to me\nbecause there is a part of what they\nview as their core identity which they\ndo not like in which they want to change\nand i think that's totally fine too i\nknow personally that\num a lot of my journey has been\nstruggling\nto get away from my identity and\ndiscover who i truly am\nbecause i think a lot of our identity is\nlike crafted and given to us\nright like you're right like the\nidentity that society gives you when you\nwhen you're at that wedding and you say\nto this person that i have autism and\ni'm confused i'm not sure where i'm\nsupposed to be\nthe way that the world treats you the\nway that the identity that like\nthe world kind of hands you is one that\ni think sometimes we have to actually\ntry really hard to get away from because\ni think we also\ninternalize some of that so it's not\njust uh you can arguably say yeah\nsociety's like society's wrong but i\nthink what we do is we internalize these\nthings right\nwhen we think about shame and stuff like\nthat we start to believe that we\nare you know when it comes to the chads\nand the what chads and the betas is it\nchad and beta is that the\nwhat's the opposition\nanyway i i don't know so\nit's tricky but i'm i'm i'm really happy\nthat you\nyou answer the question i i feel like i\nlearned a lot and i i think you've\nreally helped me\nunderstand you said not people without\nbecause that's interesting because i've\nbeen told the opposite that it's more\noffensive\nthat you define a person by a particular\ndiagnosis\nthat's the thing right like like as i\nwas mentioning since\nautism is a neurological disability we\nare as much autistic as we are a person\nwe're an autistic\nperson right our our identity can't be\nseparated i can't just like\nokay i'm gonna go ahead and take my\nautistic self i'm gonna just leave it at\nhome\nand i'm gonna be totally normal today i\nnever can separate that\nso i was taught the opposite by a\ndifferent group of people with a\ndifferent diagnosis\nso and i'm not saying one is right or\nwrong but like just to share with you\nlike\nanother conversation i had i was talking\nwith people with schizophrenia\nand in medicine we have some\ndiseases that we define as the person\nso we'll say so and so is a\nschizophrenic\nright but there is no noun that involves\ncancer\nso cancer is an illness like you're not\ndefined by your cancer like you get\ndiagnosed with a cancer i have\na cancer i'm not like a cancer rick\nand so people like when i was kind of\nlike talking to people with\nschizophrenia what they were sort of\nsaying to me\nis that they don't appreciate\nbeing defined by a particular illness or\naspect of themselves\nand that they think that the person is\nmore important with schizophrenia\nbecause there's still a person and the\nproblem is that once you get labeled as\na schizophrenic you become a\nschizophrenic\nyou become a and i guess what they would\nsay is you\nbecome an autistic in the eyes of others\nbut that your humanness is more\nimportant than your autism but i\nunderstand both sides of the argument i\ndon't know\ni i think when it comes to schizophrenic\nit has a lot to do with the stigma\nas we mentioned at the start of this the\nindividual with borderline personality\ndisorder\nthese things have such negative\nconnotations to them\nthat you naturally don't want to be\nassociated to that you want to be seen\nas a person because what society sees\nwhen they\nhear these words are untouchable someone\nthat\njust to avoid um\nthankfully that hasn't happened with\nautism yet\nokay and so i think we have the ability\nto take that word and make it a positive\nrather than trying to distance ourselves\nfrom negative connotations\num and so do you consider like if i were\nto\nso you refer to yourself as an autistic\nindividual\nis that your preferred and and\nuh is the term\nuh is there a noun form of person with\nautism is it\nan autistic yes an autistic as an\nautistic\nokay um so so it the then the term\nautistic is not offensive to you\nno okay got it thanks for clarifying\ncool\nuh again i can only really speak for\nmyself and\nother autistics that i've interacted\nwith um obviously there's going to be\npeople of a community\nthat might feel otherwise i i think i\nsaw a comment it's up to the individual\nand i think that's important as well to\nconsider is that some individuals will\nprefer to be referred to as\nindividuals with autism some will be\nreferred to as autistic\nindividual and i think both should be\nhonored based on the\nthe individual person yeah\ncool anything else that you want to tell\nus or explain to us about you know\nwhat's going on in the autistic\ncommunity or\nanything that you want to raise\nawareness of um\ni'm currently doing a charity event for\nautistic self-advocacy network uh we've\nraised sixteen thousand eight hundred\nand forty dollars so far\nthis month this is my third year uh\nrunning warriors for autism\nuh in world of warcraft i eventually\nwould like to start my own charity\nfocusing on helping autistic adults\ni want to focus on you know\nthings like housing and employment\nand kind of like creating this this\ncommunity that\nis self-sustaining but in the meantime\none of the most important things is i\nthink self-advocacy equipping autistics\nto be able to\nadvocate for ourselves to illustrate\nwhat autism\nis so that the the broader population\ncan understand who we are is incredibly\nimportant\nand it's one of the reasons why i've\nbeen really really proud to support asan\nfor\nthese past three years awesome can i ask\none clarifying question sorry about the\nterminology yeah go ahead is the term\nautist\nhopefully that's not a bannable term but\ndo you know\nbut is that offensive or is that okay\ni'm not a big fan of autist uh i\ni don't know about others like i i can't\nspeak on that one with any authority\num but i know that autist has a bit more\nsling to it\nin that it has negative connotations\nkind of similar to\num sperg a lot of people don't know that\nspur comes from asperger's\nand that a lot of the characteristics\nthat use or\nare associated to sperg are the negative\ncharacteristics that you associate to\nautism\nokay thanks for clarifying yeah i i sort\nof am\nmore familiar with that term in terms of\nlike i do find it to be a little bit\nmore derogatory and stigma inducing\num i basically don't see it used outside\nof 4chan\nwhich i think by definition makes it a\nlittle bit\nless safer yeah exactly\noh so but thanks for clarifying to us i\nappreciate that\nof course um any so sometimes i'll teach\npeople how to meditate on stream is that\ninteresting to you i actually used to\nmeditate a lot when i was younger\num i got harassed a lot for that\nlike one time when i was in a after\nschool\ncare thing i would be meditating and\nnot even joking one of the employees\nthere\nuh took their drink and threw it in my\nface\nthat's crazy man yeah um\ni wish i have so many stories like this\nchildhood was rough but yeah um so\nmeditating yes i haven't done in many\nmany\nmany years but um i used to quite\nregularly\num okay so i i can teach you like a\nrelatively introductory technique which\nwe do frequently on stream\num maybe we can all do it together but\nit's a good technique because it\nactually\nincreases your sympathetic let me think\nabout this\nso there's one that balances your\nsympathetic and parasympathetic nervous\nsystem\nand there's another one that um\n[Music]\nare you just suppressing yawn\nno okay i i just felt like i got a\nyawning signal from you but\num i i just took a deep breath just like\nlike getting prepared to meditate\nsorry\ni was like oh he's trying not to yawn to\nto to be polite\nand he's been programmed so\noh no no oh my god i um\ni was taking physics\na calculus based physics and it was lit\nat night\nand i totally forgot where i was and i\njust let out this big\n[Music]\nwhile the teacher was talking\nyeah um i have something to show you\nreal quick\nuh so i can give you two options for a\ntechnique\none is one that balances your\nsympathetic and parasympathetic nervous\nsystem\nand another one actually activates your\nparasympathetic nervous system\nmore directly uh this is not what i was\nlooking for but i think it's interesting\num so there's some evidence that\npeople with who are tests high on\nsociopathy\ndon't actually um\nuh people who test high on on the\nsociopathy scale\nactually don't uh\num they don't uh\nyawn the same way\nso like if contagious yawning is less\ncommon\nin people who are sociopaths so if you\nguys\nare for those of you on twitch chat who\nare yawning with us\nyou are less likely to be a sociopath\nand for those of you\nwho are not yawning you're more likely\nto be a sociopath\num i\nthis is not the paper i was looking for\nbut i i grabbed it anyway just because i\nthink it's interesting because this one\ntalks about\nautism versus psychopathic traits i've\nnever seen a paper that compares the two\nbut i'll have to look at this i can send\nthis to you if you want yeah\ni'd actually really like that yeah that\nwas actually one of the hardest things i\nfound about my master's program was\nreading papers\noh god i hate paper so much i think\nthat's the adhd part though\nannaletti i don't know her but okay\ninteresting\num so in terms of uh\nmeditation you want you know we can do\nsomething that is\num\n[Music]\nwhat you may call um we can do something\nthat's\nparasympathetic and sympathetic or\nsomething that it really recruits the\nparasympathetic nervous system\nmore directly\nuh let's try the parasympathetic more\ndirectly okay\nso i'm gonna teach you um a technique\ncalled\nbellows breath actually let me think\nabout let's teach you something new\num so i'm going to teach you\num hold on\nyeah okay i'm gonna i'm gonna teach you\na technique called bellows breath\nor no that's not the translation\num i'm gonna teach you\ni forget what the sense with word is but\ni'm going to teach you yeah let's just\ncall bella's breath\nit's technically not correct but so what\ni'm going to do is do a series of rapid\nforceful exhalations followed by\na passive inhalation it's kind of hard\nto describe it you'll you'll understand\ni think hopefully when i\nshow you so we're going to breathe very\nrapidly\nfocusing on the exhalation and then\nwhat's going to happen is our co2 level\nis going to drop really low\nand so as our co2 as we become\nhypocarbic\nour respiratory drive is going to\ncompensate by\nslowing down our breathing\nand so as we slow down our breathing\nit's gonna be like really really\nnatural and then we'll sort of be in\nthis like chill state afterward\nokay so what i'm gonna do i'll just\ndemonstrate so we're gonna start with\nlike i'll do nine breaths\nand i'm gonna blow out x forcefully\nthrough the nose\nnine times and um\nit sounds kind of weird but i'm not\ngonna focus on inhaling i'm just gonna\ntry to push out air\nover and over and over again and then\nafter nine breaths i'm gonna just be\nsilent okay\nso ready\nhold on i need kleenex\nthe snot came out okay here we go\ndid you get that so nine forceful\nexhalations\nokay okay so i'm gonna try this let's\ni'm gonna watch you do it okay\nokay breathe out hard nine times and\nthen just chill after\nokay\ngood so second time around we're gonna\ndo\nlet's do 15 with our eyes closed\nokay so take it deep so close your eyes\ntake a deep breath in\nand begin\nall right let's do 20 now\nhow do you feel after the 15 breaths\nconfused mostly okay so let's try 20.\nam i supposed to breathe in directly\nafter the 15 or do i hold my breath\nthere for a bit because\ni have your breath okay just do whatever\nfeels natural because holding my breath\nis what felt natural\nbecause like i just didn't want to\nbreathe yep yep that's the point\nso but don't try to hold your breath\nright so i i told you there's going to\nbe a natural\nslowing of your respiratory rate because\nyou're hypocarbic\nso your your your your mind will st like\nyou'll feel like not breathing and then\nas you\ndon't breathe it'll actually like\nrecruit\nyour vagal systems okay\nright so rapid breathing is associated\nwith this sympathetic nervous system\nactivity\nincreased respiratory rate so what we're\ndoing is recruiting\nnaturally our vagal system okay\nokay so let's do 20 breaths\nready take a deep breath in go\nso we're just gonna sit in this space\nfor about 60 seconds\nthis\nwhen you're ready go ahead and come on\nback\nhow you feeling it feels very similar to\nlike a hot shower\nor a hot tub or relaxing on the couch\nwith a loved one\ninteresting relaxing on the couch with a\nloved one meditation\nwell yeah like like there's these times\nwhere like you just find a really good\nshow it's not like super\nlike exciting but you just feel so at\npeace with your\nyour loved one that you just kind of\nlike melt into the couch\nyou don't really know how to so that's\nwhat we call\nparasympathetic activation right that's\na beautiful way to describe it actually\nis like you know you're kind of\nrecruiting your floatiness\nyour chillingness and um\nyou know i'd be a little bit careful\ndesk like i'd experiment a little bit on\nyour own\num maybe if you have a clinician\ninvolved uh you know just touch base\nwith them but my hope would be that if\nyou're ramping up towards like\nan autistic meltdown you may be able to\nuse this to recruit some of that floaty\nsensation\nyou just got to be a little bit careful\nthat that initial hyperventilation phase\ndoesn't actually make things worse\nchances are\ni use this technique um for people with\nwho have panic attacks\nand if they can do it kind of early\nenough they can sort of stave off the\npanic attack\nand a lot of times even in the middle of\na panic attack it can be helpful\nand they always tell me when i when i do\nit with someone who's acutely in a panic\nattack like in the emergency room\nthey say it doesn't help but then a week\nlater they're like yeah that actually\nhelped a lot\ni just didn't realize it at the time\nso i i didn't use this metaphor earlier\nbut i think it's a good example to\ndescribe kind of\nthe the difference between neurotypical\nresponse and autistic response\nit's like we have this this water\nballoon right\nand so the water balloon can hold so\nmuch water\num and eventually if too much water gets\nin it it bursts\nright i feel like normal individuals\nhave valves towards the bottom of it so\nit takes a lot of water\nand a lot of like miss mis fortunate\ncircumstances for it to actually fill\nenough to burst\num so eventually like as water comes in\nwater goes out\nfor those of us with autism or at least\nfor myself specifically the way i would\ndescribe it\nis we have a much smaller balloon and\nthe valves are at the very top\nso as it fills with water um\nit takes longer for water to come back\nout so it fills up at a much more rapid\nrate\nthan the the water like going out\num so we're more likely to hit that\nburst point\nbefore we realize that we're full\nso it's really hard and requires a lot\nof\num cognition of like there's water in\nhere\ni need to to start prepping and\npreparing myself\nbefore it even reaches those valves\nwell said beautiful analogy dust so\nthanks a lot um for coming on you know\nwe really appreciate you coming on\nsharing your perspectives about you know\nwhat it's like to kind of grow up with\nautism\ni think you did a really awesome job of\num\nshowcasing kind of what the experience\nis on the\ninside for someone with autism in terms\nof like\nyou know not being able to really\nunderstand why things were hard for you\nwhich i think is a really really good\nexample\ni hear that the most from people not\nwith anxiety or depression but people\nwith autism and adhd\ni don't understand why this is hard for\nme when it seems so easy for everyone\nelse\num yeah yeah sorry no\ngo for it oh no no i was just going to\nagree with you\nyeah i think it's a beautiful way to\ndescribe\nyou know because a lot of times people\naren't going to know like\nlike people who may wonder if they're\nautistic i think this is a really key\ntakeaway\nfor them is that if if things just seem\nreally really hard for you and like they\nseem so much easier for other people\nthere may be something going on like\nautism or adhd\nexactly so i think that's actually like\na really beautiful way to put it so\nthanks very much for coming on\num thank you for all the work that you\ndo i think it's awesome that you're\ndoing it\nand um yeah man\nthank you thank you so much for having\nme this has\nbeen really exciting and this i was so\nnervous about today i'm not gonna i was\nso nervous\nbut this was actually really great\ni really hope that the my story and\neverything's helped connected with\nothers and i mean one of my favorite\nthings is people hearing this the story\nand realizing like hey maybe i'm\nautistic\nyou know and they they start looking\ninto it they start pursuing it and they\nmight finally have answers to\nwhy life's been so hard and not only\nthat but to have that connection\nand to finally feel that sense of\nbelonging\num yeah so\nthanks a lot man i'm struggling to not\nmake an uh make a joke about how much of\na chad you are\nlike you guys can find des at twitch.tv\nslash\ndes the autistic chad\nuh but it's desmophisto right\nyes that's methus though so check out\ndes on on twitch\nand good luck man yes thank you\nthank you\nthat's great okay who are we rating chat"
