    "transcript": "okay the entropic brain a theory of\nconscious states informed by\nneuroimaging research with psychedelic\ndrugs\nthis this paper chat seriously is just\nwhack okay this is like\nfascinating i'm going to try to\nsummarize it for you okay so entropy is\na dimensionless\nquantity that is used for measuring\nuncertainty\nabout the state of a system but it can\nalso imply\nphysical qualities where high energy\nentropy is synonymous with high disorder\nentropy is applied here in the context\nof states of consciousness and their\nassociated neurodynamics\nso what this is kind of talking about\nis that when we think about our\nconsciousness okay this this\nthis paper is fascinating okay when we\nthink about our consciousness\nor a sense of self it's a low entropy\nstate\ni am this okay like dr k\nis this you are this you are\nsuccessful you're a failure you're\nawesome you suck\nwhatever but you are something that's\nyour identity so what this\nthis paper talks about is that like when\nyou use psychedelics\nthere you create a state of high entropy\nof the self so the self becomes like\ndisorganized and diffuse\nand so when people talk about like you\nknow being connected to other people and\nthat their sense of self kind of breaks\ndown and they realize they're like\nconnected with the universe\nit's like a high entropic state of\nconsciousness\nit's whack man like the research on this\nstuff is just so fascinating so when\nsomeone's talking about ego death\nabsolutely right so\nin moksha or enlightenment ego death\nhappens\nand so like you are no longer you but\nyou are like one with the universe\nand we can say those words but it\ndoesn't make any sense until you\nexperience it in a state of\nconsciousness\nand the neuroscience behind the stuff is\nfascinating once again\ndon't do drugs chat i'm serious because\ni don't know if you guys get this but\nshattering your sense of self can\nsometimes leave you traumatized\nso don't do that like really like the\npoint of showing you guys these papers\nis to\ndemonstrate this is not something to\nplay around with okay so someone's\nasking what about microdosing\nokay look so let's just talk about this\nfor a second okay\nso there are a lot of fads within the\nsubstance use community\nand like as a scientist and medical\nprofessional\nthe short answer is we don't know\nright we don't know what micro dosing\ndoes to you we don't know what micro\ndusting doesn't\ndo to you we just don't know right so\nlike i know that a lot of people like\njust think\nthink about this for a second right if\nyou guys are like pro micro dosing\nis that safe how do you know\noh like people are doing it now\nreally does that make something safe if\npeople are\ndoing it now like i don't think so man\nso i know that like a lot of people\nthink that stuff is okay but it just\ndepends on what threshold you want to\nuse when you like stick something in\nyour body\nrepeatedly for a long period of time\ni don't know like what are the long-term\neffects of microdosing no one knows\nbecause i think micro microdosing is\nrelatively new\nwhat is microdosing going to do to your\nbrain a year from now 10 years from now\nwe don't know so i would strongly\nstrongly encourage all when it comes to\nusing substances and stuff like that to\ndo so\nunder the guidance of a medical\nprofessional and i don't say that just\nbecause it's like\nmedical professional monopoly right it's\nlike there's a reason for that man\nbecause the people who's for whom micro\ndosing\nends up going bad are the ones that\ni end up seeing in the emergency room\nand i have a bias there too because\nall the people for whom microdosing does\nwell never wind up in the emergency room\nso what i see is like the worst cases so\nthere's like a bias both ways i'm not\ndisagreeing with that i'm not saying i'm\nobjectively correct what i'm saying is\nthat if you look at\nscience science will study this stuff\nand look at like\n15 000 people who microdose and then\nwe'll say\noh here's what appears to float to the\nsurface\nso i would say like trust in science and\ntrust in medicine\nright but what happens to them who knows\ndo they have a higher risk of anxiety do\nthey have a higher risk of depression\ndo they have a higher risk of being\npromoted like we just don't know\nright and this is what happens people\njust discover something and it\nmakes them feel good right your brain\nabsolutely loves it\nwhich is why everyone's doing it so it\ncan't be bad\nright kind of like when\ncocaine was in coca-cola tastes\ndelicious\ngives you energy there are no downsides\nlet's do it\nright gotta be careful chat there's a\nreason why like medicine is a thing\nand science is a thing okay be careful\nso\ni'd steer clear of drugs chat really"
