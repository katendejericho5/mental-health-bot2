    "transcript": "[Music]\nwhen i teach people meditation what i\ntry to start with is the idea that each\nperson is\nindividual each person is unique and in\nmy experience the most successful\nmeditation practices\nare sort of tailored to the actual\nperson who's doing the meditating\nwe'll go through how meditation is a\npractice evolved\nwhere it started how it branched off and\neven where mindfulness was born because\nmindfulness\nisn't actually all of what meditation\nhas to offer\nin fact it's a tiny tiny fraction of the\ntradition of meditation\nwe sort of explore these core questions\nlike what is the nature of a human being\nwhat makes up a person and as we\ndiscover who we are\nwe find ourselves unshackled from a lot\nof the things that hold us back\nthese thoughts like i am a failure or\ni'm unlovable or that person is better\nthan me\nall stem from not understanding what we\nreally are\nand we'll explore different kinds of\nmeditation inquisitive practices versus\nfocusing practices\nopen awareness meditation where you\nobserve your thoughts\nversus chanting a mantra and how each of\nthese practices\ngives you different benefits and is\nsuited for different kinds of people\nand so our approach in this module is to\ngive you the best of what all of these\ntraditions have to offer\nto give you lots of different meditation\ntechniques that are targeted towards\nparticular realizations or overcoming\ndifferent kinds of problems\nso i really hope that this module will\nbe helpful for you and i hope that it'll\nalso be fun\n[Music]\nyou"
