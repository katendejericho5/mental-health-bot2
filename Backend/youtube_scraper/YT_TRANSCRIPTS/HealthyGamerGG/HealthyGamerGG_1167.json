    "transcript": "so how can i be kind to myself while\nseeking progress in my goals\ni've noticed the reason why i never get\nthe things done\nare i'm incredibly harsh on myself when\ni fail\nand i am a perfectionist not now that i\nfound those issues i'm going to adopt a\nmindset of progress over perfection\nwhile still trying my best my best to\nbeing as kind to myself as possible\nhow can i go about doing this\ni want to make progress on my goals fast\nwhile getting the job done good enough\nand not be perfect\ni also don't want to put a lot of\npressure on myself and treat myself\nand others with as much compassion and\nempathy as possible so i don't take\nmake my mental health worse and i don't\nlose track of my goals\nhow can i be kind to myself while making\nprogress on my goals\nso this is a great question that is a\nsneaky sneaky\nquestion because what this person is\ntrying to do\nis be perfect see this is perfection\nthis is being perfectionistic this is\nperf this is perfection\nyou see this this is perfection person\nis still chasing perfection you're going\nto wind up exactly where you started you\nall see that\noh yeah i'm not doing\na good job i need to be less\nperfectionistic and more\nself-compassionate\nlet me be more perfect by being less\nperfect and more self-compassionate\nsee that tricky tricky tricky because\nthey're saying oh\ni'm gonna be like achieve my goals fast\nwith self-compassion that's so op\nlet's go for op why would we want to\nachieve our goals slow\nlet's achieve them fast with\nself-compassion\nand forgive ourselves when we don't\nachieve it fast enough\nbut we still want to do it fast is that\nis that\nyou guys get that same thing\nsame thing so what i would ask this\nperson is\nwhy can't you achieve your goals slow\nand then when i ask that question\nit's gonna come out oh my god i can't do\nthat man like i need to do it\nfast time is running out everyone else\nis doing it fast oh my god\ndo it slow and be careful\nbecause your mind will be like is there\na perfect level of slow\nhow do i do it slow perfectly\nit's like it's a never-ending cycle\nbecause this is how the mind works\nyour solution is coming from a\nperfectionistic mindset\nyou're like how do i be more perfect\nwhat's the perfect amount of\nimperfection\nhow do i get that let's find the perfect\namount of imperfection\nso this is where like you know i know\nit's kind of weird now that i have found\nthe issues i'm going to adopt a mindset\nof progress over perfection\nbecause that's the perfect mindset\nprogress over perfection that's the\nperfection i need to chase\nit's tricky right it's tricky it's a\ngreat question\nand it's it's one that so many people\nhave because like i'm not trying to make\nthis person feel stupid\ni i really hope i'm not but it occurs to\nme that maybe i am\ni'm i'm happy because like it's such a\nbeautiful question\nand this is what people struggle with\nbecause\nthe solutions that your mind generates\nare coming out of the same ai that's\ncausing the problem\nand so it's tricky so then the person is\nlike wait but what do i what do i do\nwhat direction do i move in how do i\nmove towards it\nand it's like you don't so if you want\nto shatter this\ncompletely take a zen approach you guys\nwant a mindfulness approach you're going\nto zen approach\ndon't progress but\nthen what exactly\nbut then what answer that question\nthat's the zen approach the zen approach\nis like taking a gigantic\nmallet to your cognitive thought process\nand shattering it\nthat's the zen approach it's tough it's\nlike requires a lot of\nyou know fortitude let me see if i can\ncome up with something\nokay okay here it is\nokay so how can i be kind to myself\nwhile making progress on my goals\nthe real question can be how can i be\nkind to myself\nwhile not making progress on my goals\nyou see this this is a devastating\nquestion\nyou guys can y'all tell what is in the\nmind of that person\nit's relentless man\nrelentless right like be kind to\nyourself whether you progress or not\nkindness isn't tied to progression\nkindness is only tied to progression\nwhen you're shooting for perfectionism\ni know it's tough it's going to be\nreally tough\ndo you deserve kindness if you don't\nprogress that's the question you should\nask yourself\nand the answer is going to be probably\nin your head no\nso that's tough right so as long as like\nif you don't deserve\nkindness if you don't make progress then\nlike\ni can't so then i mean that's the issue\nwe've got to work on right\ni'm not saying practically like just\njust suffer\nso we talk a lot about self-forgiveness\nand self-compassion but i want you guys\nto notice that like\ni'm not going to play the game that the\nquestion sets up because the game is\nrigged\nthe real question is why can't you be\nkind to your why do you need to only be\nkind yourself like and progress like why\ncan't you accept\nthat it's okay to like not progress\ni'm not saying don't progress what i'm\nsaying is\naccept yourself if you make a mistake be\nkind to yourself\nif it doesn't work out and keep trying\ni'm not saying don't try i'm not saying\ngive up\nright subtle careful but you deserve\nyour kindness\neither way you deserve your compassion\neither way right like\nwhen i kind of think about myself at 21\nyears old like i'm a bumbling idiot\nright just because i'm\na bumbling idiot doesn't mean that like\ni don't deserve a pat on the back and\nlike a good try and like let's get up\nand try again\nright that's what coaching is about\nthere's a reason we call them coaches\nlike they're not\nyou know teachers and they're not\ntherapists but they're like your coach\nso it's like it's like the person that\nwhen you you know\nget knocked down or when you're knocking\nyourself down they give you like a pat\non the back and they're like\nhey why don't you get up and try again\nwhen you're ready and i'm gonna be here\nfor you\nand like how can we understand like and\nthey're gonna point out some things in\nyour thought process like this they'll\nmake observations\nthey'll help you understand why are you\nfeeling this way like what's going on\nbut the goal of coaching is not to treat\na clinical diagnosis\nit's to get you back into the field at\nhalftime when you're down by 20 points\nand like give it your best"
