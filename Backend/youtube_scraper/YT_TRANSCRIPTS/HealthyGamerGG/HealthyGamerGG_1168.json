    "transcript": "you should also accept that like you\nweren't perfect a year ago\nor two years ago or three years ago or\nfour years ago or\nshockingly you're not perfect now and\nthat each and every iteration of you.exe\nhas bugs how to know what to fix\nand change versus accepting who you are\ni know dr k\ntalks a lot about not trying to be\nsomeone you're not\nbut how do you know what you should\nchange about yourself versus accept\nif i'm not happy with who i am should i\ntry to change or should i learn to\naccept myself\nokay let me explain something to y'all\nreally simple accepting yourself has\nnothing to do with\nwith not changing where on earth and i\ndon't blame this person\nbut where on earth is a society did we\nsay that once you accept something\nthat's the way it is forever\nthis is the biggest problem do you guys\nget this\nlike this person was conditioned to\nthink that accepting yourself means not\ndoing anything\nand like this causes so many problems\nright like\nif you can't accept me at my worst you\ndon't deserve me at my best\ntherefore i'm gonna be a [ __ ] half of\nthe time\nand if you don't like me i'm gonna feel\nself-righteous\nand call you selfish it's your fault\nthat you can't accept me i don't need to\nchange you don't deserve the good parts\nof me\nif you're not willing to take the dumps\nthat i\ndump in your mouth twice a week\nwhere where on earth did we start\nthinking that accepting people means\nthat they shouldn't change\nbecause in my experience like actually\nchanging starts with acceptance so like\ni'm an addiction psychiatrist chat\nwhat that means is i deal with addicts\nso these people come in and there are\ntwo kinds of people that come in\none is i'm addicted to alcohol\ni have a problem does that when someone\ncomes in and they accept\nthat they have a problem do i say to\nthem good job you accepted that you have\na problem\nnow don't change at all because\nacceptance means you don't need to do\nanything else\ngo out there and drink bro you're an\nalcoholic so you should just keep\ndrinking and you accept that\nand that's gonna be peace and\nmindfulness and all that crap\nno and then\ncomes in the second type i don't have a\nproblem\nwhich one of those people is going to\nchange acceptance is the first\nstep to changing accept where you are\nand then do something about it\nthe two go hand in hand so when someone\ncomes in and says dr k\ni'm an alcoholic i'm like sweet now we\nknow what the problem is\nlet's [ __ ] fix it and then for the\nperson who's like i don't have a problem\nthere's nothing to change person's not\ngoing to change\nso this is what i want you all to do how\ndo you know what to accept\nand how do you know what to change the\nanswer is everything\naccept each and every aspect of yourself\nwhatever you are right now this is the\npresent i know this sounds kind of weird\nbut you can't do anything about anything\nthat has happened before now\nthere is literally if you were if you\nhave graduated from college and you\ndon't have a job one year\nout because of the pandemic there is\nnothing you can do about that\nso accept it you are a college graduate\nwith no job for one year\nand then change it the problem is that\nthe reason we tell you guys to accept is\nbecause so many people get\ncaught up trying to rewrite history\ninstead of accepting the present\nif i had done this if i had done that if\nthe pandemic this\nif this person did that if my parents\ndid this if this if that\nthen i would not be here and all of that\nthinking is completely useless\nbecause that [ __ ] happened there are no\nifs\nlife like reality is here you are\nunemployed\naccept it and then people are sort of\nlike but then what about all the self\nblame and shame and all that crap yeah\nso like work through that right that's\nwhat we're here for too\nbut understand that like it's not your\nfault that you made mistakes\nbefore i know it sounds kind of weird\nyou made those mistakes but like the\nperson that's here now\nhas to clean that [ __ ] up like\nthe you of today is not the same you\nthat was there a year ago it's kind of\nweird\nright like you have to like whatever you\ndid what you did\nshould you you can beat yourself up for\nit if you want to you can also accept\nthat you just made mistakes\nand then change it's not your fault\nit's the dude from a year ago do you\nguys get that it's kind of weird\nbut like when i was 21 and failing in\ncollege that wasn't me\nit's not the me of today it's the me of\nyesterday those are completely different\npeople\ncompletely different people you'll get\nthat like 17 years ago when i was\nfailing out of college and went to india\nfor the first time i was not dr k\nhow on earth can i blame that kid for\nwhat he did like he didn't know any\nbetter\nthe poor kid was so confused\nhe was grown up indian his parents were\nlike you got to be a doctor to mean\nsomething in life\nhe had a boner for going to harvard and\nhad zero chance of going there\nlike the kid like needed help why am i\ngoing to blame that\nkid like he didn't know what he was\ndoing\nlike how on earth could i expect that\nthis kid would understand what i\nunderstand now\nclueless kid it's not as bad like he did\nthe best that he could like he was just\nso clueless like\ncut the kid a break he did what he could\nand 17 years later\ntheoretically it's the same mind and the\nsame body but it's a completely\ndifferent person\nso accept yourself where you are if you\nmade mistakes you made mistakes\nright that's the nature of things you're\nnot born you don't\npop out of your mother's womb at level\n100\nyou pop out of your mother's womb at\nlevel one and then here you guys are\nat level 22 beating yourselves up for\nbeing\nlevel six and not being able to do stuff\nwhen you spawn into this world you're\nlevel one\nand depending on the rng sometimes you\nspawn with good gear\nsometimes you spawn with like some sweet\nloot right\nlike you're in a guild and they like\ngive you all these legendaries\nand so even though you're level one you\ncould still down level 10 mobs\nand some of y'all are born at level one\nand you're actually like given debuffs\nbecause of your upbringing and then you\nbeat yourselves up for being level 15\nand we're grinding on level 10 mobs\nthat's because\nyour parents gave you cursed gear and\nit's like giving you penalties and stuff\nand so what does it mean to accept it\nmeans like this is what self-compassion\nis\nyou know we talk like oh like just have\nself-compassion man just forgive\nyourself bro\nlearn to love yourself like that's what\nthat is how do you do that\nit's by acknowledging that the kid who\nwas 17 years ago didn't know [ __ ]\nwhy am i gonna blame him this guy can't\ndo anything\nhe's a noob i'm gonna get mad at him\ni don't have i don't have the time to\nget mad at him i have [ __ ] to do\nand you guys should realize that too\nlike why are you beating yourself up\nokay like two years ago you fell in love\nwith a girl\nand you were like one of these nice guys\nso you like asked her out\nand then she said no then you call her\nthe c word and now she won't talk to you\nand then you feel like such an idiot\nit's like yeah you were an idiot but\nlike did you know any better\nreally are you gonna do it again so\naccept that you did it\naccept that you don't know what you're\ndoing and then like change\nright become a decent human being work\non it try to understand yourself so you\nshould accept\neach and everything about yourself you\nshould also accept that like you weren't\nperfect a year ago or two years ago or\nthree years ago\nor four years ago or shockingly you're\nnot perfect now\nand that each and every iteration of\nu.exe\nhas bugs and it's going to make mistakes\nand you should debug that [ __ ] and\nimprove whatever bugs you have\nit's like you know you dot exe\nversion 2.29\nand then u.exe version 2.31\nbut like you got to accept like you got\nto accept that there are some bugs there\nbefore\nyou can fix them right and so life is a\nprocess\nof like balance patches and bug fixes\nand you are the program so you should\nabsolutely accept\nand absolutely change nah see look so\nsomeone's saying okay be careful i'm so\nbugged\ni'm [ __ ] maybe kind of true but let's\nbe clear\nbecause one of the tricky things about\nthe process\nis that our debugging process is\nsometimes messed up\nso when you have things like depression\nlike it's gonna tell you that things are\nway worse than what you are but that's a\ndiagnostic that's produced\nby your mind so you can't trust it\nright it's tricky because in the mind of\na depressed person they're gonna say\nit's so hopeless there's nothing that i\ncan ever do to fix it\nthere's no point in trying that's that's\na bug it's not a feature\nyour mind telling you that is a bug it's\nnot a feature\nlearning what you can trust about your\nmind is one of the most useful skills\nthat i've ever learned so it's funny\nbecause someone's saying ncs every bug\nis a feature yeah\nso we've got a good video about this\nabout on dr k's guide but\ndepression is a feature too chat right\nso like i want you all to think about\nthis for you it's gonna be wild okay\nthink about this\ndepression is a conserved experience\nacross the human race\nconservative experiences across the\nhuman race tend to have\nevolution behind them so it's actually a\nfeature\nand what it comes down to is we have\nthis part of our brain called the\ndefault mode network\nand depression is the evolutionary price\nwe pay for having a default mode network\nso what happened in our brain is we\ndeveloped the capacity for\nself-reflection\nso like if you look at what's different\nabout humans versus most animals it's\nmetacognition\nwe can think about ourselves so instead\nof trial\njust doing pavlovian conditioning and\ntrial and error\ni can like think about myself right so\ninstead of just figuring out what works\nin relationships after i have three\nterrible relationships\nmy brain has the capacity using the\ndefault mode network to think about\nmyself\nand then i can ask myself the question\nhey am i doing something wrong in\nrelationships\nit's a meta-level question it's not like\nif you know there's like the\nrelationship level question there's the\nmetal\nam i doing something wrong not is this\nwrong in a relationship\nam i doing something wrong\nthat capacity for metacognition the\nability to think about ourselves\nis what allows us to dominate the planet\nbecause our problem-solving capability\nit's like we have an\nai in our brain that can like problem\nsolve\nit's not just pavlovian conditioning\nit's not like stimulus response\nreinforcement\nit's like thinking about something on a\nhigher level\nand that part of the brain is called our\ndefault mode network\nthe interesting thing is that default\nmode network is hyperactive in\ndepression\nso what happens in depression is we\nthink about ourselves too much\nthe circuit is stuck on oh could i be\ndoing this something better oh i'm so\ndumb\ni'm so bad the reason that i didn't get\nthat job is because i'm so bad\nyou're thinking about you instead of the\njob\nit's all like up here in a metacognitive\nlevel the oh people\nwould be better off without me oh the\nonly reason that people are inviting me\nis because they're trying to be polite\nthey could never like me\nit's all metacognitive thoughts about\nyou as a person\noutside of the actual interaction and so\nwhat we discovered is this thing called\nthe default\nnetwork and when it goes haywire which\nallows human beings to be metacognitive\nwhen it goes haywire we get depressed\nand so then you can even ask the\nquestion okay what about\nyou know so theoretically if i gave\nsomeone a chemical\nthat shot off the default mode network\nwould it cure their depression\nand the answer is yes yes it will\nwe have chemicals that do that now\nthat's how the psychedelics tend to work\ncure is a strong word but you know it's\nhow they tend to function\nand then also meditation shuts off the\ndefault remote network\ninteresting look at that meditation is a\nclinically\neffective treatment for depression and\nit happens to shut off the default mode\nnetwork\ni wonder if there's a connection just\nfrom a safety perspective they don't\ncure depression\nand secondly all of these things should\nbe used under the guidance of a medical\nprofessional\nbecause while they may have therapeutic\nbenefits from\nfor treating depression which are being\nstudied in clinical trials\njury's still out there we also want to\nbe really careful because i've seen\npatients who have had\nptsd and perm like new anxiety disorders\nfrom using psychedelics\nso it seems like like most things like\nif you think about anesthesia\nright anesthesia can keep someone alive\nafter an accident and it can also kill\nthem\nso most things in medicine like blood\nthinners are another great example of\nthis\nblood thinners can prevent you from\nforming clots and they can cause you to\nbleed to death\nso most things in medicine should be\ndone under the guidance of a medic or\nall things in medicine should be none of\nthe guidance of a medical professional\nbecause what we've discovered\nin medicine is that when you take some\nrandom ass compound that exists outside\nyou stick it in your body\nit can have good effects and it can have\nbad effects\nthat's why we train people about how to\nlike give them properly"
