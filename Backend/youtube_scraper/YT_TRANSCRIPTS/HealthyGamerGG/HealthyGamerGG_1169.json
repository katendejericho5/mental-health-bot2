    "transcript": "yo mitch hello how are you\ngood man one second there we go\nso can you hear me you can hear me right\nyeah yeah all right cool i kind of got a\nweird\nsetup going on here uh weird meaning\ni'm just holding my mic up with a glass\ncup here\ni don't know interesting yeah do what\nworks right my friend\nyeah yep yep so how you been man\ni've been all right how have you been\nbusy yeah same very busy\nnot really used to being so busy for\nsure\nyeah and so so tell me what have you\nbeen kind of\nup to it's been a while since we talked\nuh i've been up to just i've\ni stopped streaming like five months ago\nor so and i've just been like on a\ndifferent journey completely that's kind\nof what i've been up to\nyeah i saw you were streaming a lot of\nwow and it seemed like it was really\ngoing well\nyeah no i i kind of with like shadow\nlens came out and my stream was\nactually had peaked at like the highest\nheights i'd ever hit but i was still\njust like super unhappy\nyou know so i kind of just was like why\nam i continuing to do this\nit's like yeah i'm successful and like i\nhave like on the outside it all looks\ngood right but on the inside i was\ni was not good so i just decided to try\nsomething else\nwow that seems hard to do\ni mean it was actually not that hard i\nkind of just was like my heart just like\nknew it had to be done\nyou know like i i i just i just\nsomething inside of me just told me like\nthere's got to be more to this life or\nsomething you know like because i i've\nbeen streaming a long time\nand i feel like i've been in the\nenvironment of just gaming and playing\ngames for\nyou know 10 years or so so i just wanted\nto like throw myself full-fledged into\nsomething else and see what happens\ncan you help me understand you said that\nthere were like\nthings were going really well but like\nyou just knew on the inside that it was\nnot right yeah like\nlike career-wise everything was going\nwell right like from the outside\nlike from perspective but my internal\nhappiness and\nwhatever is like guiding me i don't know\nlike my spirit whatever you want to call\nit like just i just felt\ndeeply sad inside like after most of my\nstreams i would just like kind of\ni would like to take these long showers\nwhere i would just let the water just\nslap me just lay there and slap me and i\nwould just cry for hours like this was\nlike\na ritual of mine while i was like\nstreaming shadowland so it's like i\nwould go live and i'm like all good when\ni'm live but then it's when i turn off\nthe camera and it's just me\nalone i'm not okay you know so\ni just realized like why am i lying to\nmyself you know like no amount of money\nor success\nfrom twitch or any of that egotistical\nstuff that i was chasing years ago is\ngoing to make me happy and\nshadowlands was like a realization for\nme to really figure that out it was like\noh\nthis doesn't make me happy you know i\nthought if i had\nall the viewers and subs and all that i\nwould be good but i i was i was worse\nthan\nbef when i wasn't you know so it's like\nyeah that's how i knew i just\ni needed to try something different it\nwas like it was time for me to try\nsomething different\nand wow man\nthat's that's big bro\nyeah i mean it's definitely been a\njourney for sure but i've been uh i've\nbeen on a spiritual kind of like\ngrowth path for a couple years now i\nnever really shared this with twitch\nchat because i didn't think there was\nmuch relatability there\num i thought it was you know more so i\njust come on play my game get rank one\nyou know everyone's like you know thinks\ni'm a good mage and\nit's all good you know what i mean but\nyeah i've been on like a spiritual path\nfor a while now and it just kind of all\nhit me at once where i'm like\nyeah i don't know i just need to like\nfollow my heart or something like that i\ndon't know if i could\nit sounds cliche but i don't know yeah\nyou know there's a reason that cliches\nare cliches\nthat's true yeah that is true right and\nit's i i i when i hear something like\nfollow your heart\nit's the kind of thing that like a lot\nof people say but i think very few\npeople truly understand and like when\nyou understand it\nit feels like it makes so much sense\nyeah for sure it does make so much sense\ni mean just\nyou know just six months ago i don't\nknow it's like everyone thought i was\nhappy you know like literally my friends\nthey were like\neveryone thought i was happy yeah i was\ni had like i don't know like a lot of\nviewers playing\nwow shadowlands and i don't know from\nthe outside i guess people just think\nthat's happiness right like just like\nlike uh financial or like career success\nis like\nsure it's just like i don't know i just\ni really\nam struggling in this world to find\ndeeper meaning than that you know\nbecause like\nyeah i'm just i really do want to find\nsomething deeper and like\na way to express my like the real parts\nof\nme that that i haven't been able to\nexpress through streaming just because i\nfeel like\nwith streaming it's it's not as like as\nan emotional of a connection with the\nviewer that i would like i guess so that\nmakes sense\nyeah like go ahead sorry no no keep\ngoing man\nno i was just saying it's hard for me to\nrelate to like to the viewers that i had\nlike playing wow and all that\nit just didn't feel like i was making\nthat like real emotional connection and\nwhenever i would try and like open\nmyself up it's like people didn't seem\nto really care there was just pushback\nlike you know like dude shut up just\nplay well whatever you know\nso it's like i don't know i just want\npeople to like to uh that's why i\nstarted music because like it was just\nme\nalone with like a microphone and i could\njust like express my\nmy soul in a way and like i just want\npeople to be able to listen to that\nthat version of me rather than like the\nversion of me that just had to\nyou know be this like sort of character\nto on stream\nif i don't know yeah so i'm hearing that\nyou were sort of living a fake\nlife on screen uh yeah well\ni was just trying to portray a happy\nversion of myself when i wasn't actually\nhappy so if that's fake then i guess\nyeah but i was trying to portray a put\ntogether happy\nnormal functioning human when that was\nfar from the reality that i was actually\nliving\nwhat was the reality you were living\nhonestly just hell like i i really feel\nlike streaming has done a number on my\nmental health over over the years\nand i don't say that with like obviously\nstreaming has done a lot of good things\nfor me you know so it's\nnot like it's all bad i'm just saying\nthere's there's a lot of\nthings with it that that sort of did a\nnumber on me\nuh over the years and\ni i wish i had like sort of taken this\nleap of faith sooner in my life to be\nhonest with you because\ni've been very much so a lot more\nmyself and able to express myself and\njust be\nhappier in general since i stopped\nstreaming uh but\na lot of the reason that i kind of was\ntook this\nleap of faith was just like obviously\nyou know the reckful passed away\nand that was a like giant moment for me\nto be like wow\nlike this [ __ ] is never the same for me\nagain like for real that was like a\nmoment where i realized it would never\nbe the same again\nand uh i don't know i think a lot of\nother broadcasters talked about how\nreckful touched them or whatever but\nlike\ni i just i had like a super deep\nfriendship with byron for many years\nlike we go back to like 2012\nplaying you know cataclysm wow together\nbefore twitch was even really a thing\nand\nbefore anyone made like any money doing\nit so it was like\nto me that event just like hit me like a\nbrick and it still does\nand i i sound like uh yeah it's like\ni don't know it still really haunts me\nthough that he's gone\ncan you help me understand what changed\nfor you when\nbyron passed away i just realized that\ni don't have as much time as i thought\nyou know i really\nrealized that it's not like\nlike i was always living in the past\nhoping that the past would\nhappen again and then once he\npassed away i realized the past will\nnever happen again and i need to stop\nchasing on to something that doesn't\nexist anymore\ndamn dude that's deep yeah that's\nsad that's kind of how i feel about it\nso yeah i'm very thankful though for all\nthe twitch stuff you know what i mean\nlike i had a great career it was dope\nand i'm hoping that i'm really hoping\nthat i can express myself in a different\nmanner and people\nwill be uh okay with\nthe the deeper parts of me you know not\nlike the shallow fart jokes\non twitch but like the deeper parts of\nme i hope people would like\nwant to see what's up with that too\nyeah man well so help me understand a\nlittle bit\nwhat is it what is it that makes you\n[Music]\nhow can i say this so it seems like some\npeople\nare really happy with a slice of mitch\nright not the whole pie they're good\nwith this yes\nyeah not for sure go ahead sorry\nand so i'm just kind of wondering a\nlittle bit about like\nyou know why does\neveryone or not maybe not everyone but\nbut you know what are you like\nwould it be okay if people weren't happy\nwith the rest of the pie\nyou know what yeah i'm sure because i\ndidn't get it\ni was just like i'm getting a sense that\nyou want to share more and you want to\nconnect more\nand yeah i'm a little bit confused\nbecause\nit seems to me like something about our\nlanguage is kind of falling apart where\ni'm getting a sense of words that sound\nlike you're looking for approval\nbut the feeling that i'm getting from\nyou is not really about approval at all\nand i just want to try to understand\nthat\nyou know that boundary between like\ngiving people what they want and wanting\nthem to give them more\nand like wanting to give them something\nauthentic and wanting them to accept it\nyeah that's kind of the way yeah that's\nthat's probably\nhow i would say is like i just want to\nbe\nmy authentic self and make art rather\nthan just like you know i do something\ndeeply meaningful\nfor like me i guess you know like i want\nto i want to do something deeply\nmeaningful for me and i\ni have like a weird story i mean um and\ni feel like\na lot of people might be able to relate\nto that weird story yeah i'd love to\nhear it\nyeah for sure i have i have a crazy\nstory like with with all\nall of it i mean i don't we don't\nprobably have enough time to go into\neverything but\nyeah i have a really really uniquely odd\nstory and you know i might just be some\ndumb kid from\nbaltimore or whatever like i've never\nreally struggled financially because\ni've had like you know the twitch\nsuccess from an early age and stuff but\ni think that actually may be a part of\nwhy i fundamentally have grown up\nawkwardly if that makes sense like i\nthink um\ni didn't really understand at like a\nyoung age\nwhat i really had and it's like\nit just sort of took control what is\nwhat did you have at a young age\ni was just fortunate enough to not grow\nup financially struggling like i grew up\nyou know going to private school all of\nthat and then i\ni got big and started making money on\ntwitch was like 20 21\nyou know so it's like i didn't really\nhave the traditional\nlike glo grow up and it's like i feel\nlike as i got more successful i became\nmore lonely\num it's like a weird like double-edged\nsword type thing\num yeah so i've had like the material\nthings that humans\nlike sir saw like search after right but\ni never really had\nlike deep love or anything that i really\nfelt like i could connect to like\non that level and truthfully like i'm a\nvery emotional\nspiritual like person and\ni've never really shared that i always\nkind of dumb myself down and made myself\nout to be this just like clown\nstir wow player right yeah and uh for me\ni feel like that was\ni did myself a huge dis justice and it\njust this justice\nin that way i uh i i i regret doing that\na bit but it's like at the same time\nthat's what made me successful so it's\nlike\nit's just you know fighting the\ndouble-edged sword that is i'm sure\nthere's a lot of parallels like this\nwith any career path right um\nso yeah\nyeah i mean you know i i\nit's interesting i i find that the\ndouble-edged sword isn't so much with\nthe career path but it's more with us\num for sure and but at the same time\ni kind of hear you loud and clear\nbecause i think that it's it's you know\nyou can\neasily make an argument that there's a\ncost\nto being a successful personality on the\ninternet\nyeah and there's like i just wish i had\nguidance in any way like i didn't really\nhave\nmuch family guidance going into this\nlike my father was always pretty much\nlike uh\njust obsessed with his work and his his\nbusiness and all that and like he\nand i told you you know about the\nsituation about my mother she's you know\nshe's not really able to be there for me\nbecause she's\nextremely ill and then i have a brother\nwith autism who's currently\nin some mental hospital probably like i\ndon't know like the last time i spoke to\nhim was like a year or two ago and\nthere's just a lot of things that weigh\nheavy on my conscious and um\nyeah so like from the outside i had all\nthis [ __ ] success and all this [ __ ]\nbut it's like i i\ni just it didn't do anything for the\npain inside man like i i really feel\nlike\ni had a i had a really good thing with\nlike a couple friends that i met\nlike reckful being one of them and it's\nlike\ni don't know i feel alone in the world\nbut\nit's all good because um\ni don't know i'm just i'm gonna find a\nway to like shed this pain you know one\nway or another\nwhen you say it's all good help me\nunders\ndoesn't seem all good no it's not i'm\nnot all good right now but i know\nin the future i i've like i've done a\nlot of work on like self-reflection and\nlike\nyou know just pretty much just like\nemotionally like become more intelligent\nand\nnot only that with like body mind spirit\nchakras whatever you want to say\nso eventually i will do the work that is\nnecessary to\nbe a human again but right now i'm\nsort of doing uh i'm just kind of seeing\ni'm on like a path right now that i have\nto see through if that makes sense\nyeah so you gotta you gotta get to the\nend of your journey\nand this is maybe the tough part yeah\nit's kind of\nthe dark valley that you have to get\nthrough to kind of come out the other\nside\nyeah for sure yeah and i\ncan i just think for a second mitch\nabsolutely man\nno big deal i feel like i'm playing a\nlot of catch up\nbecause i i i think um it's it's clear\nto me that you've been walking a very\nserious journey for some time now\nand uh i'm just trying to recalibrate\nfrom the person that i\nfirst spoke to because you seem like\nyou've changed a lot in a good way\noh i've definitely changed you know when\nyou sort of just have to look at\nyourself in the mirror and just be\nhonest\nlike that moment happened to me and let\nme tell you the person i was looking at\n[ __ ] hated i hated the person i was\nlooking at that's why i was like\ni just saw this insecure sad dude\nrunning away from\neverything that makes him hurt and just\nhiding behind this mask\nof like streaming success or whatever\nyou want to call it just like sort of\nmaybe i wasn't like\nhiding full-on hiding but i was\ndefinitely running away\nlike my anxiety my anxiety and\nall the things that i have like held\ndeep inside myself\ni just ran away from them you know it\ngoes back to like\nme feeling like i don't really have many\ndeep connections\nyou know i i really don't have anyone to\nreally call\nyou know it's like if i if i'm like for\nexample this talk i'm having with you\ni don't feel like i could have this talk\nwith my own father and he's like the\nonly one\nin my family that is even like\ncoherently enough to like hold a\nconversation with me\nand that sucks\nwhat what gets in the way of you being\nable to have a conversation like this\nwith your dad\nhe just isn't there emotionally for me\nand\nhe never really was i think he's working\non it now that he's getting older\nbut at the same time i i think to my\nfather i'm just some sort of like prop\nto him like it's\nlike i'm his only son that is like\nfunctional and has a career and is doing\nstuff and\nlike he to him i'm just sort of like\nlike\nhis only thing to carry his name or\nwhatever you want to call it i\ntruthfully i think if i had an older\nbrother that was doing\nother things my dad would never even\ntalk to me that's actually how i feel\nwow yeah\nso i'm kind of almost hearing that your\nvalue is sort of\nnot based on you as a person but sort of\nlike the role you\nfill yeah you're like the\ncarrier of the legacy yeah for sure\nand there's some crazy things that i've\ngone through with uh i don't know how\npersonal i can get but there are some\ncrazy things that i've gone through\nin terms of just like betrayal in that\nregard where\ni was just like put in charge of things\nthat i really shouldn't have been at a\nyoung age you know\ni mean you can share you understand\ntwitch terms of service better than i do\ni'm happy to hear whatever you want to\nshare but also\nyou know you don't you don't have to\ntalk about that stuff i think there's\nplenty that we can talk about in terms\nof your spiritual journey but\nfor sure i just think uh if yeah it's\nnothing like tos or anything like that\nit's more of just like morally incorrect\nthings that have sort of happened i\nguess but yeah like we don't have to\ndive deep into some deep\ncrazy stuff if you don't if you it's up\nto you\nwell let me kind of lay out how i think\nabout that mitch and then you tell me\nwhether we should dive in\nso what i'm hearing what i'm hearing at\nthe core of it\nis that there's mitch jones\nand then there's mitch right there's\nlike the streamer personality there's\nthe\ni still remember the first time we\ntalked i still remember you kind of said\nbut it's all good i'm mitch jones\nyeah i remember that and and so i think\nit must have been like over a year ago\nbut like that\nman just the way you said that really\nencapsulated\nthat there's like this persona on the\noutside\nand then there's like the person inside\nlike moving the levers\nyeah for sure and on the outside it's\nlike a big smile and lots of fun and\ninside there's a dude who's like\nexhausted and sweaty and like can't get\na breath of fresh air\nyeah for sure uh i think the mitch jones\nthing you're talking about\nis gone now like i even when i even when\ni stream shadow lines i was not really\nputting on\nan act it was more of just like being\nmyself playing wow\nand trying to put out the best version\nof myself but truthfully mitch jones the\nstreamer whatever person persona\nwhatever you want to call it\ni think that person died when reckful\nwhen reckful died like truthfully like i\ni just i couldn't do it anymore\nand um yeah yeah\ndo you remember earlier when i was like\ni need a second to process because you\nseem like a different person yeah for\nsure\nand i need to catch up i think what i'm\ngrappling with is that i don't i don't\ndetect a whole lot of mitch jones so i\nwas like wait this is weird\nyeah no i've really i really dug into\nmyself and that's why\ni start that's why i changed you know\nfrom twitch streaming to like music\nbecause\ni just want to be me\nand give that you know whether it's\npainful or not like i need to\ngive whatever it is that my soul is like\nit's just i need to just be open heart\ni don't want to be a closed heart\nanymore walking around you know\nso i think that's sounds like it's i'd\nlove to talk about\nthat when it comes back to your dad i\nwant to just share a couple of thoughts\nso what i'm really getting the sense of\nis that what you want more than anything\nelse\nis to be connected and that there was\nsort of like a farce that you could put\non\nbecause at the end of the day there were\nlike a couple of like people like byron\nwho you did feel connected to and so\nthat was kind of enough\nbut really losing him has helped you\nrealize like\nyou really need to be seen you need to\nbe heard you need to be\ni don't even want to say accepted but\nyou need to be treated with authenticity\nand even if that's acceptance that's\nfine and even if that's rejection if\npeople say like your music sucks\noddly enough i think you may be okay\nwith that as long as they're straight\nwith you that they see you for who you\nare\nand you say this is not for me or this\nis for me you're actually\nokay either way yeah i'm good i i'm like\ni said i\ni know who i am and what i need to do\nyou know what i'm saying and um i'm more\nso just trying to\nshow a deeper side of myself and i am\nokay with acceptance or not acceptance\neither way\nit's like you know i'm not looking for\nvalidation externally i more so\ni've done the work internally to be able\nto share what\ni have to say i guess rather than just\ngiving this\nuh i don't know i think streaming in\ngeneral has just changed a lot\nand uh i think the game now is more just\nlike\nit's just a big pr\nfest of [ __ ] and it doesn't really feel\nas genuine as when i\nwas a part of it back like five six\nyears ago\nand i'm just not really down for the\ngame anymore if that makes sense\nsure you're\nyou got too much actual living to do to\nbe pretending to live\nyeah i mean i've been in the back end of\nstreaming and like the forefront of\nstreaming for a long time like i've seen\nit all\nso i know i just know\nand i know it doesn't do anything for\nlike for like\na deeper meaning it doesn't do [ __ ] like\nyou know\ntrue yeah so kind of the reason i\nmention this is\nbecause if we think a little bit about\nyou know the stuff potentially like the\nweird stories of uh\nyou know whatever betrayal or whatever\nyeah if what you're looking for is\nconnection\nright because that's really what i'm\nhearing is that yeah exactly\nexactly it's exactly what i'm looking\nfor i just want\npeople to feel me for me because i gave\npeople this thing that wasn't me and i\njust like i feel like i want\npeople to really feel like the actual\nme you know and it's not like an\nacceptance thing i just need them to\nknow\nbefore i go that that's like\nthat that person is and was there\nbecause people seem to have this like\npreconceived notion of me uh from years\nago\nhow i was like a jackass and all that\nbut that that was part of the job for me\nand you know and i felt like i was\ncreating a show whereas like now\ni just want to be uh\ni just want to be seen for who i am not\nfor like\nsomething that was built as like a\ncareer\nif that makes sense okay\nsounds wonderful and also i'm a\ntiny tiny tiny bit alarmed\nbecause you said before i go i'm curious\nwhat do you mean by that\ni i'm more so mean like before i just\ndrop off the social media grid\nokay yeah like i have a long term plan\nof just ending up\nnot in the public at all you know\nuh it's kind of just like like i said\nit's hard to\nreally be an actual like human when you\nhave to look at all of these different\nopinions of you\nevery single day and yeah you can just\nnot look at it but like you know that\nshit's like\nlike how do you create art without\nconnecting with your\nyou know the people that are following\nit you know what i'm saying\nso yeah yeah so what i'm kind of hearing\nis that\nyou're on a journey to find who you are\nyou want to share that with other people\nthey can accept or reject it\nbut that being engaged with them in a\nsocial media pr\nfest will actually negatively impact\nyour journey because then it'll be about\ngiving people what they want and you\nneed to pull away from all that\nso that you can continue to create yeah\nfor sure i think\nbeing truly creative especially in an\nartistic way like whether you make art\nor\nwhether you're a musician or whatever\nyou do i think it's very important to be\nin at peace with yourself and really be\nable to express yourself right like if\nyou're\nliving this like reality where you're\njust juggling like five different\ndifferent\nlike you know uh the social media sphere\nwhere it's like a ladder climbing\nreality like if you're living that\nthen i don't think you can create like\ntrue art in my in my opinion and like\ni'm just trying to really\npaint a beautiful picture of some pain\nthat i've gone through\nyou know yeah yeah it's interesting i\nthink uh\nyou know what we create is content\nyeah content there you go so [ __ ]\nsoulless\nyeah for sure you know\nit's interesting because even even here\nat healthy gamer what we create is\ncontent and yeah true i mean it's all\ncontent right\nyeah so i think it's interesting because\ni think internally we we also have a\nyou know kind of a process of like you\nknow what\nwhat do we want to do here do we want to\ngrow or do we want to help people\nand sometimes those are at odds with\neach other\nfor sure and i do think sometimes people\nget caught up in a good thing that's bad\nfor them\nwhich is i think i think sometimes\nthere's good things that are not the but\nit's not the correct thing for people\nbut because it's good\nthey stay doing it and they're not\nunhappy right like\nit's like someone that has you know a\ncrazy position at like some\njob that they work for and they're\nmaking you know a lot of money or\nwhatever but they're just like\nthey're not really fulfilling themselves\nin a way that like their\ndeeper self wants to like express itself\nyeah so how would you know well i knew\nwhen i just looked in the mirror and i\nwanted to beat the [ __ ] out of that\nperson in the mirror that's what i knew\ni knew\ni i just knew like you know it just hit\nme like but\nbut i only was able to get to that point\nbecause i was doing like off stream i\nwas doing work on myself to like because\ni was just extremely depressed i was you\nknow\nand i was like how do i fix this like\ni've always been a problem solver kind\nof guy\nso i was like how do i fix this and the\nonly way i was able to really like\nit's not like i fixed it but the only\nway i was able to like get pieces of\nuh the pain to like sort of shed off of\nme i didn't have to wear it as much was\njust through\nlike the things that you told me like\nmeditation uh really diving deep\ninto uh just yoga uh\ndefinitely food that you eat all that's\nlike cleansing my body sort of like\nenabled my mind to like shed that pain\nand it was a painful experience and for\na while i was absolutely crazy\nbut i came out the other end knowing a\nlot more about myself\neven if it was a painful journey to go\nthrough can you tell me about that\njourney\nsure i mean i i was nuts for a while\nlike\ni was on like i tried all these diets i\nshowed like keto i tried\nintermittent fasting i even fasted for\n10 days straight where i didn't eat\nanything i just drank water for 10 days\ni did all these things just like\nbecause you know i was just researching\nlike on the web that's where i've\nlearned everything it's just like\non the internet so you kind of have to\ndecipher like what is valuable\ninformation what isn't and not like be\nan idiot about it but\nuh yeah i was just like sort of like\nteaching myself more about the human\nbody and the human mind how it works all\nthat\nso i think i i don't know i think i\ndefinitely learned a lot but it was a\npainful experience for sure\nso mitch i'm you you kind of you'll use\nthese words that have a lot of\nvolume but i'm not quite sure what i'm\nhearing you'll say i was crazy for a\nwhile\nso i'm getting oh well you were on the\noutside i was crazy\nyeah well a lot of people\ni feel like would view me as like crazy\nor something if i'm just like doing all\nthis like it looks manic like sort of\nright but\nto me it was like something i had to go\nthrough does that make sense\nsort of because i i don't i'm\nlike i can understand your conclusion\nbut i'm having a lot of trouble\nunderstanding like you know when you\nwere doing let's say keto or\nintermittent fasting\nwhat were you experiencing what were you\nlooking for\nwhat you know i get that you come out\nthe other side\nbut cleanse yeah i was looking at this\ncleanse spiritually\nmentally physically all of it how did\nyou know you needed to cleanse\nbecause i was miserable i was i had the\nmost anxiety out of any human i'd ever\nmet i would wake up every day and\nconstantly check my heartbeat just to\nsee if it was beating and if it was\nbeating too fast\ni would assume that i'm having like a\nheart attack or something like it was\nlike i was literally crazy with anxiety\nand the only thing that gave me a little\nbit of peace from that was\ncleansing my body uh like truthfully\nlike\nif i had kept eating the same way and\nkeeping the same stress levels that i\nhad from streaming and i stressed myself\ni was streaming because\nit was always like this like numbers\ngame right and like if i if my [ __ ]\nwasn't doing well like\ni had to pretty much just destroy the\npart of my ego that gave a [ __ ] about\nstreaming because that part of me was\ndestroying me whether it was like making\nme successful or not\nthat part of me was absolutely\ndestroying me and i\nliterally had to just kill that part of\nme because\nliving every day just like like if i had\na bad stream the rest of the day i would\nfeel like i was a failure\ni was a loser i was a [ __ ] up whatever\nyou know\nand i just had to destroy that part of\nme because i literally could not keep\nliving like that\nhow how do you destroy that part of you\njust taking a lot of time off of\nstreaming and healing and not looking at\nsocial media going for walks in the\nwoods becoming\na [ __ ] human again you know like\nthat's what helped me a lot actually was\njust\nnot being plugged in and just being\ncompletely unplugged sort of living a\nboring life for a while but\nthat boring life sort of gave me\nuh i i guess you could call it a\ndopamine fast for a long time you know\nyeah interesting um\nit was funny a couple weeks ago speaking\nof content i i did a\ni did a a quick debunk of the dopamine\nfast\nand and talked a little bit about it but\num\nyou know it's interesting mitch because\ni hear you say you had to kill that part\nof you but what i'm sort of hearing is\nthat you\nsort of let it wither out and die is it\nyeah yeah\nyeah i would say withered yeah i didn't\njust like slay with a sword die it sort\nof\nit died a slow painful death yeah for\nsure but eventually like i said i came\nout the other side happier like\neven today like i'm still sad like\nobviously in this conversation it's a\nlittle bit more sad because i'm\ndigging deep into the things that i\nstill haven't really come to full\nfruition and like dealt with right\nthere's still a lot of things that hide\ninside of me and i have to deal with\nthose but\nyeah yeah i mean i think that it's\nimportant to remember that\nthe goal of spirituality is not to not\nfeel sad anymore because sadness is a\npart of life\nit's to sort of feel peace or\ntranquility\nin the face of sadness yeah or in the\nface of\nexcitement yeah um and and i do get the\nsense mitch that you're\nmore at peace now than i've ever seen\nyou\ni am more at peace now and i have music\nto thank for that truthfully\ni think that putting all of my energy\ninto a different outlet\nthat isn't just like built with that\nimmediate feedback that twitch had\nlike it just makes me slow down and able\nto\nlive a better lifestyle if that makes\nsense\nyeah can you tell me a little bit about\nhow music has helped you\nabsolutely uh when i first started music\ni was just kind of [ __ ] around\nor messing around with uh you know some\nviewers of mine or whatever\nand then after like a couple songs i was\nlike you know i kind of want to try and\nmake like a heartfelt song right and\nthen i was like thinking\nto myself like what bothers me the most\nright now and what bothered me the most\nwhat still bothers me the most is the\nfact that rick was no longer here\nand i decided to just put all that pain\ninto into a song\nand uh in the first verse there's like a\nmemory i have with reckful that uh this\none haunts me like crazy is um\na week before he died i was at\nuh his like condo downtown with like his\nhis roommate merc i was hanging out with\nhis roommate merc and it was like 3 a.m\nor something\num but merc was like yeah like you can\njust pass out down down they had like\ntwo condos right so he's like you could\njust pass out at the condo\nuh below no one's there he told me no\none was there and i go down there\nand i walk into the kitchen and i just\nlook over and i just see byron\nlike on the balcony just kind of like\nlooking off into the sky\nyou know and he was just like you know\njust pondering like thinking whatever\nand i in that moment i was like i should\ngo\nyou know say something or talk to him\nand i was like too scared to i was like\noh he might not want to see me or like\nyou know maybe he doesn't want to talk\nright now maybe he's just you know\nhaving a moment to himself whatever\nso i just i thought you know i really\njust turned around and went back\nupstairs\nand then a week later he's gone so like\nin the first verse of that song it's\nlike\ni kind of talk about that that that that\nstory\nand um i don't really go into the same\ndetail that i just told you\nbut it's like i kind of put everything i\nhad into\nthat song when it came to the pain that\ni was dealing with from that situation\nand i still live in regret every day not\nnot being able to say anything\nto him that day what do you regret about\nnot being able to speak to him that day\nmy fear and anxiety stop me from from\nsaying something to him and i'll never\nget a chance to say anything again\ni literally saw him a week before he\ndied\nand i said nothing\nit haunts me like really badly\nwhen you say haunts you how does that\naffect you\nnightmares um\njust i don't know it's like this like i\nlike whenever i really deeply think\nabout it i just get this overwhelming\nsense of like grief i guess it's like uh\nit's like uh like i messed up or\nsomething you know\ni'm gonna think for a second okay mitch\nyeah you're fine\nwhat does your mind tell you would have\nhappened if you did not\nlet your fear and anxiety control you in\nthat moment\ni think i could have i think i could\nhave had a conversation i think i could\nhave helped byron because at this time i\nwas on some spiritual journey and\nwhether i'm an idiot or not\ni'd like to believe that i've learned\nsome things and that i could have maybe\nyou know\njust showed him that there's other ways\nto find happiness you know like uh\ni think he was already on a spiritual\njourney of his own but\ni i think that i i don't know like if i\nhad just spoken to him i think it would\nhave\ni think it could have sparked something\nthat may have\nhelped you know so i think it's fair to\nsay that\nif you had said something it could have\nsparked something\nthat could have helped yeah that's a\nvery accurate assessment\nand at the same time i i don't know\nmitch if you've gotten to this point\nin your journey but like you know a big\npart of my\nunderstanding of the journey is that\nlike things\nhave to happen in a particular time and\nplace\nthat you can regret as much as you want\nto about the past\nbut at the end of the day it's the past\nthat makes you the person that you are\ntoday yeah\num i know yeah i know\ni'm just saying the person i am today i\nstill have a lot of work to do\ni just yeah it's like i live every like\nthe red sickness that we talked about\nlast year has gotten worse but like i've\nfound ways of uh coping you know\ninternally\nbut truthfully like yeah i feel alone as\n[ __ ] man like i do\nand uh i'm trying my best\nto to cope with like\nyou know and it's like on the internet i\nalmost wasn't allowed to be sad you know\nit's like oh\nyou're [ __ ] making this much money or\nwhatever like you're successful like\nshut the [ __ ] up like that's kind of\nwhat i was like just like this boot up\nmy ass like you know i'm not allowed\nit was like it just felt like a very i\njust couldn't be in that environment you\nknow so i had to\nstop yeah i had to just stop\nso you know mitch i'm a little bit\ncurious you know what\ni mean i could send data your way i\ndon't think that would really help\num i've read a lot of data\nlike i said i don't think it would help\num\nyou know it's hard so you know i deal\nwith suicide a lot\nas a psychiatrist i think it's really\nchallenging for people to\nyou know i think just about every person\nthat i've talked to who's a survivor\nafter\nsomeone they love or care about commit\nsuicide has thoughts or experiences like\nyours\nright like they their mind finds one\nmoment in particular\nand it'll sort of like think about\nit'll usually involve personal weakness\nyeah right like where you'll say like if\ni had been stronger than\ndot dot dot yeah\nand but the thing is the person i am now\ni feel like i would have made a\ndifferent uh decision\nyeah and so this is where if you want to\nget like you know off the deep end of\nspirituality like what we have to\nunderstand\nis that the person that\nyou are now\nwas born out of that tragedy was born\nout of that moment\nyeah what do you think about that\ni think\nit awoke me in a way but it's like i\ndon't know if i was ready to be awoken\nthat way but it happened regardless of\nwhat if i was ready or not\nand yeah i think it\nit took me on a journey of like i said\nspiritual like\na spiritual journey to where i started\ncaring less and less about my ego and\nmore and more about\ninner peace\nbro the whole [ __ ] internet was so\nso asleep that that's what it took to\nwake us up\nyeah right when you say you weren't\nready\nyou're right you weren't ready and yeah\nwell that's\nwhy that's why it was necessary\nright because sometimes it takes a big\nass wake-up call\nand so i think this is where like this\nmay sound kind of weird but like i'm\ngonna lay a burden at your feet\nbecause if this is the price that was\npaid to wake you up\nyou better [ __ ] be awake now which i\nthink you understand\ni'm definitely awake man and i am just\ntrying to change\nthe whole thing like i'm trying to\nchange everything that i used to do and\ndo things in a in a correct way\nuh yeah and that's why i i do still\nstruggle a little bit with like the\ninternet stuff because like\nyou know there's obviously some people\nthat say some pretty [ __ ] up [ __ ] to\nme and it's like uh\ni don't really want to get into it but\nuh yeah i read some terrible things like\nuh because i know people just don't seem\nto do their research or know\nlike how like i don't know yeah\nthat is true yeah people people tend to\nmake judgments very easily\nand and you know there's a correlation\nbetween not doing your research and\nmaking judgments which is that\nthe more research you do i think the\nharder it is to make a judgment\nyeah and so what we end up with is a\nbunch of people who make judgments\nwithout doing any research because\nthat's the only way you can do it\nyeah i just i don't know i've never been\nsomeone that does that too often\nespecially yeah i don't know so to me\nit's\nhard for me to relate to that like i\nwould never comment on someone else's\nlike [ __ ]\nwithout like knowing what the [ __ ]\nhappened yeah\ni think that that's a healthy way to go\nthrough life but\nit's hard to do that right it takes a\nlot of effort it's a lot easier to just\njudge but\nfor sure for sure and i i don't think\nthat should matter like i think\nyou know if i was a strong if i was as\nstrong as i\nwant to be and am capable of being i\ndon't think i would even pay any mind to\nthat but\ntruthfully it's like i was raised on the\ninternet and like it just like\nthe opinions of people on the internet\nobvi you know they just\nit matters to me right just because this\nis like to me it's like\nit's like i've been my whole life you\nknow so it's uh it's hard to look at it\nfrom a different\npoint of view but that's what i'm\nworking toward is looking at it from a\ndifferent point of view\nabsolutely yeah i mean i think like you\nsaid we were all raised on the internet\nso it's just how we how we function i\nwas absolutely raised on the internet\nfor sure which is like maybe a bad thing\nbut\ndefinitely was raised on the internet\nyeah so this is also where i'd kind of\nthink a little bit karmically for a\nsecond i'd say it's i don't think it's a\nbad thing it's\nit's what you needed right so if you\nthink about your struggles and even\ni venture to say your contributions what\ni want\nwhat i'm seeing in you i don't know if\nthis is actually true or not\nbut what i'm seeing in you mitch is like\nyou are not alone\nin your struggle you are not alone in\nbeing a child of the internet and\nactually like\neven more so today children that are\nborn born today will be more a children\nof the\nchild of the internet than you were\nright because things are getting worse i\nthink you're right i think they are\ngetting worse\nso if you think about it you had a\ncouple of years before as you put it\ntwitch became pr [ __ ] but now\neveryone coming up on twitch is existing\nin this current\nworld yeah which this current world i\nfeel like\nis just filled with manipulation and\nwhat can you do for me\nand all these people that are just\nrunning around with their heads cut off\ntrying to like build this false sense of\nego and add things to their resume\nand then they're gonna wake up one day\nand be like wow i wasted my whole life\nchasing a dragon that didn't even make\nme happy and i'm glad that i realized\nthat at a young age because\nif i didn't i would still be that\n[ __ ] idiot person you know sitting\nthere and doing this like\nshallow-ash [ __ ] trying to make myself\nfeel like i'm cool\nyeah so hopefully your music will help\npeople get there\nyeah for sure you know\nso i'd also be a little bit careful\nbecause i'm still detecting some amount\nof\nego and judgment towards them what do\nyou think\nbitterness who's them i don't know\nbut you're talking about you're talking\nabout people\noh yeah no i yeah you're right for sure\nno i definitely have\na little bit of like resentment and\nstuff towards like\njust like ignorance in the world i\nreally like\nand when i say people it's more so just\nlike the manipulation that\nis like behind the scenes it's not\nreally like the viewers or any of that\nit's more of just like\nthe things that i've seen on the back\nend of just straight\nas9 like some acting that deserves an\noscar winning a war type [ __ ] you know\ni've\njust seen i've seen everything man and\nuh\nit's sad to see just the masses be\nfooled on a [ __ ] scale that's like\ni don't really feel like getting more\ndeep into it but uh it's just\ni've seen it all just trust me i've seen\nit all\nyeah i i don't doubt that you've seen it\nall i'm just a little bit confused and i\nwant to be careful because i don't you\nknow i don't want to push you into\nstarting drama and at the same time oh\nit has nothing to do with anyone like no\ndrama none of that [ __ ] like this\nthis honestly stems from like my father\nand other things like that like\nobviously this happens on the\nyou know it's it's just a lot of things\ni just feel like i have trouble trusting\npeople because of\nthe experiences i've gone through okay\nyeah so now we're gonna kind of take a\ni'm going to take a slightly different\napproach\nmitch just toss something out you decide\nwhether it's worth pursuing\nso i feel like we were talking a little\nbit more spiritually and the reason i\nhad mentioned your father i'm\nglad you brought him up again is because\nif your challenge\nis to connect with other humans okay\nlet's say that like i feel alone\ni think if we want to try to understand\nthat there's absolutely a spiritual\nelement that we've talked about it's\nlike hey i put on a mask\ni become this person that i want to be i\nhate what i see when i look in the\nmirror\nshedding that mask letting that ego\nwither away starting your creative\nprocess\nputting something out there that is\nauthentically you giving people an\nopportunity to connect with that\nwe walk down that road there's another\nelement here\num which we can talk more about that i\ndon't think that's done\nbut there's another element here which\nis just very simply from like a\npsychological standpoint from a social\nconditioning standpoint\nif you're telling me that your problem\nis loneliness\nand you're telling me that you've been\ndeeply betrayed\nas long as that emotional energy of\nbetrayal and that\nthe conditioning the adaptations that\nhappened in your mind due to that\nbetrayal exist\nit's gonna be hard to connect to other\npeople bro\noh yeah for sure but i feel like i've\ndone a good job of forgiving those\npeople like\nthat's the first step to me was like\nforgiveness of the betrayal but it\ndoesn't it doesn't\nlike fill the hole that still exists you\nknow like i have forgived\nforgave most you know everything that's\nhappened to me\nand like especially on the internet [ __ ]\nlike i give i could give a [ __ ] about\nthat\nbut it's yeah like there's people in\nchat saying train for example but me and\ntrain talk daily and are like are good\nfriends so\nlike this is again like the ignorance\ndoes bother me a little bit because that\nguy who typed that didn't do his\nresearch and for me that's annoying but\nlike\ni don't know that's just part of why i\nquit streaming you know\ni don't feel like babysitting all day so\nbut i then what do you think why do you\nwhat's the whole\nif you've forgiven what's left what help\nme understand that\nuh what do you mean so you said like\nlike you've\nyou've learned how to authentically\nforgive which you know\nsure i'll if that's what you're saying i\ni think\ni trust you there but i'm curious then\nlike what's the hole that's\nleft you said the hole that's it doesn't\nrepair the hole or doesn't fill the hole\nyeah i think the hole that's left is\njust\nlike i said i i want to express myself\nin\na true manner you know that's like the\nwhole and obviously\nonce i do that i feel like maybe i'll be\nable to connect with people\neasier and not have as many walls put up\nor whatever whatever is like stopping me\nfrom\nexperiencing like love or\nsomething like similar to that you know\njust like deep connections i guess\nso mitch at this point i think i'm about\nto ask you to tell me more or i'm i am i\ndo actually at this point want to know a\nlittle bit more about your dad\nbut let me first explain my reasoning\nsure so what i what i'm hearing is that\nyou feel uh\nemptiness and lack of connection on the\ninside and what yeah\nwhat you fi what you've hypothesized so\nyou've started on this spiritual journey\nand you're going to create this music\nand you're going to share it with the\nworld and you'll\nhopefully connect with people yeah in my\nexperience\nthat is going to be an important but\ninsufficient step\nfor sure and and so i think that what\ni'm hearing is that you have\nwalls up but making music may be a part\nof that process\nbut there's a part of me that just the\nway you're describing things\nmakes me feel like maybe there's\nsomething to be learned or gained from\nlike\nunderstanding more of the details\nbecause you you\nyou know all the details and based on\nthe details you've come up with a\nhypothesis\nyeah if we think about you know what i\ntry to do and what i try to help people\nwith\nit's it's not just to sort of fulfill\nthe plan that they've created\nit's actually to sort of figure out if\nthe way that you've constructed your\nhypothesis is\nmissing something and this is the first\ntime during our conversation where\ni feel like maybe something is not\nadding up for me like with all the\nspiritual stuff oddly enough with the\ngrief stuff things like that\nall that stuff like i'm with you 100 i\nthink i like i think it makes perfect\nsense\nfor some reason i'm getting the sense\nthat there's a blind spot something\nabout\nwith what you're talking about now yeah\nfor sure\nthere definitely is a blind spot i just\nthink it's uh\nit's a lot to indulge into but i mean i\ncan tell you\nwhat like what bothers me and i don't\nknow i just\nit's hard to explain i just feel as\nthough i'm constricted of what i can say\njust because i do really feel as though\nmy father is all that i do have and even\nthough our relationship is [ __ ]\nit's like maybe one day wouldn't be and\nif i just air out\nall of the shitty things that have\nhappened that i'm just forever closing\nthat portal i guess\nokay i'm so glad you shared that because\nlet's think about this okay so\nnumber one our our north star our\nprimary compass is we do not want to\nhave a conversation with you or do\nanything\nthat will hurt you in any way shape or\nform\nokay so if if you feel like talking\nabout the stuff and\nairing this [ __ ] out is going to\nnegatively impact your relationship with\nyour father we don't want to do it\nwell i don't even think he would ever\nsee this because he's never given\na [ __ ] about what i've done on the\ninternet so but regardless\nyeah yeah so then this is the thing\nright so like i think this is what i'm\nkind of picking up on like\nyou're kind of thinking if you air this\n[ __ ] it'll close the portal forever\ni know it sounds kind of weird it's the\nthis will close the door\nforever if i do this thing\nthat's not how life works\nright i mean sometimes you can have\ncatastrophic events like\ndeath right where doors are sort of\nclosed forever\nbut you know that's the rarity and what\ni'm wondering is\nif that fear of closing the door forever\nis part of what is actually the problem\nyeah it probably is part of the problem\ni actually do have\na lot of fear about that like i've\nwanted to speak about the things that\nthat have like really bothered me about\nthat situation but i've sort of kept it\nto myself\num and um yeah it's\nit's something that is difficult to\nthink and speak about for sure\nyeah so now we have a choice okay so i'm\ngoing to toss out one statement this is\ngoing to be inflammatory\nit may evoke emotions but in the past\nmitch\nhave you has your fear controlled what\nyou want to say\nright so like here we are again where we\nwant to\nwe want to give you time and space but\nlike i'm going to point it out to you\nbecause if your fear\nof saying something like we actually\ndon't want to hurt you right we don't\nwant\nyou to do anything that's going to like\nend up bad so we want to be sensitive\nthat we don't want to create drama we\ndon't want to ruin your relationship\nwith your dad but if he ain't gonna\nwatch it then like that fear is all in\nhere\nyeah it is internally yeah it is it is\nyeah\nit is internally i have a\nit's it's just so [ __ ] up man like i\ndon't i don't know\nso once again if if you're not ready to\ntalk about it that's actually fine i'm\nokay with that but i think\nat the least what we should talk about\nis your\nfear about not like you don't actually\nhave to talk about it\nthe important thing is not whether you\nshare some story or not the important\nthing is the fear that's controlling you\nyeah for sure it's not it i guess it is\nfear yeah i guess it is fear\nit's more of a thing where it's like\nam i the piece of [ __ ] if i talk about\nit\nyou know like it's it's like it could be\nthat's the problem right it's like\ni just think of these in this like\nskewed way because it's like if i talk\nabout things that bother me\nthen there's always going to be people\nthat are assuming\nthat i'm saying x for y reason\nyou know it's like i don't feel like i i\ndon't feel\nlike if i make myself vulnerable that it\nwon't be twisted in some way because\nmost of the times i have made myself\nvulnerable it has been twisted in some\nway and\nand i don't feel safe in that way\nyeah all right mitch i need your help\nokay yeah i need you to tell me if i'm\nbullying the [ __ ] out of you\nno man you're fine wait for it\nokay so here's the thing like bro that's\nexactly the problem\nlike here you are not being authentic\nabout the person that you\nlike what you feel on the inside because\nyou're like oh what if these people\nthink i'm saying this [ __ ] for pr\nlike that's exactly what you've spent\nthe last who knows how many months\ngetting away from\nis to connect to your authenticity and\nnot give a [ __ ] about how people are\ngonna judge you\nand you speak your truth yeah you're\nright it actually is fear holding me\nback from that you're right\nit's like it's all about this like how\nyou know\nand it's more it's not just like pr it's\nmore of like how would my\nlike it's like how would my father twist\nthat like let's say my father heard this\nconversation\nand i said what bothered me how would he\ntwist that to me that's more of what i'm\ntalking about you know yes\ni and why the [ __ ] that started with\nyour dad and now you're doing it with\nthe rest of the internet\nyeah you're right\nyeah you're you're not wrong i'm like\nliterally\ni'm literally like [ __ ] up from that\nand i just put that on everyone else\nit's like\ni'm like oh yeah well you're right yeah\nyou're right i just assumed the internet\nwould do the same thing then\nyeah you're right you're right you're\nright because the\nbecause but you you learn how to\nrecognize that pattern\nand be afraid of it but it sounds like\nthat started with your dad and like\nthe internet was just you know not\ntaking you seriously 2.0\nbut i don't even know because i actually\ndon't know i mean i could be talking\ncompletely out of my ass because i still\ndon't know what happened with your dad\nand that's sort of why i can give you\ni'll i can give you a little bit of\ndetails like i'm just going to slowly\nease into it rather than just yeah you\nknow i'm saying\nthat's what i mean about bullying you i\ndon't want you to like you know push you\ninto speaking no\nif i unleashed all that i would probably\njust yeah my mind would not be good like\nit's like i have to i have to deal with\nthis like one phase at a time type\nyeah but a big thing a couple couple\nthings that\nhappened was i feel like i told you\nabout the situation with my brother\nright where it's like i just feel as\nthough\num like i guess i can just tell one\nstory but please\njust like hear me out because this is\nvery personal [ __ ] you know what i'm\nsaying\num yeah well there was one i was like 23\nor so\nand my brother had always he grew up\nwith autism like asperger's\nand you know he was always different but\num\nhe was a good he was a good smart dude\nyou know he used to paint\nand he had some beautiful paintings man\nlike uh yeah he was very talented dude\nand uh as he grew up like my mother got\nreally ill and my mother was kind of the\nmain like caretaker for him then like\nheld his hand through life and [ __ ] you\nknow\nand um\ni just remember one time when i was 20\nmy my dad was like my brother was\nfalling apart you know he was\nhe was not going he was\ncalling my mother was not able to take\ncare of him anymore\nand uh were you gonna say something yeah\ni think i'm\nlagging from a server standpoint i'm\nwondering if this is the universe's way\nof\nlike double checking that we want to say\nwhat we're about to say\ni mean i can stop it's up to you man\ni think that this this feels important\nto me but at the same time\nlike absolutely like i don't want to\npressure you into this\nyou know yeah i don't really feel\npressured i just okay\nlike i already told you the things i'm\nfearful of is more so just\num yeah just i think sometimes when you\nare honest and have an open heart\npeople like to\nsort of stab that invulnerability or\nthat sorry that that vulnerability\nand yeah that's the only thing i'm\nfearful of is that\ni don't know i just uh yeah so we'll\nwe'll i'd like to help you\nfeel supported enough\nto be able to be courageous and to help\nyou be\nmore vulnerable despite the fact that\nyou've learned probably the hard i mean\nundoubtedly the hard way that that's a\nbad idea\nso if you're cool with it i'd love to\nhear the rest of that story you were\ntalking about your brother and how he\nmade good art\nyeah my brother hold on\nall right i\nyeah okay so the story i don't know\nwhere we left off but\nmy brother yeah he makes good art and\nuh he there was one time when i was 23\nand my\nmy my dad or sorry my brother was not\ndoing well\nhe was you know not taking care of\nhimself because my mother was not able\nto\ntake care of him the way she used to\nbecause of her own illness and\nuh there was like my dad told me i i had\ni rented\nthis is like when my stream first\nstarted doing well so i rented the house\nnext door to my\nmom's house because i wanted to be close\nto her and i was with my\nfriend ethan we lived at this place next\ndoor right\nand my dad called me and he's like hey i\nneed you to do me a favor\nand i was like okay what is it and he\njust said\nuh i've called social services and\nthey're picking up\nyour brother and you need to go there\nand moderate it and make sure everything\ngoes okay\nand i'm just like what why why the hell\nam i doing that\nyou know and he just put that all on me\nand i remember the [ __ ] cops came and\nthey were just like\nthey were like uh my\nmy they were like my brother is like not\naggressive but you know how\nany cops are man they're just they're\nthey're like\nyou know guns blazing type [ __ ] and it's\njust like dude like they were scaring\nthe [ __ ] out of my brother man\nand i had to sit there and calm down\nlike hey please he's not aggressive you\nknow he has autism you're going to scare\nhim like i had to deal with all of this\nand like\ni didn't have any support for my family\nand i just sat there while my mom\nwho is struggling with her own health\nproblems has no idea what's going on\nbecause she's had\nmultiple strokes and has had brain\nsurgery and brain cancer and she's just\nsitting there crying doesn't know what\nthe [ __ ] going on and i had to like\nmoderate all of this while my father\njust dipped you know and it's like\ni i don't know and it just ate me inside\nman i saw that and to this day\nmy brother is just rotting away\nsomewhere with like a\na bunch of like crazies man like there's\njust no way he's happy\nand and this should just way so heavy on\nmy [ __ ] soul man like\ni don't know what to do and i feel like\ni i have trouble talking about\nany of this [ __ ] and it's like i i may i\ndon't know man\nit's it's just hard for me to even\nthink about it like it sucks i feel like\nall the parts of my childhood that i\nloved are just gone\nand i don't know what to do\nokay so\nmitch we're gonna help you with this all\nright\nso i don't think we need to talk more\nabout your past but that was a really\npowerful share and i can sort of see\nso much can i start talking\nyeah the first thing is holy [ __ ] no\nwonder you feel alone\ni feel so alone man like i fee and not\nonly that like\ni've never shared this [ __ ] you know\nlike this [ __ ] is like [ __ ] that i've\nbeen trying my best to just deal with\non my own and i just portrayed myself\nas like this put together gamer or\nwhatever like that was my escape from\nall of this [ __ ] you know and\nuh once you just really dig inside\nyourself and realize you\ncan't escape you can't no matter how\nsuccessful you become no matter\nhow far away you run this [ __ ] will\ndestroy you man\nand it [ __ ] me up every [ __ ] day\nokay mitch\nare you in a space to listen i have\nyeah so you are a hundred percent right\nthat no matter how far you run you can't\nescape\nand that's because you carry it inside\nyou\nyou know if i have kryptonite if i have\nkryptonite in my backpack\nand i go for a jog i'm taking that [ __ ]\nwith me bro\nyeah and if i were to think about\nspeaking of\nartistry and imagery can you hear me\nokay\ni can okay i know you're hurting i'm\ngonna talk okay\nis that okay yeah obviously a lot has\nbecome clear for me and i i think that\nyou can't escape from it but you can\nabsolutely deal with it\nand and that's becoming clear to me so i\ni know it sounds weird like i know that\nyou're feeling like\nshattered and [ __ ] and i'm sorry if i\nyou know because i did that\nsort of i mean it was there but\nmitch i feel hopeful\ni need to help my brother somehow man\nwe'll get to your brother in a second\nokay let's focus on you for a second can\nyou do that for me bro\nyeah so if i were to if i were to\nif i were to make a picture okay maybe\nnot\nwhat are you feeling sorry [ __ ] i'm\ngood i'm good i'm good\ntell me wait what are you feeling i\ndon't i don't need to get all ugly right\nnow just it's fine man they just\ni'm having trouble i just need a deep\nbreath okay just give me yeah let's\nbreathe\nlike i said it's like i do i have\nthought about these things before\nand it's like but alone you know like i\ni don't talk about this [ __ ]\nand uh it's just uh i just yeah\ni had a plan though with all this [ __ ]\nyou know like i really did\ni don't know i had a plan man it's like\ni'm just trying to do an ounce of good\nbro you know like i i\nfor my for my [ __ ]\ni've just lost the [ __ ] child like\nthe person that i once was you know\nit's gone like it's just been\n[ __ ] shattered man like\noh i just i feel like the world is just\ndampening me and uh\ni have a lot to share yeah\nyeah so i know it sounds weird mitch but\ndo you have a sense of why\ni could be hopeful when you say things\nlike that\nno can you tell me why yeah it's weird\nright\nbecause the first thing is like because\nyou're not alone in this moment\nlike you're saying that you don't share\nthis stuff and you just did\nright because like the problem here is\nthat you've been carrying this [ __ ] all\nby yourself\nand like that's like you're carrying it\nwith you wherever you go and you're the\nonly one who's carrying it so like right\nnow in this moment what i\nwhat i saw you do is take off your\nbackpack for a second\nand pass it to me\nright and i can hold it for a few\nseconds before i pass it back which is\nfine man\nlike the only way this works is for you\nto like not be alone anymore\nright and and this is the this is the\nchallenge is like when i think about\ni'm gonna just keep talking okay\nwhatever you're feeling\nyou gotta tell me if i should stop\nfeeling like a dick for keeping talking\nbut i'm gonna keep going\nso here's what i'm here's what i'm\nseeing mitch\nif you were to ask me i'll look paint a\nportrait of loneliness\nwhat i would have done before this\nconversation\nyou listening yeah i'm gonna keep going\nokay you tell me when to stop do i need\nto stop\nwell are you good okay i'm gonna keep\ngoing okay\nyeah if you were to tell me to to paint\na portrait of loneliness i would have\npainted a person by themselves in an\nempty room and what i'm realizing now\nwhat that painting involves\nis is if i had taken a snapshot of you\nbeing on the phone being 23 years old\nwalking into into a room that has cops\nyour autistic brother\nand your mom with cancer and strokes\nthat is the portrait of loneliness\nin a nutshell\nand yeah yeah\nit feels overwhelming to share it\nbut i'm gonna ask you a question mitch\ndo you feel alone right now\nno no i don't i just feel very\nvulnerable\nyep because this is this is it right\nlike it's really hard to like bury your\nchest because you don't know if the\nknife is coming\nmitch bro this is a part of your journey\nand i know you feel vulnerable and we're\ngonna sit with you okay\nyep we're just gonna sit you don't need\nto do anything you don't need to say\nanything\ni can talk if you want to i can listen\nif you want to\nhow how can i how can i\nheal this like like even just opening\nthis small\nlittle window has made me just feel\nuncontrollably sad\nand i have that image in my mind\nyeah the image in my mind\nand um\ni just remember how much my my brother\nand my mother\nloved me you know i was just like\na year to a year or two ago\ni just went my brother had this\ni can't even [ __ ] talk now he had\nthis like chest\nfull of like everything he had collected\nand he had like a he had these game boy\nfiles it was a gameboy blue\ngameboy red and one of the files was\nhe like named the file after me and\ni opened up the file i just logged into\nthe game\nhe completed everything 100\nhe just he just misses me you know\nand i just feel like i was just running\naway\nbecause i can't face this [ __ ] man\ni can't face this [ __ ]\nokay mitch i'm gonna say something weird\nto you that you're probably gonna\npush back against i'll ask you a\nquestion\nis it okay to not be able to face it\nno it's not okay because\nthere's no one else that will you know\nthere's no one else that will\nso if i if i don't\ni'm gonna have to die with this paint\nyou are i know this is gonna sound\n[ __ ] weird mitch but i want you to\nlisten okay i want you to use whatever\nounce of energy you have to listen to my\nwords can you do that right now\nprobably not maybe not\nyeah if you give me like one second man\nyep i i can listen just give me one\nsecond yeah\nyeah you want to take a break for a bit\ngo wash your face something like that\ncompose yourself\ni'm sorry if i'm keeping you up i don't\nknow i don't know how this\nyou know i don't know man well looks\nlike we opened pandora's box so we're\ngonna put it in order okay\nwe're here bro there's no rush\ngod man it's like everything that i ran\nfrom\nlike you know i ran from this i met the\nstreaming people that i met\nand now i can't even talk to them man\nlike\nthis world it's just so weird and like\ni swear it's just like\ni don't know man i don't know\nall right yeah i'm gonna take a second\nokay yeah take a second\nall right so i guess if people are\nwatching\ni forgot for a second that this is being\nstreamed\nall right so let's take this opportunity\nall of us to take a second\nokay so feelings can be powerful they\ncan control\nus um\nand that's okay and that\nyou know learning how to tolerate\nfeelings sit with feelings\nletting them out is absolutely like an\nimportant part of this process\nif we want to heal\nall right i've collected myself a bit i\napologize\nwhat are you apologizing for\ni don't know i just need to keep myself\nput together you know i just apologize\nfor\ni don't know just everything i don't\nthink you did anything wrong\ni'm worried i did yep i understand that\nyou're worried and i understand that\nyour instinct is to apologize\nand i think what happened is\nlet's be honest i pushed you a little\nbit i felt like there was something\nimportant there\nand you\nyou have a pandora's box\nand i have i have a soul that bleeds\nso hard yep and everyone just views me\nas this person that i created and i hate\nthat person it's like i live like a\ndouble life and i i\nmy life is [ __ ] weird man\nyeah so mitch like this is why i have\nhope for you because\nin this moment you are no longer living\na double life\nthere is no longer the dude on the\ninside and the dude on the outside\nand you ask how can you heal from this\nwell you opened a window in this\nit smells like [ __ ] in there and so the\nthe smell that comes out is so\noverwhelming there's so much emotional\npain there's so much negativity\nbut the whole reason that it's in there\nis because you never open up the window\nyou've just made a huge step forward and\nwhen it comes to your brother you're\nright that if you are not there for him\nyou will die with this pain\nmitch how old are you i'm turning 29 in\ntwo days\nand how long are you gonna be alive\ni don't know so let's say that like\nif i carry this pain and this stress\ni've learned enough about health that\nthat [ __ ] will probably end up giving me\nsome sort of illness that i don't want\nso yep so let's say that average\naverage life expectancy in the u.s is 72\nor so so you've got about 43 years\nleft if you have chronic illness you\nknock off 10 off of that\nso you've got 33 years left\nso this is where i want i know it's\ngonna be hard because you feel guilty\nfor abandoning your brother\nokay but i think this is where like do\nyou need to be there for them\ni for him i'm gonna say yeah and if you\nsay because no one else will\ni will say yes mitch you are correct\nthat is your dharma that is your duty\nand\nyou don't need to do it right this\nsecond\nyeah right you i honestly had a hard\ntime i had a hard time\nevery time i would call him i've caught\ni called him\ni i visited actually uh like a\ncouple years ago uh on like christmas\nand wherever they have him they have him\non a lot of drugs\ni think that's just part of how the\nsystem works here\nwhere it's like we deem you unfit for\nsociety\nso we put you on drugs but that's the\nlast thing he needed they have\nthey have uh just dampened my brother\nto a point where he's just complacent\nand there's no\nhe's not like i he needs help\nokay so i i\nunderstand that i i may have a slightly\ndifferent perspective\nbut that's neither here nor there but i\nthink like in my mind your road is\npretty clear\nand you're walking it right so this\nstarted with you streaming at the age of\n20 becoming successful developing an\nego getting involved in drama\nstarting to die on the inside yeah\nrunning away from the true pain yeah yep\nand then you\nstarted waking up and you lost byron and\nthat was hard for you and it was hard\nfor me and it was hard for everyone\noh it was so hard for me man yep\ndude he was like the one i talked to him\nabout this [ __ ]\nand he knew what he knew all this [ __ ] i\ntalked to him we had so many heart to\nhearts about [ __ ]\nyeah and byron was someone that\nhad been in this streaming world so long\ntoo that we were both\nso [ __ ] over it man and\noh man i just wish i could talk to him\none more time\nwell i mean i know it sounds kind of\nweird but\nmitch you can talk to him\nright like you may not be able to hear\nhis words but you can still talk to him\ni do i literally [ __ ] send i [ __ ]\ni'm crazy bro like i literally dm his\ntwitter every now and then like he's\nthere\ni'm sick yo man\ni don't know there's very few people\nthat you meet in this world that\nwill listen to you and he listened to me\nyou know\nso mitch i know this is going to sound\nkind of weird i think that that has been\nyour experience so far\nbut what i'm seeing right now makes me\nhopeful that there are a lot of people\nin this world that if you give them the\nchance\nthey will listen and maybe this is a\nconsequence of streaming and [ __ ]\nbecause\nlike you said you know there's always an\nulterior motive so people who are like\nstreaming like this is a challenge that\nwe see is like\nyou're in the business of friendship\nright yeah\nexactly it's it's all like\nhalf of it is like a sham in my eyes\nhalf of it is just like i want to be\nfriends with x person because x person\ncan do this for me and like\nit's so empty dude it is\nempty as [ __ ] and like i don't\nunderstand\nwhy people want to be that why\ndo you want to be like if why do you\nwant to feel like me in the end nobody\nyou know what i mean like so\nmitch let that go as best as you can\nokay and recognize that when you make\nyour music\nyou are taking one step closer to\nconnecting when you share this today and\nyou\nopen the pandora's box and all the\nemotion comes rushing out\nand it feels overwhelming you are taking\none step closer to being like authentic\nand like letting that healing process\nbegin this is what healing looks like\nyou know surgery ain't pretty it's not\nlike wow where you see these beautiful\ngreen pluses\nand a bar fills up\nlike healing is more like blood magic\nlike\nin reality right it's like you pay the\nprice\nto fuel that healing\nyeah and like i paid the price like i i\ni've done some work to deal with this\nbut as soon as i go\na little deep even like alone like this\nthis comes out in me and like this is\nwhere i was at when i was making music\nyou know i was like\nthis would come out and i would just be\nsitting there like writing\nand like just putting it into like words\ni guess and like to me\nthat was sort of therapeutic but it\ndoesn't fix the problem you know\nyeah so i think you've done a lot on\nyour own but bro\nthis is where like you're right like i\ndon't know that\nit's the i mean i'm sure you can because\nyou're still\nyoung i mean you've got you've made a\nlot of good breakthroughs and you'll\nkeep making breakthroughs\nbut this is where i'd say bro don't walk\nthis journey alone this is not a journey\nyou need to walk along\ni understand why you feel alone i\nunderstand that there have been people\nin your life who\nshould have been very close to you and\nlike that has like you know your dad\nkind of dumped that [ __ ] on you\nand then you know there have been people\nwho have you haven't been able to\nconnect to\nbut this is where you need to party up\nthis is not a single player game anymore\nmaking music sure\ni feel like making music is more of a\nway\nit's more of a deeper way of doing my\njob if that makes sense\nyou know like uh i just feel like as a\nstreamer i couldn't i had to just\ni had to you know like nobody wants to\nwatch this [ __ ] you know what i mean\nlike people want to watch a happy person\nplaying a game\nbut like with music like people can\nrelate and there's a message and a story\nand it's like\nit's it's it's it's authentic you know\nand that's why i felt like\ni yeah yeah mitch your music has\nthe pain has purpose when it comes to\nyour music\nand so i can totally respect that but\nyou know that's like that's one part of\nyour journey that i think is awesome\nthat you've been watching but there's\nlike\nthis is the blind spot that i'm talking\nabout like\nthis [ __ ] needs to be dealt with\ndirectly\nright like you need to share these\nstories and\nlet them out of your soul when you say\nyour soul bleeds on the inside\nyeah that's because it's like stuck full\nof knives and like you're not pulling\nthem out\nbecause when you pull that knife out the\nblood starts spurting more\nyeah and then when the blood spurts more\ni'm in fear\nof how you know people will like i don't\nwant to be attacked\nwhen i'm opening myself up on the most\nvulnerable level because i have\ni i have been attacked before you know\non a wide scale\nand like i know like that pain as well\nyou know the pain of being widely hated\nby the internet\nmy that was my reality for like two\nyears and it like\nit was like it was it was mainly hurting\nmy ego which i learned to get away from\nthat and not really\ngive a [ __ ] about that side of things as\nmuch as more which i'm glad i made that\ndevelopment as well but like i'm in fear\nthat if i pull the knives out on a scale\nwhere it's not just me alone in a room\nby myself that i'll just bleed out\nuntil i'm dead you know yes like so so\nbro listen like very simply right\nyou've got 32 years left\nand so what i want you to do very dying\nat 60.\nyeah if you this this [ __ ] keeps going\nright and i'd give yourself like two or\nthree years\nlike honestly i'd give yourself two or\nthree years to put yourself in a good\nhead space\nbefore you help your brother but should\nyou help him yes\nabsolutely are you the only one who can\nprobably\nyeah and so like i i get that he's kind\nof medicated out and stuff like that but\nthat too i mean they're\nyou know i know it sounds kind of weird\nyou just gotta trust me on this one as a\npsychiatrist sometimes\nthere are people i see their fam i see\nfamily members\nwho come and see like their chronically\nmentally ill\nfamily and they're devastated by what\nthey see but honestly like\nthere are some places that are pretty\ngood where people are actually happy\nthere i know it sounds crazy\nyeah i know it sounds absolutely crazy\nbut like\nthere is happiness to be found in a\nmental hospital and way too many people\nfall in love that's a whole different\nproblem but\nanyway i just when i visited there it\ndidn't seem like an environment where he\ncould thrive to the fullest that's all\nso so i i can't comment on that facility\nbut\nyou know i i know it sounds shocking and\nit can be emotionally painful to accept\nbut like\nhaving worked in some of those\nfacilities i i know if that i had family\nmembers who were like that\nlike i would actually be willing to send\nthem there because i know that\nlife on the outside can actually be\nharder\nright some anyway this is this i'm\ngetting off into yeah you kind of come\ncoming back to you my point to you is\nthat you know i would\nto a certain degree trust what your mind\nis telling you but also recognize that\nlike\nyou know if you that for now this may\nnot be quite as bad for your brother is\nemotionally\nyou think it is because your feelings of\nabandonment are gonna amplify\nthe situation that you see him in does\nthat make sense\nyeah so i'm not saying you shouldn't get\nhim out of there i'm not saying you\nshouldn't do more for him by all means\ndo both of those things\nbut cut yourself a little bit of slack\nright because you were thrust into this\nsituation at the age of 23\nand the responsibility for your brother\nwhile it's unfortunate that all of it\nfalls onto you\nyou can't be expected to bear it right\naway\nyeah so be patient with yourself\nnot only that my my mother as well my\nit's not just my brother it's my mother\nas well so\ni will say this to you in the strongest\npossible way so when you say it's hard\nto be vulnerable because you've been\npunished\nso what you need more than anything else\nmitch is a regular person i would highly\nrecommend therapy\nwhere you can go in on a weekly basis\nand share this [ __ ] open one tiny window\nat a time\nyeah i've never actually given therapy\nuh 100\nof a try i have spoken to people but\nit was just it just didn't get anywhere\nyeah so i think that you probably\nthe spiritual fortitude that you've\ndeveloped over the last year\nwill hopefully help you\nhandle therapy like a little bit better\nand get more out of it maybe you just\nweren't ready yet\nbut i think now that you've done all of\nthis personal work\nit's time to start cleaning out the\ncellar\nand you're right that if you pull\neverything out of your soul all at once\nalone there's gonna be too much bleeding\nout that happens\nthat's exactly what happened to me when\ni went into this i went into this alone\nand was trying to just deal with the\npain through\njust like body like manipulation i guess\nyou know\nand um it worked like i was bleeding but\nholy [ __ ] i was bleeding so hard that i\ndidn't even want to continue\nyou know and it's like that was\nvery like some of the moments that i hit\nin in those times when i truly opened up\neven alone\nwere almost were too much you know and i\ncan't even imagine\nif i was that person with you know\ntelling to somebody else you know it\njust feels like you're even\nit's it's weird you know i don't know i\nhad a couple eye-opening moments though\nwhen i was\ntrying to deal with this on my own so\nmitch you are i think\nan amazing example an amazing example\nof the benefits and shortcomings\nof spirituality when it comes to dealing\nwith something incredibly traumatic\nbecause there's no doubt in my mind that\nyou've come a very long way on your own\nit's amazing\nlike even that one story is like\nabsolutely heartbreaking and\nsoul-shattering there's\nman there's so many more yep so we're\nnot going to go there\nokay so now i'm going to set a limit if\ni can\nbecause i think we don't we want to like\nwe want to do this sort of like\nyou know like yeah once yeah yeah right\nso i think that's healthy\nanything more than that i think would\nfeel a little bit too much\nyeah right so i appreciate you for real\ni feel i feel\nlike after i've calmed down i feel a\nlittle like a little\nlike i don't feel as heavy i guess i\nfeel a little bit like better\ni still feel like i have a lot to do and\nthere's you know\nbut i do feel a bit better thank you\nyeah you're welcome\nbro you're right you have a [ __ ] ton to\ndo but this is how we\nhave to teach you you have to learn how\nto do it in a safe way right\nlike you don't go jumping into the\npacific ocean it's like let's step into\nthe kiddie pool\nlet's try swimming four feet let's\nyeah you know kiddie pool sounds good\nyeah\nand and i think bro like it's amazing\nlike you've done awesome stuff with diet\nand it sounds like you're you know\nmaking\nmusic and it's like very authentic and i\nthink it's really unfortunate but\nyou know the most beautiful art is\ncreated by the most painful life and\nthat's why as a society we love\nart right because it speaks to us on a\nlevel that like\nyou know an artist that painted a\npainting 700 years ago\ncan talk to you today you can feel\nconnected with them\nso like i don't know this is gonna this\nis gonna sound kind of random i'm gonna\nsay this to kind of light in the mood\nyou know that song in the air tonight by\nphil collins\ni do the one that was it was in tarzan i\nthink no\ni don't know what movies is that but\nit's one of these songs where like i\ndon't know what the [ __ ] he's talking\nabout\nbecause the lyrics are so damn vague he\njust says i can feel it coming in the\nair tonight\nthat's all he says yeah and i have no\nidea\nidea what he's talking about but i\nunderstand him a hundred percent\num yeah that's why music is special i\nfeel like even if you haven't gone to\nthe depths of pain that the person is\nspeaking of\nthere's a human consciousness that can\nsort of connect with it\nabsolutely so like you walk that\nspiritual journey\nyou create your music have it be part of\nyour growth\nhave it be part of your therapy yeah and\nalso\nwork with someone else don't bear this\n[ __ ] alone\nright but you see why the music helps me\nthough it's like\nif i can't share this in a way through\nwords it's like\ni'm i'm looking for deep connections\nright so if\nif i can deeply connect with somebody\nout there through music then i've done\nthat's what i'm looking for love\nwhatever you want to call it you know\nsome sort of\nthing that isn't just on the surface\nlike i really strive to\nfor that can you tell me a little bit\nabout\nyour music yeah what what about it\njust tell me about it well and what in\nspecific\nwhat do you mean so i understand what\nyou're striving to do what have you met\nlike what are you conveying through your\nmusic\nmy story you know the my\nuh my my little album that's coming out\non my birthday and\nthree two days is like it's it just\ntells a story you know\nand uh so yeah i'm trying to just convey\nmy\nstory in in little windows like you said\num and be able to relate\non a level where i feel like i can\nconnect with people\nbecause i felt like as a streamer i was\nhaving difficulty connecting with people\nawesome man yeah\nmitch you've really come a long way dude\nthank you bro\ni appreciate you saying that for real it\nmeans a lot to me thank you\ni'm going to do my best not to get\nemotional but i'm going to toss this\nlast one out i feel really\nif it's it's heartbreaking to me that\nyou've had to come so far\non your own and if i if i had if i could\nchange\none if i had a magic wand that could\nchange one thing in your life\ni wouldn't try to take away your journey\num because i think it's important and\nhealthy to walk the journeys that where\nwe walk even if they're painful the only\nthing that i wish is that you didn't\nhave to walk it alone\nyeah i appreciate you for saying that\neven after just talking to you i don't\nfeel as alone as i did\nyou know i feel like you were able to\nlisten to me\nand um thank you for that i\nthis was very scary for me and i still\nam worried\nyou know but it's all good i feel like\nuh\nthat's part of you know me just\naccepting things for what they are\nyeah man i i think it makes sense to me\nthat this\nfelt good and it's scary because i think\nlearning how to trust\nis going to be a slow process the\nsaddest thing is very hard for me\nvery very very very hard for me\nthe saddest thing about trust is that it\ncan take a lifetime to build and a\nmoment to shatter\nyeah for sure and that that's another\nthing with the you know the the music is\nlike\nuh i'll on friday at like\noh it's scheduled for like 3 p.m i'm\ndoing like a live\nor like a performance or whatever and\ni'm like i'm really anxious that that\nyou know but i feel like that's going to\nhelp me just like be in that\nmoment like those like flow state\nmoments where you can really just be\nyourself like those are the kind of the\nmoments i like live for\nyou know and uh i'm\njust looking forward to trying something\ndifferent whether people\n[ __ ] on me or not i'm just going to keep\npushing my head\nface strong into the [ __ ] brick wall\nuntil it collapses you know like i'm\njust\ni'm just going to keep going man yeah\nman\nyeah mad respect i i think\nhere's what i'd say to you mitch like\nyou kind of said whether people like it\nor don't like it\nit's not about what people like or don't\nlike it's about what you have to offer\nyeah so if you're doing a live stream\nsome you know what i'd say to you is\nlike you may be worried\noh what if i screw up or whatever like\nit's not about screwing up or doing a\ngood job\nit's about giving us whatever you have\nto offer yeah i'm just very nervous i\nyou know\ni haven't streamed i haven't streamed in\nsix months and i'm doing\nsomething completely different and it's\njust\nit just you know it's just a little\nnerve-wracking it's all\nyeah i can imagine man i do not i do not\nenvy you\nyeah for sure i don't think anyone dies\noh man sounds rough bro not gonna lie\nbut man i can i can feel the weight of\nyour scrotum growing from here\nyeah let's hope uh yeah let's hope it\ngoes\nit'll go well i gotta think positively\nyou know yeah i it's like\nmy message is real my my feelings my\nheart my soul is in this [ __ ] you know\nso and that's another terrifying thing\nyou know when you when you when you\nshare a piece of your soul\ncriticism hurts even more than if you're\njust creating a persona right\nlike when people would attack mitch\njones i didn't really give a [ __ ]\nyou know to me mitch jones was just a\n[ __ ] 19 year old version of myself\nthat i just brought out every day\nbut when you when you when you really\ndig deep and share the deepest parts of\nyour soul and then people are like\n[ __ ] on that that is painful but\nit's something that i've i'm used to\nand i'm i'm equipped for you know so\nyeah\nawesome man so do you want to give us a\ncouple details about so are you going to\nbe streaming
