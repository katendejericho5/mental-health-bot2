    "transcript": "many people don't talk about emotions\nthey don't talk about their feelings and\nlike Society doesn't like you to do that\na lot of the times frankly and I think\nthat sucks yeah I I think it's it's\nabsolutely something that is discouraged\nso one of the best examples that I can\nthink of is that everyone says that\ncommunication is important for a\nrelationship you know they'll ask you\nlike oh like you've been married for 40\nyears what's the secret they'll say like\ncommunication communication\ncommunication does that means yeah super\ncommon it's it's just a super common\nthing and it's true it's like\ncommunication matters but it's like what\nwhat does that communication entail\nmeans telling your partner you're upset\nit means telling him that you are upset\nthat you don't like the thing that's\ngoing on telling him why you don't like\nthat thing it means and to be honest\nwith you sometimes it means Fighting Man\nsometimes it means having a verbal\nargument not a physical argument\nobviously but a verbal argument about\nsomething is sometimes that's what\nwhat's needed if there's an emotional\nthing on the table and it's it's deeply\ndistressing having a verbal argument\nabout it is normal there's nothing wrong\nwith that"
