    "transcript": "dr k what do you struggle with you were\nao he\naoe healing tons of people but you were\nso busy helping others that you never\ntook the time to explain what you\nstruggle with in a video\nwhat do you struggle with oh chat\nokay let's try to understand something\nokay i don't the truth is i don't\nstruggle much\num and the reason i don't struggle much\nis because i figured out how i work\nso prior to so this person is saying\nlike i spend so much time thinking about\nother people like\nwhy don't i share what because i've\nfigured out what works for me\nright so i struggled a lot before and\ni'll give you guys just an example so\nlike while\nuh before i understood that i was a vata\nand i started crafting my life around\nbeing a vata\nbefore that i used to struggle a ton\nokay\nso like just to remind people you know\nvatas are people that whose minds are\nlike the wind\nso i get distracted easily i get bored\neasily\ni get excited easily and what i found is\nthat like\nthat was really challenging because the\nworld does not\nsupport people who are creative\ndistractible excitable\nand like shift right the world our our\ncurrent society\nis structured to support people who are\nlike\nfocused driven ambitious\nand like consistent that's what\nmatters to people right like if you look\nat school school is about\neight hours a day followed by studying a\ndegree is gained over four years\nand so when i went to college like i got\nsuper excited about stuff\nso my first year of college i ran for\nstudent government i joined a bunch\nof clubs i joined a frat i took\nspanish japanese spanish and japanese's\nlanguage\ni took a philosophy class i took a\nchemistry class\nfailed most of those classes and so like\ni was so excitable and distractible that\ni kind of wanted to do everything\nit was cool and it sucked i failed at\nall of it\nand so then what started to happen is\nlike as i started to fail at things i\ngot like more stressed\nout and i was really easy it was really\neasy for me to drop stuff too\nso on the one hand i'm excited by\njapanese class and on the other hand\nlike\ni'm doing bad in spanish class so let me\njust quit spanish and do japanese\nso i was like it was really easy for me\nto be a quitter\nand college was this kind of environment\nwhere like\nyou know it doesn't reward people for\nbeing quitters duh\nokay and so for a long time i struggled\nand like i struggled bad and was like i\nimagine super depressed in retrospect\nlike you know felt like i was failing\nlife and stuff like that and then i went\nto india like so this went on for two\nyears failed a bunch of classes had you\nknow had like a 1.5 gpa or something\nmanaged to pass something here\nthere so it wasn't like a zero but like\ngot a couple of c's a d here there maybe\na b\ni don't think i got a single a in my\nfirst two years so so then actually so\nthere's one piece of the story that's\nmissing so then as i struggled\ni you know i went to my dad and i asked\nmy dad i was like hey like\nyou know i need help actually i didn't\nask him he was like you're doing too\nmany things you need to stop doing\nstuff so he's like stop doing student\ngovernment stop doing your clubs\nso i did all that i was like okay i'm\ndoing too many extracurriculars i just\nneed to focus\nhe was like just focus on your studies i\nwas like okay dad\nso i cut everything else out same result\nand i was like oh my god i'm so dumb and\nthen he was like\nokay just focus on your studies so i was\nlike you know what if i can't handle\nfive classes i'm gonna take three so i\ncut down to half a normal course load\nsame result and then i went to india and\ni was like this doesn't make any sense i\nwas trying to do too much\nso if you're trying to do too much the\nsolution is do less right\nso i went to india and one of my\nteachers was like that's a terrible idea\noh my god you're destined for failure if\nyou just\ndo one thing you're gonna get bored and\ni was like wait what\nand so what my friend friend or teacher\nwhat they told me was that like\nyou know you're avata and so what that\nmeans for your temperament\nis that like you're gonna get bored\neasily so like you need\nto have three or four different things\nthat you do where\nyou can switch from one to the next like\nwhen you get bored the next thing is\nready for you\nbut the cool thing is by the time you\nget to thing number three\nand you get bored of that you can get\nexcited about thing number one again\nand thing number one will be fun and i\nwas like oh fascinating\nso what i did is like structure a life\nwhere you know like i understand my\ntemperament\nand once i understand my temperament i\ncan structure the life\nto be aligned with my temperament\nand so now i sort of don't struggle much\ndo i make mistakes yes\nis my life hard in some ways yes do i\ndeal with what on paper\nseems stressful like absolutely but i\nthink the key thing about like not\nstruggling is like understanding like\nwhat's your temperament\nso as a vata like the key weaknesses of\nvata that will cause you to struggle\nis that first of all you exist in a bit\nthe society\nso what that means is that like people\nare going to be more ambitious than you\nthat people are going to be more\ndedicated than you but what you bring to\nthe table\nis like creativity excitement\nspontaneity and like\nbeing dynamic so the cool thing is that\nlike when a crisis happens\nvatas are awesome because they learn\nfast so they can deal with things they\ncan manage a bunch of different stuff\ncome like\ncoming at you whereas fitness are like i\nneed a system to deal with this or this\ndoes not work in the system and we can\nkind of see this right like\nlike they're going to be like oh this\nmay be a random example but\nyou know so when like the metoo movement\nwas happening\nin in universities they were like really\nslow to respond\nright because they had their system\nand like the me too movement like didn't\njive with their system\nand so they couldn't deal with it so if\nyou look at institutions like when\nallegations of sexual\nproblems started coming out the the\nbitter oriented institutions were like\nwe can't deal with this so we're gonna\npretend it's not there\nmeanwhile you look at twitter where\ntwitter is supervata\nso twitter like could handle the metoo\nmovement like that\nright like twitter is adaptable it's\ndynamic it has a short attention span\nand so when something like the metoo\nmovement arises twitter can respond to\nit very quickly\nso it's not that being ambitious and\ndisciplined is better\nit's that most of our structures are\ndesigned\nto be that way and furthermore that\nthat makes certain weaknesses in those\nstructures\nand if you look at the companies and\ninstitutions that responded to the metoo\nmovement\nbetter they're the ones who had dynamic\nleaders\nwho were a little bit more vata and\nthey're like okay we have to throw our\ncurrent playbook out the window\nand let's figure out how to deal with\nthis crisis now and i've seen this in\nstartup consulting too where like\nif you've got like you know people who\nare too bit though will like not be able\nto deal with a dynamic environment and\nthey'll start to fall apart\nand then for people who are kapha you\nknow kaphas tend to be like slow and\nmethodical\nso even so if you're a kapha like in the\npita environment what you'll sort of\nfind is that other people are like\nlobbying for promotions\nand they're gunning right like they're\nambitious and you're like oh crap like\nmaybe i should be more ambitious\nit's not like you're all over the place\nand you're scattered you're just kind of\nlike\nyou know you're kind of chilling like\nyou like your job you're dedicated at\nyour job you care about your job but\nother people are like fiery\nthey're like i want to get promoted i\nwant to do this i want to do this i want\nto do this\nand kaphas are sort of like i'm actually\nokay doing this and should you advocate\nfor a promotion like absolutely right\nyou have to learn how to be a little bit\nmore bitter\nbut what's the other advantage is like\nif you're a kapha like in a bit\nif you have a company full of fitness\neveryone's going to fight\nright everyone's going to be lobbying at\nthe promotion and be like resentful\ntowards each other and then crap like\nthat whereas like office will be like\na stabilizing influence so\ni think the key thing the reason i don't\nstruggle is because like i've sort of\nfigured out like how i work and that's\nwhy i try to explain like you know\nmy whole ethos is like bros or women\nwhatever everything in between homies\nlet me explain something to you if you\nall understand how motivation works\nit will transform your life no one\nexplains this stuff like\nthe reason i don't struggle is because\nlike i understand right i'm not saying\ni'm special\nit's not like i'm brilliant in fact\ni'd say the opposite the whole point is\nlike what i found in india was that\nactually this stuff is pretty simple\nit's just we don't teach it\nright like we don't teach this stuff so\nif you guys want to struggle\nyou know what i'd say is continue trying\nto be\nwhat you're not and if you want to not\nstruggle\nunderstand who you are understand your\nstrengths\nunderstand your weaknesses understand\nthe environment that you're\nin and try to tailor your life to adapt\nto where you are\nright so this is where like as a\nresident for example\nlike i would write when i was on call so\nother people will be on call and i was\nlike this is cool i'm here for 24 hours\nlike i can see a patient\ni can write and so like i wrote you know\n80\n000 words over the course of like\nsix weeks and wrote a non-fiction book\nabout video game addiction it was like\njust did that in six weeks so that's\nsomething that a fot that can do\nnow you asked me to write something like\nyou know\ngame of thrones and like i don't have\nlike it takes a kapha to write game of\nthrones and like\ngrrm seems pretty guffin to me it's like\nthis long\nmarathon of like you know i can't write\nthat\ni can spit out a book in six weeks but\nit's gonna be random it's gonna be all\nover the place and it's like you don't\nknow what you're going to get\nso my twitch is perfect for me it's like\ny'all are\nchatting at me and like asking me all\nthese random questions in my vat that\nmine's like sweet let's do it\nit is so much harder for me to teach at\nharvard medical school than it is for me\nto teach on twitch\nand so the reason i don't struggle is\nbecause i teach here\nthis is what i'm good at whereas\nwait you wrote season eight oh i wish\nactually i\nif i if i'd written season eight i think\nit would have been better right so\nlike early chat is right it's it's\nrandom dude like i'm good at randomness\nlike you can give me rng\nuh would you say most people in harvard\nor pithas i don't know\nso i do think that if you look at like\ncertain\nexecutive leadership positions i'm\npretty sure there's\na bias towards pitta we should just\ncrowdsource season 8 dude like\ni've seen so many like fan like it would\nbe better if\nlike the best the best season 8 fan\ntheory that i thought was like\nthere was this thing about okay i i\nshouldn't say because spoilers\nbut okay so spoilers\nall right if people haven't seen it so\ni'm gonna talk about this for a second\ni'm gonna count to five\nand then spoiler free okay one two three\nfour five so like the night king instead\nof arya showing up out of nowhere and\njust killing the night king i saw this\ngreat thing about how like\nyou know like the night king defeats\neveryone and then like jaime lannister\nshows up and he's like\nyou know what they call me and then the\nnight king is like what he's like king\nslayer\nand then jaime gets his [ __ ]\nredemption arc he kills the knight it's\nlike\nyou can that's so easy man\nlike just have jamie kill the night king\nit's like such a small thing it fits so\nmuch\nthe guy's he's called kingslayer\nyou're working on a redemption arc and\nhe [ __ ]\ngets crushed by mortar like what the\n[ __ ]\nlike what it's like low hanging fruit\nlow hanging fruit chat we can literally\ncrowd source a better\nif we sat down and like we were like\ntwitch writes game of thrones season\neight\nwe could literally make something better\nwhatever\nso i see lots of people saying jamie\nsucks jamie should have killed cersei\ninstead of the night he like what like\nany of that would have been better than\nyou know there's so much character\ndevelopment about like\njamie not being a lannister and like\ngrowing you know something like he's\nchanging right and he just like\nrun seriously at the end and they just\nboth die like the [ __ ] yeah what would\nbe cool though is\nyou know i don't know why people aren't\nwriting books but like like patrick\nrothfus streams right\nhe's he streams i think we got to get\nlike all these folks like patrick\nrothfuss\ngeorge rr martin and scott lynch and we\ngot to do some like\nsolid coaching with them to help them\novercome\nwhatever it is that's keeping them from\nwriting right like let's let's\nlet's start a group for writers\nwho have books that we want to read and\nuse our power for good\ninstead of helping y'all [ __ ] put\nyour lives together like who the [ __ ]\ncares about that\nlet's let's get wins a winner let's get\nthat stuff out there like whatever it\ntakes\nwe'll teach them how to meditate we'll\nteach them how to focus we'll teach them\nhow to overcome their\ninternal you know like fears like\nbecause there's a lot of stuff i've\nactually worked with successful artists\nand there's like\nthere's stuff there right like because\nsuccess can be like one of the most\nparalyzing things because when you're\nwriting your first book\nright i can only imagine like when\nyou're writing your first book it's like\nyou just have to write it for you it's\nthe story that you want to tell\nand we see this a lot actually in the in\nour content creator program\nis that the bigger you become the more\ncreatively constrained you become\nit's kind of weird because then what\nhappens is like\nthere's something that the people want\nfrom you and the formula that you\nuse to create the first thing was not\ngiving people what you want\nit's giving people what was in your\nheart and the more successful you become\nthe more your mind gets caught up in\ngiving people what they want because\nthey liked so much\nabout what was in your heart and then it\ngets really really\nchallenging because it gets hard to\naccess this in here because you don't\nknow if people are going to be satisfied\nwith it\nand the more that you start caring about\nthe people the worse your art becomes\nand so it's weird but it happens and\nit's challenging yeah so i mean people\nare saying like money leads the world\nand stuff\nyou know it's like it's it's tough but i\nthink like as fans\nyou so we have a certain responsibility\nto this right because like\nwhat do you want from people do you\nwanna do you want them to give you what\nthey gave you before\nor do you want do you want them to give\nyou\nwhat they have to give and as fans the\nmore we are able to\naccept what authors give us even if we\ndon't like it\nlike and we can say like hey i'm glad\nyou tried that we're glad you gave us\nthis anyway even though it's not my cup\nof tea\nlike thank you it's not my favorite but\ni'm glad you did it and i'm glad you\ninnovated and i'm glad you tried i have\na weird issue dr k lately when i turn\nuh tune into your stream when we touch\non something that might be relatable to\nme i started i\ni start getting kind of anxious how do i\nfix that you don't fix it\nyou feel anxious and then you ask\nyourself where why am i feeling anxious\nwhere is this coming from\nright like you understand it like this\nis the thing you guys want to not\nstruggle\nunderstand right think about like all of\nthe games that you play where you don't\nunderstand the mechanics and like what\nhappens you struggle\nand once you understand the mechanics\nit's like oh this is how this works\nso i play some dota and i'll tell you\nthat\nthe place that i struggle the most is\ndota\nand the reason i struggle in dota is\nbecause oftentimes i don't understand it\nright like why is this carrie doing this\nthing oh my god i can't believe he's\ndoing it oh my god\nthis carry is so bad this is so bad\neveryone's so bad\nand i don't understand i don't\nunderstand the\nthe greatest revelation chat the\ngreatest revelation i'm the one who's\nbad chad\ni'm the one who's bad and once you begin\nto understand that once you begin to\nunderstand oh i should have been doing\nthis oh the reason that like we lost\nthis game is because\ntheir supports were stacking camps and i\nwasn't\nthe more you understand the less you\nstruggle and then you start winning\ngames\nit all comes down to video games chat\nall lessons of life can be learned\nso what should you do when you come in\nhere and you feel anxious let yourself\nfeel anxious what's up with that\ndon't try to make it go away try to\nunderstand where it's coming from\nthat's the biggest problem of our\nsociety today we're so hell-bent about\ntrying to make things go away instead of\nunderstanding where they come from\nif you talk about like you know like i\ni'll see this a lot\nwe choose to just we just love to hate\nwhatever the whatever the hate of the\nweek is\nwe hate something every week as a\nsociety\nyou know and it's like i saw this a lot\nlike i i still remember like talking to\nso when when trump won the u.s election\nin 2016 like people\nyou know in in my residency program were\nvery upset which is understandable a lot\nof people were really upset\nand like everyone was talking about like\neveryone loves talking about how trump\nsupporters are idiots\nbut like my point is like do you guys\nget that\nlike a bunch of people voted for this\nguy and like what are they thinking you\ncan't just call them stupid\nbecause there's something there that is\ncausing these people\nto vote for this person if you guys\nreally\nwant like things to change we need to\nunderstand those people instead of\ncalling them stupid\nand we see the same thing it's like oh\nmy son is addicted to video games he's\nsuch a waste of space\nit's like try to understand him that's\nwhat we tell our parents that come to\nour program like we'll get this often\nwhere parents will be like\nmy kid needs to be in your coaching\nprogram i'm like does your kid want to\nbe in my coaching program no\nhe doesn't why do you think your kid\nneeds to be in our coaching program\nbecause he's wasting his life okay so\nlike we're happy to take him if he wants\nto be there but if he doesn't want to be\nthere\nwe won't take him what we'd love to do\nis take you\nhe's like i don't need coaching he's the\none with the problem\ni'm like okay in my experience the\nparents who think that way\nare the ones that benefit the most from\nour coaching program and like\nhalf of them will be like no i don't\nneed nothing\nit's my kid that's the problem\nand the ones that show up\nare transformed in 12 weeks they're like\nwow\ni never realized yes that is why you\nwere struggling\nand once you realize the struggles will\nstop"
