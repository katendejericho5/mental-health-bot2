    "transcript": "let me share something with you if you\ndon't understand something in a\nrelationship\nmaybe try asking the other person\ni have never tried that once ever and\ntherein lies i think a major\npiece of social conditioning that you\nprobably never saw at home\nthere we go yeah of course man happy we\ncould help what's what's been going on\noh a lot um\ni can honestly probably say the the past\nthree days have\nmost likely been the worst days of my\ncontent creating\ncareer i guess ever and uh it combined\nwith things from my personal life as\nwell stacking up at like inopportune\ntimes it's been uh\nit's been pretty damn rough and um\nthat's what seems to happen yeah and\nthen\nyeah and then the worst thing that\nhappened is like this is the one time\nwhere like i finally thought that like\nokay i'm good like okay we're all good\nthis isn't gonna happen this time and\nthen\nit happened it happened again even\nthough like i i tried\nso hard to like like i thought i was\ngood i thought i was i was chill and\nthen all of a sudden\nuh an unexpected conduit that caused\nnegative\nemotions in mass happened again which\ncaused\nsituations that i wasn't for seeing\nwhich is very unfortunate\nuh yeah i'm losing you a little bit in\nthe abstractness so let's take a step\nback\nyeah sure yeah of course um so so okay\ncan that can you\nstart by just telling me what you go by\nor what you want me to call you today\nyeah i would love for you just to call\nme john okay so\nuh john so just so you know i i\nunderstand\nthat our team was quite responsive to\nyou which is fantastic i'm really happy\nto hear that they\nyou know um but i don't know anything\nso like i have no idea and that's that's\nactually how i\nprefer to have it so i try not to be\nlike biased by like things that get\nposted and anything like that\nso i come into these completely blind\nsometimes it's confusing for people\num especially the audience if they know\nlike if there's some kind of drama going\non but like i try to be blind to the\ndrama and like i don't pay attention to\nit i stay off of\nsocial media and stuff like that you\nknow i read reddit um just for fun\nbut yeah and i i really appreciate that\nbecause i i need a non-biased\nindividual like yourself alok like so\nbadly because sure\nit's it's hard to know like\nsorry it's it's really hard to know\nwhether i'm the problem or not because\nit keeps happening\nand it's happened so many times\nthat i don't know when it's going to\nstop\nbecause it just keeps happening over and\nover again and pretty much pretty much\nwhat's happening\nis that um i just keep pissing people\noff and like i keep on hurting people\nwho i really care about and\ni've pretty much lost every single\nperson that i've ever been close with uh\nfor longer than like two years besides\nmy best friend edric and my wife frame\nokay i only really connect with one\nmember of my family anymore\ni'm not gonna lie i've had a pretty\npretty bad experience with that\nuh but it's just it's so hard to know\nlike\ni mean you got to understand from and\ni'm sure you do understand from my\nperspective\nis that i'm always the common\ndenominator\nand so eventually i'm gonna assume well\nit's probably me it's it was probably me\nso it's just trying to determine that\nokay which drugs\nuh john can i just think for a second\nof course yep of course so i'm trying to\nfigure out how to phrase this so\nyou know when you use phrases like i'm\nthe whether i'm the problem or i'm the\ncommon denominator there can\nit's a really tricky place to be because\nthere can be a lot of blame with that\nright and the tricky thing here is that\nif if you are responsible\nthen you actually have the power to\nchange it because it's like\nin your wheelhouse does that make sense\nright a hundred percent yes\nthe the challenge is that if you're not\nresponsible then you may not have the\npower to change it so it's sort of like\na double-edged sword either way\nso either you aren't quote-unquote the\nproblem\nin which case you're just kind of like\nunlucky and you may not be able to do\nanything about it\nbecause at the end of the day the only\nthing you can control is yourself\nright right and if you are quote-unquote\nthe problem\nthe challenge is that in my experience\nthat comes with a lot of blame\nbut it also comes with a lot of power\nso what i i mean already i have no idea\nwhat we're talking about but my first\nthought here is like\nwhat i want you to understand is that if\nwe're talking about interpersonal\nrelationships here\na lot of our our problems and\ninterpersonal relationships\ndo have we do have an element like we're\nat least 50\nright or at most 50 depending on how you\nwant to look at it and what i've seen in\npeople who\nsus like continually have the same\nproblem in relationships\nis that they do have some kind of\ncontribution but i know it sounds kind\nof weird but that contribution may not\nbe\nyour fault even though it's your\ncontribution which i know sounds like\nthis this needs to be disentangled\nbut like so i'll just give you an\nexample you know if your parents\ngrew up in a particular way and there\nwas a certain like\nhusband-wife dynamic that you\ninternalized and\ngot socially conditioned to be\nacceptable\nand then like you take that programming\ninto all of your relationships and then\nyou wind up getting like\ndivorced twice in a sense you're\nresponsible for it but in a sense like\nyou didn't really know\nbetter right yeah so i think it's like\nit's important to be careful about like\nresponsibility and blame\nand and already my sense i don't i don't\nreally know anything so this could be\nlike completely off base here\nbut my thought is how you know the goal\nalready i have a goal in my mind which\nis to try to understand your\ninterpersonal dynamics\nraise awareness as to what you do that\ncould impact those\nand i know it sounds kind of weird but\nwe have to like really be careful about\nnon-judgment there\nand then we have to understand like what\ndrives you to\nengage in relationships the way that you\ndo\nyes okay so it's not like does that sort\nof make sense so it's gonna be like a\ntricky tight rope to walk\nuh to to sort of become aware of what\nthe problem is and like work on changing\nit\nwithout like self-flagellating yourself\nand like thinking that you're a pos and\nlike things like that for like doing\nthat so far\nlike what's happened in the past has\nhappened in the past and you know we can\nyou can apologize for it you can try to\nmake up for it all those things are\nhealthy but at the same time\nlike self-blame doesn't really help very\nmuch\num and so what i'm gonna what we may do\nis like hold you\naccountable and hold you responsible for\nyour actions\nbut we also want to do that like with\ncompassion\nyes okay okay so tell me what are we\ntalking about john\nuh we'll see i have this mentality where\ni don't know if this is good or not\nbut like i i have been is it okay if i\ncuss\nyeah i think so okay i've been [ __ ]\nso many goddamn times um by the people\nwho i've trusted the most like\ni'm i'm underneath the mentality now\nwhere like\ni would rather like i i don't believe in\nturning a new leaf for the majority of\npeople like everybody who's ever [ __ ]\nme if i ever gave them another chance\nthey turned around and [ __ ] me again\nuh so like for example like the reason\nwhy me and my family don't have that\ngood of a relationship is because\nuh i never knew when my parents were\ntogether because they were divorced\nbefore i was born\num and so my mom and dad they went their\nseparate ways\nmy mom had a new boyfriend every week\nand my dad currently is on a seventh\ndivorce right now\nso like i don't know yeah i don't know\nwhat a good relationship looks like from\na family standpoint\num my sister when my house burned down\num my sister came out she my sister's\nbeen in jail more times than she's been\nout of jail\nsince she was like 14 so she went to\njuby and all that stuff\nso my house burnt down when both my\nbrothers were deployed and she was\nsupposed to take care of me but instead\nwhat she did was\nshe came to my house took all of my\nmoney that i had to survive until my dad\ncame out of prison\nand then left me alone so then i had to\nlive and find somebody else to stay with\nduring that time period so i got [ __ ]\nby her\nand i already knew she was going to [ __ ]\nhim because of some other things that\nhappened in the past\nuh my brother\nben is very very very aggro um and he\njust scares the [ __ ] out of me and he's\nmade me lose a lot of friends so i i\ndon't think he was good for my life but\nmy brother mike is a massive inspiration\num he's he's one of the people who i\nlook up to most in life and uh\nhe was around me more than my dad when i\nwas a kid\nso i used to call him dad because i\ndidn't actually uh\ni that's what i thought so he's\nhe's like my rock like he's a person i\ncan always go back to\nand then i have my uh my aunt and my\nuncle bruce\nwho were like the first people in my\nfamily to ever talk to me like i was an\nadult and not just because i'm the\nyoungest in my family so everybody\ntalked to me like i was a kid\nlike i was a baby like i was wasting my\nlife but uh they were the first people\nto ever talk to me like uh\ni was like i was an actual adult like i\nactually wasn't a complete absolute\nidiot\nbecause uh pretty much i was always told\neverything that i did which was\ni'm not gonna lie i was a kid the only\nthing i enjoyed was playing world of\nwarcraft and league of legends\nuh and so that's all i did i just played\nvideo games and i always knew i wanted\nto be a content creator and i always\nknew it i always knew i could do it\num and uh that's all i did i was always\nthought i was wasting my time and all\nthat jazz i was always trying to be\nforced into sports\num but i don't give a [ __ ] about sports\ni hate sports i think they're boring i'd\nrather just watch anime about sports\nbecause that's more\nthat's more interesting than me um\nso i want to become a content creator so\ni went to college for theater\num and i did professional theater for\nabout a year and a half and then after\nthat i did professional wrestling for\nabout two years\ni got injured um and then i went back\ninto college to do\ninteractive media and 3d design i got a\ncourse in video game theory that made me\ndo a video essay on banjo and kazooie\num and then i was like wow i just made\nmy first\nyoutube video and i was like why am i\nnot doing this all the time this is the\nbest thing ever\nand so then i dropped out of college and\ni've been doing that ever since and then\nthings have been going great ever since\nuh so that's that's kind of where i'm at\nwith my family and then uh\nmy buddies i i guess\nit's really hard to know\nboundaries that have never been said\nlike so for example beautiful\nyeah yeah like i don't know\nhow to not cross somebody's boundaries\nif they never told me them\nand the first time i lost my virginity\nwhich was when i was 18\ni didn't know that my buddy was in love\nwith the girl who i lost my virginity to\nand so you'd think is we had like an\neight-year-long friendship\nyou'd think that we'd be good but\ninstead oh well you had sex with that\ngirl and i\ndidn't even enjoy it it sucked um well\nyou had sex with her so\nnow we're gone forever and that that was\nthe first time i was really ever heard\nbecause i was like first of all i didn't\neven want to do it\ntwo it was her who came to me and i was\njust like okay well now i can stop being\ncalled a virgin and that'll be awesome\nbecause good lord that [ __ ] haunted me\nfor so long\nuh and so my other buddy\num his girlfriend told me that i was too\npassive aggressive\nget this i'm literally not even kidding\nfor some reason i'm called passive\naggressive\nconstantly like constantly and the\nreason why i was called passive\naggressive\nis because i used the the kitty face\nemoji when i would talk to her because i\nuse that for everybody i\ni think um emojis or emotes\nare required to to fully encapsulate\nhuman speech over text because if i send\nyou a message saying i'm fine period\nyou're gonna think that i'm pissed but\nthen if i said i'm fine\nwith like a happy face then you know oh\nokay well you're actually fine like i\ndon't like\nleaving room to let people intuit what\ni'm saying\nso i like using emojis in order to fill\nthat gap but then i was called\ncondescending and passive aggressive uh\nand so\nshe said it's either me or him and then\nhe chose her\nso i lost him as well uh another\neight-year-long friendship that is\npretty much\ndown the trend and it just keeps going\non like that where i just i just keep\nlosing people and i i keep on getting\ncalled things that i don't understand\nbecause\ni'm a guy who does a lot of meditation i\ndo a lot of self-reflecting\nand yet in my mind there's no way that\npeople could ever get to these uh i\nguess conclusions that they're getting\nto\nyeah they seem to get to them regardless\nand i don't know how to stop them\nokay so just just to clarify a couple\nthings so it seems like multiple people\nhave told you that you are passive\naggressive\nis that fair yes yes okay\num all right john i'm gonna need another\nsecond to process is that cool\nit gave me a lot love it i love it i'm\njust gonna try to organize and try to\nfigure out how to help you okay\nsure\nokay so here's here's the general\ndirection i'm feeling like we should go\nfirst\nand that's i i love the way that you\nsaid you know i don't know how to\nrespect boundaries that were not taught\nto me\nso i'm noticing you know that given your\nhome\nsituation there's a lot of like social\nbehavior\nwhich we like internalize and are\nconditioned to when we see healthy\nrelationships\nso like you know if you think about like\nhow a child learns language\nright like everyone around them is like\ntalking that language so they learn the\nlanguage and it feels supernatural to\nthem\nso there's also a language of healthy\nrelationships\nright so like our brain learns all kinds\nof stuff we learn like mannerisms\nright so my kids like sigh in the way\nthat i\nsigh they'll be like\nyou know like like when when they like\nwhen they don't get the card that they\nwanted and go\nfish they'll have like this subconscious\nkind of like\nbehavioral response they also have ways\nthat they like relate to each other and\nthings like that so for example like\nsometimes they come into the office\nand like they're they know they're not\nsupposed to come into the office but\ni'll say like hey do you remember you're\nnot supposed to come into the office\nand then i'll i'll listen to why they\ncame in and then i'll like send them out\nand so like if you think about it like\nyou know different parents may respond\nto their kids in different ways like if\nthey violate the boundary\ndo they get punished do they get\nreminded of the boundary do i like\nyou know evaluate them so i try to like\ni try to evaluate them when they come in\nand be like is this emergency because\ni want them to come in if it's an\nemergency and and so there's just a lot\nof stuff that like hopefully my kids are\nlearning and i think they have because\nthey do this with other humans now too\nwhere they like you know understand\nboundaries a lot and they understand\nlike kids at the playground there's some\nkids at the playground who don't respect\ntheir boundaries\nand some kids at the playground that do\nrespect their boundaries and in terms of\nwhen a kid doesn't respect their\nboundaries like what is the way that we\ninteract with that kid\nand how do i talk to them so there's\nlike a lot of stuff that like\nour human brain when we're like a\nsix-year-old is like a sponge and it\nabsorbs all kind of crap\nand what i'm noticing just based on your\nhistory is it sounds like the rules of\nrelationships\nthe rules of healthy relationships was\nnot something that your five-year-old\nbrain\nknew how to like didn't get taught\nand so then what happens is as you\nbecome an adult and you engage in other\npeople who are like\nconditioned or they were taught a set of\nrules which like like you guys are\nplaying a game\nwhere like 90 percent of the population\nor let's say 80\nof the population has a shared rule set\nand then you're playing some weird ass\nhardcore\nyou know iron man mod and so it changes\nthe way that you interact with them\nand then like the the passive aggressive\nis is a good\nterm for like when when you're doing\nsomething that someone\ndoesn't like and they can't\npoint to a behavior what they call you\nis passive aggressive\nthey feel like you're doing something\nwrong but you're not actually breaking\nany of the rules which is how you\nlearned it right like\nyou learned like very consciously like\nthese are the rules of how you behave\nwith people\ncase in point i mean you can think about\njust the cognitive work that you've done\nif i tell people it's like an if then\nsip you're like a [ __ ] robot\nif i say i'm fine period they will be\nupset\nif i type i'm fine period you're like an\nai trying to learn human interactions\nand then i add this emoji then they\nwon't be upset\nand so what's happening is you're\nengaging with people where you're like\nfollowing all the rules as you've\nlearned them because you like had to\nfigure this [ __ ] out\nvery like cognitively it wasn't like\ninternalized it wasn't baked in\nand then what happens is you're not\nviolating any of the rules\nbut something is robbing someone the\nwrong way to where they're like\ni can't point to anything wrong that\nhe's doing but i just don't like him\nand then they call you passive\naggressive because there's no sin\nright there's no mistake there's nothing\nthat they can actually call you out on\nand that's that's why it's even more\nconfusing for you because then you're\nlike what the [ __ ]\nam i doing wrong like if i'm making a\nmistake i will try to correct it because\ni care about these people and i care\nabout these relationships but they're\nlike you're passive aggressive and\nyou're like\ni don't know how to be not that\nyou yes yes right exactly what you're\nsaying yes\ni mean if i'm screwing up somewhere just\nlike tell me what i'm screwing up and i\nwant to apologize and i want to change\nbecause this matters to me but they're\nlike you're passive aggressive and\nthere's no\nit's like a dead end there's no solution\nthere yeah\nso does that make sense that makes\na lot of sense yes i've actually i've\nnever thought of it like that way my\nentire life\nyeah so i think it's like you've learned\nit's a really interesting pattern but\nlike\nyou weren't taught the rules of the game\nintuitively so when you don't have the\nintuitive knowledge like\nyou know i i don't know how to say this\nbut like i mean you played a bunch of\ngames right\nso if you play like league of legends\nlike you know that there's\nthere's these abstract concepts like\nmap control and pressure like lane\npressure right like\nand the problem is like if if you don't\nyou can't\nteach someone lane pressure\nthey have to like understand it you know\nlike it's like a principle and so\nwhat can happen is i can analyze a game\nof league of legends\nand i can sort of like come up with a\nset of if then statements\nif three players are pushing top then i\nshould go bottom\nand then like like you know i can do as\nmany of those if then statements that i\nwant to\nand it will sort of approximate lane\npressure but it'll never\ntruly be an understanding of lane\npressure and then what happens is\nthe number of if then statements you\nhave in your head\nworks for like a certain amount of time\nbut unless you understand the equation\nunderneath eventually you'll hit a\nsocial situation\nwhere you don't have an if then\nstatement for it and you'll lose because\nyou don't understand lane pressure\nyeah and that's why it sounds like\nyou're able to maintain relationships\nfor a while\nbut it sounds like eventually you hit\nsome scenario where like\nyou don't know the equation and you're\nlike if then statements don't match it\nand then you kind of screw up in some\nway yeah like i\ni had this situation with my buddy and\nwe were\nso close for like nine months like so\nclose\nand then literally out of nowhere\nthis guy pulls me aside in the discord\ncall and says\nhey you know all of your friends\nactually hate you right\nand they're completely fake to you and\nthe moment that you're not in the call\nlike they're all just [ __ ] on you\nconstantly\nand it was just completely out of the\nblue and like my wife was in those calls\nand like obviously\nyou know she wouldn't lie to me because\nwe've been together for about 10 years\nand it's just sometimes i have this\nexperience where i don't know if i'm\njust not observant\nbut it almost feels like some of the\npeople who are the closest to me\nhave like this flip where they just say\nlike these ridiculously\nrude things to me out of nowhere that\nare completely unbased\nand just try to destroy me it's\nvery strange and i i don't i don't know\nwhat to do about that because i don't\nknow if i'm just\nnot perceptive enough or i don't even\nknow what their motive is\nwell so okay so let's let's bump\ni've a couple of thoughts there but i\nthink probably what i need to do\nis i'm sort of flying blind here like\ni'm taking hail mary shots here\nit seems like they're hitting so far but\ni want to take a step back because i\nhave a lot of thoughts about you know\nwhat you can do\nto you know transform your social\ninteractions\nbut before we get there i want to just\nmake sure that i understand your\nsituation so\ncan you just like tell me more john like\nwhat's been happening to you recently\nlike what's been going on like\nhelp me understand like what your\nexperience of things is\nsure uh when you say with things do you\nmean with my friends or like what's\nhappening with the content grading side\nor just\nwhatever whatever you want to talk about\nlike whatever you want whatever you wish\nwas different just tell me about it\nall right so the thing that i'm having\nan issue is with content creating is\nis that i have been called dramatic\nlike i cause drama and\nin my perspective and maybe you disagree\nlike\nif somebody says literally\nfake things about me and they have a if\nit's a small\nchannel it's easy to ignore but if it's\na big channel saying that\ni did this this and this if i respond to\nthem and tell them why they're wrong\nand prove why because i'd like he said\nshe said scenarios are toxic i try not\nto get involved in those\nbut if i have literal hard proof of that\nno i didn't do any of that look at this\nand then like i don't get how that's me\nbeing dramatic that's me just i don't\nget the difference between causing drama\nand just trying to clear my name like\nanother another big example of that is\nfive months ago no joke i got cancelled\non twitter and they took\nall of these clips from me out of\ncontext\nand i was called\ntransphobic homophobic and a pedophile\nokay and my little sister and my niece\nsaw that\nand the reason why i was called a\npedophile was because i was making this\nthing called a waifu tier list\nwhere there's this character in this\ngame i called her name's clay\nshe's 12 years old and this statement i\nsaid was\nwas that glee could be a waifu for\nanother 12 year old\nso i wanted the ranker at a b tier\nbecause i think in a middle school\nsetting i think they would be cute to be\nboyfriend and girlfriend\nbut instead what people took from that\nwas oh techtone likes to [ __ ]\nkids this retweet thing got over\n20 000 retweets and i disproved\nevery single claim and showed those\nclips in full context but the problem is\nis the person who made the post admitted\nthat they were trying to paint me in a\nbad light\nthey admitted that they hated me and\nthey wanted to cause me [ __ ] but they\nfelt bad because\napparently someone from my community\nwent and tried to dox them\nand i told them don't [ __ ] do that\nwhat are you doing this person's just\nconfused\ni go to their channel i reach out i try\nto check in on them and they said wow i\nwould have never expected this behavior\nfrom you\nadmitted the entire thing that was a lie\nand took the entire post down\nbut the problem is is that with me in\nparticular maybe it happens to everybody\neverybody's there when somebody calls\nyou a [ __ ]\nbut nobody was there when they admitted\noh hey\nthat was a lie so now so many people\nhave this impression of me from an\narticle that got\nso much traction that was completely\nunbased completely inaccurate\nand nobody saw the apology because the\npost itself got twenty thousand retweets\nthe apology got about seven hearts so\nit just sucks because like i i don't get\nwhy like\nthings that are hateful about me get so\nmuch traction but anything that's good\ngets like nothing and there are even\npeople who like say\nif you support techtone you can go [ __ ]\nyourself unfollow me like i just don't\nget it like i don't get that [ __ ] at all\nokay\nwhy do you think they target you\ni have a lot of i have a lot of i have a\nlot of reasons\num one is that when i do stream because\ni was taught this in professional\nwrestling in theater\nthe most authentic acting is when you\ntake yourself and you turn it up to 11.\nso i like to portray myself as like this\nsuper light happy loud fun guy\nwhen in reality i'm actually quite\ndepressed but i like doing that because\ni feel that positivity spreads\nand if i come on streaming because i'm\nnot so two days ago was the first time i\never actually cried on stream because\ngenerally when i feel sad i just turn\noff the camera and i just i just go away\ni have a panic attack and i have tons of\nanxiety but i uh i recently started this\nstuff called ashwagandha which has been\ngreat it's been\nchanged my life to be honest and uh\ni don't really have that many panic\nattacks anymore but i have anxiety\nnon-stop i mean the reason why i think\npeople [ __ ] on me is probably because\ni i definitely give a reaction when when\nsomebody\nyou know says some [ __ ] about me i\ncan't ignore it i have to say it if it\nhas you know\nat least if too many people see it i\nhave to give a statement\nso i do think maybe i respond too much\nand uh\ni guess i'm just in in in my demographic\nwhich is like gotcha games i feel like\ni'm i'm\nextremely outspoken and incredibly loud\nuh and i also don't think people know\nthe difference between my persona\ntechtone and then who i actually am\nwhich is just john\nit's my theory okay\nokay\nokay john i think there's i'm gonna\nso there's this is a whole different can\nit's not a different can of worms\nthere's a whole separate can of worms\nthat is also\ninvolved here which has to do with like\nwhat we've learned at hg about content\ncreators\nand the first thing to understand is\nlike you get you're gonna get a\ndisproportionate amount of hate\nbecause of the way that\ncontent creation works so for example\nlike\nyou know i don't know how much of this\nis personally you and how much of it is\njust like\nthere's almost like a behavioral\nreinforcement where like if i know that\ni'm gonna get an 11 out of 10 response\nif i crap on techtone then what i'm\ngoing to do is crap on techtone because\nhe's going to respond and then like it's\ngoing to become a thing\nright and and then like there's also\nthere's like a whole there's a whole\ni mean it gets complicated because then\npeople feel like self-righteous because\nnow if they think that you're a\npedophile they'll go out of their way to\nexpose you because they think that\nthey're doing the world\nlike good and then if you respond to\nthat like you know it just\nevery response feeds the flames and so\nit's strange but there's almost like a\nbehavioral reinforcement to\neven responding to drama you're actually\nlike\nreinforcing the drama because there are\nthese other things like there's like\nthis darwinian effect where\nyou know the hate post gets 20 000\nwhatever\nand then the apology post gets seven\nwhatever which means that what's\nhappening is the internet from a\ndarwinian fashion\nis actually like selecting for hateful\ncontent\nso like that that it's just a function\nof like the way that our our like\npropagation algorithms and human\npsychology work\ndoes that make sense yeah it does yes\nso so i think the the other thing though\nis that i i think that where this could\noverlap is i'm curious\nwhy like someone would go out of their\nway to take\na bunch of your clips and put them out\nof context to try to like smear you\nso there may be something there that you\nare actually doing that like puts a\ntarget on your back in the first place\ni 100 agree i just have no idea what\nthat is\nso this is where the overlap may be go\nahead do you have ideas\num you sounded like you're about to say\nsomething and i cut you off no yeah no\nbecause that's that's what it's always\nbeen like it's just like\nthere there has to be a reason\nand it sucks because i i don't do\nanything necessarily that other\nstreamers\ndon't do like i pretty much\ni don't know i mean to be all uh\nno i don't i mean no i i don't really\nknow\nokay i wish i i've been trying to\nbecause like i i'm at like\nit can sometimes feel like my brain is\nexploding because like\ni'll just think and i'll think and i'll\nthink and i'll think and like i haven't\ngot that much sleep in the past three\ndays i'm not gonna lie\num because even now like i don't even\nknow\ni'm just trying to process and figure\nout how do i get this to never happen\nagain\nlike how do i how do i stop this\nyes i i don't know that you can stop it\nbut i think\nmy you know what i would try to help you\ndo is not stop it but ra\nrather reduce it and and be able to like\nprocess it\nright because as long as you're a\ncontent creator like people are gonna\n[ __ ] on you like it's just\nit's part of the business yeah and and\nso\nso maybe let's go a little bit more\npersonal and see if there are particular\naspects of your behavior or your\npersonality that like\ntranslate on the stream that are causing\nbecause if you have problems on stream\nand you have problems in your personal\nrelationships\nthere's usually a common element there\nso like maybe the way that we can try to\nelucidate those because there probably\nis some there's some problem right\nbecause you're not like a dumb guy and\nif you're saying\nlike hey this pattern keeps happening\nlike you are the common denominator so\nthat should be like explored\nso can you give me an example so that's\nreally helpful from like a professional\nstandpoint that it seems like you do\nsomething\npeople you get you have a target on your\nback you kind of work like you know then\nthey smear you and then you defend\nyourself and it's\nabsolutely frustrating that you know the\nsmear post gets 20 000 whatever and then\nlike\nthe apology post i've seen the same\nthing in terms of accusations of sexual\nassault and stuff like that with people\nwho are innocent it's actually really\ntragic\nthat you know the accusation gets like\nspread like wildfire and it's like\nguilty until proven innocent\nand then like when someone comes out\nwith uh\num you know with an apology or even like\nrescinds it there's like\nnothing it's like crickets\nand and i've seen this a lot with a lot\nof the the men in my practice where\nthere's almost like\na trauma from being accused of sexual\nassault especially\nand i'm i'm not saying that you know\nit just gets tricky but sometimes you\nknow people are innocent\nand and but their life gets ruined yeah\num so you know i think there's gonna be\nlike there's definitely like just this\naspect in human society where like\naccusations\num spread farther than like\nvindications um and\nand i don't really know what to do about\nthat so let's like kind of focus a\nlittle bit more on\num you know your personal relationship\nso can you tell me\nlike just pick something that's been\nhappening recently with you and and what\nyour understanding of it is\nsure well i would like to say the\nmajority of friends that i have lost is\nmainly just because i've moved around a\nlot\nlike and they don't play video games so\nlike i don't know how to talk to people\nunless we're playing a video game\ntogether okay so that's that's the\nmajority of them\nit's just i move don't know how to\nconnect with regular conversation\nwe don't play the same games or they\ndon't play games so i don't know\nlike first like with my brother who's\nlike one of the guys i'm close with ever\nhe doesn't play video games either so we\njust talk like once a year but when we\ntalk it's like\nlike nothing ever changed like we're\nright there\num with with other issues i i guess\ni have had a lot of friends who have not\nwanted to\nbe my friend because\noh god uh it feels\ni guess maybe i'd\ni say too much like and i i think i give\nmy opinion a little bit too quick\nwhat do you mean like that so like\ni'm pretty aware when somebody is like\nlike when a girl is trying to get with a\nguy\nand i know i know oh god i know when\nsomebody's\ni think i know when somebody's a piece\nof [ __ ]\nbut like for example like when i see one\nof my buddies\nwith a girl who i know is not good for\nhim because like\ni don't know how to i don't know how to\ntell my buddy to to leave a [ __ ] girl\nwhen they've cheated on them twice so\ni'm like\nokay like they may want to deal with it\nbut i'm just like it's just gonna happen\nagain\nlike they [ __ ] another dude when you\nwere gone\nwhy would you forgive that and like i\nguess i'm\ni'm too i'm too abrasive\nbecause when i see things so black and\nwhite and like when i see somebody\nthat's [ __ ] up when i see somebody\nhurt one of my friends i have to say\nsomething\nand and maybe maybe i don't give them\ntheir time to deal with things naturally\nbut i'm just like girl cheats\non boy boy should leave girl\nbecause if not boy gets hurt again\nand so like i don't know how yes i go\nahead\nwhy do you have to say something because\ni don't\ni don't i don't want to see my friends\nget hurt again\nlike if i know it's going to happen\nagain and it'll happen again\ni don't know how to not say yo man you\nshould be careful and i'm never abrasive\nabout i'm just like do you really want\nto go through with this again\nlike i i don't i hate like i can't stand\ni can't stand seeing my friends get hurt\nand so\nwhen i try to sorry go ahead what makes\nthat hard for you\ni think i actually know the point i\nthink i know why it's been so hard\nbecause i once again i i try to figure\nout why do i think this way\nwhy is it so important to me and so i\nbacktracked way back\nway back and this was like first second\ngrade uh\nand my mom had a really a really rough\nlife uh because she had to take care of\nfour kids by herself\nuh because my dad wasn't in the picture\nearly on\nso my mom was so stressed all the time\nso she would get angry\nand she would just unleash havoc on my\ntwo brothers and i loved them more than\nanything\nuh to where my my brother mike would\ncall me the sacrificial lamb of the\nfamily\nbecause when i would see my mother\nyelling at my brothers\ni would do something intentionally\nhorrible\nthat way i could shift her being angry\nat them\nto her being angry at me because then i\nalso know that i can get her to\naccept what i did because i can actually\ngive a heartfelt apology because when i\n[ __ ] up and i'm going into that with the\nmindset of okay i'm going to [ __ ] up\ntremendously\ni know how to apologize and mean it\nbecause i i didn't know my action was\nwrong but like\ni i just i can't i ca it just came back\nfrom that\nit's just when i see other people in\npain it's easier for myself to be in\npain than see them in pain because this\nway i can make that go away for them\nand just kind of take that on myself\nwhich i understand is incredibly\nunhealthy\nbut unhealthy in what way unhealthy for\nme\nbut good for them because on one hand\nthat's just gonna continue\nto you know i guess send people the\nwrong message of who i am because i'm\ndoing things that i wouldn't naturally\ndo\nso that way i can get people to [ __ ] off\nthe other people but then\non the other hand that i don't have to\nsee my brothers or my friends\nget [ __ ] so john i'm gonna ask you\nsome weird questions okay\nanything i'm an open book so when you\nsay when you say\ni can't stand seeing my friends hurt\nso i have to say something whose\nfeelings are you prioritizing in that\ninteraction\ni'm trying to prioritize theirs really\nthink about that for a second\nso what is the emotional driver that is\nprompting you to action\nme not wanting to see them hurt\nso that's that's that's my thing that\nisn't my thing that is oh absolutely\nyeah that is i never thought about that\nway\nso like here's the crazy thing right\nlike it's actually your\nintolerance of their pain that drives\nyou to act\nwhich means there actually isn't you're\nnot placing their feelings above your\nown\ni mean that's true it's the other way\naround even though it's done with love\nbut it's it's really tricky\nright but it's your intolerance\nand this is why like i i mean i think\ncould be anticlimactic but this could be\na huge part of it\nright because when you say like i don't\nunderstand why someone would\nyou know forgive someone who's cheated\non them twice\nabsolutely and that's where you screw up\nbecause you don't like\nthey're not stupid man\nlike they understand that their\ngirlfriend cheated on them twice and\nyou're missing a huge part of the puzzle\nif they're going back\nthat's true and so then what you do is\nyou try to push them based on your\nstandard\nwhich once again like i know it's gonna\nhappen again like you can't see the\nfuture no one can\nyeah you know so it's kind of\ninteresting because like\ni think like part of the problem when\nyou say like i think you're sort of\nright\nin the sense that are you abrasive yes\nlike i think that\nthe tricky thing here is that you're\nabrasive but you're also like kind of\njustified right\nyou're not like telling people things\nthat are like super distort like it's\nnot unreasonable to think that\nhey if like this this person that you're\ndating cheats on you twice like maybe\nyou should find someone else\nyeah but i do think that something\nyou're probably missing something\nbecause if the primary if if you are\nable to if you are not\nable to emotionally tolerate your\nfriends like making mistakes\nand doing in your mind stupid things\nyeah that emotional intolerance is\nprobably blinding you to some\nsignals that they're sending your way i\nagree\n10 billion i think i think i started\nrealizing that when i played league of\nlegends\nbecause whenever i would watch people\nmisplay in league of legends i would\nlose my absolute [ __ ]\nbecause like i can't see i can't stand\nwatching people make mistakes it drives\nme [ __ ] nuts\nso what's up with that\nit's just annoying there's nothing\nthere's nothing oh it's so frustrating\nbecause like in my mind it's like okay\nwell one plus two equals three\nbut then when i see people doing one\nplus two equals five over and over and\nover again\nit's just like i [ __ ] wish people\ncould just get it a little\nbit quicker and when i it it it because\nlike\njust for once again like things just\nmake sense it's like\nokay you you last hit the minions\nand then once you last at their minions\nand if you have more then you go for the\npoke you go for the aggro\nbut then when i see people who like just\nto talk in the the video game terms\nwhen i see people who like shoot at like\nshoot poke at people\nand then they get minion aggro and then\nthey take more damage from the minions\nthen they did that they did the opponent\nand they just lose but they think they\nwon it's just like\ni i can't stand people having\ni guess\nit's hard for me to watch people make\nmistakes it's hard for me to see people\nwho have i guess an illogical train of\nthought\nuh and it just irritates me no end\nbut how do you know or do they think\nthey're illogical\nno they think that they're doing it\nright so how do you know who's right\noh god uh well i guess back in the day i\nwould justify it by saying well\ni'm this rank and you're that rank so\nthen i could use that as a justifier but\nuh\nthat's also incredibly toxic what makes\nthat toxic\nuh well i think i think flexing rank is\npretty egotistical\nlike i'm i'm underneath the mindset\ni have i have a lot of very strong\nopinions alok um\nis it okay if i call you alok or sure\nabsolutely man okay i remember you\ntaught me an analogy i think i was i was\nwatching a lot of your vid i've always\nwatched your videos\nyou said an analogy where it's like it's\nnot it's not all wood it's all oak i\nthink that's what you said\nyeah i love that so much um i guess i\nhave\ni think my opinions are like borderline\ntoo strong and that's\nthat's probably something i need to stop\nbecause i'll say things like on stream\nfor example i don't think\npeople play league of legends because\nthey like league of legends i think\npeople play league of legends because\nthey're not doing anything\nin their real life and when they get a\nrank up or they go from bronze four to\nbronze three they feel established even\nthough they didn't do [ __ ] all the\nentire day and it means nothing\nso like so john i'm going to reign\na little bit buddy so let's go back to\nso so like i know it sounds kind of\nweird but like\nyou your mind produces things that are\nright right\ni think so and your friend produces\nthings that are wrong\nright i would agree with this yes\nso how do you know who's right and who's\nwrong\nby showing them the errors of their\nactions\nbut so if you if you get into an\nargument with someone on league and you\nsay hey man don't poke unless you've got\ncreep advantage\nyeah do they respond with some\nincorrect logical argument\nsome friends yes and some friends know\nso like then how do you know like you\nhave what you perceive to be a logical\nargument\nthey have what they perceive to be a\nlogical argument right yeah\nyeah how do you know who's right and\nwho's wrong you can continue trying to\nconvince them\nthey're going to continue trying to\nconvince you yeah by\ni guess by demonstrating like showing\nthem\nyou know like okay well then let's go\ninto a game and i will show you right\nnow\nand then i will so that may work in\nleague\nbut yes how do you resolve that in real\nlife\ni have no idea so so here's the thing\nso oddly enough i think that flexing\nrank is about ego but like\nlet's be clear right so\nsometimes i'll you know i'm i'm a crappy\nplayer in dota\nit used to be pretty good but you know\nover the years\nover the decades over the decade i've\nyou know drifted downward in skill and\ndota players have gotten better\nover a decade like i think the people\nwho still play like take the game pretty\nseriously\nand so like i think you can make a\nstrong argument that if i have an\nopinion about what's right right and\nwhat's wrong\nand then there's like someone who's top\n10 on the ladder\non the north american ladder who tells\nme that i'm wrong\ni think there's a reasonable argument\nthat we're like\ni have no leg to stand on like\nirrespective of how logical i think i\nam and how logical they think they are\nwe both think we're logical but they're\njust right\nand i'm wrong by virtue of like an\nobjective\nquantifier about our skill right yeah\nso flexing rank is egotistical\nabsolutely but like there's no question\nhere that i'm wrong and they're right\nso here's the question what's your\nreal-life\nsocial rank\nin my i have no idea how people perceive\nme\ni think i okay so on the internet\nit's really high i think\nin real life i can barely string\ntogether sentences in front of actual\npeople\nso this is where like i know it sounds\ncrazy but when your friend\ndecides to give this girl another chance\nafter she's\ncheated on him twice yeah you know like\nmaybe be a little bit more open-minded\nlike when you ask the question like why\nwould anyone do that\nactually try to find an answer because\nthey're not stupid right like\nyeah there's gotta be like the more the\nworse that she treats him\nthe bigger the reason because that\nthere's a scale in their mind\nright like this person has cheated on me\ntwice i should break up with them\nbut there's got to be something stronger\nthan that negative that's keeping them\nin the relationship\nmy my mind is because i i'm very\ni'm very asexual like i i don't give a\n[ __ ] about sex\nit's like in my mind i'm just like okay\nwell maybe the sex is really good\nand that's the only thing i ever think\nof and that's probably my bet because\ni'm out of power yeah so\nhere's here's where i think we run into\nthe problem john\nyes when you don't know something in\nyour mind\nwhere do you go to for answers\nhow do you so when you say i don't\nunderstand why they're in a relationship\nhow did you figure out what conclusion\ndo you come to\nit must be for the sex yeah it's messed\nwith effects and also\nthis particular friend has been cheated\non in every single one of his\nrelationships\nokay this particular one so i figured\nokay well it's just gonna happen again\nuh and then for all other questions i'm\njust like i'm just google it\nevery single time i have a single\nquestion my head ever i'm so google it\nlet me share something with you if you\ndon't understand something in a\nrelationship\nmaybe try asking the other person\ni have never tried that once ever and\ntherein lies i think a major piece of\nsocial conditioning that you probably\nnever saw at home\nthat makes a lot of sense\ni i can honestly say i've never done\nthat a single time\never\nso now we're walking the tightrope\nbecause how do you feel\njohn\ni feel i feel really stupid\nuh yep so do you remember no\ndo you remember what the tightrope is\nwe talked about it so we talked about\nyou know this whole thing about\naccepting responsibility but like\nlike treating yourself with compassion\nand being careful about blaming yourself\nyeah so do you see how it's like because\nit seems\nso idiotic\nright so let's try to be a little bit\ncompassionate and understanding because\ni know it's kind of weird but i want you\nto try to understand yourself\nand in this moment you may feel like an\nidiot but understand\nwhat kind of upbringing does someone\nneed to have to where they like\nnever ask someone questions in\nrelationships\nis it really that you're that idiotic or\nsimply that like you were never exposed\nto it right\nlike it's really not your fault man\nyeah that's crazy because yeah because\nwhen you when you said that i had a i\nhad an issue with another content credit\nwhere it literally all could have been\nsolved if i just sent them one discord\nmessage\nand said hey are you okay man but i just\ni just don't do that and i don't know\nwhy i don't do that\nokay so it's so simple i\ni literally don't get why i don't do\nthat at all well so\nall the most brilliant revelations seem\nsimple\nafterward right but like like so let\nlet's\nnow let's try to be like understanding\nso like i know it's kind of weird but\nyou're making\nthat you're doing the same thing again\nwe're like let's try to\naccept that there's a damn good reason\nyou don't do it instead of saying it's\nstupid i should just do it\ndoes that make sense yeah and it's weird\nbecause the reason why that\nwhy that affects me so much is like i've\nliterally never considered that a single\ntime\never and i'm 27.\nthat i yeah that's shocking\nso what's what's your understanding of\nwhy you haven't considered it a single\ntime\ni guess i judge people too quickly\nand when i think someone's a bad person\ni don't want to speak to them i don't\nreally i really i don't like hearing\nthem out\nbut i definitely should yeah so let\ngot to be careful john because your mind\nis jumping to conclusions pretty quickly\nokay\nso now i'm going to share a couple of\nother things so i think that the reason\nthat you don't do this\nis because you were taught or there was\nlike an evolutionary\nlike you if your mind evolved in a\nparticular\nlike circumstance right like\nyou your mind evolved in a place where\nblack and white judgment was critical\nlike you had to like go all in like when\nyour mom is yelling at your two brothers\nyou don't have time to appreciate nuance\nor ask her how she's feeling because\nthat's not gonna do anything\nwhat you've got to do is like go black\nand white you go ham you go hard and you\ncommit to an action and you follow\nthrough completely because it's gonna be\na bumpy ride\nyou see that yeah and so like i i want\nyou to be really careful about blaming\nyourself because like i think this is\nthe trick that you use to survive\nbecause in in the environment you grew\nup in\npeople who seemed to be bad like were\nbad\nlike divorce one is followed by divorce\ntwo three four five six and seven\nthat is staggering that is the most\ndiverse divorces i've ever heard of\nyeah it's honestly quite impressive so\nso like here\nhere's the problem like you're playing\nlike so the rules of the game that you\nlearned\nare like a mod that's the way that i\nwant you to think about it it doesn't\nmake you stupid\nit's just like if i started off playing\nyou know dota dota was originally a\nwarcraft 3 mod\nright yes so like when i play dota and i\nlearn the rules of dota in the warcraft\n3 engine\nand then i play a game of warcraft 3 on\nladder\nboy am i gonna feel stupid\nbecause like the mod is just completely\ndifferent\nbut it's not that i'm stupid it's just\nthat like i've played with this mod\nand there's this whole different rule\nset and you just haven't\nlearned the rule set you've learned in\nsome way\nright it's sort of like you're playing\nlike your micro is so intensive in\nwarcraft 3 that you even win some games\nbut in dota there's no such thing as\nlike mining gold out of your gold mine\nand so you're not mining gold in\nwarcraft 3 and you're still\nmanaging to win games because you're\nmissing some huge key\nmechanical differences in relationships\nand i think the reason that you get\ncalled passive aggressive is because\nyou see your mind comes to a conclusion\nand you don't really try to understand\nsomeone else's perspective because like\nin your experience that's been a waste\nof time or not your experience\nyour brain is telling you there's no\npoint in doing that because you just\nsaid i'm pretty sure i know when someone\nis a pos like i can judge them very\nquickly\nyeah right so like that is the strategy\nthat worked that was the meta\nin your household is there's like\nthere's the good apples and there's the\nbad apples like very clearly like you've\ngot your sister\nyou've got your dad and you've got your\nmom with your bad apples and then you've\ngot your one brother which is a good\napple\nand you've got your wife which is a good\napple and you've got this other friend\nwho's a good apple and everyone else is\nbad apples\nbut that conception i think the biggest\nthing john is that i'm not\nhearing space for another person in your\nrelationships\nyou are 100 correct that that is how it\ngoes with me\nit's either we're like best friends or i\nwant nothing to do with you\nand it's always been that way there's\nnever been there's never i don't have\nacquaintances\nit's either like i'm all in or i'm all\nout a hundred percent\nyeah so i i and and that too i think\nthat those are going to be like\nunless you can navigate the shades of\ngray like i think this is going to\ncontinue happening\nright because you're going to get super\ntight with people super quick\nand then like that's fine because both\ny'all are like\nyou know nitro boosts all in for this\nrelationship\nand then eventually like something is\ngonna it's just not sustainable it's\njust you can't\nyou know maybe with a wife you can swing\nthat right because you all are like tied\ntogether and there's like no\ncoming back from that sort of thing but\ni\ni mean i think it's like i know it\nsounds kind of silly but like i think\nit's sort of like\nyou know i i i suspect that the more you\ntry to\nunderstand someone else in your\nrelationships\nthe less passive aggressive you will be\nperceived\nbecause i think you're right that like\nyou don't make mistakes per se\nright but that there's no understanding\nof them so what you're doing you're\nalmost like\nflying in this relationship blind like\nyou don't really know what they're\nthinking or feeling but you sort of have\nlike a rule set that you follow\nand since you're a smart [ __ ]\nyour rule set has become really good\nyou know how to like not make a mistake\nin a relationship but there's no space\nfor the other person's thoughts feelings\nperspectives\nit's about right or wrong yep\nyeah i 100 agree that makes a lot of\nsense\nhelp me understand why you agree\nbecause first of all there's this other\nthing that i do\nin conversations which is and also if i\nswear\ni have this problem where i switch\ntopics a lot\ni have a really hard time like locking\nit in it's all good man\nyeah as you were as you were speaking to\nme about um\nabout like why i work the way that i\nwork and like the different rule sets i\nwas always thinking why do i get so\nclose with people so quick\nand it's because i have like this\nmassive fear of like not having a good\nconversation so like when i talk to a\nnew person\nlike i want it to be like\ni watch too much goddamn anime and i i\nwant it to be like\noh like with every single new person i\nmeet\nwhich is why i'm so rapid fire all the\ntime like i can't stand dead space and\nconversation\nand that leads me to where like if i get\nthat rapid-fire successful conversation\nthen okay we're best friends but then if\ni don't get that then i'm like okay well\nwe're just incompatible and then i don't\nknow what to do with you\nso yeah uh sorry my brain is\nno all over the place that's i think\nit's really helpful\ni think your tangents are filled with\nhidden treasure\nso what i'm hearing there once again\nlike i want you to just pay attention to\nthis john that like\nin a relationship when you say i don't\nknow what to do with you\nyeah that's a very lopsided way to look\nat a relationship\nright because whose responsibility is it\nto figure out how to make the\nrelationship work\nthat's mind slash ours\ncan't be both ours\nthat's the right answer is that the way\nthat you do it\nno not really no there we go\nright so if a conversation isn't going\nbop\nwhose fault is it uh both of ours not\njust mine\nbut what do you think it's my fault\nabsolutely i have to make it go\nup yeah so you're accepting too much\nresponsibility for the conversation\nyeah and then what happens is even if\nyou can make the conversation work\ni know it sounds kind of weird but then\nit's like it's a hundred percent you and\nzero percent them\nand that's just not sustainable in a\nrelationship\ni agree 100 right so let's talk about\nyour wife for a second if you're okay\nwith that\ni would love to so like what is your\nwhat are your conversations with her\nlike\ni act with my wife like with no one else\non this entire earth\num the moment i get off stream\nthat's why you've been together for 10\nyears but let's keep listening because i\nthink we've found our formula for\nsuccess\nso let's hear it yeah with with frame\nthere's this little bucket of sunshine\nuh\ni instantly go to like you know baby\ntalking\nlike talking uh just goofing around\njust we even have like this\nour own terminology that we only use\nwith each other\nuh it's just i can i can literally count\non one hand\nthe amount of arguments we've had in 10\nyears\nbecause we just we've never done that we\njust don't do that like i don't know i i\nfeel like frames is perfect for me\nuh yeah she's just very nice she's very\nunderstanding um\ni definitely talk way more than she does\nshe is an incredible listener which is\ngreat and\num she does not\nunderstand anything in the world\nso she comes to me for guidance on\npretty much every single decision she\nmakes in her entire life\nbecause she just doesn't know what to do\nbecause uh she also had a very her and i\nhave very similar backgrounds\num she got really messed up by a lot of\npeople and then um\nwhen i came into her life i cleaned her\nup um she had a lot of bad habits that\nuh we got her to kick ones they're very\nunhealthy for her body\num and i make\nher happy and she makes me happy i\nunderstand her 100 percent she\nunderstands me understand uh\nforgiveness is everything and uh\ni'm underneath the mindset we're like i\ndon't think it's hard to not [ __ ] up\nlike i feel like it takes a lot of like\nif you're in a relationship i feel like\nit's very hard to [ __ ] up with somebody\nif you truly care about them\nso like her and i have pretty much never\n[ __ ] up and and when\nit has happened we talk about it on the\nspot we have never gone to bed angry a\nsingle time\nwhenever there's an issue we talk about\nit instantly um and we also don't leave\neach other's\nside ever uh the longest she's ever left\nmy side was probably like an hour to go\nto groceries other than that we go\nabsolutely everywhere together it's\nwe're\nattached on the hip she's amazing but\nyeah we do everything together we play\ngames together uh we watch the same\nmovies we watch the same anime and uh\nyeah and she's just amazing\nand when you guys have an argument and\ny'all talk it out\nyeah do you usually find that she ends\nup\nunderstanding your perspective pretty\nwell yes\ndo you understand her perspective pretty\nwell yes\nlike like i'll i'll have no idea how\nlike she'll came\nto do what she did but then after she\nexplains it\ni just think oh okay well she never\nlearned\nthat doing that was wrong and then i\nfeel\nit's okay\nso are you wrong in the relationship\never\ni i okay now this is a this is a tricky\nsituation though\nyeah because i get afraid\nof my wife because she's never\never mad at me she and i can say this\nhonestly she has said i have\nnever made a mistake ever and that\nfreaks me out\nbecause the reason why that freaks me\nout is is now that we're 10 years into a\nrelationship\nif i do [ __ ] up and she hasn't seen this\nbefore\nis it going to be okay but i can\nhonestly say this genuinely\nshe has told me and like i'll even say\nare you sure you're okay with what\nhappened are you sure you're okay\nand she's like it's absolutely okay i\nunderstand\nit's not a problem she no i can honestly\nsay i've\ni hate saying that it makes me feel like\nsuch a dick but no i can honestly say i\nhave\nin her eyes never been wrong even even\nwhen i feel that i am\nwhen i feel that i [ __ ] up she'll\nstill say no you're good\nit's okay what do you think about that\nit freaks me the [ __ ] out what freaks\nyou out about it\ni feel like my wife is way too accepting\nof me\nlike too accepting like it's like\nit's it is [ __ ] weird because i'm\njust like\ni feel like i [ __ ] up here why is she\nnot mad at me why is she never angry at\nme\nlike ever and it's been like this way\nfor a decade a decade\nlike a [ __ ] decade dude\nso it is scary what's scary about it\ni i feel like there's something in her\nbrain that's wired\nstrangely to make her over forgiving\nbecause i i will say my wife has come\nfrom\nvery abusive relationships very abusive\nand in my head i'm like\nhas my wife been conditioned to just\nforgiving poor behavior out of fear\nfor herself and is that happening with\nus sure\nso i think that that's a reasonable\nhypothesis right\nyeah and then the other thing to kind of\nthink a little bit about is\nso so i think the reason y'all's\nrelationship works is because there's\nmatching conditioning\nokay right that that like if you kind of\nthink about it you're telling me that\nyou have relationship problems with a\nlot of people\nbut that this seems to be like a very\nsuccessful relationship\nand what i'm hearing is that both of you\nguys were kind of like screwed up in a\nparticular way\nbut the way that each of you has sort of\nlike cracked and fractured\nsort of fits well with each other\nis that fair to say yeah yeah we also uh\nwe we also share the same mental illness\nwhich is actually how we uh how we\nbonded\nokay and and what how do you understand\nif she's sort of been conditioned in a\nparticular way to be overly forgiving\nwhat kind of person does she need to\ndate to have a successful relationship\nwhat balances that out\nshe's over well i guess a guy who messes\nup a lot would make sense in my head\nthan\nthe yin and yang or someone who doesn't\nmess up ever and that way she doesn't\nget\nmistreated are the two things that i\nhave in my head\nyeah so i'd say the third thing is\nsomeone who's not forgiving enough\nman you are messing me up today jesus\nyep\nyep i agree\nright so it didn't mean to body blow you\nthere but i recognize that may have been\na little\nbody blow yeah\ni agree so we're gonna we're gonna try\nto like\nhelp you out there but and i i think i\nthink just to be fair it sounds like\nyou've made every effort\nit's just her you know saint-like\nforgiveness\noutweighs yeah so i think she's just\nshe's out playing you there she's higher\nmmr\nso you've tried to accept fault time and\ntime and time again\nbut she just won't let you yeah\nright but i i think the key thing here\ni'm not trying to paint you out to be an\n[ __ ] or anything like that i\nrecognize that there's gonna be like a\nlot of blame and stuff\nbut i think it's just like i know it\nsounds kind of weird but i've seen\npeople have this idea that\nyou know a successful relationship is a\nparticular thing\nlike it means that two human beings are\na particular way whereas\nmy experience has been actually that\nlike a lot of really successful\nrelationships\ncome when two screwed up people are like\nscrewed up in the right ways for each\nother\nand so so i think that there's something\nabout you know i i don't\nget the sense that you're actually\nabusive and so it's probably like\nlike and at the same time you know it\ndoes sound a little bit\nlike there's a power dynamic in the\nrelationship or some degree of\ncodependency\nthere is a hundred percent of power\ndynamic one billion percent\nbecause like and i'm so sentient of it\ni'm so worried about it\ni asked my wife at least twice a week\nhey if i were to mess up\nyou know it's okay to be angry at me you\nknow it's okay to tell me that i did\nsomething wrong and she's like yeah i\njust you never do\nand i'm like all right and it's it's\nuncomfortable for me it is uncomfortable\nbecause i\ni am so worried because of the [ __ ] that\nshe's been through that i will also be\npart of the problem so i try to be so\ncognizant of how she's feeling about\nwhat she's doing why she's doing that\nbut it is\nit is scary because i don't want to ever\ndo anything to hurt her ever\nyeah i get that john so i'm going to try\nto equip you with a slightly different\napproach right so when you say you know\nit's okay to be angry with me\nyeah who has the power in that\nrelationship\nthat's me giving her permission to\nabsolutely permission is the right word\nyep right so then the question\nso what i would what i would recommend i\nthink here's the big thing right so like\nyou'll give her permission\nbut i'm not hearing a question\nright so i think the biggest thing that\nyou need to add to your relationships is\nquestions\nokay so like like what i would recommend\nto you uh\nor am i making you feel like an [ __ ]\nno you are it feels like i have a puzzle\nin my head that you're adding more\npieces than salt yeah\nso so the next time you think you screw\nup\nyeah and you ask her are you sure i\ndidn't screw up and she's like no it's\ntotally fine like it's fine she has\nsaint like forgiveness cool\nbut what i would really like encourage\nyou to do is like you know\nswitch characters for a second instead\nof spamming\nyou know animo dps like switch\nand then like you know go to like an\nearth character and like use a shield\nit's like a different shirt it's the\nsame button\nbut it's a completely different thing it\ndoesn't even do any damage\nyeah but it will help you win the\nencounter and ask her\ncan you help me understand why you don't\nthink i screwed up\nyep right that's a damn good question so\nso like and it's not\nit's not about like permission or\nanything because it's it's tricky\nbecause i i don't doubt like i really\ndon't think you're sort of to blame for\nthis john because i think\nthis relationship like you guys sort of\nmanaged to make it work like in a\nparticular way\nso we don't want to like give her i know\nsounds kind of weird but like it's going\nto be like\nvery hard on both of you if the power\ndynamic switches rapidly\nright she doesn't know what to do with\nit and you don't know how to let it go\nso like y'all aren't ready for that yet\nbut at the same time i think the main\nthing is when you have a friend you know\nthis is where like the main thing that\nyou need to learn is like\nsix out of the seven k or five out of\nsix characters you've got are gonna have\nlike an\nr2 that does damage but like you just\nneed that one shield\nright there's like a different dynamic\nso when you have a friend who and this\nis where i'd be careful about your\nyour like black and white judgments i'm\nnot blaming you\ni'm not blaming that your mind makes\nthem right so like you've just learned\nhow to do that fine\nbut i think what you've got to\nincorporate is like if your friend is\nlike dating someone again for like\nthe the next you know the nth time and\nyou're afraid that they're gonna cheat\nyou should try to understand them right\ntry to ask like what do you see in this\nperson and then share your feelings and\nthen listen\nso another technique that i'm gonna do\nis sometimes i get worried that this\nperson may cheat on you again\nand then and try to instead of trying to\nconvince them ask them what do you think\nabout that\nlike instead of trying to convince them\nask why they disagree with what i'm\nsaying\nor not even disagree because disagree\nand agree means that one of y'all loses\nand one of y'all wins\nokay just open-ended like they can move\nin whatever direction they want to in\nthe conversation\nwhat do you think you know they say\nyeah i know they may disagree i mean i i\nknow that they may cheat but like i care\nabout them so much\nand then your mind is gonna tell you\nthat's idiotic\nokay right\nyou restrain it john yep yep\num and and then then you can say like\nit's hard but then you know you don't\nthis is where maybe you are a little bit\nabrasive right yeah because then your\nmind is gonna be like you're a dumbass\nbro\nyeah so don't say that right so so this\nis where you can say i\ni i'm i'm having trouble\nlike understanding like how you can be\nso forgiving\nand how you can like take that risk\nagain\ncan you help me understand like how\nyou're able to take that risk\nit feels like it would be too much for\nme\nyeah and what you're saying is uh what\nalso helped click in my head is that\ni can definitely this i don't know if\nit's passive aggressive or aggressive or\nit's just a [ __ ] dick thing to do\nbut when i have in the past asked people\nlike\nhow the how the [ __ ] could you possibly\nthink that and they give me their\nrationale\ni have this really bad habit where when\ni get frustrated i start laughing\nand it's really bad because it's really\noffensive but uh yeah\nbecause like i'll be like okay so you\ndon't think she's going to do this again\nno she won't do it again i'll i'll just\nstart\nlaughing hysterically which is really\nbad it's really that is bad\nyeah it's like i yeah i smile when i get\nangry i laugh when i get angry\num and um yeah i i pretty much mask\neverything when i get sad so that's\nsomething that i need to i need to\n[ __ ] stop and it's it's not like\nextend it's just like like just one loud\nlaugh it's\nit's bad yeah yeah so it's it's it comes\nacross as very condescending\nyes it does yes it does it is horrible\nand so so i'd say you know tips there\nare first of all let people know that\nthat's how you like you have a lot of\ntrouble processing negative emotions\nthe other thing you can do is apologize\nyes\num and and then once again like when\nwhen you apologize like listen to them\nlike don't apologize for what you feel\nbad for\ni know it sounds kind of weird but\napologize for\nhow they are hurt and that involves\nlistening to them first\nso you'll probably like if you laugh\ninappropriately you'll be like i'm so\nsorry that was a mean thing to do\nbut once again there's not room for them\nto tell you like whether it was okay or\nnot okay\ndoes that make sense so i think the\nbiggest thing john is like and i think\nthe passive aggressive stuff will sort\nof go away because i think you've\nlearned\nhow to not break the rules of the\nrelationship but also\nlike you manage to not let other people\nbe in the relationship\nyeah and and so that's gonna come across\nas like\nand they don't know how to like point\nthis out right because they're like\nthey don't know what else to call it\nbecause you're not really doing anything\nwrong\nit's just you're not giving them space\nto participate in the conversation\nyou're not trying to really understand\nthem and stuff like that\nwhich you know you got to be careful\nabout\ni think that's another thing that i\ngreatly made a mistake with\nwas that even though i'm all in on them\ni never asked if they were all in on me\nor whether they're okay with you being\nall in on them\nexactly and so like i will joke with\npeople\nwho i love but then i realize they're\nindifferent about me\nso that the jokes i say towards them are\nperceived as passive aggressiveness\nwhen in reality it's just a joke and if\nwe were as close\ntogether as i thought we were then it\nwould have just been\nwe're bodies at least in my head so i\nthink i need\nbefore i joke with people i need to make\nsure that we're as good as each other\nlike i think\nyeah so so you you got to be careful\nbecause like like there's the problem\nit's\nsuper subtle i'd say like go back and\nwatch this vod but pay attention to your\nwords you said\nthey we weren't that tight and in\nreality\nand then you share your opinion it's\nlike really interesting how you\nconstruct it because you're saying that\nthere's\nyou're right at the end but it's it's\nreally in i don't know how to like\nhighlight this but you said\ni said something and they perceived it\nthis way\nbut in reality this is really what it\nwas\nwhereas no it's not in reality like\nthat's a whole problem\nit's like their perceptions are just as\nvalid as yours okay\nright and and yeah i've i've been told i\ndo something weird when i talk\nso i'm thinking you just told me what\nthat was so i think i need to identify\nthat\nyeah like i would say like literally go\nback and like watch this time stamp in\nthe vaude because\nwhat i'm noticing in your mind is like\nthey have a perception\nbut you are entitled to the reality of\nthe situation\nwhich is the whole crux of the problem\nyeah\nright so like like this is where like\ncommunication it's not like\none party has the reality of it\nyeah because their reality is just as\nimportant as my reality\nabsolutely so even though i i know my\nintentions\nthey don't know my intentions so that\ndoesn't justify the reality in my\nperception because the reality\nis both bars combined not by exclusively\nexactly\nlet's go dr k you're you're a goddamn\nmagician jesus\nit's nice to have a five-star character\nto talk to\nbecause yeah everything is just gonna\nwork better your stats are just better\nyeah i agree god damn you're you're\ndoing really well john you're\nable to tolerate a lot of things that um\nyou know can be like very devastating to\nfeel\nyeah i'm i'm trying i see that i see\nthat\ni'm not you know i'm not being i'm not\nwhole\ni'm not pulling my punches yeah\nso you know and i appreciate that\nbecause i feel like i've beaten this for\na very long time\nyeah i mean i i appreciate it too\nbecause i i try you know i don't\ni yeah\ni try not to pull my punches when people\ncan handle it\nyeah but handling it is tough so so be\ncareful because you know today tomorrow\nthe next week\nthere may be like residual feelings of\nthat blame and that guilt or i'm such an\n[ __ ] and things like that like those\nmay come up\num you know so just be prepared for\nthose it doesn't mean that they're true\nbecause once again those are thoughts\nproduced by your mind\nthey're your black and white thinking\ntelling you oh my god i can't believe i\nhave been so dumb right like it's it's\nall like be careful because that black\nand white thinking may cause you to\nconclude particular things which i want\nyou to\nbe careful of of course i don't think\nyou're\na bad person i think that you just\nhaven't learned how to do this yet\nand that's because you weren't taught\nlike it was you were never given the\nopportunity\nright\nquestions thoughts uh\nwell i i think i think i will be okay\nwith self-depreciation\nbecause now that i know\nthis information you've given to me i i\nthink i'm gonna be okay\ni know that i have some apologizing to\ndo for sure\num but i think i'm gonna be able to i\nguess understand myself and understand\nother people a lot more better\nor just a lot better sorry uh\nanother question you've been making a\nlot of references to the game that i\nplayed do you know what gadget impact is\nyeah i just uh so i i heard that you\nwere a gentian impact streamer and i\nliterally installed gunship\nlike three years uh three weeks ago\nso i've been playing it like how does he\nknow what agamo is that's like okay\nthat's crazy\nyeah all i know about you is that you're\nagainst an impact streamer that's all i\nknew yeah\nyeah of course um that's like another\nquestion i had\noh man i wish i wrote these down you've\nhelped me with so much\nand i know i'm gonna be able to use this\nreally good for the future\num\noh yeah then you said don't you don't\nhave to respond to that\ni think\ni guess another random question is yeah\ni don't know if i'll do anything\num how how much time do you think\ni should be getting away from my\ncomputer and devices\nbecause i'm on them non-stop like that's\nprobably not good for me right\nwhat do you think i think i should\nminimize my time content creating\nby so much because i'm doing that for\nlike 12 14 hours a day\nuh and then i try to get away from my\ncomputer but\nwait oh yes okay this is the real\nquestion i want to ask that one i i'm\npretty sure i can handle it i want to i\nwant to get the computer a lot more\nbut what i wanted to say is i have this\nproblem where sometimes i get afraid of\nspeaking\nbecause i i i analyze everything that i\nsay\nand i try to limit the amount that\npeople can intuit from what i say\nthat way i can say correct statements\nlike so\nall before i say anything and i'm a\nreally quick thinker i'm like if i say\nthis\nit will trigger that if i say this it\nwill give them\nthat idea that's really bad to do\nright yeah so john all roads\nlead to home or rome so let me ask you\nwhen you do that you're in a\nconversation right\nyes so are you playing a single player\ngame\nor a co-op game go off game go off game\nwell no oh when i do that it's single\nplayer absolutely\nthere's the problem right so you're\ntrying so hard to predict\nand determine the rightness of things\nthat you say\nbut you're treating the other person\nlike an npc\nyes i am right so like like don't rely\nso\nmuch on yourself and let them share some\nof the responsibility\nof like the conversation\nokay right because like when\nyeah yeah i knew that was [ __ ] up and\ni knew it was so horrible\nfor me to do that i need to stop that i\nneed to stop that so much\nbecause that that is the thing like\nsometimes i'll be afraid to like join\nlike discord calls my buddies\nbecause then i know like it's like\nall right here we go like this needs to\ngo perfectly here we go\nyeah so so let i'm gonna ask you\nsomething john how do you think it\nfeels to be on the receiving end of your\nconversations\ni have been told it's very fun\nyep i have been told that i make things\nvery fun\nyep but\nit's generally also not that fun for me\nto do\nbecause sometimes i just want to [ __ ]\nchill yes\nso what i would suggest or what i would\nimagine\nis that you dominate a conversation yes\ni do\nto the benefit of others sure because\nit's like you come in and they get their\nown personal stand-up comedian\nbut there's absolutely a comedian on\nstage which is hilarious\nand then there's an audience\nright so like it's fun i i have no doubt\nin my mind that being in a discord call\nwith you\nis a riot but\ni i also think it's closer to watching a\nnetflix special\non by a comedian than it is to a\nconversation\nbecause i think i think you occupy a lot\nof space\nin the room yep\nyeah i would say my amount of real\nconversations as you said i've i've\nprobably not had that many\nyeah because yeah\nyeah i agree what do you think about our\nconversation\ni thought it was a complete dialogue i\nfelt like it was two human beings\nattempting to connect with each other\nand i think that\ni mean i i would say that we have\nbecause\ni've i feel like i've learned a lot i've\nfelt a lot and i think that's why i had\nsuch a strong emotional reaction because\ni i don't cry i don't but like i've my\nmy tear ducts have been exploding for\nthe past two hours too much my eyes\nburn uh i feel like i've held a lot of\nbaggage and i feel like you've relieved\na lot of that stress and i feel like\nthis is\ni'm gonna remember this for a long time\nbecause i feel like there's gonna be a\nbig turning point for me and and i just\nfeel like our conversation was\nvery authentic what makes it a dialogue\nhow much more i was listening to you\nthan thinking about the things that were\ncoming out of my mouth\nright and so i'm doing the same thing\nyeah so you're you're giving me space\nat times and then i'm giving you space\nat times it's almost like you know we're\ntossing a ball back and forth\nwhich is really what a dialogue should\nbe like because you're not responsible\nfor\nmaking the conversation work so i think\noddly enough this has been helpful\nbecause you came into this\ni i imagine that you may actually feel\nless pressure so notice what i'm doing\ni'm about to check in with you right i\nhave a hypothesis\nso i'm going to check in with you we're\ngoing to see maybe i'm right maybe i'm\nwrong in a bizarre way i wonder if you\nactually feel\nless pressure in this conversation than\nyou do\nin a discord call with your friends yes\ni feel\npretty much zero pressure whatsoever and\nhow do you understand\nwhy don't you feel pressure here\nwhy don't i feel pressure here um\nwell one because i think that you care\nand one i think that you are trying to\nhelp me\nuh and two i have a lot of trust in you\nso i think i think it's a combination of\nthose three things\nokay so i think those are all wonderful\nthings and i'd like to toss out a fourth\nokay sure which is that you you're not\nresponsible\nentirely for this conversation going\nwell\nyeah right so you're putting some of\nthat responsibility on me\ni think the reason it's a good\nconversation is because we're actually\nlike seriously like we're going co-op\nmode here\nyeah whereas from what i've heard from\nyou is that a lot of times when you have\nconversations\nit's like you feel\nso responsible for making sure the\nconversation goes right that you don't\ngo into co-op mode\nyeah i would agree with that right so\nit's like\nam i playing league of legends as the\nadc\nand it's me versus nine bots or\nare we actually playing a team game\nwhere like each person is supposed to\ncarry their weight\nand actually if people like take farm in\nthe wrong place and start to carry\nmore than their weight it actually hurts\nthe team\nyeah i'm saying that a lot i i sometimes\nsee some comments on my videos where i\ndo collabs with other people\nwhere it says that like i'm very like\nabrasive and then i was like very like\nall-encompassing\nyeah and then i realized yeah it's\nbecause i was make i was i wasn't\ntrusting the other person\nto help me out i was like okay we're\ngoing to collab but it's going to be\n[ __ ] awesome\nyep oh we're going to do this but if i\njust would trust\nother people to be there with me then it\nwouldn't be that way so now we come full\ncircle john\nwhy is it hard for you to put trust in\nother people\nyeah so this is why we don't blame you\nright like this is why it's unfair for\nyou to blame yourself\nbecause like there's a damn good reason\nin fact there are hundreds if not\nthousands of instances\nwhere you learned that you can't trust\nother people\nyeah they can't be relied on if she\ncheats once\nwhat's she gonna do you'll do it again\nabsolutely yep\njesus i'm like currently in my head\nlike playing every scenario where i'm\njust like nah [ __ ] i'll just do\neverything\nyep i gotta stop that [ __ ]\nbe careful okay yeah of course so do you\nwanna stop\nyes be compassionate towards yourself\nbe patient with yourself you can't undo\n28 years of programming\novernight just because you understand\nwhat the problem is\nright because like along with uh i just\ni just got to do this [ __ ] myself\nthere's also the like like just think\nabout how hard it's going to be to like\nnot do that yep i'm not even kevin i'm\nnot even kidding with you dr k\nuh for world of warcraft from vanilla\nto i think i quit in the legion i was\nthe guild master\nand raid leader of every single guild\ni've ever been a part of and that was\neven a myth because i was just like i\n[ __ ] nobody's gonna do it better than\nme i might as well just [ __ ] do\neverything\nyep this this has been ingrained in me\nokay yep\nbecause at first because at first i was\nlike oh yo i'm [ __ ] sick look at all\nthis [ __ ] that i'm [ __ ] doing\nand then i realized oh it's i shouldn't\nhave done this i should just trust other\npeople to help me there when i need the\nhelp it's going to be a slow process\nyep you're gonna have to learn how to\ntolerate a lot of like internal\ndiscomfort in order to trust other\npeople\nyeah right it kind of goes back to like\ni can't\ni can't bear to see my friends hurt\nagain\nso that that's where like you got to\ntrust your friend\nto make the right decision for himself\nso it's going to require a lot of\ntolerance on your part patience\ntolerance and compassion for yourself\nfor them for\neveryone in the universe yeah\nand that may be tough because i don't\nknow that you were taught\nhow to like do that by your home\nsituation\nyeah right what you were taught is like\nsurvival of the fittest and the only\nperson you can rely on is yourself\nyep yeah even even thinking about what\ni'm having gonna have to do over the\nnext couple weeks months years is\nis i can already feel like the\nuneasiness of my stomach\nbut i do think well i know that it's for\nthe best\nso i i will i'm gonna give it my\ngood old college try good that's cause\nthat's gonna be brutal yeah so\ni don't think it's going to be quite as\nbad as you think it is\nbecause that's your that's your black\nand white mind\ntelling you it's going to be brutal all\nover again there are a couple of\ndifferent things here one is your black\nand white mind but that's that's okay\nlike john like you're you're a good dude\nand like as long as you care and just be\nlike patient with yourself like you'll\nget there\nyou know like you'll get there bro\ni mean i hope that would be that would\nbe pretty damn awesome\ngood i think hoping is the right thing\nto do it may not happen actually\nbut like have faith in yourself you know\ni've got faith in you\nthank you i appreciate that\nyeah thank you for this\nhello i really appreciate this welcome\njohn\nyou'd think they'd teach you this you\nknow in school\nover the the powerhouse of the cell is\nthe mitochondria\nlike teaching you some like\nuseful [ __ ] would be pretty nice oh\ngod\nyeah so that's that's our mission right\nis to teach people the stuff\nand so what i want you to think about\njohn for a second is like you came on\nhere\nyou know you took a you took a few licks\nfrom me\nyeah yeah and so what you've managed to\ndo today is like\nteach a bunch of people that are\nwatching\nbecause you're not the only one my\nfriend a lot of people in our community\ngravitate towards the lure of video\ngames because they do come from broken\nhomes\nand it's what they love right it's like\nit's like a place where\nyou know like this community can be like\nreally supportive it can be toxic but\ncan also be really supportive\nthis is sort of like like i i sometimes\nfeel like twitch has become the family\nfor people who like didn't have good\nfamilies growing up\nyep i agree the donations and the\nmessages i get where they're just like\noh hey you know had a really shitty day\nbut i can always turn on this stream and\nhave a good time i'm just like\n[ __ ] i love that but also i wish that\nwasn't the case for you\nyep that's actually a good\nthat's that's the way you want your mind\nto work right you accept their\nperspective and you can hope for\nsomething else it's good it's a very\nhealthy dialectic just\nit's like when you hold two contrary\nthoughts that\ntogether at the same time so it's not\nblack and white thinking what you just\ndid there\ndoes that make sense yes yes it's like\nit's good but it's also bad and that\nyep right so that's not black and white\nyeah\nperfect exactly so i i think uh john the\nmore that your mind starts\nstarts operating that way the better\nyour relationships will become\ni 1 billion percent agree right because\nthen it's like your girlfriend cheated\non you that's bad\nand there's like there's still something\nkeeping you in the relationship\nso the more that you understand that\nkind of stuff the more that you're able\nto like\nmeet people halfway bizarrely the other\ninteresting\nthing that'll happen is they'll start\nlistening to you more too\nyeah so when i'm trying to convince\nsomeone or when i'm trying to help\nsomeone get sober\ni don't just talk about how bad alcohol\nis that's what their partner\ndoes and it causes a divorce what i talk\nabout\nis how good it is and how bad it is\nand we we sit on both sides of that\nequation\nand that's when i really see people make\nthe like the most change\nyeah that's really smart that is very\nsmart\nso it sounds like you meditate a lot\nalmost every night\nfor hours can you tell me about that\nyeah so i have like this nightly ritual\nwhere like i'll go upstairs\nand then uh i'll turn on the water like\non to trickle down from the shower\nand like the sound of the water will\nlike kind of block out the rest of the\nnoise in my entire house\num and then i'll just be able to sit\nthere and think about what i can do\nto improve myself or or further my\ncareer\nor how to repair current relationships\nor\nwhat works in me what doesn't and i try\nvery hard to um\nto to figure that out because i took\nthis course in college called\nmovement which was like how to make the\nbody go to a neutral state to where\nit just it doesn't feel good but it\nfeels like nothing and that way your\nmind can\nlike be free to wander and all that\nuh i used to do yoga but now i'm way too\nlazy for that [ __ ]\nuh but yeah for meditation i guess i\ni don't know if meditation is the same\nthing as self-reflecting at length i\nthink it is\ni think i i wouldn't quite call it that\nbut i think that there's just\nsome amount of overlap there oh okay\nit sounds like what you're doing is i\nwould use the word contemplation\nthat's it yeah contemplation which is a\npath of\nspiritual growth but yeah\nbecause i i do try to be the best person\ni can be like the reason why\ni strive so hard to like be successful\nand like why i do what i do\nis because i've kind of like seen from\nthe past what i don't want to be and i\nthink i actually grew more from knowing\nwhat i don't want to be rather than\nknowing what i do want to be by what i\nwant to be i just know what i don't want\nto be\num and so then i kind of reflect on\nwhy certain scenarios have happened in\nmy life and how to prevent those\nscenarios from happening again\nand sometimes i think i just get a\nlittle bit too lost in the sauce up\nthere and uh\ni might go a little bit overboard with\nthe analytical because sometimes like\ni can like can't go to bed at night\nunless i play a podcast or something\nso that way because when i hear other\nvoices my brain will go blank\nlike if i don't have background noise\nthen my mind is just like\nexploding information of like different\nscenarios in my head\nif that answers your question yeah that\nthat makes a lot of sense\ni think the closest thing that you of\nyour nightly ritual which\nsounds very healthy don't get me wrong\num is actually the listening to the\nwater trickle\nthat's i would say the thing that sounds\nthe most like meditation to me\nokay so before the thought process\nstarts it sounds like you do a\nparticular practice to empty your mind\nand once it's empty then you can point\nit in a particular direction and it can\nproductively work\nin that direction that is exactly it yes\nso so i'd say the meditation process is\nis really that first part gotcha\nand and it's sort of focusing on that do\nyou um\ni'm curious do you want to learn like a\nmore formal technique\num i think i think i know the one that\nyou're talking\nit's the it's the nose one right that\none is do you know what i'm talking\nabout\nyeah i mean i could teach you that one\nbut i'm just curious about whether you\nwant to learn something today\nand it's not i would love to i was gonna\nsay i i remember the first time you ever\nshowed that technique\num i can't do that because i can only\nbreathe out of one nostril\nso i wanted to do that one that you\nshowed i can't remember how it went but\nthat is one that i wish i could do but i\ncan't because only my left nostril works\nnot my right one\num yeah so i would say uh\nlet me just think for a second about\nwhat to teach you\nsure he said i know breathing is a big\npart of everything and uh i do have\nbreathing issues\nso that's always you sound kind of\nstuffed up right now\nyeah that's how i always sound which\nsucks\nuh what are your bowel movements like\nuh before terrible like terrible\nlike i used to go like once every three\nfour days\nuh but now i'm going like twice a day so\nlike i'm trying to really take care of\nmyself currently so they're pretty good\nyou go twice a day and how what's the\nconsistency of them\nyou know i mean they're pretty good i\nmean not like\nloose or hard or anything like that no\njust good\nonce in the morning once before i go to\nbed and you have allergies\njust meant only meant but you're stuffed\nup all the time\nyeah what's your diet like\nlike what you have for a breakfast lunch\ndinner yesterday or would you eat\nyesterday\nso i was 300 pounds at the beginning of\nthis year\ni am now 276. i've changed my diet quite\ndrastically because before it was just\nmcdonald's popeyes just junk food\nbut now when i wake up i have one apple\nwith peanut butter\nuh and that holds me over till lunch and\nthen for lunch i'll generally have a\nfoot long sub from subway\nand then at night i'll have uh one\nchicken breast\nwith like one green pepper and then a\nbed of rice\nand that's pretty much what i eat every\nsingle day\nso i think your your nasal stuff will\nget better depending on your diet\nokay um let me just think a little bit\nabout\nthis for a second could i have 30\nseconds\nyeah okay real quick\na chat\nyou know what the hardest part about\nstreaming is\nlike with interviews is that i don't get\nto read chat\nso you know there's an interesting um\nsort of like diagnostic concept from\nayurveda\nthat involves like toxin production\nand um i think that's i've seen a lot of\nlike progress with like people who\nreally clean up their diet especially\nwith like upper respiratory like nasal\ncrap\ni i don't know exactly how that works\nand stuff have you seen like a doctor\nabout your\nyour nose always being stuffy uh i\nhaven't been to the doctor in about 10\nyears\num i got blood work done two days ago\nwhich was terrifying because my wife\npassed out 10 minutes after her blood\nwork\nwhich i caught her as she was falling to\nthe ground it was terrifying\nthat's what freaked me because that was\nthe first time i ever thought that my\nwife was dying\ngod it [ __ ] me up and that's the\nreason why i'm still a little bit [ __ ]\nup from it\num but i so when i was\n17 18 i decided that i needed to get\naway from my family\num and i just moved to canada and after\nabout a decade of being up here like\nnow my citizenship has like it's\nit's they've accepted my application but\nthey haven't confirmed whether i've made\nit or not so\nuntil i get accepted or not is when i\nwill go to the doctor but before that i\nwas not able to\ni would definitely recommend that you go\nsee a doctor and just you know get your\nespecially your nasal stuff checked out\nman\nyeah i agree but in terms of uh\nmeditation so like\nit seems to me like you actually would\ndo well with something called the\npratyahara technique\nso pratyahara means sensory withdrawal\nso like essentially most of the speed of\nthe flow of our thoughts\nis affected by our senses so the more\nthat our sensory\nenergy is dispersed the more chaotic our\nmind will be\nso if you kind of think about like a\nlight bulb that\nis shining light in like a thousand\ndirections\nversus a flashlight which is like\nshining it in one direction with some\nmirrors\nversus like a laser beam which is like\nhighly highly concentrated\nso like the process of getting our mind\nfrom being diffuse and\nall over the place this also has to do\nwith things like motivation for example\nbecause if you think about someone who's\nnot motivated the reason they're it's\nnot that they're not motivated it's that\ntheir\nmotivational energy is diffused in a\nthousand directions\nand we call that not motivated so\ninstead if we think about you know our\nwe have a certain amount of cognitive\nenergy that when dispersed\nover a thousand directions we call\nmotivation\ni mean sorry a lack of motivation and\nthen as we concentrate the energy of our\nmind as we turn from a light bulb to a\nflashlight\nand then ultimately from a flashlight to\na laser beam so if we talk\nyou know if we think about like casual\nlaw players versus\npro players they both actually may play\nfor\n10 hours a day but what's the difference\nit has to do with their focus\nright um so so the fact that you sort of\nlike the the technique that you talk\nabout in terms of the listening to the\nwater trickle\nis actually like a pratyahara technique\nbecause it sounds like what you do is\nyou\nyou you put your attention on one thing\nand it blocks out all of the other\nthings\nand then as you block out all of the\nother stuff your mind kind of gets\ncleaned out and then you can engage in\nsome really\nlike fruitful contemplation does that\nmake sense\nyes it does so what i would recommend to\nuse also because breathing is hard\num is a breath yahara technique that's\nprobably based on sound so what i would\nask you to do in terms of like a\nmeditation is to concentrate\non a particular sound how do you feel\nabout that\nthat sounds fantastic if there's\nsomething i can do to kind of calm my\nmind down that sounds like a great thing\nthat i would like to do\nso when you wear headphones\nand no one is talking what do you hear\nuh it feels like somebody is muffling my\nears with like\ncotton balls okay and so if if you're\nif the sound from the outside is muffled\nout\ncan you hear sounds from within your\nbody more clearly\nsound from the outside is blocked out\ncan i hear sounds inside of my body\nreally i would say yes\nokay so what we're going to do is sit up\nstraight\nokay\nokay okay and now what i'm going to ask\nyou to do is close your eyes\nthe first thing that i want you to\nnotice is the sound of your breath\njust concentrate on that sound for a\nsecond try to detect as much as you can\nsort of notice the pitch\nand now what i want you to do is listen\nfor the sound of your heartbeat\nor even feel it if that's easier\nare you able to find something yeah\ntell me what you found\nuh\ni noticed that i'm not thinking about\nliterally anything else\nokay\ni hate the fact that i'm a mouth\nbreather i know that\nuh i wish i could breathe my nose that's\nokay\nyeah and uh my heartbeat it's a lot\nfainter than what i remember i used to i\ni always thought it was super loud\nokay powerful but it's actually quite\nit's actually quite quiet\nwhich i wasn't expecting okay so\nlisten carefully for it\nthe other thing that i want you to\nappreciate john\nis that all heartbeats are by definition\nco-op can you can you hear the\nco-op-ness of your heartbeat\nis it like the buddha dump can you hear\nthat\ni i feel like i can but i can't tell if\nit's my mind telling me that i know that\nit's gonna sound like that\nor if i am hearing it it's very hard to\ndifferentiate it\nokay good so that means you're doing the\npractice right\nso meditation is about evolving your\nsubtle awareness\nand this is what i will tell you when\nyou can securely\nand confidently feel the co-op-ness of\nthe heartbeat\nyour relationships will improve\nright now all you hear is one sound\nyou know there should be two but as you\nget better at this practice and as you\nhear\nboth parts of the sound as you start to\nhear the dance\nas you start to hear the duality of it\nas you sit with that kind of i know\nwe're talking about like\nunderstanding lane pressure now so it's\ngoing to be abstract and cannot be\ntransmitted\nit's not something i can teach you but\nit's only it's something that can only\nbe understood\nso as you listen for it if you do this\npractice for a while and you begin to\nactually be able to hear the concert\nof two sounds your relationships will\nstart to get better as well\nokay so listen\nit's a pratyahara practice so pratyahara\nmeans sensory deprivation that's\nor sensory withdrawal it's a class of\npractices\ni don't know that this particular\npractice has a name because i sort of\nmade it up just now okay that's good to\nme\nyeah right so there are a couple of\ndifferent levels on which this practice\nworks it also has to do with the anahat\nchakra\nso the anahat chakra is the heart chakra\nand generally speaking people who have\ntrouble with like compassion\nand things like that doing heart\noriented practices seems to work\nokay um there's another set of practices\nwhich are\nspecifically geared towards improving\nrelationships but i don't\ni think that you don't actually need to\nimprove relationships this is like more\ninternal you need to be able to see the\nother person in the relationship\nand right now it's almost like iconic\nthat when you do this practice you know\nwhat should be there but you can only\nsee one dimension of it\nokay and so you need to be able to see\nboth of those and that this practice\nwill help you subtly detect that\nokay okay\noh yeah my bad with my cat sending you\nmessages right now she was sitting on\nthe keyboard while my eyes are closed i\ndidn't notice\nit's fine okay um\nany any last thoughts or questions\nbefore we wrap up for the day\nuh i i think i am now a lot better than\nwhere i was this morning so i think i'm\ni think i'm i wanna i wanna be able to\nabsorb all this\nbefore i try to take on anything else so\ni think i'm absolutely great\nokay fantastic i'm i'm really happy to\nhear that that's why we're here\nso thanks for coming today do you wanna\njust tell people a little bit about\nwhere they can find you if they're\ninterested in watching your streams and\nstuff\noh just twitch.dv forward slash tech\ntone\nt-e-c-t-o-n-e right and you it sounds\nlike you do most\nmostly gaming and like particular games\nor most against you know\nwhat i i do uh variety i do some games\nand uh\nmainly it's just building my chat just\ntrying to make sure my chat's good i do\na lot of checking my chats and try to\nlisten to their problems and see if i\ncan give any advice\nthat's awesome what i try to do because\nmy computer means everything\nawesome man well thank you so much for\ncoming and good luck\nwith everything you know be careful\nabout the self-judgment be patient\nand make space for other people man\nyou're lifting too much for too long\nyeah i will try to relax\nin a lot of aspects of life\nyeah all right take care man you too\nthank you so much\nyou're welcome bye bye\nyeah seems like a good dude"
