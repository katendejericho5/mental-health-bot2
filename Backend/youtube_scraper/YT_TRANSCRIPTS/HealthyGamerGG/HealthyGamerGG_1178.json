    "transcript": "and tomorrow do i want to be someone\nthat gets their feeling of being\nconnected and whole through a parasocial\nrelationship\nor through a real-life relationship who\ndo i want to be\nhello my twitch edition i'm assuming\nthis is addiction\nit's tearing me apart hello i just want\nto share with you my daily structure\nstruggles with my twitch and gaming\naddiction since i was eight years old\ni've been watching\nhow other people play video games from a\nlocal tv show wow dude that's dope\ni'm an introvert and i have social and\ncommunication problems very shy etc and\nnow i'm 19.\ni can literally watch twitch all day\nlong\ni have my favorite streamers and in my\nworst times i can feel pretty bad if i\nmiss a live oh interesting\nit's like i'm missing something\nimportant the bonds are too strong the\nbonds that i don't have with my\nirl friends i feel like all my social\nneeds are covered when i watch these\nstreamers talking to me\ni love to be passive i don't really have\nto talk to anyone at the\nsame time i feel surrounded by people i\ndon't like using the chat\ni don't meet new people i know it's not\na healthy relation\nthe one i have with twitch i'm a\nfreelance and i work\nfrom home i set up my own schedule and\nif i have too much work i start to feel\nreally anxious\nwhen i don't have time to watch streams\ni stop working if necessary and miss my\ndeadlines\ni don't like weekends because i i have\nto make plans with irl people and i feel\nlike i'm losing time i could spend\nwatching my favorite streamer\num when i look back all the time spent\nwatching streams really\nuh worth nothing but when i watch the\nstreams i feel really good\nas you may think i feel pretty uh\ndepressed and\nwhen not watching streams i'm losing\nreal friends and experiences\ni have a huge lack of motivation for\nanything not twitch related\ni'm also unable to make friends on this\nplatform to get\nsomething good out of it this is like\nthe third time i realized this is going\ntoo far\ni'm starting to a detox plan to switch\ngears and get back on track again\ni'm super anxious just thinking about it\nif you have been in a similar situation\ni'd love to hear what you did to get\nbetter\nthanks for reading okay all right so\nthis is a fantastic post\num you know i'm it's unfortunate that\nthis person is struggling this much but\nthere are a lot of really good things\nhere okay\nprops to you for making the post\nright so like we've got to be careful\nbecause when we feel like we're making a\nmistake in life\nour mind will do anything to convince us\nthat we're making a mistake in life\nit'll try to keep you there so this is\ntricky\nbut there's a part of this person's mind\nthat i would bet\nmoney was like don't make this post it's\na waste of your time no one's gonna be\nable to help you\nyou can figure it out on your own or if\nyou can't figure it out no one can\nfigure it out for you\ndon't bother there's the part of your\nmind that says don't bother\nso first thing that i want to commend\nthis person for is actually making the\npost\nbecause they're stepping outside of\ntheir comfort zone they're asking for\nhelp they're being a little bit\nopen-minded\nthey're noticing that this is a problem\nthey're accepting that's a problem\nthey're telling the whole internet that\nit's a problem\nthey're owning it right that's the first\nstep\nexcept that you have a problem so good\njob op\na couple of other things to note okay\nso second thing is like let's talk about\nlike psychology neuroscience and\ndevelopment uh\ncognitive development so this person has\nbeen watching video games since the age\nof eight and they're now like in their\nlate twenties right\nso what this means is that the parts of\nyour brain that\nenjoy social interaction are capable of\nof social interaction\nand like get satisfied from real life\ninteractions\nare like kind of rusty like your brain\nhas evolved to get\nsocial needs met through twitch so this\nis going to sound kind of weird but\nthere is something that i see\nunfortunately a lot is a psychiatrist\ncalled death grip syndrome\nwhich is when people masturbate for a\nlong period of time like\nyears and then when they actually have\nsex for the first time they're not\nactually\nable to like achieve climax through\nsexual intercourse\nand it's because they've like physically\ntrained their body to\nclimax in a particular kind of\nstimulation\nand so it just takes time to like rewire\nyour neurons to get satisfied from this\nother kind of pleasure\nand the weird thing that i i've been\nseeing is like that's not it's not just\nphysical it's just the example that i\nuse because it\nseems to relate to people but our it can\nbe anything that our body acclimatizes\nto right so if we're kind of thinking\nabout\nyou know even like my tolerance for\nspicy foods if i grew up not eating\nspicy foods it's going to be hard for me\nto tolerate\num uh you know eating spicy foods\nin that same way so your brain has\nlearned to\nlike receive social satisfaction from\ntwitch\nso cognitively you've developed that way\nyou've developed with parasocial\nrelationships so they feel more\nsatisfying to you\nnow thousands of years from now people\nmay sort of philosophically debate or\neven today\nabout whether online social\nrelationships are better or not better\nmaybe it's like a current judgment that\nour society holds\ni don't know but for now if you want to\nengage more in the real world and you\nplace more value on that\nrecognize that it's going to take some\ntime for your brain to adapt\nto real-world relationships okay so it's\njust going to take some time\nso put yourself out there go into each\nof those social interactions\nrecognizing that this is going to be\nharder for me i'm not going to enjoy it\nas much\nand it is one step towards the life that\ni want to live\nand that's key right so here's the big\nthing to remember\nwhether things are easy or hard think\nabout your dharma what's my duty what am\ni doing this for\nso i'm doing this because on some level\ni find these twitch relationships to be\ninsufficient\nso today let's say your friends want to\nmake plans with you right so they're\ncalling you like hey do you want to hang\nout on friday there's a part of you\nthat's like i'm going to miss the stream\nso just think for a second pause for a\nsecond and ask yourself\nyou know who do i want to be tomorrow\nlike am i going to miss the stream\nabsolutely am i going to have less fun\nin real life absolutely\nam i going to love being here and\nwatching the streamer live absolutely\nam i going to feel connected and whole\nby being on twitch\nabsolutely and tomorrow do i want to be\nsomeone that gets their feeling of being\nconnected and whole\nthrough a parasocial relationship or\nthrough a real life relationship\nwho do i want to be it's not about what\nyou get\nit's about what you want to be and as\nyou navigate that as you reflect on that\nyou'll start to gravitate towards real\nlife\nthe last thing to kind of consider is\nthat this person\nsays that they have a huge lack of\nmotivation so we're going to highlight a\ncouple of things in their text okay\nso i feel pretty depressed i have a huge\nlack of\nmotivation and for anything not twitch\nrelated this is actually a great\nsentence\nbecause the last thing that you need to\ndo to really crack this\nopen is this feeling\ni feel pretty bad if i miss a live\nstream\nwhy what is it that you feel like you're\nmissing\nyou know like and this is where i i\nreally i really encourage this person to\nstop and really\nthink about what is it that they're\nmissing\nby missing the stream and really like\nunderstand because i suspect that\nthere's something else there\nthat we're um that\nis like there's something under the\nsurface this this feels like a some scar\nto me let me just read this again\ni in my worst times i can feel pretty\nbad if i miss something live\nso i'd start by asking yourself the\nquestion like what are you missing and\nhave you missed something live before\nand what did you feel like because what\nwhat this person\nis is telling me here is that something\nbad happened\nthat they missed live and so the reason\nthey need to watch is because they don't\nwant that to happen again\nthey don't want to miss out again this\nis the hurt of missing out once\nresurfacing so your brain is telling you\nhey if you skip this stream\nyou're going to miss out again right so\nlike you got to be careful about where\nthat\nwhat's missing what what do you lose by\nby not watching something\nso i start to feel anxious when i feel\nlike i won't have time to\nto watch streams there it is again right\nwhat are you anxious about what is it\nthat you're truly missing\ni stop working if necessary and miss my\ndeadline so you're really getting\nsomething out of this right what is it\nthat you're really getting\nwhat is it that you're missing if you\ndon't watch the stream and and this also\nlike i i would i would ask yourself you\nknow what do you what are you\nwhat's the hunger that's being fulfilled\nby watching the stream\nbecause this kind of goes back to this\nidea that like you know you're getting\nsome\nneed met right so the reason that\nbehaviors are reinforced is because\nthey're doing something for us\nso i would really think long and hard\nabout like what is this behavior doing\nfor me\nwhat is it that i'm really missing and\ndon't don't listen to your logic your\nlogic is telling you oh you're not\nmissing anything they're gonna be a\nthousand of other streams like oh\nlike you're stupid like don't worry\nabout missing it like there's nothing to\nmiss like it's empty\nthat's not gonna help right because if\nyou tell yourself that the emotional\nneed is like not\ndoesn't care about that logic it's going\nto get its needs met\nso the question is to really like ask\nyourself and pay attention to what are\nyou missing\nyou know what's the cost of this why is\nit that you don't want to pay that cost\nwhen have you paid that cost before and\nwhen did you\nlearn that streams are not missable\nhow did you discover that like this is\nsomething that my life revolves around\nand you have to be really authentic with\nyourself and explore that\nabsolutely something that i think a\ncoach could help you with by the way\ni mean is there something clinical here\ncan you see a therapist sure\nbut i i think we've just heard so many\nbad stories in this community about\nyou know people going to see therapists\nand them saying like i'm addicted to\ntwitch and the therapist is like\njust watch less bro you know i'm not\ntrying to\ni know there are a lot of therapists out\nthere who are getting wise real quick\nbut\nit's the kind of thing where you know\nsomeone made like i mean i have\ncolleagues that would\ndiagnose you with depression and start\nyou on an ssri and send you home\nwe've heard that story a thousand times\nin this community i'm not saying that\nyou shouldn't by all means go get\nevaluated because\nthere's other confounding factors right\nmaybe you do have depression\nand so that's worth absolutely getting\nchecked out and at the same time i\nreally try to find someone\neither yourself or someone else who can\nhelp you kind of work through this stuff"
