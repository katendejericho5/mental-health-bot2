    "transcript": "so if we think about why we get addicted\nto video games or substances\nit's the inability to tolerate a\nnegative emotion\nso sitting within a negative emotion is\nthe first step of every unwanted action\nso reward it\nso if you don't get out of bed because\nit is very uncomfortable\nvery comfortable sitting with this\nuncomfortable feeling should be your\nfirst goal\ntell yourself hey this is exactly what i\nwanted i wanted to feel this\nuncomfortable feeling so i can be proud\nof myself that i did it\nif you listen to this talk between lex\nfriedman and andrew huberman\ntalking about david goggins you can get\nan idea of why this could help you\novercome the action blockage from those\nnegative emotions quick summary though i\ndon't know if it's 100\ncorrect the idea is that when you have\nthis mental friction from the negative\nemotion your body naturally wants to\nstay still\nrun away from this threat by rewarding\nyourself with sanding this emotion\nthe dopamine that is released helps to\nturn down this mental friction\nwhich will then ease up the way towards\naction\nyeah so i think that\nthere's some good stuff here\nbut there are some\n[Music]\nproblems here too so i\ncompletely agree that sitting with a\nnegative emotion\nis a very important step towards moving\nin the right direction\ni think i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut like i think you guys have to be\ncareful about this too\nlike this is the challenge right is it's\nhard to actually like\nchoose what you reward yourself with\nright so if i were to say like\ni should just reward myself for drinking\nwater instead of drinking soda\nlike that's not actually how dopamine\nworks\nright like i can tell myself that this\nlike this this this is really tricky\nbecause like i can tell myself like\ntell yourself hey this is exactly what i\nwanted\nbut this is not actually sitting with\nsomething\nbecause that's not actually\nauthentically how you feel\nright so telling yourself something is\nnot actually being authentic\nsure like it can be you can you can have\nsome amount of benefit from doing this\ndon't get me wrong there's just a couple\nof things here which i think are sort of\nnuanced\nand it's the tell yourself part that i\nthink that\nyou have to be careful about because\ntelling yourself something won't\nactually release a dopamine hit\nright it's like like i remember many\nyears ago\ni used to hate going to amusement parks\nso i stopped going for like a decade and\nthen like\ni i was you know once i got together\nwith my wife she really liked them\nand so i was like oh like i'll just you\nknow like i'll just get over it\nso i went on roller coasters found the\nexperience to be like\nmind numbingly unpleasant like i just\ndon't enjoy being on a roller coaster\nand i was like i'll get used to it i'll\nget used to it i'll get used to it try\nto enjoy it\nso i use like all my yoga training to go\nlike back on the roller coaster again\nand again and again and again so\nconquered my fear\ntried to enjoy it and then i sort of\nrealized like the more i used like the\nyogic training i just sat down after my\nlike seventh roller coaster of the day\nand i was like\nyou know what i just don't enjoy this\nand i actually\ndon't need to enjoy it like i don't have\nto convince myself\nthat this is fun so i think it's really\nchallenging when you guys set a standard\nfor yourself\nto like use tell yourself that you enjoy\nsomething\nand then rely on like the dopamine hit\nto motivate your action\nbecause that may not work and then where\nare you like do you just try yours to\ntell yourself more like this reminds me\na little bit of like the power of\npositive thinkers it's just to tell\nyourself man just tell yourself tell\nyourself that you enjoy this\ntell yourself that this is good so i\nthink learning how to talk to yourself\nin a healthy way is absolutely\nwonderful don't get me wrong like it's\ngood to tell yourself nice compassionate\nthings\nso telling yourself has a space noticing\nyour unwanted emotions and learning how\nto sit with your unwanted emotions\nis absolutely very very important\nit's the translation of this that\nsometimes i kind of disagree with\nbecause in my experience the goal of\nsitting with unwanted emotions is not\nthe first step\nto right action it's the first step to\nconquering wrong action so if we think\nabout\nwhy we get addicted to video games or\nsubstances\nit's the inability to tolerate a\nnegative emotion\ni feel ashamed of myself so let me go\nplay some dota and then i can forget\nabout the shame\ni feel anxious in a social setting so\nlet me get\nhigh first so that like i can enjoy\nsocial feelings\ni work with people who have marijuana\naddiction and like the most\ndevastating and hardest marijuana\naddiction to kick\nis diagnosed this way and it is\nwhen i smoke marijuana i feel the way\nthat other people look\ni feel normal other people are living\nnormal lives\nand i'm not living a normal life and if\ni take marijuana i get\naccess for a few hours to a normal life\nthat is the hardest addiction to kick so\nin my experience\nshould you learn how to sit with a\nnegative emotion absolutely\nbut be careful because when you start\ntelling yourself things\nor forcing yourself to believe a\nparticular thing that's actually where i\nthink you go wrong\nbecause what i what i try to help people\ndo is like sit with the negative emotion\nabsolutely\nbut don't let the negative emotion\ncontrol your behavior don't convince\nyourself\notherwise actually accept that this i\nabsolutely sit with the negative emotion\nbut don't give in to it\nright don't give in to the behavior that\nfollows the negative emotion\nand that's when i say just don't give in\nto it that's where the process of not\ngiving into it this is my problem with a\nlot of the like\nyou know these like analyses is like no\none gives you a process\nand they tell you the goal they say\nnotice your negative emotions tell\nyourself this they don't like and it\nsort of sounds like a process but like\nwhat's the real process the real process\nis going to be painful\nthat as you notice the negative emotion\nthat is actually going to mechanically\ndisable its energy a little bit and then\nnotice what happens when you give into\nit and notice what happens when you\ndon't give in to it\nwhich you are you happier to be\nand noticing is just the first step\nright like awareness precedes control\ngood diagnosis precedes good treatment\nso you should absolutely notice your\nunwanted actions i mean unwanted\nemotions and learn how to sit with them\nbut the goal is not to transform them\ninto something that you enjoy\nbecause you may not be able to do that\ndon't rely on that the goal is to not\nlet them control you you should be in\ncontrol of them\nand your behaviors should not be\ndictated by unwanted emotions\nhow do you not give in you start by\nnoticing and i know it sounds kind of\nweird but we can\ndo this i'll give you guys like a\nmeditation practice like now okay\ni want you guys to take a food that\nyou dislike and try eating it\nbut do it with a hundred percent\nawareness don't watch anything\ndon't read anything don't listen to an\naudiobook sit there with the food and\ntake one bite\nof the food that you dislike it doesn't\nhave to be your least favorite fruit\njust something you're not a big fan of\nlike try to be like relatively neutral\nand just notice what happens to your\nability to eat it\nas you eat it with full awareness does\nit become easier to eat or harder\nto eat it's kind of weird right so\nsomeone says pineapple on pizza\nthe great divide right so if you guys we\ncould talk about privilege and\nand you know socioeconomic stuff as much\nas you guys want to\nwhy we really want to get people upset\nwe'll talk about whether pineapple\nbelongs on pizza or not\nokay just notice what happens\nwith your discomfort and then see how\nthe discomfort that you have full\nobservation of\naffects your behavior down the road does\nit make it easier to eat it or harder to\neat it\nand that will be your answer"
