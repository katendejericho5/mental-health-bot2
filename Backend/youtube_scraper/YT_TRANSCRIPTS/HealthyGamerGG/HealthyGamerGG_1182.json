    "transcript": "really like to talk to dr k about\nexecutive dysfunction and how to conquer\nit\nas it has been the most crippling effect\ncaused by my mental illness and has\nessentially made life\nprogress progress near impossible in\nmany respects\nand yet this is a topic that seems to go\noften untalked about in any sort\nof detail especially in any sort of\nsolutionary\nrespect i've even struggled to get my\ntherapist to talk about it with me\nperhaps that is because i have also\nfound that those who don't\ndeal with this issue have an especially\ndifficult time understanding it as well\nit is hard for them to grasp the idea of\nfeeling\nlike you are literally unable to force\nyourself to take an action\nand i get it because i deal with it\nevery day and i still\nfind it hard to understand how it can be\nthis way i too often wonder why can't i\njust do it like everybody else from my\npoint of view it is a bad enough\nhaving to battle my mind but it is\ntorturous not being able to hardly ever\njust get myself to do some sort of work\nor even a fun hobby\nto help myself through it on top of that\nand it is very hard for me to find\npurpose in myself\nor work on other parts of my life and\nmental health\nas well when i can't actually manage\nto hardly get myself to do simple or\neven fun tasks\nlet alone those more important\npurposeful ones\nso basically it feels like i'm\nconstantly stuck in a solitary prison\nand given nothing to do other than sit\nand look out through the bars to see all\nthe things that i enjoy and want\nneed to take part in but can't okay this\nis a great question\nso the first question is what is\nexecutive dysfunction\nwe have a part of our brain called the\nfrontal lobes\nwhich plan and execute tasks okay\nso what this means is that the example\nthat we're going to use to\nexplain executive dysfunction is i have\na three-year-old and i have a\nfive-year-old\nif i tell my five-year-old to clean up\nthe room she can do it\nif i tell my three-year-old to clean up\nthe room\nshe's gonna feel like she just can't do\nit right so then what i have to do is i\nhave to tell my three-year-old okay\nlet's put the books away and the\nthree-year-old can do that i can tell\nlet's put the toys away but she can do\nthat let's put the stuffed animals away\nshe can do that she can put the ipad\naway she can put the controller away she\ncan put her bowl away\nbut she needs me to structure those\ntasks together to take like to reach an\nabstract goal okay so executive function\nis the ability to plan and execute tasks\nso if i think about something like\nfinding a job\nthat requires a lot of executive\nfunction right\nso it requires me to think about okay\nlike what are the steps involved and\nexecute on those tasks\nso the first thing to understand about\nexecutive function is that\nit improves with age and your executive\nfunction kind of\nuh you know reaches its full potential\nit's somewhere between\nthe age ages of 30 and 32 and this has\nto do with frontal lobe development\nso the first issue for this person is\ndepending on how old you are\nthings may get better for you as you get\nolder\ni'm not saying that it's sufficient now\nlike you can't really bank on that right\nlike you can't like\nif you're a high school student with\npoor executive function\nyou can't wait until you're 30 to do\nhigh school\nso that's the first thing just to\nreassure you guys that you will get\nbetter at this\nover time until the age of 30 to 32. the\nsecond thing that i found is that\nexecutive function tends to get\nnegatively impacted by playing video\ngames\ni know it sounds kind of weird but if\nyou spend a lot of time playing video\ngames\nwhat video games essentially do is like\ndo the executive function for you okay i\nknow it sounds weird but like think\nabout this so i've been playing genji\nimpact recently right so like i don't\nhave\nthe the game sort of tells me what i\nneed to do like if you play world of\nwarcraft or genji\nimpact or whatever i don't have to plan\nout i mean sort of people do in genshin\nimpact but\nyou know if you play a particular video\ngame the game tells you okay the next\nstep you need to do is this the next\nstep you need to do is this the next\nstep you need to do is this\nlike if i if i take ff7 for example like\nff7 doesn't start off in the first 10\nminutes and say\nhey beat sephiroth and then you have to\nconstruct\nhow to get from where you are to like\nbeat sephiroth at the end\nsure you know he's the bad guy and you\nknow he's the end goal but\ngideo video games give you the steps\nokay\nso the problem that people with\nexecutive function have or dysfunction\nhave\nis that they don't they're not their\nbrains are not able to\nplan out and execute each step of the\ntask\nso if we think about like you know\nplanning and execution\nwhat someone with a good executive\nfunction can do is like plan out the\nsteps they understand that okay if i\nneed to clean my room\nthese are the six things that need to\nhappen so what people\nwith executive function experience is\nparalysis\naround goals so what that means is like\nthey know\nlike the three-year-old theoretically\nknows\nwhat a clean room looks like and if i\nask her like what in the room looks\ndirty she can tell me that\nso what's really frustrating about\npeople with executive dysfunction\nis that they're they have insight\ninto um\ntheir dysfunction but what's incredibly\nfrustrating about this is that despite\nthe insight\nit doesn't actually change your brain\nand allow your brain to actually do it\nso you like the three-year-old can\nunderstand what a clean room looks like\ncan understand that her room is dirty\nbut that\nabstract level understanding is not the\nsame\nas the frontal lobes being able to chunk\ndown that task\nso really what executive function is is\nthe ability to take one task and like\nchunk it into pieces right so when i\nplan and execute like here's find a job\nor clean a room and it's it's being able\nlike this process\nis what's messed up with executive\ndysfunction\nokay and understanding it insight into\nit\nis not the same it's the ability to like\nthink through what\nwhat to do so another example is like\nyou know sometimes we'll have like let's\nsay like you're having you're hosting a\nparty\nso people who have like people who are\nevent planners\nhave really good executive dis uh\nfunction so like\nthey like plan out this big task let's\nthrow a wedding this has to get done\nthis has to get done this has to get\ndone this has to get done so they're\nvery good\nlike very organized so the problem with\nexecutive dysfunction is that we\naren't able to like figure out how to\nchunk up a task and execute on it\nand it feels incredibly paralyzing\nbecause our brain is\nliterally not able to do this so if we\nthink about how you know how do you\nstart on a task that's too big\nyou can't so this is why people feel\nparalyzed because if the task is too big\nyou literally cannot do it\nlike i can't like if i were to tell you\nyou know\nwin a nobel prize like\nhow do you even start with that like\nthat's crazy like you may be able to\ntheoretically map out what needs to be\ndone but you can't actually break it\napart\ninto like it's subsequent pieces and\nactually execute on it\nso then the question is what to do about\nexecutive function\nabout executive dysfunction actually and\nthis is where there are a couple of\nthings to recognize\nso when people um\nhave paralysis and executive dysfunction\nthere are a couple of different\ncomponents\nso when you're paralyzed towards a\nbehavior there are\nthree things that i'd like to talk about\nthe first is operationalize\nso what this means is like there's\nactually a formal process that you can\nget\ntrained in to do this\nso this is what we call operationalizing\nproblems\num in in gamer terminology so like back\nwhen we did\na lot of work with gamers i know we\nstill do a lot of work with gamers but i\nused to\ndo a lot of work specifically around\nvideo game addiction and what i would\nteach people is how to\nchange an open-ended problem so this is\nsomething like win nobel prize or find a\njob\ninto a close-ended problem so what that\nmeans is to essentially\ngo through the process of converting an\nabstract thing\ninto like a discrete quest goal so like\nforget about the quest\nchain we're gonna like because we can't\nmap out the quest chain so or\nactually what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take a goal and we're gonna map it\non to what we call a quest\nchain and then the quest chain will have\ndiscrete pieces\nso this is called operationalizing\nproblems which gamers\nare bad at the really interesting thing\nis that gamers are actually better than\nthe average population\nat this piece so if you give a gamer a\nvery discreet task\nand you give them an end goal and you\ngive them all the pieces\nthey will actually outperform regular\npeople when it comes to doing that task\nso this is a real scenario okay i was\ntaking a class at harvard business\nschool\nand in the in the class at harvard\nbusiness school we were given a case and\nwe were told to solve this problem\nabout how to optimize flow through a\nurology clinic\nliterally i was swamped at the time so i\nlogged onto discord and i was like hey\ndo you guys want to help me with this\nand i just uploaded this\nharvard business school case to group of\nmy degenerate gamer friends\nand the next day they like came up with\nlike four or five solutions i went into\nclass two days later\ni had the solutions for my gamer buddies\nand they're like how what do you do and\ni was like hey this is what i'm going to\ndo and the professor is like that's\nbrilliant no understanding of medicine\nno understanding of mba stuff no\nunderstanding of any of that crap\nif you give them a close-ended task and\ngive them the parameters\ngamers are good at this gamers are bad\nat this so if you have a problem with\nexecutive dysfunction the first thing\nthat you need to do\nis learn how to turn this into this so\nthat's called\noperationalizing problems there's a\nthere's a actually an exercise that we\nshare in dr k's guide so we talk a lot\nabout this in dr k's guide but i'll\nshare the exercise with you now so this\nis what i tell people who have\num executive dysfunction like as a\ntherapist\nwhat i'll say is pretend you are\nparalyzed from the the neck down\nand pretend you have a servant who will\ndo exactly what you tell them to do\nwhat would you how would you tell them\nto like accomplish this task\nso in the terms of like finding a job\nit's like you're paralyzed you like\nliterally have to tell them\ngo to my computer log in open a web\nbrowser\ndo a google search for jobs available\nin you know washington dc\nwhat do you see there okay then do this\nthen do this then do this\nand what i find with with people who\nhave executive dysfunction is that when\nyou really like work them through that\nprocess\nthey will actually be able to like\nexecute on tasks so the first thing is\noperationalizing problems\nsecond problem with executive\ndysfunction is frustration\nand emotions a lot of people with\nexecutive dysfunction\nalso have adhd or the other way around\nso people with adhd have trouble like\nwith executive\nfunction okay so this is the really\ninteresting thing is that i find that\nwhen you're\nparalyzed towards behavior there's like\na practical component to it\nbut there's also this component of like\nfeeling so\ndamn dumb and feeling so damn\nincompetent and frustrated with yourself\nthat it actually negatively impacts your\nbehavior because if we think about like\nwhat\npromotes behavior right so like it's not\nfrustration and negative emotion\nit's like inspiration and confidence so\nwhat people with executive dysfunction\nliterally have to do in order to improve\ntheir dysfunction\nis digest these emotions so we'll do\ntherapy around this\nbecause any time you're thinking about\ntaking a behavior right like so\nif i have an idea and then i want to\ntake an action\nwhat goes in here what is this composed\nof it's composed of\noperationalizing and then there's going\nto be like\nthere's going to be good emotions and\nthere's going to be\nbad emotions right so there's like a war\nbetween my good emotions and my bad\nemotions\nin terms of whether i take the action or\nnot if i think i'm going to fail if like\nyou know if i think i'm good at it like\nif i feel confident then i'll take the\naction\nso that those are a couple of pieces\nthat go into it okay\nso we're paralyzed towards the behavior\nwe have to learn how to operationalize\nwe have to learn how to like deal with\nour negative\nemotions and frustration i think\ngenerally speaking i just do two things\nwith them so we tend to get to\nprocessing their negative emotions and\nthen we operationalize problems\nand we use that exercise and that tends\nto be actually like the way that you\ndeal with executive\ndysfunction and the third thing to to\nremember is that over time\nyou will actually improve okay\nyeah so people are talking about\nmeditation absolutely so you can also do\nmeditation\nright so the uh it's that's good thank\nyou chat\nsee chad is learning so if we talk about\nstrengthening your frontal lobes\nmeditation actually strength\nstrengthens your mpfc your medial\nprefrontal cortex\nwhich is going to be like a big part of\nwhat we want to talk about when it comes\nto\noperationalizing problems i think\nanother thing that we want to\ntalk a little bit about is you have to\nbe careful about\nthe thoughts that keep you from starting\nso this is also like another cognitive\nskill that you can learn so anytime\nsomeone has this is related to the\nemotions but like\nif you think about problems with\noperationalizing like this is where the\nwhat-ifs happen right we were talking\nabout the what-ifs earlier\nwhat if you know\nso a lot of thoughts that keep you from\nstarting this kind of has to do a little\nbit with like procrastination so\nsometimes like\nyou know perfection can actually keep\nyou paralyzed as well like you want to\ndo it perfect\nyou don't want to like get a b so you're\nnot even gonna try for\nuntil you're sure you can get an a\nyou're not even gonna you'd rather have\nan\nf than a 10 or 90 chance for an a\nright you want a 100 chance of an a or\nan f\nso this is where there are particular\nlike psychological complexes or\ncognitive things which you can actually\nwork on\nthese are almost like some scars so we\ntalk about a couple of these in dr k's\nguides\ni'll try to you know map more stuff out\nbut when it comes to\nsolving executive dysfunction it gets\nbetter with time you have to learn how\nto operationalize\nwhich you can practically do deal with\nthe negative emotions that keep you from\nacting\nyou can absolutely meditate and then the\nfourth thing is that\nyou know there are particular thoughts\nthere are particular other\nchallenges that arise which have\nspecific solutions to them\nquestions about executive function does\nit degrade after the age of 32 not\nreally\nis it different from motivational issues\nno so so here's the problem there's no\nsanskrit word for motivation\nso motivation i think is one of the\nworst words in the english language\nbecause\nit lumps together all of these\ndisparate processes under like one term\nit's like and so the problem like if you\nlook at like solutions to motivation\nlike if you do\na google search for like solutions to\nmotivation you will find\na million websites with a bunch of\npeople who will\nsell you their product for like how to\nget more motivated and we're guilty of\nthat too\nthe problem is like if they're all these\nsolutions to motivation like\nwhy isn't everyone super motivated none\nof them work why don't they work because\nit's a problem of misdiagnosis\nmotivational problems could be adhd it\ncould be executive\ndysfunction it could be trauma it could\nbe like a lack of clarity of goal it\ncould be that\nyou're not motivated because it's\nsomething you should do instead of\nsomething that you care about\nthere are all kinds of like nuances to\nmotivation it's actually a\na bunch of different neuroscientific\npsychological\nand spiritual problems and the way that\ni help motivate people is because like i\ndon't call it motivation it's like\nwhat's your actual problem\nso you could look at someone with\nexecutive dysfunction you could say this\nproblem has a problem this person has a\nproblem with motivation\nbut they're absolutely they can't act\nwhen they want to act right that's what\nmotivation is\nbut if you look at it like their actual\nproblem is not\na lack of motivation that's a symptom\ntheir problem\nis is executive dysfunction and so in\nthat way\na lack of motivation has a differential\ndiagnosis\nthat includes a lot of different things\nyou"
