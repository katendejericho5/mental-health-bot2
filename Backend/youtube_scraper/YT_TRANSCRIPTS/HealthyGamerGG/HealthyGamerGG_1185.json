    "transcript": "and so then when i ask you the question\nlike is your dad proud of you and you're\nlike i don't know what difference that\nwould make dude it's going to make all\nthe difference\ni think i'd know how to process that\neven if he did\nsay it you're damn right you don't which\nis the entire problem\nright because like how do you process\nthat which you've never heard before\nuh yeah oh hey hey man\nyeah that um last interview was march of\nlast year\nactually okay so so and we are following\nup with you right i have the right\nasriel\nyes okay yeah so i was gonna say like\nnow that i i see the face i remember so\nwe talked about\nsocial anxiety or something or\nconfidence\ni think we talked about overthinking\nokay\nso you know when i have to do something\nand then like i'll generate all these\nthoughts about what could go wrong\nokay so can you fill us in a little bit\nabout um\nin a little bit more detail about what\nwe covered last week\ni mean last our last year\num i don't know it's a long time ago\ni think we talked a lot about sort of\nsuccess and failure\nand like feeling destined to succeed or\nfail\nokay um there was\ni don't know okay so tell us\nhow have you been over the last year and\na half it's been about 15 months right\nsomething like that um i don't know\nthere's been a lot that's going on\nso i've done coaching okay and i\nyou know i think i mentioned last stream\nthat like i was switching majors to\nphysics\ni ended up dropping out of physics and\nswitching back to marine biology\nokay and then with the help of the\ntherapist\ni actually managed to finish second year\na few months ago okay and\ni got back into coaching a few months\nago in the high performance group\nokay cool so so it sounds like you've\nbeen and how do you feel about\nhow do you feel about stuff\num so it was definitely\nvery rough in the beginning i think i\nlike like just so much has happened that\ni'm definitely feeling a lot better now\nthan i was\num i don't know it's i've been focusing\na lot on self-improvement and just\ngetting better\nand improving myself and you know\nfeeling my emotions and trying to\nyou know take action in my life so\nthat's for you man yeah so\nthis you want to say something go ahead\num yeah so i'm kind of if i remember\nbecause it has been a while\num i if i remember correctly you were\nvery\nexternally concerned like your mind\nwould think about what would happen\nyeah right so like you can do\ndoes that ring i mean can you share with\nus because like remind me a little bit\nif you remember because i know it's been\nlike over a year but\nlike if i'm just remembering like notes\nof the conversation about like\nyou know you'd be concerned that this\nwould happen and it wouldn't go well and\nlike you may not do well and things like\nthat\nyeah um sort of like i'm very i was very\noutcome oriented where it was like\nyou know i'm trying to put my best\nquality\nwork and like i got to do my best and\neverything\nand um\nyeah so i think there's a lot of anxiety\nthat i can build up\nabout doing a particular task and making\nit\nyou know work and something that i can\nbe proud of um i think there is a lot of\nfear\naround how other people perceive me if i\nmess up or fail\num so i have social anxiety as well\num not online it's only like in real\nlife which is\ninteresting so okay\num and and so has that changed for you\nat all asriel about being\noutcome oriented or\nyeah so when i was in coaching and in\ntherapy\ni started to get my life together and it\nwas interesting because\nyou know all these things were sort of\nyou know i was doing school\ni was taking better care of myself but\nthe emotions did not change i still felt\nterrible for a long time and\nsort of like well this isn't working i\ndon't know what's going on i've done\neverything and i think i realized that\nproblem was that i wasn't addressing the\nunderlying\nsort of emotions and what i was feeling\ni was just sort of trying to push past\nit\nto do what i needed to do\nand what what kind of emotion was\nunderlying can you\nhelp us understand that\nwell i think there was definitely fear\nuh hopelessness\nuh loneliness sadness um\nfrustration frustration at like feeling\nall those things\num yeah\njust uh yeah all sorts of stuff\nand asriel forgive do you prefer asriel\nby the way or do you want me to call you\nsomething else\ni guess it's up to you azrael or thomas\nwhat do you prefer whatever you prefer\nmy dude\nall right well online i usually just go\nby azrael\nokay so asriel i'm going to play devil's\nadvocate for a second okay\nall right so you're saying that like so\nyou started to put your life together\nright you you went into coaching you got\ninto therapy\num so it sounds like you did one batch\nof coaching one round of therapy\nand then a second batch of coaching yeah\nand so\nthe funny thing there is that like\nyou're saying that like you started\nputting your life together so you were\nlike back in school maybe you were like\ndoing stuff\nbut internally you still felt awful\nand so like my question to you is is it\nthe point of going to therapy that it's\nsupposed to fix the\ninternal stuff like how does that work\nthat externally things are going well\nand internally like don't you go to\ntherapy and doesn't that fix the\ninternal\nstuff isn't that how it works\nwell i i don't know it was\nwhen i was in therapy it was\nyou know i told my therapist what my\ngoals were to\nfinish school and everything and they\nwere gonna help me with that\num i don't know i found therapy it was\num so we only had like half an hour\nevery week to talk\nand i found it was mostly just me\nrecapping what happened that week and\nthen the therapist would provide\noccasional input\nbut it was mostly just and then they\nwould validate\nor talk about whatever i was feeling and\nlike maybe\npoint out thought distortions and all\nthat\nand i think i used that to sort of\nhelp me progress but i didn't use it to\nsort of address the underlying feelings\nnecessarily\nand so once you had that realization\nwhich is a big one\nhow do you feel about your therapy\nexperience are you kind of happy with it\nor\nso when i finished school i felt like i\ngot everything i needed out of therapy\nlike you know we discussed everything\nthat i thought i was ever\nreally going to need from it so i it was\ngetting expensive and i\nbasically quit um\n[Music]\nyeah what was the question again i was\njust curious about whether you were\nhappy with your therapy experience\nuh mixed feelings so i definitely think\nit helped\ni don't think it did everything that i\nthought it would do\nokay and can you help me understand um\nwell so let's start what what did you\nwant it to do that it didn't do\ni think i wanted to\ni don't know just be more\nat peace with myself maybe uh less\nstressed less anxious\ni think it did help with that it's just\nthat\nbecause it was only for five months\nthere was only so much\nprogress that we could have made um\nit was interesting because when i was in\ntherapy we were talking about how like\nyou know i'm working so hard i'm doing\nall this stuff and it's not enough\nand my therapist was like oh wait a\nminute this is insane you're\nyou're thriving in a pandemic when most\nof my clients are like\nfish out of water it's like\nso i think part of therapy was just\nrecognizing when i was pushing myself\ntoo hard or not\nacknowledging you know what i had\naccomplished and just\nlooking at how far i've come so maybe\none of the thought distortions\nyeah i guess so and i think we also had\num\nuh i have a lot of shits so like i\nshould be doing this i should be doing\nthat so he discussed that\nyeah so asriel it sounds like you've\ncome a long way\nyeah i'd say so okay so you would own\nthat\nas opposed to definitely\nokay um and can you help me understand\nwhat the experience of coaching was like\nversus therapy and and how the two\nare different or similar\nso with coaching um the first\num coaching i did it was\nyou know me and a group of other people\nthat maybe we were\nunfamiliar with our emotions we didn't\nreally know what we were doing in life\nand we were just trying to figure things\nout i think\ncoaching was very good at\ni'd say it's actually like um because\ncoaching got me into therapy\nwhere we discussed you know how our week\nwas going and\nagain i am devaluing all the stuff that\ni did that week and\nthey would stop me and say hey actually\nthat's pretty amazing like good job\nand i'd be like can't do anything like\nwhat are you talking about\nso i don't know i think we worked\nthrough that there was\ndefinitely some practical skills like\nreflective listening\num recognizing\nyou know emotions um\nstuff like that and then that got me\ninto therapy which is more\none-on-one um i had\nsomeone for better help and they were\nvery good at\nwhat's it called the\ni i had it now i forgot\nthe cognitive behavioral therapy i think\nit's called okay yeah\ncbt sounds like it with thought\ndistortions\nyeah and so i think that was sort of a\ncontinuation\nof you know where i left off with\ncoaching\nand then once therapy was too expensive\nwhen i finished school and\ni still felt like i needed to talk to\npeople so i got back into coaching\nin the high performance group because i\nfelt like i\nsort of progressed past the regular\ncoaching by that point\nsure and what's that experience are you\nstill doing the\nhigh performance group yeah and how's\nthat going\nthat's pretty good i think i feel um\nin the group and we've discussed this is\nthat\nyou know i'm the youngest member i'm\nstill in school\nmost of them have jobs and so maybe i\njust feel a little bit\ni i asreel i've i've heard about you\ni'm now i heard about the group that\nyou're in\nif i remember correctly so i heard that\nthere was someone in one of the high\nperformance groups that was really\nconfused about what they were doing\nthere\nis that you that's probably me and how\ndo you feel about it now\nmy is pretty good actually yeah\ni'm hap i'm really happy to hear that so\ni i if i could just share this so i\ni heard so i i sort of hear about i\ni don't know if you guys uh know this\nbut you know i work\nwe do have like a model where i work\nwith your coaches\non a weekly basis and so i i hear about\nyou know challenges or situations\nin the different groups and i'll kind of\nlike weigh in so i heard there was one\ngroup that you know has like ceos and\npeople who like have real careers and\nthere was one person who's very young\nwho was really confused about what they\nwere doing i don't know if that was you\nor if that you know maybe every group\nhas\none person that feels like they don't\nbelong um\nbut i you know so i did sort of hear\nabout that and and what do you think\nabout being in the group now\nit's um it's a pretty good experience um\ni like it i i have a lot to contribute\neven if i'm the youngest member um\nand it's going to just share my opinion\nyeah do you feel like the other group\nmembers respect you\nyeah i think so so that that makes me\nreally happy to hear asriel because i i\nthink the\ngoal of group is to have someone like\nyou and come in\nand feel like like that's exactly what\nwe're here to work on right like so you\ncome into a situation you're like oh\nall of these people are better than me\nand the goal of group\nis like we're gonna work on you in the\ngroup until you no longer feel that way\nyou can honestly acknowledge that yes\nthese people are actually objectively\nfurther along in life than i am and yet\nit's okay for me to be here that i can\nstill make meaningful contributions that\nsomething about my experience can still\nhelp other people\nthat i can still help them and they can\nstill help me and so if you feel like\nyou belong there like i'm really happy\nto hear that because i don't think i\never got an update i just stopped\nhearing about it so i just\nsort of assumed that things had gotten\nbetter but if you know if you\nanyway if you do have challenges feel\nfree to bring them up in the group and\nthen i i think i'll\nwind up hearing about them if there's a\nyou know concern or problem\num all right but\nyeah go ahead i think more recently with\nme trying to find a job this summer\nuh i don't know i it brought up a lot of\nfeelings of sort of inadequacy\nlike they all have jobs and here i am i\nhad an\nemotional breakdown like in front of the\njob site and it's like i can't even get\na job and i'm in this group\nso yes it brought up some of those\nfeelings again\nyeah so it sounds like once again the\nfeelings are down there sorry i didn't\nmean to laugh but i was just\nyou know despite all the progress we\njust talked about i really commend you\nfor saying\nbut by the way it's not entirely fixed\nand yes you know azrael just to say like\nthat's how\ngrowth happens you know it's sort of\nlike when i think about\nyou know even like playing a game like\ndo you do you play games or\nyeah absolutely yeah what do you play\nminecraft\ni've done a lot of star blasts dot io\nwhich\nyeah it's uh sort of you know you're a\nspaceship and you go around and mine\nasteroids and upgrade your spaceship\nand there's different game modes you can\nplay in a team\nsurvival mode um capture the flag all\nsorts of stuff\ninteresting um yeah it's just an online\nbrowser game so\nso when i kind of think about games you\nknow when you're\nplaying a game like you may not master\nsomething right away right like there's\nthe first time you learn how to do\nsomething\nand then you screw up a couple times and\nthen like you do it again\nand then you screw up fewer times and\nthen you do it again and then you screw\nup maybe once and then you do it again\nand then eventually like you have it\ndown and what i'm hearing from you is\nalmost a similar pattern within group\nwhere\nlike you're gonna feel an inferior\nright and there are objective reasons\nwhy\ni don't think you should feel inferior\nas a human but in terms of experience\nlike\nyou may be the least experienced person\nin the group but someone's got to be the\nleast experienced person in the group\nand at the same time you know how can\nyou\ngrow and understand that and then also\nlike you're going to have breakdowns in\nfront of the the job hunting page like\nthat's totally like normal\nactually right no it wasn't the job\nhunting page i actually got a job\ni just never showed up oh my goodness\nyeah i went to i went to the area where\nthe job was and then i was supposed to\ncontact someone but i never did\num i don't know i feel a little bit\nguilty about it\nand like it was weird because like\nnobody even\ncalled me or asked me where i was and\nit's been\na few weeks now i showed up like like\ntwo other times but i never actually was\nable\nto get into the job so\nit was a general labor job and i think i\njust have doubts about\nwhether or not i'll be able to handle it\nand maybe\nabout working with other people there\nespecially because i've shown up in a\nfew days\nso yeah\nwhen were you supposed to start your job\num\n[Music]\ntoday is the 25th\n[Music]\nokay so yeah it's been a long time\nand no one's even contacted me to like\nfire me or ask me where i am\nso i'm just looking for another job now\nhave you contacted them\nno do you want to work there\nnot anymore\nwhat's changed\ni i don't know i just feel like i messed\nup\ni don't think they'd want me back after\nnot showing up for a few weeks\num i feel like they probably moved on\nand found someone else by now\nso i don't see a reason to show to go\nback there\ni think um that i can find\ndifferent work something maybe i'll be\nbetter\nable to manage are you concerned about\nbeing able to manage this job\nyeah i think so it's full time so\ni think it's 10 hours a day and so it's\na big commitment\nand you know i'm not sure\nif i'm ready for that okay\ni tried at least like i tried to\nshow up and everything sounds like it\nwas a bit too much for you\nmaybe i'm good at pushing myself past my\nboundaries though\nthat's i'm happy to hear you say that\nlike showing up there was definitely\npushing my boundaries already\nyep i completely agree man\nso sometimes i'll work with people about\ngoing to the gym\nyou know they'll want to go to the gym\nand like there are different ways to not\ngo to the gym\nthere's the oh i'd wish i want to go and\nthen never signing up for anything then\nthey're signing up for stuff\nthen there's waking up the morning of\nand not going then there's actually\ngetting in your car and then deciding\n[ __ ] this\nand getting out of your car and there's\ngetting in your car\ndriving to the parking lot waiting in\nthe parking lot for five minutes with an\nexistential crisis\nand then driving home and then there's\nwalking in and feeling like an idiot if\nyou walk out so you might as well just\nlike\ncheck in completely because the person\nbehind the desk is like who is this\nperson who's walking in the door turns\naround and walks out\nand then the embarrassment is going with\nyou and then you kind of like enter the\ngym and then you're like\nit would be dumb to just turn around and\nwalk out now so i might as well like\nwork out a little bit\nthere are various phases you know we\nkind of think about going to the gym or\nnot going to the gym is like binary\nright\nbut the truth is that there's actually\nlike a progress bar\nin terms of like getting a job and even\nin terms of like not showing up for the\njob\nthere's so many ways you cannot show up\nyou cannot apply you cannot interview\nyou can show up on your first day have\nan existential crisis turn around and\nleave\nyou know and i know it sounds weird but\nlike that's honestly how it works\ni wish it was simpler i wish it was less\npainful but\nyou know yeah\ni don't know i've had a lot of those\ntypes of experiences\ni don't know since two years ago\nsince second year university um\njust trying to figure out everything\nwith\nliving on my own doing university\nin a pandemic trying to feed myself\ntrying to\nyou know figure out income money\num all that stuff so\nit's been a lot of work yeah man\ni i it sounded like your therapist felt\nlike you were thriving\nin a pandemic yeah i think i made a lot\nof progress for sure\ni i can certainly i don't really\nremember a lot of the details of our\nconversation as\nreal but i certainly rem i don't\nremember\nseeing this degree of confidence in you\nlike there are certain statements that\nyou've made where i really get the sense\nthat you kind of acknowledge where you\nare\nyou accept how far you've come because i\ni get the impression that you used to\nmake statements that would like devalue\nyour progress\nlike you have to say you know like like\nyou just made a statement a little while\nago that i'm good at pushing past my\nboundaries\nwhereas i feel like a year ago you would\nhave said i need to be better at pushing\npast my boundaries or i don't push\nmyself past my boundaries enough\ni think even back then i was pushing\nmyself\na lot that's why i was sort of\nwell like even getting on stream and\nstuff that was\npushing myself past my boundaries back\nthen\nit was a lot\num\ni i don't know i guess\nthe difference is just that i've had\nmore time to actually do that\nand figure out what i'm good at what i'm\nnot good at\nhow everything works yeah\nit sounds like you've been doing a lot\nof self-reflection and understanding\nyourself quite a bit yeah\nabsolutely i've been you know watching\nyour videos like\npretty much every single one since\nlike since reckful\nhave those been helpful yeah absolutely\num i don't know you get a lot of um\nall sorts of people with\ngoing through all their own struggles\nand just listening to it all\nand figuring out how it applies to me\nand\ntrying to integrate that into how i\napproach\nmy problems i find it very helpful\ni'm happy to hear that i'm happy to hear\nit's been helpful you know i never\nreally know\ni'm pretty sure i feel pretty confident\nabout the person that i talk to but i'm\ni've always been curious\njust as a clinician because i've seen\nimpact when i work with people\nindividually\ni've always just been like a little bit\ncurious about\nhow much benefit you can get from\nwatching a youtube video\nor like watching like real benefit you\nknow like sure you can get entertained\nmaybe you can pick up a little bit of\nlike\nneat information here or there but can\nyou actually change your life\nand i find myself being skeptical\nhey yes uh and i mean it hasn't just\nbeen you i mean\nyou know i follow one other twitch\nstreamer\nwyover and um you know if i ever need a\nplace to go to just\nyou know hang out and chill and have fun\ni can go there and\ngiven that's just a huge difference\nand more recently even in the healthy\ngamer discord i'm in\ntalking with people in chill chat and\nit's nice to get out of my head\nsometimes\nyeah why uber is fantastic dude i love\nwhat he does on twitch\nyeah um so asriel can you tell me a\nlittle bit you said that for a long time\nyou were like doing stuff\noutwardly and like actually making\nprogress in your life but you were sort\nof not\nrecognizing or acknowledging emotions\nhow did you can you tell me a little bit\nabout that\nyeah so when i am doing something\num if it's outside my comfort zone what\ni'll notice\nis you know a bunch of emotions her eyes\nthere'll be fear anxiety\nsocial anxiety worry you know whatever\nand then how i actually deal with that\nis to overcome\nall those emotions with frustration i\ncan use that to sort of\nsuppress everything and just push\nthrough\nand the problem with that is that you\nknow it provides a temporary buff\nat that time but then you got to deal\nwith all that stuff later\nso interesting so so it sounds like\nyou've gotten good at pushing yourself\npast your comfort zone but it's still a\npush\nit's not easy it requires like a lot of\neffort\nand i'm also hearing it has a cost\nyeah absolutely um\ni think that's where the devaluing comes\nin it's like\nyou know i i should be capable of doing\nthis by now\nlike why am i so bad um\nand sort of using that to overcome those\nemotions and just\nyou know i think that's the sort of\ntoxicity\nof maybe toxic productivity\nuh mindset where you know i'm just\nbeating myself up to get\nsomething done yeah idea\nyou really have been watching a lot of\nstuff and learning\nas well um\nyeah so where are you i mean is that\nsomething that you want to talk about\ntoday or potentially something we can\nwork on or did you have\nthoughts about you know how how this\nconversation or go is\nsomething i can help you with today\noh i think what i wanted to take away\nhopefully was just how to\nmaybe make that process a little easier\non myself\nthat i'm not constantly struggling\nso much with everything\nthat maybe be a little bit easier\num maybe just to be more at peace with\nmy decisions not get so stressed out\nokay can i just collect my thoughts for\na second\nsure\ni would really love to help you navigate\nthat asriel let me just think about\nhow to do that\nokay let me just toss a couple things\nout okay you let me know if we're kind\nof on the same page or not\nso there's some kind of emotion let's\nsay fear\num lack of confidence something like\nthat excuse me\ni made the mistake of having pizza for\nlunch i've been eating healthier\nbut today\nso you know you have some kind of\nemotion\nright some kind of lack of confidence\nand then what happens\nis you practice\nsome kind of frustration or\nself-loathing\nyou start beating yourself up you're\nsaying oh i should be better than this\nand the interesting thing is that's\nsomewhat of a double-edged sword because\nlike\nif you feel ashamed you can actually use\nshame as motivation\nyou say like why am i so bad at this i\nshould just i should be able to do it\nand so then you force yourself you push\nthrough\nthat pile of emotion you there's one\nnegative emotion that\nis keeping you from doing it and then\nyou kind of\nyou know fill up your engines with shame\nand then you use that shame to overcome\nand then you end up actually making\nprogress in your life which is great\nbut but there's something incredibly\nlike not peaceful about that\nright and this is where the toxic\nproductivity comes in because when you\nuse\nnegative emotions to fuel your\nproductivity like\nthere's a toxic feel to it\num so\nyou know i think what we can try to talk\nabout today is like trying to\nunderstand how to disarm that negative\nemotion\nin to begin with so the interesting\nthing is\nyou may be able to cultivate better\nsources of motivation\nbut if we think about you need shame to\nsucceed right now\nyou need it right and it's it's\nnecessary to\novercome that hump of\nwhatever the negative emotion is so if\nwe can process\nand get rid of what's underneath you'll\nneed shameless\nand so you can learn an alternate\nfueling strategy\nor what you can do is require less fuel\nby like making the challenge a little\nbit better\nand i do think that you're you've\nclearly worked hard as real and you're\npretty insightful so i think that maybe\nlike that's something that we could work\non today what do you think\nfor sure and i'd also like to add um\nwhen i do disarm that sort of shame\nit just means that i don't really do\nanything that's where the\nthoughts of like you know what's the\npoint why bother\nstart coming up yep right so like you're\nsaying like when i\nempty my engines i don't move anywhere\nand we're like\nabsolutely man so it's tough it's tough\nokay\nso the first thing that i just want to\nacknowledge is that\nif you keep doing what you're doing\nasriel i think you'll continue doing\nfine and you will eventually feel better\nso like i do think that\nemotionally it sounds like you actually\nmade a lot of progress\nand so the first thing that i kind of\nwant to point out to everyone is\nsometimes people ask like\ndespite making progress why does it\ncontinue to be hard\nand so this is where like i'm going to\nuse like an online matchmaking analogy\ndespite getting better at the game why\nis my win rate still close to 50\nright so the challenge here asriel is\nthat you're getting better\nbut you're also like dealing with more\nso as you like you know start doing well\nin school and now you're looking for a\njob and like now you're doing therapy\nand like even like\nyou know you're actually like the\nchallenges that you're leveling up but\nlike\nthe monsters you're fighting or like\nleveling up with you\nand it's not actually that they're\nleveling up with you it's just that\nyou're going\ndeeper and deeper into the game of life\nwhere things get\nharder and harder so you're actually\nlike objectively making progress\nand like you're climbing that mountain\nright so like the better you get it\nclimbing\nthe higher you go the thinner the air\ngets and\nwhat it feels like is like you're making\nno progress\nso that's just the first thing to\nunderstand okay so like\nyou know anyway so at some point you'll\nequilibriate out because i mean either\nyou'll\nyou know climb towards i don't know what\nbut generally speaking at some point\nlike you'll have you know like a job\nhopefully you'll have like a good\nrelationship hopefully you'll have a\ngood social circle\nand then you kind of chill and then you\nlike look back on your life and you're\nlike wow i've made a lot of progress and\nactually i'm pretty happy\nand even if we hear you talk it sounds\nlike in a lot of ways you feel like\nreally\nlike confident in yourself you can\naccept yourself and be proud of some of\nyour accomplishments\nand there's a bunch of crap still\nlingering down there so we're going to\nget to that i just wanted to\nshare that does that make sense yeah i\nthink that makes sense\nso the reason it feels like we're\nconstantly struggling not making\nprogress\nis actually because we are progressing\num so let me ask you when it comes to\nthe job\nokay when you were when they\ni'm gonna toss something out i'm gonna\nguess that the fact that no one\ncalled you may have been the worst part\nof the experience\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i i agree there was no input i\ncouldn't\ngauge the situation it was hard to tell\nyou know if they were mad or if they\nwere concerned\nif they even cared about me\ni don't know i felt like maybe i wasn't\nactually that important\nyeah and so\nwhat what do you what do you how do you\nunderstand that\nuh\ni don't know it's just\ni don't think i am necessarily\nparticularly important to anyone but\nmyself really i mean\ni would be a little bit selfish to think\nthat\nanyone else really cares about me i mean\nmaybe my family i guess\nbut maybe some people online\nbut it's mostly just me so\nhow does it feel to be unimportant to\nthe rest of the world\ni mean it sort of sucks i guess\nmaybe i feel a little sad and lonely\nlike nothing i do is gonna change that\ni think that's sort of where the\nfeelings of\nhopelessness comes from yeah and i think\nalso that feeds into\ni have nihilistic thoughts\num so\nsort of the belief that like you know\nwhat's the point of doing anything if\ni'm just gonna die and\nno one's gonna care right\nyeah so i think somewhere along the way\npeople\nmy understanding is that people have\nlost a big part\nof nihilism whereas i i thought the\npoint of nihilism is that\nthat you can't rely on\nan external objective standard for\nmeaning and purpose\nso it doesn't mean that there isn't any\nmeaning and purpose it means that\nyou have to sort of carve it out\nyourself\nand that like there isn't like a like\nthere isn't like a you know\nomnipotent god that is going to give you\nmeaning\nand that yeah yeah i agree um\nbut i don't know i don't think i'd want\nanyone to\ni don't know i don't like the idea of\nsome\nhigher being controlling my life\nso before we get you know down the road\nof philosophy which if you want to go\ndown we can\ni'm going to ask you though asriel how\nlong have you felt how long have you\nbeen\nunimportant\ni don't know like\nforever maybe fourth grade i guess\nwhy do you have fourth grade\nwell might have been before that too but\nin\nfourth grade that was when my parents\nsplit up um and then\nit's the weirdest thing my dad was\ndriving me to school one day and like\nyou know we show up to school and\nthey're like oh you're not registered at\nthis school anymore\nand it turns out that my mom had just\nchanged my school\nso we had to show up at a different\nschool tonight\ni had no idea my dad had no idea\nand i don't know i feel like from\nthat point onward things were different\nso i was living between you know both\nparents switching houses\num i\nmy mom was trying to find someone new\nand\nyou know my dad was always busy with\nwork um\nyou know i had siblings and they were\nalways\nbetter than me at everything so they\nalways got credit\num my mom eventually found someone new\nbut they you know they were dealing with\ntheir own problems\nand they had a lot of\nmaybe bad coping mechanisms\nso like you know they drink and they\ntake out their frustration on\nus which wasn't\nvery nice um i don't know\ni just i felt like i had to prove myself\nthat i had to do\neverything just to get noticed\nand i didn't really feel too important\nin the chaos that turned out to be\ngrowing up\nhow does it feel to talk about this\nstuff\num\ni don't know it's i can definitely feel\nthere's an emotion down there of sadness\nmaybe\ni don't know it's difficult i sort of\nlearned to\ndo everything on my own and i haven't\nreally had anyone to help me along the\nway which just\nsucks\nyeah i'm i'm sort of feeling an immense\namount of pity\nwhat do you think about that\noh how would you describe pity\ngreat question\nso i feel sorrow for\nthe person that you the kid that you\nused to be\nyeah i think so\nso when you say sadness\nis that sadness for yourself or sadness\nfor your former self\nwell listen to sort of both because\nmy former self shaped who i am today\nyeah and in a sense it's sort of like\ni'm still you know walking that path\nso\nso can you hmm\ncan you tell me okay hold on\ni'm i'm trying to decide if i can do\nsomething a little bit unorthodox with\nyou asriel because\nyou've watched stream so much so let's\nlet's let's\ntry to be a little bit unorthodox okay\ncan i\ni'm gonna need your help because this\nmay fail miserably\nokay so we'll fail together so\nwhen you started talking about you said\nyour mom started looking for someone\nand then you mentioned the person and\nthen the first thing that you said about\nthem is they had their own\nstruggles\nwhat are you doing yeah\nmaybe\nsee maybe i'm deflecting the blame\nabsolutely right so you've watched\nstream a fair amount\nso when someone comes on and says oh\nthey had their own struggles\nlife was hard they were addicted to\nalcohol\nwhat does that person what do we what do\nwe know about that situation what can we\ninfer about that situation\nwhen someone comes on stream and starts\nsaying things like that protecting\nsomeone\nam i allowed to protect them a little\nmore\nyeah so i don't think they were\naddicted to alcohol i just think when\nthey were in a bad mood they had a\ntendency to drink a lot\nokay does that make things better or\nworse for you\nwell i think it's just how i was able to\ntell whether\nyou know whether i should be careful or\nnot when i got home\nhow do you feel about blaming them\nwell it's hard because like you know\nthey can be abusive sometimes but then\nsometimes you know\nthey're sort of a great person like that\nis a mixed\nmixed bag i guess so it's hard to blame\nthem when they\ni can recognize that they're\nthat they're not all bad right\nif they were pure evil then it'd be easy\none would think\num and so i know this sounds kind of\nweird as real but like\nyou know in my experience there's a\ncertain amount of blame\nthere's like almost like you know 100\npoints of blame\nin people's lives and generally speaking\nit gets distributed right so i think\nsome people who are like narcissistic\nwill put a hundred points of the blame\non other people\nand then you know where i'm going with\nthis\nyou're put 100 points on myself what do\nyou think\naccurate right\nand it's kind of interesting because\nlike i think when we think about like\na lack of like you know how long have\nyou felt not\nvaluable well like where does that\nfeeling of not being valuable\ncom like how does that you know that\nfeels to me very similar to the way that\nyou\nif you've been blaming yourself every\ntime you do that you decrease your\ninternal value\nand then when someone doesn't call you\nafter you don't show up for a job\ninterview what your mind tells you is\nlike see they didn't care about you\nanyway like you're not even worth it\nthey don't give a [ __ ]\nit doesn't matter what like i am i have\nno impact on the outside world\nthey're gonna live their lives and\nwhether i'm there or not there whether i\nexist or not exist\nthe world doesn't really care no one\nreally cares\ni'm insignificant that's what your mind\ntells you\nyeah it's um\npretty much yeah\nso i think they're how do you feel right\nnow you feeling okay\nyeah i think i think i'm all right\nokay\nlet me know okay if we're pushing past\nyour boundaries\nif we get to that point we're like oh my\ngod i'm so weak\ni should be able to have another session\nwith dr k\nyou let me know if you start thinking\nthat way okay\nall right can i trust you there bro\ni think so okay good all right let's\nkeep going\nso tell me a little bit about\ndo you know why your parents split up\nyeah i talked to my mom a little bit\nabout it i think\nfor her she just didn't feel like she\nwas getting\n[Music]\nlike there were there was no\nsort of emotional connection so maybe\nshe felt a little emotionally neglected\ncause my dad was always busy with work\nand you know he is a very practical\ntype of person um get things done\nall that um so maybe\nhe's very busy i'd say i mean he runs\nhis own\nengineering company and that's a lot of\nwork in itself\nyou know he had a family um\nhe was a scout leader um\nso yeah\nhe just does a lot and maybe he didn't\nhave as much\ntime to spend with her and\nmaybe that made her feel\na little bit neglected\nso i notice you're providing reasoning\nagain\nright so you're you're hypothesizing why\nhe wasn't able to meet her emotional\nneeds\ni see that accurate i'm sure it's\naccurate\ni don't is that what do you ever think\nabout\ndid you feel like your dad was there for\nyou emotionally\nno and why not\nhard to describe it's like\nlike he wasn't he wasn't\nlike he's always busy of course he cares\nlike if i had a problem let's say i'm\ndoing badly in school there was no\nunderstanding there was no connection it\nwas just like you need to do better like\nget get your work done like this is\nunacceptable\nyou know smart enough\ni think there was no understanding there\ni guess\nand what do you think about that\nwell i know that i'm going to provide\nreasons\nwhy you know\nand then deflect the blame but i just\ndon't want to blame him for it because\ndon't know why don't you want to blame\nhim good\nso let's you're doing well asriel i'm\nnot gonna force you to blame him\ndo you feel like i'm bashing your dad\nno okay\ni don't know i just i respect him he\ndoes\ni may be a tiny bit but\nyeah he does a lot of stuff\nand he's a very hard worker\nand it's hard to blame him he's doing\neverything he can\nwhere does that leave you that he's\ndoing everything that he can but tells\nyou to smarten up when you're struggling\nyes i just learned to deal with it\nand how did you learn to deal with it\nby getting things done\nyeah right pushing through setting aside\nyour feelings who cares\nyour emotions have no value asriel\nsmarten up\npush through screw your boundaries\nsound familiar the same philosophy he\napplies to himself\nhe pushes himself a lot too\nand i'm noticing that it can be quite\nso i think there's a lot of not\nconfusion but\nthere's a lot of complexity which you're\nable to appreciate right when it comes\nto your\nsounds like your stepfather\nuh my actual father yeah i know but\nearlier we were talking about your\nstepfather the the one who\ndrinks sometimes yeah yeah right so like\nyou can\nyour mind does a really good job of like\nnoticing the good and the bad which is\nactually healthy\nright you're not gonna like say like oh\nthis guy was a complete [ __ ] and\nand the devil incarnate there were times\nwhere it sounds like he was like a cool\ndude and\nand maybe did care about you or\nsomething like that\nand then when it comes to your dad it's\nlike you know that's\nlike he did a lot of good stuff he\npushed through a lot of things you know\nlike he worked really hard he like built\nan engineering company\nthere's a lot here that i can honestly\nrespect\nand you're also able to acknowledge\nthough that like\ndid he care about you yes\ndid he love you obviously\nwas he there for you not really\nwhat do you how does it you want to push\nback against that or what do you think\nabout what i just said\ni think that's pretty accurate\nyou said he was a scout leader\nyeah what does that mean a scout leader\nlike um\nin america it's boy scouts but in canada\nit's\nall-inclusive i think um\nand sort of the reason he did that was\nyou know he wanted us to\nget into scouting and learn it because\nyou know it\nprovides a lot of value for growth\nand learning um so i think that was part\nof it\nand nike was doing it for us\nbut at the same time when you're a scout\nleader you can't\nyou know have favoritism over your kids\nbecause that's just bad for the group\nso no i wasn't treated like everyone\nelse\nokay too busy asriel what are you what\nare you doing\nso you do this thing right you're just\ntalking about scouts and what do you say\ni wasn't important that he didn't\nit wasn't there for me yep\nlet's back up a little bit and connect\nthose dots i think that's where we were\ngoing\nbut so you're good you've been watching\npaying attention i don't know if\nif chat was able to follow but let's\nthink through this right so\ni'm gonna ask you now be careful because\nlike you started talking about scouts\nand you were like he's not allowed to\nshow favoritism\n[ __ ] where does that come from what does\nthat have to do with anything\nright it's what you told yourself when\nwhat happened\nno he told that to me okay oh\ninteresting\nand how did it feel having your dad as a\nscout leader you are presumably\nin scouts yeah\nright because um\ni don't know um i think i just sort of\naccept it as reality\ni don't really think about what it's\nlike\ni was pretty cool actually i mean\npretty cool that have as a scout leader\num so so maybe he there there wasn't any\nnegative emotion there i'm curious did\nyou ever feel\njealous when you were in scouts\nno okay so you didn't have because\nsometimes people like\nwill have these kinds of thoughts or\nfeelings where you know if they didn't\nfeel this way\nyou know don't say yes but sometimes you\nknow i can imagine\nthat you're a kid who feels maybe a\nlittle bit undervalued and so that your\nmind would notice things\nwhich actually may have been completely\nfair right he's not supposed to give you\nmore or less attention\nbut if your mind was kind of hungry for\nattention from your dad that maybe you\nnoticed he was like supporting\nother kids and like you wanted him to\nsupport you the same way\nthough i think it was very much\nlike equal like\nyeah so you thought it was equal and\nfair and you felt like emotionally okay\nwith that\nyeah i accepted it for what it was and\nwhat was it\nit was just being a leader and\nyou know helping\nthe group uh learn and grow and\nlearn new skills and i was part of the\ngroup\nyeah absolutely it sounds like you're\nvery proud of your dad\nyeah for sure also sounds like maybe you\nfelt proud of being your dad's son\ni can imagine that it it can be hard or\nconfusing to\neven now it sounds like you respect your\ndad a lot and you feel proud of him\ndo you feel do you feel proud to be his\nson\nyeah sure i never thought about it but\nyeah i guess so\nokay i'm a little bit confused by your\nresponse because you seem pretty\nlike i can imagine like you sort of\nhinted at like you know you\nlike everyone in the troop knew that\nyour dad was pretty cool because he was\na scout leader and he knew all this\nstuff\nso actually i'm feeling like a sense of\npride there\nwhen i ask you now what i'm hearing is a\nlogical answer\nokay does that make sense like\ni can i can i can almost feel the pride\nthat you felt as a kid\nlike you guys are out doing scout stuff\nand you're like yeah that's my dad\ni'm i'm not i'm not hearing that same\nthing i i definitely hearing a lot of\nrespect for what he's built\nfor sure right an understanding and an\nappreciation of the challenges that he's\nfaced and how he's like\ncontinued to persevere through those\nchallenges absolutely\nis he proud of you\nyeah i think so um i\ndon't think i ever thought\nthat he was proud of me until recently\noh it's sort of like i left for a\nuniversity and then\nyou know things just changed\nwhat changed\ni don't know um i was the youngest\nchild in the family so once i left\nyou know he sort of you know he stopped\nbeing a scout leader\num he started looking for a wife or\nnot a wife but a girlfriend someone else\nto live with\nand then\ni don't know as he's being a lot more\nsupportive\nand less\nsort of aggressive like aggressive\ntowards\nme and my achievements um\nthough he doesn't\ni've talked to him and i it's weird\nbecause he\ndoesn't seem to acknowledge that\nanything has changed\nyeah can i try to interpret what i heard\nmaybe try to string together a couple of\nthose dots\nso i'm almost hearing that like maybe\nyour dad like\nlike his role as father was like almost\nlike a grind for him\nit was like a duty you know he had to\nmake sure\nthat you guys got to a certain point\nit's almost like he didn't have the\nspace to be like\nproud and chill\nit's like we got to get asriel to\ncollege we got to do this we got to do\nthis like\nit's about like getting them to where\nthey need to go\nin a very objective sense and like\nfeelings are like\nno room for feelings yeah\ni think he sacrificed a lot for us\nand now that there's space for it\nhe's kind of chilling a little bit maybe\nfeels more proud of\ni you i don't know\nmaybe has he ever has he ever said to\nyou that he's proud of you\nno not openly what would it be like to\nhear that\nuh\ni don't know if that's\ni don't know if that would actually do\nanything\nokay what makes you think that\ni just like great he's proud of me now\nwhat\nit doesn't solve anything\nwhat are we trying to solve\nwhat's the my life and what aspects of\nyour life\nme failing at everything do you fail at\neverything\nabsolutely that's how it\nthat's my approach i i just brute force\nit and i fail like\nevery time and you know i just do it\nenough times eventually i'll get through\nyou know i just power through everything\nokay i'm a little bit\nconfused um\nwould you could you ever ask your dad if\nhe was proud of you\ni don't think so like why would i do\nthat\nthat's just looking for validation\nthat's feeding a particular beast is it\nnot\ngive me a second asriel\ni think i think we've stumbled upon a\nbig problem\nbut give me just a second because i i\ntrust that\nyou're a smart dude and i trust you're\nfamiliar with these concepts so i got to\nfigure out\nokay here's where i'm coming from okay\nbro\ni don't think you're i don't i think\nyou're doing well on the outside world\nlike the whole premise of this\nconversation is like you're making\noutward progress\nbut internally it still feels bad\nso like the first thing that's weird is\nlike i think we've run into some kind of\nyou know like when you're playing a game\nand like the boss is at 20\nhealth and they like develop some kind\nof combo breaker super shield kind\nof thing where you're like you're on\nyour way there and then like something\npops up and then they like\nturn into some other boss and they've\nlike morphed i feel like that's what\njust happened\nbecause i thought the whole premise of\nthis conversation i realized we're being\nintellectual so this may not be helpful\nbut like i\nwant you to notice this with me that\nlike i thought the premise of this\nconversation is that\noutside as your therapist puts it you're\nthriving in a pandemic\ni mean are you you know have you started\na billion dollar company\nsounds like no and at the same time you\nget there one day\nabsolutely man so like you'll you'll\nyou'll like you're you're\nback in school you know you\nhave gotten gotten through the way in\nwhich you failed to find a job is\nprogressing right you got a job you\ndidn't you know it was hard so like\nyou're still like\nyou're working on actually i'm not\nworried about the outside world\nwhat i think this conversation is about\nis this unshakable feeling\nthat you have that you are not worth and\nthink\nright that like you're not valuable\ni think i have value it's what i can\naccomplish and do for people around me\num no it isn't\nso i know this sounds perplexing but\nyou have intrinsic value\nyou don't have to believe me you don't\nhave to disagree it's just what i\nbelieve it's a belief\nso i think what you were taught\nis that like your value is like\ndependent on your accomplishments\nright that like your dad like when you\ndidn't do a good job like\nhe didn't like demonstrate to you that i\nstill care about you in a very like\nexplicit\nway right he was like you need to do\nbetter then i shall love you\nthere's a part of you that knows that\nisn't true but like there are some\nsignals that he sent you that sort of\nlike\ncreated that complex does that make\nsense i mean you even say it when you\ntalk about your siblings you're like you\nknow i had to work so much harder to get\nrecognized because they were better than\ni was\nthere's a lot of like conditionality to\nlike the\nlove right so like your value as a\nperson\neven when it comes to your stepdad like\nfluctuated\nif your dad was in a bad mood there's no\nintrinsic value\nactually and so like the the way that\nyour your stepdad treated you actually\ntaught you that there's no\nconstant sense of value right like the\nway you get treated\nfluctuates depending on all kinds of\nexternal things does that make sense\nuh a little confused about\nyou are talking about how it fluctuates\nwith my stepdad\ni think i always recognize that what he\nwas doing was wrong and it just became\nlike a 40 chess game 40 social chess\ngame\ntrying to get him to not you know get\nset off\num i\ni think i recognized that that was sort\nof an abusive\ntoxic relationship and that\nyou know i don't think i was\ni based my value on what he thought\nthank you very much for clarifying that\nso let me let me take a different angle\nso like if we go back to your fourth\ngrade school example\nright like the what i really interpreted\nthere was that your mom\nsort of didn't care like she didn't\nthink about\nyour inconvenience and embarrassment\nwell i think the idea was that my\nbrother was going to the other school\nbecause he got in the gifted program and\ni didn't\nand then she was sort of thinking well\nwhy don't i just go to that school too\nbut she never really told anyone and\nthat part of that is probably because\nshe was\npretty probably emotional\nat the time and what are you doing\nyou're right you can't you can't help it\nso it's it's i'm not i'm not telling you\nto stop\ni i think it's just it's what your mind\nis doing so\nyou're you're absolutely right man like\nit's it's like a very reasonable thing\nfor your mom to do that right she's like\nlet's have my two kids together\none kid got into the gifted program so\ni'm gonna move the other kid totally\nfine like i don't think it's any\nlike moving you s to another school is\ncompletely logical i have no issue with\nthat\nthe question is how did you feel the day\nthat you showed up at your old school\ni think i just accepted that this is my\nlife now\ni go to a new school and i gotta\nfigure out how to fit in\nyep so i think acceptance is absolutely\nright because what i'm hearing there\nhonestly and you can push back if you\nwant to i may be wrong\nright so by all means correct me but\nlike what i'm hearing is that like\nyou're kind of an afterthought\nright like it's one thing to move you\nlike even if we say like okay your\nbrother got into the gifted and talented\nprogram we're gonna move you anyway but\nlike at least let you know\nlike i could just i'm just trying to put\nmyself in the shoes of a fourth grader\nwho shows up at their class\nand their teacher is like you're no\nlonger a student here like can you\nlike that sounds so\ndevastatingly embarrassing to me\nlike it sounds like bewildering in like\nclueless\nnow i don't even know if you went into\nthe classroom and you got told by your\nteacher or like you know someone met you\nlike i don't know but like\nwhat i'm what i'm kind of noticing is\nlike inconsiderateness\nit's like they don't even think about\nyou it's almost like like your mom\ndidn't like think to tell you hey by the\nway like she\nthere's no space in her mind like for\ni'm not trying to be brutal here\nbut like you know what i'm sort of\nnoticing it's almost like the same thing\nat work it's like does that even\nanyone even notice if i don't show up\nit's like a lack of noticing right like\nit's a lack of like\nlike i'm getting the sense as real i can\nsee you're getting maybe a little bit\nemotional but\ni i like what i'm getting is like you\nwere taught this lesson that like\nyou're not worth thinking about\nyeah i think that's a common theme\nright and it's like it's amazing to see\nyou progress like especially in the high\nperformance group where it's like i\ndon't belong here\nit's like objectively like you know you\ncan make a good argument for that but\nyou\nabsolutely belong there and the\nobjectivity of it doesn't matter and\nlike you've been able to see like you\nknow even though there's like\nthere are people who are quite advanced\nin their careers here who are very\nsuccessful\nlike i can still make a meaningful\ncontribution\nlike that's intrinsic value\nright that like no matter what your\ncircumstances are no matter who you're\naround whether the successful\nunsuccessful\nyou have value\nand so i think what we're working on\nhere is not\nanything to do with the outside success\nbecause i think that you're doing\nyou've learned how to push through like\nyou're crushing it bro good\nyou have a ways to go absolutely but are\nyou making progress absolutely\nwhat we're talking about here is that\nlike feeling on the inside at least\nthat's what i\nthat's what i'm focusing on it's your\nyou tell me otherwise\nbut and and this is where like i think\nit's gonna be tricky because i think\nwhat's what i'm detecting is a sense of\nlike\nlack of intrinsic value right the first\nquestion i think i asked you is how long\nhave you felt like\ni don't know exactly what it was that\nyou weren't worth much\nright you say forever so it's something\nyou carry with you\nwe can go through these different\nstories about you know now that your dad\nand so then when i ask you the question\nlike is your dad proud of you and you're\nlike i don't know what difference that\nwould make dude it's going to make all\nthe difference\ni think i'd know how to process that\neven if he did\nsay it you're damn right you don't which\nis the entire problem\nright because like how do you process\nthat which you've never heard before\nand if we think about like what's the\nproblem here it's that like i know it\nsounds kind of weird but like\nyou know this is sometimes what happens\nwhen kids aren't told that\nyou're proud of them as they carry this\nthing where you're just not\nsure what your intrinsic value was and\nyou're like how can words make a\ndifference\nand i'm not sure i mean i just and this\nis where i think i think you're\nincredibly frightened of asking him too\nyeah i think so and so if we think about\nthat like we can see that sort of\ndoesn't\nif you if what he says doesn't matter\nwhy on earth are you scared of asking\nhim\nmaybe i just don't want to look like a\nfool\nyep i think you're afraid\nof two things one is that he's gonna say\nno\nand probably more likely is he's not\ngonna know how to answer the question\nwhat do you think about that\nwhat do you mean when like you say he\nwon't know how to answer it\nso in the same way that you don't know\nhow to process\nhis answer he may not know how to\nprocess the question\nbecause it sounds like that's not\nyou know a scout badge that you guys\never got\nright like emotional discussions between\nfather and son about like what he\nwhat you mean to him is like just\nsomething that you guys aren't familiar\nwith\ni think he has expressed that he cares a\nlot about me\num ah that's completely different though\nright i know it sounds similar but let's\nbe clear\ni can care a lot about someone\nbut being proud of them is completely\ndifferent\nokay there's a reason i'm not asking\nabout love right i'm not asking does\nyour dad love you because i know he\nloves you you know he loves you\nthat's clear like he's done a good job\nwith that he's sacrificed for you\nyou know you mean a lot to him like i'm\nnot hearing that at all\ni know it sounds weird but like you know\nso for some people that's that's the\nissue\nbut for you i think it's about pride\nit's about value it's about worth\nyou know like like at the end of the day\nwhen you strip away\nall of your accomplishments is like are\nyou are you worth something\nhmm i guess i'd say\nnot really yeah\ni i think i i can see that you believe\nthat\nand so when it comes to like nihilism\nand when it comes to like\nyou know using frustration as fuel like\ni think as long as you feel that way\nlike\nthat's gonna be tough\nsorry\ni think also because i had a\nconversation with him recently\nand like that was\nyou know i i explained that i was having\na rough time\nwhatever and in the past\nbut like this time i was sort of talking\nabout\nyou know how i always feel i need to\naccomplish everything and\nlike with the job how i didn't show up\nand he was just like\ndude it's a summer job like are you\nbeing so hard on yourself\nand then he sort of met up my dad\nokay and then it was sort of like like\nwhere did i go wrong like where did i\nmess up that\nyou know you ended up this way\nis that what he said to you\nyeah and then i was like\nno i don't think you messed up i think\nyou know that was just me learning to\nbe me and\ni think it was something that i taught\nmyself\ni think i was just deflecting the blame\nhelp me understand how you interpret\nthat interaction with your dad\num\nwell it was just\ni don't know i guess it was a little bit\nrelieving\nmaybe that you know he didn't\nyou know push me like you know\ni was the only one pushing myself that\nhe's not\nreally pushing me anymore to succeed or\nwhatever\nno okay it's nice to let that go\ni guess sort of\nokay asriel i need a minute okay\nall right\nokay i'm gonna ask you to take a step\nback from that like let's really pay\nattention to what was said okay\nand and i'm noticing that maybe i'm\ntrying to bludgeon you\ninto believing something does it feel\nthat way to you\num i don't think you can bludgeon me\ninto believing anything if i don't want\nto\ni completely agree but does it feel like\nyou're being bludgeoned\nnot saying it's working i'm asking what\nit feels like\ni don't know what you're trying to get\nme to believe\ngreat do you feel like i'm getting you\nto believe anything i'm like pushing you\nto believe something\nmaybe something about intrinsic value\nand that\nmy dad is proud of me or something\nokay okay okay good all right so like i\nlike let's listen to that statement okay\nso like i'm just gonna tell the story\nback as i heard it because it was a\nsurprising story to me so you\ndidn't show up for your summer job you\ngo to your dad and you say hey\nby the way i didn't show up for my\nsummer job fair enough so far\nor then he's like\nwhere did i screw up with you\nno what did he say tomorrow like\nwell it was i didn't show up you know\ni've\ni felt you know incredibly you know i\nhad an emotional breakdown\nyou know i was incredibly nervous and he\nwas like\nyou know why are you pushing yourself so\nhard\num it's just a summer job like\nit's only so much you can do um\nand then you know where did i go wrong\nwith you\nor like no i mentioned you know how i\nhave this\nperformance versus growth mindset and\ntrying to get out of the performance\nmindset he's like i never taught you\nthat like\nyou know where do you learn that\nwhere is i go wrong\nokay what do you what do you how do you\nunderstand the statement where did i go\nwrong with you\nthank you\ntrying to put the blame on himself maybe\nand then i'm not allowing that yeah\nso i completely agree so here's what\nlike\ni think is problematic so i think this\nis like some weird stuff okay so asriel\nwhat i'm about to say there are multiple\ninterpretations of number one\ninterpretation is that\ni've got something in my mind and i'm\nnot willing to let that go or change\nthat\nso i could be wrong here so i'm going to\njust toss this out because like this\nstory is\nis becoming is getting a little bit more\nand more unexpected\nso like i think there's there's\nsomething very supportive\nabout that and also like\nsomething incredibly damning\nso like like on the supportive side is\nthe reason you're screwed up is because\nit's my fault and i wasn't good enough\nof a dad\nand that's better than the reason you're\nscrewed up is because of something that\nyou did\nthe the problem though and this is like\nwhat i'm trying to\nbludgeon you to understand is that\nirrespective of who's to blame\nthere's a fundamental assumption that\nyou're screwed up\nlike do you see that it's like where did\ni go wrong that my son\nended up like this like that is the\nopposite of pride\nright so like like is is he like growing\nand doing better and like trying to be\nlike\ncompassionate and understanding and like\nis he not\nso he's grown right like so he's doing\nbetter because he's not just saying\njust be better bro he's like\nwhere did i go wrong\nso i i get what you're saying and i do\nthink it's like growth on his part i\ndon't think your dad is a bad dude by\nany means\nit's just like i want you to think about\nwhen when a parent\nthinks that way about a child even if\nthey accept responsibility for it\nwhat does it signal to the child about\ntheir intrinsic worth\nthat's a feedback loop\nso it's sort of confirming\nright and so that that what yeah that i\nmessed up\nmaybe yep\nand so if we think about what do you use\ntoxic productivity to get over\nit's that you're messed up\nright and and like i don't think your\ndad is\nhonestly i don't think he's a bad dude\nlike it's clear to me that he loves you\na lot he's made a lot of sacrifices\nit's clear to me that you love him like\nyou know we haven't\ngotten to your mom or your siblings\nand what it's like to have siblings who\nare in the gifted and talented\nprogram and you're not and things like\nthat right so like there are a lot of\nreasons like\nasriel i think the problem is not that\nyou're stupid i think the problem is\nthat you're smart\nthe problem is that like you look around\nat the world and you see older siblings\nwho are in the gifted and talented\nprogram and you see yourself\nand you're not the problem is that you\nlook around at the world and you see\nlike\nother people who are able to do things\nthat you're not able to do\nand the problem is that your parents see\nthat too\nand that's a given in their mind and i\nthink it's those\nlittle statements which if he's saying\nthat now like i'm curious what did he\nsay to you in high school what did he\nsay to you before\nyou know it sounds like he said push\nthrough push through push through\nbut what i'm really not hearing is that\nlike he's been proud of what you've\naccomplished\nwhereas i am hearing that like you're\nstarting to be proud in what you've\naccomplished like you're not comparing\nyourself to other people what i'm\nhearing you learned in group\nis people like even when you are not\nproud of yourself\nthey are proud for you\ndoes that make sense and so how do you\nlearn\npride in yourself it's because like when\nyou don't feel proud of yourself but you\nhave done something\nto be proud of other people are proud\nfor you and when they said that to you\nlike for the first time asriel\nhow did you feel\ni think i denied it absolutely\nbecause your entire life you've been\ntaught\nthat you're not someone to be proud of\nand you're a smart kid so you learned\nthat lesson\nand now you carry it with you\nand it takes time and effort like you've\nalready started to put your\nlife together but it's i think you\nreally like it's hard to learn how to be\nproud of yourself\nbecause when you say your dad doesn't\nknow how to respond to that statement\nneither do you it's like a foreign\nconcept\nlike asriel is a good human being who\nmakes the world a better place\nis like a foreign concept\ni can logically give you a thousand\nreasons\nmaybe even convince you\nlike i could say that like like asriel\ndo you sometimes wonder if the world\nwouldn't not necessarily be a better\nplace but just that if you\ncease to exist the world would not bat\nan eyelash\ndo you ever think that way\nyes yeah i think so right so like\nwatch for it so like you showed up here\nin march of 2020 and you took\nthe waste of space that is asriel you\nshowed up we had a conversation\nand i could say that thousands or tens\nof thousands or hundreds of thousands of\npeople\nbenefited from you showing up there\nand that you're showing up today and\nyou're being\nwaste of space asriel and thousands or\ntens of thousands or hundreds of\nthousands of people\nwho have had parents like yours who have\nloved them but never been proud of them\nare beginning to realize this they're\nbeginning to realize that like oh my god\nthe way that i think about myself is\nbecause\neven though my parents loved me like\ntheir disappoint\ntheir disappointment in me was a given\nand if i were to tell you that you have\nmade all of their lives a tiny bit\nbetter\nin the same way that every person who\nhas come on stream has made your life a\ntiny bit better\nwhat would you say to that\ni don't know i i guess that's a good\nthing\nokay guess it's a good thing yes it is\nand who made that good thing possible\nyou see how hard it is it's so [ __ ]\nhard isn't it\nyou're like\nyou're trying so hard not to admit it\neven though like logically you're\ntrapped in a corner it's like\nyou feel that it's like you can't\nhave value\nlike tell me i'm wrong\nif that's what you want to tell me tell\nme i'm wrong\nexplain it to me give me all the reasons\nwhy those people are benefiting\nwhy every person on stream has helped\nyou and that help has been real\nbut you are incapable of helping anyone\nin the audience tell me\nsay what you ever like say whatever you\nwant don't let me bludgeon you fight\nback\ni don't i know really have anything to\nfight back with\nokay good\nit's just hard to\ncomprehend maybe yeah\nso that's that's that's good asriel\nthat's really good actually you can\nfight back if you feel like it if your\nmind is telling but when i fight back i\nmean like\nif your mind is saying things to you\nthat you're like dismissing\nyou can share those things but is it\nsaying things to you\nno okay how did it feel\nhow did it feel to hear me say that\nthat you are making a world the world a\nbetter place\nby being you in showing up here\nto be honest i try not to think about it\nthat just makes me nervous\nthat's really healthy\nit seemed to me like you got a little\nemotional while i was you know\ntalking yeah i i guess it just came out\nwhat emotion was that i had trouble\ntelling if that was a bad emotion or a\ngood emotion\ni don't know just\ni um i don't know\nokay i think it was good\nyeah so i i think that's just never had\nanyone do that before\ndo what before\nmaybe\nuh um validate my experience\nor like you know show me\nyou know what i'm actually doing that it\nmatters\nyeah so my hope is that it was a good\nemotion i think it was a good emotion\nand i understand why it may have been\nconfusing to you\nbecause that is what feeling valued\nfeels like\nso if i i don't really know i'm not i\nmean i can't see your emotions but like\ngenerally speaking what i was doing in\nthat moment\nwas like appreciating you for who you\nare\nand being like grateful that like you\nexist\nand and it's it's kind of sad but like\nsometimes people don't know what that\nfeels like\nright so it can be confusing the first\ntime we feel emotional i don't know if\nthat's actually what you felt or not but\nlike in this moment i'm\ndeeply grateful that you are the person\nthat you are\ni don't want you to be better i don't\nwant you to be worse\ni don't want you to be smarter i don't\nwant you to be anything except for what\nyou are\nbecause what you are is like absolutely\nenough like that's the premise\nof what we do here is that you can be as\nbroken or as perfect as you want to be\nyou can be a gigantic streamer or you\ncan be\nsomeone from our community and you can\ncome here and what you are\ncan make the world a better place\nuh i wanna\ni don't think it's that i make the world\na better place if i\njust come here and i don't do anything\nlike i have to\ndo something talk about something i\nagree\nthat's what i appreciate\nlike i appreciate what you showed up\nhere like how you showed up here and\nthat you haven't been afk for the last\nhour and a half\nright like if you had been afk like it's\nbeen hard dude like you've come here and\nyou've done something hard\nthat's what i appreciate like i don't\ncare about i mean have you achieved a\ngood result i think\nso but even if you hadn't i think it's\nthe showing up that matters\nwhat do you help me understand where you\nare mentally right now\nuh i don't\ni mean i'm understanding you but i\ndon't feel anything about it that's okay\ni think that's that's all we can hope\nfor actually so i think you felt\nsomething a little while ago\nand i think that's enough so here's what\ni'd say\ndo you have questions asriel\nuh\n[Music]\nnow i can't think of anything right now\nokay so um would it\nis it okay if i try to summarize i mean\nwe can\nin my mind i think we've reached a good\nstopping point how do you feel\nuh what time is it well i mean we still\nhave time we've got\nwe've got about 15 20 minutes left oh\nwhat that went fast\nyeah we've been at this for an hour and\na half\nokay um i i i\nif if it's okay with you i'd like to\nkind of summarize why i feel this is a\ngood stopping point and maybe like try\nto share with you what my experience of\nthis conversation is\nand then i definitely want you know if\nthere are things that we didn't get to\ni want to give you the space to say hey\nwhat about this this or this or\ni still want to know about this okay is\nthat cool\nokay so first of all you showed up here\nin march of 2020\nand you were struggling you were\noverthinking a lot you were very outcome\noriented you didn't have a whole lot of\nconfidence in yourself\nyou didn't really know how to take\naction it sounds like you've\nmade immense pro you've spent a lot of\ntime and energy\nin growing as a person you did coaching\nseems like that was good coaching helped\nyou get into therapy so it sounds like\nmaybe you had some concerns about going\nto therapy and things like that\nand and maybe coaching helped you kind\nof overcome those which is one of the\noutcomes of coaching that we're actually\nstudying now is helping people get into\ntherapy\nyou did therapy for a while it sounds\nlike you found like a pretty good cbt\ntherapist but that your sessions were a\nlittle bit\nshort they helped you you came in with a\ngoal they helped you kind of accomplish\nthat goal\nbut it also sounds like some of the\nemotional work that you were hoping to\ndo you really didn't get a chance to do\nin therapy\nyeah i think part of that was just that\ni\ndidn't because it was about the\nlike finishing school and all that more\nthan it was about\nyes it was about feeling better as well\ni don't know i mean i'll let you guys go\nyes like like i said\nyou've said several times that the the\ngoals of the therapy that you set out\nfor were accomplished\nand at the same time i'm noticing that\nmaybe you wanted something a little bit\nmore but that financial\nconstraints also kind of limited what\nyou were able to do in therapy so you\ncame back to us you found yourself in\nthe high performance group and being a\nlittle bit confused\nand maybe feeling out of sorts but that\nyou've learned\nhow to be confident essentially right\nlike\nand recognize that like even though\nobjectively you may not fit in some ways\nthat you have value in the group and you\ncan make meaningful contributions\neven though you're still a student and\nsome people in there\nhave started companies with you\nso now when we when you came on here we\nwere talking about this pattern right\nthat you've actually started to make a\nlot of progress\nin your outward life you're actually in\nthe process of putting your life\ntogether\nin a very real way you finished two\nyears of college\nyou are trying to get a job or you got a\njob you didn't show up and\nand whatnot that's okay once again you\nknow you're on your journey\num and the main\nthing that maybe you could use help with\nis that even though you've started to\npush aside some of those negative\nfeelings\nyou actually through your own\nintrospective work have discovered\nthat you have some degree of toxic\nproductivity that you kind of like\npush past some of those feelings and you\nactually use shame and like a sense of\nlike oh i'm so pathetic to drive\nyourself forward\nin a very like outward way but that\nthere's still this internal stuff that\nlike\nis hard to deal with although i'm\nhearing that on a day-to-day mood\nbasis that you're actually feeling like\nsomewhat better than a year ago\nso i yeah can i\nadd like um i was wondering you\nmentioned at the beginning that there\nwas another way to overcome that hump\nwithout the shame i was just wondering\nyou know what that was\nyeah so there's alternate coping\nmechanisms to overcome\nthe negative emotion and there is\nlowering the burden of negative emotion\nokay so the alternate coping mechanisms\nwould be like\nlet me just think of an example so like\na simple like so when we talk about\ndharma right like you can do\nthings out of dharma or you can do them\nout of toxic productivity okay\nso that's sort of like you know you show\nup to the job and you just see what you\ncan do\ntype of thing yeah so that i think is\nmore action orientation but not see what\nyou can do\nthat's a step in the right direction\nthat's moving away from an outcome\norientation to an action orientation i\nwould say dharma is like when you show\nup\nlike you're showing up for like a reason\nbesides toxic productivity\nso like this is where this is where like\nyou know you show up and then you kind\nof say to yourself\ni'm not saying you should say this it's\njust the only thing that comes to your\nmind\nlet's say hypothetically you're going to\ncome on stream one year later\nand then like what you're saying is like\ni need to like learn how to do this\nso that when i share things with people\nwho are like where i was i can like help\nthem\nunderstand what this process is like i\nhave to learn how to be okay in this job\nso that if i ever meet someone else\nwho's like struggling like i can help\nthem\nlike i get that you want to be a marine\nbiologist but let's say like you decided\nyou wanted to become a psychologist and\nif you want to help people who's\nyou know who are struggling with that\nlike you you have some broader\nlike purpose that matters to you so you\ncan say like okay i need to make money\nso that i can support xyz\nso their motivations besides toxic\nproductivity basically\nokay and then what we did today was\num talking about sort of how i haven't\nfelt pride and then\nthat would be dealing with the bump that\ni have to overcome\nabsolutely right so like what is that\nemotional energy that you have to\novercome\nwith toxic productivity and that i think\nis\nis so you mentioned a bunch of emotions\nright you said sadness i realize that\nthere's sadness and there's\nfear and there's you know shame but\nbased on talking to you what i'm really\nhearing is that like somewhere like\nreally at the core of it\ni think asriel is like just the sense\nthat you're not worth much\nyou know and and i think that there have\nbeen times in your life and it didn't it\ndidn't take you long\nto kind of say how long have you felt\nthat way fourth grade and i think that's\nwhen it start\nlike that's like the first time that i\ndon't think you understood that then but\nwhen i ask you the question now like\nyou're able to go back to fourth grade\nand kind of say\nthis is the first time that like i\nreally felt like someone didn't\nbother to think about me\ni think it was the first time i think it\nwas just\na more extreme example yeah okay so\nthat's\neven more devastating right because that\nmeans it happened before that\nand and so then we kind of got to\ntalking a little bit about like you know\nhow did you come to believe that you\n[Music]\naren't worth being proud of\nand so this is where we got into the dad\nbashing once again i don't i'm not\ntrying to bash your dad it's just i\nthink sometimes as parents\nwe all do this like i do this to my kids\nwe say things to them that have\npsychological impacts because no one is\na perfect parent\nand and the psychological impacts\ndespite the love\ndespite the caring despite the sacrifice\nbecause it sounds like objectively your\ndad was a really good dad\nyou respect him a lot you love him a lot\nit sounds like he started to like\nreshape his life and even put his\nromantic interests aside\nto care for you guys\nand you know we're not even gonna get to\nlike what he thought about your stepdad\nand whether he heard about that and all\nthat kind of crap\nbut well i i\nhe definitely thought that you know my\nstepdad was a bit of a meathead\nyeah so i'm hearing that your dad really\nput his life on hold and made a lot of\nsacrifices\nto try to help you guys as much as\npossible and he's actually a really good\ndad\nand he never told you he was proud of\nyou\nand that even though he blames himself\nit's still sort of like he still kind of\nbelieves that you're kind of like\nyou know you're in the bargain bin of\nchildren\nwhich is like such a devastating thing\nto feel right there's the gifted and\ntalented siblings and then there's you\nand so like i think that like it's it's\ndevastating it makes me feel like an\n[ __ ] saying that phrase i've never\nsaid that before but it feels so\ndevastating\nand if that's what you kind of grew up\nwith that's why you believe that about\nyourself\nright you've been conditioned and now\nhopefully through group and some of\nthese other experiences you can learn to\nactually recognize and like\neven when i sort of said like asriel\nlike you are making the world a better\nplace by existing\ni mean not just by existing because like\nyou're doing more than existing\nright even if you may not have become\nquote unquote\noverwhelmingly successful the fact that\nyou are on\nthis journey in the fact that you do put\nyourself outside of your comfort zone\nand like you do genuinely enrich and\nand improve the world around you and\nit's not because of performance it's\nlike because you just show up\nand you give it all you've got and\nthat's all\nthe world needs from you it's just for\nyou to be you and give it all you've got\nthe world doesn't need you to be you and\ngive it nothing\nright then you really are like not\ndelivering value well when i show up and\ni give it all i got\num you know i i often feel like it's not\nenough\nyeah that's the intrinsic value isn't it\nabsolutely well perfect\nright because like because you're\nstarting from a basis\nof like i'm in the bargain bin\nand and so like no matter like how good\nof a find you get in the bargain bin\nas long as you remember oh i got this\nfrom the bargain bin you're gonna\nactually like\nyou know it's like a little bit scuffed\ngot it on discount whereas no like\nit's a steal dude it's like worth every\npenny and worth way more than i paid for\nit\nyour value is actually far above what\nyou estimate it to be\nand so going forward i i encourage you\nto really like\nyou know ask yourself when you as you\nstart to introspect and you start to\nfeel these negative emotions like\ndoes this come back to you know i'm not\nvaluable\nand and to try to see and this is going\nto be the really hard part is like there\nare going to be times in your life where\nyou\nare valuable because and i think you've\nstarted to discover this\nbut even if i tell you you're gonna push\nback like when you show up\nin group like you help people\nwhat do you think about that\ni don't\nit's so hard oh my god you told me\nearlier in this conversation that i\nrealize now that i can still make\ncontributions\nyeah but it's but yeah right i don't\nknow if those contributions help\nnecessarily yes beautiful right i make\ncontributions but oh they're not as\nvaluable as other people's\nit's so hard to just be like no you're\nyou do good damn you\nand that's me bludgeoning you so it's\nit's gonna take time so be patient with\nyourself faster be patient okay\nlike it's fine to have that voice it's\nfine to like no matter what we send it\njust see how it's like always gonna like\ncontort and twist and just like devalue\nlike because like that\nit just doesn't compute in your mind\nright like it doesn't compute in your\nmind that you could show up somewhere\nlike have an impact on another human\nbeing\nit's like um it's like i'm in the matrix\ni'm neo-dodging the bullets\nabsolutely dude and just like the matrix\nit's completely op\nit's like boston it's completely unfair\nto those of us who are sending you the\nbullets of appreciation\nit's like we don't stand a chance\nagainst that man\nyeah you're dodging you're really good\nand i i think you know you you do this a\nlot right so then the last thing that\ni'll kind of leave you with\nis this sort of idea of like what amount\nto blame\nand just be careful about where you\nassign it and how you protect people\nbecause like\ndude come on man like i i'm pretty sure\nthat so chad is learning this blows my\nmind\ni'm pretty sure that when when you\nliterally said that your stepdad\nyou know had a lot of challenges like\neveryone knew that abuse was coming\nlike you know like we've heard it enough\ntimes\nright like let's not even get started on\nyour mom and like we just had an\ninterview like on wednesday about you\nknow\nblaming the good parent for\nor trying really hard not to hold the\ngood parent responsible for like\nletting the bad parent do things to you\nand just to add to that i think in the\nend she did\nstart to stand up for us you know\num there was a breakup and then he moved\nout for a bit\nand then they went to a therapist and\ntried to work through it\nand they got back together and so\nthere's definitely growth on her part\ntoo yeah\nyeah good what does that mean for you\ndon't know right so yes i'm still here\nyeah so like there's a part of me that\nwants to say too little too late\nbut you'll push back against that right\ni think you said that last time too\nwhat was i talking about your mom nope\nwell you're talking about\nthat relationship same thing okay pretty\nmuch\nanyway we don't have to get into it but\nthat's that's where like i think so\nasriel i think like dude you're well on\nyour journey it sounds like you've made\na lot of external change\nand and what i really think is that\nsomething tells me that i don't know if\nyou're interested in a romantic\nrelationship if you're in a romantic\nrelationship but like this is the kind\nof thing that as you start to work on i\nthink a romantic relationship will\nbecome\nmore available and also like easier to\nexist within\nyeah but but i think when it comes to\ndating like if people who\nfeel intrinsically like they have very\nlittle value have a lot of trouble\nin dating because it's very confusing\nwhen someone seems to be genuinely\ninterested in them\nand then they're just like they don't\nknow like like you know that when i tell\nyou something and you like you just\ncan't\nyou just gotta say button and like so\nthat\nso so this is the kind of thing where i\nthink like continue growing man and just\nkind of notice this like\nyou know continue making the world a\nbetter place as you are\nand like you know learn how to be proud\nof yourself\nand then if one day you know\nif you grow a pair you can ask your dad\nif he's proud of you\nand it may be a hard question that asks\nand it may be a hard question to answer\nbut we'll get there one day\ni was joking about growing a pair i\nthink you're actually very brave\nis it was a twitch memeing i just wanted\nto clarify i wasn't sure if\ni would be interpreted the wrong way\nbecause it just occurred to me that\nmaybe with the way that you interpret\nthings\nyou know thoughts\nquestions before we wrap up\ni think that's about it in regards to\ntheir relationships\ni'm not i don't have one and i'm not\ncurrently looking\ni think there's definitely a lot of\nfear and confusion around that as well\nso yeah i think you're right\nyep so i i think as you work through\nthis\nthe relationship will come\nso don't don't worry about it just keep\nwalking what you're walking and i'm\nconfident\nthat you'll end up happy\nand in a place where you're you know\nyou're good\nall right do you want to meditate\nwe can try it i've done some of your\nmeditations on previous streams but\ni haven't noticed it have much effect on\nme\nwould you can you help me understand\nwhat your experience of those\nmeditations\nis\ni think uh sometimes maybe i feel\nsomething a little bit but it's\nlike like i know sometimes chat mentions\nyou know they had this crazy experience\nand for me it's like\ni don't know nothing really changed that\nmuch i still\nfeel the same way okay maybe my thoughts\nare a little less\nbut what what usually happens when you\nmeditate what's your experience of\nmeditating\ni think maybe i get a little bit calmer\num\nmaybe a little more relaxed but nothing\nno\ndo you think when you meditate\nsometimes i guess it depends on the\nmeditation\nall right let me think\ni was thinking um if you had anything to\nsay\nwhen i get extremely anxious or\nsomething something that could like\nground me\nin that moment so i don't get carried\naway\nwhat happens when you get extremely\nanxious\ntell me about that\ni think i just like my mind wanders i\nstart thinking about everything\nyou know i try to prepare as much as i\ncan i get really stressed\num that's where\nyou know i have that nervous meltdown in\nfront of the job site\nthat's where i try to suppress it with\nfrustration towards myself\num okay have you tried\npracticing kapalbhati or the rapid\nexhalations\nhave you done that before\nyeah i think so so\ni would say and how many\nokay so let's for people for whom\nmeditation hasn't really worked on\nstream let's just go through a couple of\nbasics okay\nthe first is that meditation is a skill\nthat sometimes requires practice\nso what we try to do on stream so\nthe reason we teach different meditation\ntechniques on stream is because\ndifferent people will naturally\nhopefully have a good experience in\nmeditation\nusing a particular technique the\nchallenge is that\num you know when it comes to the scope\nof techniques that i teach\ni teach probably like 10 to 15 percent\nof what i would use\nwith people that i work with on a\nregular basis\nand that's because these are the\ntechniques which are like easy\naccessible and you can't really screw up\nthey also so there there's like a whole\nhost of other techniques which are\nyou know more dangerous but are also\nmore powerful\nthere's a whole host of techniques that\nrequire more guidance\nor like subsequent amounts of teaching\nto really anchor people into practice so\nwe're really kind of handicapped\nin some ways um\nso what i would say for\nyou is that we should practice\nkapalbhati again let's give it another\nshot\ni'll actually guide you through it so\nit's going to be rapid exhalations and\nthat's mainly because\nit's a physiologic technique so like\nwhen you're feeling\nanxious like that your sympathetic\nnervous system is going to be active\nso you're going to have adrenaline and\nthings like that so there's a really\ninteresting way to rein in your\nsympathetic nervous system which is to\nbecome actually\ntemporarily hypocarbic so what we're\ngoing to do is rapidly exhale\nwhich is going to decrease the co2 level\nand when your co2 level drops that\nactually is going to change your\nrespiratory drive and really slow you\ndown\nso hopefully it'll kind of crack the\noverthinking cycle\nby like literally sort of like shutting\noff your mind\nover time yeah go ahead that's like the\none where it's sort of like\nhyperventilating\nyou know isn't it yes exactly have you\ndone that one before\nsounds like you have yeah yeah i didn't\nthink\nonce or twice so so the other thing for\nwhatever reason i don't know why this is\nactually i do know why this is but it's\nso people will say like even when they\nwatch meditation on stream\nand then when i actually do it with them\non stream that sometimes it has a\ndifferential effect\nnot quite sure why that is i have\ntheories or things written in ancient\ntexts\num but you know for now let's just give\nit a shot because i think and i would\njust encourage you to practice the\ntechnique because it's sort of like\nyou know swimming isn't great exercise\nthe first time you get in the water you\nhave to like learn how to swim\nand then it can be a very healthy form\nof exercise\nlong term what i would strongly\nrecommend asriel is you probably need to\ndo some kind of\nsun gulp oriented meditation so i would\nsay if you have a set of prayer beads\nfantastic if not get one\nand like this is one of those things\nwhere you need to start like internally\nwiring\nyou're like rewiring like the way that\nyou think about yourself\nokay um\n[Music]\nand i'm trying to think about so there's\nsome kind of sun gulp around worth\nbut let me just think about\nlet me just think\nyeah i i'm gonna have to think about\nwhat that sun gulp will be\ni may dm you if it comes to all right\nyeah i am i do have a bracelet i can't\nthere it is it's not really\nit's not really a prayer beads\ni don't know get through here get prayer\nbees\nall right yeah let me just think about\nlet's do kapalbhati today and let me\njust give me just like 30 seconds to try\nto come up with some cup and then i'll\nthat's not it\nyeah i i can't think of anything in this\nmoment but sometimes i\ni think of these things actually when i\nmeditate\nit it's just\nyeah let me just i'm drawing a blank\nit's like right at the edge\ni feel it it's just not coming to so\nlet's stick with kaupalpathi okay\nlet me just send you a random dm at some\npoint though\num all right so\nso with kapalbhati you may want to blow\nyour nose\nwe've got boogies and stuff if not gg\nall right one sec\nokay so sit up straight\nand remember we're gonna do abdominal\nbreathing\nso do you remember how to do so for\npeople who need a guide what we're going\nto do is\nas we inhale we're going to push the\nstomach out\nso expand your abdomen\nand as you exhale pull the abdomen in\ncontract good so breathe in and pull the\nabdomen out\nbig big belly and then exhale\nand then let the abdomen come in\nokay now we're going to do the\nkapalbhati part so we're going to take a\ndeep breath and it's going to be\nrapid exhalations i'll demonstrate for\nabout nine rounds okay so i'll take a\ndeep breath\nin\n[Laughter]\nokay and when you do it what i want you\nto do is focus on your stomach\nand you can like almost like spasm that\nstomach and push that air out\nokay so let's have you do it let me just\nobserve you so deep breath in and do\nlike nine breaths\ngood perfect okay so now we're gonna do\nit together we're gonna do\nlet's start with 15 okay so it's going\nto be 15 breaths\nthere's going to be a period of silence\nwhere you're going to just\nlet your breathing do what it wants to\ndon't necessarily\ntry to think but also don't get too\ntense about\nyou know pushing thoughts out of your\nhead just let them come and let them go\nand just sit\nin the space post meditation okay we'll\ndo 15 breaths we'll sit for about 30\nseconds\ni'll bring you back after that okay so\ntake a deep breath in and begin\nall right you can leave your eyes closed\nnow we're going to go to\n20 so 20 breaths\nfollowed by a period of silence deep\nbreath in\nand begin\nokay now we're gonna go up to\nwhen you're ready go ahead come on back\nof course what was that like for you\ni didn't notice that uh maybe i got a\nlittle lightheaded at the end\nwhich i guess was the point\num i don't know i feel calmer\nyeah so i'd practice i'd say 33 breaths\nthree times so you want to work your\nway up to like 33 exhalations maybe a\nminute\nor two in between for a total of like\nsomewhere around five to seven minutes\nof practice\nokay i might have um\nmessed up the beginning because i\nthought you meant like 15 like\nbreathe in and do the out nine times\nfour or fifteen times oh that's fine\ni mean yeah that wasn't that wasn't what\ni was saying but you know that's a lot\nwhich is fine yeah so like i'd say 33\nexhalations for\none set and do three sets\nlike raps and sets so 33 reps\none is one set and then you know if\nyou're starting to\nhave like help if you're starting to\nfeel anxious\nyou know if you find yourself once again\nat like that job kind of situation i'd\nstart with kapalbhati\nyou can add on alternate nostril\nbreathing afterward for about five to\nseven minutes and hopefully that'll calm\nyou down unless you're having like a\ntruly clinical panic attack\nin which case that may be insufficient\nbut it still helps\nokay and then just you know calm it down\nand then by the time you get your prayer\nbeads i will hopefully have something\nfor you\nso go find some and if it takes you six\nmonths then i've got six months if it\ntakes you\na month then that's how long i've got\nokay uh what are the requirements for\nthe prayer beads like would i need\nactual ones\nor yeah so i would get some kind of\nset of like any religious tradition\nprayer beats so like if you\nhave a catholic background you can get a\nrosary\nif you don't i would recommend something\nfrom like the meditative traditions so\nlike buddhism or hindu or whatever you\ncan get like amala from\nyou know wherever um\nyou know be careful about the\nfashionable ones\nso i know it's kind of hard but try to\nget something that feels a little bit\nauthentic ideally if there's actually\nlike\ni don't know where you live but if\nthere's like a buddhist monastery or\ntemple somewhere near you\ni would call them and say hey do you\nguys have like a place that i can get\nsome prayer beads\num maybe we just need to\nnote to self okay\ngotta think about getting those for\ny'all but\num but that's that's what i would\nrecommend\nyeah i yeah\nand then you can abduct me into the\ncults yeah\nwe will induct it the abduction comes\nfor the people who are not willing to be\ninducted\nso you're okay the abduction comes for\nyour siblings\nabduction and induction very different\nvery different\nright so asriel thanks a lot for coming\non man\nit's been awesome to see how much you've\nhow far you've come\nand you know good luck with the rest of\nyour journey bro\nyeah thank you take care\nall right you too\nchat\nyou"
