    "transcript": "okay\ntrying to be honest with my therapist\nbut not so honest that i get\ninvoluntarily hospitalized\nokay so we're going to talk a little bit\nabout\ninvoluntary hospitalization this is just\ngonna be kind of educational all right\nso first question chat is what is the\ngoal of hospitalization\ny'all know so like the goal of\nhospitalization is\nis really for like safety and\nstabilization so i know this sounds kind\nof weird but like\n99 of\npatients who have come into my office\nand said i have suicidal thoughts\ni have not hospitalized okay so\ninvoluntary\nhospitalization is really only you\nshould be used in only like drastic\ncases where there's like\nan acutely elevated risk of safety so\ni've worked with people who have been\nsuicidal\nfor like a year and they'll come to my\noffice and they're like\ni'm thinking about killing myself and i\nstill may not hospitalize them in fact i\nusually don't\nso the main issue is whether there is an\nacute elevation\na temporary elevation of your risk that\nis very problematic in that moment\nand if the answer to that question is\nyes\nthen we will consider involuntary\nhospitalization or at least me\npersonally\nso that's also where i would think about\nvoluntary hospitalization so most of the\npeople that i've worked with like will\ndo a voluntary hospitalization which is\nwe'll i'll talk to them right and like\nour goal so when i work with my patients\nwe have a shared goal the shared goal is\nnot to you know keep them living life\nthat is miserable\nthe shared goal is to try to help people\nbuild a life that is worth living\nso if i feel like they are so mentally\nill to where they're like acutely at\ndanger to themselves\nthen i may involuntarily hospitalize\nthem but generally speaking\nyou know psychiatrists and therapists\nare not there to hospitalize you against\ntheir will that's not what we're there\nfor\nwe're there to try to help you and just\nbecause you're suicidal doesn't actually\nmean that you belong in a hospital like\nat least\ni mean it depends on what kind of\nsuicidality so we'll go over that in a\nsecond but\nyou know really the the question is can\nyou is the is the risk to yourself so\ngreat\nthat you need to be in a controlled\nenvironment for a temporary period of\ntime\nand so this is where you know when i\nwork with people like i think about\nthe following factors one is\nis there a temporary elevation to the\nrisk\ndo you have means or access to kill\nyourself\ndo you have a plan to kill yourself so\nlike some people\nare like i just want to die they don't\nreally have any plan to do something\nwhereas other people are and if i ask\nthem like you know do you have a plan of\nwhat you would do they'd be like\nyeah i jump off the golden gate bridge\nand i'm like the golden great\nbridge is in san francisco and you're in\nboston so\nwould you buy a ticket and fly they're\nlike yeah i haven't really thought it\nthrough\ni'm like great so you probably don't\nneed to be hospitalized in that\nsituation\nso the the first thing to remember is\nthat you know our goal is not to\nhospitalize you against your will and\njust because you're suicidal doesn't\nmean that we're going to hospitalize you\nit of course is a case-by-case basis\ndifferent clinicians have different\nthresholds\ni tend to be like a big believer in\npatient autonomy\nand and sort of like you know so i i\nthink that it's my job to really i mean\nsometimes i'll involuntarily hospitalize\npeople because i\ni don't think that their mind is working\nproperly and so we'll do something\ncalled a capacity eval to see if their\ntheir mind is actually functioning in a\nway that's processing information\nor they're too depressed to be able to\nprocess information\nbut just because you're suicidal doesn't\nmean that we're going to hospitalize you\nin fact like\nour goal is to help you not be\nhospitalized\nright so when i think about my job as a\npsychiatrist\nmy job is to keep you out of the\nhospital if possible\nright so if you think about that's the\njob of all doctors like if you go to a\nprimary care\nphysician and you've got like an\ninfection\nthe goal of the doctor is to keep you\nfrom needing to go to the hospital\nlike we don't want to get this to a\npoint where you're septic the infection\nis like\nflowing through your bloodstream and\nlike you know it's affecting your entire\nbody the goal is to keep you out of the\nhospital\nit's not about cost savings for the\ninsurance company things like that\nthat's not what i'm talking about\nwhat i'm talking about is generally\nspeaking we want to keep people\nto a minimal level of illness\nright so our goal and so the this is\nwhere i'd strongly encourage you to talk\nto your provider\nif you're having suicidal thoughts\nbecause it's their job to help you be\nsafe it's their job to help you\nlike deal with those thoughts hopefully\nyou know so you no longer have them or\nthey're like much more controlled or way\neasier to deal with\nbecause that's our job but if you don't\ntell us because you're afraid of being\nhospitalized like\nyeah you could be hospitalized it's\npossible but if you don't tell us\nthen like we can't help you with them\nand the hospital is not really what we\nwant to do like that's not our go-to\nit's like a\nlast resort that being said you know\nthere are some\nproviders who for medical legal reasons\nor you know personal thresholds may\nbe have a lower threshold to hospitalize\npeople i\nyou know i can't speak for everyone um\nbut generally speaking i think that you\nknow if you have suicidal thoughts like\nyou should tell your provider and then\nyour provider will sort of ask you\ncertain questions\nthis is the other thing i know it sounds\nshocking\nbut also if your provider wants to\nhospitalize you\nyou got to really think about why they\nwant to\nright because as trained professionals\nwe sort of know\nwhat the risks are and so if you're like\nreally high risk for suicidal like\nan actual suicide attempt and your\nprovider is telling you to do that\nmaybe you should go right because like\nthey kind of know what they're talking\nabout and\nour goal really is to help you stay\nalive and stay healthy\nso you know don't hesitate to share your\nyour\nyour suicidal thoughts with your\nprovider this is also where like we like\nwe said we think about\nacute elevations so has something really\ndrastic happen to you did you just get\ndumped\nyou know do you have access to suicidal\nmeans and that also is because if you\nlook at it eighty percent\nof suicide attempts were cons\nlike actually the decision was made\nwithin two to five minutes\ni think maybe sixty percent is made\nwithin 60 to 120 seconds of the attempt\nso if you ask survivors of suicide\nattempts and you ask them when did you\nactually decide\nthat you were gonna kill yourself sixty\npercent of them i think\nsay within one or two minutes and eighty\npercent of them will say within five\nminutes of the attempt\nso it's a very common myth that most\npeople will plan out\ntheir suicide attempt over a long period\nof time that's why we ask so much about\naccess to stuff so if you have a gun in\nthe home the problem is that\nif you have this idea and within 60\nseconds you've got the gun you may\nactually pull the trigger\nso we try to control means if you have\nto book a ticket to san francisco\nlike for next tuesday the likelihood\nthat that attempt will happen is\nstatistically way lower according to the\nresearch as\nas i understand it anyway based on my\nlast reading of it\nand so that's why you know when the\nprovider tells you hey i really want you\nto go to the hospital\nthey're not necessarily worried in that\nmoment what they're actually thinking\nhopefully\nis like what is the likelihood that that\nlittle voice in your head\nactually takes control of you for like\nup to five minutes\nand if the little voice that you fight\nagainst on a daily basis can take\ncontrol of you in five minutes\nwhat is the worst damage it can actually\ndo to you\nthat is our threshold to hospitalize\nbecause when that risk\ngets too high that's when we really\nthink about hospitalizing\nand even then like what i'll do i mean\ni've had cases where people have had\nvery high risk situations and it sort of\nbecomes like an issue of trust where\ni'll explain this to them and say\ni trust you now i get that you're\ntelling me that you're not actually\ngoing to do anything\ni'm concerned that you could change your\nmind in the middle of the night so let's\nget rid of the gun\nso i'll talk to the person they'll talk\nto their spouse or mom or whatever\nand i tell them what i need to be\nreassured is like i need your mom to be\nwith you and you all need to get rid of\nthe gun together and the three of us are\ngoing to talk about it\nand so as if we can be assured that you\ndon't have access anymore to make an\nimpulsive decision\nbecause most suicide attempts are\nactually impulsive decisions\nthen we can sort of like you know keep\nyou safe and if we can keep you safe on\nthe outside then\nyou know we don't need to hospitalize\nyou the last thing that\ni know it's shocking but hospitalization\nis not a magical cure for suicidality\nso this is the other reason that i tend\nto be really careful about when to\nhospitalize people is because i really\nhave to ask myself what's going to\nchange within one week\nnow if you just got dumped by your\npartner and you're like acutely suicidal\nthen like\nabsolutely in a week you could process a\nlot you could be in a different head\nspace\nso by all means like move towards\nhospitalization so this is where the the\nother thing that we talk a lot about in\npsychiatry is\na chronically elevated risk of\nsuicidality which does not necessarily\nwarrant hospitalization\nsome people have a chronically elevated\nrisk of suicidality\nwhich means that they're sort of\nconstantly like high risk to be\nsuicidal and even if it's scary it\ndoesn't necessarily mean that you need\nto be hospitalized because it's unclear\nlike what will happen over the course of\nthe 10 days that you're in the hospital\nif it's not going to actually make an\nimpact we just\npersonally we just kind of ride out the\nrisk right we talk about it\nwe i'll oftentimes try to talk to a\npatient's family member spouse or\nparents or something like that we say\nhey here's the situation\nwhat do you guys want to do we can try\nhospitalization we cannot try\nhospitalization\nand based on my assessment this is a\nchronically elevated risk\nis it scary absolutely but i don't know\nthat hospitalizing you for five days is\ngoing to change something\nyeah so rihanna's saying my first time\ncalling the suicide hotline was last\nthursday\ngood that you called and don't hesitate\nto call again\nand like go to the emergency room if\nyou're feeling like you're in a bad spot\nso this is the thing is like remember\nhospitalization is sort of like\nit's like it it's it's basically the alt\nfor the psychiatry profession right like\nwe don't spam your alt\nyou can't spam your all doesn't do any i\nmean i guess theoretically would be good\nto spam your all but like\nthat's not it's a bad analogy i suppose\nso it's it's you know it's it's like\nthis thing that's on a cool down for in\norder for it to be effective\nyou know but i guess it's in games if\nyou could spam your all you would but\nthat's not how we work in psychiatry so\ni need a different analogy\nit's like it's like a cool down that\nlike you know\nit's like blood magic let's say like\nwhere you like lose a portion of your hp\nto like cast a powerful spell\nbut you can't spam that [ __ ] so\ngenerally speaking i try not to spam\nhospitalization and use it only when\nnecessary\nyeah it's lay on hands yeah so shrapnel\nsacrifice that's what constitutes a\nsuicide attempt providers ask me about\nmy past attempts\ni've been told that having the means and\nalmost doing it doesn't count as an\nattempt\ni don't know so this is where like\nproviders are going to be different\nyou know some people will say it counts\nas an attempt some people will say it\nwon't count as an attempt\ni think about so what i do is i do a\nrisk formulation so it's not so much\nabout\nyou know what is or isn't it's not\nbinary\nit's like a risk assessment that's on a\nscale\nso is this person low risk medium risk\nhigh risk chronically elevated risk\nacutely elevated risk like there's a lot\nof dimensions to assessing risk\nright and this is where we talk about\nmeans history\ncurrent mindset circumstances current\nstressors\nall those kinds of things kind of factor\nin dazzle actually dazzle\nis is a great example of what a\nhospitalization is\nthat's beautiful dean 77944\nthat's actually the best gaming analogy\ni can think of\nso if you guys play dota you know this\nbut if you don't there's a hero named\ndazzle who has an ability called\nit's not as alt but it's it's shallow\ngrave is what i was thinking\num where shallow grave like it doesn't\nheal you but it prevents you from dying\nfor a temporary period of time\nand so when you like shallow grave\nsomeone like you can keep them alive for\nlike you know a certain period of time\nbut like they're not actually going to\nbe healed\nso as soon as shallow grave ends if they\ntake\nyou know any damage they could still die\nso what i think about a hospitalization\nis sort of like a shallow grave so it's\nlike a temporary measure that keeps you\nalive\nbut in my experience hospitalization can\nsometimes fix things\nbut it's really about like healing you\nback to full that's the important part\naxe chocolate i knew i knew axe\ni knew calling blade was going to come\nup i knew it\ni don't i don't know what the i don't\nknow the sort of the analogy falls apart\nmax's blink axe is on your team chat"
