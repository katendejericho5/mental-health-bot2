    "transcript": "so do you want me to help you stop\ncrying\nyeah sure i'm asking it's a genuine\nquestion\nyeah i'm hinted\nokay um i'll give a second cause now\ni've got to figure out how i'm gonna do\nthat\nwelcome\num thank you sorry i'm really nervous\nactually\nyeah most people tend to be nervous\nwe'll we'll we'll get over that don't\nworry about it bro\num so and why don't you start by telling\nme what do you go by\num i'm uh i'm struggling to i i probably\ndon't want to\nuh reveal my real name on stream just\nyeah um\nsomething like doc okay that's totally\nfine man yeah that's why i just ask you\nknow i'm not it's just like what do you\nwant me to call you so doc is totally\nfine\nso no problem what were you hoping to\ntalk about today or what are we talking\nabout bro\num so as\nas you've already properly titled it's\num i do have\ni would say it's just a very uh\ni don't know it's a probably just a\ntraumatic experience uh\nafter another it's pretty much my whole\nlife and\nat least for like the first half of it\nand then a little bit of like what's\nbeen going on\nrecently okay um and\nto a degree maybe my um\nobviously i can say for sure but it\nfeels like i have a very uh\nunnatural reaction to it almost and\njust the way that i've been dealing with\nit is it's um\ni've sort of been troubling i've been\nsort of troubled with um\nhow do i say that just in general how to\neven approach others about my own [ __ ]\nif that makes sense\nhow to approach others about the things\nthat you internally deal with\nyeah mostly because i\ntend to be very open about what happens\nto me\nokay in a in a way that's not very\ni would say that outwardly doesn't\nreally seem very emotional\num and it's it feels like there's like a\ndisconnect between who i am now and who\ni was\njust a few yeah just a few years ago i\nwould say\ncan you tell me who you are now\num it feels like now nowadays\num i'm kind of living in\nperson almost like it's it feels like\ni'm basically just uh\nsomeone who's watching my own life\nhappening um i don't really have\ni don't really have like um um\ni don't know like i don't feel like my\nlife is very important in that\nlike not in a depressed kind of way like\nnot and i'm not saying i feel suicidal\nas much as i'm saying but it feels like\num\ni don't really i feel like i would\nrather\num help someone else fix their life and\nfix my own\ni think that's a good way i think that's\na good way to say that\nso would it be fair to say that you're\nnot you don't feel\ninvested in your own life\nyeah that's a pretty good way to say\nthat i think okay\nso you're just kind of like a person\nyeah go ahead um i would say i'm the\ntype of person who would rather clean up\nyour room than my own if that makes\nsense\nso you put others ahead of yourself\nyeah um and in a way i do believe that\nthat's like\nthe only thing that keeps me happy\nanymore um\nlike i don't it's rare for me to just be\nhappy on my own\nor um to feel happy because something\nhappened\nfor me if it makes sense yep um stupid\nexample i made 10k on crypto\njust like from investments and i didn't\nfeel anything about it i didn't feel\nanything\nyeah right um\nbut i never felt anything about it up\nuntil i basically started telling people\num who are close to me who know that\nthey're going to get some of it and\nthat's when i started getting a little\nbit happy about it i see so like\nlike the money doesn't mean much to you\nbut like\nwhen it can help the people around you\nyeah\nit it that's when you start to feel\nhappy yeah\nand i don't know i just don't feel very\ngoal um goal oriented anymore\nsure um it's like\ni guess for the gamers out there i could\nsay it's like uh i went from being an\neddie carrie main to\nyou me support okay i don't know exactly\nwhat that means but i i can follow the\ngist of it maybe i became the healer\nyeah so maybe let me ask you in a\ndifferent way would you say that like\nyou no longer have main quest\nand you're just doing side quests yeah\nexactly\nactually that's funny so that's kind of\nhow i was describing it to one of my\nbest friends\nyesterday it's just it's just random\nside quests\nyeah exactly and and it sounds like it\nhasn't always been this way you said\nthat a few years ago maybe it was\ndifferent\nyeah um i would say\nmaybe like everything like for five\nyears it's been like this um\nbefore that i used to be at least\ncompetitive to some extent i was always\nlike\nsort of the way i am now but now it\nfeels like uh i'm continuing what i've\nstarted if that makes sense\nsure uh before that i felt like\nthere was some drive behind it like i\nactually tried to be\num i don't know i i try to be\nsomeone who's got a presence in people's\nlife who was um\nand just someone who had like his own\ngoals if that makes sense like\ni was very excited to be independent i\nwas excited to be\nwhat i'm trying what i'm still trying to\nbe a teacher that's what i'm going for\nright now it's what i'm studying for\nbut nowadays it just everything just\nkind of feels like it's just happening\nlike\ni close my eyes and five minutes later\nit's uh i'm a year older and nothing\nhappened if that makes sense\nyeah um like life is passing you by\nexactly um i'm not even necessarily sad\nabout it and that's what's scaring me\nlike\ni feel like yeah i don't know it's kind\nof like\njust happening and i don't really feel\ninvested in my own life anymore i'm just\ninvested in for example what my little\nsister is doing\nwhat uh what my friends are doing um to\nsome\nto some degree and and i'm very\nyeah just just like a side note i don't\nreally know how to like incorporate it\ninto\nlike how to just bring it up so i'll\njust say it the way it is\num i'm i also have this weird structure\nbut i don't see many people having but\nmaybe some people here do\num in a way i feel like i'm a narcissist\nwho also\nhates himself like nothing else if it\nmakes sense like i'm the person who i\nhate and love her most in my entire life\ncan you tell me about that sure\num for example like about the\nloving myself part it's something that\ndoesn't really need context i just feel\nlike\nin general i have a i have an ability to\nget on people's level very well i think\ni do have\num i mean i mean it does sound like i'm\nlike\num like narcissistic but i feel like i\nhave a very\ngood amount of like social intelligence\nif that makes sense um\ni think i'm i can't really think of any\nfriend circle i'm in where i'm not at\nleast somewhat of a prominent person\nokay and it's not because just it's not\nbecause i'm\nsomeone who's so just who sticks out so\nmuch but people just\nwant to know me it's more like i just\nget to know other people and then they\neventually\njust know know me because of that like\nyeah\nand it's just something that i i feel\nlike i have a little bit\ni have it's like the only thing that i\nhave proud like pride over\nthe fact that i can understand and\nget along with like pretty much anyone\num i have a very uh\nwide set of friends uh i it goes from\nlike [ __ ] posters on the internet to um\npeople who i've been studying with in my\nuniversity to also people who are like\nbasically bottom of a society um\nin terms of like sure\nlike here just from being infamous like\nthey're not bad people and it's just\nuh it's hard to explain like it's good\npeople in bad positions i would say\nokay so doc let me ask you a question so\nwhat i heard you just described as sort\nof like\nan assessment that you're pretty good\nsocially i'm confused about what that\nhas to do with being a narcissist who\nhates himself\num i guess i've been trying to tiptoe\naround it but i also sometimes feel like\num\num at least in that type of like\nintelligence um\nbecause i believe there's many types of\nit if it makes sense uh\ni think that i'm one of one of the best\nand the only people who managed to\nbecome like my very consistent and best\nfriends are also\nsimilar in that regard and\ni guess to if i wanted to describe it in\nlike a way that\nseems more logical maybe to people who\ncan't relate or\nit would be something like sometimes\nlife feels like um\nit's like watching a movie and everybody\nelse leaves before\nafter like the ads are over and when the\nmovie actually starts people are\nstarting to leave and talking about how\ngood the movie was and i'm the only one\nlike actually\nme and like some other people obviously\nbut very few people are actually like\nwatching the movie that we were\nthat we came here for if that makes\nsense okay so\nso i i'm gonna i'm gonna try to cap so\nyou use the word narcissist but\nwhat i'm sort of hearing is like a lot\nof people in life are plebs\n[Laughter]\nand and so is that is that what so\nhaving that\nidea is why you you recogni that's what\nyou describe\nwhen you call yourself a narcissist is\nit that attitude\nthat you're talking yeah sort of like\nyeah i know that's not like actual\non the paper narcissism but it's just\nlike i don't know how to describe it\nyeah i i get you okay so we can talk\nabout other people being plebs\noh okay but not in like a derogatory way\ni still i can still love a club if it\nmakes it\ni i i i get you you know you can you can\nbe\ncompassionate and respect the plebs but\nthere's still plebs\nright yeah pretty much yeah\ni mean you could be on the challenger\nleague and you can\nyou know pat those silver tear fighters\non the head\nthey're still silver right like it's\nthey're not less human than you are they\njust happen to be silver\nyeah and it's like i guess but that's a\nreally good example because like it\nfeels like i really am like\nthis challenger player who doesn't\nreally have anything to do with q times\nare long\ngames aren't fun it's always the same so\ni'm going down\nso i'm making a smurf account that\nhelping like a fixed amount of people\ntrying to go up\nyeah i mean no wonder it sounds like\nyou're living life in the third person\nit's like but it's also because it's\nlike it really does feel like it's the\nonly thing really\nthat's really fun for me anymore yeah i\nmean it\nkind of makes sense so like i know we're\nkind of going into the law analogies\nhere but if you really think about it\nlike\nif i'm a challenger lover player playing\nin like silver\nlet's say silver is a thing in law right\nbecause yeah there's yeah\nyeah so like and if you think about it\nlike how much fun could i have being an\nadc\nif i'm a challenger level player playing\nin silver it's like completely boring\nif you also kind of think about it what\nwould be more fun would be like a yumi\nsupport right where it's like\nlike there's just no point in playing\nthis game\nif i'm like trying to play but like at\nleast i can get some enjoyment like\nif you think about it i mean sometimes\ni'll i'll play with you know dota\nplayers who are like\nvery good and whenever they play\nyou know with me like they love playing\nsport\nlike because it's just it's a waste of\neveryone's time if they play\nmid or carry but like with support\nthey can run around and like cheer me on\nand they have a lot of fun when\ni do well exactly you know yeah\nmaybe everything in everything in life\ncan be learned from wall maybe that's\nthe takeaway\nyeah pretty much so but help me\nunderstand the hates himself part\ni i get the i get the arrogance\nall right that one's um it's a bit more\ncomplicated and i think it would make a\nlittle bit more sense once uh\ni've i've told a little bit about like\nmy past but in a way\nthis one's um like a mixed part it's\nmost but i think it's mostly this is\njust me guessing because\nhonestly this is something that i can't\nreally tell for sure why it is the way\nit is\num but i've had a major glow up in life\ni used to be very um unattractive inside\nand outside\nwas a very weird person to be honest\nit's hard to explain but\nfor a while it felt like um especially\nlike\nmiddle school and beginning of high\nschool like\nthere was nothing i could do to make\npeople like me if it makes sense\nand this is a this is something that i\nhad to combat by uh essentially copying\nnormies\nlet me like to put it like very uh\nsimple it's something that i i just kind\nof\nuh started to copy my best friend at the\ntime who\nwas only my friend because he lived in\nthe same house and like he felt like he\nhad to be my friend\nbut he was very popular and he was\nsomeone who\nreally helped me out just by telling him\njust by showing me like\nhow to how to not be the type of person\nwho for example can't understand that\neverything i like doesn't necessarily\nhave to be something that everyone likes\nand i think that's what it was because\nuh\nbecause of my like perception that\neverything that i like must be something\nthat's\nuh so high up in quality that everyone\nwould like it even if i\neven if i have no clue what it is um\nbut i grew to be a very annoying person\nwhich then was also paired with um\nwhat i at first actually thought was\nprobably racist because i lived in a\nvillage where\nlike i lived in a small town small\nvillage where\npeople were not actually like no one\nknew really like really knew people who\nhad my type of complexion i would say\num which later then turned out not to be\ntrue because it was actually just rumors\nabout my mom\nthat led to that kind of situation uh\nbecause people were telling their\nchildren not to play with me at first\nand it just\ndevolved into more and more not hate but\nlike dislike i was very cringe\nwait people were telling that\nlike people were their parents but their\nparents were telling their kids not to\ntalk to me\num just like when i was in like\nelementary school too\nand just these are the same people i was\nwith in elementary school were always in\nmy class up until like\nbeginning of high school and this type\nof like\nnot bullying but just excluding made me\nfeel like there's nothing about me\nthat's interesting enough to\never make like any meaningful\nconnections uh aside from my family\nwhich even there was it was really hard\num\ncan you tell me and it's just really oh\nyeah can you tell me a little bit about\nyour family\nsure that's like that's an entire thing\nto unpack\num so do you want me to just go in\nchronological order just tell me to tell\nyou about what my money's like right now\nokay so\ni can just talk about my family life i\nthink um\ni have i was brought up by my single\nmother at first\num because my biological father\nwho i hope isn't watching um\nhe he basically bailed the moment that\ni was born or ever yeah that's pretty\nmuch it i was an anchor baby\nwhy do you hope that he's not watching\nbecause i it's\nhard to explain at first i thought i\nhated him because that's just like\nbut that's like basically indoctrination\nfrom my mom because she didn't like him\nand she just kept telling me to\nbut i wasn't supposed to like him\nnowadays it's more like\ni actually really do dislike him just\nfor the fact that he\nbasically left me out and just left me\num but at the same time it's more like\nthe fact that\nthat i know what type of person he is\nhe's someone who\num which is this is not an ambition of\nguilt just in case uh he's someone who\ni've heard\nhe's uh deals drugs in a major city in\ngermany right now or\nmight be dead by by all but i know i\ndon't know\num and he was someone who's never\ncontacted me and contacted me ever in my\nlife other than when he actually needed\nsomething from me\nfor example he um just to put things in\nperspective my mother was german\nthis probably also answered a few\nquestions about my accent\nbut also my biological father he was uh\nmoroccan\nand he used me or my mom rather to make\nan anchor baby\nand just come to germany um using that\ni see and yeah trying to live the high\nlife right\nand um yeah he was uh\nthis is just the type of person he is he\ndid that he did\nsimilar things a lot like uh when i\nturned 18\num apparently he was like just about to\nbe thrown out of germany\ni don't know why he had he was about to\nhave his papers taken\nso suddenly he started texting me again\nand asking he was playing up a big game\nhe was telling me how\ni was his only son that mattered he has\na lot of sons by the way\nbut i'm the only one that matters and um\nhe really wanted to connect with me\nagain and he misses me and\nthat kept on for like weeks and how did\nyou honestly i didn't buy it\ni didn't buy it i was just annoyed to be\nhonest because at that point i was just\nlike i don't really\nwant to know him now because as much as\nblood can\ncan be thicker than water in that one\ninstance i just thought it's been 18\nyears\nthis dude's just a stranger to me now\nlike he can't be my father no matter\nwhat he does he's\nhe's always just going to be a stranger\nthe same way that any stepfather would\nbe\nthat makes sense because i don't know\nhim\nand um yeah so when when that all went\ndown i was just kind of annoyed that my\nmom was\nfor some reason also trying to enable it\neven though she\nherself was like the reason i disliked\nhim at first and didn't try to seek him\nout\nso she was trying to patch things up\nbetween y'all uh i think she was just\nreceiving money from him to be honest um\nas i said before he may or may not have\nbeen dealing in drugs and have\nmade has probably made a lot of money\nunder the table\nand he used that to like try to get to\nme um sent me a lot of gifts\nuh asked me what i wanted to have stuff\nlike that when we actually met up in\nreal life which\nhappened like a few weeks after albert\ntrying to get in contact\nhe gave me like a [ __ ] ton of money just\njust in my hand right just and you\nreally thought it was going to work\nand i guess it did for what he wanted to\nachieve because\nthe same day that i met him for the\nfirst time in 18 years\nso it's also the day that he dragged me\nto the town hall and\nmade me tell some people in the bureau\nthat uh he i\ninvented i'm his son and i actually need\nhim still and\nbecause i did that that's why he never\ngot like shoved off to another country\nso that's like the only reason you\nreally tried to like um engage with me\nagain\nright and after that yeah and after that\ni never really got to hear from him\nagain\nlike at first i think because he felt a\nlittle bit bad about it but\nit was noted noticeably less and after a\nwhile he stopped texting me all together\nagain\nand uh yeah that's the type of person he\nwas um and in the meantime\nsince he was not my only father figure\nthis is the wrong word to call it i\ndidn't really have father figures aside\nfrom like my grandpa who was very\nhe loved me very much but in a way that\nsomeone would love his dog if that makes\nsense like\nhe didn't love me for who i was but just\nthe fact that i was if that makes sense\nlike\nhe showered me in gifts and stuff but\nit's not really something that you could\ncall\nraising someone i love him very much\nlike it's not something that i would\nhold against him i don't i don't just\ndon't think that he knows any other way\nto like care for people\nyes so if i can just try to understand\nthat so it sounds like your grandfather\nloved you the way that a grandfather\nloves a grandson\nas opposed to loving you for being you\nexactly um but i do believe that like\ni have a very special player placed on\nhis heart and he doesn't have a special\nplace in my heart too like\nbut maybe he doesn't really know who you\nare exactly it's more yeah it's more\nlike he doesn't know how to find out who\ni am or who anyone\nis for that matter he's he's sort of\nhe's just\nthe type of person who's just really\nold-fashioned and superficial\num like he likes people who do what he\nsays basically that's a\nthat's a good way to call it yeah um\nso he's he um\nbut i'm basically um now talking back\nlike going going back to my mom\nshe was a single mom obviously and um\nshe however was someone who\num despite being over 40 like\nat the end of her lifespan she was very\ni would say energetic and she behaved\nlike someone who was still like in\nin puberty she was like always 16 at\nheight ever since i've known her\nseriously and um\nthat's something that can be charming\nbut can also be very exhausting\nespecially when you're a kid\nthat feels like you have to basically\neducate your own mom on stuff if that\nmakes sense i always felt like i was\nrepaired\num maybe some people can relate i i bet\nsome people can\num can you give me an example of of what\nthat looked like\num complete naivete and just\ncomplete naivete like she was someone\nwho\nhad lots of husbands in her in her\nlifetime\ni would say always the same type of\nperson\nand she just would never learn from her\nmistakes\nin that regard um\nsame type of person my father was\nsomeone who just used her for like\njust to like get to germany basically or\nfor any other man\nlike any other means to just get some\nsort of um\nbenefit out of you and also for a\nrelationship we would all marry her for\npaying for\na visa for money stuff like that\num weirdly enough always people from the\nsame family as my father\nalmost always that's very weird\nthank you son um\nit really was weird like uh you see even\nlike\ni'm my real name it's actually\nthe name of my biological father's\nbrother so that's like the type of\nperson\ni'm not the type of family but i'm that\ni used to live and it was really weird\nand basically\nthey were all in my opinion very bad\npeople which is also i don't want them\nto see this\nbut they probably won't they can't speak\nenglish um\nyeah but um this all kind of\nso can you tell us all kind of let you\nyeah oh sorry go ahead\ni was just led to like a childhood where\ni had like a very\na very inconsistent concept of what home\nis if that makes sense um\ni used to live with my mother for don't\nbe like eight years stuff like that um\nand at some point um\ni think at that point i had two\ndifferent stepfathers already\none of them was like neutral the other\none was really bad really\ni i like i get to see them fight every\nsingle day luckily not nothing physical\nbut it was just something that i've seen\nevery single day\nand at some point in life she also\nfigured that she\nwants to live like she wants to live her\nown life she doesn't really want to live\nfor her children\nthat makes sense so she shoved me off to\nmy grandparents which is also why i'm\nsaying that my grandpa\nreally um was like the only father\nfigure that i had\nfor a while because um\ni was raised there like with my\ngrandparents for like half my life at\nleast and now i'm here again\ngrandpa is still upstairs um\nyeah and at some point like after being\nwith my grandparents for a while but\nthat was something that i could call my\nlike my actual home\nbut one day um that's when i like around\nthe time that my little sister got\ngotten around to maybe six years old\nthat's when um the child protective\nservices are\nsome no actually no um just basically\njust uh\nthe town in general just came up to my\nmom and asked her\nwhether i'm still living with her or not\nand\nthey figured that i wasn't so we\nbasically threatened her that if\ni wasn't coming back to uh to her place\nthey would cut the um picture what's it\ncalled like just we\nin germany we get money for having\nchildren basically sure yeah\num i don't know what it's called sorry\nbut um\nyeah but since you didn't want to miss\nout on that money which she didn't give\nto my grandparents either\nlike she was just kind of living off of\nthat\num she figured that i'd have to come\nback and after that things were really\nawkward to be honest because like\ni've been i've been living somewhere\nelse for six years i didn't really\ntrust in my mom uh i was\n12 13 something when you came back\nyeah okay so you spent like 6 to 12 with\nyour grandparents\nexactly um\nand when i came back it was just\nextremely awkward because i\ni didn't i didn't really connect well\nwith my sister yet and like\nshe was just a stranger to me to be\nhonest at that point\nbut your sister was staying with your\nmom yeah exactly because my mom always\nwished for\nlike my mom always wished for a daughter\nso that was like\nthat's like the main reason she stayed\nwith her because like my big brother was\nalso chef to my grandparents at some\npoint\nand um yeah um when i was there\nthings just immediately went kind of\nhayward\nhaywire again because uh as i said\nbefore she had a lot of like\ni had a lot of stepfathers and none of\nthem\nwere good except for the last one to\nsome degree\nbut i'm gonna get to that um\nit's always been like i was always\nafraid that they\nlike they were bad people to such an\nextent that i was scared that they would\ntouch my little sister when i'm not\naround sort of\nlike that's how bad they were sometimes\num\nyou talk it says not many people wanted\nyou\nyeah they didn't and i can't even fault\nthem\nwhich is also like this plays also into\nlike\nmy um self-hatred two way because i feel\nlike\nin a way i've just messed that up and\ni'm still that person i'm still someone\nwho people don't want\nand now i'm playing this character or\nit's not even a character because like i\ndon't think i'm\nacting like in a way that's like fixed\nbut rather\nuh depending on who i'm in front of it's\njust like a matter of role taking if\nthat makes sense like\ni i'll be the mirror that reflects\nsomeone the best way\npossible or i try to be at least like i\nwant people to just be comfortable\naround me\nand so i'll act accordingly sounds like\nyou're a chameleon\nyeah pretty much um but i\ni think i have like a few car like a few\ncar\num things about my personality that\ndon't change um\nbut mostly yeah that's what i am a\ncrypto savant\nexactly um\nno but uh yeah people really didn't want\nme back then\num especially like any like anything\noutside of a realm of like my\ngrandfather\na grand grandparent's house that's\neverything that's everything that didn't\nwant me\nuh school teachers my my own mother uh\nmy\nmy real my real father stuff like that\nthey all didn't really want me around\num not necessarily oh sure um\nthis is actually like a mixed product i\nsaid background because like i had\nmany teachers who were very nice to me\nbut the thing is i think it's\nprobably a natural thing in people to\nalways like\nhave the worst stuff that happened to\nyou more in mind than the rest um\nand for every uh i don't know if every\nfive teachers were very good to me there\nwas one teacher who would bully me in\nfront of a tire in front of a class\nat some point that was even um the\nschool rector that was like the worst\ntime of my life in a way because\nthat person made me um fail fail class\nlike\ni actually had to repeat one class even\nthough i had a really good like\ni had a really i had really good results\nat the end of at the end of the semester\nthing was that she just gave me an f and\none course in the germany it's like this\nif you have an f\nand you're like final results when you\njust don't get to um\nprogress to the next class why didn't\nyou\nget failed do you know um\nand ironically because she didn't like\nme and uh\nstuff like that happened with her all\nthe time to the point where she actually\ngot like demoted like she's not in that\nschool anymore\nit's like she's been in the papers for\nher and that was really just me being\nunlucky like she\ndidn't really have a reason to dislike\nme she was just the type of person who\nwould like single someone\njust be so that sounds like it was just\nbad luck\nyeah pretty much because like it's\nreally weird because like\nthree years after that i got into the\nsame class again and she had it and she\nended up having a headphone on someone\ncompletely different and\nthat time i i got i got off from\nscottsdale nothing\nhappened interesting okay\nyeah but um so i had a few teachers\noh go ahead sorry please i had a few\nteachers who would\nvery deliberately um make me do things\nthat they knew\nthe entire class would make fun of me\nfor um\nespecially like uh just i don't know\nlike\nit goes from like simple stuff like\nasking me stuff that they knew\ni wouldn't i wasn't gonna know to\nliterally bringing up like my\nentire like family relations uh in front\nof a whole class just to\nmake fun of it sort of like it was\nreally weird\nwhat would they say it was um for\nexample i had like a really bad fight\nwith my mom at the time and he'd just\nbring it up and\nasked me how i couldn't have how i could\nbe disappointing to someone who and then\nhe mentioned something that my mom was\nvery famous for\num in relation to like me having a lot\nof stepfathers that brings like\na lot of infamy with it right okay so\nyeah\nnot like he was not a very nice person\nand that guy's like\ni don't know that guy is like still in\nmy brain i don't think that's\never gonna leave for some reason it's\njust like\nit felt really unfair at the time\nbecause i felt like i really i had no\nchance to even if i was a normal person\nif that makes sense i don't think i\nwould have made friends\nat the time um\nbut yeah when that when you say that\nperson is still in your brain\nthat sounds awful and also what what\nspace do they occupy in their mind in\nyour mind in what way are they still in\nyour brain\ni think there's like an entire half of\nmy psyche that's like dedicated to like\nin\nweirdly enough uh it's like the most\ndramatic thing for me even though\non paper there's much worse stuff that's\ni'm still going to tell you\nbut the bullying uh it just made me feel\nlike there really was\nnothing and no one who would ever really\ngonna who's\never really gonna love me for who i am\ninstead of just what i am which is for\nexample a grandson if that makes\nbut um it's like till this day now i'm\nvery popular where i live\num and still when i walk around\nsomewhere i feel like when people are\nlaughing i\ni always feel like it's probably\nsomething about me because people used\nto make fun of like the most mundane\nthings about me\nthe way i drink water the way i walk\nlike stuff like that\nand that just makes you feel like\nthere's really nothing that\nyou can do that feels normal all right\nand now it's like this half of my brain\nthat i know isn't real anymore\nlike it's i often call i like to call it\num\nlogic against behind like my heart's\ntelling me this\nlike people are still um people still\nfeel this way about me but my brain\nknows it's not that way\nsure sure i'm noticing you\nyou laugh a lot yeah it's because uh\ni am like i'm starting to realize now\nthat i'm probably at the point where\ni've been telling like a lot of stuff\nthat's\nreally bad and i'm not showing the\nemotional\num i don't know like i don't i feel like\ni'm not showing like an\nemotional response that's fitting if\nthat makes sense\nand also it's something that i just\nsomeone just said coping humor\nin uh in the chat which is no reading\ntwitch\nsorry i'm really sorry no reading\nchat quiet okay\ni once just asked\nyeah i got it forward now but um\nbasically uh for me it's something that\nthis is going to sound weird i have an\nuncle who's very very very like\nhe's suffering a lot from bpd\nand he's one of her only like\npeople i know who are like very\ngenuinely kind and nice but he's\ngot a really bad problem which is he\nalien alienates people all the time\nby basically talking about his tragedies\nin a way that\nmakes people feel like they have to say\nsomething to it like they have to\nconsole him\nand i think in my opinion um people who\nhave that sort of negative\nenergy around them like all the time\nlike if it's really very\nconsistent um people have a problem with\nactually\nconnecting to that person anymore like\nthey don't really want to be around that\nperson anymore and i like to be\nrecycled type of person who's\ncomfortable to be around\nand so i don't like to have and so i\ndon't even if i were to\nstill feel like overly emotional i feel\nlike i would still try to mask that\nbecause i want people to feel like i'm\njust telling them a story and they don't\nreally have to\nlike pat my back and be like oh i'm so\nsorry for you\nbecause i know it's gonna make them feel\nbad too like it's because especially\nbecause of the things that i do tell\npeople i think it's something that most\npeople just don't know how to respond to\nyeah at all so what i'm hearing is that\nso i'm hearing that you have an uncle\nwho manipulates people into being\ncompassionate and caring\nvery true yes and you will be damned\nif you manipulate people into doing the\nsame thing\nexactly it's just uh for him it's like\nhis saving grace is that he\nhimself is as caring and as\ncompassionate as he wants everest to be\nlike\nhe's he's at least doing that like\nback to people and he's very much like\nif he loves someone he would do anything\nfor them sure\nbut he's very egocentric i would say in\nthe way that uh\num i'm probably front running like what\ni'm about to tell but\ni was gonna eventually tell you about\nhow my mom was murdered\nand uh i had to like i watched it\ni was there for it and my\nuncle uh somehow had this idea in mind\nthat he had it worse than\nme for example which i feel like if he\nhad told that to anyone else they would\nhave probably snapped at him\ni wasn't really angry because i know\nwhat's going on in his mind but like\ni can i can see how this sort of\nbehavior can\nprobably piss off a lot of people if\nthat makes sense and he's\nalienated like all of his real life\nfriends just from doing that\nbut yeah it's like\ni try to be the type of person who\nif i do decide to tell someone stuff i\ndon't want them to feel like\nthey have to react in a certain\nin some specific way they don't have to\ntell me anything if i'm telling it i\nwant it to be like i'm just\ntelling an interesting story okay sad\nbut interesting\ni'm confused about how to react to you\nsharing that your mother was murdered\num yeah it's uh it's i think that's\neveryone that's part of it\num it for me it's very like a\nconflicting thing because\nas you can probably as you've probably\npicked up my especially like my early\nlifetime with her\nnot a very good experience um not\nnecessarily horrible but also not\nvery good and i always felt like i\nwasn't really like\nan important part of her life especially\nduring that time\num but as i said before she had a lot of\nlike she\nshe married a lot um and people really\ndid think that she was just someone\nwho's very\neasy to have um to say very\nand then to put it in like the most\npositive life but i can\nhowever um she really was in love with\nher people that she\nmarried she was just really um she was\njust really\nunfortunate in the way she picked people\nand um so they would always like end up\nbreaking up with her\nbefore she even like was ready for it\nherself and it gave her something that\ni don't know it changed her in the to a\ndegree where she was\nextremely jealous um in the most unlike\ni don't know it was really unhealthy to\nsee even to see and to witness but\ni wouldn't want to i wouldn't want to\nhave been like her married partner even\nif\neven if she i was someone who wasn't her\nbecause she was like very\ni don't know she was so jealous but it\nreally felt like there was nothing you\ncould do to please her\nand when my last stepfather came around\nthat person was a very nice man\nin my opinion he was a very nice man at\nfirst for example\nshe he was someone that actually was\ncompletely outside of the\num how do you say that completely like\noutside of what she usually looked for\nin men\nvery complete like a very different man\nactually like someone who's integrated\ninto society\nsomeone who works alone like someone who\nwanted to work instead of just sitting\nand sit and sit at home and drink and\ntalk to underage people on chatterbait\nor whatever whatever\nchad roulette i think and\njust someone who felt like he was a\nnormal person like someone that\nas weird as business to say um\nthat was like around the time where i\nactually had friends\nand meeting other families was like\ncomplete whiplash for me\nseeing how other families uh like even\neven by while having in mind that these\npeople are probably trying to like\nplay it up and be nicer now that i'm\naround now that i'm busy and visiting\nthese people were nice to a degree but\ni've never known\num it was such a weird experience to see\nlike a normal functioning family\nand it was so distant from what my\nfamily wasn't\nin my opinion aside from like maybe what\nmy grandparents were\nbut when that person came around it felt\nlike\nthis guy was gonna um bring that sort of\nfeeling that i had when i was at my\nfriend's\nlike in my at my friend's house right to\nvisit it felt like he was going to bring\nthat to us\nbut she did actually like he actually\ndid that um he\nhad something about him but\ni'm i'm listening uh what did he bring i\nthink you're about to say it\nokay yeah um he he just brought\nsomething that\ni would call common sense um he was\nsomeone who actually wanted to\nbe like a presence in my life in my\nsister's life he wanted to be someone\nlike he was\nsomeone who actually loved my mother\ninstead of just trying to abuse her for\nsomething\num and i think that\nand i think that confused my mom because\nshe was so\nlike adjusted to people being the worst\nto her\nright and so because this person was so\ndifferent\nshe started being voiced to him um\nnot at first but like at some point it\nwent to a\ndegree where for example she um\nshe would go to work and he usually came\nhome\nbefore she did because he went out\nearlier too\nand he had put on some weight he wanted\nto lose weight so he just went out\nand drove his butt like rode his bike\nso he came home later than she did and\nher immediate reaction to that when he\ncame home was\nwho were you with who did you cheat on\nme with right\nvery extreme reaction she would take his\nphone and uh\ndemand that she knows that she gets to\nknow all his passwords\nhe gets to read all of his facebook\nmessages and stuff and then she told her\nat some point even\nstarted like throwing his phone around\nand having like extreme temper tantrums\nwhere he wouldn't even understand what\nshe's saying anymore\nwhich was very sad because she had like\nmade so much progress at that point\nin to like in a direction where i would\ncall her like an actual mom\ninstead of just the person i call mom if\nthat makes sense\num she was still someone who i felt i\nhad to\neducate and care for in a way but\nit at least felt like she loved me and\nvery like she actually like now\nlike loved and um appreciated me in a\nway a mother would have some\ninstead of just someone who's like\nliving with me and this was around the\ntime that she was dating the\nthe good stepfather or married to okay\nyeah this is\ngood so even though she was kind of\nsorry just to clarify even though she\nwas kind of um\nmaybe being not so nice to him it\nsounded like she was more\ngenuinely caring for you\nand not for her too like she was she was\nvery much in love with her like to a\npoint with\ni would say this is his love for her was\nprobably\num the thing that seared like my\nfamily's uh\nentire fate in a way because\nthe thing is if you treat someone who\nhates you badly\nhe's just gonna want to distance himself\nfrom you right but if you treat someone\nbadly who loves you a person's just\ngonna be confused and not know what to\ndo\nand some people can deal with that sort\nof pressure in a way that doesn't end in\nhomicide and some people can't i would\nsay\nand this person after\ntwo years of having been the best father\nfigure that i\nhave had up until that point\napparently i don't know really what\nhappened i don't even know if it really\nhappened but my mom claimed that he\num like punched her and punched the\nlights out almost\nlike um i heard him screaming i went i\nimmediately came running and what i saw\nwas\nher on the ground crying she was mad in\nthe floor uh\njust looking at me like just like no\nwhat did i do right\ni talked to her and she said but yeah\nand he had punched him a few times but\nto be honest her story didn't completely\ncheck out\ni feel like she actually lied about it\nin a way because like his story which\nwas that he shoved her aside and\num everybody shoved her side very hard\nand that she\nand that he accidentally like pushed her\nagainst the um door frame\nuh like seeing the wounds that she had\nthat was much more likely than\nhim actually punching her full password\nthree times in the face like that didn't\nreally check out\nbut nevertheless i was mad um my big\nbrother was really mad\nand we threw him out not in the nicest\nway possible either\nbut i eventually started feeling bad for\nmy king and i came after him and i\nhelped him at least find a hotel to stay\nin\nand at the time i was working at the\nsame place as my mom\nwe had a small casino just eight slot\nmachines now it's nothing big but\nit was ours we were um we were working\nin it\nup until like eight and one am every day\nand one time like like a week after that\nhappened\num i would occasionally bring him food\nstuff like that so he would like\neven then live comfortably because for\nsome reason i just knew they were going\nto get back together\num and he ended up visiting me in\nin that casino while i was working and\njust\nsmelled like a smell of alcohol smelled\nof puke\nreally puffy uh eyes and he was talking\nto me about how\nhorrible he felt how this is like the\nworst time of his life\nbecause he's separated from her because\nhe doesn't know what to do he feels like\nand he even told me at that point that\nsometimes she can be like the nicest and\nsweetest woman to him and sometimes\nshe's just\nso insane to her and to him that he\ndoesn't know what to do\nand he asked me for a hug i gave it to\nhim he connected and\ni figured i would i was going to help\nhim to get back with my\nget back with my mom again which i did\ni believe myself to be someone who's\nvery good at\nreaching like any sort of goal as long\nas it\num as long as it contains making someone\ndo something\neven if it's at least something that\nthey have at least somewhat in mind like\ni think\nit's not really i don't know if it's\nsomething that i couldn't call\nmanipulative but\nsomething along those lines they have to\ngive you a side quest and you can make\nsure it gets done\nexactly exactly if i know if i can feel\nthat there's like even if it's a secret\nquest if i can feel it i can do it sort\nof\nbut it's that's what it feels like but\nyeah i did that\nand from four months it went\nreally well again and then\nbasically like a complete repeat of\neverything but i said before happened\nagain\nand um yeah so we threw him out again\nand this time and this is something that\ni missed to tell you um before that he\nactually told us that\nnext time he was gonna get thrown out\nlike once he came back in he said that\nin a very\nnot in a cryptic or mad way he said that\nvery matter-of-factly like\nwe didn't even think anything about it\nhe said that um we were going to regret\nit\nand my mom immediately asked him what\nare you going to go back to portugal\nbecause that's where he was from\num and he was like yeah you'll see\nand that felt like that's what he meant\nright and\nso this time we threw him out again\nbecause it happened basically the exact\nsame thing happened again\num except this time he also like tried\nto push my sister or something i wasn't\nthere for it\nand because of that like\nwe eventually checked out like on her\nmom's bank account like her shared bank\naccount with bad guy\nand we really realized i can't talk\nsorry\nwe realized that um 500 euros we're\nmissing\nit's like i think about 600 something\nlike that\num and we figured he really did just get\na\nticket back to portugal or something\nlike that\nwell he visited me again at work\nthis time at like night time much more\n[ __ ] up than the last time very puffy\neyes again\nsmall smooth smoke like [ __ ] to be\nhonest and\none time he and like he we were just\ntalking about [ __ ] and not even about my\nmom just talking about stuff because i\nfelt like this was the last time we were\ngonna talk\nwhich was right um\nand he again asked me to hug him and he\nwas talking about how he feels like\nthis is again the worst time of his life\nbut also\nthere's nothing he can do about it right\nlike he felt like there was nothing to\ndo and i told him yeah i don't think you\nand mom are\never going to work out it was like yeah\nbut things are going to be better soon\nand the next day i was in bed my mom was\nlate\nit was late at work she just came home i\nheard her garage going um\njust closed down so i figured she was\ngonna come in soon\nand suddenly i heard basically the\nloudest\nsound of my that i've ever heard in my\nlife it's felt like an explosion right\nnext to me\nand it happened again and again so like\nthree times and i\nthen looked outside of a window and i\nsaw my mom laying on the ground\nand my stepfather or at least a\nsilhouette\nwith a gun in hand and\nyeah i panicked called the police the\nfather and at that point i actually\nfought or even knew\nlike in my mind i knew i was gonna die\nnext i felt like this is\nthis person that's gonna come up here\nand he's gonna kill me and he's gonna\nkill my sister and this is like my last\nmoment in life\nthat sort of feeling is something that i\nprobably will never shake\ni it's hard to explain it's something it\nfeels like\nthat sort of adrenaline makes you feel\nlike someone else is controlling your\nbody and you're only\nwatching and it's like\ni don't know it's like automotive but\nyeah um and i thought was\neven more like that's part sounded even\nmore convincing to me the moment i heard\nanother shot\nand i didn't even bother to try to look\noutside of the window this time\nbecause i was scared to see and to see\nwhat it was or to see\nsomeone actually come in so out of panic\ni just called the police and i took a\nwine bottle\nstill stood next to the door and thought\nthat if someone's going to come in maybe\ni can try to overwhelm them if not i'll\ndie\ni die anyways maybe i can save my sister\nwho knows\nbut no one ever came no police and that\nguy didn't either\nso at some point after like probably 15\nminutes of waiting or maybe free who\nknows\ni was very i was in a very very weird\nmindset\ni actually looked outside of the window\nand i saw another person laying down on\nthe ground\nsame person with a gun yeah and\nlike an hour later police came and\nthat's where how my family got torn\napart to a point where\nnothing feels but now it does again that\nit felt like\nlife was never going to be normal again\nand it\ni think it's just something to before i\nfinish this story sort of\nit just felt almost ironic that\nthe moment that life feels it feels like\nit's starting to get\nbetter in regards to like my family life\nthe moment that\nmy um me and my mom get back together in\na way where it's\nwhere it actually feels like family\nthat's when life also takes her from me\nwas kind of ironic i guess\nthat's quite the story doc yeah\nit's hard to tell people sometimes\nbecause it feels like i don't know i\nfeel like it's\nactually so much that people often\noftentimes don't believe me\nunless they actually live around me and\nknow it happened\nit does sound unbelievable in a lot of\nways\nyeah i know and to those who doesn't\nsound unbelievable too it sounds like\nsomething they can't really respond to\nusually when i'm at a loss for words\nit's because there are too many\nthings to say i'm sorry\nno it's okay how does it feel to share\nthat\num it's something that i can't really\nexplain to be honest\nbecause um i'm as i said before i'm very\nopen about like\ni don't know it's hard to say it's i've\ni'm very open about stuff that happens\nto me i\ntell people all the time and\nit feels like i'm making it real again\nin a way because like sometimes i feel\nlike my brain is trying to\nnot forget it but make it seem like it\nhappened 20 years ago when it was only\nthree years ago\nand when i tell it i feel like\nit's it's still real it's something that\nreally didn't even\num i don't know it's something that\nhappened not too long ago but i overcame\nit if that makes sense like i think\ni think but in a way at least\ni probably overcame it as well as i\npossibly could without any help\nthat makes sense because there were\ntimes where i\ndidn't want to live anymore that's\nespecially like the first\num first week after it happened second\nweek\nironically i was already working again\nbecause like\ni felt like if i were to go back into\nlike a normal everyday life\num i wasn't gonna forget it but i was at\nleast gonna get used to the change if\nthat makes sense\nbecause like that basically uploaded\nlike my entire life like\nnothing's the same\num yeah you have more to say\nno no it's fine can i think for a second\nyou may i love it thank you\nhmm\ni feel like this conversation has ten\nmain quests\nin it\nthey all feel really important to me\nokay i'm gonna start listing them out\nall right actually let's start with this\nwhat\nhow how are you feeling right now doc\nstill nervous um a little bit more\ncomfortable than before\nbut other than that i don't really\nfeel much to be honest is your is your\nmind\ntelling you that we think\nsomething about you now\num i can't imagine that there's people\nespecially like in\ni don't know i can imagine that there's\npeople who now have listened to that who\nbelieve this is not true\num because that's like a that's\nthat's a reaction i get a lot um\nthere's probably a lot of people who\nthink i'm weird for\nreacting to it the way i do and maybe a\nlot of people are also\nrelating to at least part of what i just\nsaid because i think uh\ni don't know i think that for a lot of\npeople especially like people who\nmaybe were outcasts or even outcasts\nlike in\nmiddle and high school or even just\npeople who are gamers\num i think there's at least something\nthat\nthey will probably relate to in that\nwhat do you think i think\nno clue okay good i'm happy to hear that\num because that means i don't have to\ndispel anything and we can just get into\nit\nso i have a very good opinion about you\nwell let's it sounds like disappointing\nyou will be easy then\num so\nyeah i it's yeah anyway you don't have\nto\nwe can i'm sure we can hit that tennis\nball across the court several times\nback and forth yeah um so\nuh let me just let me just kind of toss\nout i'm gonna just think out loud okay\nokay so we started off the conversation\nand you kind of mentioned that you had\nhad traumatic experiences but that you\nbasically like the main thing that\nthat i heard originally was that you're\nkind of living life in the third person\nand that the only time that you kind of\nget excited is\nthe only time that you can really feel\nhappiness or joy\nis like when you're helping someone else\nout\num and and you know also like so we sort\nof\nkind of notice that you sort of feel\nlike\nseparated from your life you're not\ninvested in your own life\num but you can be invested in others and\nthen you sort of mention this thing\nabout\num you know like you're a narcissist who\nhates himself and\nwhat as we kind of dug into that we sort\nof recognize that\nyou know you do actually think about\nother people as plebs and as weird as\nthat sounds i don't think that that's\nactually arrogant i\ni i think that\ni think you can accurately assess that\nyou've sort of developed like a high\nlevel of social intelligence and you\nkind of know how to interact with people\nyou know how to make yourself likeable\nand that sometimes people\nare not like aware of those levels of\ninteraction\nright which sort of makes sense it's\nkind of like you know you can be a\nmaster chef\nand taste lots of things whereas like\nyou know the majority of people may just\nwant their attendees and like they don't\nreally care about\nyou know like which is which is fine\nlike it's like that's how humans are\nlike some of us\nare master chefs and some of us are fine\nwith attendees\nyou know some of us are like socially\nlike very aware of nuance and such\nand and other people are just sort of\nlike i'm gonna be a pleb and\noh my god did you see this pair of shoes\non instagram i want it\nand and you know like yeah and that's\nfine right\nlike yeah i wish i was like that that's\nthat's the thing like\ni don't think i i don't think lesser of\nhim i just feel like yeah i wish i would\nstill like that if that makes sense\nand and some people are challenger level\nat league and some people are silver\nright like that's\nit's okay for people to be good at\nthings and other people to not be good\nat things\num and you know you mentioned\nhate yourself um and this is where i\nthink we can really start to see a\ncouple of themes which\nyou know if you've been watching the\nstream for a while i'm sure people can\npiece this together\nyou reading twitch chat by the way no\nokay good actually not so\nso i i you know you you said one thing\nthat struck me as odd is that there was\na friend of yours who was living with\nyou\nand he felt like he had to be your\nfriend because he was living with you\ncan you help me understand that\nstatement oh it's just the\napartment complex he was living\nunderneath like in the apartment\nunderneath me\nwhy does why does he have to be with why\ndoes he\nhave to because he he just was that type\nof person he wasn't\nhe's extremely extroverted um\nthat person is like an entire thing to\nunpack too because he was uh that\nhe was my latest in my late step\nproblems like the guy who did that\nhe was when he was his um\nnephew so it's a yeah that's like a\ntangled tangled story but but what i'm\ncurious about is\nis why couldn't he like you for being\nyou\nuh because he told me he wouldn't have\nliked me if i hadn't lived in the same\ndepartment in the same apartment complex\nhe was very uh he was just someone who\nwas very extroverted and he\njust knowing that someone just someone\nhis age\nis in the same like house as he is\nhe just he just felt like he was he had\nto do\ndo stuff with me because he just always\nneeds someone around and that was like\nthe perfect\nscenario for him so he in a way shaped\nme into someone he would like if that\nmakes sense because\ni was a very i was a very nerdy person\num because as one might as one might\ntell since i didn't have any friends\ninternet was my friend and it still is\nto his day\nto a degree because that's why i feel\nmost comfortable even\nlike i'm not shy i have a lot of friends\nnowadays i have a lot of people to hang\nout with i just\noftentimes feel like i do want to stay\nalone either way\nyeah so doc i may start\ninterrupting you a little bit okay\nthat's fine completely fine\num so so and so this is i think like a\nwas not the answer i was expecting um in\nterms of\nyou know why you felt that way but but i\ni'm really seeing a big theme here which\nis that you know you're not\nworth liking right so yeah\nso so and we'll and i can see you\nswallowed there so that's good so\nthere's probably some kind of emotion\nso right then it can hurt to hear it but\nlike let's just kind of like run through\nthe\nthe evidence of that right so i and i\nthink that\nand this is where we have to get really\ntricky because i think you are worth\nliking but i think that it's very\nreasonable\nfor you to believe that you are not\nworth liking because like honestly the\nevidence kind of points in that\ndirection right\nand i think it just happens to be bad\nkarma for lack of a better term but to\nstart off with you were an anchor child\nright your dad like\nbasically the reason that you were\nconceived was out of a uh\na sociopathic desire to stay in a\ncountry and for material gain\nyeah and to have an absent father who\ntells you that he likes you i mean\nyou're not really buying it but then you\nalso get like very clear evidence right\nand this is not one of those things\nwhere i mean sometimes we we deal with\nsituations of cognitive bias or\ndistortion\nwhere that's what i thought we would see\nwith your friend which was like\noh you know maybe you just didn't\nrealize because you felt unlovable but\nhe actually was your friend because\nhe liked you but it turns out maybe\nthat's not the case\nand that if anything what he taught you\nis that you're not\nworth liking but if we can doll you up\nand make you pretty and make you\nlikeable if i can turn you into\nsomething that you're not\nthen i can like you yeah pretty much\nand and so yeah go ahead\ni was just gonna say that um uh in like\nregards to the uh\ncognitive dissonance that you've\nmentioned before i get that and i still\nfor me it's i think it's a little bit\ndifferent than for most people\num because i have this sort of thing\nwhere it feels like i got two\nthought processes at the same time when\ntalking to people where it's like the\nlogic\nthat's like the logical part of my brain\nthat knows no this person probably\nreally does like me and i'm very\nconfident in that assessment then\nthere's also the other part of my brain\nthat's like\nyeah but do you remember back then you\ndid you never really know if people\nactually like you or is it this is just\na facade because we either don't want to\nbe mean\nor because we're trying to like bait you\ninto being like\nuh funnily stupid again sort of yeah\ngood so i'm glad that you recognize that\nbecause i do think it's different from\nthe cog\ni think it's quite different so for some\npeople what happened so let's just\nillustrate this for a second\nfor some people what happens is that\ntheir\nheart ends up controlling their mind\nand so even though the mind should\nlogically see that this person likes you\nthe heart convinces them otherwise and\nthey take someone who actually likes you\nand distort it\ninto what the heart actually believes in\nyour sense i don't think that you have\nthat cognitive distortion or cognitive\nbias\nyeah it's more like my heart is trying\nto give me that but it's not working\nthat much yeah\nyeah yeah i just feel a general form of\nlike discomfort\nyeah that's like at most that's it\nabsolutely and i think if\nwe want to be really honest about it\nlike i think that there's a good reason\nit's not that your heart is actually\nillogical i think it's actually quite\nlogical right because\nif we really look at your life what we\nsee is you know dad\nyou know like abandonment and all that\ngood stuff and then also like\noh son you're the only son that matters\nto me\npro tip if you have a parent who has\nlots of children\nand tells you that you're the only one\nthat dot dot dot or just in general\nmakes me hate it more just in general\nlike like i see this a lot with like\nnarcissistic\nkind of i mean we i think the word gets\ntossed around a lot so\nthere's just a particular kind of person\nwho will say you're the only one\nyeah right so that kind of idealization\nthat's something you should be careful\nlike even when it comes to dr k they're\nlike dr k is the only one no i'm i'm\nreally not\nyou know no it's like um that's i\ni wouldn't say that either like i just\num\nuh this is gonna probably this is\nprobably something you've heard a lot\nbefore\num i came to know you because of your\nfirst interview with\nreckful and reckful was someone that i\nat that point in time\num related to a lot um weirdly enough\nbecause i feel like he has very he had\nvery different problems\nto me and still i felt like he was\nsomeone that i could relate to very well\nand when i found out that he was like\ntalking to a therapist on online\nand i checked it out and i felt like\nthis is someone who actually\nsort of um can like look behind that\ncurtain that people\nhave put up and and at least in my like\nthis is gonna sound weird to say but i\nfeel like people who are primarily on\nthe internet\naren't easily understood by most\ntherapists in\nthe same way that they are by you and by\nyou for some reason\nyeah so there's a simple reason for that\nand it's that therapists look at\npatients\nand what therapists should do is look at\npeople\nyeah right and and\ni mean that you know i think the more\nperson\nthat you see the easier it's going to be\nto relate and if we really look at\nyou know byron i think one of the things\nthat made him special was that\nhe was really good at like being himself\nand being very authentic which is why\nit's interesting because we do hear that\na lot of people like really connected\nwith byron and i think that's because\nlike\nhe showed off all the facets of his\nbeing so you didn't get\na curtain you got a person like yeah it\nfelt like\num in a way it felt like just hanging\nout with a friend when you watched him\nyeah that's probably what most people\nfelt like\nand so just kind of going back to kind\nof themes of of you know being unlovable\nwhich is just what i'm going to call it\nright so there's your dad\nthere's this friend who sort of shaped\nyou into a person who's worthy of being\nfriends with\num and then also like people like kids\nin your neighborhood\nexplicitly being told to not hang out\nwith you\nyeah um because of just rumors about my\nmom going around\nyeah also just me being like the only\ncolored person in the village that's\nwhat i thought was the case\num the way i was trying to make it easy\nfor myself i think yeah\njust a standard case of racism yeah but\ni i tried to make it about that because\ni feel like if it's not then i can't do\nanything about it it's not my fault and\nit's fine\nexactly but it turned out to not be that\nwhich means what\num first of all i needed to change and\nsecond of all\npeople knew about my mom too much yeah\nso it's kind of interesting right\nbecause when you say you need to change\nlike if you attribute\ntheir dislike of you to racism like\nthat's not your fault\nyeah but if it's not racism then it's\nsort of like\nkind of your not necessarily it's that\nit's your fault because\ni still get the sense that you're pretty\nlevel-headed about that but that it\nlike you really are there's something\nwrong with you let's put it that way\nyeah um i was just very\ni was just the annoying kid at school\nbasically like uh\nbut it's also i think it was kind of a\nresult of just not having any friends in\nmy age range ever\nup until like up until i like turned\n[Music]\n14 with my friend that lived in the same\napartment complex and then 16 when i\nbasically started with a new slate in a\nnew class that was really welcoming and\nnice\nyeah so i'm just going to kind of go\nback to unlovable okay\ni'm just going to lay out a couple other\nthings so one is like\nyou know being told that you know being\nsent off to your grandparents place and\nthen your mom telling you that they\nalways wanted a daughter i'm gonna keep\nthis kid\nbut this kid i'm gonna send off\nlike that's gotta hurt\nit did to a degree but i was\nluckily young enough to not really like\nthink about it too much my grandpa did a\nreally good job of like\nmaking me feel like i was at home\nbut it was still it was still on my mind\nyeah\nyeah yeah so so and this is where i kind\nof get\nyou know back to this idea of like you\nknow what's it like to never be wanted\nit it i think it's something that\ni say that at some point it just makes\nyou feel like\ni don't know you just ask yourself all\nthe time what's wrong with me um\nwhat did i do wrong why are people like\nalways snapping at me why\nno i can't uh it just felt like why\ncan't i have\nwhy can't i have anything nice unless\nit's literally just a i don't know a ps2\ngame\nor something that i got on christmas\nright\num yeah just it felt like uh\ni must have messed up somewhere and\nthere's no way for me to\nget out of it on my own because i just\ndon't know what to change\nor i didn't know um\nat some point i just figured i would uh\nsee like\ni had like a few people who were at\nleast neutral towards me and i just\ntried to like\nhang on to those people and be as um\ni don't know i tried to be uh almost\nlike them\nand it just weirdly worked out\ndoc i mean this may sound kind of weird\nlike i don't know how to find the words\nbut like\ni can imagine that the person that on\nsome level you feel you\nare has a main quest that isn't even\nworth pursuing\nyeah pretty much\nright like why would we want to bother\nwith this guy's main quest\nlike this guy's main quest isn't even\nworth it\nlike there are like other people who are\nlike normal\nand like them doing their side quests is\nlike more\nimportant than our main quest\nyou know i'm kind of i'm kind of almost\nimagining these rpgs where you know\nsometimes like in rpgs you've got good\ncharacters and bad characters\nand there's the side content that you\ncan do to develop a character and some\ncharacters just aren't worth developing\nyeah so you just leave the side quest is\njust sitting in the quest log but\nthey're not really worth using like\ntheir stats are low so like why bother\nyeah pretty much um so i just went back\nto character creation basically\nyeah well said right and you reinvented\nyourself\nyeah and i don't know is this gonna\nsound weird but i feel like\nin a way everything that happened in my\nlife at least to some degree\nmade me who i am because uh i don't know\nhow\nelse to say it but i feel like i've been\nin\nalmost like every single position that\nsomeone of my age could be in\num in the way that i've been someone who\nwas extremely unpopular\nbullied um i know what it's like to\nto have parents i don't i don't i know\nwhat it's like to be an orphan now um i\ni know what it's like not to be loved by\nyour parents but i also know what it's\nlike\nto get pay attention uh mostly because\nmy grandparents but also just with last\ntwo years of my mom\nstill uh i don't know it's just like the\nlast three years of\nliving with my mom we're actually pretty\nnice which is why it's so\nwhich is why it still hurt to lose her\nso much like\nit's hard to explain but all these\nthings uh\nit's obviously a lot more to it it just\ncame together to make me feel like i\ncan empathize and simplify with almost\neveryone\nto a degree where i became popular not\nbecause of\num\nokay okay okay so two things sorry\nyou gotta find so one thing is\nthat feels like i don't know what else\nto call it but a main quest\nyoink you know i don't know if you\nplayed one of these games where\nyou're like you know you're like at the\nend of the main quest and then you get\nlike disconnected\nand you have to start over at the\nbeginning it's like\nlike you know just when you were putting\nyour life together\nand like you had a stepfather in the\npicture who like\nactually treated you nicely yeah\nand your mom was also like being more\nloving towards you\nand then he murders her and kills\nhimself\nlike what is the point of progressing on\na main quest\nthat ends like that\ni don't know taking care of my sister\nthat's not the best question\nright so i understand that's what you do\nand that's probably why\nhow you get through suicidal feelings\nwhich makes sense and i think that's\ngood\nwhat are you feeling now\num i think this is um\nprobably the first time in\none and a half years but i feel like\ncrying about it\ni don't know it's um i don't really like\nas i told you before i talk about this\nin a way where as if i was talking and\ntelling someone a story so i\ndon't force people to like go in depth\nabout it\nso now it's tickling your spot that\nhasn't i don't know\nso it's kind of strange because like\nliterally on the screen\nyou're like sneaking away you've moved\nlike\nfurther and for no no i think it's fine\ni think it's just like\nit's interesting right because like\nyou're not like as the conversation goes\nyou're like\nsneaking which is fine i i don't i don't\ni think you should be allowed to retreat\nbut it you know and and i think like\nhow you know how does it feel to be\ntickling that\nspot again\nso it's hard to explain um\nit feels like um\nas i said before it's like it's like um\ni'm making it real again\ni don't i feel like at least people who\ngo through trauma can kind of relate\nto this in the way that sometimes\nthere's really bad things that happen\nfeel like\nsuddenly that 20 years back in the past\neven though it's really happened like\nway like not even that long ago\nand i don't know i feel like i've never\nreally gotten to\ntalk about it with someone in a way\nwhere i could actually um\nbe sad about it if that makes sense\nsince i was always um\nkind of like the full support pillar for\nmy family at least\nmentally um i\nplay some sort of a favaro for my sister\nmy grandma\nbasically needs me to yeah um\nit's like i don't know it's it feels\nweird to actually be\nat a spot where i'm the one like being\nin focus about it\nand in a way where i don't have to feel\nlike\nwhatever i'm saying should not be should\nnot like go over\nsome sort of limit to a point where\nsomeone dislikes me\ngood so that segues to my next question\nwhat do we think about you now\ni've honestly no clue\n[Music]\ni don't know i from experience i would\nsay there's probably\nstill a lot of people who either don't\nbelieve it\nand even worse there's probably a lot of\npeople who\num who relate to it too much\nwhich for most people i do feel bad for\num i hope no one can\nbut it's unlikely yeah\nis it okay if we if we see you\nyeah um can i tell you what i see\ni see a survivor\n[Laughter]\ni think that's what you are and there's\nlike there's respect there\nbut there's also sorrow\nlike a lot right because we can respect\na survivor but it's also like\nthere's only one way that you can become\na survivor which is by surviving [ __ ]\nand you can be likable i mean that's\ncool like i think it's neat that you\nleveled up your\nyou know learning how to talk to other\nnormies skill\nyeah next i tried to mix up my character\nyeah\nright so like you're as much as i can\nyou're like an alien in human clothing\nlike that's neat and all but i i think\nat the end of the day doc like seriously\nwhat i see is like a survivor\nyeah i don't know i always felt like um\nat first that's what i felt like too but\num over time i just started out so like\ni don't know i wasn't going to bring\nthis up because this is like actually\nsomething that\nme i don't know this is also like\npart of why i don't like myself but i\nfeel like\ni i don't know um i was too close to my\nstepfather\nso now i'm like in this weird limbo\nwhere\num i hate him or more than anything like\nhe\nit's this is gonna sound weird i'm even\nmore pissed about the fact he also\nkilled himself because it basically took\nlike my\nlike the only thing that i could be mad\nat if that makes sense\nand afterwards i also started to think\nabout how this person\nwho had such a bad thing in mind\nalso i also managed to\nhave the audacity almost to like\ncome up to my into my workplace and ask\nme for a hug\njust the night before he was gonna do\nsomething like that\nit's uh i don't know it's like this\nweird conflict and a conflict in my\nheart where it's like this person was\nbasically like my\nthe first father figure i had and also\nthe worst person would ever come\ncome across from me if it's ever come\nacross to me i guess\nit's like\nyeah i think you explained it really\nwell\ni'd be really surprised if someone\ndidn't understand that\nand can i tell you what i heard\nyeah that you know on the one hand it\nsounds like he was the first\nstable father figure who like cared\nabout you as a person\nand also that he is so\nselfish\nright for so many reasons like it's not\njust\nlike you said there are just so many\nelements to it where like\nyou know coming in and asking you for a\nhug like he gets the comfort\nright like he gets to determine he gets\nto like\nplan things out and in a sense be at\npeace like he's figured his plan out i'm\ngonna say goodbye\ni'm gonna get a hug because i care about\nthis kid and then\ni'm gonna do this thing and i'm not\ngonna stick around for the\nresponsibility\nyeah so that's pretty much what it felt\nlike he even left a note\num before he did it since he knew he was\ngonna kill himself\nand uh in that note he was\nbasically just talking straight [ __ ]\nabout my sister\nabout my mom about my brother but\ncompletely left me out like\nnowhere nothing and it just feels weird\nto um\nsorry the first time in like\nyears almost when i'm crying almost\ncrying\nbut it feels like how do you say that\nit feels weird to be the best friend of\nyour mom's murder i guess it's\nyeah i i get the sense that there are a\nlot lotta really\ndo you feel responsible\nsorry do you want me to help you stop\ncrying\nyeah sure i'm asking it's a genuine\nquestion\nyeah i'm hinted\nokay um i'll give you a second cause now\ni gotta figure\nout how i'm gonna do that\nworked good job i was like oh [ __ ]\nhe said yes i wasn't expecting that doc\nthis is the part where you say no this\nfeels good i'm i'm feeling so good\nno like i need to cry like a television\nit's like no he said yes\nwhat do i do i'm sorry he's supposed\nhe's supposed to feel free and it's\nsupposed to be good he's supposed to be\nable to handle it\nyeah it was good but it's what everyone\ngoes for\ni am quick\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\nno i mean it's it's fine yeah i felt\nlike\nif i was gonna say no that was gonna be\nweird yeah and i\njust wanna have to like watching me cry\nfor five minutes so\nyeah yeah no i mean i'm totally fine\nwatching you cry i\nyou know it's you know that's that's\ncool that's what we\ncome here to do a little bit\nif it's like if it makes if it takes\nthings into like a different perspective\nit's also rare that i\ngenuinely have so that's like the first\nfor two things now\nyeah yeah yeah well i i did get the\nsense that that was a\nnot quite as a defensive of a laugh\nno yeah that was that was genuine yeah\nit was a funny reaction um\nso doc i feel like there's a lot to say\nbut i also feel like um\nmaybe it should be said at another time\nin another place like i think it's\nimportant to process what we talked\nabout\ni'd like to still talk about one or two\nthings if that's okay with you but i\njust kind of want to check in with you\nabout\nyou know where's your stamina bar right\nnow\nokay um do you want me do you want me to\nanswer that directly or say is that like\nin regards to maybe a\nsort of aspect of my life no i mean like\nlike\nfor this conversation like where are you\noh like in terms of\nso uh actually i'm still full\nit's like i can still go on okay\nokay so so uh in my experience\nwhen we have something like this which\nis sort of like\nuh you know a good cry\nfollowed by a genuine laugh like that's\nwhat healing\nsort of can look like sometimes but it's\nalso like\nwe should give ourselves the time and\nspace\nto kind of process and decompress from\nthat a little bit\ni want to share i think a couple of um\nalmost like more practical\nthoughts and questions for you um the\nfirst is i'd like to explain a little\nbit about\num you know your experience of living in\nthe third person\nand share some terms and and concepts\nand things like that\ni'm also really curious about what your\nromantic relationships are like\noh that's all so i guess\nthat's gonna be\nyou know so so i'm i'm kind of curious\nabout that\nuh um give me just one second\nand you know just like because i i can\nimagine that\na lot of what we're talking about will\nyou know make romantic it'll complicate\nyour experience of a romantic\nrelationship\ni'm surprised that that's something you\num\nuh that's the conclusion you could draw\nout of her because it's true\num anyway i just didn't think that\nthat's something that's like correlating\nbut yeah it's very true um\nbecause i don't do would you like me to\nanswer it right now or\ni i mean so so i you know i am curious\nabout it i think that\ni imagine we could spend another you\nknow hour and a half talking just about\nthat\num so i'd love to hear a little bit but\nyeah so i mean please yeah i i mean i\ncan like\nsort of put it shortly but um i've had a\nlot of relationships\nlike in my life in general after like\nturning into a normal to like to\nto put it like that and um\nit for me it's rarely been the case that\ni was actually\ngenuinely genuinely romantically\ninvested to be honest it's more like\npeople would um come up to me uh\ni would like i would talk to them and\neventually it would\njust like the topic of romans would come\nup\nand for me it was just like a matter of\nsaying yes to someone because i didn't\nwant to see them cry and i didn't\ndislike them enough to not feel like i\ncould have that sort of relationship\nwith them if that makes sense\nbut i never really have i guess\ninfatuation like\ni don't really have any sort of feelings\nof infatuation fortunately for anyone\num and\nit usually just led to\nrelationships but for me felt like just\na friendship plus\nalmost but like you know obviously i\nwouldn't like i wasn't gonna like\ntrample my feelings i wasn't gonna\ndo like i wasn't gonna cheat on them or\nanything that's not it but more like\ni just felt like i was almost like\nyeah not not invested romantically um i\nstill\ni still enjoyed their company i still\nlike them and loved them as friends\nalmost like\n[Music]\nyeah and but that changed at some point\nwhen i met someone who's nowadays my\nbest friend\nima like ever it's like unimaginable\nhow compatible we are if you're watching\nhi\num but this person is\nit's it feels like having a mental twin\nalmost and this person is um\nsomeone who actually wasn't let's just\nsay\nthey actually don't um look for the\ngender that i am they actually look for\nwomen but\num still worked out for some reason\nbecause we were just so\nalmost i guess excited about the fact\nthat there's someone who\nis that compatible with us if that makes\nsense\nand at some point it just uh\nuh we just figured we would try it out\nworked for a few months but eventually\nyeah no it's like this is it's weird\nsince um\nlike just our sexual orientations\nweren't um\nworking they're like working in time i\nmight say yeah but we're still\nbest friends and yeah\nso someone like the most\nimportant person in my life i would say\num\nyeah so in every but ever since then\ni've tried to see if i can have that\nsort of feeling for anyone else which i\ncan't\nit's um it just won't work it happened\nfor some reason\nand it's uh but also um\ni've remembered some this is gonna be um\nthis is gonna be a bit depressing again\nuh i've remembered some stuff in my life\nthat happened which i\napparently managed to lock away which\nsomehow led me to just be almost\ncompletely unable to\num i say that\ni don't really feel like any sort of\nlike sexual attraction to people anymore\nin general\num and it feels like nowadays\nback then i used to be with a lot of\nwomen just\num because like with a lot of women who\nwere also like\nwith a lot of men i'm not i didn't like\nbreak any heights but\ni was very uh active in that regards\nbecause i felt like\nif i'm with someone if i'm uh if i get\nintimate with someone then i feel like\ni'm still desirable\nalmost that's kind of like i think that\nwas like subconsciously going on in my\nmind\nbut eventually that um\nit didn't feel like that anymore it just\nfeels like it's uncomfortable for me now\nand i don't really get like romantically\nclose to anyone anymore\nyeah okay thanks for sharing that i\nthought that was a\ngreat summary so i think it makes sense\nfor a lack of a better term um and and\nhere's so here's here's kind of like the\nmain so i think there's a lot to\ntalk about so you know\ni'll make a recommendation now and later\nin more detail that\ni think i don't know if you ever seen a\nmental health treatment provider like a\ntherapist\nyeah um like right after that uh like\nright after my mom died um\nwe were assigned to someone who was very\nkind\nuh fair but i don't know she was a\ntherapist but it also felt like just\ntalking to a friend to be honest like\nnothing really\nit there's not really anything that came\nout of it\nso a lot of times when we you know when\npeople come on here i'll say\nyou know you should consider working\nwith our coaches or work with a\ntherapist in your case i'd say you\nshould definitely work with a therapist\nso yeah i was gonna sign up for a coach\nat first but\ni figured probably that's too much i\nmean like i think i think coaching is\ni'm sure that coaching will you'll do\nwell in coaching but i i think\nfor what i'm about to explain i i think\num\ntherapy is definitely like worthwhile\nnow so i just want to be clear so i'm\nnot sure that\nyou know you have an illness or anything\ni'm not diagnosing you with anything but\nlike\nwhat what it really is huh i've been\ndiagnosed with ptsd but\nsomehow i don't feel like i it's weird\nto say it's like\nunless uh this feeling of like\ncompletely numbed out emotions\nis part of it i don't really see it all\nthat much it is part of it\nokay so we're gonna explain that in a\nsecond but but i'm not i'm not\nsurprised anyone is gonna diagnose you\nwith ptsd just to be safe given your\nstory\nbecause there's no way that some that\nthis stuff happens to you and you don't\nwind up with ptsd\nat the same time i i don't know that\nthere's really like a clinical\nlike you know there are a lot of\nquestions that when we diagnose with\nsomeone with ptsd like you have\nnightmares flashbacks things like that\nbut i think that like this is definitely\nso here's what i'm\ni'm hearing from you doc is that your\nlife and your experiences\nhave shaped the way that you interact\nwith life\nyeah right so so and the biggest thing\nis like so this is like now a\npsychological term\nso i get some degree of\ni think probably depersonalization\nso with trauma our our brains can do two\nthings\nthey can it create a situation of\nderealization or depersonalization\nso dear really derealization is the\nfeeling that the world that you're\nexisting in does not feel real\nyou are real but the world becomes fake\nso it's like i feel like\ni'm living in a video game\nthe other thing that people experience\nis sort of the opposite which i think\nyou're more depersonalization which is\nthat\ni'm like i feel like i'm not actually\nliving my life\nbut i'm watching a character who's like\nplaying a video game\ntake the actions of my life so\ni am not real i would\ni think i would even like describe it as\nme being the person who's playing the\ncharacter like uh it's free to explain\nbut like it feels like i'm\nremote controlling myself absolutely so\ndid i say the word controller\nor was i just thinking anyway so so what\ni'll like\nanyway so so the other way that i kind\nof think about it is like you know i do\nget the sense that\nyou are controlling yourself living life\nright like the doc is playing the\ncharacter\nof whatever your real name is who is\nexisting\nyou know presumably in germany in 2021\nso that sounds to me like\ndepersonalization and that's actually a\nfeature of trauma and if we really look\nat it like why does this happen\nit's because when we have these very\ntraumatic experiences\nour mind kind of unplugs from the\nreality of it\nand and and so in some cases like these\nthese periods will be like very very\nlike\nacute and temporary so people will have\nlike periods of derealization where it's\nalmost like they're like\nyou know on psilocybin or lsd or\nsomething where they like kind of feel\nlike completely disconnected and it's\nlike a trippy kind of surreal\nsometimes scary experience sometimes\nthey'll also be associated with like\namnesia episodes where like people will\nhave a fugue state\nwhere you wake up in a different place\nlike 30 hours later and you have no\nmemory of it\nso our brain has yeah it can be weird\nbut like our brain has all these\nmechanisms to essentially like\nunplug from traumatic situations because\nthey hurt and it's been really\ninteresting because the first thing that\nyou said is that you know i feel like\ni'm living life in the third person\nand then just now when we kind of when\nyou cried for\nyou know some amount of time and it's\nbeen a while you said like\nyou try to avoid it because it feels\nreal\nand i'm making it real again when i\nthink about it\nso i think it's good to make it real in\na way like\nit's hard to explain yeah so so we'll\ntalk so so that's the thing right so i\nwant you to just pay attention to like\nthe language that i'm sending back at\nyou\nlife feels like not realish right like\ni'm living it in the third person\nlike there's no point in the maid quest\nit's all about the side quests it's\nabout the periphery it's not about like\nmy life third person autopilot side\ncharacter\nside quests you are the npc in other\npeople's lives\ninstead of being the pc right like\nyou're like\nyeah like it's kind of weird like even\nwhen it comes to your romantic\nrelationships and stuff like that\nyou are the person that they have to\ndate before they find the one they love\nyou're like the npc in their story\nit's not your story they're attracted to\nyou\nthey're infatuated with you they\napproach you\nso you're like you're you know it's kind\nof weird\ni got i got a really good um this is\nsomething that i talked about with my\nold therapist once uh where she was\nasking me since i\ntold her since i also told her that i\nfelt like\nsome sort of superiority almost over\npeople um\nlike just from like a cognitive point\nnot actually feeling like i'm\nbetter as like i'm a better person or\nyeah worth more just but i can do more\nsometimes um\nuh and she asked me if i felt like a\nking i said uh and i replied and i think\nthe best\nlike the best summary of what i feel\nlike is what i said\ni'd rather be the um i know i'd rather\nbe the person telling the king what to\ndo rather than\nthe actual king that makes sense like\nsure i want to be an advisor\nyeah it feels more comfortable yeah so\nthat's the role of the npc right\nit's like you're not yeah so so i i\nthink that there's\nthere's just a very it feels to me like\nthere's a very simple connection between\nmaking it real again and\nlike living your main quest because i\nthink what you've managed to do\nis like put your main quest on pause\nlike on purpose and for survival\nbecause it's just too much man like\nthere's just too much\nright there's like all the low value\nstuff from early\non like not like and that would have\nbeen enough man that's enough to get you\non stream\nthat's enough to talk about and then you\ntoss in\nyeah go ahead uh sorry i just wanted to\nsay that\nthis is like one of the weirdest things\nto tell people but like i i do believe\nthat\nto some extent at least um what happened\nlike\nthe stuff that was continuously\nhappening in my childhood and like\nup until the point where people stopped\nbullying me and by like started getting\nactually like popular\nthat stuff probably sticks more to my\nhead than anything else it's uh\nas weird as it sounds no so i don't\nthink that sounds weird at all like so\nyou can\ni mean you even told us that it can be a\nconfusing\nobservation that your teacher bullying\nyou\nfeels more traumatic than\nyou know i feel weird even saying this\nbut your stepfather\nkilling your mom and then committing\nsuicide and and yet\ni encourage everyone to just notice that\nif we want to be good\nscientists we need to let our\nobservations shape our hypotheses\ninstead of letting our hypotheses shape\nour observations\nright and if that's what your experience\nis so much of like\nour so much of the reason that we get\nthe okay\nsorry what are you feeling\noh for me it's just um\ni don't know how to explain it it's i\nthink it's just like the nature of it\nbeing so\nsuch a continuous thing and it's not\neven just about like teachers bullying\nme i could have dealt with that it's the\nfact that\neveryone joined in and that feeling of\nlike\nthere's nothing desirable about me and\nthat's something that\nis really hard to check even now i often\nfeel like\ni can actually see a lot of people\nrelating to this when friends call me up\nand ask me to come out\noftentimes i'd say no even though i know\ni would have\nmore fun going out with them than i\nwould have staying in\njust because i don't want to feel that i\ndon't want to feel uncomfortable\nin the way that i\nfeel like when i'm outside i'm exposing\nmyself to\nthe change just the chance that i might\ndo something that might make\npeople look bad at me like might make\npeople\nlook at me in a way that's just um\nlike i'm weird against everything like\nthat even though i know it's not going\nto happen it's just something that\nalways stays in my mind yeah absolutely\nright because\nand the reason it stays in your mind is\nbecause it was put into your mind\nover and over and over and over and over\nand over again\nthis is where when we get to your sort\nof like asexuality and inability to be\ninfatuated with people because i i think\nthat like this is where you know this is\na little bit more bread and butter like\nyou have to really think a little bit\nabout if you cared about someone\nand if you were in love\nhow would it so you have that colonel\nlike you have that core of\nunlovableness right like everyone dog\npiling on\nand as long as that exists i don't think\nyou will let yourself fall in love with\nanyone\nbecause i think so too i i'd have to be\nvery very comfortable with that person\nyeah and and that's where like so it\nseems that when you get your\nyou know your your twin\nyour mental clone like that you can\nactually start to have those sorts of\nfeelings but\ni i think it's sort of like like because\nit's just too much of a risk right it's\ngonna hurt\nlike it's fine for teachers and other\nrandos to bully you like it's fine for\nyour friends\nyou don't don't really know who you are\nto like not invite you somewhere totally\nfine\nbut if you let yourself love someone\nand they respond to you in the way that\nmany people have in which you're\nterrified of happening like that's going\nto be too much\nyeah because and the weird thing is it's\nnot even like the\num it's gonna sound bad i think uh it's\nnot even like about me\nbeing afraid to lose someone that i know\nas much as i'm afraid to lose that\nslight grip on reality but i have but\nmaybe i\nis something lovable above you that\nmakes sense exactly\nso that's so you're absolutely because\nbecause right now there's still a\nquestion mark right\nin your mind there's still a question\nmark that maybe i am lovable\nbut if ever you love and that person\nfinds you unlovable then it's like it's\ngoing to be the final nail in the coffin\nyeah which which makes perfect i mean\nit's not true\nbut it makes perfect sense does that\nmake sense like do you understand the\ndifference there\nyeah okay so and this is why i think\nthis is really like therapy level stuff\nso so like like when you\nwhen you have someone who has been\nthrough as much as you have\ni think it takes really like a good\ntherapist\nto help you\nstart the process of like making life\nreal again\nbecause i don't think it's like it's not\nlike a malfunction it's a survival\nmechanism\nright so you've de-personalized you've\nlike withdrawn from life\nbecause life like hurts way too much\nyeah pretty much and this is where you\ncan also get into other kinds of things\nlike like you know maybe the reason that\nthe teacher's\nbullying you hurts more is because\nyou'll let yourself get closer to that\nwhereas like when it comes to your mom\nyou really have to do your level best\nbecause the guilt and stuff especially\nwe don't even touched on that\nbut like that you know so like all those\nthings doc i think at the end of the day\nlike i think you are a good person i'm\nnot just saying that because i'm dr k\nlike i think like\ngenuinely like you seem like a good dude\nright and i'm not trying to pity you\nbut like i think i get to a little bit\nright i don't like you because i pity\nyou but i think like you gotta let me\npity you somewhat\nand i i can like you as a person\nindependent of the pity i hope you can\nsee that like i\ni can see you as being a good dude i\nmean you're dank\nyou made some money on crypto you're\nbusting out the lull analogies\nand maybe that's you being a chameleon\nfor me\nyou know but i i don't just listen to it\nbut it's also\nyeah i mean a little bit but this is\nalso like part of my core personality\njust\nuh i like making these metaphors that\nare easy to\nso so like i can like you for those\nreasons\nand have compassion and pity because it\nsounds like boy have you been through a\nlot\ni guess that's like the sort of thing\nthat\nprevents me from telling people because\ni don't want them to think that i'm just\nsaying it for attention because that's\nlike\nbecause you saw an uncle do that and you\nknow what that you know what\nmanipulating people in the compassion\nlooks like and you don't want to do that\nwhich makes sense\nyeah so so you know just the last thing\nthat i'd leave you with doc is like\nthere's this principle from\nfrom indian philosophy called advaith\nvedanta\nwhich i think is a very useful way to\novercome conflicting emotions\nand what advice vedanta says is that\nessentially like\ndualism or conflict is like an\nartificial construction of the mind\nand that reality just has like one\nquality so like if we think about you\nknow is this a good glass of water\nor a bad glass of water like neither\nit's just a good glass of water\nwhether it's good or bad has to do with\nthe constructions that my mind puts on\ntop of it\nand so i'd say your road forward\ninvolves probably some combination of\nlike therapy to start out\nsecond thing is you have to learn how to\nlove again yeah\nand then third thing on a really\nspiritual level and i think this is your\nmain quest because i think that some of\nthese\nqualities that you describe about the\nplebs and like your level of awareness\nactually speaks to me of a certain\nspiritual\niq right like it's not even necessarily\nemotional i think\nit even extends kind of beyond that and\nthen i think your real happiness is\ngoing to be\nwhen when you can sit and this is also\nkind of involved in\nin treatment for ppd for example like\nwhen you have all of these conflicting\nemotions that like both of them can\ncoexist\nand be real and ultimately like even\nbeyond that you don't even have a head\nor a heart that's actually an artificial\nconstruction\nand what you are is like\njust something that's even formless\nbut that takes time and you know you can\ndo that long term\ni guess to a degree formless that's\nsomething but i don't really do feel but\ni guess in a more negative\nsort of way yeah so so for yeah so so\nthat that form like so even formless\nis like not advice because\nformless and form is actually like\ntwo opposites right so there's there's a\nthere's a way to even transcend that\naxis\nand not feel formless or feel form but\njust to feel\ni feel period not anything on the other\nend and i know it's kind of getting kind\nof weird and abstract there but like\njust for you to kind of exist and and as\nas you understand advice then you do\nparticular kinds of meditation practices\nyou know like this sort of idea that\nlike it clearly isn't your fault what\nhappened to your mom\nand you feel responsible so those two\nthings can feel conflicting\nand you can work on transcending both of\nthose\nyeah that's going to be hard it's going\nto be helpful\nthat's step three end of the main quest\nmy dude\nstep one is seriously you should see a\ntherapist man like and\nit's just like you you deserve some help\nin the process of putting yourself back\ntogether\nwhich i i think it's clear you're a\nsurvivor and like you've managed\namazingly well with you know\na lot of bad rng\ni mean i i mean i'd also like\nfor this session i've been only talking\nabout like bad stuff in my life but i\ni think something that really helped me\ncope with\nenough is just like the exact opposite\nof what's plagued me in my\nuh earlier just because nowadays i'm\nvery\num sort of popular where i live\num people um there's a lot of people who\ni can\ntrust um at least like my brain knows i\ncan trust them\nlike they're just metaphorically\nspeaking again my heart will never do\nbut it's\nlike um or it will always tell me that i\nshouldn't but i know that i can i love\nthese people to death\num and they've been really\ngood at keeping me company over like my\nworst time of it\nof course um as i said again um\nso it's a funny story actually i met\nthese people like most of them of my\nnowadays best friends like at all i met\nthem\nin um my time working in my casino\n[Music]\nthey used to be like in a school next to\nmine\nwe were just like very very very like\nfar acquaintances i'd say like we didn't\nreally know which other world but\nwe knew each other's names that's it we\njust started talking i just\nturned out that they were the type of\npeople who are like extremely compatible\nwith the person that i am when i'm at my\nmost comfortable\nif that makes sense because they are the\ntype to\nif they have a problem with you they'll\njust straight up tell you they don't\nhave any like\nthey don't really talk about anyone\nbehind their backs but they just make\nfun of you right in front of your face\nand then we'll also make sure that you\nknow it's okay though like they make fun\nof you but we're trying to make you\nlaugh with them\ni love these people today and they\nhelped me a lot with\num what was going on back then\nand also stupid thing to say about this\njust\nas a server on discover also there's a\nfew people who really helped me\njust by being who they are um they know\nthey're probably watching too\num oh sorry was that me or you\nokay need something\ni don't know anyway i'm sure if it's\nyeah um sorry but it sounds like you've\nhad\na lot of really important people who\nhave helped you through hard times\nboth in person and on discord\nyeah and to a degree um taking care of\nmy sister also really\num in a way gave me a goal that\ni i don't know previously didn't think i\nhad\njust something to do basically to\nyeah and um it felt really nice to like\nsee her grow up to be like a really well\nadjusted\nand nice person and i often like to say\nthat she's like\nwho i would be if i didn't have any\nproblems at all like not uh i didn't\nhave any problems but if i didn't have\nany like behavioral\nbehavior and problems if that makes\nsense she's um\ni know she's got strength i got\nweaknesses basically she's i'm very\nproud of her for that\nit's been but it just feels good to like\nthat's why i said before what would she\nsay about you\num i'm pretty sure i could just ask her\nright now but\ni'm pretty sure that she would probably\nsay um\nshe she's often said like even in front\nof her friends but i'm more of a father\nthan her brother\nand um she's also like told me\noccasionally i'm her best friend and\nit's just\ni don't know it feels nice to like know\nthat there's really some people who\ndeem me as important i guess yeah\ni would imagine you're very important to\nher\nnow we have a good cry is this a good\ncry or a bad cry yeah\ni i was hoping you couldn't see how it\nwas\ni was hoping the camera quality wasn't\ngood enough for that\nbut this is a good cry\ni guess something that i already knew\nbut just kind of proved to myself again\njust by talking about it\nthat makes sense but yeah this is a good\ncry\nyeah good well i think doc thank you\nvery much for coming on it requires\nballs of steel my friend\nit's been it's been very rewarding yeah\ni i'm just glad you um i'm glad you let\nme\nit's really nice talking to you\nseriously yeah\nyou're you're very welcome man i'm i\nreally am glad you came on and\nand you know give your sister a hug for\nme\ni would all right take care man thank\nyou so much you too\nah damn chat all right so i know we\nnormally meditate this time but i am\num dude i cannot teach meditation right\nnow"
