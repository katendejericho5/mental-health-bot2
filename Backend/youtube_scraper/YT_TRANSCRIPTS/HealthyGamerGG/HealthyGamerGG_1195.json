    "transcript": "coming out soon we're gonna be releasing\ndr k's guides to mental health the guys\nare organized into three modules\nso the depression module is designed for\npeople to understand\nlike how depression works how i think\nabout depression\nthe anxiety module is for people who are\ninterested in learning more about\nanxiety like not just from a clinical\nperspective but also understanding from\na mental perspective how anxiety works\nin the mind like where do anxious\nthoughts come from\nhow do they propagate things like that\nyou know something that i'm super\nexcited about is also the meditation\nmodule so for those of you who are\ncurious\nabout understanding you know my approach\nto meditation like what are the\ndifferent\nit's there's a lot of theoretical\nunderstanding as well as\num you know 20 practices or more so if\nyou guys are interested in that you know\ngo ahead and check out the guides\nso oh [ __ ] do i have to summarize now\nokay what we're talking about is\ndopamine detox\nokay we're talking about like the actual\nneuroscience of a dopamine detox\nand we're about to dive into how to do\nit so let me give you guys a quick\nsummary\nso we started off by looking at like\nyou know other people who talk about\ndopamine detox on the internet\nand like really don't i don't think\nthere's a whole lot of good\nclinical or neuroscientific information\nthere we went over like what the\ndopamine reward circuits are what they\nlook like and how\nmessing with the dopaminergic parts of\nour brain creates a particular\npresentation of like dopamine tolerance\nokay\nthat presentation is characterized by\nthree things so as a clinician\nthe three things that i look for when\ni'm thinking about recommending a\ndopamine detox are\nnumber one you are compelled towards a\nbehavior\nthat you don't enjoy okay\nnumber two there is a war\nin your brain between the things that\nyou know you should be doing\nand that but you can't what you should\ndo always\nloses to like this impulsive like\nbehavioral like fast food kind of\nenjoyment sort of thing\nso i should be working on my resume but\ni'm just gonna queue for\na game of valor interleague or whatever\nokay third thing\nis that activities that seem pleasurable\nto other people\ndon't seem to be as enjoyable to you so\nif you kind of check those three boxes\nand you have a\nc constant constant stream of like\ndopaminergic activity like video games\nor social media or reddit or whatever\nthen you may be right for dopamine detox\nokay now we're gonna get to the actual\nokay so dr k\nhow do you dopamine detox remember\nthat the first thing is that what we\nwant to do is give our brain a chance to\ndown regulate the receptors\nso what we're talking about is probably\na two week minimum\nof dopamine detox okay otherwise your\nreceptors aren't gonna doubt like\nthey're not gonna upregulate the way\nthat they should\nthat's the first thing the second thing\nto understand is that the main problem\nwith the dopamine detox\nis boredom so what i want you all to\nmentally prepare yourselves for\nis that the way that your dopamine\ncircuitry is wired\nthings that should feel pleasurable are\nnot going to feel pleasurable\nso what you're going to deal with is two\nweeks of boredom that's the raid boss\nokay\nit's not about like withdrawal it's not\nabout like\nyou know sweats or like you're just\ngonna be bored\nso you need to be mentally prepared that\nwhat you're going to be fighting against\nis boredom\nokay next thing to consider\nis that um what we want to really try to\ndo is minimize\nour dopaminergic activity and what i\nmean by dopaminergic activity it doesn't\nmean that you actually can't have\nfun what i want you all to minimize is\nthat compulsive behavior that you don't\nactually enjoy\nso video games social media content\naggregation so steer clear of like\nreddit youtube things like that\num some things that involve like\ntechnology are totally fine like so for\nexample if you want to watch a movie\neven watch\none movie every day i think that's\ntotally fine\ntime limited not like constant scrolling\nstuff\ntime limited enjoyable activities even\ninvolving technology are completely fine\nyou want to steer clear of the stuff\nthat your brain veges out on so don't\nbinge watch a tv show\nno vegging out while you're watching\nlike netflix or amazon prime or\nsomething like that\nno binge watching anime you want to\nwatch like\na naruto movie like go for it it's not\ngoing to be fun either way whether your\ndopamine system is messed up or not\nright so you can actually watch like a\nmovie like by all means go for it\nno big deal so dopamine detox two weeks\nmain thing that you're going to have to\ndeal with is boredom you want to cut out\ndopaminergic activities\nso these are like the the the dirty\nlike the mcnuggets of dopamine that you\ndo right so like content aggregation\nlike video games even stuff like twitch\nlike discrete technological activities\nthat are highly enjoyable\nand like a short limited time span are\nactually fine if you want to watch\none movie a day go for it okay so the\nother thing that i would recommend so\nlike like the way that you're gonna do\nthis successfully so since boredom is\nyour enemy like planning out your day is\ngonna be a huge part of it okay\nbooks audiobooks doing stuff in nature\ncleaning cooking\nadopt uh skills like like a skills\nlearning program or something like that\nthose kinds of things are going to be\nyour your bastion so what i would say is\nlike you know on a\nlet's say you want to start on the\nweekend so friday evening what you're\ngonna do is grocery shopping\nand you're gonna plan out your meals for\nlike saturday and sunday\nyou're gonna plan out okay like this is\nwhat i'm gonna do in the morning\nthis is what i'm gonna do in the\nafternoon get yourself like a good\naudiobook\nokay so like good audiobooks are going\nto be really really important for like\nrelatively boring activities so while\nyou're cleaning your kitchen like listen\nto an\naudio book find a good podcast you want\nto be like doing stuff\nand the more that you pack your day the\nbetter off it's going to be\nin terms of like you know not relapsing\nbecause remember that when you relapse\nwhat's gonna happen is your mind is\ngonna be bored and before you realize it\nyou're gonna pick up your phone and\nyou're just gonna be like on twitch or\nwhatever\nor youtube or whatever okay so social\nactivities\nare also really good so like i think\nboard game night totally fine like by\nall means get together with a few of\nyour buddies\nplay some terraforming mars like play d\nd like go for it like a good six eight\nhour session of d\nwith people ideally in person because\nyou got to be careful about computers\nbecause it's really easy to open up tabs\nwhen you get bored and things like that\nso i'd steer clear of that but like it's\ntotally fine to do\nfun activities i think if you want to do\nsomething like go camping like that's\nthe perfect time to do a dopamine detox\nbecause you got to do things like\npitching your tent and like you know\nmaking your food and then like you know\nlike changing and like camping like has\nstuff involved\nso spending time in nature going hiking\nthose are fantastic opportunities to do\ndopamine detoxes so if you guys are\ndoing something like going on a ski trip\nor going on vacation\nthis is a good opportunity for you to\nlike take stuff off of your phone right\nlike remove reddit from your phone\nremove all that stuff if you have\nsomething like a tablet by all means\ndownload like three movies over the\ncourse of a week\nand that's like what you're gonna watch\nbut you're not gonna like stream random\ncrap\nokay so next thing\num to remember is that unstructured time\nis the\nprimary source of failure in dopamine\ndetox okay\nwhen your mind is bored and you don't\nhave something planned it's way too\neasy to like dig into the the easy\ndopamine mcnugget\nall right the mcdopamy so next thing to\nkind of think about is that if you guys\nare running into trouble\ni recommend doing it with friends now\nyou don't have to do this necessarily\nwith in-person friends but i'd find like\ntwo or three people like\num you know maybe like sometimes people\nwill like get together with people on\ndiscord and things like that\nwhere you know you'll kind of decide\nokay we're gonna do dopamine detox from\nyou know june 9th to june\n20th okay or june 22nd whatever\nand then people kind of plan out okay\nwhat's your plan like let's let's like\nread a book together\nlet's like you know meet every day on\ndiscord like we'll check in about how\nthings are going like\nyou know you guys can help each other\nout a little bit um\nand yeah that's it so\nlast kind of tip is remember the more\naccessible the dopaminergic activities\nare\nthe easier it is going to be to relapse\nso what you want to do and this is kind\nof interesting so if you look at the\nresearch\na lot of relapses are not planned out\nthey're\nimpulse decisions so if you look at\nalcohol relapses for example like i've\nbeen sober for a year\ni go to a kid's birthday party my kids\nlike my kids friend's birthday party\nmy kid's friend's dad is there and he's\nlike hey do you want a drink and it's\nlike an impulsive decision it's like\nsure\neveryone else is having a beer like why\ncan't i have a beer too and then it's\nlike boom relapse\nthen i've had 10 and i'm vomiting and\nwhatever\nso what you want to do is increase the\nactivation energy and make things less\naccessible\nso uninstall all the video games and\nthen like at least you have that\namount of time so let's say that i\nuninstall everything and then i like\nstart reinstalling it when i relapse\nbut then i've got like a 15 30 minute\nwindow where i can still like\ncatch myself right i can get out of the\nhouse i can go for a walk i can even\ncancel the installation\nso you want to give yourself time and so\nlike uninstall all the crap\nuninstall the dopaminergic activities\nlog out of like your netflix account\nlike log out of your reddit account like\nif you want to you can even use websites\nthat block things\nlike reddit and stuff like that go for\nit or tools\nand so that's kind of a dopamine detox\nso two weeks highly structured activity\nplan what you're gonna do cooking\ncleaning traveling\nnature books audiobooks some kind of\ncreative work if you want to learn a\nskill\nand kind of tell yourself okay at the\nend of two weeks\ni could learn i could have learned how\nto xxx\nright like whatever you want to do x y z\ni could have learned how to speak\n100 words of spanish in two weeks and so\nwork on those goals\nuse people's help and like that's kind\nof how you do dopamine detox"
