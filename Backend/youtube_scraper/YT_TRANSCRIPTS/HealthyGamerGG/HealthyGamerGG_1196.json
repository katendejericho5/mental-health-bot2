    "transcript": "[Music]\n[Music]\nforeign\ni'm afraid i won't be able to unequip my\narmor\nokay plug in your keyboard bro hey guys\nbit of a long post\num i'm on mobile\nokay i recently have gone through a\ncompletely unanticipated breakup with\nthe first girl i think i've ever truly\nloved\nin her entirety and as unselfishly as i\nthink i can\nokay so you've unselfishly left her all\nright got it\ni don't know how many details are\nnecessary but essentially she blindsided\nme two years into a relationship\nwith which i thought the future was\nbright and clear\num i was looking at rings the week\nbefore and essentially told me she\nneeded\ntime to be single and focus on god okay\nmy concern isn't with her reasons i'll\nadmit i'm very frustrated and don't\nentirely understand what she needs\nbut i respect her decision and believe\nthat she needs\nus to be a part although her behavior\nsince the breakup has been somewhat\nconfusing\nmy concern is that i'm not sure that\ni'll ever be able to trust someone the\nway i trusted her again\ni grew up in a household with a\nnarcissistic mother who constantly told\nmy twin and i how much she hated us and\ndreaded us coming\ncoming coming home to us every day every\nday until we\nwere 18 and went out went our separate\nways\nthere's something in dr k's guides about\nthis scenario too okay we're not going\nto play that video but\nwe'll just talk about this this\nobviously led to a severe relationship\nled to severe relationship with issues\nwith which i've been\na serial dater always looking for\naffection that i didn't grow up with\nand i feel like a certain void is filled\nduring relationships\ncontested with severe security issues\nwhich has at worst led me to being over\npossessive and at best\nled me to keep my relationships at arm's\nlength and not to let them get too close\num i will give myself a credit and say\nthat i've come a long way in this regard\nokay we'll get to that\nit wasn't until this past relationship\nthat i feel felt completely at ease in\nthe relationship and 100\ntrusted the other person she was also\nhonest with me and i\nand i with her and i felt like we grew\nso well together and built an amazing\nfoundation for a future together\nnever in my mind did i think that\nbreaking up would have been an option\nfor us\nwith that trust and perspective being\nabsolutely shattered i feel i've\nreverted back to a completely apathetic\nperson\nnothing has purpose to me anymore in the\nidea of speaking or seeing anyone\nthat isn't her just sounds gut-wrenching\nto borrow a term from dr dr k used in\nthis conversation with destiny\ni feel like i was wearing emotional\narmor with her\ni was wearing emotional armor when her\nand i met and she helped me take it off\nand now i feel as as if it's stuck and\ni'm not sure how to take it off on my\nown thank you\ngreat great post um\nokay so let's talk about this couple of\ndifferent dimensions\nfirst of all huge huge props not only\nfor posting but like this person has\nobviously come a long way right like and\ni\ni love it i love so much about this post\ni mean i know that this person is\nstruggling a lot right now but\ni can't help but appreciate a lot of the\ngrowth\nthat this person has gone through so\nlike first of all they recognize\nso much about themselves and if there's\none thing that makes me\nlike optimistic about your future it's\nawareness awareness precedes control\nin all things it's a fundamental yogic\nprinciple\nwhich if you don't understand you just\nhave to think about the last time you\nhad dental work numb\ndone and you got numbed up right like\nwhen you're numbed up you can't feel\nanything\nlike that you can't control anything so\nyou have to be aware of something before\nyou can change it\nokay so this person grew up with\nnarcissistic parents\nand it took a lot of work for them to be\nable they started to enter into\nunhealthy relationship patterns\nwhere either they were like overly\ncallous\nor like other things right so what did\nthey say\nso because they grew up in a\nnarcissistic household\nyou know they became a serial dater\nfirst always looking for affection that\ni didn't grow up with\nand they were filling a void from their\nlike upbringing through like romantic\nrelationships which was unhealthy\nand then they kind of potentially grew\nout of that or at the same time\nnavigated being like\noverly possessive or overly callous\nso this is like very very um\nit's a very insightful like\nunderstanding of their situation so when\nwe grow up with people\nand we sort of have a void of emotion\nlike emotional love from parents or\nother figures\nwe try to like solve that in our\nromantic relationships and then these\nrelationships tend to do poorly because\nwe're trying to fix something from the\npast with a different person\nin our current relationship and that\njust doesn't work out\nso you become a serial dater you become\noverly possessive or overly callous\nreally actually common pattern then they\nmeet someone\nthey fall in love they're able to be\nvulnerable they're able to like connect\nwith them\nthey're able to take down their\nemotional armor right and that makes a\nlot of sense because\nover time when you grow up in a\nnarcissistic household you build up\ndefenses to keep yourself from getting\nhurt\nand now this person is like i let down\nmy defenses and this person broke up\nwith me\nand now i feel like i can never take off\nmy armor again\nso let me say this the first thing is\nthat when we go through a stressful and\ntraumatic experience there's a tendency\nto regress\nokay so this is like the equivalent of\nlike going back to what you know\nit's like so every now and then so i'm\ngonna give you guys dota analogy okay so\nlike i usually play position five so i\nusually play support\nand every now and then i'll get it into\nmy mind it's like i'm gonna play mid\nor i'm gonna play carrie and i'm gonna\nshow these noobs like because i just got\ndestroyed by some hero like some you\nknow\ncarry in the last game it's like i'm\ngonna step outside of my comfort zone\nand i'm gonna and then i get punished\nfor it right\ni try something i step out of my comfort\nzone i get punished what happens in my\nmind it's like back to position five\nback to what we know back to safe ground\nlike let's go back to like what works\nfor us like we've tried this for years\nit's worked for us emotional armor is\ngood\nright like let's go back to our\nemotional armor that's what we need\nso the first thing is that's actually\ncompletely okay\ndon't worry about it like i know it\nsounds weird i know it sounds like oh my\ngod i was able to trust this person i\ndon't think i'll ever\never be able to trust again you'll be\nable to trust again you just won't be\nable to trust anytime soon and it's\ngoing to take some time\nokay but this is how you learn how to\ntake armor off and put armor on\nso like you've been wearing it your\nwhole life and you like it took you a\ncouple years but you figured out how to\ntake it off\nand then you got hurt so then you put it\nback on you strapped it back on very\nquickly\nand the second time it'll be easier and\nthe third time it'll be easier\nand the fourth time it'll be easier now\neach time you take it off\nwill you is there a possibility you'll\nget hurt again absolutely will it hurt\nwill it suck absolutely\nbut the skill that we want to teach you\nis how to take the armor off and\non which you have to practice right so\nif you're worried that you won't be able\nto love anyone ever again and won't be\nable to trust anyone ever again like\ni think that's a valid worry but i don't\nthink that's actually what's going to\nhappen because\nwhat your story tells me is that you're\nsomeone who probably\nhas really hard problems like if you\nthink about growing up with a\nnarcissistic mother and being a serial\ndater and\nlearning how to take it off the first\ntime like you've done this before\nright you've completed it once and\nyou'll be able to do it again\nbut don't rush and don't force yourself\nright so like\nit hurts you're feeling that rejection\nyou're gonna protect yourself\nprotect yourself don't try to take the\narmor off for six months one year\nwhatever\nright it's it's actually completely okay\nyou don't i mean i know that you're\nworried about like\nbeing you know permanently this way but\ni don't think that's gonna happen i\nthink it's just\nyou're hurting right now and so like\nwhat does the mind do\nwhen we're hurt it protects itself so as\nthe hurt decreases and as you get over\nthe hurt you'll be able to take off the\narmor again it'll take some work but\nyou'll get there\nso it's okay all right so like for those\nof you who feel like you know i\ni took my um armor off and and now i got\nhurt and now i can't\nlike i'm never gonna be able to take it\noff again it's okay for you to oh wow we\ngot a thousand dollar donation thank you\nvery much\nbe cool man um and so\nuh yes sorry damn it people donate a lot\ni just lose my train of thought\nokay so you're not gonna you're not\ngonna stay like stuck forever without\nwith armor on okay so just a couple of\nthings okay\nso the first is that like you know i i\nknow that\nthis person is feeling like rejected and\nhurt but i don't know that this is a\nbetrayal\nper se right so i'd like i'd encourage\nthis person to think a little bit about\nyou know you can be you know really into\nsomeone and you guys can be like\nin a good healthy relationship\nbut i think it's important to remember\nthat um\nyou know people grow over time it sounds\nlike you were dating this person for two\nyears\npeople grow they can change they can\nsort of evolve\nas people and like it's okay for you to\nbe dating someone and like you all be in\nthe perfect relationship for that year\nbut as you each grow as individuals like\ny'all could essentially grow apart and\nlike\nyou can sort of part ways right so i'm\nhearing\nyou know this some of this stuff sounds\na little bit strange to me but\num you know like i i think it's actually\nlike\npretty respectful on on i'm assuming\nit's a woman\num yeah first girl so like i you know i\nthink if if she's in a headspace where\nshe doesn't think that like\nlike she's ready for this commitment of\nrelationship and she wants to focus on\nother issues i actually think it's sort\nof like healthy for her to\nlet you know that right here you are\nlooking at rings and she's like yeah i'm\nnot sure if this is the relationship for\nme\nor this is not the time to be in a\nrelationship for me\nand so i think it's actually i'd hope\nthat you can see you know over time that\nlike\nthis could be actually like a good sort\nof\ngood move on her part in terms of like\nnot actually betraying your trust but\nif she's not feeling the same way you do\nthen then like you know i think it's\nactually really healthy for her to let\nyou know that\nso that you don't get hurt more down the\nroad\num the other thing that i want to talk a\nsecond about is like i'd be careful\nabout boundaries here too\nokay i'll admit i'm very frustrated and\ndon't entirely understand what she needs\nbut i respect her decision and beliefs\nthat she needs us to be a part\nalthough her behavior since the breakup\nhas been somewhat confusing\nthis you got to be careful about okay\nso when it comes to a healthy\nrelationship\nwhen when this person says i'll admit\nthat i'm frustrated with not\nunderstanding what she needs\nso like this is where like it is the\nresponsibility\nof each person in the relationship to\ncommunicate\nwhat their needs are to the other person\nso this is where you know i don't wanna\nlike bash this person but i'm gonna say\na couple of things which\ni'm gonna infer for a moment they may be\nunfair\nyou all need to really stop donating\nbecause it's distracting there was a 69\ndonation from anonymous a 27 and a 250\ndonation because i want to say something\nit's important wait chat thank you for\nthe donation wait\nokay so boundaries and relationships are\nimportant if you feel frustrated because\nthis person is not communicating their\nneeds to you you can be in love with\nthem they can be amazing\nand at the same time like you got to be\na little bit careful right because\nif someone has like if she's going\nthrough stuff and is not able to\ncommunicate that with you\nin a healthy way like you got to be\nreally careful because what does that\nmean down the road\nright what if she's like going through\nanother internal crisis and then like\nyou're kind of confused because you're\ninto this and her head is somewhere else\nand like\nthat can be really dangerous and then\nthe last thing that you got to be\ncareful about is you said\ni'm confused about her behavior since\nwe've broken up\nwhich implies that you guys are still\nlike communicating or interacting in\nsome way\nand this is where i really cautioned you\nto be very careful\nbecause if you guys aren't dating and\nshe's essentially broken up with you i'd\nbe careful about what kind of\nrelationship you maintain with her\nbecause even though there may be a part\nof you that wants to be with her if\nshe's someone that's not\ncommunicating with you in a healthy way\nand like wants to work through things\nand\nit's like breaking up with you while she\nworks through stuff\ninstead of having you be a part of that\nprocess and growth which you don't\nnecessarily have\nto right depending on what she's trying\nto do but generally speaking when i see\nhealthy relationships\nthey usually like have communication\nprior to the by the way i'm dumping you\nbecause i need to focus on god\nlike that's fine like in the sense it's\nhealthy because she's sort of letting\nyou know what she needs\nand at the other hand it's like kind of\nunhealthy for her to kind of blindside\nyou\nright like that right so like presumably\nshe didn't make that decision over 24\nhours\nand if you guys are like in a\nrelationship where you're thinking about\nstuff that you don't think is going well\nin the relationship\ni strongly encourage you to talk to your\npartner about it\nright and then like give them the\nopportunity to help you through it think\nthrough it\nyou know i know that a lot of people\nkind of talk about the relationship i\nhave with my wife we've\nstruggled a lot well like we're we're\nlike you know we've talked about\nbreaking up before we've talked about\ngetting divorced before and things like\nthat like you know part of that is like\nyou know it's about having the\nconversation and being like hey this is\nhow i feel\nwhere do you think this is going is this\nsomething that we can work through\nand at the end of the day what i want\nyou all to understand is like a\nrelationship\nis a co-op game right so if you guys\nwant to succeed you all got a co-op and\nthat\ninvolves like facing difficult problems\nso if you're thinking about breaking up\nwith someone don't\nyou know i i mean you're entitled to do\nwhatever you want to like you can just\ndrop it on them\nbut i think it's like healthy from like\na relationship skills building way\nto voice your concerns with the other\nperson\nand then like give them a chance to\nrespond because maybe you're like\nmistaken about something maybe they've\nbeen feeling the same thing\nmaybe like give them an opportunity to\nkind of work on it\nyou know so like give them an\nopportunity to like play co-op with you\nespecially if you've been in a\nrelationship for two years\nokay we're gonna review comments let's\nsee let's see what people on the\nsubreddit think let's go chat\nhey man first of all i'm sorry breakups\nsuck i'm still healing from mine and\nthat was months ago i can only suggest\nwhat worked for me because i don't know\nyour situation go no contact on your ex\nthis just means that you do not initiate\ncontact with her in any way shape or\nform\nyou won't ignore her if she talks to you\nbut you need this time to grieve and go\nthrough your feelings\nand seeing talking to her when she's not\nreceptive won't help you oh this is\ngreat dude\ni love this comment because sometimes\npeople mean sometimes people think that\ngo\nno contact like they interpret that as\num you know don't even respond to her\nbut like\ni think not initiating contact is like\nreally a far healthier way to do it\nokay journal and meditate i'm not much\nof a journaling\nperson myself before the breakup but i\ncan tell you that this is the last\nchange i needed i started just under a\nmonth ago and i already feel a huge\ndifference\nthis is part uh this is the part when\nyou work through unequipping your armor\nbeautiful\ndude love the subreddit fb fbc\nmusic i don't know if that's music or\nmagic\nthanks randy and print and anonymous for\nthe donations by the way\ny'all can donate as much as you all want\nnow okay\noh and by the way that confusing\nbehavior towards the breakup might just\nbe that she is being hot and cold\nbecause she is also confused\nno contact helps with that too it might\nsound hard but at this point\nanything that is not hey babe i want us\nto work this out is just breadcrumbs\nyeah so what when when this person says\nshe is confused i think that's a good\nway to put it and\nwe're going to talk about you know i\nwant to make a guide to relationships at\nsome point\nand i want you all to understand that\nlike a lot like most human beings are\nambivalent about most things\nso like very few human beings are 100\ntowards a particular direction\nmost of the time they like their reasons\nthat she wants to be with you\nand their reasons why she doesn't want\nto be with you and that's why she's been\nin a relationship for two years\nso it's not that she's like a hundred\npercent towards breaking up it's like\nshe's probably 51\nplus towards breaking up which means\nthat she may be exhibiting a lot of\nbehavior that feels quote unquote hot\nand cold\nbecause obviously she's getting\nsomething out of the relationship she\ncares about you to some degree\nand i think this is good advice too\nthat's sort of not cultivating a\nparticular kind of thought where you're\nthinking about her all the time\nis actually really important and that's\nwhy no contact actually helps okay so\nthanks i appreciate that i've been no\ncontact since we broke up\nshe initiated all the contact we've had\nsince then as i've tried to respect her\nspace so she can get up\ncan get what she needs out of this cool\none of the hardest things is it seems\nlike i'm doing everything right\npost-breakup but i'm not getting better\ni typically recover from relationships\nin a few weeks but this one just feels\ndifferent yeah man\nfirst of all i feel for you growing up\nwith narc parents sucks i don't have any\nadvice for your specific situation but i\nwill say that many of us who grew up\nwith narc parents have similar core\nwounding\nand issues you describe are very common\nin children raised in such households\nabsolutely true specifically the thing\nabout emotional armor boundary issues\nhow you commune how to communicate your\nneeds etc\ni found this channel very helpful for\nadvice for people who grew up with\num narcissistic parents interesting i'm\nnot sure if you've\nseen it but there's a video talking with\nwilliam about healing from ctpsd\ncptsd from narc parents that's probably\npretty helpful that's a good one\ni like that one\ncool okay next\nseriously everyone thank you so much for\nthe donations everybody"
