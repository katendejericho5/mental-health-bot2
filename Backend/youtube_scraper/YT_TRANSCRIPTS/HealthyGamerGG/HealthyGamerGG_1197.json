    "transcript": "[Music]\n[Music]\nforeign\nyou want me to go yeah oh i just read\nlike need some advice\ntowards dating late in life oh 28 late\nin life\nlulls after having no prior experience\nwould you recommend first focusing on\nmyself and be building a direction for\nmyself and then begin dating or jumping\nstraight in\nnow as i may never be ready it's it's\ntough because dating at this age is odd\nwithout any experience and\ndirection in comparison to my peers\nthank you for everything\nall right i feel like i got an answer to\nthis but you can go from there\nso i i don't think that i think parallel\nprocessing\nright so i think you should absolutely\nwork on yourself and jump in\nbecause i don't think you're ever going\nto be ready so like don't let ready get\nin the way of start\nstarting um and and so\nyou know like it's tough because dating\nat this age is odd without any\nexperience and\ndirection in comparison to my peers\nthat's true that you may be quote\nunquote behind\nbut it's been my experience that like\nwithin one year\nor even less like you can have just as\nmuch experience as your peers\neven if they've been dating their entire\nlives and let me put it this way\nso there are some people so when i was\nlike when i used to play dota i mean i\nstill do but like i remember i had a\nfriend who told me that\nwithin the first six months of playing\nlike starting to play dota\nyou'll figure out like like the skill\nthat people get to within the first six\nmonths\nis generally speaking the skill that\nthey'll be at for like the rest of their\ncareers and you see this right like if\nyou play a game of dota like\nyou know myself for example like if you\nlook at my account it's like\nstarted playing dota in 2011 and\nis like in the bottom 50\nof the skill pool so if you think about\nit it's not like\nmore time actually leads to you being\nbetter at something\nwhat leads to you being better at\nsomething is intentional practice\nso you can have people who started\ndating at the age of 15\nwhere like mega chad high school junior\nvarsity\ncaptains and they still suck at it\nbecause they never like\nbothered to be intentional about\nunderstanding like how a relationship\nworks\nand then you've got people who have been\ndating for like 18 months and who are\nreally good\nat it because they actually like pay\nattention and try\nand do things like self-reflection like\ni'll have people who will come into my\noffice who will be like\n45 and have been divorced three times\nand i can imagine that if you're this\nperson you're like oh i haven't dated\nanyone i'm 28 i'm behind i'm like\nbro don't worry about it because there\nare people who are 45\nand who are like who have 25 years or 20\nyears of experience and are like still\nsuck at it\nso don't confuse so there's a difference\nbetween like sure you have no prior\nexperience but if you're like\nthoughtful about it if you pay attention\nif you\niterate if you work on your game like\nyou can catch up to people within a year\nno problem so i'd say don't\ndon't wait right so start getting\nstart putting yourself out there like\nstart looking for a relationship\nby all means continue working on\nyourself this kind of goes back to the\nfirst question about like\nyou know don't wait for it but also like\ndon't go so like\ndesperate that like you need to find it\nin the next six months\nso i'd say get started get some\nexperience level up a little bit but be\nintentional and you can catch up in no\ntime\num i am very excited for you because\nhere are a couple things that i feel\nlike i i know about you\nyou're an amazing communicator already\nlike\nin just these four sentences like\nyou've communicated so much so well and\nthe other thing is you say no prior\nexperience like you might not have\ndated somebody but i feel like you do\nhave\nexperience in that i think you might\nhave\nmade a few conscious decisions on not to\npursue\ncertain things um which\nis experience like you have like\ndiscernment\num i think\nthat if you so you're you're posing two\nscenarios you build a direction for\nyourself\nand then begin dating or you jump\nstraight in now\nand here's the thing if you build\nyourself build yourself build yourself\nand then here you are\nlike making tons of money and you have\nthis big house and whatever\nlike the person that you attract as your\nbest self\ni'm not sure is the partner you want i\nfeel like you probably\nwant a partner that's gonna support\nyour direction for yourself\nhey so i've never been in a relationship\nbut i strongly feel the need for one\nhowever i very rarely find myself\nthinking i like\nanyone and most of the times i do i then\nafter some thought realize i actually\nmight not\nhow do you distinguish between sexual\nintellectual and romantic attraction\nand how do you even know you like\nsomeone does it just happen\ndo you have to go around and look for it\ndo you have to like someone a little\nget to know them and then like them a\nlot or do you have to like them a lot in\nthe first place\nthanks\ngood question\ni feel like there's a very simple answer\ni think so too\nwhat's yours what's yours\nno i asked first so answer first\nthat is not how it works ladies first\ndude come on\nno it's gonna be the same answer one two\nthree\ni knew you wouldn't play\none two three what say your answer\ni mean to me it's like does she turn you\non that wasn't my answer\nthat wasn't what's your answer okay you\ndo yours first\ni did already can you explain it\nintellectual and romantic attraction\ndon't matter if there's not sexual\nattraction\nfor a relationship anyway so\ndoes this person turn you on does this\nperson\nfloat your boat check your boxes flip\nyour switch\nmake the magic happen\ngreat all right\nwhat was your answer i mean so i'd say\nlike\nokay so\nall right let's go back to this\nso like i you know i find myself\nthinking i i like anyone and most of the\ntimes i do\ni then after some thought realize i\nmight\nactually not how do you distinguish\nbetween these three kinds of interaction\nhow do you know you like someone so like\nthis sounds to me it'll be like overly\nintellectual\nright so it's like i find myself liking\nsomeone\nand then i think through it and then i\nrealize i might not\nso like i think the answer here is about\njust think less\nand experience more in your pants\nright so how do you even know you like\nsomeone like that's not an answer\nyou can figure out in your head it's an\nanswer that you have to figure out\nthrough\nin your pants and in your pants\ndo you have to go along around and look\nfor it sometimes do you have to like\nsomeone a little get to know them\nsometimes so i i'd say that i'd be\ncareful about what your mind\nkeeps you from doing and i'd encourage\nyou to like if you find yourself\nattracted to someone\nyou know try to have a relationship with\nthem and recognize like watch out\nbecause then your mind is going to like\nstart generating certain thoughts like\noh\nyou don't like this person for reasons\nlike a b and c\nbut the problem is that your mind can\nuse logic but like the\nlogic that it has is going to be founded\non your experience\nso you need to collect more data so that\nyour logical function\nhas more to work with how do you\ndistinguish between sexual intellectual\nand romantic attraction like sexual is\nsomething you feel in your pants\nright intellectual attraction i imagine\nis something that you're like kind of\ninterested in what this person like\nthinks and says\nand romantic is like hard to describe\nbecause i think it's primarily emotional\nit's not gonna be like\nit's not gonna be something i'm sure you\ncan learn to distinguish it you have to\nfeel it like a romantic attraction is\nlike\nyou know it's something that's felt not\nthat's it's not something that's logic\nto do\nso you know what i'd say to this person\nis if you find yourself like\noverly thinking relationships and\nconvincing yourself that you might not\nactually like someone\nlike just pay attention to what your\nmind is doing because there's a decent\nchance that\nyour mind is protecting you from or you\nhave some kind of fear or anxiety\nthat your logical system is like\nprotecting you\nyeah i was gonna ask like do you feel\nlike this person's like ashamed of\nsomething\nor like i mean you only want a\nrelationship with this kind of person\ni mean maybe shame i'm not sure but i'm\njust saying like you know it sounds like\nyou have feelings towards someone and\nyou logic your way out of your feelings\nbut why would somebody do that\nyou know we'd have to talk to them i\nthink that yeah maybe there's some kind\nof fear or like negative emotion but i'd\nsay like\nexperience more like level up like jump\ninto the water from time to time and\njust see how you feel\nyou know have a sexual relationship have\nan intellectual relationship and have a\nromantic relationship then you'll be\nable to tell the difference\nyeah okay agree"
