    "transcript": "just a reminder that like we're going to\ntalk about dopamine detox today\na lot of the things that people struggle\nwith and when people have questions like\nhow do i build confidence how do i you\nknow\nlet go of past resentment how do i\nbetter understand anxiety like how can i\ndevelop like a meditation program to\nhelp me with like\nfeelings of depression or inadequacy all\nof those questions so what we actually\ndid is take like the most\nprominent questions in our community and\nactually package them together\nin a really formal way and that's what\ndr k's guides are\nso if you guys have um you know\nparticular\nissues where like you're watching stream\nand one day you're like oh my god like\nthat's me i feel personally attacked sag\nlike oh what do i do about that that's\nwhat the guides are there for i think\nthey really cover like 70\nof the introductory questions that\npeople will have\num so you guys can you know check those\nout they should be coming out in about\na month or two so what we're going to do\nis we're just going to start\nwith googling dopamine detox\nthis is gonna explain part of the reason\nwhy dopamine detox is tough so recently\ni heard about this whole dopamine detox\nidea\nusually when i hear about these trends\nor whatever i ignore them but this time\nit was different not only did i become\nmore productive but i also quit smoking\nwow\nthat's really impressive so what is a\ndopamine detox\nso like what is dopamine great so he\nsays that it is\na type of neurotransmitter okay\nthis shows a picture of it good detox is\na process where you move something toxic\nor unhealthy out of your body\nthis is also called detoxification\nthis is where things get weird right\nbecause in the dopamine detox are we\nremoving\ndopamine from our body so however\ndopamine what makes dopamine so bad is\nthat it\nis is that your brain keeps looking for\nit over what you actually want so this\nis where we get into a problem\nso we're going to dig into the\nneuroscience here this is the statement\nis untrue\nso dopamine is what determines\nwhat you want so if we look at like what\ndopamine does in the brain it actually\ndetermines your it the dopamine reward\ncircuitry\nis a circuit of motivation and behavior\nso like\nwhen you want something that is because\nof dopamine so what does a dopamine d\na dopamine detox removes almost all\ndopamine from your body\nfor how for however you choose to do it\nso this statement is so horribly\nincorrect that it blows my mind\nokay so this is like saying going on a\ndiet is removing\nalmost all calories from your body for\nhowever long you do it\nokay the goal of a dopamine detox and\nthis is a this is a really important\npoint which will illustrate down the\nroad\nis not to remove dopamine at all we're\nnot trying to remove dopamine dopamine\nis a neurotransmitter i don't know if\nyou guys know this but like\nparkinson's disease is\nthe result of destruction of your\ndopaminergic neurons\nin a particular part of your brain and\nso like if we removed all the dopamine\nfrom\nour body what we would end up with is\nparkinson's disease\nthis is not true we do not want to\nremove the dopamine levels\nmy point here is that people who are\nspreading this information do not have\nso this was like on the front page so i\ngranted i used\ngo i don't know exactly what would\nhappen if i use google probably be\ninfluenced by my search history\nso i use duckduckgo in in you know in\nprivacy mode\nand so like the first thing that i want\ny'all to understand about dopamine detox\nis\nlike most of the information out there\nis like done\nsure like this person had a personal\nexperience and i think it's great that\nthey're sharing that personal experience\nbut like they don't understand actually\nlike what the goal is\nokay so then let's see what they say\nnext okay so step one so how do\nyou just remove it all yourself you just\nah\none of my favorites from things of the\ninternet that involves self-help and\ngrowth\ngrowth blogs you just remove it just\nremove it chat\nwhat's wrong what's wrong with you\ndumbasses\njust remove it just just log out\njust like food none just don't eat chat\nanything else that gives you dopamine\nstop eating\nlog out of all your devices just stop\nplaying video games chat just stop\ndrinking just stop doing drugs just\ncigarettes oh like no wonder he quit\nsmoking he was like oh my god\nyou just get rid of it chat for how long\ndo you do a dopamine detox most people\nsaid\nfor 24 hours however there were some\npeople like alex becker who did it for\nmuch longer oh alex becker did it for\nmarch so i decided to go for 36.\nwow that's so horribly incorrect because\nthis does not\nundersta like this person does not\nunderstand the mechanisms through which\na dopamine detox works we'll get to this\nokay\nwhere i failed will i do it again what i\ndon't understand\nmost of it chat most of it wow for a\nfail\nso i don't even know let's just move on\nto the next one okay all right\nso how to reset your mind with a\ndopamine detox\nfrom project life mastery okay is there\nsome stuff about world health\norganization\nokay there's a how to reset your mind\ndopamine detox youtube video\nthis guy is smiling and is wearing a\nsuit cool\nready to succeed faster and master every\narea of your life\nclick here to join my life master\naccelerator mastery\nlife mastery accelerator program\na dopamine detox can change your life\nokay let's look at the neuroscience\ndopamine functions in the\nneurotransmitter that is correct\nit affects many aspects of your behavior\nsome of which include learning\nmotivation mood\nthis is also correct so this this\nneuroscience seems better chat your\nbrain is addicted to dopamine and it\nwill try to stimulate\nthe repetition of behavior that produce\ndopamine in the first place technically\nreleased\ndopamine in the first place not produced\nit but close enough right we can let\nthat slide\nonce you get what you desire dopamine\nturns off as a result you end up feeling\nnot as satisfied as you thought you\nwould\nsort of okay you may end up feeling\nempty okay\nokay he talks about phenol ethyl amines\nhere\nfalling in love i'm not quite sure\nwhat this has to do a simple and\npowerful example is sugar addiction\ndopamine creates a craving for sugar\nso he talks a little bit about\nsatisfaction which makes sense so this\nis actually like this is pretty good\noh wow look discover the seven proven\nbusiness models that made me an internet\nmillionaire in less than three years\nand he's sitting on a car get\ninstant access to free video training\nand get started\nfree four-part video training and he's\nsitting on a b discover how to make\nmoney publishing books on amazon\nmastermind your way towards success\ni'm con hmm\nokay let's go back to this i'm getting\ni'm getting a little bit distracted by\nyou know i guess this guy is an expert\nat amazon\npublishing or dopamine\ni'm confused investing for beginners\nsupplements\nhow to master your mind and emotions how\nto start an amazon fba physical products\nbusiness\nshe makes 40 000 per month on amazon and\nup nlp training\nwhat it's really like to be a\nmillionaire okay i'm a little bit\nconfused about what this guy's\nokay so here's where things can get\nmessy when you stop engaging in\naddictive behaviors all at once you may\nexperience withdrawal\nsymptoms this is a dangerous way to\ndetox your system this is also true so\nwithdrawal from alcohol and\nbenzodiazepines can even be\nlife-threatening\nit becomes the only way that you are\nable to experience happiness please use\ndopamine\npeople use dopamine hits as a way to\nmask negative emotions that they don't\nwant to feel\nthis is also correct you can only\ndistract yourself for so long before\nthose emotions rise to the surface and\nstart affecting\nevery area of your life sort of true\nbest way to reset your mind is to\ncultivate here and now transmitters\nthese include serotonin endorphins\noxytocin and gaba\nokay so this is where the neuroscience\nonce again is just way off\nthese neurotransmitters allow you to\nenjoy the present moment experience\nconnection and be at peace with yourself\nthat's just\nhorribly incorrect so just to give you\nguys an example okay so this is\nneuroscience 101\nneurotransmitters are like letters of\nthe alphabet\nthey can be used for all kinds of things\nso for example serotonin is used in your\ngi system and if you get way too much\nserotonin in your gi system\nif you cultivate too much of the here\nand now transmitter of serotonin\nyou will end up with diarrhea this is\nbad\ngaba is a supr suppressing or\nor inhibiting neurotransmitter that is\nactivated in\nincreased by the use of alcohol and\nbenzodiazepines\nusing so like alcohol literally\nactivates your gaba receptors\nand and stimulates gaba production\nso this is the one thing that i really\nnotice about you know people\nlike this dude who like i'm sure that\nhe's trying to help people and it seems\nlike you know he's got\nhe's actually doing a pretty good job\nwith the science um but it seems like\nhis expert\nhis expertise is in mastermind your way\ntowards success\nhe's an internet on entrepreneur life\nand business coast\nand philanthropist right so it seems\nlike he's not claiming to be a\nneuroscientist which is great\num but like this is like so\nneurotransmitters in the brain\nand all over your body do all sorts of\nthings so oxytocin for example\nis also what causes people to lactate\nif they're you know in the postpartum\nperiod\nso like neurotransmitters don't just do\none thing they're actually like letters\nof the alphabet so if you think about a\nletter of the alphabet\nit's used in a lot of different words\nright maybe some letters may be more\ncommon\nin particular kinds of words but our\nbody like it's basically a signal\nthat the body sends and depending on\nwhere the signal is sent like in in the\nbasal ganglia\ndopamine is used for like regulating\nmotor stuff\nright like how i move so like for\nexample people who have like basal\nganglia problems will have like their\ntheir movement is not\nsmooth with their arms it'll be like a\nratchet movement so you cultivate these\nhere and now transmitters by slowly\nstarting to remove\nbehaviors that are causing issues in\nyour life\npick one thing in your life that you're\naddicted to whether it's video games\npornography social media\ncoffee or sugar give your mind a rest\nand allow your baseline to return just\njust give your mind rest chat meditation\nis a powerful way to increase your\ndopamine levels naturally and reset your\nbrain i actually don't know if it's true\nthat's true i don't know if meditation\ndoes anything to alter your dopamine\nlevels\nit may this this could be correct it's\nalso been\nfound to rebuild your frontal cortex\nthis is true i don't know about rebuild\nbut it does improve prefrontal cortical\nfunction\nwhich leads to self-control and\nwillpower that is correct\ni encourage you to do some research i\ncompletely agree because this doesn't\nseem like a whole lot of research\nyes chad i encourage you to do that if\nyou're struggling don't give up hope\nthat's cool right that's a message of\npositivity\nare you ready to do a dopamine detox\nokay so i don't know exactly what this\nperson is doing\nbut\nyeah so like this is my point like so\nhe's you know standing in a cool\nplace and speaking to people and stuff i\ni just don't know\nso this is the problem with dopamine\ndetox is like no one knows like what on\nearth they're talking about\nlike i don't get that this person is\nyou know he's this is great i mean this\nis actually pretty similar to what we do\nright chad it's like\npurpose vision spirituality like\nneuroscience sprinkled in like\nit's kind of like us right so this dude\nis like happy and he's successful and\nthere he is in sunglasses with a car\nand oh my goodness\nwow this is so this guy must know a lot\nabout\nyou know dopamine detox and then\nthere are\ntestimonials great\nyeah so i just don't know\ni don't know about this stuff okay so it\nlooks like he's got\ncourses affiliate marketing mastery\nmastering book publishing the 24-hour\nbook system\namaz amazing selling machine so i i just\nthis is my point is like people what\nwhat i think is going on right now when\nit comes to like information\nabout dopamine detoxes is that like\npeople like this who seems like he's\ngood at selling stuff right\nso his expertise is in selling and he's\nlike oh like this is great like\npeople will search for dopamine detox my\nwebsite will pop\nup because he knows about you know\nmarketing stuff and then i will talk a\nlittle bit about it and then\npresumably he will people will purchase\nmy products and services\nso this is like the problem with with a\nlot of the information about dopamine\ndetox\nis that it seems like people just sort\nof like talk about it right but really\ndon't know what they\nare talking about so now let's let's\nlet's\nbefore we get too far let's look at like\nso let's look at the flip side right so\nif i were to go to pubmed\nand do a search for dopamine detox what\nwould i find\nright so so first of all i don't know if\nyou guys know this but you know if i do\nyou should see a bunch of papers okay\nwhen you search things on pubmed so if i\nsearch for\ndopamine detox essentially i find\nnothing so narcotic antagonists and drug\ndependents\npilot studies showing enhancement\ncompliance with cin10 amino acid\nprecursors and\nand keflanase inhibition therapy this is\nthe other problem with dopamine detox\nwhich i want everyone to understand is\nthat dopamine detox has not actually\nbeen studied\nokay so there are not clinical trials on\ndopamine detox\nso everything that i wanted to share\nwith you guys today is going to be\ngrounded in neuroscience\nit's stuff that i've done clinically but\nif we really look at like have there\nbeen randomized controlled trials on\ndopamine detoxes\nthere have not right so there have not\nbeen actual studies that i've been able\nto find\nthat have a specific protocol for a\ndopamine detox\nand kind of like you know how to\naccomplish it okay\nso in a sense like while i'm being\ncritical of these people like if we want\nto be a little bit more fair we have to\nat least acknowledge that\npart of the reason that these people are\ngiving crappy information is because\nfrankly good information is not out\nthere yet so now what i'd like to do is\nshare with you guys my experience of\nlike\num you know when i've worked with people\nwith dopamine detox first of all\nexplaining to all\nhow the neurotransmitters actually work\nokay\num so we can still so this is where like\nremember that there's like the end of\nevidence-based medicine which is like\nreview articles when we have a bunch of\nstudies\nbut before that we tend to have clinical\ninterventions\nso this is where we can use our good\nunderstanding of science and we'll\npresent with you guys with like good\nliterature and stuff like that\nlike this is stuff that is really\ngrounded in a lot of science what i'm\nabout to explain\nand then we can actually like based on\nour understanding of basic neuroscience\num we can actually like elucidate okay\nwhat's going on\nin in like a dopamine tolerant brain\nlike what happens in the mind of someone\nwho's playing video games\nwe can even hypothesize based on what's\nhappening in the circuitry in the brain\nwhat the symptoms should present as and\nwe'll sort of do that and then y'all\ntell me\nlike okay actually yeah that makes sense\nthis is actually what i experience\nand so if that's the case then we can\nsort of do an intervention\nwhich i've done and i'll explain how to\ndo that intervention and clinically what\ni've seen\nokay so let's start by understanding\nwhat dopamine actually does in the brain\ndopamine pathway so this comes from\nwikipedia\nokay so this is a picture of a couple of\nimportant\ndopamine pathways in the brain the ones\nthat we're going to be looking at\nare the mesocortical and the mesolimbic\nso\nand then the vta is also important so\nthese three parts of the brain are going\nto be kind of where your\ndopamine reward and behavior and\nmotivation circuitry are\nso this is important to understand about\ndopamine okay so dopamine is involved\nin not necessarily the the feeling of\npleasure\nokay and we're gonna explain this a\nlittle bit later and this is where a lot\nof people get tripped up\ndopamine is the reward is the\nneurotransmitter that our brain uses\nto reinforce a behavior first and\nforemost\nso it's not necessarily the feeling of\npleasure because as we're going to\ndiscover\nhedonics and motivation are actually two\nseparate\nneurochemical neuro circuits okay\nso hedonics is the ability to experience\npleasure\nand dopamine is involved in motivation\nand reward\nso when we engage in a behavior that\nrewards us in some way\nthat reinforcement is going to be via\ndopamine and the two pathways we're\ngoing to be looking at the most are the\nmesocortical\npathway and especially the mesolimbic\npathway so this is where the mesolimbic\npathway is in\ninvolved in reward related cognition\nwhich includes incentive salience this\nis huge\nso wanting and enjoying are actually not\nthe same part of the brain okay which is\ngoing to become important in a second\nso dopamine is what makes us want stuff\nthe liking and pleasure\nis involved in the mesolimbic pathway\nbut there's actually a separate circuit\nthat involves that more which we'll dig\ninto once things get complicated which\nis how the brain works\nsorry to say it's not like super simple\nand so it also has to do with aversion\nrelated cognition\nand positive reinforcement what aversion\nrelated cognition means\nis that like basically if we avoid\nthings so we can reward behaviors\nthrough\na version as well so like if i don't go\nto you know if i don't ask anyone out to\nprom or if i don't go to prom\ni'm gonna be like more peaceful because\nyou know i'm scared of going to prom i'm\nscared of feeling alone i'm scared of\nall that stuff\nso dopamine is involved in that kind of\nmotivational circuitry way as well it's\nlike the motivation of avoidance\nthe mesocortical pathway is a little bit\ndifferent because this involves\nexecutive\nfunction so what that sort of means is\nthat our mesocortic so our mesolimbic\npathway\nthis pathway here okay which goes from\nthe ventral tag mental area\nup to i forget what this part is this is\nthe oh nucleus accumbens\nokay so uh this pathway is really around\nmotivation and reward\nin the mesocortical pathway so remember\nour frontal cortices are the ones that\ngive us a sense of control and willpower\nso what this means executive function is\nthe ability to plan out a task\nover time and execute on those pieces so\nif i want to find a job that involves\npolishing up my resume it involves\nupdating my linkedin profile\nif it involves like these other kinds of\nthings then applying to jobs responding\nto emails\nsending you thank you notes after\ninterviews all of those things are\nare essentially executive function\nand if we really look at it this is why\nit's important if we\nreally look at it the key thing about\ndopamine here\nis that that circuit is not rewarded for\neach of those steps right so the\nmesocortical pathway\nis the one that allows us to take\nactions\nwithout being rewarded each step of the\nway so when i\nupdate my resume like i don't get a\ndopamine hit right\nif i apply like update my linkedin\nprofile i don't get a dopamine hit\nand yet our brains ability to\nessentially\nexecute long-term tasks that are not\nimmediately rewarding\nare governed by the mesocortical pathway\nand so what we actually find is that\nwhen people get\ntoo like dopaminergic dopamine heavy\nwhen their mesolimbic pathway\ndominates their mesocortical pathway\nwhat we actually wind up with is people\nwho\nare unable to engage in action that is\nnot\nimmediately rewarding so it's sort of\nlike they can't do what they should and\ncan only do what they want\nokay so like you guys let me know\nwhether that\nsort of makes sense in terms of\nsomething that you struggle with\nbecause that's like this is what the\nneuroscience tells us right so we can\nlook at\nthese two different functions of\nexecutive function\nand like mesolimbic what it does and we\ncan draw hypotheses\nbased on the science of what the\nclinical presentation\nof this messed up circuitry looks like\nso the next thing that we're going to\ntalk a little bit about\nis the anterior cingulate cortex okay so\nnow i'm going to explain\na couple of things to y'all the anterior\ncingulate cortex\nis involved in something called effort\ncomputation\nand what effort computation means is\nthat there's basically\nany time we take an act this is the\nanterior cingulate cortex\nanytime we we are calculating an act or\nany\ntime we're thinking about doing\nsomething our mind essentially has\nsomething called an effort calculation\nso it sort of says like okay i can do\nthis\nand get this reward this requires this\nmuch energy for this kind of reward\nor i can invest in invest in a lot of\nenergy for a lot of reward\nor i can best invest a lot of energy for\na low reward\nor i can invest very little energy for a\nhigh reward right\nso i can do something like spend 10\nyears becoming a doctor\nwhich is a high effort high reward\nsometimes i can even do things that my\nmind will tell me like oh there's no\npoint in asking this person out because\nthey'll never say yes\nso that's a high effort low reward\nstrategy\nand then even there are things that are\nlow effort high reward strategies like\ni'm gonna spend all my money on dogecoin\namc and gamestop right and just just\ni'm just gonna you know i'm gonna spend\nten bucks and i'm gonna make ten\nthousand it's\neasy chat easy done okay so this the\nanterior cingulate cortex is involved in\nall of these effort computations\nand essentially what happens um is that\nwhen we get\nimpaired dopaminergic neurons in the\nnucleus accumbens\nright so the nucleus accumbens is in the\nmesolimbic pathway\nwhat it actually does is changes the\neffect of our anterior cingulate cortex\nand when it does that what we\nessentially do is are unable to choose\nanything except for the low reward low\neffort option\nso i'm gonna draw this out a little bit\nokay so let's understand\nwhat we're talking about from the top\ndopamine is a diverse structure\nthat does all kinds of stuff in our\nbrain it does things like\nmotivation and reward executive function\nand even things like movement so we\ndon't want to empty our brain of\ndopamine that's a terrible terrible idea\nmeans we won't be motivated to do\nanything so when we look at motivation\nreward this is something called the\nmesolimbic pathway\nand we look at executive function this\nis mesocortical the limbic system\nis our emotional circuit of the brain\nthe cortices are our frontal lobes okay\nso mesocortical is planning\nmesolimbic rewarding behavior\nokay so sometimes there is a tension\nwhere the mesolimbic beats the rewarding\nmesocorticle\nwhat that means is that we're going to\nchoose rewarding behavior\nover like planning and executing tasks\nover long periods of time\nif we meditate what we can do is reverse\nthis\nbecause we're enhancing our cortical\ncircuits we're going to be able to take\ndo planned actions more than like\nimmediately rewarding actions so if we\nlook at our frontal cortex\nthe frontal cortex is involved with\nthings like\nimpulse control right so i don't know if\nyou all remember but when we looked back\nat the wikipedia thing over here\nwhat we see is that adhd is deficient in\nboth of these pathways especially the\nmesocortical pathway\nmore so than the mesolimbic pathway next\nthing that we're going to talk about now\nthis is where things get even more\ncomplicated the anterior\ncingulate cortex so this involves effort\ncomputation\nso what this means is that sometimes\nyour mind is saying\noh this is not worth it and when you\nalter the dopamine system here\nthis actually goes and messes up the\nanterior cingulate cortex\nand messes up your effort computation so\nwhen you impair\ndopamine the only choice that you can\nmake is low effort\nfor low reward right remember we've got\neffort and then we can sort of do a two\nby ten two table\nreward so high effort low effort\nhigh reward low reward and basically\nwhen we mess up our anterior cingulate\ncortex this is the only quadrant\nthat we can do things in we can't afford\nto do anything that\ninvolves high effort for a high reward\nand so like this is where\nthis is going to become kind of\nimportant because what we see in a\ndopamine detox is essentially going to\nbe that\npeople sort of get stuck in this\nparticular pattern so like what is the\nneuroscience\ncorrelation with like what all of these\nthings what does this mean\nhow is this going to present clinically\nokay what this\nsort of means like this is what i look\nfor in people who have messed up\ndopamine circuits okay\nthe things that you are motivated\ntowards\naren't fun that's a better way to put it\nso this is key because essentially what\nhappens\nour mesolimbic pathway is sort of active\nbut something about our reward circuitry\nbuilds up tolerance\nso it doesn't actually feel fun so this\nis the other thing that happens is that\nthere's like remember there's this war\nbetween the mesocortical and the\nmesolimbic\nso the second feature of like when your\ndopamine circuits are messed up\nis that you should do something\nbut you can't this like weird basal\nmesolimbic circuit\nis actually ending up being stronger\nthan the mesocortical circuit\nwhich in turn means this part of your\nbrain that is telling you okay these are\nthe planned actions i need to take\ni need to execute them in this way is\nlosing to the immediately rewarding\nbehavior\nthis is just more of a clinical\nobservation this isn't really borne out\nin the neuroscience\nbut things that's that other people\nare highly motivated towards are hard\nfor you\nso this is not really borne out i don't\nunderstand the neuroscience of this\nstatement but\ni wish i had something for you all there\nbut i i just don't\nso like these are the three signs of\nlike you needing a dopamine detox number\none\nthere seems to be a high degree of like\ncompulsion\ntowards a behavior that does not feel\nenjoyable so if we kind of think about\nthat like what is going on there\nright because what's happening is that\nthe part of your brain and this is why\nit's important to understand that\ndopamine is not\njust a pleasure chemical because you\nwould think that if it was just a\npleasure chemical and you\nno longer felt pleasure then you would\nno longer engage in the behavior\nright so like if i don't enjoy playing\nvideo games why the hell\nlike if i play league of legends for 10\nhours a day and i'm frustrated during\nmost of it\nwhy the hell do i constantly do that\ncrap so\nit's kind of weird right so we have to\nunderstand that dopamine is not\na is not just a pleasure chemical\nbecause if it was a pleasure chemical\nand i was motivated towards a behavior\nand that behavior wasn't fun then i\nwould no longer be motivated towards it\nso what that means is that like we have\nto understand that there are two\ndifferent circuits going on in the brain\nand that like\ndopamine can reinforce behaviors\nwithout necessarily leading to enjoyment\nand it's that discrepancy which i really\nfind people to be like\nuh those are the kinds of people that\nbenefit from a dopamine detox\nso what's happening is your mesolimbic\ncircuit is\nactive and is pushing you towards a\nparticular behavior\nbut then like your ability to experience\npleasure from it\nhas actually developed a sense of\ntolerance what this means is that if\nso like the thing about dopamine the\ndopamine detox has nothing to do with\nyour dopamine level it has everything to\ndo with your dopamine receptors okay so\nbasically this is what happens\nin my brain i have a neuron\nthat releases a chemical signal into\nsomething called a synaptic cleft\nand in the synaptic cleft i have on the\nother side a neuron that has receptors\nso what happens is i essentially like\nyou know i release neurotransmitter from\none\nneuron and it moves over to the next\nneuron and activates the signal\nwhat happens over time is that if i\nrelease a bunch of signal\nthe receiving neuron is like hey i'm\ngetting way too much signal\nand down regulates the receiving end of\nthe receptor\nso the way that i kind of think about\nthis is like imagine that i have\nyou know a speaker volume and then the\ncomputer volume\nif my computer volume is jacked all the\nway through the roof\nwhat i'm going to do is turn down the\nspeaker volume so that like\nthe end up like the the the sound that\nthe\nvolume of the music ends up being\npleasant right and if\nmy computer volume is is way down\ntowards the bottom what i'm going to do\nis\nturn up my speaker volume so that once\nagain i have an equilibrium of like\nvolume that i'm listening to so our\nbrain does the same thing with\nneurotransmitter signals\nso for those of you who use caffeine\nlike when you start drinking caffeine\nit can like keep you up all night but as\nyou drink caffeine on a daily basis\nyou develop a chemical dependence which\nmeans that you down\nregulate your caffeine receptors in your\nbrain so that if you want to stay up all\nnight with caffeine you actually have to\nend up drinking more\nso this principle of physiologic\ntolerance is very well understood\nis the same reason that you know people\ncan be like you know light drinkers or\nheavy like\nheavy drinkers right like you can be\nsomeone who's a lightweight or a\nheavyweight when it comes to drinking\nand that all has to do with your degree\nof physiologic tolerance with alcohol\nthere are other things involved it's\njust not neurochemical because your\nliver is involved and stuff like that\nbut basically essentially the more\nsignal you dump into your brain\nthe more your brain is going to down\nregulate that signal so this is the\nother important thing when that person\nsaid that you do this for 24 hours 24\nhours ain't going to do crap\nbecause the the neurophysiology of\nwhat's\ngoing on is receptor adapt adaptation\nso receptor adaptation requires weeks to\nequilibrate\nso if you think about if you go off of\ncaffeine for 24 to 36 hours\nyou're not going to be detoxed off a\ncaffeine right like\nyou're just going to be miserable for 24\nhours and you're not going to be totally\nfine\nso if you also think about alcohol\naddiction so for example alcohol\naddiction can take anywhere from like\nfive to six days for the medical you\nknow the medically dangerous part\nand then you can even have lingering\neffects of chronic alcohol use for weeks\nto months\nas your neurochemistry like re-adapts\nand your neurons start\ndeveloping new cellular machinery and\nstuff like that it gets actually quite\ncomplicated\nso what we're going to do for dopamine\ndetox the goal\nis to fix that receptor regulation\nokay so when i bombard my mind with\ndopamine so now we're going to get to\nthings like\nvideo games and technology so when i use\nlike when i when i go under reddit and i\nwant you guys to really pay attention to\nthis for a second okay when you go on to\nreddit like i know i do this\nwhen i don't even think about it right i\ndon't think to myself oh i'm really\ngoing to enjoy doing this like wow i\ncan't wait to hop onto reddit today\nit's sort of like my mind is like kind\nof bored or there's some sort of like\nyou know gap in what i'm doing and my\nmind reflexively goes to like\nsocial media or like reddit or something\nlike that and i get like i click on the\nmeme and i get that quick hit that quick\nhit that quick hit\nit's not actually fun it's not like when\ni'm i'm you know if i go on vacation i\ndon't like think to myself oh man it\nwould be so awesome\nto spend six hours a day just like on\nthe internet browsing memes like you\ndon't look forward to it\nbut it still is reinforcing in some way\nso you could you guys see how it's like\nit's not really like a craving\nit's like sort of like a neuroscientific\nbehaviorally reinforced\nmechanism that's active and we get that\nquick dopamine hit we get that quick\ndopamine hit we get that quick dopamine\nhit\nso what we want to do through a dopamine\ndetox is reset\nour levels because what happens is when\ni play a video game for 10 hours a day\ni'm getting a constant stream of\ndopamine that constant stream of\ndopamine is going to down regulate my\ndopamine receptors\nthis also we don't actually hasn't been\nstudied so this is a clinical\nobservation\nbased on principles of neuroscience okay\nand as our dopamine receptors get down\nregulated we will enjoy things less\nbut something weird happens because the\nreinforcement circuitry the behavioral\ncircuitry seems to stay intact and that\nhas something to do with probably\nother neurotransmitters and things like\nthat that's like the endocannabinoid\nsystem\nand habit formation and stuff i'm not\ngoing to go into that now but there's\nanother interesting there's a part two\nto this lecture which is really fast so\nessentially what happens is as i get the\nconstant stream of dopamine it's sort of\nlike if i'm drinking sipping\ncoffee throughout the day my brain is\ngonna adapt to that level and it's gonna\ndown regulate my dopamine receptors\nthen we wind up in this situation where\nnow that my dopamine receptors are kind\nof down regulated\nother activities start to feel less\npleasurable\nbecause if you think about the dopamine\nhit from let's say\nreading a book or going for a walk these\nthese things start to feel less\npleasurable so this is the next thing to\nthink about\nwhen you need to dopamine detox is do\nactivities that\nnormal people seem to enjoy seem to like\nnot be very enjoyable to you\nif the answer is yes then you need a\ndopamine detox okay\nso like just to kind of summarize like\nwhat we're looking for for dopamine\ndetox is if your life has a constant\nstream of dopamine and what we're\ntalking about is video game usage\nsocial media usage these are the things\nthat kind of like bombard your brain\nwith dopamine\nif that's the case and you wind up in\nthis clinical presentation\nof feeling compelled or a compulsive\nbehavior\nthat does not actually lead to enjoyment\nso if you play video games for 10 hours\na day\nand like don't actually have fun then\nyou may need a dopamine detox if you\nspend a bunch of time on social media\nand don't even enjoy it\nyou may need a dopamine detox one person\nis mentioning pornography\nthat could absolutely be a part of it\nright so this is why we're not going to\nbe intervention specific\nwe're not going to be like you know\naddiction specific what we're explaining\nis the\nneurochemistry of the dopamine reward\nsystem and so whatever you do that\nresults in this presentation\nmakes uh dopamine detox potentially\nuseful for you\ndoes that make sense like it's not about\nwhat the addiction is it's not what\nabout what the behavior is it's about\nthe clinical signs of a particular\nbrain that is messed up in terms of\ndopamine reward system\nokay so you feel compelled to do\nsomething but you don't\nenjoy it things that other people tend\nto be able to do\nor be able to enjoy that you can't enjoy\nyou may want to consider a dopamine\ndetox and then the last thing is sort of\nlike\nyou're unable to control the part of\nyour mind that is or there's a war\nbetween like\nwhat you know you should do but you end\nup just going towards the compulsive\nbehaviors over and over and over again\nlike that's the third sign\nokay"
