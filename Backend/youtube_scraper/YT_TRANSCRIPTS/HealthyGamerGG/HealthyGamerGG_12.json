    "transcript": "for people that you want to help be\nresponsible for helping them don't be\nresponsible for their problems so when\nyou make their problems your problems\nwhen you get overly invested let's find\nyou a girlfriend let's find you a\nboyfriend let's find you love I'm going\nto work night and day to find you love\nthat's a recipe for disaster because you\ncan't find them love you can't control\ntheir behavior but you're trying to\nachieve a particular thing in their life\nit actually has a paradoxical effect\nwhere the more invested you become the\nmore it damages you and the more lazy\nthey become as you take responsibility\nfor the outcome they stop taking\nresponsibility for the outcome and a\npattern that I've seen in my practice\nover and over and over again is that the\nmore empathic that you are the more\npeople rely on you and become like\nbasically lazy right"
