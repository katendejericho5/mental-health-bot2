    "transcript": "and when i played there was like no\ncoaches\nthere was like nobody supporting you on\nthat stuff so it's like\nit's like well go deal with yourself\nthis is definitely tough yeah go deal\nwith it yourself sounds like the story\nof your life brandon\nfun times\nuh by the whole monastery thing what do\nyou mean\noh no one can oh you're sorry you're\nyou're muted sorry sorry sorry that's my\nbad i forgot one thing keep going\nyou're good now you're like you know\nwhere you cast off all your belongings\nand\ngo to like live in the temple with all\nyou know the other\nthe monks and all that or did you just\nlike study and\nno so i um i st so yeah it's a good\nquestion so i tried to do that so i i\nspent one summer in a monastery at the\nage of 21\nand decided i wanted to become a monk um\nso i\nyou know was learning from monks and i\nwent to them and i said i'm ready to\ntake my vows and i want to become a monk\nand they said you're crazy and then\ni was like what no but i really love\nthis i want to do this and they're like\nthat's totally cool so you can come here\nand study with us but you're not ready\nto take your vows\nwe want you to finish your education we\nwant you to go get a doctoral degree\nyou can come here and study with us you\ncan stay as long as you want to\nbut you need to complete certain worldly\nduties\nand then if you still want to take your\nvows at the age of 30\nwe will take you and i said sure you're\njust like no thanks\nlike no thanks afterwards no no i was i\nwas like yeah absolutely sounds good\nso then i spent several years doing what\nthey told me to do i spent every summer\nin india\nusually like winter breaks as well while\ni was in college\num so would spend like anywhere between\ntwo and four months\nin monasteries also traveled to\ndifferent monasteries\nacross india south korea and japan\nand studied with different teachers um\nand then really wasn't sure like which\ntradition to take vows in um\nyou know i had my original teachers and\nthey said like you can come back when\nyou're 30.\nand i was like cool and i went back\nevery year and they continued to teach\nme\nand then um how do you know i'm 38.\nuh so did you end up going i mean i'm\nassuming you didn't go back and commit\nso why'd you not commit because i met my\nwife and fell in love\nand as it turns out my teachers were\nvery very wise\nand understood that my desire to become\na monk\nwas out of escapism it was a genuine\nlove for what i was learning but there\nwas a heavy\ncomponent of escaping an ego\nso they were like okay that makes sense\nthey were like you can't give up a life\nthat you don't have right so they were\nlike go and build a life\nand have something worth giving up and\nthen give it up and become a monk\nthey're like go build something make\nsense\num i understand yeah and you're like so\nyoung when you're like going in and\nyou're like\nyou know how like when you think\neverything is like magnified so much\nhigher when you're younger\nand it's like uh yeah like i've done all\nthis stuff and i've experienced a lot of\nthings like no you haven't\nyeah absolutely so my teachers were very\nwise then they're still\nwise now i think they understood me\nand they still taught me a lot and then\ni ultimately also discovered or realized\nalso through their help\nthat becoming a monk is just something\nthat you do on the outside\nright so like there are actually like\nyou can become like\nthe real work of a monk is not has\nnothing to do with the outside world it\nhas everything to do with like\nthe internal world so i still practice\nin a robust way that i would if i was a\nmonk\nuh because everything's internal doing\nlike the mantras and all that\nyep i was actually learning about um\nlike zen buddhism and all the you know\nsome of those other things and like\nit's interesting how they like one of\nthe health aspects that they\nhave like that they that we don't really\nthink about in like our society is like\nsat like the inner monologue like sound\nwithin you know like that's why they do\nmantras to like replace\nlike how your brain is like going down\nlike a different path you can like do a\nmantra like make it go down like another\npath\ni don't know i'm like i'm like not like\nthat well versed in it but i was like\njust like\nreading the lip button a little bit and\ni thought that was interesting that is\ninteresting\ndoes that appeal to you oh yeah i've\nlike\ntried it you know it's like when i feel\nlike uh\ni don't say like i'm getting overwhelmed\nbut like my brain is like going off\nsomewhere that i don't want it to go\nand like i i don't i don't wanna sound\nlike a self-diagnosed like add or\nwhatever but it's like definitely my\nmind wonders a lot so it's like\nit's like i sometimes do that just like\nrecenter myself\ni think i try to practice mindfulness or\nwhatever cool\nso let's start by just uh can you tell\nme what you go by or what i should call\nyou today\nyou just call me brandon it's okay and\nwe seem to be lagging a little bit\nyeah so um and brandon so it sounds like\nwe're talking about focus today\nuh yeah we can talk about that we talked\nabout any other thing you'd be honest\ni was like uh you guys asked me what i\nwanted to talk about and then\ni ended up like watching uh the ice\nbeside poseidon episode you guys did\nand like as he's going through all that\ni'm like wow there's like a lot of\nparallels here that i'm like\nhey i'm like that's not good\noh my goodness okay yeah yeah so i was\nlike uh we talked about anything though\nlike i'm\ni'm an open book and uh you know\ni'm i'm definitely like self-aware of\nlike all the\ni'm like a work in progress you know\nwhat i mean sure aren't we all\naren't we all yeah so tell me where did\nyour work in progress begin\nlike what tell me what tell me a little\nbit about yourself man\nabout myself oh you want like my whole\nmy story or\nsure well i mean basically i\nyou know normal person went to high\nschool in small town\nin like greenville south carolina um\ndid that uh i was addicted super\naddicted to video games\nyou know to the point where like\nbasically i would spend\nall my high school time like sleeping if\ni was in class i was sleeping\nand then if i went and then half the\ntime i wouldn't show up so i just stay\nat home and like play games\num so then i like missed so many days of\nmy uh high school year that i\nuh they're like you have to repeat this\ni just dropped out and like\ngot my ged or whatever and then i ended\nup going to like community college like\nworking random jobs\nand uh and then i\njust got bored of that and one day i\njust randomly signed up for the navy\ni was just like okay this is like super\nborder school\ni just like on a whim signed up for the\nnavy did that for like three and a half\nyears\nand then i got out of that went to\nuniversity um\ni was studying uh pre-med i wanted to be\nlike a\northopedic surgeon um and then in my\nsenior year i ended up\nplaying in some tournament uh in europe\nand we ended up like winning it for like\nleague of legends so\ni ended up i was like wow this could\nlike actually kind of take off and i had\na very addictive personality kind of so\nand i was super\neven though i was like doing school and\nall that i was like still super addicted\nto games\num so i just on a whim dropped out my\nsenior year and\nended up like playing pro league uh for\na couple years and like coaching it\nand then i stopped doing that and\ni just i stream like a game called tft\nand i do like day trading on the side\ntoo\nand that's pretty much that yeah but\njust to paraphrase my entire like i um\ni feel like my entire 20s uh is like a\nvery\nuh very self-destructive let's just say\nthat\nlike i think i think i spent like my\nwhole like early 20s like drunk\nlike per like literally permanently\ndrunk and uh\nand then the second half of my twenties\ni just spent like permanently high so\ni definitely have like a very very\naddictive personality\nand that's something like i had to like\ngain control of and\nyeah definitely led to some interesting\ninteresting\nlife uh some interesting life moments\ncan you i i find myself being incredibly\ncurious can you share\nsome i would you know tease\nwell yeah like i obviously i drink a lot\nwhen i was in the military because\nthat's just what everybody does\nand then drink a lot in college that's\njust people are partying and then\nbut like that carried over into like\nwhen i was like playing games\nuh like on the team and i basically\nwould like we do our scrims and then\nlike the\nmoment the scripts would get done i\nwould just get like i would just drink\na lot and i would become a very like uh\ni like to argue with people like i'm not\nlike physically fight but like\nverbally fighting stuff like that or\nlike it like really\nlike messed up with like a lot of my\nrelationships with people and stuff and\nmy teammates\nand then obviously like uh like when i i\nlike wouldn't get good sleep because you\nknow when you go to sleep when you're\ndrunk or whatever uh like messes up your\nsleep and i can like go into practice\nand then it just like becomes this like\nself-destructive cycle\nand yeah i don't drink anymore just to\nlike\nfair praise on that but it's like uh\nyeah why not it's definitely\num i just don't feel the need to and i\nmean i still drink socially like if i go\nout like\nmy friends will have like a drink but\nlike i don't drink at home i won't keep\nit in the house\num i just kind of like fell out of it uh\nactually\nthe moment i stopped is when i started\nsmoking weed and i was i\nreplaced one vice with another vice like\nin my mid-20s\nand it's like i said i have like a very\naddictive personality\nand what does that mean a very addictive\npersonality you keep watching that\nphrase when i get into something\ni'm like uh i say\nlike i just it could be a game even like\nit's like i become\ni don't know for games in particular\nlike i become obsessed with it\nlike it's all i can think about like all\ni want to do\num and i think i use it uh i think i do\nthings like that i don't want to say\nit's a form of escapism but it's like\nit's more so like uh i guess i'm like\nreally bored of like\nnormal like everyday like living kind of\nthing i don't know i'm using it as a way\nto like escape from that you know\ni think that's like what i like i kind\nof like came to the realization of so\nsounds like you've had a lot of varied\nexperiences man like you've like lived\nlife yeah i guess yeah we've been out\nthere\nyeah it's you know playing\nprofessionally\njoining the navy struggling with an\naddictive personality\nlike you know odd jobs community college\npre-med\ndreams of being an orthopedic surgeon\nthere's like there's like a lot in there\nbro\nyeah we're in there doing stuff not\nanymore though i just i just a bum now\ni just play video games yeah how's how's\nthat going\nuh it's okay i stream a game called tft\nit's like a\nit's like a car i want to say like a\ncard game like a glorified card game so\nit's like a chill game where you can\njust like hang out and talk to people\nso i kind of do that and then\nuh just try to do trade stocks on the\nside\nwhatever you know all the normal stuff\nyeah and\nhang out with the my\nso and all that and you know\nso so how do you understand your\naddictive personality how can you\nexplain to us what that\nis like what it's like\num\nfor like games or like when i was when i\nwas drinking or like i feel like it\nvaries from thick thing to thing\nit's because it's like uh\ni feel like um at least like passively\nmy mind\ni i find like if i'm not like super\nengaged i\nam very very active like i'm always like\nvery active mind like always thinking\nabout like a million different things\nand i find that if like\nat least in my 20s if i didn't like numb\nthat out like my brain would just like\nexplode\ni'd just be like thinking about too many\nthings like the future like all this\nyou know all like but you know all the\nnormal stuff right that\nany person would think about but it's\nlike can you give us an example of what\nyou would think about if you didn't numb\nyour mind\nuh just like uh just existential crisis\nuh like what am i gonna be doing in the\nfuture\nlike uh past interactions i've had with\npeople or like future interactions i'm\ngoing to have with people\num like where am i going to be and like\nyou know i'm sure like everybody worries\nabout this kind of stuff but it's like\nmy like it's like very overwhelming for\nme and\nuh and like i couldn't turn it off so\nit's like i guess i would just drink to\nturn it off\nor i would like smoke myself into a\nstupor to turn it off\nor do like whatever you know and uh\nthat was basically like my coping\nmechanism with it and then\ni got like a lot into like philosophy\nand\nkind of did like some other interesting\nlike therapeutic stuff to\nto to like kind of break myself out of\nthat cycle i want to say\nso like i'm good now when did you\nrealize why did you try to break out of\nthe cycle can you help us understand\nlike how you came to realize that this\nwas a cycle and that it needed to end\nwell it's realizes like well obviously\nlike\nit's pretty easy to realize that being\ndrunk all the time is bad\nand and also like i didn't like smoking\nbecause even\nuh just to kind of like give you info\nit's like when you smoke all the time\nit's like uh\nuh i think it like builds up like a a\nmassive\nlike the more you smoke like it it it's\nlike um\nover time will like build up like a\nmassive layer of anxiety so it's like\nyou're\nusing it to escape from something but\nit's like actually like\nbuilding up like what you're trying to\nescape from you know what i mean\nso it's like and then one day it just it\ncame to like a brim and i just like\ni just stopped smoking too so it's like\nbecause like when i would be\nwhen i would be out of like the out of\nthe state of smoking i would get like\nwe're normal i would have like massive\nanxiety because it's like i'm\ni'm not used to like the nor the\nnormality you know what i mean\nso yeah so it's like and then one day i\njust realized like i just\ni i just some reason i just like didn't\nneed to do it anymore i don't know\ni was like woke up one day i just didn't\neat it i was like i'm just gonna stop\nthis\nand i just like was okay i don't even\nunderstand how it happened but\nwhat do you think about that well what\njust stopping\nyeah how does that that's kind of\ninteresting\nwell i mean at the time i was reading a\nlot of like a philosophy\nand um like uh one\none thing that really like helped me was\nlike this concept of uh\nbasically like the past not existing in\nthe future not existing the only thing\nthat\nexists in is like real is the present\nand basically like being in the present\nbecause a lot of my issues of like the\nanxiety were like\nlike thinking about the future right or\nyou know or thinking about things that\nhappened in the past\nright but if you like remove those like\nconcepts as ideas\nand like the only thing that is is real\nor like matters to you and there's in\nfront of you\nis like right now like this conversation\nwith you right now and then\nbringing your mind to like being like in\nthat moment\nat all times you know so i just like\nit sounds ridiculous to try not to think\nabout the future but\num just more like yeah just more\nfocusing on the present\nand that just that concept helped me out\na lot\nso it sounds like you were because\nhere's what i'm imagining\nbrandon is that there are people who are\nwatching this right and like\nso in my day job i'm actually like in a\nd well i don't even know if that's true\nanymore because this has become my day\njob but\num in in my day job as of one year ago\ni used to be an addiction psychiatrist i\nmean i still have i still see about 10\npatients a week\nbut um you know the the interesting\nthing is that\nlike when i when i talk to\nmy patients when i work with patients\nmost of them know\njust like you said like they know that\nlike drinking every day is not a good\nidea that using pot every day is not a\ngood idea\nthey'll even realize that like oh my\nanxiety is actually getting worse and\ni've become\nchemically dependent on marijuana\num and and then like\neven though they know that they still\nwake up\nin in on a given day like that anxiety\nthey experience is so bad that they like\ncan't\nthey literally like can't stop right and\nthen it becomes a routine\nyeah it's like a routine so so it's kind\nof interesting to hear you say one day i\nwoke up and i just ah\ndidn't do it anymore well it's not like\nit was like a build up it's like i was\nmeant it's like i was mentally\nconditioning myself every day\nlike tweaking like little knobs and\nthere's other things that like went into\nlike me helping i don't know if\ni can talk about them but uh it's like\nuh but it's like i was tweaking knobs in\nmy brain\nlike a little bit every day and then\neventually i got it to like\ni'm like reading things you know like\nlistening to lectures\nlike um talking to people like that like\nand kind of like trying to tweak my view\nlike a little bit every day and\neventually it's like i got\nmy mind to like the view i needed to\nto just stop so it's not it's not like i\njust welcome like here i am it's like\nyou know\ni i had to work on it for sure and and\nso what i'm kind of curious on is if\nyour mind is\nyou said you got your mind to get the\nview that you needed\nyes which implies that there is some\nkind of force within you that is guiding\nyour mind\ni mean don't we all we have our inner\nmonologue or ego\ni i i don't know is it what would you\nbecause because when you say you got\nyour mind\nto where it needed to go what is the\npart of you that knew where you needed\nto go\ni mean the part where it's like i know i\ndon't\nlike how i feel like when i smoke all\nthe time or when i drink all the time\nlike obviously it's i don't know\nlike a moral barometer is not the right\nword but it's like you know it's not\nright you know and like\nand you don't feel right what would you\ncall that part of yourself because it\nsounds like it's actually not a part of\nyour mind\num because that's right\nis that's what you would call it yeah\nit's your ego is your monologue\nokay so it's an inner monologue so you\nyou wouldn't you would separate your\ninner monologue from your mind\num i mean i mean your inner monologue is\nyou that's who you that's\nthat's your mind isn't it doesn't it i\nmean you could say like your mind is\nlike your subconscious and like all\nthese other things that are like going\ninto it\nright but like your inner monologue is\nlike your mind that's like on the\nforefront right\nwhat does that mean on the forefront or\nit's like the one that's like\nactive that you can like like you can\nyou know get like conversations with\nyourself and like yep all that kind of\nlike it's the one that you're\ni don't see you interact with but it's\nlike the one that you like\nis like the loudest you know like the\none that you can yeah because\ni know the subconscious plays like a big\nbig effect on all this kind of stuff too\nbut\nso when you say inner monologue you're\ntalking about thoughts\nin your head the conversation between\ntwo parts of you\nyes i see and and so\none of those and you would call one of\nthose your ego\nyeah he goes who you are like it's um\ni mean that's basically what it is it's\nyour your identity as a person right\nlike to yourself yeah yeah so i\npersonally i would say that who you are\nand your identity are two separate\nthings\nto yourself i mean not obviously like\nyour identity to other people is much\ndifferent than the thoughts that are\ngoing on in your head and\nyou know that you think yeah so i would\nsay that your ego and who you are\nare two separate things what would you\ndefine like uh\nso what would you define the ego as the\nsense of i so like i have a sense\nof who i am right yes like i have a\nconstruction in my mind about who i am\nyeah but that yeah but you're like\nthat's what i'm talking about like i'm\nchiseling away\nlike at that identity because you can\nget locked into like\nthis is who i am or like this is what i\ndo every day or like this is my routine\nyou know yeah so and so who's doing the\nchiseling if you're chiseling on your\nidentity\nwho is it that's chiseling\nuh i'm not i mean it's like\ni mean my me just being self-aware and\nit's like i\nam aware that i want to change this and\nthat's just the only way i know how is\nlike my little like gradual changes\nso if you look at the the yogic model\nwhich is going to be consistent with\nlike zen buddhism\nthey would say that there are more\nwe'll highlight three right now there\nare three discrete parts of your like\ninternal experience\none is awareness one is identity\nand one is mind okay that's why you were\nlike\ntrying to separate them okay i guess\nyeah and i i think you\nyou know it sounds like you actually\nknow that it's just it's an issue of\nvocabulary and like precision\nin terms of our language but you know\nlike\nit's the part of you that is aware of\nstuff\nthat is sort of like looking from the\noutside and if you're chiseling away at\nyour identity that makes perfect sense\nand also when you kind of talk a little\nbit about inner monologue right like\nit's sort of like\nthere's a part of you that is aware of\nstuff\nand that awareness can only exist in the\npresent whereas if you think about\nthe identity the identity is something\nthat's a little bit more longitudinal\nyour sense of identity\nby necessity involves or not by\nnecessity but generally speaking\ninvolves\nthings from the past and things in the\nfuture and also your mind has things in\nthe past and things in the future\nbut awareness can only exist in the\npresent\nand that if you were in the present then\nyou would be\nsitting more in awareness and that's\nkind of something i was talking about\nearlier i guess\nyep exactly so that that's how i would\nthat's how i would arrange these puzzle\npieces\num which it sounds like you unders you\nknow sounds like we're talking about the\nsame thing\nyeah yeah yeah\nso you mentioned that there are certain\nthings that you may not be able to talk\nabout i was kind of confused about that\nuh\num you don't have to talk about it i'm\njust confused why you wouldn't be able\nto talk about something is that like a\npersonal barrier or like a tos thing or\nwhat\nuh not personal barrier i'm fine um i\ndon't really care actually i'll talk\nabout it there's like uh\nokay let's say you talked about the the\nice beside and stuff right\nand this is okay i'm gonna get like\nmaybe i'll\nget murdered for this but it's like okay\ni feel like i'm on the spectrum a little\nbit\nand i feel like a lot of gamers are on\nthe spectrum a little bit and sense of\nlike\nuh very hard to deal with like empathy\nand like uh missing social cues and\num you know all all that jazz\nuh and it's like that's something i had\nto deal with uh i was watching yeah\nthat's why i mentioned the ice beside\nepisode is\ni feel like i had to deal a lot with\nthat when i was like in high school and\nalso like in my earlier years in my\nrelationships with people\nand it's like that's another like knob i\nhad to like try to tweak as like i went\nthrough this whole process\nand um yeah and like also in this whole\nprocess\nlike uh one of the things i did i ended\nup that i don't know\ni don't talk about it like i ended up\ndoing like mdma to like help me\nwith like this and uh\nand like that kind of like uh helped me\nunderstand like logically like what\nempathy is\nand like help me like also bring like a\ndifferent level of happiness\nand like the way that like i think like\nbefore like my earlier years like\nit was like the vice and like the cycles\nand all this other things that like\nhonestly brought me happiness but like\nit gave me a new look on like\nwhat can create happiness in my life and\nlike the feelings about like\nbasically it's like when i was on it it\nuh i was like\ni wanna i was thinking what makes me\nhappy like in this moment\nbesides like the chemical effects and\nall that and it i\ncame to the conclusion it's that it's\nthe experiences that i'm having with\nother people\nand like sharing an experience and like\ncaring about other people\nand all that kind of you know uh and\nthat's like what brought me happiness\nright\nso like before my early years i had\ntrouble with empathy right\nand now it's like logically i can\nlogically empathize with people\nbecause like i have that understanding\nof\nlike i can logically like piece i can\nlike piece it out i was like this is\nwhat it means to like carrot you know\nyeah yeah that's like that's like one of\nthe things that also like helped me\nbreak me out of the cycle and like help\nme a lot\ni i was wondering if you were talking\nabout psychedelics so i think you know\njust to\ntoss out a couple of things one is that\num\nso i've actually had so there are a lot\nthere's lots of research ongoing i don't\nknow if you follow any of this stuff\nthere's an organization called the multi\nathletes yeah yeah\nso um we act like the i i have a good\nrelationship with the person who\nfounded and runs maps he actually came\non stream like six eight months ago to\ntalk about the work they were doing\num and so rick is a phenomenal guy i\nthink there's a lot of\nrecognition now within the psychiatric\ncommunity\nthat um some of these substances have uh\nlike potential to improve lives um i\nthink you got to be\nso i've had actually patients who have\nhad like lifelong addictions who have\ngone to\ntreatment facilities outside of the the\nunited states\nand have had really amazing healing\nexperiences\nand i've also had patients who\nusing these experiences have developed\npermanent and crippling\nlike mental health disorders yeah\nit's definitely yeah i mean\nit's definitely it's definitely\nsomething i feel like you have to go in\nwith the\ni don't say a purpose but it's like a\nlot of people can\nuse like that type of stuff as like a\nform of escapism in its own as well i\nthink that's like when the issue comes\nin so\nyeah i mean so just you know for anyone\nlistening out there i i wouldn't\nrecommend like\nyou know because i think your mileage\nmay vary and we just really don't know\nwhat's safe\num and i've seen you know we hear i've\nseen success stories and i've seen like\nreally dangerous things happen to people\ni have definitely seen it too yep so\nwould not recommend it\num i think for for people who are\ncurious uh i actually just had a\nconversation with someone at maps this\nweek\nand i was a little bit curious about you\nknow when do you think that fda approval\nin the united states for some of these\nthings could happen could happen as\nearly as 2022.\nso we may be looking at you know they're\nin phase three clinical trials so like\nyou know people may be able to use these\nin a therapeutic manner within the next\nyear under guidance and like you know\nbeing assured of the quality of what\nyou're getting and stuff like that\nbecause that's a huge issue\nwell they're already doing it for like\nptsd patients and stuff aren't they\ntrials trials okay okay so phase three\nclinical trials\nis the last stage of clinical trials\nbefore something gets\napproved as a treatment okay okay that\nmakes sense\num and then you can you know so\ni advise everyone to wait until you can\ndo it in a safe way\nso dr k is saying invade and invest in\nshrimp stocks\nuh yeah i wouldn't listen to me in terms\nof i mean a stock advice\nyeah um but what so can you tell us a\nlittle bit when you said that like\nyou know you related to some of what ice\nposeidon was saying like\nwhat was your experience in high school\nuh my high school it's i'll just like\nkind of talk earlier kind of like how it\nwould be\nbasically my parents got divorced when i\nwas like younger and they were both\nworking i had three sisters so we had\nlike a big family\num so my parents they were working like\nboth full-time jobs\nand so like i then they come from work\nto be like super tired right\nso basically my relationship with them\nis like non-existent\nyou know so i would just like go off to\nmy room and like play games all the time\n24 7.\nand i did have a small group of friends\nlike i would hang out with and all that\nbut it's like i feel like that that\nwhole like situation\ndefinitely hurt my\nability to understand like i don't say\nlike what a uh like a normal human being\nrelationship\nis you know like the yeah all the little\nins and outs of it and that definitely\nlike carried over and like\nthroughout like my whole life and i\nguess so\nin high school and all that you know\nbeing pro gamer\nuh just a lot of experiences and that's\nsomething like i've always liked been\nbattling with\nand that's why i brought up like the\nwhat is something you've been battling\nwith\ni just how to explain it um i feel like\nespecially like earlier in my life it\nwas very difficult to have what i would\ncall like a normal\nlike what i think like the i like the\ni don't say like the template but like a\ntemplate friendship with somebody or\nlike\ninteract like the relationship with\nsomebody here\ncan you explain how that was hard for\nyou or like what would happen\nwhat does that look like empathy was\nlike extreme like\ni like basically felt like no empathy um\nit's like it was very hard for me to\nlike understand like how the other\nperson was feeling\nor like and like i would miss social\ncues a lot like\ni would just say like random stuff that\nlike would like hurt them you know or\nlike do random things that would hurt\nthem\nand like i did i couldn't like\nunderstand\nlike it like didn't mentally process to\nme you know can you tell me a story\nabout that just to illustrate\nso i can because you're giving me kind\nof a conclusion i was hoping to get a\nlittle bit more raw data\na story uh\ni'll just use like something that's in\nthe public uh when i was like a pro\ngamer i would like get\ndrunk all the time and like there's like\na incident that's out there like where i\nended up arguing with one of my\nteammates like and it was on\nlike we had cameras set up all like\nthroughout our house and like would\npretty much stream or\nstream is 24 7 which is a ridiculous\nidea of course\nand i ended up like fighting with one of\nmy teammates that was like it was\nactually my good friend like\ni really liked the guy um and i just\nsaid like a bunch of [ __ ] that\nwas like really hurtful and like mean to\nhim and uh\nyeah and then it's like i look back on\nit now and it's like uh\nyeah and like in the moment like i don't\nunderstand like any of the stuff that's\ngoing on like obviously i'm drunk too\nbut it's like\ni can't i don't like understand the\nsituation you know\nand like that's like been like a\nrecurring theme\nlike throughout my like whole life so\ni don't know what's it like to live a\nlife where you don't understand the\nsituation\nwell it's like i understand the\nsituation but i don't understand like\nthe feelings involved\nthat's like a better way looks like you\nfelt something just now\nyeah now i that's what i like i brought\nat the end of\nit's ridiculous but yeah yeah uh\nit's like i can yeah like now like i can\nlike logically it's like more of like a\nlogical feeling and then it like\nthat like so it's like something like\ntriggers and it's like oh yeah i'm\nsupposed to feel this\nit's like it's really weird\nyeah so i don't know but it's it's\ndefinitely been like\nsomething i've like had to deal with\nlike a very very\nvery a lot of difficult stuff in my\nearly 20s with it but\ncan you tell me a little bit more about\ngrowing up so you said you have three\nsisters\nolder young girls i have one older she's\na psychiatrist too\nand uh two younger so and then\nyeah my mom my dad and what was it like\num\ngrowing up in in your household\nuh well my favorite well before my\nparents got divorced we were like the\nnormal family\nyou know pretty normal stuff dad get\nhome from work hang out with him\nlike my mom just stay at home take care\nof the kids\nbig family and then like one day my\ndad like he had like a really good job\nand he like he's like i'm gonna\nhe told my mom like i'm gonna quit my\njob and i'm gonna go like start my\ni'm gonna go start a business and my\nmom's like\nyeah wait you have like three kids you\ncan't do that you know like you have to\nlike\npay for everybody right like and then uh\nhe's\nlike well screw this i'm out and he just\nlike feeds down like started his own\nbusiness\nand uh yeah and then like there's like a\nwhole like\nyou know all the like the divorce\nturmoil with that and\ndid the divorce i think she said both of\nyour parents worked growing up\nyeah so like after the divorce like my\nmom's working full-time\nand yeah then my dad's working full-time\nand so it's like and then we bounce back\nand forth between like who have custody\nof us\nand like uh you know and\nwhen they come home from work like\nthey're just burnt out\nthey're like my dad's like trying to\nmake this get this business off the\nground my mom's like\ntrying to work full time like take care\nof like three kids so it's like i don't\nreally have like that relationship with\nhim you know\nhow old were you when they got divorced\num\ni think i was like eight or nine\nprobably yeah\nand what was your understanding of why\nthey got divorced\ni i understood what's going on at the\ntime i mean i was young but it's like\ni don't understand like the the like i\nlook back at her now i can like\ni try to put you know put myself in in\nboth of the people's shoes\nit's like why did my dad you know leave\nand do this and like\ntry to think like why my mom like what\nshe was going through\num like obviously i understand the\nsituation better now but it's like\nwhat did you think at the time at the\ntime\nuh i think it might i think my i mean\ni thought i thought my dad was just like\nseeing some like woman or something like\nthat you know like that's like how you\nalways see like\nyou cheated on me like that kind of\nthing like on the movies and the shows\nand all that\nbut it's like i kind of like more\nunderstanding why like\nwhy he didn't like why he left more it's\nnot just like something like that\nso he when you say left you're not\ntalking about the job\nhe left his job and my mom like refused\nto let him quit his job right\nbecause yeah so they got a big fight\nover that\nand then they my dad just like\ni'm gonna do this no matter what and he\njust ended up leaving to go do it\ngot it so yep\nbut that's like an interesting thing it\nsays like he's like putting himself\nbefore like\nhis like kids is a relationship all that\nkind of stuff so it's like\nthat's something like it is that how you\nsee it\nwell yeah that's like uh i mean\nyou could see it as like he's like\ntrying to go like i can make more money\nin the future or i can feel more\nself-fulfilled\nit's basically it's like uh something\nwhere that person is like trying to\nself-fulfill like find like a\nfind like a new new purpose a different\npurpose you know what i mean\nso have you ever talked to him about\nthat yeah i talked to him about it\nmy relationship my family's good it's\nnot like there's no like bad blood or\nhurt or anything like that what's your\nunderstanding of of\nafter having talked to him how does he\nhow did he kind of share what his\nexperience of that was well i pretty\nmuch just\nsaid what i just told you now and he's\njust like\ni mean because i don't want to like just\ni don't i don't like just like going\nafter people um\nwithout like i want to like try to try\nto\nempathize and understand like their\nposition before i'm just like\nyou know screw you man like that kind of\nthing and so\nand so like i talked to him about it\nlike i understand like\nwhy he did it and it's like but it's\nstill like hurtful that\nyou know he would put himself before\nlike\nthe three kids like if you make you have\nthree kids like obviously\nyou you you're responsible for them you\nknow like\nlike you've accepted that you've sex\nwith that responsibility and it's like\nbasically you're like casting off that\nresponsibility\nlike that life-changing uh\nexperience of having kids and stuff um\nyou're basically just like running away\nfrom things you know yeah so brandon i'm\nasking you because you're saying you try\nto understand right\nyeah you try to understand other\npeople's perspective that's the goal\ncorrect\nyes so you're telling this story yeah\nin the story he's the bad guy\ni don't want to say he's about i don't\nlike the idea of bad guy or a good guy\ni i understand but the way that you're\ntelling the story i think that's the way\nhe's coming across\nyes right yeah so so so in an effort to\nunderstand\ni'm asking you if you guys talked about\nit what did he say\num i mean he basically like confirmed\nwhat\nlike kind of stuff i'm talking about\nright now and\nobviously he's like apologetic and\num and yeah i mean\nuh it's like difficult to to like\nunderstand like what a person is\nthinking and he kind of talked about\nlike feeling trapped and\nuh yeah cause like you know it's it's\npretty easy for people to get like\ntrapped in their life\nsituations and people try to escape in\nlike all sorts of different ways\nsure and this this is you know all about\nthat right\nyes so this is his way of escaping so\nyeah what do you what do you think about\nhim feeling trapped\ni mean doesn't everybody feel trapped in\nlife it's some point\nso i don't know what\ni'm confused about how that statement\nrelates to my question\nright so you're about to i feel like\nit's like\nit's understandable that's that's how i\nfeel about it\ni mean i i don't know and that's\ninteresting\nthat goes back to like the logic thing\nit's like\nyep i'm gonna suppose you there for a\nsecond because i think you actually\nmeant the exact opposite\nis it yep so this is so let's understand\nyour communication what you say\nand what your logical mind tells you and\nmaybe what your emotional\nfeeling tells you so i asked you how do\nyou feel about him feeling trapped\nand then you're like doesn't everyone\nfeel that way and the interesting thing\nabout that if i really had to kind of\nlike if i had to put my money somewhere\nwhat i'd say is that\nit doesn't like everyone deals with this\n[ __ ]\nand like they all manage so like\nhe should have learned how to deal with\nit too i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut that's the emotion that i got from\nyou yeah and then when i ask you what\nyou mean you say well it's\nunderstandable whereas like actually\nwhat i'm hearing\nfrom you is like the exact opposite that\nlike he should have manned up\nand you know everyone deals with that\nand like we all deal with it\nlike he should have dealt with it too\nyes i can yes i understand\nyou see how the logic and the the\nfeeling are a little bit maybe different\nthere\nyes i can see\nwhat do you think about that uh\nmaybe i'm even just like wording it\nwrong it's like\ni i don't say like i try to like\nsolidify like what he did\nbut it's like i'm trying to like\nunderstand like why he would do it and\nit's not like i'm giving approval one\nway or another\nit's just like okay i see why you did it\ni don't think you should have done it\nbut it's like i get it that's like more\nlike the interaction that's going on\nhere\nyeah so brandon let me know if i step if\ni\nstep out of line okay okay so here's\nwhat i'm\nhearing from you okay here's what i'm\nnoticing you let me know what you think\nokay so i'm hearing that you had some\ndifficulty like connecting to people\nunderstanding people and that\nyou maybe spent some time escaping from\nunclear exactly what you're escaping\nfrom\nsomething like an addictive personality\nand then you've actually like worked at\nit right like you\nread philosophy you studied things you\nyou know had\nmind-altering experiences you've engaged\nin relationships you've done a lot of\nself-reflection\nyou joined the military you've done a\nlot of things to try to grow as a person\nand now you've gotten a lot better\nat understanding other people to the\npoint where it sounds like you have an\nso so good job\nyou know i'm hearing that you have\nrelationships and things like that so\nyou've like\nlearned and grown a lot when it comes to\nlike developing empathy\nyou can cry now right like that these\nare the things that you've\nyou've leveled up fair\nyes so interestingly enough what i'm\nactually finding is like something\nkind of weird that's happening which is\nthat i think the next phase of what you\nneed to understand is more internal as\nopposed to like understanding other\npeople's points of view\nbecause that statement that you tossed\nout i think is a good example of where\nall of your lessons of empathy\nhave actually are actually like\nreshaping\nsome of your instinctive responses to be\nlike\nand then like blind you to your own\nexperience of stuff\num oh you think i should be like more\nbitter towards like what happened or\nlike more aware of like that feeling or\nlike i i understand what you're getting\nat but it's like do you think that i\nshould be\nlike experiencing a more powerful\nfeeling of like\nagainst like so we're just talking about\nthe dad's situation right you think i\nshould be\nmore like in tune with like feeling\nagainst like this or like with my\nfeeling of like that\ni'd like disagree with it or i would i\nthink you should have more awareness of\nthe way that you feel\nwell i'm definitely aware how i feel on\nit and i definitely\ndisagree with it and i i'm aware that\nlike all the\ntrust me i'm aware of all like the\nturmoil that like the divorce brought me\nand like my family and my mom and my\nsisters and all that\ni'm definitely aware that but it's like\nit's been it's\nit's such ancient history it's so long\nago that\nit's like i feel like i'm a very\nforgiving person\nyou know and i understand that\nlike i'm not the same person today that\ni was yesterday and i'm not going to be\nthe same person\ntomorrow you know that i am today and\nit's more like that i\nit hurt me but it's like i'm okay to\nlike move past it sure\nthat's more like what i'm like pushing\nout when i when i say it like that\nyep yeah i'm definitely i'm definitely\naware of like how about you hurt me\nyeah so you know just to push back a\nlittle bit on that brandon what you're\nsaying makes perfect sense\nnow we're gonna get a little bit nuanced\nokay so i think i i think you've\ngenuinely forgiven your father\ni think that like you said you know\nyou're not making him out to be an\n[ __ ] you can understand he felt\ntrapped like he sounds like he's a good\ndude\nlike we don't want to and so that's why\nit's kind of weird because i i\ni don't i think you've forgiven him i\ndon't know if you've moved past\nin what way well just because the way\nthat you talk about it right so like\nwhen you tell the story\nand this is why i'm asking you for\nstories because i think you've got like\na really good\nyou've done a really good job of like\nconstructing what you want to believe\nand you can tap into that and at the\nsame time like when you tell the story\nit like you make him sound\nlike it's not the story is not like one\nof\nunderstanding it's one of like yeah he\nkind of [ __ ] up there\nbut he did yeah it's like\nyeah right so so so and that's fine too\nright and and so it's interesting\nit's like weird i think it's like it's\nvery subtle so i it's clear that you've\ndone a lot of work\nand so i think that like the more we\nlearn about ourselves like the higher we\nclimb\nright like in terms of our league and\nthen like you're at\nyou're at like challenger level now in\nterms of like self-growth and\nself-awareness\nand i don't know about that but i hope\nsomeday yeah\nright because i'm still detecting a lot\nof emotion essentially that you carry\nwith you\nyeah so i don't get the sense that\nyou're at peace\nabout it have you forgiven\nyes do you live your life yes\ni mean it's not something that i guess\nit's like it's not something i think\nabout\nbecause it's like like i said it's so\nlong ago like i'm i'm an old fart\njust like you it's just it's\nit's too much of a lifetime ago you know\nand it's like i\ni understand like it shaped me as the\nperson i am\nand it's like i don't want to say like\nmaybe\nmaybe i find resentment in like how it\nshaped me as a person in like my earlier\nyears\nmore like maybe that's like what's\ncoming through but it's\nit's not like it active\nthing that i'm like against i i get that\ni i don't i don't i'm not trying to\ndemonize your dad or try to convince you\nthat you hate him because i genuinely do\nthink you're in a good place i do hate\nhim now\nhe convinced me i hate him now but i i\nso tell me a little bit about um what it\nwas like\nafter they got divorced and what it was\nlike\nyeah uh with the family well\nuh they would like take turns like\ncustody like sometimes\ni think there's like one time like me\nand my older sister stay with my dad\nfor a couple of years and then like my\nlittle sisters would stay with my mom or\nlike\nlike my mom would have like full custody\nof all of us and like\nthey're like constantly fighting in\ncourts about like random financial stuff\nand\nlike they were literally like always\ngoing to court\nand always like always fighting and\num yeah so i pretty much just like\ndeflected from all that i took up the\nwhole like just shot myself in my room\nplay video games all the time you know\nlike\ni got starcraft i got a cable modem like\nlet's go you know like\nand then i started interacting with\npeople\npeople like minecraft us uh protoss\nnice yeah um but uh yeah so it's like\ni i had the internet i had the internet\nlike at a very early time like when it's\nlike fledging state\nand i was like interacting with people\nin there like making friends on there\nand\nbasically using it like that that world\nis like it as a form of escape\nsure and so what were you escaping from\njust dealing with like my family like\nfighting all the time\nand just i just like didn't\ni guess i didn't know how to like\nprocess it all and i just\nand also like i just really liked\nplaying games\nlike uh i i like the the\npuzzle solving aspect you know like i'm\ntrying to like figure out how\nto to solve this puzzle like to win like\nat all costs kind of thing\nso do you have a sense of i mean what\nlike so you said\ndealing with it do you like what was it\nlike when you had to deal with it what\nwas it like to go to court\nand i never went to court with them but\nlike\nyou would always always hear about it\nand then my parents would always be\ncomplaining about like oh your mom or\nyour dad\nand then like and i would never see them\nhalf the time anyways it's like i said\nthey'd come home from work\nthey'd be like super tired and\ni i never really felt like i had like uh\ndeep or meaningful conversations with my\nparents at any point like in my younger\nyears you know like not in like the way\nof like\nthat i think like your normal person\ndoes like\nthere was no birds in the beast\nconversation you know there's no like\nlife conversations or anything like that\nso like nothing like preparing me for\nanything like that kind of stuff\nand i definitely feel like that kind of\nlike carried over into\ninto like my interactions with people\nand you know there was like no parenting\ngoing on there\nyou know it was just like well uh we fed\nyou\nlike go have that air like we you know\ngot your school supplies like good luck\nyeah what was it like to grow up without\nparents\num i mean it's like i said i just\nit's just like figure it out on your own\nkind of thing so\nuh and yeah just\nit's like definitely like trial and\nerror kind of thing you know yeah\ncertainly sounds like a fair amount of\nerror yeah fair amount of error\nso we got there and\nand what was it like being in high\nschool can you tell me a little bit\nabout that\nuh high school i would literally just\nstay up all night\ni was i was like a decent student i was\nin like honors classes and all that\nmess um but like\nyeah i was gifted but not using it so i\nwould like when i was in school i would\nliterally\nbe asleep like 75 of the time so i would\njust stay up all night and like play\ngames\nand uh\n[Music]\nyeah and then then i just came to a\npoint where like i said like my parents\nare at work all the time\nlike they would like are you gonna go on\nthe bus or like your friend would pick\nyou up for school\nand then one day i just like just\nstopped going and i just\nlike i'm feeling going to school anymore\ni just stopped going to school\nand uh that was like my senior year i\njust like stopped going and then they\nsaid like all right you know you failed\nyou failed you failed high school uh you\nget to like take this year over again\nand then i just\nsaid screw it i just got my ged and then\nstarted doing the community college and\nall that\ndo you remember how you felt in senior\nyear of high school\nuh that was when i was playing world of\nwarcraft and so i was\njust addicted itself like i was\nyou know i just that's all i wanted to\ndo um\nthat's like the only thing that mattered\nme i was like real lost in the sauce\nokay so i i remember like i was dating\nthis girl at the time\nand this is when the game just came out\ni was like hey i'm like the first level\nwhatever hunter\n50 hunter on my server you know and i\ndidn't talk to her or see her for like\ntwo weeks straight i was like so lost in\nthe sauce\nshe's just like oh that's nice like i\nthink we need to break up\ni was like what yeah\nso uh yeah it's just like\ni just became like super lost in the\nsauce um\nand then i let like all my like real\nworld like uh\nlike i had a small group of friends but\nthe friends just became like people that\ni just played the games with you know so\nlike all my real world relationships\nlike suffered like heavily because of it\nyeah so i'm curious during that time\nwhen you were lost in the sauces you put\nit were you\noverwhelmed by thoughts of the future\nand past\nwhen you stepped out of the sauce\noh definitely like i didn't i definitely\nwasn't enjoying school\nand i didn't know like future wise what\ni wanted to do i had like\nyou know like that's like when the time\nwhen people like well i'm gonna go major\nin this and\ngonna become this and that and it's like\ni don't know what the hell i want to do\nyou know\nand obviously i can't have that\nconversation with my parents\nbecause they're just like mia so\nit's just like well i'm just not gonna\ndeal with this i'm gonna go\nbraid blackwing layer yeah so like\nthat's like that's just like basically\nlike what was going on\nso those dragons ain't gonna farm\nthemselves you know what i'm saying\nexactly man yeah exactly\nragnaros isn't gonna isn't gonna\ndown himself you have to do it you gotta\npay the bills on\nazeroth yeah um\nso just kind of thinking about it a\nlittle bit\ni'm wondering uh brandon if like so\nsometimes like you know when we think\nabout\nkid who's not going to class at all\nskipping classes like sure there's a\ncertain amount of world of warcraft\nescapism but\nyou know the word depression pops into\nmy mind when i hear about that situation\nwhat do you think about that word\ni'm gonna say i was sad but it's like\nyou were sad or you weren't sad\ni the only thing that bothered me in\nlike that sense was that\nuh well it's like we talked i talked\nabout earlier like\ni've had a very difficult time with\nempathy so if i did have a real world\nfriendship\nand i didn't understand how to have the\nfriendship in the sense of like\ngetting the value out of it that like\nyou should have from like a real\nfriendship\nlike because i didn't understand like\nthe value behind like the shared\nexperiences\num caring about the other person like\ndeeply you know\nlike their their well-being all that\nkind of stuff and it's like uh\nso because i didn't i didn't have that\num emotional and mental capacity at the\ntime\nit kind of like made those type of\nfriendships like devoid of meaning for\nme\nand that's like i don't want to say i\nwas sad about it but it's like\ni felt like definitely something was\nmissing there you know so you did feel\nlike something was missing\nyes yes and then so like because that\nthing is missing\nuh i would go like play wow and then\nit's like my value becomes like oh\nyou're really good at doing dps in this\nrage so i wanna you know like i wanna\nhave this person around or like\nor like that person's funny you know\nlike that's how i'm creating\nyeah i'm creating value to the people\nlike in that way you know\nso it's it's a silly thing but yeah\ni don't think it's very silly at all\nwell the whole situation is definitely\nsilly\nwhat's silly about the situation uh\nit's just like the way that you can the\nway that i was like talking to another\nfriend about this\nuh recently and it's like he said he\npicked up all these uh\nhobbies and like skill sets because he\nthought\nthat like that's how he would he'd be\nuseful to people like they want him\naround you know\nand it's like uh and he said he says he\nlike still like carries that to this day\nbut it's like it detracts from like his\nreal relationships with people\nbecause it's like in the back of his\nmind it's like oh this person maybe\nwants me because like i'm good at music\nor like\ni can fix this thing and he's like he's\nthat's always something in the back of\nhis mind\nyeah so that's another one of those\nstatements that i think you say to mean\none thing but i'm in hearing a different\ninterpretation\nwhat do you do the acquisition of real\nlife skills makes potentially your\nrelationships based on\nshallowness and what you can bring to\nthe other person well no like that's\nwhat he's telling himself but he\nit's not actually true okay okay yeah\nit's not actually true\nbut like that's how he feels yeah yeah\nand whereas\nin your case i mean i i i don't think\nthat i didn't think that was silly at\nall because in your case\nwhat i'm hearing is a you know kid who\ndoesn't have value in the real world\nand you get to be someone that people\nwant to be around and who care about you\nand want you to show up every day\nbecause like you know when you don't go\nto class for a week\nlike what do the teachers do\nuh i mean when i was did y'all had to\nsleep so they just like left me a lot\nright so like when\nwhen you did not hold up to your\nresponsibilities\nwho cared exactly\nnobody cared and then it in wow\nwhen you miss click and\nyou know i don't know what hunters do\nthat could wipe a raid but\nyou know when you don't pull properly or\nwhatever like\nthey care right like people care\neither in a good way or a bad way but\ni'm hearing that you were like\ni could see that your presence was noted\nin some way\nyes whereas like if when you went to\nschool like you might\ni mean they might as well been robots\nlike for as much as people seem to\nnotice\nor give a [ __ ] yes\ni can definitely see what you're talking\nabout did you act out at all\nuh when i was in middle school in\nelementary school\nlike when the divorce and stuff was\nfirst happening i was like\nvery class clown kind of just always\njust saying random stuff\nand trying to make people laugh like\nthat was like my value that i\nthat's why i like mentioned value before\nis like i i kind of mentally noted that\nas like\nit's like why did i do that it's like\nbecause i'm looking for a way of giving\nvalue to people\nright and like that's the way that like\nthat basically became like the\ninteraction it's like i'd make people\nlaugh\nso it's like that was like my purpose i\ndon't know but then\nyeah it's like once i got into games i'm\nlike sleeping all the time so i can't\neven do that\nyeah but yeah and so what about the ice\nbeside an\ninterview kind of like resonated with\nyou\nit's a class clown thing and then like\nhe was talking about how you like\nasperger's and stuff and like\njust a lot of the is this\ni mean i've like read up on this type of\nstuff before like i i genuinely think\nthat like\nmost professional gamers are have been\nare on the spectrum in some way\nlike in the sense of like the way that\nlike obsessive\nbehavior like and uh and a lot of them\nhave like empathy issues\na lot of them a lot of like them like\nsocial cues\nlike social skills really hard and like\nthis\nall can develop in like some way shape\nor form right so\nit's definitely something i've like i\nlike i've noted of myself and like other\npeople i've interacted with\nlike throughout the years and it's and\nit's like something\ni don't know if it's like learned\nbehavior it's like i missed out on the\nability to learn about this stuff from\nlike previous\npoints in my life or it's because it's\nsomething i was born with\nbut it's definitely like something i've\nhad to like adjust and deal with\num and yeah and that's like\ni guess like the parallels that like\nthat was like pulling from that sure\nyeah so you know my take on that it's\nsomething i think about a lot i've also\nworked with a fair number of pro gamers\num you know my money's actually more on\nthe learned behavior part\nso while it's possible that like you\nknow all the pro gamers out there are on\nthe autism spectrum\nor a fair number of them i i think that\nespecially with\nso the\nconfusion around empathy and building\nsocial\nrelationships that symptom\nhas multiple diagnoses that can lead to\nit\nyes being on the spectrum is one of them\nbut i think that like i know for myself\nlike i\ni don't know i mean i certainly wasn't\nvery empathic as a\nyou know like in high school and stuff\nand i was [ __ ] confused when it came\nto college\nlike i didn't know how to talk to a girl\ni didn't really know how to make friends\nlike my friends in high school like the\nreason i made friends with them is\nbecause none of us knew how to make\nfriends with anyone else\nyeah right that's what i mentioned it's\nlike i don't know if it's like a learn b\nyep it might in both of our instances it\ncould be learned behavior\nit could be something like in my case\ni'm like born with but it could be like\na mixture of both like\nabsolutely so i think that there's\nthere's enough consistency\nand if you look at the statistics around\nlike how common autism is\nor some being on the autism spectrum you\nknow i'd guess that\nthis is a pattern that is so autism is\nin the minority of the population\n[Music]\nplaying video games is now in the\nmajority of population\nand having social difficulties and\ndifficulty with empathy is also\nin the majority of gamers yeah so just\nlooking at that\nat that statistically it makes me lean\ntowards\nthings like um\nso like you know i\nlike let me just share like an a theory\nthat i have for lack of a\nbetter i i'm just gonna toss this out\nhopefully it'll illustrate the point is\nthat okay\nyeah go for it so when we form online\nrelationships\nso like like i guess this is why gamers\nare socially anxious okay\nso when we form online relationships we\ntend to form\nlike there are parts of our brain that\ngovern like empathy\nand like you know understanding social\ncues and things like that\nthat actually like get rusty because\nwhen i\ntalk to you on discord like i don't see\nyour face i don't understand your body\nlanguage\ni get a little bit of tone so i spend a\nlot of time playing video games\nand there's also like a set of\num things in the game\nthat make me know whether i'm valued or\nnot\nright like if i'm crushing mid like i\nknow that people are gonna like me\nright like it's it's it's easy like i\nunderstand\nwhat my value is in this given situation\ni also don't have to deal with like\nfacial expressions and stuff like that\nalso games tend to be like really really\nlogical so what happens is like\nwhen i interact with people online it\nseems to be easier because my brain sort\nof knows how to do that\nand then what happens when gamers go and\nlike they interact with real people\nis like something weird happens so\ngenerally speaking the regular humans\nautomatically\ntheir brain interprets things like body\nlanguage and tone\nand like other kinds of things that\nreassure\nthe regular human the problem with the\ngamer is that all of those circuits have\nbeen like\nturned off for a while so we are not\nable to be reassured\nby like the signals that are like other\nhuman brains are able to be reassured by\nand so what we do in our minds is fill\nit in with logical processing\nso then it becomes a problem to be\nsolved and we're like hyper analyzing\nevery interaction so since the emotional\npart of our brain is not able to like\ninterpret a signal of like you know if\nsomeone\nyou know like invites me like we just\ncan't process all of these like\nempathic signals so instead what we do\nis we become hyper anxious which is like\noverly logical\nreasoning into all of these different\nrandom things\nand the problem is that you know logical\nprocessing is just not a good way to\ninterpret bodily signals\nit's like how you get into all this kind\nof you know weird like\ndating pickup artist like if the girl\ndoes this it means it's like all this\nit's it's a logical construction that's\na substitute\nfor a far better empathic circuit that\nis like\nrusty what do you think about that\ni can agree with that and uh\ni i definitely understand where coming\nfrom and i'll just like\ni'll i guess i'll like exp to talk about\nexperience so yeah i'd love to hear that\nokay so we had uh like one of our teams\nlike counter logic gaming\nyou know we're the or the turbo sweaty\nnerds and uh\nwe ended up going off to korea to like\nplay in this turn\nthis a couple month long tournament so\nwe're all living together\nright and so we're living together for\nmonths\nand it's like these there's like major\nissues of like\nfighting all the time like and that's\nlike why i bring up like the social cue\nthing is it's not just like\nrestricted to like online but it's like\nwhen we are in in in person it's like\nliterally we like can't even like\nprocess each other you know it's like\nwe're just a bunch of like\nmalfunctioning robots\nlike yeah so it's\nit's like i feel like it probably does\ntalk a lot\nabout like what you're saying where it's\nlike our\nwe've been online so long and like we've\nhad those relationship online and we\nknow how to interact online\nnow like once we're in person and\nthere's like the\nthe cues and stuff like the facial\nexpressions the\nbody language all that kind of stuff\nlike that's like out the window right\nand\nyeah and then i remember like at the end\nof the trip like after we got done with\nthe tournament\none of the like the players on the team\nthey're like what we need to do now is\nlike we need to go back and get a gaming\nhouse and live with each other it's like\nno yeah\nso it's like yeah like after all that\nkind of stuff\nso it's just i mean and then i've seen\nit like i've you know coached teams and\nbeen around teens for a long time you\nsee like all these other gamers like\nliving with each other\nand i feel like a lot of them like can't\nprocess like\ndealing with each other in any or like\nany situation\nand it's like i don't know i just like\nseeing it too much you know\nyeah so it's interesting because i i've\nseen a lot of it too it's it's amazing\nhow much\nhow long of a way a little bit of\ninstruction goes\nso there's data that supports so like\nthey did a good\na trial on i think like 12 000 students\nfrom grade 1 to 12 maybe\nwhat what yeah you seem like you're\nthinking something funny\nno i just glanced over a chat and\nsomebody's like nopers\nso so there there's data that shows that\nif you take\ni think they did a trial where they took\n12 000 students and 6 000 of the\nstudents were taught\nsocial and emotional skills training as\na class\nlike in addition to history and\nmathematics and things like that the\ninteresting thing is that if you teach\npeople how to like interact with each\nother\nit's worth one letter grade\nso their gpa actually goes up by\n1.1 points like\nthis is something that would never\nhappen in america right is this class\nthis is a\ntrial that was done in america i think\nit was done in america oh okay okay\nthis doesn't sound like america it\ndoesn't sound like america but it\ni i think the trump show is in america\ni'd have to find the reference again but\ni think it was\ndone here um maybe europe but it's\ninteresting because when i you know when\ni work with esports teams it's like well\nwe'll like spend some time like learning\nhow to communicate and boy does it help\num you know the the sample size is still\nrelatively small but i would love to do\na study that actually the problem is\nthat there's so much variability in\nperformance\nyou know in terms of like tournament\nplacement there are so many factors that\nit's hard to say that this is\nresponsible for an improvement\nbut well a lot of a lot of teams have\nlike mental coaches and\nlike psychologists and a lot of a lot of\npeople that are like do it it's\ndefinitely come a long way since like\nwhen i was\nplaying so it's definitely it's there\npeople know about it so\nyeah and it's it's it's crazy to see\nlike how\nfar a little bit of education goes and\nlike\nprocessing and and teaching people like\nhow to communicate\nand recognize each other's like issues\nhow it really brings a team together\nit's it's been interesting to\nsee that but um\nyeah so it sounds like you were can you\ntell me a little bit about the the navy\nand how you decided to do that\nuh well i was going to community college\nat the time\nall my friends had like moved off to\nlike go to state school\num and so i like didn't have any friends\nat the time like in the area and like\nall they only able to hang out with\nthose like online playing games\nand i was gonna like do the two years\nand then go to like state school like do\nlike transfer program\num and i was just like really cause it\njust felt like\nhigh school to sequel you know where\nit's like i gotta go and i gotta do\nthese stupid classes\nand then i'd like just play games all\nnight and\nit's literally just like i'm just\ncarrying out the same experience except\nthis time i don't have my irl friends\nto like help me deal with it you know so\none day i just like saw a pamphlet\nwhen i was like walking out of class and\nyeah they got me man the brainwashing\nyeah and i just like i was like all\nright i want to change my life\ndramatically i'm like so i just got to\nget out of here right\nand i just told my my mom like i'm going\nto go i signed up for the navy like i'm\ni'm going to leave in a month and i\njust went off the boot camp and had it\nit was definitely\nuh well i mean i wasn't going i wasn't\nlike being in the army of marines i'm\nnot like going off like shoot people\nlike my job was\nyou know i was more the technical side\nso she was like at first she was like\nnow i can explain to her like this is\nwhat i'm going to be doing and she's\nlike okay\nlike just be careful you know like that\nkind of thing\nso um yeah then i went off in the\nmilitary\nwhich is definitely an interesting\nexperience like\nthere's a lot of crazy people in the\nmilitary in like some way shape or form\nuh and it's you definitely experience\nlike people from all walks of life\nand you're like kind of forced into this\nlike jumbled mess together\nand yeah and i got to travel a lot\nwhich is a good experience you know i\ngot to like experience a lot of\ndifferent cultures\nand a lot of life experiences um\nbut it was definitely extremely\nstressful it was probably like\nmost stressful experience of my life\njust what was stressful what was\nstressful about it\nyou have no okay let's say\ni'm like hey you need to go here\ntomorrow or whatever\nit's like you can't say no like you need\nto do this you can't say no\nso like basically no matter what you\nhave to do like whatever's happening or\ngoing on or what's saying\nbut you have no control over your life\ndoes that make sense\num so it's like you're at the whim of\nother people\nand the military doesn't have a lot of\nsmart people\nare there smart people in there there's\na lot of people in the military that\nare just in there in their position\nbecause of time they're like well i've\nbeen in here for a lot of years\nand it's like oh no this guy's in charge\nof me in its way\nyeah like that kind of stuff so wow it's\njust\nyeah it's it's a zoo for sure\num and then it's all the normal stuff\nlike you have to like train for\nlike combat and like yeah\nthe one thing in the navy you get like\ngas chambered\nwhatever you like get you get tear gas\nand\nlike all a bunch of stuff like that like\nand then boot camp is really stressful\num stressful you know it's not a word\nthat i usually hear\nused to describe boot camp like\nmental turmoil like what what what can\nyou help me understand that what was\nwhat's the turmoil in boot camp like\ni've heard it's hard but\nusually when i think like stress i think\nlike paying bills at the end of the\nmonth or\nmaybe i'm going to get kicked out of\ncollege or like i think about stress\nyeah go ahead so when you [ __ ] up they\ndo what's called beating you\nwhere they just like work you out into\nthe ground to where it's like\nliterally the only way that those that\nyou they'll stop you from working out\nis you get carried away in an ambulance\nand then you get charged for the\nambulance\nor something like that yeah that's like\nso like yeah like and it's like i don't\nwant to have that happen it could be\nthey'd like beat you over like random\nstuff like this button isn't button\nthis many centimeters to like this\ndegree\nall right we're going to beat you for\nthree hours it's like no\nit's like some stuff that does sound\nquite traumatic\nyeah yeah yeah yeah so and you can't say\nno\nlike you have to do it or also like\ndischarge you it's just like it's just\nrandom stuff like that and then\nuh i don't know yeah so that's like on\ntop of like the the training you're\ngoing through already\nso yeah so it sounds like no control\nover your life and getting like\narbitrarily punished\nyeah but that sounds like they call it\nlike breaking people down so they can\nbuild them back up it's like all right\nyou broke everyone down like pretty good\nhere yeah\nand did that prepare you yeah go ahead\nyou ever seen the movie full metal\njacket\nuh yeah i think that many many years ago\ni don't really remember\nmuch about it but it's just like\ncollectively like everyone like beating\nit's just like beating people down until\nthey're like\nand some people don't deal with it like\nvery well so yeah that kind of thing\nanyways going on\nno what does that mean some people don't\ndeal with it well what what are they\nwell the guy\nthe guy in the movie ends up committing\nsuicide so like\nthe military has like an enormous like\nthat more people die of suicide in the\nmilitary than\ncombat or anything like that or of\nanything else like the suicide rate is\ninsanely high like i've known like so\nmany people to commit suicide in the\nmilitary\nand like that's something you have to\ndeal with too it's like these guys can't\ndeal with it and they're like\nchecking out like these are people like\nthat are like on my ship with me like\nthey're\nlike how am i like how am i dealing with\nthis you know it's like\noh my god yeah yeah so\nyou're dealing with like statistic is\nactually true that more people in the\nmilitary die of suicide than combat\ni'm pretty sure that's still true like a\nnon and not during non-combat times\nis definitely true so like literally\nevery other week we'd have like some\nsuicide prevention training or some like\ntalk about\nyeah it was just like always like being\ntalked about\nso did it help\nwell in the military it's like you're\nbasically\njust it's like one of those things like\nyou have to go to this class like it's\njust another thing you have to do\nyou know what i mean and and the people\nthat are instructing it\nare like it's like i said the people\nthat are in charge of you are\nprobably not the smartest people or like\nemotionally developed people\nso you have like bubba gump senior\nlpo whatever like all right guys now you\nthink about\nkilling yourself no all right you know\nwe're gonna sit in this class for an\nhour now like\nit's like yeah it's just like people\npeople that are not qualified to be\ntalking about this stuff like trying to\nhelp you deal with this stuff you know\nyou know it's it's funny i'm noticing an\ninteresting connection so\non wednesday we actually had the mods\nfrom live stream fails\nyeah kind of talking about reddit's\nlike mental health support dm\nbot oh god that's pretty much yeah that\nwas that was what was going on\nso i'm hearing like this theme like i\ndidn't think that you know there'd be\nanything relating to your interview in\nin their interview that would be\nconnected and the thing that connects it\nis like\nit seems like there are a lot of\norganizations out there that check a box\nin terms of oh this is a problem let's\ndo something\nlet's do something that allows us to say\nthat we're doing something about the\nproblem\nexactly that's pretty much what's going\ndown and instead of doing\nsomething yeah it's like did you fill\nout the pamphlet\nthat detect that i didn't it's like you\ndon't want to kill yourself it's like\nall right nice\nwork here is done yes\nlike yeah it's interesting i worked at a\nprison\nthat had a very interesting approach to\nsuicide prevention\nthey punished people for being suicidal\nso\nif you kind of get evaluated and you're\nsuicidal\nthey essentially put you in solitary\nconfinement\nwith like paper clothing they give you\nlike a paper gown so you can't like hang\nyourself\nthere's no [ __ ] way you can hang\nyourself because there's one person\nwatching like six cells\nand and so they just like stick people\nin there and then they get like\nperiodically evaluated\nand as long as they were better\nafterwards right they got yeah yep\nyep and i was the one doing the\nevaluations so\nit was like are you are you not suicidal\nor do you want to stay another day by\nyourself with no tv\nnothing to do 24 hours of solitary\nconfinement for your own safety\nand it was it was terrifying but also\neye-opening this is america\nyeah i i i don't even know how much i\nlike\nas much as we bash america like things\nare actually\npretty good here compared to most places\nin the world\ni'll agree i agree but we still got some\nweird problems\nyeah um yeah so brandon how you feeling\nabout this conversation because i'm kind\nof noticing like i'm\nreally enjoying hearing like your\nexperiences and stuff but\ni i just want to check in with you about\nyou know whether this is a good use of\nour time or you wanted to talk about\nsomething else or\ni feel good and i mean my main purpose\non coming onto the show is like\nobviously i wanted to talk about some of\nmy things and\ni've never done therapy before or\nanything like that like in the\ntraditional sense\num so like and i know this isn't like\ntherapy but it's like talking to\nsomebody that does therapy\nand it's like i feel like i've been\ni've been through a lot of stuff and\ni've like messed my life up in a lot of\nways\nand i learned from it and i hope to like\nshare that with people and like help\nother people in that sense\nyeah that's really awesome not that you\nmessed your life up but that you're\ntrying to\nthat's the last thing right and\nout of curiosity anything keep you from\ndoing therapy or\ntrying it or uh\nno i just uh i like\ntinkering with the cogs myself i guess i\ndon't know\nand i've done it in like a bunch of\ndifferent ways like\nobviously like the ways we're talking\nabout earlier like psychedelics and\nuh that kind of stuff too and it should\ni feel like that\nthat has that actually helped me a lot\nlike so\nit's like that's working for me so it's\nlike i'm just gonna keep going with that\nand like i'm gonna mentally i feel like\ni'm in a good place right now\nsure yeah\nand um so did you want to talk about\nlike focus\nor or like you know how your mind works\nyeah well i mean the the focus thing\nkind of like goes with the\ni guess like when i first started uh\nbeing a pro gamer\nlike i could get in this like hyper\nfocused state right\nand like i'd be like dialed in\nand then i think like over the years\nit's like i was like drinking and like\nsmoking and all that kind of stuff it's\nlike\ni would like have like a blip like my\nbrain would like randomly like lag\nlike a computer you know i would like\nand i would just i would jump out of\nthat hyper focus state\nand it'd be like in a game and i just\nlike randomly run it down you know i\njust like\ndie in the game just and it could be\nlike anything and then i find him\nand then eventually i found like myself\nhaving like those moments in like real\nlife where it's like\ni'd be focused in on something and then\nit's like my brain lags\nand it's like it just i don't know it's\nlike when your computer lies or like you\nget like pink spike\nit's like almost that same experience so\nyeah i'm not sure really it's just\nand i i don't know and obviously i've\nlike read about it and like talked about\nor\ntalked to people about us like and it's\nalways like because like you need to\npractice mindfulness or like\num like be in the moment more to like\nyeah it's because it's like that lag is\nlike your brain trying to get it\nsomething else like subconsciously right\nor like moving into like another\nis it i don't know well i think i think\nit is it's like\nit could be like something random like\nuh\nlike i'm focused in on the game or like\nthis conversation i have somebody and\nthen my brain\ncould like random subconsciously try to\ngo off into something\nof like the past or the future or like\nsomething that's like\nin the back of my mind you know like i'm\ni could be worried about or\nanything like at least that's my\nunderstanding like what's going on\nit's just in terms of what breaks your\nhyper-focused state\nyeah it's well i know it's like hard for\nme to focus anymore like that\nbut it's it's like yeah it's like\nsomething is put like snapping me out of\nit you know like right\ni like lose that focus and i can't\nand i feel like it's like been\ndeteriorating over time you know\nthat's how you know like well it's\nnot in like uh well you know like people\nsay that\nuh dis gamers 22 he's passed his prime\nfor being a pro gamer you know like that\nkind of thing\ni think that it's not that um\nyou know they're like your fingers don't\nwork anymore all that kind of stuff and\nlike as a player ages\ni don't think it has anything to do with\nthat it's more like i think\nall like high level gamers i can like\nreach that focus state right\nand i think a lot of that has to do with\nin their earlier age like their number\none main priority like the things\nthey're thinking about and all they care\nabout is like that game right\nand it's like as you go through life\nmore\nthings like you start to care about more\nthings than the game\nlike the other things start like to come\ninto the picture right\nand i think that it's your brain like\nsubconsciously\nlike thinking about those other things\nthat like pulls you out of that state\nand i feel like that's why like a lot of\npro gamers like get bad\nor get worse as as they get older it has\nnothing to do with like\nhands or like ability or anything like\nthat it's that\nit's that focus level and like i i see\nyou know a lot of people\num that are like older and insane but\nit's like i see that\nsame i see what they it's not that same\nfocus level\nyou know they can still like dial it in\nlike that's why they're like able to\nlike keep doing it\ninteresting can i just think about that\nfor a second\nyeah go for it\nso you're saying that as the scope of\nyour life expands\nyour mind is less able to focus on video\ngames\nbecause it's not like monolithic it's\nnot one-dimensional\nso your mind has others\nand i don't think that's the same for\neverybody but i feel like that's what\nstarted happening to me\nand i've seen definitely seen it happen\nlike with a lot of like other\nlike people in the scene that ended up\nretiring or like falling off\nit's like their brain is like pulling\nthem away\nlike they could be worried about like\nschool or\nnot that's cool like job kind of stuff\nor like relationship\nor you know any of the normal like life\nstuff and it's like those things instead\nof just\nbefore they were like way like in the\nback it's like\nand then the game is like way up here\nlike as far as like value and meaning\nand it's and then they eventually start\nto come up so\ni mean we do have a good understanding\nof like how to attain that hyper-focused\nstate from like a\nneuroscience and and level like\num it'd be really interesting to look\ninto the mechanisms of why\nprofessional gamers are young um i think\nleague of legends and\nand dota uh are\ngood examples dota especially is like a\ngood example of like\nthe top tier teams all like tend to have\nlike old captains like way older than\nmost esports\ndota i i don't know too much about like\nwhat would you say is the average\nlifespan of a league of legends player\nlike a professional no like three to\nfour year stops\nand maybe like five to six they're like\nsuper elite\nyeah so i think dota feels longer than\nthat\nso if you look at some top i mean the\naverage may actually be closer to like\ntwo to four years but\nthere are a lot of like professional\ndota players that have been playing some\nform of moba competitively for like\nyeah well that also has to do with\nplayer population so like as the game\nhas like a larger\nplayer population there's more people\nthat can come and buy for that spot\nyeah interesting it becomes like far\nmore competitive so like you know\ni'm sure like you're aware of like\neverybody prefers like\nuh western games gaming to like eat you\nknow\nkorea try and all that and you look at\ntheir rank populations\nthey're like far they're you know two to\nthree like wait even like more\nmore than that like times the population\nso as there's like a larger population\nto like buy for your spot\nlike the bar gets raised like you know\nit keeps getting raised\nand dota dota has like i think it's like\nthe same like community still playing\nthe game yeah like obviously there's\nlike some\nnew players that trickle in but it's\nlike that new player has to\nfight against like multiple years of\nexperience to like\nbreak in right and dota is a very\ncomplex game too\nso it's like you have to learn all that\ncumulative knowledge\nand then you also have to like catch up\nand then progress like beyond that\nperson right\nyeah so and the same can be set for like\ntraditional sports too\nso so yeah so i mean and i'm i'm hearing\nyou say that like\nyou think that a lot of your hyper focus\nhas gotten\nharder as you've started to care about\nother things\nyes definitely i i definitely can't hang\nin like league or any of those games\nanymore\nand what keeps you from hanging the\ninability to gain hyper\nfocus yeah like being that like\nbefore i could like dial myself in i\ncould\ni could play for like 20 hours straight\nlike in\ni would be like in i'd be like in the\nzone the whole time\nyou know and uh i talked to like some\nother doctors about this like for some\nlike summit like a while ago\nand they were talking kind of like about\nthe difference you know like a\ntraditional sport\ni can't click a button at two o'clock in\nthe morning and get into a game of like\nnfl football you know all the other\nplayers right\nbut a game like a video game i can click\na button at two o'clock in the morning\nand i can be at people end of like a\nfull-fledged game with people relative\nto my skill\nand like any time i want right so\nyou have limitless amount of like\ntraining time and the only thing holding\nyou back\nis your ability to be focused in that\ntraining time\nso that's like that's what your com\nthat's what you're\nfighting against and there's people that\nwill like keep pushing that boundary\nlike keep pushing it\nyeah so that that's where i totally i've\ngotten that as well i\nso i trained at a place that had this\nyou know the\nthe sports psychologists and\npsychiatrists for\nthe new england patriots and the boston\nred sox\nso it was interesting to it was a good\nprofessional opportunity to be able to\nwork with those folks and\nand talk to them about what their\nexperience of working with these like\nyou know top tier sports organizations\nare\ndefinitely there you know one of the\ninteresting things that came up was this\nidea that like you can\nonly practice football for like\nfour hours a day yeah there's physical\nyeah there's like a physical limitation\nthat there's clearly a diminishing\nreturn\nafter like four hours of practice a day\nlet's say\nand and so you know sports organizations\nwill do all kinds of things like hot\ntubs and\nand these magnetic machines and massages\nand stuff like that\nto try to get their players to like\npractice for four and a half hours right\nbecause if you can like heal the body a\nlittle bit faster it gives you power up\nyes and but in esports like i still\nremember\none of my earliest engagements which i\nguess is still under nda\nis with a particular sport that i was\nactually working for the company that\nruns the sp that owns the game and and\ntalking to their\num so they had like an event where\na lot of their all their teams were\nbasically there\nand so i was there and talking to the\ncoaches and it was interesting to hear\nthat they were saying like yeah like you\nknow we can\nthere's no physical limitation to the to\nhow much you play\nnow the interesting thing that we kind\nof got into was\nwhether eight hours of playing pubs or\n12 hours of playing pubs\ni like whether those extra four hours of\nplaying pubs\nactually does anything to improve your\nskill just goes back to focus\nlike if it's focus practice it'll do\nsomething but\nlike that's something that's the when\nyou notice like a true super elite\ngame like person in gaming it's the\nfocus thing every time\nlike you're like bjergsen you had him on\nthe show right like he is like\nfocused all the time when he's playing\nlike\nit's like there's a difference between\njust i'm gonna queue up 20 hours in a\nrow and just like\nautopilot and like that's what a lot of\npeople do right that's the difference\nbetween like the real elite\nand the and it's being able to reach\nthat\nand it it's like i felt it's like\nthere's a point where i could reach that\nbefore\ni just can't do it anymore and it's like\ni felt it just slipped away from me\nand it's like yeah\nhow do you feel about that uh\nit was definitely difficult to deal with\nat the time because it's like i was\nreally good at\nand this is like on top of all the stuff\nwe talked about before it's like my\nvalue was that i was really good at this\ngame right\nand then i was in the i got thrown into\nlike the limelight and all that and\nuh you know i i was like streaming like\ni was like\npeople like light you know liked me and\nall that um same thing like any of these\nother like streamers deal with\nand it's like then i feel my ability\nlike slipping right\ni'm like my ability to be focused and\nit's like i feel like my value is\nslipping\nyou know and like this is before like i\nhad built like all\nlike the deal with like the empathy all\nthat kind of stuff so it's like\nit was definitely very tough for me to\ndeal with at the time how did you deal\nwith it\nnot very well do you remember what\nwhat kind of thoughts you would have in\nyour head\ni was just like very unstable like both\nemotionally and like\nmentally so like the stress is also\nkicking in too right you have like the\nstress on top of like\nnot knowing what cause like you're like\nall in like if you\nif you're gonna be like a pro gamer\nyou're all in right you have to you\ncommit to it fully\nso it's like i'm dealing with the stress\nfrom that where it's like\n[ __ ] do i i'm gonna go back to school\nlike what am i gonna do like all the you\nknow that kind of stuff and then it's\nlike\nalso you've alienated a lot of like your\nrelationships that you've had like both\nlike friendship\nsignificant otherwise to like put this\ngame as a priority right\nand so it's like the thing that you put\nis like your priority is like slipping\nlike you're you're like not able to like\ndo it\nyou know so it's like very tough to like\ncome to terms with\nso yeah do you remember what kind of\nthoughts you would have\num just stress like more so like well\nlike what am i going to do like how can\ni fix this\nuh that's why i started reading about\nlike you know\nsports performance psychology all that\nthat's like when i started getting to\nthat like philosophy\nit's like i'm gonna do like anything i\ncan to like try to like get this state\nback but it's like\nlike nothing i could do like a give me\nback and i think it's just because i\nlike lost\nthat like obsession with the game you\nknow and instead of doing it\nbecause i like really really enjoyed it\ni was doing it just because like\nthis is my habit i'm like playing this\ngame because like this is and it's the\nsame as like anything i did like\ndrinking smoking\nall it's like i'm doing this and trying\nto keep doing this\nbecause like this is what i do you know\nyeah i'm also hearing\nso i think what also shatters the focus\nas he used to do it\nout of potentially passion for the game\nyeah i love the game\nand and what i'm hearing is that you\nstarted doing it\nto hold on as opposed to love for the\ngame exactly\nit's a job it becomes a joke i mean it\ncomes to draw for everybody like that\ngets into pro\nwell i think i think it's the attachment\nto like holding on that i think actually\nnegatively impacts the focus and may\ncreate a vicious cycle\nthat the longer the the more you try to\nhold on the harder it becomes to like\nenter the flow state of mind of like\nhyper focus\nbecause you're trying to like grab\nsomething from the past\nand as we started off with you know\nbeing in the present\nis better i think and when you're hyper\nfocused i'd assume that you'd call that\na present focused state like you're in\nthe present\nat that time yeah\nflow state yeah that's like an\ninteresting thing to read about too it's\nlike\neverybody's like trying to reach the\nflow state yeah so i i think that's that\nalso is where like\nyou know it's interesting you were\nsaying that there are the more things\nthat you care about\nor the wider the scope of your your life\nthe harder it is to get into the state\nof hyper focus so it's been my\nexperience that\nsometimes when i work with a team\nthere's like\nemotional bad blood that needs to be\nworked through\nand like occupies like your subconscious\nram\nand like the more that your subconscious\nram it's like all this\nlike all these process old processes\nfrom tournaments long past that are just\nlike minimized\ninto this tray and that as you work\nthrough that stuff and you start closing\ndown those processes you kind of\napologize forgive or even own that i\nwill never forgive you for this\ninterestingly enough they start to play\nbetter the focus starts to return\nyeah and you don't necessarily have to\nhave a happy ending but you do\nhave to do some amount of emotional\nprocessing and like close all that\ncrap that you've got minimized\nyeah and when i played there was like no\ncoaches\nthere was like nobody supporting you in\nthat stuff so it's like\nit's like well go deal with yourself\nthis is definitely tough yeah go deal\nwith it yourself sounds like the story\nof your life brandon\nfun times that's really good though\nyeah no it's it's interesting right\nbecause that's like\nyou know i'm hearing that that's what\nhappened growing up i'm hearing that's\nwhat happened in the military i'm\nhearing\nyou know that's what happened when you\nwere a professional wall player\nand i'm hearing that maybe the reason\nyou're happy is because you're not\ndealing with it with\nyourself anymore uh\nwell no i'm silly yeah like uh\noh i'm happy because i'm not dealing\nwith myself yeah yeah yeah sharing\nexperiences like yeah\nyeah yeah yeah yeah i mean we haven't\nreally talked about what that means but\ni've noticed use the phrase sharing\nexperiences many times\nand what i'm doing is like make i'm\nequating those two things that there's\nthere's brandon that\ndid it himself and had to do it himself\nwhich i think it's reasonable for you to\nhave some degree of\nsadness towards regret about\nfeels bad man sad yeah\nyou know and then there's brandon who\nnow\nis is it solo queuing anymore not so\nlike you anymore we're in the flex queue\nwhat does flex q mean uh it's this like\npretty much just like you could team up\nwith your friends and like me\nyeah yeah\nany questions for me right\nno i'm good i'm fine i think i talked\nabout a lot of stuff i want to talk\nabout i mean there's like a bunch of\nstuff i could go into but\nquite a long time so it's fine yeah i\nmean i i sort of try to\nyou know we usually do this for about\ntwo hours at a stretch like somewhere\naround there\num no this is good yeah i appreciate it\nuh\nand you know if you have questions or\nthings that you want to talk about we\nstill have time it's just\nyou know i want to be call attention you\nknow just be aware of like\nwhat this you know how how long is this\ngame of law going to last\nyeah yeah um hmm\nlet's talk about i mean i i still feel\nlike a lot of these things like carry\nover into like my\nlike i say i'm good now but like it's\nnot a lot of these things like carry\nover and it's like still\nthings like i'm like constantly\ntinkering with and like like what\nuh just like relationships with people\nor like\nuh like like\nlike friendships like it's still like\nbecause of like my past experiences the\nconcept of like what a friendship is is\nstill like even to this day something\ni'm like figuring\nout you know what i mean and i'm like\ni'm a grown man you know and it's like\ni'm still figuring that out to this day\nyou know can you give me an example of\nwhat you're what you're figuring out or\na situation in which it's clear that you\nhaven't figured everything out yet\n[Music]\nah how to explain it it's like i feel\nlike\nuh i feel like uh\neven my close friendships are like at an\narm's length\nyou know i'm not ex it's really\nexplained\nthat it's like uh i think it's more\nlike to do with like how people are in\nlike\nmodern times like i don't say modern\ntimes but like\nuh i'm\ni'm really having a hard time like it's\nyep so i feel like\nbrandon here's the here's the problem\ni think you're trying to piece it\ntogether so you're speaking in\nabstractions\nand my instinct is that if you want to\nunderstand this better\nstop speaking in abstractions because\nyeah i'm trying to find like an exact\nlike instance it's more so like i feel\nlike my friendship should be closer than\nthey are\nokay good that's a good statement well\nlike with the amount of effort i put in\nbut i don't think i don't actually don't\nput that much effort in actually i'm\nlazy\nyeah so it's like i i would like to have\nlike closer friendships with people but\ni feel like it's like\ni'm so used to being by myself you know\nthat it's like difficult for me to\nto match like people's effort and uh\nyeah you know so we're gonna we're gonna\ntry to speed run this okay\nokay so i think there's a lot of value\nhere i think it's really important to\ntalk about i don't want to leave the\nconversation without giving it a shot\nokay go for it all right so the first\nthing is\nso you feel like your relationships are\ncloser than they should\nshould be closer than they are that even\nthe people you consider close friends\nyou kind of keep at arm's length yes\nso when i say that to you i'm seeing\nemotion in your face\nyes yes okay so\nwhat what am i saying that's triggering\nsomething in you\num what's up basically uh i'll just like\nsummarize that community\nbasically i'm so used to being alone in\nmy life and like on my own doing my own\nthing\nlike figuring out my own [ __ ] that even\nwhen i do have people in my life\nthat like want to share experiences\ni can't even like process it you know\nbecause i'm like\nthis doesn't make sense like in my mind\nit's like\ni'm too used to being on my own you know\num\nso like i can't like i can't like\nprocess like that friendship\nwhat does that mean you can't process\nthat friendship\nit's like there could be a moment where\ni'm supposed to be close to that person\nand i still like i feel like it's like\nalien you know it's like i shouldn't\nit's like i feel like i shouldn't be\nfeeling this\nyou know what should you be feeling or\nwhat are you feeling that you shouldn't\nbe feeling\nor it's like i feel like i should be\ncloser with them\nlike in those moments you know i feel\nlike i should be feeling closer\nbut it's like i'm so used to being alone\nlike feeling alone\nand like dealing with [ __ ] on my own\nthat\ni don't know how to like mentally\nand like emotionally like go through\nthat with that person to like connect\nthat moment\nyou know it's like uh\ni didn't read the i didn't read like\nfriendships for dummies you know\nso i read that book i'm hearing that you\ndon't know how to be a friend\nyes i feel like i don't\ni see like other people's friendships\nand it's like i feel like\nwhat's like oh i should i should like i\nfeel like like the way they spend time\ntogether all day like\ni have a good friend group like don't\nget me wrong i have a lot of friends\nbut it's like i don't feel like that\nit's\nat i don't feel like our interactions\nare like at\nuh it's like not a like i don't feel\nlike the closeness is there like as it\nshould be you know and i think it's like\nmy fault\nyou know okay\nwhat makes you think it's your fault or\nwhat's your fault in this\nbecause um\ni'm like my brain is like off in its own\nworld all the time\nor like uh the social cue thing\nare like i'm here still different you\nfeel difficult\nyeah i feel deficient because just\nbecause it's like\nfirst 25 years of my life i'm like not\ndoing this right\nso i want you to brandon you yes\nlearn how to stop doing this thing\nsometimes i'll ask you a question\nand you'll give me an answer and then\nyou'll give me an explanation\nokay okay okay what we need is if you\nwant to make\nprogress here forget about everything\nafter the word because\nokay do you understand what i'm saying\nyes right so like when you feel a\nparticular way like if i ask you\ndo you feel deficient what does your\nmind do\ntries to explain my mind tries to\nexplain why i'm deficient\nyeah like i try to come up with a\nlogical reasoning of it yep\nright but that sort of doesn't\nit's not that it doesn't matter it's\njust that i don't think that that's\nwhere\nthe work you need to do is yes\nso i know this sounds kind of weird but\nlike\nwhat is it like\nwhy do you think that your mind does\nthat\nthe explaining yeah i mean that's just\nwho i am as a person like when i'm\nplaying a game i'm like trying to\nlogically figure it out right\nyep or like do anything i'm like trying\nto logically figure it out to come to a\nconclusion\nlike i'm trying to beat the game yep and\nthese these friendships are a game\nalmost in the way it's like i'm trying\nto beat the game of friendships\nyep very well said it's who you are and\nthat's what needs to change\nbecause you've been trying to beat the\ngame of friendships for a while so i\nthink we got to teach you a different\nway\ncan i think for a second go for it\ni'm glad you mentioned this by the way\nwhat should your relationships be like\nuh\ni feel like uh hmm\ni see like some friends have like\nthey're like literally like life\npartners\nlike they want to experience life\ntogether you know like that's the best\nway to have life right\nis you're just sharing life experiences\nall the time right\nin like a positive way negative way it\ndoesn't matter\nand i feel like i miss out on a lot of\nthose experiences\nhow long have you felt lonely brandon uh\ni don't wanna say\nokay i don't wanna use the word lonely\ncause like that's not the right\nway to describe it but it's like\ni think the deficiency is like the right\nway to say it it's like i feel like\ni'm at like a six or a five and like i\nwant to be at like a nine or ten\nyou know what i mean and\nwhat made you a five or six instead of a\nnine or a ten\num i feel like i'm playing ketchup\nyou know it's like you know when we\ntalked about the cumulative knowledge\nthing with like the games\nit's like i feel like i'm playing\ncatch-up in like the\nhuman interaction thing why did i play\ncatch-up in the first place\nbecause i\ndidn't have those experiences when i\njust put myself on the computer and\npretty much like isolated myself for\nlike the first 20 years of my life\nwhose fault is it that you're playing\ncatch up\nwell i mean my own of course like i'm\nthe one who decided to do\nthat like i could like deflect and like\nput them like oh my parents are like\nyou know this it it always comes back to\nyourself like you're the ultimate\nperson responsible for yourself and like\nyour life like\nso it's like i understand like what i\ndid and it's like\nnow we go back to like the mindset of i\nneed to beat the game so like i'm trying\nto figure out\nmentally how to like\nyou know tinker with my brain all the\nstuff you talk about inner monologue all\nthat kind of junk\nto like have better experiences with\npeople and like\ncreate better experiences for them you\nknow\nokay i think for a second go for it\n[Music]\nyou know blaming yourself you got some\nsnot by the way yeah sorry yeah it's all\ngood i'm just\nyou know uh i'm gonna get it now kid\nall right i'm back welcome back brendan\nyeah so i'm gonna say something kind of\nweird okay so i think you're good at\nfiguring things out\nokay and so if you're stuck somewhere\ni think that it's not a problem of like\nnot being able to solve the problem i\nthink you're trying to solve the wrong\nproblem it's a problem of misdiagnosis\nand one of the hardest things to do\nif you blame yourself and you try to fix\nthings one of the saddest things that i\nroutinely see is when people blame\nthemselves for something that's not\nactually their fault so\nthey're never able to fix it because the\nfault doesn't lie with you\nand as long as you own the faults of\nother people\nlike that's not something that can ever\nbe fixed\ndoes that make sense yeah it makes sense\ni understand what you're trying to say\nso i i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike the idea that you were\ndeficient the idea that it's all your\nfault on the one hand is helpful\nis adaptive right because if everything\nis your fault\nyou have it within your your power to\nfix it\nyes and and so there's something\nactually bizarrely comforting\nabout beating yourself up because then\nlike and i\nhonestly i see this in cases of like\nabuse and neglect where like\npeople learn to think it's their fault\nand i know it sounds kind of weird but\nwhy does that happen so much it's\nbecause\nactually the alternative is like way\nharder\nlike like dealing with a world where\nyou're in the situation that you're in\nbecause you didn't not because of\nsomething that you did wrong but\nbecause other people did something wrong\nis like a terrifying world to live in\nthere's so much uncertainty because if\nyou're not to blame then can you ever\nfix it like i don't know\nlike taking away power from yourself in\nthat situation absolutely\nand and this is the kind of thing where\ni would be really careful\nbecause i mean like sure you played a\nbunch of video games but like\nand and i know that like we sort of talk\nabout like holding on to resentment\nis a bad thing but i think that you're\ndoing something really really bizarre\nwhich is if you accept if you're not if\nyou accept more blame than what you're\nresponsible for\nyou're in a like an unsolvable situation\nokay that makes sense right so i get\nthat you\nfeel deficient but i think you've got to\nbe careful about\nthe logical plan of action that you\nbuild\nrooted in an emotion that you are not\ngood enough\nthat you are deficient in some way\nbecause like all of that thinking starts\nfrom like that\nemotional core\nand i think the reason that you've made\nprogress and i'm sure you'll continue to\nmake progress i think you'll make\nprogress\nfaster if you understand like\nlike the reason you feel deficient\nnow we're speed running so you know you\nknow i may recommend a couple of other\nthings to you\nat the top of the list is we're\nreleasing a guide on mental health which\ni think there are one or two videos that\nyou should definitely watch\nbecause your textbook um\nbut but it's kind of interesting because\nlike if you think about how long have\nyou felt deficient\ni mean my whole life obviously like it's\nyeah right all right yeah\nso if you think about it that's\nsomething that you carry with you\nright it shapes like all of the way that\nyou look at the world\nand if you want to form like healthy\nrelationships\nlike it's going to be really hard if you\ndon't believe that you're someone that's\nform\nworth forming a healthy relationship\nwith\nlike what keeps your friends at arm's\nlength\nbecause you keep on saying i'm used to\nbeing on my own like yeah i get you're\nused to it but it's not what you want\ni feel like part of me does want to be\non my own though you're right\nwhy it's like comforting because it's\nthe normality\nnot just the normality it's like my\nroutine\nso i think there's value to routine but\nwhat would it be like\nto not keep people at arm's length\nwhat do you gain by keeping them at\narm's length\njust the same thing so save the same\nroutine same\nsame thing don't get anything i think\nyou gain more than that\nso i want you to think about a time\nwhere you could get closer to someone\nokay and you don't\nwhy not um\ni feel like we don't share the same\nlike uh i don't feel like the\nfeeling is shared so it's like i\ni pull back you know\nyeah so\nlet's think about that for a second\nwhy do you have to pull back if the\nfeeling isn't shared\nwouldn't you like some other people i\ndon't know have you smothered people\nbefore\ni've definitely experienced people\nsmothering me so it's like i don't want\nthem to experience that\nas well you know when like somebody's\nlike\ntoo pushy about like being in your life\nor like\nyou know what i mean yeah and it's like\ni just want to be on my own\nor to do my own thing so you want to i\ndon't i don't\ni don't want to put that burden on other\npeople yeah i'm going to use like uh\ni'm going to use exaggerated terms okay\nbecause we're speed running\nokay so you don't want to you're it\nalmost sounds like you're protecting\nthem from yourself\nyeah because it's like it's like it's\nlike the\ni'm trying to i guess i'm just gonna say\nit's like i'm logically trying to like\nah it's like i don't want yeah i'm yeah\ni'm protecting it for myself because i\ni don't like that experience sometimes\nright it's like i don't want them to\nhave that experience\nyou know and what exactly are you\nprotecting them from\ni don't want to like push myself into\nlife too much you know\nor like i don't want to be like the\nlittle eager kid with like a oh this is\nlike a little like a butterfly and then\nswish it you know what i mean\nyeah yeah and so how do you\nhow do you view yourself in that\ninteraction like what\nwhat are you what are you insulating\nthem from\ni just want to give them their space\nlike it's like\nuh i didn't ask them i didn't ask what\nyou want to do for them i'm asking what\nare you\nwhat am i i'm just somebody that\ni feel like i'm an intense person like\nwhen i\njust because of a lot of my experiences\nthroughout my life and\nand i know i shouldn't be like just\nbecause i know we talked about that but\ngood yeah it's but it's like that's\nor it can be an intense person and it's\nlike i want\nto i'm like trying to pull back from\nthat intensity you know\ni understand i can be an intense person\nokay\nwhat do you mean by intense person\nwell it's because like before i didn't\nfeel any of these things\nand it's like once i open the floodgate\nit's like\ni feel these things like i mean i'm\nfreaking crying on streams and stuff\nright you know\nlike once i do feel something or like\nsomething does happen\ni feel like it's like magnified tenfold\nso it's like it's very difficult for me\nto\nuh i don't want to say control it but\nit's like\nit can it can be overwhelming yeah\nabsolutely\nand what's wrong with you being\noverwhelmed when you're with someone\nelse i don't want them to be overwhelmed\nby\nthis experience that like i can't even\ncontrol myself because like i'm not in\ncontrol of myself in that situation\nyep so it's like i don't want to like\nboil that over onto them you know\nexpose them to your nastiness yeah\nthey don't they don't deserve to deal\nwith this\noverwhelming bundle of emotions that is\nyou\nthis busted kid who never learned how to\nmake friends and you don't want to show\nthat to them and\nwhy should they have to deal with\nsomeone who you know is such a\ndeficient human being yes\npretty much there you go you got it yep\nso i'm gonna say something weird brandon\nyou're an arrogant prick yeah i've been\ntold that\nyeah so here's the thing it's not your\nplace to control\ntheir reactions you're taking the\ndecision away from them\nthat makes you arrogant and controlling\nokay\nright so like what you need to do is\nlike because like it's interesting right\nbecause you're really controlling this\ninteraction\nyou're not giving them the choice to\naccept you or reject you\nyou're making that choice for them and\nas long as you make that choice for\nthem they're going to be at arm's length\nyes\nso like the reason like they're at arm's\nlength because you're\nkeeping them there if they get so this\nis where i'd like venture like there are\ntimes where it's not just about you\ngetting close to them\nsometimes they come close to you and i\nthink you push them away\nyes that does happen so i know it's\ngoing to be terrifying\nbut i would let someone\nlet him have it let them have it\nright give them the chance to be a\nfriend\nbecause right now you're controlling it\nyou're not giving them the chance mm-hmm\nit's like you can't have a friendship\nthat is like where one person has all\nthe power okay\nwhat do you think about that\ni can agree with it um\ni don't want to give you a just because\nbut like also something that\ngoes into my mind with that is like\nthe scene we're in is like i don't want\nto say very superficial but it's like\ni feel like there are there are a lot of\nsuperficial like relationships with\npeople\nand like yep because\nand there's a lot of friendships that\nget created in this scene as well\nlike i it's just\ni don't know it's very hard to tell like\ngenuine interactions you know\nyeah so that that you know that's\nsomething that\ni think you should you should be very\ncareful about because\nwhen it comes to like the streaming\nworld\nfriendship becomes a business yes\nand i don't want it to become bad so\nthat that i can i can\nyou know i i can not only meet you\nhalfway i can meet you all the way\ni'll come all the way over to your\nconcern there\nbut i i really do think brandon that\nlike if you want to feel connected to\nsomeone\nyou know like like you see like it feels\nto me like there's ugliness inside you\nthat\nyou don't want to burden other people\nwith\nbut as long as like you're not willing\nto let them see who you are\nlike you're nev you're always going to\nfeel\nthat degree of distance and the whole\npoint i mean here you are crying in\nfront of thousands of people like\nwhat what would you think i mean i know\nthis stream is a little bit of a\ndifferent place but like\nwhen your mind considers situations like\nthis like what is it afraid of\ni mean i'm not afraid to show my emotion\nthat\ni'm never i'm never afraid of that like\ni don't care okay okay like i don't\nfeel any insecurity with it it's more so\nlike\ni just uh i guess\nmaybe i am afraid of like the\ndisingenuous\nuh i see a lot of like disingenuous\noh i got a good way explaining it all my\nprevious friendships from before were\nfriendships that i was like it's like\nso let's say i'm on a team with somebody\nright it's like we're living together\ni'm on a team\nwe're friends why are we friends because\nwe're just here living together it's\nbecause of circumstance you know\nor like i'm in the military it's like\nwe're here we're stuck with each other\nnow we're friends\ni'm friends because i'm stuck there with\nthat person right and it's like\ni almost have like that same mindset\nit's like now i'm not stuck with people\nright so it's like i've it's hard for me\nto tell like what a genuine\nnon like i'm stuck here with you\nfriendship is or\nsure yeah maybe that's maybe that's it i\ndon't know that's explained so well but\nyeah it's like very difficult for me to\nlike i'm afraid of that like that\ni'm stuck with you friendship i don't\nwant to have that you know\nand it's like now i'm not stuck with\nanybody i'm like trying to like\ncultivate like real friendships and\nrelationships\nand it's like it's just a very different\nexperience so\nand it's i'm not trying to navigate that\nyeah so i think there's a lot of\npractical stuff there\nand there's potentially a date like a\ndangerous isn't the right word there's\nlike an interesting undercurrent there\nso when i envision someone who views\nthemselves as deficient\nand they have friends due to\ncircumstances\ni could imagine like that blending\ntogether\nto where like the only reason these\npeople are my friends\nis because we're all stuck on a boat\ntogether the\nonly reason that these people are my\nfriends is because they're my teammates\nbecause do you see how like the\ncircumstance plus your deficiency\ncould create like a hybrid kind of thing\nyes i mean i understand what's going on\nand it's like\nyeah it's and because because i i i\nthink actually like i would even go as\nfar as to say that your conception that\nthe only re\nyou didn't use the word only but i think\nthat when your mind says the\nyou know the reason we're friends is\nbecause we're stuck together that\nimplies to me that you don't acknowledge\nthat there's like a genuine value and\nthere's just circumstance it's karma\nright but like when you think about\nfriends like that's how friends get made\nlike so friends are made through\nrepeated unplanned interactions and\ncommon cause\nyes but what i'm really hearing is like\ni think that you know the next time you\nhave a good day or a bad\nday or there's something that you think\nthat someone else\ndoesn't want to hear i think you should\ntry sharing it with them\nall right what do you think about that\ni try to do that but it's just like i\nstill hold back you know\nyep so what do you hold back i just\ndon't talk about\ni just stay off on my own like so a lot\nof time i'll try to talk to people but\nit's like yep so so what i'm talking\nabout is not what you already do it's\nwhat you hold back yeah\ni just don't do it as much as i should\nlike i don't say i'm lazy but it's like\ni don't put the effort in that i should\nand then no i i don't don't be\nself-judgmental i'm gonna discount\nanything because that's like anything\nthat's self-blaming\nor implies a deficiency i'm gonna\nsidestep as best as i can\nwell doesn't it take two to tango like i\nhave people reach out to me\nokay you know it's like i don't feel\nlike i reciprocate in the same way that\nthey're coming to me you know what\nwhat keeps you from reciprocating just\ni'm too used to being on my own kind of\nthing you know like\nthat's my normal that's my normality\nit's like i'm off on my\nworld i'm sure that habit has something\nto do with it but\ni would say like you know so for example\ntoday\ncan you think of a single person that\nyou can reach out to\nafter we're done talking of course\nand will you do that\nyes okay and\nwhat is going to be the purpose of you\nreaching out to them\nto talk to them okay i don't i don't\nlike having\nultimate terrier motives or anything\nyeah you know and and so like what is\nsomething can you think of a person that\nthere's something that a part of you\nwanted\nthere's a part of you that wanted to\nshare but you held back with a\nparticular person can you think of a\nscenario like that\num like ideally within the last like\nweek or two\nbecause it can be weird if it's like a\nsix month old interaction but\ni mean just like i'm just like talking\nabout something like\nmaybe something silly like just\nsomething that happened like that kind\nof you know like i'm not gonna give like\na specific example but\nit's just those are the kind of moments\nyou know like i just never reach out to\npeople\nyeah so i i so here's what i would\nrecommend to you\nbrandon is do that today\nreach out to someone and do whatever\nwhatever you normally do\ndo more and this is the the main thing\nso this is not going to be about\nforming friendships this is actually\ngoing to be a part of your\nmeditation practice okay\nokay so what i want you to do is as you\nreach out to someone so i want you to\nthink about something that\nyou have kept hidden from someone else\nlike it doesn't have to be like\ndeep dark secret you know but like you\nknow that voice in your mind that tells\nyou like oh they don't want to hear\nabout that\nlike i just made a bunch of money on amc\nor i lost a bunch of money on\ndogecoin like you take your pick right\nand or even it's it and like i would\ntake\nsomething that you're uncomfortable with\nsharing something and this is where the\nmeditation practice comes in\nas you think about the interaction your\nmind\nis going to tell you reasons not to do\nit\nyour mind is going to tell you oh they\ndon't want to hear about that\noh that's gonna be too much like that's\ngonna sound pathetic i'm gonna like\nlike you know like i'm gonna it's so\npathetic i'm so pathetic if i say that\nto them\nand notice it aware it oh become aware\nof it\nin the moment and sit with that feeling\ndon't try to explain oh this i'm just\ndoing this because it's my habit\nlike like and then like you're gonna\nnotice the because pop up\njust sit with that feeling which makes\nyou feel for lack of a better term ugly\nit's a feeling of ugliness\nright like it's like deformity\ndeficiency like it's something\nand then i know it's gonna sound weird\nbut i want you to watch\nso then i want you to share whatever it\nis that you don't want to share\nand if you can't share it that's\nactually okay\njust notice what it is that keeps you\nfrom sharing\nnotice that feeling of deformity and\nugliness and deficiency\nis so powerful that you can't actually\nlike\nget the words out or\nshare it and as you share it notice what\nhappens to that feeling\nwatch it don't even worry about what\nthey say just watch yourself\nokay what do you think about that\ni can do this quest accepted\nokay awesome\nyeah i i think brandon this has a lot to\ndo with you man i mean i know i said\nthis self you know i know some of what\ni'm saying is gonna sound\nnot hypocritical but contradictory it's\ntangled up\nbut i think you're sure it's all about\nyou but not about you\nyeah so your shortcoming is that you\naccept more shortcomings than you're\nresponsible for\ni can agree with that but yeah okay\nnever mind\nyeah yeah yeah so it's fine to have the\nbutt right like i'm not\ndisputing the butt has value i think in\nyour case you just\nlean too much on what's on the other\nside of the butt\nlet's get taken out of context i do lean\nto the butt a lot\nyeah right the butt the because\nthe the like and and that's where like\nbecause\nwhen you get into the logic like you\nmove away from that feeling and what you\nneed to do is sit with that feeling\nbecause that's the feeling that like you\nknow like when you were failing out and\nlike\nyeah you know what did your parents do\nwhen they found out that you had to\nrepeat a year they didn't care\nright because i had i just like told\nthem like i'm gonna do this\nand then they're like okay so like like\nit's hard but like\nit's hard to give people the opportunity\nto care about you\nwhen you've learned over and over again\nthat people don't give a [ __ ]\nso you don't want to overwhelm them but\nlike in overwhelming them like you're\ngiving them the opportunity to like\ngive a [ __ ] but you don't want that\nbecause people have had a lot of\nopportunity like\ndid anyone ever ask like what's wrong\nwith this kid does this kid need help\nlike why isn't he coming to class\nnot really right so like no one has\ncared about you before\nwhy would they care about you now\nand it's hard it's hard because as long\nas you don't ask like that\ntruth like you don't open up to people\nbecause like\nright now you've convinced yourself that\nthat's a question mark maybe people do\ncare about me i'm dating someone clearly\nright so like someone cares me you have\na cat there's there's like my cat cares\nabout me\nthere's there's a certain amount of like\nambiguity about like\nam i worth caring about or not but if\nyou go back to opening up to people like\nand you learn that lesson again then all\nhope is lost\nokay sorry i'm just like i feel like\nemotionally exhausted right now\nyeah yep i think we're done for day\ntoday yeah yeah\nokay i mean i appreciate this and it was\ndefinitely a good experience\nand hope like it helped anybody out\nthere that\nalso may be going through stuff like\nthis so\nyeah thanks thanks for the time gg\nyeah see you later\nyeah good awareness there i'm\nemotionally exhausted too how about\ny'all chat\nsometimes people dodge for like the\nfirst two hours\nno but he wasn't dodging i i think we\nboth genuinely that was a little bit of\na joke"
