    "transcript": "yeah so thank you so much for for\njoining us today dr mike\nyeah of course thank you so much for\nhaving me i'm really excited to have\nthis conversation\num oh really what what is this con are\nwe\nwhat are we talking about well i think\nwe're talking about how\nthe mind and the body are actually\nmind-body not two separate words so\num i'm hopeful that you know i can\nsort of bring up the subject of how\ninterconnected these two subjects\nare and then get your take on your\nexperiences maybe personally maybe\nprofessionally\nif you agree or disagree with some of\nthe statements that i make i always like\nfor these to be as\npersonal and conversational as possible\nbut if you have a different\nway of doing it in mind i'm all yours\nyeah so sometimes when people come on or\nactually usually when people come on\nwe'll have like something more of a\npersonal conversation where you know i\nthink a lot of people\nare interested to hear actually like\nyour story\nand and kind of um sometimes people will\ncome on and we'll have\nuh you know particular questions that um\nor sometimes they're facing challenges\nand\nand potentially want to work through\nsome of those but i i recognize that you\nknow as\nboth being like medical professionals\nlike we could have a conversation about\nsomething instead of doing\na more traditional like personal\ninterview kind of thing\nso i'm really game for both um it really\ndepends on\nyou know what yeah i'd love to have a\nconversation about the subject\nof the the mind body connection and from\nthere if we have personal anecdotes to\nwork those in\nuh i i'm open to sharing some stuff so\nthat's cool\nso let's get started so tell me about\nthe mind body\nconnection yeah so for me um\njust to give a little background i'm a\nboard-certified family medicine doctor\nuh but i happen to be a d.o not an md\nwhich is an equally licensed medical\nlicensed degree\nin the united states and basically the\npremise of our education in comparison\nto that of\nmd education is we really try and put\nforth a holistic\npatient forward approach to everything\nand anything that we do in the field of\nhealth care\nthis could mean something as simple as a\npatient coming in with acid reflux\nsymptoms\nand instead of simply fixing the acid\nreflux to a medication\nwe would do that but in addition to look\nat some of the risk factors that that\npatient might have in their everyday\nlives that are predisposing them to\ncontinually having\nthis acid reflux condition and as a\nresult we kind of take a bigger picture\napproach\nwhen it comes to treating patients\nusing that background i've started\ntreating\na lot of patients for pain\nbecause what would happen is any time a\ncolleague in my hospital\nin a nearby hospital in urgent care\nwould run into a patient who's having\nchronic pain issues\nor perhaps an acute pain condition they\nwould\nend up sending them to me as a referral\nfor osteopathic treatment\nbecause in addition to this patient\nfirst philosophy that we have in do\nschools we also learn an\nextra hands-on technique called omt\nand it's not really one technique it's\nmore of a therapy it's more of a way of\nthinking\nit's not magical it may look somewhat\nlike\nphysical therapy like chiropractic\nmedicine but in theory it's more\nmedical in nature in that we use the\nbody's own mechanisms that\nno one disagrees with in the medical\ncommunity to try and help patients out\nwith their pain\nor perhaps with the dysfunction that's\ncausing them a\nconcern so an example this could be\na patient having recurrent tension\nheadaches as a result of spasms in their\nneck\nuh a proper and osteopathic exam could\ngo into\nwhat their work ergonomic situation is\nlike are they sitting in the right chair\nwhere where's their monitor\nin relationship to their eye level then\nputting our hands on the neck feeling\nwhere the dysfunction comes from\nchecking the joints above and below\nmeaning that if it's the neck\nuh we're checking the thoracic region as\nwell and not just forgetting that the\ncervical spine is connected to the\nthoracic spine and there's impacts of\nthat\nchecking for shoulder dysfunctions\nseeing if a patient is using one\nshoulder over another because of\nanother injury that exists and then\nfiguring out a way to\ntreat that condition whether it's\nthrough using the body's own reflexes to\nrelax\nthis spasm because the body has a lot of\nthese innate reflexes in it where it\nuh essentially turns on some muscles and\nturns on other muscles\ni'll give you an example if you ever try\npushing against a stationary object like\na wall\nor a pole and you know that object's not\nmoving\nwhat your mind tends to do is actually\nsend signals to those muscles that are\nbeing activated during this isometric\ncontraction where the muscle is not\nlengthening not shortening\nis to relax because it doesn't like to\nwaste energy on something where there is\nno eccentric or concentric motion\nhappening\nso we use that body's response to an\nisometric contraction in order to induce\nrelaxation\nand increase range of motion in spasm\nareas that's fascinating i wonder if\nactually that i i never connected\nthe isometric contraction i wonder if\nactually that is partially responsible\nfor the clinical superiority of\nexercises like especially yoga which are\nessentially isometric contractions right\nbecause you take a position and you hold\nit\nand whether that because i know that\nyoga is sort of superior to physical\nexercise in terms of\nrecruiting like or shutting down the hpa\naxis\nand i never thought i never realized\nthat there was actually a mechanism that\ninvolves isometric contraction that\ninduces relaxation but that sort of\nbecause i've been always curious why\nyoga\nsometimes outperforms exercise in\nclinical trials and this is the first\ntime that i've ever heard of a\npotential physiologic mechanism through\nwhich it acts\nfast yeah and there's another level why\nyoga is\nprobably superior in a lot of instances\nbecause of breathing the hpa axis\nis directly affected upon our\nsympathetic or parasympathetic state\nand we can control that state based on\nhow we control our breathing\nand this is where i can throw in a\npersonal anecdote i'm horrible at\ncontrolling my breathing\ni tend to hold my breath a lot maybe not\nwhen i'm doing weight lifting but\nif i'm bending over to tie my shoe i\ncatch myself holding my breath to focus\non tying the shoe even though it's such\na simple task\nbut when we do that we actually start\ndecreasing our ability to heal our\nability to breathe properly\nand yoga really institutes proper\nbreathing mechanics where it's\ndiaphragmatic breathing\nbelly coming out lower ribcage spreading\nout to the sides\nand you can practice this not even just\ndoing yoga through a mindfulness session\nand that's where i think a lot of the\nbenefits of yoga comes from probably\nthose two\ninstances and while isometric\ncontraction is really crucial in yoga\neccentric contraction which a lot of\ntimes is missed out on when you're doing\nweight training i'll give an example so\nif you're pushing a weight like you're\ndoing a bench press\nuh the eccentric contraction is when\nyou're bringing the weight down\nwhere the muscle essentially slowly\nlengthening but still contracting\nto control the the lengthening process\nyeah that is a very good way\nto rehabilitate your muscles injured\nmuscles it's actually\nthe best form of rehabilitation so if\nyou have like\na achilles injury a calf injury\nthese types of eccentric contractions is\nwhat your physical therapist is likely\nto focus on first\nso yoga in in contradiction to like when\nwe push our weights down and then drop\nthem real quickly and then push them\nback\nup really focuses on that eccentric\nisometric phase the breathing phase\nand that's where you get so much of the\nbenefit obviously in addition to the\nmindfulness component of it so i'm glad\nyou brought up yoga i don't know if\neccentric contractions is also something\nin the back of your mind or something\nyou've heard before what are your\nthoughts on that\nno so i'm i'm not so i'm not familiar\nwith this degree of\num you know physiology around muscle\ncontraction like it's certainly not\nit's not something that i've like\nstudied extensively so it's fascinating\nto hear i mean i if you asked me what an\neccentric contraction was i wouldn't\neven i wouldn't even know\nit's interesting because when i think\nabout yoga though i think you know most\nof yoga is not actually about movement\nit's about stillness\nso if i had to put my money somewhere\ni'd say that you know the isometric\ncomponent of yoga\ngenerally speaking outweighs the\neccentric component\nbut at the same time you certainly have\ncompared to regular exercise a very\nsignificant amount of eccentric\nmuscular movement right because it's\nabout slow movements that involve like\ngradually moving from one place to the\nother\num you know so you definitely have that\nit's interesting i\ni wasn't i never connected those dots\nlike i didn't realize\num you know i have some theories about\nhow yoga works and stuff like that but i\njust didn't have the resolution of\nunderstanding of\nmuscular physiology to really connect\nthose dots that was fascinating\nyeah i think that highlights why\nosteopathic medicine is so cool because\nwe\nthink so holistically in our approach\nthat when a patient comes in\nwith musculoskeletal pain of the neck\nwhile we are thinking about this\napproach\nwe're simultaneously thinking about the\nanatomy of the region for\nyou know real like medical interventions\nwhether it's medicinal\nuh injection based surgical approaches\nand it's not that i do all of these\napproaches\nbut i keep them in the back of my mind\nwhen i'm trying to figure out which\npatient\nis best suitable for these options and\nin thinking this way and seeing so many\npatients who were in pain\nover and over and over again i began to\nsee a relationship between\nthe mental health state of my patients\nin addition to\ntheir um pain that they were\nexperiencing or physical symptoms that\nthey were experiencing\nand while it's very easy to conflate\nthis correlation and say oh well of\ncourse someone that's in pain is going\nto be in an unhappier mental state who's\ngoing to be happy when they're in pain\nthat is in fact true but what i started\nseeing in doing thorough histories of my\npatients is that\nthe mental health state preceded\nthe physical pain and once the mental\nhealth state\nwas treated because it was largely\noverlooked in their past\ntreatments that's when the physical pain\nwent away\nbecause i would have patients come in\nand they would start saying you know\ntheir elbow pain was bothering them for\nsix months\nthey've had mris cat scans x-rays you\nknow doctors would do special tests and\nthere was nothing to be found\nanatomically\nbut this is not to say that this patient\nis making this up\nwhat the reality is they were still\nsubjectively feeling this pain\nit was debilitating to them because it\nprevented them from doing their work or\nenjoying their life\nso it was real it just the source wasn't\nanatomical\nand a lot of times our healthcare system\nfalters here because\nif they can't point to something on an\nimaging scan\nwe right away start writing this patient\noff or we stop being able to help them\nbecause it's not reimbursable well by\ninsurance companies because we can't say\nlook this is what they have this is why\nwe're doing x for z\nand i did a lot of research into this\nfield and i came across\na great book called the divided mind by\ndr john sarno\nthe late dr john sarno actually and\nhis field of research is he's by\ntraining or he was by training a\nphysical medicine and rehabilitation\nspecialist the pm in our physician\nso he wasn't the mental health\nspecialist by any means\nand he actually worked and taught at nyu\nmedical school\num at nyu medical center just by me\nand through his research he actually\nfound\nthat helping patients deal with some of\ntheir most\nrepressed childhood potentially\ncurrent negative life situations\nmental health situations treating those\nactually yielded better results for his\npain patients his chronic pain patients\nhis acute injury patients and he started\ndoing research on this\nwhere it wasn't just okay let's see this\npatient let's see if they improved he\nactually started doing mri studies can i\njump in for a second by the way should i\ncall this mike or dr michael\nmike is fine mike is fine um so let me\nask you what do you think is the\nmechanism of that how does that work\num i don't know i don't have a good\nanswer for it yet\nthere are definitely proposed mechanisms\nhis research focused on\nfor example if you had a true injury\nlet's say in your low back\nand you had a pulled muscle in the past\nwhat he saw\nin mri studies at mri research that\nindividuals when they were in a\nstressful state\nthe body actually limited the amount of\nblood flow to those areas\nin order to decrease their stress\nand this was a high level of stress of\nthinking about those\nrepressed thoughts those acute stress\nthoughts and instead focused\non a physical problem that low back pain\nand it functioned as a distraction to\nnot\noverwhelm the body the mind\nand this was a theory and this is a very\nout there theory and some\nphysicians disagree with this theory it\nwas the route he chose to explore\nit's actually not that out there in fact\nthere's good evidence to support that\nbecause\nif you look at self-injurious behavior\nso self-injurious behavior that's not\nsuicidal like cutting and\nburning and things like that these are\nactually not injuries that\nif you really look at self-injurious\nbehavior it's fascinating because from\nan evolutionary standpoint\nwhat people do is the thing that causes\nthe least damage to their body\nand also hurts the most\nso if you look at cutting it's very\nsuperficial cuts\nand so if you think about what's that\nperson actually doing and if you talk to\npeople who engage in self-injurious\nbehavior what you actually find\nis that they their goal in the\nself-injurious behavior is almost\nmeditative in nature\nthat that eliciting a cut slowly like\ntime and time and time again actually\ndistracts them from\nemotional feelings and the intensity of\nthe pain is so\ngreat that they literally cannot think\nabout anything else\nso what we tend to find is that you know\nwhen i work with people who have\nself-injurious behavior\nand an addiction that if you control the\naddiction like let's say they're in a\nrehab\nthe self-injurious behavior will get\nworse because they need a coping\nmechanism\nbecause they can't use like alcohol or\nmarijuana or like other things to cope\nso it's really fascinating because i've\nnever you know i i'm not familiar with\nwith\ndr sarno's work but like there's\nactually a decent\nunderstanding that people will actually\ninduce that principle of utilizing pain\nas a distraction from the mind um\nabsolutely\nit doesn't actually sound that out there\nto me it's like that's actually well\ni probably misspoke when i'm saying that\nit's somewhat out there in that\nwe definitely know that that sort of\ndistraction method exists as you said\nthe mechanism with the mind altering\nblood flow\nis the mechanism that is somewhat\nquestionable interesting so that it's\nit's\nless of the patient doing it and more\nlike it's like an automatic\nphysiological you know\nneurophysiological like\nwe're not going to fix this injury to\nprotect our mind\nyeah that that certainly does seem uh\nyou know less understood\nthat's that's cool so but that's one of\nthe mechanisms i mean for me the way\nthat i think about it as an osteopathic\nphysician\nis that not only do we have electro\nco connections in our body from neurons\nbut we also have\nneurochemical connections with\nneurotransmitters with\nhormones that are impacted upon our\nstress levels the way that we feel\nand if we're constantly that hyper\nparasympathetic state\ni know that my patient isn't going to\nhave good circulation of their neck\nbecause what happens when we're in a\nhyper sympathetic state\nwe're locked in so everything is\ntightened there's less circulation\nhappening just because of this state\nbut then you're less likely to look at\nyour surroundings look up and down\nand therefore you have less range of\nmotion and when you have less range of\nmotion you\nbasically develop like a frozen shoulder\nsituation just of your neck\nand therefore you propagate the injury\nmoving forward\nso a lot of the work that i do with my\npatients even though they're coming in\nfor a physical symptom\nis exploring some of this mental health\nside of what they're doing\nand i'm by no means a mental health\nspecialist i'm not a psychiatrist i'm\nnot a psychologist\nwell you're an iphone i'm an fm doc\nbut i broach the subject with them and i\ngauge their interest level in continuing\nthis\nline of communication and once i see\nthat they have\na layer of interest and they want to\npursue and they've seen some good\ninitial\noutcomes we then connect them to a\nmental health specialist who can\nactually continue this work with them\nbut unless i'm going to be the one\nscreening for it catching this early\nthey're never going to see the mental\nhealth specialist in order to get there\nso that's why i find the beauty of\nfamily medicine and osteopathic medicine\ncombining\nin a place where i actually have patient\ncontact at a time when they're\nexperiencing this pain\nand probably when they're most motivated\nto seek help even though\nthey may have come in for a sore arm and\nyet we're now talking about their\nchildhood\nand how things are going in life it's a\nconversation they didn't expect\nyeah absolutely mike do you mind if i\nask you like a couple of questions just\na little bit about your\nyour training and stuff yeah so i've\nnoticed that you've highlighted the fact\nthat you're an osteopathic physician\nlike several times and you're short\nsort of sharing principles of osteopathy\num can you just help me a little bit\nuh understand a little bit about you\nknow\nwhat's the reason that you kind of\nhighlight things that way\nthat you kind of draw that distinction\nyeah so\nwhen i was uh in high school i had\noptions of where i wanted to go\nfor college and then thinking about\nmedical school in the future because i\nknew it was something i was passionate\nabout\nand when my father actually immigrated\nfrom russia to the united states at age\n40 i was six years old at the time\nhe actually went to medical school and\nresidency all over again\nin the united states and he happened to\ngo to an osteopathic school the same\nschool that i attended\nand i got to witness him learning omt\nthe principles\nof being a do and it became part of my\ninnate knowledge\nof how i treat patients it's become\nsomething that i'm very proud of\nbecause historically in the united\nstates there has been some stigma\naround osteopathic physicians as being\nperhaps too\nalternative or not thinking about\nmedications enough and a lot of this\nstems from what osteopathic physicians\nare not physicians\nosteopathy practitioners are across the\nglobe\nfor their for example in some countries\nin europe and in asia\nthey are not fully licensed medical\ndoctors and they do only perhaps perform\nomt and that is such an important\ndistinction to be made because here in\nthe united states we are fully licensed\nwe can practice across any specialty we\ncan get board certified any specialty\nwhen we do our residency training our\nnow programs are combined\nall of them this just happened not too\nlong ago my program where i did my\nfamily medicine training i was trained\nalongside\nmds and do's and after a while we forgot\nwho was an md and who is a do because\nour principles align so much that we\ntook away what they learned in school\nthey took away what we learned in school\nand it really became merged\nso much so that if i'm being honest the\ndifferences in\nmd and do education is shrinking year to\nyear\nbecause the mda curriculum is learning\nhow well this holistic approach works\nthat they've incorporated into their own\nuh honestly mike that's that's why i was\na little bit surprised by you\nhighlighting because i like in my mind\nlike\nwhether someone is an md or do um\nyou know i i don't like i fully\nunderstand\nuh that you know osteopathy has a\ndifferent perspective that you all learn\nomt and we don't\ni in my experience honestly of do versus\nmd school is that\nyou all learn everything that we learn\nand you guys learn extra stuff\nyeah you know i think it also came from\nthe idea that\nthe entrance exams and grades initially\nto get into osteopathic schools were\nsomewhat lower\nin that they were taking non-traditional\napplicants perhaps those who are going\ninto their second career\nuh immigrant applicants and as a result\npeople just looked at the scores and\nsaid oh well if i want to be competitive\nand go to the highest\nspecialty possible you know plastic\nsurgery ophthalmology\ni'll have a better shot by becoming an\nmd and that sort of changed the patient\nthe student selection for who went to\neach school\nbut now i think it's changing because\nnow we see do\nmedical students and do doctors across\nall these specialties\nand you know at some of the highest\npositions in the united states\nthe former president uh personal\nphysician\nthe current president's personal\nphysician both were do's\none is obviously still a deo and um the\nthe head of medicine for nasa as a do\nwe we really are now starting to expand\ninto being everywhere\nbut i still bring up the concept of\nosteopathy because it's really my\nfoundation as to why i think\nholistically it happened because of my\neducation\nand in seeing how my md colleagues were\ntrained it's not that they got a lower\nform of education they're brilliant\nphysicians\nit was just with a slightly different\nfocus but i honestly think that focus is\nchanging and it's shifting for the\nbetter\nwhat what would you say is the\ndifference in the focus that your md\ncolleagues got\nthey had an intense understanding of the\nphysiology\nand the pathophysiology behind\nconditions\nbut less of the psychosocial components\nless of the communication component and\ni can give a very concrete example here\nwhen i went in as a third year student\nuh into my clinicals into my internal\nmedicine rotation\nin inner city brooklyn i was very\ncomfortable performing physical exams\nbecause from year one as a do you're uh\nworking on your other classmates doing\nosteopathic manipulative therapy so\nyou're\ngetting used to what it's like to feel\nnormal structures on a body\nyou're getting used to interacting with\ndifferent uh\npeople different shapes different sizes\netc so when i came in\ni was very ready to talk to a patient to\nfeel what was going on\nto feel perhaps a tumor earlier than\nother colleagues of mine so i i think\nthat that\nhelped me in a way to be a better\nphysician\nand again every school is different\nevery residency program is different\ni only highlight this because that\nstigma that existed\nprobably 10 20 years ago more so than it\ndoes today against ceos\nto really highlight the fact that not\nonly are we so similar each year we're\nbecoming more and more similar\nabsolutely man so i mike i'm noticing\nthat you know a lot of your\nit sounds like you've thought a lot\nabout what you're sharing today like\nit sounds um you know very well\norganized\ni i can sort of see that the teacher\ninside you coming out\num and and so i'm a little bit honestly\ncurious about because it sounds like you\nsort of\nyou know it sounds like you kind of\nfigured things out bro i\nappreciate you saying that um i probably\nshould prepare\nmore for when i give presentations but i\nlike for it to come from an\norganic place because as i present\ninformation like this\ni'm actually at the same time while i'm\npresenting it trying to re-understand\nand process it myself\nso that if i say something that doesn't\nmake sense it's because i'm actively\ntrying to listen to myself speak\nkind of a way that i uh fact check\nmyself\nespecially when making youtube videos\nand social media content so\ni tend not to like to prepare for things\nlike this because\ni wanted to be like you're a patient or\nyou're a friend of mine who's asking me\nthese questions and we're just having a\nconversation about it\nyeah absolutely so i'm not i'm not\ngetting the sense that you're over\nprepared at all but i i just i'm hearing\na certain organization\nto your you know the way you're kind of\ntalking and like\nit really sounds like i'm talking to a\nteacher it reminds me\nof being in class like in medical school\nwhere you know\ni and i i totally get that you don't\nknow everything but at the same time\nwhat i'm hearing is\na very um you know strong and consistent\nrepresentation of\nwhen you work with a patient when you\nkind of think holistically\nyou've noticed that there are very\nreal mental components that will\ncontribute to someone's physical pain\num and i mean i you know i i don't\ni kind of i'm with you yeah i mean i i\nlove that we're on the same page on that\nbecause for me i've always been a\ncurious individual i think my uh\neither my college or medical school\napplication\nuh title was essay title was why am i\nalways hungry\nand it was hungry for knowledge and\nwhenever i see a patient\ni always treat every interaction as uh\nlike one interaction and then i think\nabout it later what could i do to\nimprove that interaction or what i could\ndo better to be\na better doctor and i think about the\nunanswered questions i have\nand i think about that not just for\nosteopathic principles but also for\nlike if a patient comes in for strep\nthroat why am i giving antibiotics for\nstrep throat\nthe the scary reality is if we ask most\ndoctors why we treat strep throat\ni think most doctors won't know the\nanswer to that question like they're\ngoing to say oh to get better faster or\nthey'll say oh because that's cardiac\ncomplications bro\nright yeah cardiac complications\nrheumatic fever\nand the reality is if you don't take uh\nantibiotics\nthe symptoms will only on average be 16\nhours longer\nso it's not like patients think oh i\nneed to get my antibiotics so i can get\nbetter quicker\nnot really going to happen and we're\nreally preventing complications like you\nsaid cardiac rheumatic fever any\npotentially kidney complications\nbut most doctors don't know that they\nthink they're just treating the bacteria\nwhere the bacteria here is not so much a\nthreat as if it spreads it becomes\nproblematic and even then\nit's a thin line as we study more and\nmore how often should we be doing this\nwhat's the risk versus benefit in doing\nthis\nand we're starting to continually\nexplore our knowledge here that's why i\nfell in love with medicine because we're\ncontinually learning we're continually\nfact checking ourselves because even in\nan era like this where misinformation's\nso prominent\npeople are like the science is wrong no\nscience is never wrong scientists are\nwrong doctors are wrong\nthe science is never wrong the science\nis the process that helps us figure out\nthat we were wrong or that our\nhypotheses were wrong\nso i love reading about that studying\nthat and applying it to my everyday\nsort of patients and such mike i find\nthat the things that i'm the most\ncurious about are actually like more\nyou as opposed to your patient\ninteractions because it's fascinating to\nhear\num you know maybe it's because i'm a\npsychiatrist but speaking holistically\nlike here we are having a conversation\nabout mind-body connection\nand what i'm sort of seeing is the\nperson underneath\nlike so you're asking the question but\nwhat i'm really find myself kind of\ncurious about is like\nwho is the person asking the question i\nmean just so far\nyou know because i think you like i said\ni think you've explained everything\nreally well i mean you clearly know what\nyou're talking about\nand so what i'm kind of curious about\nbecause you sort of don't\nleave questions unanswered in the way\nthat you speak i think you do a really\ngood job of\nof you know kind of laying things out\noffering examples things like that\nsharing personal anecdotes and it really\ngets woven together like quite\nbeautifully\nbut what i find myself being curious\nabout is you know who is the person who\nwrote that essay\nwhat was it like to have a dad who was\nan osteopathic physician and you kind of\nsaid that like you grew up with this\nstuff right\nand so i'm kind of thinking a little bit\nabout like if we want to change\nmedicine to be a little bit more\nholistic like honestly the stuff that i\nwant to ask you like i'm sure i could\nask you questions about\nyou know how you approach acid reflux\nbut to be honest what i'm the most\ncurious about is actually like\nyou yeah i know i mean absolutely if you\nwant to venture into that i'm happy to\ntalk about anything i consider myself\nuh one of those people on social media\nthat treats life like an open book\nso uh whatever questions or whichever\ndirection you want to take this you're\nthe host\nyou lead the way yeah so if i ask\nanything that you think is kind of out\nof line or you don't feel comfortable\nanswering you know just feel free but\nlike i was just curious so it sounds\nlike you\nyou i mean you moved to the united\nstates at the age of six\ncan you tell me a little bit about what\nwhat you remember about\nrussia and yeah i don't remember much\num i just remember leaving very abruptly\num\nmy one story that i remember that i tell\nquite often is a really funny story i\nremember i guess my entrepreneurial\nsense was even very healthy back then\nwhere my dad went to the food market and\nbought some\npears home and corn on the cob home\nand i was eating some corn on the cob in\nthe playground and some of the older\nkids were like oh we want some corn\nand i'm like well i have some corn\nupstairs they're like oh we'll buy it\nfrom you at a markup so i ran upstairs\nand then i realized we had no more corn\nleft because my whole family ate it\nso instead i brought outside pears and i\nsaid okay i'll\nsell you these pairs and i started\nselling pairs at like\n5x the cost which is still not that much\nmoney obviously\nuh to everyone on the playground\ngrandparents kids older kids etc\nand i brought home and i showed my dad\nthe money i'm like look\nand like very surprising to me my dad\nyells at me and says\nhow dare you rip people off um get you\nhave to go back and give everyone\nback their money and i gave everyone\nback their money some people wouldn't\ntake it back they were like no you sold\nme the pair i knew what i was getting\nand you keep it\nand he came with me and we went to those\npeople's houses and he made me give it\nback and\nthey laughed and they took their money\nback but um\ni don't know why that story stuck in my\nhead i guess it might have been a\ndramatic experience of sorts but\nthat is what sticks with me most uh from\nmy russian experience\ni mean i'm not hearing traumatic what\ni'm hearing the word i'd use is\nformative\nperhaps yep right so like sometimes i\nunderstand why you kind of go towards\ntraumatic because a lot of times we\nthink of dramatic experiences as\nformative\nyou know they shape the way that we look\nat things but i i mean\nwhat what do you think it was that your\ndad was trying to like like\nteach you there like what'd you come\naway with\ni think he was probably going for\nfairness\nequality making sure that i'm never\nunethical or moral in my dealings\nand i think it definitely stuck i mean\nin the work that we do\non my social media channel i think i\ndon't know if it's directly because of\nthat situation obviously but the way\nthat i was raised definitely affects the\nway that i run\nsocial media as a business entity like i\ndon't know like a lot of\nyou know youtubers sell merch and while\ni think it's great to make money from\nyour audience i feel like i'm already so\nblessed with the success that i've had\nwe like to do it all for charity or we\nhave a patreon\nand again we're taking money from the\naudience instead we decide every month\nwhere collectively as a group where\nwe're going to donate that money\nand i like to do good as much as i can\nin addition to you know succeeding on my\nown like i i would want it to be a\nuniversal success as much as possible\ni i'm not in favor when i say that the\ncommunist model by any means we left\nrussia for\na reason but um if people are working\nfor it i want them to succeed as much as\npossible and\nwitnessing my immigrant family go\nthrough it i think that definitely\ninstilled some strong morals in me and\nthat was a formative experience for sure\nwhat do you mean by watching your\nimmigrant family go through it\num well coming to the united states you\nknow we're very poor\nwe lived on welfare for the first few\nyears here in the u.s\nespecially when my father was in school\nmy mom was a phd math professor\nat an esteemed university in russia when\ncoming here she didn't speak english\nso she was sweeping floors to make ends\nmeet\nshe was saving money on bus fare like\nthe dollar\nbus fare or what it was at the time and\nwould walk two three miles to work every\nday\nlike there was this russian saying that\ni frequently revisit in my videos called\ncheers and it means going through i\ncan't\nthat's the very literal translation of\nit but um\nit's almost like nike's just do it i\nguess my dad was a fan of nike back in\nthe\nearly 90s can you help me that sounds\nlike a cool\nsaying can you explain what what the\nmeaning of it is going through i can't\nyeah so when things get going it's\nbasically pushing through the struggles\nuh you know there's plenty of great\nquotes out there michael jordan one\nsticks out of my head of if there's an\nobstacle in front of you\nthink about going through it think about\ngoing over it think about you know\ndigging underneath\nuh i'm probably butchering that quote\nbut i'm paraphrasing uh i see so like\nthat's sort of\nworking through i can't like yeah like\nyou don't wanna say i can't\nthis is hard don't let that emotion stop\nyou from whatever it is you're seeking\nto accomplish\nwow so it sounds like you're you know\nyour parents worked\nreally hard and and really had uh\ni mean it's got to be tough to go\nthrough my parents um\nboth my parents were medical doctors\nthankfully they didn't have to repeat\nmedical school but they you know they\ndid residency over here\num and and i i mean\nit must have been tough for your dad to\nrepeat medical school and go through\nresidency\nagain i try and put myself in his shoes\nand say okay like i'm a doctor now\nwhat's going to take in 10 years for me\nto be so unhappy living in the united\nstates that i'm going to move to another\ncountry let's say china\nand learn chinese and while i'm learning\nchinese go to a chinese medical school\nand then a residency like\ni don't know how bad it needs to get and\nhow motivated i have to be\n10 years from now to want to do that but\nit shows the level of dedication that he\nhad\nfor the success of myself and my sister\nfor us to\nhave a good childhood and grow up with\nopportunities because that's essentially\nwhy he came here and why we\nbrought her family here and faced all\nthese risks\nand you said you kind of grew up with\nthat holistic perspective at home like\num you know do you have a sense of\nwhether your dad like because i\nassume he went to like a md school in in\nrussia\nand so do you have a sense of like you\nknow how his perspective changed or what\nit means to grow up with a holistic\nperspective at school\ni mean at home yeah i don't know if he\never went into depth\nuh i think it happened through an\nosmosis type of knowledge transfer where\nhe would be practicing omt\nfor his boards or for his exams and he\nwould be practicing on me\nand at the time i was an athlete i was\ndoing taekwondo for about eight nine\nyears i was going to tournaments\nregularly getting\ninjured and him working on me and also\nhelping me focus\non school and giving me these mental\nhealth sort of boosts by telling me i\nneed to go through i can't\ni think that sort of presented that\nholistic picture\nand whether it came from the medical\nschool that he was attending or that's\nwho he was as a person before\nit's hard for me to say can you tell me\nabout taekwondo\nyeah so that was a a really long part of\nmy childhood\nwhen i was six right away they enrolled\nme in this program\num it was like three four days a week a\nlot of training\nuh i was getting pretty good at it too\nwhere i was deciding or at least\nconsidering\ntrying out for the u.s olympic team wow\nand yeah i won some like national\ntournaments and stuff\nfor sparring and i was really excited\nabout it but then with school and i\nmoved\nto a different city i kind of lost track\nwith it and\nstarted playing other sports i became\nlike the captain of my high school\nsoccer team played that\nfor a while and then when i went into my\nseven year combined\nundergrad med school program uh when you\nwere an undergrad they didn't allow you\nto play sports because you were taking\nso many credits it would break the ncaa\nrules so\ni didn't play any collegiate sports\nexcept some intramural stuff here and\nthere\nwow how mike i'm i'm fascinated i mean\nhow do you understand\nwhy i mean how does someone become\nyou know a national taekwondo champion\n[Music]\ncaptain of the soccer team like\nlike how do you do that\ni mean i don't know i was just i it\nwasn't some\npre-thought out plan that i had um i\nthink\ni'm athletic genetically i'm tall i'm\nlean\nso um i was training from an early age\ni think any time that you know you have\nsome good genetics and\nyou put the dedication in you're going\nto have good outcomes\num i didn't achieve you know olympic\nsuccess or do any of this stuff so\ni don't want to take the credit for any\nof this but it was fun i i genuinely\nenjoy sports and i think\ni sort of have taken some of the\nprinciples from sports and applied it to\nmy medical training and\neven the way that i treat patients\nwhether they're one year old or 101 year\nold\ni try and treat them like athletes you\nknow like even parkinson's patients\nwe now treat like athletes we create a\nrehab program\nas if they're rehabbing from a you know\nan acl injury\nin order for them to be uh moving better\nswallowing better working with a\nspeech language pathologist for their\nswallowing working with a physical\ntherapist to improve their gait\nand i really believe in the sports\nphilosophy i think there's a lot of\ngreat takeaways from it\nas well as some negatives you know like\nsports psychology is a really\ninteresting field of research that i'm\nuh\nconstantly looking at connections to the\nmind body from sports is always\nsomething i'm really interested in\nand that sort of interest and constantly\nmoving i think translates well to the\nmedical field\ninteresting and and can you tell me a\nlittle bit it sounds like you went to a\ncombined\nuh seven year undergrad\nmed school program how did you decide to\ndo that\nyeah so i knew i wanted to become a\nphysician\nwhen i was in high school i witnessed uh\nyou know as\nkind of popular as it sounds my father\ngoing through the whole journey\nand seeing that i really enjoyed it that\nit was a respectful field\ni was good at science i liked learning\nabout the human body like i said i was\nsomewhat athletic so\nthat was part of the journey and i said\nwhat's the quickest way i can do it\nbecause i was always in a rush like\ni never had any patience for anything\nand because my father went to that\nprogram he was aware\nthat there was this seven-year program\nthat existed sorry he went to that\nmedical school\nand um i applied and i luckily got\nin and instead of going the undergrad\nroute i was accepted into this very\ncompetitive program where there were\nabout\nlet's say 88 acceptance uh people's\n88 individuals accepted to the program\nand then upon completion of medical\nschool for the seven years like 13\n14 individuals finished so you had to\nmaintain a very strict gpa in undergrad\nyou have to get an mcat score to\ncontinue\ninto the medical school portion and also\nlife gets in the way i mean in seven\nyears things change\nfor people you know when you're 16 17 18\nyears old you're making a decision what\nyou want to do\nfor your rest of your life people change\nand grow\nyeah so i it's interesting because you\nsay that you you knew you wanted to be a\nphysician in high school can you help me\nare these two personal by the way or is\nthis cool no no absolutely not yeah of\ncourse please\num how did you know you wanted to be a\nphysician\nyeah i mean like i knew as much as a 16\nor 17 year old would know anything\nlike i didn't know but uh i thought\nit was a good choice and that it was\nsomething i enjoyed\ni thought it was a good choice because\nit lined up with my skill set\ncommunicating with patients having an\ninterest in the human body being able to\nfocus to actually study on these topics\nbecause my mom being a math professor i\nhated math\nyou know like luckily she tutored me so\nmuch so that i crushed the sat because\nof her i almost got a perfect score on\nthe math portion\nbut if you told me i had to study math\non my own it would never happen\num so science was just a like a really\nhappy line that matched up with my uh\nskill line\nthat worked really well for a career and\nseeing what the intricacies were like\nlike a lot of students say they want to\ngo into medicine\nbut they have no idea what medicine is i\nknew i went with my dad to his residency\nwhen he when there was a bring your\nchild to work day i saw what his on-call\nrooms were like i saw\nwhat looked like when he was studying\nwith his power points\nhis textbooks so like i kind of got an\ninside look at the journey\nand i got the good with the bad he never\nforced me to become a doctor in fact he\nsaid you sure you want to do this\nprobably not ideal\nour health care system is broken i'm\ndoing this because i'm old and there's\nnothing else to do you can do anything\nbut uh he he always spoke very highly\nabout his connection with his patients\nand how it's never a dull day and the\ncareer sold itself for me\nwow so\nmed school then how did you decide on\nfamily medicine or what\nyeah yeah so i initially wanted to\npursue the field of surgery going into\nmedical school\nand i during my first two years that\nstill held true\nduring my third year surgical rotation\nit was about 12 weeks and i spent that\ntime in lutheran medical center\na very high trauma area\nit was a level one trauma center and i\nscrubbed into like 60 surgeries at the\ntime maybe 70 surgeries\nand i was like i want to make a good\nimpression because this is a\nprogram that accepts some of our medical\nschool applicants so maybe i want to go\nhere\nand the more and more i did it i\nrealized it's not where my skill set was\nit wasn't where i found myself to be\nmost happy while i enjoyed the technical\nprowess of becoming a surgeon\ni disliked the fact that i didn't get\ncontinuity with the patients that i\ndidn't get to communicate much with them\nbecause the reality is they're asleep\nfor the majority of the time so um\ni spent a lot of time doing family\nmedicine as well because that's part of\nyour required\nrotations and then i found myself just\naddicted to the field that i constantly\nwanted to do it more and more\nmy fourth year i had like five different\nfamily medicine rotations as my\nelectives\ni was also really passionate about\nsports medicine i\nconsidered making that as part of my\nfellowship training after residency\nand i started even during my residency\nmy first year covering sporting events\nhigh school college football games um\nand i i was really passionate about that\nas well especially being an osteopathic\nphysician\nand you know i just kept exploring more\nand more family medicine was the field\nfor me\nfascinating yeah i think the the most\nimportant lesson i took away from\nmy surgery rotation was that if you\nround super early in the morning no one\nwants to talk to you\nand it's something that i actually\nsometimes would use when i'd be\nlike moonlighting so i'd cover like you\nknow weekends at hospitals and stuff\nand you know shift starts at 6 30. so a\nlot of times we're like oh you know like\nyou can start rounding around eight or\nnine\nyou know the patients will be awake then\ni was like uh i'm gonna round it like\nseven well speaking of mind and body\nisn't that like messed up that we do\nthat to patients who are healing in the\nhospital\nwe don't let them sleep and then we\nround on them at 5am and they're\nlike not getting better because they're\nnot resting we're we're pretty evil in\nhospitals and oh that's the worst food\never\ni i think i think hospital care is\nimportant and i think that's part of the\nreason why\nyou know people get so much better after\nthey leave is because\nyou know um and speaking of you know\ngiving people healthy food this is a\nif i can share a story one of my\nfavorite stories from residency is on\nthe inpatient psychiatry unit\num uh at mass general hospital they were\ndoing like you know they're trying to be\nhealthy right so like they're they're\nlike their\nfood has gotten a lot healthier over\ntime and it's actually like the\ncafeteria is like pretty good\nokay um so relatively healthy like\nrelatively tasty\nand so we had this one person that was\nhospitalized\nwho had a lot of behavioral problems we\nhad to keep on calling security you know\ninpatient psychiatry um i'm sure you\nremember a little bit about how it can\nbe sometimes\nand and so one of my colleagues was just\nabsolutely brilliant\nand and she was just incredibly\ncompassionate this\npatient is just really combative um\nand and so she sort of asked him like\nyou know like what like\nis there anything we can do like what do\nyou hate about being here you hate being\nhere we can't let you leave i'm so sorry\nabout that is there anything that i can\ndo\nand so somehow i think she like figured\nout that he wanted like chicken fingers\nso what she did is get him a pediatric\nmenu\nright because like the adult menus have\nlike salads and like you know like\nyou know wheat bread with like lean\nprotein kind of sandwiches\nso she got him a pediatric menu and like\nthe\nthe behavioral disturbances just tanked\nhe was just like as long as he got his\nchicken fingers and pizza and stuff like\nthat and then the funny thing is like\nthe rest of the unit like started to\nrevolt\nbecause they're like why does he get\nchicken figures and i just get\nsalad and so then we had this like like\nunit why they're like i want my chicken\nfingers like where's my attendees at you\nknow\nand so it was it was a real problem our\nour unit like you know the person who\nran the unit was like really frustrated\nwith the situation because\nhe's actually someone who's very into\nlike diet and you know all about like\nmind body kind of stuff and like we have\nto\nyou know we have to you know offer\npatients like healthy\nfoods and so some people you know we\njust sort of\ni think some people ended up you know it\nwas like 10 days on the unit for a week\nand then people started to get\ndischarged and then\nsort of evened itself out but yeah yeah\nwell that's like a form of risk\nreduction right so like\nyou know eating chicken fingers isn't\ngreat but if it's going to prevent\npatients from harming themselves or\nharming others maybe chicken fingers\naren't so bad\nabsolutely right i think that's that was\nultimately the approach is that it's way\nbetter than\ninjecting them with medication that they\ndon't want like just give them some you\nknow give them some tenders\num i love that you call them attendees\nthat's awesome\nyeah that you know attendees\ni don't know if you you're how familiar\nyou are with 4chan familiar with 4chan\nuh i've heard of it that's like a\nreddit-esque forum right\ni don't know people are going to be\ninsulted or flattered by that comparison\ni don't know so fortunately yeah yeah so\n4chan is um\nit's a message board that's entirely\nanonymous\nso there are no accounts and or maybe\ni don't know if there are accounts or\nnot but like since it's all anonymous it\ntends to\num get a lot of flack for actually\nthere's a lot of like weird and\nrelatively toxic stuff there because\nand so a lot of like memes and and\nthings like that come out of 4chan and\none of the big things that\nthat came out of 4chan is actually\nattendees and i don't know if you were\nfollowing any of this gamestop\nkind of stuff yep we're actually doing\nuh\num we're actually in the process of\ndoing a research paper\non um prevalence of different mental\nhealth conditions on 4chan um and i\nwonder have you ever heard of something\ncalled arfid i know it's like a\nrelatively new diagnosis it's like a\nwait are fit you said arfid yeah it's\nlike a\nrestrictive it's a restrictive feeding\ndisorder it's like a new kind of eating\ndisorder\nso kind of on the frontier is relatively\nnew diagnosis but the interesting thing\nis that\num people who have arfid who basically\ncan't eat certain foods because they\ncan't tolerate like the texture\num so sometimes kids will be like you\nknow picky eaters and some people grow\nout of it but especially some people on\nthe autism spectrum\nseem to have like a lot of um arfid-like\nqualities\nthe one thing is every single patient\ni've had with arfid\nloves tendees it's like the one thing\nthat they can eat\nso like it does like you know it's not\nit seems to be like that attendees are\nwhat\npeople eat also every patient that i've\nhad with autism actually i don't know\nabout\nevery patient actually yeah that i can\nfairly say likes attendees too\nand and so we're really curious about\nwhether there's actually like a\na correlation between the prevalence of\narfid and and whether you\nhang out on 4chan so we're we're\nstudying and those are the kinds of\nstudies that unfortunately the nih isn't\nfunding\nyou know well it's unclear whether\nyou know it it serves humanity to know\nwhether the prevalence of rfid is\ngreater on 4chan or not\ni don't really know but it's a research\nquestion that we're fascinated in so\nwe're going to try to study it\ni love it okay and that should be a fun\nstudy to get results from i'm sure\nyou're going to get a meme out of it\nyeah so i think it's going to be all\nmemes like it means\nis one of the major outcomes of the\nstudy there's going to be like\nprevalence of arfid and production of\nmemes are going to be the two outcomes\nthat we look at\nbut anyway yeah i don't know where i was\ngoing with that\num i learned something i didn't know\nabout our fit and now i know that\nattendees are the go-to\nfor patients that are yep potentially\nstruggling with texture\nand yeah so f you know as an fm doc like\ni don't know you know how pediatric your\nyour population is but for picky eaters\nlike some of them may have actually\narfid fed\nso just kind of going back to so it\nsounds like you you did a seven-year\ncombined program\nand then um went into family medicine\nand can you tell me a little bit about\nlike social media and how that\nstarted for you because as i understand\nyou're huge\num it it happened in a weird way\nduring medical school i had an instagram\nprofile\nand i never had social media prior to\ninstagram but then when i was\nstudying for my boards actually i was\nstudying alongside my friend who was in\nnursing school\nstudying for his nclex and he was taking\npictures outside of the small library\nwindow of clouds\nand i'm like what are you doing like\nstop distracting me like you're taking\npictures i hear the flash\ni hear the clicking sound and he's like\nno dude there's this new app it's called\ninstagram where if you take a picture of\nthe sunset and you do hashtag sunset\nuh you'll get a bunch of likes and all\nthese people come visit your profile and\ni was like that sounds silly like you're\njust bored\nso later that day i come home i'm like\noh it's kind of a cool app let me try\nand i posted a picture of my siberian\nhusky at the time and\nthey got all these likes and one of the\nlikes stood out to me was from a\nprofessional\nlike i think alpine skier that i watched\nin the olympics\nthe prior olympics and i said wow look\nhow cool this is this app can bring\npeople together\nlet me like use this as sort of my blog\nif you will\nday-to-day activities put pictures on it\nthere was no stories at the time so\njust kind of like posting on there and\nwithout any real\ngoals but with the potential that it\ncould somewhat help my medical career in\nthe future whether it was for marketing\nconnections et cetera et cetera and i\ndid the entrepreneurial mindset\nexactly that i just thought like\nconnecting with people by the\nthousands is going to be beneficial in\none way or another and\nit also didn't hurt growing up i didn't\nget a lot of compliments or like female\nattention\nand now on social media i was probably\nin the best shape that i was at the time\ni was posting on social media i was\nreally into bodybuilding\ni was getting a lot of compliments there\nfor that i'm sure that played a role\nin continuing to to do that um\nand uh i was doing that for a while yep\nso sorry what role do you think that\nplayed\num positive dopamine hits continue to\ncome back\num there was definitely a point in time\nwhere it\naffected me in a way where i became like\narrogant with the fact that i had\nyou know 5 000 followers or something\nand my friends\nuh they are quick to humble me and\nthey pointed out that i was becoming\nthat person and i had to do some\nintrospection i actually deleted the app\nfor a while\nnot like my profile off the app but the\napp off my phone\nand really questioned why i was doing it\nwas there something unhealthy behind it\nand i definitely saw that i was\ntalking way too much about it all the\ntime and it became something that like\ni didn't like about myself that i was\nbecoming so i said okay i need to like\ntone down the amount of\ntime i'm talking about social media\nrealize that my value is not tied to the\nself-worth of how many followers i have\nthat if people like me it's because they\nlike me not because of the followers\nand i learned that lesson fairly early\non yeah\nbro you're fast forwarding past all the\ngood parts so like here's what i'm\nhearing like\nif it like like just think about this\nfor a second okay because like people\ngetting wrapped up in social media\npeople becoming arrogant\nas you said people becoming that person\nthere are a lot of those people out\nthere\nand if there's one thing that i think\nactually could be very educational for\npeople it's like\nnot everyone is able to do that right\nlike\nin fact it's i i'd love to ask you a few\nmore questions but if you know if you\nyeah no no that's fair game um i think\nmy sort of skill like i'm always kind of\nmaking fun of the fact that i'm not the\nsmartest person in the world and that\ni wasn't the top student in my class but\ni think where my skill lies in being\nintrospective and constantly\nreevaluating my actions and my thoughts\nso\nif you'd like to ask about that well\nyeah so so who would who did you become\nwhen you say you became that person what\nstarted to happen what does that person\nlook like\nyeah um it would basically be\nevery conversation that i had\nwas about the social media and my value\nranking system of the people in my life\nbecame about who had followers\nyeah i don't know if you're familiar\nwith black mirror or the tv show on\nnetflix\nyeah there was one episode where they\nkind of like rated each other a ranking\nsystem\nyeah and like no joke it was\neerily similar to what was becoming sort\nof in my mind to a degree where like\nif someone would talk to me i would feel\nperhaps above them because i had a\ncertain following and keep in mind i'm\n19 years old at the time so like\ni i'm still a student like i have no\nmoney i'm broke and this is the only\nthing where i had some value that i was\nlike oh my god\ni'm cool because of this and i realized\ni was tying all my self-worth to it and\neveryone else's self-worth to it\nbecause it was simple in that the\ndopamine hits came when likes came\nthat you could easily quantify like\npeople based on their numbers\nbut that's not reality because people\naren't just numbers so it was a\nfalse system but it was an easy system\nand yeah i just talked way too much\nabout it and i showed off way too much\nabout\nhow many likes my posts got or how many\nfollowers i had\nand i didn't like who i was becoming i\ndidn't like that i was doing that so\noften and\ni learned that lesson early on but\nthat's not to say that\ni didn't relearn that lesson over and\nover and over again\nlike even over the last year um\nnot so much that i was becoming arrogant\nbut over the last year\ni found myself again tying my happiness\nlevels or my fulfillment levels\nto numbers on social media and that's\nsomething i talk about not doing all the\ntime\nand yet i did it so often even this last\nyear\nso it's a constant process of learning\nand\ncan you tying things back to things that\nyou learned before\nthat that sounds like really really like\nhelpful to understand like\nbecause what i'm hearing is that you\nknow you kind of fell into that trap\nonce and you kind of worked your way\nthrough it\nyou know and then but at the same time\nyou can still fall into the trap again\nyeah for sure and it might be a slightly\ndifferent trap like it might be the\nnumbers again but\nnot so much with arrogance the next time\nbut with happiness\nor success or fulfillment what have you\nso\nthe trap is always there can you help me\nunderstand that and\nyou mentioned like over the last year\nlike what\nyeah so i have a cool probably one\nan example that you'll really relate to\nwell uh\nbeing in the field of psychiatry um the\nthe treadmill of hedonism where we\nconstantly are on this treadmill chasing\nextrinsic levels of happiness um so\nwhether it's money fame what have you\nuh is something i try and stay away from\nas much as possible i try and get\nfulfillment from my deep personal\nrelationships from the volunteer work\nthat i do my patients etc however\nyoutube specifically youtube\nis savagely\npushing the treadmill onto you and\ndoesn't let you leave the treadmill\nbecause youtube is this unique algorithm\nthat essentially is this evil personal\ntrainer\nthat doesn't let you get off the tread\nbill\nbecause when you create a piece of\ncontent that does well\nit doesn't allow you to celebrate that\nsuccess because the next video\nhas to either equate or even supersede\nthe success of the next one\notherwise the algorithm will just stop\nrecommending it\nand the feedback mechanism of what makes\nyou happy falls off very quickly\nso while in other platforms like if you\ndid well\nyou continue doing well youtube you're\neither growing or you're shrinking\nthere's no like in between\nand because of that you find yourself on\nthis treadmill all the time\nchasing success and you never really get\nto take a proper break\nunless you have a great understanding of\nhow all of this works psychologically\nand knowing yourself so\ni like to make the comparison between\ntraditional television and youtube in\nthis way\nand i'm borrowing part of this concept\nfrom a good friend of mine\nwho runs this channel called infographic\nshow he talks about\ndeserved views versus earned views\nand when we talk about like game of\nthrones if season one is a hit\neveryone will tune in to season two\nbecause it deserved those views\nyoutube is savage in that you could have\na great\n10 videos but if your 11th video\ngets a lower watch time or has a lower\nclick-through rate youtube doesn't care\nthat you crushed it on the last 10\nvideos\nyour views will just get destroyed in\nthe algorithm which is great for the\nviewer because the viewer is only\ngetting the top tier content\nbut as a creator you're constantly under\nthe gun\nbecause all of your views have to be\nearned none of them are deserved\nso good in the concept that the viewer\ngets the best content\ngood and that it's created a level\nplaying field that it doesn't matter if\nyou have one subscriber or a million\nsubscribers\nany piece of content can get recommended\nand get get viral success\nbad for the creator in terms of burnout\nbad for the creator that you\nnever really get a chance to disconnect\nor celebrate your successes\nunless you are really really organized\nand psychologically well understood\nindividual\ncan you that's blew my mind first of all\nthank you so much for sharing that and\ni'm i'm so curious like what what\nso what does that do to you right so you\ntalked about youtube\nyou talked about how you basically like\ncan't ever stop growing\notherwise you'll fall off and what does\nthat do\nto you how does that how does that\naffect\nfulfillment success things like that\nwell i've been doing youtube for\nprobably just over four years now\nand never missing a posting date\nyou want to continue that your growth\nwas really good you want to continue\nthat\ninadvertently you end up tying your\nself-worth to your subscriber count or\nyour view count\nor your growth count and as a result\nif that for whatever reason pauses fades\ndecreases it ultimately starts affecting\nyour mental health\nand unless you are in a very healthy\nhealthy psychological mindset\nlike i'm talking about where you can be\nin that buddhist state where you're like\neverything is transient even if\nsomething bad happens it won't be long\nand if anything good happens it won't be\nfor that long so i'll be happy here sad\nhere\nand i'm so balanced you're going to\nsuffer as a result\nand for me despite how balanced i come\noff or happy i come off in my posts and\nall of that\nthis last year was absolutely a struggle\nyou know pandemic has affected everybody\nto a degree\nbut watching sometimes content drop off\nor going through some difficult times in\nlife\nwatching the youtube channel suffer\naffected me way more than it should have\nand as a result i had to function in\nmuch the same way i did when i was 18 19\nyears old\nwhen i was becoming arrogant and tying\nmy self-worth to it back then\nand how how what how did that you kind\nof say you\ntalk about it like it's inevitable what\nlike what was your experience\nof so i'm i'm i'm just inferring here\nthat\nover the last year your youtube channel\ngrowth slowed down\nyeah well not only did it slow down but\nalso you know\nburnout is real like uh like i said\nyou don't get deserved views you get\nearned views\nand when you know you do that without\ntaking any breaks\nand that's essentially what i've been\ndoing for four years\nsaying like i will outlast i will\npersevere going through i can't you know\nmy dad's advice\num i i've been pushing really hard in\naddition to residency because\nall of this started towards the middle\nof my residency and i made sure to make\nthat a priority\nso never took a day off residency um to\ndo anything social media related\nso while finishing that also doing this\nat the same time it just it was such a\nlong process that it caught up with me\nin that\ni was like really getting\nburned out like the classical symptoms\nof burnout where you derive less joy\nfrom the things that once brought you\njoy\nsleep was messed up anxiety was high\nwhere i actually had to seek therapy\nthroughout the pandemic\nand i learned a lot you know i learned a\nlot going through them because it's\nsomething i advocate for my patients\nand now it was the time that i realized\ni do need help and i need to figure out\nwhat was going on\nand i think this was a cool takeaway\nthat i learned from therapy\nwhich is uh you're very familiar with\ncbt\ncognitive behavioral therapy you know\nattacking your irrational thoughts\nputting in a more rational thought to at\nleast decrease\nthe grasp or the depth of how sad you\nfeel or how depressed you feel\nand i would do that quite well for the\nlast 10 years or so i would say\nor at least well enough to help me\nmanage but over the last year what i\nfound was that i was doing the cbt on\nmyself so often\nthat i was reliving the negative\nexperiences over and over again\nwhere like you know if you watch a movie\na scary movie\nand like or an action movie your brain\non a functional mri\nlights up the same areas of your brain\nas if you were experiencing that pain or\nthat that fear\nso i was essentially doing that to my\nbrain over and over again by trying to\nforce cbt on myself\nand only when speaking to a mental\nhealth professional realized that\ni need to actually disconnect from that\nand i need to disconnect from social\nmedia\nand i need to not constantly be\nrefreshing\nmy feeds and that while they're going\nthrough i can't\ncould be a great coping mechanism and\nhiding or disconnecting\nlike disconnecting viewed as hiding\ncould be perceived as a negative coping\nmechanism if i'm not facing reality\nbut that wasn't what was happening i was\nfacing reality but i was doing it so\nmuch so\nthat it was actually having a negative\neffect so the coping mechanism of\nhot hiding or disconnecting was actually\na strong positive that i was missing out\non\nand that was something i learned that i\nwouldn't have learned had i not\nuh sought out help yeah that's\nthank you so much for sharing that mike\ncan i just kind of recap what i heard\nthere\nplease yeah so so it's interesting\nbecause you know when i when i listen to\nyou mike when i when i\nyou know what you give off is like\nunrivaled success right\nlike it's like you know you're it's it's\nthe immigrant story like\ngrowing up like you know this i mean\nyou're you're driven\nyou're focused you're caring um\nand you know like national oh yeah like\nlike\neven even the even the humility is so\namazing because you're like yeah like\nit's not like i was an olympic athlete i\nwas just\na national champion you know like nvd\nand and and so it's like because you\nseem to you know really succeed a lot\nman like you know like succeeding from a\nyoung age like\nseven year medical programs are not easy\nto get into they're\n[ __ ] way more competitive than md\nschools for sure\ni'm pretty sure about that i mean i i\nmean i actually don't know the\nstatistics but\nmy understanding of the accelerated you\nknow programs are that\nthey're hard to get into um\nand like like you said because they have\nlike a high drop-off rate right because\nit\nain't easy a lot of people drop out so\nthey're very selective with who they\ntake\nand then fm residency and then social\nmedia and it's kind of like whether you\nlike\nwhether it starts with offering to sell\ncorn\nand making a profit on pairs right\nyou find a way right you follow through\nor you you what did you say you work\nthrough i can't\nyeah and and so it's really interesting\nto see kind of\nwhat that mentality how it's helped you\na lot and also like\nit sounds like you've sort of paid a\nprice for never letting yourself\nsay i can't can't take a break\ngot to keep growing i can do this you\nknow like\nand and even the way you when you were\ntalking about cbt you said\nattack your rational thoughts and i was\nlike yeah that's\nthat's going to be a problem i mean i\nthink if we're talking about\nyou know balance in the mind and the\nbuddha state that you're talking about\nattacking your mind is\nnot how you get there you can absolutely\nsucceed\nit's how you can get success and this is\nwhat i've seen time and time again it's\nthat you know when people\nyou know really like\ndon't let themselves fail it's it's a\nvery brutal way of\nof living it's a very successful way of\nliving but it's\nit's brutal on the self um you know it's\nhard because yeah i don't think you're\nquite\nlistening to other parts of your body\nlistening to other parts of your mind\nbecause you're not going to be a quitter\nyou know that's not that's not who you\nare\num and so it was really fascinating to\nhear i i think i i\nfeel like i learned a lot and thank you\nso much for sharing that\nyeah i think any coping mechanism\nif it's successful in the beginning uh\nif you overuse it\nit's ultimately going to have drawbacks\nso you know this isn't a problem unique\nto me or unique to people who've had\nsuccess\ni think every human goes through\nsomething like this just in different\nways in different situations\njust for me i've always been like this\nenergized kind of person\npeople call me energizer bunny growing\nup my friend uh\nhere in new york he's like you're like a\ncockroach they can't kill you you just\nkeep going like you never get tired i\nwould work a 36 hour shift and i would\ngo play basketball with\nmy agent here in new york so like yeah\nlike i've always viewed that as a batch\nof honor or something that identified\nmyself as\nbut at the same time i need to be aware\nof the pitfalls\nof always being on or of always being\nsuper friendly and accessible even like\nright now\nso if i go outside in new york and let's\nsay i want to take my headphones and\nlisten to an audio book and chill out on\nthe grass on the west side highway\nwith my dog without a doubt now it's\ncome to the point that someone will come\nup\nand maybe ask for a picture which isn't\na big problem but\nwe'll want to get into a conversation\nand i want to talk to people i want to\nmeet people\nbut sometimes you just kind of want to\nbe by yourself and vibe out on a book\nand now i'm learning the reality of it\nnot that\nit's not a show-off thing people want to\ncome up and get to know you and talk to\nyou and they get excited and i would\nhave gotten excited if i was 18 and i\nwas meeting someone i was following\nso i understand it but now understanding\nthat i can't\nalways be available and i can't always\nbe super friendly or\njust say yes to everybody that is a\ncompletely foreign experience to me\nbecause i hate saying no i don't like\nsaying no\nbut for my own mental health i have to\nsometimes now set some boundaries which\ni've never set in my life before\nwell yeah sounds like it's a lesson you\nhad to learn the hard way\nit's not a hard way because there's way\nharder lessons learned uh\nin life for my patients from my friends\nthat i've seen\nuh you know struggle with serious\nserious problems and it's not to\ndownplay\nthe seriousness of my problem it's just\nthat's exactly what you're doing it's\nit's just\nthere's things that are cause real\nsuffering and\nthere's problems like each problem has a\nscale\nand i would say this is a true problem\nand it's truly affecting me\num but on levels of severity and how bad\nthings could get\ni know maybe this is my own coping\nmechanism at play\nand that's exactly what it is yeah well\ndone with the introspection there\nright because it's interesting how you\ninvalidate your suffering i think that's\nwhat got you to four years of burnout\nbecause i think that's actually mike\nlike i'm sorry if this is\ngoing off the rails in terms of what\nyou're okay with but like that's how you\nget\nburnt out right because you're there's a\nsignal in your mind\nand you've learned how to say like\nactually i am okay having boundaries but\nwhy did it take you four years\nit's because when you say like even now\nwhen you say to me like oh my god i\nsound like such an [ __ ]\nright like that's how it feels to be\nlike because you want to be a nice\nperson\nyou don't want to be that arrogant prick\nwho's big on social media and doesn't\nhave the time of day\nlike you recognize because you're a\nphysician that every human is a human\ndoesn't matter how many like\nfollowers you've got on social media\nlike you've got one heart you can get an\nmi i can get an m i we can both get\nstrokes we can all get cancer\nyou know i think medicine is great in\nterms of teaching you that all humans\nare equal\nand bizarrely i think that's what's\nactually trapping you\nright because not all humans i mean when\ni i just took a walk before we streamed\ntoday and i walked around for 15 minutes\ni've been recognized a total of four\ntimes on the street\nyou know and so that it's still fun at\nthat frequency it's like four times over\ntwo years is great\nmakes you feel good but i still get to\ntake walks\nyou know it's like it's something that\nmost human beings get to do\nand i'd be really careful with yourself\nbecause you know\nsure the suffering that other people go\nthrough is greater but like be careful\nthere\nbecause i think that's makes you a good\nphysician\nit's also going to burn you the [ __ ] out\nwhen it comes to social media\nno you're absolutely fundamentally in\nevery way right\num it's the reason why it's confusing\nis it's unnatural this type of\nnotoriety is not a natural human thing\nand it's not something even\nlike i guess like you could look to\ncelebrities in\ntraditional formats actors singers etc\nbut like really from medical\nprofessionals or regular people\nthere's not a lot of people i can go to\nfor advice especially in the beginning\nwhen i was starting all the social media\nthings so\ni'm kind of trailblazing in a weird way\nso that's why i'm always you know\nthere's people who are growing in the\nmedical space\ni keep my dms open to them again\nsometimes at my own peril\nwhere at midnight where i should be\nsleeping i'm having an hour conversation\nhelping a fellow medical influencer\nnavigate how to not get taken advantage\nby a brand\nso like i want to do that as much as\npossible so i'm trying to figure out how\nto manage all that\nbut it's a journey and i'm going to make\nmistakes and you know as long as i learn\ni feel like that's okay\nand by the way the comparison thing\nisn't also just looking at\nuh what other people are going through\nit's also things that i've gone through\nin life and\nyou know well i don't want to get too\nmuch into childhood stuff but like\nduring medical school\ni did lose my mom to medical uh to\ncancer\nand that was a very tough thing to not\nagain\nit was tough for me for sure but the\ntoughest part for me was watching how it\naffected my father\nwho did this whole process who\nyou know sacrificed so much of his life\nand was finally getting on his feet as a\ndoctor\nhim and my mom had all these plans\nwatching that break down\nthat hurt and you know leaving long\nisland where i was living on campus at\nthe time and moving back in with my dad\nthat presented all sorts of challenges\nand i saw how difficult that was\nso when i look through what i'm dealing\nthrough now dealing with now\nthere definitely is a layer of like an\nunderstanding of this is less serious\nthan that\nso it's not that i'm just saying oh\npeople have it harder so my broken bones\nshouldn't count\nit's i've experienced 10 broken bones\nand this one broken bone is probably not\nas bad\nyeah so what i'm hearing there is that\nthere's a healthy amount of\nperspective as opposed to invalidation\nyeah right like i don't want to say\nhealthy\nwhy wouldn't you say healthy well no it\nis a healthy mechanism but i wouldn't\nsay that this is perfect all the time\nlike i don't\nagain i don't want to give myself so\nmuch credit that i'm like oh all the\ntime i'm able to\nmake this healthy comparison between my\npast struggles and my current struggles\ni absolutely look at other people and\nsee\nthat they're struggling more than me and\ni invalidate my own experiences i do\nthat that's for sure\ni was just really confused why can't\nlike bro like why can't you give\nyourself credit for growing\nno no i i take the credit i just don't\nwant it to come off like i know\neverything because it's not true\nwhy okay i'll explain why it's important\num i think it's important because i want\npeople to see\nthat while i'm doing this job that you\nlabeled healthy and i appreciate that\nit's not always healthy i'm a lot of\ntimes am invalidating my feelings\nso while i do have this sense of healthy\nperspective and all that\ni also make a lot of these mistakes of\ncomparing myself and invalidating my\nfeelings\nso people can understand that if they do\nthat too they're not failures this is\nwhat everyone does including myself\ncan i just think for a second yeah sure\nyou're probably like this guy is crazy\nno on the contrary\ni think um you know so here's here's\nwhat i'm\ni'm seeing mike you're not crazy you're\nat the top of the bell curve and the\nproblem here is that\nwhich i think which and apologies\nbecause i kind of think of you as a\ncolleague but what i'm going to say now\nmay come across\nas like i know better than you but um\nyou know i think\nwe each have our respective areas of of\nspecialty\nso i think you got to be careful because\nlike\ni don't know what how do i say this\nthere's just something about how hard\nyou try to consider\nother people right so like you think so\nmuch about how what you're saying is\nbeing perceived which\nmay be like related to social media but\ni don't think i think that would be a\nlittle bit unfair i think it's just\nlike you you want people to understand\nthat it's okay to fail you want people\nto understand that like you struggle too\nand that's not you could you could say\nthat there's a piece of that that's like\noh like\nimage conscious right like in and you\ndon't want to come across as arrogant\nthere may be a piece of that but i'm\ngetting a lot of genuine like\nyou care about sending the right\nmessages to people\nand not propagating actually like a lot\nof the\nmessages that social media seems to\nproject which is that there are\nthe chads right the taekwondo champions\nsoccer captains seven year medical\nschool program\npeople on youtubers like you're all of\nthose things and then they're like\nthe normal people over here and so i i\nthink it's it's very clear to me that\nyou're trying to\nshare that you're not actually any\ndifferent right that it's the\nintrospection it's the work it's the\neffort and that's what you really want\npeople to come away with\nget that but there's a subtle thing\nthere which is like you're caring so\nmuch about other people like what about\nyou\nyeah that's the the way that i would\nfirst of all 100 accurate so very well\ndone reading me and\nclearly you're a specialist and a\nprofessional in this space\nno surprise there um for me i sum it up\nin this\ni become very good at being comfortable\nwith being uncomfortable\ni'm [ __ ] at being comfortable with being\ncomfortable\nso part of that from\nall of that is essentially how you\nexplained it so\nyes there's a layer of i don't want to\ncome off arrogant and there's like a\nbrand\nimage conscious thing that i'm doing but\nalso it's because i\nmy ultimate mission and why i'm doing\nsocial media and where i derive my\nintrinsic value\nis by putting out the accurate message\nand especially to help people\nwho are truly suffering with things that\nare confused and want good information\nso\nyeah hmm\nare you happy mike yeah\ni'm fulfilled oh man there's such a did\nyou see that show i'm such a tv geek and\nmovie geek\ni relate everything back to shows i\ndon't know if i've watched too much tv\nin my life but\nthere's a show called magic city um tell\nme about it\nthe worst show that i'm like using as an\nexample for such a high-level\nconversation about mental health but\nit's a show about gangsters uh starting\nup\ngambling from cuba in florida and\nthey're trying to get it passed and all\nthat\nbut they asked one of the mobsters like\nare you happy\nand he says howdy duties happy i'm\ncontent\nand i don't know why that line stuck\nwith me but instead of content i think\ni'm fulfilled\nwhat is this so help me understand what\nfulfillment is\nuh fulfillment is i like to think of it\nin a situation\nso if today is my last day on earth do i\nfeel like i've accomplished everything i\ncould have until this point and am i am\ni satisfied\nand the answer is yes and i feel like if\ni could be in that mental state\nas much as i can in my life i'm happy\nlike that that's how i\nsort of grade it so fulfillment is about\naccomplishment before you die\nsatisfaction with what you have\naccomplished and when i say accomplished\ni really mean it in a holistic way in an\nosteopathic way if you will\ngood relationships with my family good\nrelationships with my friends\nbeing an ethical and moral person\nhelping the world while having success\non my own right\nthat's how i think of accomplishments as\nopposed to you know seven million\nfollowers or whatever it is\ncan i think for a second how we doing on\ntime by the way i don't know so we\nusually run for about two hours at a\nstretch i think that's like the\nbandwidth that i have but\nand we're coming up on an hour and a\nhalf um\ni'm good i'm used to uh long\ninteractions with my patients so\num\nso fulfillment is happiness\nyeah i mean like it's are we looking for\nuh an oxford definition of happiness\nand the funny thing is i love the field\nof positive psychology so\nuh martin seligman um i'm gonna butcher\nhis name\nme highly checker the the author of the\nbook flow i think\nkick set me highly i think is how you\npronounce it but\nnot even gonna try because it's so bad\non my part if i ever\nend up i probably bless you i apologize\nso\ni've i've read a lot of these authors\nand i've tried to figure out what\nhappiness means and i don't know like\nyou know martin selig's whole thing is\nflourish instead of happiness he changed\nthe term\nin his books for me i think\nhappiness is fulfillment i think\nhappiness is also probably more accurate\nas a state of mind in a single moment\nas opposed to like is your life\nhappiness\nlike i don't think you can say that i\nthink happiness is like how you feel in\nthis given moment one to ten bull\nand right now i can be happy because\nwe're having a very fulfilling\nconversation\nbut if i stub my toe in 10 minutes and\nyou ask me then i'm not going to be so\nhappy\nso i think happiness is like a point of\ntime reference where fulfillment is\nsort of a more grand scheme adjective\nor now yeah so i i'm not i'm not so sure\ni agree with you there\ni love it please share with me why so\nhere's here's what i'm hearing okay\nwhat i'm hearing is that you're not sure\nwhat happiness is so\nyour mind has figured out in an almost\nlike a rational way like you've asked\nlike not\ni don't want to make it sound\nintellectual i think it's a little bit\nmore philosophical or spiritual in\nnature\nyou're like what is the nature of\nhappiness and when you kind of looked at\nlike here's what i'm imagining okay like\nyou kind of looked at your life and you\nwere like\nyou know because i think even the way\nthat you define fulfillment\ncomes with the construction of if i died\ntoday\nwould i have regrets could i be proud of\nwhat i've accomplished\nright could i be proud of the life that\ni've built\nlike i'm on this earth i've been given\ncertain challenges i've been give\ngiven certain privileges did i do a good\njob and if the answer to that question\nis yes\nthen you feel fulfilled is that fair\nyes with just the small stipulation that\nyes\nis not a binary answer it's kind of like\na percentage if you will of how much yes\nyeah absolutely right so like there are\nthese certain things that you can say\nlike\nyou know did mike like do a good job did\nhe leave the world a better place\nand like you know then he left it and i\ntotally get that but i think it's\nit's a it's a little bit of a\nphilosophical answer\nand then it's interesting because then\non the flip side you also talk about an\nexperiential answer\nright which is that in a particular\nmoment i can have\na particular state of mind my\nsympathetic and parasympathetic nervous\nsystem or like in a right kind of\nbalance\nyou know i'm in a state of eustress like\nin kind of a flow straight state where\nit's not\nboring but it's also not overly\nstressful and\ni can feel like a temporary moment of\nhappiness\nbut that that happiness is transient by\nnature\nso when you talk about the buddha when\nyou did this thing over here right\nso like when you talk about that it\nsounds to me like\nthat's really the one thing that you\nsort of don't\nquite haven't grasped fully yet like\nyou're aware that it's possible\nyou know that people kind of do it i'm\nnot saying that you haven't grown and\nyou haven't\nlearned how to carve out balance in your\nlife\nbut it feels like like mike everything\nyou do is so damn effortful\nyou work so hard at it it's funny you're\nsaying the exact\nopposite of what like the attendings who\nhave trained me say\nthey say mike always takes the path of\nleast resistance he works smarter not\nharder\nit's like the exact opposite of the\nfeedback i've been giving my whole life\nso it's interesting that you say that\nyeah so that means on the one hand maybe\ni'm completely wrong\nright because if it's if it's completely\ncontrary there's there's truth to both\nsides as always\nand and no no well maybe i'm just wrong\nright i just could be talking about you\nbecause you're not wrong you're not\nwrong in the sense of like\nbut i sometimes feel that on an unfair\ncharacterization of my work when\nlike i remember my ex-girlfriend's\nfather said something like oh mike's\nreally smart like\nhe figured out a way to not work so many\nhours in the hospital\ngreat i'm like are you insane like do\nyou know how many hours i work on social\nmedia and how stressful this is and all\nthis\nyeah sometimes i do feel like it's an\nunfair characterization\nbut at other times i agree with it i\nmean so here's like even when it comes\nto\nhappiness like you talk about being\nintrospective you've worked at happiness\nwell it's not like it's not like work\nsounds tedious\ni enjoyed what i was doing i forgot how\neffortful\neffortful you exerted effort right\nthat's like i'm noticing that you\nthought about it\nyou know i'm not saying it's bad like\ni'm not saying it's not enjoyable but\nlike there was energy expended let's put\nit that way\nagreed and and so i think that there's\nactually something\nin between those two states so on the\none hand there's like\nthe construction of can i be proud of my\nlife\nand then on the other hand there's the\nvariant emotion of like transients\nmaybe it's not quite emotion i think\nit's a little bit more than that but i\nthink that if you if you really pay\nattention to buddhism and what that\nsort of being content is like when you\ntalk about\nbeing psychologically like let's say\ngrounded to the point or\nyeah like you know tethered enough to\nwhere the fluctuations of social media\nwhich from a dopamine perspective\nneuroscience perspective they're going\nto knock you off track right it's the\nequivalent of sailing in stormy seas\nfor your ego and your sense of like\nhappiness like that's just what it is\nthat's what social media does\nthat's why it's so successful because\nthey figured out how to like flip all\nthese switches in our brain\nthat you know make us creating content\nand never quitting and giving a\nwonderful experience to the user at the\nsacrifice to ourself\nand so i think finding that place of\nbuddha is actually there's something in\nbetween which is actually a space of\ndetachment\nwhere it's sort of like i know it sounds\nkind of weird but like you know\nacknowledging realism nope\nnot nihilism detachment and so this is\nwhere\nyou know and i think it kind of comes\nback to like when and i i think you will\nprobably understand this actually\nso when you make some youtube content i\nthink there are a lot of different\ndrivers in your mind one is like the\nentrepreneurial like how do i make\nsuccessful content\nand then there are times though that i\nthink that you probably put out a piece\nof con\nor you've got conflicting things okay so\nthere's a tension between\nwhat would be successful and like what\nfeels spiritually\nor holistically like the right kind of\ncontent there's some balance between\nthat\nand and so i think if you think about\nthe spiritually\nthe when you lean towards the holistic\ncontent\nwhat you actually have to do is like\ndetach\nfrom the consequences of what's gonna\nhappen with the content\nwhen you make a piece of content you're\nlike this may not do very well but i'm\njust gonna let that go\nif it doesn't do so well it's actually\nnot that big of a deal\nlike i acknowledge it's gonna do well\ni'm not gonna get bent out of shape that\nit's not gonna\nthat it's gonna do well but i'm gonna do\nthis because it's like\naligned with my values and it's like\nwhat i want to do does that make sense\nabsolutely and if i could just\nlike from here not to ruin your train of\nthought really quickly\nthrow in here i think about that\na lot and i think about from a practical\nperspective\nwhat it would mean if i would switch and\njust go\nto making the content that pleases the\nsoul if you will\nand i also think about how on a\npractical sense what it means to survive\nwhat it means to you know be financially\nwell off to be able to help others\nand do all these things and i think\nabout the value that comes from perhaps\nmaking\nuh like a memes video that may be on\nmemes 28\ni'm not so excited to do memes 29 but i\nknow that it'll bring in a ton of\nviewers that will watch the meaningful\ncontent that will then enrich their\nlives\nso i think all these things are kind of\ni think content creators struggle with\nthis a lot\nbut here's the interesting thing if you\nmade content for the soul i think you'd\nbe unhappy\ninteresting okay so because here's the\nimportant thing\nit's not choosing content for the soul\nor choosing content for success it is\nthe detachment from the decision that is\nthe source of happiness\ni don't know if that makes sense but\nlike when you make content for the soul\nit's not making content for the soul\nthat is actually the source of happiness\nit's the internal process\nthat you go through to let go of the\nsuccessful content that is the source of\nhappiness\nis that true does that like is it\npossible\nlike i agree that that could be the case\ncould it also be the case\nthat there is a source of happiness that\nit's you enjoy doing that for the soul\nnot just deciding not to do the other\nthing\nuh i know this is gonna sound weird\nright it's gonna sound really weird what\ni'm about to say\nno so this is where and then this is\nwhere we have to be really careful right\nbecause i'm talking about\nhappiness as if it's true so what i'm\ngoing to say like so let me qualify\nthat's\nthat statement okay so i think this is\nthe problem is because people like\ndo what they love right like and they\nthink that that's the source of\nhappiness that's not that's not how it\nworks\ni think bizarrely happiness is actually\na relatively simple thing that\ni think would like there's a reason we\nkind of quote him right\nbecause i think he figured it out and\nthe reason that\na religion cropped up around him is\nbecause he actually like\nactually figured it out in sort of a\nscientific way\nthat what is the nature of happiness and\nthe nature of happiness is actually\ndetachment\nand and you know if you kind of think a\nlittle bit about why was it so hard for\nyour dad when your mom passed away\nit's because he was so attached to all\nof the things that they were going to do\nright like and so it's kind of\ninteresting but if you think about you\nknow\ni know it sounds kind of weird but like\nthe more you get tangled up with\nsomething and i think you probably\nunderstand this too because\nit sounds like you've gone through the\nprocess of disentangling yourself\nfrom your social media identity like\nover and over again\nand so if we really think about it each\nof those times if you look for a common\nthread\ni think what you're gonna see is that\nyou got caught up in it right like who\nmike was mike wasn't over here\nmike got taken over by dr mike and the\nmore that you get entangled with dr mike\nyou can be successful actually in both\nsituations but one of them is going to\ncome with suffering and one of them is\ngoing to come without suffering\ndoes that make sense yes\nmy pushback or question would be\nfirst of all i would say i would venture\nto say that there's probably not one\nright way to live life like there's like\nwho is the ultimate judge of what\nhappiness is if someone finds happiness\nin\nnot following a buddhist mentality they\ncould be doing the right thing for them\nright so like i try not to judge other\npeople's definition of happiness\num when it comes to\nattaching yourself to something and then\nfeeling tremendous sense of loss\nlike you mentioned with my father i\nthis is not based on any on any evidence\nbut perhaps\nthere is a layer of beauty in that that\nis happiness\nthat is not defined by neurotransmitters\nor\nnumbers on a happiness rating scale yeah\nabsolutely this is why detachment is\nseparate from the axis of emotion\nright so like appreciating like you're\n100 right and i think it's sort of like\nis not actually i don't take that as\npushback\ni think that point is actually exactly\nwhat i'm trying to say\nit's the distance from the thing the\nloss you can feel sadness\nand you can still find contentment and\nhappiness in sadness which is weird\nso this is the axis that buddha was\ntalking about which is sort of like if\nwe think about watching sad movies right\nso your\nmovie buff so if we think about the\nexperience of movies like have you seen\nparasite\nyes okay so like no spoilers but like\nparasite is an emotional roller coaster\nand the emotions that you feel are\nlargely negative\nlike they're not in the positive valence\nyou know it's not you know a story of\nyou know puppies and siberian huskies\nand things like that it's like\nit's emotionally brutal and yet\nwhy do we enjoy it because the axis of\npositive and negative emotion is is\nseparated\nonce we have that detachment to a\ncertain degree right right like\nbut yeah go you wanted to say something\nabout why it was no it's going to answer\nyour question of\nlike to me why we feel sadness watching\nparasite\nis the same reason we feel happy sorry\nthe reason we feel happiness after\nwatching parasite despite it being a sad\nmovie\nis the same reason we feel happiness\nafter eating an incredibly\nspicy pepper it's like you had this\npotential threat\nso the capsaicin attaches to your\nreceptors\nyou feel this pain the pain goes away\nyou realize\nthere was no damage endorphin rush\ncombined with surviving\nthis painful experience brings you\nhappiness\nthat's interesting so parasite\nyour brain functional mri is going off\nand experiencing all these negative\nthings\nthe movie ends you realize you didn't go\nthrough this horrible situation\nand you feel better i also relate this\nto\naddiction with gambling you lose all of\nyour money\nyou've mortgaged your house you've lost\nall this stuff\nafter you lose you realize you're still\nalive\nand life goes on you get an endorphin\nrush and that is why frequently people\nare addicted to gambling\nand actually addicted to losing because\nthere's such a rush in losing and yet\nstill surviving\ncorrect me if i run on that i'm gonna\nhave to think about that let me\nsee if you've tumbled down the entire\nfoundation of how i understand this\nstuff\ngive me a second\ni don't think so so here's here's what\ni'll say\nokay so i think what you've done a\nbeautiful job of doing is\nillustrating the mechanism of like\nrebound relief you know so there's an\ninteresting experiment i can't\nthink of the reference right off the top\nof my head but i know i've got it\nsitting on my google drive\nso they took they took like you know 100\npeople\nand they had them put their hand in cold\nwater and like the water was of\ndifferent temperatures so like it was\nlike painfully cold and then like even\nmore painfully cold\nbut the experiment that they looked at\nwas that you know it\nif you have the most painful experience\nlike painfully cold water and they start\nto warm it up at the end\nand even though they never get to the\nwarm uh like\nthey never reach like the the less cold\nwater\npeople will rate that second experience\nas more favorable than\nabsolutely being in warmer water so i\nthink there's\nabsolutely a principle that you're\ntapping into which is like a\nneuroscience mechanism\nthrough which the relief of a negative\nexperience can be like reinforcing in\nsome way\nwith you i think that's very good point\nfrom a neuroscience perspective\ni still think though that that is a\nmechanistic\nneuroscientific thing that doesn't quite\ntranslate if anything maybe i gave the\nwrong example\nbut i think what i'm kind of talking\nabout is actually like a state of\nconsciousness or a state of mind it's a\nperspective\nthat i think we can all experience that\nessentially when we look at like the\nthe karmic religions they talk about\nsomething called enlightenment\nwhich is a state of persistent happiness\nit's actually they don't use the word\nhappiness they use the word bliss\nand so if you think about this\nexperience that has been described by\npeople like over and over and over again\nthere has been something of a scientific\nstudy and this is where you kind of say\ni try not to judge\nand that's where i kind of say well like\ni don't know if i really agree with that\nbecause\nas a scientist i do believe\nas a scientist a psychiatrist and\nstudying some neuroscience\ni do believe that happiness is while\nthere is an individual determination and\nevery person's life is different\ni do think as a scientist that if you\nstudy a hundred happy people\na hundred sad people that you will find\ncommon elements that lead to this\nexperience that human beings have\nand i think that like buddhism is\nessentially i mean it's a religion\nsure but it's essentially like a group\nof people who sat down\nand like studied the science of\nhappiness in a personal and individual\nway\nand it's been my experience that when\nwhen i work with people that teaching\nthem this\nlike i don't think that i have had a\nsingle person\nwho has not arrived at the same\nconclusion if they have done the work\ndo you think that's that selection bias\nat play like that they did the work\nso we've pre-selected the people that\nare going to do the work so these are\nthe people that are going to get the\nbenefit\nabsolutely it do i think it's selection\nbias at play\nno is it possible it's selection bias\nabsolutely\nright so like this is where i would like\nso let's let's you know let's think\nabout it\nyou know if i give someone antibiotics\nfor\nlet's not use strep throat let's say\npneumonia right\nis it selection bias at play that the\nlike could selection bias\nbe at play it's studying the efficacy of\nour antibiotics for pneumonia\nof much lower likelihood because it's\nrandomized\nand right behind it absolutely right so\nlike like it's much lower likelihood but\nyou know i would also argue that you\nknow it's unclear because we haven't\ndone well actually we sort of\nhold on let me think about how to\nrespond to this\nso as an individual practitioner by\ndefinition\ni'm going to have a lot more selection\nbias than any rct\nat the same time i think that you could\nargue that a religious tradition has\nselection bias to it\nbut i think it's really tricky because\nwhen you have a sustainable\nanswer that generations of people have\nfound have been like successful\nit's hard for me to tease apart what\npart of that is selection bias\nand what part of that is like an\nactually correct\ntreatment it's like you're saying\ni was gonna say like if you let's say\nyou have a cure\nfor pneumonia like 100 cure but the\ncompliance rate is only 5\nwith this treatment is that a successful\ntreatment\nyeah how would you define it yeah so i\nwould call that a successful treatment\nright the problem is in the compliance i\nwould\nas a family medicine doctor i'm with you\nand i think that's fair because i think\nyou have to bake in compliance but this\nis where so also as like you know as a\npsychiatrist\ni i mean i i'm with you i i completely\nunderstand i still remember in my first\npharmacology lecture\nthey were like any monkey can prescribe\nblood pressure medication\nit takes a doctor to get a patient to\ntake it\nwhen they have to wake up twice in the\nmiddle of the night to go pee\nthat's the job the real doctor's job of\na doctor is compliance\nand this is also where like if you think\nabout as a psychiatrist i get that as a\nfm doc but like if you think about\nwhat do i treat what i treat is the\ncompliance issue\ni don't treat them you know like 90 i'm\nan addiction psychiatrist\nall you know my treatment is focused on\ncompliance\nso if we think about you know meditation\nis an effective treatment like is\nmeditation and effective\ntreatment to reduce negative symptoms of\nschizophrenia\nyes is it hard to get people\nto meditate is it an effective holistic\nintervention\npossibly not but if we look at the\nactual treatment\ndoes it work yes and i'm with you that\nthat an intervention and this is where\nmaybe i'd qualify a little bit\nthat the interventional intervention\nglobally may not be effective if it only\nhas a five percent compliance rate\nbut is the is is the tree well you know\ni'd so i'd separate out those two things\nand i'd say that that's where like\n90 of the work that i do is getting\npeople to be compliant\nyeah like for me we have such great\nevidence behind\nyou know behavioral therapy uh it\nworking sometimes as well\nuh as anti-depressant medications\nusually\nrest in tandem obviously when you look\nat the evidence\nbut let's think about it from my\nperspective as a family medicine doctor\ni have a patient who comes in and is\nexperiencing depressive symptoms and i\ndiagnose them with major depressive\ndisorder\na lot of my patients suffer with low\nmotivation levels they struggle to\nshower to get out of bed\nto go to work to take care of their\nfamily to enjoy things that once brought\nthem pleasure\nalthough what you see on a commercial\nfor pharma ad\nand these patients are suffering i then\ngive them a referral to see you or a\npsychologist and now they have to be\nmotivated enough to call the number on\nthe back of their insurance\nget five providers one who's no longer\ntaking new patients one who's no longer\nin network one who has a six month\nwaiting period\nand we we then say these individuals\nwho end up finding this care do well\nhow do we study the people that have\nnever even got in\nand i don't know maybe they would have\nhad the same impact as the people who\ngot in\nbut to me when i look at the individuals\nthat i help\na lot of times i'm only helping the\npeople who actually end up getting the\nmotivation to go for these treatments\nso how do we sort of merge those two\ngroups\nyeah so this is where i think this\nconversation is changing a little bit\nwhich i love\nso this is where like i'm a big fan of\nlike meeting people where\nthey're at so i think the biggest\nproblem in medicine what you're the\nproblem you're describing and if we talk\nabout\nif a treatment works a hundred percent\nof the time but only five percent of\npeople\ndo it i think that's the problem that\nneeds to be fixed\nright so the question is like and this\nis the problem with the rct\nbecause like this is this is why like i\nknow that in western medicine the rct is\nthe gold standard treatment i think it's\na terrible standard of treatment\ni think it's the fact that the rct is\nthe gold standard\nof what we use in medicine creates these\nproblems\nbecause the whole point behind an rct\nwhich is a randomized controlled trial\nis that it removes all of the\nlike real world or the real world from\nthe equation well so when you test\nversus effectiveness right so so this is\nwhere like in psychiatry we\nthere's actually a couple of really\ngreat studies that are naturalistic\nstudies\nso what they did is they followed\npatients over time\nand like put them on certain medications\nand they actually\nfactored in like if this medication has\nthis side effect\nwhat's the likelihood that the person\nwill stop taking it\nand so i personally i've found the\nnaturalistic studies to actually be\nsuperior to rcts in this way because it\nmirrors a real world thing where we're\nfollowing patients\nwe're giving them something like\nclozapine right and then like sure it's\nthe most effective drug for like\nschizophrenia\nbut it also causes people to like drool\nconstantly\nand gain 200 pounds and so how effective\nis it\nin in the real world like i think that's\na better way to study it and this is\nwhere i think if we want to solve that\nproblem like that's sort of why we you\nknow a lot of people like will criticize\nus and i think that\ncriticism is fair that we offer like\nmental health support services at\nhealthy gamer like we help parents and\nwe help people but we do it as coaching\ninstead of therapy\nand what's part of the reason for that\nit's because there are so many barriers\nand like we actually try to meet people\nwhere they're\nat which is i think how you fix it right\nso you're right that the 95\ncompliance issue is the big problem so\nhow do you fix that\ni think it's like stepping away from the\nrct\nthe reason i brought it up even to bring\nus back to the previous conversation the\ntie-in that i saw\nwas we're talking about this very\ndifficult to grasp concept for most\nmyself included\nof being detached but not detached\nemotionally as you described in the\nbuddhist model\nhow do we get there in a way that is\ncompatible\nand practical with our current everyday\nlife when we are not living\non a mountaintop without distractions\nwithout this thing constantly going off\ngreat great question and so this is\nwhere the answer is going to be weird\nand you're 100 right it's actually not\ncompatible\nyou can't actually do both okay so this\nis this is this is the story of buddha\nright so like\nbuddha was a prince and he was wealthy\nand powerful and all this other crap and\nhe was unhappy\nand then like in his journey he first\nlike he just\npeaced out like he left his wife left\nhis infant son\nand just went on this journey of\nself-fulfillment and then like\ndecades later he's he's going back\nthrough his his capital city former\ncapital city because he gave up his\nkingdom\nhe's walking down the street and he sees\nhis wife and his kid\nand his wife lets him have it she's like\nyou piece of [ __ ]\nyou abandoned us you left you have a\nresponsibility to your child\nyou gave it all up you suck at life and\nshe's right\nright and then so he says you know\nyou're right i do have a responsibility\nit's my job to pass on what i understand\nto my child\nso he shows his wife his bagging bowl\nand she's he's like let me make\nup for it you've had him for 20 years\ni'll take him for the next 20 years\nwe'll wander around india i'll have my\nbegging bowl and i'll teach him\neverything that that i i'll do my\nfather's duty and she's like uh-uh\nno no you crazy he's a prince there's no\nway i would let him\nfollow around your broke ass the first\nthing though it's it's interesting mike\nbecause you're right it's not actually\ncompatible\nif we really talk about true\nenlightenment it's not in a sense\ncompatible with regular life if\nyou are if you are measuring by the\nlevel of accomplishment of regular life\nso for example if you were enlightened\nwould you be as successful of a youtuber\nas you\nare jury's still out\ntheoretically i think you can make a\nstrong case and i won't argue against\nyou that the answer is going to be no\nin my experience so and this is where\nthings get really down the rabbit hole\nis that the more personally detached\ni've become the more\ni realized so i was planning on becoming\na monk like i studied to become a monk\nfor a few years\nand then decided to not do that\nand then ultimately realize that like\nbeing a monk is not about living on a\nmountaintop it's like all\ninternal and so whether i'm married or\nnot married or\nyou know whether i enjoy you know like\nsoda i like it's all the work is\nentirely internal and there i've i've\nfound really promising results\nthat you can learn to be detached and\nbecause mike i think you've done it dude\nyou've\ndis-intake like you've been wrapped up\nin it right and as you disentangle\nyourself the really bizarre thing is\nthat i think you will actually become\nmore successful\nbecause these things as you become aware\nand detached like this is where i\ngot to say this to you like i think it's\namazing that you're\nyou identify as a person who's got to\nwork through can't\nand it's responsible for so much of your\nsuccess\nand it's become maladaptive the higher\nyou go that which is adaptive\nstarts to become maladaptive which is a\nbeautiful lesson that you've learned\nand so like if we really kind of think\nabout it like\nas you start to detach i think you'll\nactually become more successful because\ni think\nsome of those ways that you view\nyourself you say to yourself\ni am not going to be some i'm not going\nto let my dad down like he taught me\nthese\nreally important lessons he taught me\nall these things and that's who i\nam and the higher you go the more that's\ngoing to cause you problems\nand bizarrely like those helped you they\nhelped you become a national taekwondo\nchampion\nthey helped you become one of the most\nsuccessful medical influencers\nin the history of medical influencers\nand at the same time the next step\nup is actually like pulling away from\nsome of those things\nand as you become detached i think i\nknow it sounds weird and then you ask\nthe question you asked me a question\nwhich is\nhow do you do that and there are ways so\nwe can go into that but i want to\ni want to give you a chance the\nmysterious ways\nno they're not they're not that\nmysterious it's just i i wanted to pause\nfor a second give you a chance to\nrespond\nyou know disagree no agree and i think\nthis we're coming to this similar\nconclusion that i did when i was doing\nmy therapy\nwhich is you know you call detached she\ncalled a disconnect\nit's all aiming towards the same\nprinciple uh you know we get caught up\nin nomenclature in science probably too\noften\num so i completely agree and i think\ni've already seen the benefits of doing\ntherapy and disconnecting some and\nwatching a video underperform and not\nhave it affect me negatively be like oh\nyeah that sucks but let's figure out the\nnext one or\nwhat what's my take away from this so\nthat we can learn from it\nso yeah i absolutely think that that is\nthe case\num to me thinking it in a bigger picture\nsense like\nthe concept of mindfulness or like\nmeditation\ni've tried with a like me being a person\nwho's\ntried a lot and accomplished a lot the\nfailure i have with mindfulness\nand like sitting and breathing and doing\nthis\nis like insane like how much failure\ni've had with it\nso it's not to say that no one can do it\nit's just to say as someone who's i\nconsider myself a dedicated person\ni cannot for the life of me do this i\nstart wondering is this a practical\nsolution for most people\nthe answer is absolutely yes so let me\nask you a question\nright so you are are you working like uh\ndo you work in an academic setting or\nlike community setting\nlike you guys are residents and stuff\nrotating yes so like i have i'm in a\ncommunity health center but i work with\nresidents\ni actually have a resident shadowing me\nright now for this perfect youtube\nchannel so if we think about it like if\nyou have a dedicated student\nwho's smart driven focused and they're\nnot learning medicine\nwhere's the problem\nmaybe they don't want to learn medicine\nno they do want to learn medicine\nthey're trying really hard\nyou know it's kind of weird medicine's\nnot for them no medicine could be for\nthat's what they would think right\nthat's exactly what the person would\nthink and that's exactly what you think\nabout mindfulness\nit's not for me that's what i'm hearing\nfrom you so i'm with you there\nbut the fault is with the teacher\nso if you've got all the right stuff\nright you're driven you're focused\nyou're dedicated\nlike whose fault is it it's the\nattending's fault if they're not\nlearning medicine\nand so this is where like i turn to you\nand i'd say i completely get where\nyou're coming from because this is what\ni hear\ntime and time and time again i suck at\nmeditation meditation's not for me and\nthat's where i'd say like\nhow qualified are your teachers\nhow did you try to learn yeah i've self\ntried to self learn well there you go\nright so like\nmeditation is something that\ntraditionally has been taught\nby very qualified teachers and so i\ndon't think you're bad at meditation i i\ngotta say this mike and this could\ncould also be a selection bias like\n95 of people who i teach meditation to\nfirst of all half i'm successful in\nteaching meditation\nto 95 of people that i work with half of\nthem feel like meditation is not\nfor them the first time they come into\nmy office and the reason\nis because they don't have good teachers\nand the reason is because we have a\npropagation of meditation resources\nwithout meditation teachers the reason\nis because people meditation\nteachers are taught in one tradition\nright so like how do you become a\ncertified meditation teacher\nyou go to a particular person you learn\ntheir particular branch of meditation\nand then they are the their any to any\nstudent comes to them they say\nthis is the the way to meditate and if a\nteacher says this is the way to meditate\nand it's not suited to your cognitive\nfingerprint\nthen the student walks away thinking i\nsuck at meditation\nand meditation is not for me because\nlook at this like\nyou know tibetan monk\nwho's like an expert on meditation if\nthey're such a good teacher\nthat like people don't acknowledge that\nthere are different traditions of\nmeditation it's sort of like if we force\nyou to become a surgeon\nyou would think that you were bad at\nmedicine but the whole point is that\nlike\nyou're an fm doc through and through\nright and so like becoming a successful\ndoctor\nhas to do with the tradition that you're\ntrained in in the tradition that you\npractice within\nas opposed to like you know you're not a\nbad doctor it's just if we force you to\nbecome a surgeon\nlike does that make sense\nit does um the question that i have\nis um if we like for example\nmaybe not me let's say i have a friend\nhe's five foot one\nand he he wants to play basketball and\nby your methods any teacher a a good\nteacher would be able to teach him how\nto play basketball very\nwell but genetically he's slow he's\nclumsy\nhe can't play on a even moderately\ncompetitive level no matter how great\nthe teacher is that's\nphysical limitation yep\nfor me i feel like when i uh practice\nmeditation\ni can pick up on it and i've gotten some\nbenefit from it absolutely i see it\nbut maybe i'm not the one that's going\nto be the collegiate meditator\ndoes that absolutely absolutely so but\nbut listen the five\nthe five foot one guy can learn how to\nplay basketball hundred percent can\nlearn how to play basketball\nhe may never be in the decide what to do\nwith it right so like but i feel like\ni've learned what meditation is\nhow to sort of do it but then like it\ndidn't give me enough value to continue\ndoing it is that without visible\nabsolutely right so it may not be for\nyou like you can teach a five foot one\nperson how to play basketball you can\n100 do that\ni'm not saying they're gonna enjoy it\ni'm not saying they're gonna play in the\nmba\nand enlightenment of buddhism like to\nhave meditation and mindfulness part of\nit is that intertwined with it\nsort of the solution no sort of\nbut let's think about a couple of\ndistinctions in the analogy\nthe goal of teaching you meditation is\nnot to get you to play in the nba\nenlightenment is not for everyone not\neveryone is temperamentally\nappropriate to it so when i work with\nsomeone who's got down syndrome\nand i teach them meditation my goals are\ndifferent from if i work for you\nwith you right so like like the kind of\nmeditation\nthat i'm not going to teach it's not one\nstandard for all people\nwhich is the problem with the nba\nanalogy and i think may actually be your\nproblem with meditation\nbecause what you're doing is if you\nreally pay attention\nyou're setting an objective standard and\nyou say i\nsuck at meditation because i am not able\nto live up to the objective standard\nthat's the problem because you're\nmeditating against an objective standard\ninstead of meditating to like like meet\nyou where you're at\nit's it's right back to like you know\nrecommending therapy to a patient\nbecause there's an objective standard\nthat's rct supported\nevidence-based works here's the referral\nand it doesn't go anywhere\nthe same problem with you because you're\nsaying oh i should get this out of\nmeditation this is the way that i should\nmeditate\nisn't it supposed to do this forget all\nthat crap\nif you want to learn how to meditate we\nstart you got\na few more minutes yeah i do\nokay can i can i give it a shot\nokay okay so the first question is why\ndo you want to meditate\nto reach a state of detachment\nwith an emotional component still\npresent\nokay so\nokay so i feel like i'm the riddler\nright now\noh no on the contrary you just dug\nyourself into the biggest pit you ever\ncould\nokay so this is what i want you to do\nyou want to feel an emotion\nand be detached from it\nyou want practice at that you want me to\nteach you how to do that yeah\ni want you to be a shitty meditator i\nwant you to meditate every day\ni want you to feel like a failure i want\nyou to feel like this doesn't work\nthis doesn't help i'm doing it wrong and\ni want you to separate\nso you we can pick any meditation\ntechnique\nand it's perfect because all you're\ngoing to do is you're going to practice\nfeeling like a bad meditator\nso anyway go up to 100 uh\nyou know women ask them for their phone\nnumbers get rejected by all of them and\nthen you get okay with rejection and you\nhave no fear to talk to anybody else\ni think there's some overlap but if\nwe're really talking about what\nmeditation\nis if you want to practice something if\nyou want to practice being detached from\nsomething\ni'm going to this is what we're\nliterally going to do i'm going to teach\nyou one meditation technique that you're\nbad at\nyou'll ask god for patience and god\ngives you the most frustrating\nsituations over and over\nthat's what you're giving me so\nyou're gonna you're gonna do any kind of\nmeditation that you've learned that you\nsuck at\nthen what we're gonna do is notice the\nfeeling of sucking at it\nthen i'm gonna give you a quick\nbreathing practice and you're just gonna\nsit with it all\nand like i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut the worse you feel like you're\ndoing at it just notice oh see how bad i\nam\nsee how much it isn't working and i know\nit sounds kind of weird\nbut the more you're able to see because\nwhat happens is if you get tangled up\nin being bad at it you're not going to\nbe detached you're going to be attached\ndoes that make sense yeah how do you\nfind the motivation to continue doing\nsomething you're bad at that's\nmy question very good so this is the\nperfect technique for you\nright so like like this is where and the\nshort answer is that you\nyou become detached because if you're\ndetached whether you're good or you're\nbad doesn't matter like the five foot\none guy\nwho plays basketball how does someone\nwho's five foot one play basketball\nthey let go of being in the nba who\ncares if i'm a failure\ni just love shooting hoops man that's\nhow you do it you detach\nthat's what i'm saying it's like the\nactual answer to your question it's the\nactual answer to happiness\nhow do you find the motivation you let\ngo of the success\nand you do it for the sake of the thing\nbecause you enjoy doing it\nnot the five or one gentleman is\nenjoying learning how to play basketball\nas opposed to making a goal to play\nin the nba and so it's it's a chicken or\negg thing because as he\nlets go of the\ngoal to play in the nba he will enjoy\nthe basketball more\nsee that's that's the thing i need\nproven to me yep\nbecause you're saying by saying i will\nget nothing from meditation or i will\nfail at meditation\nstarting with like a really low set\npoint like almost a negative set point\nof expectation i will then start\nenjoying it\nonly one way to find out okay\nyeah i mean yeah no this is tricky you\nhave to be really tricky here okay\nbecause\nif you say to yourself it won't work\nmike if you say to yourself\noh i'm going to start enjoying this by\nsuffering through it it's not going to\nwork\nbecause you're good at that right you're\ngood at making temporary sacrifices for\nsuccess in the end\nno no no you're going to fail if you do\nthat so what do i do\nyou have to do it with knowing it'll\nnever work\nyou have to you can't trick yourself\nbecause that's it's gonna be the same\n[ __ ] thing\nbecause then what's gonna happen is\nyou're gonna you're gonna start to\nmeditate you're saying it's not to work\nbut i'm going to start\nenjoying it at some point i'm going to\nwalk up to 100 girls\nand and then i'll get good at it because\nin the back your mind you're going to\nknow i'm going to get good at it\nand then what's going to feel like a\nfailure you're going to do it 100 times\nand you're not going to be good at it\nand then you're going to feel like a\nfailure oh it's not working it's not\nworking it was supposed to work but it's\nnot working it's not working it's not\nworking\nso you see what i'm saying there you\ngotta be careful sneaky sneaky\ni i understand the the complexity of it\nit just\nto me it's i i'm gonna try i'm honestly\ngonna give it a try uh\nto me it sounds like there's like knobs\nlike okay turn down expectation\nturn down expectation of not having an\nexpectation\nand it's like i don't like who i don't\nknow like i don't i don't think i have\nthat good control over my\nmental state but i'll try yes you\nunderstand it perfectly mike\nand when you can turn down knobs all the\nway to infinity\nthat is enlightenment yeah i mean i'm\nmore than willing to try it\nokay so now you're gonna teach us some\nmeditation okay\nyou get it you get it bro you're you're\non this you you're you're good\nyou figured it out seriously i'm i'm\nvery optimistic for you\nit's gonna suck i'm sorry and it's not\ngonna amount to anything\nsee but i know you're lying you know\nit's gonna amount to something\nno i don't i don't you do i heard you i\nheard you give the intellectual\nstatement earlier no because because as\nlong no no no because\nas long as you believe that i think it's\ngoing to be successful\nyou think it's going to be successful\nand then it's going to fail\nso it's not going to do i lie to myself\nnope\nyou just do the practice and then you\npractice you notice\nlike the more knobs you see the better\nyou're gonna get at it\nokay okay and then i'm actually tricking\nyou into a completely different\ndirection but we'll\nworry about that later okay so this is\nwhat i want you to do i want you to just\nshare with us\nyeah a meditation practice that you've\ntried you're doing great bro\nlove it um like uh just anything\nfour four second inhale eight second\nexhale\ndiaphragmatic breathing beautiful okay\nso what we're gonna do\nis let me just think for a second\nokay so this is what we're gonna do all\nright\nso we're gonna do four seconds of\ninhalation followed by eight seconds of\nexhalation we're gonna do like let's say\nfive\nrounds of that and what i want you to do\nas you're breathing is notice that there\nmay be thoughts in your mind\nof this isn't working or this doesn't\nfeel like working or whatever\nand then as you notice those thoughts\njust like notice them like\nprepare for it right it's like this\nperson's got an sd elevation\non the ekg when i look at the echo this\nis what i'm going to be looking for\nright\nso we're going to like look for it and\nthen as it arises you're just going to\nsee it\nand then after the five rounds of\nbreathing\ni want you to see how long the feeling\nof\nthis is a waste of my time i'm not doing\nit right\nthis will work in the end just see how\nhow long those feelings kind of last\nand then what i want you to do is try to\nfind the moment\nwhere inhalation becomes exhalation\nafter the five rounds after the five\nrounds\nuh-huh i'm not sure i grasp what that\nmeans\nthat's that's good so like you know we\nhave an\ninhalation and then we have an\nexhalation right you can observe that\nthere's a period of time where you're\ninhaling and you can observe\nthe time that you're exhaling and in\nbetween that\nas long as you don't hold your breath\nthere's gonna be like a moment where one\nbecomes the next\nand i want you to try to catch that\nmoment okay\nokay hey you want me just now\nyeah let's do it now we're gonna do it\ntogether so can you count for us\nlike for the first round like show us i\ni like to do it mentally but i guess i\ncan do it\nokay okay okay then do it mentally can i\ncount with the first round\nplease yeah okay a guided session i like\nit okay okay so we're\nso i'm gonna i'll count the first let's\nuh i'll count the first round and then\ncontinue i'm fine with it if you prefer\nit that way\nlet me just think about how i want to do\nthis no we're going to do just the first\none\nokay okay this is what i do to my\npatients\nwhen i want to check their reflexes on\ntheir knee and they won't let me do it\nso i make them\npull their hands up and look up at the\nceiling and then their reflexes come\nback\nthat's what you're doing to me it's a\nscene right through me\nokay all right so\ni've met my match okay so we're gonna\nwe're gonna just take start\nwith just take a moment to feel the\nweight of your body in the chair\nokay so now we're gonna take a deep\nbreath in expanding your diaphragm\npushing out your stomach\none two three\nfour and then exhale for eight seconds\none two three\nfour five 6\n7 8. and now again\nbreathe in one two\nthree four and breathe out\none two three\nfour five six\nseven eight and now continue at your own\npace\nwe'll practice for about 60 seconds\njust continue breathing i'll prompt you\nwhen to stop\nus\nplease\ngo ahead and finish the breath that\nyou're on\nand now just observe yourself\nsee if there are sensations of\nfeeling like you didn't do a good job\nlike you should have done better\nand we'll let you just pay attention to\nthoughts and feelings as they arise\nfor another\n45 seconds or so\nand now i want you to take a deep breath\nin\nand exhale\nand again\nexhale\nand then a third time in\nand out as the final breath\nas you finish your expiration go ahead\nand\nor exhalation go ahead and open your\neyes\ntell me what happened\nwhen you stopped counting and i started\nto have to count for myself\ni cannot count i lose track of the\nnumbers\nso that happens i started worrying about\nmy 5 45 meeting\ni thought about some emails that i\nshould have received today that i didn't\nokay that's that's the majority of the\nthoughts okay\nso you have a goal for meditation now\ni'm gonna be a teacher and i'm gonna\nteach you one more technique\nokay okay this is what you\ni think you need so i'm going to teach\nyou a technique called nari shodhana or\nalternate nostril breathing have you\never learned this before\nokay can you do this with your right\nhand\nso bring your index yep very good now\njust let the thumb out\nperfect yeah it could be like that\nthat's fine okay\ni think it's pretty good yeah yeah it's\nso what we're going to do is i'm going\nto take\nmy right thumb and i'm going to block my\nright nostril and i'm going to breathe\nin through my left\nallergies are making this a little hard\nokay\nand then once you have a full breath of\nair once you inhale\nthen we're gonna switch and exhale out\nthe other side\nand now we're going to inhale again\nthrough this side\nswitch and exhale\ngood inhale\ndon't switch it inhale\nit's gonna be tough because you've got\nallergies\nswitch and exhale\ninhale\nswitch exhale\nyou got the rhythm of it so let's pause\nfor a second maybe tough with allergies\ni understand that\nbut i want what i want you to do is\ninhale with through one nostril\nswitch and complete the breath out the\nother side then you\nstart with the same side again and\nswitch on a\nfull full total lung capacity filled to\nthe brim okay\nokay i hate that i know what you're\ndoing what am i what am i doing\ni'm not doing anything now seriously\nsorry go ahead sorry go ahead what am i\ndoing tell me\nyou're not doing anything no you're\nyou're uh you're distracting my mind\nyou're giving me an activity to do\ngood okay so close your eyes 60 seconds\nalternate nostril breathing\nwhy is this so hard for me to do it's\nokay you can you can\ndo with my pinky okay pinky is great\nyeah okay\nokay so start with the right right\nnostril blood good in\nswitch out\nin\nswitch out\nin\nswitch out\ngood now the training wheels are coming\noff you do it at your own pace we're\ngoing to do it for 45 seconds\ni'll keep track of the count you just\nfocus on not screwing up the breath\nmy\nokay\ngo ahead and finish the breath that\nyou're on\nhow was that good\nwhat does good mean\ni feel like my breathing is slowed down\ni also feel like my brain is wondering\nif i have a deviated septum or true\nallergies and why my left nostril\nis so congested but\ni i also hate that i appreciate what\nyou're doing like in the sense of\nlike my brain is like oh this is a\ndistraction method so this is what\nyou're doing and it's\nit's rationalizing it i wish it wouldn't\nbut\nyeah so control it so yep so don't\ncontrol it just continue the practice\nokay so like your problem mike\nis that the meditation you're trying is\ntoo easy\nso you need something called a powerful\nalumni and this is where i have to i\nhave to beg your\nif this doesn't work for you i have to\nbeg the opportunity to have another shot\nat it okay okay i'm gonna i'm gonna try\nit what's up\nwhat's the prescription how often when\nyou i want you to practice for five\nminutes\nwhenever you like i would say three\ntimes a week\nfive times a week but just\nyeah three five minutes five times a\nweek\nokay okay and and this is where\nso what you need is a powerful alumna an\nalumni is the sanskrit word for support\nyou need something that there's so much\ngoing on in your mind\nyou're actually so good at multitasking\nyou can juggle so many things at the\nsame time\nthat you actually need a very intensive\ntechnique\nthat will demand all of your attention\nso i'm going to leave you with one other\ntechnique don't try this one yet but\njust as an example\nyou need to stand with one foot you need\nto balance on\none foot with your eyes closed that's\ngoing to be your form of meditation\nyou can't try any of this new\nobservation stuff because your mind is\ngoing to fill that vacuum\nyou need a very powerful focusing\ntechnique\nand i the why why this makes a lot of\nsense to me specifically at a practical\nlevel is\nfor example if i was to and my\nheadphones listen to an audible book\nright now sitting here there's no way i\ncould listen to it\nbut while i'm driving to the hospital\nand i'm busy with the stimuli of driving\nand doing all these things\ni can grasp the most complex subjects\nwhereas like if i'm just sitting i have\nno idea what the speakers this is a\ndeficiency of your prior teachers\nbecause your mind needs to be occupied\nso the way that you keep your mind from\nwandering is by keeping it focused on\none thing\nalluringly enough imagine you're doing\npediatric\nphysical exam on a kid what do you do\nright you're like oh hey why don't you\nplay with my stethoscope while i look in\nyour ears\nyou're right you recognize what i'm\ndoing you get the principle and it still\nworks\nit's not about manipulation it's about\nproviding a technique for your mind that\nit can sit in one place\nand giving it what it needs to it's like\ntraining a dog where you give it a treat\nfirst and then it learns how to fetch\nthen it no longer needs the treat so we\nneed to train your mind to be able to do\nthis we'll give it the alumni the\nsupport it needs at the beginning\nand then as you get better at it you're\nnot going to need the alumni and then\nyou'll know how to meditate\nhoping that is the case\nokay my balance also sucks so if i fall\nuh\nis there malpractice coverage here there\nis not because it is not a medical\nconversation\nit is not medical advice i am not your\ndoctor\nnow i hate our legal system yeah\nthere is not malpractice coverage for\nstanding on one foot\non the west side highway of all places i\nwas literally just\ndiscussing with my producer about doing\na video about giving medical advice\nand how complicated it is like when my\nfriends call and say like hey i'm dizzy\nwhat should i do\nand i i just had that in the back of my\nmind because we just had this\nconversation but\nit was just crazy how complicated so i\napplaud you for doing this\non social media and on twitch and\nyoutube\nyeah of course thank you very much so dr\nmike it's been a pleasure i know you've\ngot a uh\nwith something in what sounds like 20\nminutes so i want to give you enough\ntime\nthank you so much for coming on i i\nreally enjoyed this\num do you want to just tell people very\nquickly where they can find you\ni mean i assume everyone already knows\nbut yeah well i'm the only uh\napparently dr mike or at least the the\none that comes up most when you search\nso if you just search dr mike on youtube\ninstagram twitter facebook all that good\nstuff so just search dr mike and if you\never have a topic you're curious about\nlike\ncholesterol or what happens when you\nswallow gum\njust search dr mike gum dr my\ncholesterol all those videos will pop up\nfor you\nthat's awesome thank you for the\nopportunity yes this has been an\nenlightening session\ni didn't reach enlightenment which is\nnot for everybody as you say but it was\na very enlightening session and\nuh i love having these types of\nconversations so thank you for that\nopportunity yeah good luck to you man\nyeah and give me a chance if it doesn't\nwork okay oh i\ni'm your i'm your discord friend now\nthat's it okay so now\ni'm gonna hit you up okay cool take care\nman bye all right thanks\nall right he's a fantastic guy you know\ni think i i mean i saw some stuff\nearlier i\ni
