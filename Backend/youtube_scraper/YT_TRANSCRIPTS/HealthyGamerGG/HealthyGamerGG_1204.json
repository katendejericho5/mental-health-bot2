    "transcript": "and then really when you got banned from\ntwitch you were sort of like i'm getting\na sense of like\nyou know desperation and fear really\nthat all this stuff was gonna be taken\naway and like you'd pay\nany price to hang on to it any price\nthis uh with like i don't know like a\ndoctor before like just mental health\nand stuff so\nyeah i can i can imagine um you know i\nthink a lot of people\nare do tend to be nervous i think um you\nknow just so you know\nwe're recording this for upload later\nright we on the same page about that\nokay\num yeah so\nwhat are you what do you uh help me\nunderstand what you're nervous about\nwell i mean uh well when i was younger i\ndid go to therapy but it's been so long\nit's been like\nyou know 15 years um i mean i just have\na lot of uh things that i've just\ngone through in my life that uh\nis hard to talk about and i\nusually don't feel comfortable talking\nabout it to my viewers\nbecause you know they wouldn't some of\nthem\nmay not respect what i say so i i just\ntend to keep things myself\nokay um well you know just a couple of\nlike sim oh\na couple of simple ground rules um you\nknow the first is that anything that you\ndon't feel comfortable talking about you\ndon't have to talk about\num you know my goal is to try to you\nknow\nmaybe help you in some way or educate\nyou or\num you know maybe give you some\ndirection or guidance and if there's\nsome way i can do that that's fine but\nyou know the goal here is not to make\nthe masses happy\nright and and so can you just start off\nby telling me what do you what do you go\nby\nwhat should i call you um you can just\ncall me paul\nokay um yeah paul so uh can you tell me\njust uh\ndid and did you have a particular idea\nof what you wanted to talk about today\ni mean it would be nice to talk about um\njust yeah i mean just i mean well so i\ni've autism so that would be\ninteresting to talk about okay and also\njust\npersonal growth and you know\nthings like that mental health when it\ncomes to streaming in a very stressful\nenvironment i've streamed in some\nstressful environments\nyeah okay uh\nand i i guess that's really it i don't i\ndon't know yeah no that's that sounds\ngreat man\num so can you tell me a little bit you\nsay you have autism so\ncan you tell me a little bit about that\nyeah\num so when i was younger um i don't\nremember what age i was diagnosed with\nasperger's\nso that i think has played like a pretty\nbig role in my life\nbecause i have a like it took me a while\nto like\nunderstand uh social\ncues and like how you know how to just\nhow to be social sure when i was younger\ni was like\nsuper sheltered and always in my house\ndidn't have any friends and talk to\nanybody had a\nnot a very good uh you know emotional\nrelationship with my parents\nso i was very just to myself um\nand i i think that also still carries\nwith me today in streaming\ncan you tell me um i mean if it carries\nwith you is it okay if i ask some\nquestions about that\nyeah that's fine i mean i'm totally open\nwith you i just you know because\nyou can help guide me through how to\ntalk about this\nsure so um can you tell me a little bit\nabout what growing up was like for you\ni mean it was pretty terrible it was uh\ni mean my parents are good people like\nthey're nice\nand i love them but you know they just\ndidn't uh\ni just i just don't think they were on\nthe same page as me they would always\nbring me to\nlike brought me to therapist they put me\non different medicine\nand you know but they just never really\ni don't think understood how to\num you know just communicate with me\nwhen i was going through a lot of my\nissues so it caused me to be a very\nangry\nchild an angry person growing up and you\nknow that caused me to lash out at\nschool\nlash out against other people lash out\non my parents\num and uh so my my childhood was very\nyou know it was full of a lot of\nproblems and i had i was like a\nvery troubled kid yeah it sounds like\nyou were kind of misunderstood and\ndidn't know really how to handle that\nyeah i mean i think looking back on it\nwhenever i would get angry or upset\ni just wouldn't know how to express\nmyself and my parents\ndidn't know what to do so because i\nwouldn't tell them\nbecause i'm not very good at expressing\nhow i feel\nso i think they just kind of had to\nguess\ncan you like does does anything in\nparticular come to mind in terms of like\num you know times or our memories of\nwhen you know things\nyou got angry and kind of lashed out\ni mean not i mean i don't really\nremember specific moments um there was\nthis one time i destroyed the\nchristmas tree it was uh they had put me\non zoloft\nand then uh which i'm sure it's like a\nmedicine\nand uh then i didn't like it because i\nwas like like a zombie and like i just\ndidn't feel very good\nso i just stopped it cold turkey\nand uh they they they kept they wanted\nto give me like another medicine\nthat i didn't really want to take either\nso i just got very angry\nand i lashed out and i just like\ndestroyed the christmas tree knocked it\nover\npunched you know a couple holes in the\nwalls in my room\nand uh you know then my parents got\nreally angry obviously i did that and\nthey came and you know you know yelled\nat me and\nspanked me or whatever so how old were\nyou\nuh i mean this was middle school so i\ndon't know maybe probably 12\n13. yeah so and do you have a sense of\nwhy they put you on medication or\nwhy they thought you needed medication\ni mean i was just you know i was just\nalways misbehaving\nso they probably just you know the\ndoctors probably told them that i should\nget some medication to help me with my\nmy issues right like uh yeah like i said\ni had a lot of anger issues so they put\nme on zoloft\nand these like uh mood stabilizers\nbut they didn't really help me because i\ndon't think i had\nlike i'm not like bipolar or anything i\njust uh like i can control my anger but\njust\ni just got to a certain point when i was\nyounger that i was always angry all the\ntime because i couldn't\never express myself and i had zero\nvalidation from anyone\nso that sounds weird to me to medicate\nmisbehavior well i mean they\ni just don't think they knew what to do\nbecause all right in school i was really\nbad\nand i had bad grades and i just how so\nyou know\nyeah what does that mean you were bad in\nschool i would always try to be the\nclass clown\nso i would uh you know misbehave in\nclass and make people laugh\nand then i'd get in trouble um but then\nalso i would be very angry in school and\nlash out at people because i also had no\nfriends\nso you know making people laugh was like\nthe only\npositive sort of like thing that i got\nout of people at school but i had to get\nmyself in trouble to do that\nso it's kind of like a bad situation\nyeah i mean i i can imagine it must have\nbeen tough to be like a kid and to think\nlike\noh the only way i can make friends or\nmake people sort of like you know\ntreat me well or appreciate that i'm\naround as if i get in trouble\nso it's sort of you really had to you\nhad to pay a price to\nyou know kind of connect with people and\nmake make people appreciate you well i\nmean they still didn't really appreciate\nme i got bullied like crazy in school\nlike i was probably one of the most\nbullied kids at school\num i have really really bad stories that\ni could tell you of making\nlike of just things that have happened\nto me and specifically in middle school\nthat was the\n[ __ ] worst kid i'd love to hear if\nyou're\ncomfortable sharing that so that there\nwas this one time\nand uh i think it was like seventh grade\nor something there was this teacher was\nreally popular\num and she was pregnant and i was in\nclass and you know i didn't want to do\nmy work\nbecause you know whatever reason and i\nwas just sitting there\nand she got very angry at me for not\ndoing my work\nand she you know came up i don't know if\nshe was like going through mood swings\nor something\nbut she came up and she started like\nscolding me about not doing my work and\ni'm like i don't really want to do it\nand then she started you know kind of\nyelling a little bit\nfor me to do my work and then she like i\ndon't know started getting cramps or\nsomething in her stomach\nand um i think she ended up well she i\nthink she went to the hospital because\nshe had to like leave\nand you know the principal came in had\nto like take over the class and she was\nyou know going through like a pretty\nmajor episode in class i think from the\ncramps\nso after that when the bell rang the uh\nthe rest of the kids in the class just\nuh made up this rumor\nthat i'd killed her baby in you know\nthat she was pregnant with which\nobviously it wasn't true\nbut for the rest of the year i was just\nknown as a as baby killer\noh my god by the entire school and i\nwould tell the teachers and the\nprincipal and they just\nwould say uh they just didn't care\nreally they said\nwell i guess uh we can put you in this\nisolated classroom so that's what they\ndid they put me in this like in-school\nsuspension classroom for\nlike two months which was terrible as\nwell so\nuh yeah that's how seventh grade went\ndude that's that sounds awful it sounds\nlike almost sounds like you got\npunished for reaching out for help well\nyeah i mean they i'm from a small town\nin florida they had\nliterally no resources whatsoever\nso they just kind of put you like they\njust didn't know what to do\nor they just had no money for resources\nor i don't know\ndo you remember how you felt about it\nback then\num i mean oh i mean i'm just angry i\ndon't really know how i felt but i can\njust remember\nmy entire childhood i was just angry all\nthe time\nand i just hated everyone i hated myself\ni hated everything\ni just thought that uh you know i was\njust\nnot belonging anywhere\nthat sounds terrible man\nyeah but i i feel like it helped me\nlearn like it helped me grow as a person\nlike uh pretty quick at least in that\nkind of regard of like uh\ntoughening up like i'm a pretty tough\nperson\nand i can deal with a lot of [ __ ] so\nyeah i can imagine that to come out of\nthat on the other end you have to be\nquite the survivor\nbut um yeah so i mean and then that was\njust seventh grade\nother grades you know has were also had\ntheir own stories\nso i'd love to hear a little bit more\nabout that\nokay um when\ni mean sixth grade was just basic\nbullying nothing really crazy to be\nhonest\nuh when i was in eighth grade there was\nthis kid his name i think eighth grade\nmaybe he was still seventh i don't\nreally remember\nbut this kid his name was pimp and he\nwas just\nuh this this like kid in my pe class\nand every time we would go to the locker\nroom he would like\npretend rape me and i know that sounds\ninsane but he would uh so i would always\ntry i would change in the stall\ninstead of changing like in front of\neveryone because i just didn't feel\ncomfortable with that\nand one day he uh you know usually he\ndidn't go that far he would like come up\nand like slap my ass and like\nyou know just like just like uh\nharass me in front of his friends and it\nwas just funny but this one time\nwhen i was changing the stall he crawled\nunder the stall and he like\nyou know he had his pants on and\neverything but he like grabbed me\nand he pushed me on the floor and he got\non top and he was like pretend raping me\nin front of and then like he opened the\nstall and there was just like\n20 kids like the whole locker room just\nthere laughing as he's doing that\nand uh so that was obviously humiliating\nas [ __ ]\nand that was terrible um but\nand he was also the most popular kid in\nour grade so i couldn't even tell\na teacher or anything but someone else\nactually told the teacher that this kid\nhad\nlike you know [ __ ] pretend raped me\nin the locker room\nyou know and humiliated me and he ended\nup getting expelled from school\nbut everyone thought that i told the\nteacher on him so they just called me a\nsnitch\nfor the rest of that year and they just\nbullied me even harder because they're\nlike oh you [ __ ]\nyou know got pimp expelled and i'm just\nlike i\ni didn't do anything wow dude\nso it's just like a double whammy this\nis terrible\nyeah i've heard of a lot of bad bullying\nlike i got bullied\ngrowing up you know i grew up in east\ntexas and\nyou know it was small town texas kind of\nstuff where\nyou know just your but that was like\nyour run-of-the-mill\nyou know racism like some degree of like\nbigotry\nlike pretty like standard stuff i mean\nthis is honestly paul like just as a\nas a professional this is some of the\nworst stuff i've ever heard like someone\ngoing through\nyeah my i mean it was it was pretty bad\nand\ni you know obviously yeah i didn't have\nanyone to talk to it about so\ni just kept it all to myself so you can\nsee why\nso angry i can i can definitely see why\nyou would be so angry and lash out\nand stuff i mean i i don't know i mean\ndid your parents\nknow that this stuff was going on or\nyeah i told my parents and\ni mean obviously they went to the school\nwere upset that this was happening but\nthe school\ni mean they didn't do anything there's\nthey i i don't remember\nobviously what happened with my parents\ngoing in there and talking to them but i\njust remember nothing happening\nso i don't think the school did anything\nbut after\nuh though actually that was seventh\ngrade the the pimp thing because i\nremember\neighth grade i actually did get\ntransferred to a different school\nbut it was not it was so bad that i got\ntransferred\nthough because what ended up happening\nwas so my parents complained\nor something and i guess we had a\nmeeting and i was there\nand they were like okay we can send paul\nto this other school that's out of the\njurisdiction because they have this like\nspecial classroom that he can sit in\nand it's like a one classroom a day type\nthing so instead of going to eight\nperiods i just have i just stay in one\nclassroom all day with like seven other\nkids\nand with like uh behavioral uh issues it\nwas called a self-contained classroom\nand you know people who had emotional\nbehavioral problems go in there\ninstead of just like expelling me from\nschool so\nyou know i transferred to that school\nbut it was awful because obviously since\nit was so far away\nthey had to send a bus to my house that\nwas only for me i was the only person on\nthe bus\nso they sent me a little short bus\ninstead of like a normal bus\nand everyone at my bus stop of like 20\nkids\ni was like oh yeah i'm going to this new\nschool now and they're like oh\nyou know that's interesting and then\nthis [ __ ] short bus pulls up and they\nall just start calling me [ __ ]\nbecause you know obviously the short bus\nis like a it's like a meme that it's\nlike\nfor slow kids right so\ni was very upset that that was the bus\nthat they\ndecided to send me every day because\nyeah\ngoing to the bus stop was terrible then\nthese are my neighbors you know\nthey call me [ __ ] just every day\noh my god paul but when i got to the new\nschool it was actually\nit was good though because i actually\nenjoyed being in that classroom\nand the self-contained classroom is\nactually what i spent my entire high\nschool in\nas well until i was a senior at least\num because yeah i was i felt very\ncomfortable in there\nand the other kids didn't bully me we\nwere all pretty like cool with each\nother everyone was pretty nice to each\nother\ni think it's because they all went\nthrough like their own issues\nso they didn't maybe judge uh me as much\ninteresting and uh so i'm really curious\npaul like\ni can you know i can imagine or remember\nwhen i was 13 sort of like how i had a\nconception of things\nlike you know why stuff happened\nwhy i got treated the way that i did\nwhat was your understanding of like\nwhy this stuff was happening to you i\nmean did you even understand that\nsomething was happening to you that you\nwere\nsort of being treated differently that\nyou were\nlike what did you think about yourself\nand your situation growing up\ni mean i don't really know um\ni remember just thinking yeah this is\nunfair\nbut i also just thought to myself oh i'm\njust you know\nclearly there's just something wrong\nwith me because if i'm having these\nissues and other people aren't\ni suppose there must be something wrong\nwith me\nso i just you know had really low\nself-esteem\ni didn't know what was wrong with me uh\nbecause i actually didn't get diagnosed\nwith asperger's um\nfor a while maybe it was when i was a\nlittle bit older than like 12\nbecause i remember going to a lot of\ntherapists and they knew i had some kind\nof autism but they didn't\nknow exactly what\nuntil i think i was maybe like 14 or\nsomething or 15.\nbecause i we my parents ended up having\nto take me to this one really\ngood specialist and he then\nwas like okay this sounds like\nasperger's\nwhich uh i mean it's hard to remember\neverything\nin like a chronological order but\num yeah so even but even with that\ndiagnosis i still\ni at the time i didn't think i had\nasperger's because my parents then\nstarted\nenrolling me and and you know these\ntherapy groups\nwith other kids that had asperger's and\nyou know the other kids in those therapy\ngroups had it\nway more severely than i did um so they\nacted way different obviously\nand uh so i didn't even feel like i\nbelonged in those groups either\nbecause i i mean now as an adult you\nknow\nand maturing a little bit i think like\nyeah\ni do have i think i do have asperger's\nbut but it's not because i\nlike i just have a hard time expressing\nmy emotions and it's like\ni i can't really feel emotions very well\nokay but explain to me what asperger's\nis or or what your understanding of it\nis\num i mean it's it's just when you you\nknow have a hard time\nseeing other people's perspectives\nperhaps and you have a hard time\nreading people's like body language and\nunderstanding what they're thinking and\nuh\nand then maybe i have a hard time with\ntalking to people in the form of like uh\nyou know with like sarcasm\nor joking with people or i'll say\nsomething that i think is funny\nbut other people it's like offensive or\nrude to them i had a\nhuge problem with that when i was\nyounger i would say something and people\nwould get like offended by it\nand i wasn't trying to offend anyone hmm\nso i it sounds to me like like sometimes\nyou're just not quite on the same\nwavelength is that a good way to\ndescribe\nit yeah i think that's a good way to\ndescribe that yeah and and that\nsometimes you're not really sure\nwhat you're feeling or how to express\nthat to people and maybe\nsome of that i'm gonna assume for a\nsecond that that's sort of negative\nemotions\num but that emotional turmoil kind of\nmanifests\nin in ways that can create challenges\nfor you and your relationships\nyeah i mean essentially um you know\nyeah making relationships with people\nhas been tough\nbecause i have a hard time with i mean i\ndon't know\nlike the basic stuff needed to build\nrelationships like i just have a hard\ntime\nlike now as an adult i can it's easier\nbut when i was younger it was so hard i\ndidn't understand how to be\nfriends with somebody or i didn't\nunderstand how to even like have\nbasic communication with people you know\nwhen i was like 16.\nand and what would you say you've\nlearned as an adult like what are some\nof the key things that you've sort of\nfigured out in terms of how to be\nfriends with someone and how to\ncommunicate\num well now i mean i just\ni try my best to go out of my way to\nyou know be a friend to my friends right\nyou know ask how they're doing\nand you know just you know ask if they\nwant to hang out you know just it sounds\nbasic but\ni just i had to learn this stuff it\ndidn't come natural to me\nlike i used to read i used to like look\non the internet and google and like read\nbooks and like how to\nlike talk and be friends like how to\nread somebody's face\nlike i didn't know how to do any of that\n[ __ ] what are you getting from my face\nare you reading my face now\ni mean yeah you just look like you're\nlistening okay\ni am listening i mean\nit's still uh i mean i'm pretty good at\nit now obviously because\nstreaming has really helped me a lot\nwith uh understanding uh social cues\nand everything but even like when i was\n20 before i even started streaming\ni still had a hard time and yeah so can\nyou\nso it sounds like actually getting in\nthat self-contained classroom was\nwas a pretty good experience for you it\nseems like\nyou were able to form connections with\npeople people really didn't bully you\nand stuff like that\nyeah so so high school can you tell me a\nlittle bit about what high school was\nlike i mean\ni mean high school was pretty pretty\nplain i\nuh well when i was in ninth grade though\nthis was the only not plain thing so i\nwas still\nobviously upset the self-contained\nclassroom was\nwas nice that i didn't get bullied in\nbut i was still upset that i was\nin there still kind of and i felt like\nand i was still just an angry kid so the\nteacher\ncame up to me and was like wanting to\nhave me do my work and i didn't want to\ndo my [ __ ] work\nand i started arguing with the teacher\nin my ninth grade class\nand then he you know was like um\nyou know [ __ ] uh yelling and i was\njust like and i threatened him i was\nlike i'm gonna punch you or i'm gonna\ni don't know stab you with this pencil i\ni said i'm gonna stab you with this\npencil i just don't like saying it now\nbecause it makes me sound like a\nlike a bad person but i was just an\nangry kid\num so i said that to the teacher i\nwasn't actually gonna do that i was just\nangry but so\nobviously they set up a meeting and they\nwere going to expel me because that's\nlike a threat\nto the teacher and i was so angry and\nupset\ni started yelling in the room with uh\nwith my mom there\nand i started yelling at my mom because\nshe said something that i didn't like\nto the teacher and i said something\nabout autism or asperger's or something\ni just felt so angry that she said that\nbecause i kept denying that i had\naspergers at that time\nso i started yelling at her and you know\nwhat the [ __ ] school did they ended\nup calling the\nresource officer like the school cop and\nthey had me arrested\nfor yelling at my mom like i was just\nyelling like and they they arrested me\ninstead of like trying to de-escalate\nthe situation\num obviously i didn't get charged with\nanything\nbut they sent me over to the you know\nthe juvenile\ndetention place and i ended up sitting\nthere for like two hours and then they\nwouldn't release me back to my parents\num because that was\nbecause you know i was yelling at them\nand that was where the situation\noccurred so i had to go to my friend's\nmom for like a week\nbefore i could go back to my parents and\nthat was terrible because\ni i thought that was totally undeserving\nyeah i mean i mean it\nand and when you say you thought it was\nundeserving what what what made you\nthink that that was undeserving or\nunfair\nwell i mean obviously i'm gonna be upset\nthat they're trying to expel me from\nschool\nsure and you know i had a lot of\nemotional problems\nwhen i was younger so i just would hope\nuh i mean\nthis is not how i was thinking i was\nyounger but now in hindsight i'm like i\nwould hope this school would maybe\nhave a little bit more uh understanding\nbut\nthey didn't they just were like oh well\nwe don't want to deal with it so just\ncall the police yeah i'm hearing a theme\nhere of people sort of\nnot trying to understand you i\ni mean yeah that sounds that's like the\nthat's like the plot here of my\nchildhood\nbut i mean tough man\nyeah i mean it it uh it it was it was\num but uh so i ended up going\nso instead of when i got expelled i went\nto this other school and it was full of\nbad kids and like gangsters drug dealers\n[ __ ] up\njust kids that were actually criminals\nand like on probation and [ __ ] and\nclearly i'm i don't belong there so my\nparents ended up um\nputting me into this this camp it's\ncalled eckerd uh eckerd's learning\ncenter and it was just like\nit was it was this camp that kids go to\nwhen they have\nyou know behavior problems well half the\nkids there\nwere orphans that were being misbehaving\nin their orphanage\nand the other half were kids who got\narrested and got sent there by the\ncourts\nbut my parents you know could opt to\nsend me there since i was in this\nalternative school\nbut they asked but they had to pay money\num so they did\nand i went there for three months\ninstead of go instead of this\nalternative school that had\nyou know these you know like drug\ndealers and [ __ ]\nso i was and i was i actually liked it\nthere i mean it was interesting i ran\naway three times and then they had to\nfind me and they brought me back\nand whatever but i all i had to do was\nbe good for like a month and fill out\nthis check sheet and i'd be out\ni ended up staying there for three\nmonths because the first two months i\nwas misbehaving last month i was good\nand they let me go and i got back i got\nto go right back to my uh\nschool i got expelled from and that's\nwhere my behavior\nissues started to subside that camp\nactually helped me\nunderstand yeah i'm sorry keep going\nthe camp helped me understand how to uh\ncontrol myself a lot better because\num well i mean like i said that half the\nkids there were there by the courts\nand have been the actual jail like um\nand the other half were you know kids\nwho were who were orphans\nso they obviously had a not a very good\nlife at that time\nso i kind of like got more perspective\num and i didn't misbehave as much\nbecause they would beat the [ __ ] out of\nme if\nif i did because um if somebody starts\nmisbehaving that we have to go\nin this like group this we have to sit\nin like a circle and talk about it for\nan hour\nnobody wants to do that so if anyone\nmakes the whole group have to sit there\nfor an hour in a group\nthen later they they jump you they like\nbeat you up\nso obviously i'm not going to misbehave\nthere i don't want to get [ __ ] beat\num i already got initiated when i got\nthere they beat me with they put like\nsomething inside a sock and they hit me\nwith it when i was sleeping\nso that was uh yeah that was not fun so\ni didn't want it\nyou mean the other kids right yeah the\nother kid so we had three cabins because\nit was in the woods this like camp uh we\nhad three cabins so the kids in my cabin\nwould\nyou know they did that as like an\ninitiation\nso i'm i'm hearing that actually like\nyou know physical consequences\nactually helped you well in terms of\nlike learning how to regulate yourself\nyeah\nit helped me with like uh just\nself-control\nlike i didn't lash out i was still angry\nbut i just kept to myself i didn't lash\nout\nat those people and those kids or\nanything so\num and then after a while of not lashing\nout i started to like be more content\nwith\ni don't know being there and i kind of\nliked being there it was like kind of\nnice\nto be told what to do all the time\nit was kind of nice to i don't know\nlike uh just have a structure in your\nlife\nbecause you know you have the line up\nevery other you know in a line when you\nwalk places you have to do your laundry\nyou have to clean your bed\nflip your mattress you have to make your\nown food you're completely independent\nwow so it was food like what kind of\nfood would you make\num well i mean you wouldn't really make\nthe food but you would\nset it out to the other kids like you'd\nmake the table\ngot it um so it was\nkind of like that it was like a once a\nweek thing you x every kid got\nyou know they take turns or whatever\nyeah yeah\nso that place helps me be independent\nand and have more self-control so\nwhen i left that place when i graduated\nfrom it it was i don't know i think it\nlike really helped me become like a\nlike a better person can i just point\nout\npaul um a couple of just themes that i'm\nhearing\nyeah so uh\nyou know the first is that i i really do\nget the sense that like\npeople have not tried to understand you\ni mean\ni i'm kind of hearing so many different\nstories of\nyou know early on like growing up you\nwere misbehaving and your parents sort\nof like\na lot of times you would get kind of\npunished and i think on the one hand it\nsort of makes sense because maybe you\nwere lashing out and\nand kind of saying inappropriate things\nbut\na lot of times you know it seems like\npeople sort of didn't care about your\nside\nof things you know this whole like\ngetting expelled and like you kind of\nexpressing\nanger and then expressing anger at your\nmom i'm sort of hearing\nand i've heard this theme before that\nyou know everyone blames you for being\nangry but like people may not be trying\nto understand like why you're angry in\nthe first place like what's your side of\nthe story\nand then certainly with with you know\nthe whole pimp thing because it's like\nyou had something that you were trying\nto explain to people you're like i\ndidn't say anything\nbut they didn't care to listen and they\ndidn't care to understand\nand so i'm hearing a lot of sort of\nsituations where\nmaybe you got punished for\nyou know stuff that really wasn't your\nfault or or that\nyou know people had kind of listened to\nyou or bothered to kind of\ntry to understand your perspective like\nlike or they they really didn't do that\nwhat do you think about that is that\nfair to say yeah\nthat's pretty accurate yeah nobody\nnobody cared to\nlisten to me when i was younger i mean i\nhad therapists but they weren't very\ngood\num until i got the one guy that\ndiagnosed\nthe asperger's and i stayed with him for\nlike six years wow\nwhat was can you tell me a little bit\nabout um\nwhat made the therapists not good and\nand what made this guy\ngood well i mean my my first therapist\nthat i had he didn't even say i had\nautism he said\nadhd and he gave me you know adderall or\nwhatever\nand i didn't do very good on adderall\ni just got worse my behavior got worse\nbecause now i'm super stimulated\nat school and i definitely didn't want\nto do anything and now i'm like super\nagitated and like got angry quicker and\nlike\nand i don't know and then when i went\nback to the therapist and i would tell\nhim like\ni feel worse because i didn't know how\nto express myself so i wasn't like it's\nthe medicine\ni just said i feel worse so he just put\nme on a different medicine\ninstead of like trying to maybe\nunderstand why i felt worse\num so that's like the theme of all these\ntherapists that i would go to\ntypically um until that one guy he\nactually didn't give me any medicine he\njust\ngave me advice which is much better\nand so you stayed with him for six years\nthat's a long time\nyeah he was uh this top-rated guy in\npalm beach\nso we had to drive like 45 minutes to\npalm beach\nin or to get to him my parents had to\nunfortunately\nyou know he's very expensive my parents\nhad to pay like 700\nevery time we go there but he didn't\ntake insurance so he's like\none of the like of course he's you know\nuh\njust a very expensive doctor but for\ngood reason he was really good\nat what he did and he you know\nactually sat there and talked to me and\nlike listened to what i\nhad to say and gave me advice\num instead of just just giving me\nmedicine\nand i really liked him i like i looked\nforward to seeing him he was like my\nthe person i actually could open up to\ndoes he know that he was that important\nto you\ni mean no i'm probably not\ni've not i've been talk i mean obviously\nhaven't spoke to him in\nmany years so how long has it been\ni don't know i think the i mean i think\nthe last time i saw him was like a 19 or\nsomething\nand uh 26.\nhave you ever thought about reaching out\nto him and and sharing some of this\nstuff\ni mean i i haven't but i i could i just\num\ni always just thought he was just you\nknow like a busy guy you know\nhe's the number one therapist in palm\nbeach\nso i just never thought he would have\ntime for any of that so\nbut um yeah so i mean after i got out of\nthe camp\nand you know that's when i you know my\nparents brought me to this guy and then\nat school i started being better because\nthe camp helped me learn some things\ni'm able to get advice from from this\nnew therapist\nwho's giving me you know good advice\nabout asperger's and stuff\nand like how to you know communicate\nwith people and i started being better\nin school i started\nnot misbehaving and i went through my\nninth the second half of ninth grade all\nthe way up until i was a senior\nin this like self-contained classroom\nwhich is a weird experience like in high\nschool to have just one classroom\nall day for three years but um since i\nwas good for three years they're like\nokay\nlet's let them out to the general\npopulation classrooms\nas a senior and yeah i did well\nso and i felt like good i was like i\nwasn't getting bullied\nand like uh kids are being nice to me\nand i was like i felt like\ni was hanging out with some people like\ni felt pretty good about myself\nat that point wow dude that's great\nbut to be fair though we were like 18\nor 17 18 and as a senior so it's like\nobviously kids are past the bullying\npart so i didn't forgive any of them\nbecause these are the same kids that\nused to bully me\nyeah i don't know that people are past\nbullying at the age of 17 rape team i\nthink sometimes\nit gets better but you know i know\npeople who are in their 30s and still\nbully other people but i'm happy to hear\nthat it sounds like you\nyou learned a lot of skills you had\nlearned maybe a little bit about how to\ncontrol yourself a little bit better\nhad learned how to make friends um you\nknow ask people how they're doing\nask people if they want to hang out and\nuh\nand so i assume things with your parents\ngot better too\nyeah i mean my parents and i are good\nnow we just uh you know it's just a\nrough childhood\nyeah sorry what are you saying\nno go go for it uh now that i you know\ni'm\nas i'm an adult so i can express myself\nbetter so\nclearly my relationship with my parents\nis better because i can\num you know tell them how i feel and\nlike\nstuff now so yeah i was just gonna say i\nthink actually it sounds like your\nparents tried very hard to kind of\nfigure out\nyou know how to help you um i'm hearing\nthat they were really confused but\nyou know it sounds like they tried quite\nhard like they\nyou know had you seeing different kinds\nof people and sure those people ended up\nnot being the right ones but\npaul i've heard so many stories where\nyou know\nthe parents sort of give up at some\npoint right\nor because what i'm really hearing is\nthat your parents tried like\nso many different things to try to help\nyou and even drive you 45 minutes and\npay 700 bucks a session to try to get\nyou the help that you need for like six\nyears\nlike it sounds like you tried really\nhard my parents had to take out a loan\nto bring me to that that camp\nbecause because you know i wasn't court\nordered so i might they had to pay like\nsix thousand a month to send me there\nfor three months\nso they got a loan for that and yeah if\ni was a parent i don't think i would\ndo that for my kid i would want to help\nmy kid but that would be\nlike that's just a huge risk it's a lot\nof money\nso my parents are very good with that\nyeah i mean how do you understand why\nthey did that if you wouldn't do it\nwhat do you mean you said that you\nwouldn't do that for your kid\nyou know well i mean it's just a lot of\nmoney\nand i won't and i don't know if this is\ngoing to help my kid so if it doesn't\nhelp\nthem it's a lot of money to just you\nknow throw away\nyeah so i don't know if i would take\nthat that\nfinancial risk makes makes a lot of\nsense\nhow do you understand why your parents\nwould take that financial risk\ni mean i think they just wanted to help\nme\nany way that they could you know despite\nany financial situation they could end\nup in\nyeah because i mean they saw\nthey saw my my misery like you know they\nthey\nthey felt bad like they didn't want me\nto\nbe miserable so sure\nyou feeling anything as i ask you these\nquestions\ni mean yeah i feel i'm just like looking\nback at memories and it makes me feel\nlike\num i don't know like um\ni don't know how it makes me feel it's\njust like a weird uh\nfeeling but it's not very strong it's\njust like uh\nmemories i don't know how to explain it\nto be honest yeah yeah\nthat's so that that's what we're here\nfor so do you have a sense of why i\nasked you that question at that moment\nno i don't right so i i saw a change in\nyour face\nso you started uh i'm not quite sure if\nyou were like like\nsucking your teeth or something like\nyour your facial expression change you\nstarted to do something with your mouth\ni'm not trying to make you uh\nself-conscious i realize it could be\ndoing that but\ni noticed signs in your face that you\nwere experiencing some kind\nof emotion yeah and\nand so it was a different kind of\nemotion from what i've seen so far\nexpressed in your face\nand and you know if i if i had to say\nlike like can we talk about that emotion\nand maybe try to understand what it is\nyeah i mean we can talk about it so so\nlet's\nlet's kind of think about this you you\nhad images in your mind\nof you and what were the images of\nwell i was just trying to remember you\nknow things that\nhappened when i was young so i was just\nyou know replaying the\nsituations and yeah just\nmaybe it's a little bit of a discomf\ndiscomfort feeling\nmaybe that's like what i felt but uh\ni don't really know probably i i think\nso let me let me ask you kind of\nsomething weird do you know if\nwhat you felt was negative or positive\nor maybe a little bit of both\ni think it was kind of positive yeah\ni mean it's uncomfortable to think about\nbut it's positive\nbecause i like to see my you know where\ni've how i used to be when i was younger\nversus now it's it's nice to look back\nand be and like know that i have\nlearned so many things you know what i\nmean yeah\nso what do you think about love like do\nyou think it was love\nuh do i think it was well what do you\nmean it was love\nwhat you were feeling just now\nuh no i don't think so\nokay who would i be loving ah good\nquestion\nso i i i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut maybe it was being the recipient of\nlove\nwith my parents\nhow so so here's um\nso you it's kind of weird right because\nit's a positive feeling that's\nuncomfortable\nright and then you're actually\nremembering like\nmiserable circumstances\nso that's kind of confusing right\nbecause like if i'm remembering misery\nbut i'm feeling a positive emotion like\nhow does that work\nyou with me yeah and then we were sort\nof talking about\nessentially like you know your parents\nit's kind of taking a big financial risk\nand then i i started to see your face\nchange when when\nas we sort of talked about that you\nstart started to say like well\nyou know they saw how miserable i was\nand and what i'm kind of seeing hearing\nis like a story of of you know you not\nbeing understood you not knowing how to\nexpress\nthings to them and at the same time them\nputting themselves in like financial\nrisk essentially to roll the dice\nbecause they didn't know if six thousand\ndollars a month is going to help you or\nnot\nbut they saw how miserable you are\nand and so i'm wondering whether like\nand it can be hard to like\nbe it can be hard to for other people to\nlike\nfeel to see our misery and like\ndo something about it it can actually be\nlike really uncomfortable for us to\nreceive kind of like love or faith\nor or even be treated with value\nno i feel that's that's crazy you say\nthat because i literally\nfeel uncomfortable with positive\nuh reinforcement a lot of the time like\nwhen people give me compliments i feel\ncomfortable by that like i like\ncompliments and i\nfor sure but i you know am a little bit\nuncomfortable because it's just uh i\nmean even now it's just\nmaybe i'm not used to it or i don't know\ni mean obviously it's a streamer i'm\nused to it but\nit's still like if a viewer says okay\nlet me reiterate that if the viewer\ncompliments me in the chat\nobviously there's no discomfort but if\nthe\nperson in real life says it to me it's\ndifferent\nthere's a little bit more uh i'm a\nlittle bit more awkward with it\nyeah so paul do you do you\nso maybe maybe love is not the right\nword\nso like what about feeling valued\nyeah i mean i don't know if\ni mean i look back my parents valued me\nfor obviously for sure\nbut i i don't know if that's what i'm\nfeeling right when i looked back\nat that but i don't know i mean you\nwould know more than me potentially\nbut sort of right because you're the one\nwho's actually feeling it though so it's\nit's not like i'm a mind reader i'm not\na mind reader\nbut i i just i don't know like i'm sorry\ni just can't like i have such a hard\ntime with\nemotions yeah i i understand that why\nare you apologizing\ni just don't want you to be uh\ni don't know uh what's like upset that\ni'm not explaining it well\nyeah are you getting the sense that i'm\nupset\ni mean no but i just do like you know\npre-apology\nyep so so let's understand where that\napology comes from so like\nif you're not getting a signal from me\nthat that\ni'm upset i'm sort of getting that\nyou've your\nmind is actually activated\npre-apology.exe\ndoes that make sense to you yeah it's\nlike oh maybe i'm not doing a good job\nso i better apologize because then this\nperson will be disappointed because i'm\nnot doing what i'm supposed to be doing\nis that why you're apologizing\nyeah so that i think is also like an\nimportant bit of programming you've\nlearned because i think in the past\npeople have punished you and been upset\nwith you\nbecause you haven't done some things\nthat you've been incapable\nof doing\nyeah that makes sense and so i'm not\nexpecting you to\nbe good at this and you\ni know actually i i don't expect you to\nbe bad at it either\nit's just\nsun was just beating on me it's getting\nreally hot yeah totally cool man\num i kind of think about this as like\nthis is a co-op game\nso like you know if it's helpful we can\ntry to explore emotions and\nand maybe like help you understand what\nsome of that stuff is\nswim around in there i may not know you\nmay not know but hopefully we can figure\nit out together\nwhat do you think about that yeah i mean\ni would\nif i could understand emotions better\nthat would be\nreally amazing because\ni'm not gonna lie when you asked about\nlove earlier i just thought i was like a\nlittle worried for a second because love\nis like\njust one of those things i totally have\nsuch a hard time feeling don't really\nunderstand\nand i just you know and it makes me feel\nbad\nbecause i should love you know\nmore often right like i should love\npeople like i love my parents\nbut it doesn't come in the form of like\na physical emotion\nit comes in the form of logical thinking\nyeah so that that's why i tossed out\nthat word there because i\nit occurs to me that i know it sounds\nkind of weird but like\nsometimes that's how love can feel like\nif you can kind of think about it\nit's weird because love is sometimes an\nemotion that\nwe think of as a positive emotion but\noftentimes is like\nhurts on the inside it's weird like that\nokay so so i'll try to explain a little\nbit okay\nso you were thinking about your misery\nright and you were also saying that\nlogically it doesn't make sense\nto take a you know a loan\non rolling the dice on a kid who's like\nkind of hopeless\nlike they've tried a bunch of stuff\nright like you've been to special\nclassrooms\nyou've been here you've tried this\ntherapist that therapist\nand and so i i could imagine that like\nyou maybe felt some degree of\nhopelessness\nyou may not have recognized it but i\nthink on some level like you understood\nthat you were bouncing around from thing\nto thing to thing\nand like you know like i almost get this\nis the second theme\nso i get the sense that you were a kid\nthat no one knew what to do with\nlike what do we do with paul like what\ndo we do like well let's try to medicate\nhim let's try to put him in this\nclassroom let's try to put him in that\nclassroom\nlet's expel him let's suspend\nhim let's like what do we do with this\nkid\nand it can be really really hard i mean\nthe you know one of the most devastating\nthings to your self-esteem the\nself-esteem of a child is for like the\nworld to not know like what to do with\nthis kid\nand to be that kid and then for your\nparents to sort of like have tried so\nmuch stuff and it kind of like not\nhaving worked\nand i i don't know that you sort of\nconsciously understood this but i think\nit manifests in self-esteem like\nyou felt like probably not like a great\nkid right and you were like really angry\nall the time and angry was just sort of\nlike\nthe way that these emotions like these\nother emotions manifested\nyeah i mean that that makes i mean yeah\nthe anger just\nwas everything yep and and so when you\nthink about that kid and you think about\nyour parents sort of like\nknowing that maybe this wasn't a great\nidea like logically didn't sound like a\ngreat idea but for them to really put\nthemselves at financial\nrisk when\nwe didn't know if it was going to work\nlike it sounds like a stupid decision\nbut like it's a stupid decision they\nmade for you\nyeah and that's and and that's uh yeah i\nmean that's like love right so\nyeah exactly right so like and that's\nwhy it feels kind of weird on the inside\nbecause it's not like a positive emotion\nthere's like\nthere's some kind of hurt but it's also\nlike you can tell\nthat you are on the receiving end of\nsomeone's like\nstupidity that you are on the receiving\nend of like\nthey're making a bad decision because\nthey love you right it's kind of weird\nyeah does that make sense yeah no no\nthat man yeah that does that makes a lot\nof sense\nyeah and so sometimes that's what love\nfeels like so i'd say like take a\nsnapshot\nyou know screencap that and like to feel\nvalued when maybe you yourself didn't\nthink you were worth it\nlike for someone to take a risk on you\nthat may not have worked out\nbut for them to like care about you that\nmuch\nand like put their own financial health\nat stake like for your sake\nit can it's like something that maybe\nlike there's a little bit of likes\nlike you know pity or some something on\nthat\nspectrum in there too does that feel\nright to you\nno i don't think pity i i hate pity\nso much i hate when anyone gives me pity\nso i don't\ni know what i feel that okay okay\num yeah so you know i'd encourage you\npaul to just kind of like\npay attention to that because sometimes\nthat's what love or feeling valued\nor feeling cared for do any of those\nkind of resonate with with maybe what\nyou could you could have felt back then\nlike in terms of when i asked you about\nyour feelings\nno back then i didn't feel cared for at\nall no no i i don't mean back then i\nmean like just a few minutes ago\nlike as we were talking about it\na few weeks ago no sorry sorry a few\nminutes ago\noh um yeah i mean\nlooking back on it yeah they i i i\ni guess that could be what it is like\nthat i felt cared for\nno so i think what's what's happening is\nthat you didn't feel cared for back then\nbut now you're realizing that maybe you\nwere\ncared for yeah\nthat actually that that could be it\nbecause it it it is like uh\ni felt like yeah it's like a positive\nfeeling that i was feeling so\neven though it was like you were having\nlike memories of hurt\nwith a positive feeling in the present\nright yeah that that makes a lot of\nsense that's\nit's crazy to think about like i'm just\nthinking about it it's it's kind of\ncrazy because\ni didn't ever really think like that\never\nwhen i think of i just look at stuff\nlike\nwith black and white honestly with\neverything that i\nlook at and what i think about so i\ndon't so it's\nit's interesting that you you put it\nthat way because it's\nit's uh it really makes me think and\nlike oh maybe that's right\nthat is true yeah\nyeah i mean i think this is you know and\nhow do you come up with likes\nlike how do you know that like how do\nyou come up with that\nuh how do i come up with are you asking\nbecause you want to do this process\nyourself\ndown the road yeah yeah yeah like how do\nyou look at stuff not so\nblack and white with practice\nright so so so this is what what\ntraining is for and this is what\npractice is for\nbut i think that um\nlet me see if i can give you a better\nanswer\nbecause what i'm hearing in that\nquestion is can you teach me to do that\non my own and can we do that again\nyeah is that is that the question yeah\nyeah so let me can i have a second to\nthink about how to teach that to you\nokay\nokay so here's the thing when you're\ngrowing up\nso like let's black and white is fine\nlike that's not a big deal\nso when you're growing up you have a\nconception of things right like if you\nthink about your memory\nyour memory is laid down by a particular\nmind\nso your memories of like you know being\nfrustrated with your parents for like\nputting you on zoloft those memories\nwere like\nsaved to your hard drive by like a 12\nyear old mind\ndoes that make sense yeah it's kind of\nlike if i draw a picture\nof you know a dinosaur and i'm six\nand i have that picture on a piece of\npaper and then i like 20 years later i'm\na great artist\nthe piece of paper with the dinosaurs it\nwas still made up by a six-year-old\nso it's not like as my skill as an\nartist improves\nall of my past pictures get better does\nthat make sense\nso our bizarrely our memories are the\nsame way\nso our memories get laid down\nby the mind that exists at that time\nso it's it's not going to be very easy\nfor me to see it\nother than in black and white because i\nwas so young\nexactly so but now what you can do is\nnow there's like 29 year old paul\nright so you can actually go and revisit\nhuh 26. 20 seconds make me feel old\nsorry um there's there's 26 year old\npaul\n25 paul 24 whatever doesn't really\nmatter\nthere's paul there's the adult paul who\ncan go back\nand revisit those experiences\nbut you're gonna revisit them with your\nadult mind\nand when you revisit them with your\nadult mind there's like actually a\ntechnique to like\ngo through those like experiences again\nright\nso for example like um\nyou know you can and this is this gets\nthis is where things get a little bit\ntricky like\nyou have to really sort of do it in a in\na systematic way where like you can kind\nof say like okay\nwhat happened first what happened next\nwhat happened third\num and there's actually like a technique\nof almost like journaling where you can\njust write down like you know i would\nsay like write down\none page of like a memory that you had\nand then and then you can sort of\nanalyze it with your current mind and\nyou can go through and like look at each\nsentence and\nask yourself what could i have been\nfeeling then what could i have been\nfeeling then what could i have been\nfeeling then what could i have been\nfeeling then\nbecause your memory is going to be like\nanger is going to be each of those\nthings\nright like all your memory is just going\nto be purely of anger\nbut if we think about you know the\nscenario with like pimp in the bathroom\nlike\nthere's like shame there's humiliation\nthere's like\nyou know injustice there are all kinds\nof other emotions\nbesides anger and so as we revisit\nour past experiences we can take that\nsix-year-old's drawing and we can kind\nof like fix it up a little bit and then\nyou'll have a new perspective on it\nthat makes sense i don't know if i'd be\nvery good at that but it\ni guess like you said it's with training\nabsolutely right so when you say i\nwouldn't be very good at it\nare you talking about aptitude or\nexperience\ni mean i guess a little bit of both i i\njust uh so\ntoo yeah i'm not very good with the uh\nwith just like i would have never even\nthought\nabout the word like shame or injustice\nwhen you brought up the pimps\nsituation i would only think of anger\nbecause that you know it's that emotion\nis well\na shameful emotion at least in my\nexperience shame doesn't really\ntranslate well memory as well as anger\nat least\nwell yeah i mean that's that's what i'm\nsaying right so like like it\nwhen you say translate well in memory\nyour memory is going to be\ndominated by experiences of anger and\nthis is where anger is actually a\nprotective emotion\nanger is what protects us from all the\nother negative emotions\nbecause like you know shame is like\nharder to deal with than anger is like\nat least at anger like\nthere's there's like something you can\nlike you know\ndirect your anger at so you don't have\nto look at yourself you don't have to\nfeel ashamed if i'm\npissed at pimp for like you know i get\npissed at him i don't have to feel hurt\nanger is actually what protects us\nagainst hurt\nthat makes sense i mean yeah actually\noh yeah that does make a lot of sense\nbecause shame is i mean that's\nit's probably the worst emotion in the\nworld\nif i could do anything to avoid feeling\nshameful like i would love to\nbut uh what do you do when pity people\npity you paul\ni get angry right i don't like when\npeople\npity me i feel like they\nare i don't know maybe being\ncondescending or something\nyeah right so but what is pity\num when they feel sorry for you yeah\nis that condescending\ni i mean not everyone who does it is\ncondescending but i\nthat's just where my mind goes\nimmediately very good right so i'm gonna\nchange that answer for you a little bit\nit's the way that i feel i feel\ncondescended to\ni feel like people are condescending to\nme when they pity me\ndoes that make sense right yeah and so\nlike when you\nwhen people like pity you like there's\nlike actually\nsome degree of like potential\nvulnerability or hurt there\nis that because like if i like if you\nknow\nif you were in an accident and you broke\nyour leg\nand i felt pity for you like that's not\nnecessarily condescending sometimes pity\ncan be condescending by the way so i\nthink we got to be careful about pity\nbut\nyou know i could feel like compassion or\ni could feel empathy\nthe thing you've got to be careful about\nis that compassion and empathy\nmay feel like pity to you\nyeah that makes sense i uh\ni you know i think what i think i i\nmight feel so bad\nabout when people pity me and i feel\nlike condescended to\nbecause i you know compassion and\nempathies are also\ntwo emotions i have struggled with yep\nso so i can't really\ni can't really um like point it out when\ni see it you know yep\nvery good so i think like let's think\nabout that so one thing is i do think\npity has an\nelement of condescension to it right\nbecause pity is like\noh like when i'm walking down the street\nand i you know there's a beggar\nand then like i have like my you know\nnice clothes and i've got my fancy new\nphone and and\nall this kind of stuff and like oh like\nthis poor beggar like oh\nlike let me like let me pity you like\nit's like i'm i'm up here and i'm i'm\ngonna you know i'm gonna give you\ni'm the hand that's giving and you're\nthe hand that's receiving\nso sometimes with pity there is a power\ndynamic with that emotion does that make\nsense\nyeah i think the thing you've got to be\ncareful about is if you're\ncolorblind to compassion or empathy\nif we think like pity compassion and\nempathy are all going to kind of overlap\nto some degree right the problem is that\nif i'm sending you all three signals but\nyou're only able to see\none then how are you going to respond\nand anger yeah actually that makes a lot\nof sense because\nany time people have tried to console me\ni\ni do get angry because i just i i can't\ndeal with the with those emotions i\neven now i do so bad with it if i feel\nif something bad happens or i feel bad\nand somebody tries to make me feel\nbetter i\ndon't usually respond in a positive way\nyeah that's gotta be that makes sense\nnow cause\nyeah but how do i fix that\nwell so i i think that that's where you\nknow just ignore so this is okay so now\ni'm gonna give you a playbook hold on\none second let me can i\nhave a second to give you a playbook i\njust gotta\nmake it up real quick\nokay\nokay so it starts with you recognizing\nthis [ __ ] guy is being condescending\nto me\nokay so it actually starts because\nthat's a signal that you can detect very\neasily right\nyeah so like when you feel like someone\nis being condescending towards you\nthat's that should be like the you know\nthe\nrunning low on gas light in your car\nlike that should be the signal\nto you okay once you feel that way if\nyou feel like someone is being\ncondescending to you you need to pause\nfor a second\nand then do a little analysis and ask\nyourself\nyou know is this person really being\ncondescending\nif this person were trying to be\ncompassionate\nwhat would they do differently if this\nperson would\nwere trying to be compassionate would i\nbe able to tell the difference\nand and this is where you can also kind\nof use like you know the friend example\nlike\nif you take yourself out of the equation\nif someone's\nyou know dad passed away and then like\nsomeone\nwent to their house and said to them\nlike make it like a third person thing\nso like\nperson a's dad passed away person b\nshows up and\nsays this thing to person a are would\nwould i consider that condescending\nand this is where it's hard because you\nreally have to step out of your shoes\nyou have to really think about the\nscenario\noutside of your experience of it\nand then then you can kind of maybe see\nand it's almost like\nwhat you asked me earlier about like you\nknow how do you do that you kind of step\nout of your own shoes ask yourself\nokay like if this person would be we're\nbeing compassionate what would they do\nand if you can't come up with an answer\nthen like that's kind of an interesting\nclue you may not know what compassion\nlooks like which is you know i'm not\ntrying to be condescending there was\nthat was that condescending\nno i don't know okay okay um but like\nlike you may i i mean you may not know i\ni don't know i just don't know about\nthat\num but you know i'd say that if you if\nyou can't figure out how\ncompassion and condescension would look\ndifferent\nin this scenario then that's a real sign\nthat maybe they're trying to be\ncompassionate\nso step one is recognize the pity and\nanger\nrecognize this the feeling that\nsomeone's being condescended\nrecognize that you're getting pissed so\nif you're pissed okay why am i pissed\nis someone being condescending to me\nokay next question is like\nokay if two people that were not me and\nwere not this person\nwere engaged in this behavior would that\nbe compassion or would that be\ncondescension\nthird thing is\nokay let me just make you following me\nso far\nyeah okay so then third thing is if this\nperson was trying to be compassionate\nwould i be able to recognize that could\ni envision what that looked like\ncould it actually look like\nwhat they're doing does that make sense\nlike what do you mean what it could look\nlike what they're doing\nso like someone's doing something to you\nright that makes you feel like they're\nyou're being they're being condescending\nyeah\nright so let's say i say to you oh paul\nyou poor thing let me buy you some\ndeodorant\nokay right and so so then you can ask\nyourself like okay\ndoes buying does buy deodorant like\ncould that be a sign of compassion\nor is it necessarily condescension\ndoes that does that question make sense\nnow that one makes sense yeah\nright so like and with deodorant it's\nlike well the decent chance that it's\ncondescending\nright yeah but it's like my dad passed\naway someone got me flowers like even\nthough you may feel\ncondescended like people are like\nlooking down on you\nlike i don't need flowers like who the\n[ __ ] do they think i am\nneeding flowers like that's not really\nthat's not really how i feel like\nuh if somebody if something bad happens\nand somebody says\nlike where to get me flowers i mean\nnobody in my family has died so i\ni don't know how i'd feel with that but\nwhen something bad happens um\nyou know like let's say there's like\nsome drama online or something that\nmakes me feel really bad\nand then somebody like my girlfriend\nwants to try and make me feel better\ni won't feel pissed because i'll be like\nwho does she think i am i'll feel more\npissed because\nshe's you know\ni don't know trying like talking in a\nplace where she is not also feeling bad\nso she is trying to give me like i don't\nknow trying to make me feel better just\nmakes me feel pissed\nbecause i feel like they don't i feel\nlike she wouldn't understand how i'm\nfeeling\nso that sort of condescending feeling is\nhow i it's how i feel\ndoes that make sense why do you call\nthat condescension\ni mean i i don't know what else to call\nit so so so you feel like your\nyour girlfriend like doesn't have\nthis the stance to be compassionate\ntowards you or like\nto console you that\nand also i don't like when you know if\nshe's trying to\nconsole me with something she's bringing\nup not just her anyone bringing up bad\nlike the bad memories again that just\nhappened i don't like that either i\ndon't like\nwhen people want to talk about something\nto try to make me feel better because it\nbrings back\nthose negative emotions and i don't\ndo good at dealing with negative\nemotions so i don't even want to go\nthere\nand then so it's like a multi-layered\nthing why i get pissed\ngood i mean it's not good that it's both\nbut it's good i i'm really\nhappy actually um paul because it sounds\nlike you actually have a lot of\ninsight in into why you get pissed\ni mean right even nowadays i still keep\nto myself\nyou know i mean i don't even really talk\nabout things with my girlfriend\num she tries to talk about things with\nme but i just you know\ni kind of just keep to myself i don't\nlet her\nusually i just don't i'm so used to\nkeeping things myself\nthat i that's just what i've come\naccustomed to\nokay so i'm gonna give you step four\nwhich is i think\ntalk to the person that you feel angry\nat for trying to console you\nand this is where you can signal some\nthings to them right you can tell them\nexplicitly\nhey i recognize you're trying to talk to\nme about this\nbut i actually find that talking about\nit like brings up\nmore negative emotions\nright just like you explained to me like\njust share that with them have you tried\ndoing that\nno i usually uh just get angry and i\ntell them to go away\nright so we're gonna like like i know it\nsounds kind of weird paul but we gotta\nlike retrain those neurons\nright so that's not gonna help your\nrelationships it's\nit's a really bad habit i know i just my\nwhole life\n26 years i just have only been to myself\nand that's just\nit you know and then actually when as a\nstrip when i became a streamer\ni definitely couldn't express myself i\ndid not feel comfortable expressing\nmyself to\npeople on a live stream you know\nwhat's your understanding of why you've\nbecome so self-reliant\ni just have trust issues\nwell said right so i i think the way\nthat i would put that i think you have\na lot of reasons to not let other people\nin\ni don't know what you're referring to\nwhen you say trust issues but what i'm\nhearing is a kid who was chronically\nmisunderstood\ngrowing up well when i say trust that\nand\nwhen i say trust issues i mean yeah i\njust don't wanna i\ngive i don't trust anyone else with\nmy feelings i don't know i just don't\nlike i've just had too many bad\nexperiences where i tell someone about\nmy feelings and then i feel\nworse they make me feel worse are you\nfeeling worse now\nno i i prepared myself to\nchat with you so i you know i just\ni have an ex i have an expectation when\ntalking to you so i\ni don't feel bad because i've already\ngave myself that expectation right okay\ndo you feel like you're\nokay so when it comes to your girlfriend\ni do want to give you some concrete\nfeedback here to where like i think\ninstead of\ni think it's fine to push her away but\njust use\nthis language if that makes sense you\nknow just tell her hey\nsometimes like i recognize that you're\ntrying to help me but sometimes it's\nactually like makes things\nmore emotionally difficult i i prefer to\nkind of process on my own\nand you think that is that like i mean\nis that more healthy than me trying to\nfigure out how to\ntalk to her like like i would prefer\nif i didn't get angry bro that is\ntalking to her\nthat's the first step to talking to her\nokay\ndoes that make sense it's like\nwait first i just want to i like\neventually i want to be able to not get\nangry and feel so negative when people\ntry to\nyeah yeah he told me i so i don't want\nto push him away i just can't deal with\nthe\nemotions when you know i just can't deal\nwith them i just get so\nworked up you know yeah so so that that\nactually is the first and most important\nstep right like so if we want to figure\nout\nlike so what i'm hearing from you paul\nis that you and\nthe people that you care about you want\nto be able to move in the direction of\nbeing able to discuss emotional things\nright yeah i want to yeah okay so that\nstarts out\nby figuring out if you want to go\nsomewhere you have to start\nby figuring out where you are\ndoes that make sense like if we're in\nlike south florida like that's where we\ngot to start like sure i want to be in\nthe pacific northwest\nlike that's where i want to go but we\ngot to start where we are\nand so signaling to your girlfriend i\nknow it sounds kind of weird but that's\na way to\nopen up the conversation right so you\ninstead of just pushing her away\nand like jumping into your emotions too\nheavily what's going on\nyou i feel like i just lost you for a\nsecond oh no\nmy microphone is flashing i just want to\nmake sure\num so i think i know it sounds kind of\nweird because it sounds like you're\npushing her away but i don't think it's\nactually pushing her away i think it's\nactually the first step to letting her\nin because you're signaling to her hey\nthis is hard for me\nit's not that i'm mean it's not that i\ndon't care about you it's not that i\ndon't appreciate it\nit's hard for me to be consoled right\nnow\nokay right and and so like like you kind\nof signaling to her like what you can\nhandle\nin a respectful way where you're not\nsaying things that are hurtful\nyou're not lashing out to her that's\ngonna start to lay the foundation for\nlike the next step in communication\nbut if i tell her to go uh to go away\nyou know because i'm not feeling good\nhow do i open myself back\nto that conversation because that's the\nheart\nthat's the hard part yeah but you're not\ntelling her to go away\nright you're just saying it's hard for\nme to talk\nand then and then paul you're brilliant\nbro\nyou say exactly what you just said to me\nwhich is that i want to be able to have\nthis conversation with you\nbut i recognize there's a part of me\nthat's pushing you away but like i don't\nwant to\nbut it's hard for me to like sit with\nthese negative emotions\ndoes that make sense yeah like you can\neven say something like\ni feel myself pushing you away but i\ndon't want to\nhow does that sound i mean that's\nthat's accurate um my only fear is that\ni go back into the conversation and\nyou know then i just get angry during it\nso you share that as well right so you\nsay that you say i'm a\ni want to have this conversation but i'm\nafraid that because it's painful\ni'm going to get angry and i don't want\nto get angry and now i don't know if\nyou've been paying attention paul and\ni'm not trying to be condescending here\nbut that is you have sharing your\nfeelings with her that is like literally\nwhat that is\nyou were doing it at that point does\nthat make sense\nyeah right because like you've shared\nactually a lot with her at that point\nyou want me to recap just or yeah\ni mean no no it's fine i got it it's i\nshared a lot but\nwe haven't shared like the main part of\nit though we've only\nshared how i feel before the\nconversation\nyep good so that's actually how you do\nit\nso like what you do is you start right\nso like if i'm if i'm like let's say\nyou've got\nyou know let's say you have a broken arm\nokay\nso if i'm a doctor and like there's a\nchild with a broken arm i don't start by\ntouching this\ni start by touching this and then i get\ncloser does this hurt no does this hurt\ndoes this hurt\ndoes this hurt does this oh this hurts a\nlittle bit i'm sorry can i just move a\nlittle bit okay that hurts\noh that really hurts oh my god oh that's\nvery painful i'm so sorry\nso you start in a safe zone and then you\nslowly move towards the deep end\nright you got to start in the kiddie\npool and then like\nlike as you guys talk about it and then\nlike this is where\nshe's not gonna feel pushed away because\nyou're sharing with her\nright and then the two of y'all are\ngonna work together about going into the\ndeep end\nmakes sense yeah i mean i i'll\ndefinitely have to try that\nbecause i guess i i keep keep trying to\ngo right into the deep end i think so\nyep\nyou took the thought right out of my\nmind\nyeah you want to teleport right to where\nyou want to go but you got to go slow\npaul right because like if we think\nabout it\nwhy is it so hard for you to connect\nit's because like\nfor like you know the first half of your\nlife\nor even long in the first half of your\nlife like it was hard to let people in\nbecause\nyou didn't know how and they didn't\nunderstand you and they like\nyou know you didn't do anything wrong\nbut they still called you a snitch and\nbullied you like of course you got trust\nissues\nso you have to you have to give yourself\nthe patience\nto build that trust up and it needs to\nbe built up slowly\nyou know you don't you don't like build\nup trust in the 24-hour period right\nlike trust is something it's not like\nyou know it happens slowly\nyeah it makes sense\nrelationships uh are tough i don't know\nhow\npeople i don't know not relationships\nlike boy girl but like you know\nfriendships\nall kinds of relationships it's just\nit's tough i don't i like i wish i could\njust\nit just came naturally to me more like\nmore often but it's\nuh so hard to do\nyeah uh i'm\ncan i share some feelings with you yeah\nso when you say something like that it\nmakes me feel something like pity for\nyou\nright like i i just i think it's sad and\ni'm i'm trying to avoid that feeling but\ni have it\ni kind of like think about your life and\nlike you know\nit sounds like you spawned on hard mode\nlike you're playing the game of life on\nhard mode and so i feel some degree of\nlike\ncompassion towards you how do you feel\nabout that\nwhen you say does that rub you the wrong\nway\num i mean it doesn't i mean it doesn't\nrub me the wrong way i mean i\ni maybe uh on medium because i'm i'm\npretty like privileged\nto like live you know in a nice family\nand stuff so i'm not i don't think\nlike i have a hard life but i had just\nyou know when it comes to like\nmore of deeper emotional stuff that's\nwhen it gets tough\nbut that's not really something i would\nconsider like a hard life\nyeah so let me modify what i said a\nlittle bit you let me know how this\nmakes you feel\nokay so on the one hand paul i i respect\nyou dude i think you're a survivor i\nthink you've\nyou know like it sounds like you had a\nreally challenging upbringing in a lot\nof ways and\nyou actually like worked really hard to\nlike put yourself back together\nthat you've grown into an adult and like\nyou've learned how to do things that did\nnot come\neasily for you that other people take\nfor granted\nfeeling okay with that so far yeah is\nthat fair to say\nfor me to say that and respect you for\nthat\nand at the same time i'm also sad that\nlike you were dealt that hand in the\nfirst place\nyeah i mean that's that's uh i like that\nway better\nyeah so it's kind of interesting because\nlike i can respect your triumph\nand also be like man that sucks that you\nwere in that situation where you had to\ntriumph in the first place\nmakes sense how does that make you feel\ni like that it makes me feel good yeah\nso i just don't like when uh yeah i\ndidn't like the hard mode thing because\nit makes me feel\nlike i'm being in the wrong\nbecause there's people who have these\nemotional\nproblems and their life isn't good\nbecause they\nyou know like i went to that camp that\nbro they had you know these kids were in\nthe same boat as me but they had they\nwere orphans or\nyou know they were going they were in\njail and like they just had way worse\nlives than me so my perspective is so\nwide that yeah i just i i felt\nkind of like i was in the wrong when you\nsaid hard mode\nyeah i can understand that um can i\ndisagree with you there a little bit\ncan i share my experience yeah so i i've\nworked with people who are very\nprivileged and very wealthy\ni've worked in jails i've worked with\nkids\nyou know i've worked at places where\nkids run away on a routine basis let's\njust put it that way\nand what i've come to realize is that no\namount of privilege\nprotects you from suffering that at the\nend of the day in\nin buddha the buddha the guy who founded\nbuddhism you know\nhe sort of said this and he said that\nlike ultimately like suffering is a part\nof the human condition\nand it's been really bizarre because\ni've worked with people who are suicidal\nand like in jail and are going to be\nthere for the next 40 years\nand i've worked with people who just got\npromoted to be ceo of a\nyou know a tech startup out of mit who\nare also suicidal\nand when i really sit with them both of\nthem i don't think that\nyou know does one have more privilege\nabsolutely does one have certain\nbenefits that they should be grateful\nfor\nabsolutely is one's life easier\nabsolutely\nand at the same time in my experience\nsuffering\nand difficulty are not the same thing\nit's kind of weird it's just my\nexperience\nthat that's a good way to put it i like\nthat\ndo you think other people see it that\nway\nbecause i felt like i felt like the bad\nguy there for a second because\ni felt like i was in the wrong for a\nsecond because of how other people would\nperceive it\nwho aren't uh as well put as you\nyou know you're like you you can\nunderstand things probably\na little bit better than the average\nperson\nyeah so i i think that that's a problem\nthat people we seem to be\nkeeping suffering more and more and more\nright we we allow some people to suffer\nand then we get into this like weird\nlike\ncontest about who's the most who's\nallowed to suffer the most\nit's weird you know like it's like at\nthe end of the day paul like\nyou have probably the single worst case\nof school bullying that i've ever heard\nthis whole thing with like pimp in the\nbathroom like i've heard a lot of cases\nof bullying like\nby like you know people like that's the\nworst i mean it's like\n[ __ ] like it's humiliating it's like\nterrifying\nyou know like that's that's so\npsychologically like\nthe bizarre thing and what's even like\nworse is like\nit actually doesn't sound like it was\nthat traumatic for you\ni mean it was pretty it was pretty bad\nif i still remember\ni mean i understand it was pretty bad\nbut just hearing the way you talk about\nit it sounds like\nin the grand scheme of things it was\nmaybe one of the worst things that\nhappened to you\nbut your baseline was like pretty [ __ ]\nyou know you know what's crazy\nthat yeah you know that that was pretty\ntraumatic\nbut compared to i mean well now a day is\nit\nlike i don't know like i have been\nthrough so much worse as a streamer\nthan my childhood bro that yeah getting\npretend\nraped is almost like nothing\nlike you know what i mean and that's\n[ __ ] terrible to say but it's\nit's my scale is so skewed\na [ __ ] up [ __ ] i've been through so\nmuch [ __ ] up [ __ ]\nyep absolutely man and so this is where\ni think at the end of the day\ncomparing suffering i think is a waste\nof everyone's time\nit's not that anyone deserves to suffer\nmore than you are i think the right move\nis to like\nyou know if stuff sucked for you it\nsucked for you and also\nlike if things are worse for other\npeople like have compassion for them and\ntry to help them but like\nthey it doesn't matter whether my life\nwas good or my life is bad i should\nstill have compassion for someone who's\nwhose life is like\nsucks right does that make sense and i\ndon't know why is\nlike societally we've started entangling\nthose two\nlike if my life is bad then i\nit's weird it's like i don't need to\ngive compassion to others\nand if my life is good then i don't\ndeserve to have compassion myself\nit's really weird i just don't think it\nmakes any sense i think you know\nsomeone's life can be terrible and you\nshould be compassionate towards them\nirrespective of how bad your life is\nnow you may not be able to do a whole\nlot right like if you if you're you know\nif you're dealing with trauma or abuse\nor you got diagnosed with cancer and you\nmay not have a whole lot of bandwidth to\ngive\nthat's completely separate but in terms\nof i don't think it's\nyou know i mean it sounds like paul\nyou've had some things that you should\nbe grateful for\nlike you had parents that loved you a\nlot and took out a loan\nto try to help their son get on the\nright track so should you be grateful\nfor that\nabsolutely but did your life\nsuck in some ways absolutely\nand those two don't have to be mutually\nexclusive\nokay yeah i just always i don't know i\njust always feel weird\nlike uh talking about like uh like how\nhard some parts of my life have been\nbecause i just feel like yeah obviously\ni've got a lot of privilege\nand i don't want to overstep my boundary\nhere of\nwhat you know i know that's like weird\nbut i just i put no\nit's i just i don't know i just want to\nmake sure i'm not\nputting myself in a situation where\npeople are going to\nlook at me poorly in that sense at least\ni don't know\nyeah so i i don't know man i i think\nthat you know you got to be a little bit\ncareful about your appearance but\ni don't yeah i mean i i think that if\nthis is your authentic experience then\nthat's your authentic experience like it\nhappened to you\nand if people think that you're like you\nknow pity farming\nyou know i don't get that sense from you\ni i don't you know i think you're just\ni think it just sounds like very\nauthentic to me like\nyeah the whole pity like thing actually\ni never had an issue with\nwith pity as much at least until\ni started streaming the the streaming\nthe\nwhen i first started streaming obviously\ni was very sheltered\nso that it was everything bro and i\nlearned a lot of [ __ ]\nfrom just viewers\ninteracting with me and a lot of it has\nbeen\nnegative um learning and not positive\nlearning\nyou know like i learned to not you know\nfeel bad for myself and [ __ ] which is\nkind of uh paul i just want to pause for\na second so we've been\nuh you know going at this for about an\nhour and a half how are you feeling\ni i mean i feel good i like getting the\nstuff off my chest\ni uh don't know if i'm doing good at it\nor not i'm sorry if uh\ni'm if i'm not but there's\npre-apology.exe\ni just want to make sure that i'm not\nlike uh just dragging things on or\nsomething\nno i i i think that i've i think\ntoday's so far everything we've talked\nabout has been very productive\num the only reason i paused is because i\ni'm recognizing that we haven't even\ntouched streaming yet\nyeah it's i mean i keep it short or i\ncan give you the whole thing\nit's up to you well so that's where\nwhere i i'm\nactually wondering you know i i think i\nactually want the whole thing\num because i i think that's you know i'm\nnot interested in the abbreviated\nversion it's just i\ni mean i imagine that'll be long so you\nknow are you are you good for going for\nlike another hour\nyeah i'm good so tell me about streaming\nokay i mean i don't even know where to\nbegin dude it's it's such a\nall right i mean i guess when i uh first\ngot into streaming um i mean i'm just\ngonna stick to like the whole mental\nhealth and like how i feel part of\nstreaming more so than like\nhow i became a streamer [ __ ] because\npeople you know know that [ __ ] so\num i i don't can you tell me a little\nbit about it\nyeah um well i became a streamer i was\nplaying uh runescape\nwhich is uh you know this game i played\na lot for like ever since i was young\nit was uh game always played so i became\na streamer i started streaming runescape\num and i made youtube videos with it and\nand i you know it was just fun i didn't\ntake it seriously you should just like\nsmoke weed\nafter work and then go live make videos\nand like just troll a little bit on\nrunescape you know i'd have like really\ngood armor and like a really bad\nsituation and\ndie and then i'd be like oh i [ __ ]\ndied and it was just funny\nand um you know people liked it i\nstarted getting a following from that\nand uh\nyou know it was all going pretty well\nfor you know the first like three months\ni think i started in like august 2015.\nwow and yeah i mean that's how\nstreaming started um then irl came out\nand i actually started to move\nmy content to irl or like pokemon go is\nwhat it was back then\non twitch because you couldn't do irl\ntwitch back then but\nand the viewers and everyone really\nloved it i really liked it because you\nknow\nit's [ __ ] crazy because\ni was so isolated and sheltered growing\nup\nand then streamed for you know the first\nfew months\nrunescape and i started to like get out\nof my shell a little bit\nand i started to you know express my\nmy you know my class clown humor on\nstream\nand it really felt like it just was\nright it felt like\nit all led up to this and then when irl\nor like pokemon go came out i really\nenjoyed like\nlike i would never talk to i would have\nnever been\nable to talk to people without the\nstream\ngiving me that validation and i think\nthat really helped me\ni when pokemon go came out the first day\ni streamed it\ni had people in my chat you know giving\nme\ngood validation every time i would talk\nto someone\nand it made me feel comfortable with\ntalking to people for like the first\ntime ever\ncan you tell me what what you mean by\nvalidation and\nwhat they said that made you feel\ncomfortable well\nyou know usually i would be awkward\nyou know with how i talk to people\ngrowing up and\nyou know i could just tell that when i\ntalk to people the conversations are\nkind of like weird and don't go anywhere\nor\nthey're judging me a little bit maybe\nbut when i would stream\nand you know i would talk to people\ndoing irl\nmy chat would just give me they'd just\nbe like oh that was funny\nyou're you know hilarious you're you\nknow that was good\nyou know and i wasn't even trying to\nreally be funny i was just talking to\npeople\nbut i guess my quirky my quirkiness just\nkind of like translated well to the\nstream so\num you know made me feel good so even if\nthe interaction i just had was kind of\nawkward\nthe stream made me feel good and i just\nyou know was able to do it more and more\nuntil i got more comfortable with\nactually talking to people and then i\nyou know but and you know that i learned\nhow to actually have\ndecent conversations because of the\nstreams validation\nhelping me push myself right the very\nfirst ira stream i did\ndude i was so nervous i knew i wanted to\ndo it because i'm like all right this is\ngoing to get\na lot of viewers and it's going to be\nsuper hype because it's a new category\nand i think it'll be fun and um\nyeah i just my heart was being so fast i\nwas so nervous because i never really\ntalked to people\nand then all of a sudden that went so\nwell the first stream like i was so\nhappy dude that i was\nable to talk to people and not feel\njudged like i didn't really care if the\npeople in real life were judging me\ni only cared about the stream\nlike judging me because that was\nwhat i was going out for anyways right\nso\nit was very uh exciting for me when i\nfirst did that irl stream\nbecause i had never done like anything\nlike that before\nlike talking to people and so\nsounds great what where's the\nuh it sounds like things went downhill\nat some point\nyeah i mean obviously obviously\nthat so those feel good feelings you\nknow whatever\nso i started doing irl like every day\nand i started to uh you know and it was\ngoing well and it was going well for\nfor for you know a little bit and um\nbefore i get to the other parts let me\njust say\nthere was this one stream i did on\ntwitch that didn't go so like there\nwasn't it wasn't that in like i went i\nthink i tried gaming\nso i just did iron off like a week\nstraight and then i went back to gaming\nand then the viewers didn't like it so i\nstarted crying on stream\nand got very emotional because all i was\ntrying to do was\njust be accepted by my chat which\nthere's a video of that stream but it's\nit's it was just like a two-minute\nstream of me just\ncrying and saying you know how i felt\nand i\nyou know people gave me good feedback\nwith\nand you know hearts and stuff and i felt\ngood and i felt comfortable with\nexpressing myself actually in you know\nat that moment or like afterward or\nwhatever in that moment i i\nwasn't comfortable but i did it i wasn't\nreading chat but afterward when i read\nthe chat i felt more comfortable and i\nfelt much better\num which and i bring that up now because\nlater on i will tell you why\ni decided to stop opening myself up to\nmy stream\num so yeah but then so let's\nso you know a couple months go by it's\ngoing well irl\nstuff gaming stuff whatever um you know\nthen i got banned on twitch\ni got uh swatted on an airplane i'm not\nsure if you're familiar with what\nhappened\nso i was uh you know i did a stream at\nan airport\nuh waiting for a plane to go to\ndreamhack and um\nyou know and i was very uh what's the\nword like um\nirresponsible with my camera pointing\nand i was just cause back in early 2017\ngetting swatted and like having viewers\nknow where you are wasn't really like an\nissue it was like ira was so new\nit was not it wasn't really an issue and\ni had only ever been swatted\none time before that\nlike way but like way before the plane\nthing it was at my house\nand you know i mean okay whatever that\nit wasn't like a normal thing\nso when i streamed at the airport and i\nstreamed at airports multiple times as\nwell\ni didn't think it was an issue but you\nknow obviously when i ended the stream\nsome viewer uh called the police and\nsaid\ni had a bomb or whatever and you know i\ngot swatted\nuh on the airplane when it landed uh\nlike the cops came in and they like\nquestioned me and stuff\nand you know obviously went on the news\nand\ngot banned on twitch which wait why\nwould you get banned on twitch if\nsomeone's\nswatted i'm confused well i had been\nbanned a few times before so i got\nbanned four times on twitch\nfor uh because for you know because i\nhad tts on right on my streams\nand sometimes by text-to-speech\nso i got banned four times for texas\nspeech because you know\nthey people get around filters and you\nknow offensive things would come through\nand i wouldn't skip it in time so i got\nbanned four times for that\nand then i got banned for accidentally\nleaking someone's phone number\nlike uh i asked for someone like i asked\nfor a girl's phone number i forgot to\nleak the\n[ __ ] microphone so i got banned for\nthat so\ni got banned for getting spotted on the\nplane because obviously i had already a\nhistory i had like five bands before\nthat\nand i think twitch you know saw it as\nbad pr\nthey saw my chat was a little i mean my\ni'm not going to\ncookie cutter it my chat was pretty\n[ __ ] like\nridiculous you know what i mean like\nthey were spammy as hell they could be\ntoxic they could be like\nyou know pretty [ __ ] bad so\ni think twitch just was like just you\nknow they just banned me\nbecause i uh and i will say i was pretty\nirresponsible with the\nway i was streaming i was like showing\nwhat flight i was going on and stuff\nwith you know in hindsight it's easy to\nsay oh that was stupid but in the moment\nlike i said getting slotted wasn't\nreally a normal thing\nso i didn't even think that was gonna\nhappen so yeah i got banned for\nobviously uh i'm gonna assume\ni don't really i don't really know\nbut i think it's because i was being\nirresponsible with\nshowing where i was and stuff so let me\nask you a quick question\npaul what's your understanding i mean so\nyou were saying that your community it\nseems like you know they were\ntrolls yeah you know um\nwhat's your understanding of of how your\ncommunity got to be that way\ni uh i didn't moderate my chat i mean\nthat's as simple as that you know i\nenjoyed the validation that my viewers\nare giving me\nyou know i've never had anything like\nthis before so i was very afraid to lose\nit\nso i and what kinds of things would they\nvalidate\num i mean you know if i was funny on\nstream\nif i was uh you know just saying jokes\nand\nyou know obviously i would say offensive\njokes too\nuh back when i was in my early twenties\noffensive humor and like shock humor was\nlike\nuh i don't know i found it funny i mean\nyou know i'm\ni've heard now obviously but i'm not\ngonna like\nlie i found it funny so i would do it\nyou know and i'd say shocking things and\noffensive things\num and the chat found it funny and you\nknow and\nso it's kind of like the class clown\nhumor right you say\nsomething in class that's like kind of\nshocking the teacher would get mad\ni mean it kind of just carried over i\nguess but\nbut the viewers yeah they validated it\nand then they they enjoyed it so\nyou know i was so afraid to lose anybody\ni didn't want to lose a single viewer\nbecause i just felt so good that i\nfinally had people that liked me\nso i didn't ban or moderate anything\nwhich is a mistake how do you understand\nwhy you felt so\ngood why were you so afraid to lose a\nsingle viewer\nhow do i explain why i felt so good yeah\nlike well like help me understand why\nyou were afraid to ban a single viewer\ni just didn't i was just afraid of like\npeople not liking me anymore and\njust going away and then i'd be alone\nagain i really didn't like being alone\nand i really like for the first time saw\nwhat it's like to be liked\nand not be alone and you know\ni just wanted to cherish that because it\nwas very\nvaluable to me and i i was you know a\ndude i was 21\n22 when i first i was 21 no i was 20\nwhen i first started streaming\n21 when i really blew up so i was young\nand just\nno life experience or anything i just\ndidn't know that\nyou know surrounding myself with\nuh bad validation was even a thing\nwhat do you mean by bad validation\ni just you know i mean so you there's\nthere's\ni mean how do i explain it there's\nokay so you have if i have a viewer in\nthe chat who's uh\nsaying stupid things that uh\nlike saying uh making fun of me or\nsomething or laughing when i do\nsomething stupid\nlaughing at me more than with me that's\nlike bad validation\nbecause he's still in my chat and he's\nstill laughing but he's not laughing for\nthe good\nfor good reasons and i couldn't really\ndifferentiate the difference there\nbetween\ngood and bad validation so i just kept\neveryone because i didn't want to lose\nanyone because i thought they\ncared about me i thought they were there\nfor me\nbut um so i you know i was just very\nafraid to moderate anything\nso i'm kind of hearing a couple things\ncan i\njust repeat back to you and just make\nsure i'm on the same page so\nyou know we heard a lot about your early\nlife um\nexcuse me one second\nso we heard a lot about your early life\nand and uh\nyou know it sounds like you were not\nvery well understood\nsounds like you were pretty alone in a\nlot of ways\nand then here comes twitch to the rescue\nwhich it does so many times and and so\nyou know there's there's a sense of\ncommunity there's a sense of connection\nyou get to be the class clown again and\nthen like twitch loves that\nright like we love class clowns and so i\ni'm getting the sense that you started\nto cultivate\na particularly you know risk like kind\nof risque\nattitude telling kind of offensive jokes\nwhich you thought were funny like\npeople liked you because you know you\nwere the guy who\nwouldn't be so pc started to cultivate a\nparticular kind of community that would\nrepeatedly say inappropriate things in\ntext-to-speech\nmaybe you weren't so keen on moderating\nthem because you really\nfound that like it's it's almost like\nyou you become kind of\ni use this word a little bit carefully\nbut almost dependent on the validation\ni mean i was hearing you kind of say\nthat you know you would do things that\nor that their validation would allow you\nto do things that\nthat paul couldn't do and ice poseidon\nbecame someone different from paul\npaul had trouble talking to people but\nlike ice poseidon was like\ntotally cool to talk to people like had\nfriends like\nis that fair or or is that kinda\ni mean i don't wanna i don't think it's\nfair to take the blame off of me\nand put it onto my persona but\nyes you're right but i just want to make\nsure you\nlike i just want you to know that i'm\nthat doesn't take the blame away from me\npersonally does is what i said\ndoes that assign the blame somewhere\nwell\ni mean no i don't think so but\ni'm just uh so\nused to\ni'm just so used to getting judged man\nabout\nlike uh how i how i'm supposed to feel\nand [ __ ]\ni just feel like i have to just say that\ni don't know okay\nwhat would happen if you didn't say that\ni just feel like people would\nsay that i'm just you know deflecting uh\nmy responsibilities or something i don't\nknow i don't\nthink so but i just thought i would say\nthat to see how\nwhat what your reaction would be i\nsuppose i mean so here's what i have\npaul if we're going to talk about blame\ni think you and twitch\nso this is this i mean you know there's\na part of me that loves it too but i\nthink a lot of times there are marriages\nmade in hell\nand and that's what this sounds like to\nme it sounds like you were the class\nclown\nyou were also a champion of sorts and\nthey loved you for it and you loved to\nbe loved for it\nand i i'm kind of hearing you know you\ndidn't moderate things but at the same\ntime you're not the one that was\nyou know making the text-to-speech\ndonations i think you just cultivated a\nparticular kind of culture\nand everyone was sort of happy with that\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i mean yeah my humor was edgy and\nuh\nmy chat you know therefore got edgy and\nyeah i mean that was uh\nyeah essentially yes yeah i mean do you\nfeel blamed enough by what i said\nis that fair in terms of judgment yeah\nthat's that's fair\ni mean i i think this really sounds to\nme like a situation where\nyou know there was a lot of like\ncultivation or evolution\nof something it started in one place and\nthen it got like a little bit worse and\na little bit worse and a little bit\nworse and a little bit worse\ni never you know i never i never wanted\nit to be like\ni never wanted to make a [ __ ] edgy\nsort of like\nthing but uh just you know obviously i\njust didn't know what the [ __ ] up do my\ni didn't know what i was doing my\nchannel i went from\n400 viewers i'll say it i went from\n100 viewers to 20 000 in like\ntwo months or like i mean overnight\nessentially dude\ni mean it was literally overnight and i\nhad no guidance\nit was just i'm just by myself\nand i had to just figure everything else\neverything out on my own\nand i'm just like this sheltered kid so\nit was tough dude\nit was not easy and i just you know fell\ninto the wrong\nsort of environment yeah i i've noticed\npaul that um when people blow up it's\npsychologically\nvery difficult and and you know\nthere's a lot of good that comes with it\nbut also like a lot of\ndanger that comes with blowing up um\nso i've heard that story again a lot of\ntimes it manifests as imposter syndrome\nto where people like i don't understand\nwhy\nyou know these 1900 19 900 people like\nwhere they came from\nbecause i was used to that original 100\num but anyway so it sounds like you got\nbanned for\nto twitch i got banned for twitch for\nyou know\nhaving this like cultivating like just a\nbad community i'm quite sure\num the plane thing was just like icing\non the cake\num so and then i went over to youtube\num i know i was very upset\nwhen this happened obviously because\ni didn't know what the [ __ ] to do bro i\nwas so scared\nof being alone again and going back to\nbeing this just sheltered misunderstood\nperson\nso i you know i i made a video and i\nsaid i'm gonna be streaming on youtube\num criticized twitch and and and how\nthey banned me\nwhich now looking at it i get where they\nwere coming from so i\nyou know i took that video down because\nthat's not fair\ncriticism in my opinion that i had on\nthem\nbut um started streaming on youtube\nand you know i said this one thing that\nwas very\num like just the worst mistake of my\nlife\nhonestly because if you think it's bad\nit hasn't even bro\nyoutube my youtube career that's when\nstreaming got\nridiculous like in terms of uh how\nbad it really got um i said this one\nthing and it really just it\ni should have never said it i literally\nsaid um\nall right i want you guys to control my\nlife i said that to my viewers and that\nwas the worst [ __ ] mistake of my life\ndude\nbecause that that's not good that\nbecause i realize now\nviewers don't have your best intention\nand you know you're just\nentertainment and or like a very un\nor like a parasocial relationship to a\nlot of viewers\nin like some unhealthy way and i learned\nthat i learned all that [ __ ] the hard\nway man\nso i had this reddit that had you know\nthose very popular\nand had you know 100 000 members on it\nand that reddit was who i was talking to\nthe\nmy reddit would control my life\nessentially\nis what i told them and if anything that\ngets upvoted to the top\ni would do and you know they\nthat's it you know i was so afraid of\nlosing\nthese people that i just gave them full\npower so they wouldn't go anywhere\nand uh yeah so then\nthe next year or so i mean it just it\ngot it just got real bad\num the viewers were very uh\nyou know even now i have a hard time\ntalking about this because\nit's it's i just feel like a lot of\nuh like it's hard to know\nif i like if what i'm saying is even\naccurate or not\nnot accurate and what happened but\naccurate in how i feel\nlike i feel like now in hindsight that i\nwas being gaslighted\nby my reddit and that sounds [ __ ]\ninsane\nbut i think i was because they would\nupvote something\ni would do it and then they would tell\nme they would upload another post saying\ni'm a\n[ __ ] [ __ ] for doing that and that\ni should apologize\nto them and then i would apologize\nand like cry on stream and say i'm sorry\nand then it'd be like not good enough\ndoes that make sense like it just got it\ngot very bad bro where like the viewers\nsome a lot of the viewers got very\nentitled and they started and i just\nonly did i did my best\nto just try and make everyone happy\nbut i think a lot of viewers took\nadvantage of that and it made me feel\nreally bad\nand it really [ __ ] in my head for a\nlong time\nand that was a huge mistake i should\nhave never given\nyou know my viewers such power over me\nwhat what made what were what were you\ndo you remember what you were thinking\nand feeling when you sort of put that\noffer out there that they get to control\nyour life\ni was just scared that was the first\nstream on youtube that i did\ni was just scared i didn't want to lose\nyou know\nthis this like magical gift that i was\ngiven\nbecause it i i dude i was alone my\nentire life\nand this was like something\nthat's like a dream come true you know\nlike people like me\npeople like want to see me like i've\nnever had that before\nso i just was so worried about it that i\nwas just like i'm just gonna give them\neverything i'm gonna give them my\nliterally the key to my heart everything\nyou know and that was that was bad\nand and so the reason you were giving\nthem everything is because\nyou had you were living a life that you\nknow\ni'm just trying to understand for a\nsecond you know it's it's like when\ni i can envision that when you were\ngrowing up there was like your life and\nthere were like normal lives\nright like people had friends and people\nwere liked and people were appreciated\nand then there was paul\nwho is in the special school and and you\nknow taken to doctors and put on zoloft\nand put on adhd medicine\nthere's the paul that we were kind of\nsaying like what do we do with you\nand then suddenly like twitch and\nyoutube you were kind of\nyou did this for a while on twitch and\nthen you were afraid of losing everyone\nand so you kind of gave them power over\nyour life\nanything to not have them leave is that\nfair to say\nyeah because when i mean when i got\nbanned on twitch\nno youtube live streaming wasn't a thing\nreally\nlike i was i don't even know who else is\nstreaming on youtube i think\nyeah i have no idea i think i remember\nlike just nobody was streaming on\neveryone who ever whoever got banned on\ntwitch their career was done\nfor streaming so\ni was so scared of yeah of being like\njust back to being alone so yeah i did\nlike i went\nto the extremes on youtube so i could\nkeep these people\nand so they don't leave and go back to\ntwitch and like leave\nand you know whatever i'm alone so yeah\ni gave them\nfull power and so when they would post\nsomething on reddit how would you feel\nlike what would they ask you to do\ni mean it would just be like content\nideas and stuff but um\nand i would feel fine for i mean for\nthat obviously\num but when they would uh\nwhen the reddit would upvote stuff\nthat would make me feel bad\nwhen it when i didn't do anything that\nlike\nbut there was this one such i mean i'm\nnot bringing i'm not gonna say names but\nthere was this one situation\nwith two girls and one\nof them i went on a date for the stream\ni didn't really want to date them i just\nwent on a date with them for the stream\nfor content\nbecause my reddit upvoted it\nand said i should do that but i didn't\nreally want to\nand i actually had this other girl that\ni was friends with\nthat i liked and wanted to actually you\nknow\npursue her instead but\nyou know and and i went on so i did the\ndate with the with the stream girl\nand the viewers found you know found out\nthat i\nactually was pursuing this other girl\nyou know because uh like off stream\nbecause\nyou know and and but and they\nthey they were so upset by it they\ndidn't you know\nto me the stream did the date on stream\nwas just content to me\nbut to the viewers it was\nlike they're watching me actually date\nsomeone\nand they were upset and they they they\nwere like\noh he's gonna be he's like cheating on\nher he's like he's such a piece of [ __ ]\nhe's [ __ ] this and that and i'm just\nlike oh [ __ ]\nand because i said i gave i you know the\nviewers control my life\nso i ended up going live that night like\ncrying and i was just like i'm so sorry\ni you know i didn't mean to do this i\nplease forgive me\nand i ended up putting myself in a\nsituation where i\ntemporarily tried to date this\nstream girl that i didn't even like\nfor the viewers you know because they\ntold me to\nand that was a very uh awkward situation\nto be in and um i'm just\nit's just kind of i'm just trying to\nlike put it all together so i'm like\nstuttering a little bit but\nwell yeah paul i'm i'm so\nthis may sound like a silly question but\nyou know\nwhy did you have to do that\ni i don't know i just felt like they\nwere gonna\nleave and i was gonna be alone again so\ni put my so i did that\nyou know i i told my viewers that they\nwould control my life\nso i that's what it is that's what\nhappened and that was the worst mistake\never\nbecause if i ever wanted to do anything\nthat i wanted to do i couldn't\nand if i ever tried they would\nyou know [ __ ] on me in my chat on reddit\nthey would make me feel\nso bad they would they would you know\nthey would just\nmake me you know say i'm a scumbag and\nall this [ __ ]\nand to them it's memes but to me you\nknow these are my feelings my feelings\naren't memes\ni couldn't say that though i could never\nexpress myself\nto my viewers and i'll tell you why\nwhen i went live apologizing for you\nknow pursuing the wrong\ngirl that the stream didn't tell me to\num they were just they just\nthey just used it against me they used\nmy the feelings against me and they\nwould\nrepost the picture of me crying over and\nover and over\nwith like captions that they thought\nwere funny and\nbut to me it like really hurt me and it\nreally like upset me\nand it really and and unfortunately i\ndidn't know how to deal\nwith these with this situation and these\nemotions\nso i just totally started throwing\neveryone under the bus\nlike you know the girls that i was\npursuing um\nthe girls pursuing uh and then the girl\nthat i was i\nstated on stream i just\nliterally tried throwing them under the\nbus\nso i was pursuing this girl that i liked\nright\nand since the stream didn't want me to\ni went live and apologized for pursuing\nher\nwhich was bad because obviously it would\nmake her feel bad too\nand it would make my viewers lash out at\nher\nso that was the wrong move on my behalf\ni should have taken\nresponsibility and just been like no i\nlike this other person\nand i you know i shouldn't have played\npretend with my stream\nbut at like i said they i gave them\ncontrol\nof my life and i would do everything so\nyeah so that's how that situation went\nso i after i was like all right crying\non stream\nletting out my emotions to my viewers\nbad move they're gonna just use it\nagainst me\nand you know post photos and and\nwhatever\nand make me feel bad so i stopped doing\nthat that's why i keep saying\ni don't like to express myself with the\nlike on streams typically because\neven now it's like kind of hard for me\nto say this because i have so so\nengraved in my head that\nsomebody's gonna use it against me that\nis it's\nit's hard you know i mean i think you've\nlearned that lesson\nyeah i mean i i have but uh\nso it didn't end i\ni i also let viewers come to stream\nsnipe me in real life\nyou know what stream sniping means yeah\ni thought that was but when you're\ncompeting in a game right and they're\nwatching your stuff\nbut this it also goes to real life as\nwell so i'm doing a\nirl stream and they would you know\nviewer would come up to me in person and\nyou know say hi to me and that's fine\ni've enjoyed that i enjoy meeting the\nviewers\nsaying hi to them that's great what i\ndidn't enjoy\nwas viewers coming to my house and\nspying on me through my window\nand recording my conversations in\nprivate and posting them on reddit and\nthings like that\nbut i couldn't say that because if i\never tried to say oh i don't i don't\nlike\nyou doing this don't do it of course my\nviewers would be upset that i'm defying\nthem\nso you know i would never say anything\nlike that but yeah my boundaries\nthere was no boundary viewers would i\nwould leave my door unlocked\nand i would let viewers walk in my house\nas i'm sleeping and i'd wake up and\nthere'd be seven people sitting on my\ncouch\nthat i have no idea who they are and\nthen they'd [ __ ] cheer and be like\nyeah\nhe's awake and you know i mean it would\nkind of\nmake me feel a little uh\nweird obviously i'd be like i don't know\nif i like this\nbut i just i just rolled with it you\nknow wow\nwhy wouldn't you lock your door\noh no i just was so i i when i\nwhen i said that i was gonna let the\nviewers control my life i meant it dude\ni don't want you i don't want you to\nunderestimate how much\nfear i had inside of me when i got\nbanned bro\nand i wanted to not lose\nanything and be alone again\nso i went to the absolute extreme to\nmake sure\ni stood out enough that viewers weren't\ngoing to leave me\nso it's interesting paul because usually\nwhen i think about\nyou know really extreme circumstances a\nlot of people will talk about\nnegative emotions like i did it because\ni was afraid\num but sometimes there's actually like\nother reasons\nright there can actually be like\npositive things so like when i think\nabout\nfor example people who stay in abusive\nrelationships\num which it sounds weird but it sounds\nlike you were in a an abusive\nrelationship with your viewers\num i mean because what you're describing\nstuff\nlike if you weren't if you were using if\nyou replaced the word viewers\nor reddit with like you know someone's\nname\nand you just told the story like it you\nknow\nlike you know what's weird yeah the\nweird the weird thing is\nthe viewers didn't hate me they liked me\nyeah so so i i don't think that's weird\nso this is kind of what i was saying is\nis that like you know a lot of times\nwhen you talk to people in abusive\nrelationships they'll talk about like\nfear is the reason they stay in the\nrelationship but a lot of times\nactually the more i've really come to\nunderstand abusive relationships like\noftentimes actually there's something\neven more powerful than fear which is\nsome kind of\nother driver like sometimes love causes\npeople to stay in an abusive\nrelationship\nlike you know the hope that this person\nwill change\nwill cause them to stay in a\nrelationship the fact that they love\nthis person the fact that they built a\nlife with\nthem you know i've seen abusive\nrelationships that will last for 40\nyears\nand when we really think about why does\nsomeone stay in that relationship\nit's not out of fear i mean sure fear is\na big part of it\nbut it can actually i think that things\nthat really get people stuck\nare oftentimes positive emotions or like\nyou know\nsome kind of positive value do you think\nyou were getting something\nout of this yeah i mean\nof course you know i got a lot of\nviewers\nyou know made money of course i got\nsomething out of it\ni just um went about i just think i\ni dropped my boundaries way too much\nbecause in the end like\nit's self-destructive you know and then\nthey come there comes a certain point\nwhere\nyou can't keep up anymore man like like\nat a certain point i couldn't keep up\nwith the with what my viewers wanted\nand then they want\ni mean okay i mean this is going to be\nreally tough to\ntalk about and i really don't like\ntalking about it because people like to\nmake memes about it but i'll you know\ni'll talk about it but you don't have to\ntalk about it\nwell i but i will though because that\nthey use\ni wonder if you're making the same\nmistake now\nthat you were back then which is like if\nthere's a boundary\nmaybe you should just respect that\nboundary instead of sacrificing yourself\nfor the sake of answering my question\nwhat do you think about that\ni mean i i'm very curious but like\nthat's my curiosity right because it's\nlike\ni mean i wouldn't say anything that i'm\nuncomfortable with\ni am comfortable with talking to you\nabout this stuff now because\nit's all of that stuff's in the past i'm\ntalking about this from like a past\ntense sort of thing okay um\nlike in the past talking about this\nwould would have been like really tough\nand it's still tough now but i'm not\nafraid to talk about it anymore before i\nwould have been afraid to talk about it\num so let me ask you explicitly before\nwe continue\ndo you feel like talking about this\nwould be lowering your boundary or\nviolating an internal boundary that you\nwant to hold\nfor the sake of the interview or the\ncontent or whatever like\nyou know because i don't want to fall\ninto that same pattern\nno because i'm not gonna like no names\nor anything like i'm not gonna get\n100 detail just what i'm comfortable\nbut um so my ex-girlfriend i\nyou know i you know i liked her right\nand uh\nthe stream didn't like her i don't know\nif you've ever seen these sort of\nrelationships before\nbut um so for the first\nuh six months or so of dating\nthis girl um my viewers would just [ __ ]\non me\nconstantly for six months non-stop [ __ ]\non me [ __ ] on her [ __ ] on\nanything i did everyone around her\nbecause they didn't like her that's not\nwho\nthey wanted me to date that's who i\nwanted to date but that's not who they\nwanted me to date\nso but and this was the first time i've\ndefied i defied my viewers\ni dated this this girl and i didn't care\nwhat the viewer said\nand that caused my life to be a living\n[ __ ] hell for\nsix or seven months house\nwhat's that how so\ni mean the viewers would you know i mean\nthey would just\nyeah like the the chat the dislikes\nthe reddit everything they would just\nsay [ __ ] you ice\nyou're a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] you're\ndating this person this person's [ __ ]\nawful [ __ ] [ __ ] you [ __ ] that like they\njust didn't like\nwho i was dating so they lashed out at\nme constantly which made all my streams\nawful\nbecause i'm not going to be able to be\nhappy\nand positive on stream if i'm getting my\nwhole chat\n[ __ ] on me and my whole community\n[ __ ] on me so it'd be a constant\nbattle between me and my community\nof me defending myself and oh if i want\nto date this person i can date this\nperson in my chat\nsaying [ __ ] you you can't date this\n[ __ ] person\nit was just a bad toxic situation an\nenvironment that i was in\nso instead of and i tried i tried really\nhard to hold my\nmy own and hold my gut for seven months\ni just couldn't take it anymore so what\ni ended up doing was\nhiding the relationship for my viewers\nand this is where i got really bad dude\nbecause now i'm living a [ __ ] like a\nsecond life\ni have my i'm like my stream life\nwhere my viewers think i'm single and\nthen i have my actual life where i'm\ngoing\nand i'm seeing this this girl\nand i lived in constant fear of getting\nspotted in public\nwith with her of just whatever you know\nso it that relationship ended up\ngoing really really bad and turning very\nbad because of\nbecause of me you know it's not her\nfault\nit's because of me i literally was\nafraid to leave the house with her\nso it ended up turning into a very just\nnot a good relationship dude\num very uh\ni started treating her poorly because i\nwas\nyou know just not like poorly as in\ncalling her names and stuff i treated\nher poorly as in\nif we're gonna leave the house you have\nto put a hood on and like a mask and\n[ __ ] like it's just\ni was just scared bro and um\nit just wasn't good and one and then my\nviewers eventually found out\nthat i was dating her and let me tell\nyou that was just awful\nit was i mean she got completely\nharassed i got\ncompletely harassed and i made such a\ndumb [ __ ] mistake\nof just completely just i mean i like\nthrew under the bus dude i'm like oh i'm\nnot dating her\nbecause i didn't know what to do and i\nwas so upset\nand so like worried about just\nlosing the viewers and being alone again\ni just you know i just did really really\nuh made some really bad\nmistakes i you know and and i lost her\nuh respect i lost the viewers respect i\nlost everyone's [ __ ] respect\nyou know the viewers were upset because\ni was hiding this relationship for like\nseven months\nmy ex-girlfriend obviously uh\nyou know thought it was [ __ ] [ __ ]\nand unfair to her which it clearly was\nand i was uh just yeah\njust bad bad moves all around\nand then after that of course it just\nwas never the same my viewers just\ntreated me like [ __ ]\nand had no respect for me for so long\nuntil my read until i closed my reddit\nwhat do you think about that\ni mean i i made a mistake you know i\nmade mistakes i\ni should have never dropped the boundary\nboundaries between me and my viewers\nit was it only led to bad things nothing\ngood came from it\nbecause in hindsight i think the viewers\nwould have still watched me\nwith the boundaries i didn't need to\ndrop those boundaries\ni just did because i was scared like i\ncultivated\nthis abusive relationship between me and\nmy viewers\nand i need and that's not what i meant\nto do i was just trying to grow our bond\nby doing that i'll be the only streamer\nto let the viewers come into his house\nand whatever but\nthe it got toxic because the viewers\nwanted full control and they they\nwanted you know and i can't i'm not a\nrobot i live my own life too\nwell i can i can kind of see it's it's\nreally interesting to hear\nyou because\nyou know how you were saying that that\nwe were talking about apology.exe\nand and how you because you do\nexplicitly own uh\nup to a lot of this you say you know it\nwas my fault my mistake i did this\ni did this i cultivated this abusive\nrelationship\num you know it's kind of interesting\nbecause\ni i can see what you're saying it's\nalmost like a this too\nhas been kind of an evolution of you\nbeing judged\nover and over and over again does that\nmake sense\nyeah i mean i'm i'm just uh\ni think where this like where it comes\nfrom me like constantly\ntrying to own up the stuff is the reddit\nwould always say i'm not owning up to\nanything\nand and now this is kind of interesting\nbecause i'm i'm beginning to understand\ni think\nwhy they think you don't own up to\nthings\nthis is going to sound kind of weird\nbecause even as i hear you explain\nthings there's a part of me that feels\nsome degree of doubt and i was really\nsurprised by that\nright well so like there's something\nactually i know it sounds kind of weird\ndude so i'm just going to be straight\nthere's something about what you're\nsaying that feels very bs-like to me\nokay and then i got really confused\nbecause i was like he's clearly owning\nup to things he's clearly taking\nresponsibility for it he recognizes he\nmakes mistakes\nhe's gotten he's become very insightful\nso why is my bs meter going off a little\nbit\ndoes that make sense it does\nand and so i want to share something\nwith you and i wonder if actually if\nthis has something to do with\num you know whether you have asperger's\nor not\nin sort of the way that you've learned\nto apologize\num because i i do think that there are a\ncouple of things that are kind of\ninteresting about your apologies one is\nthat\nyou tend to own up to something and then\nyou\nsay because and then you cite\na negative emotion that was controlling\nyou\nso you're like i cultivated this abusive\nrelationship because i was afraid\ndoes that make does that construction\nmake sense yeah\n100 owning a mistake\nbecause negative emotion\nand and i think you you've got to be\ncareful about that because while i can\ncompletely understand that that's true\ni think if i say oh yeah um\nyou know i i hit my dog\nbecause i was angry and so it's like\nyeah that can be true but when you sort\nof like cite a negative emotion as\ncontrolling you\ni think there's a sense of like\nabsolving yourself of responsibility\nthere\nit's not you it was the fear that made\nyou do it the fear made me do it the\nfear made me do it the fear made me do\nit\nand i can understand that 100 because i\nthink that's actually how human beings\nwork\nbut i'm just sort of sharing that with\nyou because i think that that that\nmay you know is is it you\nor is it the fear like what's really\nresponsible here what do you think\ni mean yeah the the fear comes from me\nso when i say fear i\njust you know that's like that's me\nlike i'm the fear you know well so yeah\nthe re\nwhat's your understanding of why i'm\nsharing this with you\num i mean you're saying that i'm just\nbad at apologies\nuh honestly that i'm glad that that's\nthe way that you interpreted it because\nwhat i was afraid of is that you would\ninterpret what i was saying is like i'm\ncalling bs\ni don't think you're bad at apologies i\nthink that you have a particular way of\napologizing which i was trying to figure\nout like\nwhy do people judge you so harshly like\nwhat's going on there because i think\nthat's\na little bit of a two-way relationship\nas well you know because clearly like\nyou're owning up to what you've done\nright like i'm not getting the sense\nthat you're\nyou know in denial or anything but so\nthat then the question becomes if you're\nnot in denial then then what\nyou know why do people react to you this\nway and even more shockingly\nwhy do i feel like reacting to you in\nthat way right\nit's like what the yeah because the\nguy's like clearly like he's like you\nknow i threw people under the bus like i\nshouldn't have done this like i lowered\nmy boundaries that was a mistake like i\nwas afraid of losing it sounds like very\ninsightful\num you know it sounds like you've you've\nkind of paid attention a lot and you've\ndone a lot of reflection\nhow would i apologize without saying\nit's the negative emotions because i\nmean\ni didn't do it for no reason\nyeah so that's that's a good question so\nso i mean so let me\nexplain something to you like like like\nwhat are you sorry for something\ni mean i'm sorry for the\nyou know the people i threw under the\nbus yeah but uh\ni'm not really sorry for the cultivation\nof that\nyou know of the toxic community that\ni've that i made because\ni'm past that now and it was affecting\nme\nthe most who am i going to apologize to\nmyself\ni mean i guess i it's not the toxic\ncommunity\nthat made me like throw people under the\nbus so i'm not going to apologize\nfor that in particular i just apologize\nlike it's my own actions that\ndid that because i was\ngoing through so much intense\nthings and there i said the because\nagain but\nyou see that you're doing great until\nyou said the because\nso if and and i i think i know it sounds\nkind of weird but like\ni think in a weird way like you not\napologizing for a piece of it felt very\nauthentic to me\nyou know like because because you know\nand this is subtle but like\nyou say i made a mistake i haven't heard\nyou say i'm sorry\nright so i think that's the other thing\nthat people may be sniffing out is bs\nand part of the reason that you get\njudged\nbecause if you're not sorry for\nsomething paul i think you should just\nown up to it and that felt authentic\nlike i'm with you 100\nif you're like i screwed up but i don't\nregret it for it for a minute\nthe only thing that i regret is that\nwhile i was screwing up i threw some\npeople under the bus and that wasn't\nfair to them\nthat sounds very authentic that doesn't\nset off my bs meter\nbut when you say i made a mistake i made\na mistake now i'm sort of picking up\nanother piece because you're not sorry\nand generally speaking we assume that\npeople who make mistakes are sorry that\nthey made mistakes but you're not sorry\nso that makes perfect sense now i don't\nblame you for it are you\ni mean i'm you know in like a weird way\ni'm kind of glad it all happened because\ni'm\ni i have learned a lot like if i didn't\ngo through this\ni wouldn't have like i don't know dude i\nwould just be\nso skewed in perspective to so many\nthings because yeah you know i went from\nsheltered\nto 20 000 viewers if i never had any of\nthose experiences\nand everything was just positive i would\njust be a [ __ ] skewed person i don't\nknow\nlike i needed to get perspective\nsomewhere right\nyeah so and you know unfortunately i\nwent\nthrough it really intense ways\nbut so be it you know yeah so that feels\nvery authentic to me\nso be it feels far more than because i i\ndon't i didn't really hear you\ni think i i get what so paul do you get\nthat i'm sharing this with you because i\ni'm hoping that we can get some insight\ninto\nyou know how you put your words together\nand how people respond to them\nthat's why i'm not trying to like call\nyou out or anything like that are you\ngetting that sense\nyeah okay and if people are you know end\nup watching this i i don't want them to\nyou know the last thing that i'd want to\ndo is reignite all of your haters\ni think it's in a weird way this this\ni'm having this conversation with you in\nthe same way\nthat i was having the conversation with\nyou about feelings\nwhich is uh and like you know how you\ntalk to your girlfriend about how\ncertain conversations are hard for you\nit's just for us to recognize that when\nwe communicate in a certain way\nwhy do we set people off like because i\nthink there's something about you\npaul that that is interesting because\nyou say i made a bunch of mistakes but\nif you don't feel sorry\ni think that's going to really frustrate\na lot of people\nbecause what they're here yeah it's\nit's also i don't know it's just\nyeah the the sorry thing it's it's it's\ni'm just not good with like expressing\nmy emotions as i said earlier so it just\nyeah it comes off weird i can i know\nyeah i think there's a little bit of a\ndisconnect because most people\nwhen someone says i made a mistake and\nit was my fault\nempathically they expect\nan emotion of i'm sorry with that but i\ndon't get i don't get that from you\nyeah i get no that's you know now that\nyou think about it\nthat's probably why anytime i've ever\ncried on stream i just had a terrible\nresponse\nexcept for the first time the first time\nwas authentic\never the one on twitch than the ones on\nyoutube\nlike when i was crying because i wanted\nto date someone else but i went on this\nother girl's date for content\nlike i wasn't really sorry i just said\nthat\nbecause i you know the viewers were\nsupposed to be controlling me so\nyou know but actually i could see why\nthey totally did not accept that apology\nit was like uh i just yeah i was just\nconfused bro\nyeah no i i think paul to be honest i\nmean you know\npeople who have something on the on the\nautism spectrum i think what i'm hearing\nfrom your story\nlike and i don't really know you know if\nthere's more to say but\nbasically when i when i hear this i\nthink it's just a\nit's a perfect storm of a lot of\ndifferent things man\nyou know i um can i just share some\nthoughts with you\nyeah so to begin with like i think that\nyou know what i'm hearing is that\nyou grew up and like stuff was hard\nright because like people didn't know\nwhat what to do with you and like people\ndidn't really understand\nyou and like you felt it sounds to me\nlike you felt alone growing up really\nfor lack\nthat's you know and and so then\nyou know twitch came along and and i\nthink that like twitch is amazing\nbecause it's it's sort of\na way for people who are misfits\na way for misfits to fit in i think\nthat's one of the biggest things that\ntwitch has done for our society in\nin terms of like allowing people for\nthis connection\nand so you started streaming there i\nthink your class clown came out a little\nbit\nbut then as you kind of pointed out you\nknow it also sounds like you\num you know you got that validation\nand it was kind of validation in sort of\nthe wrong direction that like anything\nto not be alone and i totally get that i\ncan understand why\nyou know if you get if you're the victim\nof of something like a sexual assault or\nbullying or things like that and if\neveryone around you calls you a snitch\nand you have to like transfer schools\nand\ngo sit in a classroom by yourself when\nyou're like clearly the victim\nyou know i can understand how that\nleaves\na hunger for like acceptance a hunger\nfor\nfriendship like a hunger for like\nsomething and then along comes the\ninternet\nand then all of these things that you\ngrew up as like you don't have to be\nanymore\nyou can be someone who talks to people\nyou don't have to be someone with\nasperger's you can just be social\nyou can have lots of friends and you can\nbe funny and people can appreciate you\nand you can appreciate them\ni think there's a lot of i mean there\nmust have been a lot of just genuine\ngoodness to your content too i'm not\nsaying it was wholesome\nbut like there must have been like good\ntimes and solid laughs and like a lot of\nlike\nyou know hanging out you know i mean and\nand so that's sort of like and then you\nhad this sort of like high of everyone\nyou know like liking you and this is\nwhere i'd say from a spiritual\nperspective\ni don't know if we have time for this\nnow right i don't think we do but i\nthink that there's another element of\nego or the sanskrit word is ahm god\nwhich is the sense of i\nso your sense of identity of who you\nbecome\nand who you want to be that i think is\nsort of active here\nand then then something weird happens i\nthink it sounds like you sort of\ncultivated\num a particular kind of person in in\nyour chat which\nyou know i totally get because i imagine\nhad i been a little bit younger and was\nwatching twitch chat more religiously i\nprobably would have wound up in your\ncommunity i have a huge inner troll\num you know i really get it and so\nand then you got banned a couple times\nyou got a band a couple more times\nand then there was this kind of swat\nthing where and i do think you sort of\nlet it sounds like you went\nyou kind of like let caution go for a\nwhile there\nand you know whatever happened happened\num\nand then really when you got banned from\ntwitch you were sort of like i'm getting\na sense of like\nyou know desperation and fear really\nthat all this stuff was going to be\ntaken away and like you'd pay\nany price to hang on to it any price\nand was it the wrong thing to do to\ncompletely\ndestroy your boundaries and let randos\nlike show up at your place like\nundoubtedly at the same time i think\nit's very authentic for you to say that\nactually\nsounds like you don't regret it no i\nmean i had a lot of good i mean i know\nwe're talking about the bad experiences\nbut i had a lot of good ones too\ndude i have met thousands and thousands\nof fans\nat my doorstep and you know most of them\nare cool\nand most of them i resonate with really\na lot\nit's only the couple situations where\nthey're like [ __ ]\ncrazy people or something like\nyou know what i mean like i've had\npeople come like crying to me\nlike they like they like let me move in\nwith you you are my god\nand they're crying and i have to say no\nyou cannot move in with me\nand then he's posed to conversate he was\nrecording the conversation he posted on\nreddit\nand on reddit [ __ ] on me let this\nguy live with you he's you're\nyou're his god and i just have to say no\nand then you know those are the bad\nsituations\nbut most of the situations were good\nyeah\nand and so then we kind of get to where\nyou are now which is where where are you\nnow paul\nwell i mean yeah i mean i stream on\nyoutube to uh\nyou know smaller audience than twenty\nthousand but\num i'm happy with it bro like honestly\ni mean obviously uh 20 000\nwas nice but it's not worth like the it\njust wasn't worth what i had to go\nthrough like i\ni had this this project that i was doing\nin la this was the final straw 2019 i\nhad this project i was doing i was going\nto\nstart this like streamer house and you\nknow my viewers\nwanted me to move in a trailer park\ninstead of a house\nand i said no because that you know i\ndon't want to live in a [ __ ] trailer\nand stream from it um and uh\nyou know yeah they they ruined the\nproject that i had\nthey had investors and you know they\npulled out because the viewers were\ngetting too crazy\nwhen you know they were doxxing the\ninvestors and [ __ ] they were just so\npissed at me\nyeah they were so pissed at me that they\nwanted to do anything to ruin this\nproject that i had been\nworking towards for over a year now\nbecause you know getting\ninvestors is not an easy task and like\ngetting like a whole\nlike a bunch of employees and it was\njust a long process right\nso that got ruined and i said all right\n[ __ ] this i closed my reddit down i got\nit banned\nyou know uh other reddit started opening\nup\nyou know for like people trying to still\nbe a part of my community those got\nbanned\nand i moved to texas got away from\ncalifornia\ni just started like a new [ __ ] it's\nlike a new life bro\nand i stopped streaming for a little bit\nstreamed on mixer for\nfor almost a year now i'm back on\nyoutube and i had to\nstop streaming and go to mixer to get\nrid of the like i just had to take time\noff bro cause the\nsome of these [ __ ] people bro they\njust wouldn't\nlike they're just like obsessive like\nwhen you let\npeople control your life you do get a\ncertain type of\nviewer like you said and these type of\nviewers\nit's hard to it's hard to get rid of\nthem so\num so i took some time off and now my\nviewers\nthey're very nice they respect my\nboundaries i like them\nand yeah i mean i'm very happy right now\nwith where i am streaming\ncool well i'm happy for you\nthank you i it's been tough though it's\nit's bro it was like it dude 2019 when i\nwas taking time off bro\nit wasn't easy dude it i had like an ego\ndeath\nbecause uh i had to re-identify myself\nfrom this like persona\nto like i just want to be me now i don't\nwant to be a persona\nyou know yeah i\ni i mean that makes a lot of sense to me\nbecause i'm and i'm also really happy to\nhear that actually because it sounds\nlike your ego was really out of control\nfor a while i yeah i i\njust yeah i've lost a little bit of uh\nwho i was at like as a person and\ncompletely became\nthis you know like [ __ ] frankenstein\nmy viewers were\nmaking yeah yeah\ni hate to say it that way because it's\nit's not like it is still my fault the\nviewers aren't the ones who like\nmade that but i put myself in the\nsituation to allow them to\nmake that yeah i i see what you're\nsaying i i think i mean i'm not\nhere to play judge in terms of who was\nat fault and who wasn't that's not\nreally\ni mean i think you know i i will\njudgement is for\ngod if you believe in it yourself and\nthe internet\nand it's not something that i am\ninterested in i think um\nmy perspective paul it's been an\nabsolute pleasure talking to you i think\nit's been\nreally fascinating i hope that um you\nknow\nespecially sort of like some of this\ncommunication stuff i think that it's\ninteresting that\na lot of people take it for granted but\nthere is kind of like a\nstepwise process to learn how to\ncommunicate\num we i think sometimes we got to be\nreally careful because there are\npatterns in our communication like the\nway that you\nown up to your mistakes but it's not\nreally an apology that i think that you\nwould\nit's actually the same principle as sort\nof talking to your girlfriend which is\nlike\njust state how you really feel about\nthings hey i really want to talk to you\nbut i'm not really able to because it\nlike brings up a lot of negative emotion\nand i want to work on this but i just\ncan't handle it right now and i'm really\nconfused about like what to do about\nthat\nyou know because i i'm hearing almost\nthe same degree of like\nsort of conflicting stuff which unless\nyou state it out for people can be\nconfusing for them\nso on the one hand it was terrible and i\nfelt like i was in a toxic abusive\nrelationship but on the other hand it\nwas like also super hype\nyou know i i my ego was through the roof\ni was loving it i was loving being\nthis person who had went from 100\nviewers to 20 000 viewers\nand it was amazing and then i was also\nafraid and i like\nlet let these people like do things to\nmy life but i also\nlet them do it you know and i felt like\ni lost control\nand at the end of the day it sounds like\nreally the only thing you're sorry for\nis\nthe other people who got caught up in it\nright and\nand kind of suffered because of your\nchoices\num and and it sounds like you're\nactually grateful that i mean i don't\nknow grateful may be a strong word but\nthat you don't regret what happened to\nyou because\nit's made you the person that you are\ntoday and that you had like\nyou know a pretty narrow sliver of what\nyour experience of life is and like\nnow it's like a huge pie of like just\nall of these different experiences\ngood bad crazy hype fun\nyou know walking like waking up and like\nrando's being in your living room like\nthat sounds absolutely insane\nyeah dude yeah my experience bro i have\nso many different perspectives\nit's amazing yeah and and so i think the\nlast thing that i'll kind of leave you\nwith is i'm glad you've kind of had\nsomething like an ego death because i\ni heard the ego when you because this is\nthe ego when it's like i'm going to be\nthe only streamer who dot dot dot\nthat's ego right i want to be the only\none that's not about your viewers\nit's not about making good content\nif you're interested in being the only\nwhatever that's about you\num and and so good luck to you man\nit's been an absolute pleasure really\nappreciate your authenticity\nand just share your story yeah one\nquestion uh yeah of course\njust because i i do feel and i i've\nalways felt insecure about this\num but um because\nthen you brought it up because my\nviewers used to say it all the time too\nthe ego thing\num hopefully you don't see that\nin me at the moment or currently because\ni tried\nhard to try to ground myself\nyeah so let's talk about that for just a\nsecond so i think that um\ni i i think you're on the right road for\nsure paul\nand and like you said like that that\nkind of identity crisis that you went\nthrough in 2019 i think was probably\nvery healthy for you\ni think but i think part of the reason\nwhy people see ego i don't think it's\nactually ego i think it's just your way\nof communicating\nwhich is like when you say something\nlike\nyou know i i made this mistake because\nof the fear\nthat's gonna come across as egotistical\nto people\nlike it like it's gonna come across to\npeople as saying like oh it wasn't my\nfault it was like\nmy emotions which i know it sounds weird\nbut it's true\nand also like people are going to judge\nyou for being egotistical\ni think the only real ego that i i\nshared with you the statement that i\nthought was egotistical which was the\none where i i want to be the only\nstreamer who\ndot dot that's really like the only\nthing that i thought was explicitly ego\nnow i mean there may have been way more\nego before but i'm not getting a whole\nlot of that now\ndoes that sound okay that i i mean said\nthat do you feel reassured when i say\nthat or\nyeah i just wanted i was just insecure\nbecause i just don't wanna\ni just hope i was just hoping i wasn't\ncoming off as like uh\negotistical or something so the other\ntricky thing\nuh paul that i should i should be more\ncareful about this is a mistake on\non mine and i'm sorry for that is that i\nuse the term ego\nis really a translation of the sanskrit\nterm ahamkara\nwhich is the i feeling or the identity\nand so what i'm sort of talking about is\nnot necessarily that you were like\negotistical but that you had an\nidentity right like this is if we think\nabout paul growing up\npaul was lonely paul was riding the\nshort bus\npaul was all of these things and then\nyou have ice poseidon\nwho thousands of cool people show up at\nyour door to hang out with you\nboth of those are ego they're both a\nsense of who you\nare and neither of them is truly who you\nare those are both identities\nthose are both ego so when i say ego i'm\nreferring to actually both of those\nthings\nthere are constructions of the mind\nabout who we\nare but that's not really who you are\nlike i know it sounds weird but i mean\nwho you are is like\nif you close your eyes for a second\nit's like can you feel your existence\nyeah like that's who you are\nright you're not paul you're not ice\nbeside and you're none of those things\nall you are is like if if the world\nceased to exist or i stuck you in a\ntime capsule and put you in like you\nknow a cryogenic state for\n10 000 years and you woke up and you\nwere the last human being alive\nit wouldn't matter that you're paul it\nwouldn't matter that you're ice beside\nwouldn't matter how many\nyou know none of that would matter all\nthat would be left would be like the\nreal you\ndoes that sort of make sense yeah it\ndoes\nand and so that's sort of what i was\nreferring to so especially if you know\npeople are going to watch this and\nthey're going to think like oh like dr k\nthinks he's like egotistical like i want\nto clarify what i mean by that you may\nbe go to school i don't know but\nno that's a good way that's a good way\nto put it thank you so much\nthank you man this has been great i you\nknow i've\nheard a lot about you but it's it's been\ngreat to actually talk to you i try to\nsteer clear of\nyou know what people say but um\nyou know the reason we're doing this\ninterview i was like oh like i guess\nwe're not doing on twitch\nour folks are like yeah we can't you\ncan't do it on twitch\nwell at least we can video about it\nhopefully someone could learn something\nfrom my experience so i certainly hope\nso and i really appreciate you being\nwilling to come on especially given all\nthe hate that you've experienced\num you know hopefully nothing bad comes\nof this\nand um you know if something bad does\nhappen and please let us know so that we\ncan\ntry to support you if we can okay\nyeah for sure man all right take care\ndude all right thanks a lot man\nsee you later\nyou"
