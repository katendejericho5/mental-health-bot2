    "transcript": "and there's really interesting research\nif you look at research on incels\nis that there's an online radicalization\nprocess\nand this is not actually it's not really\nanyone's fault it's just interesting\nbecause if you think about youtube right\nif i watch a video on\nyoutube on incels what is youtube going\nto suggest to me\nso hi dr k do you have any advice on\nfemale in cells i'm in my late 20s and\nhave never had a boyfriend this has\ncaused me to develop severe self-esteem\nissues\ni've heard you say that women are the\nones who pick the partners what\nand that women have to deal with too\nmuch attention and harassment\ni have the opposite problem of most\nwomen this makes me feel almost\nsub-human\ni also feel like i'm running out of time\nto experience a romantic relationship\nif no one wanted to be with me in the\nteens and 20s\nwhat chance do i have in my 30s and 40s\nso this is a great question\nso one of the really interesting things\nso we're actually writing a paper at\nhealthygamer on insults\nand we've been doing a lot of research\non this topic because i think it's\nsomething that a lot of people\nsuffer from and struggle with and i\nthink a lot of our\nyou know we try to support the incel\ncommunity for lack of a better term i\nmean i know that sounds kind of scary\nbut\nwhat i mean by that is like we try to\nhelp people understand that they have\nintrinsic value and that a lot of the\nsort of in-cell kind of\nthinking and belief system may not be\nentirely correct\nso there are a couple of things that i\nwant to point out the first is that\ngenerally speaking incel\nappears to be like refers to men right\nso if you look at the published\nliterature\non in cells they tend to focus entirely\non men\nbut it's been our experience that\nthey're actually like female people who\nidentify with the term incel so i think\nthat's a huge problem\nin like the published literature in the\nway that people look at things\nso i think that you know this sort of\nbelief or idea that you're an\nincel and will never find a romantic\nrelationship is not gender specific\nit may certainly be more prevalent in\nmen i'm not quite sure i you know i'd\nreally have to see statistics around\nthat but i\ngenerally speaking makes sense to me\nbecause i tend to see\nor hear more about male in cells i i\ndon't know if i i mean if i said that\nwomen pick their partners i i know that\nthat's a lot of like the thinking of\nincels is that women there's a sexual\nmarketplace and whatnot\ni mean i generally speaking so if i said\nthat in the past i you know it's i\ndidn't mean it like that\num and it's my experience that generally\nspeaking when you're picking a partner\nlike\nboth people pick right so the whole idea\nbehind a partnership is that it's like a\nmutual arrangement\nand it's not like one person is picking\nand the other person isn't\ni understand that that's been some\npeople's experiences and some people can\ndefinitely get into the sort of\nrelationship where\nthere's a power dynamic so don't get me\nwrong there that's definitely possible\nbut i think that generally speaking\nif you think about a relationship it's\nlike the whole point is that there's a\nrelation right so there's like\nboth people are sort of agreeing to have\nthis relationship\nand so i think the problem here is that\nif we listen to what this person says\nthey're saying women are the ones who\nget to pick and i i\nhave the opposite problem so i'm not\nlike most women therefore i feel\nsubhuman\nso if you stop and think about it for a\nsecond what you see is that the feeling\nof sub-human\nis rooted in the idea\nthat most people are one way\nand i am the other way so it it's\ninteresting because like\nwhere where do you get the idea that\nmost women women are one way and that\nyou're a different way\nso i think there's also something that's\nthat's very common for people which is\nthat they feel like they're running out\nof time to experience a romantic\nrelationship\nand that makes sense like the time you\nknow the hourglasses is kind of going\nand the further that you\ngo the the worse off you are so i want\nto share with you guys a couple of the\nthings that we've discovered through our\nresearch i mean it's not\nlike this stuff is sort of known already\nbut like this is what we piece together\nis maybe a better way to put it\nso the first is that when people are in\ncells that\nit's primarily like sort of a\npsychological thing so it's not actually\nlike\nit's a belief system so here's what\nhappens with an insult\nso they start out with usually some kind\nof adverse\nexperience or the idea of a missed\nmilestone\nso they it's not even like necessarily\nsomething bad happened to them but they\nturn 18 or they turn 21 or they graduate\nfrom college and it starts with this\nsort of idea that like\ni was supposed to have done something by\na particular time\nthere's a missed milestone that's where\nit starts\nor some kind of rejection or negative\nexperience and then what's really\nchanged now is that we can sort of\nengage with communities that will\nactually like reinforce this idea\nso if you engage with a community where\neveryone else has missed milestones and\nnone of the people have sort of\nmade it out of inseldom it's going to\ncolor\nyour perspective on the world and so\nthen what becomes a personal experience\nthat maze\nmaybe is actually changeable starts to\nfeel like universal truth\nand there's really interesting research\nif you look at research on incels\nis that there's a online radicalization\nprocess\nand this is not actually it's not really\nanyone's fault it's just interesting\nbecause if you think about\nyoutube right if i watch a video on\nyoutube on incels\nwhat is youtube going to suggest to me\nso you have these content platforms that\nare trying to do their best\nto make their content the most appealing\nto you\nand if you watch one incel video then\nyou're going to get populated with like\na second one and if you watch the second\none then you're gonna get populated with\nfour\nand six and ten so there's this online\nradicalization effect which is probably\nhas something to do with the algorithms\nof content platforms\nso it's not like people are purposely\nseeking this stuff out maybe some of\nthem are\nbut if you look there's this online\ndrift so you start out with sort of like\nthe gateway drug and then you kind of\ngradually like what happens is these\nplatforms will push you\ntowards more radicalizing content so\nthis is why you see\nradicalization in general amongst\npolitics and all kinds of other things\nso it has a really interesting effect on\nyour psychology\nand so psychologically what starts to\nhappen is your experience becomes\nincredibly validated\nand now we get to something else about\nthin cell communities that it's\nincredibly validating right like this\nperson feels like\nthey're sub-human and so it can feel\nactually really good to be like in a\ncommunity with other people who feel\nsubhuman because they're people who get\nyou\nright they're your people and so like\nthis is this is a world that rejects you\nand so you can find a community that\naccepts you the way you are and says\nyeah it sucks\nit's not your fault there's a sexual\nmarketplace value\nyour jaw line isn't manly enough you\nwere born with the beta gene\nit's not your fault don't feel that way\nabout yourself it's sad it's true\nit's incredibly validating and\nand so there's this weird kind of\ncombination of online radicalization\nalong with like warm open arms which\nthen gets people to really think this\nway right and then you start thinking\nthat way\nit's very emotionally like gratifying\nthen you can start to\nbelieve these things and it's not it's\nnot wrong to believe them because that's\nwhat your brain is designed to do\nif you're hanging out with a thousand\npeople that all tell you the same thing\nlike you're gonna start believing it\nit's like\nhow it works the short answer is that\nyou've still got a chance like\nabsolutely right so the only time you\ndon't have a chance is when you stop\ntrying\nthat's really the only thing that will\ndetermine when you don't have a chance\ni've worked with tons of incels\nand my experience has been that what's\nreally at the core of it\nis the self-esteem it's not that like\nand it becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy because\nonce certain experiences cause you to\nhave a self-esteem\nthat feeling of being sub-human is going\nto affect\nevery romantic interaction that you have\nand so it's it's overcoming that\ninternal feeling of self-esteem or\nfeeling subhuman\nwhich will then naturally create alter\nthe way that you engage in relationships\nso oddly enough i think people think\nabout being an incel and the cure to\nbeing an incel\nis getting laid or finding a partner\nand so then you're no longer an insult\nbut we've even had people on stream who\nhave like had relationships and they're\nlike i'm still an insult\nso it's bizarre because people think\nthat becoming no longer being an incel\nis about an outward change but it's not\nabout an outward change it's about an\ninternal change\nand we've seen that we've seen people\nwho like actually have relationships\nhave women that persistently ask them\nout and they still feel like an insult\nand so it's not it has nothing to do\nwith the outside you being an in-cell\nhas nothing to do with like\nwith the way that people treat you it\nhas everything to do with the way that\nyou perceive yourself\nright because who like is there like a\nyou know crowd of people that's like\nrunning around and like calling you an\ninsult no\nit's an identity that you take on\nand so the cool thing is that if it's an\nidentity that you take on\nit's also within your power to no longer\nhave it now it's not easy i'm making it\nsound easy it's certainly not easy it\ntakes a lot of work\nright so it requires a lot of like\neffort and self-reflection\nand really like digging to the bottom of\nyour self-esteem so i'd say that the\nreal approach is to like\ntackle the some scar of low self-esteem\nand this is where i'd even\nsay like you know when did you start\nfeeling like you were an incel because i\ndon't think\nit's like has nothing to do with your\n20s it's probably happened a long time\nago\nmay even have nothing to do when did you\nstart feeling subhuman it may not have\neven been in your teen years like you\nmay have had some kind of experience in\nchildhood where you really really felt\nlike sub-human and so that feeling of\nsub-humanness which you carry with you\nthen finds a new set of clothes which is\nin seldom\nand so it like puts that on so i think\nthere's absolutely hope for you you just\nhave to be willing to try\nand i know that you try really really\nhard it's just you have to try in sort\nof a different way\nso i'd say forget about the incel forget\nabout the relationships\nand focus a little bit about what's\nreally chipped away at your self-esteem\nwhat's chip\nwhat's contributed this idea that you're\nsub-human and work on like building\nconfidence and spending time with nature\nand like things like that\nokay hope that's helpful and good luck\nto you"
