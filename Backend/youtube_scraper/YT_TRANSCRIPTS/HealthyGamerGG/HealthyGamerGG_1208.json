    "transcript": "hi dr mrs k i'm 27 male\nand i have been single forever i\nrecently worked through some of my shame\nthat held me back and now\ni really like myself i feel confident\nthat i deserve love and am capable of\ngiving it\nhowever i'm still anxious reaching out\nand getting to know women\nin the moment i have no idea what to say\nor feel scared to introduce myself\nafter the opportunity passes i think of\nmultiple ways i could have started a\nconversation or flirted\nand i'll wish i did it and reassure\nmyself that i will have courage\nnext time but this pattern keeps\nrepeating\ni understand that i have to take a risk\nbut is there a way i can get rid of the\npanic\nand fear of embarrassment that arises so\ni can be ready for the next opportunity\ni love this question\nmy answer is no\nthere's not a way to get rid of the\npanic and fear of embarrassment\nnope really\nyeah do you have an answer i think so\ndude this is like okay then to help us\nout\ni used to be really scared of coming on\nstream but i just\nblew it a couple of times and now i'm\nfine\ni think yeah but did you did you get rid\nof the panic and fear\nbefore you came on scene no i just got\nbetter at preparing i think\nthat i think you can do yeah so i think\nthere's definitely something that this\nperson could do\nbut i don't think you can get rid of the\npanic or fear of embarrassment\nall right so let's let's see i think you\nhave to increase your comfort in your\nconfidence\nthere's a lot of stuff you can do but\ncan you get rid of the fear\nlike there's no cheat code to get rid of\nfear of embarrassment but if all that\nthere is is fear and embarrassment then\nthat's the only emotion you're feeling\nbut if you're\nalso feeling excitement and confident\nand all these other things and panic and\nfear\nis just one of many things it's not the\noverwhelming thing\nthat i think causes the paralysis\nyeah i think there's a lot that you can\ndo but i don't think you can get rid of\nthe panic and fear and i think that's\nthe problem right so i think the problem\nhere is that we think to ourselves\noh how can i get rid of this thing and\nyou can't get rid of that thing so you\nend up stuck where there's a whole lot\nof other stuff you can do\nto make yourself like more able to\nengage with other people\nso for example you can let go of like\nlike so when you\nintroduce yourself to someone i imagine\nthat you have a lot of\nexpectations over what is coming\nout of that introduction that's true so\ni think what you can do is let go of\nthose expectations which doesn't have\nanything to do with the fear of\nembarrassment or panic it's just like\nhey there's a person here so here's like\nyou know one tip that um\nyou know i this doesn't i can give you\nguys tips but they're not good ones\nbecause i tried them for a while and i\nended up\nyou know with me or something but the\nbut the whole point is that i didn't use\nany of my tricks\non you like i just was like what were\nyour tricks\ni'm about to tell you they were\nineffective okay so so one is that i\nrealized that like so when i was in\ncollege right and i was like\n19 year old dr chad i was neither a\ndoctor nor a chad\ni had this idea and i had this\nrevelation that if i make friends with a\ngirl she can introduce me to her friend\nso rather than like trying to ask this\ngirl out\nlike if i just make friends with her\nlike she'll introduce me to a bunch of\nher friends and i can ask like six girls\nout instead\nso it increases my access to the pool of\nwomen\nright that's so bad\ni'm telling you this is shitty\nstrategies\nso bad i didn't end up with any of them\nright is that why you wanted to come\ninto\nmy dorm no i'm pretty sure at the point\nthat\ni was breaking into your all women's\ndorm i'm pretty sure i understood that\nwe were dating\nlike y'all i figured she's literally a\nlegend because they tell\nstories of this guy that broke into our\ndorm\nanyway so um\nyeah so it was lunch you were like\nliterally a legend\nthat's where the legend began yeah but\nyou know years before that i come up\nwith all these strategies i was like oh\nlike i'm going to do this thing right\nand\ni don't think any of them work but i'll\nshare it anyway i think there's an\nimportant principle here that is\naccurate is so the cool thing that that\nallowed me to do and this strategy is\ndumb but\nthe cool thing it allowed me to do is\nlike let go of the expectation that\nsomething has to come out of this and i\nhave to get this person to like me\nright and i think that this is where if\nyou think about like what is the\nexpectation that you have with\nintroducing yourself\nand and if you have a big expectation\nthat's going to create the fear of\nembarrassment because you could screw up\nbut it's like why would you introduce\nyourself to people there are a thousand\nreasons to introduce yourself to people\nthat have nothing to do with dating or\nfinding a relationship\nand so just cultivate or pick any of\nthose\nright so you're 27 and you're single and\nthere's someone that you hang out with\nand this could be interesting because\nlike\ndon't just look at people that you're\nattracted to right just like go out and\nmeet people um\nlike like getting to know women like do\nyou have to be attracted to the women\nwoman to to get to know her i was gonna\nsay\nstart hitting on people that you're not\nsuper like\ndo some low stakes flirting just learn\nto like\nappreciate human beings for what they\nare and like the love will come\nright like just like like recognize that\nthey're you know they're they're billion\nthere are seven billion human beings on\nthe planet and each one\nhas something that is like incredibly\ninteresting and fascinating about them\nthat you can engage in relationships\nwith people who like you guys can go\nwatch movies together and go play\nfrisbee together and like\ndo all kinds of stuff i would have never\nplayed frisbee with you\nokay i mean would have we never played\nfrisbee\nwell right why is it because you don't\nknow how to play frisbee or is it\nsomething about me\ni'm confused the physics of frisbees\nmake no sense\nokay so it has nothing to think\nno it's it's no yeah it's more about the\nfrisbee though\ncase in court right like so like this is\nwhat i'm saying is you know if you\nguys pay attention she makes i would\nnever play play frisbee with you like\nthat sounds like it's about me\nit's and if i'm like anxious right i'm\ngoing to think like oh my god what's\nwrong with me that she would never\npraise\nme but like this is the thing like human\nbeings like she has all kinds of like it\nhas nothing to do with me it has to suit\nthe frisbee\nfrisbees make no sense so this is where\nlike if you guys are worried that\nsomeone is not doing something with you\nlike just think for a second that maybe\nthat has more to do with them than it\ndoes with you\nyeah and think about like if the physics\nare weird for the things that you're\nproposing\nthat's the problem with the magic so the\nphysics aren't right\nthat's what it is it's all about the\nangle\ni knew you were gonna say that a hundred\npercent knew you're gonna say that\nit's because we've talked about it way\ntoo much so much\nwell it's all about the physics for me\ndo you think i'll look the labor's\npoints on stream you have no idea\nall right get wrecked shitties\ntoday i am the shitty that was wrecked\ni'm i'm really excited for buddy\nthough um that i think is\ndon't forget about betty oh this is\nteaching what\nyeah you're doing you've got it right\nwrong okay up top\nthanks uh so instead of just waiting for\na high five you just give\npeople a signal so that they know right\ni gave you a signal you just didn't see\nit that's why\nexactly that's why i'm doing the verbal\nsignal right you see\ncommunication teach me about\ncommunication i go\nteach me about making the magic happen\noh no\nanyway what i was gonna say is it sounds\nlike you've been on this thing right you\ngot rid of the shame and now you really\nlike yourself\nand like you're you're kind of in this\nprogression so what i wanted to tell you\nis keep going um i think this will get\neasier for you as long as that there's\nmore emotions\nthan panic and fear like i really think\nthis should be\nfun and exciting for you\nso in in so much as you can kind of\nremember that like meeting somebody\nshould be fun\nmeeting somebody should not be this\nscary thing\ni think you'll be okay yeah i just want\nto say like\nbuddy dude you're a cool dude yeah right\nlike you have something to offer people\nlike each and every one of you like i\nknow it sounds weird but like each and\nevery one of you has something to offer\npeople\nand so like get to know people just like\ntry to meet them and try to like\nrecognize that every person that you\nmeet could be\nyou know your best friend could be a\nfriend of yours for the next five years\ncould be\nlike a great source for like you know\na chicken soup recipe like they could\nteach you how to make cookies they could\ndo all kinds\nof stuff like there are a lot of human\nbeings out there and i think like a big\npart of\nwhat i've i mean like i think the reason\npeople think maybe i'm special is\nbecause\nyou know every time someone comes on\nstream like i recognize that there's\nsomeone here\nwho like is awesome in some way because\nwe are\nall awesome in some way i'm not saying\nit you know because like oh man like we\nall\nhave a piece of the divine man like sure\nthat's true\nbut if you like think about it\nstatistically like ever there's\nsomething cool about every person\ni think you should just ask women for\ntheir chicken soup recipes\ni think that would be weird that sounds\nlike something i would come up with\nbefore i met you\nlike oh like i had this master plan to\nask me for the chicken soup recipes\nand they would become friends of mine\nbecause i would signal to them that i'm\na cook\nokay we're gonna go to the next one\nsounds good"
