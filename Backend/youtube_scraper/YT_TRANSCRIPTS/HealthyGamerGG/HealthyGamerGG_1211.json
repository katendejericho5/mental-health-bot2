    "transcript": "i'm not impulsive i sit in my basement\nand play video games all day this is\nnice\nyou know it's not like hey let's just\nhave a kid today for fun it's that's not\nthe kind of\nthat's not the kind of decision making\nyou're gonna find here\nyeah you don't just randomly change your\nraid schedule just for\nany rent any rent exactly thank you\nlet's just work with what we've got\nthat'll be fun\nso let's start off by can all y'all help\nme understand um what\nwhat how how should i address each of\nyou\nand what should i call you yeah i i can\nbe sam\nokay first first names\nno problem okay you guys can call me\nolok too like\nor dr k you know whatever people prefer\num\nand so uh sam and ben can you all help\nme understand a little bit about how you\nguys got into streaming\num i'll start because it's your origin\nstory so\num so way back when i think what 2016\ndestiny 1 uh had a game mode called\ntrials of osiris added and i decided to\ni had like a channel that i used to use\nto watch myself afk farm\nuh diablo while i was at work yeah i'd\nnever watched twitch work but yeah\num but it was it was like the origin of\njust the channel existing\nnever really used it for anything until\ntrials came out and then\ni started streaming to help my friend\nbrian\nuh try and grow his channel i got pretty\nlucky\nuh not to his benefit but when he went\nto college\nhe moved into a dorm that did not have\nuh didn't have good internet so i\nbenefited from that\nby continuing i was like i'm just gonna\nkeep that our little community that we\ngrew together uh going i'll continue to\nstream on my channel because i was\ni already had like a career i worked in\ni.t for years and years i went to\ncollege and graduated all that um\nand so i i was only streaming just to\nhelp him out\nand when he couldn't stream anymore i\ncontinued to\nkeep things going and it just kind of\ngrew from there i\ni think that i got lucky a bunch of\ntimes in a row to get to where i am now\nuh or maybe right place right time and\ncapitalize on it\nand it grew to where it is now\nand can do you guys mind if i so just a\ncouple of ground rules you know anything\nthat you if i ask a question that y'all\ndon't feel comfortable answering or is\nout of line in any way shape or form\njust let me know\nbut since we are talking about parenting\nyou know i thought i would ask y'all one\nor two questions about y'all's\nrelationship and maybe how y'all met\nis that cool so how did you guys meet\ni'll take this one uh i lived in a\nduplex in college with four other girls\nand on the other side were five other\nguys and one of them happened to be\nben's childhood best friend and\nhe came over to watch a star trek\nrift tracks movie i don't remember i\nnever remember which one it is benjamin\nwhatever star trek movie\nwrath of khan yeah shatner climbs uh you\nknow el cap in yosemite at the beginning\nof it\nbut i was outside with one of the\nneighbor guys trying to help me\nfix my car and uh\nyou know it was just a pos and i was\nkicking it and\nsuper upset because i needed to get to\nwork the next day and ben and the other\nguys walk up and they\ngot my car started so i can go to work\ntomorrow and\nuh like go clean up come over and and\nwatch\nthis movie with us so you can relax okay\ncome over\nthroughout the whole entire thing\neverybody's talking and then this guy\nacross the room just keeps like staring\nat me\nand he keeps trying to be part of this\nconversation that i'm in\ni'm like who the heck is this guy i\ndon't know\num and it wasn't until i left\nthat as i walked past him to leave to go\nto\nmy side of the the building he grabbed\nmy arm and he's like hey i'm ben\nand i was like hi i'm sam okay bye like\njust bounce right out of there uh it\nwasn't until like a couple weeks after\nwe you know met that uh\nhe added me on facebook when it wasn't\nweird to add random people on social\nmedia\nand we just this was okay yeah this was\nbefore what it was like this is just\n2007.\nit wasn't weird yet to do that kind of\nstuff\nand he just we just started talking i\nwas casually seeing somebody else at the\ntime\nand uh basically you know that guy\nscrewed up too many times and ben was\nthere when i was upset he was the first\nperson i called\ncrying because this guy stood me up and\nuh\nhe was in the best part is is\nhe never was pushy about it\nlike but he also wasn't like complacent\nthat i was seeing another guy\nuh he this movie sounded horrible\ni knew that you liked me but it wasn't\nlike you were trying to put yourself in\nbetween\nlike you were respectful that i was\nseeing somebody else\nbut you also made sure to make it known\nthat you really liked me and that you\ncared about me and stuff like that and\nso\nwhen i was sick of the other guy i was\njust like\noh well there's this dude here so he's\nreally nice and then what we had\nour our first date um maybe like a week\nor so after we\nuh after i was done seeing that guy and\nthere you go\nnow it's been what it's been\n14 years this summer yep\nyeah so can i get ben's version of\nevents\nokay so because i feel like that's\nokay well i'm gonna start all the way\nbut yeah i'll start at the beginning\nso i my friend tom and i we were gonna\ngo over to hang out\nand watch uh a rifftrax dub of wrath\nkhan i was super excited\nand when we're we're walking up the\nduplex and there's this girl outside\nin a blue and white flannel shirt uh\nripped up jeans you know\nkind of she she was same age as us but\nshe was very frustrated with her vehicle\nuh and was swearing at it and so we\noffered to\nuh to help her with it and just like you\nknow go relax get a long day\ntake a shower you know get cleaned up\ncome over and just hang out and\nand forget about the problem for a\nlittle while so she did that\num and while we're watching the movie uh\nraw conversations i was not staring\nacross the room i\nmade glances as one does all right uh\nfrom time to time\nand i never got an opportunity to\nintroduce myself directly so before she\nleft i said you know what eff it\nuh i reached out and i grabbed her arm\nand said hey by the way i'm ben and she\nsaid she sam\nand she left and that was it it wasn't\nweird okay\nbut it was definitely not pushy it was\none of those like hey she's cute i want\nto\ni i don't even i didn't get a chance to\nlike directly interact with her at all\nso i figured i might as well give it a\nshot and go for it\nand um like she said i did find her on\non facebook and edit her and we started\ntalking a little bit um\ndo you remember the you're gonna go on a\ntrip to yosemite\nand do you remember what i said to you i\nasked you how long before you leave\nyes you this is before this is after i\nstopped seeing the other guy\nand you had said when are you supposed\nto go on that trip to yosemite and i\nsaid two weeks and you're like all right\ni have two weeks for you to go on a date\nwith me then\nand it worked so here we are yeah the\nnext day was our date\nso that was uh i gotta say ben well\nplayed sir\nthank you i appreciate that it's pretty\nsmooth no because like here's the thing\nright so i think a lot of times like\npeople say like oh nice guys finish\nlast right but like i think there's this\nvery tricky tightrope\nof like letting your intentions be known\nand like not\npretending that nothing is going on and\nat the same time like still being\nrespectful of boundaries\nyeah which is like really hard i think a\nlot of people like either they\nthey don't they're not transparent\nenough like i i'm you know i'm a favor\ni'm in favor of being\ntransparent um and like if you have you\nknow if you're attracted to someone or\ninterested in them and like like i think\nlike\nlike solid bro like you know not letting\nher like like you know\nshe's walking out the door taking your\nlast chance to at least introduce\nyourself\nnot asking for her number no compliments\nor anything\njust you know because it says a lot but\nlike it's also like really like it's\nsuper smooth bro\nthe idea is kind of like i don't there's\nnothing to lose at that point you might\nas well go for it right\nyep but also like but don't go too far\noh yeah there's a line i could have been\nlike hey so you should stop what you're\ndoing and hang out and talk with me\nright now yes\nobviously she was on her way out on the\nfront porch with me in chat\nthat was not the goal the goal was just\nliterally to to try and\nplant the seed which i don't know you\ncould take all sorts of ways because we\nhave a kid now but\nyou know what i mean like but to to try\nand start some sort of conversation\ncan we just appreciate for a moment that\nben remembers what she was wearing\ni wore that same shirt on our wedding\nday too to get to get ready\nuh specifically because he very much\nthat was like his visual and i still\nhave the shirt to this day\nyeah so so let me ask you something ben\nlike and i i'm\nsort of i have a hypothesis here um how\nlong did it take you to fall in love\nwith sam\n[Laughter]\num probably with an\ninternally probably not very long i\nremember with the first time\ndo you remember where we were the first\ntime i said it to you uh we were walking\npast the fabric section of hobby lobby\nyep and i and i said it and\ndo you remember whether you said it back\nor not because i do don't i don't think\ni said it back\nright away not initially and that was\nfine yeah i've always been the girl that\nyou know i've i felt like i had to say\nit back\nin my younger relationships but as i got\nolder i was like no\nlike they don't deserve that unless i'm\nready for it right\nand i wasn't gonna be i wasn't gonna try\nand force her to do or say something\nshe'd want to say but it would\nbut like you said transparency is\nimportant so there's no reason for me to\nto not be open about how i felt\ni think you stopped me and you looked at\nme and said it and then i just looked\ni looked back at you and just smiled and\ni gave you a hug and then we kept\nwalking to like go by yarn or something\nyep sounds about right yeah\nyep uh yeah i i you know i'm gonna say\nthat\ni think maybe it was like maybe the\nmoment you saw her just a tiny bit\nso if we think about neuro\nscientifically okay i i know i know you\nguys have figured out\nit may not be true but here's just maybe\ni'm drawing from my own experience which\nwas that i fell\nabsolutely in love with my wife the\nmoment i saw her it just took me years\nto realize it\nand i think it's kind of interesting\nbecause like you know if we look at\nmemory in the way that memory works\nyou know you can remember a moment from\na decade ago\nand you cannot remember what you had for\nlunch two days ago\nso temporality has a piece of it right\nbut actually it's your current emotional\nstate\nthat is the closest the the strongest\ninfluence\nfor what you remember so like how deep a\nmemory sinks in\ndepends on the emotional activation\nin that moment so it's really\nfascinating that you remember so many\ndetails like you guys remember so many\ndetails\nlike you remember like what the movie\nwas you remember what the circumstances\nwere you remember what she was wearing\nlike\nyou guys remember so much about just\nthink about this this is what like\nyou know a 60-second span 14 years ago\nand it's like crystal clear in your mind\nwhich just from like a neuroscience\nperspective\nimplies one of two things either you\nguys have talked about it a ton which is\ncertainly a possibility\nor but even then i think it's like\nsomething\nthere's like a spark something like\nsomething like\nyou know sunk in and and so anyway\nthere's a visual memory of ben walking\nup to my car with the group of guys\nbefore i even met him\nlike i have a very split two-second\nclip in my brain that maybe i created or\nnot but\ni visually remember i was sitting on the\ncurb and like even the angles of\neverything\non my street and stuff like that yeah\nawesome so it sounds like\nyeah i um y'all's origin story is\nsuper dope let's put it that way and and\nso\ncan can y'all help me understand a\nlittle bit so you guys it sounds like\ny'all started dating\nand then uh ben was streaming at that\npoint\nalready or no no okay okay i okay so\ni didn't actually start until after i\nhad already graduated from college\nand had i had a career i i worked in i.t\nfor a long time\ni was a senior systems engineer at an\ninsurance company where i live\nand by doing all the networking and data\ncenter management virtual machine\ndeployment i'm a big nerd is what it\ncomes down to it's like\ni.t and computer science that was my\nthing that's what i i majored in in\ncollege and\nand all that and um we i didn't actually\neven start streaming\nuntil this was 20 2017 so i\ni well your did i graduate from college\ni don't even remember twenty\nyou graduated in uh 2005.\nfrom high school through that so 2009\nand so it was multiple so you started\nstreaming before i got pregnant though\nso that would have been\n2014. well that's that's when\nno 2017 is when 2016 is when i started\nthen\nthe dates are all i literally my the\ndate is based on an event in a game that\ni could go look up i know exactly when\nit's like may\nthe second week of may of 2016 had to be\nwhen i actually first started\nwell yeah in 2015 though\noh that means wait yeah 2005 it would\nhave been 2015. look it up this is what\nhappens when you get this old doing\ntwitch it's like\neverything blends together no this is so\nit would have been 14. no you're right\nshe's right\nas i'm sure as usual um yeah\nno typically yeah um so so but\nyou know i just the reason i'm asking\nabout the the streaming in the\nrelationship thing is i'm really curious\nif you guys sort of\nbecause like here's ben who's got a\ncareer right and then like\nstreaming is something that's like\nrecreational hobby like i'm really\ncurious if if you guys would be okay\nwith sharing like what that conversation\nwent like\nwhat the early days of streaming was\nlike and if you guys sort of had a\nconversation about\ni'm assuming you don't work in i.t\nanymore no\nokay no no not anymore and so just you\nknow how did you guys\nas a as a couple kind of like make that\ntransition and what did those\nconversations look like\nit actually was pretty easy and this is\nlargely in part\nthe fact that she has always been super\naccepting of who i am\nuh because i used to braid and wow world\nwarcraft\npretty religiously like five nights a\nweek five hours a night\nafter work we would get i'd get home\nfrom work and i'd\nwe'd have dinner or whatever and then\ni'd sit down to raid for the evening and\nshe would work on her photography stuff\nwe'd be in the same room but it was a it\nwas\nshe's never looked at me and said you\nhave to stop playing video games because\nshe's always known that that's\nthe biggest part of my life the most\nimportant thing as far as like hobbies\ngo\nand so it was it was a no-brainer and\nshe never\ntried to manipulate me or force me she\nnever gave me an ultimatum quit gaming\nand hang out with me you're too old for\nthat\nbecause she knew she knew who she was\ndating right she it wasn't like she was\ntrying to mold me\ninto a person that i wasn't it's because\nshe\naccepted who i was and that's who she\nloved you were very upfront though\nlike when we first started dating you're\nlike maybe it was after about two weeks\nof us\nkind of seeing each other and you're\nlike hey by the way\ni now that we're seeing each other more\noften you might notice that like\ni play video games a plot a lot i he was\nraiding like he said in world of\nwarcraft and it wasn't\nuh until maybe a few months after he\nstarted dating he actually\nchanged his raid schedule to start later\nin the evening so by the time i would go\nhome or go to bed\nhe would start raid and i was just like\nwell obviously if this is important to\nhim\ni'm not going to take it away because i\ndon't want to like i like him for who he\nis not\nfor who i want to turn him into and he's\nmaking strides to accommodate me\nso why would i be upset that he still\nyou know plays games and stuff like that\nso yeah it we it's always been in our\nrelationship that in the evenings\nwe hang out together but like kind of\ndoing our own thing and then so even now\nlike in the evening\ncharlie goes to bed ben goes downstairs\nand streams i do my stuff\nafter he's done streaming we watch a\nshow and go to bed kind of thing\nso so i'd like to revise what i said\nearlier about the moment\nben fell in love i think the moment he\nfell in love is when he moved his raid\nschedule to accommodate his girlfriend\nbecause that's not a sacrifice for years\ntoo\nit's such a big sacrifice ben\nto if you look at the in the grand\nscheme of things\nmaybe not but i think for me it was yeah\nit was a big hobby related thing it was\na part of my life and i\nand we decided that it was it was best\nfor everybody involved nobody else had a\ncomplaint that i was writing with and so\nit's like this is the smartest thing to\ndo right\nso so you know sam i i really oh i'm\nhearing a lot here\nthat sounds awesome like this is like i\ndon't know if you guys are pretending to\nbe\nan awesome couple but y'all um y'all are\ndoing a lot of the things that i think\nthe unhappy couples who wind up in my\noffice don't do\nso it sounds like there's like a mutual\nkind of respect it also sounds like\nthere's like accommodations of each\nother it sounds like\nsam never asked ben to shift his raid\nschedule\nuh so it's just it's been communication\nand transparency is\nsuper helpful we have a rule especially\nwith\nwhen it comes to streaming and gaming\nand stuff like that but\nusually for the most part of our\nmarriage in in our relationship is\nwe can come to each other and we that\nperson that we go to with like some kind\nof situation so if ben was\nstreaming too much in the evening and i\nwanted to hang out with him i\nin pre-agreement with each other can go\nup to him and be like i've\nnot seen you enough we need to figure\nsomething out\nand in that first conversation the other\nperson cannot come back defensive\nuntil we figure out what's going on it\ndoesn't always work\nsure but we we know going into that\nconversation\nthat that you just you have to put it\nout there and then\nnot like knowing that you're not going\nto get attacked or anything right away\nthere might be an argument in a later\nconversation that gets drawn out\nfor whatever uh but that initial one\nthat's always been something for us\nespecially when it comes to\nstreaming and because it's his job now\nbut with gaming before\num i'm sure what led you to changing\nyour schedule is us having a\nconversation about how\nlike we were trying to find a night to\nhang out and it just didn't work for\na week because when we first started\ndating we were only seeing each other\nmaybe two times a week because we were\nboth busy\nwith school and work and you were\nraiding and all that kind of stuff\nso we we settled down that fairly early\nfor most parts of our relationship is\nwe just just put it out there kind of\nthing yeah\ni i'm hearing not just put it out there\nbut also that\nthe pers like so the person who puts it\nout there\nthe person who's receiving it also\nlistens\nfirst as opposed to defending attacking\nyou know like like i think that's a\nreally important part that like if we\ntry\nright yeah i'm not trying to put this\nfront then we're perfect but at least we\num and that seems really important you\nknow i gotta say sam i'm i'm a little\nbit\nsurprised um and so i'd love to ask you\none or two more questions because like\nyou know i i i wrapped up college um\nyou know uh uh a year or two after it\nsounds like ben started so i think we're\nall\nyou know in the same decade in terms of\nage and so i i would still be shocked\nlike i still remember i went on like one\nor two dates with this girl\nand then i told her i was like hey like\nwarcraft 3 frozen throne is coming out\nand i'm gonna be like\nm.i.a for two weeks and then you know i\nnever went out with her again\nbecause she was like i don't know what\nthis\nis and and so she's as far as i can tell\nis a completely\nnormal woman um and and so i'm i'm\nreally surprised because i can't imagine\nmany people like in the mid 2000s like\nhaving a boyfriend who was playing wow\nfor five hours a night five days a week\nlike i think it's rare for people to be\nokay with that\nis that fair i mean it wasn't a common\nthing\nand and a lot of people look at you know\nlook at gaming like it's a waste of time\nand stuff\num but to be honest like i was an only\nchild until i was 10 and even then my\nbrother\nwas born with physical mental\ndisabilities so it wasn't like i had a\nsibling or anything\nuntil later on in life with step\nsiblings so i'm totally\nfine spending time by myself\num i like i enjoy spending time with\npeople\nbut even then ben and i have joked about\nit that if we were like a regular couple\nwhere we spent\nevery single night seven nights a week\ntogether we would probably\nyou know end up getting annoyed with\neach other after a long\na long time so when when he was just\nlike hey i do this stuff and i was like\noh cool it's on a schedule\nokay well you know i i ran a\ncorporate portrait studio around that\ntime and i was like\ni'll just change my schedule to kind of\nline up with yours if i can\nand call it a day so i do my thing and\nyou do your thing and then we don't have\nto worry about trying to figure out when\nwe can hang out with each other\nso sounds really awesome yeah the\nfunny part though is like i was a super\noutdoorsy\nhippie kind of person so\nuh we were definitely like i played\nvideo games growing up but we definitely\nwere learning\nfrom each other kind of different\ndifferent hobbies and stuff so\nthat's awesome and so it sounds like\nwhen you were\nwhen you were ready to become a\nfull-time streamer like i'm assuming\nthat things sort of gradually picked up\nand it was sort of like a stable shift\nor was it really like kind of rolling\nthe dice um\ni i would say it was pretty stable a\ngradual increase until fortnight\nhappened\nand then everything kind of exploded in\na way that\nkind of nobody expected i mean there's\nno way you could go into it and be like\noh yeah one day\nfortnite's gonna come out and my\ncareer's gonna skyrocket and i'm gonna\nyeah i met tyler ninja and we became\nfriends and during pub g before fortnite\neven happened and\na bunch of people like it was wild it\nwas an unprecedented kind of thing and\nactually that's where\naround that times when she took a a\nlarger role\non the on the the business side of stuff\nfor me because\nbefore fortnight um\nlike my business email wasn't really\ninundated with a lot of stuff\nand then fortnite happened popularity\nabsolutely skyrocketed\nuh and suddenly i was getting like waves\nof emails\nand requests to do things and and you\nknow\nad opportunities all sorts of stuff and\ni needed somebody i i can't i couldn't\nsit there and check my email\nthe whole time so i that's where she\nstepped into the role of being the\nmanager for my job\num so i i don't even really look at my\nwork email too much\nuh she does a lot of it and then we also\nhave a management team on\non the back end that takes care of a lot\nof the coordination for\ncontractual stuff all that but i it it\nwas in the span of i would say like\nsix months where it went from a pretty\neasily\nmanageable thing for one person and then\nit exploded and i needed to back up\nreal quick and she stepped up to the\nplate uh without missing a beat\nwow yeah it's i don't know if you guys\ncould tell from my\nyou know when i added y'all as friends\nor when i messaged you and i was like i\nwas a little bit confused\nit's because i'm like matt and i don't\nunderstand what's happening\ni just i just was like maybe this is the\nwrong one that i added yeah no i was\nlike oh this is\nwonderful nice to meet you and i was\nlike a little bit concerned\nand then i was also like oh okay baby\nand so i'm i'm the same way and it's\nyou know it's interesting because um in\nmy case it sort of happened almost\nslightly in reverse so i was running\nhealthy gamer for about a year and no\none had heard of us\nand then my wife took over and now\npeople have heard of us\nhooray and and and so\nit's really interesting to hear like how\ndo you guys kind of manage\ni mean i i don't even know how i would\ngo about answering that question if\nsomeone asked it to me\nany um you know i was just curious\nwhat's what's the experience been like\nworking together\num it is there\nyou have to separate benjamin and\nsamantha\nfrom dr lupo and mrs dr lupo that the\nrelationships almost have to be\ndifferent relationships because we'll\neven we'll even\nuh remind the other person when we're\nabout to talk about something for like\nstreaming or whatever it is like by the\nway this is between me and my manager\nnot husband and wife right now and\nthat's the we have to set the\nlike the tone for the conversation so\notherwise things i think can get kind of\nmuddied if you're\nthere are certain business opportunities\nlike hey you have a whole crap ton of\nviewers today you should probably keep\nstreaming for like another half hour or\nhour past when you would normally end\nand the wife side would say no you know\nwe have a schedule for reason come\nupstairs\nbut then the manager side is like yeah\nyou don't get this opportunity very very\noften so it's\nit is uh it's a balancing act of what is\nof you know what which conversation\nyou're having either the business side\nor the non-business side\nand sometimes we have to start the\nconversation or even mid-conversation we\nhave to stop and be like who are you\ntalking to right now yeah\ncause cause i might be coming to him as\nsam and he might be coming to me as dr\nlupo\nand you can tell real quick in the\nconversation that\nwe're not talking to the same person so\nwe have to be like wait\nwhich hat are we both putting on because\nwe both need to be in the same mindset\nfor it\nyeah so i'm noticing that there's\nthere's some pretty clear boundary\nsetting in terms of like\nyou know what is this a business\nconversation or a personal conversation\ndefinitely um yeah i sometimes joke\nabout this is\nyou know i think part of the the fun is\nthat this is the one situation\nwhere potentially sexual harassment\nbetween employees is\nacceptable\ngood thing hr's never seen any stuff\nwe've done to each other okay i mean i\nam hr so\n[Laughter]\nso you know uh\nbut so and and what\nyeah i i i'm gonna just ask a couple\nmore questions is that cool\nyeah so like how did you guys decide um\nto have children\nor a kid sounds like you'll have one\ncorrect\nyou want to start\nhow do we decide i can i can at least\nset the precedent\nout of the gate i'm going to be honest i\ni know that i'm i play video games all\nday\ni'm a man child uh you know there's only\na certain amount of\nexternal focus that my brain has the\ncapacity to give out and so i\ni initially didn't want to i just\ni didn't i didn't want kids uh to start\nwith and then\ni think things started to change when i\nwas exposed more and more to\nbecause she was a photographer so she\nwould work with like babies to take\npictures and stuff like that and being\nshown those things\num changed my opinion because it's it's\nkind of incredible what a little human\nbeing can learn to do and now that we\nhave\ncharlie i'm like it's it's like watching\na cloned version of me slowly grow up\nand\nand being able to see the see him\nexperiencing things like mario\nand and all the games that i loved when\ni was little when i was hit his age\nwatching someone else see those things\nand experiencing them for the first time\nis i mean it's a pretty typical\nstereotypical parent thing to do but i'm\nliving vicariously\nthrough him seeing those things for the\nfirst time it's\nabsolutely amazing i've always wanted to\nbe\na parent a mom uh like i said before my\nbrother was born\nwith mental physical disabilities when i\nwas 10 and around 12 my mom kind of went\nm.i.a for a few years\nso i was the mom for about 12 to 14\nish and um she\nyou know she's back she's great\neverything's all good\nuh but i i just always knew\nafter taking care of my brother that i\nwanted to be a mom even at 12 i was good\nat it\nand my mom uh did a daycare growing up\nand then once i got into photography i\nmean a lot of those kids\ni was just talking about this a couple\ndays ago my oldest or my longest running\nclient\nis now 16 and i met her when she was one\num and so it's just it's\nwatching all those kids grow up and it's\njust something that i've always wanted\nto do\nand i know i never wanted a big family\nlike one\nmaybe two if someone really pushed me i\ni think it's important to explain\nsome of the other reasoning behind that\nwith your brother\nyeah so i am potentially a carrier of my\nbrother's uh genetic mental disorder\nand um we we don't have know like\nthe exact name that he has because back\nthen the testing was not there and\navailable\nnow i don't want to just go poke and\nprod him just so i can figure it out or\nnot\nso we tried with charlie and charlie's\n100\ngood and golden and uh so we got we got\nlucky with that\num and so i never wanted a large family\nbecause there's always still that\npossibility that\ni can pass on if we have another son but\num yeah do you remember uh how you told\nme that you were ready to have kids\nno i don't you're at least not looking\nat my head\noh god you\nand this is this is one way that we used\nto communicate to each other um\nis is you know one of us we weren't\nliving\ntogether for obviously a beginning of\nour relationship but\nuh there was some nights like if\nsomething was really on our minds\nwe would just write it all out in an\nemail and send it to the other person\nand be like oh yeah\ni just sent you an email so before yeah\nbefore i get absolutely ridiculed for\nthis for\nfor eternity okay it was one of the it\nwas the way that we\nwe decided was like best for just\nsometimes it's easier to get your\nthoughts out if you have time to write\nthem down and stare at them for a little\nbit\nand and consider the correct phrasing\nand then we send it along right\ninstead of like a face-to-face\nconversation sometimes especially about\nsomething like that where even\ninternally i'm like i don't know what\nthe right thing to do is what the right\nright thing to say is you you can\nmuddy the waters real quick if you\nmisspeak and then you have to backpedal\nand and blah blah you know so i so\nbefore i get\npeople go in on me over this yeah i\nwrote an email because it was the right\ni remember now because it was the\neasiest way to write out my thoughts and\nthen look at my own thoughts and see if\nthat's like it's like\nis that what i really mean to say or is\nthere a better way to phrase it so that\nit makes sense or even if that is is\nthat the way that you actually feel\nor is that something that you're just\nkind of feeling like you have to feel\nkind of think too yeah i i think thanks\nfor clarifying that because oddly enough\nthat's actually something i recommend\nto my patients is that you know a lot of\ntimes if we think about the most\nimportant communications there are two\nthings that we can never get back\none is time that's passed and the second\nis the words that leave our mouth\nand and so it's kind of interesting\nbecause if you really have something\nsuper important you know when you said\nwrote you an email i mean i was\nimagining a\none-liner which is like okay let's have\nkids\nokay thanks mike i mean there were some\nthat were like that\nbut between us but yeah it was the\nchildren go go go go go go go\nand then you know so so but what i what\ni'm hearing is it's it's not really so\nmuch an email as it was like a letter\nyeah right just in electronic format\nyeah that it was\nyou thought about it a lot you expressed\na lot um\ni'm still a little bit surprised to be\nhonest ben\nbecause i can't imagine that looking at\npictures of babies and this is probably\nme just projecting because it's just\nmy experience is like oh it wasn't just\nlooking at pictures it was like\nit so she did her photography uh\nwhen we got married one of the things\nthat i did is take on a job that i\ndidn't necessarily want to provide\nenough money so that she could leave\nher she quit her studio job so she could\nstart her own business\nthat was one of the things that we did\num but that i did because\nshe had worked her butt off when i\ndidn't have a job and\nand trying to get to a stable place and\nso when\nwhen i had the opportunity to give back\ni did that\nbut she ran her business out of our\nhouse and so\ni got to see in person these little tiny\nsnuggly you know human loaves of bread\nis what they basically boil down to\nwhen they're when they're that young and\nand that was one of the big things for\nme that\nhelped that that i would say i mean\nhelped it's everybody's\nultimately the path you take and whether\nyou have kids or not is is going to be\nindividual for each person right my\npath isn't going to be different than\nsomebody else's but i definitely was one\nthat was like i don't want\nto to have kids and i started to see the\nseed babies\nin person in a way that i hadn't before\nbecause she's so good with kids man\nshe working with kids through\nphotography studio and like\nit's wild some of the stuff that that i\nhave learned from watching her work\nthat it opened up a different side of of\nan infant to me that i didn't really\nexpect right because\nbefore before seeing that my exposure to\nthem was so limited because i'm the\nyoungest of four\nin my family so i never there were never\nany babies around and all i knew was\nlike\nthat it's just gonna cry a lot it's\ngonna poop i'm gonna have to clean it up\nand then and and feed it and then\nhopefully it's still not upset about\nsomething\nbut then she kind of she changed my\nopinion\non on pretty much all of it as a whole\nbecause yeah there's\nthere's that stuff and as a parent you\nend up with like poop on your\nfingernails in a way you wouldn't expect\nright when you change your diapers and\nall that but but when you actually get\nto hold\nit's it if you have kids you know what\ni'm talking about it's it's almost an\nindescribable thing\nto see your you know your your offspring\nslowly turn into a human being that can\ndo things it's crazy\nyeah absolutely so i'm guessing that sam\nuh ben you knew that sam wanted to have\nkids\num i knew yeah and had you guys\nhad you all talked about it before was\nit sort of like because when you said\nlike i\ni'm ready so you you send off the email\nbut like\nwas the assumption that sam was already\nready\nor wanted to have kids before that so\nyou were sort of like\nyou know i know i think i really like\nand\nyeah i don't think i ever felt like it\nwas a waiting for me kind of thing i\nthink it was more like\na waiting for us to come to a mutual\nagreement\nkind of thing because i think she she\nknew that\ni was not interested and i knew that she\nwas interested\nand it eventually we\nfound our way to a mutual agreement and\nit was just not like she forced me\nor strong handed me and to be like give\nme your seed\nit just eventually like i i decided\non my own that having a kid was the\nright idea\nthere were definitely lots of\nconversations and stuff leading up\nto that letter being sent um yeah there\nwere there were situations where\nyou just flat out said that you would\nnever change your mind and uh\nand obviously that was something that i\nhad to sit and really think about if\nthat's something that i'm\nokay with you know not being a mom and\nso it taken a few years i mean\nwhat we got pregnant five years\nafter charlie or after we got married so\nuh\nso we never really rushed into anything\nwith it and i was totally okay being an\nolder\nparent as well um so i had charlie when\ni was 30\nwhen all my friends were having them\nwhen having their kids like when they\nwere 23\n24 and stuff like that and i was totally\nfine\nwith waiting if that's just what it took\num\nso it wasn't just like i knew from day\none and then\nand then i was just like okay but it was\nconversations that definitely led up to\nthat letter being sent and then even\nthen we still had plenty of\nconversations\nafter that letter of like\nokay but now that now that i heard your\nside and you know my side let's like\npush them together and make sure 100\nthat we're on the same page before we\ndive into this\nforever long thing okay you want to\nactually\nhow about now because this is also very\ntelling about the\nabout where we are now when we have\nconversations about kids\nbecause she so so she\nmade the one for us and did 99.9\nof the work and now i've god\nyou're gonna do the second one well\nplease\nif only uh no i i have kind of changed\ngears to where i wouldn't be upset if we\nhad another kid\nand i would not be upset having another\nkid either but it's not coming out of me\nyeah that's that's one of the\nstipulations but i i definitely never\nsaw myself as someone who was like yeah\ni could\ni could have a second one um and i think\nthat it definitely helps seeing like\nwe went to we went over to my mom's\nhouse for mother's day uh\nthis weekend and i saw other family\nmembers there and my one of my\nolder brothers has three and their\nyoungest\nis adorable and uh she's\nnot a year yet almost one almost one but\nlike they're they're typically pretty\ntimid about interactions and she came\nhere and read and like climbed up on me\nand gave me a hug and i about melted\ninto a puddle\nit was it it's just it's such a cool\nexperience\nthat i never thought i would i would be\nlike yeah i'm on board let's go again\ni'm i'm ready uh so you know\nben and sam i've been sort of thinking\nat the be since the beginning of this\nconversation if there's some way that i\ncan be helpful\num so when y'all came on today i i was\nreally thinking that what y'all share is\nnot really necessarily for your benefit\nit's actually for like\nother people's benefit you know to share\nlike a lot of interesting things about\nyou know relationships relationships\nwith streamers\nrelationships with people in gaming you\nknow how do you kind of adapt how do you\ndecide to have kids how do you raise\nkids all that good stuff\nbut i'm wondering uh but for most people\nthat come on i'm\ntrying to help them with something right\nand and i'm just curious whether\num there's something that i could be\nhelpful with here in terms of just\nfacilitating it sounds like you guys are\nreally solid communicators\num uh but you know is this something\nthat\nit should i ask y'all questions about\nthis and and maybe we can try to have a\nconversation about it or\nwhatever you think is going to be best\ni'm fine yeah well i mean i don't know\nabout about you benjamin but you and i\nhave\nthese conversation it's like with you\nknow you're\nfirst dating somebody and you're laying\nin bed at night and you're like i wonder\nwhat our life in the future would be\nlike and you start thinking about all\nthat kind of stuff and that's kind of\nlike the stage\nwhere i feel like we both\nare it's just like you you know i wonder\nwhat a little girl version of us\nwould look like but at the same time i'm\nlike but it's not again it's not i'm not\ndoing that again\nyeah oh yeah i i think ultimately it's\nmostly hyperbole of us\njust just yeah it's just saying it to\nsay it because\ni i mean the way we are right now i\ndon't know if we could fit\nhaving another kid into you know the the\npower trio that we currently have just\nbe given the circumstances and how busy\ni am and how much she works behind the\nscenes for us and\ntaking care of boy all day and that kind\nof thing so it it's\nin this situation i think it's more of\njust like a kind of a joking poking fun\nat each other\nyes which is the thing that we do a lot\nit's i think\none of my you know how we have do we\nhave conversations about love languages\ni always tell her that one of my\nmy main love languages is sarcasm uh\nbecause we messed with each other a lot\nbehind the scenes um but it's just part\nof the i think part of the dynamic\nand this is another one of those things\nbecause i know that i know that she\ndoesn't want to\ngrow another child uh and so i will\nsometimes if like if we're\nabout to go to bed i'll tease her and\nput my hand on her stomach and tell her\nthat i can feel\nthe baby kicking and [ __ ] like that like\nwe i poke fun of her a lot\ni won't say we i i'll say me i do it a\nlot uh can i\ncan i push y'all sure want to be pushed\nare you going\nso like i'm wondering whether um ben is\ndoing his equivalent of grabbing your\narm on the way out\nright so what i'm what i'm noticing is\nthat ben is respecting\nyour boundary in terms of\nsam saying like i'm okay with having\nanother kid theoretically it's just not\ncoming out of me\nand and yet ben is also like i wouldn't\nmind having another one\nright so we've had this conversation\nabout i'm totally\n100 down with adopting yep um and that\nis something that benjamin has\nexpressed that he is not a hundred\npercent sure if that's where\nhe sits comfortable with\num so sam can i do you mind if i ask a\ncouple of questions about\num you know your\nbecause i so easy to skirt\nto move into [ __ ] territory here but\num\nso so i do please do go ahead i'm just\nnoticing that i\ni think you know when when ben says\nsomething like\nand i feel sort of comfortable pushing\nthis because you guys clearly do have\nsuch a strong marriage you clearly do\ncommunicate really well\nand so it's kind of hard because like\nyou guys do 90 of what i teach\nso now like in terms of what i'm trying\nto think about like can i help y'all in\nsome way i think it's maybe actually\nlike asking hard questions and bringing\nthings to the surface\num so sam can you help me understand\nuh you know how you came to the decision\nthat you did not want to grow another\nhuman being\num i just did okay\nso when i imagine what i imagined\npregnancy before i\ngot pregnant is basically the chest\nburster\nfrom from alien\nuh and uh so anytime that anybody's like\npregnant and they want me to touch their\nbelly and stuff like that\ni know it freaks me out i really did not\nenjoy a single\nlike long stretch of pregnancy there was\nlittle sprinkles on that there of like\ncool and everything but deep i don't\nbend if you remember the first time that\ncharlie moved to my stomach and we sat\nthere and watched it\ni was like shaking freaking out because\nwatching something move underneath your\nskin is terrifying\nall of a sudden you're like oh there's\nhis elbow\num so on top of i had a really bad first\ntrimester um i\nhave the whole thing potentially you\nknow passing on what my brother has in\nthe back of my mind on top of it\nuh i just wasn't super comfortable\nmentally with you know having something\ngrowing inside of me and i don't know if\nthat's something that i can\nget over i also since charlie was born\ni've contracted chronic lyme disease\num and so i'm already at the point of\nbeing as tired as somebody can be\nwithout passing out\num i can't imagine adding in pregnancy\ntiredness\non top of that uh and i didn't enjoy\nthe birth i didn't enjoy the afterwards\nthere's a reason why there's a chemical\nin women's brains that make you forget\nbirthing because nobody would do that a\nsecond time if they really\nthought about it yeah unless like they\nhad the easiest pregnancies ever\nkind of thing so that's where i am\nwhat region of the you guys are in the\nyep we yeah we're in nebraska\ninteresting you guys get a lot of lyme\ndisease up there\num being in uh\nbeing a photographer you spend a ton of\ntime out in the fields\nah deer ticks yep um so i\ni specifically remember when i found a\ntick on me\nuh and it wasn't until a few months\nafter that\nand you know years later all the timing\nlined up i go to see a doctor and\nuh after almost man uh\nsix months or so testing of stuff she\njust told me i'd left over part of\na flu and a year and a half after that\ndidn't go away and found a new doctor\ngot diagnosed and there we go i'm sorry\nthat\nyou're having to deal with that it's\nactually one of the most frustrating\nthings to deal with that i've seen\nmedically\nit is very frustrating but you know i've\nalways\nhad lots of you know ups and downs in my\nlife that\nyou i'm okay with the negative stuff\nhappening because it always ends up\nleading me to where i currently am in my\nlife\nso yeah so so sam you know that makes\nperfect sense\nin terms of pregnancy is is\nstatistically the most dangerous thing\nthat the average woman ever does um\nin terms of disability mortality\nit is it is like literally it's it's the\nmost dangerous part\nof your life statistically um\nyou know and and and so obviously if it\nyou know if it felt awful like i'm kind\nof with you in terms i mean as much as i\ncan be\nin terms of you know recognizing that my\nwife\nshe decided to go through it twice um\nbut\nyou know i think as you guys i'm sure\nyou all understand it's a very\nindividual decision just like having\ncharlie was like a really individual\ndecision it's not even like\ncouple like even within a couple so\nthere's like individual\nindividuality within a couple and then\nthe the timing of when you decide to\nhave a child and stuff like that i mean\nthere's so much individuality there\nthe one thing sam that i'm just a little\nbit concerned about\nand this is where you know you can swat\nthe societies\nsometimes when i'm working with people\nwho have a fear\nthe fear tends to manifest in\na very irrefutable way so like for\nexample like i've worked with people who\nhave had\num you know one special needs child or\nlike\nfirst and then decided to have a second\none or people who have had\none healthy child and then discover that\nthere is a like a genetic risk\nit's a really challenging thing it's\nkind of bizarre but um\nyou know i'm just wondering whether\na part of your mind and this is where i\nfeel like i'm going into [ __ ]\nterritory but i'm just going gonna be\ntransparent\nwhether a part of your mind because of\nthat fear of what could happen\nis like pointing to things that clearly\nlike no one can blame you for\nright so like does that make sense yeah\nwhat do you think about that\num i know that i'm a person that\ndwells on fears benjamin can attest to\nthat\na lot uh that um\ni want to say that i let fear control\nmy life but there's definitely certain\ntypes of fears that\ni have a hard time you know facing and\nletting go of\nsnakes and uh\nbecause they don't let go of you yeah\nyou're you're not helping\nyou're not helping bad experience in\nkindergarten okay like with a big one\num so i don't know i mean\nif if if ben came to me\nin in the the same seriousness as\nwriting that letter and said\ni would love to have a second child with\nyou and i would love for it to be\nbetween just me and you\nthen it would be a okay let's sit down\nlet's figure out\nwhat we can do to make things better for\nme\nyou know if we can ahead of time now\nthat we know now that we know\npotentially how i react to pregnancy and\nstuff like that\num but as far as like\nhaving a second child added to our\nfamily\ni'm 100 on board when we get to that\nserious point of conversation\nof sure let's have a second child\nbut it again then\nyou're not next to me management but i'm\nstaring at you if you ever came to me\nand you're just like\nyes if if we have a second child and i\nwant one it\nit i would love for it to be between me\nand you only then\nyeah i'm not gonna be like no definitely\nnot\nbut in this moment where i feel like we\naren't\nwe're more on like the hypothetical it\nwould be cool\njoking kind of situation of having a\nchild then yeah i'm going to stay on my\nground about\nnot wanting to to birth another child\ni want to be clear too i it's not\nlike with the with the having one that\nis biologically bold of ours versus\nadoption i have no issue with adoption i\nthink adoption is wonderful i think it's\nan amazing thing that you\nyou can find people that choose to love\nsomeone as their own and versus there\nare some biological relationships\nobviously that are not great that the\nyou have abuse of parents and stuff like\nthat so adoption is like\nadoption is one of the most beautiful\nthings i think that\nwe as as human beings have decided to do\ni just i just it's not like a like a\napproval or disapproval for me it's more\nof a\ni just haven't spent the time to think\nabout if that's the way that i would\nwant to go\nget if we ever got to the point where we\nwant a second\nwe kid oh no no no i'm not\nstumped i'm quite the opposite i'm just\ntrying to figure out how far i want to\ngo\nso this is probably further than we've\nhad as a conversation on the serious\nside of things about this\never sam can you tell me what growing up\nwas like with your younger brother\num sometimes i wish he wasn't there\njust because my parents divorced right\nafter he was born\nmom bounced is really difficult\nuh he was in and out of hospitals for\nhis first five years\nuh do with surgeries and stuff like that\nand then his mental health or\nmental disability on top of it\nbut i love him to death i told my\nparents the first week that he was born\nthat\nwhen they can't take care of him that i\nwill and i've stuck to that\nand i'm getting all teary because i love\nmy brother so much\num i've broken up relationships with\npeople that couldn't handle him\num ben charged in\nhead first with my brother and\nuh and has agreed from day one of\nmeeting him\nthat he will one day be our\nresponsibility\num yeah this i mean obviously it's\ndifficult when you're when your\nsibling's 10 years apart but then on top\nof it\nyou know a parent is gone you're going\nthrough your own\nchange as a preteen and you know\nthen you have a baby to take care of too\nobviously that's rough\nso i'm just gonna go for it so\num i'm gonna talk now\nokay i'm gonna use words like imagine\nso like here's what i'm thinking if i\nput myself in your shoes sam\nyou know like you said you love your\nbrother a lot and it can be kind of\nconfusing because you can love him\nand you can also like sort of\nyou can have thoughts that you wish he\nwas never there right\nand and you can see like what he did i\nmean unclear whether\nhe's i don't think he split up your\nparents but you know\nit's it's an additional stress so a lot\nof times what happens is when a special\nneeds child enters a family\nit just exposes the weaknesses that are\nalready there\nright it's an additional pressure um it\nsounds like you really stepped up\nin an amazing way between the ages of 12\nand 14 and i would guess that\nyou don't regret that for a second and\nit sucked\nand and so you know i i'm kind of\nhearing the same thing\nabout pregnancy is that i'm sure you\ndon't\nregret it but it was awful\nand you would never want to do it again\nmakes perfect sense right not even\nhaving been pregnant\ni can completely get behind you there\nand at the same time i wonder if if you\nknow as someone who does sort of have\nfears kind of like hang out in the back\nof your mind\num i mean you have to\ni guess i don't i shouldn't say that but\ni i can't imagine a world in which you\nhaven't had a thought\nabout like what you're signing your son\nup for if you do have\na second biological child what you're\nsigning like whether you're essentially\nrepeating history\nand like what are you signing charlie up\nfor\nand what kind of pressure is it gonna\nput on you guys\nand whether that sort of holds you back\ni feel like ben and i are\nstronger than my parents were my parents\num\nfrom the age of about six until i was\nabout 12\nwould be separated back together\nand you know i feel like my brother was\nprobably kind of that one last ditch\neffort which obviously\nvery rarely works to save a marriage um\nand uh so yeah they lived apart they\nmy dad lived in the basement they were\nback together and everything was fine\nand a year later\nmy mom would move out this time and so\non and so forth so\ndefinitely for sure my brother was the\nbreaking point of them realizing that\nit just isn't working yeah\nand and do you ever think about what it\nwould mean for charlie if you guys oh\nmy camera just oh there we go do you\never think about what it would mean for\ncharlie if you guys did have a\nspecial needs child yeah for sure um\nit it it would suck especially because\nhe's younger\ni mean at 10 i was able to kind of grasp\nthe idea of what my future was going to\nbe like\num but let's say i get pregnant next\nmonth\nand so he'll be six by the time a baby\ngets here\nand you won't especially my brother's\ndisability\nwe don't know if we didn't notice it\nearlier because we were more focused on\nthe physical disability than the mental\nbut we didn't know about my brother's\nmental disability until he was about a\nyear and a half old\num because he was already so delayed\nwith his physical disability we just\nkind of\nattributed everything to that until all\nof a sudden we realized that\nhe's not talking um\nso yeah i mean of course i i\nworry that that it would make\ncharlie's life harder and it's obviously\nalready hard as\nan only child to have a sibling come in\nsometimes at the beginning\num and i and i just think\nthat not that my brother has like a bad\nlife\nat all uh but if there\nthere's other kids out there that are\nalready here\nand already have a potentially\nyou know not so great life because\nthey're in the adoption system or\nphosphorous system whatever\ni feel like i could at least\nsave them maybe um\nkind of thing so yeah i'm sort of\nhearing like uh\nyou know having a biological child comes\nwith particular\nrisks and because i sam i know it sounds\nkind of weird but\nyou know i know pregnancy is sort of\nvery uncomfortable and stuff but just\nhearing you getting to know you a little\nbit like i find it hard to believe that\nand this may be me being an [ __ ] like\ni think you've demonstrated so much\nstrength so much resilience\nthat i just find myself i don't know why\nmaybe this means i'm mean\nor something but like i find myself\nbeing a little bit surprised that that's\nwhat would hold you back like physical\ndiscomfort like hold you back\nyou know maybe i don't know you that\nwell but you know\ni don't know i mean especially if we\nhave a girl like if we have a girl then\nwe're golden\nbecause women don't only pass this\ndisorder on to their sons\nvery rarely do they does it show up in a\nfemale\nyeah but even then like as soon as we\nfound out that we were having a boy\nuh both ben and i are anxiety like we\nwere excited but our anxiety went up and\nwe're like oh okay\nwell i mean now what how do we do we\nneed to start doing research what kind\nof and we did the extra tests and stuff\nlike that beforehand\nto make sure things were good but just\nthe anxiety of going up to that\nappointment and finding out if we were\nhaving a boy or a girl for both of us\nif i remember correctly was very high we\nwere very excited\nyou know super stoked talking about the\nwhole week up but walking in there that\nwas kind of like our moment of\ndo we need to\ndo we need to potentially change and\nlearn a lot of stuff\nin this very moment or are we going to\nbe okay if we have a girl\nkind of thing so it sounds like you guys\nwere aware that there was a risk of this\nwhen you had your first kid\ncorrect yep and and how did you\nhow did you guys manage that\nyeah lots of anxiety\ni think it was around six months with\ncharlie that we that\nit was very obvious that there there was\nyou know\nnothing present uh and\neven i remember after charlie was born\nthere was a couple times that\nthat ben had pulled me aside and he was\njust like do you\nrecognize anything in charlie that that\nyou remember from your brother\nuh just you know every randomly every\nfew months or whatever leading up until\nwe we realized that you know\nwe're we're good to go um\nso a lot of anxiety\nyeah that that makes a lot of sense\nyou know and and ben um can\nam i have i stepped out of line yet no\ni'll yell at you if you do don't worry\nyeah i'm i'm just i'm not kidding i'm\nrelying on you to do that okay\nthis is stuff that she's openly talked\nabout with other people and that we've\ntalked about like\nso with with her brother um\none of the things that early in our\nrelationship that i wanted to establish\nand like\nit we wrote our own vows for our wedding\nand i included\nin there that that her brother i keep\ni'm trying to avoid saying\nnames just in case i'm sure but i i made\nsure that she knew that i was going to\nbe supportive for her brother and\nprovide if if it came time to provide\nsomewhere for him to live i was\nthere ready to go um but like we i've\ndone a bunch of charity stuff with my\nchannel\nand the first two charity streams we\never did were for the national fragile x\nfoundation which is similar fragile x's\nof what her brother has or something\nsimilar to it it was just\nit was such an important thing for me to\nmake sure that she understood because\nobviously it was like such a main piece\nof her life growing up it was a focus\naround potentially why her parents split\nup and and it was one of the\nthe most difficult times for her life\nhaving to raise her brother and\nlike that's important to her and she's\nimportant to me so i wanted to make sure\nthat\nshe knew that i was on board no matter\nwhat ended up happening whether we had\nto you know take her brother on as part\nof our life\nuh eventually whether it was earlier or\nlater that i was\nthere ready to go wow\nand what you're saying sam makes a ton\nof sense so can i just\nshare what i kind of heard from you and\ni'm going to inject a little bit of my\nown\num i'm going to fill in some of the gaps\nin my mind so let me know if those are\nlike\nyou know could be completely off so like\ni i can't imagine i mean you guys\ndidn't really know right like y'all\nrolled the dice once\nand you guys hit the jackpot with\ncharlie like in every way\nvery much and i can imagine that like\nyou know rolling the dice once was\nbad enough and if you guys like win\nright like if i bought gme at 50 cents\nand it rose to 300 and i decided to sell\nyou know and i like like and then gme\nlike bob's down again like i don't even\nknow if i want to get back on that\nroller coaster\nyou know i won once it's clearly enough\nfor me to retire on\nright like you know it sounds like y'all\nare happy and you guys have an amazing\nson\nand there's a part that's like why even\nbother\nand then there's also like this sort of\nlike two birds with one stone thing\nright because\nthere are kids out there who don't have\nsuch a good life\nand you know if you guys decide that you\nguys have the bandwidth for another kid\nyou can sort of like give a child who\ndoesn't have a promising life\nlike what sounds to me to be unless you\nguys are really just super sociopathic\nand i miss something completely\na loving home right with like two\nparents who like really care about their\ntheir child a lot their children a lot\ntwo parents who communicate a lot\nto parents who strive really hard to be\ngood parents\nand there's already a kid out there who\ndoesn't have that\nso you know why go back you know\nwhy go back to the gambling table when\nyou know there's there's a kid out there\nwho may need your love and already\nexists\num how is that for a summary\ni would say you can hear the vacuum\ncleaner our cleaning companies just\nfinishing up\num i mean for me that that's 100\npercent like especially with um there's\nbeen a few times\nin taking photos and stuff like that\nthat i've had to call cps\nbecause you know you a kid isn't smiling\nand their dad takes him into the\nbathroom and you can hear him\nhitting the child like sorry that\nflashback\num i'm having to call the cops on them\nand making a huge scene\nbut got the kid out of there\num there's kids that are already hurting\ni want to be able to help him\n[Laughter]\nbut i'm also totally fine being three\nmusketeers too\nhe is a handful sometimes let's not\npretend that he did\ni think every kid because he's a little\nclone of me uh\nlet's remember that the three musketeers\nhad dartanian right\nright nobody really remembered\nyeah true true if there's if there's\never\nan analogy that says that you guys\nshould adopt it's the three musketeers\nthat reference is basically like there's\nthe three of us\nand then there's a rando from the\noutside that we're bringing in\nit's like that\n[Music]\nyou know younger different\nyou know and it's also interesting\nbecause what i'm hearing from\nif you really think about it like ben\nhas\nit seems like a lot of ben's inspiration\nto have a child actually came from a\nchild that wasn't his own right like\ni remember still just for myself like\nbeing\nreally uninterested in children\nlike when i was doing pediatrics and\nstuff in ob gyn\nlike those were probably my two least\nfavorite rotations in medical school\nand like with kids i just didn't you\nknow i didn't really get them like i was\ngood with kids\nbut i just had no you know i didn't\nthink they were particularly cute i\nthought they were and then like once i\nhad a kid it's like some switch flipped\nin my brain\nand and i i know personally at least\nlike you know my my wife and i\nroutinely talk about like you know when\nwe'll see like an you know we visited a\nfriend\nyesterday and they have a young kid and\njust holding like you guys know the\ndenseness of a baby\nyeah how like th you know they stay the\nsame weight but they just\nstretch out and so like feeling that\ndenseness it's one of the things that i\nreally like you know it's just a\nphysical sensation that's associated\nwith a lot of good emotion for me just\nlike holding\nlike a baby and then we'll do it\nsometimes and then like we had this\nbrief con\nnot even a conversation it was like one\nexchange it was like\ndo you want to have another one i was\nlike nope i'm good and then she's like\nyep\nme too i i think going through it\ntwice i mean there are times where we\nlose our minds a little bit and we think\nabout it but\ni think we're set i think there's every\nparent there's certain nights where\nyou crash into bed at the end of the\nnight and you look at each other you're\nlike why the hell did we decide to do\nthis in the first place yeah\nyeah yeah\nyeah so it sounds like um\nhmm yeah i i'm it feels to me like this\nis tied up a little bit i i don't\nhow do y'all feel about that i think\nthat's true\ni mean this is one of those things that\nwe've talked about at least semi\nregularly over the last\nmultiple years of being together of like\nwhat direction do we are we going to go\nif we ever go one way or another\nand it's i especially with how busy busy\nwe are right now\nbecause i never do you can't imagine\nthat this is going to be your job like i\nnever\ni i i especially because the beginning i\ngot into streaming as like a side thing\nright it was never really intended to be\nmy full-time gig and then suddenly here\nwe are\nuh i i think it's something that we've\nhad a pin in just\njust kind of sitting aside for a while\nand it doesn't really surprise me if\nif this is the way it continues to go\nfor a while too\njump into anything like oh yeah yeah we\ntend to be pretty practical when it\ncomes to doing most things in our life\ni'm not impulsive i sit in my basement\nand play video games all day this is\nnice\nyou know it's not like hey let's just\nhave a kid today for fun it's that's not\nthe kind of\nthat's not the kind of decision making\nyou're gonna find here yeah you don't\njust\nrandomly change your raid schedule just\nfor any random\nany random exactly thank you you have to\nalign the 39 other people\nand shift them two hours into the future\nnow i before anybody goes after that one\nthat was\nthis was like a i need to change what\ni'm doing just so everybody knows and\nthen\npeople jumped on board with that it\nwasn't like you change or go aft\nyourself\nkind of thing so i was i i try not to\npressure people to do stuff they don't\nwant to do\num i'm sure that you know interacting\nwith the wow guild\nquite so intensely actually probably\nactually helped you in your marriage to\nbe honest because i i find that there's\na lot of communication that has to\nhappen in\na successful wow killed i think it got\nme ready to\nto be a father too because the amount of\nparenting you feel like you have to do\nsomething yeah absolutely the amount of\nyelling that would come out of\nthat room when you were raiding\nsometimes especially when you became\nraid leader because you didn't start out\nas a raid leader you you eventually came\ninto being like the full guild\nleader and stuff like that too like the\namount of yelling\nall the memes that came out of that\nthere was a lot of parenting practice\nyeah\nhe's adopted many an orphan over the\nyeah exactly\num one thing that i do want to say sam\njust you know this isn't something we\nhave to get into now but\num or i would actually recommend against\nit but\nsomething that i just sort of like want\nto mention to you is\ni've worked with a lot of people with\nchronic lyme and um\nyou know we're not entirely sure what\nchronic lyme is do you guys want to\nexplain just for the audience like if\nyou feel comfort i mean you guys\nhave already mentioned it but can you\nexplain uh to people like what your\nunderstanding of what chronic lyme is\num as far as like how it feels and stuff\nor\njust what is it uh basically it\ntick bites you and uh then\nyou never remember scientific words but\nbasically\nyou become sick with the what's inside\nthe tick uh\nyou can usually treat it right away with\nantibiotics and most people are good to\ngo but if it's caught later it kind of\nspreads\nand hides throughout your body and\num you can either like just blast\nyourself with antibiotics non-stop\nand try and see if you can catch it all\nor you with the doctor that i will go\nwith we are just now kind of treating\nthe symptoms\num symptoms are different for everybody\nwhich makes it very difficult\nto diagnose it's also just very\ndifficult to diagnose in the first place\nfor uh the type of illness that it is\nand um and who knows maybe maybe my\ndoctor\ndiagnosed me incorrectly too but uh for\nme\nit's a lot of joint and muscle pain\num and a lot of fatigue uh\nbefore i got on my medication which\nkind of helps me a little bit but i was\ntaking anywhere between\nthree to five naps a day going between\n30 minutes to two hours\num and and the thick of it and now\ni usually need to take one 30 to\n40 minute nap a day if i don't get it\nthen i just\nbecome really cranky um but\nuh if i if i try to think back to\nwhat tired was to me because my first\ndoctor just told me i was tired because\ni had a kid\num and if i think back to like\nthe tiredness that i feel right now and\nit's been four hours since i took my\nmedicine this morning uh\ni could go to sleep and sleep for a\nwhole night's worth of rest\nright now wow and be 100\nokay with that uh but i can't like i\ncan't you know sleep all day long\nso i just pushed through it the the one\nthing i would\nsay sam so it's kind of weird but i'd\nsay probably like historically five\npercent of people in my practice have\nhad chronic lyme\nand and um i do a lot of work that's\nsort of like in complementary and\nalternative medicine\nand what i've actually found is that\nthere's some weird immune stuff\ni don't really know what's going on with\nchronic lyme and they have they'll have\ntheir lyme doctors\nbut i have seen a lot of like clinical\nimprovement through\nsome like things like psychotherapy now\na lot of people will think that if\npsychotherapy\nhelps chronic lyme does that mean that\nit's all in your head i really don't\nthink so\nbecause like you're saying there there\nare physical symptoms that are\nnot really psychological right it's like\nvery clearly something\nphysical is going on but we do know for\nexample that meditation\nimproves like immune markers and things\nlike rheumatoid arthritis\nin lupus other autoimmune or electronic\nlike\nimmune or infectious states um and\nand so i don't know exactly how this\nworks but just having you know talk to\nyou for a little bit there's like\nthere's actually a lot of emotion like\nright under the surface that i think you\ncarry with you\num you kind of mentioned that you know\nfears\nthey don't rent in your mind they buy\nand they pay mortgages\nand and so interestingly enough like i\ni've seen some benefit from that and i\nwas just gonna say it may be something\nthat you wanna like you could think\nabout just in terms of like\nif i tend to think about the body as\nlike a body and mind as a unit right\nand if you're holding on if your mind is\ntrying to process or holding on to like\nnegative emotion\nit just doesn't quite have the ram to\ndeal with\nyou know the physical stuff like you\ncan't do both if you think about\nyou know stress and pregnancy like you\njust can't you could be stressed out or\nyou can be pregnant you can't be both\nbecause that's like all\nyour your body and your mind can handle\nyeah\njust something to think about that you\nknow i've seen a lot of people find\nsome benefit doesn't mean that it's\npsychological and origin i really don't\nthink it is\nbut um you know just letting go because\ni can imagine you also feel like guilty\nfor having some of those thoughts that\nyou had about your brother in the past\nbecause you do love him so much and\nand like i found that you know their way\nyou know you you can let those you can\nyou can evict those fears if you\nyou know you try um\nif you're lucky and if you give it a\nshot so just something to think about\ni hope that wasn't out of line no\ndefinitely i definitely felt like a lot\nof relief\nuh i've done yoga on and off in\nmeditation on and off throughout my life\nbut\nin the past four years i've definitely\nlike really dug into it\nand sometimes like that's all i need is\njust like 10-15 minutes to just go\nif i get overwhelmed because i'm so\ntired of things i just need to\nstep away and you know zen for a minute\nyeah absolutely um so i i noticed that\nwe were supposed to talk about parenting\ntoday\nand i don't think we quite\ngot there how do y'all feel about that\nif this is the way you want it to go\nthen that's i mean that's fine with me\nit i think this is an opportunity for\nyou to ask away if there's anything\nuh related to how where what we do and\nwith charlie and all that i mean now's\nthe time right\nuh sure i mean how how do y'all feel i\nmean this is\nwhat i'm i've always been open to\ntalking about\nfeelings like i've never found it useful\nto\nyou know hide feelings or or anything\nlike that so talking about all the all\nthat with\npregnancy and everything and babies and\ncool like i think it's definitely\nsomething afterwards that ben and i will\nsit down and kind of probably go over\nlike the\nthe notes version of of everything\ntogether so\nben do you do you want to talk about\ncharlie\ni could talk about charlie all day\nyeah so let's just i'm i'm a little bit\ncurious maybe we can just kind of get\nlike a short version but like\nso uh if you don't mind me you know\ndon't share any information that\nyeah isn't but like ballpark of how old\nhe is\nuh he's five and a half is [ __ ] enough\nokay\num and so what's it like you know being\njust\nbeing a streamer running a streaming\nbusiness and\nhaving a kid he\nis um the smartest\nlittle human being i think i've ever met\nand that ends up being really really\ngood he\nhe's reading it like first second grade\nlevel already um\nhe's working on math stuff he can\narticulate himself really well\nhe speaks clearly uh he\nthe other side of that though is like he\nis wildly inquisitive\nabout everything so sometimes so i'm in\nmy my studio right now and sam will\nbring me\ncoffee or lunch or whatever because i\nobviously with streaming you have to be\nengaged with your chat the entire time\nor\ndoing something they don't like you just\nsitting there doing nothing um\nand so he'll come down with her but it's\nlike a\n10 minute process of him going through\nevery little shiny because i got a lot\nof toys in this room it's like this is\ni don't blame him at all it's like a\nshiny lights freaking playground\nthe of of all sorts of stuff to look at\nand mess with that he's never messed\nwith before because just it sits down\nhere\nbut that spreads to so many other\naspects of our\nconversation our engagement with him is\nlike\nquestioning of everything and i know\nthat's part of like being five\nand trying to get a handle\nof the social back and forth like at\nthat age obviously he doesn't\nhe doesn't know all social cues he\ndoesn't know yeah when is\nappropriate or not appropriate to talk\nhe doesn't know about\nlike we're working on raising our hand\nuh right now to get\nto get a question in or like hey mommy\nhey daddy i have something to say\nbut he's he's so he's almost like smart\nto a\nto a point of frustration for me because\nhe's a lot like me and that it's like a\ni want to absorb all the knowledge that\ni possibly can\neven for him if it's that if it's like\nto a point of\ninconvenience for someone else he's like\nnow is the time to answer this question\nmommy or daddy let's let's talk about\nwhatever this thing is that i want to\nknow about\nyeah it's interesting um you know you're\nyou talk about his intelligence as a\ndouble-edged sword almost\noh yeah i mean almost i i know that i\nshouldn't look at it like that because i\nwould\ni no you absolutely should you think so\nabsolutely so i had a supervisor who\nblew my mind\none day so like i think we see this a\nlot in\nin you know the gaming community she\nonce told me something that\nshe said that a gifted child is actually\na special needs child\nbecause if you really think about it\nthey actually have needs that the\naverage\nchild may not have right and when we\nthink about special needs we tend to\nthink about it sort of like in a in a\nnegative capacity in terms of like\ninability to do things\nbut i mean i've seen this time and time\nand time again with like you know\ni was sort of this way where like i was\nsmart you know growing up\nand i was kind of like a little bit\nprecocious and\nand like i struggled a lot kind of\nbecause of that\nand and we see this a lot with sort of\nlike these burnt out like gifted kids\nright like you're gifted and that comes\nwith a whole\npile of stuff like expectations\ncapabilities\nfrustration um some of the worst\nsituations that i've ever seen or when\nyou have a kid who's like very gifted\nand has a high iq but also has something\nlike bad adhd or bad anxiety and then\nthey can feel like really really\nstupid right they can feel a lot of\nshame and stuff like that so\ni i think that you know it's kind of\ninteresting because\ni would absolutely you know\nview almost everything about your kid as\na double-edged sword\num and that any capability can be like\nhealthy in one circumstance and also\nlike creates its own challenges and\nneeds in another\nbut i'm sure you guys know that yeah\nit it first came like really stuck in my\nhead that\nthat he is you know everybody says that\ntheir kid is the cutest and the smartest\nand stuff like that so\nthis is mom bragging right now that the\nfirst hit\nwhen we were going to the library and he\nstarted asking about chapter books at\nfive years old\nand now he he doesn't read you know like\nthe regular\nsmall print chapter books but he has the\nearly reader books of like eight\nchapters or so\nand he reads it all in the night and\nhe's just like all right where's the\nnext one and i was like okay\nlike i liked reading when i was a kid\nbut not like this\nhe just wants to absorb all the\nknowledge we're\nwatch so many youtube videos about how\nto fix flat tires\nbecause he wants to just know how to fix\nflat he's obsessed with flat tires so he\nwants to know just in case\nwe somebody gets a flat tire he wants to\nbe the one to be able to help people\nfix the flat tire he wants what's that\nthat youtube guy that he\nhe was watching what was that what's the\nwhat's the youtube channel that he was\nwatching chris\nchris fix this dude does like pov uh\nof like fixing car parts and stuff like\nthat\nand it's like he could he could watch it\nfor an entire day and know all about\nthis stuff in the inside of a car i'm\nlike\nhe's gonna know more about cars than i\ndo it in like\nyou give him a week he'll have it down\npat yeah\ni mean i'm kind of i'm kind of wondering\nwhether he was like watching\nwhen he saw his dad come to his mom's\nrescue\nwhen her car wasn't working\nhe just has such lofty goals for being a\nkid he wants to be\nuh an engineer and a scientist we just\nlearned about what a roboticist is so\nnow he wants to be a roboticist and he\nwants to make robots\nthat uh the robot he wants to make\nfor saint jude because you do a lot of\nwork for saint jude so he's very aware\nof of what goes on there\nis he wants to make a robot that if a\nkid doesn't want to go to their\nappointment the robot will go pick up\nthe kid\nand bring him into their appointment\nit's great\nmy my older kid is somewhere between\nwanting to be a\nprincess an artist\nand a doctor the younger kid is trying\nto decide\nwhether what kind of demon she wants to\nbe\ni want to be her when i grow up because\nlike when they're playing pretend like\none of them is like\ni'm a princess or a queen the other\none's like i'm a monster\n[Laughter]\nit's interesting they're they're very\ndifferent um\nyeah so in any any kind of like uh\nyou know it sounds like charlie's an\namazing kid it sounds like you guys are\nkind of treating him\num you know you're not using a standard\nplaybook i think you guys are kind of\ndevelop like writing the playbook as you\ngo i'm really hearing that from y'all is\nthat fair to say\nyeah i think so and anything um\nyou know anything that you would say to\nyou know streamers or people kind of\nthinking about having kids in terms of\nlike\nhow to make it work well right because\nlike\nmost streamers i mean like i i know you\nknow ben\nand i and and we're not going to comment\non sam's age because i'm sure he's\nvery young because she's older that's\nridiculous\ni don't believe it um\nyou know so i've walked the tightrope as\nwell my friend\nyou know um but i think streamers you\nknow are getting older i think we work\nwith a fair number of streamers that are\nyou know concerned about like how to\nfind like a healthy relationship\nand or thinking about having kids and\nstuff like that i mean\nwhat would you say to people who are\nsort of like on the fence or\ntrying to figure out how to do it um\ni think that everybody's journey is\ngoing to end up being different it's\ngoing to be a personal thing\nthat leads them one way or another in\nfact\nif anything there's a strong parallel\nbetween being a parent and being a\nstreamer and that their people can write\npeople can give advice and write all\nsorts of books about how to do it and\nhow to make it and how to raise your kid\nand all that but there are so many\ndifferent\none-off scenarios instances of every\nsingle person\nevery kid every stream being different\nlike\nyou almost you you can gather so much\ninformation\nand it's still not going to give you the\nright answer and so having\nhave being able to like roll with the\npunches is probably the most important\nthing\nfor me that's that looking at it looking\nback at it now it's like\nas charlie has developed as a kid and as\nmy career has\ngrown and changed over time it's like\nwhat what\nwhat works one day might not work the\nnext day and you just got to be okay\nwith that and figure out what the next\nthing is going to be\nto continue to grow in the right way\nwell set same anything you want to add\nto that i would definitely say that\nthere's\nnever a good time to have a kid\nlike you know everyone's just like you\nknow we're going to wait until we have\nthis and we do this and we do that and\nyada yada\nyou're never going to find an\nopportunity where you're like\neverything's lined up perfectly let's\nhave a child now kind of thing\nuh and that and also\nkind of adding on to ben is that you\nneed to be okay with\nthings constantly changing um and\nespecially with like parents that want\nto stream and they start out kind of\njust like\npart-time but they love it and they want\nto do it so much that they want to go\nfull-time that they don't really\nkind of think too much of the back end\nlike they think that they're going to\nmake enough money\nand then they end up struggling and it\nends up\nyou know harming their family because\nthey can't pay their bills or whatever\nand then\nthe parents mental health is low so then\nthey start getting more frustrated and\nthen they take it out on their kids\nwithout really realizing it and stuff\nand um\ni think especially with being a parent\nfirst and then going into streaming\nyou really need to not put your dreams\naside\nnot saying that because you can do all\nthe things you want to as a parent and\nstuff too\nuh but definitely keeping\nthe whole family in mind\nyou gotta have a plan yeah well yeah\nwhen you have a backup plan we had a\nbackup plan\ni mean when ben started and he jumped\nfrom uh\nworking in his corporate job to working\nin\nin streaming only we had a backup plan\nthat if he\nwent below a certain number within the\nfirst six months he was going to get a\npart-time job somewhere to supplement it\nwhen i jumped from my corporate studio\njob to starting my own business we made\nan agreement that i would have a\nthree-year part-time job\nuh just to make sure that i could\nsupplement uh\nwith everything in the day i hit three\nyears at that part-time job i bounced\num and thankfully for ben it only went\nup from there for him but\nwe we made a plan and we put a timeline\non it and it's not just uh\nif we can't afford food then i'll do\nthis it's like\nyou know if you're gonna do this have\nsteps of where you\nfeel like you can be in what is\nplausible and feasible for your family\nyeah i beautifully put i mean i think\ni'm really hearing you guys\nsort of say like you know planning for\neventualities and planning contingencies\nlike\nyou know it's fine to chase your dreams\nbut do so in a practical manner\ni think too often we kind of think about\noh like you know like i mean we do a lot\nof work with parents and kids\num but these are kids that you know\nmaybe have a video game addiction\nor i think really the primary problem is\ncommunication but\nand you know the kid will will come to\nthe parent will say like oh\nyou know i want to go pro and then like\nthey feel like their parent is not\nsupportive\nand and and sometimes they're not\nsupportive but\ni think there's just a very practical\nyou know you got to plan for it i know\nwe were the same way so when when i was\nstarting healthy gamer i sort of scaled\nback on my day job but i would i would\nliterally work like nights and weekends\nto like support the family\num and and you know that's just sort of\nlike what we had to do because we had to\nmake ends meet\num and and so you kind of got to do what\nyou got to do if it's working part-time\non the side for three years and then\nbouncing and then like i still remember\nlike you know quitting from my nights\nand weekends job because that was like\ntime away from my family that\nthat was a high price to pay but you\nknow we felt like\nit was the right thing to do and it\nfeels good for us is\nwe always remember that everything is a\nseason\nlike with when ben was working\nbasically full-time at his corporate job\nand full-time streaming on nights and\nweekends\nwe knew that in order for it to be\npossible\nthat's just what it needed to be and it\nwasn't gonna be forever\nbecause we were both gonna put our heads\ndown and work our asses off to make it\nwork\nand and then it was and then it got to a\npoint where you know he was able to\nto just do one thing and then he had\nmore time again so\nawesome yeah i i\nthank you guys so much for kind of\nsharing some of your perspectives some\nof your experience\num you know i know i've asked you for\npermission a thousand times whether i\npush too hard\ni'm glad you guys um you know feel like\ni didn't overstep i\ni think it was you know i think it's an\nimportant conversation to have\nit's really fascinating to hear how you\nguys have gotten to where you\nare sounds like y'all are just uh maybe\nnot\njust getting started but in the mid game\nyou know because you all have been\ntogether now for 14 years\ni'm saying that's still just getting\nstarted no no\nno no please say we're at least halfway\nthrough the movie right yeah no i think\ni think it's squarely in the mid game\nlike most people that we interview on\nstream or like in the early game you\nguys sound like you're in the mid game\num you know where it's like y'all are\nhigh level now you've got some decent\nitems you know you're like\nyou're level 45 or maybe like a 55\napproaching end game content and\nthat's where you guys are you know\nyou're not like hanging around in\nazeroth\nit's it's don't trash talk azeroth man i\ngot a lot of good memories here okay\ni'm only just thinking of gloomhaven now\nthat he's okay\nyeah if you're looking for a punishing\ntabletop game that's a good one\ndo you guys like board games yeah\ndoes charlie like board games yes yeah\nwe have a we have two shelves of kids\nfamily board games and two shelves of\nadult board games\nany recommendations for five-year-olds\noh gosh\num is red light green light red light\ngreen light's a great one\nso good it's so fun and ian what's the\nsquirrel one\nuh sneaky snacky squirrel is that one\num i'm trying to think uh charlie loves\nthe ticket to ride juniors\nwe liked monopoly junior uh was a good\none as well\num he loves any of the card games like\nold maid and\ncrazy eights uh man that kid is good at\ncrazy eights he\nbeats he wins routinely yeah i refuse to\nplay connect four with him because he\nbeats me all the time\nlast kind of random question how do\ny'all feel about arranged marriage\ncontracts\n[Laughter]\nhello i'm kidding\nit's coming up\nbecause i'm okay with introducing my son\nto somebody and letting them decide\nwe could have a conversation i'll get my\nlawyer involved\nfantastic\nno it sounds like he's a wonderful kid\nuh yeah i i think um\nyou know there's uh i started playing\ngif one game that my five and a half\nyear old really likes which is loot\nyou guys heard of this i don't think i\nhave no so\nso it's it's i i mean i think charlie\nwill be fine for it so i think it's\nactually for like eight-year-olds or\nten-year-olds or whatever but you know\nif you just playing connect four and\nstuff\num it's a cool game and and\nyou know i'll send you guys like a link\nor whatever but it's like you get you\nknow\ni think you all will like it um\nbut yeah i think thank you guys very\nmuch for coming on from my perspective i\ni you know i i feel like we're at a kind\nof decent stopping point\nuh but i want to give you all a chance\nto ask questions if you guys have\nquestions for me or or you know anything\nthat you feel like we should talk about\nmore\nsamantha kind of think\ni don't think i have any other questions\ni know i i think it's been\na long time since either of us had an\nopportunity to just talk to somebody\nabout our relationship and being\nespecially being a parent which is crazy\nto think that he's\nliterally almost six and i've never\nreally had a chance to sit down with\nsomebody\nand say hey here's my thoughts on what\nit's like being a parent so i\ni guess i appreciate the opportunity to\ntalk about it because it is\nit's kind of relieving especially like\ntalking about how smart he is and how\nfrustrating it can be\nand and what it's like being a parent to\na kid that's that age that wants to\nabsorb\nall the knowledge but also seems to just\nnot listen to you sometimes\nflat out told us that he hears us every\ntime he just\nchooses not to answer\nit's such a little [ __ ] sometimes when\nit comes to that but it's but like\nthat's just\ni think it's part of rolling with those\npunches and figuring out how to work\nwith that\nwithout ripping all your hair out you\nknow\num you know ben one kind of quick\nresponse to that as i feel like i\nactually haven't given you the\nopportunity to really have\nthat conversation in depth for which i\napologize because i think we've talked a\nlot more about y'all's relationship\nand if you know if there's some way that\ni can be helpful to you down the road\num one thing that just as a random aside\nlike one thing that i've come to\nappreciate is that\nmy kids have a different ayurvedic dosha\nwhich i don't know if you guys have ever\nheard about this but\nin traditional indian medicine they do a\nlot of like\ncognitive fingerprinting would be the\nbest way that i would put it\nso you know each person is different but\ndepending on their like cognitive nature\nso for example\nuh sam has a tendency to hold on to\nthings\nright like it's neither good nor bad i\nmean it's just she has the capacity to\nhold on\nso she holds on to things that will make\nher more resilient\nand she will hold on to negative\nfeelings the same way\num and and so there there are some\nthings that i've really found that are\nlike really have been helpful for\nraising my kids once i sort of\nunderstand what their cognitive\nfingerprint is\nlike the your child is intelligent and\ndefiant\nright he's gonna do things his way and\nand like so how do you like sort of\nrecognizing that\nthere are certain attributes so like\nlike in in ayurveda it sounds like he\nactually is a\nvata peter which means that his primary\nlike cognitive elements are wind and\nfire\nso he picks things up quickly he gets\nkind of focused on them\nso he's kind of like fire like he'll\nburn in a straight line if he needs to\nbut then he'll also kind of change\ndirection\ni'm not getting the sense that he does\nhold on to things\ni would also say that like i know this\nsounds weird because i've never seen\nyour kid before but i'd say that he has\nben's nose probably doesn't have the\nroundness\nof sam's face\num he's my cheeks he has these oh he\ndoes have okay so yeah\nhe has ben's fate i gave him my eyes and\ncheeks and that's it\nyeah so there are a lot of interesting\nthings so it turns out the genetics\nactually correlate between physical\ncharacteristics so if you look at people\nwho have a wind type mind\nthat that if you take a thousand people\nwith wind type minds\nand a thousand people with fire type\nminds and you look at their genetic\nalleles\nthat the thousand people with wind type\nminds actually have\nshare common genes and that uh\nfire type mines share common genes as\nwell because it sounds like\nuh charlie is a lot like my younger\ndaughter um\nin terms of just temperament and how\nquickly she picks up\nhow quickly he picks up things and stuff\nlike that and so i'm just\ni'm kind of thinking you know we didn't\nreally get a chance to talk about it too\nmuch and i'm not sure exactly what to do\nabout that at this point but\nmaybe you know if you guys have other\nquestions or whatever or\nyou'll ever want to come back on and\nactually talk about charlie and what\nit's\nlike you know because i kind of steered\nthings towards y'all as opposed to him\num just want to toss that out there i\ni think i would be down for something\nlike that yeah because it is one of\nthose\ni we we've gone along on this journey\nkind of just the two of\nus with the expertise we have in the\nback end especially\nsamantha way more than myself with the\nexperience with kids because of her\nprevious jobs and her experience with\nher brother\nuh knows a lot more about what working\nwith kids is like compared to\nmy experience is basically just boy and\nthat's it um\nbut it's it's definitely an experience\nthat i think\nhas been it's been 99\npositive and there's also that that\nportion that small bit that's like\nman i just want to rip my damn hair out\nsometimes because it's like\nit like she said uh he he openly admits\nthat he hears us and sometimes just\nignores and you know that gift for the\nguy talking to the brick wall\ni've i feel that sometimes that's like\nit's that feels like what it's like\nyeah so so when dealing with\nvata pit the children so like remember\nthat they're like water\nthe harder you come at them the more\nthey're gonna feel like concrete\nyep right whereas like if you're kind of\nsmooth and gen i'm sure you guys have\nfigured this out already but like if\nyou're kind of smooth and gentle like\nhe'll listen but he may not respond to\ncommands and then there's a whole thing\nabout boundary setting and\nyou know it sounds like you guys do a\npretty good job of that but anyway\nit's it sounds like he's a wonderful kid\nbut i do think that you know he's gonna\nbe challenging if he's not already\num but he's starting to show that\nhead-on yeah it's yeah\nanyway so thank you guys for coming on\nlet me just think a little bit about\nmaybe like how to follow up with y'all\nabout you know potentially\nyou know follow up whether it's on\nstream or whatever or maybe i can just\nrecommend a book if you guys are curious\nor something\nbecause i think especially about the fit\nthe children are like they're\nthey're challenging right because he's\nflighty like he doesn't always pay\nattention and sometimes when he does he\nchooses not to listen\nso part of it is attentional and then a\npart of it is defiance it's just he's\njust gonna do what he wants when he\nwants to\nand um and it's challenging because he's\nlike\nyou know when he when he points in the\nright direction it's amazing\nwhen you guys are all on the same page\nit's great\nright true\nso thank you all so much for coming on\nuh anything that we can do to help you\nbefore we kind of wrap up for today\ngood benjamin i think i'm good baby all\nright well\num do you guys want to learn to meditate\ni mean it sounds like sam has some\nexperience\nsometimes we'll teach people at the end\nof stream if they're interested in\nlearning\nit's up to you benjamin since i i\nafter this is done i'm going back to\napex for a couple more hours so i think\nmeditation\nand a fast-paced br don't necessarily\nline up yet\nbut i mean something like that\nespecially for me\nwe didn't get a whole lot into into my\nside of things we talked about a lot\nabout samantha which is totally fine uh\nher story is honestly way more elaborate\nuh\nand and interesting than mine my my life\nas a kid growing up was\nwas so vanilla it would make your head\nspin\num yes i think it's something that in\nthe future i'll be down to talk about\nsure of course um well good luck with\napex thank you\nand uh yeah thank you guys so much for\ncoming on\nyou know i really appreciate you all\nsharing this part of your life um\nyou know i i i've heard uh ben you know\ni know you\ni get the impression at least from what\ni hear on twitter and whatnot\nthat you do a pretty good job about\nsetting a boundary around your personal\nlife and your streamer life\nright like there's ben and there's dr\nlupo\nyeah yeah so i'm i i particularly\nappreciate that you're willing to kind\nof cross that boundary for\nour sake and to try to educate people um\nso far we really haven't had\na single case of knock on wood\nhaving bad fallout from coming on stream\nbut if something like that\ndoes happen you know please let us know\ncool um\nand good luck to you guys and and i hope\nyou school some noobs\nthanks dr k i appreciate it man sam\nenjoy your nap\nyes i will get a little one before i\nhead right back into work\nokay sounds terrible have a nice day\nappreciate it oh my god\nso much work chat\nwell we hope that you know he wrecks\nsome noobs"
