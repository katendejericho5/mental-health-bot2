    "transcript": "looking for gotta get my notebook\ngotta change over interview let's see\nthat there we go that works\nhow are you uh i'm doing good\ndoing good i usually don't wake up this\nearly\nbut uh i am wide awake now\nwhat what time is it where you are it\nis 10 a.m here normally i wake up around\n12\nbut uh yeah ah it's always there's\nalways like a good reason to wake up\nearly it's always nice to have a reason\nto wake up\nyeah well i thank you very much for you\nknow inconveniencing yourself for our\nsake\nhmm\ni've been uh meaning to come on here for\na while uh i know\ni i guess you've talked to every single\nother offline tv member huh\ni actually don't know if i have or\nhaven't\nuh pokey lily scarra\nmichael and yvonne\nso yeah they've all been on so i'm here\nto\nhelp you finish your infinity gauntlet\noh wow okay well i mean do you feel\npressured to come on because other\npeople from otp have come on\nuh no no um i mean people have tried\npressuring me\nto go on but i just say no\nokay uh so the reason why i came on\nuh well people have been asking um\nfor a while now because i talk about\nlike a lot of my\nthought process and people are always\nlike oh you should go on drk\nbut the response i've always given them\nis like\ni don't feel like it's necessary\nand um because it's\ncontent i also had to reconcile like\nthe fact that it's content but it's also\nmeant to be like beneficial or like\neye-opening experience for people to\nlisten in um\nso i think your wife reached out to me\nsaying hey you guys have free private\nsessions\num because i think people from your side\nlike not your wife but like people on\nyour team have\nsent me like 10 emails like i could show\nyou the\nuh twitter dm's not sure if yourself\nit's just like 10 requests for me to\ncome on the show oh wow which i've\nignored\nuh but uh i vote\ni'm just not big on replying but i think\nyour wife reached out saying hey\nwe have some free private sessions just\nfor your own benefit\num which is also what made me\nagree to go on when the private session\nwas offered i'm like oh they're nice\nenough to offer private session where\nthere's no content to be made so that's\npretty chill of them\nso yeah i will go on the public session\none okay\ninteresting um that's how i got here\nwell i'm i'm sorry that you know i\ndidn't uh\non behalf of my team for which i take\nresponsibility if they were pestering\nyou i'm i'm really sorry about that\nno no no not at all not at all um thanks\nfor the feedback because i'll you know\nwe'll circle back because we\nwe haven't really heard that from anyone\nelse we we try to actually be\nquite respectful of people not wanting\nto come on\num i also am\nyou know it's kind of interesting about\n70 of\nthe people that i've worked with like i\ndo for free\nhistorically um and\ni i'm i'm wondering whether yeah i'm\nkind of surprised to hear you\nsay all that stuff but i'm kind of you\nknow if if if i was which is news to me\num offering to meet with you privately\nfor free why\nhow would that motivate you to come on\npublicly if you didn't want to earlier\nlike that's weird um\nbecause\nit's a nice thing to do to offer like\nprivate therapy sessions uh\nbecause there's no gain essentially to\nbe had right\nat least not an immediate obvious gain\num so\nand i felt like\nyou know your wife was offering me uh uh\na favor and she didn't have to so\ni like that um when people are nice yeah\nand i like being nice back\nwhat should i call you because i know\nyou as disguised toast i mean i've been\nwatching\nlike i started watching your hearthstone\nstreams many many years ago\nprobably like back when like i i also\nremember i was watching you for a while\nbecause i think you made it a lot of\nlike meme friendly content\nright and if i remember the origin of\nyour name it's it's what the guy\nsays when you coin out defies bandit on\nturn one\nyeah wow you're an oh gee i am an\nog like back when chillwind yeti was\nactually a solid card\nyou know and then and so watched prior\nto\num i i still remember actually like one\nof the most memorable things was when\nsomeone leaked your face\nand i really loved your response video\nto that\nyeah um that was uh wow that was a long\ntime ago\nyeah man and and i i still remember if i\nremember the sentiment correctly you\nwere like this is for fun it's not like\ni'm actually trying to hide\nand like people are sort of taking it\ntoo far and like it's fine like i don't\nmind showing my face but\nyou know the whole point was to like\nentertain people and it was\nyeah i mean yeah like it's it's cooler\nto have like\na gimmick like especially when you're\nstarting out as a streamer\nand like sorry now it's it's always\nawkward when you become a\ncontent creator on the internet because\nmy biggest fear\nwas just like my friends finding out and\nmaking fun of me because it's it's kind\nof it's kind of like uh like being an\ninternet stream is one of those\nbig dreams kids have nowadays you know\nthey used to want to be a singer or an\nactor but now it's like oh\ni want to be a video game streamer so\nuh yeah can i just jump in what should i\ncall you today\num you can call me toast\nokay most people call me toast like\njeremy's more\nintimate but i don't know anyone\nlike in my like friend group who calls\nme jeremy\ndo you want people to call you jeremy no\nno no okay\na weird meal at this point just because\ni'm just so used to hearing toast\nyeah um and and so i want to just\nalso take a step back for a second uh\ntoast and just\nsort of let's think this through so you\nknow if we\noffered if you you know we tried to do\nyou\na kindness and in return\nyou want to do a kindness to us i can\ntotally respect it it's a hundred\npercent how i operate in my personal\nlife\nand i also want to be a little bit\ncareful because\num you don't have to do us a kindness i\nknow it's kind of weird because we're\nalready streaming at this point\nright but i i i think that like you know\ni i don't want you to feel\num i mean i i sort of am getting the\nfeeling\nor i'm interpreting that you're feeling\nkind of like\nalmost a sense of like repayment like\nyou're\nyou're you're doing you know you're like\npaying a debt by coming on stream\num which i think is going to be\ninteresting because i'm like really\ncurious whether that's a pattern that\nexists elsewhere in your life\num right and then uh\nbut but i also want to be clear that\nlike i'm actually okay i know it's gonna\nbe weird and i know it's gonna be\nanticlimactic but like\nthe only way that i can do this because\nyou're right that it's weird because\nit's like content and helping people\nthat's sort of like a conflict of\ninterest if you think about it right\nlike what am i really here for\nand so the only way that i can resolve\nthat conflict of interest is i actually\nam not here to help the internet i'm\nhere to help the person that i talk to\nit's the only way that i can do this\nbecause otherwise it gets too confusing\num and by having that\nis my north star it actually makes all\nthe decision making easy\nand i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike what that also means is like\nif you're here because you feel like you\nhave to be here because we tried to do\nyou a solid\nwe could just stop and i'm totally fine\nwith that\ni'm serious i don't know just imagine\nthe stream ending\ninstantly five minutes in um\nbut toast let's really think about that\nfor a second okay\nbecause like like i want you to think\nabout like what what lesson does that\nteach people\nwho are watching\nwell i think the world is definitely\nbetter off if every nice\nact was reciprocated with a nice act of\nits own\nuh but without obligation to do so\ni think there is an expectation but not\nan obligation if that makes sense like\ni you know do my friends a lot\nsolid and sometimes rarely i would ask\nfor one back\nbut when i do ask for one back it's not\nan obligation right because i didn't i\nwasn't nice to you with the expectation\nthat you're nice to me back but if i\nlend you twenty dollars on tuesday and\nnext friday\ni ask for ten dollars like hey can i get\na loan ten dollars and you\npay for something and you say no\ni would never like demand hey that's not\nfair\ni gave you 20 bucks last week but more\nlike in the back of my head i'm gonna\nmentally note you know i did a solid\nbut they weren't able to\nlike do one back and i think that's just\nhuman nature right i think\nabsolutely the majority of people yeah\nso i know it sounds kind of weird toast\nbut i think sometimes\nfeelings of obligation get people to\nmake sacrifices\nand i know it's weird but sometimes\nthose sacrifices i don't think are\nactually healthy\nright so like like we actually had a one\nof our coaches\nbrought up an interesting case so\nthere's a client who's in a relationship\nand you know i'm gonna kind of anonymize\nit but like\nand they're they they're in a\nrelationship where\ntheir partner sometimes has trouble\nand they feel obligated to help their\npartner\neven at significant cost to themself\nand it's actually like not a healthy\nsituation because their partner is not\nactually like taking care of themselves\nso they are forced to take care of their\npartner out of obligation\nand every time they make that sacrifice\nit's like they're\nholding their partner up well like\nsacrificing their own life\nand and so you know i think acting out\nof obligation\nlike i think it's an honorable way to\nlive you seem like an honorable dude\num i read your tweet longer or your twit\nand so i i think it's really cool to see\nlike how you have an internal compass\nthat drives you forward\num and uh\nbut you know i think it's important to\nkind of like at least notice this\npattern\nat this point i don't think you're going\nto leave but\nbut i i think it would be interesting\nright because maybe you would be\nsignaling to people that like hey like\njust because you feel obligated to do\nsomething if it's not something what\nyou don't want to do like you don't have\nto do it yeah\nuh definitely like um the whole reason\nwhy\ni am on here is because like i don't\nfeel obligated to but um\nit's just nice i guess to be able to do\nit\num like when people badger me for\nsomething it makes me not want to do it\nmore\nand people have been asking me to go on\ni mean that's the whole reason why i\nhaven't\ncome on sooner is because i just didn't\nfeel like it uh\npeople ask i don't really feel obligated\nbut\nokay it's like until i feel like hey you\nknow\nthere's a good reason to and i'm not\nsure if there's a good reason to right\nnow but\ni was about to ask what's the good\nreason\nuh i think i mean a week ago those whole\nthat whole um\nonline drama stuff going on and coming\nback to california\nbut other than that i've always felt\nmy life was good enough\nlike and did not have a reason to come\non\nbut i always do like talking about\nstreamer meta like what's it like being\na streamer\nthe stuff we think about like the money\nwe make\na lot of like i like doing like an\ninside look\nat a streamer's mindset\nand i think uh the healthy gamer show\nyou know does something a very similar\nway it's like an\ninside look at them you know the\nmental health of streamers in general so\ni don't know we can talk about anything\nreally i like talking about spicy stuff\nlike\ndrama stuff it's you you said you do\nlike or you don't like\ni do like um which is sometimes hard\nbecause you know\nwe never want to leak names or like\nimplicate people but i do like talking\nabout like\nsensitive topic like money or like\nas sure you may learn like racism sexism\nlike sometimes social issues but i\nactually don't like talking about those\ntoo much because i don't really have an\nopinion\nlike gun laws and abortion sometimes\nbring it up just to like\nmeme and make people uncomfortable but\num\nthe other topics is just more\ninteresting yeah so toast you've always\nstruck me as a thinker\nyou know like i know you meme and i know\nyou make\nfun content and i know you're an\nentertainer\nbut i do get the sense that like behind\nthat is like actually a lot of thought\nand i think your you know your face\nreveal conversation\nwas a good example of that i still\nremember uh\nwatching a youtube video where you went\nover like how much streamers make and\nyou kind of talked about sponsorships\nand things like that\num and and so you know i i think if you\nenjoy\ntalking about things that are a little\nbit at the edge of what's polite\ni think that that's actually like really\nfantastic i think a lot of what you're\nsharing is like per align with like my\npersonal goals and\ngoals as an organization because i think\na lot of times\nwe don't talk about the bad stuff\nright we don't always we're not we don't\nalways acknowledge like\nsome of these issues and that that's\npart of the reason that they continue to\ngo on because they're never brought to\nlight\nso i'd love to hear you know whatever\njuiciness you want to talk about\ni mean if you have any ideas about where\nwe could get started\num and then there are\none or two other thoughts that i have\nunless you have a direction you'd like\nto go\nuh let's circle back to the conversation\nof like um\nhelping friends and expectation\nobligations\nyeah uh it's uh\ni have a lot of expectation\nfrom my friends and people my social\ncircle\nwhat is that you have a lot of\nexpectation from\nor towards from them like they expect a\nlot from you\nand then i so i\ntry to provide my friends with\na lot of content and like help their\ncareer\nand like just whatever support they need\num putting them in situations where\nlike the talent can grow\nand\nuh i have this\ni think one of my worries is like it's\nlike um\nraising baby birds in a nest\nand once they're ready to leave the nest\nand letting them go\nand hoping that they come back one day\nand like visit and not forget you or\nanother analogy well streaming is like\nrunning a marathon\nand i don't mind slowing down\nto help my friends who are lagging\nbehind or like tripping\nbut it always worries me that\nonce they get up and running like they\njust full sprinted down\nthat like not look back not try and slow\ndown for anyone\num not sure if\ni'm making sense but uh can i can i\nrepeat back what i heard sure\nso what i'm kind of hearing is that you\nmay slow down to help people\nup but then you're worried whether it's\naccurate or\nnot that they may leave you behind that\nmaybe one day you'll stumble\nand they're not going to look back yeah\nyeah i'd say so\nhowever like they won't they won't even\nlike slow down for\ntheir friends not necessarily me because\ni'm generally okay\nby myself um like my career has always\nbeen\nlike at the forefront but like\nlike if they had friends like they won't\neven slow down for them\nso it's just that the scene is\nconstantly about\nthe chase right like the numbers the\ngetting ahead being top dog it's just\nthe grind non-stop so\nwhenever i do see like kindness like\nit speaks a lot to me\nyou try hard to be a kind person\nyeah yeah try my best\nwhat do you give up by doing that\nnothing\nreally like i feel like people are\nalways saying like they have sacrifices\nto make but\nuh i feel like i never gave anything up\nbecause\ntheir talent was already there like\nand their humor so\nlike i also just gained benefit just by\nbeing around them like being in the good\ncontent\nthat's happening so i don't feel like i\never\ngive anything up i feel like i'm more\njust\nunlocking their potential that they've\nalways had\nso it's not like oh i could have had a\nbigger stream or i could have had a\nbigger\npresence if i didn't help them it's\nnever like that i\nalways i only benefit from\npeople's success so\nit's just that small worry that uh\npeople are always seeking that next\nlevel like all right what's gonna get me\nmore pure who's\nbigger than me that can collab with now\nthat i'm bigger\nso let me see if i'm kind of getting you\nso on the one hand\nyou know it's kind of interesting\nbecause you're sort of saying that like\nokay there's the scene right and the\nscene is the grind and growing and like\nalways like okay\ncan i collab with toast oh wow like\ntoast is collabing with me\nand then like part of the nature of the\nbeast is like they're gonna grow\nand then like they're gonna collab with\nsomeone else\nright because at some point we're gonna\nreach\ntoast we're gonna pass toast\nand there's toast back there but like\nlet's keep going up\nand and your experience is that you\ndon't it's not like you sacrifice a\nwhole lot in supporting people that\nsounds like you genuinely really do\nenjoy helping people reach their full\npotential\num that you also notice that there is\nkind of like a benefit right because if\nyou find someone who is talented and you\nunlock their potential\nlike you guys can create content\ntogether that content is ultimately like\nimproved the more people you know if you\nget multiple people\ninvolved you can make more than what you\ncould make on your own\nso i'm not hearing you making any kind\nof like noble sacrifice like oh my god\ni helped you so much yeah and i gave you\nmy kidney\nyeah like the reason why i don't feel\nlike too bad about it because at the end\nof the day it's like\nthey are just talented by themselves\nthey're just not\nin the right situation sure like\nsure in the right game or have the right\ncollab\npartners so sure you sound like you're\nvery good at\nkind of um enabling people\nyes yeah yeah i would say\nthat's like one of my best talents is\nnot it's just recognizing good content\nbecause i feel like\ni myself is i'm pretty limited by\nlike what is possible because at the end\nof the day like\ni am like sarcastic my i have a\nsarcastic persona\num and\nmy games that i'm good at are very like\nthinking logical\nlike nerdy games and i always felt like\ni have like a ceiling that is more\nobvious than um\nother people might have so i like seeing\nlike\nhow far other people can go sure\nso where do you think that fear comes\nfrom the fear of sort of being left\nbehind\n[Music]\noh that k i don't know if you know this\nabout me but\nwhen i talk about feelings i start\ntearing up\nit's not because i don't know why it's\nnot it's never because i'm sad because\ni'm just talking about stuff\num but when i talk about things that are\na little more emotional in nature\nlike my tear duct just start like you\nknow start trying to\ni think it's because like i don't talk\nabout emotions much\nso my brain is thinking oh if he's\ntalking about emotion he must be\nsad and he wants to cry so let's make\nhim cry\nit's funny because it's so stupid and\nyou get my point across but i can't\nbecause when i tried\nso people have disappointed me\nsince i came to california when you're a\nsolo streamer it's like i'm going to the\ntop [ __ ] all of you\nkind of deal like i i had drama with\nlike\nquite a few hearthstone streamers when i\nwas coming up\njust like looking back is just stupid\nbut\nit's like an ego [ __ ] talk battle of\nwho's the best streamer kind of deal\nlike\nstuff like that um but when you have\nfriends and you collab with people\nand it gets really complicated and\nmy policy is i generally will just\nsupport someone\nespecially my friends do and like\nhost them and like appear on their\nstreams and just like\ngenuinely want them to do well and to be\nable to make a living off it\na lot of situations\nhave turned out fine but there are quite\na few situations that\nyou know if you have followed otv's\nhistory\num has gone really bad\nand we don't really interact with those\npeople anymore\nand it's like it's happened quite a few\ntimes\nand it's people like\ni trusted so\nyeah so\nhow you holding up man i'm good i'm good\ni just\ni i know like these things i can talk\nabout\nand like they're normal to talk about i\njust need practice talking about it\num but you know it happened a few times\nactually so it wasn't even like a\none-off thing okay\nand that is like smaller versions of\nthat that gets settled\ninternally too as well okay\num can i ask so when i when i asked you\na question you got emotional do you know\nwhat emotion you were feeling\nah\nnot sadness i think uh\nit's just oh this is like\nsensitive stuff yeah um\nyeah i i got that impression too that\nthere's some\nwhat i what i saw in you is like\nremembering a hurt\nyeah i don't know i don't feel that hurt\nby it\nhonestly i i don't know if that's where\nthe fear comes from it's just like\nan easy example to point to\nand say you know the\nthere are people that i did believe in\nthat end up\ndoing not so great things\nso is that like feeling betrayed\ndisappointed uh\ni think disappointed mostly because they\ndon't usually\nend up hurting me or they just end up\ndoing some something stupid that hurt\nother people\nwhat happens is hurt you\noh that one is more just anger and like\nvindictive i'm a very petty person\nand i remember the wrongs that had done\nto me\nuh there's not a lot of them\nbut i am the type to you kind of hold on\nto grudges\num but i usually react with\nanger or revenge\nuh if i'm personally like upseted by\nsomeone's action\nwill you let me know if i get close to\nmaking an enemy of you\nof course uh usually it's like really\nlet me know yeah so let me know where\nthat line is okay\ni i do not want to wind up across\nthe other side of that border i wouldn't\nsay this really\ni don't have any enemies right now\nat most i just have people i don't like\ninteract with\nso when someone says to me that i'm a\nvindictive person who has no enemies\nthere's a part of me that wonders yeah\nyou have no enemies left\nbecause they're all six feet under at\nthis point\ni i like i like um\nbeating people like when i was streaming\ntft when it first came out like i made\nit a point to\nstream over the time slot\nof my competition so i think the first\nmonth i was doing 12 hour streams\nand they were like time so that i start\nright before the first like\nbig tft streamer gets on and i end\nright after the last big tft streamer\nfinishes for the day um\nso like i really and my attitude that\ntime was just like i'm gonna\ni'm gonna bury this guy and i don't\ni don't really like have a problem with\nthem it's just the competition of being\na streamer\nbut like when i had to do back then was\nlike like you gotta stay in second place\nand i'm gonna be first place and had the\nviewers\num but now that you know i'm on facebook\nand\ni'm in my killing years\num it's a lot less antagonistic and more\njust\nhey you know you you your friends you\nguys want to play some games let's you\nknow\nyou want yeah i can pop by your stream\nand i think that's\none nice thing about being on facebook\nis uh\ni can just provide content to my friends\nwithout thinking\noh you know well what about my stream\nyou know why are we having this stream\non my stream\nso um yeah i'm\ni'm at a pretty nice place right now in\nterms of\nproviding content but that's kind of\nwhat my attitude used to be\nwhen it comes to like competition\nso toast i'm gonna\ncan i just think for a second yeah\nso there are a lot of different things\nthat are kind of popping in my mind i'm\nnot quite sure what has\nsignificance so one is um\nyou know you mentioned that things were\na little bit uh\nyou know\nunharmonious or not harmonious during\nthe early stages of hearthstone or maybe\nwhen you were a hearthstone streamer\nthere was some kind of\nconflict i think we talked a lot about\nsort of this um\nyou know you describe it as a small fear\nbecause you strike me as a pretty\nresilient guy where like if you do have\nissues or call them whatever you want to\nyou seem to be like pretty good at like\nsetting those aside kind of being able\nto do your work\nfinding compassion sort of like not\nfeeling super burnt out\nyou seem to really be about you know\nsupporting other people\nand that feels very genuine to me like i\ndon't think you're\nyou know trying to grow someone just so\nyou can farm people to collaborate with\nit's sort of like you\nrecognize that this person is talented\nand you recognize that by making content\nwith them\nit sort of helps you grow helps them\ngrow all seems super genuine to me\num and there are a couple of things that\ni'm not quite sure how to connect\num but one is sort of this idea that\nlike it's almost like\nyou know i'm gonna toss out a strong\nword here which is like abandonment\nbut when i kind of think about the birds\nin the nest it's like they're gonna\nleave and they're never gonna come back\nand that sounds a touch like like one\nword\nyou know if we want to use a big word\nlike\nmaybe a little bit hyperbole maybe a\nlittle bit extreme is like abandonment\num it sounds like sometimes people have\nsort of like wronged you in the past and\nand then there this is where i get kind\nof confused about whether this is\nrelated or not\num is there is this kind of idea of like\nyou kind of mentioned that you have a a\nceiling right\nin the games that you play and that\nyou're kind of aware\nof what your ceiling is and that's why\nyou gravitate towards games like\nhearthstone or tft because you're never\ngoing to have the reflexes of the\nfortnite pros or this or that right like\nyou can\nand even if we think about you know your\nyour hearthstone content like\num hopefully this doesn't let me know if\nthis evokes any kind of hurt but like\nyou're not known for being the best at\nhearthstone like the reason that your\ncontent was\ngreat was because it was very\nentertaining\nand so i'm wondering whether there's a\ncorrelation between sort of this idea\nthat i have a ceiling\nthe fact that other people will sort of\nlike leave you behind at some point\nbecause there's only so fast that you\ncan run\num because if you kind of and then also\nlike on the flip side whether that like\nkind of manifests is like\ni'm abu number one [ __ ]\nyou know like striving to be number one\nand i don't know if any of those things\nare actually related i mean they can all\nbe independent\nit's just those are the three things\nthat i'm kind of feeling are like\nfloating to the surface\n[Music]\nand and when it comes to being\nvindictive being hurt\num you know there's a part of me that\nalmost wants to ask the question like\nand i think the answer oddly enough is\nyes but for a little while i thought it\nwas no like would you know what feeling\nhurt felt like\ni yeah yeah i think so\ni think um i\ndon't like it when people violate\nmy trust like i tell you hey\nx secret and i say don't tell anyone\nand they end up telling someone like i\nthink that's the\nbiggest way to like\nget on my bad side because\nyeah so i think like i feel like there\nare stronger words popping up here\nbecause that sounds like betrayal to me\nyeah and i'm very harsh with my friends\nwhen they\ndo that yeah so so when it comes to and\nthen now we circle back to like\nexpectations\nso i'm kind of thinking about okay toast\ni know you're here i know\neveryone including us wanted you here\nand so like i know that everyone's being\nsatisfied but like my question is still\nlike how can we help you as a person\nyou know like is there something that\nnot that you need help because this also\nlike you kind of said earlier that life\nis good enough\nwhereas like i don't think you the\npeople in fact i think we've created\nthis bias where like people come on here\nbecause they've got some problem or some\nissue or some difficulty\nwhereas like it's really my belief that\nlike you know you can always climb like\nit doesn't you don't and everyone should\nbe trying to climb right like you can\nalways grow as a person\num what i'm kind of curious about is\nwhether\nand i think if you want to if you feel\nlike any of this is\nrelevant or important to you um\ni can lay out an argument of why i think\nit may be worth exploring\nbut i'm just curious like what resonates\nwith you\nnothing really pops\nout like like i don't think i have any\nproblems\nlike emotionally i don't think so\nso yeah\ncan i go ahead yup can i ask you um\nhow how are your romantic relationships\nuh romantic relationships\ni\ni don't know um you're allowed to not\nanswer by the way if it's not something\nyou want to talk about\ni've it's uh\nand if you want me to explain why i'm\nasking i'm happy to\nuh i won't go into too much detail\nthat's one of the problems with being\nlike a public figure\ntalking about because i've had a public\nrelationship\nand that one the amount of\nbackseaters and people commentating\non it is just really annoying\nso since then i've\nkept my romantic life relatively\nprivate like i talked about bits here\nand there\nuh i kind of like not like\nbeing in a committed relationship right\nnow because i think it's a lot of work\nand can i toss something out\ntoast why ask so here's sometimes when i\nwork with people like you and i'm making\na lot of assumptions so i think like\nmaybe\nwhat we need to do is just you know i'll\nask you some basic questions like about\nyour life and stuff but\nhere's here's i'm gonna i'm gonna take a\nshot in the dark okay\nit's gonna be like one of these like um\nhigh risk high reward i'm making some\nhearthstone deck where i have no cards\nbetween that are one to five\nmana they're all like they're all\nlegendaries that start at six\nokay uh so so\nthe one in a hundred games where this\nworks out and i survived it turned sex\nsix it's it's gg wow freudian\num but so here's here's what i'm\nconcerned about is that i think you have\nlike i don't know how to put this but\nyou have a meta in your mind\nyou have like a set of rules right like\nyou operate you have a strong internal\ncode\nyou have there's like a whole system\nthat isn't really in the game\nit's like like it's in your mind like\nyou have a strong set of internal rules\nthrough which you operate by\nand that like like other people may not\nunderstand those rules right\nit dictates how you stream it dictates\nhow you relate to other people it\ndictates like it's kind of like this\nhonor system that you've got going on in\nhere\nthat sometimes it's kind of\ndisappointing because people outside of\nyou don't adhere to that honor system\nthe reason i ask about romantic\nrelationships is sometimes when you have\nhonorable vindictive people okay and\nthat\nsorry if that's you know a bad way of\nputting it\num but like you describe yourself as\npenny and vindictive\nbut you're clearly like a good dude\nright like\nand and so like when you have that kind\nof pattern\nin your mind sometimes it creates a lot\nof confusion\nand trouble especially in romantic\nrelationships\nbecause the person on the other side of\nthe table\nyou're like playing with this meta that\nisn't apparent\non the game board because the meta is\nnot like you know\nthe game board is the game board but\nit's like it's weird like i\nlike and you're coining out defias\nbandits and it's like i thought we were\ndoing\nno rush 20. you know like and and so\nsometimes it can be confusing for other\npeople so i was just kind of wondering\nyou know that's why i ask about romantic\nrelationships because i wonder if\num you know to put it really like\nspecifically shot in the dark because we\nhaven't\nasked you anything about them but you\nknow whether people\nwhether you feel like really let down by\nexpect\nby someone not living up to expectations\nand specifically whether that person\ndidn't realize at all that that\nexpectation was being placed upon them\n[Music]\ndoes that make sense\nyeah that makes a lot of sense i think\nit's just from my point of view these\nexpectations are\nvery obvious like very human\ncourtesy expectations\nbut i can also see like it doesn't apply\nto everyone\nit's just you know because i do have\nlike\na strong sense of like what's right and\nwhat's wrong\nthat to me it seems very straightforward\nvery clear-cut yeah you're supposed to\nbehave like this you're supposed to act\nlike that\num one thing i've learned from uh\ntalking to\nthe ladies is that they're\ni tend to be on a very logical\nscale and they are\ngenerally more emotional than i am um\nbecause being right used to be like the\nmost important\nthing for me uh not like that i had to\nbe right but like in an argument\nif you're in an argument with someone\none of you should be right\nyou know there are some stuff like oh\nshould abortions be legal\nlike that's an argument where it's just\ntwo guys arguing\nlike there's no a defined correct answer\nbut a lot of arguments like someone\nbeing rude\ni feel like there's a clear-cut right\nperson wrong person\nand uh i had that attitude when it came\nto relationship\nit's like hey you know we were trying to\nsolve a problem and you snapped at me\nand\nnow we're fighting so you kind of\nlike broke a rule right\num so i feel\nmore justified and entrenched\nbecause you violated\nyou know what could have been a proper\nway to communicate\nnow it's like name calling or like\nbeing petty um\nyeah so i'm i'm hearing a lot of what i\nwas\nthinking may be going on which is that\nbut because i i think you say like you\nknow because in your mind they violated\na rule\nbut i know i'm sure that you know you're\nlogical and ha\nin in here but the point is i think like\ni know it's kind of bizarre but like\nsometimes like you've got a meta up here\nthough\nabout how the game should be played\nand and sometimes i see conflict because\nthe metas in the minds of the people\nthat you relate to\nmay not be the same as your meta does\nthat make sense\nyeah yeah um makes sense people have\ntold me that\nmy way of thinking is not always correct\nand that i should\nbe nicer or like be more accepting of\npeople's flaws but i think that's a big\ni think we have enough of that in our\nfriend group\nwhere we just accept people's\nshortcomings and their flaws and they're\njust like yeah well that's just who they\nare\num so i tend to be more strict\non stuff like that where\nyou know if someone does something bad i\nwant to have a sit down with them like\ni want to sit them down like in my room\nand\nexplain to them like why what they did\nwasn't okay\na little confrontational and\ni like a tiny\nlike i like having friends and being\nclose to people\nand like having people to rely on\nbut i'm also afraid that um\npeople get too familiar with you like\nlike people always say your best friends\nare the one that gives you a lot of [ __ ]\nkind of deal um\nlike respect is really important to me\nand\ni would love for my friends to like\nlike me and love me but it doesn't hurt\nsometimes when there's a little bit of\nfear as well\nwhich now that i've said it out a lot of\npeople are going to be like\nmore aware of it but um can you help us\nunderstand that\nah i i don't quite understand i i lost\nyou there\nuh\nhave you have you have you seen game of\nthrones\nyeah yeah\nyou know people love daenerys targaryen\nbut some people are also afraid of her\nbut in both cases it makes them treat\nthat person with respect\nyeah it makes a lot of sense so have you\nbeen\ni feel like a story would you know tell\na thousand words here but like\ni'll just kind of ask have you been like\ntaken advantage of because of your\nkindness\nmmm no\nno no no no i don't\nthink people\nlike i don't think i think i'm smart\nenough\nto know when someone's trying to take\nadvantage of me\num\nyeah i don't think i've been taken\nadvantage of i think it's more just like\nhey you know you seem cool you know i'll\nwork i'll play with you i'll you know\ntalk\nabout you you know on stream and like\ntry and boost your numbers just you know\nbe the best person you can and then they\ngo and do\nsome shady [ __ ] and\nit really sucks when that happens what\nsucks\nit's like cause i don't know it just\nlooks\nwhen people you believe and disappoint\nyou you know\nnot it's they never do anything to me\nthey just\ndo something objectively\nshitty and um\nor they just like\nleave the nest and don't interact with\nlike\nthe people they used to interact with\nanymore\nhow does that feel when they do that\nit's like up just another one for the\nhistory books\nlike it happens so often in my mind\nthat when it doesn't happen like it's\nreally surprising to me\nlike i have the expectations like\nyou're just gonna one day not\nlike gonna be around anymore\nbut maybe you'll surprise me how long\nago did you learn that lesson\nthat people just don't stick around\n[Music]\ni guess a year ago\nwhen i was uh in elementary school i\nremember\nsharing a popcorn chicken with\nthis kid in class and\nuh he just kind of like\nacted as if ha i just got a free popcorn\nchicken\noff you when i want to share it with him\nand when he had gum later\nlike and i had hey can i have a piece of\ngum he's like huh no\nkind of deal and now that\nmemory sticks out as like an example of\nlike when you help people\nthe expectation is like don't expect\nthem to like\nreturn to favor like i'm surprised when\npeople\nreciprocate kindness these days\ni feel like that should be the norm like\nshould we help someone\nbut like these days when someone does\nlike show appreciation for me\nit catches me off guard\nyeah i think especially in the world\nthat you live in there's sort of\nfriendship\nand then some of y'all are in the\nbusiness of friendship\nyou know where being friends is actually\nnot\nit's like a business decision\nand and i imagine that makes things\nquite tough\nbut can i ask you can i ask you a little\nbit more about like when you were\nyounger like prior to\nbecause i it was kind of confusing\nbecause you said i was like when did you\nlearn that lesson and you were like\nabout a year ago\nand then you told me a story from\nkindergarten with popcorn chicken\ngum so you know i'm i'm kind of noticing\nthat\nmaybe you've been on the maybe you've\nbeen burned i mean it sounds like you\ngot burned by it pretty early\nsort of like doing good unto others and\nothers taking advantage of you\nand not doing what was right justin\nuh small i think i i just\nplace a lot of emphasis off being\nconsiderate\nsure um can you tell me a little bit\nabout where you grew up\nuh okay i grew up uh\nin malaysia so i was born in taiwan but\nlike when i was\nless than one years old uh my family\nmoved to malaysia\nand i grew up there for about 10 years\nand i kept switching between an english\nand a chinese school\nso my chinese wasn't great and my\nenglish wasn't\namazing and when i moved to canada\ni had like the malaysian version of\nenglish\nwhich is you know heavily accented\nand like uh the word three like i had\nsuch a huge problem pronouncing it three\nbecause i i would say tree\nand it took like a long time\nuh i had an immense fear of public\nspeaking like the worst ever\nlike i would just go up and just read\nfrom a piece of paper and i know you're\nnot supposed to do that\nbecause you're supposed to make eye\ncontact but i remember one presentation\ni'm like [ __ ] i am not taking my eye\noff\nthe piece of paper and looking at\npeople's reaction to my presentation\num\nyou know at that whole like asian\nidentity growing up\nthing of like bringing\nhome-cooked meals but people the kids at\nschool having like a negative reaction\nto the home-cooked meal\nand my mom end up making like but lonely\nketchup sandwiches instead\nbecause you know she doesn't want me to\nfeel like i'm standing out\nuh i learned how to do oh\nfor the first year of high school grade\nnine i didn't speak to anyone\nlike i went the entire year\nwithout uh talking to anyone besides the\nyes and no\nthat my teachers would ask me uh\ni think in grade 11 i made an effort to\nbe social so i learned how to do magic\ntricks\nso that i could interact with people\nand like entertain people because i like\nbeing an entertainer\num i was gonna be a game designer\ninitially\nbecause for me that's how i could become\nan entertainer like\ni couldn't be like a streamer or because\nit wasn't really a thing back then or an\nactor or singer\nbut i could design games that people\nwould enjoy since i played a lot of\ngames\nbut i picked up like magic tricks as a\nway to\nentertain people and\nthat slowly improved my ability to\nperform in a public setting\num so yeah that kind of\nset me down on the path of being a\nentertainer\nfascinating man i'm so happy you shared\nthat\ni i don't know why but i i really just\nreally enjoyed hearing about your what\ngrowing up was like for you even though\nit sounds\npretty rough bro\nno no i didn't feel rough i feel\ni felt like like looking back it\nmight seem a little sad but when it was\nin the moment it didn't\nfeel like it was that hard\ni just it just felt like that this is\nwhat life is you know\nyeah um yeah\nand you mentioned your you know your mom\nwas quite thoughtful about you know\nfeeding you trash to help you fit in\nyou know setting aside some of her own\nvalues\num uh yeah she was just worried that the\nkids would make comments\nyeah and and how did she how did she get\nworried about that was that because of\nsomething you said do you remember\ni thought maybe my sister said something\nbut um sisters older or younger\nuh old i have an older sister and an\nolder brother\nhow much older uh my brother's seven\nyears\nolder and my sister is two years older\nyeah their sister's getting married\nand uh my brother just had a child so\nthey're growing up and i'm still\nplaying video games on the internet\ni would assume that that was a joke\nhuh that you actually have no problem\nplaying games on the internet\noh yeah yeah yeah but it's crazy how\nlike\noh they're getting like how\nhow like we people from my high school\nare\nliterally married and have children by\nnow but\nlike this industry we're in it's like\npeople are just\nplaying games playing games playing\ngames\ni think it's cool uh i think i'm not\nready to vote just\nyet and uh\nit's just crazy that some people are the\nsame age but\nso many different phases of their lives\nlike\nlike their kids are some kids are like\nfive years old by now\nyeah yeah do the people and\ndo you stay in touch with anyone in high\nschool from high school\noh i stay in touch with nobody\nnot a single person um i do have two\nfriends that i should stay in touch with\nbecause they were my best friends in\nhigh school\nbut it's just been so long\ni feel awkward uh\nre-engaging so i'm just essentially\nwaiting\nuntil i get married and one of them get\nmarried to reach out again\nit's like hey wanna come to my wedding\nit sounds like you need an excuse to\nre-engage with them\nyeah yeah and can you tell me a little\nbit about\nuh your dad oh\nmy dad he worked most of his life um\nin another country so doesn't\nreally grow up with one uh he works\nreally hard he's more of a traditional\nkind of guy you know older\nlike more family values we must always\nbe together for chinese new year's\nnot that strict in terms of uh you know\njust do what you want to do\nbut he nags a lot and complains a lot\nwhich is always hard\nbut you know\nnot too much problems there\ni i find myself wanting to ask um\nwhat he nags about or what he complains\nabout but i'm also\nwondering whether in the meta of your\nmind it's not acceptable to talk about\nthings like\npeople in your family and negative\naspects of them on the internet\num\ni don't mind talking about it a little\nbit like i think everyone has like\nfamily issue in it sure everyone like\njust typical chinese dad stuff\num can you please tell us about\ntypical chinese dads uh\nthis is a good example\noh like uh when we were fishing\nyou would keep complaining how i didn't\nhave the right lure because i'm not\ncatching any fish\nand like when other people on the pure\ncatching fish is like look at them they\nhave the right lure\nthis one's not the right one you got the\nwrong one and then i started catching\nfishes like 30 minutes later\nand like the whole time i was thinking\nlike no i know what lyra they're using\ni got the exact same one this is the\nright one\nbut it's like\nhe just assumes like at least for my\npoint\nhe just assumes something was wrong so\nlike i did something wrong\nand he's gonna complain about it but\nyeah um it was just like\nit's just the nature of fishing you know\ni wasn't gonna catch one right away\nbut like stuff like that\nwhere it's just like bro i just i'm here\nto spend time with you to catch fish\nwith you and i have to keep listening\nto how i got the wrong lure even though\ni know it's the right one\nyeah so it's a lot of stuff like that\nit's it's got to be rough to i mean i i\nknow you're used to it and i know it's\ntypical\nyou know i i i'm indian so i i think\nthat there's\na lot of commonality between typical\nlike chinese dads and typical indian\ndads\num at the same time i i've got to\nimagine it's like frustrating to\nbe blamed for lack of skill when\nit's rng yeah\nyeah like i feel like i can't\nbe allowed to make mistakes because like\nbecause like when you learn to do\nsomething you're going to make a lot of\nmistakes like\nfirst time you learn to knit like or\nride a bike you're going to make a lot\nof mistakes\nbut it's just a pain in the ass when\nlike your dad is\nnext to you like paying so much\nattention so the second\nyou make a mistake he just says well\nthat's wrong\nand you're thinking well obviously i\nknow what's wrong\nbut how am i gonna know what works and\nwhat doesn't unless i'm actually\ntrying to learn um but i didn't\ntell him any of that because i didn't\nwant to snap at him\nand like he's at a pretty old age and\ni'm at an age where i should be\naccepting and understanding\nand just saying oh that's just that\nbeing dead but\nit does make it difficult to spend time\nwith him sometimes\nhmm i'm just thinking about whether\nyeah thanks for sharing that i was just\ntrying to think about whether it's worth\ntalking about further or not\noh probably not\num that's family lifestyle it's just\nlike\nit is what it is so it sounds like\nyou've learned a lot from your dad's\nmistakes\num at the same time i'm wondering\nwhether\nyou've internalized any of that approach\nin the way that you interact with other\npeople\nuh someone brought it up to me and say\nwhen i was complaining about my dad\nthey're like tell us that kind of sounds\nlike you\nbecause you complain a lot about people\nas well and\nwhen they said i'm like yeah you're kind\nof right\ni do like because from my point of view\ni it\nwould be similar to my dad where you\njust want people\nlike do better like let's say they're\ndoing a golf swing and i'm\nin the back saying oh you should adjust\nfive degrees here\nbut i just do it for everything like\nwhen people are streaming\nor like when they're playing valorant\nand i was vaccinating them like\nyeah you should take look to your left\nhere and like you know you should\ngo do this go to do that and\ni can't see how i am\nsimilar in that sense so since then i've\nbeen a little more aware\nat giving feedback because i know\nsome of my friends are more receptive to\nit and some of\nmy friends are more like bro why can't\nyou just\njust be happy for me man or like\nif i if they get eighty percent on a\ntest and you're not focused on\nwell this is how you should have gotten\na ninety percent a hundred percent so\nuh i think it did subconsciously\nrub off of me on me and um\nyeah like uh the whole thing about like\nhaving respect i think as a result of\nthat\nwhat do you mean becoming like my dad\nwhen we eat dinner or lunch like the\nrule is\nnobody touches the food until\nhe does like a lot of asian\nsuperstition kind of deal like tradition\nlike we always have to be there for\nchinese new year\num i think played a role\nand like how much respect you should\nshow\nto your peers to the elders\nvery asian chinese stuff i guess\nyeah so i i can definitely see the\ncultural component so i'm gonna circle\nback to romantic relationships for a\nsecond\ndo you see this behavior as sort of\ninfluencing your romantic relationships\nwell i don't think so\ni mean i've only been in one real\nrelationship so\ni am not an expert on it\num yeah\num\ntoast i'm not quite sure where to go so\nso here's here's where you have any idea\nwhat we should talk about today\nuh\nany good drama lately oh\nwell there was that whole drama i was\ninvolved in last week but honestly\nthat's kind of over with\num\nwhy are you interested why are you\nlooking for drama to talk about\ni don't know it's more interesting\ni guess uh i like talking about things\nthat people find interesting\nyeah that's my concern\nright so like like do you want to talk\nare we here for people are we here for\nyou\nuh\nwell i've said this before um a while\nago\nis that my biggest worry with coming on\nthe show\nis that like i'm really\nsmart when it comes to like pr\nand marketing and i worry\nthat the things i say on the show is\ndesigned to evoke some kind of\npositive feelings towards me it's like\noh toast is so\ngenuine or toast is so vulnerable toast\nis so\nlike whatever now that we had the\ninside look into how his mind works we\nsee what a wonderful person he is\nand um because i am\nvery capable of doing that\nlike when i got signed to facebook and i\ndonated like\nthe 20 000 budget to children\na children's hospital right\nlike did i do that because\ni'm a benevolent person no i did it\nbecause\ni knew signing with facebook was going\nto be unpopular\nand this was a great opportunity to do\nsomething nice\nfor sick children and also to get some\ngood pr\nso toast here's what i'm feeling from\nyou\nyou're saying just enough\nand and so i i don't know exactly like i\ncan imagine that there's some\nthere are a bunch of different\ncalculations or variables in your mind\nright now to where like\ni'm detecting some amount and i i don't\nknow i don't want to like\nexpose that or bully you because like i\nwant to respect\nyour emotional boundaries and your\nprivacy\nbut i also get the sense that it's like\njust enough and i think like we're not\nreally talking about anything\nor like we're talking about stuff but\nwe're not saying anything\nand does that make sense\num kinda like i feel like\nwe would never talk about\nanything that i didn't really want to\ntalk about maybe i should talk about but\nyeah so i think that's what's going like\nso i i think that like i i need to\nunderstand from you\nyou know whether because because i try\nto talk to people like what i want to\ntalk i want to talk to jeremy i don't\nwant to talk toast you know and and i\nthink what we're here is\nis to do is to try like at least what\ni'm here to do is to try to help you but\ni think we can talk about like\nif you feel more comfortable doing\nsocietal commentary\nif you feel more comfortable you know\nhaving everyone get\nemotionally engaged with drama\nso that we don't have to like talk about\nyou like that's fine\nlike you're allowed to say i don't want\nto talk about this but what i'm kind of\nwhat i'm feeling from you is that you\nknow you're like sharing some stuff\nabout your family but like at the end of\nthe day like there are a thousand\nquestions here that i feel\nunsafe asking because\ni i think that you and i are like doing\na little bit of tango where we're like\nskirting around a lot of stuff\nand and so i think what we've got to do\nis kind of take a step back how do you\nfeel right now if i say something like\nthat like\ndo you feel pinned down or attacked in\nsome way\nuh i think it's pretty\naccurate i just don't know like\nat least consciously i don't know where\nthat wall is\nlike i think it'd be easier for you\nto like press on something\nand like if i try to like deflect or\nlike\nminimize it or only give you a crumb\nhere we go\nwhy is there a wall in the first place\nuh because\nwe are in a public setting and there are\nviewers\nand not just viewers live here but like\npeople who can watch the vods and put it\nup on youtube\nthat's a really good answer but i don't\nthink that you have a wall\njust when you're streaming on the\ninternet\num\nthat's an answer that i can never argue\nagainst because you're right\nand i think you're hiding behind it\nwhat walls do you have when no one is on\ncamera\nwhen no one is on camera\nuh i don't really talk much when\nthere's no camera on like i'm a\nintrovert\nso i'm normally really quiet around my\nfriends\nyeah good so that's a wall it's not just\nbecause you're an introvert\nright so like now we get to the crux of\nthe problem it's like\nyou can be toast but like i think the\nproblem here is that i'm not interested\nin talking to toast i'm interested in\ntalking to jeremy\nthis is a conversation between two human\nbeings like at least for me\nlike that's the only way i can do this\nlike personally like i can't\nyou know like don't give us a show toast\ni i mean\ngo ahead uh i feel like my\nentire like life is just\nbeing\nand entertainer being like being on on\ndisplay like when i play even when i\nplay games with friends like\ni would want someone to be streaming\nit's like\nuh it's really weird for me to play\ngames\nand no one is streaming it it's really\nweird for me\nto do like anything without\nit being content because my mind is just\nconstantly thinking\nlike um how do we turn this into like\nentertainment for the masses\nright why does your mind do that\nuh i think people i\ni like making people laugh\nand i like entertaining people and why\ndo you like\ni think it's because i didn't have\nfriends in high school\nuntil i became like a magician and i\nentertain people so i cannot associate\nbeing entertaining\nto a lot of my self-worth so\nif you don't entertain us today what are\nwe gonna see\nah see that question seems so\nstrange to me like i have to entertain\npeople like this conversation\nthat's entertaining to people right like\nthat's why people are watching right now\nit's because it's not entertaining in\nthis traditional sense of like\na blockbuster film but like it's\ninteresting\nto observe right\nyeah so sorry i was gonna toss out a\njoke well\nit is we are talking with this guy's\ntoast so if there's blockbuster level\nentertainment\nthis is where you find it\nso what what would we see if we if you\ndon't entertain us\nmore let's see if there's no camera\nand we're talking one-on-one\nand it's like a real therapy session\nlike completely private\nhow would i behave um\nprobably talk about my more selfish\ntendencies\nlike i feel like i put enough bad stuff\nout there so that\npeople realize that streamers\nare human beings and have flaws and\nselfish thoughts\nlike i feel like i put just enough out\nthere\nthat people go ah see ptosis\nlike you know he's got good stuff and\nhe's got bad stuff\nbut why is it important for other people\nto not view you all is good\nuh i think it makes me more\nhuman and relatable and i i\ni in hearthstone there are streamers who\nbrand themselves as super positive\nbut i hate them because so toast\nthey're really bad yep i'm gonna just\nkeep interrupting you okay\nsorry about that okay tell me if i'm\ncoming up on the line of being your\nenemy okay\nwhy do you so you say it makes me dot\ndot dot\ni'm with you there but why do you have\nto be made\ninto something\nin the first place\nright it's all a mask bro like even the\nbad stuff\nis like it's kind of like here i have a\na glass of\nclear water let me put a drop of black\nink into it\nbecause this looks too pure and like\nwhat i'm getting from you is that like\nlike you see you kind of told us like\nyou're always an entertainer you don't\nknow how to not be an\nentertainer but an entertainer is not\nwho you are it's how you've come to\nrelate to people\nand what i'm curious about is like\nwhat's going on with jeremy who's behind\nthe mask of toast\num\ni know i haven't uh really thought\nabout myself\nlike as a person\n[Music]\nlike all i care about is\nmaking content really and just trying to\nbe a good friend\nto people uh because\ni don't think it's a bad thing to\nbase your happiness on\nhow much you help other people like your\nfriends\nlike like i get a lot of joy when i see\nmy friends succeed and like i see them\nhappy\nuh that i don't really\nlike if you ask me what makes me happy\nlike besides\noh getting more viewers or getting more\nmoney\num who tries to make you happy\na few of my friends\nmy close friends uh\nhere in california where they you know\ntry to like they always tell me i should\ndo things that make me happy and not\ncare too much about like helping my\nfriends\nbut whenever they make those suggestions\ni like\ni can't even think of something that i\nwould do for myself that would make me\nhappy\nbut i can think of like 100 things i can\ndo\nfor my friends to make them happy which\ni feel like wouldn't here make me happy\ni think there's a lot of value to\naltruism but what would you say if if a\nfriend of\na friend came to you and said i don't\nknow how to make myself happy but i know\nhow to make everyone around me happy\ni only think it's a problem when that\nperson was helping others\nsacrifice their own happiness and their\nown mental health to do so\num because there there is someone like\nthat in a friend\ngroup and she is like constantly taking\non the problems of everyone like\nif someone one of her girlfriends is\nfeeling sad\nor like someone's going through drama\nlike she will\nbe the person to like listen to all of\nthat and i see the mental toll\nit takes on them like\nbecause it's so much sad and negative\nenergy\nthat they're taking in on behalf of\nother people like\nthey they revolve their identity\naround being like that supportive friend\nand uh and what's your identity\ni mean i i have a\na very distinct identity i feel like\nof just you know\nbeing reliable but also being having a\ngiant ego\ndo you have a giant ego\nthat's my persona i started\nleaning into it when back when tyler1\nand dr disrespect was being popular\nbecause i would look at them and see\nlike how\nmuch fans they would have and like\npeople you have a big ego\ni do really\ni think so i think my\nego matches like my success\num so i think your first answer i i put\nmore\nseems right to me you have the persona\nof having a big ego i think what i'm\nhearing from you is like\ni don't know it seems to me like toast\nhas dominated to jeremy like completely\nlike i think that you're a good dude i\nthink you're resilient i think you care\nabout your friends um i also hear that\nwhat you figured out\nis a formula that like oh if i make my\nfriends happy that in turn makes me feel\ngood about myself\nbut there's something weird going on\nhere man like there's something about\nlike you being an entertainer like all\nthe time and that's why i sort of ask\nabout like your romantic relationships\nbecause like i think that\noftentimes because there's there's like\na certain degree of reciprocity\nin romantic relationships there's a\ncertain degree of like authenticity\nwhere i think like what i'm almost\nhearing from you is like you're\nsignaling to like\nit's so weird it's nuanced i don't even\nknow if i'm right here but like\nsomething about you know showing a\nlittle peop\nlike a little bit of the bad stuff makes\nyou come across as like a little bit\nmore authentic\nbut there there's this part there's this\npart here where like i think\nthat you know if i had to just really\nmake a blind judgment here\nand i think this is probably where i'm\ngoing to be wrong because i think you're\npretty well constituted for lack of a\nbetter term\ni'd say like i'm worried that you're\nafraid of what would happen\nif you stop being an entertainer and i\nthink that the reason that you show\npeople bad stuff\nis because you're testing the waters\nyou're seeing\ndaddy just crying okay can\ncan you please\nyeah hold on one second now take as long\nas you need\nwhat happened hello chad\nleft alone in a room with this guy's\ntoast huh\nno doctor to help you\noh crap he's coming back\nman just when i was going for the throat\nit's going for the otk um\nbut like the concern that i have toast\nis that like\nyou know so it's interesting because you\nyou come across like so like\ni'm i'm just gonna start from the top\nokay and and like i may be completely\nout of line here so just tell me to go\n[ __ ] myself at any point\nso you know like\nyou grew up in a world where you were\nused to being a no one\nwhere like you tried to be nice to other\npeople and they took advantage of your\nkindness\nyou like grew up and like you moved to\ncanada where like you\neven in malaysia like you never spoke\ncompetently\nyou know it's either like you're not\ngood enough at chinese or not good\nenough\nat english and then you move to canada\nand it like that must have been kind of\nshocking and different\nyou know you started eating this these\nbologna and ketchup sandwiches\nand then you know one would think that\nyou were super sad\nbecause you didn't talk to anyone for a\nyear\nyou had no friends and maybe even two\nand then you started to learn magic when\nyou were in the 11th grade\nand then you began to see that oh like\nif i entertain people like\nthey'll like me right like the way to\nmake friends\nis to like make other people happy\nand so then like you know it's\ninteresting because\nwhen you say oh like i really wasn't sad\ni believe you i think that that was just\nyour experience it's sort of like\nyou know if i was born in the year 200\ni'm never going to miss the internet\nbecause i just didn't\nrealize it's a thing like i remember i i\nwent to\nyou know i used to go to india a lot and\nvisit like my ancestral village\nand and there was a kid there that was\nmy age that was like\nyou know when you come here do you take\nan airplane and i was like yes i take an\nairplane\nand then he was like why don't you how\ndo you not fall out of the airplane\nand i just laughed right because here\nthis guy's never like he's like even a\ncar\nis like a big deal like most of the time\nit's carts that are being pulled by\nbulls\nand or buffalo and so like you know when\nyou're going pretty fast it's easy to\nfall out of the cart and he's like if\nyou're going really fast like can't you\nit's just\nit was your experience and now what i'm\nhearing is that you've you've become an\namazing person like you're clearly like\nyou're a good dude\nyou help people you get enjoyment out of\nit i don't think you're a sociopath or\nanything like that\nbut then i think that there's this weird\ndilemma that you don't even know\nexactly how to recognize and like\nsometimes when you talk about emotions\nit's like it gets pretty confusing\npretty quickly\nbecause i think sometime some somewhere\nalong the way you learned how to turn\ndown the volume on your emotions and\nlike put on a show\nyou become toast and like when i asked\nyou at the beginning what do you want to\nwant me to call you you're like yeah i\nfeel\nuncomfortable if people call me jeremy i\nthought you said something like that\nand it's like okay like that's fine\nright but\nso you've become toast and even then\nwhen you think about like there are\npeople that you care about from high\nschool and you're\nyou need an excuse to reach out to them\nand it's like why is that and\nit's kind of weird like i understand it\ni understand it 100\nand i think it's it's because like\nyou're toast to the internet\ntoast is a cool guy toast is someone\nthat\neveryone wants to be friends with toast\nis legit\nbut with your friends you're jeremy\nlike jeremy is like a different kind of\nguy\nand so then we get into some of this\nweird stuff like\nwhen you're you know even\nas you come on here like there are a lot\nof like calculations going in your mind\nlike okay am i making content like what\nare people expecting\nhow do i give people what they want\nbecause that's just it's become\ni was about to say second nature to you\nbut actually it's become first nature to\nyou\nyou're always thinking about content and\nand stuff like that\nand i have no intention to you know ask\nyou a thousand questions so that you\nstart crying on stream and [ __ ] like\nwe're not gonna do that\nbecause i think you'll play that role\nfar too well\nbut i think that somewhere along the way\nthere's a part of you that's like\nstruggling a little bit to like\nknow whether is this person\ngonna like toast or is this person just\nhere for toast\nare they willing to accept like what's\nunderneath so i think you test people\ni think the reason you're mean with\npeople is because you test them\nand and you kind of like see how they'll\nreact\nand oddly enough it's it's kind of like\nthe people i think that you'll feel\nit this could get into weird patterns\nwhere sometimes when you test people\nit's actually like reassuring to you in\nsome way depending on how they respond\nbecause it means they're willing to\naccept the person who isn't doing magic\ntricks\nand then like the closer you get to them\nthe more of the authenticity you show\nand it's interesting right because\nyou're a little bit risque i think\nthat's become a part of your persona\nbut i think it's a part of you too\nbecause i don't know if you know what\nyou can\nlike what people can handle like how\nmuch here's the question\nhow much of jeremy or toast can people\nhandle\nbecause i guess in your mind you don't\nthink it's very much\ni don't like getting too close to people\ni respect not that\nanyone close to means i don't respect\nthem but more just\ni don't know that familiarity when you\nbecome like\nwhen someone's cool but you get to know\nthem really well\ncertainly they're not as cool\nbecause you know them you know\nlike uh you know let's say you meet brad\npitt\nand after you friends with him for like\nthree years\nhe's not brad pitt anymore he's just\nyour buddy brad\nkind of deal um\ngetting i feel like the more people know\nme\nthe less they\ni'm afraid they'll find out something\nthat makes them respect me less or\nsomething\num i'm not as impressive\nso maybe it's better not to become too\nclose with\npeople what's wrong with you\nnot being impressive why do you need to\nbe impressive\ni don't know everyone wants other people\nto think well of them right\nsure of course they do yeah\nso but i i think you're kind of stuck\nhere toast\nbecause who do they think well of\nwhen you get respect from someone else\nwho are they respecting\ntoast or jeremy\ni feel like i feel like they're the same\nperson at this point\nokay right but then does toast let\npeople know who he is\n[Music]\nyeah yeah i don't know\nlike when you talk about jeremy and you\ntalk about tales\nlike in my mind they're the same person\nokay at this point i don't know if\nthere's any separation\nwhat why do you need an excuse to reach\nout to your friends from high school\nuh it's just like an email you received\nlike a month ago that you meant to reply\nto but you didn't and now it's been\ntwo years and you're looking at that\nemail you're like\ngod i really should reply huh but now\nit's awkward since it's been so long i\ndon't want to reply out of nowhere so\ni'm just gonna wait until i have a\nreason to do so\nbecause i feel like i should have\nresponded and the fact that didn't\nmakes me a bad friend and it's kind of\nlike i'm a little embarrassed\nto go back and reply to that\nemail from two months ago out of nowhere\nand\nnot like did they reach out to you and\nyou didn't respond\nyeah it was uh they just said\nyou know happy new years hope you're\ndoing well\nand that was like january 1st\nyeah january 1st like 2020 so\nlike a year and five months ago okay\nthat turned out to be far more mundane\nthan i was expecting\nthat makes perfect sense man if it's\njust it's been too long to respond like\nthat carries its own\nthat has nothing to do with toast and\njeremy and all that stuff that's just\nlike\nyou know you haven't responded to\nsomeone for like 18 months so it's sort\nof like\nyeah like i i\ni'd be happy to like see them again\nbut it's just it seems so foreign that\npart of my life\nlike people i knew before i became a\ncontent creator\nwhat's your sense of why you've only had\none real romantic relationship\nwell i like to think\nmy best traits aren't\nvisible right away\nalso i'm really bad at talking to people\ni feel like uh dating people\nis a little bit of a numbers game like\nthe more people you meet\nyou're very good at talking to people\nwhat are you talking about bro\nbut that's because you know me from when\ni'm a content creator right\nso there is a difference\nuh well for the first\n26 12 25 25 years of my life like i\nwasn't a content creator\nuh i just went to school and worked like\na computer programming job\nand that's not very interesting in my\nopinion\nthere was that's not a lot of girls in\nmy life\nthat i can even talk to not that i will\ntalk to them because i\nhave no game um but\none of the nice things about being\ncontent creator is just\nlike people how i know i am\nand like hold on sorry i gotta interrupt\nhow on earth do you not have game\nuh well i i would never just talk to a\ngirl\nyou know like i used to\nthink not like an incel but\nmore like um i had this idea that\nthe more you have in common with the\ngirl\nthe higher chances of her liking you is\nso like\ni once found out that a girl i was into\nlike\ntv show at the office and i'm like okay\nso if i watch the office\nand i have something to talk about with\nher that's gonna up my odds um\nit was this idea that affection equals\nattraction\nwhen they're very two two very separate\nthing\num so\nlike my understanding of what is\nattractive to a girl was\nreally off so are you telling me that\nthe reason that you're\nnot in a relationship right now is\nbecause you don't know how\nyou have no game uh\nthat's the reason why i didn't have like\na relationship for the first 25 years\nsince becoming a content creator and a\nmega chat\ni have learned that uh\nit's hard like\nwhen it comes to what relationships\nisn't it just\nyou're either gonna end up with them for\nthe rest of your life\nor it's just a temporary thing\nand you shouldn't get too attached\nthat's a question i'm curious why you\nknow is that\nis that why you're not in a relationship\nbecause\n[Music]\nyeah i i don't think i'm ready\nto like go into a relationship\nand then with the mindset that this like\ni'm gonna make this work\nand this is the expectation that we're\ngonna be together\nfor the rest of our life because i feel\nlike that should\nbe like the mindset you have not\nnecessarily like this has to work out\nbut more like you should get into a\nrelationship\nwith the expectation that you know it's\ngonna work out and you guys are gonna\nget married\nbut so you're not you have game now\nright i have\nfame now and i have\nlike it's easier for me to believe that\ntoast you're you're doing something\nslippery you're being slippery\nso when i ask you what like because\nhere's the thing every now and then\nyou give me a really good answer\nand it's one that makes a lot of sense\nand one that i can't push back at at all\nlike if you're like oh like\ni'm not ready for a relationship like\nyou know because like the relationships\nare about commitment and like i'm just\nnot ready to commit and it's like bro\nlike you know if you're not ready for a\nrelationship makes perfect sense like\nif that's really the reason like\nabsolutely makes perfect sense while\nyou're\nnot in a relationship but when i push\nand i say is the reason you're not in a\nrelationship\nright now because you're like not ready\nfor a commitment and you can say like\nbut then we get to this fame and game\nstuff and like that's where like\nsomeone doesn't smell right\nit's like i think what we're hearing is\nlike the answer from\nthe mask right which is like it makes\nperfect sense and i'm not saying it's\nwrong but i think there's something else\nlike underneath\nwhich is like what you have now is fame\nso like who are they dating\n[Music]\nand so if at some point toast becomes\ni'm just gonna keep going\nokay so if at some point toast becomes\njeremy\nwhat do they do\nthey leave the nest and never come back\nmm-hmm right because then it it that at\nthat point it's like you know brad pitt\nbecomes your buddy brad\nbeautifully put and so like what i'm\nwhen i and this this could be like\ni may not be right here toast i'm really\nnot sure because like\ni'm just gonna keep going though\nbecause i i don't even know how much of\nthis is gonna resonate but like what i'm\nkind of feeling from you is like\nsomewhere\nin there there's like some general\nreluctance\nfor you to let people because we've\nheard this like we've heard like\nsnippets of it and maybe i'm\nputting together a puzzle piece that's\nnot like you know a puzzle that's not\nreally there but it's like\nlike i think at some point you've got to\nlet people\nget to know jeremy right you've got to\nstop being the entertainer you've got to\nlike start because you have game\nbro like you at like forget about the\nfame you like a hundred percent have\ngame like you know you do\nactually maybe you don't know but you've\ngot game like i\nyou know how to talk to people i'm a\n[ __ ] sake dude you know how to talk to\npeople\nmaybe i'm wrong like maybe you don't\nfeel that way but like i think that\nthere's no way that the entertainer\nskills don't translate like it's not\nbecause you're right that like jeremy\nand toast have become like blended like\nyou know how to like\nyou know how to bring the best out of\npeople's potential like you know\nwhat also look at yourself in the mirror\nsometime like you've got game bro\nuh\none thing i will say it feels like it's\na little easier\nin the scene because most gamers are\nnot that socially aware and\nit's just because i've been a streamer\nfor so long that it\ncame eventually like being able to talk\nto people\nyeah um but now i feel a little more\ncomfortable but it's also it makes me\nfeel a lot better going to conversations\nthat people know who i am um\nbecause it makes me more comfortable\nuh not that i didn't know i'm a big deal\nbut more like\num they would\nfind me interesting to talk to\nright so so this this is i i think maybe\nhard\ntoast but like why do you think they\nwouldn't find you interesting to talk to\nanyway\nthey don't really stand out like\nif you take away you know\nthe fact that i am a streamer like what\nyou\nwhat you end up with is what you can\nfind anywhere right\nlike uh some form of higher education\nuh into like slightly sarcastic\npersonality\na little above average iq but\nnot very productive goes on reddit a lot\num\nand not a lot of experience with women i\nfeel like uh\nstuff like that like people like that\nare\nso common sounds perfect\ni'm serious because like sure those are\nsome of your attributes but that's not\nactually who you are\nyou're engaging intelligent funny\nkind yeah but people\ndon't see that right how can they\nwhen you don't let them\nhaving people don't have a reason to\neven try to find out\nright why put in effort like i don't put\nan effort with someone who\nmight be like hiddenly entertaining or\nlike talented like i only put an effort\nonce i see bits and pieces of it\nright so\nwhy not just go get to know someone who\nis interesting versus like who might be\ninteresting\na fair point right so but i i think that\nthis is where\ni imagine we're gonna land i hope we\nland somewhere in the middle because\nyou're right that like if someone is\nan introvert who doesn't talk to anyone\nlike i don't know why i would go and try\nto get to know them really well for the\noption of like\nyou know becoming you know falling in\nlove and spending the rest of our lives\ntogether\non the flip side at the other end of the\nspectrum is toast that everyone knows\neverything about\nand all the work has been done and they\nfeel like they know who you are and then\nyou're kind of trapped in the middle\nbecause\nif you lean too heavily on toast\neventually they're gonna get to know\njeremy\nand then brad pitt becomes your buddy\nbrad beautiful by the way\nright and then at the other end of the\nspectrum is like the ninth grader who\nwho no one will speak to who and i know\nthis is where\nnow like things get real a little bit\ntricky because\nwas that person worth knowing\num no i don't think so\ni think\ni think in this world society\noh i think just in this at least in this\nscene the streaming scene is like\nsink or swim kind of deal like if we\nconstantly think about like\nwhat someone could be um\nit's really hard because you can you can\nhelp so much people right there are so\nmuch\nsmall streamers who are struggling out\nthere who\nyou know are just looking for that\nchance but\nmy my like way of thinking when it comes\nto stuff like this is like\nbro it's up to you to make yourself\ninteresting and\nlike it's up to you to entice people to\nwant to get to know you better right\nlike you might be interesting underneath\nall that and\nyou know have a lot of potential in you\nbut people\nshouldn't have to\ngo like finding out right\nyeah so that's kind of it's in i think\nit makes a lot of sense but like i also\nthink it's weird to hear you say that\nbecause there are a lot of people out\nthere with a lot of potential whereas\nlike what are you good at toast\n[Music]\nyou're good at bringing people's\npotential out\nyeah i would say so which sounds to me\nlike a little\nlike now i get confused because i'm with\nyou like so i think ever\nin a sense everything you're saying\nmakes sense that if you want to make it\nas a streamer\nand if you want to like i think this is\ntrue like if you want to find a good\npartner\nyou gotta advertise like they're not\ngonna come\nyou know like dig underneath layers and\nlayers of stuff but i\ni think that there's like you're kind of\nlike i'm feeling you i'm feeling that\nthis conversation keeps bouncing between\ntwo extremes\nwhich is one is like you know there's a\npart of you that's toast and you should\nabso\nabsolutely advertise your good qualities\nand like that's a piece of it\nbut i think there's this other weird\nthing where like underneath toast and\nthe reason you like being toast is\nbecause\nyou know i'm just gonna put it out there\nthis is a no-brainer like fundamentally\nsomewhere down there i think you feel a\nlittle bit unlovable\nright like you feel like there's like a\nlike a touch of the ugliness in there\nand like we hear it manifest in weird\nways like i have fame but i don't have\ngame bro you have tons of game\nlike i hate to break it to you because i\ni think you can't it's not just your\nfame it's like\nit's the things that made you famous\nwhich you have\nright it's it's that part that it's your\nability to make other people laugh it's\nyour ability to like notice things in\nthe world around you and be a little bit\nsarcastic\nlike your persona is a part of who you\nare\nbut i think like underneath like there's\nstill the ninth grader\nand so when it goes back to high school\nit's like you become successful you\nbecome someone that everyone wants to be\nfriends with\napparently you become someone that we dm\nonce a month asking you to come on\nstream because you're hot [ __ ]\nand so i think you end up like testing\npeople to see like what if i'm not toast\nlike what if i\ndon't act what if i don't entertain like\nwhat will you think about me then\nand it's been you've been doing it for\nso long that like the two have gotten\ntangled up and all you are is toast\nbut i think that there's you know when\nyou talk about the wall like i think the\nreason the wall is there is because\nyou're afraid of what's on the other\nside\nwhich is someone that's not worth\nknowing and then we get stuck\nbecause that will always be true\nuntil you let the wall down you let\nsomeone see what's on the other side and\nthey're like\nyeah that guy's cool\nand the reason i keep on hammering on a\nromantic relationship is because i think\nthat\nyou're not gonna it's gonna be hard to\nsucceed in a romantic relationship until\nyou do that\nbecause i don't know that you can be an\nentertainer like 24 7 for\nyour likes like significant other\noh the solution is to just be\nentertaining all the time from the\nsounds of it\nlike i i guess that's the way i think\nlike i understand\nwhy it's it's not the solution bro it's\nthe problem\nbecause do you see what you're doing to\nyourself\nelevating myself by constantly pushing\nmyself forward\nso yeah i mean you're you're you're\ntrapping yourself by going to higher and\nhigher elevations\nit's like you're like a cat that climbs\nup the tree and doesn't know how to get\ndown like the solution is not for you to\nbe entertaining\n100 of the time\nit's the opposite\nhow does that sound to you\ni would rather just\nfigure out a way to be even more\nentertaining honestly\num\ntoast yeah go keep going sorry\nit's just like you know i started off as\na\nsomeone who just posts infographics on\nreddit right and then i became a\nhearthstone youtuber\nand then a hearthstone streamer and then\na tft stream ready to\nmove to california and like became like\nnot just a hearthstone gamer but like a\ncontent creator that\ncollabs with other content creators and\nthen\nyou know offline tv and among us blowing\nup and now\nlike being friends with like even\nlike people who i i look up to or like\ncontent i used to watch right it's just\nlike this career it's just a constant\nsense of like you know let's let's keep\ngoing let's keep going like i wanna\nwork in hollywood i wanna write a script\ni wanna like meet taylor swift kind of\ndo i wanna be friends with taylor some\nkind of deal\nbut there's a sense of just\nconstantly elevating yourself right\nand because we see streamers become\nirrelevant very often\num they might have 10 000 viewers one\nday and like\nnext year the game dies or\nyou know they take a break and become\nirrelevant\nand\nyeah it's just constantly\npushing yourself to raise yourself up\nthat sounds exhausting\nyeah but you know in terms of job\nlike it's a it's a pretty good gig you\nknow\nwhat are you hearing me say\nyou said it sounded exhausting yeah but\nin general like\ndo you get the sense i feel like i'm\ntrying to present something to you and i\ni don't think we're on the same page\nwhat do you think what what are you\nhearing me\nwhen when i try to understand you what\nare you\nhearing like what's your impression of\nwhat i think\nis going on with you\nuh impression is that\ni revolve a lot of my identity\nand self-worth and being like\nan entertainer and like you said it's\nexhausting or it's like\npeople\nlike constantly having to like\npush and\nlike being entertained 24 7.\nlike you it's definitely meant to be\ntaken as not a great thing right\nas a tiring thing to do over and over\nagain\nuh but is is that it\num it just feels feels like uh like the\nscene is\nit's very doggy dog kind of deal\nand that's kind of what i like about it\nas well\nso yeah i think that's that's a good\nsummary what what are you\nwhat are you hearing i'm at what am i\nadvocating that you do\nnot revolve my self-worth around like\nlike i should do things i don't know\npeople\nlike should i learn to do things that's\nnot content should i pick\nup a hobby for myself for my like\nown mental health but what if my\nown mental health is just like my hobby\nis being an\nentertainer right okay so i'm gonna ask\nyou one more question toast\nyou can dodge as many questions as you\nwant to please be\ncompletely honest with this one no\ndodging allowed okay\non a scale of one to ten of stupidity\nten being this is the stupidest\nidea that's ever been conceived in the\nworld and one is this is\nabsolutely brilliant what do you think\nabout the plan that i'm advocating for\nyou\nis it just the dumbest [ __ ] [ __ ]\nyou've ever heard of\nor is it absolutely brilliant uh-huh\nno what's this plan specifically\nto try to be less of an entertainer to\ntry to show\nwhich one which number was the dumb one\n10 is a dumb one\nthen it's 10. okay\ngood uh like yeah i mean my\nmy career is based on\nbeing entertaining i completely\nyeah it'd be crazy to not\nthink about content all the time and i\nlike it's like i also enjoy\ndoing it it was something like oh god i\nhate doing content or like i can't think\nabout that stuff right now\nthat makes sense but like the idea of\ngetting more people to like me\nis really appealing to me like on social\nmedia like what post\nwould people want um\ni agree like great\nwhy is it sometimes i try and force\nthing sorry why do you\nwhy do you want to be bigger\ni believe\ni was i am destined to have a big impact\non the world\nit's like main character syndrome i have\nthat\nlike there's no way i've been put on\nthis earth\nto just be a regular person\num i'm here to have an\nimpact like a big impact\nand you know it might be on my desk bed\nthat i realized ah\nturns out i was just slightly above\naverage but\nlike even now my expectation is that in\n10\nyears i would have done\nor 10 or 20 years that i would have done\nsomething that\nleaves a huge impact on the world and i\nthink\nat this rate it might be something in\nthe entertainment scene\num maybe in 20 years that streaming\nyou know it's like you got you got music\nand then you have movies\nand tv and streaming is like right\nalongside\nof it and like\npeople will remember me as\ni know a walt disney of streaming or\nsteven spielberg or streaming\num i it could end up being something\nelse like i don't know maybe i start\ncaring about\nworld hunger or something but\num that's why i want to get bigger\nall the time it's like i'm fulfilling\nmy colon called destiny\nbeautiful love it\nhow do you feel about sharing that\nuh you think you overstepped a little\nbit showed a little bit of what's\nunderneath the mask\nwell i've talked about this a little bit\nthis also feeds into my whole ego\npersona which is why i'm okay with it\nand a lot of people say like everyone's\nthe main character\nin their own story right but i have\nmet people who are just content with\nlife\nin terms of like you know being an\naccountant\nstarting a family and that's what the\nmajority of people\nend up doing um\nbut i feel like there's that subset of\npeople who i'm gonna be\na famous hollywood star and then move to\ncalifornia things don't work out\ni i just have this expectation that\nthings will always work out\nfor me because it's\nmeant to work out for me right\nso toast i actually owe you an apology\nwhy because i think i was trying to lead\nyou somewhere\nand i think that was a mistake\nso i i'm still pretty confident that i'm\nright about most of what i said i just\ndon't think it's like\ni don't think it matters right now oh\nwell what did you\nlearn from uh what i said just\nnow so you want to make an impact right\nyeah like what is the nature of the\nimpact that you're looking for\nto leave a legacy to be remembered\nto be noticed\nright and what i see that is is like\nyou're never gonna be the ninth grader\nwho doesn't talk to anyone\never again and you're gonna rise so high\nthat no one will ever be able to leave\nyou behind\nwhere you are the ceiling you determine\nthe ceiling you are the measure against\nwhich other people\naim to be\nyou know like that's when you'll be\nsecure\nlike when you're absolutely on top is\nwhen you don't have to worry about\nbeing left behind like\nand so i i see what drives you i think\nit's great that it drives you i think\nit's actually very\nadaptive i think it's going to cause you\na lot of suffering\nyears from now but i think that maybe\nthat's what we need to have another\nconversation\nif if if so this is what i'll leave with\nyou leave you with okay\ni think it's great that you're driven to\nbe the best\nto be this wonderful thing and i think\nit's like my head is so far up my ass in\nterms of\nthinking that you should it's really a\nmistake on my part like i was\napplying my own value system to you how\nold are you now toast\nif you don't uh 29. okay so i'm like\na decade older than you are i'm married\ni have kids and all that kind of stuff\nso like my\nposition is is different from yours\num for what it's worth i felt the same\nway that you did many many years ago\num so i i'd say that really like my\nmy the mistake that i made is i was\ntrying to have a conversation with you\nthat was like\npotentially a decade too early maybe\nit'll never be there maybe actually\nyou'll\nyou know you'll end up in a completely\ndifferent place and the conversation\nwill never be appropriate\nbut i'm still hearing i think the\nmistake that i made is that i i get the\nsense that\ni mean i think i'm i'm pretty confident\nthat your drive to succeed\ncomes from a sense of inadequacy\nwhat do you think about that\nuh i can agree with that um\ni find myself when it comes to like\nrelationships and dating\ni tend to gravitate towards girls\nthat are\nhaving problems with their lives or like\nneeds to be\nfixed in some way or just like yep\nthat i can be of use besides just like\nbeing smart or being funny or being\ncarried but like actual\ndirect use like you can demonstrate your\nvalue in the relationship you can bring\nyes right demonstrating value is very\nimportant\nright and like why does someone need to\ndemonstrate\nvalue toast that\ni mean that's just how humans work right\nlike if you're gonna date someone you\ngotta demonstrate\nvalue so that nope they are worth it to\nyou\nthat's not how humans work so that that\nthat is how humor is what like in a\nrelationship like\ni mean value can be so many different\nthings right if they make you laugh\nyou know that's value if they're\nphysically\nfit you know and you're attracted that\nthat's value so there's a key\nthere's a key word there which is\ndemonstrate\ndemonstrate is about showing\nso i think the crazy thing here and this\nis where like i'm going to bark up this\ntree as long as i want to is never going\nto get anywhere\nwhich is like you bring value to the\nrelationship without fixing someone's\nproblems\nlike that's the fundamental disagreement\nthat you and i have\nwhat do you think about that\nright because like like this is this is\nhow this works it's like why do you\ngravitate because\nyou're like halfway there it's just like\nwhy do you gravitate towards people\nwho you can fix it's because so you can\nlike demonstrate your value white is\ndemonstrating your value like why is\nthat important to you because\nit solves an anxiety that you're not\nbringing value\nbecause if you can show them and you can\nshow yourself\nhey look what i bring to this\nrelationship\nthen it's like everything's fine does\nthat make sense\nit's like very like psychologically\nappeasing\nto bring value to a relationship\nthere's proof there's evidence\nwhat do you think about that\n[Music]\ni just don't think my\nbest traits are visible\nby like just north day-to-day\nbeing able to like be an entertainer and\nlike\nof actual use like solving people's\nproblems\nit's more believable for me when someone\nis attracted to that exactly\nwell said right but but now now there's\nan important word there and i i'm\nmaybe i should just stop at this point\nlike let me know like does this do you\nthink we're making it\nlike is this worth our time or am i just\nare we just ships passing in the night\nand like this is an unproductive\nconversation what are you thinking i\nneed an honest answer from you bro\ni think we're on the same page in terms\nof like\nlike why my way of thinking isn't that\nit's a little\nlike i should believe in myself that you\nknow me as a person\nis enough and like people would want to\nget into relationships with me with just\nbeing myself\nbut\nbut\njust makes me feel better man like if uh\nif it just makes me feel a little more\nconfident a little\nless insecure because i i know\nthat the bad thing about the way i think\nwhen it comes to like fixing people\nis eventually i'm gonna run out things\nto fix right\nlike let's say i found this girl and i\nfixed her up\nand she's an amazing woman but one day\nshe's i if i'm doing my job correctly\nshe's gonna be fixed and there's nothing\ngonna like there's no problem for me to\nsolve and that's when i start then\nwhat no what is she gonna do when you\nfix her\nwell\nmaybe peace out or you know\nleave the nest because\nshe doesn't need you anymore because\nthe foundation of your relationship\nwas you being of value to her and if the\nonly thing that you bring to her is\nvalue\nand you're done with that then she\ndoesn't need you anymore\noh maybe in the time we were together\nshe\nliked what she saw and would stay\nyeah so i just gotta rope him in first\nwith uh\ngot him helpful gotta have the right\nlure on the hook\nyeah and then you know\nthen i can demonstrate like\njeremy in a way\nwhat do you think about that\nseems perfect and perfectly fine\nwhat's the i mean the downside is oh she\nleaves\nand i don't think i'm that\nbullish or naive to help someone\nwho is only interested in like\ntheir their own selves or like selfish\nnature i think\ni'm really good at finding people that\nare good people and i think so i'm\nhelping them\nthat they already passed a lot of like\nmy internal check mark i think so too\nbut i i do think it's important toast to\nlike\nrecognize that at some point you're\ngonna have to make that transition\nand to recognize that that transition\nwhere you show her who jeremy is and\nmaybe she'll stick around\nshe doesn't need you anymore\nlike that's going to be terrifying for\nyou\nor is it not am i wrong there\nyou seem skeptical i'm confident which\nmeans that i think we just\nwe're on the same page there maybe we've\nsplit\num maybe i used too strong of a word\nmaybe no more or reluctant\nuh i think if i was like that was a girl\nhe would be the kind of girl to not just\nleave\nafter she's fixed up\nbut this is the problem man how do you\nknow whether she's that kind of girl or\nnot\nah\ni mean this is all on top of my\nwe i know we didn't really talk about\nthis file so don't like being committed\nin a relationship right now either so\ni don't think it's just me not finding\nthe right girl\nas well i think it's just\ni feel like when i'm dating someone it's\nessentially\ncommitting the rest of my life with them\nthat does sound to me to be a little bit\ndifferent but but\ni mean if if you want me to toast\nbecause you know this is i'm a\npsychiatrist i don't know if you do this\nbut if you knew this but\nas psychiatrists sometimes we can always\nfind a way to prove ourselves right\nit's one of the flaws of our profession\nand it's one that i'm afraid i could be\nfalling into which is why i need your\nyou know i need you to tell me but i can\ntwist that\ninto exactly what we're talking about\nnow too if you want me to\ni'm gonna give it a quick shot uh\nno i i just think\nthe problem isn't the the girl\nhere i agree\nwhat do you think the problem is the\nbigger problem is just i\nlike it's either life or like death\ndo us a part or it's just one-time fling\nright yep so so why why are you afraid\nto go down the death to us part route\ni don't know and this is a long time\nsince\nit's a long time\ni i breakups are hard\nbreakups are really hard\nand i don't like the idea of going\nthrough a breakup\nlike it's normal for relationships to\nnot work out\nbut man i i feel really bad having to\nbreak up with someone\nto a point where i just rather not\nbe what's so hard about breakups\ni mean you care about this person a lot\nright\nbut you also can't\nlike you you're gonna if you guys are\nbreaking up you reach the point where\nit's better for you guys to not be with\neach other\nand like all that time you shared with\neach other\nlike to just become\nessentially strangers after like\nso long\nthat's that's uh i hate hurting people's\nfeelings\nand it's easier to just not be in a\nrelationship\nthis way one's feelings get hurt right\nyeah sounds very logical yeah\nwhy why does anyone ever engage in a\nrelationship then\nmakes them happy\nwould a relationship make you happy\nah\ni think until i'm okay\nwith the idea of like breakup being a\npossibility\ni don't think a relationship will make\nme happy because\nit's always going to be in the back of\nmy head like\ni'll toast hope you're in for the long\nhaul because you're going to be with\nthis person until\nyou die or i hope you're ready to break\nsomeone's heart\nand make them cry and like\nbeing in a relationship with that in the\nback of your mind the whole time\ngives me a lot of anxiety and like\nmakes me feel like a fraud when i'm with\nthe person like\noh god she doesn't know that i'm gonna\nhave to break up with her eventually\nyeah makes sense\nit sounds like you're trying to protect\npeople\nyeah is that weird to say\nno no\ni think because of my like whole\ni gotta climb i gotta climb i'm afraid\nthat i'm applying that to my romantic\nlife as well\nit's like oh this girl is like\nthis this this and this but what if\nanother girl comes along that's like\neven upgrade better in every single way\nand i used to feel like that more\nstrongly but these days\ni realize um you know everyone is very\ndifferent in their own way\nand honestly like time spent with\nsomeone is worth something right\nlike the memories you've built the\nhardship in dior\ni used to have this attitude that\nthere exists perfect relationships out\nthere\nbut like realistically\nfor every human being in the world\nthere's like\nthousands of people that they can end up\nmarrying and like\nliving the rest of their lives out with\nright\nthere's no one right person and it's\ncrazy to think about\nin my opinion that we have this one life\nand let's say there's multiple timelines\nlike in this timeline\ni married woman a and i'm happy\nand i die of old age with her and\nthere's another timeline\nlike and i met woman b first and i can\nmarry her as well\nand i dialed with her like like marriage\neven though it's meant to seem like such\nan important\nfinal choice\nit there's no right answer it could be\nnot any woman but there is like\nmultiple possibilities\nand that's scary because it's easy when\nthere's a right choice\nbut one is like oh yeah you can end up\nwith her girl died together\ni came out with her and grow old and die\ntogether\nthere's no right answer and\nthat is a little scary to me\nbecause i kind of grew up with the whole\nlike\nfairytale romantic outcome but i'm\nlearning that you know there are some\npeople in life you're going to be more\ncompatible with\nand there are multiple partners that\nare suited for you to spend the rest of\nyour life with\nmakes a lot of sense man yeah\ni can imagine how that can be kind of\nlike\nbewildering right because if there isn't\na right answer\nthen how do you know who to pick\ncan i think for a second yeah sure\nhow you feeling right now uh\ngood okay good i feel like we talked\nabout relationships a lot\nuh which does make me just a tiny bit\nuncomfortable\nmore because i know every like my\n[ __ ]\nfriends and family are watching\nand they would\nyou know people love talking and\ngossiping and\nuh\ni know i feel like relationships to one\nthing\ni try to keep quiet about\nnot for me but for the\npeople it might affect sure\ni i think you've mentioned several times\ni think it's it's you made clear to me\nthat from a value standpoint\nyou are you're very protective of the\npeople that you care about\nand that you're actually okay like you\nknow being attacked personally or like\nbeing made fun of but when it comes to\nthe people that you care about\nit's like the no no zone yeah\nbecause everyone had different about i\ncan set my own boundaries but\nyeah i would never want to serve for\nsomeone else\nso i know that the topic is\nrelationships what's your understanding\nof why i keep on asking because i'm the\none who's driving the relationship\nconversation right that's me in the\ndriver's seat\nwhy do you think i'm driving there\nah\nis it because i it's the one thing i\ndon't want to talk\nsorry um like i'm hiding something there\nlike\nthere's something there yep that's\nthat's why good\nthat's exactly right so so can i explain\nwhat i think is there\nso i think like the the challenge is\ngoing to be that you have too many right\nanswers if we talk about\nanything else\ndoes that make sense yes\nso it's going to be too easy to pull me\ninto an intellectual conversation about\nwhat's good to do and what's bad to do\nso i think relationships is like where\nlike there's a lot of stuff\nlike you know here that i think that\nyou can't quite make as much of an\nabstract argument about\nso when i when i ask you about\nrelationships i don't know if you notice\nbut i'm not asking anything about anyone\nthat you've been in a relationship with\nlike i get that you have that boundary\ni'm you know i'm asking about you\nin the relationship how you approach\nrelationships how you think about\nrelationships what you're afraid of\nand i think the reason is because with\nthe relationship\nis like the thing that brings the\ntension between jeremy\nand toast kind of like front and center\nfor me like\nout of everything we've talked about\nbecause i think you can be like a noble\nfriend and you're\nin your like platonic relationships\ni can be i think you probably are a\nwonderful sibling and a wonderful son\num i i think that you do right by a lot\nof people because you care about a lot\nof people\ni think relationships is the one thing\nwhere like\nthings are gonna start to feel a little\nbit more contradictory it's also\nchallenging because as a streamer\nfriendship is so complicated already\nright because there's like are we\nfriends because we like each other\nor are we friends because we collab and\nwe make good content together like why\nis this person hanging out with me\nit all gets tangled together right\nbecause this is a professional\nrelationship is it a\nplatonic relationship like it's all\ntangled\nbut what i'm hearing from you toast is\nis oddly enough even though you disagree\nwith me i'm i'm kind of\nfinding that no actually you don't just\ni think we're as you mentioned i think\nwe're actually kind of on the same page\ni think you've got to continue to climb\nbut the the concern that i have is at\nsome point i think if you want to be\nin a healthy romantic relationship\nand yeah i mean you know these things\ndude like you're the one who's giving me\nthe ammo because you're like i try to\ndate people who are busted in some way\nso that i can try to fix them and then\nlike\ni know it sounds kind of weird but i\nthink everyone can actually identify\nwith that and why do you try to fix them\nit's because it makes you feel good\nright like they know what you're\nbringing to the table so that you don't\nhave to worry about being\nand sorry if this is out of line but you\ndon't have to worry about being 9th\ngrade jeremy\nbecause you can you feel more\ncomfortable with like them knowing toast\nbecause then you don't have to be 9th\ngrade jeremy\nand you want to rise to the top of your\nfield because if you're at the top of\nyour field you certainly ate 9th grade\njeremy\nso i hear i see a theme which i don't\nknow if it's right or wrong it's really\nfor you to think about you got to tell\nme like\nthat's right or that's wrong\nbecause i think you do bring a lot of\nvalue to people i think you're a very\ngood entertainer\nand i'm a little bit afraid that it's\ngoing to be hard for you to show\nsomeone if someone knows your fame\nit's going to be hard for them to like\nyou even told us right like you're\nyou're kind of like\nbrad pitt and your buddy brad\nand making that transition is going to\nbe hard and there are all these\ndifferent things that like\nthe theme that i see here is that you're\ntrying to move away from 9th grade\njeremy in as many ways as possible\neither you date someone who you can fix\nor you demonstrate your value\nbecause the idea that you have intrinsic\nvalue is like kind of confusing\nand i know that intellectually you\nunderstand that concept\nbut let's be clear having intrinsic\nvalue does not make you a successful\nstreamer\nhaving extra intrinsic value makes you a\nsuccessful streamer\nand so you have a world that reinforces\nthis principle which is\nabsolutely true and at the end of the\nday\nlife is good enough so what are we even\ntalking about here which i get\ncompletely because i i here i am pushing\nyou to change something that you don't\nthink is not only broke\nit's not broken it's amazing it's the\nreason for your success and here's\n[ __ ]\nthis guy telling you to like be\ndifferent like show people what's\nunderneath the mask like\nshow people that that you can be 9th\ngrade jeremy you're like how [ __ ]\ndumb is that\nthe whole reason that i am where i am is\nbecause i moved away from ninth grade\njeremy and i became someone else\ni learned how to be entertaining i\nlearned how to be useful to the people\naround me\ninstead of someone who sits alone in the\ncafeteria and doesn't talk to a soul i\ndon't want to be that person\nand you're right like your success is\nbecause you aren't\nninth grade jeremy you're disguised\ntoast\nright like your toast that's who you are\nyou bring value you protect people\nyou collaborate with people you bring\nyou you bring people to their full\npotential\nand you're going to make your mark on\nthe world you're going to start\nstreaming before the first tft streamer\nstarts\nyou're going to stop streaming after the\nlast tft streamer restarts\nno way to get left behind if you're at\nthe front of the pack\nuh i like having power\nand authority because i trust myself\nto use it responsibly\nwhen it's other people at the helm\nlike if certain people have like power\nor like authority over others\ni feel like it's not always used\nfairly like this\ninjustice and what other people\ndo and\ni trust myself the most that given a\nleadership role\nor like a power dynamic that i would\nalways make the right choice for\neveryone\num i have this\nbig sense of\nrighteousness or like justice\nin my like in my world\nlike i hate like i hate it when people\nare rude or bullies like\ni get really triggered by it and that's\nalso one of the reason why i push myself\na lot because\npeople are selfish and they're prone to\ndoing stupid\nselfish things that put themselves\nit's like that marathon again right when\ni'm\nleading the pack it's easy for me to\nlook back\nand like see where everyone elevate\nother people bring them forward yeah\nyeah but i've seen what it's like for\nothers to be like ahead of a pack\nlike you have the power but not use it\nfor others\nand i don't like it when that happens so\ni like that's why i\nfeel like i need to be constantly bigger\nand also you know again i don't want\nthem leaving the nest as well\ndo you actually mean that or was that a\njoke\nuh i i do feel a little\ni do feel negative feelings\nlike what is sadness or like resentment\nwhen\nsomeone just completely\nup and leaves not like disappear\nbut more just like hey i'm gonna\nassociate with those guys now\nyou know like adios\nadios kind of deal i'm gonna go play\nwith those guys because\nuh that's my crew now you know i get\nmore viewers with them or i\nget more attention with them but\ni i know it's normal to want that but\nit does feel like empty nest syndrome\nwhere i just\nyou know at the very least i wish they\nbut come visit every now and then\ninstead of just making it feel like they\nforgot about us\nnot just me specifically but like i mean\nit does affect me but\nlike if they came back to the nest and\nstill like played with\nlike other friends or people they used\nto play with like that's\nfine but when they completely up and\njust\nonly focus on their own thing and like\nbranch out i do feel\nsad i feel sad i guess yeah\nokay so yeah yeah\nfor what it's worth toast i i think it\nmakes sense that you trust yourself\nyou know i i i think you seem like a\ngood dude\ni can understand why you trust yourself\ni think it's kind of tricky though\nbecause\nthe more that you the more you're forced\nto trust yourself the harder it is to\ntrust other people\nand what i'm kind of hearing even is as\nyou kind of talk about\nempty nest syndrome is it's like it's\nlike sort of a\nyou know you talk about sadness i i'm\nfeeling\na lack of fairness a lack of reciprocity\na certain not just sadness like\nif my dog passes away like that's sad\nlike there's a certain like not quite\nmaliciousness but like\nmaybe even obliviousness or lack of\ncompassion or consideration\nthat feels very unfair to me about what\nyou're describing\nyes okay um\ncan i can i toss one last uh\num\ncan i test one last provocative thing\nyour way\nso i could also imagine given what we\njust talked about that you trust in\nyourself and it's hard to trust other\npeople because\npeople have like you know taking\nadvantage of your kindness\nand they've left you hanging fair\nyeah yeah yeah i can imagine that it\nwould be hard\nto want to be in a committed\nrelationship because like that's kind of\nthe situation where like if you're going\nall in and someone leaves the nest then\nbecause like that's when they're not\nsupposed to leave right like that's the\nwhole point of a committed relationship\nit's like a promise\nand and when i just kind of put myself\nin your shoes for a second\nlike i kind of think about what would\nhurt the most\nis it's if i go all in and they say they\ngo all in\nand then they don't go all in\nand that like i don't think i would want\nto open myself up to that\npossibility of hurt\num\n[Music]\ni feel like in all the dating\ni've done you know in the last four or\nfive years i've always\nbeen the one with one foot out the door\nand i don't know why like\nwhat do you think\ni think when you have one foot out the\ndoor you minimize\nthe hurt like oh you can't get upset at\nme because i said it wasn't serious\ncandy or like\ni just feel\nbad like i feel like i'm lying to a girl\nwhen i start dating them\nbecause i feel like the girls are always\ngoing in with like\nstrong commitment with the expectations\nthat we're gonna get married\nand when i enter like dating a\nrelationship\nit's always very that's\nprobably not gonna work out\nand i always feel like some anxiety\nlike oh i have this knowledge that it\nwon't work out but she doesn't know\nso i'm misleading her\nand i should just break up with her\nright now\nso i i feel like we could dig into this\nmore i'm sort of\ni want to be a little bit cognizant of\ntime so let me ask you like wonder\nbecause i it's too juicy\ntoast too much of an entertainer\nyou know why do you think you have one\nfoot out the door\nright because i get what you're saying\nthat like\nyou know it's sort of unfair to them\nbecause you have one foot out the door\nwhen things start and you try to be\ntransparent with them\nbut damn it you're such a mega chad they\nfall in love with you anyway\nbut why don't you let me put it this way\nso let me try to reframe a little bit\nlike is it that you have one foot out\nthe door or you only put one foot in the\ndoor\n[Music]\nmaybe it's the second one i don't feel\nlike i've ever\nwent into a relationship\nwith really high hopes\nand maybe i shouldn't have gotten into\nthose relationships in the first place\nso what keeps you from having high hopes\ni don't know i i keep\nlike like sometimes i wish i would come\nacross a girl\nthat makes me feel like bam\ni am ready for marriage kind of deal\num i don't know if a girl\nlike that exists because i've\nmet a lot of you know amazing\nyou know girls or talented but\nwould you let yourself fall in love\nah\ni don't think so i think\ni think i need to be\nokay with the relationship\nnot working out because if i'm not okay\nwith that if i enter a relationship\nlike that anxiety eats me up because i\nhave tried like\ndating and being in a relationship with\nsomeone and like\ni just remember like one weekend like\nthat it's in the\nback of my head just like oh god what if\nwe break out what if we break our\nfreak out and it made me like not want\nto be\nthat made me check out from the\nrelationship like almost like\nin the self-sabotaging way of just like\nokay\nlet's just get it over with then and\num i feel like i would feel like that\nno matter who it is and that i need to\nsomehow be okay with the idea that\nit's normal in a relationship for people\nto break up things don't always work out\nsure but yeah i mean i think that would\nbe wonderful\nwe could wave a magic wand and have you\nbe okay with it\nbut i think the real question is why\naren't you okay with it to begin with\ni don't want to hurt people's feelings\nthat's rude\num\nlike why do that to someone you care\nabout right\nlike even if i we don't end up together\nlike if i'm dating them it's because\ni care about them a lot\nbut where do you get the idea that\nthings are going to end poorly right\nbecause there's that thought in your\nhead that you're just going to end up\nhurting her\nthis is kind of interesting because it's\nsort of like this weird trap where like\nthe more you like her the more you care\nabout her\nyou have this thought that oh my god\nwe're going to break up i don't want to\nhurt her and the more you pull back\nwell if we're not breaking up we're\nspending the rest of our life together\nright\nthat's pretty scary what's scary about\nthat\ni don't know like things change so fast\nlike as a person\nas well like\nlike last year this time i didn't i\nwasn't even playing among us\nand now i've played the wrongness and\nit's\nalready ended and it was in the span of\nwhat nine months\ni i don't know what the future\nwill hold you know\nlike when when i think about divorces\nhonestly it's comforting\nbecause at the end of the day people get\ndivorces all the time right\nand i should be okay with breakup people\nbreak up all the time people get\ndivorced\nthat's why there's divorce lawyers it's\nso common\nthat there's a law specialization\ndedicated to divorces\num\nbut\ni think i would want to know that i am\ngoing to marry this person before i\nstart dating them\nwhich is almost impossible because you\nkind of make that decision once you're\nin a relationship with them\ni think it's a very good insight\nwhat would it mean if you knew ahead of\ntime that you were marrying someone\nwhat would that do for your mind\ni think it'd be a lot more comforting\nand\nwash away my anxiety\ni wish yeah like what would it wash away\nlike the idea that i'll be hurting\nsomeone\n[Music]\nlike i'm okay\nwith the idea of spending the rest of my\nlife with someone like that part isn't\nscary\nthe part that's scary is like it not\nworking out\nand you have to have the conversation of\na divorce or a breakup\nyeah so i i see that's where i think it\nmakes a lot of sense\ntoast i think i'm gonna once again\nkind of like i think there's a tricky\nthing right because when you've got one\nfoot out the door\npart of the reason sometimes the reason\nthat people have one foot out the door\nis so that they're not left in the room\nwhen the other person leaves\nand i'm i don't know if it's like bias\non my part but i'm hearing like this\ntheme of like uncertainty like among us\nwas everything nine months ago and like\ni can't count on it\nbeing there now\nand and i i think it's tricky because\nlike there's something else that i'm\ntranslating in my mind which is that you\ncare about other people and you don't\ncare about yourself\nso like there it is again where it's\nsort of like oh like you know my friends\ncome first other people come first i\ndon't want to hurt this person but like\nwhat\nwhat i think it's hard because what\nabout them hurting you\nand i think this is why like you know i\nasked you earlier would you let yourself\nfall in love with someone and you said\nno and that makes perfect sense to me\nbecause as long as you're not in love\nlike they're not going to leave you\nbehind you're not going to leave the\nnest one day\nwhen you talk about a fear of commitment\ni think it's i think it's weird\nit's not that you're wrong here i think\nit's just i'm sensing more than what\nyou're saying\nwhich is that i think you genuinely are\nlike a really good person\nand you try really hard to like protect\nyour friends\nand care about people that you love but\ni think like sometimes it's kind of hard\nbecause\ni don't think you let yourself feel the\nsame way about them that they do\nthat they feel about you because you are\na giga chad\nand so they do fall in love and then\nwhen you break up with them\nbecause you've had one foot out the door\nthe whole time and they get confused\nbecause they love you so much but they\ncan feel you pulling away\nand then you feel bad because you can\nsee it happening and you can see\nyourself\nnot being able to love them back and\nthen you like leave and then they feel\nhurt\nand then you're like oh my god it's\ngoing to happen again because i can't\nlet myself love and you're damn right\nit's going to happen again\nuntil you let yourself fall in love bro\nand that's going to be scary because if\nyou fall in love maybe you're going to\nbe in the room you're going to be\ndecorating you're going to be organizing\nyourself\nshelves and one day you're going to come\nhome and there's going to be no one\nthere\nhonestly i thought about this it's like\ni\nwish i sometimes secretly wish\ni was in that position\nafter of being the one who's being hurt\ni i think i would much rather\nhave a girl break up with me than me\nbreaking up with a girl because if the\ngirl broke up with me\nand i'm sad about it that means\nthat means that you know\nat least i cared a lot right\nand it also means i didn't have to be\nthe one\nyou like be the one hurting someone else\nyeah you're the one who's suffering\nyou're the one who's alone yeah because\nare you are you good at being alone\ntoast\nyeah i love being alone well not\nnot like love love but uh\nthere is some sense of comfort in being\nalone\nevery night has there been a period of\nyour\nlife where you felt very alone but\neven in a weird way sad but not sad\nmmm like sadness feels normal\n[Music]\num\ni don't think so not like\nsad sad but\nmore just irrelevant\nyeah sounds like ninth grade jeremy\nso i i know you're comfortable being\nthat like aside a relevant\nyou know is now i feel like i'm really\npushing you to accept what i'm saying so\nthat's a mistake but\ni just love it if you think about it i\nthink like irrelevant is such a good\nword\noh man it says so much right it's so so\nmuch about your ambitions your legacy\nthe mark that you want to make on the\nworld\nand i think this is where like i know\nit's like i'm barking up the wrong tree\nhere but\ni don't think you need to do anything\nelse to be relevant\ntoast and i know that's a good\nperplexing to you so that's fine we can\njust kind of agree to disagree there but\ni think what you've accomplished in this\nlife is enough\ni think you've had a very powerful\nimpact on a lot of individuals\nand you'll say that too but you won't\naccept it if i say it to you\nuh\ni feel like i haven't had the impact i\nwant\nbecause the gaming scene is so small\nlike\nit's true so it's it's growing but and\ni i want to be at the forefront of\nit um but\ni am not satisfied with what i've done\nyeah so i i i support you a hundred\npercent in wanting to do more\nif you feel like your work on this earth\nis not complete yet and that you have\nlike something\nmore that you need to offer the world\nthen by all means go for it\nlike seriously i i support you 100\ni sometimes worry that\nthat can come at the cost of yourself\nand i know you're willing to pay that\nprice i know that helping other people\nget brings you a lot of fulfillment so i\ndon't get the sense that you're like\nsacrificing every day oh my god it's so\nhard to be me\nyou know like you enjoy life like it's\ngood so i'm not saying it that way but\nyou know i think there's something to be\nsaid of of\nthere's accomplishing something and\nmaking the world a better place\nis a wonderful thing and\nthat doesn't that's not the only thing\nthat makes you relevant\nand that's where i think we diverge\nwhich is fine\nyou know i'm okay with that\nyou okay with that um\nyeah um i think it's just a streamer\nmindset\nlike i know like everyone has\nintrinsic self-worth but\ni just happen to like\nthrive in their industry that is\nvery\nnumbers based\nand uh yeah so here's here's what i'd\nkind of leave you with\num you know if you have additional\nquestions or anything let me know\ni'd say that if at some point you decide\nthat you want to better understand\nif you want to learn why you have one\nfoot in\nthe door and one foot out the door if\nyou want to work through some of those\nanxieties that you have at the beginning\nof the relationship i think that's\nsomething that\ncan be done i i don't know exactly what\nthe follow-up is there i'm i'm not\nsaying you\ni can do it for you i'm not saying that\nyou have to do it with me you can\ndefinitely do with anyone you can do it\nby yourself\nyou can do it with a friend but that's\nthe one thing that i can get behind you\nin terms of like you not having\nfulfilled your destiny yet and that\nyou're destined for something greater\n100\ni'm with you so be bigger do more\ngo outside of gaming i think it's like i\nthink you've got to do that i think it's\nyou're gifted and i don't know that\nanyone else can\ndo what you're supposed to do\nand at the same time if you're having\ntrouble in your romantic relationships\nif you find yourself crossing 30 and\nwondering maybe you do want to settle\ndown\nand you find yourself like recognizing\nthat you're looking for short-term\nthings but that there's a part of you\nthat may want longer-term things\nnow you've got to be careful because\nthere's a part of your mind that is\ngoing to tell you\nthat short-term things are better than\nlong-term things\nand if i had to give you one piece of\nadvice toast it would be\nbe careful about what's better for you\nand what you want\nand be careful about your mind\nconvincing you\nthat's that what is better for you is\nwhat you want\nbecause those are actually two different\nthings\nand as long as you believe as long as\nyou do what's better for you\ni don't think i think it's going to be\nreally hard for you to fall in love\nbecause love isn't better for you it's\n[ __ ] dumb\nit's foolish and it's dangerous and it's\nrisky and it can hurt you\nand it can hurt them\nbut you know sometimes you got to make\nthat deck that's all legendaries because\nit's not about making the best deck like\n[ __ ] the meta\nthat's about the memes\nmaybe maybe one day if i feel like\nwith like mental health and stuff\njust like coming on the show\nlike these conversation helped nudge me\nin the right direction\nbut at the end of the day the subject\nneeds to you know they gotta\nwant to like fix something about\nthemselves so like\nchange their way of thinking right yep\nso i apologized once for pushing you\nbecause i felt like i was leading\ninstead of following i'm happy to do it\nagain i think you're right\ni don't think you want to what i'm\nsaying is that if one day you change\nyour mind\nyou know and you're looking for some\nkind of support\nshoot me a dm just gotta send me a\nmessage i'm ready to love dr k\nuh yeah give it a give it a couple more\nyears\nlike i said once you cross 30 let me\nknow if you change your mind\nbecause i don't think there's anything\nwrong with what you're doing now for the\nrecord\ni think it's just if you decide that you\nwant to do things differently that can\nhave another conversation about it\nand i apologize for imposing my own\nvalue system it it took me a little\nwhile to figure out where you were\nwhere you are and that maybe where i\nwant you to be is like that's where i\nwant you to be but it's not where you\nare and it's not where you want to be\nwhich is like my mistake so i'm sorry\nfor that\nno no worries yeah i think uh\ni'm very stubborn like i am\nvery confident in the way i think\nsometimes to a fault like to a point of\nstubbornness\nand uh\nyeah oh probably it usually takes me\nlike\na while to slowly like\nthink about it from other angles\num but like conversation like this is\nreally helpful because it makes me think\nyou know let's maybe think about it from\nanother angle\njust even as a thought experimentation\nso yeah\nthink about love and relationships\na little more yeah one last thing is\nthink about do you have one foot out the\ndoor or do you only ever put one foot in\ni think you're right i do just put one\nfoot in\nyeah so it it\nall right so why won't you put put both\nfeet in\nuh just think about it\ntoo risky not to me but to the other\nperson\nyeah i mean this anyway maybe we can\nbecause then i i just\nlike i i want to wrap this up but it's\njust\ntoo juicy yeah you know you're baiting\nme into playing a twisting nether before\nyou like\ndo something else it's like that's what\ni feel like it's like\ni'm gonna spend all my entire turn eight\nmana to just wipe your board and it's\nlike\nso juicy\nthis was a good talk yeah man\nthank you very much um i you know i i\nhope that this ends up okay for you you\nknow if you have any kind of negative\nfallout or anything like that please let\nus know\num so far knock on wood hasn't happened\nyet but\nyou know sometimes people reveal things\npeople will troll them things like that\nwe'd love to help you clean up a mess\nthat we created\num and i'm sorry that i didn't quite\nlisten to you as well as i i could have\ni don't know i i felt like you did fine\nlike\ni think um part of like it's because\nit's hard to\njust like talk to a person and have like\nto try and figure out certain things off\nwhat you see online\nso um i mean it didn't feel like you\nsaid anything that\nwarrants any kind of uh second guesses\nor apologies\ni felt really comfortable okay\n[Music]\nyeah it was uh good times i like\ni like talking about\ndreamer life no so\ni mean it doesn't have to be like a dr k\nsession\nlike if you ever want to just\nhave me come on and talk about like the\nmindset of a streamer\nor whatever so i'm always very open to\nit\nsure sure i'm hearing it you i'm hearing\nyou say you're open to it\nbut i'm confused about whether there's\nan invitation there\nor not uh i mean\ni'm really lazy so\n[Music]\ni don't normally reach out but like if\nyou have\nbecause i don't know what other like\nsegments you do\nbut if you ever do a segment that needs\na streaming expert or uh\nanything that you think i would be a\ngood fit for\nthen yes i would be happy to come on and\ngive my two cents if you even want that\nnot that i'm inviting myself to\nspread my ingeniosity around\ni feel like this is another one foot in\nthe door one foot out the door kind of\nthing\ni just don't know what else you have\ngoing on no so but but here's\nhere's i i i'm honestly toast i'm just\nconfused\nso like do you think that we there's an\nimportant conversation that needs to be\nbecause i'm i'm i'm getting signals from\nyou but the words don't seem to be\nmatching up\nso are what i'm hearing from you is that\nthere are a lot of important things\nabout being a streamer which need to be\ntalked about\nis that correct yeah yes like\nstreamer problems like when some\nstreamers complain about oh yeah\ni read a bad comment in chat and make me\nreally sad\ni see them get like blackboard because\nit's like bro you're making money\nplaying video games why are you\nfocusing on one negative comment when\nthere's so much positive comments\nand like it just conditioned these\nstreamers to oh god better not complain\nabout anything then\num i like uh talking about those\nstuff okay because my friends go through\nit\nand okay sure yeah okay i i\ni understand now thank you for thank you\nvery much for explaining that\nand and i i'm also hearing you also\nthere's another message that i'm hearing\nin that\nis that this isn't going to be a\nconversation between dr k and jeremy\nthis is going to be a conversation\nbetween\ntwo streamers about mental health\nrelated stuff\nyeah yeah right it's a it's like\ncommentary about the industry as opposed\nto a personal conversation\nyeah uh 100 i feel like okay i got most\nof the things i want to talk about\nout with this session yep i'm hearing\nthe same thing\nthank you so much for clarifying yeah\ni'm totally down like i don't know what\nthat looks like or how that\nlooks but i'm totally interested in\ntalking\nabout the scene and the industry as well\num because i find it fascinating\nso yeah cool yeah well thanks for coming\non toast\num you know we'll i get that you're lazy\nand then you know we may we may reach\nout to you and then i don't know\nhow often we should reach out to you and\nthen i don't know how much time has\npassed before you feel bad\nreaching back out to us but you can you\nknow if we send you a message next week\nand you don't do anything about it for\nsix months\nfeel free to message us after six months\nno big deal\nand uh if we're hammer messaging you\njust like let us know and we'll back off\nso
