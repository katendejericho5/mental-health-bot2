    "transcript": "let's say you meet two people i haven't\nasked you about your sexuality or\nanything but i'm just gonna assume a\nheteronormative\nperspective for a second so let's say\nyou meet two guys and like\none of them genuinely cares about you\nand one of them is an [ __ ] who\npretends to care about you\nand the interesting thing that can\nhappen is that sometimes\nthe genuine caring actually makes you\nfeel so uncomfortable that you pull away\nfrom it\nand you kind of pick the devil that you\nknow welcome\nhello nice to meet you nice to meet you\ntoo\nand and so people call me all look or dr\nk can you\ntell me how you would like to be\naddressed today uh\ni'm nikki nikki okay yeah\nand um welcome nikki thank you so much\nfor\ngracing us with your presents thank you\nso much for inviting me\ni'm as much as i haven't watched too\nmany streams i am a fan i am really\nreally\num actually thankful for what you're\ndoing here\num so yeah well uh yeah so thank you\nvery much for coming on and\nand you know i appreciate the gratitude\nis there something in particular that\nyou want to talk about today or\nsomething that we can help you with\nnikki\num i'm not 100 sure\num perfect although\nalthough i did um start therapy today\nand we talked a bit of my about my\nanxiety yeah yeah\nso yeah started therapy today and\ncame on stream both in one day\ni know i know it's mental health\nawareness day\nmonth you know yeah wow good for you\nyeah and have you been in therapy before\ni have um i've been through therapy all\num my adolescence life so like ever\nsince i was\na young teenager i went through therapy\nokay yeah\ndo you mind if i ask you some questions\nabout that no for sure\nokay um you know just a reminder that if\ni ask you anything that you don't feel\ncomfortable answering you're\nwelcome to not answer it um but i think\na lot of people\nare curious about you know how to get\ninto therapy what it does for you things\nlike that can you\ntell us a little bit about what your\nexperience with therapy has been like\nfor sure um so i've been\ninto i was in psych wards that was the\nfirst experience i had when i was\nwith with therapy when i was very young\ni got admitted into a psych ward\nand that's how i started my first\ntherapy that's where i got diagnosed the\nfirst time and\nhow i started to how i started to work\nwith\nantidepressants and different kinds of\ntherapy\num and i actually went through dbt\ntwice um which really helped me\nyeah um can can you explain to us what\ndbt\nis um oh god what is it\ni'm not quite sure what it is in english\nbecause i did it in german\nbut it's basically um like\ni think it's behavioral therapy it's to\num um so\nit's it's basic it's like impulse\ncontrol i would say\num yeah i think your experience of it is\nperfect i i don't know that people need\nlike a technical definition but\ncan you just kind of tell us about what\nit's been like for you and\nso uh the first time i went through it i\ni thought it was\ni i didn't i i didn't quite you know i\nwasn't ready for it yet\num but it's it's basically they taught\nme how to\num i i did self harm when i was younger\nit's not it's not a secret you can say\nit\num i don't do it anymore um but they\ntaught me how to\nget that into like how to control that\nhow to\num kind of um like kind of learn\ndifferent\nthings that i can do instead of uh\nharming my body harming myself\nand we did a lot of i'm not quite sure\nwhat it is in english but we did\nquite a lot of like meditation and like\nbeing aware of your surroundings and of\nyourself\nuh which i think really helps and this\nis really good\nwhat is it in german um\nyeah yeah is there a way to literally\ntranslate that\nlike awareness like awareness practice\ni would say beautiful that's yeah that's\nthat's a that's a beautiful way to\ndescribe it\ndescribe what it is um and feel free to\njust use the german word if you can't\ncome up with anywhere\nokay okay yeah i you know\nso it's funny because a lot of people um\nso\nearly on when i was training to become a\npsychiatrist i had a patient whose\nenglish was not their first language and\neveryone just sort of assumed that that\nwould mean that the therapy wouldn't go\nwell\nbut i actually found that um that was\nactually like one of my\nbest sort of therapy experiences because\nuh since we didn't speak the same\nlanguage like we didn't assume\nanything so we were like defining terms\nthat like\nnormally you know i would say oh like\nhow was your childhood and someone would\nsay good\nand then we just moved past it even\nthough it may not have been good or i\ninterpreted things one way\nand so i actually think working with\npeople who don't speak your language or\nlike you guys just have a little bit of\na\nyou know language gap can actually be\nreally really good\num because you don't fall into\nassumptions yeah no i think i think\nthat's a really good way to see it\num so yeah because i also love the way\nthat you\nyou translated\nyeah good job good job\nthank you thank you\num and so so how how does\nwhat did they teach you that helped you\ncontrol your impulses\num i think\ni think for me it was mostly i\nneed it wasn't it wasn't mostly about\nmy impulses it was most mostly about\nneeding like something that i can rely\non\nbecause growing up i didn't have that\nmuch how i have it that much\nand therapy actually helped me um in a\nway where it's like hey\nif you ever need something and you don't\nknow where to go\nyou have the therapy that you can go to\nif you don't know who to talk to you\nhave your therapist you can talk to\num in the psych ward i had people to\ntake care of me\ni think that was a big thing i'm very\nbad with\nlike looking for help because i always\ni'm like i'm so self-aware i know what\ni'm doing i can do this by myself\nso even like going to therapy now it's\nlike it's a very big step um\nbut i think i need it where where like i\nneed something to rely on and i need\nsomething to fall back on\nand that's i think that's what therapy\nwas for me and what helped me\nyeah so sort of like a like a home base\nor\nkind of retreat or yeah can you tell me\na little bit about what growing up was\nlike for you\num i moved a lot ever since i was young\ni moved every half a year\num i also grew up with all the f without\na father\num my mom i i\nthere is addiction running in my family\nand my mom sadly suffered from it from\nfor the most part\num which i back then didn't understand\num and it was sort of like uh\ni got thrown into new situations and\nthen pulled out of it without\nme having a saying in it and then and\nthen\num not knowing where to go or what to do\num\nand then once i moved out at 17 i had to\ngrow up really early because i had to\ntake care of my mom\num so i wow yeah i kind of just\ni kind of just uh started to be more\nindependent and that really helped me\nstreaming really helped me i was a very\ninsecure kid\ni was very shy and very very um\nquiet growing up so\nyeah streaming helped me a lot moving\nout by myself helped me a lot because i\nhad that distance\nfrom my from my child like childhood\nfrom my family\nand that helped me understand everything\nthat\ni didn't understand when i was younger\nand what are some of the things that you\ngained understanding about\nlike what did you come to understand\nthat was confusing as a kid\ni for example saw the sight of my mom\nmy mom always struggled with her current\nboyfriends with her ex-boyfriends\nwith money we didn't have much money\ngrowing up\num and i sort of started to understand\nthat\nas my like as much as addiction is and\ncan be seen as an illness it's not her\nfault\nshe did not mean to treat me the way\nthat she wanted to she maybe just didn't\nknow any better\num and i actually really really love my\nmom now and\nwe're really like like tight and and\ngood with each other so yeah yeah\nand and why did you move every six\nmonths\num mostly uh so there's one thing that i\ncan't talk about on the internet which\ni'm sure which i can't tell\num but mostly it was because of my mom\nand her boyfriend she always moved to\nher boyfriend's because she didn't have\nmoney\num but my mom is a very pretty woman and\nso she got to date\nmen that are rich i don't know\nyeah um so we always moved to them\nreally quickly\nand it really quickly didn't work out so\nwe had to move away\nokay yeah um thanks for sharing that\nthere's something that you know we want\nto steer clear of\ni'm still not quite sure what to avoid\nso i may need your guidance\ni'm not trying to ignore i just don't\nknow what it is that we can't talk about\nquite yet so apologies if i stumble\ntowards it\nokay just let me know yeah of course of\ncourse\nand and so you mentioned that you didn't\ngrow up\nkind of knowing your father is that\nsomething that's still the case or\nit sounds like you've really repaired\nyour relationship with your mom you all\nbecome really close you all love each\nother support each other a lot\num do you mind if i just ask quickly\nlike if that\noh yeah um i i had a father figure\nwhen i was very young um but very\nquickly\nthat turned that's what i can talk about\num\nyeah and then i found out that he's not\nmy father when i was nine years old\num and my real father actually\nhe knows me like he my mom showed him my\ntwitch he knows\nnia um but i have never known him and he\nalways said that i'm not his daughter\nuntil we did a father\nlike a test like that he's my father\num but yeah he he's not in my life\ni don't i don't really mind it either\nthough\nyeah i i can i can see how you know it's\nsort of like\nyou know never sort of he was never in\nyour life to begin with so it's not like\nyou lost anything\nyeah exactly at the same time i can\nimagine that\nyou know it can it may be hurtful\nfor him to say things like you're not it\nwas at first\ndefinitely i i definitely at first was\nvery hurtful\num but i got over it very quickly\nyeah do you mind if i ask how you did\nthat because that does seem remarkable\ni i i feel like i i don't want to blame\nit on that but i feel like because i've\nmoved so many times because i've dealt\nwith\ngetting over people losing people\ngetting thrown away like\nthrown out of the situation um i feel\nlike because of that i've gotten\nreally really good at just getting over\npeople in general\nlike as much as i am hurt for the first\nfew days or for the first\nfor the first time i i quickly move on\nfrom that\ni just yeah\num nikki you seem just\nincredibly resilient\nthank you and i almost feel a little bit\nsad saying that because i think it's\nbeen rough that you've had to be so\nresilient\nyou know i sometimes wish that people\nhad lives where they didn't have to be\nquite as resilient and bounce back quite\nas much as you had to\nit sounds kind of rough um\nit makes me the person i am today i um i\nactually want to become a psychiatrist\num so i feel like because of all the\nthings that i have\num that i've been through i don't want\nto say like oh i've been through so much\nbut like all of the things that i have\nbeen through\nuh because of that\nyeah i um i learned how to um i\nhave a lot of empathy and i i i know how\na lot of people feel\nand also i am pretty resilient so if\nsomeone tells me that i i take it in but\nit's not like weighing on me so much\ncan you help me understand um you\nwanting to become a psychiatrist\nwhy on earth um\nsave yourself nikki before it's too late\ni just want to help people um at first i\nwanted to become a psychiatrist\nin a children's and adolescence psych\nward because that's what i've been\nthrough and i think that helped me a lot\num but the more i am here as a streamer\nand content creator i feel like a lot of\ncontent creators could really use\num some professional help so i would\nreally like to\nto do something in in this area as a\nprofessional\nmental health professional and um\nokay look can i just think for a second\nyeah for sure\ni'm trying to understand the boundaries\nof this conversation and\nand i'm trying to mostly very open i am\nfine with talking about\num mental health about my issues i talk\nabout it a lot on my own stream\num if there's anything that i don't want\nto talk about\ni will tell you and i won't feel\noffended or anything so\ndon't worry at all yeah that i figured\nout\nthe boundaries that i i need a moment to\nthink about are my own\noh okay oh okay i'm sorry\nso there's there's all part you know\nthere i'm having all these thoughts\nabout supporting you in your goal like\nin terms of\nyou know you know how can we\nyou know what because i love to support\nyou but i i think that that's not really\nthe relationship that we have\nin terms of of you know if you want to\ntalk to people\nor want research opportunities or\nwhatever which we just talked about a\nlittle bit\num you know i know a lot of people in a\nlot of places\nand and i think you'd be a wonderful fit\njust having talked to you for five or\nten minutes\nin in a lot of the clinical settings\ni've seen and so there's a part of me\nthat\nvery strongly wants to support you in a\nvery like much more like practical way\nlike i want to\nintroduce you to you know are\nlike the person who runs the adolescent\num you know i'm going to steer clear of\na particular diagnosis\nbut there's a there's a particular uh\nyou know residential unit where people\nwill come and stay for 30 or 60 days\nmost of them are women\nthey teach a lot of dbt there and and i\nthink that that could be like a really\nwonderful place for you to\nwork clinically if you ever became a\npsychiatrist so i'm personally just\nrestraining all of that energy to try to\nsupport you and your goal\num and just thinking about what's\nappropriate and what isn't to say\ni see i see it and so like\nso help me understand a little bit so i\nmean i hear this a lot from streamers\ntoo because you know we work with a lot\nof\nstreamers here at hg um and so you're a\nstreamer\nyou're a good streamer you're a\nsuccessful streamer\nand and how do you how do you think\nabout\nyou know potentially becoming like a\nlicensed mental health professional\nversus like your streaming career\num so i i never intended\nto become a big streamer um i don't\nthink\nmany people do i don't think many people\nstart and are like oh i'm going to be\nthis big streamer\nso it has always been my goal and my\ndream to become a psychiatrist\nand i will not just throw that away just\nbecause i have a different career path\nnow\num i feel like as much as streaming is a\nwonderful job and i would love to do it\nforever\nit is not a secure job that that you\nknow you can do forever\nso i think i will just do streaming for\nas long as i can for as long as i have\nfun\nfor as long as it's you know i can pay\nmy rent with it and i can pay my uni and\neverything with it\num but i i feel like\nat some point everyone just falls off\num so or most people so\num and like i will i will still work\ntowards\nmy plan a which is psychiatrist um\neven though i but i will not i don't\nknow i really know how to say it but\nlike i will not give up streaming\num but i will still work towards\nbecoming a psychiatrist because you\nnever know\ni could go live today and have zero\nviewers\nso yeah um\nyou know i know this sounds weird but\nyou may be able to become a psychiatrist\nand a streamer\nit is actually possible which i didn't\ni i didn't i didn't realize you know i i\ndon't i don't know how true that was\nmaybe a year or two ago but it appears\nto be true now\nyeah yeah you're right\nso and so it sounds like you're in uni\nyou're doing\nuh i took this year off because of covet\ni just couldn't handle it totally\nbut uh after like once everything comes\ndown\ni will definitely go go back to uni yeah\ni wasn't here once i just start again\nand do you nikki do you mind if i ask\njust estimate of how old you are\ni'm 19. oh wow okay\nyeah how long have you been streaming\ntwo years oh wow\nit's been my job for one year now you\nseem\nolder i hear that a lot yeah\nhow do you how do you interpret that\nwhen people say things like that\num i agree because i had to grow up very\nvery quickly\nso and i have very i have a lot of\nfriends that are\nin their early mid to late 20s\nso i don't i don't have many friends\nthat are in like 18 19\n18 19 17 18 19. so i think\num yeah i think i think that makes sense\nyeah it's sad that you had to grow up\nearly\n[Laughter]\nyeah but it made me the person i am\ntoday and i'm actually as much as i\nstill struggle with myself\num pretty happy with who i am and who\nare you\num i'm nikki i am here to help people\nand make people laugh and smile and as\nlong as i can do that i'm happy\ni did a lot of um volunteering growing\nup\nand that's definitely also what i want\nto do continuing on\ni couldn't do it during culvert but yeah\nyeah this may sound like a weird\nquestion why is it important to you to\nmake people happy\ni think because i know what it feels\nlike to be at your lowest\nand i don't i don't wish that upon\nanyone not even my\nenemies i don't have anyways but the\npeople that i don't like i just don't\nwant\ni just yeah\nyou know i'm really curious who has\nenemies nowadays\ni don't know yeah i know right it's like\ni mean i'm sure they're out there but\ni'm sure some people do and i\nyou know right i yeah i have people i\ndon't like and people\nwho don't like me but we're not enemies\ni'm not making\nanything to to make their life miserable\nor anything\nand and you said that you you enjoy\nmaking people happy because you know\nwhat it's like\nto be unhappy can you tell us a little\nbit more about that\num i don't know i\ni just had a lot of\nbad experiences in my life i would say\nlike i'm not i always whenever i do this\num i i'm like oh i'm just i'm just\ntrying to talk about myself and i come\noff as oh i'm just talking about myself\nhere and making myself feel\nseem i don't know i don't like talking\nabout myself in that way much i don't\nlike\ntelling people that i've had bad\nexperiences in my life but i definitely\ndid and i definitely\num had\ni don't know just very low points\nyeah yeah it's time for me to talk about\nthat\nyeah how do how do you why is it hard\nfor you to talk about that\ni don't know maybe because i\num i am not at a position\nright now where\nmy life's good i don't have to you know\nas much as i still have a lot of\nstruggles\nand especially with myself i\nam financially stable and i am doing a\njob that i love and i\nhave many friends and and and out of\nthat\nthat i feel like i am not allowed to\ntalk about the bad times in my life\nbecause it's\nyou know it's not like that anymore so\nwhy should i talk about it\num so i i think i think that's what\nmakes me struggle\ncan i think for a second for sure\nso nikki i think you know it's it's\ni really enjoy talking to you i think\nwe're having a very lovely conversation\num i think it could help a lot of people\nto hear your story and at the same time\ni'm not hearing anything that we're\ntalking about that will actually be\nhelpful to you\nyeah and and something very\nsneaky is happening which is that you're\nyou're\ncoming on here and you're helping other\npeople\nyou're sharing your experiences for the\nsake of\neducating other people but we're not\nwe're really steering away from\nanything that could be helpful to you\ndoes that make sense\nyes that makes sense okay so you're\nyou're a sneaky one so let's think a\nlittle bit about that for a second\nokay we can we can respect that boundary\nright if you don't want to talk about\nthings that could help you and i think\nby the way there's a theme running here\nwhich is that you don't like reaching\nout for help\nyou don't like showing people and now\neverything's better there's that\nright yeah yeah so so\nbut we can we can actually choose to\nrespect that right like we can just\nacknowledge that that thing is there\nthat you\ndon't want you don't want us to throw\nyou a pity party\nright yeah you don't want us to like\nthink like oh like\nnikki's had like such a hard time\nexactly\nlike you're happy sharing your your\nstory of triumph like yeah it was really\nhard but\nyou can do it too like you're happy\nsaying that you're having\nan inspiration if it helps other people\nbut yeah\nyou don't want us to be worried about\nyou exactly\n100 yeah right which is fine\nif we decide that so i'm i see you're\ngetting emotional i've maybe\ntaught you a little bit sorry but you\nare\nso you are so incredibly self-aware\nnikki you understand yourself so well\nyou've grown so much\nso i'm just i'm putting it out there\nnormally i'd like skirt around it i\nwon't you know i wouldn't like pin you\nlike i feel like i've\ntrapped you so that's all right so how\nwhat do you think about that like um\nno i i do agree um i do agree with that\nespecially\nthe oh i don't we don't want to throw\nyou a pity party because\num i do get babied on the internet a lot\num where it's like oh poor nikki and\noh she's she's she's doing this and but\nfor her\nwell um well i'm sitting here and i'm\nlike yeah but\nit's all right like you know i\ni'm fine so i feel like i feel like\nif i if i would talk about how right now\ni struggle with a lot of anxiety which\nis true\ni feel like people would then again be\nlike oh poor her\ni hope she's okay which is fair enough\nbut i i don't want that\nlike i want to be here for my chat and i\nwant to make my chat laugh\nthey don't have to be there for me\nbecause i am just their source of\nentertainment\ncan i think for a second yes\ni'm gonna need a long second maybe like\na minute that's okay\ni'm so sorry no no no it's it's not i\ni think so i need to think more when\npeople\nare more insightful because usually like\nif people are slow\nwith how how they progress it gives me\nplenty of time i mean not like people\nare slow but like\nthe more insightful you are the more i\nhave to like take a step back and\nyou know just hold on okay\nokay\nsubtle there's a lot going on here\nthat's okay i'm\nokay i'm i'm here okay so the first\nthing is that\ni think i i want to kind of toss\nsomething out to you\nmaybe you can help me think through it\nso\none is that people baby you right i\nthink that can be insulting and\ndemeaning\nbut i would suspect that when you get\nbabied there's a\nwhen there's a subtle difference between\npeople\nbabying you and caring about you\nand i i think that you probably dislike\nboth\nyeah probably and one of those is fair\nright because we don't want a baby\nwe don't want to we don't want to like\nsay like oh like oh nikki does it like\npoor thing she's so hurt she's so\nincapable of\nno because you're very capable yeah\nexactly\nfinancially independent at the age of 19\nin university\nhave career aspirations you you spawned\nin a really really\nbad location when you were born on this\nearth\nand with a lot of challenges and despite\nthis the fact that you had like a crappy\nspawn\nyou have managed to accomplish at the\nage of 19 just a ridiculous amount\nand we're just getting started so i\nthink that babying you is not fair\nyeah i agree at the same time\ni think that you don't it makes you\nuncomfortable when people\nchoose to care about you\ni agree what's up with that um\nmaybe maybe i'm just not\nused to i don't want to again oh you're\njust not used to\npeople caring about me there's that\nvoice you see that voice yeah i know\num but yeah i i have an example for\nexample\nan example for example um i i'm in this\ngroup\nin this friend group and um\nthey are streamers they're all streamers\nall content creators and they\ntalk over me a lot and it's a thing it's\nit's a thing um and\ni've recently gotten into this into like\ni talked to like two of the people or\nthree other people and then they\nthey suddenly let me talk and as much as\ni was always like oh i wish i could talk\ni wish i could say my mind\noh you know um once i actually could\ni didn't know what to say because i was\nso used to being talked over\nand not finishing my sentences not being\nheard that once i actually got heard\nonce people actually listened to me i\ndid not know what to say\nand i think that is the same thing with\npeople caring about me\nwhere it's like as much as i always\nwanted it and as much as i always\nwanted to feel safe and feel secure and\nhave people care about me\nnow that i have people care about me i\njust don't know what to do with it\nyeah beautifully said and\nwhat i'm hearing from you is that it's\nsad but you sort of didn't learn\nhow to be cared for\nand and so i think what i'm hearing from\nyou is that you've really like\nadapted to surviving on your own\nyou know because like you don't need\nother people to take care of you because\nthat voice in your head doesn't\nyeah it's always [ __ ] up yeah\nit really is yeah interesting huh\ncan you tell us about that voice in your\nhead\noh that voice it does not like me\nit does not want me to succeed um\nand i think it helps me to be more\nself-aware but at the same time it just\nmakes me sound hypocritical a lot of the\ntimes\nyeah so what kinds of things does it say\nto you\num i think\nit started i had an eating disorder\nthroughout\nmy entire life my mom's a model so she\nkind of\nput that down on me and that voice\nstarted\nwhen i was very young and at first it\nwas just the thing it repeated the\nthings that\npeople in school told me that my mom\nshowed me um\nit it repeated my own insecurities\nand the older i got the more it just\nrepeated\num it kind of just\nmade me feel like i don't deserve\ngood things happening to me you know\nyep so let me ask you a weird question\ndoes the voice help your success\nor hinder your success that's the\nquestion\ni don't know and certain things i would\nsay\ndefinitely it hinders it on the surface\ni would say it hinders it but\non the other hand i think i\ni need to i need that voice to tell\nmyself i can overcome it\ni think i think i just constantly need\nthat challenge of something else\nworking against me and working against\nwhat i want\nso i yeah\nif that makes sense makes a lot of sense\nand now i'm gonna\nbecause this is the thing nikki you make\ntoo much sense\nright so i asked you the hard question\nwhich usually it takes us an\nhour and a half to get to oh actually\nthe voice isn't all bad\nbut you get there right away so i i need\nto\ni feel like it's a therapy um a little\nbit i know the normal\none so like you know i feel like i'm i'm\nlike in an anime where like we've caught\nup with the manga and now i need to make\nfiller\nand right it's quite a sneak to pause\nfor a second because this is gonna be a\nfiller\ni'm sorry no no no it's it's on the\ncontrary so\num\nman you understand so much\nthank you\nokay how would you feel if chat\ncared about you\ni would feel\nat one point at one hand i would feel\num like thankful and i would be like\nthat's very sweet that's very nice\nand on the other hand i would feel like\nthat's not your place to be\nand then on the other hand i would\nprobably feel like\nplease don't okay\nso we're gonna pay attention to on one\nhand and on the other hand okay any time\nyou say that or anytime you think that\nso for example the voice in your head\ndoes it help your success or hinder your\nsuccess\non the one hand it's toxic and on the\nother hand it's a challenge that drives\nme forward\nyeah right so yeah\nso and when we go back to chat and when\nwe ask like you know\ndo they how would you feel about them\ncaring about you like there's a part of\nyou that can feel\ngratitude there's a part of you that\nsays\nno no it works the other way around\nand yeah what's that third part of you\num\nlike it's not their place to be\nlike they have their own\nthings to care about i guess maybe yeah\nso whose place is it to care about you\num my friends\nand my family\nthat's a good answer is that actually\nhow you feel\nyeah i think i mean\ni guess chad that's a very hard question\ni i do feel thankful that chad cares\nabout me\nof course i do i i love my audience my\naudience is the sweetest audience\nyeah yeah um\nbut maybe maybe they should care about\nme in a different way than my friends\nand family should care about me because\nwe we didn't establish the word care\nwhat is the word care what does the word\ncare say\nand intel i think it's like chat should\ncare about me in a way of\noh is nikki happy doing the work that\nshe does is nikki have been\nhappy providing us with the content that\nshe that she does is she\nsafe and happy no no safe and healthy\nlike\nthose things but they can't actually\nchange much about it as\nlike like i said i'm very happy with my\naudience and that is because\nthey act the way that they do and i\nthink\ni think if they care about me in a way\nof i want to make this community safe\nbecause i care about my streamer\nthen i'm very happy and i think that's\nwhat they should do\nbut they should not care about me on a\npersonal level where they will\nreach out to me on my business email and\nask me if i am okay and if i want to\ntalk to them because that is not their\nplace to be\nyeah so that sounds like very good\nboundaries so now i'm gonna ask you\ndo you sometimes find yourself\num well said\nno i'm gonna have to pause\nthis is gonna be the stream that we call\nthe battle of pauses\nand i think you're winning right now the\nscore is like eight to one\nokay so how\nhow do you feel about yourself when\nyou're making your chat happy\ni feel good about myself i\nif when when i have a good stream where\ni see that my chat is having fun\ni call that a successful stream and a\ngood stream\nokay seems like\ngive me a second that's totally fine i'm\nso sorry i feel so bad\nwhy because you keep having to pause\nso what's why do you feel bad about that\ni'm not sure\ni don't know what would make you feel\ngood\nthat's a hard question\num i don't know\ni'm i'm happy to be here i feel good to\nbe here\ni'm very thankful that i got invited to\nthis i\ni am too i'm i'm i'm doing well right\nnow\nare you concerned that i'm not doing\nwell yeah\nyeah and so when you get concerned that\ni'm not doing well how does that make\nyou feel\nnot not well yeah right because you're\nnot\nmaybe you're not making me happy and\nwhen you don't make me happy how do you\nhow do you feel unhappy\nlike like guys like i didn't succeed\nyeah\nwhat does it feel like to not succeed\nlike that voice that told me i won't\nwill\nwill be louder yeah absolutely and\nremind me of that\nso the voice is telling you oh you\nshouldn't be this difficult you should\nbe simpler\nexactly and you should let dr k work you\nto a revelation\nand that everybody can watch the\nrevelation and then you can have\nyou can cry and you can have learned\nsomething new about yourself\nand that it's going to be exactly what\nit's supposed to be everyone will be\nhappy\nexactly but the voice telling you no no\ndon't\ndon't disrupt the boat right so\nso\ni think i'm gonna stop asking you some\nquestions and i'm just gonna tell you\nokay so like but so nikki that's a\nproblem\nright because you've got to be really\nreally careful about\noh i don't even know how to say this um\ndo you see how that's a problem\ni do see how that's help us out\num i have learned especially in the last\nyear and a half that that is a problem\nbecause\ni have met certain people that told me\none thing and i would believe that thing\nand i would adapt to that thing\nand then they would act a different way\nand i would try to\nact that way and adapt to that way but\nin the end i could not\nbecause i couldn't steer the boat and\nthe die in the correct direction\num because i didn't get any directions\num\nand because i constantly need to\num from from my end i need to succeed i\nneed to\nbe i don't know i i don't\nknow how to explain it but i feel like\ni feel like i see myself as something\nthat\neveryone can fall back on i will adapt\nmyself to everyone and everything around\nme\nwhether or not it's beneficial or good\nfor me\num and because i\nget these different directions and no\ndirections at all\ni feel very very lost a lot of the times\nyeah so now we're going to come back to\nanother question or a question that\nwe've asked before\nso who are you\nwow um\num i am\n[Music]\ni'm still nicki you're damn right you\nare\ni i still am a person with ambitions and\num goals in life and who is independent\nby themselves\num i just maybe sometimes um\ntry to adapt myself too much\nto other people\nwell set so now we get into a tricky\nsituation because\nas as you give the right answers\nand i said as i say things like well\nsaid\nthat may calm down the voice do you see\nthat yeah\nyeah because now you're being vulnerable\nenough like oh like that's a hard\nquestion like\noh dr k yeah and then and like so the\nmore that you like struggle like the\nmore the voice is like\ngood job nikki you're being what they\nwant you to be\nright and so this is tricky because like\nlike you said\nyou know you adapt yourself a little bit\ntoo much you're very good you're a\nchameleon\nyou can be what people need you to be\nand and this is the tricky thing is that\nlike you know when you're like i think\nthat there's a lot of genuineness but\nthere's like\na lot of um dialectic actually\nso so the the d and dbt stands for\ndialectical\nand and what dialectical means i think\nyou understand\nit very well i mean it's clear so the\ndialectic is like the two\nsides of the argument so on the one hand\ni'm nikki\nand on the other hand i actually am a\nlittle bit confused about who i am at\ntimes\nand and or maybe another way to put it i\nthink as you have started to learn who\nyou are\nis i give up who i am for what people\nwant me to be\nand and so like i think that that's\nchallenging\num\nany thoughts i agree\nyeah i think i think that sounds\nvery accurate yeah so so\ni i this is going to sound kind of weird\nbut you know the voice in your head\nwhen other people tell you the same\nthing that the voice in your head tells\nyou how do you respond to that\nyeah you're right i um\ni have learned oh sorry um i have\nlearned\ngrowing up and going through therapy\ni've learned how to take compliments i\nwe\nhad a whole therapy session group\nsession about how to\ntake compliments so whenever someone\ngives me a compliment i say thank you\ni yeah that's really nice of you um but\nit\nit is only when someone says something\nnegative about me that i actually take\nit in\nand i i\nprocess it and it actually reaches me\ni think that's that's why it's very hard\nto be a streamer because i do see a lot\nof negative things\nyeah so so i and i think this is where\nmaybe you know maybe we can try to like\ni'd like to help you swim in the water\nof like why you do that right so like\nyou've got this negative voice in you\npart of it\nyou know feels like it's like hurts you\nbecause it does hurt you and at the same\ntime it also like\nhelps you succeed right and and so then\nthere\nare times where you know i think that\nlike you have to be careful\ni mean we haven't talked about your\nromantic relationships but i think\nsometimes\npeople for whom negativity resonates\nwith them\ncan open themselves up to abusive\nrelationships\nor abusive dynamics and we can kind of\nhear this a little bit because you had\nthat group of friends that always talked\nover you\nand you're like resenting it on the one\nhand but it feels right\non the other and then you've got like\nthese two or three people who actually\ngive you the space to speak\nand that's what you've always wanted and\nyou're really uncomfortable\nand this is the dialectic it's like i\nwant to speak\nbut boy does it feel good when i get\ntalked over because then your voice is\nlike you see that he's\nyou don't have anything good to say\nanyway exactly you don't know how to\ntalk\nanyways yeah yeah so it's kind of tricky\nand so then the question becomes like\nwhat\nwhat makes you like and then when people\ncompliment you\ni think this is tricky so i know you had\na therapy session where you learned how\nto act\nhow to accept a compliment you practice\nacting\nyou don't actually accept it what gets\nin the way\ni\nprobably that voice not wanting me to\nsucceed not wanting me to feel good\nabout myself and feel good about\nthings that people compliment me on\nyeah and and what's your understanding\nof why your voice\ndoesn't want you to feel good what is it\ndoing there why is it doing that\nit's trying to keep me in the place\nwhere i have been for the majority of my\nlife because that's\ncomforting because that is the safety\nnet that i\nthat i have i um\ni fall and like when we talk about\nromantic relationships i fall in love\nwith people who make me feel safe\num and that might be me trying to get\nout of that place that the voice is\nkeeping me in that safety net\num but that also like you said opens me\nup to a lot of abusive relationships\nbecause that is then the safety net that\ni try to fall back on\num and a lot of the times it doesn't\nwork out um\nso i think i think that is what the\nvoice is doing it's trying to keep me in\nthat place where i have been\nmy entire life where it is easy to stay\nbecause i don't have to work\nto get out of it well said\nso so here's here's what i kind of heard\nso i think i know it sounds\nweird but i think the voice is\nprotecting you\nright and this is is actually like\ndevastating but\nit happens to be true that you have\nsurvived abuse and neglect\nand like there's a very interesting\nadaptation\nto like surviving abuse and neglect\nwhich is like this idea that\nyou don't deserve any better because\nthen at least it makes sense right\nif i'm like fundamentally oh you want to\nfinish\nyeah like human beings try to make sense\nof everything\neverything we need to we need to make\nsense of it so\ni totally agree i've heard that a lot of\ntimes i've learned that while i did\npsychology myself\ni know that that is the thing i i need\nto make sense of it why did i get abused\nwhy did i get neglected what\nwhat made me like what made people want\nto do that to me\nand the thing that that voice tells me\nit's\nbecause you deserve it because whatever\nyou did you deserve it\nand i say okay right that makes sense i\ndeserve it\num yeah yeah so i'm gonna point\nsomething out i think we're gonna skirt\nclose to the area that we're not going\nto talk about\nso you don't have to talk about it but\ni'm just going to illustrate something\nright so if we go back to like\nearly on and if you can share something\ni think it could be illustrative but\nit's enough for you to just think it you\ndon't actually have to answer my\nquestion\ni forgot what i was going to say with\nthat oh no\nokay so so\nwhen you're growing up and you're moving\naround a lot and things are bad\nright your mind comes up with like\nsome kind of way to help you survive\nthat right and you so you come up with\nlike this adaptation\nand then the interesting thing is that\nlike that adaptation makes sense like\nit's sort of like your mind comes up\nwith this idea and there's\ninteresting stuff about cognitive\ndevelopment stuff that we can talk about\nbut\nessentially your mind like comes up with\na formula for the way that the world\nworks you have to make sense of the way\nthe world works\nand to grow up the way that you did the\nonly logical conclusion that a smart\ninsightful person like yourself can come\nto\nis that you don't deserve to be treated\nwell\nbecause clearly you know\nyou had lots of data to suggest that you\ndon't deserve to be treated well\nand then something really important\nhappens which is that voice in your head\nsays that you know what as long as you\ndon't deserve to be treated well and\nwe're all on the same page\nas long as we know the final boss that\nwe're dealing with we can win\nwe can survive you're completely okay if\nyou don't rely on anyone else if no one\ncares about you\ni can take care of you i will protect\nyou i will make you succeed\ni will help you become a psychiatrist\nthat transforms and enriches the lives\nof many many people\nand it's going to be a shell that you\nshow the rest of the world and i'm going\nto be with you on the inside and we're\nnot going to let anyone else in\n[Music]\nand so it can become terrifying because\nthat's it's a safety net i think you\nused a beautiful phrase there\nand now things get really really\ndangerous because\nif people start to care about you and\nyou\nlet them in what does that say about you\nthat i'm vulnerable\nsure that i i think i think that is also\nlike a\nbig thing i have tried to let people in\nand then\nthat trust that i've gave given that\npeople got abused\nso then the voice gets louder um\nand tells me to see see that's that's\nwhy you shouldn't trust people that's\nwhy\nwe are in here you and me but everyone\nelse is out there\num yeah so now i'm going to say\nsomething this may not make a whole lot\nof sense\ni think the thing you've got to be\nreally careful about nikki is i think\nthat\nvoice knows how to pick the right people\nto let them in and convince you\nthat i i was right all along i agree\n100 my mom has the same issue well yeah\nmy mom and i actually talked about that\na lot i agree can you can you help us\nunderstand\nthat a little bit because i know we know\nwhat we're talking about i'm not sure\nthat everyone can follow\num so i think it is\nso people in your life as a person that\nhas met many people in their lives\nuh growing up and moving a lot um\nhave certain patterns of how to get to\nknow you\nhow to talk to you what their hobbies\nare\nthe way they approach other people\nand i think i don't do it\nconsciously but subconsciously i see\nthose patterns and i take\nthe toxic patterns and i blend them out\nthey're not there for me\nbut subconsciously i know that these are\ntoxic patterns and\nthese patterns will hurt me um but\ni will still i because i don't see them\nconsciously\ni will let these people in and then once\ni get hurt by them\non one hand i'm surprised and i tell\nmyself why did i deserve that and on the\nother hand i tell myself\nyeah but these you you you knew that you\nyou knew that that was\nthat was what you wanted that that was\nwhat you what you needed\ni guess yeah it's it's tricky right\nbecause i i think there's a part of it\nbecause like\nnikki you are very you will be a very\ngood psychiatrist if you'd be\nthank you so i think you're really good\nat reading people\nand i think you're really good at like\nknowing what they are and what they're\ngoing to give you and i think there's a\npart of you that\nnow we're really getting into\nhypothetical territory but i'd say that\nthere's a part of you that\nsees all of the stuff on the surface\nthat you want from those people\nand also detects like everything\nunderneath the surface\nand it also reassures you because it\nsays hey look at all this beautiful\nstuff on the surface\nthis person is going to be the right\nperson for you and then underneath\nthey know that that person is going to\nmake you\nfeel about yourself the way that you\nsometimes do when you listen to that\nvoice\nyeah definitely it's hard\nso now we get to\nyeah so let me just let me think for a\nsecond\ndo you do you have a sense of how to\nchange this\num i mean like i said trying to let\npeople in as much as i will\ni know i will get hurt in the future um\ntrying to let people in trying to\nlet people understand me and my\nvulnerabilities\num yeah i'm not sure\nyeah so so i think that's that's a good\nthat's a good strategy\ni think it could be bumpy mm-hmm um so\nwhat\nas everything is as as every recovery\nprocess\nis well said also very resilient of you\nso\nbut you know nikki i i'd actually prefer\nif it's okay with you to try to like\nlead you down a path now that's a little\nbit different\nyeah for sure and the thing is uh trying\nstuff i don't think is actually your\nstrong suit\ni i think you're very insightful and so\nwhat i'd love to do is actually try to\nleverage\nyour ability to understand your capacity\nfor awareness\nand actually it has nothing to do with\nanything outside of you\nit has everything to do with what goes\non inside you\nso the first thing is that recognize\nthat the voice in your head\nis what his is your survivor\nright like you've you've you are a\nsurvivor\nand and i think the really terrifying\nthing is that like\nyou have concluded that you're not like\na good person on the inside\nnow i know that you don't there are\nparts of you that has come to realize\nthat that's not true and stuff like that\nso totally fine\nbut this goes back to like if someone\ncompliments you you're like you know it\nbounces right off\nor you learn how to pretend to take it\nin and then if someone's like really\nnasty to you they're like\nyou know it kind of sinks in and you're\nlike yes that's correct so that's what\nwe're talking about okay\nand and the only way that the world can\nmake sense\nif you grow up with the history that you\nhave\nwhich once again we don't need to go\ninto is it okay that i just reference it\nlike that yeah yeah\nokay so like you know i and if you feel\nlike i think it could be illustrated but\nyou don't have to if you can feel your\nif you can share your experience of like\na particular memory you don't have to\ntell us what happened\nbut just how you learn to believe that\nabout yourself\nyou know something like that not not\nquite yet but let me just keep going but\ni think it could be helpful\nso so the world makes sense because you\ndon't deserve to be cared for\nand and then what happens is like\nsomething in there as you're navigating\nthose protective mechanisms we see\na lot of these coping mechanisms like\neating disorders\num you know self-injurious behavior\nsubstance use we see all these different\nthings\nand if you really look at those i i you\nknow i i'd bet money and you can answer\nthis if you want to\nthat when you were engaging in\nself-injurious behavior it would shut up\nthe voice in your head\nand this is the really interesting thing\nabout self-injurious behavior is that a\nlot of times it's not\nany intention to harm yourself it's\nactually a very powerful\nalmost meditative technique that brings\nyour awareness to the present\nand all of the voices in your head shut\nup\nbecause there is something incredibly\npainful that demands a hundred percent\nof your attention\nyeah hence why dbt absolutely right so\nwhat what dbt does is it trains you to\nreplace\nthat injurious behavior with another\nmeditative technique or awareness\ntechnique or grounding technique\nthat causes your mind to like let go of\nthose thoughts and focus on one thing\nand so i think the real challenge is\ngoing to be and i feel like i want to\nbuild up to this better\nis that if you are worth caring for\nit rewrites your history because that\nmeans that like everything that happened\nto you really\nshouldn't have happened to you\nyeah wow\num that's just wrong\nthat's just yeah i just realized that\nthat's way that's crazy um\nbecause i always tell myself yeah no\nit's okay that it happened because it\nmade me the first name today but\nif you say it like that you're right oh\ngod\noh god\nyeah right it's it's hard\nbecause here's the thing nikki it's not\nokay that i think that stuff happened to\nyou\nbut that you know\n[Laughter]\ndamn it nikki\nso you know what is that we can just\ntake a second\noh god\nwow i've never i've never looked at it\nthat way actually\nit was always like oh i'm so strong\nfor getting over it and telling myself\nit's okay that it happened\nbut in reality i i know that it\nshouldn't have happened\nso what is it like to\nhave that thought\ni still wanna i still just wanna do good\nwith it\nlike as much as it shouldn't have\nhappened\nit i can i learn from it and i can take\nso much experience from it that i can\nuse to help people and i think i think\nif i can\nmanage to either and\nand do this for someone else like that\nit doesn't happen for someone else or\nhelp someone else to\nto deal with it and and to cope with\nwhat happened\ni think as long as i can do that it's\ngonna be worth it\ni know i'm just like projecting it on\nother people again\nbut i feel like that's all i can do so\nso here's\nsure so i i think you're it the voice in\nyour head is struggling now okay which\nis good\nbut you're saying like if i can turn\nsome\nturn it into something good then it\nmakes it worth it\nnikki no it doesn't\nnothing is gonna make it work nothing\nisn't gonna make it okay\nright that like and i i don't mean to\nbludgeon you i feel like\nno yeah no i'm not gonna let you sneak\naway\nright because you're doing like your\nmind's trying to do it like oh then\nit'll be\nokay if i can if i can protect a hundred\npeople's\npain by sacrificing myself then that\nmakes the sacrifice worth it\nand this is what i'm telling you this is\nwhy i think you're not going to be able\nto let people care about you\nuntil you recognize that fixing no\namount of people's lives\nmakes it okay what happened to you\nthere's no amount of self-sacrifice\nthat like i'm not going to let you do\nthat\nsaving a thousand lives doesn't make it\nokay\nright like worth it that's what you've\ngot to get rid of\nbecause that's once again like that's\nyou putting other people ahead of\nyourself\ni tend to do that yes you do\nand so if you really want to be able to\nlet people care about you\nyou have to let yourself come\nfirst sometimes and i think you're\nlearning that\nyou know and i think you're right that\nchat there are boundaries that are\nimportant but when it comes to your\nfriends and your family and when it\ncomes to other people like wanting to\nlisten to your opinion\nlike you actually have it and here's a\ncrazy thing\nso you think that your value is\ndetermined on the number of people that\nyou help\nlike i believe you have value no matter\nwhat you accomplish like that core thing\nthere's nothing\nthere's nothing you can do that just\nlike that counteracts that voice in\nsight like that's like you see what i'm\nsaying there's like there's like the\nlike you don't have to do [ __ ]\nyou have intrinsic value nikki has\nintrinsic value she doesn't have to\nprove anything\nshe doesn't have to make it and like\nwhat happened to her was bad\nthere's nothing that will make it worth\nit\ni'll have to think about like days after\npenny for your thoughts\nwhat are you thinking right now\n[Laughter]\ni think also insightful that i i\nencourage you to continue to think about\nthose things but i think maybe\nwe're short-circuited for the day\nwow\nyeah so i don't know what to do now\nso\nyeah um questions do you have any\nyou don't have to have anything in your\nmind because i think this is sort of\nwhat we go for right i think it's fine\nto\nprocess this maybe talk to your\ntherapist next week about it whatever\num no i don't think i have any questions\nabout\nthat now but um like i said i\ni really like what you do like what you\nwork do you\nwant to tell me or i know a lot of my\nviewers are in chat right now do you\nwant to tell us like more about your\nwork and what you do\n[Laughter]\nyes we can we can we can certainly go to\nsafe ground\nand the safety net of telling people\nabout what we do\nbecause i i i don't think i can talk\nmuch about myself anymore\ni think we're done i think it's it's a\ngigi\nuh so yeah sure i'm i'm happy to do that\nso my name is ola i'm a i'm a\npsychiatrist that\npractices in boston i spent about seven\nyears studying to become a monk\nand then met my wife and fell in love\nand then she wanted to be married to a\ndoctor\nand so i went to medical school she\nwanted to be married to a neurosurgeon\nbut i decided that wasn't for me so i\npicked the next best thing which is\npsychiatry\nand then what i really found is that\nthere are a lot of\nuh you know mental health the child the\nmental health challenges that people\nface nowadays are\nare expanding changing very rapidly\nand that some of these perspectives that\npsychiatry\nhas are like missing something so and i\nthink nikki actually you illustrate this\nreally well where\nman you are incredibly resilient\nincredibly insightful i'm sure you'd be\na wonderful\nclinician um you have a very high eq\nwhich is emotional quotient so i think\nyour ability to read\nother people and understand what they\nneed is like really high\nand at the same time despite all of the\ntherapy despite all of the intelligence\nthere's a perspective\nhere about what is the self\nthat i think is missing from kind of\nlike psychiatric treatment\nbecause at the end of the day like we\ncan you know you could do therapy and\nyou can make these\nuncoveries in therapy but sort of really\ngrappling with this like\nof who am i and do i have worth as a\nhuman being and being taught\nthat i don't have worth as a human being\novercoming that\nbeing resilient and being positive and\nsacrificing yourself for the rest of the\nworld\nis noble and wonderful and makes the\nworld a better place\nand is also unfair to you\nright so these kinds of perspectives is\nwhat we try to help people with\nis that there's definitely a mental\nhealth or mental treatment component i\nthink seeing a therapist is a wonderful\nthing\nand and i think you're just a really\nfantastic example of someone who's\nreally internalized\ni think it is amazing that you know\nyou're saying that you don't really\nengage in self-injurious behavior\nanymore we haven't really talked about\nit but it sounds like some of your\neating behaviors are probably better\nunder control\nthings like that and so i think you're\na wonderful example of what we try to\nbalance in people which is that there's\nlike a mental\nhealth comp or like mental treatment\ncomponent right\nwhich is like the clinical psychiatry\nand then there's almost like\na more spiritual component understanding\nyourself component\nfinding your purpose in life trying to\nfigure out you know what is the root of\nthese patterns\nof who you engage in relationships with\nhow can we understand those things\nuh so that's really what we try to do\nand we started in the gaming community\nbecause i'm a degenerate gamer\nand um what i really found is that a lot\nof people\nin this community like need help and\nneed support and the other really\ninteresting thing is that\ni found that the standard psychiatry\nstuff part of the reason it doesn't work\nideally is because we actually don't\nplay to the gamer's strengths\nand in your case nikki like i think\nplaying directly to the strength of your\ninsight like going out and trying stuff\nlike you don't need to do that\nyou can actually figure most of it out\nup here and i think that's what you've\nmanaged to do your entire life\nright like you've learned how to survive\nand adapt like\nall in here and so that's kind of the\napproach that we take\ni like that now i'm curious whenever i\ni say you're insightful like do you does\nthat sink in or do you swat it\nuh no it doesn't get i i i i take\ni appreciate that a lot yeah like\nhearing that from especially you as\nyou know a psychiatrist a trained\nprofessional i do appreciate that\nactually a lot\nyeah you're you're sneaky enough to be a\ngood psychiatrist\nthank you\num yeah so that's what we do\nyou know we can wrap up now if you want\nto we can talk about meditation a little\nbit\num if i think this is going to be old\nnews to you but\ni was thinking about maybe taking a\nmoment to explain a couple of things we\nhaven't talked much about\ndiagnosis and and stuff like that i'm\npurposely not asking you that question\nbecause i don't want to\nbut if people are curious you know i can\nshare some information that may or may\nnot\nrelate to nikki but i think is just\nuseful information to know\ndoes that feel safe to you yeah for sure\nokay\nso the first thing is that you know what\nwe're hearing from nikki and this\nhappens to a lot of people is that\nwhen we grow up in situations where um\nsometimes we deal with things like abuse\nand neglect\nwe have to learn like almost as a\nsurvival mechanism like\nhow to\nread other people so there's a lot of\nevidence that shows there's a really\ninteresting study\non people who have borderline disorder\nwhich is um a diagnosis that relates to\nearly childhood trauma\nwhere if someone's smiling if i'm\nsmiling\nand then i get mad if you look at that\nlike if if we were to like\npause or like take a recording of that\nvideo and watch that transition like i'm\nsmiling and then maybe this is like\nhalfway\nand then i'm mad you know if we look at\nthat transition and we break it up into\na hundred still photos\nwhere photo number one is 100 smile in\nphoto number two\ni mean photo number hundred is a hundred\npercent angry\nmost of us have to cross the halfway\npoint before we can tell that\nsomeone isn't smiling anymore we have to\nbe at like 70 percent towards\nanger people with bpd\ncan detect anger when people are like 80\nsmiling so something happens in our\nbrains when we grow up in environments\nthat are traumatic\nwhere when everyone else is smiling we\nare actually able to pick out\nlike negative things and so it changes\nthe way that we think it's absolutely\nadaptive mechanism there's an interview\nthat we did with coco b\na couple maybe about almost a year ago\nnow where\nyou know he grew up in an abusive house\nhousehold and i asked him like\nhow many seconds did it take from when\nyour dad walked into the door\nwhether you knew like you know today is\na bad day or today is a good day\nand he's like less than two less than\nthree like you know right away\nso your brain is actually wiring to\ndetect\nnegative sentiment from other people and\nthat can be really really challenging\nbecause like even people who like you\neighty percent of the way there\nall you're gonna see is the 20\nfrustration that they have\nand that can be very hard for you to\nlike interact with other people because\neven though\nmost of the people are happy all you're\nseeing is people being angry\nand so you know i think that's something\nthat we see a lot with trauma\nthe other interesting thing is that when\npeople you know go through traumatic\nexperiences you develop this voice in\nyour head that kind of\ntalks about how you're a bad person that\nvoice gets reinforced by seeing the 20\nfrustration in every person you meet\nbecause it's like you see i told you so\ni told you so\nsometimes we also get into weird\npatterns and we didn't talk too much\nabout this but i'll leave this for you\nfor later but that\nlet's say you meet two people i haven't\nasked you about your sexuality or\nanything but i'm just gonna assume a\nheteronormative perspective for a second\nso let's say you meet two guys\nand like one of them genuinely cares\nabout you\nand one of them is an [ __ ] who\npretends to care about you\nand the interesting thing that can\nhappen is that sometimes\nthe genuine caring actually makes you\nfeel so uncomfortable that you pull away\nfrom it\nand you kind of pick the devil that you\nknow and so this is where like\nthat awareness of that discomfort\nit becomes really really important and\nand sort of not giving in to that\ndiscomfort or at least\nnoticing okay am i giving into this like\nwhy do i not like this guy\nlike what is my mind telling me which\nvoice in my head is the one telling me\nthat this is not the right guy\nand what what is it that like why am i\nso enamored with this person\noh they're so caring they're willing to\ndrop everything for me\nyou know they met me three days ago and\nthey're gonna move across the country to\nbe with me\nand it can you can feel so loved but the\nproblem is like that same guy\nsix months later is gonna move across\nthe country for someone else\nand then the voice in your head is like\nsee i told you so i told you you were\nunlovable\nhe just got to know you and you couldn't\nkeep up the act for so\nso long oh you got it\n[Laughter]\nsee that stuff about you know you being\nunlovable great because that's what\nwe're talking about\nis that sometimes that voice tells you\nthat you're fundamentally unlovable\nbecause if you are lovable it changes\neverything\nand so a lot of times when we deal with\nthose voices we also get into\nyou know our bodies our minds our brains\nhave to cope they have to survive\nthey have to adapt so the voice itself\nis one adaptation and then we also find\ni i basically have seen three things\nconsistently one is substance use\none is self-harm and third is eating\ndisorder\neating disorder is the way that we get\ncontrol over our life\ni'm not in control i don't get to choose\ni'm moving every six months\ni don't get to choose who my mom hangs\nout with but i get to control what i put\ninto my body\nand even when there are lots of signals\nfrom your body that are telling you\nyou should eat something you are going\nto say no despite how hard things get\noddly enough\nthe harder things get the more out of\ncontrol your world is\nthe more empowered you feel by taking\ncontrol\nof like all of these sensations from\nyour body you are gonna win\nat least in this temple that is my body\ni get to decide what happens\nand so we see this really interesting\nlike correlation between the eating\ndisorder gets worse\nwhen your circumstances get worse and\nit's like you trying to internally\nbalance stuff\nself-injurious behavior we talked about\na little bit sometimes self-injurious\nbehavior can be\nthe result of like you actually like\nwanting to hurt yourself\nbut for some people for a lot of people\nit actually seems to be almost like a\nmeditative technique when i hear people\ntalk about it when i ask them like\nhow do you feel before you do it how do\nyou feel when you do it how do you feel\nafter you do it\nsounds to me like meditating because you\nenter this no mind state where your mind\nis fully focused on the cutting or the\nburning or the whatever\nright and then substance use is sort of\nthe easy oblivion\nthis is one that we do gaming to\ni'm just gonna load up this particular\ngame and i'm gonna forget about all my\nproblems\nyeah so so kind of like wrapping things\nup\nyou know here's what i'd say um if\nanyone is struggling with either\nsubstance use eating disorder behaviors\nor self-harm you guys should really do\nyourself the benefit i think nikki is\nthe nikki that we're seeing today who's\nincredibly adaptive and has managed to\nbe like really successful at the age of\n19 and all that good stuff\ni think that she's accomplished through\nlike doing a lot of hard work on your\nown but also having some\nexpert guidance so i encourage anyone to\ngo see a licensed mental health\nprofessional\nif you guys are dealing with any of that\nstuff um\nand also to try to understand like the\nfundamentals of sort of like who you are\nyou know and and at some point nikki i\nknow it's terrifying but\nat some point no i'm\nyou're gonna push that back let me think\nabout this\ni was about to say at some point i hope\nyou realize that you are worth caring\nfor\nintrinsically and and i know that\nthere's a part of you that can get on\nboard with that but there's a part of\nyou that may be pushed that way so i'm\ngoing to say something else which is\ngoing to be a little bit more terrifying\nand a little bit more defiant\ni'm going to choose to care about you\nwhether you like it or not now you think\nthe baseball bat again i'm gonna just\ncare you can\ngo [ __ ] yourself i don't well that\ndoesn't mean that you care about me\nthough\nhuh that doesn't mean you care about me\nthough yeah it's a little bit of a joke\ni know i'm gonna choose to care about\nyou no matter what you do whether you\nbecome a psychiatrist and you save\nthousands of lives\ngood for you and if you choose not to do\nthat\ni still think you're a worthwhile person\nwho deserves\na place on this earth and deserves\nhappiness\nsinking in somewhere everyone how much\nyou're swatting\nyeah enough for today\ni would say so i think normally i would\noffer to teach you meditation but i\nthink today is a day where we're not\ngoing to do that i think\nwe're going to just let you i've learned\na lot about medica\nmeditation that's the other thing and\nand and maybe what i would yeah so i\nthink we're just going to let you go now\nokay thank you so much for coming on\nthank you so much for having me i\nappreciate that a lot yeah\ndude you've been awesome thank you thank\nyou\ngood luck to you thank you all right\nbye oh man\nchat she is pog dude\nincredibly strong"
