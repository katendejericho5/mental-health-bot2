    "transcript": "i think we've still got nihachu on\nwednesday and and asman gold on friday\num and today we're gonna be talking with\nthe bjergsen\nbeer the beer\nbjergson\nwelcome thank you um\nand what do you what do you go by\nuh sauron okay sorry that's good\nand um you know you can call me alok or\ndr k like\nyou know whatever you prefer okay um\nyeah so thank you so much for coming on\nsoren how are you doing today\ni'm good i'm nervous but i'm good i\nthink most people usually are and i i\nstill don't know quite what to do about\nthat\num there's only so much you can do i\nthink yeah\nso what are you nervous about\nuh just being vulnerable on such an open\nplatform\ni mean that's the kind of beauty of it\nbut that's also uh\ni guess what makes me nervous at least\nyeah and are you planning on being\nvulnerable today\ni think it's kind of hard not to be on\non your channel from all the talks that\ni've seen\nwell yeah at the fair point but you know\nwe can help you not be vulnerable if if\nyou don't want to\nno i mean i think being vulnerable is a\nit's a good thing it's just a difficult\ndifficult thing\nabsolutely man well said well said um\ndid you have an idea of what you wanted\nto talk about today\nuh i have an idea where we can start and\nthen\nsure i'm happy to go wherever you kind\nof see the conversation going or any\nobservations that you might have\nsorry one second so you know yeah\nso um yeah so what where would you like\nto start sauron\nuh it might be hard for me to\nto kind of vocalize this because i\nhaven't really told anyone but\nuh so in league of legends whether\nyou're coaching or playing there's a\nvery distinct like on season and off\nseason\nand people grind really hard in the on\nseason and then\n[Music]\nyou have a lot of free time sometimes\neven kind of months so you're not doing\nwhere you're not really working and\ni feel sometimes like i'm two different\npeople\nespecially in terms of uh\nthe things that i really miss in season\nare the things that i feel like are\nreally different or\nespecially i don't really have a lot of\nfeelings during the season\ni'm very like robotic uh\ngood things bad things i'm pretty stoic\nokay uh\nand and that feels pretty different when\ni'm off season i'm definitely more in\ntouch with my emotions i feel like\nokay and the other thing is kind of just\ncreativity i guess or seeing things\nfrom a different perspective being more\naware of my surroundings and i'm kind of\naware of myself even\nuh in the in the season i feel like that\nkind of goes away and i'm really just\ngrinding and sometimes i don't really\nhave a good perspective on how to\nsolve issues or see things in a\ndifferent way\nand uh i have had that sometimes during\nthe season and i feel like those are\nkind of some of my best\ntimes where i'm able to just be more\naware of what i'm doing and how i can\nkind of optimize\nthe way that i'm living and working and\ntrying to do my job\nthe best that i can okay so let me just\num\nkind of repeat back what i heard make\nsure we're on the same page\num first of all turn this sounds like\nvery\nintriguing to me i'm i'm i i'm\num it seems like an observation\nthat i actually have like imagined very\nfew people actually have the awareness\nto sort of make\num it seems like a very kind of uh\nit seems like you're aware of your\ninternal environment and how much that\ncan change\ndrastically between the on season and\nthe off season is that a good way to put\nit\nand so you've noticed that you have you\nyou maybe\ndon't feel a lot of things during the\nseason and in the off season\nare we saying that you feel too much or\nyou feel a normal amount or what\na normal amount okay i'm not kind of\nbursting at the seams as soon as the\nseason is over\nbut okay more and more kind of natural\nthings like\nuh i'm able to kind of cry when it's\nappropriate during the season\ni'm kind of very just uh\nstoic i guess is the word that i would\nuse okay\nand that you also mentioned something\nabout awareness\nand how you're able to see things\ndifferently during the on season\noff season and that maybe you're not\nquite\nas aware of things during the on season\nand then you also\nalso said that sometimes when you have\nbeen aware during the on season that\nit's been actually really good\ncan you help me understand that\n[Music]\ni think it's just the times where\nnon-season it was really helpful for me\nit's just really being aware of\nteam dynamics or the issues or how we\ncan improve the way that we are working\ntogether or talking to each other or\nit's obviously really flexible when you\nare aware of those things\nbut i think a lot of people in the\nleague of legend scene can really\nwell just talking to people they feel\nlike they get really lost in the sauce\nduring the season and they just\nend up kind of going through in the\nmotions and kind of doing the same\nthings over and over again and then\nafter the season is over it's like wait\nwhat i was just doing this thing kind of\nover and over again and not really\num able to reflect and\nsee things from a different perspective\nand\ni very much feel that same way i'm\nnoticing that there's a lot of autopilot\nonce the season starts it's just grind\ngrind grind\nyeah i mean i think in the beginning\npeople are\nmotivated and excited and trying new\nthings and more creative and then kind\nof as the season goes on as the\nmonths of grinding goes on i think it a\nlot of things become more\nautomated how do you understand why that\nhappens\num\nmaybe just a sheer amount of hours i'm\nnot really sure i mean i didn't\nhave a day off from late december till\nlike the second week of april uh of\ncourse i had time off and i didn't have\na\nkind of day off to myself so i think\nobviously the time where you're away\nfrom the game and what the time where\nyou're doing different things and away\nfrom the team i think that definitely\ngives you\nuh kind of a different perspective and\nmore time to self-reflect\nthat sounds insane man yep\nyeah this may sound like and you know i\ni don't want to\num if we skirt close to anything that\ncould be like\nyou know sharing internal secrets or\nthings like that please steer\nyou know i'm just going to ask you a\nquestion just let me know if anything i\nask is out of line but\nhow on earth do you not have a day off\nin four months\nhow does that work why\nwell i think most people do is just i'm\nthe head coach so\non the typical off day i'm usually doing\ni'm usually watching our matches for the\nweekend and preparing them for\nour meetings next week i'm having\nmeetings with my staff i'm having\nmeetings with\nmy general manager head of esports and\nalso ceo\nuh so that's on your off day\nyeah because it's hard to fit it in on\nmy my birthdays\nokay well\nyou know sword i i know this may be a\nlittle bit different from\nwhat you had originally said but i think\nthat may be worth talking about what do\nyou think\nuh yeah okay i think it could be worth\ntalking about\nwhat makes it hard to fit in meetings\nwith your ceo\nand general manager on your work days\nno i mean i definitely could in the\nevening it's just\na lot of the time i'm pretty pooped\nuh just from\ni think a typical work day we meet up at\n10\nand then we're kind of done with team\npractice around either 6 p.m or maybe 8\np.m\nand then on some days of the week i'm\nhaving kind of individual meetings with\nthe players\nand um\nthe last day of the week going into\nmatches there's also always a lot of\nprep\naround kind of different aspects of the\ngame the the opponent the draft\nand i'm responsible for a lot of that\nnot that prep for the opponents luckily\ni have a\nstrategy coach that helps with that but\num\nit's just hard if it fit things in and\ni also need to have a little bit of uh\noff time obviously on those days or\ni kind of might lose my mind yup\nabsolutely\nso let me ask you something what would\nhappen if you missed two hours of team\npractice on monday\nmonday's actually our day off but yeah\non tuesday i don't know\nwhat happened because i haven't tried i\nmean\nsometimes i do ask my assistant coach to\ntake over for me if i'm just really\nexhausted or\nuh if i just want a different\nperspective see someone else\nlead meetings and review thoughts\ni haven't been away from practice at all\nwhat keeps you so close to practiced\ni mean i'm a new coach this is my first\nfive months of coaching so i feel like\ni have a lot of catching up to do and\ni\num yeah i just feel like i guess i need\nto work harder than everyone else\nbecause i'm so new in coaching but\ni still want my team to do i don't want\nto hold my team back\nso i guess i just want to make the most\nof every\nopportunity to learn and grow and become\nbetter\nwhat she's looking for\noh sorry okay [ __ ]\nyou're damn right [ __ ]\nokay so let's let's unpack this a little\nbit okay\nso sorry if did i just make you nervous\nby smiling and saying you're damn right\n[ __ ]\nno i mean i i know i definitely have a\nlittle bit of a\nmaybe toxic productivity kind of mindset\ntell me what okay what do you mean by\ntoxic productivity mindset can you help\nus understand that phrase\n[Music]\ni don't really know how to okay let's\nphrase it okay\nokay yeah is it okay if we dig into this\ntoday\nyeah okay um i'm gonna ask you that\nquestion two or three more times because\ni suspect\nthat we're going to get to feelings that\nmay feel\nactually uncomfortable and and my\nconcern is that you have such a\ntoxic productivity and growth oriented\nmindset that even if things are\nuncomfortable\nyou'll never say no\nwell a big part of why i'm even here is\nthat the\ni'm just trying to get outside my\ncomfort zone more okay and i guess\nbecause you're trying to grow\n[Laughter]\nain't nobody got time for that that's\nwhat i'm saying\nyou know gotta grow whatever the cost to\nyou\na little bit okay i think that's what\nthat's what toxic toxic productivity\ni've never heard that phrase before but\ni i think it's well said\ncoined well so let's start with this\nokay\ni'm gonna lay things out and then we're\ngonna explore and what i the reason i'm\ngonna lay things out is because um\ni'm imagining that there's a part of\nyour mind that's really really concerned\nabout like stepping into\na trap of some kind you mentioned you\nare nervous i think you have\nyou're going to have a tendency to set\naside your own feelings for the sake of\ngrowth\nso i'm going to try to alleviate this a\nlittle bit it's not usually how i work\nusually we'll have the revelation at the\nend\nbut i'm just going to give it to you\nanticlimactically at the beginning and\nthen we're going to explore it\nand the reason i'm gonna do that is that\ni hope it'll put your mind a little bit\nat ease\nokay okay so the first thing is that\nyou know i've seen this a lot so i've\nworked with a fair number of esports\norganizations before\nand and not just esports but basically\nany\nhigh performing top tier like 0.1\norganization you go to so i've seen this\nat places like harvard business school\ni've seen it at hospital systems you\nknow tech companies um\nthere's this idea that more is better\nso for example like in residency\ntraining like we we do like 24-hour\ncalls we do 30-hour calls\nthere's this kind of this idea that like\nyou know if you work 80 hours a week or\na hunt working 100 hours a week\nis better than working 80 hours a week\nyou know that that like work like\nworking more is better\nand and i've i've struggled a lot to\nsort of like\nget people to experiment with this and\ni'd say the the\nhardest uphill climb i've ever had to\nmake which i failed to make\nwas working with a korean overwatch team\nand that's gonna be a challenge and they\njust didn't\nlike accept that working less could lead\nto better results\nand and this is where and i've managed\nto convince some people\nthat actually like you know rather than\ndoing team practice for 12 hours a day\nor eight hours a day\nthat doing team practice for like four\nhours six hours a day and doing like\nan hour of meditation and yoga and an\nhour of like\nsomething else actually leads to like\nbetter outcomes\nthan just grinding what do you think\nabout that\ni think one of the most difficult things\nabout the game that\ni was playing professionally for a long\ntime and i'm coaching is that it changes\na lot\nthat really rewards the grinders because\nthe game is always changing a lot so you\nalways need to adapt and\nfigure out what's strong what counters\nthis new thing that's strong\nthis thing that was powerful it's now\nbeen made maybe five percent ten percent\nweaker is it still viable\nwhich situations is it viable uh so it\nreally rewards grinders and honestly the\nbiggest grinders\nare the most successful in league of\nlegends okay um\nso it definitely it does require putting\na lot of hours but\nof course up until a certain point um\nyeah so so and this is where ultimately\nyou're the expert here right because i\ndon't know\nhow many hours of grinding before you\nstart hitting diminishing returns\nit's generally speaking been my\nexperience that people tend to\noveremphasize grinding\nand and i i don't know really to i mean\nand each esport is different but it's\nbeen my experience that\nmost of the time like in 80\nof the esports orgs i've worked with\nthat de-emphasizing grinding\nusually leads to better performance that\nbeing thoughtful\nit doesn't mean that you're not thinking\nabout the game it's just being\nthoughtful about your practice is\nactually better than like grinding\nyeah um but that's not where we're gonna\ngo\nwhat we're gonna go then what i would\nsay when i was a player is\nwhy can't i be thoughtful while grinding\nyeah okay\nthere it is okay so so so wha\nwhy would you say that as a player\nwhere does that come from um because\nthat that sounds like\nthe best of both worlds you're kind of\ngetting all the benefits right\nbe more deliberate in your practice but\nalso shooting for the best\nyeah okay so but what we're going to\ntalk about is\nyou feel like you have a lot of catching\nup to do\nlong have you felt that way\nwow uh\nin general i assume you mean more in\ngeneral yeah\num\nnow we're hitting the the big stuff\ni don't know if it's the big stuff but\nuh it's pretty public i made a facebook\npost many years ago that i was\nbullied really heavily in school from\nfourth grade to\neighth grade when i actually dropped out\nof school and\ndropping out of school kind of caused me\nto play a lot more video games which\nsomehow turned into a job which somehow\nbrought me where i am now\nso i was really fortunate in that sense\nbut\ni was kind of in and out of school\nfor i can't remember how long because\nhonestly a lot of my young past is kind\nof a blur\nat this point but i was in my own school\nfor a long time\ni pretty much didn't leave my room i\ndidn't see anyone outside of my\nfamily and had a lot of anxiety\ninteracting with other people and\neven when i started going to esports\ntournaments i felt\njust like very underdeveloped for my age\nand even coming to the us here when i\nwas 17 18\ni wasn't really able to upkeep a\nconversation with another person\nuh the only thing i really knew was the\ngame and that's what i\ndove into uh and i think at that point i\ndefinitely felt like\ni'm uh\ni guess undeveloped underdeveloped for\nmy age like my life skills my social\nskills\nthese kinds of things and\nit was super uncomfortable but i just\ntried to\nstill spend a lot of time with people\nand\nlearn how to be a normal person screw\nyour feelings right\num\n[Music]\ni don't know that's a difficult one i\nmean\nwhen when i was\nlistening to my feelings when i was\ndepressed they were just telling me\ndon't see other people stay in your room\nplay video games all day\nuh and it was really when i\ni guess\njust really got outside my comfort zone\ni went to an esports event in sweden\nmet a bunch of other met my teammates in\nperson which is really terrifying\nbecause i was\nreally deeply insecure um\nbut then my team got top eight i think\nand then we actually qualified\nfor the lcs when lcs was starting back\nin season three so this is\nmaybe eight years ago so we qualify for\nlcs and then that\nreally got me the job as an esports\nplayer so\nso you have to work harder than everyone\nelse\nyeah i think i always felt that way i\nnever felt like i was\nsuper intrinsically talented\ni always felt like a lot of my skill\ncame from\nmy work ethic i think that's certainly\ntrue\nby the way i loved your answer to screw\nyour feelings because you were like\nit's tough because sometimes my feelings\ntell me to stay in my room and\nnot interact with anyone and you've had\nto learn how to master your feelings at\ntimes\nyeah they still do tell me that\nsometimes\nwow okay and then you also said i don't\nwant to hold everyone back\ncan you tell me um\n[Music]\nyeah i mean i think the natural\nprogression of a coach is kind of to\nstart\ncoaching maybe individual players and\nthen maybe coaching an amateur or\nacademy team but i went straight from\nplaying lcs to coaching kind of a\ntop-tier multi-million dollar team so i\njust don't want to\nhold them back with my inexperience do\nyou feel\nunderdeveloped\n[Laughter]\num\ndo i feel underdeveloped\num\ni feel like i don't have a ton of\nexperience yet i would say\nso does that kind of answer your\nquestion or does it not i think it's uh\nit's a very artful dodge\nthat could be an answer if i wanted to\naccept it as one\nand and i'm not i'm not you know if it's\nan answer it's an answer\nso if your answer is no i don't feel\nunderdeveloped\nwhat i feel is inexperienced and there's\na difference\nbecause i think the other challenge here\nis soren is that\ni think that yeah what would you say to\nthat\ni just don't understand the the\ndifference between the two\nokay inexperienced and underdeveloped\nokay\nyou would say that those are the same\nthing\nuh in this coaching case i i definitely\nwill develop with experience\nof course it's not the only thing but\nyeah yeah\nso here's my concern\nis that as long as you feel like you\nhave catching up to do\nyou're going to act in a way that\nalleviates those feelings\nand the challenge is that there may come\na time where you have caught up\nbut just because you've technically\ncaught up\nmay not actually have anything to do\nwith the feeling of having caught up\nand and i i'm curious also\nyeah you don't really know when you've\ncaught up because you i also don't\nreally see other\nyeah i mean it's just a hard thing it's\nnot a very linear thing like oh now i've\ncaught up now i have these skills\nexactly so i i see you putting yourself\ninto like an unwinnable proposition\nbecause you're never gonna know whether\nyou've caught up or not and you're gonna\nbe like\ndriving yourself forward because you\nfeel like you need to catch up\nand even though and i know this sounds\nweird so like sometimes certain people\nwho have your your complex for lack of a\nbetter term\nyou know these people who feel like\nthey're under developed feel like they\nhave to work really bad i mean really\nhard\nfeel like they've fallen behind they\nwill\nlike work so hard that they'll actually\nrise i know this sounds absolutely crazy\nthey'll rise to the top of their field\nand sometimes even in video gaming for\nexample\nare like 20 million players in this game\ncalled league of legends\nand they'll actually rise to a top tier\nteam in a professional\nleague of legends capacity and they\nstill feel like they have catching up to\ndo\ni know it sounds absolutely crazy\nno\nright so what does catching up look like\n[Music]\ncan i ask is that such a bad feeling to\nhave or do you just think\nit's kind of a deep-seated uh\nlike you don't you don't ever feel like\nyou're enough it's not kind of the\nis that how you feel like you never feel\nlike you're enough\n[Music]\ni i don't ever think that but if i think\nthat i can always grow\nmaybe yep well said right\nso so i i'm not hearing that you really\ni don't have really\nnegative self thoughts like i'm like i'm\nnot enough but i do have like oh i need\nto be better\nyeah that's kind of what i think a lot\nyeah so so i think that that's a very\nvery good\nnew man you're very nuanced soren so\nthere's there's a there's a\nthere's a new there's a important\ndifference between i'm not\ngood and i could be better\nright i suspect that those are two sides\nof the same coin\nand i think that always striving to be\nbetter\ncan come from a dissatisfaction with who\nyou are\ni personally think that's what you've\ngot down there i think you've just\nyou've just put such positive psychology\nlanguage around it\nlike you just talk about growth but like\ni do think that there's fear and other\nnegative emotion like i don't want to\nhold everyone back\nimplies to me that if i really had to\nguess what i'd say is that\nin your mind you're afraid that you will\nhold everyone back\nand that's why you have to work harder\nthan everyone else because your\nteammates don't deserve\nto have someone like you hold them back\nthey deserve\nto have someone who can really like live\nup to expectations\nand like be the coach that your team\nneeds and the coach that your team\ndeserves\nand you're going to work really hard to\nbe that thing\nbut i think that there's still a\nfundamental like fear\nunderneath there that you're like you\nhave to work really hard because\ndeep down if you just auto pilot it it's\nnot gonna be enough\num yeah so then you asked me the\nquestion\nis that necessarily bad because i seem\nto be placing a judgment on it\nwhat do you think\num\ni guess\nmaybe this is not what you're asking but\ni guess i feel like a lot of the time\nthe way that i\nspend my life or live my life on\nautopilot\nuh just doesn't really make me happy i\nthink\ni think i think i think i waste it's\nuh i get like sucked into things very\neasily like social media and obviously\nthose are\nbuilt to be addicting but uh\nif i wasn't kind of pushing myself to be\na better person and to\nlive life more intentionally and use my\ntime wisely\nthat's why i have this stupid skull\nbecause it reminds me that i don't live\nforever and i try to make the most of\nof my days it's a little bit more of a\ntime within my room but\nit does help me especially when i have a\nhard time getting up in the morning\nbut why do you have to make the most of\nyour days\nwhy do i have to make the most out of my\ndays\ni think it just makes me feel fulfilled\nand it's not like all i do is work right\nit's even just uh\nbeing more intentional about even like\nspending time with other people\ni think when i live life very much on\nautopilot i also isolate myself\na lot i'm definitely\npretty introverted and if i'm not kind\nof\nmaking myself get out there then i\nisolate myself very much\ncan i think for a second sure take your\ntime\ncan you tell me about bullying\ntell you about bullying what do you want\nto know\nso you mentioned that you dropped out of\nschool in fourth grade\neighth grade eighth grade so can you\ntell me about\nwhat what happened between fourth grade\nand eighth grade what school was like\nfor you\nuh it was\nreally bad uh\nlooking back i don't know i don't know\nhow hard i was being singled out\ncompared to kind of how sensitive\ni was because my my parents always told\nme that i was a very sensitive kid\nespecially compared to my brothers\nbut i felt very singled out by some\npeople in my class\nby my teacher at the time\ni felt like he was uh\nsomewhat bullying me or singling me out\nuh but of course i was a kid so i don't\nknow how much that is true but that was\nvery much\nmy reality what do you remember\ndon't remember too much to be honest\ni remember more so like in eighth grade\nwhen people would\nuh when the bus was coming like steal my\nbackpack\nand hold it until the bus left so i\nwould have to go home without my\nbackpack or i would have to stay and\nthen\ni would end up walking home a lot but\nit's like\nuh it's like a five mile walk or\nsomething for my walk\num and\njust being bullied a lot for being\nskinny especially\ni was a really really skinny and short\nkid so bullied a lot for my body weight\nmy school was kind of up against the\nkindergarten so they would throw me into\nthe kindergarten because they said i\ni looked like a kid in kindergarten\nbecause i was small and skinny\nthat was really [ __ ] painful at the\ntime for sure\nunderdeveloped oh\nhey look i was full circle i tried to\nmap things out for you so i didn't i\ndidn't spring it on you bro you know\nuh-huh that's right i didn't even i\ndidn't even realize that i was talking\nabout it\nyeah i'm just gonna cry quietly to\nmyself for a second okay\num yeah let me ask you what\nwhat uh\nall right soren we're just getting\nstarted buddy so\nwhen when this thing happened with the\nbackpack like what did your\ndid you tell anyone\nhmm\ni don't think so\nbecause that was in eighth grade so\ni think back in sixth seventh fifth\ngrade\ni would tell my parents and then they\nwould wanna contact the school contact\nthe principal contact their parents\nand of course when you're a young kid\nyou care a lot about being cool and\ni was always the kid who\nso that's kind of like the popular group\nof kids and i would always try to tag\nalong but i was never really a part of\nof that circle\nso i would be the kid that's getting\npicked on in the popular circle\nuh but i so desperately wanted to be a\npart of that circle so i didn't want\nmy parents to talk to their parents and\nand obviously\nit's really silly now but at the time\nit's to social status is really\nimportant\ndoesn't sound silly to me\nwell i think if i was who i am now i\nwould just\nthere's a lot of kids at the school try\nto find people who okay\naccept me and that i could get along\nwith you don't have to be a part of the\nmost\npopular clique in the school sure\nwell in that sense i think i would have\ndone better if i was i definitely\nadmired the kids\nwho you know kids would get picked on\nfor drawing\nor for doing things that were considered\nnerdy but they were really\nthey knew what they liked and they knew\nthe kind of people that they were\nand i guess i was more so just trying to\nfit in\nso in hindsight as i got older i had a\nlot of risk\ni have a lot of respect for those kids\nwho\nare able to be true to themselves and\nwhat they enjoy even though it's not\ncool or it's not what\nmost people like to do\nand and i know this is going to be\nbouncing what what\noh is this funny when you when you smile\ni feel like you're\nlike oh okay this makes a lot of sense\nwhat do you think is going on in my head\nright now\num\ni don't know okay i can't really tell\nyou\num\ndo you like being fulfilled\num\nthis feels like a trick question but\num\nyeah okay it really wasn't a trick\nquestion it was just sort of a\num you know i know it's certainly i can\nsee what you mean in terms of i'm trying\nto i'm trying to let you know well in\nadvance before i lay out a trap for you\nokay\nokay um but\nyeah okay how would you feel if i if i\ncould give you a pill that would make\nyou content\nwould you take it\nactually that's a bad question but but\nlet's just hear your answer anyway\ni feel like of course you would want to\nsay yes but i guess i'm worried that\nit's a complicated question yeah\nwhat's complicated about it\nbecause of course you want to be sorry\nwhat is the word content\nuh but\ni guess i just worry that i i might\nkind of let myself go but also does that\nreally matter if i'm just content\nbut then i would probably also die young\nbecause i would just\nnot exercise and not do these kinds of\nthings that are going to make me a\nhealthier person but\ni'm definitely overthinking the question\nnope i don't think you are i think\nyou're\ni don't really know i can't tell you you\nmay be underdeveloped in many ways soren\nbut i don't think you're underdeveloped\nin your thinking\ni think you're a very precise thinker so\ni've got kind of a fork in the road one\nis you know we can get more to what i'm\npretty sure\nis some sense of okay here's here's what\ni'm hearing okay\nso i'm gonna try to once again avoid\npits\nbut i'm detecting what i will call pit\nsoren\nso there's like a sauron who's like\nstuck in a pit\nand this is the soren that maybe was\nbullied maybe dropped out maybe was\nisolated maybe felt\nunderdeveloped you know like you were\nkind of in this dark place\nand like it was really hard to like be\nyou and i think that like on paper\nyou've crawled out of there right like i\nmean here you are\nhead coach of of a very popular league\nof legends team\nyou know you have a a pretty star like a\npretty respectable\nprofessional career behind you you've\nclearly landed on your feet you've gotta\nyou know you're rocking a pretty awesome\nbeard um\nyou know there are a lot of things about\nyou that are like you can really be\nproud of\nand yet you don't strike me as someone\nwho's like\nand i think this is where things get\nreally tricky because i think you are\nproud of what you've done i think you\nhave grown you have matured and i\ngenuinely don't believe that like\nyou know i think you really do\nappreciate that but then you've got that\nskull in the back of your room and\nand then like you know it's one thing to\nwant to live every day to your fullest\nbut you have this weird thing where you\nneed a reminder\nand you need a graphic reminder because\nwhat i see in that skull\nis like a fear that unless like if you\never slow down you're gonna be back to\npitsoren\nthat you've climbed fully out of the pit\nbut you need reminders\nto keep you striving\nand this is where you kind of say like\nis that a bad thing is like feeling like\nyou're not good enough or wanting to\ngrow i think you've cloaked it in\npositivity\nit's absolutely adaptive it's absolutely\nresponsible\nfor your success\nbut there's a fundamental lack of\nfulfillment there like that that can't\nexist with fulfillment\nand any time you start to feel fulfilled\ni think you look at your skull over\nthere and it reminds you that\nyou're gonna die one day so better start\nfeeling unfulfilled because it's time to\ngrow\nlike we've got a lot of growing to do\nand like we can't stop growing not even\nfor a single day heaven forbid that i\ntake a day off in four months\nbecause i have so i would like to\nyep i i think you would so what gets in\nthe way\nuh i a lot of it is just my work\nschedule so i think i wouldn't be\nable to give you much more than a\npractical answer\nno but that's an impractical that's not\na because your work schedule\nis determined i think right so this is\nwhere like i'm going to toss out a\nhypothesis usually i wait for hypotheses\nhypothesis formation at the end but i\nthink it comes back to this feeling like\nyou have a lot of catching up to do\nright so like you can't afford to take a\nday off\nthat's what i if i had to piece things\ntogether that's what i would\nthink based on what you've said is that\nyou don't have the luxury of a day off\n[Music]\npartially i think also just\nat least this is what my kind of\nex-girlfriend told me that\nbeing a head coach is a very very time\nconsuming job and if you want to be good\nyou do have to put a lot of time into it\nand maybe it's more so that\nthe kind of person i am i found myself\ncoming into this\nrole does that make sense so i found\nmyself coming into this job that\nmaybe fulfills this drive or insecurity\nthat i have\nwhat do you think about that\n[Music]\nthere might be some truth to it i mean i\ni enjoy responsibility\nfor sure and\nyou have a lot of responsibility as a\nhead coach\nyeah it's interesting to think that you\nknow you picked a job that will always\nmake you feel like you have more\nto do yep is that sort of the\nimplication\nthat that your ex-girlfriend was making\nyep how do you feel about that\num\nmaybe but i don't really see playing as\ntoo different i always had that\nmentality when i was a player that\nthere's\nalways more that i can do um\nbut of course i i tried to balance that\nas well with\nother maybe things that are healthier\nfor me\nyeah i wasn't just playing 14 hours a\nday so so let me ask you this do you\nfeel\nunderdeveloped in other areas of your\nlife\nyeah i would say so like what\nor i'm kind of unsure about it if you\nasked me\nyears ago i would say yes but now i\ni think i realize a little bit more that\na lot of adults\nor mid-20s people are kind of winging it\nand they don't\nwell set uh whereas uh\ni definitely have an issue of kind of\ncomparing myself to others\nokay thinking that they have their [ __ ]\ntogether and i\ndon't i think that kind of goes back to\nthis like idea that we were touching on\nearlier that like\ni think you've started to realize that\nyou may not actually be underdeveloped\nbut you carry that feeling with you\nyeah so you mentioned earlier that you\nfelt like sort of behind socially too\nmaybe around eighth grade or after you\ndropped out of school or when you met\nyour teammates that you felt like very\nnervous\ndo you can you tell me a little bit more\nabout that feeling or what was in your\nhead\n[Music]\nwhat was in my head\nthat was a super vague question so let\nme ask it this way it's kind of\ndifficult to answer yeah it was way too\nvague\nterrible question see i i could do\nbetter\num can you tell me a little bit about\nlike what happened after you dropped out\nafter the eighth grade\num\ni don't remember exactly but\nin denmark you have to finish i guess\nhigh school like 9th grade\nso i would be gone for a bit but then\ni don't know if i want to say the\nauthorities but people came to my house\nand\ntalked to me and talked to my parents\nlike you have to go back to school it's\npart of the law\nsomeone kind of go back to school drop\nback out back to school drop back out\nhere comes the the underdeveloped\nmaybe and\naround this time i was\ndiagnosed with a non-verbal learning\ndisorder\nand i started going to more like a\nspecial needs school\nwith just less students and\na lot of them were kind of on the autism\nor asperger's spectrum\nand it was just kind of hard for me to\nfit in i didn't really feel\nfit in at the regular school and i\ndidn't really feel like i fit in at the\nspecialty school and now that i've gone\nolder i feel like\nthere's a good chance that it was kind\nof an inaccurate diagnosis just based on\nbeing in a really deep depression i\nthink that really changes you\nbut whether i am or have that or not\ni don't really know but it was\nwas really tough on me at the time\nhow did you feel\nwhat do you remember\nhow did i feel\ni want to say the first thing that comes\nto mind is i felt like my life was over\ni'm not sure why i felt that way but\nyeah totally\nit's a good answer and um i remember\nalso feeling that way when\ni first realized i had to wear glasses\nbecause that was also\napparently a life ending thing when\nyou're a teenager\nhow would you feel if you missed two\nhours of practice\n[Music]\num\n[Music]\nweak maybe\nhelp me understand that um\ni guess in a sense that is kind of\nsaying that\ni'm unable to kind of cope with the\nstress of the job in my free time\nso i have to take a little time off of\npractice\nhave you felt weak before\n[Music]\nyeah i mean i think being human is being\nweak in a lot of ways\nand here years ago\ni always as a player i really kind of\nidealized\nthe korean chinese work ethic which is\nlike\nsacrifice everything play all day\nyou don't need to exercise you don't\nneed relationships you don't need\nbalance you just need to grind\nthat was maybe four years ago\nmaybe even longer maybe like five six\nyears ago that was really\nkind of what i strive to be and then as\ni got older i realized i'm human\ni should look out for sure that sounds\nvery\nhealthy i mean in terms of i\ni guess kind of what i'm hearing soren\nis like\nwhen i think about so\nwhat exactly happened with the\nkindergarten thing what did they do\nthey like move through me over the fence\nyeah and so i didn't quite unders\ni couldn't quite paint a picture in my\nmind but like when i think about\nso i was bullied a lot growing up too\nand if i had to describe one word i'd\nnever thought about bullying this way\nbut if i had to describe like one word\nif i had to pick one word to describe\nhow i felt it was weak\num yeah\nso like this is where you know i i feel\nlike i'm really leading more than\nfollowing in this interview which is\nlike arguably a mistake because\ngenerally speaking like i should like\nlisten to what you have to say and then\nlike form a hypothesis but\ni'm seeing like a pretty clear chain\nhere\nand it may be hard i could be wrong\nbecause i'm really not doing a good job\ni'm not\nfollowing the rules of normally how i\napproach this but\ni i mean here's what i'm hearing from\nyou soren is that like you carry this\nlike fear of weakness\nwith you and that like you\nwon't relent at all for\nfear of like being back in the pit like\nyou're not gonna go back there ever\never no one's ever gonna throw you over\nthe fence you're never gonna be weak\nthey're never like\nlike it's never gonna happen\nlike you've been there before and you\nand and this kind of comes back to the\nquestion of i think\nyou've paid a price to be where you are\nand that price is having that skull on\nyour on your piano\nright it's like if i ask yeah\ndo you think that this is something i\ncan change or do you think this is just\nhow my\nlife has shaped me to be do you want to\nchange it\num\ni don't know i mean i like\ni like who i am i think you do\nyeah i don't know so you said\nis this something you can change or is\nthis something that your life has shaped\nyou to be i don't think that's an either\nor question i think both are true\nso i think you've been shaped this way\nfor better or for worse and can you\nchange it absolutely\nbut i think in order to change it you\nhave to do something that you really\ndon't want to do which is that you have\nto take\nyou have to like schedule your ceo\nmeetings during the week\nright and i think what we what's really\nholding you back is i i don't i don't\nreally and this could be me being\nignorant right so i i really don't\nknow what your team functions like but\ni've like i understand the inside of\ni think a few professional law\norganizations\nand and i've seen this a lot like i'm\ni've seen this everywhere\nlike i've seen this in investment\nbanking i've seen and i just don't\ni just don't think physiologically that\nlike not taking a day off\nin four months leads to the best\nperformance\nwould you this is kind of separate from\nthe whole conversation\nmore practical but for me i'm really\nbalancing like do i want to have some\nmore free time\nin my day-to-day in my work days or do i\nwant to have more workload in the work\ndays and then have\nhave this day off that i can kind of\ncall mine i think that's\nthe wrong way to think about it\noh okay right so i i think i think it's\ngoing to be challenging but\nand i think the real thing is that your\nreal barrier i think is actually\nemotional because i think that like you\ndon't\nwant to feel weak like you want to feel\nlike you're not letting people down like\nthe possibility\ni think you i know it sounds weird you\nknow like\nif you set a limit on how much you do\nand like you let your team down as a\nresult\nhow would you feel about that\nyeah but i would just feel awful\nwhy um\nhmm\njust because\num yeah i don't know i think they\ndeserve better\ni think what do you deserve\nwork work has always been a just a big\npart of my life\nsure so i would probably feel\nit's always been my north star to kind\nof do better at\ni don't even really call it work but i\nwould do better as a player better as\nkind of a part of this team uh\nso if i was to not put in my full effort\ni think i would\nprobably lose\nkind of part of who i am or my identity\nyeah so i think that's a challenge so a\nsword i'm going to talk about something\nand i i don't know if is this useful is\nthis conversation useful to you i mean\nwould you rather be crying right now\nbecause we can make that happen no i\nmean i had a few opportunities to cry\nbut i\nlaughed it off instead i i mean i feel\nlike this is this is really important\nbecause i think like\nso a lot of times when i work with\npeople who are very successful\nlike we talk about letting go of\nambition\nand and they sort of say like it's\nambition that's gotten me this far\nlike i don't understand like if i let go\nso like a good example is like\nlike i work with a lot of people in\ninvestment banking\nand so those people like these people\nlike work really really hard like they\nwere\ncrazy hours you know it's like like big\nbig deals like 100 million dollar deals\nbillion dollar deals\nand and they're they sort of like it's\nalways like there's always more to do\nthere's always a promotion there's\nalways another deal\nand it's ambition that's gotten them\nthis far\nand so they get really really concerned\nthat if i let go of my ambition like\ni'll be nothing like this is who i am\nright like you're someone who likes\nsoren i think you're never\ngonna be weak again like to hell with\nthat\nlike you would never put yourself in\nthat situation\ni think that the challenge here is that\nyou know if you look at the physiology\nof performance\nand there's been a lot of work on on\nthis kind of stuff like having high\nlevels of cortisol\na stress hormone which i imagine is\ngoing to be higher in your system when\nyou're\nworking for four months without a break\nis going to lead to\nless creative decision making so when\ncortisol is floating around in your\nsystem and adrenaline is floating around\nin your system these are stress hormones\nthat we release more of\nwhen we work way too much it actually\nreduces your capacity for creative\nthinking\nbecause when the way that our brains\nevolved like\nwhen our fight or flight system is\ninvolved like we don't want creative\nthinking like when i run into a tiger in\nthe woods\ni don't want to think creatively like my\nbody needs to act\nso like nuance gets lost and everything\nbecomes black and white\nand i don't think and it's interesting\nbecause we started off talking about\nsort of this feeling of autopilot and\nawareness\nthat decays throughout the season and\nyou say to me like oh yeah we have it at\nthe beginning i can think creatively but\nthen we fall into the grind\ni think it's absolutely physiologically\nor neuroscientifically\nbecause literally as the season advances\nyour\nyour brain is going to change\nand and so i know this sounds absolutely\ninsane but like when i talk to these\npeople and i'm like yeah you don't need\nto be striving for a promotion\nto be doing your best work and they're\nreally confused because they think that\nlike\nif i'm not striving for a promotion i\ndon't know how to work\nand the beautiful thing is that they i\nmean oftentimes they wind up in my\noffice because\nyou know things need to change\nand then and then we kind of get to the\npoint where i teach them how to let go\nof their ambition and they do\nwonderfully\nbecause i i think it sounds kind of\nweird but they're like other reasons for\nyou to work than ambition\nand there are things that you can do\nlike your loyalty to your team not\nwanting to let them down\nneeds to be separated from your personal\nfeelings of weakness\ndoes that make sense\nyeah i can't say i know how to do that\nbut yep so\nand and that's why we're not going to\ncrying rap because i'd like to teach you\ntoday and for everyone else\nwho like beats themselves up to try to\nbe something\nbecause there's a huge difference\nbetween not letting your team down\nand you feeling personally weak and i\nknow it sounds kind of bizarre but it's\nmy\nthere's a hypothesis i don't know if\nthis is right or wrong that you\nletting go of your feelings of weakness\nwill actually be like\nwill allow you to be the best coach for\nyour team\nyeah i agree i definitely feel like i\ndon't know this is related but\nsometimes i definitely do feel like uh\ni'm too focused and worried about myself\nwhen i should really be putting all my\nfocus on\non the players yeah that's really tricky\nbecause you're gonna just\nput i mean you're gonna find any reason\nto beat yourself up so like i take that\nwith a grain of salt\nright like like i i think the number of\nways in which you have thought through\nthat you can be better\nis tricky because i think that's the\nproblem on the one hand you're\nabsolutely correct but on the other hand\nlike why aren't you good enough\nwas that an actual question yeah\nwhy am i not good enough yeah\ni don't really think i have an answer to\nthat do you feel not good enough\nuh i mean it just goes kind of back to\nwhere we\nback to the beginning right i feel like\ni can be better\ni feel like i'm learning do you need to\nbe better\nyeah why\nto serve my team and my players better\ncan i think about that for a second sure\nlet me put it this way and i don't know\nhow much progress we're going to make\nhere\nare you enough for your team\num\nthe way that i am yes um\nno i don't think so\nhow would you know if you were\n[Music]\ni don't think i would know which is why\ni say i don't think so i don't i don't\nknow for a fact\nright so what if i told you i'm just i'm\ngonna i'm gonna say something\nand i want to know what your instinctive\nreaction is to these words\nyou're enough for your team you're\nexactly what your team needs\nin the way that you are in this moment\nyou don't need to be\nany better than what you are\nit's hard hard for me to believe that\nthat's a very\nsugar-coated response what what did you\nthink\nwhat were you thinking is that what did\nyou think and feel as i said those words\nwhat did i think and feel\nuh that\nthat it was very nice of you but that\nthat you don't really know\nthere cuz you don't know how i work you\ndon't see my work\nyep and if i did see what would i notice\nwhat is it that i don't know about you\nsoren that you do\nuh i mean i don't even know yet\nof course there are a lot of things that\ni know i can do better and then there's\nthe things that i'm kind of yet to\ndiscover yeah so this is tricky but i'm\ngoing to\ntry to say this one more time like if i\nknew you\nthe way that you know yourself soren\nwhat would i\nwhat's the difference right because i i\ncan tell that like when i said that what\ni saw in your eyes was\nthis guy has no [ __ ] idea what he's\ntalking about\nright so tell me what i don't know\nwhat do you not know what are you\num i don't really know how to answer\nthat question\nnot knowing how to answer that question\nis different from\nlike there's something i'm missing right\nbecause for me to say that it's like\nignorance\ndoes that make sense like yeah\nyeah i mean so educate me\neducate you what am i ignorant of\nwhat part of you don't i understand what\nam i missing\nwell i'm thinking more in relation to to\nmy work right\nsure\num\nyeah i guess just i feel like i can\ni feel like i can always do more and i\ncan always work harder\nwhich is maybe not what you want to hear\nbut\nyeah so i think that what we're getting\ninto is a is a conflict because i think\nyou're\nlike i think you have to unsugar coat it\nto be able to say it\nso so let me let me let me this i'm not\ntrying to hide anything i'm just\ni i i don't think you are i think it's\njust gonna be tough\nright so maybe i'm barking up the wrong\ntree but like\ni can tell so the reason that i said\nthat is because i know you're gonna have\nlike\nwhen i said like i think you are enough\nright like i think you're fine by your\nplayers by the way have you ever talked\nto your players about whether\nthey feel like you're letting them down\n[Music]\nno what do you think about having a\nconversation like that\n[Laughter]\num\nyeah i don't really know i feel like\nmost of them would just be\nbe really nice about it what does that\nmean be\nreally nice about it\noh sorry i'm just i need to answer a\nmessage from my manager\nokay um\ni think if i was to ask a question like\nam i letting you down i think that\nobviously if someone was to ask me that\nit would kind of seem like they need\nreassurance\nso i would probably give them\nreassurance maybe i would\nyeah i guess that's just how i feel\nokay so\nhow would they signal to you if they\nreally thought you were not letting\nthem down what could they say to you\nthat would convince you that they think\nyou're doing a fantastic job and they're\nhappy to have you\n[Music]\ndo you mind repeating that yeah so like\nhow would they signal to you so like\nlet's say so\nhere's what what okay let's just take a\nstep back start from the top\nokay so it's my belief that you have\na sense of inadequacy that\nkeeps you striving to be the best but is\npersonally like tortures you\nlike i think it's got to be like a hard\nway to live your life where you wake up\nlike somewhat content\nyou're like ah let me sleep in and then\nyou see that skull\nand the skull is like [ __ ] you get out\nof bed\nweakling right\nyou're like on the days that i'm really\ntired i look at the skull\nand it reminds me that i need to be\nbetter in that i'm not good enough\nand so okay fine so then i turn to you\nand i say something\nabsolutely idiotic which is soren i\nthink you're fantastic just the way that\nyou are\nand you're like this [ __ ] guy that's\nhis job he sees the best in everyone\nright it's his job to like accept people\nbut he doesn't\nunderstand\nright totally understand like that's\nfair it's completely fair i don't\ni don't know you bro i'm missing\nsomething\nit's my job to see the best in everyone\nand there's like something in you that\nis clearly not the best\nfine i accept that too because i don't\nknow you you're right\nthen i ask you so fill me in tell me\nhelp me understand what it is about you\nthat i don't know\nyou have a lot of trouble answering that\nbecause there's like\nif we think about it like you can't\nprotest\nagainst my statement unless there's\nsomething like because\nyour your your protest is like quite\nstrong\nand so i think that like it's like pit\nsoaring down there that's like you\ndidn't see me when i got tossed over the\nfence into the kindergarten\nthen you had to like walk through the\n[ __ ] kindergarten back to your school\nlike\nyou know like that's pathetic man\nand yeah right so i think that that like\nleaves a scar and i think this is the\nscar that we're running up against\nand now we get into a real problem\nbecause\nyour adaptation to that scar is\nresponsible for your success\nit's the work ethic it's the the\nconstant feeling that you could be\nbetter\nand like like that's what's gotten you\nto where you are\nand so fair i don't know your team i\ndon't know league of legends\ni'm a noob fine i don't know you fine\nright because the response that i heard\nwhen i said i think you're good enough\nis you don't know me\nlike you don't you don't really know you\ndon't know what you're talking about\nfine so there's something there about\nyou that is not good enough fine\nso then let's let's turn to someone who\ndoes know right like because your\nteammates know\nlike they're your teammates like they\nknow whether you're doing a good job\nthey know whether you're doing enough\nand and then we get to the real crux of\nthe problem is that like if you go to\nthem and you say like\nam i doing enough like what are they\ngonna see they're gonna see someone\nwho's weak\nwho needs reassurance and they're gonna\nsay\nyeah no so uh soren you're doing great\nman\noh man you're so handsome\nyou're so smart right like that's\nlike you feel like you're gonna be like\nlike now i'm almost getting like like\nthey're gonna put you in the special\nschool all over again like they can't\nthey can't give it to you straight\nand so the two things that i'd point out\nto you is first like how would you know\nright if they actually did think that\nyou did an awesome job\nand that like like because i i'm i can\nalmost i can\ni'm pretty sure if i had the opportunity\nto talk to them this is what they'd say\nthat your work ethic is amazing that\nyou're an inspiration\nand that like they're really optimistic\nbecause like you're on their team\nand that they think you're doing a\nfantastic job\nlike i would i would give you ten to one\nodds that that's what they would say\nand now the problem is like now i'm\ngonna point out to you like where the\nproblem is is like how are you gonna\nknow like how are you gonna know if\nyou're enough\neven if they tell you if i tell you like\nno as many people as you want to\ncan tell you but as long as that voice\nis there\ndiscounting and undermining everything\nall of the signals\nthat get sent your way this is not going\nto change\nand what i'm talking about is like a\nradical change\nthis is reshaping who you are\nit's like accepting that you actually\nare enough today and you can do more\ntomorrow don't worry\nyou don't have to let go of being better\ntomorrow\nbut what i want to let i want you to\nwhat i want you to do is let go of like\nfeeling fundamentally not good enough\nbecause i suspect that like in other\nparts of your life too\nyou know and i don't know how much to\nread into his ex-girlfriend but\nyou know in other parts of your life too\nlike i'm afraid that there may be\nsituations where you are\nactually fully adequate but you don't\nfeel that way\nthat that is actually on point yeah\nin my relationship i often felt like i\nwas not\nor i felt like she was dissatisfied with\nme a lot even though\nthen she would tell me i am satisfied\nwith you\nbut maybe like there's this thing or\nthis thing but those things would\nhit me very hard so so this is what i\nsee in in people\nwho like have what you have\nis that they become self-fulfilling\nprophecies\nso like when someone feels inadequate in\na relationship\ntheir partner will tell them no i\nactually really like being\nwith you but their mind will latch on to\nthe 10\nof what their partner says instead of\nthe 90 i really do want to be with you\nand of course you're not perfect and\nthen your mind is like there it is\nlet's let's shove aside the 90 of\ncontentment and\nand zero in on the 10 and that actually\nbecomes a self-fulfilling prophecy\nwe see this as well in people who have a\nfear of abandonment where like they\nthink like they're\nthey tell their partner or the they're\nafraid that their partner is going to\nleave them\npartners like no i'm not going to leave\nyou like i like being in this relation\nthey're like you're going to leave\nlike no i'm not and then like they tell\nthem like you're gonna leave i know\nyou're gonna leave\nyou didn't text me back who are you with\nyou're gonna leave me\nyou're gonna leave me you're gonna leave\nme i have i i have also had that in a\nrelationship and i did at the\nrecord right and it's like it becomes a\nself-fulfilling prophecy\nso i think like soren you're playing a\nrigged game man\nand it all cut like it doesn't matter\nlike who you hear it from\nhow qualified there are like even if you\nheard it from the ceo you're like he\ndoesn't\nknow right like like if if your ceo is\nlike\nhey i saw and i think you're doing a\nfantastic job like\nyou'd be like he doesn't see what i do\nday to day\nthat voice is always do you see the\nvoice that i'm talking about that's\njust like always there\nyeah so do you\nwant that to change is that voice a bad\nthing\n[Music]\ni guess my worry is if i don't have that\nvoice\ni always had the feeling that if i ever\nlost my drive i just shouldn't be in\nthis\nline of work because this line of work\nis like\nstriving to be the very very best and\nyou have to make sacrifices to do that\nso i guess part of my worry is if i was\nto lose that\ni don't think i would find as much joy\nout of this work and then i would have\nto find something else to do and i\ndon't know what that would be so i\ndisagree with that completely\nso i understand where you're coming from\nit just hasn't been my experience\nat all so can i can i try to convince\nyou for a moment\nsure so\ni get what you're saying that like this\nvoice is what drives you forward\nright and this is why i asked you at the\nvery beginning and you asked me to you\nwere like is this a bad thing\nthen i asked you do you want to get rid\nof it and i don't think you do\nand that's the problem so like when i\nask you like do you want to be fulfilled\ni don't think you do\nlike i think that any time you you have\nlike\nlike i don't see you like ever relaxing\nlike even when you win right i am i'm\nreally afraid of\ncomplacency because i've seen\n[Music]\ni've seen i've been playing i have what\ni had\nand i could have continued to play if i\nwanted to i won the\nthe north american season before i i\nchose to go into coaching\nand i played professionally for i think\neight years and i saw\njust so many players find success and\nthen\nbecome comfortable and then eventually\nuh stop playing because\nthey kind of lost their drive\nand i understand that so i i think\nthough\nsoren you're not them i'm not worried\nabout you losing your drive\nand i actually think that like the best\nthat the best performance you're gonna\nsee\nby all means grind by all means work a\nlot like i'm not telling you to like not\nwork\nbut i think that the best like\nliterally like neuroscientifically and\nlike\noptimizing performance wise when you're\noperating from a place of like positive\nenergy and positive emotion you're\nactually going to outperform\nwhat you're capable of with like\nnegative energy and negative emotion\ni do want to say i feel like before\nkobet i was\ncloser to that uh living a kind of more\nbalanced lifestyle\ni think covetous definitely maybe\nbrought out the worst in that because\nwe were also in a really strict bubble\nsystem in order to stay safe right so i\nwas only at my apartment\nand at the office i didn't see any\nfriends for six months\nwell even longer obviously like for it\nso it's just kind of all my time has\nreally gone into\nworking which probably um\nstrengthens these feelings so\nthat makes me think even more so that\nlike\nletting go of some of these feelings is\ngoing to be a step forward for you\nbecause if if in a high stress\nenvironment these feelings are getting\nworse like generally speaking like\ndepression and anxiety and all that\nstuff is getting worse during coconut\nso it's not like your optimal function\nit's like\nit's almost like a coping mechanism it's\nlike it's like your internal cheat code\nto keep working\nand something tells me that like\nyou know i'm not seriously i'm not\nsaying slack off but i don't think\nyou're gonna slack off i don't think we\nhave to worry about you slacking off\nlike i don't think that\nif this changed in you emotionally i\nthink there's too much\nprogramming in your brain your neurons\nhave wired a certain way to where you're\nnot going to just like wake up and do\nnothing\nlike it's just not who you are\nand what's going to change then or what\nwhat could change them\nit's a good question um\nso i think that like like i was saying\nthere are a couple of feelings that are\ntangled up here\none is like striving to be the best one\nis not wanting to let your team down\nand the third is like feeling weak or\ninadequate\nwhat i'm saying is that i don't think\nthat all three of those have to like go\ntogether\nright like you can care about your\nteammates you can want to not let them\ndown\nbut also recognize that like you are\ngood enough\nthat together as a team you guys can\nactually do this\nthat you don't have to worry like you\nshouldn't be worrying about\nlike whether you're good enough or not\nlike you've got no head space for that\nyou should be focused like fully on your\nteam like you said you kind of think a\nlittle bit about yourself too much\nbecause i know it sounds weird but i\nmean if we're talking about\nself-fulfilling prophecies in\nrelationships\nthat could happen in the professional\nspace too\nand the real problem here at the end of\nthe day sort i think the real problem is\nthat you don't\nlike you can't ever know what's right\nand what isn't\nright like you can't ever know like\nwhat's gonna be enough if i tell you\nyou're not gonna listen if your\nteammates tell you that you're not gonna\nlisten\nso like if there was some objective\nmeasure of your enoughness then i'd say\nthis is a whole different ballgame\nbut in the absence of that like your\nmind is always going to tell you that\nyou're not enough\nit's not enough that you need to be\nbetter and you can love your teammates\nyou can want to like lead them to\nvictory\nbut like being fundamentally faithless\nin yourself which i'm using\nlike exaggerated language here is like\nnot gonna be\nand now we're falling into another chat\nbecause now i'm telling you that you you\nthat you need to be better\nbut you know like fundamentally\nbelieving that you are good enough\nfundamentally believing that you are\nwhat your team\nneeds can lead to hubris or pride or\ncomplacency\nbut i think in your case at the highest\nlevels of performance sorin\ni think it starts to become maladaptive\nthat for 99\nof the road the work ethic that you've\ngot in the emotions that you've got\nand feeling not good enough is going to\nget you 99\nof the way there but if you want to walk\nthat last step you have to let go of\nthis\nwhat do you think\n[Music]\num\nuh i agree and\ni have come up\nmaybe against these kinds of things with\nwith a therapist\nand they're just so\ndeeply rooted that i i don't know where\nto begin\nyou know okay so\nwe can i'm glad you see a therapist by\nthe way that's good um\nso let me now now let's let's do this\ntogether\nokay so if you're with me like where i i\ndon't have an answer for you so we're\ngonna have to figure this out together\nokay what do you think about that\nsure i hear one of the tales but\nokay so so let's think about the\nconundrum so here i am telling you that\nyou need to accept yourself\nmore and that you are good enough right\nand really feeding into my thing that\nyou're telling me that\nif i change something i can be even\nbetter yeah exactly exactly that\nso that's the problem so what what what\ndo we\nwhat do we do about that because even if\ni try to tell you to move in the right\ndirection i'm actually falling into your\ntrap you're the one who's trapped me\nyeah i mean i honestly have no idea\nwhere to begin\nwell sorry i was i was coming up at a\npoint where\ni was learning more so to kind of accept\nand understand myself rather than trying\nto change\nyeah so so then then then i think that\nsounds right\num so but then then i guess then what we\ni have a practical answer for you but i\njust want to appreciate the conundrum\nthat we're in here which is that\neither you accept yourself where you are\nand then you don't strive to be better\nwhich is sort of i guess winning\nor i'm telling you hey like you need to\nlearn how to accept yourself which is\nlike\nyou don't does that make it it's like it\ndoesn't it was stuck\nright so if we truly accept you then\nwhat we should say is\nsoren you should continue not accepting\nyourself\nthat is acceptance\nyeah right and then if if we say like\nsorry you need to learn how to accept\nyourself that was very convenient for me\nright so or i can say soren you need to\nyou need to learn how to accept yourself\nwhich isn't of itself\nnot accepting yourself\nso we're stuck so the good news is that\nthere's actually like a really simple\nway to move forward and i think\nyou're well along this path the first is\njust to notice\nthe absurdity of what we're talking\nabout it's dumb\nthe whole thing is unsolvable\nokay and i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut every time you notice that feeling\nin you\nthat you need to be better and then if\nyou move towards saying like oh i\nshouldn't feel this way\nthat's wrong and if you blindly follow\nit that's wrong too\nso like what we really need is simply\njust awareness\nto recognize that like either path we go\ndown is wrong\nand so if we don't go down a path like\nwhat do we do\nlike if i'm not moving like so you're\nsaying if i walk down this path it's\nwrong if i walk down this path it's\nwrong\nso what are my options then\ni don't know it's it's weird so\ndo nothing with awareness\nright just notice i know it's weird but\njust like\nnotice the conundrum within you and on a\nmuch more\npractical level there are going to be\ntimes in your life\nwhere you're gonna feel like taking\nyou know an hour off to\ndo like meet with the ceo you're gonna\nfeel weak\nlike you should be able to handle it\ndoes that make sense\nyeah like throughout your week very\npractically there are going to be times\nwhere you feel weak\nwhere you feel inadequate where you're\nafraid of holding everyone back\nand so a lot of your actions and your\nschedule\nhas been structured based on those\nnegative emotions\nof fear and inadequacy and things like\nthat does that make sense\nso this is going to be tough for you\nsoren it's going to be very hard\nbut don't give in to those negative\nemotions\nright and what i mean by that is notice\nthat like like if you schedule a meeting\nwith your manager\nduring practice you're gonna feel like\nyou're letting your team down\nand this is where like honestly what i\nwould recommend i'm gonna give you like\na very simple straight\nstraight playbook so you go to your team\nand and you should have a conversation\nwith them about hey we meet for practice\neight hours a day\ni have some other obligations as coach\ni've got to meet with this person and\nthis person\nhow would you all feel about me taking\nsome of those meetings in the middle of\npractice and then like the assistant\ncoach\nlike how would you guys feel if i missed\nlike an hour or two of practice a day\nokay that sounds extremely uncomfortable\nyup\nthere it is what are you feeling right\nnow\nweek because if i was the player i would\nsay\ndon't you have x amount of hours before\nand after practice to do those things\nwhy do you need to do it in the middle\nof practice\nokay sure so if that's what they say\nthen you're going to listen to them\nwell that's what i would tell myself but\nyeah\nright so so so and and this is what like\nlike i think you've got\nto like like listen to your team\nright and say like do i need to be here\ni mean i'm assuming you guys you don't\nhow many hours a week do you all i don't\nwant to like ask you too many details\nabout what your practice schedule is and\nstuff like that\nbecause that could be like competitive\ninformation but i'm assuming that\nyou know you guys are basically\npracticing like six days a week\num\n[Music]\nthe schedule is it's kind of different\nnow so we have actually\nthree match days and then one off day\nand then we have uh\nthree practice days okay\nduring season so so if it's if it's\nduring season maybe you need to crunch\nthings too so i'm willing to concede\nthat like if you guys\nhave three match days and three practice\ndays maybe you don't want to miss any of\nthat\nbut i think it's worthwhile like having\na conversation with your team\nand like this is the whole point is that\nyou can't let your feelings of weakness\ndetermine what's right or wrong\nand if if it's season maybe you don't\nhave time to\nbecause that sounds super tight to me\nlike i don't i'm not hearing there's\nactually a whole lot of time\nso it's really difficult yeah but we\ndon't have as much\nnear as much practice as we used to be\nable to do so so then the question is\nlike do you need to be meeting with your\nceo like\nduring this time\nuh\nuh i'm not sure okay so so so i i\nwhat i'm hearing from you sauron is that\nthat like really if you guys have three\nmatch days and like one day of practice\nbetween matches that really doesn't\nsound like there's a whole lot of time\nto do anything else\nyeah so i'm i know that sounds kind of\nanti-climactic but i think i'm going to\nhave to\ntake a step back from what i was saying\nearlier\nbecause that really does sound quite\ndifferent to me um\nbut i i still think the general like\nidea of of\nyou know not letting the sensation of\nlike and in that case i i think the\nreason that\nyou know you shouldn't scale back is not\nbecause you feel weak but because\nthere's actually like a necessity\nyou guys have eight hours of practice\nbut essentially it sounds like you guys\nhave one day of practice before a match\num monday we have a day off and then\ntuesday wednesday thursday we practice\nand then we have\nfriday saturday sunday three matches in\na row oh i see\nso that's so yeah it still sounds super\ntight from a scheduling standpoint\nso i i know it sounds kind of i've been\ntrying to avoid asking you details of\nyour schedule just for\nlike that's everyone's practice\nschedules okay\num yeah i'm gonna have to accept some\nsome teams that\nobviously don't take an off day\nsometimes or push the\ntraining schedule longer on some other\ndays because we have less practice days\nand things like that but\ni'm trying to figure out how to salvage\nmy argument because i i feel like i just\ntorpedoed it\num so i still think that there's like\na broader point here i don't know about\nthis particular schedule\nbut i'm getting the sense that you're\nstill motivated by a lot of like feeling\ninadequate what do you think about that\n[Music]\nyeah i think so so i i think your road\nforward is still the same in this\nparticular instance i don't think\nit and i i i don't know if this makes\nsense but\ni still don't think that the reason you\nsh so you shouldn't meet with your ceo\non a tuesday wednesday thursday that\nmakes perfect sense to me\nat the same time i think the reason you\nshouldn't meet with them\nis not because you feel weak but it's\nlike literally you just don't have time\nbecause you've got to work\ndo you understand how there's a\ndifference there\n[Music]\nkind of but there is time\nthere is time for what\ni could have a meeting do you think that\nthat would\nwhat would be the cost of that meeting\nif you met with the ceo on tuesday\njust kind of the flexibility of my\ntime i guess those days where we end up\npractice\nit differs but maybe the average\npractice day we ended like 6 30 or seven\nand then i am kind of flexible to\ndo i want to stay at the office and work\ndo i want to\nrelax and hang out with my players and\nstaff do i want to go home but if i have\nthat meeting then\nno matter kind of how i feel maybe how\nhow stressed i am on the day i have to\ndo this thing\nit's nice to have more flexibility\nbecause some practice days are\nare really hard and really taxing okay\nso i i think that that makes sense that\nyou want flexibility so let me ask you\nthis have you noticed\nanything in your schedule that is driven\nby the sense\nof feeling like if you didn't do that\nyou would be weak\nif i didn't do that i would be weak\nsorry do you mind asking one more time\nyeah sorry i i think we're kind of\ngetting like lost in the weeds here but\nlike here's the general\ni was hoping that there was an easy\napplication\nbut upon hearing what your schedule is\nlike i don't think there is but here's\nmy general idea okay\nand and maybe we won't find a specific\nthing but\nso in your role as head coach you have\ncertain like work responsibilities which\nare necessities\nright like you have to show up for\npractice you need to strategize you guys\nneed to figure out what heroes you're\ngonna pick\nyou have to like watch replays from like\nthe matches that you have coming up\nlike all that stuff is like necessary i\ntotally get that\nwhat i'm hearing from you and i'm pretty\nsure that this is sort of like\na theme that we've sort of uncovered is\nthat at times\nyour actions are not motivated by the\nnecessity of the job and if you really\ntunnel down and you become highly aware\nyou'll notice that they're not actually\nthey make look like what is necessary in\nthe job\nbut really what it is is you feel\nlike you would be weak or you'd be\nletting your players down\nif you like\ndidn't do this thing so some actions are\nmotivated by necessity and some actions\nare motivated by avoiding feeling weak\nyeah i think the that kind of gray area\na lot of it for me is how much i'm\nstudying\nthe other regions play because there's\nan infinite amount of games from other\nregions\nthat's really where i think as a coach\nyou can really\nput in the hours and\nthere's not a necessity for me to watch\nall the games because it's simply not\npossible\nbut i think that's where\na lot of the times i feel inadequate if\ni'm not up to date if i don't if i\ndidn't watch the matches from last night\num\nyeah i think that's probably one of the\nbigger ones that come to mind\nyeah so that that's i think that's a\ngreat example because that's something\nwhere like you could do work and it's\nreasonable for you to do work\nbut i don't know exactly how you find\nthis i think it's going to be through\nsome self-reflection\nbut right now you somehow decide how\nmuch to watch\nright like there's some internal\ncalculus that on week to week like you\neither watch a lot or you watch less or\nwhatever\n[Music]\nyeah it's kind of a difficult thing it's\none of those things that i i haven't\nreally been able to balance\ni'll watch a lot and then maybe i will\nkind of burn out and then need to take\nmore time and then i will barely watch\nand i can't find this healthy\nexactly exactly so now i feel like this\nis salvageable\nbecause i think that that pattern of\nburnout or\nlike a ton of work followed by burnout\nis a hundred percent\nwhat you see when someone is driven by a\nnegative emotion\nright because you're beating yourself up\nyou're like i'm inadequate i need to\nwatch more i need to watch more i need\nto watch more\nand then you actually burn yourself out\nand then you don't watch and this is\nwhat i'm saying in\nin terms of optimizing performance is\nthat\nif you pay attention to that feeling\nthat drives you to watch to the point of\nburnout\nand you don't let that control you on\nbalance i'd say\nfour out of five people that find a way\nto balance that the way to balance it is\nactually your feeling of inadequacy at\nthe beginning because that's what's\ndriving you to burn out in the first\nplace\nyeah and so if you can oh\nbecome aware of that feeling of\ninadequacy and\nand not be driven by it then you\nactually won't burn out\nand if you won't burn out you'll\nactually end up watching more matches\nmore productively than you would in the\nway that you are right now\nyeah i agree 100 so the key there is\ngoing to be that like\nsort of deciding like how like sort of\nfrom a\ntranquil state of mind how many hours of\nthings you're going to watch\nand once you sort of make like an\ninitial determination\nif you feel inadequate in the middle\nyou have to try really hard to at least\nbe aware of that\nand then ask yourself this question\nbecause remember whether you if you\ndon't watch the game we're screwed and\nif you do watch the game you're screwed\nbut just ask you know that's the paradox\nwe were talking about just ask yourself\nam i watching this game because i feel\ninadequate\nam i watching this game because i feel\nlike i'd be letting my team down\neven though i don't feel like watching\nit even though i'm tired\nam i doing this because i don't you know\nbecause of that feeling the skull\ndo you think you could ask yourself that\nquestion\nand when when the answer is inevitably\nsometimes going to be that i am doing it\nbecause of those things and what i do\nwhat do you think you do\nuh\n[Music]\nsomething i've been trying to do more\nrecently is just\nkind of sit with those feelings more\ngood\nthat's the right thing yeah so like i\nknow it sounds weird but whether you\nwatch the game this is what's really\nconfusing for a lot of people about like\nself-growth\nthe actual action you take at the end of\nthe day is not rewiring the neurons\nwhat rewires the neurons is asking\nyourself the question and being able to\nauthentically answer it\ni know it sounds really weird but as\nlong as you ask yourself the question\nand authentically answer it you will\nmove one step closer to balance\nbecause on some days your mind is gonna\nactually generate the thought and it'll\nsay\nyou know what you can take a break\nand on other days it's gonna be like you\nknow what you really can't deserve to\ntake\nyou don't deserve to take a break you\nneed to watch this and we can't know\nwhich one your mind is gonna produce and\nit's actually fine\neither one it produces is okay the key\nthing is asking yourself the question\nand coming up with an authentic\nawareness\nof what's driving you\nthat makes sense yeah\nthoughts questions about today\ni know things got super abstract and\nconfusing there at the end\nso sorry about that no no that that was\nreally helpful\nbecause i\ni am definitely aware that i didn't have\na healthy relationship with\nthat aspect of my work especially\nand then one last thought\nis when it comes to social relationships\nthings like that\nor like you know non-professional things\ni would encourage you to pay a lot of\nattention once again to that feeling of\ninadequacy\nright and try to figure out like you\nknow what which of your actions is being\ndriven by that feeling\nand the more that you become aware of it\nthe more it'll start to dissolve\nand then the last question that i'll\nleave you with which is i think\nultimately soaring the one that you're\ngonna have to answer for yourself and\nthis is for everyone listening to\nif you feel inadequate you really have\nto pay be careful\nabout how you respond\nto people that tell you otherwise\nright because i think the biggest issue\nhere is that like\nyou don't it's a lose-lose situation\nlike no matter like if if your teammates\nsay like yeah like you're doing\nfantastic you're gonna swat that down\nif i say it you're gonna swat that down\nsometimes people like the people that we\ncare about us like when we're feeling\ninadequate we'll swat down what they say\nand you really have to like understand\nwhere that comes from\nlike why are you so quick to swat down\nwhat other people say\nyeah definitely when i used to get\ncompliments i would\npretty much answer in like uh\nthanks but you don't know me yeah but i\nlearned the socially acceptable thing is\njust to\neven even if i don't truly believe it to\nstill\nyep well to try not to show that because\nthat's a very disrespectful thing to\nshow yeah so i understand that you\nlearned socially what to say but then\nthe question is like\nlike what not on the inside and i think\nit's hard for you to answer this but\nlike what is it that\nwe don't know about you right when you\nsay when your mind says you don't know\nme\nit implies there's something inside you\nthat people don't know like they don't\nknow something about you\nbut when i ask you what that thing is\nlike i'm not\nhearing anything no i've\ni've definitely made a lot of progress\nin when people\ngive me a compliment or say nice things\nabout me that a lot of the time i i do\ngenuinely believe it\nwhereas maybe\nfive years ago i would never yeah so so\ni don't i don't feel\nconstantly inadequate yeah yeah um\nyeah i i i hope i didn't give\nyou the impression that i feel that\nthat's how you feel oh no that that's\nthat is how i felt in the past yeah i'm\njust saying that\nit's not that i always have that\nresponse so like oh you don't know me\nyou don't know what's wrong with me\nuh so so here's what i've\nfound when people have that kind of\nresponse like you don't know me\nthe more you tunnel down and look where\nthat response comes\nfrom the more it dissolves\nbecause usually that response like is a\nleftover emotion\nfrom a traumatic experience earlier in\nyour life\nit's like you carry that sense of\ninadequacy or like\nlike imagine what you were taught to\nbelieve\nabout yourself between the fourth and\neighth grade\nlike the sense of identity and so like\nwhat happens is when someone compliments\nyou is that\npart of your identity which was formed\nback then\nkind of like rises to the surface and\ntries to swat down the compliment\nwhereas now like like how old are you\nsoren ballpark\n25 okay so like when we look at soren\nlike 25 year old sorin who's won the\nnorth american championships and is\nyou know head coach and all this other\ngood stuff like that person has\na lot of authentic reasons to feel good\nabout themselves\nand to feel proud of what they've\naccomplished and things like that\nbut inside you there's also like eighth\ngrade soren who gets\nchucked over the wall and like that\necho the echo of that identity is what\nrebels against\nthe compliment and the more you tunnel\ndown and you say why am i swatting this\ncompliment away the more you look for it\nyou're actually not going to find an\nanswer\nit's just going to be that feeling and\nthe more you do that process of looking\nfor why you're swatting down the\ncompliment\nthe less that feeling the more that\nfeeling will kind of go down\nand then you'll be kind of like go walk\naround not feeling\nyou know like occasionally like you're\nweak like it emerges at times right\nit's like open up weakness.exe and then\nit runs for five minutes and then it\ncloses down\nokay yeah that's really helpful\nthoughts questions\num yeah this is really\ninsightful thanks for having me on the\nstream\nguess what i'm thinking\nwhat i'm saying oh he's just saying that\nto be nice\nno no definitely not\noh i mean that was part of what i was i\nguess what a lot of people\nhope for when they talk to you and i'll\ndefinitely have to go back and re-watch\nand\nthink a little bit more about this stuff\nyou seem to have a very contemplative\nface so i had some trouble kind of\nreading where you are right now can you\nhelp me understand like where you are\nright now\ncontemplative face yeah you are you have\na thinking face\nyou seem to be thinking a lot\ni think i'm just a thinker i think\nthat's possible\num can you help me understand what was\nhelpful or what was insightful about\ntoday\n[Music]\num\njust kind of understanding better why i\nam the way i am\nand some of the\ni guess complexes that i have and\nbringing more self-awareness to them and\nmaybe understanding a little bit more\nwhere they come from of course i know\nthat my past is affecting me in the\npresent but\nnot always so\naware as to how or how to help it\num and\nit definitely it's a little bit blurry\nthe the\nthe kind of toxic feelings of inadequacy\nversus the more\nlike you said like the necessity of what\ni have to do\nuh sometimes it's hard to tell the\ndifference\num\nwhat do you think is well i guess i\nalready kind of know the answer but\ni assume that meditation is a good way\nto kind of cultivate that\nself-awareness\nin your thinking and your patterns and\nthings like that\nwhat do you think\ni think so but it's a habit that i've\nnever really been able to it's never\nbeen able to stick with me for some\nreason\nmaybe because it's driven by my\ninadequacy\nwhen i do it ah tell me about that\nwhat happens when you try to meditate\nsorry\n[Music]\nwhat happens when i try to meditate\nuh it's not like a super uncomfortable\nexperience for anything i just have a\nhard time\njust sitting down and getting it done i\nthink a lot of the things that i do\nthere's a very clear motivation to it\nbut with meditation i don't really have\none\neven though i know it's it's it's good\nfor you but\nlet me think about this for a second\nsure\nso your first question was how do you\ngain self-awareness\ni have had kind of bouts of meditating\nconsistently and i definitely noticed\nespecially an increased awareness of\nwhen i was really present and when i'm\nnot\nwhen i'm really in my own head\num do you want an easy meditation\ntechnique or a hard meditation technique\nwhatever you think is i'm gonna give you\na super hard one\nokay so\noh we're gonna practice quickly i want\nyou to sit up straight\nso i want you to as you breathe in\nthrough your nose\nsay the word strength in your mind and\nas you breathe out i want you to say the\nword weakness\nin your mind\njust do one breath\nwere you able to do it\nokay now comes the hard part\nevery time you walk through a door a\ndoorway\ni want you to breathe to yourself and\ninhale strength\nand exhale weakness\ni think i would feel really silly doing\nthat but yeah you don't have to say it\nright so it just has to be an internal\nthing like just\nand if the strength and weakness feels\nweird to you you can even let go of that\njust inhale and exhale every time you\nwalk through a doorway\nokay how does that feel to you\nis the strength weakness part a little\nbit cheesy\n[Music]\na little bit so i'll leave that one up\nto you\ni had a therapist years ago that\nmade me do a lot of uh kind of\naffirmations\nand positive affirmations you know stuff\nnever really clicked with me\nperfect let's let's swap it around we're\ngoing to inhale weakness and breathe out\nstrength how about that\nthat sounds great does that feel more\ncomfortable for you\nuh\nsounds a little depressing to be honest\nso\nso so which you tell me that\nno i i i it's\nthe inhaling strength of the excellence\nis not it's not bad\nit was more having to look at myself in\nthe mirror and say these things out loud\ni thought it was\nvery cheesy but no but you're not\nlooking at anything we're not\nno not with you i was referring back to\nwhat like yeah i think positive i think\npositive affirmations are terrible\ni think you're not not what i would\nrecommend for you\nand and and i encourage you i know this\nsounds kind of weird soren but i\nencourage you\nto like actually play around with it so\nby all means\ndo weakness and strength or strength and\nweakness whichever way you want to do it\nyou can do both or neither\nthe key thing is going to be going\nthrough the doorway but if it feels\ncheesy for you maybe that can be good\nand if it feels depressing that can be\ngood and just play around with it right\nbecause it's two sides of the same coin\ni don't think cheesy's\nnecessarily a bad thing okay\nso try that it's gonna be really really\nhard\nokay like this is like a you know uh\nlike a professional level technique and\nthe reason is because our brain is\nactually\nwired to reset our thought process\nanytime we go through a doorway\nit's why i don't know if you've ever\nexperienced this but if you walk like\nyou'll walk into a room and you'll be\nlike why did i walk into this room what\nwas i doing\nit's actually this weird thing about\ndoorways but it's like the best way to\ncultivate self-awareness because it's so\nhard\nokay okay that's the meditation\nall right any last day meditation\nyep you're right it is an all-day\nmeditation\nwould anything less be sufficient for\nyou\nuh i guess not\nright so the other thing is that\nsometimes i use this meditation\ntechnique to trick people into\nmeditating normally because they try\nthis for\na week and they're like this is terrible\ni'm just gonna sit down for five minutes\nand meditate normally which if you\ndecide to do that that's totally fine\ntoo\nbut give it a shot um all right\nand any last thoughts or questions\nbefore we wrap up for the day\num no\nokay thanks again for for having me\nthanks for coming on man i\ni hope um it was helpful and you know i\nthink you're fantastic i really do think\nthat your team is very\nlucky to have you thank you\nhow
