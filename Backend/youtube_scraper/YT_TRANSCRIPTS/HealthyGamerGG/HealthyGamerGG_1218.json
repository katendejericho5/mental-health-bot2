    "transcript": "hey friends i'd love to talk to you\ntoday about our sponsor audible\nso i'm a huge fan of audible i've been a\ncustomer of theirs for over a decade now\num i really love listening to audiobooks\ni found that as i've gotten busier and\nbusier it's hard to find the time to\nactually read\nand the other real challenge is that you\nknow we're so concerned about\nscreen time and eye strain that i've\nreally come to love audiobooks\ni tend to combine them with other things\nthat i don't want to do so suddenly\nthings like chores are doing the dishes\nactivities that i generally\nprocrastinate on are things that i sort\nof combine with the dopamine enjoyment\nof listening to a gripping audiobook\ni'm listening to rage of dragons by evan\nwinter right now it's an\nepic book really love it makes doing the\ndishes really enjoyable\nso i'd really recommend that you all\ncheck out audible's free trial uh it's\n30 day it's a 30 day free trial right\nnow\nand also check out the audible plus\nprogram which i'm a huge fan of\nso you get one free book a month and in\naddition to that you get access to their\nplus catalog\nand what i love about that is that the\nplus catalog has a lot of audiobooks\nthat i may not necessarily want to\nbuy but you can still get access to so i\ndo a lot of my non-fiction listening\nand learning through the plus catalog so\nif you all are interested you all can\ncheck out\naudible.com healthygamer or text\nhealthygamer to 500 500.\nhey guys dr k here so today i'd like to\ndo something a little bit different\nhere at healthy gamer we want to start\nsharing case studies with you\nwhich are examples of particular um\npeople that i've worked with or people\nfrom our community and we're going to\nkind of explain a little bit about who\nthey\nare and kind of what the problem they\nstruggle with is\nand sort of a little bit behind the\ntheory or neuroscience behind why that\nperson is stuck in a particular way\nand then ultimately share a little bit\nabout how that person was able to move\nforward\nso for today's case study i want to\nshare a case about\nbullying and social anxiety um that has\nto do with someone from our community a\nguy named adam so adam is a 21 year old\ncaucasian\nmale who was actually one year ahead\nin school and was bullied a lot and\neventually developed social anxiety and\nwe're going to go through a little bit\nabout how that process works\nwhat happens in the brain during social\nanxiety and then eventually\nshare a little bit about how adam was\nsort of able to overcome his social\nanxiety\nso to begin with adam um was actually a\nlittle bit precocious\nso started school early and so was\nactually one year younger than a lot of\nhis\ncolleagues so early on um tended to get\nmade fun of a lot\nand uh wasn't quite as good at sports\nprobably because he was\na year younger than everyone else and so\nadam\ndescribes a very vivid memory of him\nbeing seven years old\nand maybe in the second or third grade\num and every day that when he went out\nto recess he would be like\nsuper careful because there were a\ncouple of kids that would bully him\nand so he really remembers like enjoying\nrecess but also dreading recess\nbecause he wasn't sure whether he was\ngoing to get bullied or not\nand generally speaking it wasn't a\nproblem in the classroom because\nteachers were around but on recess\nyou know no one really did anything when\nhe got pushed around\nso he remembers a really distinct uh\ntime where he went out to play\nand then he remembers kind of this this\nimage of there's a particular person who\nbullied him\nand then he remembers kind of this\nsemi-circle of other kids that would\nwatch\nand so what usually happens when a kid\ngets bullied is you know there's one kid\nwho's doing the bullying and one kid\nwho's the\nthe victim and then a lot of other kids\nare watching\nso i want you guys to pause for a second\nand just kind of envision this you know\nthere's a seven-year-old kid with an\neight-year-old who's like bigger than\nhim\nmore popular than him and is about to\nmake fun of him and a lot of the other\nkids actually know what's gonna happen\nright because bullies are gonna like\nadvertise that they're about to bully\nsomeone\nand other people are going to kind of\njoin in for the entertainment or just to\nwatch\nand so what happens in the brain of the\nseven-year-old at that point what\nhappens in adam's brain\nand so i want to share a couple of\ndifferent uh\nparts of the brain and explain those so\nwe can understand a little bit about\nwhat happens\nin bullying and then eventually how that\nleads to social anxiety\nso the first part of the brain that i\nwant to explain is something called the\namygdala\nthe amygdala is a really primitive\nstructure in our brain and\nwhat primitive means is that it serves a\nreally basic\num function and is sort of even in like\nanimals and stuff the amygdala is pretty\nmuch the same\nso the amygdala is our fear and survival\ncenter\nit's the part of our brain that\nactivates when we're afraid and it's the\npart of our brain that sort of\nprepares us to survive conflict right\nnext to the amygdala\nis uh the limbic system as a whole\nand the limbic system is sort of our\nemotional circuitry and so that's\nso the amygdala experiences fear and the\nlimbic system as a whole sort of\nexperiences all of our\nother emotions also relatively primitive\nor older structure in the brain\nand then the next structure that i want\nto talk about is the hippocampus\nand the hippocampus is our learning\ncenter for the brain\nthe really interesting thing is if you\nlook at the the neuroanatomy of it the\namygdal and the hippocampus are right\nnext to each other\nand the reason for that is because one\nof the most powerful ways we learn\nis through negative experience so you\ncan understand this really simply\nbecause\nif you think about let's say a\nrestaurant that you like you've eaten\nthere a dozen times and you really\nenjoyed it\nand if you eat there once and get food\npoisoning\nit's going to be really hard to go to\nthat restaurant again even though like\nless than 10 percent of the time you\nactually get sick all it takes is one\nbad experience\nfor your brain to learn that oh we want\nto avoid that\nright and that's absolutely a survival\nmechanism because we wanted to learn you\nknow we wanted to learn very quickly if\nsomething was\nharmful to us we didn't want to be slow\nlearners with negative things\nwhich is also kind of tricky because we\nlearned so quickly from\nfrom punishment and negative experiences\nwhich is actually exactly what happened\nin adam's case\nso let's kind of go back to adam now\nthat we understand these three parts of\nthe brain\nand what happens when he sort of faces\noff against his bully\nis that his amygdala activates so he\nkind of goes into survival mode he may\nstart to panic a little bit\nbut as the amygdala activates it turns\non this sort of\nsymphony of physiologic and\nneurologic responses that are kind of\nwhat i call the danger circuit so his\ndanger circuit activates\nso his blood pressure increases his\nheart rate increases his pupils dilate\nmuscle uh blood rushes to his muscles\nand sort of prepares him for survival\nand blood moves away from other things\ntoo and this becomes really important\nso when our amygdala activates and our\nprimitive structures activate\nwhat they actually do is shut off\nour more advanced parts of the brain\nso our cerebral cortex is a lot of what\nmakes us human\nso the the outer parts of our brain is\nwhere we get a lot of our analytical\nthinking\na lot of our kind of complex\nunderstanding of things a lot of our\nproblem solving capabilities\na lot a lot of our ability to see things\nin nuance or shades of gray\nso when the amygdala sort of activates\nwe sort of\nturn to animalistic or primal responses\nas opposed to sophisticated ways of\nlooking at things\nand that's absolutely a survival\nmechanism as well\nbecause we want sophisticated thought\nwhen we're kind of like calm and not in\ndanger\nand we want black and white thinking and\ninstant responses when we're in danger\nbecause it's kind of a life-and-death\nsituation\nso our neurology is actually uh\ndesigned to shut off our ability to\ncritically think\nand analyze situations in a rational way\nwhen our amygdala activates\nand so what going kind of back to the\nplayground so our amygdala activates so\nhis cerebral cortices shut off and then\nyou know he starts to learn a really\nimportant lesson which is that when\neveryone is looking at me\ni'm in danger right so he wants to start\nto avoid\nbeing seen because being seen is being\ntargeted\nand eventually what happens is as this\nhappens again and again and so he gets\npushed to the ground and stuff like that\nhe starts to cry everyone laughs at him\nit's an incredibly traumatic experience\nand so his hippocampus is like hey\nanytime people are looking at us this is\na real problem\nand so the bully continues to pick on\nhim and then he also discovers something\nelse that's really really important\nwhich is that if he's ever the center of\nattention\nand even for a good thing so like let's\nsay he shows up so he\ntold me a story about how um he showed\nup one day with a\na psp right so he was like showing\neveryone his psp on the playground\nand so like in that moment everyone's\nlike super impressed with like his\nhis gaming console and so he's the\ncenter of attention\nand sure enough what happens is the\nbully walks over\nand once the bully sees that he's the\ncenter of attention he doesn't like that\nso he starts to put him down\nstarts to bully him again things like\nthat thankfully he didn't like lose his\npsp or anything\num but eventually what what he learns is\nthrough each of these experiences that\nare a little bit traumatic\nhis hippocampus is is learning right\nhe's learning\na very very important lesson which is\nthat like it's important to be invisible\nit's safe to be invisible we don't want\nyou know we don't want to be seen\nbecause whenever we're seen\neven though not whenever but ninety\npercent of the time we can be fine when\nwe're seen but all it takes is ten\npercent of the time for us to learn to\ncompletely avoid that behavior\nand so over time his body wires\nhis brain wires to avoid being seen\nand so as he continues to grow older and\nolder and older\nyou know that wiring is is kind of\nreally deep\nrooted and sort of formed when he was\nreally young so as he goes through his\nteenage years he starts to feel really\nawkward and then he winds up sort of\neventually being 21\nand he's incredibly socially anxious and\nhe finds that any time he goes into a\nsocial situation\nwhere he's seen he feels targeted right\nand so what happens he goes like\nhe'll go to a party where like no one\neven knows who he is and if anyone\nwhen he opens the door he told me this\nreally distinct memory of like\nhe's going to a party for the first time\nhe opens the door and what is what do\npeople do when you open a door everyone\nlooks at the door\nand in that moment when people look at\nthe door\nwhat happens in his brain his\nhippocampus is like hey\nwe've been here before everyone's\nlooking at us there are eight pairs of\neyes on us\nright now and that means we're in danger\nand so it activates his amygdala\nit activates his limbic system it\nactivates his sympathetic nervous system\nhe starts to get flushed with adrenaline\nand he starts to feel\nlike he's in danger now if we stop and\nwe think about this for a second\nwe'd think like oh this is social\nanxiety this is a mental illness\nright but if we really pay attention\nwhat we discover is that\nthis isn't his brain malfunctioning this\nis his brain\nfunctioning the way that it was supposed\nto this is his brain\nlearning that vaccine is to be targeted\nand so what what happens is each time he\nkind of goes into these social\nsituations\nthere are signals in his brain telling\nhim hey man we're in danger because\npeople are looking at us\nand so he tries his best to kind of\novercome that right so what he does is\nhe he tries to convince himself\nthat his you know it's not really a\nproblem and he has these like little\narguments or wars with himself he goes\ninto battle with his\nown mind before he gets to the party\nwhile he's at the party\nevery instinct in his body is telling\nhim to run run run\nbut he says no i'm not going to have any\nfriends if i run away and then he's just\nkind of tortured\nand if we really look at it why does\nthat argument not\nwork very well it's because remember the\namygdala is shutting off his cerebral\nvortex so even though he's trying to\nargue with himself\nthere are actually inhibitory signals\nfrom his\namygdala to his cerebral cortex that are\npreventing it from acting fully\nso even though he's arguing against\nhimself\nthe parts of his brain that come up with\ngood arguments the parts of his brain\nthat can convince him of things and can\nactually change are actually being shut\noff by the amygdala\nwhich is why he feels so tortured at\nhome right because when he's\nat home he can really see things\nlogically because his cortices are\nactually\nfunctioning and so he he convinces\nhimself he's like okay i'm going to go\nto the party today i'm going to be fine\nit's all in my head there's no big deal\nand and that feels real to him in that\nmoment because his cortices are active\nand his amygdala is shut off but the\nsecond he walks in that door the second\nhe opens the door and those eight pairs\nof eyes\nswivel and target him that part of the\nbrain shuts off his cortex shuts off and\nthe amygdala turns on\nand then all of his logic and all of his\nthinking go completely out the window\nand so he struggles with this immensely\nbeats himself up all the time and is\nalways kind of telling himself\ni don't know why i'm this way i figured\nit out i can be calm\ni know that it's not a problem and then\nthe second that people start to look at\nhim\nwhether it's raising his hand in class\nor going to a party\neverything gets triggered and so he\nstarts to become really frustrated with\nhimself he also\nyou know turns to the computer because\nhe can form social connections there\nand why is it that he's okay talking\nonline or interacting with people on\ngames or social media\nit's because literally the hippocampus\nhas learned that\neyes looking at me is the problem that's\nwhat indicates danger\nand so the cool thing about the internet\nand also the addicting thing about the\ninternet the thing that sort of keeps\nhim trapped\nbut also offers him salvation is that on\nthe internet that danger signal doesn't\nactivate because the danger signal is\nactivated by pairs of eyes looking at me\nit's not actually activated by a\ncomputer screen and so while he\ninteracts with people online he's\ncompletely fine\nbecause his cortex is working fine his\namygdala is shut off that trigger\ndoesn't flip the switch\nand so what do we do for adam right so\nhe's kind of 21 years old\nspends a lot of time on his computer all\nof his social connections are through\nonline communities and so what did we do\nfor him so that the key thing it comes\ndown to the neuroscience right so the\nfirst thing that we had to explain to\nadam is that\nfirst of all dude you're not busted\nthere's nothing wrong with you this is\njust\nyour brain kind of miscalibrated right\nit's like your brain has learned a\nparticular thing and so all we need to\ndo is like\nunlearn it and and learn something else\nand the more that i was explaining\nable to explain that to adam something\nreally cool happened is that\nhe used to beat himself up and then all\nof that negative emotion\nall of that frustration and all of that\nshame\nmakes it really hard to rewire your\nbrain and learn something new\nright it's really hard to move forward\nin life when all you feel is like shame\nand frustration with yourself\nso the first thing is to explain to him\nhey man like you're not busted you can\nactually change this\nit's just this is what happened to you\nand this is how your brain wired because\nyou used to be in danger\nso that actually helped a lot the second\nthing that we did is we taught him how\nto meditate and more important than than\nsort of teaching him how to meditate in\nand of itself\nis that we um helped him notice his\nreaction\nand so what he was able to do is like\nobserve that like\nmentally prepare and observe it's not\nthat he was going to try to force\nhimself to do anything\nbecause forcing himself to do something\njust led to failure and frustration\nand each time he forces himself he fails\nfeels more ashamed\nand then he has to force himself harder\nand force himself harder and with each\nfailure comes more shame\nand a higher problem to overcome and it\nwas a vicious cycle so we had to break\nthat cycle\nand the way that we break that cycle is\nby not trying to succeed but just by\ntrying to notice\nso i started to tell adam is the next\ntime you go to a party if you feel like\nturning around and walking away just\nturn around and walk away if you feel\nembarrassed about it\nno big deal we're gonna meet every week\nyou know for\ntherapy anyway so you can just tell me\nabout your feelings and we'll work on\nthose\nall i want you to do is notice what\nhappens to you\nokay so when you walk inside the door\nprepare yourself for it\nrecognize that there's a part of your\nbrain that's going to turn on and is\ngoing to drive you absolutely crazy\nand recognize that these are primitive\nreally important survival mechanisms\nthat are designed\nto control your behavior these are the\nmechanisms that protected your ancestors\nfrom\ntigers and snakes and other predators so\nof course they're going to be powerful\nand you may not be able to control it\njust see what happens and so something\nreally cool happens\nwhen he starts noticing it so he does\nlose some of those battles which is\ncompletely fine right because we want to\nteach him\nto not be ashamed of failure and to let\nhim practice\nmore because it takes practice but what\nhe starts to realize is he starts to see\nthat oh okay this is just a physiologic\nreaction\nand sometimes it's going to take control\nof me\nand the more he starts to notice it the\nmore it actually starts to subside which\nis really really bizarre\nso instead of getting caught up in it he\nsort of sees it run its course so it\nstarts to activate\nhe's he knows that he's gonna feel like\nsweaty he knows that he's gonna feel\nyou know very constricted he's gonna\nfeel tightness in his chest and he's\nlike okay\nhere comes the tightness and he watches\nit and it rises and the more he watches\nit\nthe more he actually doesn't react to it\nthe more he\ndoesn't engage in a war against it and\ntry to control it\nthe more it starts to just kind of\nwither and melt away\nand then he comes upon a really\nimportant discovery which is that\nwhen he fights his anxiety it actually\nfuels it\nand by noticing it and letting it be it\nstarts to naturally just kind of subside\nbecause it doesn't have that sort of\nconflict to fuel it the other thing that\nhappens in the brain so we're sort of\ntelling him to do this but we're also\nbeing a little bit sneaky\nbecause noticing comes from your frontal\nlobes in your cerebral cortex\nso when i ask him to notice what we're\nactually doing is\nactivating the parts of his brain that\nare actually going to help him overcome\nthe anxiety\nwe're we're turning on the very things\nthat the amygdala turns off\nand there are numerous studies that show\nthat especially the frontal lobes\nwhich are the parts of our brain that\nlet us plan and execute an action right\nwhen i set an intention\ni set a goal and i follow through with\nour goal that comes from the frontal\nlobes\nso when he sets an intention to go to\nthe party follow through comes from the\nfrontal lobes\nand the frontal lobes get shut off by\nthe amygdala along with the cortices\nso when we're asking him to notice what\nwe're literally doing is flipping the on\nswitch on his frontal lobes\nwhich allow him to set a goal and follow\nthrough to it\nand over time the a third thing happens\nwhich is that\nhis hippocampus starts to learn that oh\nevery time i open a door nothing bad\nhappens\nand so i actually don't need to be in\ndanger\nand so by activating his frontal lobes\nby\nreducing his self-judgment by giving him\nthe capacity to fail and tuck his tail\nbetween his legs and run away\nand not letting him feel ashamed about\nthat what we actually do is we\ndesensitize him\nto the social situation right we help\nhis brain actually rewire\nand about after about six to eight\nmonths of really kind of focusing on\nthis\nyou know he walked into my office one\nday and said you know what i actually\nhave no problem going to parties now\ni still feel that anxiety but the\nanxiety doesn't control me so now what i\ndo is i i kind of go in\nand i'll like just kind of be by myself\nfor like 10 or 15 minutes\nand i'll let the anxiety kind of subside\nand then i'm fine for the rest of the\nnight\nand so what we can really take away from\nthis is that you know if you have social\nanxiety\na lot of times it comes from roots\nearlier in your life\nand if you really understand the\nneuroscience if you really understand\nthe biology\nand you really understand the process\nyou can go about\nsystematically dismantling it and i\nreally hope\nthat this case study illustrates that\nand if you guys struggle with\nanxiety i hope this is helpful and i\nencourage you guys to follow adam's same\nsame process which is you know let\nyourself fail first and foremost\nand if you feel ashamed notice that\nshame the second thing is to notice\nthe social anxiety process and don't\nfight with it\nand don't give in to it as best as you\ncan just notice it\nand as you do that something magical\nwill happen which is that the anxiety\nwill start to subside\nit's not going to be around forever\nthat's just not how our brain works\nright\nyou're only anxious at the party and the\nanxiety is going to go away\nso i really hope that you guys enjoy\nthis kind of content if you do\nyou know please give us feedback and\nwe'll present more case studies\nso take care and thank you very much\nadios from dr k"
