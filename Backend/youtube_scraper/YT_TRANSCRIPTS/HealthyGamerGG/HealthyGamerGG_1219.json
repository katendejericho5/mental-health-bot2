    "transcript": "and this is why i'm digging into this\nscara because i think that like\ni know this sounds weird i think you are\nattractive enough for them\nand i think the real sad thing is that\nit is your belief that you're not\nattractive enough for them\nthat is actually like becoming the\nself-fulfilling prophecy\nof like the current romantic\nstate that you're in\nhello scarab hello hello okay you seem\nfine to me bro\nso testing one two three still am i\ndelayed\nfixed okay so little story chat\na long time ago when dr k was a tiny\nlittle\nnew streamer i one day experienced lag\non stream and i talked to this\nthis person named felix felix xqc\nwe were lagging on stream and then felix\nwas like you know what\nyou know what i do to not lag on stream\ni have two internets that run to my\nhouse\nand i was like that's crazy you have two\ninternet connections and he's like yeah\nso we decided to get a second internet\nconnection and we just swapped them\nso hopefully that's fixed anyway i think\num thanks for being patient scar i\nreally appreciate it man\nit's no problem like i have literally\nlike all day\ni've been looking forward to this talk\nfor a while oh really what what have you\nbeen\nlooking forward to i think it's that\ni hear a lot of people speak highly of\nyou\ni watch stuff that you do and i think\nthat you're kind\nof a very interesting person especially\nin this\nin this space and so uh\ni think it's something that it's like a\nvery unique\nyou know i guess moment for me to be\nable to\ntalk to you sure well i i hope you get\nsomething out of it man\noh i'm sure i will um is there something\nin particular that you were thinking\nabout talking about\num well i have a bunch of things i think\nsure\nthere's a lot of things that are easy\nand some things that could be like a\nlittle bit harder\nbut the easiest things might be like the\nproblems you have generally streaming\nfor such a long period of time\nuh stuff about like um you know\nself-fulfillment uh about like creative\nand uh like i guess finding a creative\noutlet\nuh especially if your job or your\ndoesn't provide that\nyeah um i have i and on that same note\nlike maybe the idea of happiness\nand satisfaction both as a long and\nshort term\nuh also uh maybe some stuff to deal with\neither\nwith uh the fear of failure okay and\nuh how and this is something that's\nmaybe the overall thing is like i\ni saw you had to talk with h june and\nyou guys talked about\nuh low empathy and um\na lot of times i feel like uh\nthat's common for me as well\nwhere but rather than focusing on the\nlower empathy part which is something\nthat i feel like\nis is okay and i feel more\nlike talking more on the sides of like\nbeing highly logical\nand how that's like kind of a detriment\ntoward\nmaybe pushing yourself for your goals\noh that sounds really interesting to me\nso uh yeah any of those that you're\ninterested in like\ni am kind of able to talk on any of\nthose topics\nyeah so that's that's really great um\nscar\nand i'm you know i know i know you had\nnightmares about\nbeing late and and maybe not sure what\nyou wanted to talk about but i i think\nthat that's like so\nlet me just repeat back what i heard so\nlike i think a lot of this comes with\nwhat i would call kind of stream or\nburnout\nthis unfortunately or fortunately\ndepending on how on you\nhow you look at it i think is something\nthat we've had to become experts in\nwith our um you know supporting content\ncreators on twitch like which we like\nnow do as an organization\nbut you know there's a lot of stuff we\ncan certainly i think i've learned a ton\num about you know this like kind of like\ntension between\ndoing what works and following the\nmetrics\nand like giving you know the internet\nwhat it wants\nversus doing work that you find like\ncreatively fulfilling but is risky\nuh okay so on that end i feel like i've\nalready\nfully accepted that i don't give a [ __ ]\nabout doing\nwhat the internet wants um\nas long as i understand i'm doing it\nthat way yep\nthat's really good so that's my sense\nyeah it makes a lot of sense i think the\nkey thing there is that your\nunderstanding of why you're doing what\nyou're doing\nso so this is this is where like i think\na lot about making bad decisions with\neyes wide open\nwhich sometimes when i talk to my yeah\nso on that subject is that always a good\nthing\nso for instance if i know something is\nabsolutely bad for me\nand bad for my brand and bad for my\nstream but i still do it anyways\ndoes that make is that a problem even if\nyou're i if you understand\nyour eyes wide open about it you\nacknowledge that you're doing the\nproblem\nbut you still keep doing it is that any\nbetter than\nfull ignorance what is better\nwhat do you mean by better well like\nlike\nis it just like a coping mechanism i\nshould i should say like am i just\nrationalizing myself by because i can\nlogic my way\nit out of like any situation like i'm\njust rationalizing that like it's okay\nto be bad at to not do what's correct\nor not do what's good for my specific\nsituation\nbecause i don't feel like it\nokay so i i think we're going to talk\nabout logic\nversus emotions and what drives your\nactions\nand rationalization and i think it's all\ngood it'll scar it all winds up in the\nsame place\nbecause even if we talk about like\ncreative fulfillment like even your\nquestion\nis one of logic right you're like okay\nlet's think about it logically like even\nif i know\nthat something is like if i say screw\nwhat the internet wants and i'm going to\nmake what i want to do like that's a\nlogical question is that okay\nright it's sort of like a philosophical\nand logical question which i think\ngoes back to your your point about low\nempathy versus becoming reliant on logic\nbecause i don't think i mean just some\nof the stuff i you know i've talked to\nsome people who i think\nknow you and i don't based on what they\nsay i don't think you have low empathy\nat all i think you\nyou actually at least in terms of the\nway that they speak about you now i\nwonder if it's cognitive empathy and i'd\nbe really curious about what that\nreaction was that you just had\ni i think it's because\nthey don't talk to me a lot\nokay i think when they interact with me\nthe me i put out in that scenario is\nlike\nfully on all the time\nin in the sense that i try to\nalways be very very like\nscarra if they talk to you or what would\nthey discover\ni feel like um there's just a lot of uh\nor there's a there's some moments where\ni feel like\nuh i guess\num i guess it wouldn't align with with\nwhat they think i sure like\nbecause whenever i interact with people\nespecially with my friends i tend to\nvalue their time\nand the conversation very highly and\nalthough i will make\nmistakes here and there like recently\ni've made one\nthere will be situations where like i\ntend to like try to think ahead of time\nand try to make it so that like when\nthey do meet me or interact with me like\nthey always\ntake away with that was a good moment\nyou know\nbecause that's like what i try to do\nwith my friends i feel like that's just\nreally normal with everyone right\n[Music]\nbut um for me to like a larger extent\nit's like well\ni value those moments quite highly\nbecause those are the things i look\nforward to\na lot of times when you're in the\nstreaming thing it's very routine\nespecially during covet right you're not\ngoing out uh like i i'm not seeing\nanyone\ni'm not really like you know actively\nlooking and so a lot of my day by day is\nactively with my friends especially with\nthese kind of bubble that i'm\nin and that i've created or somewhat\nbeen a part of with otb\nthat like realistically i never need to\ncollab with anyone outside of otb\num just on a sustainable level like i it\nnever needs to happen\nbecause the group is so large at this\npoint that only collaborating within my\nbubble\nis enough to to like solidify my brand\nmy future\nas well as like kara put myself and keep\nmyself like near the top\nright not at the very very top right\nbecause i think at\nthat level you'd have to lug with wick\nit up right and go to like alternatives\nwhere you go toward\nuh like collaborating with a bunch of\ndifferent people yeah what's up\nwe're going to stop you there for a\nsecond sorry to interrupt\nyou slipped away from me so you said\nthat you know\ni i mentioned that i've talked to some\npeople who have who have found you to be\nvery\nempathic and supportive you mentioned\nthat those are moments that you really\nlook forward to in value\nand then you also said that like the\nreason they think that way about me is\nbecause they don't spend enough time\nwith me\nyes i think i tend to be very objective\nabout my\nfaults sure i can kind of now look\nat the mirror i'm gonna and yeah so when\nyou look in the mirror what do you see\nuh a person is trying to work on it\nwork on what uh empathy\nthat's something that was like kind of a\ngoal for me in the last two years\ncan you help me understand that um\ni think it's common when you meet\nsomeone who's\nvery logical to interact with people who\nare more emotional\nthat for instance when you approach a\nproblem and they approach you with a\nproblem\nlet's say their problem is that um\nlike they feel really bad that uh\nthey're\nnot getting enough viewers this is just\nrandom problem okay\nand immediately my mind thinks like okay\nwell what can i do to get more viewers i\ncan collab with these people\nthey can start streaming at these times\nthey can start doing this or this\nthis or this and like all they want is\nlike durant\nessentially and it's been like uh\na common i feel like this is common for\na lot of people growing pain to be like\nokay well\nunderstand that like being able to\nimmediately understand that that's what\nthey're looking to do\nis something that takes work to some\nextent or yeah\nand then when you fit when you are not\nunderstanding of that uh\nit can cause problems i feel like that's\nlike a very common\nuh point where it's like okay well\nthat's\nso i'm i'm hearing that you kind of\nstarted working on it two years ago\nyeah i'm hearing that your instinctual\nresponse\nis to try to fix things for them yes and\nthat you discovered and are working on\ntrying to not fix things for people when\nwhat they really want you to do is\nlisten\nyeah can you tell me what things were\nlike\nbefore two years\ni didn't interact with many people\ni think the biggest thing is when i went\nfrom oh\ni guess like when i went from pro play\nor i should say even before then i went\nfrom like high school to college and i\nleft all my high school friends okay\nso in college all i did was play video\ngames like that's it\nso like league of legends was and i got\ngood at it good enough to go pro\nbut the thing is like i really only have\nlike one or two friends\non campus and like i would literally\nspend my entire life\ngrinding the game um and then like i\nleft\nthem don't really talk to any but two\ncollege friends anymore i went to\nla so like essentially i had no friend\nand so going from that moment where like\ni had no friends into like meeting\ndignitas people being friends with them\nleaving that and still having to make\nnew friends it was kind of a situation\nwhere\nlike yeah before those two or three\nyears like i just didn't talk to people\nso when i started otv to like partially\nuh hang out with people i thought were\ncool and make content together and find\nnew friends\nlike that's i didn't have to go through\ni guess some of the growing pains i\nshould have earlier\nif you had more friends\nhow did it feel to not have many friends\nlike back in college and\nuh honestly i didn't really care\nbecause i think i was so addicted to\ngames\nuh like it sucked sometimes where i was\nlike oh well you know it's not a\ni i guess this is one of the things\nwhere before then\ni would like kind of logic it out and\nrationalize that like\ni didn't need to meet new people because\nlike for me it was like okay if i stay\ninside\nand i raid world of warcraft or i play\nleague of legends with my friends like\ni'm always going to get like a an 8 of\n10 experience for the night like i'm\ngoing to be it's going to be sick\nbut i go out to drink or i go with my\nfriends like sometimes like the people\nat me are kind of weird\nlike the situation is kind of lame and\nlike maybe the average is like a 6.5\nor like a seven so like just from my\nextent because at the at that point i\ndidn't value like new experiences very\nhighly\ni was just like ah it's not worth it for\nme because like the averages are just so\ndifferent\nyou know it's clear like if i just think\nabout it like mathematically\nlike i should just stay in and play\ngames um that's because\nmy evaluation in the experiences was not\nworth much but\nlater i learned that it was worth\neverything how did you learn that\nuh get growing older you tend to\nlearn that new experiences are kind of\nthe way to find what you want and the\nway to find\ni guess grow and i think it's like\neveryone knows that\nthey might not know know that but\nthey've heard people like repeat the\nwords even if they don't\nactually how did you get to know know\nthat\ni got a lot of new experiences so when i\nplayed\nprofessional play i didn't realize at\nthe time but\ni visited multiple countries\nlike i went to multiple different places\nexperienced a lot of different food a\nlot of different cultures a lot of\ndifferent people\ngot to meet great\npeople which i feel like are amazing and\nare super\nlike funny or super like talented at\nwhat they do\nand i realized that like meeting new\npeople is\nand having those new experiences were\nthings that shaped\nmy life so in hindsight i look back on\nmy\nlike kind of formative years when it\ncomes to early league of legends as like\nleague of legends actually made me the\nperson who i am\nfor all the good and bad\nand and who did it who did league of\nlegends create\nwho is the person you are i\nthink uh a person\nwho\nuh i think when i was younger i used to\nalways chase happy\nand so i'll put it this way and this is\ni i think everyone does this right this\npursuit happiness is a [ __ ] movie\nright but\num when i was given those early forms in\nmiddle school where they're what is your\nfuture profession and you write down\nyour future profession\ni was a little kid i wrote down happy\nand i\nto this day still think that small\nversion of me was still way smarter than\nwho i am now\nand i think i've been trying to chase\nwhat that means\nand how that like translates\nto what i do for a long time and i\nrealized that like\nlike league made me happy working with\npeople to a goal\nmade me very [ __ ] happy to the point\nwhere like i\nlike not only was it um fulfilling on a\nday by day it was also creatively\nfulfilling as well because i feel like\nteam\ncamadri brutalized that or whatever\nlike being able to work together with\npeople who are very talented\nis like um the feeling can't be measured\nespecially when you're looking to\ncompete\nat the top level at least in the top of\nnorth america right\num and so like through like that's how i\nkind of learned what makes me happy both\non the short term and\nas throughout the as the year stretched\nlater and later\ni learned satisfaction which is like i\nguess my definition for like long-term\nhappiness\nand how that kind of works together\nand so lee kind of formed my idea\nof what happiness and satisfaction are\nyeah so one way i'm going to just kind\nof like explain how i understand it\nso i think that a lot of times when we\nthink about short-term happiness it's an\nemotion\nso our mind is capable of producing\nemotions like joy\nsadness fun enjoyment relaxation\nand then there's almost like a spiritual\ndimension of happiness which is not\nemotional in nature\nso this is the axis of sukkah which\nmeans like\npeace or contentment and which means\nsuffering\nand so sometimes like this can be\nconfusing because people sort of equate\nsuffering with sadness but if you ever\nlisten to sad music\nlike you kind of enjoy it and like why\ndo we\nlisten to sad music why do we watch sad\nmovies because we in those moments we\nfeel negative emotions\nbut there's like a peace or joy or\ncontentment which implies that actually\nthat the axes\nlike the spiritual axis of sukkah and\ndukkha or contentment and suffering\nis independent of the axis of emotion\nand that emotions tend to fluctuate\nrelatively easily from day to day but\nwhat you call\nsatisfaction i think is on that other\naxis\nof sukhanduk it's sort of a more cosmic\nsense of contentment\ni don't know if i'd relate cosmic\ncontentment\nand put those words together but i do\nunderstand the general gist of what\nyou're talking about and i agree\nyeah um and like i still remember like\nthere were like i remember\nmy memory is really bad of just my past\ni tend to be\nvery um just forgetful like long-term\nmemory rise but i remember moments in my\nlife where i was like\nthis determined something important so\nlike\ni remember way back in middle school\nwhen i first learned how to play tennis\ni had a private instructor\nand we were playing tennis and i would\nand and\nuh i was playing\nand for me i was always just like i just\nwant to play\nand he was trying to instill some sort\nof competitive spirit in me and he just\nasked like\nwhen you play is it more fun to win or\nlose\ndo you enjoy it more when you win or\nenjoy more when you lose\nand that's who my young little brain\nlike kind of flicked on and i was like\ni do like winning you know i feel like\nat some point everyone realizes that\nwinning is cool\nyou gotta love it and then in my\nleague of legends years i'd once talked\nto the ul\ncoach sheepy he was in in a for\nsomething and he kind of talked to me\nabout satisfaction and he used very\nleague of legends terms for it\nhe was like okay a good example of\nhappiness for satisfaction is\nif you go to worlds like\nand you're if you're playing through the\nteam and you're you're enjoying like the\nmoment you play your team the wins\nlosses you're making playoffs\nbut if you don't make it to worlds are\nyou satisfied at the end of the year\nand i just thought about that and i'm\nlike i'm probably not you know\nregardless about how i do at worlds if i\ndon't make it i'm not satisfied\nand for me that was like a very easy\nleague of legends way of putting it\nor like esports really putting it of\nlike how to determine between like\nsatisfaction and happiness for myself\ni know that like yeah i feel like you\nhave maybe like different\nrules or logic but like it makes the\nsame sense\ni i think you know it's interesting you\nyou mentioned\nyou know like loving to win or loving to\nlose\ni was working a buddy of mine as a is an\nolympic athlete\nand she was telling me that you know\nwhen she was like growing up or when she\nwas training like someone asked her the\nquestion\ndo you love to win or do you hate to\nlose\nand so when i work with when i work with\nyou know competitors i think that\nbecomes a really really important\nquestion it's really fascinating to see\nwho says what in terms of what motivates\nthem\nyou know do you do you play because you\nlove to win\nor do you like practice because you hate\nto lose\ni think i've spent years breaking myself\naway from\nbeing a competitor i think\nnow when you look at my recent streams\nor my recent play\ni focus a lot about being like a more\nentertaining personality\nas opposed to being a more competitive\nvideo gamer and i think\nit kind of comes at the expense of the\nothers sometimes\nat least for me it does and trying to\nfind the balance is the difficult\nin between so scarra i'm gonna circle\nback to this idea of logic and empathy\nthroughout our conversation if that gets\nannoying to you let me know\ni think we're kind of mapping out a lot\nof stuff but like so let me ask you when\nyou kind of say that when you look in\nthe mirror you see someone who's working\non it\nyeah can you help me understand that\nsentiment\num\n[Music]\nit's kind of like uh\ni think naturally whatever i\ntend to\ni think everyone does some sort of sort\nof internal self review\nwhether they do it uh on a day by day\nweek by week\nwhere they do it under like the\ninfluence or they do it like\nwith friends whatever with their\ntherapist there is some sort of\nself-review\ninherent in yourself and if i i find in\ncompetitive types of people\nand i still think i somewhat am that\nlike i tend to be very self-reflective\nof what i do\nand so every month or every couple of\nweeks i'll be like well how am i\ndoing in certain different aspects of my\nlife\num and so i it sounds like i'm vod\nreviewing my\nmy real life so it's like well\nuh very immediately after a situation\nwhether like\ni hang out with people or whatever i'll\nthink to myself like how did that go\nlike was it cool was it not cool did\nlike did something happen that you\nenjoyed that you didn't\num and sometimes i'll come away from\nthat like i [ __ ] up like i made that\nperson uncomfortable i said some bad\nstuff there\nlike how do i make up for it what do i\ndo in the future is it do i just ignore\nit and then\nbe a better like try to be a better\nperson later i think that for me uh\nthere's a lot of that kind of\nself-reflection over the years and so\nwhen it comes to empathy it's like\nuh i think i've been a better listener\nover years because at first i would\nlisten to problems\nand i i'd be like oh it's so easy are\nyou are you serious\nyou just do this it's like it's like why\nis this a problem\ni like maybe even say those words like\nwhat's the problem like just just do\nthis\nand like they were coming to me for like\nemotional support and i was like [ __ ]\noff like are you serious this is so easy\njust so do it\nscarra this is gonna be tough okay\nokay so i i want to share something with\nyou that i think will\nhelp a lot but i think it's going to be\na slippery\nslippery thing to catch okay\nso i'm going to start by introducing the\nconcept of cognitive empathy versus\nemotional empathy\nokay and i think what you have a lot of\nis cognitive empathy\nuh yeah i can see that when you say i\ncan see that what does that mean to you\nwhat do you see\ntell us well it's it's more just like\nthat makes sense i guess because when\nyou're talking like cognitive\ni think cognitive i think like brain\nfunction right yeah where it's more like\nlogical\nyeah like empathy like i could see\nmyself being more as like a cognitive\nempathy kind of guy rather than a you\nknow the rever the alternative\nyep or i guess the other side\nso the way that you are learning to be\nempathic is through logic\nyou do vod review right so like so if we\nthink about emotional empathy\nand if we think about technically what\nempathy means\nit's the ability to like feel someone\nelse's\nemotions right so if i'm watching a\nyoutube video and someone gets hit in\nthe nuts\ni feel that instinctive pain in myself\nas i watch this other person suffer\nit has nothing to do with cognition it\nhas everything to do with\nan empathic response and i'm hearing\nthat you're becoming\nsocially adept\nbut i'm not sure that you're becoming\nmore empathic\nbecause i think what you're really\nenhancing is your cognitive empathy\nyou're looking at this like a game that\nis played that has rules\nyou're looking at relationships like\nchess and it's like if this person makes\nthis move\nwhat is the right move for me to make\nproblem solving\nis the wrong move listening is the right\nmove\nhow do i listen okay let's listen oh\nthat went well\ngood job scarra you're working\nhow do you feel about that\num i feel like there's a lot of truth in\nwhat you said and i may not agree with\neverything that you said but i'm willing\nto listen so\nwhat do you disagree with um i feel like\ni may have explained it to you too\nlogically\num because there's no way okay\ni find it very hard to believe that\npeople think specifically like that\nlogically about stuff so i even though i\nexplain it that way i don't necessarily\nthink or feel that way completely\nokay but i do agree with you that like\nthat could be the case\nand highly true so now we get to the\nslippery part\nand this is what's gonna be hard is when\ni ask you\nquestions your answers are logical in\nexplanation\nbut i think that we're missing something\nbecause you skirt very quickly\nover something to a logical explanation\nokay okay so i i'm glad that\nyou recognize that you explain something\nlogically so i'll give you just an\nexample\nwhen i mentioned that i talked to some\npeople who consider you\nto be like a very good friend and very\nempathic and emotionally supportive what\nwas your response\ni didn't think i\ni feel like it's overplayed i guess at\nmy my initial response but that's\nbecause\ni have very early it is again slippery\nokay\nslippery right that's because\nso one is an emotion and then the second\nyou say that's because you move into a\nrationalization\nslippery slippery i find that the best\nway to talk about these things is\nrelatively rationally if possible\nthere's some people um\ni feel like it's easier to break down\nand digest\nwhen you can do that um\nand i found that especially\nwhen i approach someone like you that i\nfeel like does that a lot\nor can do that that it becomes easier to\ntalk to when it's completely logical or\nlike\nmainly logical yes so i would concur to\nyou\nthat it is the i understand why you say\nthe best way but i think this is what\nposition did you play in law\nwhen you were playing competitively\nmidland okay\nso like i think that's a very like if\nyou think about\nyou know winning a game you can be mid\nlane centric right like you can think\nabout the goals you're a mid laner\nand that's your strengths so when when i\nask you like\ni mean i think you understand this at a\nhigher level because you understand\nlaw better but like if i were to ask\nlike a mid-tier law player\nor if i go post on the league of legends\nlike reddit\nand i ask how do i climb and they'll say\nlike you've got to play mid and carry\nthe game\ntechnically it isn't true but like you\ncan certainly see why people feel that\nway right\nyeah like and supports will be like yeah\ni tried playing support and it didn't\nwork and like i didn't start climbing\nuntil i started playing mid\nso i think that when you say it's the\nbest way i think that's because that's\nthe thing that\nyou're the best at agreed\nso i think that like where we need to\nwork on because i think it's like subtle\nand i'm curious do you remember what you\nwere going to say when when i s\nyou were about to say that's because and\nthen i cut you off like a dick\nbut i think you were saying something\nreally important do you have very low\nexpensive my self-worth\nthere we go a lot of times yep\nso uh\nyeah i think that's normal\nsome a lot of times okay so\nso there you go explaining it\nrationalizing it it's normal to feel\nthis way\nyeah right but like how do we so what\nare you feeling right now\nthat i put myself out there\na little bit more than i have normally\nthat i usually wouldn't say that\nuh without some sort of joking\nconnotation to it that i usually would\non stream\nso i'll ask you this question i think\nfor the second or third time and you may\nhear it a few more times\nscarra what do you see when you look in\nthe mirror\nsomeone who's happy about where they're\nat\nand maybe not too happy about what he\nsees physically in the mirror\nokay so\ncan i think for a second go ahead\n[Music]\ni'm figuring out how to say this\nso what i'm hearing is that you work so\nyou look in the mirror right so we're\ngonna i'm gonna put myself in scara's\nhead for a second okay\nso hopefully we get some things that are\nright here but you've done a very good\njob of sort of pointing out\nyou know where i'm off so i'd really\nappreciate that\nsaskara looks at himself in the mirror\nand he's happy with some things and\nhe's unhappy with other things so then\nwhat scarra does is scar says like let's\nwork on\nright let's think about this let's do\nsome analysis like let's\ndraw on this skill set to make ourselves\nbetter\nand then you work on yourself and now\nyou can start to be like content i'm\njust keep going\nokay then you start to work on yourself\nbecause that's what you know how to do\nright like you know how to improve\nyourself you know how to be logical\nabout what you can work on and what you\ncan't work on\nand so like you work on it for a while\nlike two years ago you embarked on this\nthis thing like okay you haven't been\nnecessarily lonely in the past but like\nnow you're kind of worrying\nworking on like forming relationships\nand having authentic experiences and\nyou're gonna work on it\nand then you can even be proud of that\nyou can look at yourself in the mirror\nand you can say like scar\nhas come a long way and i'm like living\na life that's more enriching i'm\nstarting to step away from like you know\nbeing judged by the internet and like\nyou can make lots of progress\nand so when you look in the mirror you\nhave this beautiful response\nsomeone who's working on it right it's\nso positive\nand like that's what you've got to do\nyou look at yourself there's something\nyou're not happy with and like you work\non it that's how you become a pro league\nof legends player\nright because there's always something\nto improve\nand logic is your shield it's your tool\nit's your sword it's everything\nand the challenge though is that you can\nwork on it and you can work on it and\nyou can work on it and you can be\nsatisfied in that dimension of your life\nbut when you look in the mirror like\nthat other feeling doesn't go away\nhmm\nokay what do you think about that\ni'm trying to figure out what you mean\nwhen you say other feeling\nso a few moments ago you got a little\nbit emotional\nthat thing doesn't change\nright and i think like what i've now i'm\ni'm really going out on a whim\nand i think that there's something very\ndangerous that could be going on\nwhich is that the more you work on\nthings\nand the more that other thing doesn't\nchange\nwhat do you logically conclude\nthe more you work on your life and the\nmore successful you become\nyes the more you work on empathy yes\nand the better you get and if you look\nin the mirror\nthe more that that other feeling like\ncontinues persists\ni think when i look in the mirror i\nthink a lot of things that i\ncould do but i'm not doing\nso whether it's like uh\nworking out more as a very good example\num and it's things that like\ni don't know whether i should be feeling\ni think i can i can rationalize some\nthings you know and i think that's one\nof the things that like you can\nfind a way to kind of rationalize it in\na lot of different ways\num i don't know\n[Music]\ni think if foo i use the words i think a\nlot now that you've brought it up\nbecause when we're talking about my\nfeeling of low\nself-worth i think that comes with the\nfact that i\nfeel like i am not\nflexible or good enough\nas a person in every situation\nbut the way i've handled that feeling\nis the understanding that i will never\nbe perfect\nand to take steps slow\nyep so i i think that's adaptive\nright you're you could call it\nacceptance\nso here's what i was kind of angling\ntowards and i'm gonna lay it out for you\nlogically\nso i think it's gonna be terrifying\nbecause there are some things you can\nwork on and there are some things that\nyou can't\nand the adaptive way to look at that is\nthat no one is perfect\nbut like it also like can engender i\nknow this sounds kind of weird\nsome degree of hopelessness because\ndespite\nall your efforts despite all your growth\nwhen you look in the mirror you still\nsee\nlike something that's a little bit ugly\nyeah and then what happens is you start\nto think to yourself like i could do\nthings to change this\ni could work out more for example but\nthe\nchallenge there is as logical as that is\nlike it actually engenders feelings of\nhopelessness and powerlessness\nbecause who are you you're someone who\ncould do something\nbut you don't\nand then how do you feel about being\nthat person\ni feel more human that's that's good\nthat's actually very good like um\nthat's kind of what i see is like\ni don't mean max my life\neven though i feel like i'm fairly\nlogical because i\nunderstand except that\ni'll have days which i'm just don't feel\nlike doing it\ndays where it's you know you stay in bed\na little bit longer days where you\nuh do chores but you put them off and i\nfind that i just\ncategorize those moments as just being\nnormal\nthat's not bad thing that's just\na normal thing okay so when we're\ncategorizing\nwhat kind of part of our mind are we\nusing\nlogical part there we go so i can see\nthat like this is\nlike so logic is your mid lane right\nit's like your\nyour strong suit and yeah that's what i\nunderstand\nabsolutely so i think that this is where\nif we think about like\nyou know that moment that you\nexperienced emotion do you have a sense\nof how we brought that emotion out\nuh yeah\ni think you asked me to point out\nsomething fairly vulnerable\nsomething that i wouldn't be comfortable\nsharing to the general public\nnormally okay so\nlet me stop there for a second because\nit you don't i want to\nimpress upon you that you really don't\nhave to share anything that you don't\nfeel comfortable with\noh no i'm completely okay like yeah yeah\ni i know most people feel that way but\nhere's what i\nhere's what i would do so here's what i\nintentionally tried to do\nso the first time that i asked you the\nquestion i saw the emotion\nyou had a micro expression of like and\nyou swatted away\nthe praise of your friends yes\nand so like why does someone swat away\nthe praise of of their friends it's\nbecause like you don't\nfeel like you are what they think you\nare they're wrong because you said if\nthey only spent more time with me\nthey would see the real me which is\nuglier\nright i'm not trying to focus on an\nappearance thing there but like\nlike we like it's like you're showing\nyour friends like this nice\nempathic supportive person that you try\nreally hard and you can be proud of and\nworked on\nbut like the funny thing is there's the\nflip side to that coin which is like\nthey're not\nseeing the real me\nand if they spent more time with me if\nthey saw me when my defenses were down\nand if they got unfiltered scarra they'd\nsee something else\nand then you launched into your logical\nexplanation\nso i think the way that we got to the\nemotion and you do it fast scarra it's\nlike\nit's the transition is so damn quick you\ntouch the negative emotion and then your\nmind is like categorized in logic\nyou skirt over it you launch into like a\nfeel-good story about positivity and\nself-growth and learning about yourself\nand then like that emotion gets left\nbehind and so the\nthe the harder i make it for you to\nskirt past it the more you begin to see\nyour logical defense mechanisms the more\nit\nuncovers that emotion and then if you\nstart to categorize it the emotion is\ngoing to get buried\nand so what you're going to be doing is\nyou're going to be like grinding mid\nlane\nand like forgetting about the support\nrole\nand so like you've become very\ncognitively empathic it's beautiful your\nanalogies are great dude like you\nunderstand it so well\nreplay analysis for conversations\ni'll do it that well but i know what you\nmean yeah right\nso so that even though you sort of said\ni don't do it that well i'm not\ndetecting any real emotion underneath\nthat\nwhereas i think that like when we get to\nlike you know and i genuinely don't\nthink that you felt lonely in college\nbut like there are questions that i'm\npurposely avoiding asking you\nlike because i think that they're gonna\nelicit emotional responses and like i\ndon't know if\nlike i don't know that we ever need to\nask those questions because i think the\nmost\nimportant thing to i'm sure it'll be\nclip worthy but like\nthe most important thing is to help you\nunderstand like how to access your\nemotions\nbecause your emotions don't need to be\nfixed\nagreed right and and so but it's hard\nbecause you like to fix things\nuh so like you've learned how to listen\nto other people\nand you're starting to sort of learn how\nto listen to yourself\nbut i think that you default to problem\nsolving your own life\nyeah i could see that all right\nso you know what i'd really like to do\nis teach you\nabout stepping away from your logical\nmind\nwhat do you think about that uh\ni think that'd be cool\nokay yeah so tell me about\nround four what do you see when you look\nin the mirror\ni don't know like if i'm gonna be a\nhundred percent honest\ni don't know i don't really think about\nit too much\nokay um aside from the fact that like i\ndon't like to see\nthe reflection that looks back\nphysically um\nwhat i think i oh just like\ni wish\ni was skinnier i guess\nlike i wish i was more healthy sure so\nso\nso i'm gonna just repeat back to you\nwhat you said because i think we're\ngetting somewhere but now i'm gonna go\nthe logical route\ncool i don't know what i see when i look\nin the mirror\nexcept for dot dot dot\nyes right so like if we think about that\nresponse logically for a second\nthere's like a dominant direction\nwhich is like something negative i think\nyes and so i think i first look at the\nphysical appearance\nokay and and what do you\nyeah so and and what do you think about\nyour physical appearance\nuh that it could be better is one way to\nphrase it\nyep good so now that's your positive\nadaptive\nversion right so what's the flip side of\nthe coin for\nit could be better uh that i\nwill die before i'm 40 unless i start\ntaking care of myself\nthat's still a positive there's a\ndirtier version underneath\nuh\nhow do you feel when you look in the\nmirror out of shape\nokay um let me know if i'm digging in\nlike so i like let me share with you\nbecause i'm gonna i'm gonna do some of\nthe lifting for you okay\nscarra yeah so i'm going to do this\nbecause i i don't want you to feel bad\nand i feel like if i keep on asking you\nquestions you're going to feel bad\nso we're going to stay in the safety i\nthink you're a\npretty far away point for me feeling bad\nokay but maybe that's just defensively\nwhat i'm saying\nbut it's i'm okay\ni think that i'm pretty sure\nokay so when you look at yourself and\nyou feel like someone\nshould be someone who could be in shape\nmore that's the problem-solving\nside right it gives you a direction to\nfix\nwhat you see in the mirror yes do you\nsee how like that's\nintrinsically tied but\nwhat needs to be fixed scara\nfrom our conversation the emotional side\nsure but fundamentally what kinds of\nthings need to be fixed\ni don't know the response to this\nquestion\nthings that are broken yes\nright so like when you look in the\nmirror\ndo you feel what you're looking at is\nsomething that's\nbusted no okay\nlet me think about that response for a\nsecond\nit by the way i thought it was really\ngood when you told me you don't know the\nanswer that i'm looking for\nit's very helpful i i i'm i'm trying to\ndo it as logically as i can\nyeah that's what we need to get rid of\nyeah but like i don't know how else to\ndo it because when you're asking me what\ni see in the mirror i first think\nphysic like what i actually look at in\nthe mirror and i don't remember\nwhat i look at okay like i almost would\ngo to the mirror right now and be like\nwho are you yeah that's a good we'll do\nthat for our meditation okay\nso so what do you think about your\nappearance\nlet's start with think\nat the base most basic level\nit's that i'm fat and i could be better\nthat's it okay so i want to just point\nout once again that anytime something\ncould be better the flip side of the\ncoin is that it's not good enough\ntrue but i think if i go down that route\nit'll be so self-destructive\nthat it'll be terrible for me as a\nperson and\nthat's why and there lies your problem\nyes so this is that's the road\nscar that you have to walk\nso like your whole problem is that you\nhave deviated away from that road for so\nlong\nit come kind of comes back to like not\nrecognizing like the value of\nexperiences\nand this is where like you have to walk\nthe dark road like you have to step away\nfrom the adaptive road\nand you know you should walk walk it\nwith care because you're\nlogically correct that oftentimes\nswimming in that ocean\nleads to self-destruction\nyes but like you know you\nyou gotta you have to walk that road\nand you try so hard to not walk that\nroad and like as long you can stay as\nadaptive as you want to but that thing\nwill not be fixed\nyes i well\nusually it's like a i tell my stream\nthis that usually a lot of problems get\nfixed because\nuh self-hatred i just hate it uh my\nlazy my self-hatred overcomes my\nlaziness so eventually like if i have a\nproblem\nlike i'll like that i hate i'll hate it\nenough to where\nit overcomes my want to not do anything\nabout it\nand then i end up fixing it or trying to\nfix it\nor working on it i think that we rely on\nnegative emotions a lot to spur us\nforward in life\nright so when you say self-hatred to\novercome laziness that makes a lot of\nsense to me\nand i think that like what we've got to\ndo for for you to be\nhappy because i don't think that you can\nbe happy in your whole being\nas long as like that darkness or that\nlittle\nball or whatever that is is there like\nyou can adapt around it\nlike you can you know build roads around\nit you can build walls around it you can\ndo all kinds of things\nyou can work on other things you can\nlearn how to be like proud of yourself\nwhich i think you genuinely have\nyou actually come across to me as like\nlike a relatively like confident and\nsecure person\ni think it's because i i know a lot i\nfeel like\nyou know when it says when a with age\ncomes wisdom\nyou tend to find out more about yourself\nas you go older\nand for me that means i've kind of yeah\ndone that i guess so my weaknesses\nmy strengths my faults are things that i\nhave a bigger understanding of as i've\ngone through multiple different\nsituations okay i think that\nunderstanding and wisdom are good things\ndo you feel angry at yourself scarra\nright now or about certain things or\nyeah sure uh\ni usually feel i usually feel frustrated\nmore so than anger what are you\nfrustrated by\num not dealing\nlike uh i guess\nuh a common thing will be like if people\nplay with me\nuh i tend to want them to feel good\nabout\nit like even if they don't say it\nafterwards like i can tell\nif like the mood was good or it wasn't\nso if i do a poor job\ni i bring like bad energy or i just\ndon't\naccommodate them well\nthen i feel frustrated or bad about it\na lot of times what are you frustrated\nby\nmy inability to make them have fun\nbecause i think a lot of the times\ni can do that i know i can do that\ntell me about that um so\nif i'm in the let's say it's very simple\nso like oh tv has a lot of friends\nokay like whatever so i bring in\nlet's say i bring in like just otv so we\nall play together\num i i mean it's just like looking\nout for people and making sure they're\nhaving fun if you can kind of tell if\nthey're not having a good time\nand like if that's happening usually\nyou'll see this very commonly uh that\nlike\nsomeone reaches out and like tries to\ntalk to them or get them more engaged\ninto the game\nuh or to like kind of work with them or\njust like you know shoot the [ __ ]\nso that they feel like they had a good\ntime that that's what i strive to do\nwhen i play with friends\nso what are you frustrated by when that\nfails\nwhen when it fails to happens and i\nthink\nsometimes i'm frustrated because there\nwere moments where i\nfeel like i could have been able to do\nthat and sometimes it's completely\nimpossible like they're just having a\nreally [ __ ] bad day\nand like it's it's like really\nimpossible to [ __ ] do that\nbut most of the times i feel like it's\npossible\nokay can you control the emotions of\nanother human being\ni wish um\nno but you can make it\nnot manipulate it but kind of guide them\ntowards certain emotions\nkind of like what you're doing right now\nokay a little bit yeah so but i mean\nyou try though right so here's what i'm\nhearing from you\nyou accept responsibility for other\npeople's enjoyment\nuh only when i feel like\ni could have made it more it could have\nmade it better\ndoes that make sense so\nthat's what's so damning so let me just\nrepeat back to you what you just said\ni only accept responsibility for other\npeople's enjoyment when i don't do a\ngood job at making them feel joy\nthat's a damning way of saying it i\nusually agree with most of what you\nyou say i think in that scenario\nit's more like there are certain\nscenarios that would play out like\ncertain\ncertain moments during the session where\ni'm like\noh i could have said this to help out a\nlittle bit more you know\nor this i could have done this instead\nto help out\na little bit more what's\nyep so i think here's the here's what\ni'm gonna draw for you okay scar\nwhen i shared with you so this is like\nokay i'm gonna explain it i don't know\nif this is gonna go in the right\ndirection or the wrong\ndirection but instinctively i'm feeling\nlike\ngoing for the throat emotionally here is\nlike a big mistake\nokay so i'm gonna play on the rational\nlevel okay\nso um yeah i'm just not i feel like\nyeah it's up to you i'm running into\nyour rational defense mechanisms and\nthere's a part of me that wants to pull\nout my\nsledgehammer and like smash them apart\nbut you can\ndo it i know you say that but i'm not\ngonna do that\nokay understandable so so here's the\nthing like i\nso like there's a part of you that i\nthink you don't feel\nlike you're good enough yes okay\nso like and it's interesting because it\npops out in weird ways and like i think\nwhat you've managed to do\nis like adapt around it which is very\ngood it's like what most people do\nright like you learn how to compensate\nfor your weaknesses\nit's kind of like you've got a bum leg\nso you like figure out you know like\nhow to you know walk with a limp and\nthen you grab a crotch or a cane or\nwhatever\nyou do whatever you need to to like get\nby\nand then what i find is that like a lot\nof our adaptive behaviors\nover time become maladaptive\nand this is where like the question like\ni'm really curious about your like\nromantic experiences\nit's something that i'm steering a\nlittle bit clear of\num we'll get there i'm gonna ask you\nbecause i've mentioned it now\nwhat are you feeling now i'm feeling\nthat i commonly stir away\nfrom relationships a lot of the times i\nfeel\nuh scared to pursue them because\nof the\ni feel like there's a large part of me\nthat considers my\nfriends and my friend group like my\nfamily and so\ni feel like there's a lot of even if\nthey don't have this\na lot of judgment that we're going to\nstop you there\nright so the reason i'm going to stop\nyou there is because it happened\nso i i mentioned romantic relationships\ni didn't even ask you about it and what\nwas your first\nresponse what was the first thing that\ncame out of your mouth\ni really just do not remember it was oof\nyes it's because i haven't been in the\nrelationship in years\nyes so so like that is the emotion\nand the second you skirt past that and\nyou go\nto i i start i feel scared you can own\nsome emotions and then you get into the\nrational explanation of i think about\nthem as family\nthat too is protective but we'll get\nlike we'll get to romance in a second\nbut we've got to take a step back and\nlike lay out some of this foundation\nso like your window of growth is going\nto be the oof\nand the closer we can sit with the\nthat's a little tough\nyou're damn right it is because like you\nknow exactly what i'm talking about you\ntry\nreally hard to get away from it\nyeah i can see that yep so we're gonna\nwe're gonna go there together okay\nbut like when you're ready we're gonna\ndo it very very gently kitty pool first\nsure okay so i don't even remember what\nthe kiddie pool is now but i want um\nhold on\ni blinked what were you talking about uh\nyou said you wanted for you i could only\ntalk or you want to talk about the oof\nportion yeah yeah and you'll get into\nthe kiddie pool\nyeah yeah you start with the kiddie pool\nand then you said\nyeah yeah before like that one i just\nwent the whole thing was a tangent so\nlet me just think for a second\ni have a grid oh we were talking about\nadaptation and maladaptation yeah right\nso like i think you've learned an\nadaptive way of getting around\nlike some like you know the feeling not\ngood enough oh we were talking about\nrelationships and you feeling frustrated\nwith yourself here it is okay\nso here's the thing when people are not\nfully secure in who they\nare and when they don't feel like\nthey're good enough like especially from\nlike an appearance standpoint or like\ni know this is going to sound weird i'm\njust going to put a word to it which i'm\nsure you'll have some resistance to\nbecause it's not the perfect word\nlovable so i think that you bring a lot\nof value\nto your friends and you try really\nreally hard\nto bring value to your friends you bring\nyou carry responsibility for their joy\non your shoulders\nyou're always thinking about enriching\ntheir experiences\nand you feel frustrated with yourself\nwhen they don't feel enough joy when\nthey have a bad day\nyou think about what you could have done\nbetter now\nabove the water that's caring it's being\na good friend\nunderneath the water i see this kind of\ndynamic\nin like i don't think that you have this\nbut i'm just gonna use this as an\nexample\nin like abusive relationships where you\nstart to really like\nfeel responsible for the feelings of\nother people around you i really don't\nthink that your friends are abusive or\nanything like that\nand and this is where the common element\nis like worth\nokay the common element is like\ni have to like make these people's lives\nbetter because\ni have to try so hard to make these\npeople's lives better\noh it's not that hard\nthey're my friends for a reason you know\nsure sure sure\nbut there's a seedy underbelly here\nwhich like i think is unfortunately like\nthat\nyou know you can't just be yourself\nlike what i'm noticing about your social\ninteractions is that they feel very\neffortful to me\nand this kind of gets back to this like\nand just because you've gotten good at\nit\nscarra gets back to like your original\nstatement which i'm sorry buddy but you\nimpaled yourself on this which is like\nthey only see me part of the time\nwhich tells me that like there's front\nfacing scarra\nand there's like back end scar yeah\nuh i don't think it's that different but\ni do agree\nsure\nright so so now what we really have to\nget into is like\nwhat is back end scara right and this is\nwhere like when we get to romantic\nrelationships we're gonna find\nall kinds of weird things that your mind\ndoes\nto keep you from like\nprotect you from like all the feelings\nthat you have so i'm gonna give you a\nhypothetical example\ni do not think that this applies to you\nsometimes the reason that people think\nabout friends as family is because\nthey're afraid\nof if of what would happen if they have\nromantic feelings towards their friends\nokay right so that's just an example\nokay so there are all kinds of\nadaptations that our mind will do\nto keep up to protect us from some of\nthe feelings that we may have\nnot that i agree with so like\nquestions thoughts no\nnothing i think i think it's like i\nunderstand why you bring up\nthe first part i agree with you with\nyour statement um yeah that's\ni don't have many thoughts on the matter\ni guess\nuntil we approach a different topic and\ni do agree i feel\nthat a lot of the talk right now is like\njust trying to target\nuh the things i've built safety\nmechanisms around to dodge\noh you're not yeah sorry um yes\nso i think that i i do\nspend a lot of time\ni guess i built the safety mechanism a\nlot earlier\nbecause uh it was there to make it so i\nguess dodged uh\nnegative feelings or negative points\nyep um and uh\nrather than focus on like a lot of my\nnegative stuff i would just find ways to\nmake it productive and focus\non how to enrich my life\num i do now understand that some of it\nif not a lot of it is\nuh i guess uh\nbuilt in deeply to the point where it's\ndifficult to\nshake from yep so we're gonna start that\nprocess today so i'm going to share a\ncouple of things okay\nand then i want you to give me a\ndirection okay so\nthe first is that we've got two options\nhere and this may be like a two-parter\nkind of thing but like\nnot it doesn't have to be but i feel\nlike we probably\nshould separate out the content of what\nyou're protecting\nfrom the mechanism with which you're\nprotecting it\nokay can i take a minute to use the\nrestroom i\nyes literally drink the whole thing okay\ni'll be right back\nwe doing good chat we're good scar is\nknocking it out of the park\noh so for the people who are saying\nalmost there\nthat means we need to back away\nyeah dude he's got some he's got some\nwicked he's like a dodge tank\njust watch the dodge right and like it's\nreally hard to be a dodge tank\nand like willingly like not move when\nthe blow is coming\nit's it goes against everything that\nyou've trained your body to do\nso that's the thing i i don't think he's\ntoo tanky\nhis evasion is through the roof oh we're\njust using our video game analogies yeah\nmy evasions through the room yeah yeah\nall right what i was explaining to chad\nis that you know it's hard for you to\nget hit but anyway um so here's the\nthing so like the mechanism so we've got\ntwo options we can dig into\nthe content of what you protect yourself\nagainst\nor we can kind of focus on that\nmechanism of like forcing you to sit in\nthat space\nand like take the hit instead of\nskirting past it\nso let me give you just an example okay\nso you say that like\nwhen it comes to like we could talk\nabout the content of romantic\nrelationships i'm pretty sure that what\nwe'll uncover is that\nyou have these negative emotions which\nlike prompt you to do certain actions\nand we can kind of dig into that\nor we can see like the mechanism through\nwhich your adaptations have formed\ndoes that make sense i think the\nmechanisms might be more helpful for me\ni think so too i think it'll be safer as\nwell\nyeah so like we're still go i'm going to\nask you hard-hitting questions but like\nthere's a\ndifferent direction that i'm going to go\nso yeah ask you a hard-hitting question\ni'm not gonna follow up with another\nhard-hitting question\nyou're gonna dodge and then i'm gonna i\ncould follow up with another\nhard-hitting question\nor we can just see how you dodged and\nsee what you dodged away from\nthat's the most important thing okay\nokay\nso like tell me about how you feel about\nromantic relationships\nuh i guess really scared i think when\nyou're in the public eye uh\nit's you read a lot of bad things\nand i constantly feel like\nuh either i won't be\nyeah i guess i'm i'm really worried\nabout what another\nin the what another variable would do\nintroduced to my life that's already in\na good position\nand then there's already a lot of\nvariables attached to it that could have\nthat i'm scared of okay what\nwhat are you scared of\nchat got it\nchad just saw the dodge it was really\ngood so we'll get there\num putting myself out there\nwhat does that mean i don't know\nlet me let me think give me a sec give\nme a second\nmaybe being afraid\ni don't know okay that's okay so\nwe're making progress now we're swimming\nin the deep dark ocean because you can't\nsee it\nso i think this is actually a step\nforward so the more that you say i don't\nknow\nwhat that certainly isn't is a logical\ndefense mechanism\ndoes that make sense but when i ask you\nlike\njust think about this for a second okay\nwhen i ask someone why are you scared of\nengaging in a relationship\nand they say there are lots of variables\nthat could affect my life like that's\nthe dodge of the century\nsure yeah right so i'll try asking you\nthe question again\nwhat are you afraid of scar\nbeing not good enough for someone else\nwhen i already feel like i'm not good\nenough\nfor myself okay\nso i don't know if your cognitive\nempathy is so good\nthat you have manufactured that response\nbecause that's what i'm looking for that\nwas a good one right\nit was a really good show i don't know\neither i'll be honest with you\nno i think it was genuine i i think what\nyou're learning how to do is like\nvocalize how you feel right and and your\nlogic is working for you now\ninstead of like protecting you\nso like you can piece things together if\nyou're willing to swim around in that\nspace\ni also do not think it is a coincidence\nthat that statement\ncame after you said i don't know a\ncouple of times\nokay something can be easier as a robot\nlife would be easier as a robot but yeah\nso you've tried very hard to be a robot\n[Music]\nright so so now like let's think about\nthat right like so like\nhave you been so now we're gonna go\ncloser to the throat\nokay it's not quite the killing blow\nbecause i'm not gonna strike all the way\nbut we're gonna get close\nso like have you been we're not going to\nmention any names\nwe're going to complete anonymity okay i\nstrongly encourage you\neven if you say i'm an open book doctor\nk we're not going to do that\nso have you been has there been someone\nthat you've been romantically interested\nin the last three years\nmaybe but i think i do a good\nway of rationalizing against it makes\nyep so we're gonna say the answer is yes\nwhen i ask you the question\ninstead of giving me the answer i want\nyou to like i'm gonna ask you did you\nthink about a particular person\ni don't know i'm going to say that the\nanswer is yes\ni i i don't know and that's my serious\nanswer let me continue to continue let\nme think about it\nright so like i know we said we weren't\ngoing to say it\nbut i need you to think it at least\nyou don't have to tell a damn soul i\ni've certainly crushed on someone before\nsure but go ahead so like\nthink about the last person that you\ncrushed on\nokay and if the last three years like i\njust don't\ni find it very hard to believe although\ni'm willing to be wrong but we're not\ngonna ask you\nso we can't you know that like there's\nyou gotta have crushed on someone in the\nlast three years bro\nsure yeah right so like just think about\nthat person\nokay okay so like when you think about\nthat person\nlike did you ever entertain\nthoughts of being in like a relationship\nwith them\nno yes maybe initially but immediately\nno\nso how to help us understand\ninitially what your thoughts were\nit would be complicated that's\nwhere that's when that's where they went\nwhere did they start\ni i think they started with the simple\nidea that i thought that\ni wasn't attractive enough\nfor them okay\nand then it ended at the thoughts i said\nprior\nyep good so so that's like i think we\nall know that\nby now right like i think you don't have\nto be\ndr k to figure out that's what's\nhappening so now like here's the\nchallenge\nokay and this is why i'm digging into\nthis scara\nbecause i think that like i know this\nsounds weird\ni think you are attractive enough for\nthem\nand i think the real sad thing is that\nit is your belief\nthat you're not attractive enough for\nthem that is\nactually like becoming the\nself-fulfilling prophecy\nof like the current romantic state that\nyou're in\noh that\nso like this is where like i know that\nyour mind goes to complications and\nvariables\nwhen you don't feel good enough and this\nis really important to understand\nthe mind loves complexity\nright so like let me just ask you this\nis another read my mind question\nso i if i'm like working with like let's\nsay i'm supposed to meet a partner for a\nschool project\nand they show up an hour late and they\ngive me like 15 reasons why they're\nlate what happens when they say the\nfirst reason\nwhat happens to my [ __ ] meter the\nmore reasons they give me for why\nthey're right\nthey're late at some point i would just\nassume they didn't care\nabsolutely and if they give me one\nreason\nif they just say i overslept i'm so\nsorry versus\ni overslept and then my dog pooped and\nthen this happened and then i think it's\nmore\ntruthful yes right so like the more your\nmind\ncomes up with variables and\ncomplications and the more variables it\nadds to the\nequation the more bs that your mind is\nengaging in yes\nwith you and so like this comes back to\nlike\nnow we get to the real problem which is\noh [ __ ] i don't even know how to ask\nthis\ni'm trying to ask this in an open-ended\nquest way\nbut so you don't think you're good\nenough\nfor them right uh yes\nto some extent sure sure i i feel like\nif i'm not good enough for myself\nthere's no way i want to bring that to\nsomeone else\nyeah i'm with you there okay so like\nthat that makes a lot of sense to me so\nso and this was where we get\nback to you know what do you see when\nyou look in the mirror and i think you\nsee something that's not good enough\nand and so then the question becomes\nlike\ncan you act without being good enough\nabsolutely wait really i don't know\nhow you define act so like like\nwhat so specifically i guess what i what\ni mean is like\ncan you ask someone out if you feel like\nyou're not good enough for them\nconfidently hell though\nbut you can it's possible\nis it though i don't mean theoretically\ni mean for you\noh no okay right wait wait i thought you\nmeant like theoretically because like\nlike yeah but but like yeah i'll be sure\nbut that's the problem right so like\nonce again we see it which is like your\nmind like gets to this\nlike when i ask you a question it's just\nlike because bro at some point like\nyou're gonna crush on someone again\nright\nyeah and i want you to chase love bro\nright and and this is where like like\nthis is where like a nice\nthere's emotion i can see it you're\nlaughing yeah like what are you feeling\ni think that'd be nice i i think\nthere's negative emotion i don't see\nniceness in your face oh\num when i tell you to chase love how do\nyou feel\nwould be nice as a projection of the\nlogical mind\nyes it would be maybe\ni feel like it will happen\nhmm\ni i feel like i'm taking some steps to\nget there\ni guess yes but i don't know\nlike outside of this conversation yep\nyep yep so that's\ndangerous yes okay because you're\ntaking steps yes right so like now\nyou're waiting for preparation\nyou're gonna get yourself in shape\nyou're going to learn to be good enough\nand then you will ask\nsomeone i don't know if you're bisexual\nheterosexual homosexual\npansexual whatever so like when you ask\nsomeone\nout like you're like it'll happen one\nday when you're ready\ni understand the danger of that good\nlogic what is the alternative that's\nthat's also very good\nbecause what i'm hearing in that\nstatement is i think when i ask you like\ni want you to chase love i think what\nyou feel is abject\nterror\nfear is definitely one of the emotions\nthat comes up what else is there\n[Music]\num\nmaybe disbelief a little bit like\nespecially during covid i uh my ability\nto socialize\nin fact i i think a lot with a lot a lot\nof other people are similar as probably\nthrough the floor but sure i think covet\nis causing lots of problems and\nif i think if covid wasn't happening\nyour mind would find another excuse\nyes absolutely i'm really good at that\nyes so this is where like you will\nyou know like this is where like scarra\nlike i want you to think back to that\nearly phase when you were crushing on\nsomeone and like what\ngot in the way\nand it's so hard because like your your\nevasion is through the roof so you\nquickly went to all the variables\nbut like yeah and i'm trying to go back\nso\nand that's where it becomes a little\ndifficult uh\ncan you so i i don't want to mess up\nyour life maybe\nmaybe a little bit of fear rejection but\num\ni guess it's like\nfear of the unknown maybe okay a little\nbit\nyeah i think fear of rejection makes\nsense but like\ni know this sounds kind of weird but\nlike do you feel comfortable\ntelling us a story about someone that\nyou were attracted to or crushing on\nbecause i think this is where like if\nyou tell us the story we'll be able to\ndiscover the emotion\nbecause i you don't have to look for it\nbecause i think it's hard for you to see\ni but you may not feel comfortable and i\ncertainly don't want to complicate your\nlife if you have to like if people are\ngoing to try to stitch together the\npieces because\ni think yeah is very important here i\nthink\nthis is not something that i would say\non this show because\ni don't want any kind of weird rumors\nspreading or any of that it's just not\nfun\nyep i'm with you 100 so i i'm just\nnow i have to try to problem solve for\nlike how are we gonna access the emotion\nbecause if you tell us the story the\nemotion is gonna be there\ncan we go further back can we pick\nsomeone that like\nyou maybe had a similar response to that\nis like\nolder than three years like five years\nseven years\nthat like is there any example you can\ngive us that will be drama free\nooh if you can't that's fine too\ni don't i can't remember like that's the\nthing sure sure\nlike i don't know if it's repressed\nmemory but just in general it's\ndifficult\nokay no no no it's i know it's difficult\nthat's that's why like\nso sometimes when people are having\ntrouble with memory and accessing\nemotions\noftentimes they can tell a story right\nso like\nlike you can tell a story like you\ntalked about you know for example like\ntraveling all over the world and things\nlike that\nand then we can dig at the emotion\nunderneath if we can get you talking\nnow it's just a problem because i don't\nknow like i think this is\nlike this self-esteem not being able to\nlike risk\nyou know giving giving a shot at love is\nlike\ni mean this we gotta fix from you're\ngonna fix something it's like you gotta\nyou gotta like\ntry to love you know you gotta you gotta\ntake that chance and i think the problem\nis that you don't wanna take the chance\nbecause you don't even think it's a\nchance you think it's\na mess\nyeah i would agree with most of that\nstatement\nso what what are we gonna do about it\nscarra\ni am trying to\nfigure it out which is why i'm\nuh out loud for us think out loud\nokay well currently i'm trying to\nremember\nif\nhuh\ni'm trying to remember ways that don't\nsound like deflection\nand just feel it\napart don't worry squirrel yeah as much\nas you want to just there's there's just\na bunch of\nrandom things why i feel\ngood can you share them with us\num i think a lot of\nthe based on what i do every day\nas well as the contract i signed\nthat i don't have it's it's\ndifficult to balance i guess\nuh working on my relationships with my\nfriends\nas well as working on a relationship\nwith myself and then with someone else\nthat's always sense to me yeah i agree\nwith you in the fact\nthat i'm definitely i definitely put\nlike\nromance aside for stuff and something\ni've been very frank about\nwith people it's like yes i did do that\nto pursue like\na career like i definitely put like\nfirst yeah\num and\nthe a lot of scary parts about being\nlike\nespecially kind of an older uh\nperson uh in this\nbase i would say because i a lot of my\npeers are\nuh in their 20s still\nso i think that\na lot of the times when\ni i feel like it's difficult to be it's\nimpossible to meet someone if you don't\nput yourself out there\nand\ni can't it's i'm definitely not putting\nmyself out there by streaming every day\nexcept for maybe to like fans that\nmessage me and tell me they're\nthey're like 20 and i immediately\nlike blocked them or don't [ __ ]\ninteract with them because that's\n[ __ ] weird\num what's weird yeah\ni think the age gap is crazy and i think\nthe power dynamic is crazy\nand i would not want to be in that\nhole where i've seen a lot of other\npeople get absolutely\ndestroyed uh it's not something i want\nfor myself\nnot something i want for any of my peers\nsure\nyou mentioned your age a couple of times\ndo you mind if i ask how old you are\noh i'm uh 31. i almost had to think for\na sec\nbecause i'm either 30 or 31 i can never\nremember\ni think\nyeah that doesn't make any sense but\nyeah uh you don't think it makes sense\ni i think it's just a random [ __ ]\nrole uh\nlet me i i think it makes as much sense\nas anything else\nyeah sure um it's just like i've never\nheard the origin of it i've\npeople have just always said it to me\nand i'm just like\nokay what is half my age plus seven you\nround up\nwhat does that even [ __ ] mean okay so\nso it's\n23 for you which sounds like a little\nbit young i feel like it's like 24\nyeah but like sure yeah is the minimum\num hmm so i'm hearing a lot of what\nyou're saying scar so i'm going to\nchange tax\nfor a minute so like now we're going to\nbe\ninstead of smashing through your defense\nmechanisms and being logical i'm gonna\nbe like\nemotionally supportive okay okay i'm\ngonna be on your team now\ninstead of the aggressor oh nice okay\nso we'll see where that gets us so be\nprepared for the shift\nokay so what i'm hearing you say is that\nlike\nyou know there are a lot of we're going\nto do a little bit of what we call\nmotivational interviewing\nokay i've never heard this before okay\ni'm ready\nso this is a it's a clinical technique\nthis is not therapy by the way so you\ncan do it with other people you know it\ndoesn't have to be a part of like a\nmedical\noh nice actually i can't wait to pull\nthis out but\num essentially what we're going to try\nto do is like help you\nmove one step closer to being able to\nlike\nask someone out okay okay\nso in the way so here's how here's how\nit goes so like here's what i'm hearing\nfrom you first of all\num there are a lot of things that are\nimportant to you right now like so i\nthink your career is important to you\nyour friendships are important to you\nand working on yourself is important to\nyou yes absolutely\nand what i'm also hearing is that like\nwhen it comes to romantic relationships\nlike\ni'm almost getting the sense that you're\nfollowing the advice\nthat most people give to people who are\nlonely\nwhich is work on yourself and it'll\nhappen\nthat does seem\nat least parallel sure yeah how do you\nfeel about that that's okay\nlike i don't mind paralleling advice\ni i always am hesitant to take advice\nfully\nbut like i i mean\ni think i'm pretty i think i'm pretty\ni i always tend to take the approach\nwhere you\nit's better huh well [ __ ] i can't even\nsay this because that's not what i'm\ndoing\nright now um so i was gonna say\nit's better to try and fail because at\nleast you know it didn't work\nwhich i do for some other parts of my\ncareer\nbut maybe not for my romantic life\ni'm confused are you now thinking about\ntrying and failing\num no it's more like i don't do that so\nthat's why i'm saying that like\ni do that with a lot of other parts of\nmyself\nso like stuff like making otv stuff like\nyou know a lot of my early career path\nwhen it came toward\nplaying professionally dropping college\nstuff like that but like it i don't\nfollow\nthat philosophy i guess when it comes to\nromance well i mean it sounds like it's\na bad idea when it comes to romance and\nit's a good idea when it comes to other\nphilosophies\nlike other parts um i do think the\ngeneral idea is still good which is like\nputting yourself out there is good\nand like that's what like we've come\nkind of come to agreements that\ni'm not doing well yeah but i mean i\nthink you've got good reasons to not do\nit we just\nsaid those right like\ni mean you can't do everything at once\nyes\nbut i feel like i are you the rational\npart of me now\nlike i feel like now you're my defense\nmechanism because what you just said is\nstuff that i would say to myself\nso i'm wondering like are there just two\nand as i become as i become the rational\npart of you what do you become\num worried\noh worried\num yeah i i mean you did say you're\nswitching\nbut i i am\nnow worried because i have to now take\nyour position\nyou were just in yes so now we've kind\nof flip-flopped\nso huh\nand that's motivational interviewing ah\nexcellent right because here you are i\nthat\nhappened way faster than i expected it\nto but well done\nand you saw through it and i sort of\nbecause it's interesting right because\nlike\nhere i am taking your side and then\nsuddenly you're talking about oh like\ni do this in other parts of my life but\ni don't do this in romance\nand if i said that to you what would you\nhave said\nwhy you have asked me why\nno if if i said to you oh scara\nyou you are willing to fail in terms of\ncareer and friendships but you're not\nwilling to fail in terms of romance\nwhat would your response have been\na bunch of reasons i already gave\nexactly\nyou would have dodged and now\nyou're feeling weird because i think\nlike\nyou're beginning to like gain insight\ninto the fact that you're not doing the\nright thing\nand now i've stopped being you and i've\nstarted being me again and here comes\nthe resistance\nso let's say yeah sorry is this when you\nsay statements like you're not doing the\nright thing\ni kind of take that as like a attack on\nmy personal whole\nas opposed to just an attack on what\nwe're talking about\nso i had to wait a second to kind of\ndisjoint the two um\nand now i'm okay whereas like\nhave you felt personally attacked by me\nbefore during this conversation\num\ni feel like everything we've talked\nabout has been very personal\nhave you felt personally attacked by me\nbefore in this conversation\nattack is a strong word no okay\nso like i know this is kind of weird but\nyou just felt attacked by me\nright a little bit yeah\nyeah so how like so now let's look at it\nlogically okay so this is this is a\ngreat example of motivational\ninterviewing\ni mean in terms of how people feel and i\nthink your insight\nactually scarra is like really really\nhelpful because it's i couldn't explain\nthis\nso like you said we're gonna just use\nyour statements okay\neverything we've talked about is\npersonal now\nyou feel like you haven't been attacked\nwhy do you feel like you're being\nattacked\nnow and i think it's because\nyeah go ahead you seem like you have a\nhypothesis no\ncontinue so as i take your\nside as i become you\nyou become me and as you become me\nthe emotions and the vulnerability\nincreases\nyou begin to see how you're not actually\ntaking a chance\nyou begin to like feel that\nvulnerability and once the vulnerability\narises\nthe same [ __ ] that i've been saying this\nentire time\nfeels like an attack but why does it\nfeel like an attack because your\ndefenses are down\nand you even saw it happen you were like\nwait you're being me\nnow i'm your defense i'm holding your\nshield\nand so you're left without one and then\nlike a benign statement that i make\nmakes you feel attacked\nyes yes somewhat yes\nokay so like if you want if we could\njust do it again\nand see what happens like even if you\nhave insight it's not gonna change\nso this is what happens when you work\nwith people empathically\nawareness of the thing doesn't stop it\nfrom happening\nabsolutely right so like where do you\nwant to go from here because now i'm\nconfused because i was expecting the mi\nstuff to take way longer\nfor you to start to feel these things i\ngot that\ni got a big brain scarra\ni don't know i think that uh\nwhen you talk to me about saying\nwhen i at the point that i felt attacked\nwas when you told me um\nthat it was like a holistic statement\nabout\nthat everything i'm doing is wrong or\nsomething like that\num when you were specifically targeting\nlike i guess we were talking about the\nromance side and i immediately thought\nfor a second that you're talking about\nme as a whole\nso like i felt defensive there\nbecause i'm at least confident enough to\nbe like\ni got my i got my [ __ ] unlocked like i i\nthink some of it\ni'm doing really well sure so\nlet me just take a step back and\napologize if i you know\nif i made a statement that was an attack\non you as well oh no\ni was actually thinking i was speaking\nhypothetically i wasn't even talk i was\nlike\ntrying to mirror what i thought you\nwould think but anyway\nso let's just try this one more time\nokay\nso what i'm hearing from you is that\nlike basically you kind of don't have\nthe bandwidth for a relationship right\nnow\npossibly help me understand the possibly\nbecause it sounds like it you know you\nreally are working on a lot of like\nreally important things\nit's\ni think on some empathetic level\nwhen i look toward what i do with my\nfriends\nand that sometimes i fail\ni wouldn't want to bring someone i\nwouldn't want to\ndate someone where\nthat could happen but maybe that's just\nfear in general of the situation\nsure i mean i i but i see where you're\ncoming from right so like\nwhat i let me know if i i'm hearing you\ncorrectly\nso like here you are and and sometimes\nyour friends\nlike you have interactions with people\nthat you care about\nwhere you end up like not being able to\ngive them the experience\nthat you really want them to have or\nmaybe they deserve to have\nyeah i mean that's just when it comes to\ngames but yes yeah i mean like like you\nwant to care about your friends right\nlike you want to enrich their lives\nlet's put it out sure\nyes and and it sounds like it sounds\nkind of like premature to me to engage\nin a romantic relationship if you're not\nable to consistently do that\nbecause what if you are not able to\nenrich their lives\nit's not my job to do that\nbut i i now i'm confused scar because i\nthought that like\nthat that's that's how i feel but i\nlogically understand my job isn't the\nfix all problem\ndoes that make sense yeah sort of but\nlike i'm\nnow i'm confused okay no because like\nyep and this is the point of\nmotivational interviewing oh my\n[ __ ] god right so now what we're\ndoing is we're breaking down\nall of your logical conceptions which\nare no longer holding\nso now you're in the question mark zone\nsure\nand like if we think about motivating\nyou to date i could give you a\nthousand reasons and you would swat them\nall down because you're in the no zone\nand as we move from the no zone to the\nyes zone what do we have to pass in the\nmiddle\nhell you're damn right which is the\nquestion mark zone\nbecause now you don't know\nmaybe you should ask someone out\nbecause hold on a second it's not your\njob to make them happy\ncorrect but when i ask you why you don't\nask someone out you're like well when it\ncomes to my like\nfriendly relationships like i'm not able\nto consistently like make them feel good\nand create like positive experiences\nthat does sound like a weird excuse not\nyou mentioned that\nno bro it's not a weird excuse like it\nmakes sense\nlike just like like we're training up\nyou're leveling your relationship skills\nbefore you start dating someone\nhow is that not make sense\ni think\nthat is just a very mechanical way of\nthinking about things\ni usually don't like\ni when i do logic i logic stuff\nrobotically\nbut i don't actually think\ncompletely in that regard\nso help me understand how like what's\nwrong with thinking logically about this\nabsolutely nothing but i think that it's\nuntrue to my own self to say that i\nonly think logically like that all the\ntime\nwhen i present ideas to people i find it\neasiest to present them\nentirely logically but when i act upon\nthings\nvery rarely is it fully logical i guess\nand that's something i want to make\nclear because it feels like that's\nmaybe a little bit of a misconception\nand i i completely understand why i'm\nthe reason that misconception exists\nbecause of the way i i speak and the way\ni communicate\ncan you help me understand because like\nhonestly bro it makes a lot of sense to\nme like here's what i'm hearing\ni think it makes a lot of sense but i\ndon't do it so like\nso i don't want to come out as\ndisingenuous how do you\nso then just please explain it like what\nwhat about\nso i'm gonna say it again okay and then\ni i'd really appreciate it if you could\nhelp me understand like what i'm missing\nokay so you're working on\nleveling up your relationship skill sure\nbefore you engage in a romantic\nrelationship like that needs to be like\nyou know platinum tear oh god\nlet's let's let's go higher than that we\nset the bar pretty low but yeah sure\nokay right which\nlittle bit of insight right there um\nbut but like what's wrong with like what\nam i missing there because that makes\nsense right like if i want to\nif i want to like you know\ni guess i just don't like my life being\ntalked about so robotically\nbecause i i think that like i don't want\nto take away\nfrom this to be like man that guy is\nreally logical with everything like\nlike i think that like when i put myself\nout that way like that\nis how i i present myself and it's a\nlittle bit\ndisingenuous because it's not completely\nme\nit's like a good example of this i don't\nknow how to do this um\nit's like i may logically think about a\nlot of scenarios and how it plays out\nright but rather brian\nis that my phone oh\nno that's lily's phone god damn um okay\num\ni think a way i can describe it\nis\ncan i ask a question yeah\nso just help us understand like i don't\nthink you're an all logical dude\nyeah can you just fill in the\nnon-logical part of this\ni think i logic my way up until i can\nset up a framework\nokay and then i just fill out the\nframework\nif that makes sense so i guess a good\nexample would be how i prepared my last\nshow\nwould be like i did\nwhen i was doing the run of show and\nbreaking down the show\nlike the night before i it was like\nall improv slash like random [ __ ] in the\nmiddle\nlike i didn't fully write down like how\nwe're gonna do everything because i was\nlike [ __ ] it we could just wing this\nbut like uh when i present stuff i don't\npresent it like that i present like oh\nwe calculate all these we did the\n[ __ ] metrics and the numbers\ni converted this and i ran it through\nthe pythagorean theorem\ni think people think that i may have\nmisconstrued\nmyself by presenting myself that way\nso now it seems to me like you're\nconcerned about being perceived a\nparticular way\nyes a little bit about a little bit for\nthe people watching\nbut a little bit to you because i just\ndon't want to come across as\ndisingenuous or\ni don't i feel like if we're going to\ntry to like\ntalk about me i want you to know that\nlike that's not like\nlike i just want that to put that out\nthere okay\nso how do i signal to you that i don't\nthink you're disingenuous\nand i don't think you're a robot oh\nthat's fine no we're good you can keep\ngoing\nokay\ni think while i was in the middle of\ntalking about that i was like [ __ ] it\nyou probably know what i mean\nso like i kind of already figured it out\nmyself so you can keep going\nokay god prank you i'm sorry\nno no that's fine i think there's\nsomething important there but we're not\ngoing to dig into that right now\nbut anyway so so i'm i'm just noticing\nlike we could take a third stab at\nmotivational interviewing if you want to\nbut like i'm kind of\nconcerned a little bit about how taxed\nwe may be what do you think scara\ni'm okay but i want to let you know that\nlike i have probably like\n18 minutes unfortunately because i have\nto go to a shoot\nso i don't think that's unfortunate at\nall\ni think that we're given well it's\nunfortunate for me\nbecause i feel like i'd like to talk to\nyou more but like\nuh i understand the like yeah yeah\nso so if you've got a shoot i'm i'm i i\nthink that we've covered a lot of ground\nand i also find that talking for like\nlonger than two hours at a stretch\ntends to have people rewriting the early\npart\ni could see that so in my experience two\nhours tends to be the limit\nof like productive insight before you\nstart like it's like your ram capacity\nand then you've got to like ride it to\nthe hard disk\nand then you can kind of revisit so i'm\nkind of curious if you've got about 18\nminutes 17 minutes left\ncan you share with us what your\nwhat this conversation has been like for\nyou and maybe like\nif you've gained something what you've\ngained\noh it's been nice i tend to not be able\nto talk to many people who are\nas ex who have your particular set of\nskills i i feel like\nyou almost have to train to be\nthe level communicator at like that\nyou've hit\nthe level of communication that you've\nhit like you hit like\nlike up here like we're talking like the\ntop\nright um and i don't really\ninteract with many people that have hit\nthat level\nespecially to the point\nwhere they can communicate to me like\nthis\ni also think that like uh for me\nuh i guess it brought\nmore stuff forward that i\ni didn't realize i was deflecting that\nhard i didn't know before going in that\ni do that\nbut rather than saying deflecting it's\njust something that like\ni just put to this side because i\nconsider it\nunproductive to focus on the negatives\nand that's why\nmy life has never been to focus on what\ni've achieved but always look toward the\npresent and the future\nwhich comes at i would say\ni'm i'm now learning somewhat of an\nexpense to myself\nbut i think any strategy you take is\ngoing to come at an expense\ni think that the one that i took\nis like just very readily apparent here\num i\nyeah um aside from that\ni think\nit's been fairly enlightening it's like\ni'm talking to\nusually when i come to these conclusions\nlike maybe i would have achieved this\nlevel of clarity or this conclusion like\nmonths from now or even years from now\nuh it's usually with a conversation\nfor with another person like such as\nyourself or i've marinated on the idea a\nlot\nand i've really just like got myself to\na point where\nwhat the hell is going on um and so it's\nnice that i'm able to\nuh see this before earlier rather than\nlater\nlater yeah can you help me understand um\nwhat has been enlightening about the\nconversation\nit's like peering into a door\nthat you knew\nyou thought you knew what was inside but\nit's a little bit different than what\nyou originally thought like you thought\ni thought that like\nuh it was maybe like uh the door had\na house inside but i'm slowly starting\nto realize\nthat the house uh it's a full damn\nmansion\nyou know um and bigger than you expected\nyeah a little bigger than i expected and\ni know\ni thought i knew that i locked away\nbehind the door\nbut it's a little bit more than i\noriginally thought\nokay um so i i appreciate the\nyou know the the high praise in terms of\nmy communication skill and stuff like\nthat like i i think it's\num thank you very much for saying that\ni don't think i would\ni mean you're one of the people that\nwhen i\ni used to have this high school teacher\nthat would use\nbig words but wouldn't make me feel\nsmall about my intelligence level\nand i think she was one of the most\nbrilliant people i had\never known uh she went on to do like i\nwant to do really good things but she\nwas one of my favorite teachers ever\nand you remind me a lot about her in the\nsense that i think\nyou obviously have a mastery of\nvocabulary and education that your\nguests do not\nor i do not but you're able to kind of\ntalk to them in a way that doesn't make\nthem feel\nthat it doesn't feel like you're\nflaunting it over them but rather you're\ntrying to meet them at a level where\nthey are understanding like\nthe only goal of the conversation is for\nthem to be\ninvolved i should say\ni need a moment to think about how i'm\ngoing to respond to this\noh so here's my response how the [ __ ]\nscarra do you think that you would not\noffer something amazing in a romantic\nrelationship\nwhere the [ __ ] is that\nyou know when you're friends because i\nhad heard about you\nbefore this and i'd heard all of these\nwonderful things from people who i\nunderstand\nthat they are they hide me up alive yeah\nboy do you have something juicy to offer\nand now we get to the question of like\nwhich one's the real you\nbecause i think now it's my turn you're\nready\nyeah okay so this is this is where you\nsay\nlike oh i may have trained a lot but i\nthink i think we're\nin the in the same weight class when it\ncomes to expressing authentic\nappreciation about other human beings\nso here's here's what i'd say okay\nto begin with you mentioned that you\nknow you may have gotten here on your\nown if you had marinated about it\nyes and i'd say that part of the reason\nthat this conversation has come\nso far is sure i'm good at what i do\nbut ultimately like it depends on you\ntoo i think the reason this conversation\ncame so far is because you have been\ndoing a lot of marinating\nyou are the first person all i do is\nthat\nand i think that shows and i think it\nhas a lot of value\nand i think that like despite whatever\neducation you have or don't have\nyou're a thinker and you're like a\ncritical thinker and we talked about\nyour intelligence as a defense mechanism\nbut make no mistake that it is actually\nlike a very powerful tool too\nyou're the first person that i've ever\ntalked to that so quickly realizes what\ni'm doing to them\nso even when i tell people like what i'm\ngonna do to them they usually don't get\nit\nlike it it works on them and then we\nhave to sit down but like you noticed\nright away that like i was becoming you\nand it still had its effect\nand i think that like part of the reason\nthat you have difficulty\nlike i think that you're a very genuine\nperson i think you\nbring a lot to the table i know that\nthere are parts that go all the way down\nto the core of your being that\nunderstand that\ni think you have walked this journey of\nlike self-esteem and confidence and\ngetting to know yourself\nto where you genuinely know that you\nhave something amazing to offer other\nhuman beings\nyes okay so\ni was waiting for the resistance there\nbut we'll just keep go we'll just keep\ngoing i have\nconfidence in parts of myself my\nmy self-worth is yeah yeah it's it's\nit's\nright so now we get to the what i'd like\nto really encourage you to think about\nright which is that there are parts of\nyourself i just think that honestly like\nit's a straight-up cognitive bias\nwhere like like if something weird\nhappens in your mind where when you\nstart to think about romantic\nrelationships or not\nnot necessarily romantic relationships i\nthink it's just like\ndeep relationships that you care about\nwhich don't have to be romantic\nthat something gets in the way of\nrecognizing\nthe value that you bring and it's not\nnecessarily that you don't even it maybe\nrecognizes the right word\nit's that the value that you bring\nactually this is a better word\ngets contaminated by this other thing\ngets contaminated by what you\nthink of that instinctive it's not even\nwhat you think of the instinctive\nreaction when you look at yourself in\nthe mirror\nand then you think like i have to work\non this and all that stuff\nis true and this is where we kind of get\nto your adaptation like i think that\nyou're right\nthat you know you kind of said that\neveryone has to grow and like everyone\nhas to like\nadapt and that comes at a cost which is\nbeautifully said\ndamn scar you're so insightful like\npeople that therapists will train for\nyears to recognize this it took me years\nto recognize\nwhat you sort of put together in in two\nhours\nsit with the praise don't deflect it\nawkward hard i know sit with it you take\nit\n[Applause]\nokay now we keep going i'm not done with\nyou yet\ni told you we're in we're in the same\nweight class\nso i'm you know you can authentically\npraise me i'm gonna do the same to you\ni'm gonna keep going here's the chaos\nbut but i i think i think really scar\nlike\nyou know there's some contaminant\nthere's something that gets in the way\nof recognizing that and i i really think\nthat like\nare you overweight probably i can't\nreally tell because i haven't seen you\nstand up but like if you're overweight\nlike sure you can work on that\nand this is the other thing just because\nyou're overweight doesn't mean that\nyou're\nunlovable which i know logically you\nunderstand\nright i have a lot\nof beautiful friends and so\nthey i i feel like living in l.a warps\nmy\nsense of uh like\nuh i guess self-image quite a bit\nsure and something that i definitely\nknow happens\nyep so so that's that's very logical\nvery neuroscientific very\npsychological and at the same time this\nis if there's\none thing that i would ask you to do\nit's to catch yourself before you dodge\ngoing forward to notice that the next\ntime you're crushing on someone\nor yeah\nthe next time you're crushing on someone\ncatch yourself\nand look for that contaminant look for\nlike the way that you wriggle\nout of like not wanting to try right and\nit's okay like you\nyou don't have to try but at least see\nit\nyeah i think it's a lot easier to\nrecognize when it gets pointed out\nyep that's our goal so i definitely\nthink that that's my biggest takeaway\nyep good that's what i would leave with\nyou because you don't have to fix this\novernight i'm not saying go out\nand ask this person that you've been\ncrushing on for years\nask him out i'm not saying do that\nnext the next time it happens\ncatch yourself notice what your\nadaptations are\ngoing to do and you're right that like\nyou can you can only grow in one\ndimension at a given time\nand it's like one of these rpgs where\nlike in order to get like you know if\nyou want a min max you have to take\nnegative traits\nand so that's what we do right as you\ngrow\nas you become a league of legends\nprofessional as you like you know\nlike do all this stuff with otv as you\nvalue yourself and you start to put\nothers first like\nall that kind of stuff comes at a price\nand this is where like i think the next\nphase of your growing is to like\nyou know undo some of that stuff\nand start to i i know you're all for\nworking on yourself and that you could\nbe better\nbut like i think what you've really got\nto work on is that you don't\nneed to be good enough to be in a\nrelationship\ni think i logically understood that\nalready\nbut yep means you saying it does\nhave an impact so catch yourself because\nyou're not gonna that's not what you're\ngonna say to yourself\nthe next time the opportunity for a\nrelationship presents itself\nyou're going to say to yourself that i\nneed to be better i need to do this i'm\nnot ready yet it's not ready it's not\nthe time there are too many variables\nnotice all those different things\nand then maybe act another way but you\ndon't have to\njust notice it\nand then you can also say to yourself\ni'm not ready yet\nwhich is totally fine\nthank you you're welcome can i give you\nthis one\nyeah go ahead yeah one final bit of\nhomework because i\ni know you've got to homework okay\ni'm gonna give you a meditation exercise\nworried about okay yeah what do you got\ni'm not gonna let you slip away i see\nyou slipping away okay okay okay\nso i i think we already talked about it\nyou guys can do this at home\nlook in the mirror and notice what you\nsee\nnotice what comes up when you look in\nthe mirror and just walk just look\ndon't judge don't change just\nnotice what your mind and what your\nheart\nproduces when you look in the mirror\nokay okay\nyour turn last words yours scaropog\ni said my last words before so i just\nthink you might\nsay them again thank you i\nfind that it's really nice\nto talk to people\nand in covid it's been difficult to talk\nto new people\nso this has been a very enjoyable\ni don't know how this is very sounding\nvery like\nprofessional it's been really nice\ni think\ni don't know how to phrase it any better\nthan i have before\nthat's fine but i yeah i think that when\nsomeone helps you\nunderstand themselves better\nin a way that isn't out of a destructive\nact\num it's hard to give\nespecially in such a constructive way\nit's hard to give better praise\nyeah i i i think it's coming i think\nwhat you mean to convey\ni am feeling and and maybe the remainder\nof it can be conveyed through a hug if\nwe ever meet in real life\nyeah maybe you know maybe at the 2020\n22 twitch con whenever it comes back\nrain check range okay\ntake care and good luck on your show or\nwhatever\nall right thank you thanks for coming on\nscarra no thanks for having me on\nokay chat score is great\ni'd heard such good things and he\ndoesn't disappoint\nman such a good dude"
