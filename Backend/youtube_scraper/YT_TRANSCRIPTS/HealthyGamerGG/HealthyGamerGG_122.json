    "transcript": "close your\neyes take a few moments to breathe in\nand breathe out\n[Music]\n[Music]\nh\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\nbut I would say on a on a deeper level\nit's more like when when we say work on\nyourself that involves all kinds of like\nthings about moving your life forward\nand they struggle with motivation in\nthese\nthings it's because when I don't think\nI'm worth\nit I'm not worth fixing\n[Music]\n[Music]\nyou\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\nwhen you develop empathy and compassion\nfor other\npeople there's going to be room for\nsomeone else in the\nrelationship and then this inter turn is\ngoing to reduce the feeling of being an\nobject now two people can\nconnect and now it's not about getting\nyour needs met in Starvation\nit's about two human beings forming a\n[Music]\nrelationship alrighty chat let's get\nstarted okay\nso we were streaming uh with pirate\nsoftware Thor sorry I just got out of\nthe shower um and the universe decided\nthat this is not to happen I lost power\na couple of times and we'll talk about\nthis more with Thor um and it's really\ninteresting because anyway we'll we'll\nget to we'll get to what happened later\nin the day but we're going to pick up\nwhere we left off basically from\nMonday's conversation and uh yeah so\nbefore we like hop right in I just want\nto remind yall that we have a and we'll\nwe'll kind of just recap with him okay\nso it's kind of weird but we'll recap\nwith him and sort of see like what he\nwants to finish talking about because\nyou know I I Just Whipped out the iPad\nand and that kind of fell apart um\nbefore we get into that though just a\nquick reminder that we do have our\nmental health uh awareness month\nchallenge that is running right now so\nthis is make it may um so every week\nwe're going to give you all tasks to\nperform and these tasks are solely for\nour benefit here at healthy gamer no\nkidding they're actually um primarily\nfor your benefit so this is what this is\nthe this is what we get and this is what\nall get so when you complete the tasks\nso these are things like week one we'll\nhave stuff like you know um I forget\nlike uh it's it's about week one was\nabout setting goals and executing on\nthem week two was about building\nrelationships week three I think is\nabout self-expression and week four is\nabout making the world a better\nplace so um as y'all as community\nmembers do the stuff we will get we will\naccumulate points as a community and\nthen there are certain like stretch\ngoals\nso at 1 million points which I really\nhope we get because I really want to do\nthis I will review pickup\nartists um so we're going to do a pickup\nartist we'll talk I guess we'll talk\nabout relationships and stuff like that\noh my God the hair is so wet um but in\norder to do that you guys need to\nimprove your lives so if you guys want\nto see Dr K do that you have to like I\ndon't know accomplish your goals and\nform meaningful relationships and create\nself-expression which we're going to be\ntalking about a little bit today so\ndefinitely check it out but without\nfurther Ado\num we'll hop in so um and just a\nreminder that although I am a\npsychiatrist nothing on stream today is\nintended to be taken as medical advice\neverything is for educational or\nentertainment purposes only and if\nyouall have a medical concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional welcome to another healthy\ngamer G stream so I'm going to call\nThor\num and yeah we will just say that again\njust okay so let me see and let's\ncall oh my God those are such gigantic\nmushrooms holy\nJesus all right so we're going to do\nthis we're going to do this we're GNA\nsee find Thor Thor Lord all right I'm\ngonna raid you okay go for\nit all right guys we are ending the\nstream I'm going okay I'm h you still\nseem a little loud you're so loud and\nmanly\nThor\nokay I've I've completely lost all of my\nsanity on this stream you have no idea\nit's been amazing what do you\nmean it's a incredibly deep puzzle game\nand every single time there was a\nsolution to a puzzle it was insane and\nchat was like there's no way it could be\nthat and then it was that we learned how\nto read binary off of the ears of\nrabbits like\nthe puzzles are incredibly\ndeep um let me all right there we\ngo there we go there we go can we get\ncamera yeah I'm trying to switch it all\nover let me turn off and then turn on my\nOBS because it fully exploded earlier\none of the things that I had to\ndo was I had\nto yeah launch anyway um one of the\nthings that I actually had to do was\nchanged my system time and it\ninvalidated all of my logins and blew up\nOBS it was\ngreat why did you have to change your\nsystem time to get a groundhog to come\nout of the ground in this\ngame oh interesting to change it I\nchange it to ground oh so it's it's like\none of those not prawn puzzle\ngames uh pretty much it's called animal\nwell it was actually just published by\nlike put this up virtual camera should\nbe up now is that\nworking if that is now\nI don't see you yet one moment turn on\ncamera there we go hey there you are\nyeah so it was actually published by big\nmode uh it's made by a solo developer\nand wickedly interesting it's called\nanimal well and people told me like oh\nit's it's kind of a neat puzzle game and\nI was like all right I'll get into it\nbecause I like puzzle games and this is\nso ridiculously deep it's so absurd\nfrankly yeah I I was amazed so I I\nplayed not prawn back in the day and\nlike I I couldn't get past like level 14\nor something something and people were\nlike finding level 260\nwhatever yeah I mean there was\nlike stuff yeah I love it man there\nthere was something where you had to\nlike visit some URL and like the URL is\nlike code and you have to like download\nthe file like it doesn't it's not clear\nthat it is a file and then it turns out\nit's an MP3 but the MP3 had to be played\nbackwards and then sped up to like get\nwhatever the next like what the password\nis or something insane and it was\nyeah it was crazy like I I don't know\nhow people figure that stuff out so I\nactually build stuff like that I have\nsince I started going to Devcon way back\nat dc22 which I think was like was like\n10 years ago at this point but um yeah\nknow I build those types of puzzles for\nthe community so like finding games like\nthis that have them where I get to be a\nplayer in it for once where I get to be\nthe solver is just so it's great how do\nyou how do you decide what is too\nhard because it it so yeah it feels to\nme like you can you can you know just\nincrease the like you can keep on adding\non layers of difficulty that no one will\nbe able to solve is my thought like\nthat's how I think but maybe that's done\nin Krueger the the best way that I see\nit is if you think it's too hard it's\nnot because there's going to be a lot of\npeople working together to solve it\nright even the creator of animal well um\nlikely didn't think people were going to\nrip through the game this fast right but\nyou've given a puzzle challenge to\npeople and that will naturally attract\npeople that are better at doing super\ndeep puzzle challenges people like me\nthat's what I like to do and as they get\nbetter and better at these they find\nmore and more games like this and they\njust keep getting better so they solve\nthese things fast then you get a\ncommunity of them together and they just\nrip it apart they will destroy it so\nquickly like I'm building one right now\ninside of a game called hackmud um with\na friend of mine named Eva and we're\ntrying to make it very hard but I know\nthey're going to beat it in like a day\nno matter what I throw at them they're\njust going to rip it rip it to shreds\nright so you always want to make it\nharder but there's a kind of difficult\nthat's important it needs to have\nlogical tiin so you can't have the\nplayer doing what's called a flying leap\nwhere it's like oh they just have to\nguess the answer like no they need to it\nneeds to logically make sense you need\nto be able to lead to that answer you\nmay think of something really esoteric\nsomething really weird something like\nkind of hidden knowledge but it needs to\nlogically make sense a lot of what I\nlike to do is is make a puzzle that once\nthey solve it they look back in they go\noh that makes so much sense now I don't\nknow I don't know how I didn't see that\nin the first place right that's that's\nthe kind of interaction you want to have\nnot the that's what the hell was that\nlike why why is it that thing that's so\ninteresting cuz that that reminds me of\nlike\npsychotherapy what really how yeah\nbecause because like so so what you want\nto help people do and and not just\nPsychotherapy I I think like just\ndisciplines of growth like personal\ngrowth so like I I did this back with my\nGuru back when I was 21 too where like\nyou know there's logical tie-ins to your\nbehavior so like it doesn't make sense\nto you you until you sort of figure it\nout and then once you figure it out it\nmakes perfect\nsense yeah and so that's so interesting\nand I I think a lot of the process of\npsychotherapy is like the formalized\nprocess of creating those logical leaps\nfor\nsomeone so that they can go from point A\nto point Z and even though Point z may\nfeel so far away and so esoteric like we\nkind of help people get there\nhopefully yeah I mean that's kind of\nlike I've never actually thought about\nthat sort of a tie-in right yeah it also\nkind of teaches people to rely more on\nthemselves and their own ability to work\nand adapt through challenges which I\nthink is really important that's\nsomething that it taught me going\nthrough that stuff especially you know\ngoing through Defcon that way I think it\nwas it was awesome frankly because it\ntaught me like oh hey I can work through\nany challenge even ones that no one else\nknows what the hell is going on but like\nif I can see the solution to it then I\ncan keep going and that's it's funny cuz\nwe were playing it all day today we were\nplaying animal well all day today and\nit's just\nthose puzzles are crazy deep like C\nthere was moments where Chad's like what\nare you doing and I was like it's\nthere's so much happening right it's\njust this giant wall of math and\n[ __ ] all over the screen you know\nyeah sounds super cool I was never I was\nnever great at those but maybe I just\ndidn't try enough who knows they're hard\nthey're not easy and you have to I think\nyou have to like really want that sort\nof a thing not everybody wants that kind\nof challenge that's fine I don't think\nthere's anything wrong with that I think\nit's it's a very specific kind of\nchallenge for a person specifically\nlikes that kind of challenge right you\nknow yeah I I'm I'm more of a degenerate\nmobile player or single player strategy\ngames I feel B maybe the occasional\nRTS but I I just don't have the the\nreflexes or training anymore yeah no I\nmean that's it kind of Falls away right\nI know that I'm not as good at games as\nI was 10 years ago but I'm definitely\nstill I'm better at puzzles now so I can\njust keep hammering\nthose so Thor I know we um got our our\nlast conversation got truncated by the\nthe universe and and we tried twice and\nthe really funny thing is that so that\nevening there's a book that I have um\nwhich is a commentary on this text\ncalled the Shiva\nSutra okay and I I got this book back in\n2003 and it's been sitting on my shelf\nfor\nabout um yeah so 20 years like 21 years\nand so about 3 months ago I pulled it\noff the shelf because I was Was\npreparing a lecture on something and I\nwas like oh maybe I'll like take a crack\nat this but I had six books that I was\ngoing to go through and I the first\nthree or four books were sufficient to\nprepare the lecture so it was sitting on\nthe shelf and then so you know our\nstream ended and that evening I was like\nokay so like let me just read this book\nbecause I've never actually like read it\nor I tried to read it and I it was too\ndense for me and it's really interesting\nbecause it actually talks a lot about\nwhat we were talking about um and so I\nthought it was like quite coincidental\nand then the part of my brain that looks\nat a cloud and sees a dog that that\ngenerates patterns out of Randomness\nmade me really wonder in like kind of\nlike a spooky way I was like oh maybe\nlike maybe I was supposed to read this\nthing before I talked to you and\nso um maybe we can kind of I'll ask you\nkind of where we we left off and and\nwhat you remember but I hope that your\npower doesn't explode this time I don't\nthink it will so I think now that I have\nprepared by reading the Shiva Sutra and\nI've I've also like looked at a couple\nof I've got a couple research articles P\npulled up MH um uh so hopefully the we\ncan kind of pick up where we left off\nbut also like if that doesn't you know\nif we kind of lost the threat of it so\nbe it um but can you just remind us and\nand help me remember kind of where we\nwere in the conversation and and what we\nwere about to embark on um we were\ntalking about something I'm trying to\nremember the very specific thing because\nit's it's tough for me when like a\nthread gets severed like that to return\nto\nthat we were talking very about a very\nspecific\nthing okay\noh I can't remember here's what I\nremember sure so we were talking about\nthe the way that I recall the\nconversation is we talked a lot about\ndifferent things that you were doing yes\nso you're working on the feret rescue um\nthere was some gaming thing I forget\nwhat it was uh game Jam g game jam and\nthen um you're you have a long-term goal\nof building a publishing house and a\nclinic and a clinic clinic for what uh\nexotic animals I'm going to build a\nVeterinary Clinic yeah so th those are\nthe things that you're working on and we\nwe had talked a lot about your kind of\nJourney and being homeless for a year uh\nand I think in the past we had talked\nsome about um you were in a relationship\nthat that kind of uh you know yall ended\nup splitting up um and you kind of grew\na lot through this process we talked a\nlot about your relationship with your\nemotions how you utilize logic\num but then I had kind of tossed out\nthis sense that I had that you are not\noperating\nfrom a place of logic or emotion yes\nthat was the third the secret third\nthing the third thing not this not this\nyes and so as we try to understand what\nthat is like we we started to explore\nthat and I offered some some answers\nfrom a tradition so that doesn't make it\nright so this isn't science right this\nis just like some people sat down and\nlooked at this thing and examined it for\na while and then they came up with\nconclusions they didn't all come up with\nthe same conclusions but many of them\ncame up with the same\nconclusions and so uh I think I just\npulled out my iPad and was sort of\nstarting to explain like what that thing\nis yeah um or at least one theory of\nwhat that thing is and then it detonated\nI think that's exactly what it was that\nwas the specific thing you're it's funny\nI couldn't remember it because it was\nthe it's nothing anyway yeah right so so\nit's it's nothing so um and then the\nother thing that I know we dm'd a little\nbit back and forth about uh you know\nrescheduling and stuff and then the\nother thing that you mentioned is that a\nlarge part of your community um is\nactually progressing very nicely from\nlike a professional standpoint right\nlike yeah I've got a ton of people that\nare messaging me tons and tons of people\naround the world that are like I I put\nthe things that you said to to action\nand I got an amazing job you know and it\nit just keeps happening over and over\nthere's like hundreds of people that are\nmessaging me reaching out on twittering\nout on DMS on Discord which I can't\nanswer all of them there's just so so\nmany uh people sending emails and people\nsaying it in chat all the time it's\nactually really awesome frankly seeing\nthat like those types of actions going\nto work and it's it's a lot of really\neasy stuff most of the time but it's\nthings that people don't know when\nthey're first entering the workforce you\nknow like making a a resume and a cover\nletter they're one page long you know\nthe way that you handle yourself inside\nof an interview little tiny things like\nthat that people just don't realize is\nlike super important and um they just\nkind of end up sending out like hundreds\nand hundreds and hundreds of\napplications and then they change the\nstuff and they're like I got a job two\ntwo applications later yeah way faster\nso that's that's awesome and I I think\nyou had mentioned to me uh in DMS that\nlike drive and burnout are major aspects\nthat y'all are kind of um dealing with\ncan you can you say a little bit more\nabout that like what are you what what\nare you seeing one some of the the\nlargest Trends in people asking me\nquestions usually around drivve and\nburnout they're like I don't have drive\nyou know I don't have the drive to go\nand do something or I have pushed myself\ntoo hard I'm burning out or I I love\ndoing this thing so much that I don't\nwant to do it anymore you know they\ndon't realize that they're hitting that\nburnout threshold where they're pushing\nthemselves in a weird way or like the\nenvironment is bad for doing that work\nso then they don't want to do it or\nthey're doing it too many hours a day so\nor they're trying to a really common one\nis I want to quit my day job to go do my\nhobby full- time and a lot of times\npeople don't realize when you do that\nhobby fulltime you now have added a ton\nof pressure to yourself of like I need\nto be financially viable doing this\nthing now and now you hate it right so\nlike there's all kinds of stuff like\nthat where it's it's little things like\nthat all the time and those are\ngenerally the things that I give advice\non and like how to fix this you know\nbecause it's super common crazy common\nyeah so so here's what I was what I'd\nkind of imagined for today and like this\nis like you know welcome to modify\ndisagree completely you know go off the\nrails um so what I was sort of thinking\nis that so I think think these two\nthings are related so the first is when\nwe think a little bit about\num drive and\nburnout these both of these things are\nsignals from within\nus and if we understand an alarm huh a\nlot of times it's an alarm it's like hey\nyou're doing something that you\nshouldn't be this feels bad and people\ndon't realize that's an alarm Bell going\noff yeah yeah absolutely right so so\nso what I was kind of referring to is\nthat not even the quality of the signal\nthat it's an alarm but that this is\nsomething that comes from within so\ndrive and burn out are not necessarily\ncreated by the outside world they are\ncreated by something within\nus and so I think that the really\ninteresting thing is that I'd love to\nhear what your advice is um for for\nthose kinds of cases and then I think\nthe other thing that we can do is try to\nbetter understand your experience of\nwhat drives you what protects you from\nburnout and what I've kind of done is\nprepare a little bit about like my\nunderstanding of kind of this like\nEastern concept of the self which I\nthink is quite robust quite correct like\neven scientifically and then um I think\nthere's also a lot of like cool stuff in\nunderstanding drive and burnout from the\nNeuroscience research and specifically\nI'm not Fami I'm not sure if you're\nfamiliar with the concept of hedonics\nversus udim monics I am not okay so\nwe'll talk a little bit about that I'll\nkind of give you kind of a quick tldr so\nif you look at human\nhappiness what we call happiness so\nhappiness is actually a lot of discreet\nthings so one kind of happiness and this\nis something that Aristotle actually I\nthink originally coined so he sort of\nnoticed that there's two kinds of like\nhappiness there's like fun and pleasure\nand then there's a sense of like\nwell-being and\nsatisfaction and what we tend to find is\nthat if you look at the Neuroscience of\nit this is an oversimplification but I\ntend to find that in a lot of my\npatients there's an inverse relationship\nbetween the neurotransmitters dopamine\nand serotonin so what we think of as\ndopamine is like the pleasure\nneurotransmitter so this is comes from\nthis part of our brain called the\nnucleus accumbens so when we use opiates\nor we play a video game we get a rush of\npleasure now what we sort of know this\nis to be disputed um and and probably\nactually what I'm about to say I'm\nleaning towards this actually being\nincorrect but it's a useful model\nis that when we look at people who are\ndepressed there's this gets tied in some\nway to their serotonin levels or the\nlevels of Serotonin transmission so\nthere's kind of this the prevailing\nTheory which is now being countered by\nuh some people like anyway we can go\ninto that that detail but that basically\nlike your sense of well-being is\ngoverned by like your serotonin so we\nknow that that's why we use ssris yes\nthat's one of the reasons we use SSR yes\num and and so what we sort of find like\nif I if you take someone who has an\naddiction for example like they actually\nget a fair amount of dopam energic\ntransmission right so I'm playing video\ngames all day I'm using marijuana on a\ndaily basis but my sense of well-being\nand happiness in life actually\ndeclines and what we often times find is\nthat people who are working hard and\neven denying themselves pleasure right\nso like when I'm driven towards I don't\nknow\nlike running a game Jam or something\nlike that that is not like a pleasurable\nAC it's not fun I mean there may be\nparts of it that are fun but there's a\nlarge like effort investment but it\nincreases your sense of well-being so\nthere's this inverse relationship\nbetween dopamine and serotonin that once\nagain is really a neuroscientific\noversimplification that we can pick\napart very easily but I think it's\nuseful to think about we also know that\njust from observational studies and\nclinical experience and stuff like that\nthat these two principles can sometimes\nbe or that we have good data about that\nif I chase a life of I will probably be\nunhappy and that finding a life of\nHappiness sometimes involves avoiding\npleasure so that there's good data about\nbut we don't quite know that the\nNeuroscience lines up anyway so I I\nthink this is also really important\nbecause when we talk about drive and\nburnout I think that a huge part\nof what I found as a clinician we also\nhave like a Creator coaching program in\na a career coaching program where we\nsort of use some of these principles of\nlike self-fulfillment people have better\noutcomes and they have they reduce their\nunhealthy behaviors which are usually\ndope and energic in nature and often\ntimes what we will discover is that\ndrive and\nburnout come from listening to a\nparticular part of\nyourself that doesn't consider these\nkinds of things so like I want to become\nsomething I feel like I fallen behind in\nlife I need to prove something and as a\nresult like I'm going to push myself\npush myself push myself and I'll end up\nburning out even though I'm like moving\ntowards my goals so I don't know exactly\nhow we're going to do this I don't know\nif it's going to happen but like what I\nwas sort of thinking about is we could\nunderstand your experience of this third\nthing and teach people potentially how\nto operate from that space more because\nI get the sense that you work very hard\nyou are driven and you don't burn out\nand then we can also lean into your\npersonal advice and your personal\nexperience of like how you've created\nthat and I am very confident that\nwhatever answers you have I will be able\nto provide a framework or research\nsupport for whatever you already do\nmakes sense yeah makes complete sense I\nthink I think the biggest thing for me\nis yeah you're right I don't burn out\nlike uh people laugh about it all the\ntime they're like oh he's G to burn out\nhe's gonna do this because I I work 16\nto 19 hours a day I sleep five hours a\nday I work all day do all that kind of\nstuff but the thing that I found that\nstarted that train to make that possible\npossible I can see the impact of my work\none of the things that I find a lot of\nthe times is when someone's in a\nworkplace and they feel really bad about\ngoing to work sometimes it's the working\nenvironment sometimes it's the people\nthey work with but very often I found\nthey don't see why their job matters\nthey don't see what their job does and\nyou'll see this quite a lot for a lot of\nweird kind of areas or maybe they look\ndown on the impact of the work let's say\nyou work at fast food and you think your\nfast food job is worthless because you\nwork at fast food right you work in\nMcDonald's or something like that some\npeople can see like hey working at\nMcDonald's is actually a really positive\nthing because I'm feeding people and\nthat gets them through the day and then\nthey feel better about the job some\npeople just go I just work at fast food\nthis a dead end job they feel like\ngarbage about it right so like I think\nimpact is a really big starting point if\nthat makes sense and that's usually the\nfirst thing I look for is like do you\nsee the impact of your work okay most of\nthe time those the people who have burnt\nout completely are like no I don't see\nthe impact of my work at all I'm like\nokay now we can work on that piece what\nI'm going to do Thor is I'm going to\ntake notes okay and we're going to start\nso I'm going to just so so burnout\ncorrelates with lack of impact that's\none yeah I think that's an aspect of it\nand then in in in your case the way that\nThor avoids\nburnout is by seeing the impact yes okay\ngreat seeing impact is huge that's\nactually one of the reasons I look into\nanalytics for stuff it's it is something\nthat gets beyond the idea aidea of\nhaving imposter syndrome right the the\nlittle voice in the back of your head\nthat tells you hey you know you\nshouldn't be doing that or you're not\ngood enough or any of I see that kind of\nas a defense mechanism that's over\noverachieving right it's sitting there\ntelling you like you shouldn't do this\nbecause if you do it you'll fail and if\nyou fail then we'll feel bad so don't do\nthat right but in reality you should do\nthat thing you should try that thing and\nsee if it works so I I'll usually tell\npeople like hey if you're getting that\noverwhelming you and it's stopping you\nfrom doing things in the first place it\ngives you that to start make a bet with\nit say I'm going to do this for 3 months\nI'm going to wait and see and then we're\ngoing to go back and review everything\nand see if I did better than when I\nfirst started and if I did then the\nImposter syndrome's wrong because I look\nat my analytics all the time because I\nsee every all the feedback that people\nare giving all the things that people\nsay how they see that you know how they\nsay the advice is actually helping them\nthrough things I don't have to deal with\nthat because I can see the impact and\nthat's immediate evidence to say like\nimposter syndrome sit in the corner\nright because I have evidence that it's\nnot correct so that goes away that's the\nsecond layer of that you've got the\nimpact for your work and then you've\nalso got imposter syndrome being you\nknow pushed to the side for that okay um\ntrying to think of some other\nthings uh another one is environment for\nme I create zones so I have a zone for\nactually doing work I have a zone for\nwhen I want to rest I have a zone for\nwhen I want to do entertainment I these\nare physical areas of my space right um\nand I've talked to people in the past\nthey like well I don't have any areas I\nwas like do you got a couch they're like\nyeah I was like do you got a laptop\nthey're like yeah do stuff on a laptop\nit's like okay when you're playing gam\nsit on the left side of the couch when\nyou're working on something sit on the\nright side of the couch the reason that\nI learned that is because I was trying\nto do everything from a laptop in bed\nand what I found was when I was working\non things I wanted to go to sleep and\nwhen I wanted to go to sleep I couldn't\nstop thinking about work and it it\ncreated this like weird mixed thing for\nme I don't know if that's the same for\neveryone but for me environmental mixing\nwas a problem and I had to separate\nenvironmental areas to make that I was\nfocused on the task for that area if\nthat makes sense so Thor when you see\nanalytics that are not going well what\nhappens within\nyou I want to know why I'm not upset I\njust want to know why like and I I try\nto form a number of different\npossibilities for that things that could\nbe the solution to that and then I try\nto isolate those in a way where it is\npossible for me to test it so okay I'm\ngoing to jump in for a second sure so um\nwhy don't you feel\nbad because it's a chance to learn\nsomething and then and then I can use\nthat for every other situation if I if I\ncan solve why that thing went wrong and\nthen use it to my advantage use you know\nthe information from that to my\nadvantage I can win not only that\nsituation but many others that come\nBeyond it\nokay all right cool is it okay if I\ninterrupt you yeah go for it okay so\nwe're going to map this out and we're\ngoing to we're going to try to like\nwe're going to do everything that you're\nalready doing we're just going to\nprovide some support for it okay so um\nyou mentioned environment\nokay uh what drives\nyou a lot of different things it really\ndepends on the situation though I think\ndifferent situations have different\ndriving factors if that makes sense yeah\nso it's not always the same I think\nthere is probably the greatest drive\nfrom as we were talking about puzzle\ngames earlier the drive to solve is a\npretty big one for me I love to solve\nthings and the reason why is because\nit's like oh I don't know that thing let\nme see if I can learn something from\nthis because I found that there's so\nmuch kind of like cross-pollination\nbetween things that you learn and you\ncan apply those skills anywhere else in\nyour life and it it makes me more\nadaptive I\nfind\nokay uh all right so now we get a little\nbit um potentially into the weirder area\nso we had talked\nabout uh so here's\nThor and Thor has logic Thor has\nemotion Thor has maybe something called\npersonality maybe right so no one's\nproven that yet puzzle\nsolver right so empty husk with a nice\nhead of hair\nyeah there we go and then there's this\nthis like third\nthing the secret third thing the secret\nthird thing right and and I get the\nsense that a lot of your drives so\nhere's what I think the order of\noperation is here's you the third\nthing\nstarts and then what happens is it sends\nsignals to your logical mind and it\nsends signals to your emotional mind and\nthen what these things do is they\nstructure your activity so these will\ngive this thing which is formless they\nwill give it some kind of\nshape and then this shape is very\ndependent on you like like someone El\nlike someone else may have this drive\nbut based on your desire to solve\npuzzles based on The Logical conclusions\nbased on certain values that you hold it\ngives this thing a particular\nmanifestation that suits you and since\nthis thing is suiting you\nthis leads to\nsuccess and the more things that I learn\nthe more ways I can make that happen in\ndifferent scenarios sure so so then what\nhappens is that there\nthey yeah so so the the more that these\nthings get enhanced I'm going to call\nlearning I'm going to say that learning\nis over here right so so then what\nhappens is if you get this kind of\nimpulse and your logic is insufficient\nthen you can't give this thing shape but\nas your logic improves as your emotions\nimprove this thing starts to take shape\nas we're leveling this up leveling this\nup getting rid of this I think the big\nthing for me though is when I see that\nwhen I find one of those scenarios where\nit's like I don't know enough to do this\nI want to it's like oh this is great\nthat's another thing to add to the\nBatman belill right that's kind of the\nthe way that it feels to me each time I\nI am presented with one of those and\nit's funny all of you guys in chat you\nsaw me do this all day you've seen me do\nthis for the last like three days in\nanimal well every time it's like oh I\ndon't know what this is I'm going to do\nthis it's not even haes not knowing\nthings it's that I know that at the\nother side of that when I finish knowing\nthe thing I'm going to have new ideas\nthat I can apply to other situations so\nlike solving all those puzzles in animal\nwell I'm going to go make some really\ncool ARG stuff I can make that for\nheartbound I can make that for the\nhackmud stuff that I'm doing anything\nelse I can apply that all over the place\nand I can solve other puzzles in the\nfuture yeah so Thor was there a time\nwhere you weren't like\nthat I don't think there was a time\nwhere I wasn't like that I think there\nwas a time when I wasn't that good at it\nit's like a it's like a snowball it's\nlike an avalanche right okay so like\nthere was a time where it was like God I\ndon't know anything I'm just pissed all\nthe time and it was like once I started\nto get a couple of of footholds in that\nwas like wait I know how to do that this\nway I can apply it this way we can try\nthis this way then it was like well I\nknow how to solve a lot of things but I\ndon't know how to talk to people and I'm\nnot good at that you know how what do\nyou do when you feel a negative emotion\nso you said you used to be pissed what\nhappens to that\nemotion I think when I was younger it\nwas a lot harder to manage because\nemotions kind of came out of nowhere and\nit was like really really kind of rough\nyou know because I think growing up and\nI'm sure a lot of people can kind\nunderstand this growing up there was\nlike don't be over emotional you know be\nyou're a guy you know suppress that sort\nof a thing so for me when I was younger\nit was a lot of that it was a lot of\nlike be a manly man don't don't do that\ndon't show that off and then as I got\nolder I was like no it just makes sense\nto do that it's fine and I kind of\nevolved out of that if that makes sense\nso I think that made it more difficult\nto handle that side of things in the\nearly days but over time I realized that\nwas okay and made how did you evolve out\nof it do you\nknow it's it's funny because it keeps\ngoing back to that that sort of\ninflection point of homeless for a year\nright I think it was it was like the\nmost devastating thing that could happen\nand it was a hard reset for me frankly\nokay if that makes sense yeah yeah so uh\nwho did you think you were before you\nwere\nhomeless I had a\nvery kind of Grand Vision of myself\nway grandiose way way Larger than Life\nfrankly in an absurdest sort of way I\nthought it was top of the world I\nthought I was I was kickass all the time\nand um it humbled the [ __ ] out of me\nfrankly it's the best way to put that\nokay yeah okay great so do you have any\nquestions for me so far no I think this\nis cool so far okay so now it's\ninteresting to see like my whole mental\nprocess so I I I think what we're going\nto do is like we're going to what we're\ngoing to do is use you as a test case to\ngeneralize certain principles of the\nmental process and we're going to see if\nwe can figure out the code that results\nin some kind of like outcome right so\nlike if I'm if I'm like typing hello\nworld or whatever there's something I\ncan type and we can get a particular\noutcome so tell me I do yeah oh go ahead\nI I was going to say I do think it was\nnot just that moment though it's every\ntime I failed\nas well every time I ever experienced\nfailure in the ideas that I had it\nshowed me there's something more to\nlearn and then eventually it's like you\ndon't know anything you just know the\nthings that you already know and you can\nuse those to adapt yourself to different\nsituations and become better at\nDiscerning things and better at at\nevolving through that okay my whole\nthing was like train yourself to adapt\nno matter what okay and failure is great\nbecause it gives you another chance to\nlearn a new adaptation okay okay so I'm\ngoing to point something out to\nyou um when some people fail they say I\nam bad Abol you fail what do you say I\nsay oo piece of candy you know it's like\nit's an opportunity for me opportunity\nfor what to learn it's an O opportunity\nto get better okay so we're going to I'm\ngoing to just keep track of this okay\nwe'll see if we can sus out what the big\ndifference is\num\nso actually maybe we can do it now what\ndo you think is the object of this\nthought object meaning can you\ndefine yeah so where is my in what D\nit's going to be hard to but I'll I'll\nkeep trying and then you can puzzle\nsolve your way to the answer um what am\nwhat is my mind looking\nat when I have this thought\nshortterm I I generally think that that\nis a a very short-term sort of feeling\nit is I failed here which means I am a\nfailure rather than I failed here but\nlook at all the things that I've\novercome in my life I don't remember all\nthe really difficult things that I've\ngotten through to get to this point I\nsurvive to here so it's it's a shortterm\nlike this happened so I suck it's like\nno all the other stuff that you learn\nyou you you rock actually the fact that\nyou are here that you've made it this\nfar means you've succeeded okay so I'm\nI'm going to translate that into certain\nterminology so I'm going to say that you\nwhen you say like okay people only see\nthis this one thing right so they don't\nthey kind of don't take the big picture\nlike they don't think about all the\nthings that they've done I'm going to\ncall that zoomed in yeah okay so this\nthought is zoomed in this thought is\nshortterm yep um I'm going to go ahead\nand say that the object of this thought\nis your identity so I am thinking about\nme\nthat makes sense okay yeah yeah you're\nthinking about yourself rather than the\nsituation I can see that so when when\nyou have this thought what is the object\nwhat am I looking\nat the problem itself for me okay so the\nproblem and the future rather than the\npresent it is I'm focusing on the goal\nwhich is when the problem is already\nsolved okay it is a more of a long-term\nthing as well because it's like ah this\nis an opport for growth it may be\ndifficult to get through this but at the\nend of this I'm going to be way I'm\ngoing to be way more suited to solving\nstuff like this you know whatever it's\ngoing to be and I I think I learned a\nlot of that from being a programmer as\nfunny as that is because programming is\n99% fixing your own bugs frankly like\nyou are constantly making assumptions\ntrying something seeing that it fails\ntrying to find out why it failed getting\nbetter at that thing and then you can\nsee the progress as your code stops\nfailing as much or it starts to fail in\nnew and more fantastic ways\nfrankly yeah no I I I think it's so\ninteresting because once again I'm like\nreminded of this analogy when you kind\nof say like you know 99% of it is\nsolving your own bugs like I think\nthat's what growth is too so personal\ngrowth whether it's through um you know\nkind of the yogic path or the\nPsychotherapy path I think that there's\nlike there's overlap there um yeah and\nand a lot of it is basically I I think a\nlot of people really don't realize that\nthat actually they control so much and\ndo and and even if we look at the way\nthat you respond to failure right so\nlike what I've sort of noticed is that\nthere's so there are two types of people\nin the world those who what doesn't kill\nyou makes you stronger and those who\nwhat doesn't kill you cripples you for\nlife so this is the sad truth is that a\nlot of people say oh what doesn't kill\nyou only makes you stronger that's not\ntrue what doesn't you can just [ __ ]\nyou for life as well that's one of the\nreasons why I try to give people that\nfeedback of like you need to find the\nimpact in your work because I found for\nme that was my first\nfoothold that was the first like wait\nI'm not terrible I'm not [ __ ] I have\nevidence now it's like a finding a sword\nright because you can finally fight back\nat that point you're like I have I have\nevidence that I'm doing something that\nmatters and that's a when you have\nnothing that's a really empowering thing\nyeah yeah so I think that there there\nare things that make it difficult for\npeople to do that oh definitely I I do\nthink it's incredibly hard especially\nwhen you don't have anything to start\noff with yeah well I think a lot of\npeople have something I think they have\ndifficulty seeing that they have\nsomething I agree with that yeah do you\nthink makes it hard for them to see that\nthey have\nsomething I think a lot of times it's\neasy to kind of fall into that path of\nof seeing all the negative patterns\nseeing that path of I fail here I failed\nthere I failed this I failed that and\nnot being able to see the positive\nthings I'm interested in what leads\nsomeone\ndown that sort of path because I\ndon't it's it's quite interesting\nbecause it's exactly the same path but\nin Reverse what it's the same so I can\nfocus on all of the successes that I\nhave all the things that I can do all\nthe things that I've learned from those\nfailures or I can focus on all the times\nthat I failed and keep that as the focal\npoint the interesting part to me is what\nleads someone down one of those paths\nver the other one let's talk about what\ndoes that yeah\nso um what what do you understand about\nthis third thing the NY NY thing like C\ncan you toss out anything so like I I\nuse the word calling and I think that\nwas the term that kind of resonated with\nyou it is yeah 100% like how do you\nunderstand like what is that where does\nthat come from just give me anything\nthat you've got about it and if you've\ngot nothing that's totally fine too I\ndon't even think it's nothing it's\nthere's a moment that I have\nwhere it's it's funny some people talk\nabout it like Intuition or or you know\ngut instinct or anything like that\nwhatever it's going to be but it really\ncomes down to I'm in a scenario and I go\nthis is the right way to handle this and\nthen I go how do I logically handle this\nhow do I emotionally handle this can I\ndo that is it within my ability to do so\nhow is it going to affect everyone\naround me does everyone win when we do\nthis and it starts cascading down all\nthe possibilities of the different\nroutes of ways that this could be\nhandled pieces that I could touch how\nthe puzzle gets solved where does all\nthe puzzle where do all the puzzle\npieces lay and does it hurt anyone along\nthe way okay that's the biggest one so\nhere's what I want to point out to you\nbut that first piece is just yeah so so\nthe right answer precedes the logic yes\nthat is correct how how does that work I\ndon't know okay yeah great I got nothing\non that one so this if if people want to\nunderstand why they are burnt out if you\ncan understand\nthis that the right answer comes\nfirst then all kinds of problems will be\nsolved so let's like talk about a couple\nof different problems that arise from\nnot knowing what the right answer is so\nthe first simplest example is like want\nversus should right so like let's say\nyou've got someone who's like okay like\nI'm unhappy in my career and or I'm\nunhappy I'm unhappy with something I\ndon't doesn't matter what relationship\ncareer job whatever and then what\nhappens is that logic and emotion enter\nthe picture there's no north star to\nbegin with and then logic and emotion\nfight okay so emotion says I want to do\nthis I don't want to work I don't want\nto do this I want to play video games\nand then logic says but I should play\nvideo games and then there's internal\nconflict and then we get to this really\ninteresting principle of ambivalence so\nhuman beings are conflicted\nin their nature or not actually in their\nnature but in the psychology of\nunderstanding human behavioral\nchange this is what we've sort of\nfigured out human beings are ambivalent\nso right now I have you know I have like\na plus minus over here and I have a\ndifferent plus minus over here so this\nmay sound kind of weird but I'll explain\nso like if I move you know so anytime I\nhave a conflict there are benefits of\ndoing what I want and there are costs of\ndoing what I want and there are benefits\nof doing what I should do and there are\ncosts of doing what I should do so we\nstart in the middle and the interesting\nthing is as you move in One Direction\nthis becomes small and the costs start\nincreasing it doesn't matter which\ndirection you move in anytime you move\ntowards an action this is what the\nscience of ambivalence tells us let's\nsay like I think about going do I want\nto play a video game or do I want to go\nto the gym and if I go to the gym like\nwhat happens is the thought of going to\nthe gym and the experience of going to\nthe gym are different when I'm thinking\nabout going to the gym or I'm thinking\nabout eating a salad once I sit down to\neat the salad I have to eat the salad so\nthe actual it's like I'd love to be\nhealthy but now I got to eat salad you\ngot to go and actually do the action\nyeah so so so this is what's really\ninteresting is that if you look at it\nlike as we move towards something the\ncosts start increasing our brain starts\nto experience there's a hypothetical\ncost of going to the gym sure but once\nI'm actually there and like I'm feeling\nintimidated by people and I'm feeling\nlike all these people are in shape and\nthey're judging me and all that kind of\nstuff the cost actually increases so\nthen what happens is as the cost\nincreases the grass is greener on the\nother side right this also explains this\nvery simple principle of why the grass\nis greener on the other side then people\nend up moving over here and as they move\nover here oh now I moved a little bit\nover here and it turns out that the\ngrass is not greener on the other side\nI'm I'm breaking up was a mistake let me\nsee if they'll take me back and then\npeople sort of end up stuck just kind of\nyeah so this is what's what's super\nsuper crazy is that operating from\nemotion and logic which is what a lot of\npeople try to do doesn't work very well\nwhat actually works incredibly well is\nfiguring out what your North Star is and\nlogic in Emotion are not\ndeterminants of your behavior they are\ntools to actualize whatever your compass\nis this is what we see in you that ends\nup being a strong sense of self\nokay but why where does let's talk about\nthat what do you mean by strong sense of\nself great because the only way you can\nfind that North Star at that point is\nthat means a strong sense of self that\nsays regardless of the logical of the\nsituation regardless of the emotion of\nthe situation this is the thing that I\nthink is is correct so from there how do\nwe logically handle this and how do we\nemotionally handle this to make sure\nthat that becomes the end goal like\nbecomes the outcome right\nand that just ends up being a really\nyeah it's a it's a strong sense of self\nwhich is funny because most people on\nthe internet just go based right but\nlike that's that's what it sounds like\nto me is what we're describing here yes\nso here's the first principle to\nunderstand and there's a big problem\nthat we see in our society right now\nlogic and emotions are tools they're\nthey're to be utilized by the self they\nshould not run your life and what we\ntend to find is people who are overly\nlogical for first of all there's all\nkinds of problems with that people think\nthey don't realize that there's problems\nbut so the first thing is like logic uh\nthe the more logical you are the more\nprone you are to things like\ndepression um and when your emotions run\nthe show I think we can all agree that\nthat's like not a good plan and the\nbasic problem with logic is that logic\nis not really logical like so in the\nhuman brain when you take this abstract\nprinciple of logic and you apply it to\nthe human brain you're going to have all\nkinds of selection biases\nright so I don't have space so when\npeople say that they do have space but\ntheir brain isn't their logic is not\nable to see that because there is\nsomething within your mind that is\nobscuring information from your logical\napparatus makes sense actually that kind\nof reminds me have you played oh God\nwhat is that game I'm gonna look this up\nwhile you're talking okay yeah I want to\nshow you this anyway keep going okay\ndisco alysium there we go thank you I\nplayed a little bit of disco alysium\nabsolutely loved it so I thought disco\nlysium actually ties into this quite\nwell because in Disco lsum you have\ntraits to your character and those\ntraits turn into intrusive thoughts but\nthe intrusive thoughts are based on\nthose statistics so if you have\nencyclopedic knowledge because your\nintelligence is very high you may be\nable to recollect things like you\nremember things when you're talking to\npeople about different stuff in the\nworld but also it may cut in and be like\nyou shouldn't listen to that person they\ndon't know anything they're an idiot and\nit's it's very interesting because\nthat's exactly what it is is you're\nseeing the logical side do something\nthat isn't logical and kind of push them\naway from that scenario it's quite odd\nyeah I I I remember just one really\ninteresting thing about the game so I\nwas playing the game and in the game\nthere's someone who talks about a preon\ndisease and familial fatal insomnia so\nthey're like they don't name the things\nbut I was reading this and I was like\nyou know this is really interesting\nbecause this sounds like familial fatal\ninsomnia which is a really re really\nlike rare case it's like a very rare\ndisease and it is it is familial fatal\ninsomnia which is exactly what it it\nsounds like it's an inherited condition\nwhere you lose the capacity to sleep and\nyou go crazy and then you die and U one\nof the nice things about training at at\nsome of these like some of these\ninstitution so I I trained at a a very\nfamous hospital and the cool thing about\ntraining at a famous hospital is like\nyou get people like there's like maybe\nfive cases of this a year across the\nglobe and so like people will fly to\nlike you know very Specialized Hospital\nto get this kind of care for these\ndiseases which is which is really bad\nreally scary thing very exceedingly rare\nso you don't need to worry about it for\neach one of them maybe you get closer to\nfixing it you know maybe yeah maybe\ncloser to a solve yeah okay so justum is\nabsolutely full of this kind of stuff\nyeah so let's let's go back to this so\nnow I'm going to ask you a question Thor\nso you said it comes from the self so\nbasically what we're going to help\npeople do is understand what you've\nmanaged to do so that you can operate\nfrom that place the other really\ninteresting thing is that I don't know\nif this kind of makes sense but when\nyou're operating from the\nself you can know that this is logically\na bad idea you can know that this is\nemotionally not a good thing and then\nyou can still do it does that I can find\na way to make it work exactly that's the\nbig one right so so so this is the cool\nthing is that normally what happens is\nwe are bound by our logic and our\nemotions our ability our capacity for\nself-determination can be restricted by\nLogic so my mind is telling me this is a\nbad idea like I do this stuff all the\ntime I and it's kind of weird but\nsomeone asked me recently like what is\nsomething that I wish I knew when I was\n30 and my answer was to walk away from\ngood things that like some of the best\nthings some of the best decisions in my\nlife are to walk away from quote unquote\nobjectively good\nopportunities and and so we have this\nidea when we're 30 that you know we have\nto like we're still following the script\nof the world and we don't realize that\nthe script of the world doesn't\nTranslate over into us and that like\nsome of the best decisions I've made are\nto like walk away from like objectively\ngreat\nopportunities interesting um and so\nlogically it doesn't sound it's stupid\nbut you do it anyway and then it turns\nout it works great because maybe then\nyou're in alignment with the universe or\nwhatever the [ __ ] anyway so I think the\ninteresting part about that is if you're\ndoing that you're choosing to have more\nhardship which means you're choosing to\nhave more scenarios in which you can\nadapt and learn to adapt better which is\ngoing to make long term it to make it\neasier frankly uh theoretically yes that\nthat is one way to look at it but the\nthe other way to look at it is if you\nget an amazing job job job\nopportunity from a great institution\ngenerally speaking people will say sure\nyou may not I mean you can adapt there\ntoo but I think that like there's\ncertain things that are viewed as right\nanswers in life which I I don't think is\nthe case and that's the whole point but\nmakes sense what I'm kind of going to\nzero in on and tunnel down on is like if\nyou're someone who is struggling in life\nwith burnout or\ndrive you cannot come up with an answer\nfrom logic or emotion or if you come up\nwith that answer from logic or emotion\nif you start to implement it it is going\nto the experience is going to be like\nthis which is not unsolvable you can get\nthrough that but generally speaking\nlogic and emotion are not great places\nto operate from that's my belief that's\na that's a statement of belief I'm\nmaking it's funny I was actually just\nthinking about it people that um every\nonce while get a question like this\nwhere they're like I should I have this\njob or should I take this job and I'm\nlike which job do you want to take and\nthe moment you ask somebody that they\nsit there and they go you know I never\nasked that of\nmyself yeah absolutely right so so\nthey're they're operating from a place\nof logic or emotion instead of operating\nfrom a place of self now I've got a\nquestion for you so you said this comes\nfrom you yeah\num now\nyou mentioned that you had a grandiose\nversion of yourself in your mind what is\nthe relationship between the\ngrandios\nversion and\nself in your I think\nthe answer you come up with okay don't\nI'm just C I think the grandio version\nof myself when I was younger the the the\nFatal flaw that I had with that was I\ncan do anything and it doesn't matter I\nI can do anything at all and it it\nwouldn't matter I don't need to think\nabout it I can just do it who cares\nright and that was that doesn't make any\ndamn sense because when I did that I\ndidn't know why I succeeded I didn't\nknow why I failed and I didn't care and\nI learned nothing from it frankly and I\nI found that to\nbe it's it's kind of like gambling\nfrankly you're just gambling the whole\ntime and you're not learning anything\nfrom it so you don't get any long-term\nbenefits from that you just get\nkind of the luck of the draw frankly\nbecause you're just throwing things at\nthe wall and you're not even seeing what\nsticks you're just throwing things\nconstantly okay that's very useful we're\ngoing to tie that into something in a\nsecond but when you say grandiose\nversion of yourself I'm curious what is\nthe so like you have this voice inside\nyou right that says this is\nright and then by the way can you see\nwhat I'm screen sharing with you yes I\ncan I can see um and what is the\nrelation ship right so like I I'm and I\ncan come up with I can keep on using\nlanguage and framing this because what\nI'm asking is kind of confusing what is\nthe relationship between like what is\nthat what is the grandiose version of\nthe self and and this is right like this\nis Right comes from the self and then\nyou have the grandio version of the self\nare these the same thing are these\ndifferent things like what how do you\nunderstand this and if you don't that's\nperfectly fine because all offer a\nhypothesis I would say those were\ndifferent things okay and I think that\nthere's a a little bit of a little bit\nof that in there there has to be you\nhave to be strong enough to say this is\nright regardless of of any other pieces\nthat may come after that like logic and\nemotion telling you no this isn't right\nthis isn't right right it's it's the\ndriving force it's the one that says\nthis is what we're doing let's use\neverything else as a tool set to make\nsure that that happens so there is a\nlittle bit of like kind of domineering\naspect to that right okay but it's not I\nguess the best thing to say there is it\nit got tempered so before I went\nhomeless it was just like yeah we're\njust going to do it who cares about the\nconsequence who cares about how it\naffects anybody else who cares it how\naffects me later it's going to work\nright now so who cares right and that\nchanged completely now it's like okay\nwe're going to do this how do we do it\nin the right way that was the big shift\nbetween those two things how do we do it\nin the way that actually benefits the\nmost for everybody okay that was the\ndifference so now I'm going to offer a\ncouple things the first thing is I want\nyou to\nnotice this statement\nand this\nstatement what do you notice about these\ntwo statements they're pretty polar\nopposite that's what that's absolutely\ntrue and I would say that they are very\nsimilar because what is the object of\nthis statement it's I yeah right so this\nis where a lot of people get mixed up we\nlook at this and we see that this is at\nthe\nend and this is at the end and these two\nthings are\nopposites and if this one is bad then\nthis one must be good but it turns out\nthat the yogis would say no no no no no\nno no these both of these statements are\nequally bad yep so now we get to the\ntrue nature of\nself so deep within you you have tuya\nthe self the Atman the soul I don't know\nwhat this is right so this is NTI NTI\nyou have a voice within you some people\ncall it\nDivinity yep described as kind of a\nDivine Force things like that yeah and\nand there is some transcendental quality\nnow if we want to take a biological\nreductionist perspective we say nothing\nlike this exists and this is simply\nsubconscious processing or unconscious\nprocessing you could say that\nyeah okay I personally don't believe\nthat but that that I think is a very\nscientifically valid argument because\nnot only does this thing have no words\nthat can describe it it has no capacity\nto be measured makes sense okay yeah for\nso science will never detect this in my\nop for me I don't have an answer there\nand I think not having an answer is okay\nyeah that makes sense so and then you\ncan you can make an argument that it\nsort of doesn't matter but we'll we'll\nget we'll get to this a little bit I\nthink it matters greatly I just don't\nhave an answer I think it does I think\nit does too so then what happens is we\nhave this thing called the\naamar or the\nego now this is where these statements\ncome in I can do anything I am bad and\nif I if we ask you Thor how did you\nbecome the person that you say today you\nsite one inflection point which is a\npoint of basically abandoning your ego\nright so you even use the word humbling\nincredibly humbling so prior to this you\nhad a very very power ego and then The\nHumbling same thing with me by the way\nso I was like Premed and I was going to\nbecome you know I was going to go to\nHarvard and I was going to be one of the\nbest doctors on the planet and all this\nkind of [ __ ] and then like I had a very\nvery humbling experience over the course\nof years and years and years got rid of\nmy ego and the big irony is I wound up\ntraining there anyway but like I didn't\nyou know it wasn't a goal for me then it\nwas just it felt right um yeah so now\nhere's a lot of very important things to\nunderstand right so now that we've\nentered into the ego now a couple of\nthings happen if the ego controls your\nlogic and manages your emotions then\nthese tools will result in like\ndifferent kinds of problems this is also\nwhere we see the seed of burnout and\ndrive so if your drive comes from here\nso if your drive comes from here okay\nlet me think about how to draw\nthis so let's say say\nthat so let's say here is the dimension\nof\ndrive if your drive comes from here\nlogic and emotion okay what that means\nis that your drive will be\nconflicted because as the logic changes\nas your emotional state changes the\ndrive will Whiffle waffle this is what\nends up with people not truly being\nstuck so very few people are stuck in\nlife usually what happens with people is\nthey're more like pendulum where they\nmove two steps forward two steps back\ntwo steps forward two there's a lot of\nactivity which is why they're so\nexhausted all the time because they're\nactually moving a lot there's a lot of\nenergy being expended but the energy is\njust getting getting dissipated in two\nopposite directions yeah they're just it\nlooks like they're standing still but\nthey're actually working twice as hard\nas everybody else absolutely well said\nyep so if your drive comes from a hum\nGod or ego this can lead to a lot of\naccomplishment\nbut it will oftentimes lead to\nunhappiness uh a sense of\nfragility a lack of\ncontentment so this is what I see with a\nlot of people who have things like\nimpostor syndrome or people who are in\nbanking and they have this idea I want\nto be something one\nday so I want to be successful I want to\nbe respected I want to be sexy I want to\ndo this I I I I I I I and that can be\nused to be me it used to be me too yeah\nso that can drive us very effectively so\nwe'll see a lot of very success I'm not\ngoing to name names but I think you can\nlook at like the internet and Twitter\nand you can see a lot of people who have\na lot of objective measures of success\nbut if you just pay attention to them\nthey don't seem happy because they're\ngetting upset about stuff they're\ngetting into fights with like people\nlike you know they just don't seem\ncontent like someone who's content\nfighting on social media all the time\nyeah right so the there are people who\ncan let negativity like kind of Slough\noff them like a roof with rain like it\njust you know it falls on you and it\nkind of sloughs off and then there are\npeople who like really despite the fact\nthat they're very successful they they\ndon't appear to be content and that's\nbecause ego can absolutely drive us and\ncan lead to good outcomes and this is\nwhere a lot of people get confused\nbecause they want those things the\nproblem is that when we're operating\nfrom ego and when we're driven by\nego we this controls the ego controls\nthe emotion and the logic so we end up\ndoing things that are not good for us\nand end up leading to burnout so for\nexample let's say I'm at a let's say I'm\na programmer so we had a great interview\na couple maybe about a year and a half\nago with someone who was like dealing\nwith a lot of burnout and and this\nprogrammer was very successful and what\nwould happen is like they would they\nwould go home on the weekend like if\nthere was some problem that that needed\nto be solved they literally this is what\nthey would describe so they go home on\nFriday and then they would work on the\nproblem all weekend long there's a team\nof developers and they come in on Monday\nmorning with the solution so instead of\ngetting a weekend they do the whole\nteam's work over the course of the\nweekend and then they come in burnt out\non the weekend but man everyone is like\nholy crap this is great like thank you\nfor solving this problem and they feel\nso good from that positive enforcement\nthey have this desire to be and what we\nsort of discovered with them is they\nhave the desire to be the hero like I\nwant to be the hero it feels good to be\nthe hero but the hero is an aspect of my\nego so what happens when I when I\noperate from ego I want to be something\nis it causes us to make generally\nspeaking unhealthy trades so we value\nsomething so much and we're willing to\nsacrifice I don't want to disappoint my\nboss I want my boss to love me I want my\nboss to respect me so I'm never going to\nsay set a boundary with them yeah that\nmakes sense okay so this I think a lot\nof the times that that's kind of\ninteresting because I think a lot of the\ntimes that's the same sort of traits\nwhere it stops you from wanting to do\nthings like take breaks when you really\nneed to or be able to go on vacation\nlike one of the things I learned pretty\nearly is I do work a lot I really enjoy\nworking but when I need a break I listen\nto myself and I'm like I'm not going to\nstream today today I'm going to take a\nchill I'm going to walk away for a\nminute because you need to do that\neverybody no no matter how driven you\nare you have to do that absolutely right\nso I I think what what happens with the\nego is since it it almost shapes or even\nsuppresses logic and emotion it leads to\na very selective logic right so then the\nthe logical part of you that's like hey\nsometimes like you're human and you need\na break that gets suppressed so what\nhappens is a lot of people will\ncultivate this and I see this a lot like\non social media in terms of\num like you know this hustle culture and\nstuff like that that like sacrifice\nsacrifice sacrifices to be lotted all of\nthese people are operating from ego and\nyou can lead it can result in a lot of\npositive outcomes like materialistic\noutcomes absolutely but it also leads to\na lot of unhappiness and burnout and all\nkinds of like other negativity I I had\nthat actually so when I used to work for\nthe doe right because I worked for the\nDepartment of energy I made an insane\namount of money right because I was\nworking for the federal government\nhacking power plants right\ncrazy well wellp paid job but I was\nflying around the country 10 weeks a\nyear I wasn't home and they wanted to\nchange that to 30 weeks a year and I\nrealized like there's I could sacrifice\neverything I could just have no home\nlife I could just never be at my house I\ncould just not have any friends none of\nthis and I could make a ton of money\ndoing it but at a certain point it was\nlike that's not worth it it's absolutely\nnot worth it you I think there's there\nmight be a time and a place for that to\nput yourself in an advantageous\nsituation down the line if it's\nshort but you know but not a permanent\nsolution like that not something that\nlasts a super long period of time I can\nunderstand the idea of grinding for a\nlittle bit so that you can have yourself\nin a better situation but that stuff\nlike that can absolutely take over at\nleast I felt AB the draw for that and I\nwas like no I'm not doing it and so the\nthe challenge uh Thor is that if people\nare if ego is where they're coming from\nthey can't draw those limits okay\nbecause if I if I don't work 30 weeks\nthen in my mind I become something else\nand I don't want to be that thing and\nthe avoidance of that kind of thing like\nI want to be the hardest worker because\nthe hardest worker means I'm the best\nwhich means that if someone else and\nthis is the all kinds of problems come\nwith ego one is that uh comparison\nreally sets in so ego by by its nature\nexists to compare it's one of the\nfundamental things so like if I if I\nhave an identity of I'm the best what\nthat means is that like if that's my\nidentity and someone shows up who's\nbetter than me then I can't let them do\nthat so then either I need to work\nharder or I need to be toxic and try to\nsabotage them or all kinds of other crap\nhappens so comparison and ego go hand\ninand and even if we kind of look at\nsome of these this is kind of confusing\nfor a lot of people but recently I've\nbeen talking about how tall and short\nare not real things they are comparisons\nand they are abstractions so height is a\nreal thing absolutely but tall and short\nare comparisons you can't be if I'm the\nonly human being on the planet like and\nI live on a desert island or I live on\nan island there's no other human beings\nI won't be tall or short I will be a\ncertain height I can do certain things\nbut other human beings are necessary for\ntall and short to exist makes sense so\nso the other interesting way to see it\nI've actually never seen it that way\nit's quite funny but yeah know it's\nreally wild right so and then the people\nwho say this is not correct Dr K will if\nyou pay attention they will be operating\nfrom ego I am tall here is my experience\nof tall is there a reality of being of\nnot having a particular height\nabsolutely so I can't reach particular\nthings on the Shelf people will judge me\nabsolutely that judgment is 100%\nreal but there's this is what this is\nwhere things get really tricky the\njudgment is real but the way that I see\nmyself is moldable by me I think it's\nfunny because I use that as a point of\nhumor a lot of the times like the the\nRidiculousness of being like Oh short\npeople tall people it's like a it's a\nreally common silly joke that I tell cuz\nI'm 6'2 so it's slightly above the\naverage right\nand it's like it's not that it's not\nthat good to be a tall person because\nyou can see where you want to get to but\nthere's other short people in the way\nand like calling out the Ridiculousness\nof that kind of comparison is like I\nfind that really funny right because it\nit calls to point it's like it doesn't\neven matter right none of that stuff\neven matters but it's funny it's funny\nto do do that so so this is where there\nis a reality there is a real logic to\ntall and short but there is still if\nwe're operating from the ego it's never\ngoing to be enough and this is where\nlike I've worked with people and I guess\narguably I'm one of them so I'm like 5'7\nOr\n5'8 I'm confused about that because I\nthink I'm 5'7 and someone else says\nthey're 5'8 and I'm taller than they are\nso then I'm like I I don't know anymore\num probably 5 seven and a\nhalf and then uh and and so but like you\nknow I'm okay with that like that's fine\nwith like you know and people will say\nlike oh 57 cursed and it's like you know\nthat be honest yeah I I think it is\nfrustrating being taller sometimes\nplanes suck absolutely like legitimately\nthere so I I think there's always things\nthat go along with both and I that's why\nI always found it to be kind of silly\nlike it doesn't really matter yeah\nbecause like if you're shorter some\nthings are Out Of Reach people will make\nfun of you and if you're taller you get\nto hit your head on stuff and you're\nalso not going to fit in a lot of places\nlike I have to think about the shape of\na car that I want to get into right and\nthat sucks it's awful yeah I I I think\nthat there is there is a logic to that\nthat I think a lot of people because\nthey are operating from ego will reject\nthe thought that being tall comes with\ndisadvantages is something that their\nlogic will respond and say that is\ninsane the there may be some\ndisadvantages but the advantages far far\nfar outweigh the disadvantages I mean it\nit's funny to me because like there's\nnot a lot of advantages to having a toll\nprogrammer you know like it doesn't\nreally matter for\nus it's kind of a relevant and and they\nI'm pretty sure there are people out\nthere who would argue with you they\nwould find some other point of of\nargument my point is that when things\nare operating from the ego this this\ngrandiose sense of self as opposed to\nthya which is this Transcendent state\nwhich we'll get to\nthen it can lead to a lot of success but\nit will come at a very high price makes\nsense then there is I can agree with\nthat I think that makes a lot of sense\nto me honestly yeah so then there\nis operating from Tua so Tua is this\nfourth state of of Consciousness so if\nwe look at um this is kind of how we can\nview\nConsciousness which is\nawareness and then we can look at mental\nactivity and what we find is that we can\nmake a 2 by two table so there's plus\nminus plus minus so when we are aware\nand we are and we have mental activity\nthis is what we call\nwakefulness right I'm I'm awake which\nmeans I'm aware that I exist and my mind\nis functioning when I have no\nconsciousness and mental activity this\nis when I am\ndaydreaming or\ndreaming so I lose my sense of awareness\nbut my mind is operating right and it's\nbeautiful that we even call this\ndaydreaming because we figure out that\nthese two states are very similar\nsubjectively get that when I read a book\nas weird as that is yeah right so we\nwhen we get lost in something there is a\nlot of engrossing mental\nactivity um and then over here is\nsleep and over here\nis let's call it thya or this is where\nwe have Consciousness but we have no\nmental activity so this is the goal of\nmeditation is to move into this place so\nthis is where once again if we think\nabout\nego uh logic and emotions these are\nthings that are part of the\nmind that makes sense this is the mind\nright so I have a sense of who I am I\nhave logical thoughts I have emotions\nemotions can be physical too for\nsure um but the goal is to actually the\ngoal of meditation is to move into this\nplace now somewhere along the way you\ntapped into this and this is what's\nsuper cool about operating from Thia is\nthat when you operate from this place\nlike all kinds of cool stuff happens the\nfirst thing that happens is that you\nhave very high\nreserves of\nenergy yeah okay so much like you I work\noften times seven days a week and I\nwon't work 16 to 19 hours a day I\nbasically can't unless I'm doing\nclinical work so I can work like 60 hour\nshifts at a hospital because I'm\nconstantly seeing patients but I can't\ndo regular work like that but what I\ntend to find is that I I tend to run out\nof energy like I I have low endurance so\nI'll work seven days a week because that\nkind of works for me but you have a lot\nof reserves of energy the other cool\nthing is that you're resilient to\nsetbacks oh\nyeah right is an advantage absolutely so\nthis is where we go to this where\nfailure becomes and even if you think\nabout the term right so failure implies\nthe end of something setback implies a\ncontinuation yeah and if we fuel huh it\nbecomes fuel absolutely right so this is\nwhat's really crazy is that like if you\nthink about any event in life it is\nneither a failure nor a setback it is\nthe way in which you conceptualize it\nwhich determines whether this is a\nfailure or a setback so I applied to\nmedical school for a year got rejected\n40 times was that a failure like\nabsolutely like object L you could call\nit that but is the attitude that you\ntake this is an opportunity to learn we\ngot to keep doing it let's keep moving\nforward you know it I certainly had\nthese feelings of I am bad and in my\ncase I had gone through some degree of\nformal training which we'll talk about\nat the very end\ntoday um that helped me move from here\nto here but once again the key thing if\nyou if people want to stop thinking this\nway this is what they need to eliminate\nthe eye the ey needs to be eliminated\nbecause if we pay attention to your\nlanguage Thor you do not operate from\ney right so it's like pretty rare huh\nit's pretty rare I mean I still use the\nword ey no no we all use the so the ego\nis so the ego eventually when we do it\nright the ego becomes a tool just like\nlogic and emotion ego isn't bad it is\njust that we should be aware of like ego\nand we should not operate from ego\nso when you operate from thya you also\nget a sense of like direction right and\nthen what happens is normally when we\nget\nparalyzed by Logic and emotion right so\nthis kind of business this kind of\nbusiness goes away so what happens is\nthat right now so there's like two ways\nof operating so if I'm over\nhere and as I move this way I get more\nnegative and then what happens is since\nI'm trying to do something good like the\nreason I moved this way in the first\nplace is because over here there was a\nbeneficial ratio of like positive and\nnegative there's neuros signs to this as\nwell now that the ratio is unfavorable I\nmove this way but now I'm over here and\nthen I end up doing this so when you\noperate from a place of thya what\nhappens is this negativity becomes an\nobstacle to overcome we don't stop\nmoving in this direction it just becomes\na problem to solve we keep moving in\nthat direction so then the experience is\nlike this this is our activation\nit's friction but we don't stop moving\neven though there's friction so it's\nkind of funny it's like it's it's\nfriction it's like there's a wall in\nfront of you and you just walk through\nit yeah you just keep walking till it's\nnot there anymore this is this is also\nwhat gives us follow through so this is\na huge problem in our community right\nnow like in the world where people like\ndon't follow through with stuff and the\nyou're not going to follow through if\nyou're operating from logic or drive you\nwill absolutely follow through if you\nare operating from what I would call a\nTranscendent space and by Transcendent I\nmean a place that is outside of your\nmind right that that drive comes from in\nhere it doesn't come from up here yeah\nit's actually it's it's funny because we\nwe're playing that puzzle game all day\ntoday and basically every time I hit one\nof those puzzles it was like a ramp up\nand it was like another another another\nbecause you're you're hitting all these\nobstacles and I see a lot of people fail\nout of games like that they put negative\nsort of emotions to those types of\nthings and they're like oh I hate this\ncuz the game didn't hand it to me oh\nand it's like for me it's like no like\nmore like keep keep giving more\nobstacles please because that that's\nwhat drives me for that it makes it more\ninteresting so this is where there\nchallenges when when I teach that that\nmakes so I'll I'll kind of reflect that\nconcept back to you so there's this\nconcept in Eastern religions basically\nor spiritual Traditions called Dharma so\nDharma means Duty and the cool thing\nabout duty is generally speaking in life\nwe try to run away from negative things\nso your life would be way easier if you\ncould run towards things that were\npainful in some capacity and that's what\nDharma allows you to do so if we're\noperating from logic or emotion or gains\nor outcomes it's all about a risk\nbenefit our brain even does this action\nsuccess calculation where it like\ndecides whether something is worth it or\nnot this is why everyone procrastinates\nwhen they're studying for a test because\nour brain knows that if we wait until 48\nhours and we cram we can still pass\nthat's how the brain decides and it\ndecides that I can study for 2 days or I\ncan study for two months and in one case\nI get a c and in one case I get an A and\nfrom an actual like hourly calculation\nit is more beneficial for me to\nprocrastinate because a c for two days\nis worth is is a way better deal it's\nway better value than 60 days of\nstudying for an a yeah so when we look\nat\nDharma Dharma is also what allows us to\ndo hard things so I I I I I don't think\nyou have kids but you know I have kids\nand the best example FS huh I have 38\nferrets in a rescue that's right so so\nactually the ferrets are are a good\nexample so you know if you think about\nmaking sacrifices like staying up or\nspending your money if you do it out of\na duty to your ferrets or I do it for my\nkids because I don't have ferrets then\nit makes it easier to stay up late right\nit it makes it easier to do the dishes\nit makes it easier to do laundry Beyond\nyourself ABS yeah Beyond yourself right\nso once again this allows us Dharma\nallows us to mitigate the strength of\nthe\nego okay Mak sense um there's another\nkind of Dimension which I want to kind\nof talk about real quick I think I'm\nscreen sharing with you so hopefully\nyall can see this so I'm going to just\ntoss in a little bit of science because\nthere's some support of these principles\nthis isn't really a one to one there are\nother studies which we could talk about\nTranscendent States Of Consciousness and\npsychedelics and ego death and stuff\nlike that if you want to talk about that\nwe can oh yeah I take this um this is\nwhere I want to introduce this concept\nto people of hedonic and and udics let\nme see if I can find a you ever heard\nthose terms actually yeah so let's let's\ntake a look at some brain brain stuff so\nwhat we know is that there are two kinds\nof things that make people happy and I\nthink the big problem is that when we're\noperating from ego so usually when we're\noperating from our base logic or\nemotions this results in hedonics now\npeople may get confused because they're\nsaying like logically isn't it a good\nidea to they understand with emotions\nlike if I gratify emotions like yeah\nthat's like short-term pleasure but\noften times our logic is flawed right so\nwe'll say we'll like logic ourselves oh\nyeah like I can get drunk today like\nit's not that big of a deal like I can\ndo this work tomorrow that's logical\nthinking but it's in a honic Pursuit so\nwhat what I find in people who are\nhighly addicted to stuff is that their\nlike logical brain is actually run by\ntheir addiction they will constantly\nit's just in relation to Hedonism right\nabsolutely so a lot of our logical\nthinking actually results in a\nhedonistic lifestyle and I know that\nthat runs contrary to what a lot of\npeople would think they're like oh no\nemotions are honic and like if I lived\nmy life logic that's not actually how it\nworks if you pay attention to eating\nthat cookie like your brain will give\nyou logic as to why it's okay yeah it's\nit's always like it is a a way of\nproving yourself like well it's okay to\ncheat on my diet this time absolutely\nbecause of these reasons so yeah that\nmakes sense that leads to humanism for\nsure and people will call that flawed\nlogic but it is my experience as a\npsychiatrist that the abstraction of\nlogic and code when put into a human\nbrain is no longer objective like that's\njust not doable I think it's always the\nfirst reaction too it's not the well I\nshould have the cookie you know it's\nlike no I I have to convince myself I\nhave to give myself a reasoning why it\nshould absolutely right so so so your\nbrain will do that like you'll work\nreally hard to convince your your the\naddicted part of your brain will work\nreally hard to convince the other parts\nof your brain through logic that what it\nwants is correct do you think we see the\nsame thing in um kind of criminal\nBehavior it's like I should do this bad\nthing because of these reasons so it\nmakes it okay absolutely we not not just\ncriminal all\nBehavior interesting yeah so I mean you\nsee this with all the time so then\nthere's this concept so this is kind of\nhedonics and the more that we operate\nfrom here the more we're UD dionic this\nis my understanding of the Neuroscience\nof it and like one other like one other\nway to look at this is that none of this\nstuff is actually existing this is all\nunconscious process cessing and the\nreason that we feel good when we operate\nthis is because of\nudonia um but anyway so let's so here's\nudonia if if if you know hedonics is for\nHedonism what is udonia what's the you\nknow Bas of that we're going to talk\nabout that so hedonics is\npleasure\ngratification the Fulfillment of desires\nuh comes from the nucleus succumb and\ndopamine but I'm going to show you a\npaper that shows that that's not even\ncorrect a lot of what interesting um a\nlot of what I'm saying is like\noversimplifications because the truth is\nis that Neuroscience is incredibly\ncomplicated yeah we're still figuring it\nout so okay so now here's the cool thing\nso here's what we know leads to\nudonia First is self-determinism\nsecond is self-expression\nexpression third is effort and fourth is\nimportance right so when I see your life\nnow we're talking science okay forget\nabout soul and all this nonsense when I\nsee your life I see all four of these\nthings so you are living a deterministic\nyou're a life of self-determinism you\ndecide you want to do something right\nwe'll talk about the Transcendence we're\ngoing to go to science then we'll end up\nin spirituality I'm fine with it so\nthere's self-determinism there is\nself-expression right very literally\nlike you are expressing yourself\nconstantly when we look at burnout what\nwe tend to find is that burnout is\ninversely correlated with\nemonia so in cases of burnout like you\nwere saying people don't get recognized\nfor their work they don't get to do what\nthey want in their job and the advice\nthat you give people is like if you make\nyour hobby your job there's a chance you\nmay not love it and why is that that's\nbecause when it's a hobby it's all about\nself-expression and self-determination\nbut once you have invoices to send once\nyou have customer service tickets to\nhandle once you have all this kind of\nstuff you lose that capacity for\nself-determination and\nself-expression yeah another another big\none that I talk to people about is if\nyou're if you're feeling bad in your job\nlike you don't you don't feel good you\ndon't feel like what you're doing\nmatters is to talk to your boss\nand if your if your boss is good in any\ncapacity they'll tell you you're doing\ngreat here's how or you're doing badly\nhere's how and either way you have an\nanswer which helps state that goal like\nif if it's bad then you have you know\nTarget if it's good then you have backup\nright yeah so I don't think that works\nfor most people so I think your advice\nis correct I've seen it I've seen it\nworks sometimes but I think you're right\nI think in some because it it hinges on\nanother person that is an out said\nunknown variable and I mean I would\nargue that the reason that works so well\nso I think it's the right advice sure I\nthink if we want to understand when\npeople do that they're not able to hear\nthat right so I think that's what you\nthat's what you that's what you give\nthem I think it's very important that\nyou do that Thor I don't think it's the\nwrong answer I'm saying it doesn't work\nfor some people and the reason is\nbecause of the ego that I agree with\nright super agree with that that's one\nof the biggest things is I I've never I\ndon't think there is a silver bullet if\nthat makes sense there is\noh so I think you found it right that\nthat's what we're talk we're talking\nabout the Silver Bullet I I\ndon't just because things are comp we'll\nget there but I I I just want to point\nout that if you go to your boss and sure\nthat's assuming that your boss is decent\nbut even in the case that your boss is\ndecent if your boss says you doing a bad\njob and here are the reasons why for a\nlot of people they'll say I suck yeah\nthey'll go down this and they can't go\ndown this so what is the difference\nbetween that's the ego it's framing ego\nyeah so so I I think part of what you\noffer which is awesome Thor is that you\nteach people this literal thinking and\nthe more that people think this instead\nof this if this is what happens in their\nmind their ego will get weaker and they\nwill proceed you're 100% correct that\nwas that's always why I try to frame it\nthat way which is when you get the\nanswer if the answer is negative you\nneed to see it as a Target that you can\nreach to to fix to get better and you\nhave to see it that way and if you don't\nsee it that way then it's it's worthless\nbut in that in that track of thinking\nThor I I invite you I mean this is what\nI see I see no ego\nthere right I see externalization of the\nissue you think that it's do you think\nit's it's beneficial to portray that as\neven an option though because I find a\nlot of the times people don't even\nrealize that's possible yes they don't\nyeah no I think what you're doing is VE\nlet me be super clear I think what\nyou're doing is correct very beneficial\nand you are training people you are\nliterally training people to think in\nthis way you're training people to think\noutside of the ego I think the main\nthing that I'm sort of pointing out is\nthat the reason that you offer advice\nand it has a differential impact on\npeople and now what I'm trying to do is\ntalk to the members of your audience if\nthey want your advice to apply better\nTranslate more into their life this is a\nmissing\ncomponent because it is the people who\nare not able to absolve themselves of\ntheir ego not become objective not think\nlong term not zoom out they're not able\nto do those things then it won't\nwork if they're able to do this and we\nsee in your life that you had an\ninflection point of dissolution of the\nego which is why you can think like\nthis I do think that it it's funny\nbecause I I don't ever call that to\nattention for that because I know that\nthere are more components that went into\nthat and it's kind of like a journey of\nthat over time sure because I find\nsometimes people use that as a sort of a\ncrutch for it to say well I can't do it\nbecause I didn't have that experience ah\nso interesting what look at the what\nwhat what were those statements that you\nmade well I can't do it because I didn't\nhave that experience specifically and I\nI do I do see that you know where people\nlike well I he had it so he's he's got\nthe special power now you know\nthing it's a way to defeat any potential\ntype of growth by saying that you're in\na position where it is impossible for\nyou without trying absolutely so that\nstatement comes from the ego that's why\nit doesn't\nwork do you see that it's like the same\nconstruction any construction that\noperates from here is going to be like\nflawed maybe not any but the majority of\nthem in the context that we're talking\nabout okay so um\nso I I think that this is like and this\nis what I'm sort of lost to myself for a\nsecond because I I I love it because\nthat's exactly what they say right and\nnow we see like the principle in play is\nthat a lot of people go through their\nlives it's interesting because you\nmentioned adaptability I I just uh put\ntogether a lecture which hopefully will\nbe coming out soon and and one of the\nkey things that makes people less\nadaptable is\nthey I I'll I'll skip that for now I\nthink the big thing for me is you're not\ngoing to succeed in the same way as me\nyou're not going to succeed in the same\nway as somebody else that's why I really\ndislike when people draw comparisons\nbetween themselves and other people's\nwork they're like oh I'm not a good\nartist because look at that artist over\nthere doesn't make any sense they're in\na completely different Journey\ncompletely different things that they've\nlearned they've gone a totally different\npath to learning things you have to look\nat yourself three months ago six months\nago and say Where am I compared to where\nI was and that's that to me is more\nimportant than looking at someone else's\nthing you know looking at someone else's\nprogress and that's the same thing for\nme right I did all my things you know I\nwent I went down that path and did all\nthese things but the idea is that you're\nyou have your own path and you learn\nyour own things in your own way and\nyou'll have your own adaptations that\nare vastly different from mine and\nthat's kind of how that goes right yeah\nso I I would I would agree 100% that the\nhealthiest comparison to make in life is\na comparison to\nyourself and even that can get a big one\nthat can get that can get uh messed up\nthough because like especially when I\nwork with people who are like sober like\nyou're sober for a year and then you\nrelapse and then you look at your former\nself and you see fallen and and you see\nthat you fallen and and that can create\nproblems so even I think ego is like\nbasically it should never be in control\nlike it's a tool just like your logic in\nyour emotion yeah I do think that that\nis that is probably one of the most\ndevastating situations I've seen is when\nsomeone is relapsing especially from\naddiction you know that's just so it's\nso rough because that does break that\nentire thing of like look at everything\nthat I've accomplished I've made it this\nfar you know but again it's the eye I've\nI've made it's the eye it's the eye it's\nthe eye it's the eye okay yep so just\none last I mean I I I'm not feeling too\nmuch of a need for science right here\nbut we'll just kind of talk about this\nvery quickly so if you look it like this\nis the honic brain circuitry right so I\nthink nucleus succumb is going to be\nsomewhere over here um let's see yeah so\nyeah right here it's whatever this one\nis um it's somewhere around here and\nthen what we know is that the oh where's\nthe\nemonia anyway emonia comes from other\nparts of your brain like your uh\nventromedial prefrontal cortex I don't\nsee it over here\num but it's like it's more it's it\nanyway so it comes so we know that\nemonia comes from some areas pleasure\ncomes from other areas and that\nbasically like even when it comes\nto um um let me just look\nat yeah so in particular the\nventromedial prefrontal cortex forms\nthese flourishing beliefs by generating\npositive evaluations of Life\ncircumstances like life satisfaction the\nself self-esteem relationships and goal\nprogress so emonia is about these kinds\nof Dimensions now I know I'm talking\nabout the ego but I'm using ego the\nreason I use aamar is because that's an\na different concept it's actually a\ndifferent thing but the self is not ego\nthe ego is the construction of my\nidentity and what we sort of know is\nthat the regions that are associated\nwith hedonics and pleasure are different\nfrom the regions that are associated\nwith like being satisfied with your life\nwe also know that uh let me see if I can\nfind\nthis uh it's not here okay um I was\nhoping to find a good paper I think it's\nin a different paper that talks about\nwhat the components of emonia are I'm\nsure they'll have it here um give me a\nsecond\nuh okay we'll skip that I don't think\nit's that important but anyway the point\nhere is that when we're talking about\nliving a fulfilling life we don't want\nto operate from these things and\ninterestingly enough a comp lishment of\ngoals so this is really important goal\naccomplishment is over\nhere this is one that really trips\npeople up so if you look at UD demonics\nit's not accomplishment it's actually\neffort and importance it's things like\nself-determinism and self-expression and\nif you look at studies on\nburnout what we know we basically know\nis know what burns people out so what\nburns people out is not working hard it\nis working hard and being ineffectual\nyep so for me like the top of the list\nis like I can see a patient I can be on\ncall I remember there's one particular\ncase from residency where we had a\npatient who was on the I was doing I was\nworking on the neurology floor so not\nPsychiatry and we had a patient who\nneeded a very expensive so we had a\n40-year-old person who basically had an\nautoimmune condition where his eyes were\nbeing eaten by his immune system so the\neyes are super scary because they're\nactually immunoprotected so our our our\nbody knows what we are and it knows what\nother people are this is why we get\ntransplant rejection and things like\nthat because the body recognizes this is\nforeign tissue One really scary thing is\nthat our eyes are never exposed to our\nimmune system so if our immune system\never gets into our eyes in a certain way\num it'll actually activate an autoimmune\nreaction and your your immune system\nwill eat your eyes so this was happening\nto this patient in real time and we we\nhad worked really hard to figure out why\nthis person who was in their 40s like\nsuddenly was going blind we were like\nwhat the hell is going on so we did all\nkinds of tests and stuff and then we\nfinally figured out okay this is an\nautoimmune reaction so we talked to the\ninsurance company the insurance company\nwas like we're not going to pay for that\ntreatment we're like this is crazy like\nyou guys need a\npay that's the height of burnout like\nthe whole like 24 hours of very very\nintensive tests and calling consultants\nand like talking to this person and\nreally trying to figure out insurance\ndoesn't care that fine with like that\ndoesn't burn you out working hard\ndoesn't burn you out it is the inability\nto work hard uh sorry it is working hard\nand not getting some kind of result that\nreally leads to burnout yeah no I can\nagree with that I mean like since I work\nin you know rescue we we get all kinds\nof cases that come in and some of them\nare pretty horrific like two of the\nferrets that we had have uh an\nautoimmune disorder called dim\ndisseminated idiopathic myofasciitis and\nit's the neutrophils from which is\ncomponent of the immune system attacking\nall of the soft tissue of their body\nheart everything everything everything\nand it's they basically just form holes\neverywhere and disintegrate that's kind\nof how that goes and it's horrific to\nwatch but I gained a lot of good feeling\nout of this from like helping them\nbecause what we did was we reached out\nto the foremost Veterinary in in uh\nOregon that is dealing with this we took\nthat and then um like worked with them\nand they gave us all their research and\nthen we worked with the F to try and\nfigure this out and basically what we\ndid was we gave them a chemotherapy that\nsuppresses the bone marrow that reduces\nthe neutrophils in the body and ferrets\nregenerate very quickly right so at a\ncertain point if you keep doing this and\nyou do it in ways where it doesn't kill\nthem because the bone marrow also\nproduces red blood cells so you don't\nwant them to you know run out of that\nbut thankfully ferrets don't have uh\nthey don't have blood types so you can\njust do transfusions if that does happen\nwhich is kind of cool they get to a\npoint where they regenerate faster than\nthe damage being done so now mocha and\nLatte of the two that we have like this\nthey're totally fine they're in\nremission because of it and those types\nof situations are like really scary\nautoimmune situations are insane to deal\nwith you just watch them deteriorate I'm\nkind of curious about that can I ask a\ncouple questions you may not know\nbecause But but so so when you say they\nregenerate fair enough from like a red\nblood cell perspective but as soon as\nthe bone marrow bounces back don't the\nneutrophils start attacking the muscle\ntissue again yes they do so what we have\nto do is just keep doing testing again\nto see what their neutri count is\ngenerally a feret that's in dim it is a\nuh detection of exclusion right so they\nthey test for exclusion they test\neverything else first and then they find\nat the end this is the only thing that\nis left so it's usually pretty hard most\npeople euthanize a fa that has dim most\nof the time U there's been an uptick it\nrecently they don't quite know the cause\nthere's not enough research that's being\ndone on this but situations like this\nallow us to learn more stuff and they\nspread it out to all the vets that we\nwork with everything like that but with\nthis one it was um it's more interesting\nbecause when you're testing for this you\ncan see the neutr count is very high\ninsanely High normally a feret's going\nto have usually between 500 and 2,000\nper blood count and they're at like\n160,000 like crazy high numbers we like\nthis is ridiculous what do your ferrets\neat uh raw food diets so everything is\nfully raw food diets it's a freeze-dried\nraw food and it's easy to control that\nbecause it's easy to figure out what\ntheir kidney and liver values are\nsupposed to be out of that while making\nsure they get all the proper nutrition\nwhat um what I'm curious though like\nwhen you say fine it's freeze-dried raw\nfood but what is it meat 100% meat\nthey're obligate carnivors meat and Bone\nhuh they are it is all meat and Bone\nthey are obligate Carnivor so meat bone\nand egg is all they can eat interesting\nso ferrets don't eat any vegetables no\nnot at all it'll actually kill them so\nif you give them even pea protein so\nlike protein derived from peas it gives\nthem kidney stones can't have anything\nother than meat meat bone and egg\nyep no such thing as a vegan Fen not a\nthing what percentage of their diet is\negg oh very low to be honest with you um\nit depends some ferrets can have\nindigestion from that very low amounts\nof it can cause kind of like well the\npoops right they have diarrhea from it\nif they don't tolerate it very well but\nuh it's usually seen as as more of a\ntreat a lot of it is mostly ground meat\nand Bone and the the biggest thing you\nhave to Target is tarine because you\nhave to make sure they get about 500\nmilligrams of tarine per day for healthy\nkind of feret and they do self-regulate\nso they won't overeat which is\ninteresting not like a dog we'll just\nkeep eating and eating and eating but um\nso you can just kind of put food in\nthere and they'll self-regulate but if\nyou don't do that you you don't hit that\nMark they get heart disease and and it\nwill kill them 100% of the time we've\nactually reversed some of the heart\ndisease and that what do wild ferrets\neat black footed ferrets are the same\nyeah no but but like like what what is\ntheir actual\nprey oh jeez all kinds of stuff so a\nferret can actually take down an animal\nbetween two to three times size um they\ncan take down a chicken they can take\ndown um other small mammals they can\ntake down there's they're very vicious\nHunters but their their primary diet the\nprimary thing they want to take down\nrabbits they are very skilled at going\ninto Burrows and taking down rabbits no\nproblem interesting that's a big thing\nthat they're yeah they're fantastic at\nit they're actually used for hunting in\nEurope because of that do do they eat\nreptiles amphibians or\ninsects no not insectivores um I think\nin a pinch they might try eat a reptile\nbut that's not like a normal thing and\namphibian also not like a normal thing\nokay that's really interesting yeah so I\nwas just curious because a lot of what\nthis autoimmune stuff at least what we\nknow for humans is that dietary changes\nhave huge impacts on autoimmune status\nwe're seeing as as odd as this is the\nthe last time that we had a huge uptick\nin specifically dim was when they\nchanged the formulation for what is\ncalled canine distemper vaccine so\ncanine distemper is 100% chance of death\nin ferrets\nit is vicious you they don't survive\nwhatsoever um and it spreads throughout\nthe population very quickly because it's\na feal oral rout and it just just goes\nthrough the whole thing kills them all\nso what they have to do is every Fair\ngets K9 dis temper vaccine and something\nwith Marshalls they Chang the\nformulation on it and they had a massive\nincrease in dim and then they changed\nthe formulation again and it dropped off\nagain there are still cases where they\nget dim but we don't know why quite yet\nthere's not enough research and\nunfortunately because so few\nveterinaries are actually trained on how\nto identify dim in the first place we\ndon't get a lot of good data points on\nhow to detect this and we don't get a\nlot of good data points on how\nwidespread it really is most of the time\nit's fad is lethargic they're having\nthese weird problems they're they're not\neating they're not drinking euthanize\nlike euthanize and that's it it is very\nsad but that's generally the way that it\ngoes so when we when we talk to ver you\nknow vets or rescues or anything like\nthat if we find out that they have a\nferret that fits the kind of General\nconditions that a dim feret could have\nwe go go talk to your vet here's some\npaperwork and like take this and we\nwe've had a couple of times where\nthey're like oh yeah no totally like\nthis it turns out that they do have dim\nbut the chemotherapy for that is also\nincredibly expensive it's like $450 a\ntreatment and you're talking like a\ntreatment every two weeks for the next\nsix months right and like that's not\ncheap for people it's not cheap at all\nso like there's got to be something that\nchanges with that to save these animals\nreally when they're in this kind of a\nsituation thankfully with us running the\nrescue here here on on Twitch and like\nthe ad revenue from that ad Revenue paid\nfor it all so we just do it and we don't\nhave to think about it and save the\nanimal's lives but for an average owner\nthat's not possible which is why\neuthanasia happens we we usually will\nreach out to people that we can find out\nfor that and if they are in an area\nwhere we can take them we we try to you\nbe like hey do you want to surrender the\nanimal because we have a good chance of\nsaving them we have a good track record\nwith this we haven't lost one yet so far\nbecause we know how to handle it but um\nthat's a big part of building that new\nRescue is like I you know the the the\npoint of this is going to the largest\nrescue in the United States that's the\nwhole idea is to make sure that we can\nhave kind of a coverage that's beyond\njust you know 50 m radius which is sort\nof where we're at right now you know\nit's like the 50 miles is about it it's\nlike 50 to 100 miles is like the maximum\nthat we can really go because outside of\nthat it's just it's not possible you\nknow it's just too far and what is the\naverage lifespan of a ferret in the\nUnited States about it's about five\nyears due to poor genetics unfortunately\num Marshall's Farms is the primary\nbreeder inside of the US they produce\nall the laboratory Animals United States\nferally funded so that's not really\ngoing anywhere unfortunately the\nbreeding practices have led to bad\ngenetics that include heart disease and\ncancer incredibly common in Europe most\nferrets live to about 10 and they've\nalso found that if you take a European\nferet and you you cross breed them with\na polecat they live to almost 20 years\nold or oneyear old because they either\ndie horrifically to cancer really early\nor they live forever which is really\ninteresting and kind of strange PCAT is\na kind of feret PCAT is another musin\nit's a wild type different sort of\nanimal kind of like a mink or things\nlike that right so muss the whole the\nwhole classification of muss can be like\nbadgers you know I think otters all\nkinds of different stuff it's musle\nthose those animals that look very\nfriendly but will [ __ ] tear you apart\nrip you to bits yeah oh yeah they're\nthey're so vicious they're so if the\nferrets were larger I'd be dead right is\nis an otter a musulin I think I'm pretty\nsure an otter is let me look this up I\nwant to make sure before I move forward\nyeah so I I think it just falls under\nthe category of like cute and I want to\ncuddle it but it can it can literally\neviscerate me yeah they they they have\nsuch strong bite strength like such\nstrong bite strength as well and they're\nI don't know they're a little weasel\nshaped you know they're so cute yeah\nthey're AB absolutely and some some\nferrets will bite you pretty hard too\nyou got to train it out of them that's a\npretty common thing behavioral training\nyou know Thor I I I know this is a\nlittle bit outside of the scope of my\nexpertise in this conversation but I I\nthink that like especially with\nmyofasciitis um I've seen a lot of\nreally good outcomes like so this there\nI don't know how much how many studies\nthere are on this I imagine they're out\nthere I'm just you know Rheumatology and\nautoimmune disease is not my area of\nexpertise but I see it a lot I used to\nsee it a lot in my patients because\nthere's an overlap between autoimmune\nillness and a lot of these like\nfibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome\nthere's a lot of these things that end\nup in Psychiatry or like often times\nthese weird occult autoimmune kind of um\nwhat's another example chronic lime is\nlike another good example of like some\nweird autoimmune\nactivation um and and diet really seems\nto be like quite helpful for a fair\nchunk of patients yeah so that's the\nhardest part about this is there's no\nthere's no way you can possibly modify\nthe diet we can choose a different\nprotein Source but it has to be\nanimal-based protein because if you go\ninto vegetable based protein they get\nkidney stones and they get them real\nfast too so you end up having this weird\nproblem with that where like there's not\na huge amount of options unfortunately\nand I I'd love to explore that more I\nreally would I I just don't know where\nto go for that I I the next time I you\nknow I'll this is kind of floating\naround in the back of my mind I I may\njust the next time I get in touch with a\nfew colleagues I may just ask them if\nthey know anything about parents but oh\nyeah no totally and it's funny because\nlike my main goal with it is we create\nenough situations where there is a good\na positive outcome like we have like\nwhere they're basically in remission\nright and to be real with you the way\nthat we see remission on this is mocha\nand latte have not had a treatment for 6\nmonths and they've had no problems they\nrun around they play like any other\nferrets they have no issues right none\nwild and um my hope is to get rid of\nthat idiopathic part of that that\ndiagnosis right which is the if you\ndon't know what idiopathic means it it's\nwe don't know where it comes from\nand like that's it right we just don't\nknow we have NOA like this happens\nspontaneously from somewhere and that's\nsucks you know it's a really awful thing\nwe don't know the cause and eventually\nmy hope is that we do know the cause and\nthere's just not enough information I\nthink a lot of that information gets\nlost because we euthanize the animals\nwhen we don't know what it is oh yeah\nyou didn't hear about Henry did you our\nferet no so we had a ferret come in he\nhe had been owned by these people since\nhe was half a year old um if a feret mom\ngets and you're going to love this this\nis wild if a phah mom gets uh feline\nparvo or canine d\nwhether she lives or\ndies the the babies that she has have a\nvery high chance of having weird brain\nanomalies um physical changes in the\nbrain and usually they end up dead right\nso this this Farah comes into us and\nhe's two years old and the owners are\nlike he's only turning left or like oh\nthat's neurologic like immediately\nyou're like that's going to be Aur\nneurologic issue he can only do circling\nbehavior only moving left like\nsomething's definitely wrong here he\ncan't control his mouth he can't eat so\nwe're feeding him syringe feeding him\nfor like weeks\nand um we go and get him a CT scan we\nfound out he has middle ear infections\nand outer ear infections in both ears\nthey're like okay here's something we\ncan objectively fight find out what's\ngoing on here and see how he reacts\nafterwards afterwards he stopped what is\ncalled Head pressing where they they\npush their head on things because\nthey're in so much pain and he stopped\nuh the inability to eat fell away so he\ncould he could feed himself but he moved\nreally weird he's constantly doing these\nweird head movements and he's still not\nrunning quite correctly he there's\nclearly something wrong so we set up an\nMRI and MRI are pretty expensive but\nlike again rescue pays for it we can do\nthe whole thing and we put them through\nthe the whole MRI we get him out 60% of\nhis brain is scar tissue 60 and it's all\nthrough the brain like it it's 60% of\nthe white matter of the brain is scar\ntissue and even the portions that would\nnormally control autonomic functions so\nlike things like heart and and lungs\ntotally Scar Tissue which is\nmindboggling so the time that he was\nborn was when there was whistleblowers\nthat talked about there being a k9 diser\noutbreak at Marshalls where they\nsuddenly stopped giving ferrets to any\nof the the vet or any of the pet Coast\ninside of the United States so\nwhistleblower said that about 250,000\nferrets died that time period was when\nhe was born which means there was a very\nhigh chance his mom got K9 diser if that\nwas true he somehow survived six months\nwith that kind of\nissue moving like that without being\ndetected because they would call him if\nthat was the case if they found him made\nit into a P store got bought it half a\nyear made it to two years this way and\nthen came to us and then finally we find\nout what's wrong with him and it's it's\nwild because we've got we've been able\nto see him adopt behaviors from the\nother ferrets so he can do things like\ndigging Behavior now didn't do that when\nhe first sced us um he can run and jump\nnow he tried to groom one of the other\nferrets the other day which is new new\nbehavior and like we can watch him being\nable to pick up Social traits but it\nit's mindboggling to see how much of his\nbrain is damaged it's completely I can\nactually send you the you said you said\nwhite white matter damage right that is\ncorrect 60% and some of some other\nportions some of structures that is it's\ncompletely annihilated basically so and\nit's it's also it is um fully\nsymmetrical the damage so it had to have\nhappened before he was born so SOA is\ncanine distemper a parvo virus can let\nme actually look that up to make sure\nbecause you mentioned parvo earlier and\nI was yeah feline parvo so you know it's\ninteresting cuz I mean that's that's\nconsistent so there's it's it's\nfascinating I love hearing that story so\nhere's like a couple of initial thoughts\nfirst is you mentioned that um virus yes\nboth so so you you mentioned that the\nfet wasn't called right so like we have\nto think about it kind of statistically\nso it actually makes sense like\neverything in your story makes sense and\nand things could get better so let's\nunderstand a couple Basics one is\num so when you have you know a perinatal\nor prenatal viral infection of the brain\ngenerally speaking that is very very bad\nbut there are there can it sort sort of\nmakes sense it's almost like a selection\nbias where the feret\nthat how can I say this out of 250,000\nfets if there is one fet that happens to\nhave the viral infection in a certain\nway that it is not detected early like\nit kind of dodged the bullet does that\nmake sense cuz if if it if it had\naffected maybe the gray matter part of\nthe brain which we'll talk about in a\nsecond then you're kind of like so and\nthen it would have been detected so the\nfact that it did not get detected means\nthat that's a good prognostic\nsign oh but\nhe I think it was negligence that it\nwasn't detected okay he moves very\nstrangely so so so that's that's\nabsolutely a possibility but my point is\nthat like sure could be negligence but\nthe other thing is that the particular\ndamage of this perinatal infection was\non the less severe side which is why the\nferet did not get called oh yeah SEC\nsecond I think yeah I think that it it\nmade me wonder if it was just the chaos\nof what was going on in there\nlegitimately because it is when he's\naround any other fa it's very obvious so\nso there's there's all kinds of other\nthings that could go into that but just\nfrom like just purely a medical\nperspective forget about the\ncircumstances forget about things like\nthat so so cuz we see this sometimes\nwhere there's someone who has like you\nknow a really messed up brain and then\nbut the the whole thing is that even\nthough the brain is super messed up\nsomething about the pattern of damage\nis you know there it's kind of like you\nknow if I if I get shot by a gun a\ngunshot wound does not have the same\neffect depending on where it hits my\nbody so even though I sent you I sent\nyou a video just so you can see so you\ncan have the\ncontext because I can I totally\nunderstand where you're coming from from\nbut this is\nprofound so I don't know how to look at\na ferret brain but I definitely see so I\ncan walk you through the feret brain but\nthe the video if you see him oh yeah un\nbut I mean how do I show this hold on I\ngotta like he he does not move normally\nwhatsoever hold on a second and this is\nevery action that he makes and he's\nconstantly you know\nshaking this is the first time he ever\ntried to groom another fet by the way\nthat video that you just saw\nso the one that's white there that's\nMouse yeah Mouse has what is called uh\nwardenburg syndrome if you've heard of\nthat Wallenberg or Warden wardenburg\nI've heard of\nWallenberg it's very different yeah so\nthat you can see Henry's that head\nmovement that's that's the biggest thing\nis he does that all the time constantly\nit's very very obviously\nneurologic is this is this the\nsarabellum do you know what what part of\nthe white matter this is so if you want\nto look at this um I've sent you a tweet\nthere as well yeah I'm going to I'm\ngoing to try to pull it but but do you\nknow if that's the cerebellum because\nthis part of it was cerebella damage we\nthis look like cere damage we thought it\nwas we thought it was G to be cere\ncerebella hypoplasia first that was what\nwe believed going into it makes sense\nand it turned out to be this instead on\ntop of some kind of lesions on the\ncerebelum which we need to we need to\nfully review it with radiologist soon\nyeah but if you see do you see the the\nwhite on the top of the brain there yeah\nyeah that's allion let me let me just\npull this up so that people can see yeah\nthe official diagnosis from the\nveterinary was swiss cheese brain they\nwere like I've never seen anything like\nthis so This I mean so this is where the\nI I don't know what a f brain looks like\nbut this is generally the ballpark of\nthe cerebellum not this stuff over here\nbut this looks quite cerebella and the\nmain thing is that this kind of a taxia\nis look cbell like the the way that the\nthe way I describe it is that so the\nferad is trying to Target something but\nthe part of our brain\nthat manages that yeah like that the\npart of our brain that's like if I want\nto like point over here like my\ncerebellum is what lets me do that so\nit's basically like missing like when\nyou have cerebal damage it's like you\nhave an accuracy debuff where you can't\nlike hit things where you want them to\ngo and has like he's also got like\ncognitive issues where like he can\nchoose a thing and he does the thing and\nmost other faits will do like\nmultitasking they'll try to do different\nthings they'll try to like they have\nlike kind of a a forethought for it he\ndoes not there's there's definitely\nother factors in there so so the the the\nreally interesting thing so you're\nsaying that he's getting better right so\nhere's the cool thing so our brain has\nwhite matter and has gray matter uh gray\nmatter is generally speaking neuronal\ntissue so these are neurons and\ngenerally speaking we don't regenerate\nneurons but our white matter is things\nlike\nastrocytes um these are the supportive\ncells of the brain and the good news I\nmean I mean if it's scarring that's a\nthat's a different issue but generally\nspeaking white matter we can recover\nyeah it's full lesions unfortunately so\nI don't know if it will recover but\nseeing him perform new behaviors yeah is\nincredibly compelling so so that that's\nwhy there's there's like I I think it's\nit's consistent right so if this is like\na white matter leion like it's white\nmatter doesn't and if there's scars\nthat's a whole different ball game\nbecause scars are\nlike we can recover white matter if\nthere isn't stuff in the way but scars\nare like that prevent the white matter\nfrom\nregrowing I'm a neurologist there's\ngoing to be like a little bit of\nscarring in there and then a little bit\nthat can be recovered and I'm wondering\nif we're basically seeing the recovery\nof those pieces that can be over time\nbecause he's clearly forming new bonds\nnew new behaviors like that's not what I\nexpected I expected him to say the same\nI mean I I wouldn't expect the cerebella\ndamage to get completely back to normal\nbut there's two two different mechanisms\ngoing on one is that white matter can\nheal that's what we see in like multip\nsclerosis for example so that's like a\nwhite matter you get these white matter\nlesions and then when someone goes into\nremission from Ms like they're they\nrecover hopefully um second thing is uh\nthe brain can still adapt right so even\nin the case of like gray matter problems\nwhen someone has a stroke the brain will\nadapt and then you'll have like some\npart of the brain that takes over and\ndoes the lifting for something that a\ndifferent part of the brain used to do\nmakes sense yeah that's exactly what I\nthought because especially with the\nautonomic function area that had been\ndamaged because we we talked to I forget\nthe portion of the brain that was\nhandling that one that was confirmed\ndamage but basically it looks like it\nshifted somewhere else and they're just\nlike don't where something else is\nhandling it just like okay yeah I I it\nit that's what the brain does so the the\nhe's clearly still got a heartbeat you\nknow like that's kind of how it came\ndown to the coolest example of I mean I\ndon't know if this is cool but I I had a\num I can't remember the exact I I think\nyeah so I had a patient who had a an\namputation Bel uh below the\nknee and something I think there's I\ndon't remember the exact circumstances\nof the problem but they had an\namputation below the knee and then the\npart of their brain that was devoted to\nthat so basically we have a map in our\nbrain of our like physical body and so\nyou have certain regions of the brain\nthat will correlate with your face and\nyour feet and things like that so this\npatient when they had the below the knee\namputation so there's basically a part\nof their body missing sometimes this\nresults in things like Phantom limb\nwhere like you can feel the part of your\nyour body even though it's not there\nanymore um but this person they actually\nthe this part of their knee mapped on to\nthe part of their their brain that was\ndevoted to the clitoris mapped on to\ntheir knee um and so what started\nhappening is they they started they\ncould achieve orgasm by someone rubbing\ntheir stump and and it's just it's\namazing like it's crazy like what the\nbrain is capable of um and a lot of\npeople are like Wild Thing a lot of\npeople are like you know oh like that\nsounds epic but it's it's actually can\nbe quite debilitating because when you\nlook at a prosthetic like you know it's\nlike you're how do you walk yeah it's\nit's very challenging so it was it was a\nvery very difficult case but it's it's\nsuper interesting you can get all kinds\nof weird you know your brain gets\nconfused but yeah it's it's kind of\nfunny because I was I I didn't even mean\nto derail it all but I just wanted to\nshow that I thought You' be really\nintered and we just found out this last\nweek too it's only been like a week\nsince we found out about it and it's\nlike no one expected that everyone\nexpected like oh it's probably going to\nbe you know C cerebella hypoplasia\nthat's what we thought originally\nbecause it it it cats get that too um\nwhen the mama cat gets feline parvo very\ncommon and they call them wobble Cats\nonline that's usually what you see and\nferrets get the exact same outcome\nyou're like maybe it's that it's like no\nthis is way more wild than that looks\nlooks very Sarah Bal\num anyway going back to I I love The\nDetour like this is cool like it's like\nI haven't I haven't looked at an MRI in\nlike a\nyear I the last one I looked at was like\na human MRI but it you know I don't I\ndon't get a whole lot of opportunities\nto look at MRIs so it's nice to be able\nto you know dust off the cobwebs a\nlittle bit um I can send you some really\nWild Ones for this too like just massive\nlike all the files I think you'll really\ndig them and it's it's funny because\nit's you see the exact same types of\nbehavior in in you know humans depending\non the portion of the brain is damage\nyeah that that's I mean I'm not a vet\nright but that looks like cerebella\nproblems and that's the region of the\nbrain and and so it's it makes sense I\nknow more about animal medicine\nspecifically with ferrets than I do with\nhumans yeah so you know I think there's\nI there there's a lot that carries over\nright like we tend to have you know you\nmentioned inner ear stuff I was getting\nhopeful there that it was like an inner\near infection that's messing with your\nvestibular system so that's why the fair\nis always turning yeah I was like oh\nit's vestibular yeah and it's not\nbecause then if you deal with the\ninfection it can start turning right\nagain yeah yeah they usually recover at\nleast in ferrets they usually recover\nreally fast when it's vestibular so yeah\nI mean but it but still turning left is\nlike that's not consistent with\nvestibular usually that's like that\nsounds more like Heming neglect which\ndoes sound more\nneurologic and um I don't know if you\nall have seen like uh you know pictures\nof Hemi neglect and clocks but this is\nneuroscience I mean neurology is just\nfascinating\nyeah it's pretty wild to\nwatch so uh this is a great\nexample of what Hemi neglect looks like\nso it's like your brain can't see um I\ndon't know if I'm screen sharing this\nwith you but your brain can't you'll\nbasically make a whole clock face on\nlike half of it so this is what Heming\nneglect looks like so sometimes if we're\nall left it you know like if we can't\nturn right that's because our our brain\ncan't see so this is what the this this\nis what H how me\nneglect if you ask someone about what\nthey see like they won't be able to see\nhalf of the stuff and if you ask them to\ndraw a clock their brain only recognizes\nlike one half of the thing I think there\nwas a thing like this the um there was a\ncase where a guy had the two halves of\nhis brain were severed you remember that\nyeah and he he was able to like identify\nobjects differently based on which eye\nit was being seen in I have I have to\nlook into that study again it's wild\nyeah I we can I we can talk about it if\nyou want it's it's yeah no absolutely\nit's so basically what happens is our\nour eyes are like controlateral so my\nright eye actually see like the left\npart of the brain well it gets\ncomplicated depending on what the tracts\nlook like but um so like basically half\nof the visual field is anyway so I eyes\ncan be somewhat controlateral and the\nreally interesting thing is that\ndifferent parts of the brain have access\nto different qualities of information so\nwhen you get saving of the Corpus\ncolossum there are certain um and that's\nthe bond between the two halves the\nbrain it's the big highway there are\ncertain things I mean my neurolog is\nRusty but there are certain things that\nthe so the left eye which is connected\nto the right side of the brain will be\nable to perceive the for example the\nemotional impact of an object that you\nperceive I could be wrong on the details\nthere this is like I'd have to sit down\nand draw the tracks and stuff but so\nlike basically like if you ask someone\nwho has like this cerebella severing and\nyou ask them to close their right eye\nand they look at something with their\nleft eye they'll be able to tell like oh\nthis is like\nsomeone's uh this is someone's like\nfavorite stuffed animal they'll know\nthat part but if you ask them how many\nears does this bunny have they may not\nbe able to tell you and on the right\nside on the through the right eye which\nis connected to the left hemisphere of\nthe\nbrain they'll have the opposite so\nthey'll be like if if I ask you like\nokay like what is what what is this they\nmay not be able to name it but they'll\nbe able to tell you like oh it has like\nthis many eyes and this many ears it's\nthat hoppy it's that hoppy animal but\nthey like so it's it's all kinds of\nweird [ __ ] goes on in the brain with he\nand I'm Rusty on that stuff but it's\nsuper cool you basically have two two\ntypes of brain fighting each other yeah\nfigure out what it is they're looking\nat we just uh I I think we're about to\nrelease our trauma guide and what's\nreally fascinating about this is\ndissociation is basically\na signaling version of that so there's\nan anatomical severing but what we know\nin people who dissociate is that they\nhave like you know they're experiencing\nsomething so it's something called\nhemispheric lateralization where they're\nexper they're going through a really\nterrible experience but they feel no\nemotion and that's literally because\nwhat happens in their brain the the\nemotion is so overwhelming that it's\nalmost like you you know the blast doors\non like these like spaceships when like\nwhen you get hit by a torpedo and then\nyou're like venting vacuum in these\nsci-fi things and you like close the\nblast door like that's what the brain\ndoes so our brain is like there's way\ntoo much emotional fire over here we\nneed to protect our logical side of the\nbrain so they shut the blast doors and\nthey separate out like these two parts\nthe problem is that that part of the\nbrain is still active we're just we\nbecome numb to it and so then it starts\ndoing things like resulting in impulsive\nbehavior and leads to things like\naddictions and like all kinds of other\nproblems so it doesn't it doesn't shut\noff it's just we segregate the two\nhalves of our brain as like a survival\nmechanism and the subjective experience\nof that is dissociation so would you say\nthat the two halves are adversarial but\nin a positive way in a normal General\nway like normal General function because\nit seems like it's like an adversarial\nmodel where it learns from it's this no\nit's this no it's this but it's actually\nthis together and then they can agree I\ndon't I I wouldn't say it's adversarial\nlike so I I don't think basically any so\nare balanced mhm right but like I don't\nthink any part of the body or brain is\nadversarial within all of them have the\nsame goal right so we all evolve to have\nlike\nsurvival so there can be there can be\nconflict right and and that can happen\neven between like for example like our\nheart and our kidneys and our lungs and\nour kidneys and our heart and our lungs\nthere's all kinds of homeostatic\nmechanisms to where if one part of the\nbody is not doing what it's supposed to\nthe other part of the body will\ncompensate so I'd say they're more it's\nCo-op it it's not it's like PVE it's not\nlike\nPVP um makes sense yeah no see a lot of\nthe things we build things like that in\num kind of like programming adversarial\nmodel which is like you have one side\nthat works one way one side that works\nanother way and it's competition between\nthe two to make the whole thing more\nefficient and find a better sort of\ndescription for what it's see if that\nmakes sense so that's why I was\nwondering if it worked the same if it\nwas similar in any way in that way yeah\nI mean I I wouldn't use the word\nadversarial but there're AB abolutely\nlike balancing mechanisms and there are\ndifferent parts of the brain that will\nin a sense compete with each other so\nreally good example of this is the\nthalamus so the thalamus is sort of our\nsensory processing center for the brain\nso what happens is like we constantly\nhave input from our eyes ears\nnose and then like what gets floated to\nyour attention so the the phalus\nintegrates but I don't think that the\neyes and the ear well I mean some cases\nYou could argue they're competing but\nnot really right so so there's but\nthings it's like a friendly yeah so it's\nlike okay the Thal it's this yes all\nparts of the body and the all of our\nsensory organs are inputting things into\nthe thalamus and then the thalamus is\nbasically deciding for us like what\nfloats to the\ntop but I I don't think that our you\nknow our eyes are like competing against\nour ears like the the the signals need\nto be balanced but I I don't think it's\nlike a competition where one wins and\none loses\nsense in fact when you have that that's\nwhen you end up with illness so there\nare cases where if we look at things\nlike um chronic pain so chronic pain is\nwhen there is a part of our brain that\nis amplifying its signal and ignores\neverybody else so when it goes PVP we\nend up in chronic pain where it's\ndemanding your attention constantly yeah\nthat makes sense would you say are there\nany similarities between that and\nrestless leg syndrome as interesting as\nthat\nis\num my first answer is not\nreally my second answer is that I am\nalmost sure that my first answer is\nwrong so I was reading some interesting\nstudies about it actually so if you if\nyou don't have anything then do you what\nwhat do you mean oh no I'm interested in\nuh here anyway continue so so here's\nwhat I would say so like we we have an\nunderstanding of the pathophysiology of\nrestless leg okay okay so it's like a\nrestless leg is somewhat\nidiopathic at the same time I'm sure\nthat that pathopysiology is incorrect so\nthe the right answer so we know that\nrestless leg has a lot to do with the\ndopam energic\ntransmission and um so we we we use\nmedications like rinol and other kinds\nof like dopaminergic agents because that\nseems to fix the problem mhm but there's\nno doubt in my mind that that is an\nincomplete understanding and I have not\nkept up to date I mean the last time I\ngot fresh on restless leg was like\nliterally probably N9 years ago so the\nlast time I I really treated a patient\nwho had bad restless leg was like I can\nthink of the patient it was like nine\nyears\nago um why do you ask about the research\naround restless leg we can try to figure\nit out there was something was really\ninteresting to me was the like you said\ndo energic the the interesting thing was\nlike levels of dopamine that were\nactually being uptaken and being\nutilized and restless leg syndrome and\none of the things that I thought was\nreally interesting was Shay used to have\nuh wrestle sake syndrome all the time\nused to complain about it constantly who\nand Shay so Shay runs the the ferret\nrescue with me okay U makes makes art\nwith me does all this kind of stuff and\nsomething that they found that was\nreally interesting because they were\nlooking into literature for this was\nthey found that um melatonin at one\npoint had been correlated with uced\ndopamine uptake they sto taking\nmelatonin they stop having wrestless s\nsyndrome which was really interesting\nand I was wondering if you knew anything\nabout that kind of\nsubject um so I I I I mean I can look\nsome stuff up right now I think that\nthat is consistent so not that I know\nthis stuff but here's the mechanism of\naction that I would think so melatonin\nhelps us sleep generally speaking\ndopamine dopamine is an\nactivating neurotransmitter so dopamine\ndoes all kinds of stuff right so it also\ndoes like pic movement and it's\nimplicated in Parkinson and movement\ndisorders and stuff so but if if we like\nlook at it like on a very very high\nlevel like abstract not entirely\nscientific but just clinical\nunderstanding so if we have dopamine\nthat's too high we will become psychotic\nso we'll like perceive things like we'll\nhallucinate we'll become angry we'll\nfeel attacked so what what so we use\nanti Psy anti psychotic medication is\ndopamine energic blockade mhm so if you\nkind of think about it like dopamine in\nthat way is like an activating\nneurotransmitter and it doesn't surpr I\ndid not know this but it does not\nsurprise me at all that melatonin or\nother things that are correlated with\nthe induction of sleep will slow down\nthe activity of our dopamine yeah I\nactually I sent you a a pub there check\nit out um so what what I would venture\nis that melatonin it makes sense that\nmelatonin does oh whoops hold on\nmelatonin oh sorry sorry sorry I left\nthe call oh um by accident I clicked the\nwrong thing hold\non oh god I've been\ndeleted GG hold on this should work\nDiscord let's go\nto this and then let's go to this and\nlet's get your back where your back okay\num you sent me a pub Med let's take a\nlook I can't believe Dr K works for big\nmelatonin um tried to get rid of\nme\nso so before I I take a look at this I I\nthink this is the you know the way that\nI would understand is dopamine is\ngenerally speaking activating so it\nmakes sense that melatonin production\nwould suppress dopamine\nsignaling yeah um so that makes sense\nand then you know we use dopam energic\nagents to help\nwith\nsleep not not we use dope energic agents\nto help with Restless lag we don't use\ndop energic agents to put people to\nsleep yeah no I mean um sorry we use\nmelatonin as a sleep a right I found it\nto be kind of interesting because I'm\nwondering with things like that it's\nalways really interesting because it's\nseen as like super safe right seen as\nlike the safest sleep aid you could have\nand then we started finding these\narticles quite interesting dude this is\nthis is literally exactly what I was\nhypothesizing that's exactly why I sent\nit to you\nright this would this would make sense\num so in Parkinson's patients melatonin\nMay on the one hand exacerbate symptoms\nso this makes sense so Parkinson's is a\nMel is a dopamine deficiency melatonin\nand dopamine are inversely correlated\nright because when we want to go to\nsleep we want to lower our\nour uh dopamine levels so that this\nmakes\nsense um melatonin oh this is\ninteresting so melatonin being an\neffective treatment for [ __ ] of\ndiscinesia is is very interesting\nbecause [ __ ] of discinesia is caused by\nprolonged dopaminergic\nblockade so\num and and that's not that surprising so\nthat that's kind of why I say like if\nyou really look at it like unfortunately\nthe body is not it's not like one to one\nthere's all kinds of various\ncompensatory mechanisms\nso I would predict the Melatonin being\nproblematic for for Parkinson's but\nthere's something weird going on with\n[ __ ] of\ndiscinesia um but then there's also\nreasons why that could make sense too\nbecause [ __ ] of discinesia is actually\nan adaptation to prolonged dopaminergic\nstuff and I mean we can really get into\nthat if you want to but drugs is what it\nlooks like yeah so [ __ ] of discinesia is\ncaused by the lifetime exposure to\ndopaminergic\nblockade makes sense and so then what\nhappens is [ __ ] of disc IIA May in and\nof itself be a adaptation to Chronic\ndopamine\nblockade and so then actually here's the\nmechanism so if I if my brain is so this\nis probably it I I mean we don't know\nbut so [ __ ] of discinesia is my brain's\nadaptation to a lack of\ndopamine\nso I don't need the adaptation if I no\nlonger have a block of dopamine\nor if some something else is blocking\nthe dopamine for me I no longer need to\nadapt that's actually the\nmechanism so [ __ ] of discinesia happens\nwhen we have dopamine blockade and if\nMel melatonin comes in then our brain is\nlike we don't need the [ __ ] of\ndiscinesia anymore because the Melatonin\nis doing the job for us I don't know if\nanyone on in chat is following this but\nlike that would be my hypothesize\nmechanism who the [ __ ] knows if that's\nactually what it is but it's almost like\nthe Melatonin is doing the job of the\n[ __ ] of dises\nand anytime our our body gets something\nthat does the job for us it shuts down\nthose\nmechanisms that that would be I would\nthink I'm a Chad that's that would be\nlike a Dr K Chad moment this exactly why\nI brought this to you because like there\nthere are things that I get to see in\nanimal medicine that I get to research\nall the time things that I get to see in\nanecdotal evidence and being able to\npass it by somebody who knows this much\nbetter than me is is way helpful because\nI'm like look at this does this make\nsense you know I do that all the time in\nfor veterinary medicine when we're\ntrying to come up with a way to handle\nthat you know like trying to handle\nanything that's going on with the ferret\nsuper super Comon this is this is a\nsuper super super cool paper though yeah\nvery very interesting it it turns out\nthat I keep a list of these I I I could\nbe wrong though because they say that\nthere's something about the antioxidant\nnature of melatonin so I didn't I think\nabout I missed that one that was anyway\nthis is super interesting though but\nyeah no thanks you're talking about that\nyeah no I I mean I I I love talking\nabout I mean I like medicine medicine is\ngreat A lot of fun um just circling back\nso I I feel like I there was one other\nthing that I wanted to share with you I\nI know we're kind of off track um fine\nbut just to kind of t ldr for people so\nearlier we were talking about like drive\nand burnout and we were also talking\nabout this kind of like this third space\nwhere your drives come from so a couple\nthingsa self Atman whatever\num so I think that like the part of the\nreason that this stuff is easily\naccessible for you so one of the the\nexplanation from the Eastern system I'm\nnot saying this is correct but the way\nthat they would explain that is that\nyou've done some amount of spiritual\npractice in a past\nlife that being said we don't know if\nthat's real or not um there's also some\nreally interesting uh biological\nmechanisms of that which have to do with\nlike epigenetic memory and things like\nthat that like we can basically inherit\nmemories from our ancestors so the\nconcept of memory or learnings that come\nfrom Beyond your life that's\nscientifically fact instinct is a really\ngreat example of that like that's like\nlearning that comes from before you were\nborn so there are sources of\ntransmission of information and\ncompetence that can happen before you\nwere born it's really interesting but I\nfind it to be interesting too because\nit's like you you can't just have an\nanimal always act you know similar to\nthe other animals like itself even in\nisolation where they've never had any\ntype of environmental factors where\nthey've they've learned from others of\ntheir kind and they're still acting you\nknow in the same\nway you can't have an so are you saying\nthat some animals so like as as funny as\nthis say you take a ferret you never\nshow it to another feret they're still\ngoing to do War dances they're still\ngoing to do all their behaviors they\ndigging behaviors all those types of\nthings an instinctual drive to do those\nand yeah outside ofation where does that\ncome from didn't come from socialization\nthey didn't learn it from humans there\nhas to be something that carries over\nyeah yeah so so that that's that's a\npretty well-known scientific fact yep so\nthe the couple of things that you know I\nwant people to kind of like take away is\nfirst is that I think if we look at your\nthought process we see that there are\nvery few egotistical oriented statements\nwe also see that the inflection point\nthat you\ndescribe is actually very consistent\nwith this idea of abandonment of the ego\nnow I think inflection point is a really\ngood word because the other really\nimportant thing to understand is that\nthe more that you think in an\negotistical way literally the number of\nthoughts that you have that are ego\nrelated will strengthen your ego and the\nnumber the less you think in an\negotistical I am bad I am good I am a\nbadass I am grandiose I am this I am\nthat the fewer thoughts you have like\nthat the less egotistical you will\nbecome so we we know that like literally\nif you take like a thousand thoughts\nthat you have the percentage of them\nthat are ego oriented with an eye\ninvolved will correlate with like a\nstronger ego in in a bad way and and\nthat's just because neurons that your\nneurons will habituate so like you you\nwill have patterns of\nthinking absolutely and if you notice\nthis if you like know people who are\nlike very habitual thinkers like you can\ntrigger people um who who will you know\ngo on their tie raid like you know I\nhave family members that will go on\ntheir tie raade about like so I have a\nfamily member who thinks that the\nyounger generation is losing touch with\nwhatever the hell and so that like all\nyou have to do is like you it's like you\nactivate like Boomer rant. exe and then\nlike the what you'll notice is that the\nwhat they say is like it's like it can\nbe scripted literally they can repeat it\nover and over and over again and it's\nnot that it's right or wrong it's just\nthat once the script activates it'll\ncontinue to activate it's never going to\nstop yeah and and the script of the ego\nis something you have to be very careful\nabout and so literally I think that the\nreally cool thing that you're doing\nwhich I think correlates a lot with the\nsuccess of your community Thor is that\nyou are training people to think in a\nnon- egotistical way right setbacks are\nsetbacks there are opportunities to\nlearn there's some stuff about growth\nmindset and Carol DW's work in there the\nlast thing that I want to talk to you\nabout is so a lot of people may be\nwondering okay how do I get rid of ego\nhow how do I get access to that third\nspace so a couple of weird things about\nthat third space the first is that some\npeople believe that all knowledge comes\nfrom there I happen to be one of those\npeople so it's kind of weird but like\ncuz we notice that the conclusion\nhappens first and then logic and emotion\nhappens afterward there's this kind of\nbelief that all knowledge exists in that\nthird space that you have access\nto so this is not part of you this is\nwhy we use the word transcendental and\nnow we've left science complet behind\nokay or I mean there's some scientific\narguments that can be made but they're\nnot I don't think they're anywhere near\nconvincing enough it's like you can kind\nof you can mver it together and it may\nbe correct but we're far from any kind\nof scientific proof of what we're\ntalking about now MH so all all\nknowledge exists in this kind of divine\nCollective Consciousness weird thing and\nwhen we tap into that is when we get\nthese right answers so the less ego we\nhave the the easier it is to tap into\nthat and the really interesting thing is\nthat the text that I happen to read the\nnight that our stream got flubbed was\ntalking about particular techniques to\ndirectly tap into that so this text is\nspecifically about there's many\ncomplicated ways to tap into it you can\ndo yoga you can do pranam you can do\ndifferent kinds of meditation practices\nbut there are direct ways to get on like\ntap into it just directly without out\nall of these\nsteps and the essence of that is it's\ngoing to sound weird is in the in\nbetween\nspaces so if you pay attention to your\nexperience of Life what you will\nprobably discover what I've discovered\nwhat a lot of people I've worked with\nhave discovered is that you know you\nhave a thought and then you have a\nthought and you have a thought and then\nyou can also have an emotion you can\nhave an emotion you can have an emotion\nbut if you pay attention to your mind\nthere is a quiet space in between\nthoughts there is a quiet space in\nbetween\nemotions and that third space I would\nventure I would hypothesize for you Thor\nis accessed in those quiet spaces it is\nnot the result of logic it is between\nlogic and it is between emotion yep I\ncould see that no that makes complete\nsense to me actually so can you explain\nthat to us because I don't ever feel\nlike I'm pushing down my logic and\nemotion I'm not reing it in or telling\nit to step aside for a moment it's like\nthere's a breathe in and a breathe out\nthere's a moment where it's like okay\nit's this now logic em motion now it's\nthis now it's logic motion whatever it's\nit's taking turns but there's never any\ntype of a I need to force myself to do\nthis it just happens right so so it's\nit's funny the language that you used\nbecause that is actually the technique\nis to catch this the yeah it's cool this\nI like it's weird so to to so if you're\ntrying to look for the in between\nspace there are a couple things you can\ndo first is when we meditate generally\nspeaking our goal is to stop create a\ncessation of thoughts yep um and so if\nyou're if you have no thoughts and no\nemotions and you're just present if\nyou're in that thya state of\nconsciousness without mental activity\nyou're just focused this is kind of like\nflow flow is on the on the track to this\nplace um but flow still has mental\nactivity so at so what we try to do in\nmeditation is we widen the in between\nspace right so if we say thought nothing\nthought nothing thought nothing and if\nwe look at our suffering our suffering\ncorrelates with a very very tiny Gap so\nif you look at something like a panic\nattack the subjective experience of a\npanic attack is one thought leads to\nanother leads to another leads to\nanother there's no space in between them\nthere's no relief a thought Loop is also\nwhere going to cycle through these 15\nthoughts and we're going to cycle again\nwe're going to cycle again there's no\nGap meditation is the exact opposite we\nare trying to increase the gap between\nour thoughts and our emotions the really\ninteresting thing about what you\ndescribed is that the other formal way\nto practice this is to find the gap\nbetween inhalation and\nexhalation so breathing in and breathing\nout is a very natural thing where\nthere's directionality in one place\nthere's directionality in another place\nso you have to move through an\ninflection point every time you\nbreathe there is an inflection point\nbetween thought and thought number one\nand thought number two there's an\ninflection point between happiness and\nsadness there's an inflection point\nbetween breathing in and breathing out\nthere is an inflection point between\nbeing awake and falling asleep so in all\nof these inflection points it is in the\ninflection point that the magic happens\nand if anyone wants to free themselves\nfrom thought emotion ego and they want\nto follow your path Thor they need to\nsit in the in between\nspaces I think that's really hard for\nmost people to conceptualize that makes\nsense yes it is very hard for so so the\nthe the tradition that I'm drawing from\nis shamba Yoga which is a very very\nrigorous and difficult technique so it\nis like\nstraight onto the highway so it's hard\nto do but it is absolutely possible they\nalso describe it as a choiceless\nawareness so choice and this is where\nlike I don't know I think this will\nresonate to you as well like you don't\nreally make a choice the choice sort of\ngets made and you follow it yeah does\nthat make sense and like this is where I\ndon't think many people will understand\nthat but the more that you do this the\nmore\nthat it just becomes what it is there's\nno choice to be made there's no choice\nabout the ferret rescue it's just it is\nto be done it's happening it is\nhappening it is right it is it is it is\nperiod it's it's funny to because people\nwould be like how do you choose things\nhow do you choose to do things so fast I\nalways have to like wait on I was like\nit's already chosen yes yes I can tell\nso so I think sh shamba yoga is what\nyou're doing so I I don't even know you\nknow I don't need to do anything for you\nyou're doing it all right um you know if\nyou want more detail I we can go into\nmore detail at some point about\npractices and stuff like that like we're\nactually doing a uh something on the\nmembership side this month about\ndeveloping a meditation practice but\num yeah so I I think that like this\nchoiceless awareness I'm not surpris I\nthink it's it's very confusing for a lot\nof people like what do you mean I don't\nchoose no the choice yeah it's been\nconfusing for anybody that I've talked\nto yeah pretty much my whole life over\nlike people I me in real life people I\nknow online like it doesn't make any\nsense and they just like what like what\ndo you mean you just do things and it's\nlike I just do things you know yeah yeah\nI I get you so so the you know my\nexperience of it is that I oscillate\nbetween choosing things and choiceless\nawareness the more my ego activates the\nmore emotional I get the more that State\nof Mind happens then I feel paralyzed I\ndon't know what the right choice is the\nwhole point is like what's really cool\nabout this is like once you operate from\nThia there is no choice it just it's not\neven I I guess it's even the thing it's\nlike I'm not even it's not even that I\ndo things it's that things are happening\nyes that's a weird way to describe it\nbut that makes the most sense and and I\nknow it's hard for people to understand\nat the same time I think that every\nperson who is listening to this has\nexperienced what we are talking about\nthey had a moment in their life where\nthings became clear and then it was a\nhow do we make this happen as opposed to\nright choice wrong choice or it wasn't\nit wasn't about it being the right\nchoice or the wrong choice you abandon\nthe concept of right or wrong and you\njust do the thing you kind of know like\ndeep within you that this is like this\nis to be done you kind of know it feels\nright it kind of reminds me of what\nsometimes crisis situations when there's\na crisis situation you just do without\nthinking M you just do your brain goes\nit's not even your brain it's this needs\nto happen I'm doing this that crisis\nsituation feels it's not the same but it\nfeels similar in that way where it's\nthis is happening we're doing this and\nthe other parts of your brain go how do\nwe do it and then they figure out how to\ndo it and then you do it it's it's it's\na beautiful analogy the challenge is\nthat when some people enter crisis\nthere's two kinds of modes in crisis\nthat with ego and without ego so when\nyou are in a crisis and your ego is\nactive then it's the very opposite it is\nabsolute\ntorture because you're like what will\nhappen this will mean this and then this\nwill happen to me and then this will\nhappen to me and this will happen to me\nand then you spiral out of control you\nfeel overwhelmed and the crisis crushes\nyou the flip side is you're in a\nsituation like what what um Thor is\ndescribing where you remove the ego from\nthe equation right in the absence of ego\nthen suddenly you go into like you know\nChad mode where you're just like you're\ncrushing it and it needs to be done and\nyou don't think you don't worry about\nthe fact that it may not work out like\nit may not work out you just accept that\nand you have to act and this so an\ninteresting thing about that too\nactually that one I've had that many\nmany times in crisis situations\nespecially when you know there's like an\nemergency with the rescue or something\nlike that and it doesn't mean you don't\nhave emotions you just have them\nafterwards a lot of the times i' I've\nfound where it's like\nI need to put this one to the side\nbecause it's going to cause a problem\nright now and it's like I've decided you\nknow this this is what needs to happen\nwe figured out how to do this and if I\nbreak down right now none of this is\ngoing to work so it's like in this\ninstance I need to wait right this needs\nto wait whatever that is and I've I've\nI've had that happen a number of times\nyeah so that's very common in medicine\ntoo so when we're dealing with crisis\nsituations you know we we have a\nspecific process we tell everyone set\nyour emotions side from now for now and\nthen we'll do debriefs so we'll do uh\npostmortem debriefs and things like that\nlike like we have like we have time and\nspace to let that emotion come back into\nyour life which by the way is a very\nuseful technique to apply for normal\npeople which I don't think we do enough\nwe don't set aside space for our\nemotions in a particular formalized way\nwhich means that they have to like you\nknow it's like\nif I'm inviting my neighbors over for a\nChristmas party once a year they don't\nhave to show up randomly to see me like\nyou can set aside a time and space for\nsomething to happen and when you give\nthat space for that thing to happen it's\nbeautiful what your brain does so\nanother great example of this is\nsometimes like when I I I'm working with\npatients right as a psychiatrist doing\nPsychotherapy and stuff like\nthat I'll ask them like you know\nsometimes they'll notice something\nreally interesting which is that their\nlife is getting better but time they\ncome to therapy they feel worse and\nthey're like I don't understand like I\nfeel so bad like we're [ __ ] here\ncrying but like my life is fine and I'm\nlike yeah that's exactly how it works\nwhat you've learned how to do is you\nused to cry every single day and now\nyou've learned how to push it all aside\ncome here take out the trash and then\nlike your trash can is empty for the\nrest of the week and you pile up that\nyou come here and then you feel bad and\nthey're like\noh and I was like we can continue like\nif this and then the cool thing is even\nthat stops eventually like they they\nlike once they figure that out I don't\nteach them that they they have to figure\nout figure out human garbage collection\nyeah yeah that's that's what that's what\nwe are we're we're trash compactors you\nknow y um yeah I find that to be useful\nsometimes like it's it's definitely a\ntool kind of in that belt where\nunderstanding when it is healthy to move\nthat to the side to handle that crisis\nsituation but not to keep that\npermanently aside there's no that's not\ngood for you at all yep and I've had a\nnumber of situations like that we had\none um uh Vinnie one of the ferrets that\ncame in uh owner was like oh yeah he\nhasn't eaten in 2 days get there he's\nhalf the weight that a fair his age\nshould be uh the owner is very clearly\non meth so house reeks of it horrible um\nhad to file police report do all that\nkind of stuff and it was just Grim man\nlike it just really messed me up but it\nwas like in this moment these are the\nthings that need to happen animal has\nlike I have to put on the happy face be\nlike oh everything's okay get the animal\nfrom the person make sure that\neverything feels good call the police\nfile the police report put all the\nevidence in front of that get the animal\nhome like figured out what we're going\nto do start finding a way to make him so\nthat you if you have a person even any\nmammal actually that is uh not eaten in\na certain amount of time and you try to\ngive them a full meal they actually go\ninto shock and they die yeah it's a\nhorrible thing anding syndrome yeah\nrefeeding syndrome that's exactly what\nit is so we had to figure out exactly\nwhat levels of food can he eat over that\namount of time to prevent refeeding\nsyndrome because he would just like his\nvitals would crash you die so trying to\nfigure all that stuff out and then okay\neverything is handled let's go sit in\nthe car and need a pie and cry you\nknow yeah no I mean yeah I I I think\nit's it's it's a huge problem that I I\nthink people you know we we push the\nemotion to the side which I I agree with\nyou is healthy but then you've got to\npay that price you have to you have to\nyeah right you can't you can't Dodge\nyour karma like that debt needs to be\npaid and you need to feel that negative\nemotion yeah yeah and I I've gotten very\ngood I think at knowing when it's okay\nto push that you know it's like this is\nIt's Only in a very critical situation\nlike a really crit like something could\ndie there's no coming back from the\nfailure on this one you could fail sure\nyou might learn something from it but\nthere's something that will break that\ncannot be unbroken in those situations\nthat's like okay now it's time to push\nthis aside for a moment handle it you\nknow and like you said with medicine\nit's the same I I I would I would say I\nwould add one thing to that so I think\nthat\nthat's\nperfect um and I think that you can't\ndiscredit your ability to deal with it\nlater so the ability to set something\naside is way easier when your brain\nknows that we can deal with this later\nand it won't be\ncatastrophic a lot of problems that I\nsee with people are that they keep\nsetting it aside keep setting it aside\nkeep setting it aside and then they\ndon't know that they don't have\nconfidence that they can deal with it\nwhen they open that\nbasement door that's full of negativity\nright it can feel so incredibly\noverwhelming and and that can also\nbecome kind of a self-fulfilling\nprophecy because the more that you let\nthings pile up the more objectively\noverwhelming they are when you try to\ntackle them so then you feel overwhelmed\nand so then you let things pile up more\nbecause you can't deal with it and the\nreason you keep on letting it pile up is\nbecause you can't deal with it and the\nmore you let it pile up the more\nimpossible it becomes to deal with and\nso that's where like often times\nProfessional Health like with a medical\nprofessional can really go a long way\nlike so we're really good at helping\npeople deal with unsolvable things yeah\nI remember when I was when I was younger\nthat kind of felt like a pressure cooker\nyou know it's like it just keeps\nbuilding up building up building up and\nyou're like I don't even want to let\nsteam off that it could explode you I'm\njust going to leave it over there right\nand then you get another pressure cooker\nand another one then you're just it what\nwhat I didn't realize at the time is\nlike it's not just like you're putting\nsomething in a in a cabinet somewhere\nwalking away You're maintaining that\nthing there's energy that goes into\nkeeping that pressure cooker pressurized\nright every day you're like I'm just\ngoing to spend maybe I'm only spending\n5% maybe it's only 10% maybe it's 15%\nuntil you're just buried with this\nspinning plate maintenance that you have\ngoing on and then you don't know what to\ndo with the damn thing right and that's\nI I've felt that before in my life and I\nI basically got to a point where it was\nlike you have to let the pressure off\nand just sometimes sometimes that's\nawful sometimes it's horrible going\nthrough that but if you don't then\nyou're going to be maintaining that and\npaying taxes on it all the time\nabsolutely it's debilitating so one of\nthe three biggest willpower\ndrains is emotional suppression so the\nmore emotions that you're constantly\nconstantly constantly suppressing like\nit's amazing how people don't realize so\npeople will like look for motivation\nthey'll look for Drive they'll look for\npassion they'll look for like discipline\nand and literally like all you need to\ndo is is unburden yourself of all of\nyour emotional suppression because just\njust the maintenance it's like your\ninventory is full and then you can't\nloot anything like you can't you're like\nhow do I pick up this nice epic piece of\nloot you can't because everything is\nfull so so maybe that's not the best\nanalogy but like there's a man there's a\nman of maintenance cost huh it's like\nendless dailies so you don't get to raid\nsure yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah same kind\nof thing yeah you're just you're just\ngrinding for the same old crap and not\nreally making progress and and you just\nhave to unburden your\nmind yeah know it makes sense it's I\nthink that's the scariest thing too is\nthat moment when you realize like oh\nit's coming out and there's nothing I\ncould do about it now and like that's\nthat's a scary thing especially if you\nhaven't practiced that you know you\nhaven't gotten used to feeling those\ntypes of emotions or even the fear of\nallowing yourself to feel that way or\nlooking vulnerable to others not\nrealizing that that's okay\nand even then the the idea that maybe\nyou do make yourself vulnerable to\nsomebody else and you do let those\nemotions out and they reject it you know\nthere's so many there's so many fears\nthat go along with that and I could\ntotally get that and yeah that's just\nlike everybody else I went through the\nsame things throughout my life like I've\ngone through the exact same things and\nI've just kind of learned that it's okay\nright it's it's okay to just be like I'm\njust gonna I'm gonna have a [ __ ] time\nfor a minute you know yeah that's fine\nno I I think that even the language of\ngoing through something so I I think so\nmany people get stuck because they avoid\ngoing through something they try to\nprevent it they try to avoid it they try\nto keep it from hurting they try to\npractice in secret or solve all their\nproblems so that they don't have to go\nthrough\nit you know I'll see this a lot with\n[Music]\num you know people who like just move\nfrom one relationship to another and\njust can't tolerate like being on their\nown for some amount of time and like\nsometimes you just have to go through it\nbut the the whole point of going through\nit is you end up on the other side but\nyou can't end up on the other side until\nyou go through it yeah I think the the\none thing the one caveat to that is I\nfound you have to avoid circular\nthinking in that where it's like this is\nbad so everything's going to be bad\nbecause this is bad so everything's bad\nthe moment you start feeling those\nemotions it's really easy to be like\neverything is awful and it's like no you\ncan feel these so that later you don't\nhave to feel them in the s same way or\nthey don't have to Define who you are\nyou don't have to spend the maintenance\non that anymore you can be different\nafterwards and that's okay you know like\nthat that was something I had to work\nthrough as well was like realizing like\nthat's it doesn't Define who you are as\na person you know yeah so I think\nthere's there's a very\nimportant thing there about see when we\nexperience negative emotion what really\nscrews us is the identity based\ninclusions that come from a temporary\nelevated emotion y so like when we feel\na lot of negative emotion we can form a\nconclusion and then the problem is that\nconclusion stays with us even when the\nemotion goes\naway so that's where like you know and I\nI I think I think you're you're speaking\nto you maybe used to do that more and\nnow you do it less you recognize that\neven if you have negative thoughts in\nthis moment those negative thoughts are\nnot necessarily true for all time they\ndon't make a determination about\nyou yeah that doesn't hit me like that\nat all anymore uh I think when I was\nmuch younger it was like yeah I mean I\nthink everybody has those thoughts\ngrowing up though it's like oh no they\ndon't like me my whole life is over you\nknow like I got an F my whole life is\nover it's like I I think as you get\nolder you realize very quickly you're\nlike maybe that permanent record really\nwasn't that big of a deal\nyeah like maybe I'll still be a person\nafterwards and it doesn't really Define\nme you know I I I so so yeah I I I love\nthat phrase permanent record because\nlike we get terrified I remember being\nterrified too of stuff going on my\npermanent record but I I don't think\nanyone reads the permanent record like\nno one reads the permanent record at at\nschool like I don't know I don't know on\nyour permanent record it's like you know\nit's like it's like when you apply to\nUniversity like I thought they were they\nwere going to send my permanent record\nbut you literally just request\ntranscripts\nyep\nthat's transmission the the school is\ntoo dysfunctional and the university\ndoesn't have the administrative\nbandwidth to look at everyone's\npermanent record or you know it's like\nit's weird I mean sometimes you can get\nstuff like in med school and things like\nthat you've got certain you know yes or\nno questions and jobs where they ask you\nlike have you ever broken a law or\nwhatever but yeah I I I think it's like\none of the biggest skills and I think\nit's a skill that has to be learned so\nthe other challenge is that people can\nlook at you and they can say oh like I\nwish I was like Thor but you're you're a\nfinished product you're not or somewhat\nfinished you're version 2.0 let's say\nrelease right and and that's a skill the\nability to separate tease apart I am\nfeeling this way now versus this is like\nan ego based conclusion that I carry\nwith me is like that's huge so just feel\nthe negativity and don't and wait 24\nhours to form conclusions about yourself\nthat's what I would like strongly\nrecommend yeah I mean to be rud with you\nI don't even I don't even see it as like\nfull release or anything like that like\nI'm G to be learning stuff the rest of\nmy life and that's a pretty cool place\nto be like like quite frankly it's it's\nneat and uh the way that I generally see\nit is me as a person gets to learn who\nme as a person is over the rest of my\nlife and that means I get to learn about\nthe things that I'm good at learn about\nthe things that I'm bad at learn about\nthings that I can improve learn about\nthings that you know maybe I don't want\nto do and I get to be long for that ride\nthat's a pretty cool story man and I\ndon't even know what it is yet so I get\nto read it the whole time that's that's\nhow I've always felt about this stuff\nfor a long time and it's it's neat\nbecause it's like a it's all discovery\nthe whole thing is Discovery you\nknow yeah I really enjoy that yeah I I I\nI'd strongly encourage you Thor to spend\nsome time in the in between spaces\nbecause I I think that's where some of\nthe coolest Discovery happens oh yeah no\nI can I totally understand that it's\nfunny when you're the way that you're\ndescribing that is um something I like\nto do quite a lot is just kind\nof take away any type of tasks that I\nhave take away any type of um social\nobligation or technology or anything\nthat's in the way I just kind of let\nmyself think about stuff and I find that\nthat's kind of rare in today there's too\nmuch Doom scrolling and like I have to\nstay on social media and I have to I\nhave to do all these things like ah and\nthen you you do that and see you pass\nout and you wake up with your phone\nstuck to your face you know like just\ngiving yourself even just 20 minutes\nminutes a day to just stare into the\nmiddle distance and figure out who you\nare is crazy beneficial I completely\nagree so I I I think we we see that it's\ninteresting you bring up technology\nbecause technology is destroying our in\nbetween spaces completely agree with\nthat it is is taking away more than\nanything else it is taking away our time\nwith ourselves yeah so what I really\nlove doing and like one of my best\nproductivity hacks is pacing like not\nlistening to music not listening to a\npodcast past just pacing when I don't\nfeel like working I get up and pace and\nthen often times when I'm done pacing\nI'm ready to\nwork and it's kind of it's kind of funny\nbecause I think there's a number of\npeople that do that in video games as\nodd as that is like run around in a\ncircle in Delan they're not really doing\nanything they're just kind of like\nrunning around in a circle in Delan\ndoing nothing right not thinking about\nanything not that's a common thing yeah\npacing in games is a very common thing\nhow how many of you guys ran around in a\ncircle in Dallas or ogore or Stormwind\njust there the city is huge though they\njust pay run a\ncircle nope they're not even waiting for\na raid they're not waiting for anything\nit's just like I'm just going to run\naround in a circle there's a lot of\npeople that do this it's very common\nBehavior I've done it too I've never\ndone that it's it's it you'd be really\nsurprised look how many people have done\nit it's really all of chat is saying\nthat they do it yeah so what's going\nthrough your head are you like nothing\nsometimes nothing wow you're just kind\nof gone and you're just like I'm just\ngoing to run in a circle for a little\nbit sometimes you'll be talking to\nsomeone sometimes there's just nothing\ngoing on some people just like doing\nthat sometimes and I think that is sort\nof that in between space where\ntechnology is still involved but you\nreally only see that a lot of the times\nin multiplayer games that have downtime\nareas which are areas that are intended\nto be when you're not doing anything\nlike sitting in town it's kind of\ninteresting that's that's so\nwild yeah wild therapy exactly GTA 5\nyeah people are talking about the same\nthing yeah GTA 5 I can kind of\nunderstand GTA 5 is is a game that I\nfeel like you can just absorb the\nAmbiance of the game yeah pregame\nOverWatch that's another good example\nit's just that jumping back and forth\nleft to right that walking in a circle\nin the in that area it's where there's\nyeah it's areas where there is no\nobjective and you are you are not\ncurrently tasked with doing anything and\nyou just kind of turn off\nfor a little action yeah\ncool well th any last uh thoughts or\nquestions I mean I know we've covered a\nlot of ground today and you know couple\ndays\nago no I think this is awesome man and I\nI always have a blast coming and talking\nto you honly yeah it's super nice yeah I\nI I think it's I really enjoy talking to\nyou I think it's like really interesting\nto hear\nyour it feels to me like you've attained\na very high rank without following a\nmeta that I've been religiously\nfollowing so I'm I'm so and and like\nthat's what's cool about this is like I\ndon't think you need to learn this you\ncan Discover\nit so I really like listening to your\nexperience of stuff I think your impact\non the community is hugely beneficial\nand it's so interesting to look at what\nyou do through the lens of what I've\nlearned because I see a lot of these\nmechanisms of even the way that you talk\nto your community I'm not surprised at\nall that people in your community do\nincredibly well because I think you\nwhether you realize it or not you're\nbasically dissolving their ego for them\nright I didn't realize that was what was\ngoing on yeah that's the biggest effect\nyeah that I mean I don't know if it's\nthe biggest but like that's what I see\nright so even the ability to fail is ego\noriented reframing the way that you look\nat things to remove ego and I think\nthat's why people see this explosion of\nlike progress because once the ego gets\nthe [ __ ] out of the way like I want you\nall to just think about this for a\nsecond\nwhen you're living your life you often\ntimes know what the right thing to do is\nyou know that you're smart enough you\nknow that you need to do these sequence\nof steps but something within you holds\nyou\nback and we think it's willpower we\nthink it's a lack of discipline we think\nwhatever but no if you really pay\nattention it is going to be your\nperception of yourself what will people\nthink it'll hurt if I fail it it'll be\nyou telling yourself not to proceed\nbecause of\nXYZ and if you really look at it okay\nwhat what is the negative consequence\nthat you're you're worried about your\nmind doesn't think about it logically\nbecause it doesn't think oh like this is\na game Jam it's not like this goes on my\npermanent record right like the thought\nis absurd but your logic does not\nfunction properly there is some kind of\nfear or avoidance of\nemotion which by the way the ego and\nnegative emotion get are very tied hand\nin hand right so like like just the more\nyou remove yourself from the equation\nbecause what's holding you back it's\nyou remove yourself from the equation\nand you'll start to fly you're really\nwhat's weighing you\ndown and it's it's like amazing how\nyou've learned that for yourself\ninternalized it applied it and now you\nteach it to other people which I think\nis super\ncool well thank you and I I think I\nthink the thing that I really enjoy\nabout it is like I said before like\npuzzles and sometimes person's biggest\npuzzle is them you know and I think it's\nalmost always them it's always them so\nthey when someone brings me a puzzle\nlike that the um the best thing that I\ntry to do for that is to see how does\nthis person feel in this situation\nbecause you can't really tell someone\nlike you should feel this way but you\ncan be like try to understand how they\nfeel in the position that they're in\nwith the understanding they have the\nmore information that I receive about\nthe person the more that I can\nunderstand like how they feel why they\nfeel that that way the things they're\nworking with the easier it is to sort of\nform that that mental image of who they\nare and then it's like well how would I\nbreak out of that if I was in that\nposition and then try to hand them that\nyou know and be like this might work you\nknow yeah so I I I think that there\nthere's a there's a subtle really\nimportant thing in that answer which is\nthat see when when someone loses\nconfidence in themselves they have all\nthese beliefs right and then I think the\nkey thing is that a lot of the default\nthinking is like oh this person is wrong\nso I see that a lot when I'm working\nwith people who are suicidal who are\nlike you know I have no reason to live\nand the right answer isn't hey here all\nthe reasons you should live that's\ninvalidating also doesn't help you\nunderstand their situation yep the the\nright answer is to add more to the\nequation right it's not to try to remove\nthe negative necessarily like that can\nbe done definitely that's important over\ntime we want to do that but the first\nthing to do is like add more information\nand when when I see that a lot of people\nare like Oh I'm a loser because of XYZ\nright and it you can't change your past\nbut you can add additional experiences\nto your life that will change what's on\nthe right side of the equal sign yep and\nand the real tragedy is that when we\nfeel like we're losers we stop adding\nmore experience oh I had this one\nterrible relationship and now I'm going\nto be alone for the rest of my life\nbecause you won't have other\nrelationships and that's what's so\nparalyzing about it is that the very\nthing that will solve the problem is\nlike doing the the thing that you don't\nwant to do is exactly what you need to\ndo to fix the problem yep it's funny\nbecause I drill that down as like a\nsingle phrase a lot of the times it\ndoesn't always apply but when it does\nit's I think it's quite funny is someone\nwould be like Oh I'm a I'm a not a good\nartist not a good artist I'm never going\nto be a good artist I was like no you're\nnot a good artist yet yeah and that's\nthat single word reframes the whole\nthing absolutely it's like oh wait a\nminute okay yeah I'm I'm with you it's\nnot about convincing someone no you\nactually like you are like you're such a\ngreat artist oh my guy AR is great and\nit's like they'll just be like no I'm\nnot like you're now you're lying to me\nnow I don't trust anything you say\nabsolutely no your artist your art sucks\nright now but you're not a great artist\nyet it's fine it's it's wild but this\nreminds me of a sociopath that I once\nworked with who was like you know and\nthey were like you know I'm a sociopath\nand I was like yeah I was like what are\nyou going to do about\nit right I'm not going to convince\notherwise like yes that is correct but\nwhat does that mean about your future it\nisn't deterministic and some of the the\nbest people that I know are sociopaths\nthey like they make a very conscious\nnon-emotional decision that like I'm\ngoing to live a good life and I'm going\nto be add value to the people around me\nand I'm going to that is the way that I\nwant to live so just just because you\nare something today doesn't mean that\nyou have to be that thing tomorrow it is\nthe nature of Life forget about humans\nlife to adapt to grow to survive to\nimprove that's what life does that's\nwhat separates it from\nnon-life all right are you streaming\nbecause I'll I'll raid you I am not okay\nif You' like
