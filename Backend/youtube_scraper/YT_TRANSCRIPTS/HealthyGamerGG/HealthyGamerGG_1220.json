    "transcript": "hey friends dr k here a lot of people\nwho watch our content\nare looking to find their dharma or life\npurpose\nit's a real challenge because a lot of\ntimes mental health problems like\ndepression and anxiety\nare actually symptoms of lacking a good\nmeaning or a good purpose in life\nthis is something that people work on a\nlot in group coaching to find their\ndharma or to find their life purpose\nif you're interested in that we still\nhave spots open it's 24\na session and sign up with the link in\nthe description below\nhi dr k i'm a university student and i'm\ndoing well\ngood for you i wrote an academic\ntextbook wow\npublished scientific papers presented in\nsymposiums\ndoing well in my studies etc but i\nrecently got into an mba\nand started focusing on other things\nthat are more into the nba studies\nand stuff and i don't think i enjoy this\ni have some amazing mentors in my\ndepartment as well they know me well and\nthey have helped me much\ni'm always doing my best to make them\nproud and not just them of course my\nfamily as well\ni do my best and work hard and that\npride they have for me brings me\nhappiness i'd say\nby the way none of them is strict or\nanything like that they're all super\nchill\nthanks for including that detail but\nsomeone's been paying attention\nto how we would interpret that earlier\nsentence\nso they've see this is fantastic like so\nthey're they're starting to understand\nlike\noh maybe you know maybe your parents are\nhard on you but\ni believe that recently i've been doing\nsome things that don't make me happy at\nall and\nincrease my suffering making me want to\njust stop and give up\none of these things is the mba which i\ndislike greatly\ninstead i like to do other stuff with\nthe knowledge that i have like start\nsomething online to help people and add\nvalue to them\ni'm just doing all these things to make\npeople proud try to show them\nthat i like this do my best for them but\nnot for me\ni'm not sure if this is the main problem\nif there's something behind that\nor how i should think this through and\nof course i don't feel like talking to\nmy mentors about this i just don't want\nthem to think that i'm not good enough\nfor their mentoring\nit's just that it's a bit confusing in\nmy mind even while writing this to be\nhonest i'm not sure if you'll\nanswer or even see this but i guess i\ncan take my chances by posting\nthis here good job and taking a chance\nand it's just that i'm trying to find\nanswers on what i should do next thanks\nfor your time\nlots of respect for what you do and for\nyour community great\nps sorry for the long message okay so\nthis is a this is a very good um\ngreat question okay so let's kind of go\nthrough some of the components so\nsometimes\nwe're like productive right like so\nwe're good so this person published an\nacademic textbook was like you know\npresenting in symposiums\nseems like they were having fun and then\nthey ended up\nlike you know getting an mba or getting\ninto an mba program and so they find\nthemselves in the mba program and\nthey're like i'm not really enjoying\nthis very much\nnot quite sure what to do i have a lot\nof mentors my family supports me i enjoy\nmaking them proud but sometimes i want\nto give up i'm kind of confused about\nwhat i want to do\nso i guess this is a common question of\nlike you know sometimes like we'll do\nwell in undergrad\nand we're like really doing a good job\nand we're happy with ourselves we're\nmaking people happy\nand then we will enter graduate school\nand things seem a little bit different\nthere\nand so what's going on there sometimes\nwe feel like dropping out of graduate\nschool should we or should we not\nit's a great question so let's kind of\nunpack things one step at a time\nso the first thing is that there are a\ncouple of\na couple of ways to look at it the first\nis that you know what is it that you\ndislike\nso mba is masters in business business\nadministration\num so\nthe first question is like you know\nbut i believe that recently i've been\ndoing some things that don't make me\nhappy at all and increase my suffering\nso then the question is like what is\nthat right so what is it that you\ndislike about your program and\nthings that are making you unhappy so i\nthink that that's an important question\nto ask\nthis person also has like some confusing\nfeelings like they say\num i'm not sure if this is the main\nproblem or if there's something behind\nthat\nand of course i don't feel like talking\nto my mentors about this i just don't\nwant them to think that i'm\nnot good enough for their mentoring and\nthe person even says that they're not\neven like\npeople like that they wouldn't judge me\nthat way but i i feel that way\nso i think there are a couple of\ndifferent things to dig into first is is\nyou know why\nyou don't want to talk to your mentors\nlike what is that feeling that's keeping\nyou from reaching out to them\nsecond thing is like what is it that you\ndislike about getting the mba\nyou know why was it sounds like you were\nhaving fun earlier and you're not having\nfun now\nand as far as what to so i think some\namount of self-reflection and\nexploration is\ndefinitely a good idea you can certainly\ntalk to your mentors you can certainly\ntalk to your family members\nyou can also try you know talking to\ncoach or therapist all that good stuff\nbut i think that there are a couple of\nimportant things to consider here the\nfirst is that\nyou know how much of you making people\nproud\ndrives what you do\nand the second thing is even if it is a\nbig driver that's okay\nif you don't enjoy being in the mba\nprogram if it's not fun for you i'd say\nthe other thing so this is where things\nchange a little bit for like high\npotential folks\nso i'm gonna pull a little bit from like\nother dimensions of stuff here okay\nso generally speaking at healthy game\nwhere we talk about you know trying to\nfind fulfillment and being productive\nand being happy\noddly enough for this person we're not\ngoing to talk about that i'd say if\nyou're suffering\nokay so this is where what you need to\nreally think about doing is\nreconceptualizing the mba like why did\nyou get it in the first place was it to\nmake people happy was it because it was\na good idea\nbecause this person says that they want\nto like help people and they want to\nmake the world a better place\nso then the other way to view your\nsituation is like not how to find\nhappiness forget about happiness for a\nsecond i know it sounds weird\nbut think about what your goals are what\nyou want to be in the world\nand whether an mba will help you with\nthat\nand even if you dislike it like do you\nneed to do it\nso when we talk with our hypos it's kind\nof bizarre because like what we really\ndo is change the\nthe the frame a little bit and this is\nwhere like there are\ntimes in my life where i didn't enjoy\nbeing on 24-hour calls\nbut this is where dharma comes in\nbecause remember that dharma is what\nallows you to\nsacrifice happiness and tolerate\nsuffering for like and still find peace\nso what i would say to this person is\nare the skills that you're\nin like developing in the mba\nare those going to be important things\nfor you to accomplish what you want to\nin life\nand if the answer to that question is\nyes like maybe you need to stay in it\neven if you're suffering\nright like this is where you need to\ntake a step back and really think a\nlittle bit about what you want to\naccomplish\ndo you want to drop out and just like\nstart to help random people like\nyou can try to do that i mean it's not\nyou know that's one option\nbut it sounds like you've done a lot of\nlike academic work and you're trying to\nexpand\nyou know your skill set and you may not\nenjoy it so it's not so much about\nenjoyment for a lot of hypos it's not\nabout enjoyment it's about\nworth value is it worth it for you to\nspend generally speaking mba programs or\ntwo years\nis it worth it for you to suffer for two\nyears be in this scenario you know\nfor the sake of acquiring particular\nskills to\nequip you for the next phase down the\nroad\nthat's what i'd really encourage this\nperson to do right so understand a\nlittle bit about why you got the mba in\nthe first place\nunderstand a little bit about what you\ndislike about it understand\nwhy you're reluctant to talk to your\nmentors i'd say definitely overcome that\nand also talk to your mentors\nbecause as someone who you know has\nmentored medical students and\nand psychology students and stuff like\nthat is very common for people in\ngraduate school to feel like they really\ndon't want to be there anymore\nand that's where like one of the most\nimportant things you can do if you're in\ngraduate school and you don't like being\nthere is reaching out for support\nand seeing if there are people who can\nbe like hey man i felt the same way\nyou'd be surprised what your mentors may\nsay you know it's kind of like it's\ntricky\nso reach out to them and then ultimately\nask yourself\nis it worth it right why did you get\ninto this and even if it sucks while\nyou're doing it is it worth it\ni mean no one enjoys being on 24-hour\ncalls and like i still remember\nyou know i used to spend like weekends\nlike moonlighting at a hospital because\nwe were starting healthy gamer and we\nneeded a little bit of extra money and\nyou know i'd like kids to support and my\nwife was getting an mba and like so it\nwas like okay so\nthis is like it sucks to spend you know\ni'd work one week and then i'd like\nspend the weekend working\na 48-hour shift at a hospital and then\nlike\ni'd get like a half day sunday to kind\nof rest and then my kids haven't seen me\nso i get home after 48 hours in the\nhospital i'm feeding him breakfast and\nstuff and like\nthen like you sleep for a little while\nand then monday morning rolls around\nit's like another week of work\ngg weekend and the question is is it\nworth it right like that's the big\nquestion\nso if you guys are struggling with\nsomething if something is is causing you\nsuffering you have to ask yourself like\nis this a sacrifice that is worth it for\nme to make\nand if the answer is yes then like by\nall means make the sacrifice and if the\nanswer is no\nthen try to go chase after happiness"
