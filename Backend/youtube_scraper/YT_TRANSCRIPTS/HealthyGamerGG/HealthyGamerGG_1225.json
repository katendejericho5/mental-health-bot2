    "transcript": "hi hey what's going on\ngood to meet you good to meet you too\num yeah where do i start um\nyou can call me flo perfect bro uh\nwe've talked before i was on one of your\num\nporn addiction streams a while back ah\ngood to see you again thank you good to\nspeak to you again\num so my age is 22\nand i'm a software engineer in germany\nand my question was how do i tell my\nparents\nthat i was suicidal as a kid and\nthat i'm currently fighting depression\nbasically without hurting them or\nblaming them\nfor like\nwhat happened to me um\ndo you blame them for what happened to\nyou\ni think that yeah a part of my\nhow i was brought up definitely plays a\nrole in it\nlike yeah i i blame them\ni mean like i see them as flawed people\nbut i think some of their actions\nyeah make me who i am i think\nif that makes sense so\nokay if you want i can\ngive you like a background\nokay so uh i i do want a background but\njust in a moment are you watching stream\nuh i closed it good give me just one\nmoment\nokay sure okay so why don't you tell me\na little bit\nabout um\nyou know what so help me understand a\nlittle bit about\nyour you wanna um you wanna talk to your\nfamily about\nyou want to share you want to tell your\nparents that you're suicidal and you're\ndepressed\nright and you're having difficult but\nyou want to share it in a way that\nprevents them from\nfeeling blamed yes\nso\nyeah so tell me a little bit more so\nbasically um so my family situation\nparents are still together um i have a\nsister\nan older one and um\nmy parents weren't really like an\nemotional support\nwhen i grew up so they were like really\ndistant we never talked about how we\nfelt\num and\nthey would usually like show their life\nthrough like financial support\nokay and um\nlike my mom is like pretty dominant and\nactually thinks like um that people\nthat go and do therapy are basically\ncrazy\nand um that it's pretty uncommon to\ngo to therapy so she has like a bias a\nstrong wise about that\nand my dad is like a lot more\napproachable but\nvery passive and\nbasically i never shared\nthat i am in therapy with them or that i\nwas depressed\nbecause i'm afraid of their reaction and\num they\nfound out a while ago that my sister\nis in therapy and their reaction was\nkind of scary as well\nlike first of all they're really\nconfused what\nhappened to her or why she\nis in therapy because she's so distant\nthat she\ndoesn't want to talk about it and\nnow i feel like this might be the right\ntime to open up to them\nand although we never talk about\nemotions like\num\nyeah just just kind of i kind of want\nwant some relief\nfrom being able to tell them how i\nreally feel if they ask me\nlike like we we meet from time to times\nwe don't live together anymore\nand if they ask me how i'm doing i'm not\ntelling them if i had like a really bad\nday\nfor example so and why don't you tell\nthem that you have a bad day\num because it would usually lead into\ni had like lots of anxiety today and\ni'm working on xyz\nthrough my therapy and then i would just\nopen up like the whole\nthing so what i'm hearing is that you um\nand by the way just to clarify are we\nshowing your face or not\nbecause i know you're on a video call i\nhowever you want i don't i don't mind\nokay let me just go to\nour interview screen then okay so\num so are we\nshowing faces\nsomeone else joined the channel but i\ndon't know uh\nwait can they hear the ping i'm sorry\nyeah that they can't it's okay though i\ni mean i guess i have the notification\non it's okay\num so flo let's just think a little bit\nabout so on the one hand\nthis is what i'm hearing the first thing\nis that you've been struggling with some\nof these issues of\ndepression and suicidality for a while\nit sounds like your parents won't be\nvery\nopen to hearing that and so what i'm\nhearing\nis that you're essentially carrying this\nburden kind of on your own\nand it's not that you expect your\nparents to really fix it for you but\nthat\nyou're afraid of their judgment um and\nand i think that you know the people\nthat we love we just\nyou know we want them to support us\nyou know even if it's not like in a big\nway like at least emotionally i mean you\nwant to tell\nyour parents what you're going through\nbut you're afraid of how they're going\nto react so you're not\nand this is where things get really\ntricky because like not only are you\ntrying to\nyou know avoid their judgment that but\nthere's also a part of you that is\num you know afraid that\nthey did have some role in it and that\nthey won't\nrespond very well to like that idea\nis what i'm hearing so in a weird way\num you know they're you're almost kind\nof protecting them by keeping it from\nthem\nbut you're carrying an extra heavy\nburden because of that in a weird way\ndoes that make sense\nyes that that yeah applies\nso so let me so there\nso there are a couple of principles at\nplay here but first i'm going to just\nanswer your question and then i'm going\nto share one or two principles okay so i\nthink the way that you tell them\nis just like that so you just say mom\ndad i just you know there's some there's\na part of my life that i haven't really\nshared with you very much because i've\nbeen afraid of your judgment\nand you know i was suicidal when i was\nyounger and i've been struggling with\ndepression\na lot like my sister for a couple of\nyears now\nand i just wanted y'all to know now\nthere are a couple of important pieces\nthere so one is like your expectation\nabout the conversation is going to be a\nlot of your suffering\nokay so you know who your parents are\nand it can be sad but\ntry to let go of that expectation and\nyou know i do think that it is possible\nto get to a place where your parents can\nsupport you\nand i think the most important part is\nthe next part\nwhich is that the first conversation\nshouldn't be one where you're sharing a\nlot of information it should be one\nwhere you're asking a few questions\nif you can manage it and i would start\nwith the question\nwhat's your understanding of what\ndepression is\nlike when i say that i was suicidal and\ni've been depressed for years like what\ndoes that mean to you\nand listen to what they have to say\nand be aware that you know part of their\ndefensiveness may be a sense of blame\nlike they may be like blaming themselves\nand their ego arises in response to that\nso like i know it's really hard but i\ndon't know that they're gonna be in a\nplace to listen it just sort of depends\nbut if you're wondering how you have\nthat first conversation\ni think being honest about it being\nsimple like it's like one or two\nsentences it's not a whole lot of\nexplanation\nit's not a whole lot of excuses it's not\na whole lot of it's not your fault where\nreally they do have something\nlike you know you can you can get down\nthat that road later\num but i'd say you know two or three\nsentences and then what does that mean\nto you\nand then really listen to them\num how does that sound um\nyeah i think um it sounds good\nit sounds like a like i didn't think\nabout\num kind of asking\nthem for their understanding of what i'm\ngoing through so\nbut i yeah\nlike you you um said something about\nexpectation\nwhich is like my expectation right now\nis that\nthey really don't know\nwhat depression really is like they\nhave like\nnot a lot of knowledge about mental\nhealth in general\nso that's and i got that impression as\nwell from\nseeing their reaction to finding out\nthat my sister\nis in therapy so\nyeah so i gotta let go of the\nexpectation yeah so but let's talk about\nthe expectation for a second what do you\num what do you feel like\nhow does it how do you feel knowing that\nthey're not going to respond to you\nor imagining they won't respond to you\nwith like support\nthat's really hard um\nit kind of adds to the general sense i\nhave when i'm with my parents which is\nlots of times like feeling worthless so\nit's like\nsuch a big step to tell them about it\nand if they\ndon't care then or they\nlike i i know that my mom for a fact\nwill tell me that\nthere's probably something wrong with me\nand i am\ni have caused my suffering which is\ntrue to some extent but um\nkind of not what you want to hear in\nthat situation so it's um\nyep yeah it's just it's just um\ni feel really sad right now thinking\nabout it\nbecause it's like they don't care yep i\ni i know exactly how you feel man\num i think it can be really really\nchallenging\num and so what we're going to try to do\nis\nlike so this is where flo i think so it\nsounds like you do have a therapist\nright\nyes okay so i think you know you should\ndefinitely lean on them\nbut i i think there are a couple things\nthat i i want to kind of share with you\none is that\nyou know so it's that attitude so\nsomewhere along the way\nyou were sort of taught that you're to\nblame\nyeah right so so if we look at it's i'm\ngonna just take a step back and\nexplain something so sigmund freud um\nconceptualized depression as anger\nturned against the self\nand so you blame yourself for everything\nlike\nyou know your mom and like if we think\nabout where did you learn how to blame\nyourself like unfortunately a lot of\ntimes we learn from our parents\nand sorry yeah go ahead\num i i was on like the\num the healthy gamer coaching\nlike the free coaching for a while and\nit's something that i talked to adam\nabout a lot\nand he he actually asked me like what\ndid your\nparents tell you that\ncould lead to the self of like self\nworth that you have right now\nand something they always told me was\nbasically since growing up\nlike when you were born we had to move\nout of our bedroom in order to make\nplays for you\nand like this is not your bedroom it's\nours but we made space for you so i was\nkind of already blame\nblamed for being born because i was\nalways\nit was already a burden for them because\nthey had to leave their room\nso yeah yeah that's that's\nit does go deep and and what i'm hearing\nis that even in this conversation\nyou're taking over a part of their\npeaceful mental household too\nthey have this beautiful house built in\ntheir head of what their what their life\nis like and what their children's life\nis like\nand it's pretty imperfect and you know\nyou're occupying the space that you're\nsupposed to occupy\nand by telling them this what you're\ngonna do is\nmove into their spare bedroom that\nwasn't the life that they\nbuilt right and how does it feel\nto go\ntake space that isn't yours\num she's really bad\nyeah um right so what i want you to\nunderstand so now comes\nthe good part but also the hard part is\nthat flow these\nthese thoughts that you have are like\nthey're like a\nparrot that is just repeating what it's\nheard\nright these are your parents thoughts\nthey're not actually a measure of your\nvalue like they're not\nyou know they're not true they're just\nlike echoes\nand so i think that that process and\nthis is where you know if we want to be\na little bit\nforgiving so i think one way to move\nforward here is to forgive\nbut in order to forgive you have to\nblame them first\nright and this is where the tricky part\ncomes in whereas like if you can never\nmove past it if it's not like if you\ndon't blame them\nyou can't forgive them because i\ncertainly did a number on you i think\neveryone's aware of that\nyeah and and so i'm not saying you have\nto forgive them right away but i think\nthat like you know if you say they don't\nunderstand mental health and stuff like\nunderstand that\ntheir response to you sure there's\nsome stuff that you know we can blame\nthem for but some of that is like they\nmay just not understand mental health\nand so i think the first conversation is\nsort of like a conversation about hey\nhere's what i'm going through\nwhat's your understanding of it because\nin your mind\na lot of the fears that you have are\nfair a lot of the blame that you have is\nfair\na lot of the ways that they make you\nfeel like you don't belong here\nright so i'm imagining that you're\npulling them into a conversation where\nthey don't want to be\nand you're kind of inconveniencing them\nby having it\nso there's all of that which is like a\nsome scar and then there's also the\nmental health stigma\nwhich is actually has nothing to do with\nyou and nothing to do with them it's\njust if they haven't learned it\nand so you're gonna fight be fighting\ntwo battles one is sort of a more\ntraditional one and one is like this\nmental health stigma battle\nand this is where i i encourage you to\nyou know lean on your therapist\nlean on us welcome back it's good to see\nyou again\nthank you um and and you know we're\nwe're here to help you and you have a\nlot of people\nin your life who do care about you who\nwant you to be here\nwho enjoy seeing you um i love to see\nyou again i think it's fantastic that\nyou're back\num you know i wish you know at some\npoint i'd like to talk about happier\nthings but i'm i'm more than happy to\ntalk about this right now because\nwe meet people where they're at right\nand what you've got to do is meet peop\nmeet your parents where they're at\nthat's hard man i'm sorry\nyeah it's um yeah i just i just really\nhope that i\ni'll feel at least some relief\nso my hope is that the relief that\nyou're gonna feel is one of like\ndetachment where you can't really\ncontrol the people that they are\nyou can just take the first step of the\njourney like\nyou just because the journey isn't gonna\nwind up where you want it to go\ndoesn't mean that you shouldn't take\nthat first step\nand what i want you to do is take that\nfirst step and like\nyou know it's going to be a step in the\nright direction it may not go the way\nthat you want to\nand you hopefully still have you know\nyears\nif not a decade or two to get to a place\nwhere you're you know you can educate\nyour parents and they can support you\nand hopefully you can kind of come out\nof that depression a little bit and\nexplain to them\nso take take the first step even though\nit sounds really scary\nsounds like it's meeting your some scar\nhead on\nyeah i i kind of decided to\ntalk to my dad first because i think he\nis a lot more approachable with that so\ni\nhe will he'll come over tomorrow so it's\num oh wow\nyeah okay well good luck to you man\nyeah thank you yeah okay\nthank you so much for having me you're\nvery welcome hope to hear again\nyou know"
