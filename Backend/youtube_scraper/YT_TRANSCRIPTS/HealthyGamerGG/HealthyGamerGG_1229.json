    "transcript": "so if we think about if we think about\nour behaviors\nwe tend to focus on fixing a particular\nbehavior right we're like oh i\nlike i buy too many things and like\nmicro transactions and\nand i spend too much money i'm impulsive\nbut i think if we really tunnel down\ninto our behaviors what we find is that\nthey're like\ndeep rooted psychological\nissues or even like a sense of identity\nthere are things within us\nthat actually drive our behavior and a\nlot of times we focus on the external\nbehavior and instead what we need to do\nis\nlook at the internal roots of where that\nbehavior comes from\nand if i had to say one thing about\ntoday's interview it's that\nthat's what this interview illustrates\nand that oftentimes if you want to work\non a particular thing\nabout yourself be open-minded and follow\nwhere the road leads you because you'll\nend up\nfinding something that's really\nworthwhile\nhi youtube\nhey hey poggers how you doing\nthe rich lord i'm so excited to be\ntalking with you i think i have the\nright\nmicrophone and the right camera is my\nmic sound all right\nuh i think so all right cool cool\nlet me just check yeah i think it sounds\ngood um and so what do you what do you\ngo by\nuh you just call me rich yeah okay yeah\nyeah\nwelcome rich yeah i'm really excited to\nbe here you know i'm from new york so\ntalking to somebody from boston it's not\nsomething i do very often\nthat makes sense i'm in texas now if\nthat makes a difference but\nthat makes a huge difference yeah way\nmore now yeah it's interesting so i was\ni've always been a texan\num even in boston you know i use the\ny'all which is usually the main sign\nthat i'm from texas\nwait people are saying that i'm using\nthe wrong mic here give me one sec\nthat might be better oh my god that's so\nmuch better yeah yeah my bad\noh i think he's hold on\nhe switched oh yep nice my bad yeah\nmy bad i've been running around all day\ntrying to get stuff fixed with my phone\nso i think it might have actually been\nusing\nlike a mobile mic or something but oh my\ngod right now yeah\nyeah so rich um you want to just tell us\na little bit about yourself and maybe\num you know what you want to talk about\ntoday yeah\nso i'm a relatively\ni'm an extremely impulsive person i\nthink i'll start there\nand uh even the way that i contacted you\nwas\nextremely impulsive and i think that\ni've been uh\npretty fortunate that a lot of my\na lot of my uh habits which could be\nthings that would lead to problems have\nnever actually led to the terrible\nconclusion that they could lead to\nbut i think acknowledging some of them\nearly would definitely be good\nthat's not to say that i haven't had\nproblems with money in the past i\ndefinitely had which is probably the way\nthe reason that i am the way that i am\nuh but i yeah i figured i would just\ntalk to you\nabout it and kind of see what you had to\nsay\ni uh i will spend large amounts of money\nin in binge shopping trips and\nuh things like that and i think that uh\nmy chat likes to joke around about\nthe the pokemon cards which i actually\ndon't think was bad\nuh i think the gentian impact thing is\nprobably a lot worse\nlike and that's why after the tweet i\nwas like i'm gonna say it's less of a\ngambling thing\nand more of a micro transaction thing\nbecause the fomo from the micro\ntransaction games\nactually works on like even if i don't\nplay or plan to play\na game sometimes i will see micro\ntransactions and i'll be like oh my god\nthey're going away i need to buy them\nbecause what if i need them later\nwhich is probably pretty bad like i have\noverwatch skins and i've never played\noverwatch before\ninteresting i did work at blizzard at\nthe time though so i i think that uncle\nbobby paid for it\nbut that i definitely injected some of\nmy own cash as well\nso yeah the fomo from microtransaction\ngames definitely works as well and then\nthere\nthere's a host of other things that i've\nalways wanted to talk to you about\nuh i think that there was a clip a long\ntime ago when people were like hey\nrich should probably talk to dr k and i\nwas like\nyeah yeah probably so i figured i would\nkind of talk to you about\neverything yeah so what what else\nso you said there are a lot of things so\ni'm hearing stuff about\nimpulsivity binge shopping fomo maybe\nthat\nyou have certain habits or predilections\nthat could end up\nreally bad but somehow you've managed to\nescape through danger\nyeah yeah um i definitely have authority\nissues\nuh that that's actually probably a\nreally big thing and\nthat's also probably why uh\ni i've done so well with projects where\ni\nam in charge or i'm working with one\nother person who i really respect\nuh some people in chat probably know me\nas asmongold's friend i\ni loved when you you chatted with him as\nwell that was also one of the big\nreasons that i wanted to\nto talk to you but asman's somebody who\nyou know i've\ntrusted for years so it's really easy\nfor me to work with him and also\nasmin lets me\ncontrol a lot of the things that we work\non together to like a crazy degree\nwhich i think help is just beneficial\nfor me\nuh and then also with otk you know i\nwork with uh i work with tips very\nclosely\nit's another person i respect right but\nit's like that if there's somebody who\ni'm actually answering to\ni don't do very well and i will\npurposefully do things to\nlike assert dominance i think\ni i don't know it doesn't feel like that\nwhen i do it but i definitely think that\ni probably have authority issues um and\nso\ni you know rich i i think first of all\nlike wow dude like\ni think you're just an awesome blend of\nauthentic and also insightful like\nyou seem to recognize uh either\ninstinctively like\neven when you're talking about the fomo\nyou kind of recognize\nand notice the thought process that\nleads to the behavior\nwhich i think is a huge step in the\nright direction\ni'm good at understanding where a lot of\nthe problems come from as well\nbut that doesn't necessarily mean i try\nto fix them uh sometimes like sometimes\ni outright don't try to fix them\nbecause i feel like they make stuff more\ninteresting which is a bad habit from a\nlong time ago\nuh so i actually i went to nyu\nand i started off and i was uh pre-med\nand i wanted to major in psychology and\noh good god\nuh yeah yeah so i'm the worst and then\nuh after that i had a\ni basically had a pre-rack for creative\nwriting\nand it went really well and people were\nreally digging some of the stuff that i\nwas writing and i was like wow this is\ngetting me so much more attention\nwhich i love uh than anything i was\ndoing\nin pre-med in the giant lecture halls\nwhere you know kind of felt like\njust a fish in a giant sea and\ni i really enjoyed it and i was like wow\ni'm [ __ ] up\nwhich actually makes me a more\ninteresting person and i'm being way\nmore creative than other people\ndid that for a while ended up uh ended\nup being homeless for a little bit which\nwasn't really entirely my fault i know\nthat people are probably like oh my god\nyeah wow he does have terrible money\nproblems\nuh but yeah i ended up uh being homeless\nuh kind of\nin wake of you know the whole 2008\nhousing crisis\nmy family we lost our house and uh\nthat that kind of it was a whole series\nof events where i ended up not being in\ncollege for a year\nand i didn't want to go back when my\nfamily had just lost their house\nso i just kept working in the city uh\ndoing this and that and that's kind of\nalways been my attitude it was just\nalways like you know as long as i'm\nworking as long as i'm getting some\nmoney i'll always be able to keep my\nhead above water\nand then when i came back in school i\nwas like you know what everything that i\nwas doing before\nthis happened was stupid and now i'm\njust gonna do what i like\nbecause you know life is short i'm gonna\ndo whatever i like the most\nso i started i kept doing creative\nwriting stuff\nbut i started focusing on video games\nand that was how i ended up\nin kind of the station and life that i'm\nat now\nwow yeah rich that's quite a story bro\nyeah yeah it's been a it's been a wild\nride and that's the thing i i've enjoyed\nyou know people i i'm always nervous to\nsay this and i've said it a few times\nkind of maybe publicly even with asmin\nuh where i've just been like yeah i kind\nof\nliked having money issues at times\nit was almost a part of my identity and\nuh\ni liked feeling like i was winning even\nthough\nthe world wanted to kick me in the dick\nand i\nnever lost and it felt really good uh\nthere were definitely moments where\ni felt like i couldn't help my parents\nwhich hurt\num but yeah i think that it's a part of\nmy identity and i think that's probably\none of the reasons that i treat money\nthe way that i do now\nbecause uh how do you treat money the\nway you do now\nyou've alluded to treating money like\nalmost like it's a relationship\nyeah yeah i i love money and i also\ntreat it like it's flammable i\ndefinitely\ni definitely uh i\ni i go through phases\ni i think is a thing that i've my dad\nalways said when i was a kid even\nlike when i was a kid like i needed all\nof the power rangers figurines right it\nwas the most important thing ever\nand then i get to a feeling where i feel\nlike i've beaten it and then i never\nthink about it again\nand um i think one of my advantages\ndo i am as a human being is probably\nthat as well like i'm mildly obsessive\nso like i once i get into something\ni'm gonna do it and i'm gonna beat it\nand it's the most important thing\nwhether that's a game\nwhether that's a project like with otk\ni will not uh\ni will not like sleep you know\nand you know i have friends who are also\nlike that as well you know\ntips literally had his uh had his baby\nand\nwe're on the we're on the phone call and\nhe's like yeah did you know that babies\nlike\nneed to like be burped and i was like no\nthat's crazy by the way did you see the\nnew merch uh\nlike we just never stopped working and i\ndefinitely\nsurround myself with people like that\nand uh\ni'm very momentum-based rich can i ask\nyou a question\nyeah what's the problem here i'm not\nhaving any problems i feel like the big\nproblem\nis the money uh so like i feel like\ni don't pay attention to how much money\ni'm spending\nlike at all and i have actively said\nthat i wanted to fix it but then i don't\nright so like even with the micro\ntransactions like i feel like\ni need them every time they come around\nand\ni buy them and i don't think about them\nand i haven't run into the problem yet\nbut i definitely could\nyou know what i mean like i haven't run\ninto the part where i'm like\noh i don't have any money left but i\nasked myself if i had no money\nwould i still try to spend all my money\non micro transactions\nand things like that because even when i\nhad less money\nlike i have a giant sneaker collection\nover there i was\ni was living paycheck to paycheck and i\nwould still\nspend the money on dumb [ __ ]\nyou know what i mean what what so help\nme understand\ni know this is going to sound like a\nweird question but like what's the\nproblem with like collecting sneakers\nand living\npaycheck to paycheck uh\ni like really don't ever want to be\nhomeless or poor again and i feel like i\nspend money in a way where if all the\nsudden streaming\ndidn't continue to be a thing for me\nor if like some of these projects that i\nwork on didn't continue\nto go the way that they they did i would\nhave\nnothing instead of having something\nsaved up to\nto rely on\nokay so can i think for a second\nyeah i'm gonna compose my thoughts\nthere's a lot here man\nokay so we're going to talk a little bit\nabout money\nbut i want to just lay out like other\ndimensions of things that i thought were\nlike really fascinating and i'd love to\ntalk to you about them because\nit seems like you do have such a good\nleg up on your own sense of\nunderstanding and like your own history\ni think it'd be awesome to explore any\nof these things one is authority issues\nand then there's also this element of\ncontrol that you kind of talked about\nthat like you seem to work well with\npeople that let you\nstay in control that sometimes you don't\ntry to fix things\nthat like you sort of know that there's\na problem but that there's another part\nof you that's sort of like no\nactually we actually thrive on chaos\nlike that's the other thing that i'm\nhearing from you\nis that you know your your terrain of\nchoice that gives you advantages to all\nof your stats is actually chaos it's not\norder\nyeah and and there's also like a lot\nthat we could explore about your history\nand how it shapes you\nand the last thought that i kind of had\nwas and you know this i think we should\ntalk about money but\nwe could definitely have a conversation\nabout ayurveda because boy are you a\nclassic vata pitta\nand what i mean by that is that like so\nayurveda sort of believes that\nyou know not all human beings have the\nsame sort of psychology like\nyou know in western psychology we like\nwe treat it like a subject that is\nmonolithic that applies to everyone\nbut in ayurveda they sort of describe\npeople's minds\nusing the elements and you are like a\nclassic example of a vata pitta and what\navata pitta means\nis like you're like a combination of\nwind and fire where\nyou switch directions easily but once\nyou switch a direction\nyou're like very fiery in your approach\nand you kind of follow through to\ncompleteness\nand then you kind of switch to the next\nthing and then follow through to\ncompleteness\nand a lot of people will like actually\nwish they were like you because a lot of\nplain vatas will say like\noh i i like switch things all the time\nbut then i don't\nfollow it through and so oddly enough\nyou know they'll look at you with envy\nand they'll say like i wish when my\nmind wandered i at least followed it\nthrough to completeness before i\nswitched again\nand and so anyway and everyone sort of\nenvies doshas that aren't theirs but\nthere may be certain things you can do\nayurvedically to like\nliterally change your physiologic\nenvironment that causes your mind\nto fluctuate and also be so\nlike you're like a dog with something in\nits teeth that doesn't let go\nright like and and so there's there's an\nayurvedic discussion absolutely to be\nhad here\num but do people who fall into that\ntypically get\nlike ridiculously bored\nand frustrated with it like i like i\nthings that even that are going well\nonce i feel like i've\nlike i so i used to host esports and uh\neverything was going really well like i\nwas i felt like i had\nkind of reached my peak like i was doing\nlike a really good job\nand then because i was doing well i was\nlike all right time to start over\nwhen when i probably would have been\nmore comfortable in\na traditional sense if i i didn't do\nthat\nyeah so that's a really good point right\nso this goes back to like\nyou thrive on chaos yeah right so it's\nsort of like i\nyou know there's this book that i read\nmany years ago called taipan by this guy\nnamed james clavell it's a pretty cool\nbook\nbut there's this kind of one part in the\nbook where there's a captain who's on\nthe deck of his ship\nand there's like a like there's a\ntyphoon and so the captain is sort of\nlike\nlike he kind of thinks a lot about i may\nbe getting books mixed up here but\nhe thinks a lot about like why he keeps\non going out to sea like he\nhe's like he's successful he's made\nenough trading voyages\nhe could like retire at home in england\nbut he just chooses to go like back out\ninto the ocean for these moments where\nthere's like\nour hurricane that's like heading\ntowards him and it's like a life or\ndeath situation where he feels alive and\nit's just like\nhe can't just stay at home and like you\nknow\ndrink tea like he's got to be out here\nin the world like facing danger\nover and over and over again it's his\nelement\nyeah it gets the blood pumping it's like\njack nicholson in the departed\nright he already has all the money but\nhe yeah he ends\nyeah yeah so so i i think you know we\ncan sort of look at\nwhere the origins of that thriving on\nchaos comes from we can kind of explore\nthat there may be a vatican\nelement there but i i think we're going\nto touch on that if we actually talk\nabout money okay\nso the way i'd like to anyway so here's\nthe thought so\nthe five or six topics is sort of you\nknow money\nwhich i've got kind of another i can we\ncan dig into that i have like i want to\nsay something about that too which i\nthink could frame that discussion\nauthority issues why you don't try to\nfix things thriving on chaos\nyour history and how it's shaped you or\nayurveda like what would you like to\nstart with\nbut i'm going to toss this out there so\ni have a hypothesis that you are a slave\nto your mind\nyeah i think if we have to root\neverything back to one problem it's that\nyou are a slave to your mind\nyeah and this is a real issue because\nlike once your mind\nstarts thinking oh my god you're bald\nthe only way you can calm it down is to\nfeed it to give in\nright to like order some medication on\nthe off the internet and then your mind\nis like ah\nand then like there are times where\nyou're like oh my god like your mind\ntells you like oh we need overwatch\nskins because what if we one day play\noverwatch\nand then you're like yes sir aye aye\ncaptain\nright and so your mind has these\nthoughts and these impulses and this is\nkind of tricky because like\ni'm talking about your mind like it's in\nthe third person\nbut what i'm really hearing is that that\nyou know your mind says jump and then\nyou say how high\nthat your biggest authority issue is\nthat the problem with your authority\nissues is that\nyou need to have some degree of defiance\nwhen it comes to your own mind\nand that giving into your mind calms it\ndown\nlike and that's that's what you've\nlearned how to do you're sort of like\nyou know\neurope hitler invades poland and then\nlike what does europe do europe is like\noh\nthat's okay right so like we we just we\njust let the beasts run\nrampant and we just hope and every time\nyour mind tells you to do something\nyou're like\nyes sir yeah i might\ndo this thing i would go a step further\neven\nlike the second that i have a thought\ntoo it's like\nit's like okay jump how many different\nways could i jump what's each one going\nto lead to\nmaybe i should jump this way because\nthat'll lead to more jumping in the\nfuture and i think jumping is like\npretty rad activity\nand every single thing i do i think out\nlike that\nyep to the point that's like my favorite\nthing to do in life\nby far i think one of the reasons i i\nplay video games too\nis because it is the it takes away\nall of my real life problems it gives me\nproblems that i can easily beat\nand i can laser focus in on it and it's\nlike meditation i'm gone i'm not\nthinking about anything else\nand then my other favorite activity is\nlike by far sleeping\nand i every morning when i wake up uh i\nsaw you post on instagram a thing about\nattack on titan\nuh so i feel like this example finally\nsomebody will understand it when i say\nit\nuh in season one when aaron\nis like basically trapped in his own\nhead and he's under the blanket\nand he's like i'll just sleep a little\nbit longer and he\nand armin's trying to get him out of it\nand he just like can't\nget aaron out of it i feel like that\nevery single morning when i wake up uh\neven if there's somebody there trying to\nwake me up\nlike i can't i can't wake up in the\nmorning and i think that it's because\nmy brain is finally uh quiet and so i\nthink that\nthat's one of the reasons i like\nsleeping so what what happens to your\nbrain\nwhen you purchase something with a\nmicrotransaction\nit's like [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] it's like\nactually like that like it's like this\nlike\nyeah [ __ ] them it's like it's really\naggressive like it feels\nreally good to spend money for me uh\neven like losing money\nfeels good if like i gamble uh because\ni'm like ha ha i can do that\nuh at times yeah\nokay yeah that sounds so dumb when i say\nit like that but i don't know how else\nto\ndecide so so let's let's try not to be\nor it's fine to be judgmental but let's\nnot let our judgments dictate\nour conversation yeah right so so when\nyou say\nyou know [ __ ] em\nwho who is the person doing the [ __ ]\ni'm saying i am [ __ ] the world\nback right and why is it important\nwhy do you want to do that uh\nbecause i i think\nthat if i really had to get down to it\ni think that there's a level of proving\nto myself that\ni've beaten\nthe game already even though i probably\ni know i haven't\num why do you feel like you need\nwhy do you have to prove to yourself\nthat you've beaten the game\ni i don't know but i i uh\nbecause i feel like i already do know in\ncertain ways that i've already you know\ndone a lot yeah who has to prove that\nthey're a winner\npeople people who aren't usually\nwhat are you um i\ni think that uh i think that i've won\nin a lot of things but i'm i definitely\ndon't feel like i'm done\nbut i've definitely i've definitely lost\ni i i started completely losing\nyou know what i mean i grew up in\natlantic city i was poor as [ __ ]\nout and you know i i\neat and that that wasn't the only time i\ntook a hit right\nso i think that i still have that like\nit's not even that i was losing it was\nthat the\nthe world was my enemy and it was like\nyou ever played yeah you ever play uh\nyou're playing like pandemic or a game\nlike that and you know\nthis the second that you flip over the\ncards and it's like oh [ __ ]\nlike time to spread spread the virus i\nfelt like i was just flipping those\nnon-stop\nand it wasn't there was stuff that was\nout of my control and i know that it was\nout of my control\nand i would just try to keep changing\nstuff\nso yeah tell me about atlantic city\nsucks uh i i grew up in\na town that was on the mainland\nbut it was uh it was kind of right in\nbetween i was in like\ni was in the most i'm trying to even\nthink about like what financial station\nyou would say people in my area were in\nthere was a really rich town next to me\nand then there was like a really poor\ntown\nand it very much felt like my my town\nwas in the middle\nand it was like okay are you going to\nkind of\nbe involved in the the shittier stuff\nand the shadier stuff and and and deal\nwith that\nuh or are you going to try to blend in\nand pretend like you had money\nuh and i wasn't particularly i think\nmost\nreally poor people will tell you this i\nwas so poor that i had no idea that i\nwas poor\nuh and i thought that that was just how\nthe world worked\nand it the people who were wealthier\ndidn't seem like they were\non a whole other realm of existence to\nme\nuntil i moved to new york and i was like\nmy my god\nlike these like this is sick that\nwhat did you realize was help us\nunderstand\nlike you know when you said like\nthere are different levels like what did\nyou realize and how did you grow up and\nwhat did you realize wasn't maybe normal\num like i i'm trying to like even think\nof\nlike the best way to say it because like\nthe moment when i like knew\nlike in new york at nyu obviously you're\naround like a lot of people who are just\nlike\nthe top of the top like i have i had\nmoments where i was like\nin these giant brownstones where i'm\nlooking at art that i had read about\nand it's just like in their kitchen and\ni'm like what the heck um and\ni moments where you know a night of\ndrinking turned into me being on\nmy friend's private jet and i'm like\nwhat the heck i rem\ni would wear shoot when when i was a\nfreshman i bought\na pair of sneakers from flight club i\nstill have them\nsomewhere i wore them for a year\nstraight and they had an added feature\nwhere every time it rained my feet got\nto go swimming\nand that was enough it was a cool pair\nof shoes you know\nand uh to think that people are just\nwailing out on on art and things like\ni don't know it just it changed my\nperspective on a lot of things\nand i don't know if it made me angry or\nif it made me hungry or what it made me\ni don't know i don't know i truly don't\nknow\nhow did your perspective change\nfelt bad for my mom and dad i wanted to\nhelp them i think because i know i\nknew some of the stuff they worry about\nand my parents are\nmore stubborn than me which is hard uh\nmy mom and dad they work at a uh they go\nto a flea mart i'm proud of them too i'm\nnot i'm very proud of them\nand how hard they work but they go to a\nthey go to a flea market every weekend\nand like sell makeup and dog toys and\ni try to help and they they don't really\nlet me my sister actually does really\nwell too\nuh like i i do i do good financially\nlike i'm pretty okay\nuh besides my tendencies right uh but my\nlittle sister you know she's\nshe's uh she's a little bit younger and\nshe's actually a producer\nover at uh genius the music company uh\nthat like has like the song lyrics is so\npretty cool job she does well\nand my parents just won't let us help uh\nthey're they're very stubborn\nmy my dad let me i'm trying to think how\nlong\nago it was but he let me give him like\nuh\na decent amount of cash and every time i\ntalk to him\nhe's just like he's like yeah i can i\ncan pay back man\nlike kind of thing i'm like stop please\nlike just let me help\nand yeah and at times i i don't even\ni won't even call my parents as much\nor see my parents because i'm almost uh\nyeah i just feel like i could do more\nand i don't know how\nat times if they won't let me sure\nyeah so i know this sounds kind of weird\nrich but out of everything that you've\nsaid this is the thing that i want to\ntalk about the most for a few minutes\nyeah i almost want to like\ncoach you and how to talk to them yeah\nhow do you feel about that yeah yeah i i\ni'd like that so what i'm hearing is\nthat\nyou know your parents are fiercely proud\nfiercely independent\num but also like struggle and work\nreally hard for\nlike not a whole lot of gain yeah yeah\ndefinitely\nand and that you know by chance or grit\nor some combination of the two you and\nyour sister have managed to\nlike you know become pretty financially\nlike secure at least more so than your\nparents and\nit sounds like you guys really did not\ngrow up with things being easy and i'm\nguessing that your parents\ndid a lot and made a lot of sacrifices\nto try to like help you guys\nyou know launch for lack of a better\nterm\nyeah my parents did\neverything with no regard for themselves\nand just like everything for me and my\nsister\nlike my my mom has always been that way\nlike uh\ntrying to get my mom to do something for\nherself is very difficult and she\nshe's like the best parent on the face\nof the earth\nand my dad is very similar to me\nwhere i think like that's where like a\nlot of that uh\nthat like i'm gonna i'm gonna do\neverything myself\nuh side comes from maybe it's where i\ngot it from\nuh i'm not 100 sure how that works right\num but yeah my dad's very similar to me\nin that regard so i think that\nthere's probably a level of him enjoying\nthe the\nstruggle of it sure what does he enjoy\nabout it\nuh well i i'm like potentially like just\nprojecting how i feel\nuh right now but i've never really\nthought about it this way\nuh but yeah they're\nyeah it's that feeling of like winning\nright you know what you have to do and\nyou do it\nand you keep your head above water and\nand it feels good\nso maybe he feels uh feels a similar way\nyeah right yeah you don't need anyone's\nhelp\nyeah yeah you can do it on your own\nyeah what's it like to get people's help\nrachel rick\num\ni i don't know i i'm like thinking of\nlike\ni can't just take help usually\nfrom like for no reason like uh\nlike uh even like on twitch right like\nin\nthings that people see like um\ni i don't like if i ever feel like\nsomebody's like helping my stream and i\nhaven't done something to warrant it it\nbothers me\nlike what bothers you about that i feel\nlike i'm taking from uh\ni feel like i'm taking from my friends\nwhich i don't like um\nyeah yeah i\nyeah yeah i think i think taking help is\nprobably pretty hard for me\nhow do you understand what makes what\nmakes it hard how do you feel about\nyourself when someone else helps you\nuh\ni'm trying to think of times when people\nstraight up helped me you know the thing\nwith um\nyou know most of the help that i would\nget i would say is from\nmy my my friends on otk which i don't\nfeel bad about\nright because you know\ni'll do anything for any of them at any\ntime you know\nif uh if ms is like\noh dude i want to do this this and this\nyou know i'll i'll stay up\nand i'll be like okay you know we're\ngoing to get this person this person\nthis person on it\nwe'll get the graphics made we'll do the\nrun of show like i'll test everything\ni'll make sure it's good\nand like i know that that's ready to go\nyou know if\nif tips needs to call me at 5 a.m even\nif it's just the talk or if we're\ntalking about what we're going to do the\nnext day i'm there\num if asthma needs something i'm there\nanybody on otk you know i'm there so\nif i felt like i needed something from\nany of them i wouldn't feel\nbad asking sure right because you can\ngive back\nyeah yeah what's it like to accept help\nfrom people who\nyou can't give back\nthe last time i can remember doing that\nis uh actually still my roommate now\ntoday\nuh right after\nright after like um i'd been\nhomeless and i just gotten into a new\napartment\nhe started to live with us because he\nknew one of my friends\nand i didn't know him at all yet and i\nneeded a computer because i wanted to\nstart\num i need it for work and i wanted to\nuse it to\ncast online tournaments and to try to\nstart streaming and he bought me a\ncomputer for like two thousand dollars\nand he barely knew me\nand uh yeah now like\nnow i i haven't stopped living with him\nfor like six years and like i'll pay his\nrent sometimes and [ __ ] like that\nbecause i don't know he just did that\nfor me so i'll never\ni'll never stop uh trying to try to\nhelp him you know um so yeah\nfor him to do like something like that\nfor you\num i mean i just\nbasically said that you know if if he\never needed\nsomething i would always do it i didn't\nfeel guilty about it\nuh i don't think but i basically was\njust like yeah\nlike um after he did it i was just like\ni\ni owe him a lot i guess\nyeah so i'm hearing you say you felt\nindebted\nyeah yeah yeah for sure you're paying\nthat debt back\nit doesn't it doesn't feel like i'm like\nlike indentured to him but uh but there\nis like\nit's almost like a familial tie i guess\nit feels like\nyeah yeah i'm noticing\nyeah so i think there's a certain\nlet me just think for a second\ndo you remember what you thought\nabout yourself\nto be in a position where you needed his\nhelp\nor you couldn't get the computer on your\nown\ni felt like i might have been a very\ndifferent person at the time too\nlike when i'm even thinking back um\nhow are you different\num i was a lot angrier then\ni i remember that um\ni haven't remembered that in a while i\nused to have really like a really bad\ntemper\num what would make you so angry\ni don't know that's what i can't\nremember like\num i think when i felt like people\nweren't listening to me was probably\none of the things that made me the most\nangry like uh\nlike if people didn't agree with me\nafter i like made an argument and like\nwas like wait i'm like 100\nright like how are you not hearing what\ni said\nor or um sure yeah i think that was\nprobably one of the things that made me\nthe most angry\nyeah i'm just kind of noticing that you\nknow you mentioned working with asthma\nand gold and it seems like part of the\nreason you can work with asthma gold is\nbecause he lets you you know he listens\nto your opinion respects you\nyeah yeah 100 uh same with same with\neverybody i work with\ni do feel that way with everybody i work\nwith um even though like we'll disagree\nright like\num i'll disagree with asthma and i'll\ndisagree with tips all the time\nbut uh i know i know they hear me\nyou know what i mean and i hear them and\nyou know i'll change my opinion\nsometimes too like i'm not like the a\nhuge hardhead where it's my way or the\nhighway\nbut i definitely do feel like yeah i\ni work with somebody who will hear both\nsides like if i feel like i'm heard\ni can have the conversation and change\nmy opinion and then i think where\ni probably have the authority issues\nwhere it's like they don't listen they\ndon't acknowledge the value of the other\nopinion and then i'm like\nah sucks to suck we're doing it my way i\ni do think that that is\nprobably um yeah\nyeah yeah so i mean are there particular\ntimes in your life where you felt like\nreally disrespected or like ashamed\num i'm trying to think of the time i\nfelt ashamed i i can't really think of\nthe time i've felt\nsuper ashamed disrespected definitely uh\ni i mean people mean without it but\ndefinitely uh during the blizzard [ __ ]\ni definitely felt uh what is the what is\nthe blizzard [ __ ]\ni worked for uh so i when i started\nworking at mlg which i mentioned kind of\nat the beginning of\nus talking i um\ni it ended up getting mlg got acquired\nby activation blizzard so i worked at\nactivision blizzard\nand i hosted and played by play casted\npretty much all of their esports events\ni did uh call of duty\ni did world of warcraft\nother uh gigs that would come up i did\npretty like a lot for them\nand uh yeah eventually i ended up\ngetting uh\nif you were saying the ants and bobby\ncodex maze thing uh\nyeah i i ended there was there was a\nclip of me\nthere was there's one time that i've\nlost my temper basically\nuh while streaming there's one time that\ni really lost my temper it was while\nplaying wow\nand that that's actually the only time\nthat i've really lost my temper\nand it was bad it was a bad lsf clip\nuh but yeah that's pretty much the only\ntime i can remember losing my temper in\nrecent history and that was probably\nlike a year ago or something like that\num\ncan can you just hold on a second rich i\nthink i gotta reconnect the call because\nyou seem a touch out of sync\none second uh i actually think the out\nof sync thing\nmight have been on my end because my\ncomputer like locked up for a second\nyeah um should should i just like leave\nthe call and come back in maybe\nuh yeah hol um sure let's just\nleave i'll leave the call and come back\nin okay cool sounds good\nis that better i think so yeah\nso so hmm let me just try to get a\nhandle on this conversation for a second\nyeah let me toss out a couple of things\nokay so i'm gonna toss out sort of a\nhypothesis you let me know like what\npart of this\num yeah let me just let me just\nsketch something out okay okay\nyeah so like here's what i'm noticing\nrich i i think like i mentioned earlier\nyou know\nit seems to me that your core problem is\nthat you're a slave to your mind\nand what i mean by that is that\nsometimes you'll have like impulses\nright and like the only way to like\nsatisfy that\nthe only way to quiet the impulse is\nthrough satisfying it\nright so it's like you can't tolerate\nnot\nsatisfying it there's also this sort of\nidea\nof i think somewhere along the way i\nmean it sounds like you had a\nchallenging upbringing you know being\nhomeless and whatnot\nsometimes that can really affect\npeople's identities\nto be screwed over by the world and what\ni'm sort of noticing is like in your\nsubconscious\nthere's a part of your mind that's like\nkeeping track of score\nit's like there's like a grudge match\nbetween you and the world\nand here are all the ways in which the\nworld has screwed you and here are all\nthe ways where you've said okay world\nyou want to screw me like let's go [ __ ]\nand then you come out on top i feel like\nyou're right and\nso like you're fighting this like weird\ncosmic battle against the universe\nin which you like you want to come out\non top\nand it feels so good to come out on top\nand this is where like so then the\nquestion is you know why do we feel\nwhy does it feel so good to like come\nout on top against the universe it's\nsort of\nand that's where sort of like i think\nwe're getting into some identities uh\nissues of identity and why you need to\nbe a winner\nand like you kind of said you know\npeople who need to prove\nsomething are the ones that don't\nbelieve it themselves\nlike i don't need to prove to anyone\nthat i'm indian\nyeah like if people don't think i'm\nindian like that's\ntotally fine like sometimes i get\nmistaken as hispanic and like that's\ncool you know like no big deal there are\nthings that sometimes i feel like i need\nto prove to people\nand the more that i've looked at like\nyou know if there's anything that you\nfeel like you need to prove to people\nit's something that you need to\nyou tend to believe yourself and this is\nwhere i can only imagine\nall of the instances where life\ntried to tell you that they're like\nwinners\nand losers right there are people who\nhave homes and people who don't have\nhomes you grew up in this town where you\nsaw the losers over there\nand the winners over here and it's like\nwhich camp do i want to be in\nyeah and then you like went to nyu where\nyou were like okay like\nyou thought you had figured everything\nout and you were like okay i'm a pretty\ndecent human being my parents are legit\nthey're hard workers i can respect them\ni can love them\nand still this voice in the back of your\nmind like you show up at your friend's\nplace and there's like this artwork in\nthe kitchen that you've only read about\nyou're like wait a minute\ni thought i had this figured out but\nlike and then there's the private jets\nand whatnot so as you kind of like\nintermingle with these different people\nlike i get the sense that\non one level rich you're very very\nconfident in who you are it's clear to\nme that like\nyou know you believe in what you do it's\nclear to me that you're a caring person\nit's clear to me that like you respect\nyour own work ethic as flawed as it is\num i think you can really say honestly\nthat you're someone that people can\ncount on\nwhich i think is an awesome part of your\nidentity\nlike you know p you're reliable for\neveryone else except for yourself\nright so like if a friend needs you to\nmake a doctor's appointment you can make\nit like that\nbut if you need to make your own\ndoctor's appointment uh\nyeah you know and so i i'm getting a lot\nof issues of really\nidentity and sort of like this idea that\nlike you need to win\nwhich i think sort of tangles up with\nthese authority issues because i think\nthere are some relationships where\npeople\nmake you feel like they're trying to\ndisrespect you or like they're like\ntrying to push you back into the loser\ncategory\nand you're like i ain't having that like\nthere is no way that i'm going to let\nyou\npush me back into the loser box because\nthat's not who i\nam but that yeah go ahead\nyeah i i feel like i um\nany time that i'm trying to even think\nhow to\nput it into words but like i feel like\nthere's\njust this um any time that something\npushes back against my will\nit it does feel like it's it's almost\nwar and that drives me and\ni think that that's a lot of the reasons\nthat i'm able to do what i do\nlike the second that one thing doesn't\ngo my way it's like oh\ni i will remember that and i am keeping\nscore\nand i will balance the scale and i think\nthat that's something that's\nalways been a part of who i am\nbeautiful so now rich we get to the real\ncrux of the problem\nwhich is that if you want to change you\nhave to give up something that works\nreally well for you yeah right\nso so i think this is where like what\ni'd say that that what i would\nadvocate for you and what i'd ask you to\nthink about\nis i want you to think about your mind\nis a group of like\nhorses pulling a chariot and the thing\nis like when someone\nyou know takes like you know takes a cut\nat you or disrespects you\nthose horses like take off or maybe we\nshould think about it more like a dog\nsled where\nlike you know there's a group of dogs\nand your mind is like is ready to throw\ndown it's gonna keep track\ni think the problem though is that like\nyou can still what i'd really love to\nstart you on the path on is like taming\nthose dogs where like\nyou can still let them off the leash\nright like you can still\naccess that scrappiness\nthat fight that gutsiness that drive to\nsucceed\nthat drive to prove other people wrong\nbut that\nit doesn't drive you you control it\nlike the problem right now is you're the\none on the leash and the dog is the one\nthat's got like\nyou know the leash handle in its mouth\nand it decides it's gonna\nfly off the cuff whatever it feels like\nand so it's a really powerful thing to\nlike\nyou know to have this sort of like i'm\ngoing to prove the world\nwrong and i'm going to stay up until 4am\nand make sure\neverything is done right to get to where\ni need to go but the problem is like\nthat's wonderful\nthe issue is like who's in the driver's\nseat\nyeah yeah it's funny the second that you\neven like\ntalk about changing or anything like\nthat\nlike instant resistance like i like like\nit's not like uh\nit's not like i'm gonna like freak out\nuh and get mad but it's like a faint\nlike what\nlike no i why would i yeah it's just\nlike in the back of my mind like the\nbottom of the stomach almost just like a\nyeah rich so let's let's bring it to the\nforefront right\nso help me understand what that voice is\nsaying\nwhat's your resistance um\nit's just it is like a uh partially just\nlike\nyou've gotten here because of that why\nwould you just\nand then and then the thing that uh the\nthing that i always think about\num he's my agent but he became like one\nof my best friends like very early on\nuh so when i cast it i was on the road\nnonstop\nwhich is one of the things i really\nenjoyed because there was this\nlike momentum to it where it was just\nlike yeah i have to get on this plane\nlike and there was just like this\nconstant pull back and forth and there\nwere moments where\nthere was a nice lack of control uh and\nthen the second that i would sit down\ni was in control of the show you know\nthat's why i like hosting more than\nplay-by-play casting like i am in\ncontrol\nthis person's gonna say this and like i\nhave a feeling for when all of that's\ngonna happen\ni'm the one who calls for the ad break i\nknow the best time to do it\nand there there was this constant back\nand forth of it\nand i couldn't like i never wanted to\nstop doing that and the second that i\ndid i\ni would that's when i would you know go\ncrazy\nshopping doing whatever um gambling\nmaybe\nuh just just going going nuts and my my\nagent\nhis name's david um he he said to me\nhe was like you're missing peace in your\nlife that's like the one thing\nthat you're missing and i i've always\nacknowledged that and i've always\nthought about that\nbut i don't know if i could ever have\nthat peace and not just be bored out of\nmy mind\nsure so i i think you can because like\nthis is where\npeace for you doesn't need to be\nnot doing anything yeah right so but i i\nthink you definitely get there but i\nthink it requires some degree of\nsurrender i think your problem is that\nyou're hung up on control\nso like this is where we have to really\nthink about and get to the root of like\nwhat happens rich when you're not in\ncontrol\nand even before we get to that question\nwhen you spend a bunch of money\non a particular thing are you in control\nor are you not in control\ni think i'm not\nat times and that's when it feels bad\nbut then at other times i feel super in\ncontrol which is\nabsolutely right and then i think i try\nto chase the good part of it\nand then i think my answer to me not\nbeing in control is i genuinely believe\nthat most of the time it's the wrong\ndecision for me not to be in control\nbecause i think i make the right call\ni genuinely believe that so let's\nlet's talk about the purchasing for a\nsecond so i'd say that purchasing is\nyour way of taking control\nyeah i i would have i would agree and\nthen there are moments where\ni feel like seeking sickness sickeningly\nnot in control yeah so those are the\nmoments when you realize that the\ncontrol you're creating is false\nand what do you do when you feel those\nsickening moments\nof a lack of control\ni usually keep going right so so i'm\ngonna\ntry to toss an answer out you try to\npush him away as hard as you can\nright you're like forget it no no no oh\nmy god like there's a sickening pit in\nyour stomach i'm spending too much money\ni could be homeless one day and you're\nlike\nnope nope i'm losing control let me\npurchase more things ah\nyeah yeah\nthat was close we almost lost it rich we\nalmost realized we're\nreally not in control here good job\nlet's buy more stuff\nand feel like we're taking in control oh\nmy god we're we're losing our hair we\ncould be bald oh my god what would\nhappen if we're bald oh my god asthma\ngold who's so molding\nthinks i'm bald we better take control\nshould we go see a doctor\noh no no no we shouldn't see a doctor\nbecause what if they say\ni don't know what they're going to say i\ncan't control what they're going to say\nwhat if they prove me wrong i don't want\nthat\ni better just order this [ __ ] on the\ninternet and do my own research because\ni'm right most of the time\nyeah yeah yeah\nright yep and then we kind of get to\nthis thing where like you\nare right most of the time why do you\nneed to be\nin control because when you're not bad\nthings happen\nright what happened to you that was bad\nthat\nyou weren't in control of like let's\nthink about that\nuh definitely losing the house and\nyeah and\ni feel like even on project like any\ntime that i haven't\nmade the call on business decisions\nit's a less than optimal outcome uh\nnow there are there are times when i\nwork closely with other people\nthat um you know like\not otk in particular is like the\npinnacle of me\ngiving up large portions of control and\ni don't feel bad about that\nlike i genuinely do not uh there are\nthere are big portions of me giving up\ncontrol that i don't feel bad about at\nall\nbecause i genuinely believe in all of\nthose people to a ridiculous degree\nwhich is why\nwhy it works but i've never felt that\nbefore in my life and if i ever work in\nanother project i wouldn't be able to\ngive up the control in the same way\nrich you ready for we're on the same\nteam right now\nyeah yeah you ready for us to go into\nversus mode\nyeah i'm ready okay so here's the thing\nlike\ni think that you really have to\nre-examine some of those beliefs\nwhich ones in particular i'm about to\nlay them out so you say that when i'm\nnot in control things\nwind up sub-optimally i know this sounds\nreally weird but that is a factually\nimpossible statement okay\ni know it's going to sound right just\njust run with me here and then biology\npush back and prove me wrong\nso i think that our mind does something\nit's really interesting right because\nyou say like\nwhen i surrender control if i do it with\notk people\nit works out well and if i do it with\nnon-otaki people it doesn't work out\nwell\nand i want you to be really really\ncareful here about what your mind is\nprojecting on the situation versus what\nis actually reality\nyeah okay so like the first thing is\nthat if i make a decision\ni can say that this outcome was\nsub-optimal like this happens all the\ntime at healthy gamer where like\nyou know my wife and i my wife is ceo\nand sometimes we disagree on stuff\nand so just to give you like my own\nexperience maybe i'm wrong here but i'm\ncurious what you think\nso like something will happen and then\nit was my wife's decision\nand then i'll say that was a sub-optimal\noutcome if we had done what i\nsaid things would have turned out better\nbut the crazy thing is that even though\nmy mind\nsays that i don't actually know that\nbecause i actually don't have data\nabout the road not taken but my mind\nloves to think that\nwhat do you think about that i do think\nthat i base\nmost of the how how i feel about this\nparticular thing\noff of the successes i've seen when i've\nmade decisions\nuh i i as do i bro yeah like the\nso the thing with um\nthe thing with like like use my example\nof like otk for example right\ni i genuinely know that like i've\nthere's proven success with every\nindividual right and and i think that\nthat's why\nthe trust is there i think that there's\ncontrol\nin if i play like a cooperative board\ngame though\nwith my friends like friends in general\ni'm pretty much making\nevery move right and i i don't know\nsometimes you know maybe they would make\na better move uh i do agree with that\nand you know sometimes when\nthey've said uh you know like let's say\nyou know\nuse pandemic as an example again\nsometimes it's like oh yeah well what if\ni actually move here and i'm like oh\nyeah that's a pretty good line maybe you\nshould go for that\nyou know maybe i don't see all of those\nbecause i'm so\nfocused on what's going on in my head so\nnow we get to the important thing okay\nwhich is\nwhat's the consequence\nof someone else being in control outside\nof otk\nuh well i mean it depends case by case\nlike what the\ndecision we're making right um but if i\nwas\nif i was making let's say i was doing a\nshow\nfor example i was making a show and\nsomebody else would be in control\ni know that the show would be\nworse if most of the time if i wasn't\nmaking a call\nand i i do feel like i relinquish\ncontrol when\nthere are\nvery competent people involved like\ni like i'm thinking about shows where i\nhave relinquished control like\njust thinking about shows in particular\nand those are a lot of\nthe the best crews that i've ever worked\nwith i would want to work again\nand most of the the things where i was\nlike\nif i don't have control like i really do\nbelieve i'm right uh the more that i\nthink about it\nwhich you know maybe maybe i'm not uh\nyou know i'm willing to\nto dig in deeper but most of the shows\nthat i\ndon't work on anymore and didn't do\nthings the way that i wanted\nthem to be done they suck now they're\nterrible like they're either actually\nthey're not as good\nuh with so now and now rich we come to\nan interesting point right so i'm not\ndoubting your competence\ni think the main thing that i want to\npoint out to you is that like you know\nso\nso i sort of feel the same way that like\nyou know when it comes to healthy gamer\ni i feel like when we do things based on\nmy conception\nthings tend to work out well but i think\ni've managed to learn the hard way that\nyou know i had a lot of cognitive biases\nin place that would allow like my mind\nto filter information in a weird way\nwhich is just how our mind works\nour mind loves to take credit for the\nsuccesses\nand loves to blame others for the\nfailures and so you just have to be a\nlittle bit careful about that\ni agree yeah i think the main thing for\nthat that i want to share with you and i\nwant you to focus on is not so much\nabout whether taking control or not\ntaking control\nis the right decision what i want you to\nreally focus on\nis what the internal feeling is\nif you have to surrender control yeah\nyeah\num\nright because like even though it's like\nthis weird like ominous feeling\nlike like it does feel like something\nbad about so happens so and here's\nhere's the other thing i don't think you\neven really surrender control\nlike you're still in control when you\nsurrender control right\nlike you're like i'm gonna choose to put\nmy faith in otk people\nwhich is actually you still being in\ncontrol\nyeah yeah yeah\nthat that is a way that i've never\nlooked at it before and i totally agree\ni i i choose actively\nto trust those people yeah and and i\nknow that it was the right decision\nyeah yeah but you see it's still your\nchoice you're not actually surrendering\nanything\ni agree with you fully yes right it's\nlike it's like if i'm\nyou know i will let my kid i let my kid\npick whatever they want off the menu but\nlike who's actually in control there\nit's still me\nyeah yeah yeah\nso i've never i've never looked at it\nthat way before yeah so\nso what is tell me about this ominous\nfeeling right so this is the\nkey thing remember we don't want we want\nyou to be in control of yourself but i\nthink the weirdest thing is that you're\nultimately a slave to your mind so\nyou're\nyou know in in your mind wants to be in\ncontrol so what is that ominous feeling\ntell me about that\nuh it manifests in a few different ways\nuh\nthat are definitely interesting because\nlike um i actually\nreally don't get in most situations like\nnervous in a typical way\nit's definitely something that i've like\nnoticed about myself like um\ni remember one of my first really big\nshows uh for call of duty\nthe i had never been on like a stage in\nfront of people before\ncompletely sold out venue sea of faces\nlike actually like felt like i was in a\nmovie and my ifb\nbroke and i so i couldn't hear anything\ni had to hit three different marks i was\nsupposed to look at a camera before i\ngot optic gaming out on the stage\nthis is like one of my big moments you\nknow you mess up your career is over\neverything's broken i didn't feel a\nsingle ounce of stress i just got up\nthere and i did it\nand it felt incredible and i was excited\nbecause things went wrong uh i can\nremember a lot of different\ncircumstances where things went wrong\nand i did a good job and those are some\nof my best memories\num because i once again something that\nyou've aptly pointed out i won\neven though things went wrong but the\nway that it manifests in normal\nsituations\nlike if i'm just thinking by myself and\ni'm thinking something out\ni get really i feel really warm and\nuh like i just feel like really hot um\nyeah beautiful beautiful connections\nrich so let me just lay that out a\nlittle bit\nmore okay so i think you hit up you hit\nthe nail on the head i love it that i\ndidn't even have to point it out so like\nhere's the thing so i wanna i'm gonna\ntoss out a hypothesis is that rich\nlacks faith in himself why do you love\nchaos because when you're in chaos\nand everything in the world is against\nyou that's when you can get that\ndata you can see the evidence that rich\ndoesn't need to lack faith in himself\nwhen all the world is against you and\nthen you triumph\nthat is such good\nlike energy against the idea that i am a\nloser\nit's when you feel your best self when\nyou feel alive and in that moment\nyou know a hundred percent that you are\na winner you are not a loser\nit i would challenge that slightly i'm\nnot even necessarily fully disagreeing\nbut right now i feel like i have like\nalmost like a clarity of like how that\nmoment\nfeels it feels like my purpose in a\nweird way\nlike yeah and i i maybe there there's a\nportion\nof proving in there like i definitely\nthink that there is\nbut it's like those are the moments when\ni can win those are kind of the moments\nthat i live for\nand if i don't have them i am\nit's not even a self-worth thing it's\njust like i'm\nso bored and what is the [ __ ] point\nyou know what i mean\ndoes that make sense so yes so here's\nhere i i completely agree with what\nyou're saying i think the proving is\ngoing to come in a second but\ni think in those moments you're kind of\nin this flow state and i think that's\nwhen you're actually\nthe closest to your truest self\nyeah yeah right right so that's when\nlike you were put\non this earth to do particular things\nand\nthe person who can handle the ifb broken\nand hitting three marks and not like\nthat's you baby it's like everything\nthat you were born for\ni can get behind that a hundred percent\ni can get that it's your purpose\nso then that begs the really weird\nquestion\nif you can thrive when there's chaos\naround you\nwhy the [ __ ] do you need to control\nanything\nbecause i know\nall of those situations that are they're\nnot\nnatural and one day i'm not gonna have\nthem and then i feel like\neven with the money even with like all\nof these things i won't have anything\nbecause one day i won't be\nplay by play casting anymore or hosting\nanymore right i've already slightly\nmoved away from that\none day i won't be in like these\nscenarios of extreme stress\nlike and then what am i going to do you\nknow what i mean am i just going to sit\non\nlike a beach and people you know what i\nmean like\ni think that that's what i'm scared of\ni'm scared of like losing my\npurpose i think which i've never thought\nof it that way before but now i feel\nlike\nthat's what it feels like to me like\nit's not even um it's not even like\nthe i do like the attention of the job i\ndefinitely do but it's not even that\nlike i felt um\ni used to there was like a week before i\nfell into being on screen talent\nwhere i was doing i was running the\ngraphics and that felt good too\nbecause if i spelled something wrong if\ni hit the wrong button\nall these things i could ruin the show\nand like that pressure\nfelt super good and\ni don't know what i would do if i don't\nhave\nthese high moments of pressure where i\nfeel like everything can\nexplode if i don't do everything right\nokay so this is going to require like\nsome very very fine tweezers\nokay rich so first of all awesome i i\nreally think it's cool to hear you say\nthat you're kind of noticing that\nit's sort of about purpose and all that\nkind of good stuff i think that the the\nthe tricky thing here is that there's a\nlot of genuineness\nthere's a lot of goodness and i still\nthink it's sort of wrapped by like other\nweird things\nso the first is is that like you know\nyou\nfear being bored which i can kind of get\nbut like i don't know how to say this to\nyou but\nso in a very practical sense i think you\nshould structure your life\nover being what i would call a vata\nwhich means that like\ni think you're going to be the most\nsuccessful and feel the most fulfilled\nwhen what you do is not the same every\nsingle day\nand requires a lot of thoroughness\nfollow through in energy\nand the other part of me says so like i\nthink it's good to think about how\nyou're\nkind of like that's the situation which\nyou thrive so that's the life you should\ncultivate for yourself\nabsolutely at the same time i think\nyou're doing it a little bit blind\nbecause like sometimes you know you're\nrebelling against authority and like\nsometimes you're like craving chaos and\nlike there are other things like you\nshould like see a doctor and all this\nkind of crap\nand so i think sort of the the boredom\naversion\nis different from trying to cultivate\nthe kind of life that you thrive in\nyeah i agree with you i i think like as\ni'm like looking at it more deeply too\nlike\nthe right right in that split second\nbefore you started\nspeaking i i thought to myself it's like\nwait\nwhy are you like why are you so afraid\nof\nof being bored and i feel like um\nit comes back to kind of what you said\nwhen you were speaking you said\nsomething about how it's\nwrapped up in these weird things and\nit comes back to identity again i i\nthink that\nliving my life in like this state of\nchaos\ni feel like that's a part of who i am\num i like yeah i\nfeel like it it always comes back to\nidentity and\nrich yeah who will you be if you're\nsitting alone on a beach\nsipping a beverage i actually do\nhave such a huge ego that i still do\nbelieve i will feel like i am the [ __ ]\nbecause i'll think about all the other\nstuff and be like oh these are all the\nother things i can be doing\nand i can have a full russian novel\ngoing on in my head where i just go back\nand forth\nwith myself like i'm [ __ ] calling but\nthe\nbut i do think that um there are\nthere have been times where i got really\nsad\nthinking about not doing the certain\nthings so i i'll go back\nand try not to put up a wall again the\nsecond that you said it and say it maybe\ni don't know\nyes so see that that's the interesting\nthing right because like you fear\nboredom but then i\nask you what would it be like if you\nwere actually there and you're like oh\nit would be totally fine\nyeah well i think i think that i just\nlike pushed back probably\nwell so so possibly right so maybe the\nthe wrong thing was the pushback but\nmaybe\nactually i think the wrong thing is your\nfear of boredom that's what's not rooted\nin reality\ni think you would actually be fine being\non a beach yeah\nmaybe i i think it's your fear of\nboredom that's actually not rooted in\nreality\nlike you believe it you have a good\nreason to believe it don't get me wrong\nyour mind learned to fear boredom\nand what i'm sort of hearing if i had to\nlike kind of try to tie it together in a\nnice bow which by all means you know\nmodify it tell me i'm wrong whatever\nis that like you've developed this\nidentity as the guy who's\nclutch yeah and if there's no\nsituation for you to be clutching\nyou're a no one yeah and so like\nyou don't wanna i mean chaos like you\ngotta you gotta like mess\nyou gotta you know keep things cause\nlike that's who you can be when you say\nyou were on this earth\nto like be in this situation and shine\nwhen like\n99 out of 100 people would fail that's\nwho you are\nyeah yeah yeah and so if you're bored\nlike then who are you\nyou're just and i still haven't really\ndug into this but i think\nyou're you go back to becoming who you\nwere before you were this person which\nis something you do not want\nyeah yeah yeah yeah we haven't even\ntalked about it yeah you touched on it\nso well and it's not like um\ni i'm never like it\nis really really focused on me like\ni do a really good job of not comparing\nmyself to other people which is\nsomething that i'm proud of about who i\nam\nlike for example with my stream i've\nalways been happy with my stream for\nexample but\nall of my friends are like the biggest\nstreamers on the platform and i'm not\nbut i'm happy with what i have uh so\nthat's something that i'm really\ngood at dealing with you know and in any\nstation in life i'm like i feel\nfortunate with with what i have\nbut if you take away those little things\nabout\nlike the the things that you've\nmentioned about yeah like\ni feel like i almost need to get [ __ ] on\nand beat it to feel good and i\nyeah i i i think i i'm like trying to\neven piece it together because i\ndo feel like you've worded it so well i\nfeel like i seek that cycle because\nthat's who i\nam and i almost don't even know if i\ndon't want to be that person\nyeah yeah i i don't yeah we desynced\nagain do you mind just reconnecting\nuh yeah sure one sec\nall right let me make sure perfect we're\ngood so so here's\nso well well done rich well done i think\nit's it's it\ni think you know i think what you're\nsaying makes a lot of sense to me it's\nreally cool\nto hear you kind of say that so let me\ntry to tie things up a little bit okay\nso i think the issue here is that like\nyou kind of said\nyou you know and and now we sort of\nunderstand your resistance right this\nwhole like\nthis whole branch of our conversation\nstarted off when i said something about\nlike\nchanging who you are and there was a\npart of you that's like uh-uh\nyeah you don't want that right and and\nnow this is where like i don't know if\nwe have time to really dig into this but\ni think that you're good\nin not comparing yourself to other\npeople\nbut i think you have so what i'm what\ni'm hearing a lot of is\nidentity there's a lot about identity\nahamkara is the sanskrit word\nand the ahamkara always compares\nand so the tricky thing is you say i\ndon't compare myself to other people i\ncompletely agree\ni think what you do is probably if i had\nto hypothesize we don't really know but\njust\nunderstanding the am guard what you do\nis compare yourself to the previous you\nyeah there's the rich and uh i would\neven go a step further because i fully\nagree with you\ni think i compare myself to\nmy perceived self-actualized self\ntoo and i i constantly compare myself to\nthat\nand that's where i feel failure at times\nif i don't live up to that\nso and and now we get to sort of like\nthe weird ass punch line which is that\nlike\nthe you of the past that you're trying\nto no longer be\nand the you of the future that you're\ntrying to become through these moments\nof chaos and self-actualization and\nfeeling like you\nexist on this world for a reason all of\nthose are false\nyou are just you yeah\nright and this is where like it also\nseems like you don't experience a whole\nlot of shame\nbut i would venture that you probably\nneed to learn how to\nbecause i think part of like what's\ndifficult about this is that\nyou know i think i get the sense that\nyou're really struggling\nand you're terrified of becoming\nsomething that\nyou know you're like running away from\nlike being you call it being bored i\ndon't know what that is but like\nyeah you know you know losing your\nidentity and all that good\ngood business but the interesting thing\nis that i don't actually think you're\nlying when you say you would be fine\nsitting on a beach\nbecause i think like rich i have faith\nin the person that you\nare like you are that thing no one can\ntake it away from you\nyou are what you are and nothing can\ntake it away from you whether you're\npenniless or rich like sure you don't\nwant to be penniless and you have to\nwork on you know put\nstocking stuff away and and things like\nthat but i think at the end of the day\nlike what you\nare is what you are your character is\nyour character you are yourself\nyou don't need to like you talk about\nbeing a self-actualized version you know\nyou\nstrive towards being a self-actualized\nversion where whereas i think you know\nthat in those moments when the ifb goes\nout you\nare you're self-actualized like you're\nthe perfect version of yourself\nbut what happens when i don't have those\nanymore\nright like those that's the thing that\ni'm tied to so rich\nrich as long as you have those things\nyour sense of self will be tied to those\nthings\nhow can you develop confidence in\nyourself if i if i\neat burritos every day and then i say to\nmyself what am i going to eat if there\nare no more burritos\ni have to stop buying burritos and see\nwhat happens\nthat's when i discover confidence in who\ni am\nyeah well so so just to talk about that\nfurther\nyou know buying burritos every day it's\nlike\nwhat do you need to set up your reality\nto be able to eat burritos every day is\nthat your favorite thing to do\nyou need to make uh you need to have a\njob where you can make\n8.95 the abouts like every single day\nso you get the job then you eat burritos\nevery day and that's what you do\nuh for me i like the\ni feel the most alive and like love\nthe situations when [ __ ] goes wrong and\nit's much harder to create a reality\nwhere you can do that every day right\nso you need to you need to either get\nhired for a bunch of shows and do that\nevery single day\nand not be fully in control uh or you\ncan create an entire company that makes\nshows\nuh every single day so you can be a part\nof those shows every single day which\ni'm realizing i did\nabsolutely and is it bad to try to have\nthat much control over the world\nto create the reality that you want to\nlive in or is it a good thing\nuh that depends on whether you want to\nchange\nyeah yeah right so i i don't i don't i\nthink you've done a wonderful job of\ncultivating the life in which you thrive\ni'm not saying throw that life away\nbut what i'm saying is that your\nidentity as long as you derive your\nidentity from\nshining in moments of chaos your\nidentity will be based upon shining\nin those moments of chaos and you will\nbecome dependent on shining in\nthose moments of chaos it is only very\nshallow\nit's like it's absolutely full yes right\nso so\nthe crazy thing is that i'm telling you\nbro i have faith that if you don't\nhave those shining moments of chaos you\nwill discover\nthat you are still yourself and that you\ndon't\nneed those things and when you don't\nneed those things anymore\nthen you will be in control and your\nmind won't\nbecause right now your mind is like oh\nmy god what will i become\nunless i have these moments of chaos\nand so then it you you're hungry and you\ncan't control it right like\nyou're you're cultivating you're\ncreating this thing this thing this\nthing this thing this thing\nand you're looking at all of this like\ntrain wreck of the rest of your life\nwhere you're like ordering finasteride\noff the internet\nand can't find a doctor and like won't\npay your bills or whatever and what i'm\ntelling you is that like\nin order to discover who you truly are\nyou need to see\nwhat is common in all of these different\nscenarios instead of recreating the same\nscenario\nover and over and over again yeah\nyeah it almost reminds me of my patients\nwho like wind up in abusive\nrelationships over and over and over\nagain because it's like\nthey're like this is i know i can\nsurvive this and they look for the same\nkind of\nlike subconscious signals with abusive\npartners and they get abused\nover and over and over again and the\nmost terrifying thing to them i'm\ntelling you\nif you talk to them most terrifying\nthing is if they start dating someone\nwho's like really caring\nand is like genuinely a nice person and\nthen they just get really confused and\ntheir\nmind is waiting for the other shoe to\ndrop because in their entire life\nthey've never been with a nice person\nand then what they end up doing is\n[ __ ] self-sabotaging\nbecause they're like this person can't\nreally be this nice because the five\npeople i've dated before\nhave always turned out nasty and the\nnicer they are the nastier they are\nand then they run across someone who's\ngenuinely a good person they're like\nwhen is the toxicity going to start when\nis the toxicity going to start they get\nparanoid they get uncomfortable\nand they like pull out of the\nrelationship yeah\nand then they engage with the sixth\nperson who is not nice\nand then it becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy\nand so what's happening with you is like\nit's becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy\nwhere\nyou only are alive in moments of chaos\nwhich i completely agree that's your\nbest self\nbut i think that your best self your\ncarry with you all the time\nyeah yeah i i think it's funny kind of\nthe\nthe idea that you put it's almost like\nyou know i always think of uh\nmiss havisham in the wedding dress you\nknow just like holding on to like those\nthat that best moment like holding on to\nthat one thing and just being the old\nlady until you fall into the fire\ni i do feel like in a lot of ways it's\nit's me and my\nmy caster suit holding a mic and just\nlike i'll tell you about my\nmy story uh and yeah i agree that it's\nnot only me and it's\nthe the relationship with control is\nreally weird right\nbecause even with the it's like that\nrush\neven with gambling right it's like\nsomewhat out of my control\nbut even if i lose i feel like i'm\nwinning and i'm always trying to keep\ntrack of it\nyeah i think that those are kind of\nprobably the biggest things that i need\nto change\ni i agree uh\nwell for the record i'm not saying you\nneed to change them\ni'm just saying what i want yeah i want\nto right\nuh it's something you've got to decide\nwhether you want to start to see because\nlike\nhere's the thing i mean i could point\nout to you rich half a dozen moments\nwhere\nyou weren't thriving through chaos and\nyou were still an\nawesome best self right like i\nand and we've heard them i think\nespecially if you look to things like\nyour family and stuff like those are not\nyou know like like if we think about the\nrelationship you have with your parents\nit doesn't sound like there's much chaos\nanymore but i still think you're\nyou're your best self with them i i\ndon't know\ni i don't know i think i i think i could\nbe better i think that um\ni think that like when there's a problem\ni'm always there and\ni don't think i focus as much on the the\nthe times when there isn't a problem\nuh so yeah so i do so rich\nwhat are you gonna do about that\num i i've often said that i'm going to\nto call them more and be there more i\neven\nyou know like help them\nget uh their because they're at risk\nhelp them get their\num their cold vaccine so i would feel\nsafe for visiting them soon\num but then usually what happens when i\nsay that i'm gonna call them more is\nsomething super chaotic happens and then\nit gets my attention\nand i deal with it and then i don't talk\nto them as much as i want to\nthere's the dog off the leash right\nso so i think the key takeaway here so\nthis is where like normally\nwhat i feel like doing is asking you to\ncall them today\nwhich is good but at the same time i\nthink the most important thing is to\nrecognize that sometimes you want to do\nthings\nand who's in control is the dog in\ncontrol\nor are you in control and notice that\nwhen something chaotic happens your mind\nis going to want to run towards it at\nfull speed\nyeah i mean like even even like the the\nsecond that you said call them today i\nwas like i can't\nlike the second that you said it like it\njust just instantly i was like no i\ncan't\nand then i don't know why i like i\ngenuinely don't know why\nand then i rationalized and thought of\nuh\nlike four different calls that i have\ntoday see like four different discord\nmessages that i know i need to attend to\num and i don't know why just instantly\nbecause\ni definitely feel like even if i try to\nslow down the way that my brain just\nworked i think that i\nrationalized and made up a bunch of\nthings that i not made up but i\ni rationalized found a bunch of things\nthat i had to do uh\nbut instantly the second that you say\ncall them today i just when i can't in\nmy head yep\nyep so you've also discovered another\nimportant thing so\nthere's a relationship between your ego\nand your intellect\nand the funny thing is that your ego\nbullies your intellect and comes up with\nrationalizations\nthe feeling comes first and then your\nego goes to your intellect and is hey\negos or emotions are going to your\nintellect and saying i don't want to\ncall mom and dad today\ncome up with good reasons that i can\njustify not calling them\nbut if you pay attention to your\nresponse the i\ncan't comes first and the reasons come\nafter and then we think logically i\ncan't but that's not the order of\noperations\nit's not you think about all the things\nyou need to do oh by the way i can't\ncall them\nthe i can't call them comes first and\nthe rationalization comes after\nso the question is what how do you feel\nwhen i\nask you to call them i i don't know why\ni just instantly said i can't\nand it was emotional like i i know that\nit was\nand i don't know why like i i\nam i lazy like what's going on it's not\nlazy\nlazy is lazy is an umbrella term that we\nuse when we don't have good diagnostic\ninformation\nyeah um i can toss out a couple of\nthings\nare you afraid that is there some\nnegativity hanging between you and your\nparents like\nare you afraid that like your dad is\ngonna think about the money he owes you\nand things like that and it's gonna go\ndown that route and like what are you\ntrying to avoid\nby not calling them there's a million\nthings that i could be trying to avoid\nbut none of them pop up right like\num like uh\nmaybe maybe it's guilt but i feel like i\ndo this with multiple\nthings not just the parents thing too so\nthere could be different reasons for all\nof them i mean with my parents\num\nmaybe there maybe there's a level of\nguilt maybe there's there are things\nthat i'm trying to avoid with\num i i don't know i\nbut some of those problems that would be\ncausing the guilt are always\nalso the things that make me\nactually call you know what i mean yeah\nso so this is where this is where\ni think at the end of the day rich i i\nmean maybe we can dig into this but i\nthink it could take some time so i'm\ngoing to leave you with one or two\nhypotheses and i'm going to leave you\nwith a plan\nso the most important thing in this\nmoment rich is not to figure out why you\ncan't call them\nthe most important thing is to recognize\nthat your mind is\nsaying one thing and you have to make a\nchoice whether you're going to let it be\nin control or whether you're going to be\nin control\nyeah that's the most important thing\nnotice\nthat like this is the problem the world\ncan't actually compete against you rich\nyou\nown the world all the time you dumpster\nit right and left\ntrue true right your biggest enemy is\nyourself\nyeah yeah and so like that's like that's\nthe battle you have to fight so like\neven though you don't want to and you\ncan't figure out the reason\nyou know like we can go down that road i\nsuspect it has something to do with\nshame to be honest because i think that\nthere's a\nthere's a noticeable absence of shame in\nall of what you're saying\nand and like i think it could be\nsomething weird like protecting your\nparents from the shame of like\nthat you know is going to happen if you\ncall them because\nevery time you call like you're going to\nwant to give them money\nand you're going to want to help them\nand your dad isn't going to want to\naccept it\nand like that whole mess is like so hard\nto navigate that like it just makes you\nnot want to\ncall yeah i i don't know maybe\nthe shame thing's interesting uh the the\nthing is though is like i\ni genuinely do believe that my parents\nare just overwhelmingly proud\nso i don't even know even if they do\npush that away if they would experience\nshame\nand i do think that it's weird that\nwhen you bring up shame i can't think of\na single time where i've\nexperienced shame which is weird\ni can't it's very time i've ever i've\nbecause usually when people are homeless\nthey experience a little bit of shame\nusually when people grow up poor and\nthey walk into their friend's place and\ntheir friend\nhas a painting which they read about on\nthe internet they feel a little bit\nshamed\nusually when people are like grew up\nbroke and have parents who work at flea\nmarkets\nand you get on a private jet of your\nbody in college you feel a little bit of\nshame\nlike usually it's gotta be somewhere in\nthere\nand there's a conspicuous absence of it\nand because they're proud they don't\nfeel shame on the contrary\nshame and pride are like two opposite\nthere's two sides of the same coin\nright the pride is the reaction to the\nshame it's the protection against the\nshame\nyeah your dad i can't even think of a\ntime that i've been\nextremely prideful because\nwhen i've needed to i do think that i\nhave accepted help the help thing is\nlike where i'm trying to look now\nbecause of the shame thing\nbut like i received help from a friend\nand i know if i didn't receive that help\nand i don't feel bad about it i don't\nfeel any shame about it if i didn't\nreceive that help i probably wouldn't\neven be where i'm at today\nnow i'm thankful for it you know i'll do\nyeah i i think the two aren't mutually\nexclusive because i think there are\nmoments where you're closer to the\ntrue rich and there are moments where\nthere's like this other weird\nrich you know this this i don't know\nwhat else to call it but like i'm just\ngonna call it like you know the\nloser rich or the poor rich or the\nhomeless rich like there's something\nthere's something about like you know\nand i think you even fear even when we\ntalk about the money\nyou fear being that rich again and the\nreason that you\nbut i i'm sorry to cut you off dr k\nthere's this thing that\nthough like where i'm still so proud of\nthat like that there is a\ni am proud of the fact that i was\nhomeless\nwhere i think you know most people would\nfeel shame like no i\nlook i that i did that was my chapter\nthat was one of my challenges\nand what's on the opposite side of the\ncoin from prison that that's that's\nyeah there you go like that that's issue\nbut i am proud of it and\ndo see identity with it so absolutely\nyeah\nand i think it's it's neither something\nit's not something to be\nat the end of the day it's not something\nto be proud of or ashamed of it's just\nit's just what you are\nright like it's like actually just a\npiece of you and it's not like good or\nbad\nbut i i think it makes i really found a\nlittle bit of the pride right like\nyeah but but i i think it's it's\ninteresting because developmentally what\ni'm also hearing is that like you\nweren't\nyou don't really even know what shame\nlooks like yeah\nand that's probably because like you\nsaid when you know when when you call\nyour parents you're like\nthey're so proud i don't even know if\nthey know how to feel shame so i think\nyou're\nyou grew up con\nlearning how to convert shame into pride\nit's going to be heads every single flip\neven though the details is right\nunderneath like\nit's just how your your family like\nfunctioned right\nand so there's something about like i\ndon't know why but like i don't think\nyou are not\ncalling them because of your fear i\nthink you're\na loving son i think you're a protective\nson\nand i think the reason that you don't\ncall them is for their sake\nnot for yours\nwhy don't you call them rich why don't\nyou\ncall them today i i think i think that i\nthink that i will\nbut i i'm trying to think why my my\nknee-jerk reaction was to\nto say no right and\ni i when you say that i'm doing it to\nprotect them i do feel like a little bit\nof anger\ninsinuating that they need me to protect\nthem so i do think that maybe that\nthat reaction shows that maybe there is\na level of\nuh maybe you're right uh because\neven you saying that i'm like they don't\nneed me to protect it like\ni'm protect i'm protecting them from you\nsaying that they need to be protected\nabsolutely right\nit makes me angry that if you said\nsomething negative about me yeah yeah\nit's weird right\nyeah very well done by the way i mean\nlike i said\ni mean i noticed at the beginning i\nthought you were pretty insightful but\ndamn sound like you just\nyou just did it usually i have to walk\npeople through that\nright like that noticing of like oh crap\nlike how dare you say they need to be\nprotected\nthey don't need to be protected yeah and\nin doing so you protect them\nyeah right it's interesting\nyeah yeah it's definitely interesting\nand i i think that\nit's funny because i i think uh a lot of\nwhat i do\neven when i'm doing stuff online too\nbecause it's like it's easier uh and you\nfeel like much more\ni think most people who watch anything i\ndo online would probably think that i'm\nlike an absolute idiot which is fun like\ni like doing that you know i'll go on\ni'll say my poop jokes and you know that\nthat's\nthat's what i do feel like made some\npeople happy uh\neven when um when i'm hosting\nusually i will pretend that i don't know\nvery much\nabout the game right because i know\nthat what people need to hear like the\nthe actual thing that people\nneed to hear uh because they will\nrespect it the most\nis the player the analyst saying these\nthings about the game\nso i'll play dumb and i'll have them say\nthe things that need to be said even\nthough i know what they're going to say\nalready\nand i feel in control with it and i'm\nfine to to play the clown\nand get it out there but there you are\nteeing other people up for success\nwhich works for hosting right i think\nthat that's the entire thing of the job\nbut i don't really have many outlets\nwhere i talk to people about\nwhat's going on in my head also because\ni don't ever want to burden people with\nit\num like uh like even with um\nlike if i if i'm dating somebody or\nsomething like that i won't tell them if\nanything's going wrong\ni i like i won't um\nso i i know that that's that's a thing\nthere as well and the only people that\ni'll ever like\nreally go into\nmaybe like crazy details about what's\ngoing on my head are probably\nlike asthma and tips again sure yeah\nyeah i think i'm noticing that there are\nsome people you let into the circle\nand once they're in the circle there are\nno authority issues there are no control\nissues\nthere's no issues of help and pride and\nshame and\nall that kind of stuff it's like there\nare people that get to see the real you\nyou get to be the real you with them\nand it sounds like your parents are\nactually outside of that circle\nyeah yeah um they they didn't even know\nthat\num i didn't have a place to stay when i\nwas in new york i lied\nthey they don't know half half of the\nyeah why did you lie\nbecause i didn't want them to know and i\ndidn't want them to feel like they\nfailed me\ni i know that i i know that yeah\nyeah look look at this main tank over\nhere\nyeah right tanking everything taunting\neverything gotta protect mom and dad\ncan't let them get aggro can't let them\nknow that you know\nthey raised a son who's struggling\nyeah um i do feel like that\nthat maybe one of the the failures with\nthat too is i i feel like um\na lot of people in my life probably feel\nlike an absence because of it of me\nyep for sure yeah\nso rich i think you should call them\nand i'm gonna equip you with one thing\nthat\nto so if your dad brings up the money\nand says i'm gonna pay you back\ni want you to ask him a question and\nand this que the question is can you\nhelp me understand\nwhy you need to pay me back yeah\nright and and i think you guys need to\nget\neventually to a conversation about like\ndoes family\nowe each other things i i i\ninstantly hear his voice in my head like\ni just instantly\nuh like hear him talking about\nwe're your parents we do everything for\nyou\nwhy would we you know like yes like i\ncan literally hear him\nin in my head my father's very uh\nmy father's like a very rough person\nat times like with how he speaks but\nthen also like incredibly\nsmooth talker randomly i he'd know that\nthis is something that he will handle in\nthat very\nhead-on gruff manner like i can hear his\naccent even in my head like like the\nphilly accent would come out\nand all of a sudden you know it would\nyeah yeah\nyeah so then i think the next question\nis like he's like oh you know\nwe're your parents and we take care of\nyou\nand and then this is where you can kind\nof say like\nare you sure about that or like how does\nit feel\nto like be up you know to\nkind of essentially what i'm hearing is\nthat he views himself as a failure of a\nparent and how can you guys have a\nconversation\naround um\nyou know that you just don't see it that\nway\ndoes it have to be that way is that what\nparents have to do yeah and\nand how can you explain to him and you\ncan even say this and you can say that\nyou know dad you guys have given me so\nmuch\nyou've given me so much like i don't\nknow how to explain to you that\nyou've given me so much that\nlike the money is like it means so\nlittle to me compared to everything that\nyou've done for me\nit's so funny when you said that like i\ngot so [ __ ] mad\nwhen when you said like called my dad\nlike like saying that he might feel that\nway like i can't even say it\nand it reminded me of two things that i\ndidn't remember\ni tried to talk to a therapist when i\nwas in college uh one time and i got a\nhuge fight with him\nand left and i never did it again i\nactually forgot\nuh until right now and then uh\ni remember that when we lost the house\nmy dad and i had a conversation just me\nand him\nand i i remembered he actually said\nthose\nwords and uh and cried\nuh uh to me and yeah\ni i haven't thought about that i was\nprobably 17\nand yeah i haven't really thought about\nthat uh\ni kind of forgot that it happened\nyeah yeah so you know that's how we know\nwe're moving in the right direction\nyeah yeah right so when i say things and\nthey trigger responses i i hope i didn't\nyou know i i hope it didn't cause you\ntoo much pain i mean i had a feeling it\nwould cause you some pain and i did it\ni just got mad at you for a second you\ngot really mad at it\nyeah yeah right so so that means that\nthere's like so anger is a protective\nemotion\nanger is like the main tank of the mind\nit protects us from things like shame\nand hurt\nand fear and and other things because\nanger especially for men like\nwe're basically allowed or taught to\nexpress one emotion which is anger\nit's the only socially acceptable\nemotion it's the only one that we're\ngiven any kind of training on\nand so the rest of it is all a blur and\neverything just kind of turns into anger\nbut i i think rich like here's what i\nwould say i think we should probably\nwrap up and we can talk about meditation\nif you want to but\ni do think that um it feels important to\nme or i place a value\non you like having some of these\nconversations with your dad like you\ndon't have to go very deep\nbut i think it's important even if he\nresists your signal or feels like he's\nnot\naccepting it i think it's important for\nhim\nto receive in some even if he bats it\naway\nfor him to hear from you that you think\nhe did a good job\nyeah i'm trying to think i feel like\ntoo i do say that a lot\nand i'm trying to think of the best way\nto make sure that he really\ndoes know you know and this is this is\nhard but like what you have to do is sit\nlike what you want to do is oddly enough\nlike kind of evoke the shame\nand in a weird way like the worse he\nfeels about\nhimself that's\nwhen he needs to hear it right like you\nneed to see him at his lowest point\nand then accept him in spite of that\nright it's sort of like and i know it\nsounds kind of weird but just drawing a\nconnection like\nwhen that roommate bought you the 2 000\ncomputer like\nit means the most when it's the least\nexpected\nand when you feel like who is this guy\nlike i don't deserve this this person\ndoesn't need to do this\nand that's when it's the most impactful\nyeah yeah it's just like one of those\nweird things where it's like uh\ni don't want him to get to them the the\nlike the bad spot\nyou know absolutely yeah so i think you\nprotect him a lot\nyeah yeah right so so anyway i mean i i\nthink\nyou start with a phone call if you can\nif you can't\nif you can't call them that's actually\nokay too just do your best to collect\ninformation\nabout like what is it within you that\nsays you can't\nand i think you can yeah okay so the\nmore you understand yourself like the\nbetter you'll you'll be and\ni think you and your dad will get there\ni'm sure you and your mom and your\nsister\nand whatnot like you guys have hopefully\nhave some time right so if you work at\nit\ni have faith that you'll get there how\ndo you feel about\nmeditation um it's\nsomething that i've always said that i\nwould do\nand uh it's it's it's a tomorrow thing\nyou know\nit's like yeah tomorrow i'll get to it i\ni've thought about it\nuh many times yeah so do you want to do\nit today or you want to do it tomorrow\num i know i think if i\ni think if i do it tomorrow it'll be the\nnext tomorrow and the next tomorrow\nagain so should probably just do it\ntoday yeah\nokay now um i'm gonna try to give you\na technique that is uh let me just think\nabout what technique to give you\nsomething so i feel like doing something\na little bit more\num physical or in nature so i think some\nkind of like chanting\nis gonna be good so i don't want you to\ndo something that's a very cerebral\ntechnique\nokay because like chances are like\nyou're about that mind like you're a\nlittle\nbit 80d i think it could be a little bit\nharder for you\nso i want you to do something that's\ngoing to be very experiential\nokay and may also be challenging i'm\nleaning towards\noh hmm\nlet me just think for a second i wonder\nif i'm underestimating you\njust thinking a little bit about how you\nrise to the challenge\nhold on\nwhat do you want to work on tell me that\ni i think like the\ni i actually like so i went around and i\ni\nstudied religion for a little while to\ntry to figure out\nstuff like during college and there was\nthis one\nthing that a rabbi told me that i always\nthought was\nexactly what i would want to get out of\nmeditation he said uh\nyou know like the the practice of\nrapping\nto fill in where they basically they\nthey wrap\num like uh basically like a prayer box\naround their head and then\nseven times they wrap around their arms\nand the thought process to it\nis if you control your your thoughts\nand if you can control it's seven to\nsupposed to represent like the seven\nuh primary emotions i believe uh and if\nyou can control your emotions\nit's on the left hand because it's\nsupposed to be close to your heart then\nyou're completely in control of your\nlife\nand i once again i notice i'm getting\nback to control but\ni always thought that if i could\nmeditate\nand actually be able to think on my\nthoughts and why i'm thinking about\nthings\nand control my emotions that's always\nwhat i wanted to get out of meditation\nand my version of meditation is\nsitting and thinking really really fast\nright now so i probably would need to\nslow down as well\nand i think that the assessment that\nmaybe something more physical\nmight be wise is probably correct\nbecause like right now i have my own\nversion of meditation which is uh\nlike sitting in my bed looking out at\nthe city\nand having like my own version of it\nlike\nmoffat sherlock holmes episode in my\nhead uh where i'm just my mind's like\nall over the place\nso i'm leaning towards actually so i\nthink i'm going to pick the thing that i\ndon't think is the best for you\ni'm going to pick the thing that you\nwant instead of picking the thing that\nyou need\nand and what i actually want to teach\nyou what what my heart tells me to teach\nyou\nis different from my head my head says\nthis guy needs like a solid grounding\ntechnique that sort of like balances his\nmind and like\nputs himself into the present will help\nhim discover his true self and like\nwill help him recognize his emotions i\nwant to teach you something that\nkind of clears your mind so that in the\nvacuum of your mind some of these more\nsuppressed emotions can come up\nthat's what i want to teach you that's\nwhat i think i should teach you but\nactually that's what i should teach you\nbut what i want to teach you is actually\na more intensive practice that may\nactually be a little bit harder\nthat's actually designed to give you\nawareness\nand it's designed to give you insight\nand intuition\nand i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike i think rich you're like you've\ncome\nso far on your own i want to equip you\nwith a tool that me that you're not\ngoing to need anyone you can just do\nthis\nand you'll do all the discovery you need\nto on your own how does that sound\nsounds good it's going to be harder\nthough okay\nokay so i'm going to teach you a\ntechnique called charging the laser beam\nokay that's what twitch chat calls it\nokay so he did this technique and then\nlike\ni was asking someone you know how does\nit feel and they said it feels like\ncharging a laser beam\nso the tricky thing is that there there\ncould be a very slight physical\nsensation it's not going to be intense\nbut i'm going to just essentially can\nyou sit up straight\nyeah and can you take off your cap and\nyour glasses\nyep okay all right i can't see at all\nthat's okay you don't need i mean can\nyou see vaguely\nyeah yeah so so what i'm going to do is\ni'm going to take this so just give me\nthe middle finger\nyes no no no no so this is\nso we unfortunately have to use the\nmiddle finger but so you know between my\neyebrows\nthere's like a point where kind of my\neyebrows meet and there's an area just\nkind of right above it yeah\nlike right there oh good yeah okay so\nwhat i'm going to do is take my middle\nfinger and i'm going to hover it\nover that point okay not touching\nand then i'm going to close my eyes\nand i want you to just feel the\nsensation right\nthere where your finger is hovering do\nyou feel anything\nyeah yeah kinda what does it feel like\nwell sometimes i'm like accidentally\ntouching\nso move further away and then i like\nkind of think about like what that feels\nlike it's like\num it's like a little blue fuzzy dome\nyep okay good so i think it helps so\nlook at me open your eyes\nso you have your finger pointing this\nway i want you to go like this right so\npointing into it yep a little bit higher\nand then are you reluctant to use your\nmiddle finger\nyeah i want to flip you off yeah you're\nflipping yourself off\nright yeah so so try to find that brain\ncentral point and i want you to kind of\nlike pull a little bit\npull further away okay and then you can\nkind of go\nin or out just a little bit until you\nfind the sensation if that makes sense\noh yeah you got it right it's weird\nright so like\nyou're kind of like past the blue fuzzy\ndome and then you're kind of like\ntouching the blue fuzzy dome\nbut yeah so i want you to just focus on\nthat we're gonna do this for about 60\nseconds\nand i'll guide you as to what to do next\nbut i want you to just focus on that\nsensation\nokay you you got that sensation\nyeah yeah yeah okay so eyes closed go\nahead and relax your hands\njust yeah just bring it down let your\neyes stay closed and i want you to still\nfocus on that point though\nand i'm gonna give you a couple of\ndifferent options one is when you take a\ndeep breath i want you to feel that cold\nair come\nin your nose kind of imagine that breath\ngoing up your nose and into that point\nsome people may even feel like a slight\ncooling sort of swirly sensation kind of\nin their\nupper sinus\nand then the second thing you can try is\nto sort of like\ndrive your attention into that point\nalmost as if you're like\ncognitive energy is like kind of\ndrilling into it\ni feel way more when i do that yep and\nthen i just want you to drill baby\njust drill we'll do that for about\nanother minute\nso your mind may wander you may have\nthoughts i'm thinking about way too many\nthings right now i'm really trying not\nto\nno that's okay so let those thoughts go\nand return to the drilling\nyou don't want to push them away you\ndon't want to keep them out just return\nto the sensation of the drilling if you\ncan\nif you lose the sensation you can return\nto using your finger\nnow go ahead and relax a little bit let\nyour attention go\nrelax your eyebrows deep breath in and\nout\nall right we're coming back it's march\n17th\n2021 rich campbell\nbadass that you are\nall the things you have to do today oh\ngod\nsee all the thoughts come rushing back\nyeah\nyou're returning to the world welcome\nhi i think i'm bad at that\ni definitely think i need to practice no\nyou're not bad you're very good\ni thought about like about a billion\ndifferent things you know how you know\nyou're good\noh when i said come back what did you\nsay\noh god oh yeah when you said yeah when\nyou said all the things you have to do\ntoday yeah\nright so so so what that means is that\nwhat is the oh god that's\nall of that stuff rushing back into your\nmind\nin order for you to get hit in order for\nyou to get hit by it and say oh god that\nmeans it wasn't in your mind\ntrue true right so let me explain one or\ntwo things you're not bad at meditation\nyou're very good at it should you\npractice absolutely\nbut i want you to you guys to understand\nthis so like\neach time if you tell your mind to\nconcentrate on a point and it wanders\naway\nand you bring your mind back that is\nlike doing one push-up\nand so the more your mind wanders and\nthe more you bring it back\nactually the more the better you're\ndoing\nyou're doing like 10 push-ups 20\npush-ups 30 push-ups 40 push-ups 50\npush-ups\nso like it doesn't you can't be bad at\nit yeah i did a lot of push-ups\nthat's so good so so is doing is doing\nlots of push-ups\nbad no it's good get you where you're\ngoing\nyeah right and so i know it sounds kind\nof weird but even despite your\nperception that you had lots of thoughts\ni still think you did a good job at\npushing most of your day away\nyeah i was i thought about some old\nrandom stuff i don't know where\nyeah so that's that's the vacuum right\nso like here's the thing\nwhen you push your day away then you've\ngot like this vacuum in your mind where\nrandom crap is going to come up\nbut that's how you're kind of cleaning\nout your unconscious\nyeah and you don't do that work because\nyou're usually thinking about your day i\nthink you did fantastic\nokay thank you yeah i know it sounds\nweird it's just all about our perception\nof like\nyou're doing it you're doing a good job\ni'm telling you just keep doing this\nlike do three to five minutes a day\nand that is like a particular time when\nit's dawn and dusk are ideal so maybe\njust do it\nuh three minutes twice a day yep sure\nyeah i think i could i think i could do\nthat\nyeah right you could do you do like six\nminutes\ntwice a week now is it bad that i can't\nstop thinking about like\nnow i'm making a list of my head of\neverything that i thought about and\ntrying to figure out why i thought about\nit like this is the type of\nthis is the type of mental gymnastics\nthat i'll do frequently\nlike right yeah is it bad i mean who the\n[ __ ] cares you're doing it\nso yeah yeah i think it's okay so so\nyour mind is naturally exploratory\ni think it's part of the reason that\nyou're so insightful and you move so\nquick and i don't have to lead you\nplaces\nso it's a double-edged sword i think the\nmain thing is it's a faculty ultimately\nwhat i think is bad\nis your inability to control it\nyeah but if it's i mean if you know now\nyour mind is excited about why you\nthought all those things okay fine let\nit let it let go\ncool i mean you're my you're it's not\nfine whatever\njust return to the practice as long as\nyou keep going back to the practice\nyour brain will change okay\nyeah thank you you're very welcome any\nlast kind of thoughts or questions\nabout today definitely not even uh\nwhat i expected to be talking about it\nwas way more helpful than\nit's it's funny how that happens i'm a\nlittle bit curious what did you find\nhelpful i know we covered a lot of\nground like what would you say were some\nof your takeaways from today\nuh i i think the i i think\nyou know the big things are just\nhow i can be more present uh\nfor for my family and kind of maybe what\nsome of those hold ups are\nuh and maybe there's a level of\navoidance that i didn't fully\nuh realize and then also\nsome of the identity things and the fact\nthat\neven in areas where i thought that i had\ngiven up control i\nam completely in control of those and\nchoose who i surrounded myself with\nand uh trying to to\npiece together what that means and then\nalso i think one of my biggest takeaways\ntoo\nis just there's\na level of exploration and learning that\ni can still\ndo about myself that's way larger than i\ni mean i\nobviously already knew that you know\nthat that's a big part of life and it's\nin\none of the good things about life is is\ngetting to to find out all those crazy\nthings but i definitely think\nmaybe i should uh focus on this more\nactively than i currently do\nawesome man yeah i think it's um i think\nyou're you know\nyou've got the stats for it so if you\ndecide to\nyou know if you decide to walk that\njourney i think you'll go really far\nand best of luck to you rich yeah i\ncan't thank you enough\nto for you know another impulsive thing\ni did randomly tweeting last night and\nthen\nactually having me on was awesome yeah\nman i'm i'm really glad you reached out\nbecause\ni think this was fantastic so good luck\nto you dude bye thank you so much it was\nnice meeting you\nyou're very welcome see ya"
