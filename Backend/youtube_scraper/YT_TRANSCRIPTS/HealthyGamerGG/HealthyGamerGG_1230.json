    "transcript": "oh hi hey\nuh so first i wanna thank you for doing\nthis\nuh you and your whole team\nyou're very well uh and now we're just\ngonna\nthank you and then i'll just uh set the\nscene uh i guess\nuh you can call me puns by the way puns\nuh puns yeah pawns blazing so pawn short\noh\nokay pants got it so um\nthat's great once blazing is a pun in\nand of itself\nthank you how does one deal with like\nshort fuse\num and not not anger issues just initial\nlike um outraged visceral responses\nuh or like feelings um\nfor example uh you know whenever someone\nsays or does something and\neven if i don't say anything i would\nhave this initial\nlike you know my my heart start beating\nfaster and\nyou know i get uh sweaty palms and like\ni feel like i'm holding my breath\nbecause it's something that my sister is\nthe same way and we've talked about it\nand\nlike 99 we got it from our parents but\nit's just something i've noticed and i\ndon't know exactly how to\nlike deal with it because it becomes\nmore apparent for me because usually\ni go from like super passive um\nor like calm to like you know\nvery active i guess or engaged with\nwhatever we're doing\nand often what like triggers it it's not\neven important topics\nuh it happens even when i'm like gaming\nfor example you know like a friend\nmesses up like a mechanic or something i\nyou know i get the feeling of like oh my\ngod what are you doing\nand then it also you know manifests\nwhenever i'm like\ntalking or like arguing or debating on\nstuff\noh okay so so uh are you are you okay\nhold on let me can i think for a second\npuns\nof course yeah sorry i just threw a lot\non\nyou at once no it's fine it's it's\nactually very helpful\ni'm just processing um so\nwhat i'm hearing is that it's not like\nsomething personal it's just like your\nmind gets caught up with\nthings like arguments or gaming\nyeah or something that like an event\nthat happens can you give me an example\num okay so maybe someone like\nbreaks something like in the house or\num you know does something like you know\nconsidered stupid\nand then or like messes up something\nobvious\nand my initial response is like oh my\ngod how could you do that\neven if i don't say anything that's like\nmy\nlike instinct reaction to it puns would\nyou say that you're intolerant of the\nstupidity of others\num i wouldn't say so i'm quite\ni've accepted that most people do stupid\nstuff\nmyself included sometimes then why do\nyou get upset when they do stupid stuff\ni don't know um i feel like part of the\nreason is\nuh you know when i was growing up\na lot of the times like my dad for\nexample he's very\nhe means like we mean the world to him\nhe does\neverything for us but like often like\neven if we do something like somewhat\nright you'll be like okay you should\nhave also done this though\nand stuff like that you know like he\nwants us to be like the best we can\nand i know it comes from a face\ndo you expect other people to be the\nbest too\nuh no but i i have thought about this\nand i know i put myself to like\nimpossible standard\nand i feel like sometimes that initial\nreaction is\nme putting the standards for me on other\npeople\nif that makes sense is that what happens\nuh i'm not 100 sure but it makes sense\nwhen i think about it\nokay so puns we've got two options here\none is it sounds like you're very bitter\nso i i would i would love to just see\nyour face because i'm curious whether\nyou know you have color in your face\nwhether you have like medium features\nuh we can do that if you want yeah let's\ncan you just turn on video real quick i\ndon't have to stream it\ni'm just curious all right you look like\ncause my room is very messy\nthat's okay um\nso so there there are two things here\none is like we normally take like the\npsychological angle right of like figure\nout you know what like oh like you're\nputting these expectations that your dad\nput on you on other people like oh my\ngod\nso we take that angle which it sounds\nlike you're pretty familiar with so i\nwould encourage you to explore that\nthe second thing that you could do is\nbalance your ayurvedic dosha\nso if we think about res like you're\nyou're asking me\nnot how to deal with the impulsive anger\nbut how to prevent the impulsive anger\nright how to stop the short fuse in the\nfirst place\nand so that's where i encourage you to\nthink a little bit about expectation\nand what you expect from other people\nbecause i would suspect that\nit is other people's inability to live\nup to your expectations that is the\nshort\nthat leads to the shortness of views\nso you're just asking a lot of them\nright like especially if you're playing\na game\nthat's messing up i'm sorry yeah yeah\nnot the end of the world if you can't\nget it to work but uh yeah i'm sorry i\ndon't want to waste your time\nit's it's okay i think i uh you're\nyou're coughing better i think so like i\ni noticed that you had like some redness\nlike\nespecially on your cheeks and stuff it\ndoesn't look quite like acne\ndo you have acne uh no but my skin gets\nvery dry\ndry and does it get red uh yes\nokay and and so we can't i didn't get\nvery good look because it was blurry but\nso the other thing that you could do is\nreduce your bit though do you know what\nthat is\nuh can you remind me yeah so in ayurveda\nso in western medicine we think like\neveryone's mind is the same\nright like we say that we don't sort of\nsay that they're different kinds of\nminds\nso we know that like in physical\nattributes like some people have red\nhair some people have black hair some\npeople\nhave brown hair some people have blonde\nhair and in the same way there are\ndifferent\nversions of like mental faculties\nso it's not just like iq but then like\nwe sort of know that some people are\nartistic some people are creative\nwhatever\nsome people are like more mathematical\nbut actually ayurveda says that even\nlike our emotional responses to stress\ncome in three buckets so some people get\nanxious\nsome people get depressed and some\npeople get angry\nso anytime we put pressure on your mind\nyou may be more likely to respond with a\nshort fuse\nand so if you want to reduce that\nintrinsic\nlike approach to anger what you need to\ndo is reduce your pitta\nso bitte is reduced so this is it's kind\nof weird but ayurveda sort of says that\nthey're like these\nthree elemental qualities that sort of\nare\ncorrelated with certain mental and\nphysical attributes\nhigh pitta for example is associated\nwith anger irritability\nulcers indigestion and like hypertension\nfor example okay so if you reduce your\npitta and you have\nany of these problems all of those\nproblems will get better\nand in your case what i would suggest is\nthat you\ndo you like yogurt i i like everything\nokay so i know this is gonna sound\nreally weird and it's not gonna make a\nhuge difference but if you do it for a\nlittle while it'll probably like a\ncouple months\ni'd be curious to see whether it helps\nwith your short fuse\nbut what i would say is take plain\nyogurt okay no like sugar or fruit or\nanything like that\ntake plain yogurt use like\nyou know get like a eight or ten ounce\nglass\nuh you sound like european so let me\njust think about you know\nlike like 300 mls so like take like 300\nlike a 300 ml glass\nand put 100 ml of yogurt\nand 200 ml of water and mix it together\ninto a drink it'll be kind of like a\nweird like sour\ncool drink and i want you to drink that\ni have that\ndrink i'm from bulgaria and we have that\ndrink it's called irian\nwhat does it have sugar or anything no\nit's just yogurt and water as you said\ndo you drink that i haven't had it\nprobably in like two years okay so but\nno sugar okay\nso make ariane and drink it like every\nlike\nfive days a week for like two months and\nit should help your anger\ni know it sounds weird i mean yeah i\nmean it's\nit's the body so it makes sense okay\nyeah\nfrom uh from a you know scientific\nstandpoint so like you know the things\nthat we put into our gut\nare um okay so i'm gonna share a paper\non stream for a second and then\num i'll share it with you two over are\nyou watching stream\nyeah yes okay so i'll just i'll just\nshare it on stream okay\nso like this is just a a really\ninteresting paper that shows that\num you know the bacteria in your gut oh\nlook this is in zagreb sort of in your\nneighborhood neighborhood\num but so role of gut microbiota\nin the interaction between immunity and\npsychiatry so like this is just a paper\nthat talks about\nlike we showed the links between your\ngut microbiome and your brain gut axis\nregulation\nbehavioral variations and\nneuropsychiatric disorders so what that\nmeans\nlet me try to find one because i think\nthere's actually something about um\nanger here i know this is the one that\nhas anger\nbut there's actually a paper um i can't\nfind it right now\nthat talks about uh people with autism\nwho have\nvery angry like outbreaks and like throw\nthings and temper tantrums and stuff\nand that actually adjusting their gut\nmicrobiome actually reduces the number\nof temper tantrums that people with\nautism\nwill throw and so i'm not quite sure if\nthis is how it works but thousands of\nyears ago ayurvedic physicians basically\nsaid\npeople who have short fuses should drink\naryan like\nevery day and they notice that people\nwho drink aryan\nhave fewer short fuses or have a longer\nfuse\nand now we have some evidence that at\nleast there's a connection between\nbecause if you think about aryan and\nyogurt like what's in there there's\ngoing to be lactobacillus\nand bacteria in there right yeah yeah\nand so you don't want to drink it like\nbottled or or pasteurized or whatever\nbecause that'll kill\noff all the bacteria but something about\nthat may actually adjust\nthe way that your gut bacteria is which\nin turn will affect something called\ndysbiosis\nwhich is like inflammation in your gut\nwhich actually has mental effects\nso are they any foods or drinks i should\navoid\nyeah so you want to avoid spicy foods\nyou want to try to eat raw foods\nand you want foods that are cool if\npossible\nso salad is very good for you okay you\njust killed me because i love spicy food\nyep so this is the problem with pittas\nis that oftentimes the foods that you\nlike are the ones that are worse for you\nand so what i want you to notice though\nis as you start to eat cooler foods\nthere's going to be there's two kinds of\nlove okay there's gonna be something\nthat\nfeels really aligned with you and\nthere's something that feels very\nbalancing to you\nlike me as a vata i love doing a\nthousand things in one day\nbut i also find that like if i do a\nthousand things in one day it's sort of\nlike\nit feels really good in the moment but\nit doesn't feel balancing\ni actually feel really good when i like\nstart my day off grounded\nit's kind of different there's a\ndifferent kind of feels good one is like\na balancing feels good\nand one is like an exciting feels good\nit's like let's go buddy\nbut then it's sort of like no that's\nactually not good for me and as you\nstart to eat colder foods you'll see\nyou know how you start to feel different\nand it'll start to feel like kind of\ncooling refreshing\nsort of countering the way that you feel\nso going for like fruits salads as you\nsaid just raw foods would\nhelp me in the long run okay and try not\nto\nmix fruit and vegetables in one sitting\ntheir digestive profiles are different\nand so for optimal digestion you want to\neat them separately\nwhat would you say is like a good space\nbetween those\nlike times hour and a half 90 minutes\nokay great\nthank you okay can i ask a follow-up\nquestion\nsure wait so are kale smoothies bad then\nso when we say bad right let's remember\nthat there's like\nhierarchies of health so like\nif your option is between a hamburger\nand a kale smoothie\ngo kale smoothie but if you really want\nto optimize your digestion you\nactually should not mix different kinds\nof macronutrients\nand there's a really simple logical\nreason for this you guys ready for it\nyay nay okay who knows what a lipase is\ndoes anybody know what a lipase is i'm\nasking chat\nanybody know if you guys know\nfrench you know yeah it's an enzyme\nso it's an enzyme that breaks down fat\nso then there's also something called an\namylase which is an enzyme that breaks\ndown carbohydrates\nand then there's something called a\nprotease which is an enzyme that breaks\ndown protein\nnow when i drink let's say i just eat so\nwhat happens is when i put food in my\nmouth\nthe tongue in in neurons receptors in my\nmouth detect\nwhat i'm eating and what they do is they\ntell my\ndigestive enzymes they secrete the\nappropriate digestive enzymes\nfrom the stomach and gallbladder and\nintestines so when i eat like a cake for\nexample that's carbohydrate and sugar\ni mean sorry carbohydrate and fat it\nsends signals to my gut and it says hey\nwe need lipase and we need an amylase\nnow the tricky thing is that if i just\neat one macronutrient\nif i eat just protein for example then\nlike\nmy my i tell my gut to secrete protease\nand then i have a hundred units of\nprotein that i\nswallow and i have a hundred units of\nprotease so my digestion is a hundred\npercent\nbecause in my stomach there's like\nprotease that's floating around with the\nprotein and so the digestion works out\ngreat\nthe problem is that if i eat for example\ndifferent kinds of things together\nif i eat partially carbohydrate\npartially protein and partially fat\nthen i've got three different kinds of\nmacro nutrients floating around in my\nstomach\nand three different kinds of enzymes\nfloating around in my stomach\nand so the chance that a carbohydrate\nmolecule hits an amylase\nis only 30 so that what that means is\nthat there's like\nimproper digestion does that make sense\nyeah so the the problem with smoothies\nif you talk to ayurvedic or naturopathic\nphysicians they'll say that smoothies\nare not\ngood for you i mean it's it's not that\nthey're not good for you like servings\nof fruits and vegetables are still\nreally healthy for you\nbut as you like if we think about you\nknow what's like\nis a burger healthy well like it depends\non what you're comparing it to\nright so like things are not healthy in\nisolation there's like a hierarchy of\nhealth\nand and if your problem is you eat very\nunhealthy throughout the entire day i'd\nsay by all means have a\nhave a kale smoothie and get like two\nservings of fruits and vegetables and\nfiber and all that good stuff\nbut if you want to go to the next level\nright so this is where like the yogis\nwho meditated and tried to gain\nenlightenment\nrealize that they're like very very\nfine-tuning to like really optimize your\ndps\nthe higher you want to get on the dps\nmeters the more fine-tuned you want to\nbe\nand so eventually like a kale smoothie\nis really good\nif you're like you know in the bottom 80\nof health\nbut if you're in that top 20 and you\nwant to optimize your digestion\nyou should split up some of those\nmacronutrients into separate meals\ndoes that make sense yeah that makes\nsense i shouldn't have a problem because\ni would like i would rather eat like two\noranges than have like\norange juice okay\nokay yeah and also that psychological\nstuff is totally legit too i mean by all\nmeans think about you know whether you\nget pests at people because your dad got\npissed at you\nlike you should do that psychological\nwork like how did it feel when\nyou know you were never good enough for\nhim it's\nit wasn't even like that it's more like\njust being very critical\nsure yeah so i i think i think\nlook into that stuff too but it's a good\nayurvedic kind of perspective\nokay oh that that thing completely\nnew element in my equation yeah good\nso that's that's gonna be the lowest\nhanging fruit no pun intended\noh please please intent\nright so it's the areas that we haven't\nconsidered that we can oftentimes get\nthe most benefit from\nokay i'll do that then i'll buy it\ntomorrow\nokay make sure it's not so puns if it's\npasteurized then you need to get yogurt\nthat has\nactive cultures and make it yourself\nuh okay it's gonna be a bit difficult\nbecause i live abroad right now\nfor my studies so they don't have like\nthe the best\njust yogurt yeah okay okay okay okay\nwell i mean do do the best that you can\ni will thank you so much good luck buddy\nthank you have a good\nday uh yeah it's day time for you bye"
