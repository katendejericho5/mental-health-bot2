    "transcript": "foosley hello\nhello it's working am i it might be\nable to be heard hello yes it is working\nwonderfully\nthis is very surreal already oh no\nwhat is surreal about it wait what is\nhappening are you aware of something\noh no no it's because i i've seen a lot\nof your uh\nyour episodes i watched them on youtube\nwho knows i told myself not to say that\nand so i said that within the first\ncouple seconds\nyeah so why would you tell yourself not\nto say that though\nbecause i don't want you to think that\ni am expecting anything or\nor have like a i don't know i guess it\njust\nit's like you go into a conversation\nwith somebody and you're like oh i\nalready know\neverything about you not that i know\neverything about you but like i\nhave seen like maybe i would say like 20\nor 30 full episodes\nso um it's like uh\ni guess i just don't you know sometimes\nyou can just things are better left and\nsays you can let the conversation go\nnaturally\nyeah so is the issue that you didn't\nwant me to think that you had\nexpectations or that you don't have\nexpectations\nuh probably that i don't want you to\nthink\nbut you do have expectations oh um\nno well i have like an idea of how it\nmight go because i've seen like you know\nstart to finish a lot\nof them um but i'm willing for this to\ngo wherever so i didn't like you know\nnormally for something i would like\nrehearse a bunch of things or like\num not like this is my first time\ntalking to any kind of therapist or any\nlike i've never talked so i i'm just\nyeah i'm just interested to see where\nthis will go\nbut i didn't want this to be like oh i\nknow everything and i know you're going\nto see this\nand then we're going to do this at the\nend oh no no no\nsomeone has been doing replay analysis\nand i'm at a disadvantage\noh no see that's what okay erase it all\nokay chat she's figuring us out no i\nhaven't figured anything out i don't\nknow anything\nit's okay you know yeah i think it's\ntotally fine um so\nyou know one of the things that we try\nto do is like we bring things to the\nsurface and we become aware of them\nso the fact that you have watched it i'm\nreally glad you told me we have talked\nabout it i'm aware of it\nyeah totally fine so um but i am curious\nwhere did you think this would go\ni don't know like as in like me telling\nyou or like this\nno no i mean the whole episode was there\nsomething you wanted to talk about\nno there's something i want to talk\nabout but it's not like um\ni had this a whole like okay i'm going\nto say this and you're going to say this\nand i'm going to say this and then\nyou're going to say this and then we're\ngoing to do the meditation thing and\nthen i'm going to go\nyeah okay\ngreat so yeah no i'm happy to for it to\ngo wherever\ni feel like i'm like entering into a\ngame of starcraft where i'm thinking\nabout build orders and counters\nyeah and i know i know every which way\nthis is gonna go\nand i have an answer prepared prepare\nfor the sixth pool\nif you know what that is but it's it's a\nboomer term\nit's a it's like so back in the\nstarcraft days\nthere was a race called zerg i guess the\nzergs still exist\nand and there was a super cheese strat\nwhere you basically like don't build in\nan economy\nand you just like rush people with these\nlittle things called zerglings and it\nwas like\npeople would rage a lot because it's\nsort of like a low\nit's a high risk high reward kind of\nstrategy and if you failed your sixth\npool you basically\nlost the game i did that one time i\nplayed starcraft for\nlike two days and then um my fiance was\nhelping me and he's like oh you just do\nthis strategy and he was like doing all\nthis stuff and then\ni was like what are you doing and then\nthat was what it was i'm pretty sure he\nwas just\nchoosing them so i kind of know what\nyou're saying yeah cool\num so let's see if we can do better than\nkind of for the rest of the conversation\nokay so foosley um yeah this is a blast\ni'm glad you you know yeah you mentioned\ni just wanted to\nbut i would i'd feel like i was keeping\na secret if i didn't tell you that i had\nwatched 20 full episodes\nokay probably more okay well that's\nabout\n18 more than me so 18\nmore of i don't know yeah i don't watch\nthem\nof your own oh yeah but you live them\nyes yes that i i participate\num i find it very awkward to watch\nmyself i don't know if that's something\nyeah i just can't i'm the same way i\ncan't watch myself i'm not well i would\nnever\nlike go stream myself and then come\nlike at the end of it go back and just\nwatch my whole stream but i do watch\nfunny clips of my own stream sometimes\nif i'm like\nwhat did people find funny and then i'm\nlike oh that was funny that was funny\nsomething that strangely like disturbs\nme is that my children have gotten used\nto seeing\nmy face on the youtube recommended\nalgorithm\nlike at first they would comment on it\nlike they're like oh\nthat's daddy and then now it's just like\nyou know they just do they expect my\nface to be on youtube which is strange\nand do they watch like the okay\nno they're three and five right\ni was like i know i've seen them come in\nand like\ni can't imagine them like watching this\nand like\nreally relating at all or understanding\nthe the only thing so the only piece of\nhg content that they really do love to\nconsume is someone made\nlike some kind of like song where they\ndid like they made like a techno song\nout of like me doing teaching and\nmeditation\nand the kids absolutely love it and i\ncan't stand it like when they're\nlistening to it\nbut they really love it oh they remixed\nyou yeah yeah they like remix yeah\nthat's the word that's the word\nyeah so they're like reflections\nyeah well uh yeah just listen to it\nwithout me\nat the very end instead of meditating\nwe'll play the song and i'll just step\nout of the room and you can just\njam i doubt um so\nyeah foosley you are a very um\ncharismatic person oh really\nyeah thanks oh cool it's a lot of fun to\ntalk to you\noh it's only been five minutes or ten\nminutes oh i have to say one thing\nso i was very nervous to come on um\neven like last night i was like i have\nto sleep early because i already know\ni'm not i'm gonna have trouble sleeping\nbecause i'm fine to sleep normally right\nbut then\nif i have anything big the next day\nanytime i need to talk to anything any\ninterview any\ncall it's like i have to give myself a\ntwo\nextra two hours to fall asleep yeah or\ni'll because i know that like i'll close\nmy eyes i'm like just fall asleep\njust fall asleep just fall asleep and\nthen like my mind starts racing with\nlike things and then i like open my eyes\nand i'm like wide awake\nso i tried different positions and i'm\nlike just fall asleep just anyway so\nthat was me last night i finally fell\nasleep at some point\nand then so i woke up and i was like\nvery\nready if anything what i did is i got\nready too early i was sitting in my\nchair at 9\n20 a.m ready and i just time to sit now\n10 20. okay oh sorry for pst yeah so\nso an hour i was ready and i just sat\nhere and like\nmy nerves would go and i felt my heart\ngoing\nand then and then it hit 10. and then\ni'm actually very happy that you were\nlike you know we were we started a\nlittle later\nfive minutes later because it gave my\nheart time to like\ncalm down and then get nervous again and\nthen calm down and then\nso that's just my morning anyways i just\nwanted to\nis that what you wanted to talk about do\nyou want to talk about maybe sleep\nanxiety and\nno uh well no i normally i i don't have\nsleep anxiety i think that's\none thing that's just something that i\ndon't me\ni feel like it's not a big deal like i\ndon't have insomnia i sleep really well\num eight nine hours a day if anything um\ni'd say the thing i want to talk about\num\nis more age pressure okay and um\nage pressure and then like under age\npressure i think that comes with like\njob pressure\num marriage pressure like there's just\nit's like because\nage is a thing um and i'm always\nthinking about what i need to be doing\nwhat's my step in life\nthen that leads to like me having\npressure with my job and pressure with\nmy\nengagement slash marriage um and\nno like never i'm always overthinking so\ni'm never sure like\nwhat's the right step to take if there's\na right step to take\num why am i doing something that i'm\ndoing is it because i want to or because\nsociety wants me to or because that's\nwhat\nmy parents want me to do or my viewers\nwant me to do\nthat's like an added layer it's like\nbeing a streamer and being very open\non the internet about my thoughts and my\npersonal life they a lot of people have\ninputs\nso now i'm like oh okay i want to do\nthis but they want this one you know so\nthen\ni get confused about what i want to do\nyeah\ndude i am so excited about this\nconversation because i think it's\nsomething that\nfor i don't know why i guess we just\nhaven't had someone talk about this but\nlike\ni think engagement pressure absolutely\nyeah absolutely right it's nuts like\nit's nuts\num you know and maybe i'll kind of teach\na little bit towards the end but there's\nactually an\ninteresting psychologist this guy named\neric erickson\nwho basically said that all of our\npsychiatric problems like depression and\nanxiety and stuff\ncome from sort of we have this\ntrajectory in life where like at each\nstage of life we have\na different goal from like a\ndevelopmental standpoint\nand when we don't succeed at that stage\nof life we kind of get stuck there\nso like teenagers are all about\nindividuating\nand like developing my own identity so\nwe see people like coloring their hair\nand getting piercings and going goth and\nlike whatnot like they're trying to\nfigure out who they are\nand if they don't do that stuff properly\nlike if they don't do it successfully\nthen they kind of get stuck\nand then you'll sometimes have like you\nknow older people who are still trying\nto figure out who they are\nno harm to them it's just you know so we\nkind of get stuck\nand so then like you know as we get into\nlike our 50s and stuff you start to look\nback on your life and you start to think\nlike\ndid i do enough what did i like do\nenough in the world and like make my\ncontribution because like\nnow you're kind of past the halfway\npoint you know things are starting to\nwind down you got that hip pain\nand you're balding and you're a little\nbit overweight and like\nyou're like you know did i spend my\nyouth in a productive way\nand and so it's kind of interesting\nbecause you know i really like to think\nabout things the way that eric erickson\ndoes and he sort of says like you know\nat this age\ngroup this is the problem at this age\ngroup this is the problem and then\ndepending on how you kind of mess up\nthere\nyou can end up with different issues\nlike\nlater on so i i really\nactually love this topic it's something\nthat we haven't really explored if\nyou've watched a lot of our videos maybe\nyou'll know that\num so i i think it's really fantastic i\nappreciate so much about your\nthoughtfulness about what to talk about\nso tell me what kind of pressure do you\nfeel\nokay well so should i talk about just\nage pressure in general or like\nbecause a job pressure marriage like i\nfeel like they all go together but\nthey are all their own thing so yeah so\ni mean the one that i feel is the\njuiciest is the engagement pressure yeah\nthat's the one that i'm personally the\nmost curious about\num but you know we can talk about\ni'm just curious about you know what\npressure do you feel like what\nleaps to your mind when i say that okay\nso\ni think i i can start with age and then\nlike engagement\nstems very quickly from that so like i'm\n28\num and i guess you know\nour my whole life i'm was told like\nyou have to get married by this age uh\nfor me\ni thought i was gonna marry get 25\nreally uh and have kids by\nactually thought i'd be married but 23\nhave kids by 26 i don't know my\nmy mind was always like in my 20s i'm\ngoing to have a family 30s i'm going to\nbe like\nsuper established job kids husband all\nthis right but my fiance is literally\n33. so\nit's like that's not that like it's so\nanyways\num i guess i was oh sorry this is just\nme talking with my hands\noh this is our age different this is our\nage gap\nokay but so okay okay okay keep going\nso he's 33 i'm 28. um uh\ni guess my whole life i always thought\nright i would get\nmarried 20 early 20s\nkids right and then now i'm 28 so i\ndidn't fulfill any of that\nand i feel this pressure i guess\nnot even it's not even my parents if\nanything i've talked to my parents about\nthis and they're very understanding that\nlike i think my mom growing up has\nalways been like you\nyou should have you should get married\nand have kids and all this but recently\ni've told her a bit about the pressure\nand just\na bit about how streaming has like come\nin from like\nleft field and kind of taken like the\nforefront of my life\nand i can't just have kids right now\nlike it just feels weird to have a kid\nall of a sudden or sorry get married\nfirst of all\nand then have kids um sorry my thoughts\nare a bit\nsporadic so yeah you will have to i'm\nsorry i\njust try to follow where they're going\nso um\ni guess i i can start with i got engaged\noh sorry i got\nme and my boyfriend sorry this is weird\nme and my\nfiance started dating in 2016 when i was\n23\nand i was already like when i met him i\nhave a journal entry of me saying like\nyou know i met this guy and like i'm 23\nso\ndating isn't just like we're not just\nlike casual like this could turn into\nsomething\nlike if i was 17 and i'm at the same guy\ni'd be like i'm in a boy and like we're\nyou know boyfriend girlfriend who you\nknow wherever this goes right but\ni'm 23 so in my mind it's like this\ncould turn into like my husband like i'm\nnot just dating for fun i'm dating\nto like i'm dating at 23. so\nso anyways that was my first i literally\nwrote like on the first week like\nwhat if i marry this guy question mark\nquestion mark i mean who knows\nanyway so fast forward four years\nuh in 2019 or three years he\nproposed to me on stream so we were\nstreaming\nand yeah so that's the thing is like he\nhe was he just finished like breaking\nthis world record of like\nmost hours streamed on twitch in a month\nin a 30-day period right\nand on the last day of it like at the\nvery end he like pulls out this chipotle\nbag\nand he like pulls out this ring and and\nthen he proposed to me\nand i was like whoa like yeah okay\nlet's get married you know and this this\nclip\nlike went very pop it was very viral on\nthe internet and like i had my cousins\nand random people from high school like\ni saw you on\nreddit oh my gosh you got engaged my\ncousin was mad at me because she found\nout through the internet\nall this stuff so then i was like okay\nwow like this kind of reached a lot of\npeople anyways so\nnow uh now fast forward\nokay so then we're gonna get married and\nthat was in 2019.\nkovid happens right and now\nit's like all this stuff don't know when\nto do the wedding we had a wedding date\nand then we did it and then we well we\nstill have it but we're like\nwe told our wedding planner to cancel it\nbecause we are\nbasically i just feel very a lot of\npressure because i don't know\nuh if i'm getting married like because\nof the viewers\nbecause of my parents because i want to\num all this stuff my sometimes i have\nthis urge to run to the courthouse\nwith edison and get married on the same\nday and then some days i want to plan\nthis like big elaborate wedding\nand i don't know does this make sense\nthe only thing that doesn't make sense\nis the chipotle bag\nthat's the only thing that i'm\neverything else is crystal clear\nokay okay the chipotle bag is just he\nwas trying to\nlike like uh hide the ring and he's like\ni got you a surprise and i was like\nchipotle\nbut it was a wedding ring got it i was\nlike is that some weird product\nplacement or like what\nwhat exactly like not yet chipotle\nwhere weddings happen\nyou know it's like they're they're\nfighting with de beers like a diamond is\nforever but a\nburrito is for today they have to they\nwill cut cater my wedding\nthat's a great idea not you've given me\nyeah so\nsorry yeah uh foosley i'm i'm yeah so\nlet me let me tell you what i'm hearing\nand then you tell me if you're making\nsense okay yes\nso so like i'm hearing that you kind of\nhad this script\nin your mind about how life is supposed\nto go\nand yeah oddly enough you're sort of\nfollowing the script\nbut what i'm hearing is that you're\nactually like genuinely like i don't\nyou know it sounds to me like you're\ngenuinely in love with edison is his\nname\nyeah okay um so you're\nin love with like you met him at 23\nwhich is when you're supposed to meet\nyour husband and it turns out that you\nkind of probably met your husband there\nyeah and but i'm also hearing that\nthere's a lot of like genuineness\nso you were supposed to follow the\nscript but it turns out that there's\nactually like a lot of genuineness\nto this relationship and that you\nactually do want to get married and now\nsort of feels like the right time\nso so you may have kind of followed the\nscript or were aware of the script but\nthat you're actually sort of living your\nown life\nand and now you're it's kind of like\nwhere you know what is my life\nand what is like the script and should\nmy life be based on the script like\nis it actually better you know because\nthe script is based on something right\nyeah and and you know so i'm i'm hearing\nyou kind of trying to figure out like\nyou know what should you do yes\nyes yes that's it's very spot on\nyeah so what what do i do\nwell i i mean you know i gotta say i i\nthink you gotta marry edison\nno yeah yeah that's the steps but how\nbut\nbecause i i don't know um i don't know\nmany people who propose with the\nchipotle bag\ni know yeah\nbut so so let me ask you um\ncan i think for a second yes yes yes\nso let me just kind of map out a couple\nof other things you said you said like\njob pressure\nparental pressure but i'm sort of\nhearing that the parents actually aren't\npressuring you much\nyeah so really quick it's like my\nparents\nare great like my i always\nuh like i was a good student my whole\nlife\nand it was never because my parents were\nlike you don't get an a\nbad you know spank like it was me doing\nthat to myself\nso my mom if anything like i guess they\nwanted me to do well and they're very\nlike they've been proud of me\nbut my mom and dad have never like been\nmad at me for not doing well\nif anything maybe a little when i was\nyounger um i went to a private school\ninitially and then i couldn't handle the\npressure but i got really bad grades\nthere\nand then when i moved to public school i\nthink\neverything ingrained in me from private\nschool like i was like\ni became very like on top of everything\nvery like musket a's musket\nbees pluses like it must do well um\nor else you know i'm gonna be mad at\nmyself so my mom if anything said leslie\ndon't be so hard on yourself like you\ndid well like you did well on this\ntest i'm like i didn't set the curve on\nthis exam though like i\ni only got an a like i wanted to be like\ntop three\nfour in my in my college class like i\ni would be upset over that and then my\nmom's just like\nlike or my parents in general just be\nlike you don't need to\nyou're doing fine like if anything like\nyou work too hard so that's been my\neven in college i was like that so in in\num\nin in streaming i'm also my mom is just\nconstantly reminding me to\nbreathe to stop stressing to stop\nworking so hard\nshe's like leslie like slow down like\nyou don't need to do\nif anything she thinks streaming's bad\nfor my health because she's like you\nneed to just step back and like it's\nit's too much happening in your life too\nquickly like you're you're running life\non like stop like fast forward like\nyou're too many events or you're\ntraveling like when when i could travel\nyou were\ni was traveling like five six maybe more\nsix seven times a year\nevents and like you know very high like\nvery stimulating events\nmeeting a lot of people and you know\nwhen i\nyeah i guess it just felt like i would\ndo what\num most people would do like event wise\nlike\nin ten years in like two years you know\njust like why do you feel like you have\nto run\nlife on fast forward i don't well\num i don't feel like i have to but i\nfeel like that's just the pace of\nstreaming and like this\nwhole industry it's like conventions and\nand then\nokay it feels like i work like a ton\ni gotta stream a bunch and then to take\nyou have to like take an extreme break\nto make up for the extreme work like um\nthis is like before when i could\nso so pre-covered it'd be like i'd\nstream like an intense amount and then\ni would go to like korea for like\na week and then like instead of i feel\nlike taking weekends because i didn't\nhave weekends the way i'd look at it is\nlike\nstream and then like vacation and then\nstream\nvacation instead of like work weekend\nwork week and work week you know\ni'd do it like like weekends would be my\nvacations and i would treat them less\nfrequently\nyeah yeah what what made you\ndo it that way this industry is like\nvery like\nyou know like you i guess it'd be very\nlike\nthere'd be conventions right i wouldn't\nwant to miss conventions because that's\nwhen i get to meet up with like people\nlike uh you know i have friends from\ndifferent parts of the world and i never\nwould get to meet them and then they're\nlike hey are you going to pax east or\nare you going to twitchcon are you going\nto\nthis event and that'd be my time to like\nmeet up with people\nso i felt like kind of like i have to go\ni have to travel to go meet my friends\nthat from you know different places and\nand to just make memories with my\ncurrent friends because we're all just\nin our room playing games all day or\nstreaming all day so i felt like that\nthis is the time so it's not that i want\nto live life on fast forward\nit's that that's just kind of like it's\nvery easy to to\njust just start doing that um very\nexciting a lot of things are happening\nand it was great it's just sometimes i\ndo feel like i need to slow down\num sure so so i think in order to if you\nthink you need to slow down in order to\nslow down you have to figure out first\nwhy you're running it fast forward\nright and what i'm hearing you say so\ni'm just going to point out some stuff\nin your language so when i ask you you\nknow why do you feel like you have to\nrun life on fast forward and then you\nsay i don't feel like i have to run\non my life on password it's the industry\nsure right and then as we dig into that\nwe begin to see that like\nyou start to act because you make it\nsound like an external force\npressure so pressure is an external\nforce coming from the outside\nage pressure like every year you look at\nyour driver's license and you look at\nthe calendar and it's like there's this\nexternal pressure like the calendar is\nlike\nhave children right like it's like a\npressure\nand then like there's job pressure\nthere's industry pressure but but this\nis what i think a really key thing is\nthat as we tunnel down into it\nthere isn't actually industry pressure\ni know it sounds weird but when you get\na phone call\nsomething happens in your mind and then\nyou\nfeel the pressure like your friends are\njust asking you if you're going to be at\nan event\nand you could say no\nbut you won't let yourself say no\nright and yeah that's it like it's not\nlike they're like\nfoosley you have to come otherwise i\nwill never speak to you again like\nthat's\nno they say it oh they do oh god joking\njokingly\nyeah no it's more like but i'll never\nsee you i'll never have the opportunity\nto see you like\nyeah yeah okay okay okay okay so that's\nactually a very important detail right\nbecause\nit you know it it sounds like actually\nthat is external pressure\ni mean it's like joking and then i know\nthey're not actually going to be mad at\nme\nit's more of like this is our one\nopportunity to meet like in this you\nknow in the past it's been like\nuh that's true you know we've been\nfriends online for six months a year\nit'd be really cool to meet this person\nyou know\ni guess it's the pressure of like you\ndon't want to miss out on\nmeeting people and you know in my mind\nit's like life is about\nmaking these personal connections and\nthen like i never regret having a really\nnice talk with somebody\nlike you know in general and so it feels\nreally like\nyeah it'd be worth it to fly to berlin\nto like talk to this person that i've\nknown\nand we can just have a good talk off\nstream and and and i'll feel very like\nfulfilled and happy by that\nbut then now i'm hearing now i'm hearing\na couple of other themes one is missing\nout\nright that you have this opportunity and\nyou should take care of you should take\nadvantage of this opportunity\nwhile it's there and that also that like\nthe sacrifice is\nworth it i'm hearing that living life on\nfast forward is worth it\nbecause you get to live more life in a\nshorter amount of time\nyeah yeah is that how it feels\nyeah some some not because like it feels\nlike i'm only comes back to age pressure\ni'm only in my 20s\nonce i'm at like it feels like my\ni mean i'm past my physical prime\ndefinitely been struggling but\ni'm kind of you know this is what is\nthat hold on what i'm having some\nshoulde you know some arm pain some some\npain you know that i wouldn't have when\ni was 17.\nso i'm a little bit like you know\ngetting you're saying 28 is past your\nphysical\ni feel like i would you know like you\nwould like\ni get up in the morning and go and i'm\nlike oh\nthat's how it feels now but when i was\n17 i would just go whoa\nand then jump out of bed and like\n[Laughter]\nso now i feel um a bit\ni mean definitely a little bit more\nright so anyways my brain's like\nleslie you're in your 20s you're going\nto be in your 30s soon you're about to\nhit the big 3-0\nand in my mind 30 is like have your life\ntogether married kids you know so my\nbrain is\nlike there's not much time even though\ni've seen other people on the other side\nof 30 and they're not doing that and\nthey're fine and i don't look at them\nany less for not doing like\nit's all on like it's me putting my own\nlike\nviews of like my past self like being\nlike when you're 30 you're going to do\nall these things and have this and so\nwhere does that come from\ni don't know just you know i guess\ngrowing up you just hear it\nit's like you know you you have to like\nthat just\ni guess can you tell me about private\nschool\nsure okay so i went to private school\nuntil sixth grade sixth grade\nand let me think uh i think i had new\nuniforms i it was a primarily\nthere it was mostly asians at my school\nit was um a lot of competition\ni felt like there's very every everyone\nwas very\nuh like very strict i got yelled at a\nlot i was the\nout the kid out of line all the time\num and um\ni rebelled a lot in private school i\nhung out with the\nkids that were not as smart like i was\nnot i was one of the kids getting c's\nall the time\nin private school i hung out with like a\ngroup of three girls who we're all kind\nof trouble\nback then we like gossip a lot\ntalk about boys a lot right on our\nzangas\nyou know just a lot it was just i would\nrebel against\nthe teachers i always thought the\nteachers had something against me\num i i did like a few of my teachers but\na few of them i was like\ni would put the toilet paper in soap and\ni'd throw it at the ceilings and then\nthey'd stick to the ceilings i got in\ntrouble a lot for that\num what's your understanding of why you\ndid that\num i didn't like the teachers\nso one of them i sort of knew i would\nget in trouble but i did it anyway\noh i did bad stuff i stuck stepped on\nsome bees and i would like put the bees\nin bags and then put those\nin lockers of girls i didn't like i was\na really bad kid back in the day i don't\nknow where it stemmed from but i think\nit came from\num i was\nupset at like girl other girls for being\nmean\ni was mean to other girls uh i was\ni don't know i was just rebelling a lot\nand\nit was just like i guess i hung around\nalso like some kids who like\nencouraged that and so i you know i fed\ninto it as well like we both we\nit was like you you know you find\nsomeone you kind of both just like yeah\nlet's do this and\nyou do and then you just enable each\nother sure\nwhat did your parents think about you\nknow getting in trouble and the seas and\nwhatnot\nthey pulled me out of private school i\nwould complain i think that was it\ni wanted to be out of private school so\nbadly there was this thing called\nrecitation on fridays we'd have to go in\nfront of the class every friday and\nrecite this\npoem and every week it was it gave me so\nmuch anxiety every week\ni just wanted and i said public school\nmom they don't have recitation\nthey don't have to do this and i'd\nalways complain about private school\nprivate so i don't want to be here\nuntil i think i i guess i just made so\nmuch trouble\nthat my mom's like yeah let's you don't\nneed to go to private school\ni think maybe that was a bit of it is i\nreally just didn't like it\ni i think i just didn't like it\nwhat didn't you like about recitation\nwhat would it feel like the night before\nwhat were thursday nights like for you\ndress it was like every thursday night\nwas like this\nthis past night the sleeping thing i i'm\nterrified i just like would be like\ntomorrow i'm gonna get up in front of\nthe class i'm gonna pull the stick out\nsee that i have to go sixth or whatever\nand then my heart's gonna be racing for\nthe entire person in front of me and\nthen i'm gonna go up and i'm gonna\nmess up all my lines and i'm just gonna\nlike be\nstaring out of the class and everyone's\ngonna be judging me waiting for me to\nmess up\nand then i'm going to mess up and i'm\ngoing to stand there embarrass myself oh\nand i have to do it and then i finish it\nget it over with\nget like my b or whatever and then go\nthrough it and then like\nit's like a cool down and then i have to\ndo it all over again every friday\nand it was just the worst i remember\njust i hated that\nand so did you ever think about did you\never fantasize about\nwhat you could do that would prevent\nthat horrible future\nlike as in like people prepared or\nyeah so it's kind of like a leading\nquestion i'm really sniffing for\nsomething and i\ni think i'm actually not gonna find\nanything but seems good on paper\num so like i'm just kind of envisioning\nyou know\nwhat must have been in your head about\nif you were a different person\nor if you did things differently because\nlike usually when\nlike did you have those kinds of\nthoughts like if i was\nyeah i mean yeah the way i thought about\nit is like i wish i would\ni i could be more like this student or\nthis year like there was a\nkid named ayush in my class who was just\nthe best at it\ni remember he'd get up there and he'd\nlike commit\nyeah i know and it was just like he just\nkilled it every week and he\ni was just like how he closed his eyes\nhe used his hands\nand he would just give it his all every\nweek and he would\neveryone would be like wow and i was\njust like\ni can't do that why can't i be like him\nand that was the one thing maybe i would\nthink i'd fantasize a world where i\ncould probably be\nbetter at speaking or more charismatic\nlike he could be yeah but instead i just\nget up there and go\nlike like and i just stuttered my way\nall the way through it and\ni would and i had a horrible fear of\npublic speaking all the way i always\ntalk about it like all the way up\nto even until streaming i i can't i\npublic speaking is just the worst and um\nand so that that i guess that was it\nwhat did you think was different about\nayush versus you\nhe didn't care what other people thought\nhe was just like\nor maybe he did but he he didn't show it\nhe\nwasn't afraid to be dramatic and like\nit felt like he was that was his happy\nplace like he was like i'm here to\nperform this is my moment\nversus me i'm like dreading this moment\nlike oh god everyone's gonna think i'm\nweird and if i try to commit like him\nthey're gonna be like\nlike why is she doing that even why is\nshe trying so hard you know\nso if anything i just wanted to\ndisappear i just wanted to say it get it\nover with and\neveryone forget about it be the complete\njust be completely average up there and\nbe\nnot memorable in any way um and yeah he\ni knew he just went up there and he he\nlike\nyeah he felt it felt like if anything he\nwas excited to go up\nevery week\ndo you think yeah do you think ayush was\nliving his life on fast forward\nprobably not if i had to guess yeah is\nthat\nis that how you saw it i didn't think\nabout fast forward\nback then because life felt so so so in\nthe moment\nand slower back then like i was just\nliving every moment back then as like\nthis is forever\nbecause when you're a kid like that's\nthat that's how it feels\nyep yeah yeah so i'm gonna need\nso maybe i'm barking up the wrong tree\nhere foosley so this is gonna be really\nfor you to decide but like here's what\ni'm noticing so what you are is kind of\nultra conformist\nin your head yeah right like\nthere is a there is a path to success\nand we have to follow it\nand then like you get really bent out of\nshape\nif you are like not ultra conforming\nlike\n23 26 marriage gotta do this and there's\na very like there's a very like\nreasonable part of you that's sort of\nlike i can't really get married because\nof covid\ni'm not really ready to have kids i'm in\na happy relationship i enjoy my career\nmy life is pretty good i'm actually\nhappy on a daily basis but\ninside is like a nun who's like\nfoosley this is the way of doing things\nand\nand so then the really interesting thing\nis to hear you talk about private school\nit's like\nactually the voice in your head seems to\nbe the very opposite of what you have\nnow\nlike you used to be a rebel you used to\nbe like no f in rules like\nf you guys like toilet paper on the\nceiling like bees in the lockers\nlike you know screw age like\nyou know like yeah it's interesting\nbecause i\nand and so i'm just wondering when i see\nsuch a drastic shift in someone's like\ninternal dialogue i sometimes wonder if\nthose are like\nconnected um and i wonder if sort of\nlike you sort\nyou know your road out of private school\nwas that\nyou became exactly what you wanted to be\nand now you're the person like you used\nto be one thing in private school\nand then you realize like this is not\nworking\ni have to turn myself into something\nthat is not the rebel\nand then like you became this ultra\nconformist and now like what i'm hearing\nis that you know your parents didn't\nmake you the ultra conformist\nit's like age who made you the ultra\nconformist because ayush was like\ni'm gonna i'm gonna show you how it's\ndone and you have to like take every\nopportunity and\nevery friday is like a chance for life\nin joy\nand passion and then you get this phone\ncall from your twitch friends and\nthey're like do you want to do this and\nyou're like\nwhat would a you should do is what you\nsome part of your mind is telling you\nyou're like\nash would not skip it aish doesn't\n[ __ ] take weekends\ni can't believe we're talking this is so\nfunny um\nyeah i mean i uh\nbut i could be barking up the wrong tree\nthere you know sometimes i work myself\nup\nyeah no no i i feel that like i\ni don't in my mind i wasn't asking about\nayush i don't think i\nreally thought back to that until like\nbut yeah people like him\ni was i was jealous because they they\nfelt i'm jealous of people who are able\nto like\npause you know and live life in the\nmoment\nand i feel like i'm always like leslie\ntake this opportunity take this\nopportunity yes say yes say yes so that\nlater you can relax but why\nlater why not now why can't i just you\nknow\nyeah yeah but so it's there's a very\ninteresting conundrum there because\nyou're not actually talking about living\nin the moment\nright because if you were really gonna\nlive in the moment you would pass on the\nopportunity\nyeah so like what you envy\nit and so it's let me just sit\ndoes that make sense uh i think so yeah\ni feel like there is a more profound or\nclear way that i can explain this\nbut because\nit's interesting because you talk about\nliving in the present and living in the\nmoment\nbut then the other thing that i kind of\nwant to point out is that like\nyou were stuck in the present when you\nwere in private school\nyes and you hated it yes\nand now you you have this idea of what\nit is to\nlive in the present but there's another\npart of your mind that's like f that\nwe want to live we don't want to like\npause the video\nwe're gonna fast forward fast forward\nfast forward the video\nright yes well i don't want i don't\nchoose to fast forward\nsure i can't control the speed at which\nlife is going like when i was\na kid all i wanted to do was be older i\nwas like i remember being 12 or like 11\ni was i went to the store and i sat in\nthe this chair that's supposed to you\nknow it's like a massage chair\ni sat in it and they're like i'm sorry\nyou can't like how old are you and i was\nlike 11 and they're like you can't sit\nin that chair it's going to mess up your\nbones or whatever and i was like\nare you serious why are you like that\nshoulder problem that's the chair\nso it's they wouldn't like i was so mad\ni was like oh i just want to be 18. like\nthat's all i want to be\n18. and then like when i was 18 oh i\nwant to be 21 like i just want to be\nable to drink\ni want to be 21. 21 like then i'm like\nwait slow down slow down\nyeah what age do you want to be now\n22. 22 or 23 forever\nyeah 21 i feel like is a bit young so 23\nbecause\nnow i'm like approaching the age well\nactually 25 is good too\ni like i feel like now i'm like i don't\nwant to be\n30 because it's forward because then i'm\njust gonna get old\nand irrelevant and ugly\ni feel like i'm just gonna it feels like\nwhen i was 23 i thought that of 28\ni'm gonna be honest i thought wow leslie\nhave five years left in your career when\nyou're 28\nit's over it's done no one's gonna\nrelate to you\nno one's gonna watch you you're 20\nyou're gonna be 28.\nyou're gonna be married and you're\nprobably gonna be having kids in the\nnext year so\nthat was 28 for me and so it is somewhat\nrelieving to be 28 now\nand think that way about 32 but then i\nknow 32 is gonna happen\nwell i think that way about 38 when\naround 38\nlefty 42 142 would that be 48 you know\nand so i guess um\nyeah i guess i just i'm scared of\nthe future i i guess it feels like\ntime's running out especially when my\ncareer is like you know it started when\ni was 23 and it feels like you know i'm\nin front of a camera i'm on twitch\nit's a job that doesn't have like this\nobvious next path\nas well so it feels like i have to make\nthe most of\nwhat i have now like this is my career\ni'm probably just gonna try to do this\nfor 10 years and then like it's over\nlike something's gonna happen and people\nare gonna be like oh she is old\nokay i can't watch her anymore like i\njust think that p i have this fear that\npeople are gonna just\nclick to just that i'm old and they\nshouldn't watch me because\ni don't they don't relate to me or that\nit's just that i'm just\nold now and it's like ew i'm gonna be\nwatching like my mom\nyou know so something like that so\nfoosley thanks a lot for sharing all\nthat i i think i'm hearing a very very\ncommon thread here which is that\nyou're never happy with where you are\nright it's like you either want to be\nolder or you want to be younger like\nyour mind is like retreating\nit in whatever way it can except like\nnowhere but the present\nyeah like like present is unacceptable\nsorry anywhere but the present\nyes and and so it's like you know when\nyou were young you were thinking about\nthe future now that you're\nold you're thinking about the past and\nyou're like 23 to 25\nmaybe there's a little bit of erickson\nhere where you you will feel ready to be\nolder than 23\nonce you get married because that's the\nmilestone that you associate with 23 so\nmaybe there's something there\nbut really what i'm hearing is that you\ndetest and by you i mean a part of you\nbecause this is a weird confusing thing\nabout our mind as we think about our\nmind as monolithic but it's not like one\nway right but like what i'm hearing is\nthat you never wanted to be where you\nare\nlike age-wise in general\nbut yeah age-wise sure yeah well i can't\nsay\ni don't like i think i'm very i am very\nhappy with where i am\nlike like i'm very i mean there's parts\nof me that are\nyeah struggling but like overall i think\ni am but yeah\nso so so just to quickly explain kind of\nhow that works if you've heard me talk\nto\ntalk about some scars you know it's like\nthat part of you that is unhappy with\nwhere you are\nis something you carry with you and\nsometimes gets activated\nlike if i have a phobia of snakes\nthat phobia of snakes is something i\ncarry with me and i can be like happy\nand then then i see a snake and then the\nphobia arises\nso you're like happy in the day to day\nbut you carry this thing with you that\nlike\nsand in the hourglass is running out i'm\ntoo old i'm not 23 i was supposed to get\nmarried i was supposed to have kids\nyou know i'm not even gonna like touch\nthis we're\ni don't know if you recognize this but\nwe're you know we're circling around\npotentially like talking about being too\nold to have kids\nand that thing right so that i'm just\nsteering clear\nof that one unless you want to talk\nabout it but\ni mean in my mind it's just certain that\ni will have kids\nwhen i'm like 32. if i'm feel about that\ni'm just preparing i'm like okay my my\nbasically my mind like maybe 33\nor 34. but like i know that i want to\nhave kids\ni know that i don't really have a choice\nto have kids but after i'm 40\nso i have to like i can choose to get\nmarried like married is like\nyou know i have to you know it's not\nlike a biological thing but if i'm\nhaving kids at 45 like you know i take a\nrisk\nmy kids so i i am like yeah i have to if\ni want to have kids then i gotta do that\nwhen i'm in my 30s so in my mind it's\nsince it's a set decision\nalmost i feel less anxiety about it and\nkids are cute so i've started to get\nmore excited i see kids i'm like\nand anderson's like oh i'm kind of\nlooking forward to it and i have a cat i\ndon't know where he is but\ncaring for him makes me feel like this\nlove so\ni want that yeah yeah\nso it actually sounds like you're pretty\ngood around the kids thing yeah i don't\nfeel too much anxiety about it because i\nwant to have kids yeah\nyeah sometimes when people are very like\nsensitive about their age\nthey also like there's a like for women\nthere's a lot of pressure to have kids\nat a certain time and\nand you know things like that but i'm\nactually not hearing that from you right\nso it sounds like you're\nokay having kids at 32. i feel like\nmaybe because it's also kind of far\nlike it's like well it's like full\nthat's actually not that far\nfive because it could be from 32 to like\nmy mom had me when she was 38.\nso because i feel like that's some ways\naway\num i think if it was like uh\nyou know i was married and then we're\nlike me and edison are sitting down\nall right you wanna have kids you know\nthat maybe might\nstart to freak me out a bit because\nthat's a huge like life\nchange but because it's still somewhat\ndistant\num i don't feel it entirely but as i'm\nhaving this conversation you know i am\nthinking a little bit yeah it does give\nme a little bit of work it does worry me\na little bit\nbecause i'm not sure how much that would\nchange my life and also edison we've had\nthe talk about it and he's like\nif you want kids we have kids if you\nwant one kid we have one kid if you have\ntwo you have two if you don't want\nyou what we don't have kids he says like\nyour body you know\nlike i don't have to go through it so\ni'm not gonna make you have kids\nso him saying that gives me like\nmakes me feel so free like there's this\noption in where i don't have kids maybe\nso i think that that also is like\nyes yeah that that was instantly like a\nso much relief like oh like i don't have\nto have kids\nso maybe there's a small part of me that\nisn't sure i'm gonna have\nno i'm pretty sure but like maybe a ten\nfive percent chance that like\nif i randomly decide not to that i don't\nhave someone\npressuring me as well and my parents\nalso don't always\ndon't pressure me about it at all they\ndon't i think that obviously they want\nto\nbut they don't say anything about it so\ni don't have like this yapping voice\nlike kids kids kids kids kids grandkids\nyou know so it's\nit feels kind of it sounds like you have\nthat voice in your head sometimes\nit's my own voice yeah i was gonna say i\ni think you're you know your parents\nlearned that that you're\nyou know you have your own yapping voice\nthey don't want to add another yapping\nvoice yeah\nyeah and and so is there like a type of\npressure that we sort of haven't touched\non i mean do you feel like we've covered\nage pressure or drop yeah i yeah i think\nyou really hit the nail on the head with\num\nlike i'm just never happy like\nlike uh like when i was a kid i wanted\nto be older\nwhen i'm older like i wanted to be\nyounger and when i was\nthe age i wanted to be time just went\nlike that\nso it just feels like also on twitch\nit's very like you know the boomer\nzoomer\njokes like they're everywhere every even\nso one of my friends brought up like\nyesterday or two days ago why are we\nalways talking about age like\ni feel like it comes up in every\nconversation and i'm like it's because\nlike you say something like you're such\na boomer and then you're like i'm not a\nboomer\ni'm gonna justify why you're not old or\nit's like i try to say something young\nand hip but they're like\nleslie stop it you're talking like the\nyou know gen z and like the zoomers and\nit's all about like\nage these days like how old you are what\njokes you can say or can't say\nor like if you get something or don't oh\nyou're so boomer you're too much of a\nzoomer to understand like it's very\nthe culture especially i think in gaming\nand streaming it's very prevalent social\nmedia\nso my age comes up a lot in terms of\nat least in my own head i don't even\nalways say like oh i'm 28 you know\ni just i just hear it a lot and so it\nmakes me think a lot about how old i\nam um and it does it's not like a big\nissue\nin my mind it's just like a voice like\nyou said or something i'm always like\nthinking it's always in the back of my\nhead\nthat of things i should be doing or or\nlike am i too old to do this or\num so it's nothing like crazy\nit's just like i think that that's just\na general thing i'm carrying with me\nand it's of the yapping voice i mean i\nwant to just\nlearn how to like slow down\nand like actually just you know not like\nlive\nlike when i was a kid yeah but you don't\nwant to live when you were like a kid in\nfact i think the reason you're in this\ntrouble is because you're trying to get\naway from the way you were living as a\nkid\nyeah so like live like the times\nthe top how slow it is outside it just\nfelt like\nyeah how did it feel outside of school\nit was good it was great like um\ni would go to my cousin's house every\nday after school and we'd rollerblade\naround the streets have knee pads and\nfall down\nand um\n[Music]\nyeah it was it was good so\nyeah do you so what part of you makes\nyou think you're living too fast\num living too fast uh\ntime birthdays are happening so quickly\nevery day is the same i'm like living in\na it feels like a\nlike a wake up do the same thing every\nday and i know that when i do the same\nthing every day\nit just all blurs together like one big\nyear just went by like what did i do i\nwoke up\nevery day streamed played games went to\nsleep some days i remember that one day\nthat i left the house with edison and we\nwent on a cute date\num but usually it's very routine and\nroutine tense like when i'm a kid\num you know i've only lived so long so\nevery day is like a new memory right and\nso it feels like\num time is slower because\nthat's like every day is like it's like\na\nbigger a fraction of my life like it\ntakes up\nyou know like but now every day is like\nless of that so i think that\ni have so many memories that are like so\nit feels like time is just racing\num but yeah i noticed like wow i'm\nalways saying oh my gosh march went by\n2020 just happened like that\num everything is just going by so\nquickly\num and i think that that\nyeah that that and also i used to break\nthings up a bit more i\nwould travel right and stuff and that\nwould weirdly it would be by having all\nthese things it would\nslow me down in a way or at least make\nthe year very memorable for me\nlike oh i remember i went to here and\nthen i went to this and then i traveled\nthere lucy can i ask you to just pause\nfor a second\nyeah i want to just try to because i\nthink you're sharing a lot of really\nimportant stuff i just want to be able\nto process it before you keep going\ngo ahead\ni'm going to need like a long second\nokay take your time\ncan you tell me about transitioning to\npublic school and how that was different\nfor you\nyeah um so i i really wanted to get out\nof public school because\nbecause i was so rebellious and stuff i\nalso caused a lot of\ndrama with my friends and so when i left\ni remember\nbeing very dramatic about it and like i\ndidn't say bye to anybody\nand people were like leslie it really\nhurt this guy\nwho liked you that you didn't say bye or\nyou're like i remember just drama like\non the last day and i was\nso happy to get out of there and it was\na new start so i went to public school\nand then\nuh it was different because i kind of\ncame from being like a cool kid in\npublic school to a private\nschool to a complete like nobody\nlike new kid at a public school where\neverybody already knew each other\nbecause i joined in seventh grade and\neveryone had already\nbeen together since sixth grade so\nthings were established and i remember\nwalking around like i didn't know\nanybody and i would like my mom signed\nme up for choir so i immediately joined\nchoir and i found like a home\nin choir luckily and i found like a\nreally close knit of like\na group of three friends i think we met\nin like my history core class\nor something but i found a nice knit of\nfriends but i was\num and i hung out with my cousin who i\nrollerbladed a lot with\nshe was also like my best friend so we\nwent to school together and\nluckily we had each other so that was\nthat um\ni also shot up my grades i was instantly\nlike an a student\nbecause like uh because i came from like\nredoing like i took geometry or like\nclasses that i was basically redoing a\nyear because i was going faster at\nprivate so i already know that stuff so\ni immediately became a really good\nstudent so that was nice i started\nwriting for the school newspaper\num how did you feel about yourself\ngreat i was like wow i'm actually smart\nlike it felt weird to go from being\nthe dc student like okay i'm just the\nstupidest kid at my school\nto i'm passing this class and like\nhelping other kids like learn how to do\nstuff and i'm like hey like you need\nhelp i like i\ni did the stuff last year so immediately\num and i would like kind of gravitate\ntowards smarter students too\nwhat happened with the toilet paper in\nthe soap\nwhat about it did you continue doing it\nno\nno way i felt uh at\nit in sixth grade or fifth grade i felt\nlike\neveryone knew me to be rebellious i\nwould\ngo out of my way to make trouble because\nthat was my reputation as well and also\nit felt good to be rebellious and to say\nyeah\num oh um\nit felt good to well\ni don't know i felt it felt like i\nwas pissing off the people that like\nwere mean to me like my teachers\ni was like why are you so mean and like\nwhy do you get me in trouble all the\ntime or call me out all the time\nso to do that felt like yeah i did that\nand i don't care um and i guess i just\nthat was my attitude it's really bad and\nso i got really bad remarks on my\nreport card all the time i remember just\nlike out of line talks too much\ncauses troubles you know all this i was\nlike yeah\nand what what happened when you i i sort\nof jumped in a couple of times so what\nhappened when you\nso you were doing better in school the\nrebelliousness\nwent away do you have a sense of why\nwell at a new school i'm i've gone to\nthis private school since i was like a\nchild like i literally like first grade\nsecond all the way\num um i do remember one year sorry\ni went to fourth grade i switched\nschools because my mom switched work so\ni moved to\nthe same private school just a different\nbranch of it in fourth grade\nand i have an incident of i don't know\nwhy\nit happened but like or like i can't\nreally but maybe this will\nbut basically my teacher asked me like\nwhat\nor i had a best friend named danielle\nand her mom like worked she had really\nher mom had a really cool job\nand my teacher and she asked me like\nwhat my mom\ndid and i would tell all my friends i\nlied and i said\nmy mom works at the monterey bay\naquarium i don't know why i just thought\nit was the coolest job ever and my mom\nwas an accountant\nwhich i think is great now but back then\ni was like my mom's gonna count it\nthat's so boring\nso my friends moms were like i felt like\nthey were like oh really cool i don't\nknow so\nthey're like your mom works at the\naquarium and i was like\nyep so so anyways\nmy everyone started talking about my mom\nwho works at the monterey bay crime how\ncool is that anyway so then\nmy teacher like one time walked me to my\ncar\nmy mom was there to pick me up and he's\nlike oh i'm gonna come with you to talk\nto your mom about her job and i was like\nyou do not need to do that\nand he's like no no hey mrs foo i heard\nyou work at the monterey bay aquarium my\nmom's like\nno i'm gonna count\noh gosh i was so embarrassed i was like\nyeah i lied\ni don't know why i lied but that i don't\nknow that was like\nthis one side year i like lied a bunch i\ni don't know i just felt this need to be\ncooler than i was\num or and that was this one year where i\ncame from\nthe rebel rebellious school went to here\nand then\nand after that year i went back to that\nsame school and then i started doing all\nthe shenanigans again\num but i don't know there's just a side\ntangent and then\nyeah um lovely story that's just\nembarrassing i still sound\nsounds mortifying it was awful but i\nbrought it upon myself\nso um so then uh yeah so\nswitching to the new school like i think\ni'm not just gonna go to a new school\nwith a brand new like no reputation\nright and then just start causing\ntrouble\ni'm just like this is my chance to have\na new to turn over a new leaf and to\nmake a good reputation and\nso i think the first thing that gave me\nan identity was i was having a really\neasy time in school\nand so i started to make friends with\nall the other smarter kids so i started\nhanging out with smart\nsmart kids and i'm like wow you guys are\nreally smart so we're also\nall kind of smart and so we all just you\nknow we'd work on school and we'd have\nwe'd talk about things but we weren't\nlike the cool kids or anything kind of\nhang out and eat in the classroom and\nstuff\num but that was fine and it was\ndefinitely different\num and it's not like i was like goody\ntwo shoes i was always talkative\nand we get in trouble in almost all my\nclasses like i just talk a lot so in\nhigh school i remember\nmy i would yap all the time my teacher\nwould spray water at me sometimes\nbecause\ni was talking so much and then so that\nwas all the way until like senior year\nof high school\nso i was never like shy or anything or\njust like\ngood eating when they sprayed water at\nyou what do you imagine your teacher was\nfeeling in that moment\nangry that i'm not paying attention\ndisrespecting her like just having side\nconversations while she's like\ntrying to talk to the class so let me\nask you something this is once again\nloaded question i love this hypothesis\nmay not be\nso did you when you moved schools did\nyou become age\nno i couldn't achieve him what ayush was\ni've never been able to be asus\ni've like i've never gotten to that\npoint he's he achieved\nthat by fourth grade boy do you try\nyeah i'm i still am envious of there's\nand i see in people on twitch as well\nit's like their ability to\nto just immerse themselves and\nlive in the moment i see it in the way\nthey are and just the ability to like\nnot care i have like this thing holding\nme back that's like\nthat's like don't do that or else like\nyou're gonna embarrass yourself so just\nit you know it's always this thing\ni'm afraid of failure so i don't let\nmyself try those things but ayush\nif he was committed right and then he\nstumbled it felt like that stumble would\nbe more embarrassing than someone who's\nalready fumbling\nlike if he's committed and then and then\nhe goes uh\noh crap so i might but he and he would\nbut he just carried on through it\nbut i always thought if i committed so\nhard to something and i\nchoked that i would i would never be\nable to live that down so i was like\nokay it's fine just just\njust be just be average just don't like\ndo don't\ndon't stick out or don't like fully like\ncommit to anything and then you won't\nfully fail and that's why\ni still have that voice uh holds me back\na lot from trying things and\num yeah so one day i hope to like be\nable to achieve that or in my mind i\nactually\nthink in my in my head i tell myself\nyou're not actually capable of that\nthat's just not who you are you're not\nable to like\njust let go and fully commit to\nsomething\nwithout i i sense it in um you know\nactors\nactors who can like completely like i\nfeel like they're almost like a\ndifferent breed like\npeople who can just like you know like\naction and then they can like\ncommit to a scene so hard i i admire\nthose people i feel like that is just so\ncool that they can do that in front of\nso many people and cry\nand be vulnerable but like\ni i could never like i i just keeps you\nfrom doing that\nuh fear of i'm just insecure i think i'm\njust like\ni of of trying and then someone being\nlike yeah that's not it\nyeah he retried though you know i think\nthere's that voice\nof uh rejection of telling me like you\nknow if i never try\ncan't fail in that aspect right so i'm\njust oh i just look at actors and\nadmire them um but not just\ni view them as like like yeah like i'm\npretty sure\nshe was like in drama and all that stuff\ni think it comes with a lot of\npeople who are able to put themselves\nout there it's so cool and i i've always\nlooked up to them\nbut never have i wanted to dock someone\nin my whole life\ni want to track down and i don't know if\nthat's the right term\ni do i'm so curious what this guy's up\nto now\ni know okay so\nso foosley i i think um for better or\nfor worse i i think i have some guidance\nfor you\nokay\nso i think it's beautiful that you\nshared that little anecdote at the\nbeginning about falling asleep\nbecause you know the funny thing about\nfalling asleep is that the harder you\ntry the harder it becomes\nyes and and i think that's a beautiful\nparallel for like just\nyou so there's some like weird kind of\nlike psychological stuff going on so i\nthink part of your hesitation to commit\nis because there's a part of you that\nstill feels so\nwhat i what i'm guessing foosley and\nthis is you know i don't really know\nit's just something for you to think\nabout\nso i tend to offer people hypotheses as\nopposed to conclusions but i make them\nsound like conclusions really you\nwho decides so what i'm getting the\nsense is that like\nthere's private school leslie who's\nburied\nunderneath public school leslie who's\nburied underneath you\nand so the problem is that like the\nfoosley of today can't ever commit\nbecause you don't\nknow whether private school leslie or\npublic school leslie\nyou don't know like who you are like\nwhich one of those is the real you\nand the reason you can't commit is\nbecause like because now you've built up\nthis kind of shell right like where\nyou're like private school leslie like\nyou're successful you're engaged\nyou're a streamer you have all these\nthings to be proud of but underneath\nlike\nis public school i mean is private\nschool leslie just like lurking like is\nthat person who couldn't do anything\nright and no matter how hard she tried\nright because that's the fear is like\nyou you gave it your best and it just\nwasn't enough yeah\nand you know i heard you rebelling and i\nthink it's interesting because when you\nwe conceptualize things we're like a lot\nmore\num we think of ourselves as far more\nautonomous than we are\nso i don't think that you went to your\nnew school and were like this is an\nopportunity for me to reinvent myself i\nthink it's actually the other way around\nwhere like\nyou went to a new school you were filled\nwith anxiety you kind of stumbled into\nbeing one of the smart kids and you're\nlike oh wait a second\ni don't have to be what i was before i\ncan reinvent myself\nbut that process of reinvention happens\nafter like the realization that you're\nreinventing itself\ncomes second not first the reinvention\nalready happens\nso what i'm really hearing from you is\nthat like you know you're\nyou can't you can't commit to being who\nyou\nare and you call it insecurity which i\nthink is a wonderful umbrella term\nbut what it really is is like i think\nyou're you know i would venture that\nyou're maybe afraid\nthat who you are fundamentally\nis not good enough and that's where we\nget to the age pressure\nbecause if you don't have faith in\nyourself you need a playbook\nright like if i trust who i am\ni can go up on stage and i can give it\nmy all and come hell or high water like\nit'll\ni'll fail magnificently or i'll succeed\ngloriously\nthere's still magnificence and glory in\neach one\nbut if i don't have faith in myself\nand i'm not willing to do that then i\nneed a teleprompter\nright like i need a playbook that like\nby 23 i gotta do this by this i gotta do\nthis because like walking my own path\nlike may not be good enough\nbecause i think this is where we sort of\nget into the age pressure which is sort\nof\nyou know you talk about living in the\npresent and and now we get to something\nwhich is like i think you've learned\nthat the present is actually a really\npainful like it sucks to be the present\nyeah right and and you kind of say that\nyou're kind of talking about and it's\nit's definitely a shared experience\nwhere you know\nthe four years between 14 and 18 are way\nlonger than the 10 years between 25 and\n35\nyes and and so that's a common shared\nexperience\nand so i i think you sort of started to\nlike\nadopt like you started to like become\nsomething right in\nin public school and you're like okay\ni'm gonna do things right and this is\nwhere the voice comes in\nand like the voice is like okay i've to\ndo a good job i've got to do a good job\ni've got to do it the right way i can't\ndo it\nbecause in public in private school did\nyou do it the right way or did you do it\nyour way\nmy way and how did that work out for you\nbad and when you were in public school\ndid you do it the right way or did you\ndo it your way\nthe right way and how did that work out\nfor you\nbetter yeah good right and so now we see\nlike the pressure there's a script\nbecause you learned like very early on\nthat your way is a bad way\nand the right way is a good way and and\nnow it's getting even more confusing\nbecause now you're actually learning\nthat that's not actually true\nthat you can do it your way and your way\ncan do the right way but then there's\nlike\nthere's like a like a private school\nlittle\nfourth grade leslie who's like why would\nyou stop being a ush\nyou you did it you did it you were on\nthe right track and\neven now you can hear the qualification\nright you've never become age and i\nasked you\nin in public school was at the right and\nyou were like yeah it was decent\nthere's a step in the right direction\nyou qualify it you can't really own it\nand so there's this part of you that\nlike wants to be this perfect thing and\nlike\nbeing you is not that perfect thing but\nnow you're confused because as you're\nmature and stuff like that there's a 28\nyear old you who's like\ni found my person we're gonna get\nmarried when it's like convenient for us\nto get married\nwe're gonna probably have kids i want to\nhave kids and but it's weird because you\nhave these like three voices right\nthere's private school leslie\nthere's public school leslie and then\nthere's like the leslie of today\nand so you say and now what what you're\nnoticing is like\nactually i'm living way too fast like\nthis is too much too\nfast and this is where you kind of talk\nabout the industry\nand there's like this is this one\nopportunity to like go to germany and\nmeet this person and this is this one\nopportunity and this one opportunity let\nme live in the present let me live in\nthe present let me look i have so much\npresent to live in\noh my god let's live in all the present\nlet's do it all right now every day\nlive in the present baby let's go let's\ngo let's go live in a present oh\nyeah right yeah it's like like you're\nfalling into this really bizarre trap of\nlike\ntrying to force yourself to fall asleep\nand it's like the more you try to live\nin the present\nthe more fast forward your life becomes\nit's like yeah let's take advantage of\nthis opportunity separation is only\ngoing to happen once\nin the present yeah yeah let's go\nright so true\nand so it like it's it's really\nchallenging because i think in order\nto live in the present now now you know\nwe get to be wise\nyou ready for the wisdom yes i'm ready\nin order to in order to live in the\npresent you have to let go of the desire\nof living in the present\nbecause it is the desire for living in\nthe present that has you living in the\nfuture and fast forwarding your life\ni'm sorry do i get rid of that desire to\nlive in the present\nyou don't get rid of the desire to live\nin the present you just don't give in to\nit\nright so like like i i know it sounds\nweird but very practically\nyou know like i know it sounds weird but\nlike\nso if you go to a conference and you ask\nyourself the question\nis this me trying to live in the present\nand then your answer is going to be yes\nbecause this is a wonderful opportunity\nthat i can treasure\nand i can be in the present if i go to\nthe conference but that's what you've\nalways said and then you go to six\nconferences and then\nlife passes you by so oddly enough\nyou should ask yourself is this me\ntrying to live in the present and if the\nanswer is yes don't do it\nit's gonna be really difficult i know\nit's confusing isn't it\nwhat okay i but then when will i ever\ndo anything exactly and that's what\nliving in the present is\nright because the present is not about\ndoing it's about is it's about being\nit's not about doing\nso like what what you are is a doer\ninstead of a beer\nyeah like doing is about like like even\nwhen you\ndo something truly in the present you're\nnot doing it you're becoming it\nlike like i know this sounds weird but\nlike you know i i've been working\nwith some esports professionals recently\nand we talk about\nbecoming one with the game they're not\nplaying the game anymore\nthey like become this weird like super\nhuman thing where they're like one with\nthe game and you'll see it if you like\nwatch esports where there\nthere's like one thing where like it\nlooks like they're hacking\nlike they their game sense is just out\nof this world\nand they like predict things it looks\nlike their reactions like they've got\nsome sort of weird like\nyou know like map hacker like you know\nsome like you know aimbot or something\nit's not that they have an aimbot it's\nthat they know where the enemy is going\nto be\nyeah and they even like shoot the bullet\nbefore they see them on the screen\nand then lo and behold the person shows\nup and then you know they get sniped\nand it's and isn't that like float flow\nstate\nabsolutely so the flow state is not like\nand so the more that you try to do\nyeah the less you be\nand the purest form of doing is actually\nbeing\nwhen you become like one with the object\nright like like when i'm not i'm not a\nperson\nanymore like i'm not someone who's doing\nsomething i\nam that thing like you become like like\nyou know an embodiment of like valorant\nwhatever that is or whatever you know\nyeah what what do you think about that\ni i actually think that that makes sense\ni have like\nwatched a lot of videos about like the\nflow state and like yeah when i\nand i've like i want to achieve that and\ni know how it feels\nto like be in that flow state\nuh and like i know i love that feeling\nand sometimes it's me even like working\nor something i'm like\ni just feel like this sense of like i\ncan't be interrupted because what i'm\ndoing is i'm just so one with what i'm\ndoing\nmy mind is like going and i'm like i\nfeel like very present in that moment\nand i\nreally love that but i don't know how to\naccess it regularly yes so we're gonna\nget to that\nyeah so i'm so perfect so let me ask you\nsomething\nwhen you access the flow state before\nyou access the flow state did you want\nto access the flow state\ni think i always want to but i i didn't\nuh\nlook at refresh yes did you try to\naccess the flow state when you succeed\nin accessing the flow state uh\nsometimes sometimes sometimes it's like\ni put myself in the right minds i clean\nmy space\ni take drink lots of coffee and i like\nclear my mind i have everything else\ndone\naround me so i don't have random\ndistractions and i can like set myself\nup but i can't always\nguarantee it it's kind of like a it\nsometimes is and sometimes there isn't\ngood so so so so i know it sounds okay\nso\nlet me think about it okay we're going\nto talk about flow state and the prac\nlike the practicalities then we're going\nto talk about your life again and this\nwhole like\nstop trying to do so much yeah um and\nand that kind of business okay so the\nfirst thing is that so i like sleep\na lot because um and i like this\ndiscussion of the flow state because\nlike the yogis in india understood this\nreally really well\nso part of the thing is that they they\nhave so many different they have like as\nmany words for snow that eskimos do is\nlike\nthey have tons of words for\nconsciousness in states of mind\nso what they recognized is that you\ncan't enter\na state a flow state so flow state is a\nstate of consciousness\ncalled diana and that's one word for it\nanyway\nso diane is like a state of mind so it's\nkind of like\nsleep so can you go to sleep\nthink thank you how tell me\ninstruct me in how to sleep close your\neyes\nand then you you think i my trick is\nthat i\nthink about a very specific memory from\nlike\nfourth or fifth grade and i try to\nrecall every detail of that story\nit's like i'm watching a mini movie of\nmy life or like yes last night i did\nhigh school\nbut like every night i pick a night or a\nday i think ah\nseventh grade and i just go down seventh\ngrade in my mind\nand like what it was like and who i was\ntalking with or a specific\naim conversation i had with them and as\ni think more and more details\nso interesting so the way that you sleep\nis you start\nso sleep is recalling lots of memories\nabout a particular day in your past\nyeah is that what sleep is well no\nthat sleep is when you're actually\nunconscious and then it that\nthat helps me relax and then but\nhow do i sleep is recall\nsleep because you're telling me that\nwhat you're doing is recall no\nrecall leads to sleep for me okay so now\nwe get\ngood so one is an action one is a doing\nthe recall is the doing and the sleep is\nthe happening\nthere's a doing and there's a happening\nthere's a doing and there's a being\nand the two are different fundamentally\ndifferent and so your problem about like\ntrying to live in the present\nis that you're trying to do the being\nyeah but the being in the doing are\ndifferent\nyes right just like you said so you've\nfigured out a dharma so now we get to\nthe verb part\nso diane or the flow state is a state of\nmind it's a noun it's not a verb\nyou can't do it you can't be in the\npresent\nbeing and just think about it for a\nsecond b is a beaver\nright it's not like an action verb so\nyou can't be in the present\nlike it's not something you can do you\ncan exist in the present\nbut it's not like an action like i'm not\nlike uh okay\ni'm gonna do a little bit of being right\nnow you ready\noh man do you see that guy that guy is\nan olympic runner man he can run so fast\nthat guy's a pro gamer he can play so\nwell dude did you see that guy\nlook at him being man like oh damn that\nguy's like olympic level\npro level being look at him oh\nright right damn look at that\noh my god did you see his moves\nlook at him being there oh my god sick\nsick can't do that you can't do the big\nthe doing being are fundamentally\ndifferent things if i am saying like i\nam in the present that statement alone\nis like now i'm not in the present\nsort sorry okay yeah so so so like\ni would say that you can still be in the\npresent\nbut i'm trying to be in the present\nmeans you're not in the present like the\ntrying is like the action verb right so\nit's like\nso so so the focusing technique so this\nis what the the\nyogi's figured out the same thing you\nfigured out good job foosley\nwhich is that there is there is a verb\ncalled focus\nso this is so what you do is a focusing\ntechnique\nyou like pick a particular memory and\nwhat you do is you make your mind\none pointed on one thing and so like the\nway this works with sleep is that\nnormally\nall these different thoughts interfere\nwith our ability of sleep\nso our mind can't we can't clear our\nmind but what the mind is really good at\nis letting one thing block out\neverything else which is why we love\nvideo games and why they're so [ __ ]\naddictive\nbecause like i can play a video game and\nit can knock out everything\nelse so what you start is a focus\na verb and then when you do the dharuna\nis as long as you sit with that tarana\nfor a while\nyour mind does something really cool\nwhich is a general principle which is\nlike\nit acclimatizes that and and it starts\nstops\nexperiencing it and so what i mean by\nthat is like if you walk into a room\nyou'll notice the smell and then within\na few seconds\nyour brain literally blocks out the\nsignal of the smell\nit acclimatizes to it when i put on this\nshirt i feel it\nbut then within a few seconds i stopped\nfeeling it so over time when you focus\non one thing\nyou use that to push all the other\nthoughts out of your mind and then when\nyou sit with that one thing\neventually your mind will get used to it\nand then it's gone\nand then you are in a no-mind state\nthat's when you\nfall asleep when you acclimatize to it\nyeah okay so and also you figured out\nlike just like the flow state like it's\nweird that you talk about these weird\nthings like you clean your room before\nit flow safe how on earth does that work\nso once again there's a sanskrit word\nfor that\nmeans cleansing and so what people\nfigured out is that an important part of\nmeditation practice\nis people who clean their room enter the\nstate of dion more easily than people\nwho do not\nand it's just something about that like\nthe rote mechanical\nlike putting things in order there's\nsome kind of like if you really think\nabout it like cleaning\nis like not a mentally activating\nactivity\nit is like a mentally like calming\nactivity right so like your mind is like\nfocused on this little menial task\nyou can't really think about other stuff\nso cleaning is actually a really\npowerful form\nof almost like daruna because you know i\ncan't really\nyou know my mind if i'm sitting there\ni'll get bored and my mind can wander it\ncan think about all kinds of things\nanxieties and whatnot when i'm cleaning\nit's like it requires just enough brain\npower\nso that i can't be anxious at the same\ntime yeah\nyes when i'm stressed i clean when i do\nlike when anything is bothering me\ni look around my room and i just start\npicking things up and it immediately\nalleviates it as things are getting\nclean yeah so it's weird but like you\nfigured this stuff out which is\nfantastic so yeah so that should be\nand so like there are other things that\nyou can do to prime yourself to be\nkind of in the present so i'm gonna have\nto think a little bit about you know\ni'll teach you a formal practice to try\nto get you into the flow state in a few\nminutes i just have to think about what\nthat is and where you are\nbut now i want to talk a little bit\nabout living in the present so i want to\ngo back to this idea of like you know if\nyou\ntell yourself in order to live in the\npresent i must go do this\nhow do you feel about not doing those\nthings\nsad because it's like in my mind that's\nwhat life is kind of all about it's like\nto go make those connections that to\nthose people that you met\nor to like i don't know that's just and\ngo travel see other parts of the world\nand me staying in my room or at my house\nis like more of the same so time if\nanything in my mind will pass quicker\nbecause it's the same\nit's like routine so my brain will just\nmesh all those days together but if i\nget up\ngo somewhere and you know talk to all\nthese people meet all these people\num it it's like yeah that that's\nin my mind that's gonna if anything slow\nthings down\num yeah so so that makes a lot of sense\nso let me add a couple of like nuances\nor caveats here so the first is that\nif you're not going to a conference and\nyou maintain your same routine at home\nit's not going to work at all so the\ngoal\nis for you to like not do your home\nroutine\nat home which i know sounds weird\num but then then you may actually have\nto leave so like i'm not saying don't go\nsomewhere because it could be a good\nidea to leave but what i want you to be\ncareful about\nis going somewhere with the intention\nof getting the most juice out of life\nyeah because it is that juice it is that\ndesire\nof getting the most out of something it\nis that hunger from the flow state\nwhich prevents you from getting into the\nflow state to begin with\nright so like i think you can go\nsomewhere by all means\nlike go somewhere peaceful but don't try\nto be in the present just go there just\nto\nhang out don't try to accomplish\nanything because flow states are not\nabout accomplishing and in fact\nthe harder you try to accomplish the\nfurther away the flow state becomes\nthe flow state is about letting go sleep\nis about letting go\nthe harder you tell yourself oh my god i\nneed to fall asleep i need to fall\nasleep right now i'm gonna be so tired\ntomorrow i'm gonna be so tired tomorrow\nlet's go oh let's go baby olympic\nsleeper let's go\noh yeah let's go\nlet's go son that's me right\nyeah and so the more that your mind is\ndoing that like\nthe less in the present you're going to\nbe because your mind is like let's go\nfast forward baby like six conferences\nin one year like\ntwo is for scrubs yeah\nprivate school leslie like we're like\nwe're like hey you should do\nten every week he shows up and he goes\nto every one of those conferences\nand he performs like it was his last day\non earth so we're gonna go to this\nconference it's gonna be a last\nconference on earth we're gonna form\nconnections we have deep conversations\nlet's go that's me yeah that's exactly\nhow it feels it's like okay like\nthis one's over now on to the next one\nat that one i'm gonna schedule all these\ntimes to meet all these people\ni'm gonna boom boom boom boom boom and\nthen it goes like that and i'm like wow\nwhere did that go yeah absolutely right\nso so if we think about it you know this\nthe speed of your thoughts is going to\ncorrelate with like something about your\nexperience of time\nand there you are whipping yourself to\nget like the most out of this experience\nthat the experience\nwhooshes right by you and so in order to\nslow down you have to like\nstop trying to slow like get so much out\nof life you know it's sort of like\nokay like let's go to this conference\nand just see how it goes like\nmaybe i'll i'll hang out with some\npeople like that's cool\ni love that but how do i do that like i\nah you love the idea of it so\nso this is how you do it see your\nproblem is the question that you just\nasked\nbecause you're like how do i do that\nthere it is again there's your mind\ndo it let's go like how do i like yeah\nlike tell me\ntell me how do i be in an olympic level\nyeah that's what i want\nyeah let's go sorry\nthere you are again you see yeah yeah\ni'm all about\nefficiency in life yeah and like yeah\nlike\ni when i buy things that's like best\nreviewed things\nsit with this foosley you don't\nyou don't do what i'm telling you to do\nyou can't do it\nhow does that feel\nand if i can't do it then\nand then it's impossible he said i can't\ndo it so\nso if i can't do it then then i might as\nwell\nwell\nkeep going keep going it's new territory\nfor you so it's going to\nyou're saying i can't i i can't\nuh like what can't i do\nlike be present i can't be present it's\njust not possible for me to remember\nyep it's just impossible so then what\ndoes your mind do\nwell go back to the conventions and\njust go back to how it was if i can't\nachieve the other one\nyep yeah and in doing so you will be one\nstep closer to being present\njust by acknowledging or see because\nit's\nit's it's kind of like saying like ah\n[ __ ] it this night is ruined\ni'm i'm not gonna be able to fall asleep\nand then it disarms the anxiety and you\npass out\nyeah that's very true once i give up\nand snap my eyes open i'm like eh yeah\nyeah so so like so being in the present\nis about\nletting go now you understand what\nletting go is\nbecause when once you take that burden\naway from yourself\nthat you don't have to be a ush you\ndon't have to make the most of it are\nyou going to go to the conference\nabsolutely but you know what you're not\ngoing to be able to be present\nbecause you just suck at that all right\nso let's just\ngo and let's just like let's at least\nhave a good time like\nsure it's gonna pass me by i'm gonna\nfeel exhausted at the end of it i'm\ngonna have to go back to streaming\ni'm gonna regret it in a couple of days\nand i'm gonna have all these like\nchoice memories to hang on to and at\nleast i'll have made the most of it\nbut i'm not gonna be present it's gonna\nactually be kind of crappy it'll be like\nsort of fun but it'll be like exhausting\nit's just like it is what it is let's\njust go for it\nand then boom you'll be present\nbut you can't trick yourself into doing\nthat because you can't say oh oh oh this\nis how i'd be present i pretend that i'm\nnot going for the presents\noh oh oh let's pretend i'm gonna\nbeat that and uh the no no you can't\ntrick yourself you really have to just\nyou can't do it yeah yeah\nthis i had like um so twitchcon\num is it i don't know if you've been to\noh i probably haven't been to twitchcon\nbut twitchcon is like this\nconvention that like you know you go and\nit's like a very hyped up event because\nit's like the one time of year\ni'm gonna be at a place and all the\npeople who watch me are my friends or\nwhatever\nthey know where to find me like this is\nthat one place and they find each other\nit's like this super hype weekend\neverybody gets to meet each other and\nit's like in my mind this is the one\nweekend i need to be\nlike there i need to be like\nas much yes anyways i do this meet up at\nthe end of it\nand i remember there in my mind there\nwas so much pressure leading up to that\nand me and edison actually got into a\nfight like\nright before it to the point where like\ni was like we're arguing and i'm like\nplease can we make this argument end\nright now because i need to go\nto this meetup and i need to be in a\ngood mood like i can't be\ncrying and i was so mad at this time\nthat\nwas like that was like okay three\no'clock you need to be at this park\nand you need to be happy you need to be\nready to meet people and it's like\ntwo what 2 15 and i'm crying in a hotel\nroom and me and edison are like\nsitting there like and he's like i don't\nwant you i want you to be happy but like\nwe need to resolve this and i'm like can\nwe resolve it later it's just so i\nremember being so frustrated\nbecause like i just needed to be in the\nbest mood and\nready to be like and it was anyways i\nalways come back to that when i think of\ntime\nconvention pressure and like needing to\nbe\nyeah so i don't know that's just so\nhere's what i'm hearing i gotta be happy\nlet's go [ __ ] happy time good moon\nyeah what the hell is wrong with you why\ncan't you be happy right now\ncome on yep be happy\nright that's what i like that's the best\ni don't have the language\nthere's no word yeah\nlike that is not being in the present\nyeah i know\nwhat i'm hearing is accept those moments\nwhere you're not like that like edison\nright it sounds like you just met a dude\nand he's dope\nit's like oh my god he proposed to me he\nrented out the entire symphony hall\nand there was a 64-piece orchestra it\nwas so great we had an instagram\nphotographer who took care of everything\nno he he proposed to you with\nchipotle bag yeah\nat the end of a marathon stream where he\nwas like mentally fatigued\nthat's your life and it's perfect\nthe way it is you don't need to have the\nscript yeah\nright and so in terms of twitchcon by\nall means be on on twitchcon but what's\nhappening the other 51 weekends of the\nyear\nuh i'm working usually streaming\nokay so like i will allow you\nand it sounds so controlling but i will\nallow you\nto be bent out of shape for twitchcon\nlet that go you can't you can't be\npresent during twitchcon don't worry\nabout it don't try to be present\ntoo much pressure too important too\nprofessional\ntoo important for your career fine so\nlet that what about the other 51\nweekends\nyou know well well there's another\ntwitchcon in europe that happened so\nthat twitchcon as well ah\noh okay so that's two out of 52.\nwhat about the other 50 then okay\nthere's lacks okay well uh\nokay fine right so like like so there's\nlike six or eight\nand sure so like that's where you gotta\nall really think about do you need to go\nto all these why do you need to go to\nall these because ah\nokay you know how you just described\nthat as how my weeks are\nlike i have an empty week on my calendar\nand it'll be like monday tuesday\nwednesday thursday friday saturday\nsunday right\nand i have empty bubbles for it and then\nmy weeks\nall slowly fill up as people say hey can\nyou do this sponsor\nhey can you do this call at this time\nfor that sponsor hey do you want to play\nthis game on this day\nhey and my brain is like yep yep yep\nsounds good okay oh excited cool my\nweek's filling out doom\ndoom so i slowly start typing it at all\nand then my week starts going like it\nlooks\ni'm like whoa and i read that out and\nthen people are like you need to slow\ndown yeah yep so so that's where the key\nthing there\nis when you get that phone call what\nhappens in your mind\ncan you do this it says well\nokay well yes so for me it's like of\ncourse i can do that\ni want to do that because uh if it's a\nsponsor it's like well\nit goes back to well here's x amount of\ndollars\nand i'm not going to be able to make x\namount of dollars when i'm 35\nbecause i'm not gonna have a job in my\nmind because that you know\nback to where i thought so now i must\nwork now so\nyes i will take that and the call i have\nto take that because that goes along\nwith the sponsor\nuh you know and then my friends asked me\nto play a game well of course i'm gonna\nplay the game because\ni knock two things out at once i get to\nhang out with my friends and work\nso and content double which you know so\nof course\nso it starts to fill out like that and\nthen everything is like i can always\nreason it back to of course yes\nyes must yes yep so so good so\nthe couple random questions are you\nafraid of death\ndo you i always think death a lot all\nthe time\ntwice a day twice a day yeah okay\nyeah you sound something to me like\nsomeone who's afraid of death um\nso so um wait what does that mean\nyou sound to me like someone who's\nafraid of death\nlike i mean everyone's a little bit\nafraid of death but this sounds to me\nlike someone who like thinks about it\ntwice a day\nyeah okay um so so because it's kind of\nlike this idea that like\nyou know once you're gone you can't have\nanything with anyone so there's a\ncertain like desperation\nto like living life it's like you've got\nto live as much life as you can before\nit's too late\nso oddly enough you know one thing that\nyou can do is work on your fear of death\nand as you get\nmore comfortable with that a lot of the\nstuff will actually melt away\num it's weird but there's a there's an\ninteresting book called the tibetan book\nof living and dying and\nand there's a there's there's a\nparticular sect of monks who sort of\nthink that\nall of our fears and attachments come\nfrom a fear of death hasn't been really\nmy experience i think\nyou know some of our attachments come\nfrom\nyou know seeing ayush every week uh but\nyeah you know but but i i think so sorry\nfor\ni just wanted to check that box or try\nto see if this kind of makes sense but\num kind of coming back to what to do so\ni want you to notice that in that chain\nthere's one really important thing which\nis like when i'm\n35 this opportunity won't be available\nyeah and in a sense that could be true\nbut like why is that a problem\num because then you know in my mind i'm\nmy work i always think\nuh protect yourself from the worst case\nscenario so\nyou know when a time when like cancel\nculture is very real\num and i've seen like a lot of my peers\njust like\nlose their jobs and stuff i kind of like\ndon't know what i do\nwithout my job right now or like i'm not\nsure how to handle it so i kind of want\nto like\ncushion myself for like that time when\ni'm unemployed\nso that's why so foosley i think this\nthis gets tricky i think it's probably\nbeyond the scope of what we can cover\nbecause this is a whole thing that we do\nwith like creators as a whole like in\nour i don't know if you know this but we\nhave like a creator coaching program\nso there's like you know we talk about\nyou know like cancel\nptsd and and things like that but um\nwe just this is where i think there's a\nbalance between being like\ncalculated and acknowledging that this\nopportunity may not last forever and\nalso\nrecognizing that there is the truth\nof that and then there is the fear of\nthat\nright and be really careful about which\none is dictating your actions\nbecause i suspect that strategizing for\nit\nand being afraid of it that you're\nactually like a little bit heavier on\nthe fear end of the spectrum\nso that's what's causing you to like\ntake too many opportunities\nyeah and what we actually find is that\nlike when people start to really\nacknowledge this\nthat actually their performance actually\nimproves\nright so it's kind of weird but like we\nhad a call\nin from an investment banker a couple\nlike a week ago\nmonday maybe and and it's i've worked\nwith a lot of investment bankers and\nthey're so\nanxious about doing a good job that they\ndo a bad job\nyou know absolutely right because it's\nlike i'm trying so hard it's like\nuh gotta be calm gotta be relaxed gotta\nsound good like gotta be in a good mood\ngotta crack jokes gotta be impressive\ngotta do all of it and then like the\nmore you\nuh it like the worse you do\nand so what actually happens is like\nlike what i have to train them in\nis like learning how to let go of doing\na good job\nright and the more you let go of doing a\ngood job like sure you have to account\nyou can't like\nshow up on twitch and like you know drop\nn bombs or like say like really like of\ncourse you're going to get cancelled\nbut like the strategic thinking around\navoiding getting cancelled\nand the fear of getting canceled\ncontrolling your decisions\nand like letting that desperation drive\nyou is not going to lead to like\ncontentment happiness and living in the\npresent it's going to lead to the rat\nrace\nrat race like\nit's gonna read lead to this idea of\nlike you know constantly on the move\nalways got to be grinding fast forward\nyeah that's me right\nand so yeah i mean i think you just\nreally got to be careful about that\ndecision-making process and like ask\nyourself\nwhen am i giving in to fear like is this\ndecision\nstrategic or fearful and there's always\ngoing to be a good reason\nto take those calls right and so just\nthink a little bit about like try to\nblock off one time where there's like no\nstuff during that time\nand then you're going to want to move it\naround and someone's going to be like\ncan you do this and they're like yeah oh\ni can do that yeah absolutely\nand then just be aware like no this is\nmy time and you're gonna have to do\nthings that can are gonna feel stupid to\nyou\nlike it's gonna feel dumb like i'm gonna\nmiss out on this opportunity yeah\nyou're gonna miss out on the opportunity\nabsolutely that's the point you need to\nlearn how to miss out on opportunities\nyeah and then you'll be able to be in\nthe present\nand during that time of nothingness like\nis there something i should do god\nthat's a terrible question\nyou're learning you see\nyou see you see how like how calcified\nit is\nyeah it's my first thought like what do\ni do during that time\nof nothing um yeah\ndr k how can i make the how can i make\nthe most productive use of my\nnothingness time\nhow do i be the most efficient is there\na practice can i meditate a particular\nway yes yes\nso notice the absurdity of it right it's\nlike what\nhow do i have the most fun during my\nrelaxation time\nyes ah it's ingrained it is\nabsolutely right so that's how our mind\nworks it's ingrained\nthe good news is that every time you\nnotice it foosley it gets less ingrained\nyeah so noticing actually chips away at\nit and then i will give you a practice\nso let me just think about that unless\nyou have other questions\nno that was very helpful like that just\nthat\nyeah yeah good\nright so so like here's the cool thing\nis that\nwhen you made that realization you\nweren't\noh right you were like\nlol that's what it is\nit's like it's like a realization that's\nactually calm the harder you try like\nyou weren't actually paying attention\nyou caught it you didn't hunt it does\nthat make sense\nat that moment and so that's what\nhappens those moments of realization are\nnot\nhunted they're discovered and there's a\nbig difference one is doing one is being\ni'm just scared that like i mean i have\nto cut like it's very easy for me to\nfall back into that like i need\nsure you in my head to remind me\nyou know yeah yeah so so this is where\nfoosley no you don't\nyou don't need me because it's okay to\nfall back into it\nthat's you see how like it's okay to\nfall like you're gonna fall\nso be it you don't need to be perfect\nthat's like a slightly different thing\nbut it's kind of the same thing where\nyou don't need me you're fine just the\nway you are\nyou caught it like i didn't point it out\nto you you caught it yourself\nhave faith right you'll catch it\ntrue okay so meditation\nokay so i'm gonna teach you a technique\nthat is a little bit\num has two parts so one part i'm happy\nto teach\num today and then if you do this\ntechnique for some amount of time and we\ndo meet at a convention i will teach you\npart two but part two really shouldn't\nbe talked publicly\nit's not like shady or anything but um\nit you know other humans can be in the\nroom it's not\nbut but it is it is something that's\nlike a little bit more\nso there are some cases of\nmeditation-induced psychosis\nand meditation is not without risks so\nthis is a technique\nthat like sometimes like needs to be\ntaught like when people are ready for it\nso i won't like teach it publicly\noh okay it does it doesn't have to be\nlike late at night or like other humans\ncan be in the room i just don't want to\nteach it on stream or even i can teach\nyou privately in a call\nin a video call um but there's sort of a\nphase one and there's a phase two okay\nbecause phase two is like really intense\num but phase one is gonna be uh a\ntechnique called thrataka which i think\nwould be a good fit for you so trotaka's\nfixed point gazing\nso here are the reasons that i think\nit'll be good for you first is that\ntechnically it's a should be technique\nit's a cleansing technique even though\nwe teach it as meditation\nwhat it actually does is sort of cleanse\nyour mind that's the mechanism through\nwhich it works\nantarctica is fixed point gazing so what\nwe're going to do is teach you to stare\nat like one point and like just stare at\nit without closing your eyes\nand then the reason the long-term reason\ni'm sort of picking this a couple of\nother things from a temperamental\nstandpoint\none is that it sounds like you're\nactually good at focusing your attention\nlike you practice you practice this\nsounds like every night before you go to\nbed\nso this is going to be practicing your\nattention in a slightly different way\nit's a hard technique to teach people\nlike usually for introductions i'll\nteach like breathing stuff because\nbreathing is easy\nit's a little bit more hardcore it's a\nlittle bit more okay\nwhich you're so good at and the second\nthing is the second phase of this\ntechnique\nwill start to help you work on that fear\nof death\nokay so that's why i want to kind of\nteach you this so what i'm gonna do\nis pull something up okay\nokay sorry for you know if i was\ncreeping you out with all the has to be\ntaught in private no\nno i i didn't think it was i just was\nlike what what could be\nyet to go like i don't know i just i was\njust\nyeah not creeped out\nlet me ask you something um\nwhat do you want in your life i know\nit's kind of a broad question\nwhat do you want i want\num\nlike can i just list off a bunch of\nthings that i want yes go for it\nhappiness my parents happiness\nto make an impact meaningful connections\nto people\num to\nbe present and yeah and\num to be secure\nin like financially but also just myself\nto accept myself um\nif i had to give you a choice between\npower wisdom and happiness which one\nwould you pick\nhappiness okay\nperfect\nalright so this is what we're gonna do\ni'm going to show you i'm going to\nscreen share something with you okay\nuh how am i going to do this we're going\nto do see if this works\nnope so we're not gonna see your\nyeah we'll just stick with this one okay\nso then what i'm gonna do\nwe're gonna move this over here\nso and then\nshare can you see this\nyes okay\nso this is what i want you to do so what\nwe're going to do is\nlook at um\nso i want you to i'm going to ask you to\nfocus your eyes on the red dot in the\ncenter\ndo you see the red dot in the center yep\nokay\nso i'll explain the practice first so\nwhat we're going to do is try to look at\nthe red dot in the center without\nblinking\nand then what i'm going to have you do\nis rotate your attention to different\nthings\nso i'll ask you like what colors you see\nin particular places but i don't want\nyou to change where your eyes are\nlooking\ni want you to keep your eyes focused on\nthe red dot but then kind of answer my\nquestions\nokay okay so a couple of things about\nthratika so\nyou know there's going to be a little\nbit of a strain on the eyes if it starts\nto get like really unbearable you can go\nahead and close them\nbut we're gonna do our best not to blink\nand not to close our eyes\nokay we're gonna try to not blink for\nabout 60 seconds to begin with\nyou may end up blinking which is okay\nyou can do a quick blink and then open\nthem again and then keep looking\nokay okay so start by closing your eyes\nsitting up straight and take a deep\nbreath\nand another\njust take a moment just keep breathing\ndeeply take a moment to just sort of\nnotice\nthat the conversation has been pretty\nanimated\nwe've talked about a lot of stuff maybe\nthere's a lot to think about\nwhatever notice just all those kind of\nthoughts\nall these desires goals whatever just\nkind of notice the energy of the\nconversation\nand that now we're going to kind of\nrecalibrate and just for\na few moments we're going to be\ncompletely encompassed by our practice\nand that the stream and the rest of the\nworld will kind of continue\nonward outside of our bubble but that\nfor a few moments like 60 seconds 90\nseconds\nmaybe two or three minutes we're just\ngoing to try to be at this inside this\nbubble\nand now when you're ready open your eyes\nand then stare at the red dot\nare you looking yes so now what i want\nyou to do\nis tell me while you're staring at the\nred dot what is the outermost color\nof the image um\nyellow okay and what is the next color\ninside the yellow green\nand then inside that\nyellow and inside that\nblue and inside that\nyellow and inside that\num yellow okay so now what i want you to\ndo is go\nall the way look at each color put your\nattention on each color on your own just\nlike i'm asking you\nand notice the color and then move in\nand move in\nand move in at your own pace and try to\nkeep\nall of your kind of like keep your eyes\nfocused on the dot and let your\nconcentration collapse inward towards\nthe dot\none layer at a time\nthis is very difficult yes it is so move\nat your own pace it's okay\n[Music]\nit's really hard i can't do this so so\nthen go\nclose okay closer to the screen no no no\nno just look at the red dot\njust okay put all of your attention now\non the red dot\nokay okay just stare at the red dot\nand then look at the color that is\nclosest to the red dot what do you see\nyellow\nand what's the color outside of that\ngreen\nand then black and then\nred and then\nblue now go back in\num red\nblack\ngreen\nyellow red and now let yourself just\nrest on the red\njust focus fully drive your attention\ntowards it\nfocus on it do your best not to blink\nwe're gonna try to go for 10 more\nseconds\nand now close your eyes\nand what i want you to do is notice the\nafter image\ndo you see the after image yes\njust look at it\njust let yourself see what's there\nlet your breathing relax\nand we'll just meditate silently and you\ncan just focus on the image for about\nanother minute\nyes\nyou may start to notice it kind of\nfading away no problem\nlet it go\nsee if you can find it\nif you can't focus on your breathing\nit's not so much about finding or\nholding as it is waiting for it to\nappear foreign\nand now we're going to take three deep\nbreaths\nbreathe in for three seconds\nand out for three seconds\nin for three and out for five\nand in for three and out for seven\nnice slow exhalation\nas you finish your breath put your palms\ntogether in front of you\nrub them together\nand then cup your hands your palms over\nyour eyes\nand while your palms are over your eyes\ngo ahead and open\nand then let your hands come down\nhow are you feeling\nyeah that was hard\nthat was hard um i wasn't sure what to\nexpect from that\nthe picture so i thought\nin the beginning i thought that i didn't\nlike it the colors all start to\nturn to gray so i was like oh oh like i\nthought well in my mind i\nhave it's like my eyes i was wondering\nif there's something wrong with my eyes\nso i was like trying to blink to clear\nit but\nit would work but i realized after i\nrealized that\ni'm sort of supposed to struggle there\num\nthen i was able to let that go\nand focus more um after closing my eyes\nthe the image was very vivid and i could\npoint out every color backwards\num or like they weren't the same colors\nbut i could point out the negatives i\nsuppose and then um\nlike clear as day and then as i\nstruggled to see it more it would fade\nand when i'd relax it would show up\nagain\nand so it was kind of like the more i\nwanted it the less i could have it\nand then if i just yeah\nperfect so this is a technique\nto train you to learn how to find what\nyou're looking for\nby not looking right\nso do this technique\nand like yeah that's what we're looking\nfor\nright because you'll begin like\nliterally your brain will learn\nhow to like let go and like let things\ncome\nright and the last thing i'll leave you\nwith foosley\nyou are where you are because of your\nhard work\nbut you're really where you are because\nyou let\nthings come\nright like i don't know if you went out\nand hunted for edison\nyou know but not at all\nyou let him come oh god\ni wasn't thinking like i wasn't thinking\nlike that no i didn't know it's like\nit's like that you like you know\nyou can't like as i was doing the yoga\ntalk i was doing the yoga talk you can't\nblame me for it\nit's the natural thing to say yes it is\nit is no and i was thinking about it\nthat way that i was\nthinking about it in the other way and\nthen and then i would guess\nyeah no but really right like i mean\nlike you\nlike you allow things to\ni can't i can't yes you know what i mean\nyes yes it is\ni went i didn't go looking for him at\nall right stumble that's a good word\nyes right like so you just let him\nstumble into your life\nand like that's you like like life is\nlike just let it stumble into you you\nknow\nyou don't need to go looking for it so\nhard\nfantastic so do this practice i'd say\nyou know start with 60 seconds you can\nwork your way up to like three minutes\nfive minutes\nif you want an alternative you can also\nlook at a candle flame\nand and if you look at a candle flame\nlike what you can do is like\nyou know you can just see the colors in\nthe room and then work your way in\nand so oddly enough really foosley it's\nnot about\ngetting it right like that's the other\nthing that you can learn to let go of\njust like you did like\nknow what you know it's not great\nthere's no grades\nwhat you're really practicing is just\nthe struggle of attention and then\nletting go\nright so it's not actually about the\ncolors\nis are you gonna send the photo yeah\ni'll i'll send you\nit's it's called the sri anthro but yes\ni will send you a photo\ni will send you a photo so other thing\nis i would recommend that you print it\nout\nor you can like order them on amazon or\nsomething so ideally you're not looking\nat a screen because that does all kinds\nof other things to your brain but i'll\ni will send you the photo okay okay okay\nyes\nthank you very much thank you that was\noh that was amazing\ni'm like i'm like thinking so much about\nthings and\nand uh and i didn't even i like the\ndirection it took\num because yeah because those are things\nthat i think on a\nevery single day basis i struggle with\nlike just fine like just trying to\nsqueeze the juice\nout of out of life at every moment and\ni'm always like how can i be the most\nefficient do this do this do this and\nchasing that and like and all that so\nthat was great\nso fantastic thank you for your time\nthank you for\nyeah it was great to meet you and and\nyeah\nthank you thanks bye bye\nokay chat then who are we rating\ndragon deez nuts bend over these nuts"
