    "transcript": "today's talk is really about masculinity\nbut more importantly it's also like\ndigging into\nhow we form our views of masculinity\nand where our opinions come from and a\nlot of the opinions that we have and\nfeelings we have around gender roles\nare actually deeply rooted in personal\nexperiences that have shaped the way\nthat we think\nand so i want people to understand that\nlike if you really want to\nstart to feel more comfortable with\ngender related\nissues whether they be societal or the\nones that you sit with\nexploring your own personal story is a\nwonderful way to kind of get a handle on\nhow you see the world\nyeah so how you been man i've been\npretty good\ni um i've\ni've been actually pretty good i uh for\nthe most part have just been\nfocused on working this pandemic\nobviously being isolated has its own\nset of issues but overall mental health\nand physical health have been pretty\ngreat so\ncan't complain and remind me last time\nwe talked a little bit about\num was it your dad and and grief and\nstuff\nyeah yeah so we talked about uh loved\nones dying how to process and handle\nthat\nand uh how best to to manage the\num loss of somebody close to you\nand was that did that help at all or\ni mean you know i sort of feel like i'm\nfishing for a yes there but i'm just\ngenuinely curious like\nyeah yeah well i mean i think any\nopportunity to discuss something that\nyou normally don't discuss is always a\ngood thing\nuh it's always strange to discuss\nsomething that's very like\nintimate difficult on a very public\nplatform\nbecause everyone wants to chime in with\ntheir opinions which is a bit of a\nstrange thing for something you feel so\npersonal uh but beyond that in terms of\nlike how i feel on the inside\nmuch better yeah when you say everyone\nwants to chime in with their feelings\nwho are you talking about\nuh you know i i honestly like i i feel\nthis way every time i i\ngenerally dislike being uh in a\nvulnerable state on the internet it uh\nsure understands it's not it's not uh\nit's not generally my thing\num so as a result i think when people\ngive me their feedback or they stop me\nit's kind of weird to have a stranger\nbeing like man that moment about you and\nyour dad really touched me i'm just like\nbut i don't know you you know it's kind\nof a weird feeling to\nhave somebody because it feels like\nsomeone saw me naked and i don't know\nwho they are\nyou know\nyou know but you're the one doing the\ntouching apparently yes\nyes yes but it's just it feels very\nvoyeuristic in a way not\nit's consensual but it's still strange\nbecause yeah i feel\nit's that parasocial relationship that\npeople talk about a lot\nwhere people feel like they know you and\nthey come up to you and they say all\nthese like\nthings about themselves i have no idea\nwho you are but you know this intimate\npart of my life so\nthat's a strange part about it yeah but\ni'm also kind of hearing that\napparently people benefited from your\nnakedness\nuh yes i would i would i would agree\nagree with that notion i think that's\nweird man yeah\ndefinitely definitely so yeah so that\nwas that was everyone's experience and i\nthink it was great to\nhear that um folks had a a very positive\num experience listening to that so i'm\nhappy about that portion of it for sure\nyeah and and just you know it's\ninteresting um and\nwhat do you go by again uh i go by abba\nnormally that's yeah that's the thing\nso abby you know just hearing you\nnow i'm sort of remembering how um\nprotective you are of other people it's\nkind of interesting like\nyou know you you kind of you're it's\nsubtle but like the way that you're kind\nof saying you know i appreciate that\nother people are getting helped but i'm\nalso kind of acknowledging that\nunderneath that is sort of the\ni was still naked and it feels really\nawkward for me\nyes yeah yeah that that feeling i don't\nthink any ever really goes away from me\nuh because i'm still a fairly private\nperson even though i do\nonline stuff you know normally like\npictures of my family or things like\nthat that's going on my life i don't\nreally share with the whole world so to\nshare that sure\ni think it was something that was good\nfor folks but i think for me it's always\ntrying to find that good line between\nhow much sharing is too much can you\nhold on just one second i'm getting a\ncall from my\nproducer no worries go ahead thank you\nvery much\ni appreciate it i might be peeking or\nsomething like that i i only got uh\nfilters on my stream so\nso so abba let me ask you guys this may\nsound like a kind of a weird question\nbecause i get that we're you know having\nthis conversation now but\num how do you feel about coming back and\nmaybe talking about something else and\nand kind of being once again vulnerable\nin front of\nyou know um i think i do things that\nmatter to me and so i think for me it's\nfun to do them provided there's a\npurpose to them i i wouldn't do this\ngratuitously\nso i think as long as there's a there's\na end goal in mind and there's something\nyou know i think the conversation is\nbeneficial i think it's something that\npeople could gain from then i'm fine\nwith having it on this kind of platform\nokay okay so i'm really hearing that\nthere's sort of a greater good to be\nserved here\nyeah yeah yeah yeah definitely i think\nthere's a lot of people who identify\nwith some of the issues that i've\nmentioned\nin the email so you know it's something\ni've discussed on my platform before so\ni think having your take on it and a bit\nof a back and forth would benefit a lot\nof people\nso you're doing this for other people uh\npartially i think it's also good for me\nuh\nit's interesting i feel like with this\nissue specifically i mean the one\nregarding to\nto to some of men's issues i think\ni think i'm i'm okay with things in a\nsense that i don't need a sense of\ncatharsis like i think i've gotten mine\nper se\num but i see you know\nit's weird because a lot of men you know\nhit me up and they're like you're my\nmentor and i'm like\ni didn't sign up for all that but i\nthink\nit's because i identify with some of the\nstuff that we talk about and it it's\nlike it's on the first time for a lot of\nthem that they've heard it\nso i recognize some folks do do need it\nyeah\num yeah you're so precise with your\nlanguage and your thought you know it's\nit's\nit's interesting it you know yeah well\nuh thank you i appreciate that i mean\njust kind of like\nwhen you say yeah i mean it i appreciate\nit a lot\num and i'm also noticing abba maybe this\nisn't really what\nwe kind of signed up for today and so we\ndon't have to talk about it but\ni'm hearing also like a theme of like\npeople\num you know like here you are mentoring\npeople that you've never heard of and\nand you know opening people's eyes to\nthings and you know\nhaving them feel like touched and\nthey're growing and then you're you're\nkind of like bewildered\nand and i'm just a little bit curious\nabout um\nyou know what kind of expectation or\npressure or like how do you\nyou know how do you deal with that um\nand i know it's kind of separate from\nmaybe what we're going to be talking\nabout today but it's just it's so\ninteresting because i'm hearing that\ntheme kind of pop\nup over and over like what are you to\npeople and and how do you\nsit with what you are for other people\nyeah well you know\ni definitely get a sense of imposter\nsyndrome mostly because i don't think\ni've\nreally had proper mentors most of my\nlife and so the idea of being a mentor\nto somebody else is definitely\na little intimidating at times um and\nand it doesn't feel consensual in some\nways this sets that up\ni didn't choose this i didn't accept\nanything but you you have these\nexpectations\nand i think i'm managing it by by\nreminding myself that i matter\nand that my well-being matters so if it\never becomes too much to take time and\nto\nembrace that and i think i also manage\nit by\naccepting that i i've i've in a sense\nalready been doing it with the things\nthat i'm doing so i just need to keep\ndoing that\nyou know and i don't have to pile on\nmyself a large amount of extra work\nbecause i think what i've been doing is\nenough for a lot of tricks\nwell said really well said and once\nagain well thought out\nnuanced you know that you're okay doing\nthis\nand then there are certain boundaries\nthat you're going to maintain and\nrespect\nand that you know cool so what did you\nwant to talk about in terms of men's\nissues today\num i sent a video that i kind of\nsummarized that had you had an\nopportunity to watch it by any chance no\nso i actually purposely go into this\nstuff blind\nblind okay yeah the other reason is\nbecause um sometimes i hate the idea of\nfeeling redundant\nwith some of the stuff but i guess it is\ngood to explain it for folks who haven't\nseen it\num well if it's short we could also just\nwatch it together if you want\nno no it's about 10 minutes so probably\nbest for me to just explain it but um\nbut my pet peeve with with these kinds\nof discussions is also feels like when\nthey're had\nuh if you talk about it too often people\nwill start to be like oh here he goes\nagain on this topic and uh\nyou know i never want to seem whiny\nbecause in my day-to-day life i don't\nthink this is something i necessarily\ntalk about that often but when i'm on\nthe internet it seems to come up a lot\num yeah so\nare you familiar with the with the red\npill community uh yeah at least in terms\nof the dating sense yeah\num and so some people would like sent me\nlinks and they they asked for my\ncritique of it and how toxic some of it\nmay be what not\nand um essentially the the rebuttal i\nhad\nwas that i think for a long time men\nhaven't had spaces on any kind of\nplatforms or media\nto see their issues and their problems\nreflected in any kind of form\nand they also oftentimes haven't had\ntoo many opportunities for guidance on\nhow to approach women\non how to date effectively on you know\nespecially\nwhen you're expected to make the first\nstep and to kind of put yourself out\nthere and a lot of the times like\nit's not that much guidance for uh young\nmen\nand i know it's an issue that i dealt\nwith for a long time and so i say that\nuh\nessentially even though um i think the\ncommunity has\nissues and some of the rhetoric isn't\nalways good i think there is no\nalternative for a lot of men or they\nfeel like there isn't one\nand therefore until something is\npresented i think the idea of\ntaking down the one space where men see\nthese topics reflected\nuh wouldn't be a good idea that's the\ngist of it\ncan you just um help me understand or\njust help with people\nwho don't understand what red pill is\ncan you just explain\nexplain it yes yeah yeah yeah so it's\nborn from the\nmatrix and the idea of the red pill\nversus the blue pills like\nneo the main character gets a choice\nbetween choosing to see the world for\nwhat it is the truth with the red pill\nor blue pill which is to stay in this\nkind of virtual reality fiction type\nworld\nand so the term uh had a political\nmeaning for some time\njust for people who want to see the\ntruth in life in general but over the\nlast like i would say seven or\neight years um in a dating sense\na lot of men go there for pickup artist\nstuff\nyou know seeing the world for what it is\nin the sense uh\nlike how women are doing really well and\nmen are failing\nso that's some of the ideas that would\nbe common in the red pill dating yeah\nyeah so i i'm really um i'm really\nexcited for this conversation because\nthis is actually one of my favorite\nthings to think about\nand my favorite things to talk about\nokay why is that\ni you know it's it's it's interesting\ni'm not quite sure but\nabout two years ago i sent an email to\nlike a group of like close friends of\nmine\njust trying to figure out like what's\nlike i felt like something is happening\nwith men\nand it for me it started actually in a\nreally bizarre way\ni was doing um i was working in a prison\nand i was uh you know doing therapy with\nsomething like an\ninmate and i was talking to him and he\nwas in\nin prison for dealing drugs um\nand so as we kind of like started\ntalking and i started getting to know\nhim\nso it turned out that he had three older\nsisters and\nhis older sisters kind of said to him\nthat you know like it's your job as like\nthe man of the family\nto like provide and so here he is at\nlike\n16 and he's expected to provide for\nyou know three older sisters or they're\nthey're sort of\ntelling him that and so he's not really\nkind of sure\nlike how to go about doing that feels\nkind of overwhelmed but there is like\none opportunity within his community so\nhe's like\nlow a socioeconomic status um also like\nan\nethnic minority and and so started\nyou know dealing and then kind of got\ncaught you know had a couple of\ninfractions i was meeting him when he\nwas like 24 or 23\nyeah and so we kind of talked about it\nand then he sort of like felt this\nbig big burden like his biggest issue\nlike when he was talking about being\ndepressed is like\ni have to provide and it's like my\nresponsibility to provide\nand the really bizarre thing is that a\nfew months later i was\nworking with um you know like a\nmiddle-aged investment banker\nand like the same words were coming out\nof his mouth\nyeah and it just struck me as like\nbizarre that\nthese two people from so different\nbackgrounds actually oddly enough the\ninvestment banker's background was\nactually not very different from these\nkids which is interesting\num so also grew up like poor and\nand things like that and and just so\ninteresting that\nthat like these two people from such\ndifferent walks of like\nlife like different ethnicities um you\nknow somewhat different backgrounds very\ndifferent you know day-to-day\nexperiences of life\nwe're essentially like suffering from a\ncommon problem and that just struck me\nas very strange\nand and it caused me to really like stop\nand think a little bit about like\nyou know how um\nwith all the discussions of privilege\nand stuff like that that you could\nkind of say like how can you even\ncompare those but just\nyou can certainly say that these people\naren't similar at all\nbut just as a therapist you know part of\nwhat i try to do is like see the person\nbehind all of the labels and\nskip color of their skin and things like\nthat and what really shocked me was that\nyou know if i closed my eye if i made a\ntranscript of each session\nand i went back and read them i would\nnot know which person i was talking to\njust based on the transcript of their\nwords yeah\nand so something about that i realized\nlike something is going on here like i\ndon't know what but there's like a\nbizarre like it's so\nand and i realize that the further apart\nthat these people\nappear to be the bigger the issue is\nbecause it's gotta it's gotta\nyou know bridge the gap of these vastly\ndifferent\nexperiences um and so i started to just\nkind of\ntalk to people and sort of explore and\nthings like that and\nand it's been just really fascinating to\nsort of try to figure out\nyou know for essentially a privileged\nclass like why do men suffer so much why\nwhy is the suicide rate you know why do\nfour out of three or four\nthree out of four or four out of five\npeople who kill themselves or men\num and so you know what like i feel like\nwe're missing something here and that\nthere's something going on that there's\nactually a lot of like\nevidence for but that people don't talk\nabout\nyeah well i think i think it's an\noversimplification of the issue in the\nsense that\nwe love to look at things as hierarchies\nthat are very clear-cut in the sense\nlike we got a pyramid\nwe got we got men at the top and then we\ngot women right below and then we got\npeople who are minorities and then we\ngot people are disabled right\nbut the truth is uh i think when people\ninternalize these issues and people\nwon't live these issues they don't\nnecessarily live\non a macro scale things happen on a\nmicro skills and so\nyou know even when i try to have these\ndiscussions for example and you say the\nproblem seems very vast and complex\ni think it's a lot more simple in the\nsense that\nas a whole men deal with certain issues\nbut because they're perceived as the\nprivileged class a lot of that is\nunderserved and it's rarely\ndiscussed in a sense so you know when i\ntalk about this stuff and people are\nlike well women suffer more i'm like i\ndon't disagree that women may have more\nproblems inciting that means\nbut when i'm dealing with problems and\nthey're very real whether it be\ndepression or my friends killing\nthemselves or things like that\ni internalize things on a micro scale i\ninternalize things on an individual\nbasis i can't think of like men as a\nwhole\ni'm thinking about man people around me\nare dying my male friends are dying\nthat's what i see\nand so you can understand concepts on a\nmacro level but i think\nseeing the folks as individuals is\nimportant this because it makes you\nrealize that\neven though a perceived class can can\nhave these advantages and they're quite\nreal\non an individual scale the suffering can\nbe just as\nheavy if that makes sense you know\nand i think that's important and to me\nwhat you said about like the investment\nbanker\nand the dues on the drugs like it's not\nsurprising you know as my income level\nhas changed and as i've spent time\nfrom the military to civilian life and\nstuff i'm like it's the same problems\nit's really not that drastically\ndifferent i see a lot of the same\npatterns\nin regards to that idea of male\nresponsibility um\nand feeling the need to provide even\nthough i'm a middle child and i got\nolder sisters\nyou know i have that exact same\nresponsibility but i'm supposed to take\ncare of my mom\ni'm supposed to take care of my siblings\nyou know and they haven't\ndidn't even have to explicitly say i\njust feel like that is my response that\nis my burden to bear\num and so i think a lot of this stuff is\njust understood\non the side of the level for all men\nirrespective of income level\nyeah so what what do you think is the\nproblem abba\nhelp me understand your understanding of\nthe situation\nand i think i think men are expected to\ndo these things we're just often\nill-equipped\nand not given any guidance on how to do\nthem do what whether\nuh from everything from making the first\nmove and being a leader like\nyou know the whole idea of leading even\nwithin a small\nlike just within a relationship like\nthat expectation\nis definitely imposed on us through\ndating standards through\nmedia imagery um and then even if you\ntake it from\na work standpoint you know meeting a\ncertain level of income the idea of what\nsuccess for a man looks like\nis to defeat others in a way uh and to\nbe better\nand when you consider all these\nexpectations it's like okay i'm 18 i\njust finished high school\ni don't know how to approach we're going\nto be good at it i don't know\nhow to make money i get anxiety about\nthe idea of like how am i going to take\ncare of the people around me i got to\ntake care of a wife and a girlfriend\nand kids um and so those are the\ngirlfriend wow i know imagine both at\nthe same time depending on culture right\num yeah so those expectations are\nare quite the cross to bear when there's\nno resources on how to do it that's what\ni think\nokay so what what are the expectations\nthat you\nfeel so i'm also hearing kind of a\nthreat you talked about\nred pill and you know red pill is a i\nstill remember when i was back in\ncollege like a couple of my friends got\ninto the pickup artist scene\nyeah and and so it's it's been\ninteresting to see the\nevolution of like pickup artists\ninto red pill into i think in cell\nlike i think that there's a lot of\ncommon sort of threats there\nand uh so so what are the expectations\nthat you\nfeel like you've been placed upon your\nshoulders without\ninsufficient i mean without sufficient\nguidance\num the the two things that come to mind\nright away\nare one two to to lead to\nuh kind of be the trailblazer to be the\none who\nis going to take charge of a situation\nyou know uh that's one and the second\nthing would be\njust in a romantic sense um\njust the idea of knowing how to court\nsomebody\nyou know because i think a lot of us are\noften starved for affection or do want\nthat kind of like reciprocity in terms\nof love and things like that\nbut speaking to most men i know they\ndon't know how to do it\nthey don't know how to start that\ninitiative and they get so much anxiety\nand nervousness about it it's like\nlike what do you know and they know\nnothing and i'm like i'm not surprised\nbecause i knew nothing at 18 or 19 or\n20.\nand yeah so those would be like two\nprime examples i can think of on top of\nmy head\nand so can you tell us a little bit\nabout um\nuh can you tell us just a little bit\nabout\nyour kind of sense of what not knowing\nhow to court someone at 18 sort of felt\nlike\nand kind of where you are now and what\nthat journey has been like\noh man oh man so you talk about the pick\nup fire stuff i i picked up on that\nyou know i the one thing i had in the\nsense was like thankfully for me and my\ncase like a rejection didn't\nlike murder my self-esteem uh but uh\nback in the day before like a lot of the\ntinder stuff really got really popular\nuh we just had to go up to\nto women and try to be like hi i think\nyou're gorgeous right or whatever\nand um i remember what my first couple\nrejections felt like just just\njust being like oh man oh\ni just brutal brutal brutal brutal stuff\ni remember one time i um\ni asked this girl at my gym and she\naccepted she's like yeah you know i get\noff on friday\nat five so you can just come meet me\nthere and i was like cool and uh\nand friday came along and i text her in\nthe morning but she didn't respond but\ni'm like it's okay we already agreed on\nthe spot so i'll just go there\nand i came around when her shift ended\nwhich is like 5 p.m\nand waited outside and uh texted up like\nhey i'm outside she still didn't respond\ni just remember her walking out with\nanother dude and get in the car and\nleaving\nanywhere he got in the cabin i remember\njumping into the bushes to hide\njust brutal stuff man um just the idea\nof being in a club you know and going up\nto a girl and\nand be like hey and just very very\nmildly\nand you know they they they snap\nand and to be clear i just want to say\nthis i i don't get mad at\num some people who take\nwill reject very aggressively because i\nunderstand sometimes during the night\nyou might get approached 100 times and\nit can be very\ntaxing to have to say no to people who\nconstantly want something from me but\nas a dude to try to approach very kindly\njust to hear that just be like no and\nit's like\nyelled in a way that everyone else can\nhear it's just you just slunk and i've\nseen it happen so many people around me\nso\num yeah yeah even if i look back on it i\njust\nsometimes i still cringe yeah i'm\ncurious what did it\nwhat did it feel like when you know you\nsaw her walk out of the gym with another\ndude\nuh shame embarrassment uh\ninadequacy those are like a couple of\nwords that come to mind\nyeah yeah yeah yeah did you ask yourself\ndid you actually hide\noh yeah yeah i hit because uh the way it\nworks is they got a loop around in the\ncab to come by\nand i was standing right beside the\nbushes and so i was far enough to see\nthem\nand i'm oh man yeah i don't want it\nbrutal i jumped in those bushes\nyeah because i felt so embarrassed you\nknow what i mean i was like here i am\nfor a date she's leaving some other dude\nyou know\nso i uh so yeah i remember being 19 of\nthat happening\ni'll never forget that there's always\none of those stories i'm like\nyeah i i have a fair number of cringe\nstories myself\num and and so then what you know so\nhow did you being such a thoughtful guy\nhow did you like think about you know\nwhat\nhow did you approach that so like you\nclearly saw like there's a problem here\nright\nlike and and what did you understand was\nthe problem at 19.\ni just felt like i had no idea what i\nwas doing\nlike i i didn't i felt like i had no\ngame plan i didn't feel\nit sounds like yeah yeah yeah that's\nreally what it was i had no game\none thing i had going in my favor was\nlike even if i took a huge\nl like that i i would be fine with going\nback the next day and trying again with\nsomebody different you know sure\num so i think that's what but i know\ndudes who get that once and it was over\nand\nmy problem was i just didn't have any\nskill set to understand\nbecause i feel like now where i'm at i\ncan understand way more variables\nthan what i could then i couldn't read\nthe social cues i didn't understand\nwhat it looked like when someone was\ninterested or what they weren't little\nsigns that i could pick up on to\nbetter handle the situation uh and\nat 19 i just didn't have that skill set\nso i would go in blind and i would leave\nblind and just with a bunch of things i\nsaw and i can't make sense of so\nthat was my issue at the time and how\ndid you think about approaching it like\nyou know what did you think about what\nwere you going to do about it like\nyou're like okay i'm blind\nyeah i'm going to look for for guidance\ni'm going to look for for for\ninstructions you know\ni come from a gamer background when you\ncan't figure something out you look for\na walk-through\nyou know yeah absolutely so it was the\nsame idea i just\ni needed some advice and you know i'm\nsure folks google this on all ends how\ndo i make someone like me or how do i do\nthis right we all looking for answers to\nfind acceptance for somebody and that's\nwhat i did\nand did you feel like uh you kind of\nalluded to the fact that maybe you\ndidn't have\nsort of personal guidance or kind of\nmentorship sort of growing up\nso did you feel like you there wasn't\nanyone you could kind of talk to in your\npersonal life that could maybe guide you\nlike yeah i think it's twofold i think i\ndidn't have that and secondly i think i\nwould have felt shame to ask someone\ndirectly that i'm like i feel inadequate\napproaching women you know yeah i think\nit's those two things\nbecause it's kind of it sounds pathetic\nlike man i don't know how to approach\nghosts to somebody\nyou know yeah it doesn't sound great\nyeah so i think a lot of people look for\nthose resources but don't want to admit\nthat they're looking for them\nso so i think that too uh if you know\njust what i'm hearing there is there's\nactually like a really subtle\nexpectation there yeah that it is oddly\nenough\neveryone's ignorant and it's completely\nunacceptable to be ignorant\neven amongst men that would be shameful\nto another dude it would be like so\npathetic if you're like\nhey man how do you pick up chicks like i\ndon't know how to pick up chicks\nyeah yeah and then they'd look at you\nand they'd be like you're a loser\nyeah and even worse than that i've\nwatched\nguys go up to folks in clubs right and\nand just go very kindly it's like hey\ncan i get you a drinking\ngirl says no and i understand that but\nsometimes i would hear the girls\nafterwards like\ni was such a [ __ ] creep and and and\nthe guy would be with an earshot to hear\nit but i was just\nlike oh he just doesn't know what he's\ndoing and\nand i and i think oftentimes women don't\nknow\nhow much we don't know what we're doing\nand sometimes a lack of skills is seen\nas\npredatory or somehow like very gross and\ndisgusting when it's just like man\ni feel bad for the hobie like he's he's\n21 this is his first time inside a club\nhe doesn't know\nso yeah yeah i feel bad i feel oh yeah i\nfeel bad\nyeah i can see it i can see there's\nsomething you know you're really\nresonating with something there\nbecause that was me so i know what he's\nthinking you know i know what he's\nfeeling right now that when you\nwhen you get rejected the the the the\ndejection that you feel afterwards\nand i'm not talking about when someone\nsays no to you on tinder because you\nknow\neven that's manageable you're in the\nprivacy of your own home i think that's\nwhy a lot of people actually don't\nyou know go up to folks in person as\nmuch anymore is because they have\nthey can better preserve themselves by\ndoing things online but\nwhen i used to watch it all the time it\nwas very difficult to watch at times\nyeah i think tinder has its own set of\nyou know toxicity but\nwhat i'm really hearing from you is that\nthere's sort of this expectation of\ncompetence from both your male peers\nand from the women that you approach\nthat like you should know how to do this\nbetter\nlike yeah even looking at the idea like\nmen have to be the leaders of the\nhousehold and that's like a common thing\nthat people\nstill hold on to despite the fact that\nwomen are extremely successful in terms\nof like\ni think they're outpacing men for\ndegrees now and and out earning men\ncoming straight out of university and\ncollege so\nthere's still that idea that men still\ngot to do all this stuff even though\nthey seem to be failing perpetually and\ngradually getting worse in some regards\nand so even just that expectation is\ndaunting for a lot of men\nyeah you know this is kind of i don't\nwant to charge\nthe discussion but one thing that i've\nnoticed is really interesting is that\nyou know sometimes being a psychiatrist\ni get the opportunity to ask\nmen and women sort of personal questions\nabout their\nyou know who they would date and things\nlike that it's a common\nconcern and i'm really surprised by um\nthe\nyou know the high high percentage of\nwomen that\nuh really feel like if a man is not\nfinancially successful\nthat they're not an acceptable like\npartner\num and and the interesting thing is that\nwhen i talk you know so\ni feel like oftentimes i hear keep in\nmind this isn't data or anything that's\njust anecdotal\ncould have a lot to do with the\nselection bias and the you know the\npeople who wind up in my office\num but that it's kind of completely\nacceptable to\na lot of my male patients that they have\na partner that doesn't\nearn money and that a homemaker is like\na laudable position but\nwomen that that i have as patients don't\nreally feel the same way they're\nactually very few\num but some of them you know are okay\nwith that yeah\nyeah so that's good that's been my\nexperience and and um\ni don't think it's necessarily wrong or\nevil i i'm this is not a critique of a\nwoman or anything like that\nto me it just speaks to the expectation\nthat's placed on men to\nlive up to a certain role um and\nand and yeah if you look at the\nhierarchy of needs uh like within data\nbut if you don't want to go there we\ndon't have to it's like yeah there is\nthat expectation on much of a societal\nlevel even in like a\nas progressive as countries as you can\nimagine there's still a lot of those uh\nsame roles uh being existing\nyou know the interesting thing just to\ntoss this out speaking of anecdotal\nexperiences when i talk to\nwomen about who they're accepted\nwho they're willing to date the\ninteresting thing is that half of their\nhesitation doesn't come from a personal\nstandard and actually now that i think\nabout it\ncomes from a societal standard yeah so\nit's it's more about like\nyou know what are my parents gonna think\nkind of thing\nyeah um and\nanyway yeah it's interesting yeah\num so and then what what did you\ndo about it so it sounds like you\ngoogled how do i get someone to like you\nand what else did you do about\nyou know learning how to do this thing i\nhad nobody i felt like i could talk to\nabout this kind of stuff\nbecause of the shame so i think i went\non to online forums and internet\nbecause one it gave me anonymity and two\nit reflected my lived experience\nso with those two things i was like okay\ni'm not alone in this which is already a\ngreat feeling\nother people feel super inadequate like\nme and we could talk it out and kind of\nshare ideas\nand then the third thing is then\nafterwards i was led to some resources\num i don't know if you've ever heard of\nthe show there's a show that used to be\ncalled keys to the vip\nlasted i think three seasons it was a\nshow where you know\ntwo guys would be sent to a nightclub\nand they would you know be asked to\nyou know try to pick up women and try to\ndo so in creative ways\nand i would watch every episode just so\ni'm like oh okay i'm i'm\ni'm learning you know uh and it got\ncancelled uh obviously because some\npeople felt the show was unacceptable in\nthat regards even though these guys\nweren't being pigs or anything weird\num what kind of stuff were they doing\nah they go up and then sometimes they\nwould pretend that they were deaf and\nthey did\nlike can i get they'd have to write on a\ncute car to see if they could talk to\nthe person they would basically handicap\nthemselves\nthey would handicap themselves to see\nlike see how i can do it how easy it is\nso um it would be stuff like that and a\nlot of times i would just be out there\nlaughing\num and so yeah it was just that would be\nthe kind of stuff that they were doing\nand um i think i think the idea of\npicking up women is just revolting to\npeople you know\nlike learning skills we're expected to\nbe confident\nbut learning skills to do it is seen as\ngross or trying too hard\nthat's like the the weird dichotomy i\nsee\nyeah so i think some of that has to do\nwith what the implication of picking up\nwomen is\nyou know i think that there's there's\nsort of an implication in the pickup\nartist community in the red pill\ncommunity that\nmost relationships should be like\nrelatively temporary and and\nbe especially in the red pill community\nit seems like there's sort of a\nit's a zero-sum game so the more you get\nout of the relationship the more she\nloses\num and vice versa right like in the red\npill community there's a winner and a\nloser and either you're the loser in the\nrelationship or you're the winner in the\nrelationship\num but but i i think that you know\npicking up women sort of has a certain\nconnotation to it which i think evokes\ni i i mean when you say picking up women\ni don't\nhear i don't assume that that means\nyou're looking for a girlfriend\nwhat do you think i think if you use\nthat term\nno yeah you know to me to me just\nstrikes me as like\nbad branding in this sense because if\nyou think about all those dudes who did\nmost of that pick up our stuff they're\nall married with kids or they've all had\nto settle down\num and well a lot of the ones that i\nused to follow often times too and even\npeople i follow within the red pill\ncommunity advocate for the ideas of\nrelationships and stuff like that\nthough i can't understand that\nconnotation and there's definitely been\nyou know bad examples\nand in bad representation that regards i\nwould argue\nthat the idea of being in a relationship\nand being married is definitely\nwanted by most men even within those\ncommunities it's just uh\ni don't think it's necessarily put to\nthe forefront or prioritized or\nit's not nearly as appealing in terms of\nthe brochure for why you would apply do\nyou know what i mean\nyeah absolutely i think the brochure\ni mean there's i have a lot of thoughts\num we're actually hopefully coming out\nwith a research paper on some of the\nstuff\nin the next couple months um but\ni so let's just i'm just a little bit\ncurious about your personal journey so\nlike what happened next\nyeah um you know i think as i\nstarted being more bold and started\njust trying different things i would\nonce again still fail a tremendous\namount but\ni started to feel like i was\nthe affection or interest i would show\ntowards women would be reciprocated more\noften so i was like oh this stuff is\nworking\nuh and you know i think as you\nget more involved with that stuff um\nthen you start to to fall on some pit\ntraps uh i\ni would say that i got to a point where\nit's like it's like when you're when you\nwant something for so long and you're\nstarved for it and then you get it you\ndon't know how to\nhold the floodgate so i think i just\nstarted dating way too often i was doing\ntoo much and i was too\nengrossed in the idea of of wanting to\nbe liked\num so i think that became something that\ni was really involved i was dating all\nthe time i was\ngoing out i was on tinder so um\nyeah i was like oh i can do this now i\ncan do what a lot of dudes can't do so\ni'm not going to stop and\nuh yeah so i'm going to kind of ask you\ni have a\nthis is a sort of a hypothesis-driven\nquestion but\nso when you say it it was working or it\nworked what do you think\nwas working what do you think was\nresponsible for your\nchange in fortune like it sounds like\nyou were able to date a lot\nyou know was it the pickup artist kind\nof like was it watching this tv show or\nlike\nhow did you learn to get better\num repetition i'm going to be honest\nit was repetition and\num coming more into myself and being\nable to share more of myself with folks\nuh that was it because i feel like when\nyou have all this anxiety\nand you're constantly nervous and you're\ngetting in your own way they don't get\nto see you they just see\nconfusion and i and i think i just felt\nmuch more calm\nin circumstances uh when i had\nconversations it wasn't necessarily\nsomebody i was trying to\ndate or be sleep with it was i'm just\ntalking to a person and i think as i\ngot to that sense of comfort then it was\nfine yeah\nso i i that was sort of what i was\nimagining yeah that's been sort of\nyou know in a sense my experience\nalthough it's very limited\nand really like observing other people's\nexperiences\nright um is that there isn't sort of a\nmagic trick it really is\nabout kind of being your best self\num and you know the more that you can\njust be your best self like people will\nbe\nyou know that's going to be attractive\nto hopefully some people\nusually some people yeah but it's\ngetting there\nit's getting there that's the problem\nit's getting there it's a problem and\nwhen you feel an adequate\nyou know it's like you first it's like\nthis even with artistic\napproaches to to like singing or dancing\nyou you start off by imitating others\nand then as you do so through that\nprocess you start to find your own voice\nand i felt like dating is like that too\nlike you know or like approaching and me\nyou know breaking that ice that tension\nthat awkwardness\nit's very difficult at first if you have\nnothing to lean on that's what i found\nyeah and and so then what happened it\nsounded like you were dating quite\nsuccessfully\nyeah you'd become you you'd become the\nchad of your dreams\nyeah yeah we didn't have that\nterminology back then but yeah yeah i\nsuppose so\nand then how did you what was that like\nfor you\nit was just a lot of excess it was just\ntoo much of of\nof something that's not the best way i\ncould describe it what do you mean by\nthat can you help us understand a little\nbit\nuh yeah it's just too much time too much\nenergy\num it's like i got lost in the sauce you\nknow i\nmy day would be spent and the day would\npass by i'm like what did i do today\nokay\nand i just and a lot of it was\nmeaningless like which\nnot everything has to be meaningful but\ni think i value my time\nand as i discovered other things that i\nwas passionate about interested in i\nstarted to realize my priorities weren't\nin the right place\ni um yeah i was too busy chasing a high\nif you will i think that's yeah\ni felt it was the the mark of a true\nchat is to be like oh i'm dating too\nmuch\nyeah yeah yeah yeah i know i know and i\nhave this conversation all the time\nbecause like people who who haven't been\nthere are like yeah you're just saying\nthat i'm like\nit's hard for me to tell them that the\ngrass is not green on the other side if\nthey haven't been there\nuh because their whole life they've been\ntold this is the ideal thing to go for\nso yeah yeah and and what i'm hearing is\nthat you know you got to the other side\nyou thought the grass was greener and\nyou're like actually this isn't\nyeah yeah same thing happened to all my\nfriends too all my friends had the same\nexperience\nand that experience was dating a lot and\ndating intensively and\nyeah yeah they were starved for\nfor females attention and then\nafterwards once they got it\nand they they started being very\ngratuitous with it they realized like oh\nthis is not that great and i was like i\nknow\nwe had this conversation but sometimes\nyou got to experience it to understand\nit so i try not to be too preachy about\nit\nand then what happened um\nokay so i think i need to go backwards a\nlittle bit as you start to enter the red\npill environment you know one idea is\nlike you see the truth of what it is\nyou're not supposed to go up to a girl\njust like\nhere's some flowers you know like\nthere's a way you can come with some\nconfidence and things like that\nto garner that affection but then that\nalso\ntrickles into more political uh\ndiscussions about\nyou know what are men's struggles and\nwhy you're struggling and\nwhy is the city society is built this\nway and what your burden and\nresponsibility are\nand how women really are so you'd hear\nthat kind of rhetoric a lot and that\nwould be engrossed into some of the\num pickup artist ideas that you would\nhear about often\nso as i would hear that it began to\ni would i would sometimes within my\ndating experiences have things happen\nthat i was like\nwhat was that you know whether it be\nbeing groped or\nuh women being physically uh abused i\ndon't like using the word abusive but\nyou know like getting slapped\nfor a disagreement you know within like\na dating context i was like\nhow do you feel this comfortable hitting\nme in front of other people and when i\nwould bring this up to folks i would be\nalmost often gaslit into thinking like\noh this is not that big of a deal and\ni'm like and i'm someone who\ni really dislike it when people put\ntheir hands on me\nin a non like in a non-intimate sense\nyou know when they do it as a sense of\ncontrol whether or a sense of like\naggression\nit triggers me to to a point i can't\nexplain even if it's like little stuff\nlike\nlike oh i don't have to you know just\nlittle things like that can really set\nme off and\ni couldn't under imagine me grabbing\nsomebody when they didn't want to be\ngrabbed or\nand i would see this stuff and when i\nwould bring it up to people and i would\nsee the nightclubs and stuff like that\ni'm just like\nand the only time i ever saw that issue\nreflected or people talking about\nsome of the comfort that people feel\ntouching others i was when i was in the\nred pill community so\nit started warping my perception of um\nof women to some degree and uh made me\nresentful\num even the idea that i had to be the\none who makes the first move and i had\nto be\nthe one who puts my self-esteem on the\nline when i go up to somebody i'm like\nhey i'm really interested in\nand i get yelled at and i'm supposed to\njust accept that that's my job as a man\nto do that\ni became resentful of like the the\nburden that society placed on me and i\nthink\nthat community kind of fueled it with\nsome of the ideas because i found other\npeople\nwho felt the exact same way uh and so\nyou have this like kind of echo chamber\nand\nas i grew older i decided to kind of\nslink away from that because i started\nto realize it was clouding my judgment\nhow did you make that realization it was\nprogressive you know i i i'd like to\nbelieve\nthat i'm introspective enough to\nacknowledge when i'm holding on to a bad\nidea\nand i was questioned on things i can't\ntell you an exact moment but i remember\nbeing questioned on certain things and\ni would sit with those ideas and i'm\nlike if i look at this logically it\ndoesn't make sense\nand so i just had to re-examine things\nuh you know\ntry to study a little bit and be like am\ni holding on to this because\nit's it's reflective of some of my\nexperiences and and\nyou know am i holding on to this due to\nlike\nanger resentment or am i holding on to\nthis because it's a sound idea and i\nthink just a bit of that reflection kind\nof made me realize you weren't\nthere were great ideas yeah so you know\nit's it's kind of\nstaggering but i want to share like one\nor two experiences that really terrified\nme\nso i one time was talking to a sexual\nassault victim who was\num uh you know\na tall\nyou know well-built man who was\num sexually assaulted by like a five\nfoot three woman\nand uh they were at a party and she um\nbasically climbed on top of him\nand he felt really scared and like he\nfelt like you know he couldn't explain\nto other people that like\nbecause they would look at the physical\ndifference and they would say how on\nearth could you\nnot defend yourself in that situation\nyep\nand then so i i asked him i was like you\nknow when people sit like so i just\nasked him\nwhy didn't you feel like you could\ndefend yourself and he was like if i\ndefended myself my chances of going to\njail were so much higher\nbecause what would it look like if i if\ni like pick her up\nand throw her off like like she was\npersistent like he pushed her away\nshe didn't and she falls awkwardly yep\nand and so like what is like is he\nsupposed to hit her across the face\nlike he can absolutely physically\noverpower her he can knock her\nunconscious\nbut what happens then um\nand and so he felt incredibly powerless\nincredibly\nhe felt stuck like he couldn't do\nanything about it\num and so it was it was just really\ni never until i you know until i heard\nhim say something like that i had never\nthought you know i never thought about\nthat\nyeah yeah there's a there's a layer even\nabove that i\nam there's this one lady who i knew who\nwas a\nteacher at a at a school she basically\ntaught like the\nprogressive ideas of um gender studies\nand uh me and her some conversations in\nthe past and i remember on new year's\neve i think it's like 2018.\ni was uh i was at a club and and she\ncame up to me and she was like oh it's\ngood to see you i'm good to see you as\nwell\nand um she's a little bit intoxicated i\nwas very sober and she kind of\napproached me\ntrying to get close and i was like i'm\ni'm not interested in i remember like\njust before the countdown hit i was\nheading towards the bathroom she was\ncoming out of it she said oh good to see\nyou and i'm like yeah good to see you as\nwell\nand and she just went right away and\ngroped me right and\ni remember being like what are you doing\nand she immediately just lunged at me to\nmake out right\nand and as her lifts my mind i pushed\nher off um\nand i just remember thinking like what\njust happened right now right\nand\nmaybe a week later i just remember\nseeing her on social media just talking\nabout boundaries and how it's important\nfor men to respond i just\ni remember being so angry at that moment\ni remember he's so mad\nand and i think it kind of reflected an\nexperience that i had in my life where i\ni would look at things that would happen\nlike that\nand the the really difficult thing for\nme was accepting that\nsome of the women who would do this\nstuff weren't necessarily bad people\nyou know like whether it be slapping a\nguy or things like that when they get\nreally angry they weren't necessarily\nbad people\nbut i also saw how nobody held them\naccountable when they did some of these\nthings\nbecause of the perceived size difference\nbecause of the idea that\na man being hit really doesn't have any\nimplications or his boundaries being\nviolated doesn't really\nmatter you know and\ni when i had a conversation with one\nperson i was like do you not realize\nthat you\nare doing something wrong when you put\nyour hands on me that way and the person\nhas to sit with it and come to the real\nunderstanding like oh i did something\n[ __ ] up\nbut it dawned on me that this person at\n27 had never been told that before\nand it felt comfortable doing that in\nthe past and it was like\nwe got a bigger problem this is not just\na matter of like individuals it's also a\nmatter of like messaging and\nand and and how we have these\nconversations\nyou know every guy i've ever spoken to\ncould tell me of experiences where\nthey've had\npeople place their hands on them you\nknow from the opposite section um\nand they just they just never talk about\nit like uh it is what it is\ni'm like oh okay yeah yeah\nyeah that was a tough one it was a tough\none to be like i can't hate this person\nbecause they're not evil\nbut that what they do what they're doing\nis terrible\nyeah so what i'm i'm hearing is that you\nknow also like it in a sense i i think\nyou can't really blame someone if you\nnever give them feedback\nand what i'm hearing is that people\naren't really getting feedback\nthat yeah it's it's hard though it's\nhard to give someone feedback who\nviolated your boundaries because then it\nmeans that you as a man have to accept\nthe idea that\nsomeone did something wrong to you which\nis not a conversation you want to have\nlike i don't even like to refer to it as\nabuse\neven though by definition it would\ntechnically be categorized like that's\nnot how i perceived it but\nyou know it is what it is and to have\nthat conversation should mean\ni have to relive that and then i also\nhave to confront them which is\nwhy don't you see it as abuse\nmaybe maybe it's more so because of my\nresponse to it isn't like\nto me just i guess this is how i\ninterpret it but maybe i'm lying to\nmyself i just\nsee it as like blatantly disrespectful\nthat's what i think when i\nwhen i think back to that experience i\nwould never do that to you i would never\nlike\nnot care about your boundaries so much\nthat i would just do that i just\ncouldn't imagine\nbut for you to do that like where do you\nget off feeling that comfortable and i\nthink that's why i don't necessarily\ncategorize abuse because i didn't feel\nnecessarily\nviolated per se so i think that's why i\nwould see them\nand maybe that's wrong but that's just\nmy perception of it\nand so where so it sounds like you kind\nof cooled off on dating you had a couple\nof\nrelatively you know negative experiences\nhere and there like where are you\nnowadays\noh things are really peaceful you know\nlike i i think one thing i value within\nmy day in life now is just um\npeacefulness you know not that there's\nnever conflict but that we can like\nget through this stuff in in a in a\npeaceful way if you will\nand um it's good\nit's good um i\ni don't feel any compulsive needs like i\nused to i mean you know sometimes the\nego flares up and you want to dabble a\nlittle bit but\nfor the most part things are pretty\nquiet and i'm kind of grateful for that\nbecause i get to put my\nenergy towards things that matter a\nlittle bit more and then i don't like\nthat\num you know about this may sound a\nlittle bit weird but you know we're\ntalking about how people don't have\nguidance and i'm curious is there\nsomething that\num you want guidance on now\nlike um\ni think for me in the next chapter of my\nday in life my relationship\ni think it's just a matter of going\nthrough it i don't think i necessarily\nneed\nguidance at the moment per se i just\ni just constantly see people suffering\nand they're coming to me with their\nsuffering and i'm just like man there's\na lot a lot of people are going through\nwhat i went through before so\ni think that's more and what is it what\nis it that they're going through\nuh that feeling of inadequacy that\nfeeling of not knowing you know we do\nthese call-in shows and\nand every day without fail i get i've\nbeen surprised by this i get 16 to 21\nyear olds hitting me up like i don't\nknow what i'm doing and i feel not\nconfident and i feel like i suck\nand i just want to give up on this all\ntogether what do you say to them\ni tell them to have patience with\nthemselves because this is going to proc\nis a process\nand i also remind them like if you don't\nput yourself out there there's no chance\nfor you to really have any sense of\nsuccess in this regard you know like\nyou can't shield yourself from from love\nand also get the benefits of it you have\nto\ntake some form of a leap so to give up\nis not in your best interest but also\nunderstand you have a lot of time ahead\nof you\neven though the world tells you as an 18\nyear old you're an adult and you need to\nknow what you're doing like most 18 year\nolds don't know\nyou know and so just to be patient with\nthemselves and to to remind themselves\nthat there's time for them to to grow\nand and so that's a great response i\nthink it's it's kind of interesting\nbecause there's also sort of like uh i\ndon't know if this is\nmaybe this is my own bias where i i'm\ninterpreting what you're saying is\nhaving a certain like masculine quality\nyou know of and maybe that's unfair\nmaybe it's\nit's neither masculine or feminine but\njust human is really when i stop and\nthink about it but i noticed that\ni had sort of a masculine response to\nthat which is like that's what men do\nright like you got to put yourself\nout there you gotta you gotta brave the\ndanger if you want the reward\nyeah and and that's something that you\nknow sort of a very like masculine ethos\nthat i think we kind of project but at\nthe end of the day i don't think it's\nreally masculine at all it's really just\nhuman\num right and but oddly enough i\ni was just surprised a little bit by my\nmind's reaction and then\nseeing how like how right that felt like\nthat's a manly thing to say\nlike when i heard you say like you know\nyou got to put yourself out there like\nsure you can you can't shield yourself\nand get the benefit you have to be brave\nyou have to be courageous yeah um\nand like i said i clearly don't i mean i\ndon't think it applies just to men but\nit's interesting\nhow that's kind of uh you know that's\nwhere we kind of go\nyou got to be manly bro yeah well i mean\nthe idea of putting yourself out there\nis what men are are repeatedly told all\nthe time whether it be like making the\nfirst move whether it's protecting your\nfamily and shielding them with your life\nwhether it's\nbeing the one to provide financially\nit's like you're the one who\nhas to put yourself on the limb in an\noutward perspective i think women do it\nas well\ni think it just doesn't manifest as like\noutwardly as\nit would with men traditionally i think\nthat's what it is yeah\nand so i want to go back to this like so\nsomeone asked you what you thought about\nred pill and what was your answer again\num\ni think it is the only\nsource of resources that\num that men have and i think it has its\nimperfections as a community\nbut some of their ideas are very valid\nand um you know\nthat that was my stance on it it's got\nits problems but it's only spot\nfermented to hear some of the stuff they\nneed to hear\nand what is it that you think they need\nto hear to take accountability\nto understand that they have a\nresponsibility towards\nself-improvement if they want the\nresults that they feel they should get\nthat they that it's not going to be\nhanded to them but they have to work\nyou know i got that from the military\nand other stuff they most folks don't\nget at that age\nyou know they don't get at the days they\ndon't get told like if you want to meet\nsomebody or find love you have to put in\nsome work\nyou know some people just feel entitled\nlike i'm supposed to find a partner and\ni'm supposed to just be\nit's like no there's things you got to\ndo so i think this idea of\naccountability and responsibility\ntowards self-improvement\nis two ideas that men desperately want\nto hear and want to be told\nand this community provides that what\nare some of the things in the community\nthat you think are\nnot as helpful okay this is when it gets\nto the minute stuff because you know\nyou have so many different voices kind\nof writing things so it's hard to\npinpoint one or two things i often agree\nwith some of the rhetoric that\nindividuals say\nas creators and i think sometimes i push\nback on that even the idea of like\num necessarily having to embrace\nuh traditional uh gender roles and the\nidea that if you don't you're somehow\nbeta or inferior\nor that if you happen to have a wife\nwho's a little bit more masculine\nthat makes you somehow less of a man\nit's just all these ideas that seem a\nlittle bit too rigid i'm not a big fan\nof\nso so what i'm it's interesting because\nwhen you when you talk about the\npositives\nonce again i think it's like stuff that\ni don't think is really\nmasculine i think it's human that you\nhave to take\naccountability for your actions and if\nyou want something in life you probably\nhave to work towards it\ni i agree the issue is they don't get\ntold that there's nobody there to tell\nthem that and if nobody's saying that to\nthem\nthen they'll go where they can find it\nso i think that's the\nlament yeah i i i'm not i just i get\nwhat you're saying\nyeah so so so the the the reason i kind\nof bring that up is because i i'm also\nhearing that some of the stuff\nthat is maybe a little bit more rigid\nthat you're not on board with\nseems in a definition standpoint like\nmore masculine\nlike gender roles like it's gendered by\nnature\nbut that that does that make sense\nwhat do you mean what do you mean by\nitself so so like you were kind of\ntalking about how like\nyou know traditionally like there's an\nidea of masculinity if you don't meet\nthat ideal your beta\nso the things that you don't really kind\nof agree with as much\nare like the things that are inherently\nmore gendered\nsure sure yeah i'm just drawing that\nkind of observation right yeah gender\nconformative yeah sure\nyeah right right so it's kind of\ninteresting because i i mean i'm with\nyou in terms of like\npeople need a place where they can be\nsupported\num in sort of a compassionate way and\nstill held accountable\nand this is something that you know it's\ninteresting because in our in our\ncoaching program part of what\nlike our values are a little bit weird\nbecause\nbeing nice is not one of them being\npolite is not one of them\nso one of the things that we actually\nwork really really hard with our coaches\nto train them in is to be authentic and\ncompassionate\nso what that means is like being\nauthentic is like if you think someone\nlike if your client is messing up then\nyou\nhold them accountable like you have to\nbe authentic with them you can't brush\nit over\nbut that that authenticity should be\ntempered with compassion\nso like it's walking the road of like\nnot blaming them\nbut also holding them accountable like\nbe like hey man like you're kind of\nyou know you're kind of screwing up here\nlike let's work on that\nbut like not let it slide yeah you know\ni think\none thing they do well within the red\ncommunity which works for some people\nis that they say things authentically in\na way that\nthey think you need to hear it and that\na lot of people do like so i've heard\ncoaches be like\nwhat's your problem young man and the\nman will be like well you know i'm not\ngetting girls together like well\nall right what's your what's your\nphysical stature like are you doing well\nphysically and he's like uh\nyou know i could stand the workout he's\nlike are you saying that you're fat and\ni remember when he said that to the man\na lot of people in the chat with crazy\nlike you can't say that but young my mom\nyou know what i feel like that's what i\nneeded to hear because i didn't want to\nacknowledge it and what i'm saying is\ni'm not saying it's necessarily the\nright way\nwhat i'm saying is that for some people\nthey feel like eating that\ndirectly is what they want and i\nremember also being an army and like\nhaving people talk to you that way\nsometimes is the thing that you need in\nsome circumstances and so\num what you thought about in terms of\nauthenticity and saying things\nand holding people accountably\naccountable they definitely have that a\nlot in the uh\nin that community yeah so i in my\nexperience you can be\nyou can certainly temper it with\ncompassion and you know\nyou know i i think i think there are a\nlot of things and maybe i'm wrong here\nbut there are a lot of things that i say\nto people in interviews that tend to be\nclipped out of context and sound really\nmean and\nyou know if you just look at the\ntranscript it certainly does sound mean\nbut they're usually said with compassion\nwhich is why people\nare okay with it yeah right but you\ngotta kind of you gotta\ncall it what it is you gotta you know if\nsomeone's got cancer you gotta diagnose\nit and like face that\nthat reality before you treat it\nyeah um and and so\nhmm yeah i mean i feel like we've\ni really appreciate kind of everything\nthat you've shared and i sort of\nunderstand what you're saying i think i\nagree with you that\nyou know men for sure and not to say\nthat women\nthat this is an exclusive need of men\nwhich i think is another big problem\nwith these\nkind of gender conversations is that\npeople tend to draw comparisons\num okay and and so i i think that it's\ncompletely\npossible for us because i see this you\nknow i see\nwomen having gender norms that are\nchallenging in an uphill struggle\nthat cause them a lot of personal\nsuffering and i think that men have\ngender norms that are challenging and\nsuffer and and cause them a lot of\nsuffering or uphill battle\nand somewhere along the way i think some\npeople feel like there's like\nit's a zero-sum game and so the more men\nstruggle\nyou're sort of devaluing women's\nstruggles or vice versa\nand i just don't really see it that way\ni just kind of think that you know\nthere are some cases of of male\nprivilege in some cases of\nfemale privilege there are some cases of\nminority privilege and some cases of\nmajority privilege\nit's kind of interesting being india and\ni kind of felt this\nin a bizarre way in like medicine so\neveryone\nlooks at me and assumes when i'm a\nmedical student that i'm a doctor\nbecause i'm indian\nwhich is fantastic um but\nyou know from a standardized test\nperspective like in terms of\nlike the standardized test score that i\nneed to get is like\n20 higher than like other ethnicities\nwho are underrepresented in medicine\nso i have to score above average to be\ncompetitive right um and then still on\nmy first day\nof training at harvard medical school a\nthird of the room was south asian\nand so you know it's like i don't know\nwhether it's right or wrong i've\ncertainly felt both sides of it\nand in terms of minority privilege and\nracism and\nyeah all that kind of stuff you know\nit's kind of interesting\nyeah i i think the issue with this more\nthan\ni agree that everyone has a struggle i\nthink i think\nthe problem is i just remember never\nhaving many resources to look towards\nwhereas when i think when i when i spoke\nto women on you\ni think they saw themselves in a lot of\nlike\ntalk shows for example or resources that\nthey could look towards\nfor information and i think you know\nit's just the idea of me having to go on\nyoutube to learn about this stuff in\n2012 which is so weird to me\num you know because you can't really\nthink of like tv talk shows for men or\nstuff like that\nand and more than just you know you know\nwhat i mean\nyeah i was just thinking like what's the\nmale equivalent of the view\nthat there is none that's my and i made\nthe comparison i said joe rogan which is\nfunny because it just used to be like a\nshitty podcast in some dude's basement\nand now it's like this worldwide thing\nbut it's inception it really wasn't um\nand and and more than that i think\noftentimes\num it's like\nthe little that we do have almost feels\nlike it's constantly being threatened\nto be cancelled and so it's just like\nyou get a little bit defensive\nyou know uh and so i understand that\nuh i mean yeah in terms of like the red\npill community sometimes\ndiversif deservedly so people just are\ngone in terms of like their presence\nonline\num take the rogan podcast another great\nexample which is like you know it's been\nin the news a few times for\nyou know people trying to have it\nremoved from online platforms and so\nthere's just this perception even if\nit's not reality\ni'll grandchild could be wrong and this\nis anecdotal but there's a perception\nthat male spaces are not safe\nthat's how a lot of folks feel and\nwhat's your understanding of of like joe\nrogan and like\nlike why it why it's been in the news\nfor being cancelled\nbecause it's a male space i'm gonna i'm\ngonna draw a parallel\nand um there's another individual\ncreates content online and sometimes\npeople feel like he\nwhen he's coaching people or when he's\ntalking to people right um that he\nhas a strong dislike for for women and\nso i\nwent to go watch his content and i went\nto go watch his like coaching with with\nmen and\na lot of the verbiage was the same i\nthink sometimes in male space we have a\nway of talking and we have a way with\nengaging with each other that's often\nseen\nas unacceptable or wrong\nwhen it's just for some people it's like\nit's a perfectly fine temperament\nand\ni think men feel like they're being\npoliced in a sense like\ndoes that make sense what i'm saying\nsure yeah so but give me an example of\nof what you think is like you know just\nis the language of men\nthat other people take offense to or\nthat other people are trying to police\ni couldn't give you an example of like\nwords we use i could just give you in\nterms of like a\nlike a bluntness so i had the same thing\nin the army the way we talk among\nsoldiers perfectly acceptable\nif it ever made it online there was no\nway we would keep our jobs but it is how\nwe speak on a regular basis\nit is how we talk to each other you know\nbehind closed doors or whatever\nand so there's this need to hide some of\nthat constantly\num and to temper our way of being online\nuh which would most like that's toxic\nand i'm like is it though\nor are we just fine with how we talk to\neach other so\nuh and i've just seen it so much over\nthe years like shows that i used to love\nthat i think geared towards men's\nexperience i remember this one on\non on bet the man show like gone you\nknow and and and people were like\nthis kind of talking isn't except i'm\nlike is it though so i think that's the\nperception\neven if not accurate that is the\nperception that a lot of men have yeah\nso i think that's\nthat's uh i i'd really love to hear some\nexamples abba because i think it's like\nif you're making the argument that\nsome people behind closed doors say\ncertain things which they're okay with\nwith\nwhich other people aren't okay with i\nthink that there's like\nsomething to really be explored there\nright so even if we look at the incel\ncommunity\num or like the red pill community so\nthere's this sense\nof so this is part of like what we've\nkind of uncovered in our research is\nthat\nyou know there's a sense of online drift\nso what tends to happen\nis that you know we start out like i'll\nlook at let's say like a jordan peterson\nvideo\non youtube and then what'll happen is\nlike my youtube will start recommending\nother things to me\nand depending on what i i click on like\ni'm going to go\nlike down this rabbit hole right\ni don't know you just kind of you almost\ndescribed jordan peterson as a gateway\nit was kind of funny to hear that but\nyou know\ni i i'm not i that wasn't it was i used\nhim as a good example because like\nhere's a good example yeah right so so\nlike what i'm not i'm not making a\njudgment or anything i'm saying like\nliterally from a youtube algorithm\nstandpoint this is literally what we're\nresearching\nis how online drift occurs so this is\nwhat content creation platforms do so\nthey curate content and they say like\noh for people who watch jordan peterson\nvideos like half of them\nalso like something else and then\nhalf of them like something else and you\nalso see this in\nin political drift right so if i watch\nlike\nfox news like a fox news clip that\nis making fox news look good on youtube\nthen\nlike youtube will populate with\nsomething else\nand then so over time what happens is\nlike we get and you kind of mention this\necho chamber over time it's kind of\nweird i don't think people\nrealize this is happening but because of\nthe nature of content\ncuration and platforms are trying to you\nknow\ndo this on purpose we start to be\nsurrounded by voices that are similar to\nour own\nsure i agree with that oh notion and\nover time as that radicalization happens\ni think that like you'll see in some of\nthese like\nyou know so then you'll get like the\nin-cell subreddit gets banned and things\nlike that\num and and so what ends up happening is\nover time people will like go to\nesoteric like further and further\nlike remove from the front page of the\ninternet\nand then sometimes in those spaces you\nknow you'll talk about people routinely\ndiscussing things like violence towards\nwomen and stuff like that\nand i i imagine that those people feel\nvery comfortable with their language\nbehind closed doors\nsure um and that people from out you\nknow on the other side of the door would\nfind it unacceptable\nbut you know how do they get from that\npoint part of it is also your drift but\na part of it is even the more modest\nexamples sometimes\nof like masculine discussions sometimes\nget\nremoved from platforms jordan peterson's\nexample you used as a starting point but\ni remember a time when he would get\nyou know boot out of universities and\ncolleges for\nfor rhetoric which i didn't think was\ncrazy extreme but that's what i'm\ntalking about when i say\nit almost feels like our language is\nbeing policed is that even the modest\nexample that you started with\nwas often being removed from campuses i\nremember seeing one guy who went in\nfor a discussion and they just barred\nthe doors and so um\nyou know when i see this stuff it it it\nchanges my perception of\nhow i think masculinity is viewed\nwhether accurate or not it is how i\nsee it yeah sure so so how do you think\nmasculinity is viewed\ntoxic i think it's very and\nand\nhere's what i'll say i think you know\nwhen you look at the uh\nmy mom are you dabbling in your world\nbut i think this is the five big big\npersonality traits\noh yeah yeah i just want to make sure\nyou know because that's what you studied\nso i just want to make sure i do it\nright\nit's just as much as your world um\ni think if you see an\nover-representation on any of those axes\ni think you're going to see negative um\nbehavior and i think\num you know one example i gave is like\nwhen you\ni take mothers for example i think their\nneed to protect\nand to nurture sometimes if taken to an\nextreme can turn into a turning\nto a concept i think it's called\nmaternal gatekeeping\ni think about a helicopter parent okay\nso a maternal cancer was an idea but but\nyeah\nlike the idea like you it's like the\nidea that you insulate your your child\nfrom\nsociety's problems so much you protect\nthem that you stunt their\ngrowth as a kid and i actually grew up\nwith a friend who went through that\nuh and had to be diagnosed then i was\nlike whoa and\nit just taught me the idea that yes of\ncourse if you take\ntraditionally masculine traits and you\npush them to an extreme i could\ndefinitely see how they're negative for\nsociety\num but i think even the more modest\nforms\nare sometimes seen as bad and like\ncompetitive sports\nis another interesting example where\nlike they\nthey don't like the idea of things being\ntoo competitive for young boys and i'm\nlike\ni feel like sometimes you rob them\nsomething that they desperately need you\nknow whether it's video games\ni'm not going to say women or anything\nlike that it just you know i remember\nwhen when these ideas were removed\nyou know like oh we're no longer giving\nout trophies or things like that\neveryone gets a little participate\ni was like ew like i loved it at school\nwhen i even if i didn't come in first\njust the idea of like trying to go for\nit\nmeant something to me and i think ideas\nthat like men traditionally value so\nmuch\nuh i think men feel like are being\nattacked that's what i think\ni'm not saying theaters and like i can\npoint to a group of people or say it's\nthis gender or anything like that this\nis just the perception i have of\nthat yeah so so what i'm because i i was\nkind of thinking about the sabbath like\nwe're trying to figure out\nto like how to support people right at\nhealthy gamer it's what we do\nwe try to offer people guidance i've\nbeen toying around with like making a\nguide to dating relationships which is\nyou know because i think there's a lot\nof basics that\ni'll teach because we're not taught\nthese things yeah\nso i don't do couples counseling which i\nexplain to all the couples who wind up\nin my office because i don't do that\nbut i definitely teach people how to\nwork on themselves to be\nlike better partners in relationships\nand there are a lot of like\nyou know quips that i've come up with\none is that you know everyone's looking\nfor the right partner but in my\nexperience\nthe right partner is not something you\nfind it's something that you become\nand and so i think that there's a lot of\nlike anyway so there's\nkind of a random aside but what i'm kind\nof hearing from you is that\nso it is part of the struggle of trying\nto figure out how to support people in\nour community\nmen women transgender folks kind of\neveryone\num part of what we're what i've been\ntrying to understand is like what is\ntoxic masculinity and what is\nmasculinity\nand and because there's this sort of\nidea that there's\nwhat's your cringe um\ni'm i'm i'm such a stickler for words\nand and so i understand it conceptually\nbut every time i hear it i cringe\nbut i understand what it is no no no no\ni think we should explore the cringe\nthat's where the money is\ni think i think people don't understand\ni think people\nhave this idea conceptually what the\nword means but they don't understand how\nit's internalized\nby our brains inherently meaning you\nknow i remember taking a marketing class\nand how important it was for a company\nto get the right slogan and the right\nwords at the same spot\nand no matter what a company may mean by\ntheir slogan they understand that people\ninterpret words\nand it just goes right to their core\nirrespective of what spin\nor what idea you want to put with it and\ni think whether it's you know\ntoxic masculinity or men are trash i\nthink the ideas behind the sentiment i\ncan understand\ni just think people don't understand the\nimplications it has subconsciously and\nhow it makes us feel viscerally when we\nhear these ideas\nhow do you feel viscerally when you hear\nthe phrase toxic masculinity\ni'm going to use men or trash because i\nthink that's like a much more\npoignant one and i think a more extreme\none but um i think when i hear that for\nexample\ni immediately think we're not redeemable\ni think of the word trash and i think of\nthrowing it out\nyou know i think it's like it's over for\nthat and i and it's just such a tough\nthing to\nto hear especially when you're young in\ndevelopment you see it online men are\ntrash men are trash and\nmasculinity's toxic or toxic masculinity\nyou're just like woof\nit's very it's very polarizing language\nthat's why\nso so you you you equate toxic\nmasculinity like in\nwhen you hear the phrase toxic\nmasculinity your mind goes to men or\ntrash\nokay men are trash is a separate phrase\nbut they're often coupled with each\nother\nonline and platforms so for me yeah for\nme it's like part of that whole ensemble\nkind of of of polarizing terms that\npeople use\num that i think uh has a more of a\nnegative effect than anything else\nyeah because it reinforces it reinforces\nan idea that i think a lot of people\nalready hold in their heads\nand what is that idea uh\nyou know it's like it goes back to that\nidea of like policing and and\nand and men have these\nthat men are the problem you know and\nit's just like i said\ni understand it conceptually as like as\na macro scale but as a micro skill\nsomeone with dealing with struggles it\njust constantly feels like i'm hearing\nlike your men's problems don't matter\nthat's what i hear when i hear that\nstuff\neven i know it's not what they're saying\ni get it that's what it feels like just\nconsidering the\nother societal stuff that i deal with\nhave you felt like\npeople have treated you like your\nproblems don't matter\noh yeah oh yeah every all the time all\nthe time\nstill i mean sometimes i get sick of\ntalking about men's issues or men's\nproblems like i don't even want to\ndiscuss them at times because it's just\nlike\nyou're always going to have a role\npeople like oh man are complaining again\ni'm like\nmen are committing suicide too you know\nlike it's crazy to me\nthat there's all these things and you\ncould verifiably like quantify them in\nsome ways\nand people are still like you guys don't\nreally have problems and i'm just like\nwhat or or the worst one i don't think\nit's worse but\nit's it's somewhat but the the thing i\nhate them even more sometimes is\nit's like we get that you suffer but\nbecause women suffer more like\nlet's put that on the back burner i'm\njust like bruh um\nso so yeah it's just it's just things\nthat peeved me but i i don't\nwant to get about it how does it how\ndoes it feel when people\ninvalidate your struggles\ni think i'm fortunate that i'm at the\nage that i am now and that i've dealt\nwith so much\nbecause i'm able to handle it up better\nbut sometimes it takes me back to how i\nwas when i was much younger\nand i was dealing with stuff and i had\nnothing\nand it's just be like man 20 world me\nwould have never survived a lot of this\nlike this would have really\nwrecked me um and it makes me\nit makes me sad it makes me sad because\ni think i recognize a lot of people are\nyoung and in a vulnerable state\nand the language we use doesn't help to\nmake them feel accepted or to feel okay\nyou know i think these conversations are\nimportant they're absolutely necessary\nto have\nbut i think we don't it's like what you\nsaid there's a way to do things with\ncompassion\nthat's what's lacking with the discourse\nand also understanding that the person\nthat you're talking to yes\nyou know they exist within a larger\ngroup whether it be gender or sex or\nwhatever\nbut they're also individuals who are\ndealing with their own problems that you\ndon't know about\nand uh i just think the way we have\nthese conversations uh just makes me sad\nmore than anything\nare there particular things kind of that\nhappened to you when you were\nlike 20 or maybe even younger where you\nfelt like you had a particular struggle\nthat was very important to you that\npeople didn't seem to\nyou know i can't i can't pinpoint a\nmoment i just know what it's like to go\nthrough life without a mentor\nand to go through life having to figure\nit out as a young adult\nand to have no resources to help you\nlike i know how lonely that is and how\nfrightening that is and how inadequate\nand like shitty you feel it's not a\none-time thing it's like an everyday\nthing for a lot of young folks and\nit just seems like um when you're in\nthat little\nwhat do they live with every day just\ntremendous anxiety about like not\nknowing where the future is going\nand and and feeling like they're\nsupposed to have their [ __ ] together but\nthey don't\nand feeling like\nfeeling like they're not good enough\nwhile everyone else is like because you\njust\nyou know you go to instagram and you\njust like damn everyone's popping they\nlive in their best life right and it's\njust like that's not what's happening\nbehind closed doors that's the\nperception you have you feel alone and\nstruggling\nthat's what it is you just feel\ninadequate talk to any like 18 to 21\nyear old and they'll say they'll be like\ni don't know what the [ __ ] i'm doing\ni'm in school and i don't like my major\ni'm in debt\ni don't know what i want to do with my\nfuture women don't like me it's like god\ndamn it's a lot of struggles\nyou know i understand that women go\nthrough on the same side i'm not\ndiscounting that\nfor me it's just as a man i understand\nthat experience a little bit better so\nthat's just why i speak to well so i\nthink there's there is a big difference\nand you know here i may say\nsomething that will get me canceled but\nwhat i'm hearing from you is that\nthe response so like i think i agree\nwith you that men and women all share\nthat i've had\nyou know my lion's share of men and\nwomen who each struggle with 18 years\nold and being directionless and being in\ndebt and whatnot\nyeah but what i am hearing is that i i\ndo think there's a certain amount of\nacceptableness to invalidate\nmen's struggles so what i'm hearing from\nyou is that\nyou know if you complain there are going\nto be people out there who will say men\nare trash what are you complaining about\nand and and i think that we all struggle\nand we all suffer this is what buddha\nsaid he said that\nyou know there are two guaranteed things\nin life and he didn't really break\nthings down by race or class or\nethnicity or gender\nand the two things that all human beings\nare entitled to in life are suffering\nand death\nand and i think that you know i tend to\nagree with him\nthat suffering is sort of a universal\nhuman condition\nbut what i'm kind of hearing from you is\nthat\nbecause what seems like what really\ngrates you is the invalidation of your\nstruggle like the struggle is shared but\nthe way that people listen to your\nstruggle and that's sort of what i'm\nhearing is that\nyou know even if we think about these\nlike sexual assault victims who are who\nare men and who kind of\nare like you know you should be happy\nthat your teacher is sleeping with you\nthat's your teacher 15.\nsure you know you know even i hold some\nof these bad ideas\nwhat do you mean i hold some of these\nbad like like conceptually i agree with\nyou that it's terrible that a teacher\nwould sleep with a fifth year old\nin my mind for whatever conditioning i'm\njust like hey man good job and it's a\nterrible sentiment\nterrible and i can acknowledge it's not\nbased on anything but it's just\ni've been programmed i had a teacher i\nliked i wish she would\nit's not it's not a good thing to think\nbut i also participate that at times so\ni have to check myself\num yeah but what you said about the\nsuffering is something i agree\ni agree that it's it's part of our\nexperience i just think\ni wish we wouldn't go to such lengths\ncreate more suffering for others or if\npeople are suffering\nto make them feel like they're suffering\ndoesn't matter you know like i think my\ngoal in life is to try to alleviate\npeople suffering as much as i can even\nthough people need to have a certain\nlevel of it\nand to not to not try and create more\nfor others\ni think that's my goal so yeah i just\nhave a hard time when people\nactively don't realize in which ways\nthey may be creating some and uh\ndon't seem to care at all that's like\nthe struggle i have sure\nso just something for you to think about\nabba you know i don't think we need to\nget into this but i i would really\nuh invite you to explore kind of on your\nown if there have been\nso the emotional energy when we talked\nabout the invalidation of people's\nstruggles and when i mentioned toxic\nmasculinity\nwhen i see that emotional energy in\npeople oftentimes it stems from like\nactually like a\nbizarrely unrelated personal experience\nand i think we're hearing the themes of\nyou kind of being alone\nand and maybe they're because i i i\nthink you know oddly enough we didn't\nreally get into this but\nyou kind of said that you felt ashamed\nof reaching out to other people for help\nand the interesting thing is that shame\nis learned\nright so like like like we human beings\naren't\nborn with that in fact babies reach out\nfor help all the time\nso that shame of being inadequate and\nneeding help from someone else\nis something that we're taught and\nconditioned to do\nand so oddly enough you know if we think\nabout why did you feel ashamed asking\nfor help it's probably because if we\nkind of track that back\nit's probably because there were times\nin your life where you did reach out for\nhelp\nand then your struggle was essentially\ninvalidated\nand someone made you feel like right\nlike that's that's how you're going to\ndevelop that\nshameful condition okay can i ask you\nsomething in your practice when you're\nspeaking to men do you not feel like\nthey have that same experience\nof reaching out for help because\nokay so that's why i'm telling you okay\nokay all right\nall right that's why i'm telling you\nthat i've walked this journey with many\nmen\nand the fact that you respond very\nemotionally to like when i mention toxic\nmasculinity you just get pissed right\nlike\nit's like some slumbering giant wakes up\nwithin you and like\nyou equate that to men and trash that\ngoes to an\ninvalidation of the struggle and pain\nthat you feel which in turn probably\nrelates i'm\ni'm making a real stretch here okay so\neach step at these is like 10\nchance of being right but because it is\na shared experience which is why i can\nlay this out for you\nor other people that are watching right\nso like if that pisses you off then\nchances are like you're\nyou have personally felt like that's\npersonal emotional energy\nabout you've been on the receiving end\nof that stick which is why it hurts so\nmuch\nwhen you see other people doing it you\nknow like\nlike victimizing like 20 year olds you\nimagine 20\nyear old you who's seeing on twitter\nthat men are trash and like he doesn't\nhave\nthe fortitude that you have to like not\ninternalize that\nyeah yeah and oddly enough that's\nsomething that you understand because at\none point\nyou didn't have the internal fortitude\nto internalize it\nwhich is exactly what you did\nand and that's sort of why we get to 18\nyear olds because\nit's interesting because it's not like a\ncatastrophic emotional moment that we're\ngonna have an emotional catharsis about\nit's gonna be like these little bits of\nlike conditioning that happen\nabout you know when you were seven years\nold there was one day that you like\ndidn't know how to do your math homework\nand then like you know you tried to talk\nto someone about it and they were like\nshouldn't you know how to do this\nokay i actually got something for you\nokay this is the one that stuck\nit's one of the few childhood numbers so\ni remember oh man this is taking me so\nfar back this is the first time i was\n12. i was 12 i think could be wrong\nabout the age it doesn't matter\nuh we would do this thing at school\nwhere once it would snow real bad we\nwould make these snow forts\nand everyone would make their own and\nthen obviously a little bit of like\nwater would fall and it would get iced\nup and um there was this girl who lived\nacross the street from me and my\nneighborhood we take the bus the whole\ngroup of us take a bus but she'd be part\nof that group\nand uh man i remember having a crush on\nthis girl\ni'll never forget i used to have a big\nquestion on this girl but i never talked\nabout it\nand um you know when you're a kid and\nyou have a crush on somebody sometimes\nyou might be like a little bit mean to\nthem and so i had a little habit of like\ngoing back and forth with her like that\nas a kid i remember this\nand one morning\nwe came to school and her fort had been\ndestroyed as well as like two other\nthree-fourths\nshe went to the principal and she said\nabba did it\nabba destroyed my fort and so i got\ncalled into the principal's office and\ni'm just standing here she's there so i\nwas like oh\nwhat's she doing here and the prisoner\nasked me why i destroyed the forts and i\nwas like what are you talking about\nand and he's like he's like well people\nwant to know i\nwas like i didn't do anything do you\nthink i came to school early to destroy\nthings you think i walked here\nand they're like well everyone's saying\nit's you and i was like i didn't do it\nokay i don't know what to tell you i\ndidn't do it\nand um i remember they called my parents\nand it turned into something\nand i'll never forget this i think it\nwas like two days later\ni got called back into the office and\nthe girl was there she was crying the\nprincipal's\nstanding there and her dad's there and\ni'm just like what'd i do this time\nand uh he says she has something she\nwould like to say\nand she said uh i'm sorry and i'll say\nwhat happened and it's like\nturns out the janitor was getting tired\nof these snow forts when he was cleaning\nthe yard\nso he just ran over them just to flatten\nthem out and clear them out of the way\nand i remember being so mad i just\nremember being so angry because i'm like\neverybody looked at me like i was\ngarbage for a couple days just like\nshe's that being accused and like how\nher word was inherently taken as true\nand i just remember being so mad that\nday and uh\ni accepted her apology and went back but\ni don't know why that memory always\nstuck with me as the first time\ni was accused of something i didn't do\nand i just\ni remember being so mad about that now\nthat's probably the experience\nyeah so that's it\nyeah that's a good one i have never\nbrought that up before\nyeah so it's interesting right like how\nthe mind works how like your mind just\nlike jumps to that experience because\nwhat i'm hearing so so i'm gonna try to\ninterpret this a little bit for you okay\nbecause like it feels a little bit\noff to me but i think it's actually it\nit's that emotional energy like\nnow i'll ask you abby you know just\nsomething for you to think about when\nyou hear the word toxic masculinity\ndoes the quality color and flavor of the\nemotion you feel\nfeel similar to what you felt in that\nsecond principal's office\noh yeah for sure you know because the\nidea is the idea that like\nyou're wrong without any concept of who\ni am like you're wrong it's that\nsimilar idea i would be inclined to\nagree with you right so which is why\nyour mind jumped there because it's\nit's but like there's there's a lot of\nsubtlety there right because like what\ni'm hearing is that like\nwhen she had a grievance what happened\nwhen she was hurt\nand then what happened she was she was\nhurt she was hurt right you were called\nin\nthere was a trial people were called in\neveryone said you do it there was an\ninvestigation\nand when you were hurt what happened\npeople thought you were trash for days\nwhat happened when you were hurt\nyeah i think i was just i was given a\nsmall apology and then i shut out the\ndoor\nabsolutely yeah right\nyeah no no and let me ask you another\nquestion\nwere you pressured or forced into\naccepting her apology\ni think yeah i think i was just expected\nto accept it\nright so like when you're a 12 year old\nboy and there's a girl crying and she\napologizes\nyou don't get to say [ __ ] you\nno right\neven though that's how you feel so in\nthat moment it's sort of like it's it's\nincredibly invalidating\nright and and it's it's like it's just\nit's like\nnight and day yeah and and i think it it\nspeaks to a lot of like\nresentment that you carry with you which\nis justified\nbut i think still is going to color the\nway that you look at things\nfor sure undoubtedly undoubtedly i mean\nyou know and and similar experience like\nthat i've played out throughout my life\nwhere culpability is just automatically\nassumed\nfor reasons i can't explain so i\nattribute to gender\nbut it's just like um it's a tough thing\nto accept when you think of yourself as\nlike somebody who has some measure of\nintegrity\nand that's immediately thrown out the\nwindow because for whatever reason\nit's a hard thing to stomach it's like i\ndidn't do anything wrong this moment but\ni'm immediately seen as evil\nit's a hard thing to accept and to\nyeah this is hard it's a very difficult\nthing for me to accept\nyeah i mean what i'm hearing is that\nyou're being blamed for men being trash\nyeah yeah definitely definitely and\nit's compounded by the idea that\nsometimes\nit's like you know because i don't i\ndon't necessarily experience it\nwhen men are trash i'm not there in\nthose intimate moments with women where\nthey're being violent so i don't\ni don't know what that feels like i can\nhear about it and i can sympathize\nbut i do know what it feels like to\nto be falsely accused by somebody who\ndid something terrible to you\nand and because they're a woman they're\nlike inherently seen as like they\ncouldn't have done it\nand it's a tough thing to stomach so i\nthink that's why i probably feel more\nstrongly about that\nbecause that's what i have visceral\nexperiences with absolutely\nyou know like my my negative experiences\nwith men could have probably been\nranging\nfrom when i was like 14 to 17.\nand there was always a catharsis we got\ninto a fight we exhausted all our energy\none person one one person lost and i\nmove away but there was never this idea\nthat\nyou're evil because you did this it was\nlike we're gonna just duke it out as\nequals and then that's it you know and i\ncould live with that\nwhat i couldn't understand was like no\nthis person was wrong\nbut i'm seen as a guilty party that's a\nhard thing to stomach and not only\ntalking about like when i was like 17\ni'm like talking about even later on in\nlife so\num that's a tough part i think for me\nhas there been another\ntime where you know you've been right\nyeah yeah yeah\nyeah it was crazy it was crazy this girl\ntried to pressure me to kiss her i'm\nlike\ni don't want to like i told her multiple\ntimes i'm not interested\nand you know because i felt like it was\ntoo soon for me that i just didn't want\nto in that moment\nand but i was interested in this person\nbut i just felt like the way she was\ngoing about it i wasn't feeling\nand i remember a week later right we\nwere having this conversation and she\nwas like\nthis is like a 2018 so prime time you\nknow harvey weinstein's out there\nand she was having this conversation\nabout like men have to be more conscious\nabout the fact that they're pressuring\nwomen and i was like\nyou did that to me like a week ago\nyou know i couldn't believe it in that\nmoment you know\nand it was just such a weird thing to me\nit was like\nit it that even to this day triggers me\nyeah i see that the audacity for you to\nhave this speech for me right now when\nyou're not even taking culpability for\nthe things that you've done and it's\njust\nthat's the frustrating part but like i\nsaid\ni feel this viscerally because of the\nfact that there are my experiences\nwith women right and i feel this\nviscerally because i only date women so\nthe things that men are doing that maybe\nmerit the whole\namount of trash i don't see them because\na lot of this stuff happened happens\nbehind closed doors or things like that\nand\nyou know there are too many parties\npresent so i'm not discounting the idea\nthat these things happen\nor that women are suffering i would\nnever do that but i'm like i can only\nspeak to what i see\nand that's what's going to cover my\nperspective so yeah so i just want to\nshare\nyou know a couple of like maybe academic\nthoughts sure for sure go for it\num so you know the first is that that i\nwant to just\ninvite you to question your earlier\nassertion\nlike the assertion you just made that i\ndon't see that so i think this is\nsomething where you know\na lot of men i know certainly since i've\nstarted looking for it that like\nif you actually look at it objectively\nthere may be more of it than you realize\num and i think it's true of of women too\nwhere where you know like\nsometimes it's kind of interesting\nbecause when i work with my female\nclients sometimes i'll ask a question\nlike we'll be talking about something in\ntherapy and i'll ask them like\nwhat would your girlfriend say about\nthis and like you know\ntheir response is always like their\ngirlfriends are overwhelmingly\nsupportive\nirrespective of like how this person may\nhave screwed up\nand you know in some cases you'll have\nlike married women that have affairs and\nstuff and their girlfriends are like 100\nsupporting them right and and so you\nknow i'm i'm a big fan of being\nauthentic and then i'm you know so i'll\nask for permission to be like a little\nbit more judgmental i don't even ask\nthem\nlike can i be judgmental in this moment\nand so if you really\nso i think like we have a tendency when\nwe're with our group\nto you know gloss over a lot of things\nand say we haven't seen them because you\nhaven't been on the receiving end\nbut behind some of these closed-door\nconversations that may get people\ncanceled\nthere may be more evidence of toxicity\nyou know directed from men towards women\nthat we sort of like pass off based on\nour language\nso i'd encourage you to just really be a\nlittle bit like careful and objective\nabout that\ni'm not saying that you know you're\nsometimes there's more toxicity that we\ntake for granted because it's so\nnormative\nright and like certainly we've been\ntalking about the normative toxicity\nthat men\nput on themselves and there may be other\nkinds of toxicities there's just\nsomething to think about\nno no no you're right and and biases\nlike that\nprobably have clouded my conversations\nwith people in my\nuh my time on earth and\ni would be inclined to agree i think\nit's just hard to recognize where those\nblinders\nare because a lot of this happens in\ngray areas\nyou know even when i recount the story\nof the girl to other people\nsometimes they don't even see it even\nafter explaining them to so it can be\ndifficult\nto see that and and i would i would be\ninclined to agree with you that i could\ndo a better job in that regards\nyeah so but that's the nature of\nblinders right like we don't blame you\nfor having blinders because that's just\nwhat the mind does it has all these\nkinds of blinders and that's the nature\nof bias\nand and so that's number one so the\nsecond thing that i just want to\ntouch on which is you know i'd love to\nget your thoughts so you know i tossed\nout this term\ntoxic masculinity we went on a beautiful\ntangent my favorite of the day\nuh it was it really abbott's lovely to\nsee how\nlike animated and passionate and like\nwhen you get that plus the\nthoughtfulness like i\ni don't know why i mean the stories\nreally weren't positive in any way shape\nor form but just\nhearing the way is something about your\nstorytelling capability or something i\njust really enjoyed hearing that and i i\nfelt like\ni felt oddly enough happy that you were\nable to sort of share that even though\nit's kind of an ugly story if you really\nthink about it\nyeah yeah you know\nbut you know it's interesting even even\nyour response to the story\nindicates the different perception\nof it because i i feel like\nagain this is probably my biases again\nbut it's one of those things where it's\nlike\nwe can have this conversation and it not\nbe too much of an issue i think\nprecise maybe i'm wrong precisely\nbecause of the different genders\ndo you know what i mean wha what do you\nmean\nmeaning like i'm talking about as i'm\ntalking about this right and we're\nhaving this conversation about being\npressured like\neven though intellectually we might look\nat it and be like yeah that was terrible\nand toxic i think\nsubconsciously we don't we don't infer\nthat same implication\nwe don't actually see it as necessarily\nbeing as terrible\nas the action itself would normally\ndictate does that make sense\ni i say it's terrible right i think i\nthink you see it as terrible too\ni don't even think i do that's that's\nthe [ __ ] up part yeah that's the part\nabout that\nso so so here's here's the reason i\nthink you think it is terrible\non a subconscious or unconscious level\nthere are parts of you that don't\nbut like the fact that i mentioned to\nyou that there's going to be\nyou know maybe you can look for a time\nin your life where your struggles were\nhorribly invalidated\nright and and your mind goes there that\ntells us that like you do\nfeel on some level like your mind can\nlike i'm talking about a position where\nyour struggles are invalidated\nand you're unfairly judged and your mind\nis like here we've got it we found the\nfile\nright yeah it jumps right there so that\nthat i think even though i don't doubt\nthat society has taught you because\nthat's what happened right in that\nmoment\nis society taught you that like she's\nbeen this\nentire school has thought you're an\n[ __ ] for two days and\nit's not like the apology should be\npublic in front of the\nschool assembly because they've been you\nknow\nand like did anyone know that she\napologized did anyone know that\nyou were falsely accused no so the\nshaming was public but the apology was\nprivate and then you were expected to\nmove on\nthat is society's response to you being\nwronged\nright and so no no surprise that you\nwere\ntaught or conditioned to feel like\nyou don't get to complain like who are\nyou to complain\ndoes that make sense so i get that your\ncondition but i i\nalso think that your mind's ability to\nconnect those two dots means that\nthere's also\nsome amount of like authentic like you\nrecognize that that\nreally was not fair and was uh i\ni agree i think my question lies more in\nthe fact do other people have that\nconnection and if they don't\nhow do they perceive it because i think\nit's fine for you to feel like something\nunjustly happened to you\nbut if other people around you don't\nacknowledge it it can feel very\nyou start to question it i start to\nguess like myself to be like\ndid anything really happen uh and so i\nthink that's more so my issue\nuh more than anything sure sure so so i\nthink that too\ni'm guessing that there's going to be\nother stories about that\nyeah right there are going to be stories\nwhere as you grow older and you become\nmore\nlike assured of yourself yeah i bet you\nif we dug around we would find stories\nwhere like you\nfelt a particular way i mean we've even\nheard a couple right we're like\nthey're these people publicly talking\nabout bound setting and respecting\nyou know people and then like here they\nare like groping you and\nyou know trying to get a piece of abba\nyeah because that's that's a fine piece\nof meat\nand and then they're like you know\nthey're they're talking one way\nand you know what i question i\nquestion whether or not that kind of\nstuff\nhas any kind of subconscious negative\num\nconsequences in the sense that like it's\none thing to say things but i think\npeople really resonate with how you\nact and in terms of the messaging i\nwonder if that's not\nbackwards it's like we can say things\nintrinsically like oh we can say like oh\nyou know\nwe shouldn't do this to each other or\nlike oh you know i know plenty of people\nlike gender roles are terrible and then\nlike you see their dating life and they\nsubscribe to them 150\nall their choices and how they want to\nlive and i'm like are we doing something\nthat's super confusing\nin the sense that you know we can say\nwhatever we want but the way that we act\nreally encourages people to not act in\nline with what we\naspire to be but more so how we're being\ndoes that make sense yeah i didn't quite\nfollow you but i think i know what\nyou're saying so here's what i would say\nto that\nit is very common for someone to\npublicly support a righteous cause\nand their ego to excuse them being an\n[ __ ] in their personal life\nbecause they support a good cause\ni don't know if that's speaking to what\nyou're saying but i think that we see\nthis\ni see this like a seeming contradiction\nvery often\nand there's even a term for it in\npsychology which is reaction formation\nso it's a defense mechanism okay um\nwhere like the the classic example of of\nreaction formation is the person who's\nactually gay who becomes a homophobe\nno okay yes right so like they feel so\nashamed of like what they are on the\ninside that they like they're taught to\nhate it and then they like resent\nthemselves\nthey're very kind of like ugly on the\ninside they have a lot of resentment a\nlot of pain a lot of suffering\nand then they channel that towards the\noutside world and like hate gay people\nright and and so yeah i i think it's not\nnecessarily what i'm going i think where\ni'm trying to go is like\nyou can have a parent that tells you to\nnot be physically violent with others\nbut if they beat you\ndo you go on to say that's an acceptable\nresponse\nor do you like do you base your reality\noff of what they did rather than what\nthey said does that make sense\nabsolutely no yeah you base your reality\noff of the [ __ ] confusion of being in\nthat situation\nokay okay cool right and and so i i'll\ngive you just another example most of\nthe advice that we give to other human\nbeings is based on the resentment for\nwhat we\nof the mistake mistakes that we've made\nin the past\nsure i would agree with that right so\nlike there's there's definitely like\nsome kind of\nconnection and tension between what you\nsay and what you do\nand there's a reason why human beings\nare like hypocritical like there's all\nkinds of psychological reasons why we're\nhypocritical\nreaction formation is one one is like it\nhar\nyou know it comes from our own\nresentment even the political not\npolitical but like the views that we're\ntalking about today i think\nif we really look at the map are deeply\nrooted in your personal experiences\nwhich is\nreasonable right that's just how we\nlearn to care about particular things\nthat's right that's true um kind of the\nlast sort of academic point that i\nwanted to mention was kind of back to\ntoxic masculinity\nand it was sort of like we're trying to\nfigure out what to do about this because\nthe term means so many different things\nto so many different people\nright so some people equate toxic\nmasculinity as masculinity is toxic\nsure right so that's sort of the men is\ntrash masculinity\nis inherently evil patriarchal whatever\nyou know paternal whatever then there's\nkind of another perspective on it which\nis that there's like healthy masculinity\nand there's\ntoxic masculinity that there are some\ngender roles which are actually like\nokay to have and and can even be healthy\nlike\ncompetitiveness taking accountability\nwhich don't necessarily have to be\ngendered but\nsort of are gendered\nand that somewhere along the way like\nyou know\nlearning to be self-sufficient crosses a\ncertain like gray area\ninto the bridge of like self-isolation\nyou know\nand and sort of like being in control of\nyour emotions starts to mean like i\nthink a good example is\nsort of this apology that you were kind\nof forced into because you can't really\nlike you can't really say no i don't\naccept your apology right you're not\nallowed to do that\nyeah and and so there are certain\naspects of masculinity which can\nbecome toxic but that masculinity in and\nof itself is not inherently bad\nwhich isn't a separate argument but and\nso i'm not quite\nsure because i i do think there's a lot\nof confusion around these terms and like\nwhat it means\num you know you're smiling again so\npenny for your thoughts\nuh no no i'm actually just listening\nintently uh while i'm okay\nyeah so so i think this is something\nthat we're kind of working through\num it's something that we do research on\nand i'm just kind of curious so i i\nyou know i understood your reaction but\ni just wanted to share sort of how we're\nthinking about it which is like trying\nto figure out\nyou know is certain amount okay and then\nlike what is the difference between\nhealthy masculinity and toxic\nmasculinity\nyeah yeah i think i think even getting\nto that point\nhaving that discussion is difficult for\npeople because the terms are so loaded\nand because like again you know so many\nvarying definitions and\noftentimes we're having these\ndiscussions on public platforms and 140\ncharacters it's tough to\nget a good perception of the term and i\nthink branding wise\nbecause i i think people hate marketing\nterms in terms of civil discourse but i\nthink it matters\ni think how things are branded\ninherently creates biases and\nand natural reactions to things that\ncloud\nthe possibility of like good discourse\num\nand i think most men's reaction when\nthey hear that term is viscerally\nnegative\nand so you can't even get past the layer\nof like explaining what's going on\nbehind it\nbecause they're so reactionary to the\nterm you've just used\nyou know um so i think\ni think that's one hurdle that's like\nvery difficult to cross for most people\ni think i can intellectually do it and\nand be able to hear that i get what\nyou're saying you know what\ni agree with you but i also know for\nmost folks that they're not going to get\nto that point and that's a tough thing\nto\nto hear yeah\nthat's my thoughts on on that that first\nhurdle seems to be the one that most\npeople have difficult with difficulty\nwith\nand there's also a question to be asked\nlike are we using the right words\nand some people like what does it matter\nthere's a problem i'm like it does\nmatter though\nevery the the words you use have\nvisceral reactions for everyone\nyou know whether you use words like\nmoist and people are just instantly\ngrossed out even though you're talking\nabout a\ncountertop that is moist just say i did\nthat people like they hear the word\nour words matter what words we use\nmatter and i think\nthat's such a seems like such a minor\ndetail but i think it's like one of the\nlargest impediments to a real discussion\non what i think i agree with you which\nis the\nidea is like sometimes you know\nmasculine\ntraditionally masculine traits can be\ntaken too far they do become bad\naggression is a perfect example i think\nmen you might correct me if i'm wrong\nmen are overrepresented on one end of\nthe scale in terms of aggression correct\ni i don't know what you mean by that\nquestion when we talk about um\nthe big five right uh i'm pretty sure\nwhen it comes to like aggressive type\nbehaviors are men not overrepresented\nwhat do you mean by over-represented do\nyou mean greater than 50 percent of\naggressive\nfigures are done by men yeah i actually\ndon't know that statistic off the top of\nmy head okay\ni could be wrong i think i know with\nlike conscientiousness or like you know\nideas like compassion i think women\nmight be more represented in some\nregards like men when it comes to\nviolence like\nthey're much more represented on the\nextremes if i remember correctly that's\nwhat i remember\nso at times like violent crime\ntraditions why so why men are present\nthere whatever\num where was i going with this okay yes\ni could agree that if you if you over\nrepresent men in certain areas\nuh certain personality traits that yes i\ncould definitely understand that the\nokay toxic masculine i can see how\nthat's represented\num and i think the discussion is valid\nagain i i just think it really comes\ndown to the the\nthe um the branding more than anything\nthat'd be my\nyeah so i think when it gets to\nstatistics we get into a really tricky\nsituation so like just to give you an\nexample\nthere was a paper that showed that being\non\nantidepressants during pregnancy doubled\nyour risk of having an autistic child\nso people like when this paper came out\npeople freaked out because like doubling\nyour risk and the other thing that you\nhave to remember is that like\nmedia organizations are not about\naccurate representation\nof knowledge they're about clicks\nright so like they're gonna make things\nas inflammatory as possible certainly\none interpretation of the paper\nthe thing that people don't really get\nthough is that\nif you look at statistically doubling\nthe risk sounds really really bad\nright but i still think like 98\nof autistic children are born to women\nwithout antidepressants\nand 98 to 99 of women on antidepressants\ndo not have\nan autistic child so it's kind of\ninteresting because depending on how you\nlook at the numbers like the vast\nmajority of autistic children are still\nborn to people\nit doubles your risk but the risk is\nvery very small\nand so just from an epidemiological\nperspective it's still like\nyou know 99 out of 100 autistic kids are\nborn to mothers\nwithout antidepressants and if you have\na 99 if you have it if you're taking\nantidepressants\nduring pregnancy you have like a less\nthan one percent risk of having an\nautistic child and so i think when\nwhen people ask these questions about\nyou know males are over represented on\non\nthe aggression scale i don't know the\ndata but i know that you have to be\nreally careful about interpreting that\nkind of data\nbecause my general perception about men\nin aggressiveness\nis that people\noverestimate the percentage of men who\nare aggressive\nyes yes that's been my anecdotal\nexperience\nis that like yeah i i i want to\nunderstand\ni think that's why i was more so talking\nabout the extremes where it's like a\nvery small minute\npopulation size but i get what you're\nsaying yes yeah so you just have to be\ni just don't know what that means and so\ni'm hesitant to say yes to that because\nlike\ni think you know the vast vast majority\nof men are not\nviolent in any way yeah what i meant to\nsay and maybe\ni'll just try to clear it up is that\nidea like when you see extremely high\nlevels of\naggressive or violent behavior um\ntraditionally men are overrepresented in\nthat very small\npopulation that that i could would\ncompletely believe so that's what i was\ntrying to say i just didn't use my words\nwell so what you're saying is that\nthat if you take the most the one\npercent of the most violent human beings\non the planet\nmost of them or more than 50 percent\nwill be men\nyeah yeah which i i i would completely\nbelieve that statistic\nyeah it's just and i think yeah i think\nwe both agree on that and then\nyou know one thing that was really\ninteresting for me to read up on is the\nidea that like\nwe're more alike than we are different\nin terms of like how\num those personality traits are\nrepresented the idea like uh\nyes sir go ahead yeah so i mean i was\ngonna say just as a clinician like\nthat's been my experience is that i\ncertainly think that there are unique\ngender issues but at the end of the day\ni'm sort of in buddhist camp which is\nthat if you're born\nyou're sol yeah yeah and\nyou know i'm not mad at that i'm not mad\nat that and so it's kind of like\nyou know everyone sort of deserves\nsupport and help\num yeah yep yeah so how are you feeling\nabout today's\nconversation i mean did we cover most of\nwhat you were kind of looking for\nor yeah no i think it was a great\ndiscussion and uh when\ndepth on certain things that i haven't\nhad an opportunity to discuss before so\nthat was great\nyeah yeah i i mean i i sort of feel like\nwe're at a natural stopping point or\npausing point maybe is a better way to\nto talk about it makes me think back to\nyou know these emails that i wrote to my\nfriends and a couple years ago and i\nremember i\ni showed them to one of my uh\none of my colleagues and i was like you\nknow i was thinking about talking about\nsome of this stuff publicly and\nand i was like you know but i i'm not\nready to yet because i'm pretty sure i'm\ngoing to lose my job\nyou know at harvard and academic\nposition and he was like oh no no\nif you talk about this you're not going\nto just lose your academic position\nyou're going to lose\nall of your positions\nand so i was like oh okay interesting so\nyeah\ngotta make strategic moves um i know i\nknow we're probably nearing the end so i\ndon't want to keep you too long but\nthere's one last thing i want to touch\non i think yeah please\nand this is not related to this topic um\nbut i wanted to know\ni think oftentimes we talk about\ndepression and uh issues like that\naffecting us in the first person but i\nwanted to know what you think about\nhaving people around you that are\ndepressed like i have a someone who is\nalmost like a little brother uh going\nthrough i don't know i say it's\ndepression but\nclearly he according to him huge bounce\nof anxiety he has a hard time\nfunctioning in\ni as his friend um as somebody who loves\nhim i\nhave a hard time knowing how to help him\nin those situations or what i can't do\nbeyond listening\nbecause he feels i feel like he's so\ndeep in it you know and\njust to give you an idea like i'm\nconvinced i i i believe it's\nwholeheartedly like i'll get a call any\nday and just hear that he's gone you\nknow\nand as a friend it's kind of hard to\ndeal with that kind of powerlessness\nbecause i see him suffering and i just\ndon't know\nhow to manage that\nis that too much to ask at the end no i\nmean in a sense yes but\nit needs to be asked and it sounds\ncertainly important so\nask it um\ncan i just think for a second\nby all means\nwhat's it what's it like being in the\nposition you're in\nwhat's it like sort of trying to support\nhim and\nhim being kind of in a dark place\nto tile\nfutile because i know he has to take\nthose steps\nbut as someone who's watching the\nsuffering happening in front of them\nit's like uh\ndifficult what are the stuff he has to\ntake\ni i'm not sure i know i know how i\nfunction so i know how i can move\nforward\ni can't i don't want to impose my\nexperience or my way of viewing things\non him considering he might have a\ndifferent experience or\nmight have different needs you know so\njust so so i don't know what those steps\nare but i know that\nthere may be things that he has to\naccept or do things that i don't know\nyou feel powerless yeah i mean i think\nas a friend you always want to be able\nto lend a helping hand\nand and so you want to lend a helping\nhand what are you doing\naside from listening and checking in i\ndon't know what else to do you know i\nsay hey man if you need to talk what's\nyour\nwhat's the value of listening and\nchecking it checking in\ni think there's huge value in it i think\nit definitely helps people feel like\nthey matter in some sense i hope\ni think i think i'm worried it'll feel\nfutile or not enough\nif that person is gone\ndo you do what i'm saying yep i yeah\nso here's here's here's what i'm hearing\nthat you're doing okay\nyou're helping him understand that he\nmatters\nyour words right\nwhat do you think about that\nit it feels like the most i can do\nbecause i i've pondered it and i don't\nfeel\ni don't think i can do anything else\nyeah so i i think that\num i'm going to give you just a little\nbit of maybe additional stuff you can do\nbut i think the first thing to\nunderstand for people in your situation\nis that you are doing more way more than\nyou realize\nlike way way more and\nand the reason is because like so we\ntend to view\nour value like you know what you're\ndoing it just doesn't appear to be\nhelping\nright because it seems like he's not\ngetting better\nso the first thing to understand is that\nsometimes like if you look at\npsychiatric treatment like people will\nbe in psychiatric treatment for a year\nor two and they're not getting better\nand so one way to interpret that is that\nyou know we're not helping him because\ntreatment doesn't seem to be working\nbut the other thing that sometimes you\ndiscover is that your treatment is the\nonly thing that's keeping them afloat\nright so they're taking on a bunch of\nwater and you're baling it with a bucket\non a daily like weekly basis with\ntreatment so this is something that i\nsee very very commonly when friends ask\nme what more can i do the first thing is\nthat they almost universally\ngrossly underestimate the impact that\nthey're having\nso you're saying i can't i feel like i'm\nnot doing anything whereas my estimation\nis you're doing actually like eighty\npercent of it\nbecause i want you to imagine what it's\nlike to be in that person's shoes\nand be in such a dark spot and to have\none\nbeacon of pers someone who no matter\nwhat their mind tells them\nthere's one person in their life that is\nlistening to them and is\nis signaling to them you matter\nlike that's all a human being needs and\nwhen when people\nreally like kill themselves and stuff\nlike that what they lose is they lose\nthat last beacon\nit becomes completely dark\nright so so i i want to really emphasize\nthat like one beacon\nand i i've been you know once again\nanecdotal experience\nbut i've you know i've heard from people\nwho because you know i talk to people\nwho are deeply suicidal for long periods\nof time\nabout like what keeps them going and i\ncannot\ntell you how many times i've heard just\nthe most\nrandom things that seem so insignificant\nlike their cat\nright like what would happen to their\ncat if they died\nand that a lot of times like people will\nsay like this is the one person\nyou should go back i forget if it's the\nporn addiction stream or the burnt out\ngifted kids stream\nwe had a stream where some guy was\ntalking about like he was so close to\nsuicide\nexcept there was one random person on\nthe internet that they would like talk\nto every single day\nand like i remember we were joking at\nthe end of the stream about how like\nthat person is the hero\nand the thing is like that person is\nnever gonna know\nyeah right because you're just not gonna\nget that feedback\num and and this is where\nyou know i hate to break it to you but\ni'm very good at my job and i can't\nkeep someone alive right right so that\noutcome\nthere's another subtle thing that your\nmind is doing which is that\nif i do more i can prevent a particular\noutcome\nno you can't can you do more sure can\nyou do less\nsure but you can't your\nfear that you're gonna wake up one day\nand discover that he's gone is not\nsomething that you can actually control\nyou can be really good and believe me\ni'm really good and i've learned that\nlesson the hard way\nright right that as human being i\nfundamentally cannot control the actions\nof another human being no matter how\nmany years i spent studying in india and\nwhat institutions i've trained at\ni cannot keep someone from ending their\nlife\ni mean i can in sort of acute in\nspecific situations\nand i do have a good impact on it but at\nthe end of the day there's a certain\namount that you just can't do i think i\nunderstand that intellectually\nthese are things i know i think it's\njust coping with that reality that's\ndifficult\nyeah so that's where so i i get that you\nare so then i think that\nthis is where the conversation really\nbecomes a longer conversation because\nin the same way that some of these like\nviews around men's issues are tied to\nyour personal experiences\nthere may be something here about you\nknow when you were so alone\nand when you were so you know isolated\nand in a dark place that there may be\nsomething there that\nyou know may i i don't know i mean i\nthink there if it's\nif you want to understand it\nintellectually but you feel a particular\nway like there's an exploration process\naround those feelings that can lead us\nto some kind of\nunderstanding which will then like\ndecompress the feelings\nis it not possible that it's just a fear\nof the inevitable\ninevitability in the sense that like\nthis is someone i just care deeply about\nand i see them suffering and it and i\nwhat you said is 100 correct maybe\nmy impact is way higher than i'm\nestimating i could actually probably\nconcede that to you but i think it\ndoesn't\neven though i know that and i know i\ncan't have a white\nwhy do you think it's inevitable\njust just the way i hear him speak and\njust the way i hear him speak\nthere's a certain like era of\nhopelessness that that he has when he\nspeaks\nand sometimes it fades but then it comes\nback so strongly\nso and then he and then and then there's\nlike a disappearance yeah go ahead\nso you said the words we use matter\nright sure\nyeah so they matter the\nthe way we interpret words is based on\nour own experience\nright so if you're hearing his words\nwhy does your mind interpret that as\nhopelessness\nsee if you want to get to the bottom of\nthis that's where you have to go\nright because i i feel like i'm watching\nsomebody in the loop\nand the loop seems never ending like\nwhere they were at day one\nand day 95 seems exactly identical or\nprogressively getting worse\ndoes that seem possible how long has\nthis person been on this\nin this loop a few years a few years and\nso\na few years but i've watched it\nprogressively get worse and more intense\nand\nand this person has like reiterated the\nidea that it's getting more intense and\nis this person getting professional help\ni think they tried and\ndidn't like the experience so they quit\nso you know i've offered to\nto pay for it and whatever you know but\nit's one of those things where\nunless they take the olive branch i\ncan't force it on them so um\nsure but there are ways you can get them\nto take the olive branch so here are a\ncouple things you can do\nokay very practically all right so i\nknow like\ni think this is definitely a longer\ndiscussion but um let me try to at least\ngive you a couple things because this is\na question we get a lot how can i help\nsomeone\nso the first is i think you can share\nwith them\nhow you feel so you can tell them that\nyou know you\ni hear that you're getting worse i hear\nyou've been struggling with this\na long time i'm trying to be here for\nyou i want to support you\ni'm always here to listen and also i'm\nterrified\nthat one day i'm gonna wake up and\nyou're not gonna be here anymore\ncould i ask just one thing right there\ndoes that not place\nmore pressure on them yes\nyeah and is that a good or a bad thing\nit's a good thing okay so here's why\nso in relationships we have caregivers\nand caretakers\nright what are you in the relationship\nthe caregiver\nthe caretaker uh the caregiver i would\nassume\nand then they are the caretake caretaker\nso who's responsible for making things\nright\nuh\nhmm are they okay actually i i guess it\nwould be me yep yeah\nthat needs to change right yeah because\neven the framing of how you said it kind\nof threw me off a little bit but okay\nyep\nright so like like this is where because\nhe does\nso it's authentic can it be dangerous\nabsolutely can it pressure him more\nabsolutely\ncould it tip him over the edge\nabsolutely\nand this is a relationship you aren't\nhis doctor\nright you're his friend right and so one\nof the best things you can do for\nanother human being is let them take\ncare of you\nright like he has to understand that\nlike like this is the problem is it's\nall one way right now\nand he's got to understand that like he\nhe carries some of this weight in this\nrelationship\nyou can't carry it all on your own and\nit's healthy\nfor you to tell him like i don't want to\nwake up and not have you there\nthat day and so it's like his\nresponsibility to like\nalleviate that fear in you and is that\ngoing to put pressure on him\nabsolutely and so then you talk about\nthat\nand you even say i was afraid that if i\nshared this with you\nit would be like too much for you to\nhandle but i've been sitting with this\nfor a long time\nand like i'm i'm afraid\nand because you're my friend like i hope\ni can share this with you is it okay\nthat i shared it with you\nright so i think this is a real problem\nwith like mental illness i see this a\nlot as a psychiatrist is like\nspeaking of accountability too many\npsychiatrists take accountability away\nfrom their patients\nand it's not healthy it's how you create\na dependent patient\nand part of what i have to do is like\ngive that power back to them\nright like you have to give him you're\nsaying that the issue is he's powerless\nlike give him some of that power\nbut here's the problem if you give him\nthat power he could do something with it\nhe could do the wrong thing\nbut you're basically like you're\nsurrendering\nthat piece of the relationship to him\nand could it be too much\nfor him to handle absolutely but is it\nhealthy in the long run i think so\nyou know if you're really dealing with\nissues of suicidality and stuff i think\nwhat he really needs is professional\nhelp\nbut from uh from a more you know macro\nlevel like taking that kind of off the\ntable\ni want you and everyone else to\nunderstand that a lot of times the most\nimportant thing that you can do for\nsomeone is have faith in them to do it\nthemselves\nand sometimes that means like not\nprotecting them from it\nright because you're like so protective\nyou're like we talked about oh\nparental gatekeeping in here you are\nyeah because you're treating him like\nhe's frail but like it sounds to me like\nhe's actually incredibly strong that\nhe's been\nsinking further and further below water\nfor years and he's still around\nsounds incredibly resilient yeah\nbut you know i agree i think he's\nresilient i think he's dealt with so\nmuch and\nyou know me knowing his lifestyle i\nagree um\ni just worry that he gets to a point\nwhere enough becomes enough and he's\ntired of struggling you know\nand i can't tell somebody to keep\nsuffering but um\nso i think that that too is a reasonable\nthing for you to share with him that you\nsh you have that fear that enough is\nenough\nand then the more practical thing is i\nwould really talk to him about\nyou know asking about his experience of\nmental health treatment and and try to\nreally direct him that way because this\nis\nreally you know i i don't know exactly\nwhat the situation is but it sounds like\nyou're afraid and that he really needs\nhelp and so there's like\nyou know one bad experience doesn't you\nknow\nyeah it's like they're good burgers and\nthey're bad burgers you shouldn't write\noff all burgers based on just having one\nbad burger\ni agree i agree so that's really what i\nwould encourage him to do is to try to\nyou know try to understand what his\nnegative experience was and try to push\nhim in the right direction\nokay well that was uh wonderful advice\nand it's something i'll probably get to\nright\nprobably today so thank you for that\nyeah well thanks a lot for the\nconversation\nand you know i hope things work out well\nyeah and good luck to you and your\nfriend\nyeah again so thank you for doing this i\nhonestly mean a lot of people in my\ncommunity reached out when they heard i\nwas going to talk about\nthe last subject so um you just taken\nthe time to talk about that was good for\nme and\nfor other folks so i appreciate it oh i\nloved it man i i really enjoy talking to\nyou and i think it's you know\nyou move really fast in terms of like\nhaving a view and being able to sit with\nnew thoughts and different thoughts\nand so it's it's cool it's refreshing\nall right so thanks a lot you ever want\nto\nhit me up hit me up all right we'll do\nman take care\ncheers and who are we raiding chat\nwe are going to auto mod wants to ban\nthe phrase ligma but i'm going to\nallowed\nallow it"
