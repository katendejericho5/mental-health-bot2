    "transcript": "today's talk is really about anxiety but\nwhat i really love about it is there are\na few dimensions to this anxiety\nthe first is we can see how growing up\nin a particular environment\npredisposes your mind to anxiety the\nsecond element that we're going to dig\ninto\nis how using substances can sometimes\nexacerbate our anxiety\nor even sort of create particular\nsituations in our mind that\nfeel like anxiety but may actually have\na different diagnostic\nkind of perspective and then the last\nthing about today's video is sort of how\ndo we deal with anxiety and sort of\novercoming some of the hesitations that\npeople have\naround getting treatment so i really\nthought that chuck's\nchuck did a fantastic job um of\nof like touching on i really loved this\ndiscussion about anxiety\nbecause we talk about anxiety like it's\nmonolithic\nright like i have anxiety like you have\nanxiety we all have anxiety\nwhat is the treatment for anxiety like\nyou know in western medicine we\nyou know it's like you have anxiety\nperiod and we heard from chuck he's like\nyou know my doctor\ngives me this medicine and like because\ni have anxiety\nand and so it it like our system of\nmedicine we treat anxiety we don't treat\npeople\nbut what i really love about today's\ntalk is it's an exploration of where\nanxiety starts\nhow your upbringing brings you to\nanxiety\nhow substances can actually exacerbate\nthings\nor make things worse and then also how a\nlot of things that look like anxiety may\nbe a little bit more diagnostically\nnuanced\nand then finally about like how getting\ntreatment\nis important but what are the things\nthat can get in the way of you wanting\ntreatment\nand so all that kind of stuff is um\nyou know is fantastic so i think this is\nreally what like\nexplorations of anxiety look like where\ni want you guys to understand\nthat it's not just about a clinical\ndiagnosis\nand a medication it's about a whole\nspectrum\nof like origins of where you how you got\nto hear\nthinking about these other influences\nthat have compounded your anxiety over\ntime\nand how to approach it in a truly\nmulti-disciplinary manner\nventing that negative energy using\nmeditation taking medication\nseeking a therapist overcoming your\nfears that you kind of internally face\nhaving to face those fears deal with\nthose fears etcetera\nreally fantastic how's it going\ngood man how are you i kept me for a\nsecond\noh i'm good i'm good i appreciate you\nhaving me on thank you very much for\nthat\ndude i appreciate you coming on everyone\nis always so grateful that like we're\nhaving them on and i don't think you\nguys realize like\nwe wouldn't be anywhere without you i\nthink it's more so\nuh i'm sure there's a lot of people that\ncould you know be sitting here instead\nof me right now you know what i mean so\nstill got to be grateful yeah that's\nawesome man it's it's very positive of\nyou\nand and so are is your name c do\nuh yeah it's just like an abbreviation\nof my real name which is charles dolan\nyou know\num but yeah you can call me chuck\ncharles c dude\nit's all good okay chuck\nchuck yep that works mono syllable and\num\nokay so chuck is there something in\nparticular that you uh you know\nyou were thinking we could talk about\ntoday or maybe something that we could\nhelp you with\num i mean i guess i could uh\nkind of you know break down what i'm\ngoing through i don't like i don't\nreally\nlike talk about this so i'm not really\nsure like what i should be talking about\nor what you're interested in or\nwhat you can do to help me um\nbut you know basically i've been i've\nbeen dealing with like anxiety for a\nlong time\nand i would say it's gotten\nprogressively worse um it started to\nlike hit me\nreally bad when my wife was pregnant\nwith her first kid i don't know if it\nwas related\ni feel like subconsciously i guess it\nwould have to be related if that's like\nwhen it started getting bad but um\nbasically i'm like\nit's kind of weird like i'm actually\nlike afraid to have anxiety\nlike i think my my biggest fear is like\nhaving a panic attack because like one\ntime i had like a panic attack that\nlasted like\nwhat i would say was like an hour or\nsomething and i felt like i i wasn't in\ncontrol of my body like i felt like\ni felt like reality became like fake you\nknow what i mean\num it's kind of hard to explain so i\nfeel like that's like my biggest fear\nand like\ni feel like i'm constantly like\noverthinking and i just like\ni just have like um constant like\nchatter in my head like\nokay am i gonna have a panic attack okay\ni'm feeling nervous like\nlike the slightest thing like wow i feel\nlike a tingle like in my body\nlike oh my my heart is like beating\nfaster like\nyou know anything just kind of starts\nlike those\nthoughts that just don't ever stop if\nthat makes sense like it's just\ntrue most of the time i would say\nit's like an all-day thing but um you\nknow i kind of had like this uh\nthis thing on my stream a few days ago\nwhich you know kind of started\nyou know me reaching out and trying to\nmake like small improvements and uh\ni would say for the most part it's been\nbetter like you know\nsignificantly better and generally it is\nbetter i think i just had a\nstring of like really bad days but um\nyou know even then like when i'm feeling\nnormal like my brain is just so weird\ni'll be like\nwow i haven't thought about anxiety in a\nwhile oh\nnow i'm going to start thinking about it\nyou know it's like like i noticed myself\nfeeling good\nand then i start to question oh yeah i'm\nfeeling good your anxiety is like\nyou're not allowed to do that it doesn't\nstop it doesn't stop yeah\nwow dude it sounds heavy bro\ni mean you know um i i don't want to\ni guess oversell it like i feel like you\nknow\ni'm probably doing better than some\nother people that are dealing with this\nbecause i do\ni do do my daily things and you know i i\ntravel\ni go out and stuff like that but it's\ndefinitely\nsometimes i feel like it's harder to\nenjoy like living in the moment you know\nand\nit kind of makes me sad sometimes so\nyeah yeah\nabsolutely man how long have you been\nkind of carrying this around like\nhow long has this anxiety been with you\ni mean like i said i've had it\nat a young age i would probably well i\ndon't know how young is young but like\nmaybe like my mid teenage years like 16\nor something is like when i you know\nexperienced my first panic attack and\nthen uh it's probably been\npretty rough for like three ish years\nnow like you know my son's almost three\nand it was like while we were pregnant\nwith him so um i would say that's like\nwhen it started to get\nnot nearly as manageable like i actually\nhad to\nget like medicated for it because i was\nwaking up\nevery single day shaking like my my\nwhole day would be me like literally\nshaking\nand i i couldn't stop it and it was i\ncouldn't eat and i was\nyou know i was struggling really bad and\ni tried you know\nreally hard to not do that but like the\nmedication helped me so much that i was\nlike this this just had to be\nyou know the answer because i couldn't\nlive the way i was living\nabsolutely man so i'm glad that you got\nmental health treatment um because it\ncertainly sounds to me like this is like\na clinical case of anxiety\nand um i'm also kind of noticing\nso so can do you mind if i ask you a\ncouple of questions just about what kind\nof treatment you've tried in a little\nbit of your\ntreatment history sure\num yeah go ahead feel free to ask me\nanything yeah so so in\nthe so let me take a step back and\nexplain why i'm asking so usually we\nsteer clear of clinical topics on stream\nbecause this really isn't\nsupposed to be medical advice the reason\ni want to ask you a little bit about\nyour treatment history is because in my\nexperience\nas a psychiatrist there are some things\nthat have to do with\nclinical anxiety and there are actually\nnon-clinical solutions that we can learn\naround anxiety as well\nand i basically want to parse out how\nmuch of the clinical stuff has been done\nso that i know how to approach the\nnon-clinical stuff\nif that makes sense so i've got a couple\nof like basic questions for you okay\nyou don't have to answer anything\nbecause this is for your personal\nmedical history it's going to be like\nsuper high level stuff\nso it sounds like uh you're taking\nmedication now and that the medication\nhelps\nyeah okay um and it sounds like you\nstarted medication around the time that\nyour wife was pregnant\nokay have you tried psychotherapy or\nsomething besides medication\nno okay so that that's that's that's\nbasically all the questions i need to\nask\nbecause um that'll sort of help me\nunderstand like what to include and what\nnot to include and\nand kind of how we go from here sure um\nany particular reason you haven't tried\nuh psychotherapy\nhonestly um i would feel i would say\nlike\nuntil as of like recently um i kind of\nfeel like\ni just my thought process was like if i\njust kind of deal with this and like\ntry and forget about it it'll go away\nlike i didn't really like talking about\nit like this conversation actually is\nlike kind of like\nmaking me nervous a little bit but i'm\nhappy to be here and like\ni i also didn't really like want to go\nto a\nlike you know i guess a psychologist is\nthat\nbecause like i don't know i just\ni guess i guess it just made me a little\nbit nervous you know like it\nsure so let's start let's start because\nhe said that you have trouble being\npresent focused right so let's start in\nthe present so i noticed that when we\nstarted the conversation you were doing\nwell\nand then and then as especially when i\nasked you a little bit about your\ntreatment history you've started\ncrossing your arms\ni'm noticing you're feeling more nervous\nso tell me how you feel right now\ni mean i guess i i guess i feel a little\nbit nervous you know\ni'm okay you know i definitely make it\nthrough the conversation but\nyeah absolutely so so i want to just\npoint out that language because it's so\ninteresting right it's like\nyou're uh you play wow right yes\nso what i'm hearing is like you've got a\ncouple of dots on you and your hp is\nit's [ __ ] ticking down but you're\nlike you know i'll make it like i'm\nstill gonna wipe\nlike you know we're still gonna win the\nraid like we're running out of mana like\nthis boat is sinking but we're gonna\nmake it to shore\nthat's what i'm hearing from you which\nwhich is like\nit's a god-awful way to go through life\nfor sure yeah i don't disagree\nyou know so so i i think that our goal\nhere is not to make it through to some\nyou know it's like let's figure out how\nwe can\nyou know cleanse those dots right\nbecause what i want to help you with is\nlike to not\nhave to live this way it's not about\novercoming your anxiety to survive like\nthat's just not\nany way to live life right and i i can\nsee that\nyou've learned how to do that really\nwell actually really awesome and noble\nlike i'm sure that you're\nyou know your kid is grateful your\nfamily is grateful that you've learned\nhow to manage that anxiety but it's also\nlike\ni can see it kind of clawing away at you\nand you're sort of like keeping it at\nbay while you're trying to live your\nlife\nand you're sort of protecting your loved\nones from the impact of that anxiety\ndoes that make sense to you or resonate\nat all yeah it does\nhow do you feel right now uh\ni feel you know the same okay\ndid that do anything to your nervousness\nas you were listening to that\nnot necessarily i think it's kind of\nlike i think it like kind of plateaus\nyou know i mean okay so the most part\ntell me what\nwhat do you mean by nervousness um\nwhat do you experience right now\nuh i guess like i just kind of like if i\nfeel like weird in my own skin does that\nmake sense like\ni guess and then um\nmaybe that's kind of it i don't know\nlike i just\ni guess i like try and just do things\nlike like fiddle my hands and you know\nmove\nmove around a little bit um\ni don't know and this may sound so i'm\ngonna\nyou know see your weird statement and\nraise you\nin a weirder statement do you think that\nsometimes when you fiddle and stuff\nyou're trying to find your way back into\nyour own skin\ni'm not sure i feel like it's a way for\nme to just like\ndo something and i guess like just keep\nmy hands moving or\nokay i mean just like a like maybe like\na nervous tic or something like\ntapping your leg or you know like\nplaying with something in your hands\njust\njust to move around i guess okay are you\nhaving particular thoughts right now\nno i feel like for the most part\nunless like my mind is like running\nreally crazy\nwhen i'm like distracted i'm like\ngenerally okay\num and like i said you know since like\nthat those a few days ago\ni started like uh trying to eat better\nand trying to exercise a little bit i'm\nnot doing anything crazy and\nyou know some people recommended like 15\nminutes of you know deep breaths\nbefore and after you wake up and i've\nbeen doing that and i i kind of felt\nlike there was like immediate results\nlike i felt like my my uh my thought\nprocess slowed down quite a bit\nnot like in a i can't like function way\nbut like\nthe racing thoughts like definitely\nalmost went away immediately\nokay um like i had a string of\nexcuse me uh really bad days\nand uh where i just kind of felt like my\nwhole day i just couldn't\nlike enjoy anything except the fact that\nlike you're not gonna have a panic\nattack you're not gonna\nlike you're gonna be okay like you know\nthat just you know\nso that's what the racing thoughts are\nthey're kind of sometimes\nyou know that's definitely i would say\nlike the start of it\num you know sometimes it could get worse\nthan that um\nyou know i've always been like\nyeah what percentage of your anxiety is\nabout being anxious\na lot i would say i like i\nlike i told you like my my first panic\nattack was like\num like super like scary to me like\nto a traumatizing matter like i was you\nknow i thought i was gonna die\nand i was afraid that um\nyou know i was afraid that uh\ni would like potentially like i could\nlose my mind and never like be brought\nback to sanity\nand um i wouldn't you know i wouldn't be\nable to control myself and you know\nthere would be times where i'm driving\nlike what if i have a panic attack right\nnow do i just die\nlike you know like um\ngoing on flights and stuff like what if\ni have a panic attack on the plane\nyou know like what the hell is going to\nhappen like i can't get off like\nyou know chuck have you ever heard of\nthe term agoraphobia\nuh i'm recently started reading uh panic\nto power\nand i think it's been used in there a\nfew times do you have a\nhave they explained in the book or do\nyou remember in the book how they\ndescribe\nagoraphobia so i want to explain this\njust to educate people okay\nso um you know this is something that\nyou should consider talking to your\nyour your provider about but just to\nexplain to you kind of how this works\nso first of all what bro what you're\ndescribing is like completely normal\nin the sense that some people for\nwhatever reason and we can get to that\nin a second\nare kind of like when they create their\ncharacter they get the they get the\npanic or anxiety\ntrait and and so sometimes what happens\nis people who have panic attacks\nwill sometimes become agoraphobic and\nwhat agoraphobic means\nis fear of going outside so they stay\nhome and and sometimes in really severe\ncases they'll be\nyou know stuck in their home for years\nat a time sounds like\nyou've already you know i don't think\nthat's going to happen to you so because\nif\nif it was gonna happen it would have\nalready happened so i think you kind of\ndodged that bullet\nbut i think the reason that i bring up\nagoraphobia right now is because i think\nit illustrates a lot of what you're\ngoing through\nso the reason that people become\nagoraphobic is out of a fear\nof having a panic attack and being in an\nuncontrolled environment when they have\na panic attack\nso it's not like they literally like are\nafraid of the sun or the sky or other\npeople\nliterally if you talk to people who are\nagoraphobic and these are people who\nlike you know it's very hard for them to\nleave the house\nwhat they tell you is what if i have a\npanic attack\nin those kinds of places and they're so\nafraid of losing control\nin the outside like outside of their\nhome that they\nend up that fear becomes so powerful\nthat they never leave\nand there's also sort of like this\nagoraphobia light\nwhich is like when people are able to\nactually leave the home\nbut whenever they leave the home their\nmind is constantly\nscanning for like methods of escape\nlike what if i have a panic attack while\ni'm on a plane like what would i do\nwhat if i have a panic attack if i go to\na party like how am i gonna escape from\nthat situation if i start to lose\ncontrol\ndoes that do you have those kinds of\nthoughts\ni would say it's not like as bad as\nyou're describing it like the plain one\nis definitely\nuh you know a fear of mine for sure like\ni'm not afraid\nto fly i'm not afraid like the plane is\ngoing to crash like you know\nlike it's literally just like i'm afraid\ni'm gonna get uncomfortable on the plane\nand um you know i've definitely been in\nthat situation before\nwhere i i started to feel panic attack\ncoming on and i've i've gotten this like\nyou know even recently\nand although it scares the living crap\nout of me i just tell myself\nyou know shut up and take deep breaths\nand no one will even notice like you're\ngoing to be 100 fine\nand that's what happens like if i feel\nlike one coming on like i don't know\nexplain it like hits me\nand i'm like in shock for a second i'm\njust like\nand then i feel like a little bit tingly\nyou know i mean like i feel like a\nlittle bit tingly and then i'm i'm\nokay you know like that's just that's\njust it and um\nit's weird because i feel like um you\nknow i said about driving and stuff like\nsometimes\ni'll think about what happens and i'm\njust like doesn't matter you got to live\nyour life you know like\nif it happens you know worse worst case\nscenario pull over\nlike yep you'll be 100 fine like and\nit's never happened while driving before\nand\nso i'm noticing that there's like a\ndialogue in your head\noh 100 i talk to myself all the time\nhope that doesn't make me crazy\nnope doesn't it makes sense um\nso so uh chuck i'm going to lay out a\ncouple of options okay\nactually let me make a like one or two\nobservations so\num i i think today could be really good\nin terms of we can like discuss and i\ncan explain how are you feeling by the\nway\ni'm all right you know i would say just\nall right like\ni mean i could i could say i'm good but\nobviously like i am i am a little\nnervous i was a little nervous about uh\nuh coming on here in general like i said\nlike this isn't something i\ni've done ever like i i don't talk about\nthis really and i just kind of broke\ndown\nyou know a few days ago and you know\ni'll talk to my wife and stuff like she\nobviously knows but\nthis is obviously something i've never\ndone publicly before\num sounds like you haven't really done\nit much privately either\nno yeah i don't i don't what keeps you\nwhat keeps you from talking about it\ni would honestly say like i felt like my\nthought process was if i ignored it\nit'll go away and the more i talk about\nit the more real it is\nyou know like sure\nlike i don't i i literally don't like\ntalking about it like people would come\nin my chat and say like\nwhat are you going on dr k for and i\nlike don't even want to answer that\nquestion\neven though like i'm the one who did it\npublicly like and and how does it feel\nwhen they ask you that question i don't\ni don't even like\nlike saying the word anxiety or reading\nit or anything like it\nyou know because i feel like once i see\nit then i uh\nlike it doesn't stop in my brain you\nknow i mean like i could be completely\nfine and i see it and then i'm like oh\nshoot here we go you know like i just\ngotta think about it until it goes away\nyeah so i know this sounds kind of like\nthis is gonna be a weird question\num what do you think about\nthinking that if you ignore it it'll go\naway\num that's kind of like what i i guess\nlike what my philosophy was originally\nright like\nyeah why do you think you had that\nphilosophy\ni guess because in my younger years for\nthe most part it worked\ndoes that make sense excellent yeah good\nso so i'm really happy to hear you say\nthat chuck because a lot of people\nwho are listening may think that that's\na bad philosophy to have\nlike if you ignore problems they don't\ngo away but this is the first thing i\nwant you to understand\nif your mind is doing something there's\na damn good reason for it\nand so oddly enough i do think that\nignoring it will make it go away\nis actually an oddly effective strategy\nthat sort of worked for you\nbecause let's remember if we really\ntunnel down to i know it sounds really\nweird but\nif we really tunnel down into it what\nhappens if you open the door to your\nanxiety\nit kind of like pours out like it's\nabsolutely right\nso like ignoring it is your way of\nkeeping the door closed\nbecause one thing that we can listen to\nyou and if you really like if you just\nkind of think about it for a second\nthe anxiety gets out of your control so\neasily\nso it's like a bucking bronco that gets\nlike let loose in your house and then\nit's just like\njumping all over this place smashing\nfurniture\nand so really the only thing that you've\nlearned or not the only\nthe most effective thing that you have\nlearned so far is just to keep it\noutside of the house\nand and this is where i don't think that\nignoring it is really fair what i'd\nreally say is like\nnot letting it into your mind because\nwhat i'm hearing from you is that once\nit gets into your mind\nthere's racing thoughts there's thought\nloops you know one thought leads to\nanother leads to another leads to\nanother\nand then you like start having this\ndialogue with yourself and then that\nkind of like fuels your anxiety even\nfurther\nand sometimes you you win but i'd also\nventure that sometimes when you argue\nwith yourself the anxiety is kind of\nlike a punching bag\nwhere the harder you hit it the harder\nit swings back\nand so ignoring it is actually it's not\nreally like\nignoring it per se when this is where\nignoring really means\nnot letting it into your mind because if\nwe think about what is the word ignore\nmean\nit means the active process of\npreventing\nthoughts about something in your mind\nright\nso i think ignoring it is a fantastic\ntool\nin your arsenal of dealing with anxiety\nsecond thing i want to point out so then\nthere's this dialogue component where\nsometimes you fight with your anxiety\nand sometimes you win and sometimes you\nlose but the problem with fighting with\nyour anxiety is that oftentimes it fuels\nthe tension in your mind right and if we\nthink about it like the low\nanxiety states are actually states of\nlow energy in the mind\nwould you agree with that statement or\ndoes that make statement make sense with\nyou\nfor you um not exactly\nin terms of making sense okay so like\nwhen you're calm your mind is not\ndoing a whole lot and when you're\nanxious your mind is doing a ton\nand i would venture that when you fight\nagainst your anxiety the\ntotal amount of activity in the mind is\nincreasing\nand i would also venture that when the\ntotal amount of activity in the mind\nincreases\nyou get closer to anxiety okay\nand if you really think about it when\nyou succeed in fighting your anxiety\nand you stop and you take deep breaths\nwhat happens\nto the energy in your mind i guess it\nwould go down\nabsolutely right so the more energy in\nyour mind it's almost like there's like\nthis portal that is spawning anxious\nthoughts\nand the more energy you pump into the\nmind the more anxious thoughts it spawns\nand sometimes you actually like attack\nthe portal and you try to like\nyou know overcome it with willpower that\ncan actually make your anxiety worse\nand what actually works is stopping to\nfight it's just like\nzoning out right like you're just like i\ncan definitely agree with that\num yeah and and so if we think about it\nzoning out\nis also like ignoring like ignoring is\nnot letting\nnot zoning in the first place there's no\nzoning in there's no aggro\nand sometimes now what you've learned is\nlike okay like i don't want to zone in\nand now that like we're aggroed like\nlet's just zone out\nbecause sometimes you'll sit there and\nyou'll like you know you get aggro you\nstart tanking you start spamming all\nyour buttons and all your cooldowns\nand sometimes you win and sometimes you\nwipe but either way like even while\nyou're fighting that battle\nlife continues going on you know time to\nfeed your kid and put your kid to bed\nand here you are [ __ ]\nspamming your cooldowns trying to fight\nthat anxiety like in your head\nyou know no one else is aware but you're\nlike getting wiped in a raid\nyou know and so there's this really\ninteresting like principle of like\nenergy and anxiety where actually what\nwe want to do is\nunplug our mind and so this is where\nbreathing exercises can help\nthat's just kind of a point that i\nwanted to make i'm going to toss out a\ncouple different things\nand then you tell me what you want to\ntalk about okay\nnext thing that i want to point out is\nthat you know your problem is not the\nanxiety\nit is also your response to the anxiety\nso the anxiety is not something that you\ncontrol\nbut then you do something like half of\nyour panic is around\nthe fear of future anxiety it's not even\nlike the core anxiety\nso our mind does this thing where\nsometimes um\nyou know we have adaptations to\ncircumstances\nand then sometimes the adaptations\nactually end up hurting us more\nlike just to give you an example if i'm\ndepressed and i start drinking because\nit makes the feelings of depression\ngo away then that sort of works but like\nnow i've created a whole new problem\nso in your case i think there are two\narea two ways you can move forward one\nis you can move forward with the root of\nyour anxiety\nand the second is you can move forward\nwith the response to your anxiety\ndoes that make sense um\nare you going to like kind of go in\ndetail and like uh\nyeah go ahead yeah so like there's the\noriginal panic\nattack which you sort of can't control\nand then there's your fear there's\nalmost like the ptsd\nfrom the panic attack and what i'm\nsaying is that if we really look at it\nthose are like\ntwo separate issues\nand and so what i mean is that like you\ncan tackle both of those and your\nanxiety can get better by\npreventing the original panic attack or\nworking through that original panic\nattack\nbut also by like re-learning how to deal\nwith that\noriginal panic attack does that make\nsense\nyes okay and then kind of the last thing\nor two more things that we can kind of\ntouch on and i know it's kind of\nscattered when i'm kind of pointing out\ni'm gonna use the shotgun approach and\nthen you let me know like what you're\ninterested in okay\num so is that we can get to the origins\nso i can ask you like you know what was\ngoing on in your teenage years what was\nyour upbringing like\nwhat was your first panic attack like\nwhat happened when your wife got\npregnant\nand we can kind of you kind of say\nsubconsciously there has to be a\nconnection\nyou're right by the way and so we can\nkind of dig into that and maybe help you\nsee that connection if you want to a lot\nof people do that kind of stuff like\nthose are the kinds of conversations\nthat a lot of people\nbenefit from on stream but we don't have\nto do that and then the last thing that\nwe can talk about is like a little bit\nabout the physiology of\nanxiety and so almost like a\nneuroscience perspective like you're\nyou're using these phrases like i don't\nfeel like i'm in my own skin\nand like what is actually happening in\nyour body what is happening in your\nbrain\nto create these kinds of sensations of\nlike depersonalization\nwhere you feel like you're not in\nreality anymore and then that begs the\nquestion what is reality and what is you\nso there's sort of like this physiologic\nneuroscience like weirdly spiritual\nyou know like let's talk about the\nnature of the universe in existence\nmen so there's like kind of that tact\ntoo and i think these are all\nlike useful things to talk about it's\nkind of like\nwhat you were interested in um\nlet's see here um i\ni kind of i kind of feel like we should\ngo with the first one and\nit's gonna sound really weird but i feel\nlike that is the one that is gonna like\nmake me\nlike the most anxious to talk about\nbecause i like have only talked about it\nlike once or twice like\nyou know like um number one if you\nwanted to know more about like my\nchildhood i'm\nmore than happy to tell you but like the\nmanner and like how i had a panic attack\nand stuff like it kind of still scares\nme to this day\num so maybe like getting that out and\nlike having you\ntouch up on it would maybe make me feel\nbetter i don't know\nokay good so so beautiful\nso now chuck we're gonna be scientists\nokay we're gonna party up\nwe're gonna we're gonna be scientists so\ni want you to pay attention\nnotice your fear and wanting to talk\nabout it\nnotice that you're pushing yourself in\nspite of your fear\nand what i want you to keep track of\nbecause you're the only one that can do\nthis\nis notice what happens to your various\nthoughts and emotions\nas we talk about it so do things get\nbetter\ndo they get worse both are possibilities\ndo they feel the same\ndo some things get better and some\nthings feel relieving like all kinds of\nstuff okay\nso let's just see if it does help\nbecause maybe if it does help\nmaybe you sh you know we can talk a\nlittle bit about seeing a therapist\nmore long term okay sure so tell me\nabout your childhood bro\num where should i start\ni don't know what was growing up like um\ni'm sorry i guess\ni would um my my parents eventually\nended up getting divorced\num so i would say that that was not a\nvery good marriage\num it was actually like pretty openly\nbad like i feel like they would actually\nfight quite a bit\num it was my dad was like a little like\nocd crazy\nwhat does that mean like if if something\nwasn't like\ncompletely straight or not done his way\nlike it was a problem\nlike it was like um\nmaybe like military status like you know\nyou walk in the house she was off at the\ndoor if you leave your bedroom\nit has to be perfect we weren't allowed\nto sit on our beds unless it was bedtime\num so we would literally watch tv in our\nrooms on the floor um\nif we were to leave our house we would\nhave to have bedroom checks\nto like make sure it was straight enough\nin order for us to be able to leave\num there would be times where like we\nwould eat dinner\nand if i wasn't eating fast enough like\nif i didn't like\nfinish my food by a certain time i would\nhave to go to bed like my dad would like\nput a timer on\num before i say all this i should\nprobably say i actually have a good\nrelationship with my dad now like i know\nthat you know when he was younger he was\nkind of like i don't want to say crazy\nbut you know he was a little\nhis methods probably weren't the best\nfor parenting sure sure but\nyou know we're definitely uh we're\ndefinitely past that\nokay but i would say you know my sister\nand i probably favored my mom\nlike my dad would go away for work and\nwe would always be like pretty happy\nwhen he was gone\nwe would stay up late and you know\num yeah do you remember what it\nfelt like like when you were eating your\nfood\ni didn't like it i was i was like there\nwas i actually this thing\nfor a long time where i wouldn't eat the\nlast bite of my food\nlike it was like i don't know why\nbecause i feel like\ni i think one time i like overeat and\nthrew up but like i don't know i there\nwas\nfor a long time i wouldn't eat the last\nbite of my food\nbecause i felt like uh maybe i would\nthrow up or maybe\ni'd like since i wasn't being forced to\ni didn't have to i don't know but i just\ni do remember that was like a part of\nlike a mindset for a while\nokay so\num can i ask you a couple more questions\nyeah for sure\ni'm gonna need a second to try to find\nthe right question is that okay\nwhat was it like growing up with a dad\nlike that\ni mean for me it was normal i guess like\ni didn't i didn't\nreally think much of it at the time\num i definitely spent like a lot of time\nat friends houses like\ni would almost say like a few of my\nfriends parents like would have like\nliterally adopted me or considered me\ntheir kid at the time like i would i\nwould be there all the time i had like a\nbunch of different friends where i would\nbe there non-stop stay over nonstop\nalmost every single weekend i probably\nnever stayed home wow\nnot even because like i didn't want to\nbe home but because i enjoyed like you\nknow i would say my other friend's house\nis like way more\nlike more gym yeah what did you enjoy\nabout being there\ni mean probably spending time with my\nfriends more freedom\nin general um you know i just felt like\nwe got to do a lot more\nlike my house was like always really\nstrict when my dad was home\num and i wouldn't say it was very fun\nyeah\num and i actually remember one time\nspecifically this is probably like a\nlittle off topic and completely random\nbut my mom came home with like a\nvideo game for computers called mech\nwars\nand my dad made her go back to the store\nand take it back and specifically said\ncomputers are not\nmeant for video games and i still i\nstill give them hell for that comment to\nthis day because i'm like that's how i\nmake my living now but\nyeah you know so sometimes i would go to\nmy friends houses and play computer\ngames\nand what do you do you remember how you\nfelt when your dad made your mom do that\nprobably pretty sad i was like damn that\ngame looks super awesome\nand it's funny because i would play\nvideo games on my computer all the time\nbut it was just like pinball and stuff\nlike that\nand this came with the computer and i\ndon't think he knew\nyeah so it sounds like there were you\nknow\nand what did they fight about\neverything i can't remember specific\narguments but they just did not\nget along very well when i was in eighth\ngrade\nokay when you were 13 yeah just about\nyeah when was your first panic attack\nlike 16 okay but i i will say and like\nthis is uh\nthis is um you know maybe not relevant\nbut like\ni experienced my first panic attack when\ni was smoking weed\nso it's actually very relevant\nokay we can talk about that too um\nso uh\ni'm gonna just i'm trying to figure out\nhow to\ngoose step around this but i just gonna\ncome out so it sounds like you know you\ngrew up in a household that breeds\nanxious kids\npotentially i mean my my mom dealt with\nuh\npretty bad anxiety my sister deals with\nanxiety depression\nand uh i deal with anxiety so it's you\nknow\npossibly pass down as well but yeah so\nsure there's a hereditary component so\nthere's a really interesting study\nkind of bizarre so they take kids who\nare anxious\nand parents who are anxious and what\nthey actually do is give anxiety\nmedication to the parents and then the\nkids anxiety goes down\ninteresting gets almost the same\ntherapeutic benefit as medicating the\nkid\nand and it's really weird but like\nanxiety is sort of you know\nkids are very attuned to their parents\nand so like when the parent is anxious\nlike imagine you're six years old and\nlike your mom is like\nfreaking out right like what like the\nkid is gonna be like\nwhat's wrong i'm freaking out i don't\nunderstand what's going on but i can\ntell it's bad\nit's a really fascinating study but what\ni'm kind of really noticing is that like\nif we think about anxiety what i think\nabout\nas of anxiety is like anticipation of\ndanger\nso if you really think about you know i\nknow it sounds kind of like a weird\nquestion but\nwhy do human beings get anxious like why\nlike but we have parts of our brain that\nmake us anxious and why does our brain\ndo that and it's because anxiety is\nactually a protective mechanism\nso our brain's capacity to anticipate\ndanger actually protects us\nand what i'm actually noticing is that\nyour house was sort of a dangerous place\nlike if you sit on the bed like you got\nlike you like you know i don't i mean\nthis may be so booked into you\nbut like you know i can't imagine what\nit's like to\nlive in a house where like if you sit in\nyour bed like what would your dad do\nit wouldn't like hurt us but we'd\nprobably get yelled at and right\nto go up on that even more like i know i\nknow everything that i dealt with\nas a kid was obviously very strange and\ni'm i'm like pretty close with my wife\nand her dad and like we kind of like\nyou know we talk about it and laugh\nabout it and like when we're at family\ndinners like\ni tell my dad the crazy stuff he did\nhe's like that never happened\nyou know you know we laugh about it but\num\nhe says that never happened doesn't\nbother me because me and my sister know\nit was true you know we don't\nwe're not making this stuff up um but\nwhen\nwe were like living there like we were\nonly allowed to eat at like designated\neat times\nand i mean like there was breakfast\nlunch and dinner and there was no in\nbetween\nand we would we would literally sneak\nsnacks\num and because we'd be hungry and like\neventually when my parents got divorced\num i lived my dad for the first year and\ni didn't like it because my mom and my\nsister weren't there\nso i ended up living my mom and\neventually my dad found like all these\nhidden like snack wrappers and trash\nin my closet because if we threw him in\nthe trash you would see him\nlike legit and i remember going to bed\nhungry and i would have to\nlike tell my mom like i'm hungry and she\nwould have to sneak me food\nlike she would literally sneak me like\nham and cheese and stuff like in my bed\njust so i wouldn't go to bed hungry\ndo you remember how you felt when you\nwere hungry and she was doing that\nno like i said i didn't i just thought\nmy dad was super strict\nand you know my mom wasn't strict like\nthat was my thought process it wasn't\nlike\nmy dad is a horrible human being and\npeople are probably thinking that and i\ndon't really want them to think that\nyou know looking back at it he was\ndefinitely kind of a dick but\ni don't know if it's how he was you know\nraised and whatnot\nmy grandpa was like the nicest guy on\nearth by the way so i don't know\ni don't know if that's where he got it\nfrom but\nyeah so um i want to just say a couple\nof things so first\nis that you know sometimes when people\ncome on stream and they share\nlike things from their upbringing like\nthey can paint their parents to be in a\nreally bad light\nand that's not really what we're here\nfor oh yeah\nand and so i think it's like especially\nas children\nyou know i'm sure your dad did all kinds\nof awesome stuff too we're just not\ntalking about it\nit actually sounds like or maybe not\nmaybe\ni mean he used to play baseball with me\nand take me to my games and stuff like\nthat but\nyeah i mean there was probably some\nthere's probably some\nyou know awesome stuff in there all\nright so let's just\nlet's you know we're not we're not here\nto bash your dad and at the same time i\nthink it's really important\nto not let protecting\na parent get in the way of your\nauthentic experience of growing right\nyeah\nright um but i mean i i\nthis is gonna sound kind of weird chuck\nbut like you know you kind of grew up in\na [ __ ] up household bro\ni've i've gotten that before right and\nand so i think the the important thing\nthere is that like i could imagine\nlike i could just imagine like when i\nput myself in your shoes like having\nyou know it sounds like and i i don't i\nknow this is gonna make your dad\nsound like in a bad light but it\nactually like reminds me like i've\nworked with some people who are like\nholocaust survivors and like they're\nlike you know they're being snuck\nfood like living in like they're like in\na closet\nand someone has to like sneak them food\nyou know like being snuck food is like\nit's just not a common experience\nyeah as as a father i couldn't imagine\nlike my kid you know\nsaying he's hungry and i'm like no go to\nbed like it's not time to eat like\nit's like absolutely right and and so\nthe other interesting thing is like\nwhat i'm hearing from you chuck is that\nthe anxiety is like baked into you\npossibly yeah and the interesting thing\nis if you really think about it like\nwhat would happen\nif your dad caught your mom sneaking you\nham and cheese\ni don't know if i yelled her right so\nin that and so the tricky thing here is\nthat i'm asking you how you felt\nbut i think it was so normalized to be\nanxious\nand then just let's not even talk let's\nseparate the emotion from it for a\nsecond\nit was such a normal part of your\nthought process\nto anticipate danger and to be in danger\nwhat do you think about that it's just\nlike it's just how the household worked\nright it's like\nnow i'm home dad can't see me playing\nping pong\ngotta gotta be not anxious i gotta\nanticipate that danger\ndad can't see me sit on my bed oh crap i\nthrew my book on my bed i better\nclean it up before dad sees the\nimpression of the weight of the book on\nmy bed\nif i eat too fast i'm gonna puke if i\neat too slow\ni'm not gonna get to eat there's like\ndanger anticipation like\neverywhere you look in the household\npossibly\ncreated like a lot of my overthinking\npotentially like i wouldn't say that i\nhad like anxious thoughts back then\nbut it's maybe uh helped like\nform the way that i think today and if\nthat makes sense absolutely\ni think it makes a lot of sense i think\nthe way that you think today\nis a survival adaptation from how you\ngrew up\nwhat do you think about that it's very\npossible yeah\nright so like your anxiety isn't an\nenemy\nit's just like when i'm you know so this\nis how our mind works it's kind of like\ncement\nso like the early changes in our mind\nmind solidify later in time it's like\nwhy\nif you think about like learning how to\nwalk do you know how to walk\ni think so yeah how solidly do you know\nhow to walk\nsome people say not very well since i\nwalk on my toes\nbut i get i get from a to b yeah right\nso\nso when we think about it like so much\nfundamental programming is laid down\nlike our capacity for language\nour capacity to understand what what do\nyou do with your face right now\nwhat is that what do we call that\ni think i'm just smiling yeah but what\nis that how did you how did you learn\nhow to do that\ni think it's just programmed yeah right\nit's so baked in\nyeah and so what i'm noticing is that\nearly on\nbecause here's the thing those are just\nthe things that you remember and it\nsounds like your dad has gotten better\nover time\nyeah he's all right now right so like i\ndon't even know like what he did\nwhen you you know pooped your pants when\nyou were one\nhonestly he comes over and he sees my\nkids\nand like i'm convinced he didn't have\nkids\nbecause this guy is you know like i love\nmy dad but he doesn't know how to talk\nto him he doesn't know how to hold him\nhe doesn't know how to like it's just\nlike\nhey you guys are my grandkids you're\nawesome but it's like\nyou know yeah so it looks like he has no\nidea what's going on\ni'm gonna assume that my mom took care\nof everything so chuck i'm gonna ask you\na question\nwhat would it be like you have a son i\nhave two sons actually\noh oh so you have two sons what would it\nbe\nlike for them if they\nnever interacted with their dad or their\ndad never took care of them\ni think they would be pretty sad i'm\npretty awesome\nyou certainly love that i don't i don't\nthink they would be sad because they\nwouldn't know\noh right well i feel like now you're\nthrowing shade at me no i'm just kidding\nno no but i'm saying i'm saying like\nlike so so this is\ni think for you there were a lot of\nthings that i think you missed out on\nthat you don't even realize you missed\nout on because but you certainly miss\nout like it would be\nit they wouldn't be sad it would be sad\nfor them right does that make sense\nyeah and like um like i said my my\nwife's dad comes here a lot\num and we talk about stories of like\nwhat they did with\nas like kids and what he did for them\nand i'm like they'd be like yeah you\nnever do this and i'm like\nno you know so definitely\ni'm very aware you know the childhood i\nhad\nright it's kind of weird because it's\nnot even like you you sort of know\nintellectually you missed out but like\nyou didn't miss out\nkind of emotionally because it was just\nnormal for you\nbut i am noticing that there's a you\nknow there's a lot of evidence that\nyour mind learned how to anticipate\ndanger\nand that you were kind of like a home\nbase your place of safety required a lot\nof vigilance\nso here's another term that i'm going to\ntoss out which i think describes your\nanxiety very well\nhyper vigilance what do you think\nso vigilance means you know to be\nwatchful\nand hyper is to be like constantly\nwatchful constantly on guard\ndo you think that describes what happens\nin your mind\nuh possibly possibly i still kind of\nfeel like\ni mean i guess i'm constantly on guard\nof like my own emotions\nper se like you know not necessarily\nlike my environment and stuff like\ni'm generally pretty easygoing like i\nwould say like my wife is like\nway more like you know what's going on\naround me you know what's this what's\nthat\ni'm just constantly on guard like okay i\ndon't want to have a panic attack right\nnow like you know\nyeah that's like so i'm noticing that\nthe guard is internal instead of\nexternal\nlike you're manning the walls of your\nown mind to make sure that the bucking\nbronco doesn't get in\n[Music]\num how did it feel to talk about your\nupbringing\nhonestly it doesn't it doesn't really\nbother me too much like that wasn't the\nthing that i was actually too nervous\nabout because i i've talked about it\nbefore\nlike you know even on stream maybe not\ntoo often you know i've talked about\nlike my friends obviously you know knew\nme and kind of knew my dad was a little\ncrazy and my wife and every i actually\njust think it's funny at this point\nyou know okay okay um so i would i would\nsay things didn't necessarily get better\nbut they also didn't get worse you know\nokay\nokay so it sounds like and what's your\nunderstanding of why you're smiling\nright now\nbecause i i just think it's funny like\nokay yeah this is\nyeah i guess you either laugh or cry and\nuh yep\nyeah i just i don't know i've told these\nstories a thousand times like at this\npoint like i i really do\nthink they're kind of funny have you\ncried about them\nmaybe i if if i did i couldn't remember\nokay\ni doubt i did but yeah and so it sounds\nlike you were\nvery nervous about sharing something\nelse can you help us understand what\nthat is we don't necessarily have to\nshare it i'm just curious what we're\ndoing\ni'm okay to share it um but like the way\ni like experience my first panic attack\nand stuff like\nit's just it's scary it's you know i i\nremember it so\nso vividly and uh you know exactly what\nwas going on in my brain and just like\nit was just a lot\nit's a lot i think like that's like my\nmy fear to like get back to that place i\nguess\nare you afraid that if we talk about it\nyou'll let the bucking bronco back into\nyour mind\nnot necessarily because i feel like um i\ni have talked about it before\num but i was like definitely in a better\nmind state and if that makes sense like\nso\nthis is this is the series of events\nthat happen like my sister growing up\nlike\nkind of i think she dealt with our our\nchildhood differently like she kind of\nlike you know did smoke and did drink at\na younger age and stuff like that\nand i saw that and i didn't really like\nwant to be a part of that\nand um you know like my friends smoked\nand stuff and i i just didn't care like\nmy friends would drink i didn't want to\nmy friends would smoke and i didn't want\nto\nand one day one of my friends convinced\nme to smoke and we smoked it was chill\nand then he convinced me again\nand i had like that really terrible\nexperience which i can get to\ninto into more detail and you know i\njust kind of chalked it up as like wow\nlike that was bad they're like yeah you\nknow you had a tough time you know it's\nwhatever\nbut it didn't really affect me you know\ni mean it didn't affect me and then i\ntried smoking again it was fine and i\ntried smoking again and then that's when\nthat's when the problems occurred it was\nthe fourth time and i remember\nwhat happened was like i started\nexperiencing like what i experienced the\nfirst time\nand i was in someone's house and i went\noutside and i sat there in the freezing\ncold\nshivering like you know for like an hour\nlike\nand it didn't take control of me like it\ndid the first time\nbut like it kept feeling like it was and\nbut i remember during that time having\nthe thought process what is this what if\nthis never goes away\nand as soon as that thought went into my\nmind\ni've had to deal with it forever and i\nremember like you know the next few days\ngoing out\nlike like just being in random people's\ncar things that i never would have\nthought about before like what if i have\na panic attack right now\nyou know and then um for like a week it\nwent away\nlike completely and i mean like not even\nit wasn't even thought in my mind and i\nremember\nyou know i don't i don't know what\ncaused it but i just remember that\nmorning like i would\ni was over at my friend's house we\nstayed up all morning we were playing\nbasketball in the morning\nand later that night we went to a movie\ntheater and someone in the movie theater\ncame up to me\nthey're like you're cedu and i lost it\ncompletely lost it like i i felt all\nthose feelings coming back i don't know\nif i was in shock or what i\ni i ran out of the movie theater and i\nwas crying i had to get my sister picked\nme up and\nyou know ever since then like it was\nalways a\nthought in my mind like almost i would\nsay almost\nevery single day like there was a\nthought in my mind that i might have a\npanic attack\nlike since that that day what when you\nsaid the feelings came up what what does\nthat mean\nhow do i explain it it feels like it\nalmost feels like\ni'm like i'm like looking at things\nthrough my mind not my eyes like i i\ni'm experiencing things around me like\nit just it feels like\neverything stops and i could explain to\nyou like what happens like\nwhat happened in my first panic attack\nbut um when i feel like i'm having a\npanic attack it feels like everything\nstops like\nand in my original panic attack i froze\nlike and i felt like you know it wasn't\nreality but so i remember\nvery specifically my first panic attack\ni was eating bacon cheddar cheese fries\nthey were one of my favorite meals\nand i remember swallowing one and\nmy mind envisioned it going down my\nthroat like i could see it today\nlike you know i mean things that don't\neven make sense and i remember\nsitting up and i said oh my god i'm\ngonna die\nand my friend my friend immediately\nlike reacted to that like what what what\ndon't say that don't say that like\nand that scared me even more and i\nremember like freaking out saying like\noh my god i'm gonna die i'm gonna die\nand i had bunk beds and i started\npunching my bunk beds as hard as i could\nbecause i i didn't feel\nlike you know i wanted to feel something\nand then i remember like\nliterally like standing up like hovered\nover like this\nand i don't know why but this was my\nthought process\ni was i was on trial for life and death\nand i remember\nbeing on a stage and having a full\naudience around me and i had to plea my\ncase why i shouldn't die today\nand i was literally pleading like you\nknow what like there's a school\ngirl i really like in school like i\nnever talked to her i swear i'm gonna\ntalk to her like\nand i was trying to beg to not die\nlike that was my that was my first panic\nattack and\nyou know i just i can still like\nremember everything around me and like\nclearly um yeah it was it was pretty bad\nit was pretty bad and then um you know\neventually i kind of like\nsnapped out of it i would say and i like\ntook a cold shower and i remember like\nsome of the feelings coming back on in\nthe shower where like\nyou know it felt like i was kind of like\ngetting like sucked in again almost and\nthen i would just be like nope i'm fine\nlike you're gonna be good\nbut that was my first panic attack and\nit was uh that's what i'm afraid of i\nguess is like losing full control to\nwhere like\ni felt like i couldn't move like i don't\nlike i swear i felt like i was stoned\nlike i couldn't move like i was just\nstuck in place\nhave you talked to you the person who\nprescribes your medication about this\nno i don't know if i necessarily like\nthat guy\ni told him like my anxieties about\nanxiety he's like no it's not i'm like\nokay you just don't really want to\nlisten you just want to prescribe\nmedicine like\nwait when he said your anxiety is about\nanxiety and he said no it's not yeah it\ndidn't\nyeah like you know i'm i'm not\ni don't really think he's like the\nperson for me to talk to okay i mean\nokay i think he just prescribes medicine\nand you know he's like no\nno it's not like there's there's there's\na different route and i'm like\nyou know i think about this stuff a lot\nand i kind of feel like i know what the\nroute is\nbut what's the route i kind of feel like\nthat was the route right there i feel\nlike that was damn right it is\nyeah i feel like that was the day that\nlike you know like i always tell myself\ni wish i never smoked weed and\nyou know but i feel like eventually i\nwould have dealt with this problem\nanyway\nbecause it's it's happened before\nwithout smoking you know\nnot not to that extent but can i think\nfor a second\nyeah take your time\nso um chuck i i want to just acknowledge\nsomething for a second so i think that\nlike what i'm about to say\nis it's still sort of\nfor educational purposes but it's gonna\nuse a lot of diagnostic language\nand i would really hesitate to say this\nfor a couple of reasons\nthe main reason that i'm i'm gonna offer\nto share something in a moment\nis because you do have a provider and i\nthink that ultimately\nour goal here on stream is to try to\nlike help you\nright so i want to share sort of a\ndifferent perspective based on some of\nthe attributes that you're sharing\nwhich i definitely think you should\nfollow up with a medical professional\nthink about it and follow up with a\nmedical professional\nand and because you know we don't really\ndiagnose or treat things on stream but i\nfeel like i have an ethical\nresponsibility to share with you another\nperspective\nfor looking at your anxiety\num is that okay yeah\nso what you're describing to me because\nyou were smoking marijuana so like\nsometimes when people\nso now we're gonna go real general okay\nand i want you to just kind of think\nabout this and figure out whether this\nis\nyou know applies to you or not you know\nin a different scenario if you were\nactually my patient i would tunnel down\ninto this more\nand i think it's a useful thing for you\nto tunnel down with a provider\nunfortunately i can't do it that with\nyou\nbut i feel like i would be honestly\ndoing you an ethical disservice if i at\nleast didn't float this idea and give\nyou the opportunity\nto talk to a licensed professional about\nit is that okay\nyeah yeah definitely so when we smoke\nmarijuana\nmarijuana actually has two kind of\ncomponents\none is sort of a pro-psychotic component\nand one is an antipsychotic component\nand there's a there's a version of\nmarijuana called k2 which is synthetic\nmarijuana\nand the problem with synthetic marijuana\nis that if normal marijuana has like thc\nand cbd and has a bunch of other\ncompounds\nbut basically depending on the blend of\nthc and cbd\nit has a certain propensity to like\nbecause you know like pot makes people\nparanoid right\nso some of that paranoia is kind of like\nmore in line with psychosis\nand and so it when people use synthetic\nk2\nthe problem with k2 it like makes people\nlike really freaking psychotic and they\nget\nyou know brought to the er really steer\nclear of k2 and\nin general marijuana as well um\nbut what i'm really hearing from you\ndoesn't sound like a panic attack it\nsounds like sort of like more like a bad\ntrip does that make sense\nyes and so sometimes what happens with\npeople who have bad trips\nis not that they have anxiety so we call\nit anxiety\nbut what i'm almost hearing is like a\ntraumatic experience from a bad trip\nand really what i'm hearing sounds to me\nlike i think you need a\nfar more thorough kind of diagnostic\nwith someone who listens\nso like what we're dealing with may be\nan anxiety disorder\nnot really our place to determine here\nbut could also be ptsd from\na bad trip and this is where sometimes\nfrom a treatment perspective it's really\nimportant to have a clinician who\nlistens to you\nbecause the treatments are actually\nquite different\nand and i don't know that you're ever\nlike like approaching it as an anxiety\ndisorder and approaching it\nas ptsd from a bad trip are gonna like\nhelp you\napproach it in different ways and may\nactually help you\nand if you're not getting better and\nthis is also just general principles now\nokay\nso if you're working with a psychiatric\nprovider and you're not getting better\nto your satisfaction i strongly\nencourage\neveryone out there to bring up your\ndissatisfaction with the psychiatric\nprovider\nbecause a lot of times this is you know\nnot really specific to you really at\nthis point but\na lot of times like you know as a\npsychiatric provider\ni ask you how's the medication working\nand most people like\nit's working some you know it's not\nperfect but it seems to be doing a good\njob\nand then as a clinician i don't know if\nthat's just like your anxiety is so\nsevere and we're kind of like okay with\nthis\nor if what i should do as a clinician is\nsit down and rethink your diagnosis\nthat may be a different kind of like why\nare we wiping on the raid\nyou know is it like is it that you know\nwe're we're hitting the dps or are we\nmessing up at the dps race\nor is it that our comp is messed up or\nlike there are all kinds of differential\ndiagnoses\nfor why the rate is not succeeding and\nsometimes\nthat involves like just further anxiety\ntreatment\nbut if we start to treat your anxiety\ndouble down on anxiety treatment when\nwhat you really have is\nptsd related to like uh like a psychotic\nhallucinatory experience\nthose are different things and they can\nboth look\nlike anxiety but this is where you know\nout of\neveryone that i've ever talked to on\nstream i would encourage you\nthe most to go and really get like\nre-evaluated or have a really good\nin-depth conversation\nwith a licensed mental health\nprofessional about your situation\nand i would share this stuff with them\nbecause in a sense it's not their\nfault it\nyou know you can't hold them accountable\nif you're not sharing\ninformation so i would really go and\nshare this experience\nand then kind of like you know find\nsomeone that you like and you trust\nand then really kind of get a good like\nthorough diagnostic evaluation which\nsometimes can take hours\nso can happen over the course of weeks\nand things like that but what i'm\nhearing right now\njust really makes me concerned that you\nknow what we're talking about is like\nyou know this intense moment where you\nwere like\nin this courtroom like that's like\ndivorced from reality\nright like that wasn't actually\nhappening and this is what's kind of\ninteresting is when people have like\nhallucinations and stuff when they use\nsubstances it\nfeels real and the impact on your brain\neven if it's not real your brain\nexperiences it does that make sense\ndefinitely yeah and so the effects on\nyour neurochemistry\nin the way that your brain wires are as\nif it's real\nand this also gets into a whole other\nthing about like what is the nature of\nreality and dreams and all this kind of\ncrap\nwe had a good conversation with ludwig\nabout it that if you want to go back and\nwatch like it may give you some insight\ninto this\nbut at this point i just want to check\nin with you what do you think about\nwhat we're talking about chuck in\nregards to what like just like this\nconversation\nlike how do you feel about where we are\ni mean i guess i feel okay\ni wouldn't i wouldn't say i i feel like\nany type of way about it\num i would say like i was definitely a\nlittle nervous to share\nlike what i went through i'm not really\nsure why but\num you know didn't it didn't really like\nyou know because i i thought i've been\nthinking about this for like the whole\nweek like you know is he gonna ask me\nlike how i experienced my first panic\nattack and stuff like that\nand then you know my brain kind of goes\ndown the road of like you know thinking\nabout him like oh crap i don't really\nwant to think about this you know but\num i don't know and i definitely um\ni definitely kind of agree with you i i\ndo think to a certain extent\ni do have anxiety because um\ni just kind of do feel like i deal with\nevery everyday stress and stuff and i do\nthink the medication is helping me\num but in the same sense i do think that\nlike i do have that like trauma of like\nthat's not where i want to get back to\nlike that's yeah that's there's a living\ncrap out of me\nyeah so so just so you understand like\nyou know this hyper vigilance that i\nreferenced earlier is really a feature\nof ptsd\nso like what happens if you think about\na traumatic event\nlike you know if i've been sexually\nassaulted in a parking lot\nlike i'm going to steer like i never\nwant to be in a parking lot at night\nagain like i will come hell or high\nwater i will avoid that situation at all\ncosts\nand what i'm really like so early on\nwhen i mentioned agoraphobia to you\nremember like\nagoraphobia is about avoidance\nit's all about avoidance and what i'm\nhearing when we talk about the bucking\nbronco\nand ignoring your thoughts it's about\navoidance avoidance avoidance\nso could this be an anxiety disorder\nabsolutely could this be\nuh like you know hallucinator like a\nmarijuana-induced ptsd\nabsolutely and that's something where i\nthink really like you deserve\nto have someone a licensed mental health\nprofessional sit down with you and\nreally talk through that\num do you what was it like to actually\nshare that experience\nit was all right i mean i've shared it\nbefore to people\nuh who are close to me obviously like\nyou know i was with my friend at the\ntime\nyou know during it um but i mean yeah\nwell i guess it wasn't as bad as i\nthought it was gonna be\nlike i feel like i'm kind of relaxed\nright now for the most part\nwhat do you mean by relaxed do you mean\nyour baseline level of anxiety\nor do you mean relaxed\ni guess in these days it's kind of hard\nto tell a difference\nbecause i kind of feel like it's always\nthere yeah i understand that so like i\nwant to just point something out to you\nyou've never used the word\nrelaxed today\nso like i think that that's the right\nword i think you actually\nare somewhat relaxed and the reason that\ni think you should see a therapist is\nbecause this is how therapy works\nright right so like when you share the\nthoughts that you have inside\nyou know remember how we talked about\nand this isn't\nnot there are many ways to do this but i\nwant to just explain this principle of\nthe mind\nwhich is remember we were talking about\nwhen you add energy to the mind\nthe anxiety gets worse so one of the\nways that we can vent\nenergy from the mind is through things\nlike therapy\nbut essentially what you're doing is\nletting that excess energy out\nso like their thoughts and i don't know\nif this makes sense this is really more\nlike a yogic\nperspective so you can journal for\nexample or you could do therapy\nor you could share it with a friend the\npoint is that you want to vent because\nright now what happens when you have\nthoughts\nis they just bounce around in your head\nand they have nowhere to go\ndoes that make sense yep and so what you\nneed to do it doesn't matter whether\nit's actually therapy or not but like\nyou just need some way to vent the\nenergy in the mind\nand as you vent the energy in the mind\nwhether through journaling through\ntherapy through talking through a friend\ndoesn't\nyou can talk to your dog if you want to\nlike it doesn't really matter like it's\nnot about\nwho's on the other end it's about\nventing it from your mind and then\nyou're gonna feel more relaxed\nbecause it's no longer bouncing around\nnow the reason to do therapy is because\nthe person\non the other end of the table unlike a\ndog is gonna be\ntrained at helping you vent\nright what are you thinking now you\nstarted smiling\nuh my dogs are definitely not trained in\nanything so\n[Laughter]\nthey definitely they're definitely not\ngonna be helping me out with anything\nyeah how many dogs do you have i have\nfour\nokay wow that's a lot man it's a lot of\ndogs yep\nfour dogs two kids two cats oh and cats\nwow so that's\nbusy it is very busy\nand married to boot what's up\ni said and married on top of that sir\nyep yep\nyeah wow wow it sounds like you have\nquite a full life chuck\ni do and i actually like it quite a bit\nyou know i i really do like my life i'm\ni'm very you know lucky to be able to do\nwhat i do and you know\nuh afford to even have you know this\nmany\nthings relying on me um\nbut yeah it's just uh this is this is i\nguess the one the one little\narea in which i struggle with them\nyeah can can we talk about when your\nwife was pregnant\nsure so what happened then\ni mean it's hard for me to say i guess\nlike maybe i'm not like the greatest at\nlike\num i'm not the greatest at uh\ni guess picking up on my emotions but i\ndefinitely\njust i started to notice like those\nfeelings like of anxiety like hitting me\nlike randomly\nlike you know and almost like it was\nlike building up like\nlike i was playing in like hockey\nleagues and i just remember like playing\nhockey and be like\nfeeling kind of anxious right now like\nthis is abnormal\nlike you know like you know it wasn't\njust like the thoughts like oh i don't\nhave\nlike i was kind of feeling it like\nalmost like a panic attack was coming on\nand like i said i'm pretty good at like\ndeterring those now just because like\nas afraid as i am of them happening i'm\nalso like fully aware of like when\nthey're happening and i\nand i like you know understand like\nyou know the more you feed in the worst\nit's going to be just got to take deep\nbreaths and just\nyou know do what you got to do um\nand i just it's almost like it's almost\nlike weird how it happened but\num you know i don't i also don't talk\nabout this very often but\ni'm religious and i go to church and\nstuff and i was just sitting in church\none day\num you know with my wife and my my dad\nand\nhis wife his new wife and it just hit me\nand i didn't have a panic attack it\ndidn't hit me like that\nit just hit me like a wrecking ball of\nnervousness where i'm just like you know\ni couldn't stop shaking i couldn't stop\nthinking and it's like it was like a\ncompletely different experience of what\ni experienced as my panic attack\ndoes that make sense yeah so tell me\nwhat was your experience of being hit\nwhat did you get hit by it just it just\nfelt like\nconstant overthinking constant\nnervousness like\ni i couldn't even tell you what i was\nthinking at the time but like that was\nlike the\nthe day that i kind of felt like you\nknow broke the broke the camel's back or\nyou know stroller broke the back and i\njust remember\ngoing home that night and just being\nlike unbelievably\nnervous and i couldn't stop over\nthinking and um\num you know i i have taken like you know\nsmall dosages of xanax before\nbecause you know i've had like this\nissue for a long time it's been\nprescribed i really don't take it almost\never like literally almost ever\nand i had like you know half of like a\nsmall dose of one just kind of calm me\ndown a little bit\nand i just kind of thought like\num i guess just like random stuff like\nthis this is completely like\nmaybe irrelevant but like one of the\nthoughts in my mind was like\nthe lead singer of linkin park or maybe\nnot the lead singer but he like recently\ncommitted suicide and i'm like\nis this why is it is this what he was\ndealing with like that that thought has\ncrossed my mind before too where it's\nlike\nis this what people you know decide to\nsay like they can't take it anymore and\nlike that obviously really scared me and\num yeah it's just\nyou know that day it never like really\ngot better like that was the day where\nfor months\ni couldn't live my life like literally\nevery single day i would wake up\nfirst thing on my mind i would i sleep\nlike a rock so i would go to sleep and i\nwake up\nshaking and the first thing on my mind\nis like okay i'm anxious okay like i'm\ngonna have panic attack today\nlike even even like even today like the\nfirst thing when i open my mind\nthe first word on my in my my head is\nanxiety\nevery single day like and it wasn't\nalways like that you know sometimes i\ncould wake up and\ni wouldn't think about it for a few\nhours but it is literally the\ndefault thought process in my brain\nright now is just that word\nlike anxiety sounds angry\nit sucks i i just don't like it you know\nit bothers me\ni don't want it to be there you know i\nwake up in the morning with my kids\nor my dogs or whatever reasons the first\nthing i think about\nyou know it's what i got to think about\nbefore i go to sleep and you know it's\nlike\ni just don't like most of the time i\nwill say it's definitely better as of\nrecently\ni don't have what i want to call it my\npeace of mind i don't have my mind just\nresting thinking about\nuseless stuff you know it's just it's\njust always\nlasered in on this subject most of the\ntime sometimes i do\nand sometimes i'll literally like get a\nbreak and i'll be like\nwow i was thinking about random stuff\nwell now that i'm thinking about this\nnow it's time to think about anxiety\nlike it literally like circles back like\noh wow i had a break i can't believe i\nhad a break\nnow i'm not gonna have a break because\ni'm overthinking it like\nuh chuck is there a part of you that's\nafraid that like something fundamentally\nbroke that day and will never be fixed\nmaybe essentially like i do think like\nyou know maybe i'll never have like what\nwas my normal\num i think like maybe that's kind of\nlike why sometimes i\ni'm actually afraid to get help because\nwhat if it doesn't help\nyou know what if all the stuff that is\nsupposed to help me\ndoesn't help\nso what i'm hearing is that you know if\nyou get help if you as long as you're\nnot getting help you're delaying\nfinal doom potentially uh\num you know a good reason to avoid help\nyeah i just\nyeah i'm just stuck in a loophole it\nfeels like that just doesn't end\ni'm sorry bro yeah i appreciate it\ncan i offer a couple of thoughts\nabsolutely\nso i don't think you are broken\ni think what you have can be fixed\num i think that the mind has an amazing\nreparative quality\num the body has an amazing reparative\nquality\ni think that um somehow what what you're\ndoing is you're doing like\nend game content at level 52 that's what\nit feels like to me\ni actually feel like you're doing\nremarkably well given how much you've\nhandicapped yourself\ni think it's really amazing that you've\nuh you know managed to\ncontinue to build a life and not let\nwhat sounds like truly crippling levels\nof anxiety\nand and by crippling what i mean is like\nnot that they're crippling in their\nintensity but they're like\nyou sound to be like a dude who's been\nyou know raiding for the last three\nyears\nin one encounter\nlike you've just been like it's a\nmarathon man like i'm hearing a marathon\nof just never ending and like somehow\nyou know you're still like you haven't\nwiped yet\nand and it's it's kind of like what i'm\nhearing from you in terms of\nyou know getting treatment is that\nthere's a lot of like resistance\nand that resistance comes from first of\nall the fear that like what if this\ndoesn't help because then you're like\ntruly sol like\nlike it's it's kind of interesting but\nsometimes the reason that we don't\nshoot our shot is because if we fail\nthen we've got nothing\nyou know i see this oddly enough in the\nweirdest places like people who\nlike have a crush and like as long as i\ndon't get rejected there's\nalways the chance that something will\nhappen but if i shoot my shot\nand they say no it's like then i'm truly\nfinished\nright and and so i sort of get where\nyou're coming from because i think that\nthere is\nthat too is like by the way a product of\nyour mind it's not like it's not like\nyou know you're incorrect i imagine that\nthere have been experiences in your life\nwhere you've like\nput yourself out there like and this\ncould be like really small kind of\ninsignificant things but like where you\ntold your dad dad i'm hungry\nand he's like no way you're getting food\nit didn't exactly happen like that but\nyeah right and so like your mind learned\nearly on that like\nand then maybe even like your mom would\nhave said oh well like now that you\nasked your dad i can't sneak it for you\nbut in limbo there's like there's some\nkind of\nyou know in limbo we can actually\nbenefit\num so so i sort of get that you're kind\nof feeling like fatalistic about it\num i think that a lot of your fears are\nalso kind of coming in there where like\nthere's this\nlike you know this mention this thing\nabout linkin park and it's sort of like\nif i try to get help and it doesn't work\nwhat i\nsee you kind of being afraid of is then\nyou wind up where that guy was\ni'm very afraid of that yeah right so so\nthis is where like\nyou know\ni can understand that you're afraid of\nit but that's actually what gives me\nhope\nbecause that crap we can deal with like\nyou know deal\nlike like chuck the reason i'm hopeful\nfor you is because i think you actually\nhaven't you're i mean there you are in\nthe level 60 raid\nbeing level 52 and you're like i don't\nknow if i can win and what i see is like\nbro you can level you can gain eight\nlevels\nthere's still a lot of things that you\ncan try it sounds like you haven't tried\npsychotherapy\nyou know it sounds like maybe a\nreformulation of your diagnosis\nit sounds like like continuing to learn\nlike different kinds of breathing\npractices\nlearning meditation doing some of this\nexploratory work\npotentially journaling or other things\nthere's a lot of stuff\nthat you can still do so oddly enough\neven though you feel like a little bit\nhopeless\nor really what i'm getting from you is\nthat you don't want to roll the dice and\nwind up hopeless\nyeah um but what i'm really seeing is\nthat there's like you're kind of like\ni'm opening up your character and like\ni'm seeing that you have a sword and\nshield equipped but you don't\nyou don't even have a helmet on and like\nyou don't even have boots on\nand it's like there's a lot you can do\nbecause then then what it's almost like\nyou're going into a raid and you're like\nokay i can wipe and at least i have an\nexcuse for wiping because i don't even\nhave the right gear\nbut if i gear up properly and then i\nwipe well then like then i can't clear\nit\nright like i have nothing nothing left\nno excuses does that make sense or is\nthat just is my analogy just getting\nworse and worse and worse\ni but i understand so so those are the\nthings that actually make me really\nhopeful for you that i think if you like\nyou know if you\nput on if you fill up every gear slot\ndon't even worry about like enchanting\nand putting in gems and crap like that\nbecause you have all that too i mean\nwe're talking\nabout basics we're not even talking\nabout i mean there are some people who\nwill come in and we'll have like five\nyears of therapy under their belt\nand i'm still hopeful because they\nhaven't tried this other kind of therapy\nand so there's a lot of like enchanting\nand like you know gem\nkind of work and like other kinds of set\nbonuses\nlike we haven't even gotten there we're\ntalking about the basics we're talking\nabout\nfinding a therapist and like talking to\nthem about something like that how do\nyou feel about that\nnow anyway i guess i i guess i\ncan try and find a therapist like i said\nyou know i kind of for a while\nfelt like if i went to a therapist it\ncould like\ni i don't know i it's something i didn't\nnecessarily want to do i guess like my\nmy thought process was like you know\ndoes this make me crazy\nlike or something like that\nyeah i mean how do you feel about that i\nmean\ni definitely can see uh\npositive benefits of talking about it in\ngeneral you know i mean like in just\ni'll tell you right now like generally\nspeaking twitch chat is not\nall these you know in some sections it's\nnot the place to be vulnerable and like\nme me like having that experience on\nstream\nand like getting like such a positive uh\nbenefit\nout of it when i was like my most\nvulnerable like\nyou know it definitely means that\ntalking about it has got to be\ngood because it made things better\nyou know so yeah so chuck i i think\nfirst of all\ni think that we all do this where i\nthink we\naren't entirely fair to twitch at\nbecause i find that twitch chat\nis almost like a kid where like the\nthe standard that you hold them up to is\nthe standard that they're going to live\nup to\nfair enough and and so sometimes you\nknow parents will come to me with\nproblematic kids so like i once had this\nkid who was\nyou know having a lot of behavioral\nproblems and\nmy treatment for him was to hook him up\nhe was a\nhigh school kid to set him up with an\ninternship at harvard medical school\nand i was like this kid's problem is\nthat like\npeople are not treating they're treating\nhim too lowly\nand that's what i found with with twitch\nchat is when you when you act like\ntwitch chat is a bunch\nof degenerate noobs they'll live up to\nyour expectations\nand when you act like twitch chat can\nsave the world\nthey won't let you down whatever your\nexpectations are twitch chat will\narise to meet them i want to just talk\nabout one thing that you said that if\nyou see a therapist that kind of makes\nyou crazy\nso this is going to sound kind of weird\nthat was like my thought process in a\nsense yes it's a completely reasonable\nthought process\nso so i don't think that people are\ncrazy\nlike makes me crazy so i definitely\nthink that you know some of the\nexperiences you're describing\ni think like crazy sort of fits right\nbut like i\ni think this is important to understand\ni i'm not trying to be judgmental but i\nwant you to understand that like\nthe experiences that you had are quite\ndrastic\nand outside of the realm of normal\nexperience\nand at the same time that doesn't say\nanything about you as a person\nand and i'm sorry if this you know is\noffensive but\ni want everyone to understand that our\nmind has crazy experiences it's just\nwhat our mind does and and i don't think\nyou're crazy you actually\nsound shocked to me to be incredibly\nsane and like i said\neven some of these things like if i\nignore my anxiety and it'll go away\na lot of people will hear that and think\nthat it's stupid i think it's actually\nbrilliant\nbecause i think it's what you have\nlearned that actually works\nand one of the biggest things that i try\nto explain to people is that the mind\noftentimes doesn't malfunction\nthe mind functions the best way it knows\nhow to and when we stop us\nwhen we start when we stop assuming that\nthe mind is broken\nis when we truly get power over it\nthat's when we truly understand it\nthat everything that your mind does\nusually and not everything but a lot of\nwhat your mind does is for a reason\nand the more that we understand even\nyour resistance to therapy is completely\nlogical\nright there's a lot of stuff riding on\nthat like you know\nyou're kind of like because your\nstrategy is to ignore it and it'll go\naway going to therapy is like the\nopposite of your winning strategy\nso of course you're going to be\nresistant to it and it's not it's not\ndumb to be resistant to therapy it makes\na lot of sense\nbut now this is where i would ask you\nyou know how is your experience today\ntalking about it been it's been fine\nlike obviously i was like a little\nnervous about being on here and stuff\nbut i'd\nyou know i i feel like uh i've benefited\nbeing on here today and i knew i would\nwell number one i feel like uh i'm kind\nof like getting over fears of sharing\num and i feel like that was something\nthat i\ni definitely didn't do especially with\nstrangers um number two you know you\nkind of\nare uh making me feel like a little less\nbad about myself saying like some of the\nstrategies and stuff that you know\ni've been doing is okay and like i'm\nhaving like normal thought processes and\nstuff like that\nso um i don't know it's just like\nreassuring i guess\nyeah why are you smiling now\ni guess i like to be right i answered\nyour question right\ni i i don't know i mean you're\nyou're the one who tell i asked you how\nit's it's your answer\ni don't know the right answer you have\nthe right answer chuck\num but yeah i mean i i think you've done\na really good job today i think it's\nyou know i do not envy you i think you\nyou come across\nas an incredibly i think you're\nincredibly strong chuck\nlike when i hear about the fullness of\nyour life like i understand that you're\ngrateful and stuff which is all awesome\nbut\nit doesn't sound easy bro it's not\nyou know to wake up with anxiety every\nday it just doesn't sound\neasy for sure\nyeah man and so what i'm really hoping i\ni think you'd\nyou don't need to i mean i i don't think\nyou deserve to be\nfight you know running that marathon and\nthis epic\nnever-ending struggle against anxiety\nand my hope is that some of these like\nreally simple principles like\num\nyou know venting some of that energy\nfrom your mind because\nyou know when you say that you wake up\nand anxiety is the first thing there\nit's because\nit's like a gas that's trapped you've\nlike farted into a bottle\nand you've closed the stopper and so\nlike\nin that bottle is methane and it smells\nbad and what you've really got to do is\njust pop that cork and\nlet that bad boy rip you know\nand and so there's a lot of negativity\nin there there's a lot of fear in there\ni understand that you\ncarry it every day with like you carry\nit right that's the best word that i\nhave\ni think it's an encumbrance problem more\nthan anything else\nand and so i really hope that you can\nyou know i'd strongly ask you to\nconsider you know really seeing a\ntherapist\ni definitely will look into it for sure\ni guess um\ni just got to try and find someone with\ngood reviews because i don't you know i\ndon't want to get someone that\nisn't right for me i suppose sure so i\nthink that good reviews go a long way\nbut\nfit goes a long way too so a couple of\nrules of thumb and you know if you need\na little bit of support i think we've\ngot like a\nyou know quick guide or something we can\nsend your way about finding a good\ntherapist\nwe do have a creator coaching program\nwhich normally at this point in the\ninterview i would recommend to some\npeople\ni think you should actually see a\ntherapist though you're welcome to sign\nup for our coaching program like they\nwork with things like\nyou know they're more specialized in\nthings like burnout and imposter\nsyndrome\nand and those kinds of things so they\nwork with we have a contract with twitch\nso twitch is actually sponsoring it\num but i think in your case i would go\nsee a therapist\ni think that's really um and you could\ntry out coaching if you want to but\nbut i really think that you know mental\nhealth treatment is\nappropriate for you um does that sound\njudgmental to you\nno okay do you have any questions for me\nhow long no i know i sort of feel like\nwe're at a decent stopping point but at\nthe same time you know there are a lot\nof other things that we could talk about\nlike i'm still you know i think another\nthing that is worth digging into is the\nsort of\nwhatever happened subconsciously when\nyour wife became pregnant\nand and you know how that i think that\nmay be a conversation for another day\num because i don't know how short that's\ngoing to be but\ni sort of feel like this is a decent\nstopping point because i've shared a lot\nwith you\nand i'd love it if you could kind of\ndigest that and i don't wanna\nhow can i say this sometimes i reach a\npoint in a conversation where i i feel\nif we keep talking\nwe may start to overwrite what we've\ncovered so far\nand my real desire to potentially pause\nis because i don't think that anything\nwe're going to\ntalk about now will outweigh the value\nof what we've talked about\nalready if that makes sense\ndoes that sound okay to you yeah\nabsolutely\ndo you have any questions i\ni don't i'm not i'm not a question guy\nreally i just can't okay\ni'm intrigued by what\nwhat does that mean to not be a question\nguy but so be it i'll just let that\ncuriosity ride but go ahead\ni just i uh i just generally people\nalways ask when you're done do you have\nany questions and i always i'm the one\nthat looks at my wife like\nbecause i'm good to go okay okay so and\nthen um are you interested in learning\nmeditation\num possibly i suppose\num i didn't really like so honestly i\nhad like this\nfear of kind of like being alone with my\nthoughts\num but like since i do the deep\nbreathing like i kind of close my eyes\nand it's gonna sound like the craziest\nthing ever but\nwhen i do my deep breathing i would say\nmaybe just briefly for a second if that\nthere's\nno negativity there's no anxiety you\nknow i mean like it's just completely\nit's like all these like random thoughts\nthat make absolutely\nno sense just kind of like pop into my\nbrain\nlike like it was my normal you know what\ni mean\nand um i would say that i was like\nreally afraid of that for a long time\nand then doing that for the first night\ni was like holy crap\nlike i guess this works you know so i\nguess uh i guess i\ncould be interested in learning\nmeditation but like i was that was\nsomething that i would have been opposed\nto for a long time until i started\ntrying that breathing technique\nokay so a couple of other reassuring\npoints so there's something cool about\nmeditation\nso when you do your deep breathing\nyou're back to normal\nand when you stop doing your deep\nbreathing normal\nends right\nfor the most part yeah but it's like\nit's just kind of like me being weird\nlike\ndid that help like yeah you know is this\ngoing to help like\nso this is what studies on meditation\nshow that generally speaking when we\nmeditate\nit creates temporary changes to our mind\nand the longer that we meditate if you\nmeditate for at least 20 minutes a day\nthree days a week that's the bare\nminimum the cool thing about meditation\nis that\nthe longer you meditate and the better\nyou get at it\nthe more the longer the buff lasts\nso it's sort of like when you start\nmeditating the buff lasts simply for the\nduration of the channeling\nso i'm going to channel meditation and\nthat's when i'm going to regain mana\nright it's like what's that mage spell\nthat education\nyeah so like for evocation i only gain\nmana as long as i'm channeling\nbut something really magical happens\nwith meditation which is that\nit reaches a point where it starts to\nrewire your brain\nand you actually like have a magnetic\npost channeling\nand this idea of like long-term\nmeditators who\nthroughout their entire day they're\nhappier and their anxiety is lower on a\nbaseline level\nand that's because like as we literally\nrewire our brain\nthere your neurons so thoughts are\ngenerated by neurons\nand so as you train your brain to\nhave senseless thoughts instead of\nanxious thoughts those\npatterns of neurons will start to like\nwire together and then they'll activate\nand then you'll be back to your normal\nthinking um\ni have worked with people and taught\nthem so people who have had\nanxiety disorders like diagnose anxiety\ndisorders on medication for a decade\nand after about a year or two of\nmedication they will be in what we call\nin psychiatry's sustained remission\nbecause we don't use the word cure\nbecause who knows\nso what sustained remission is is like\npeople who\ndon't have anxiety and are off of\nmedication\nand you know i'm thinking about a\nparticular person it took like two years\nbut you know i think that it that is\npossible um\nso now i've got two options for you\none is that i've got a technique that\nis a little bit of a high risk high\nreward technique\nso what i mean by that is that it's it's\na technique that's really going to work\non a physiologic level\nand so when you have anxiety and like\nkind of panic stuff i want you to\nunderstand that\nyou know how it like hits you out of the\nblue right so the mental process is not\nthe start\nthe start is actually physiology so\nyou have a physiologic change which then\ntriggers particular thoughts does that\nmake sense\num yes okay so there's a particular\ntechnique that i think will work on your\nphysiology but may actually oddly enough\ninduce a little bit of anxiety if we do\nit now if you're calm\nbut the idea behind this technique is\nthat\nwe're going to create anxiety and then\nteach you how to get out of it\nand so if you're already anxious it\nwon't make it worse but you'll kind of\npractice it getting out of it\nthat's sort of what i what i feel like\nteaching you today but i just want to be\na little bit cautious\num and then i have a more sort of stable\nnormal technique which is going to be\nlike\neasy peasy lemon squeezy it's like do\nyou want an elite mob or do you want a\nregular mob like what do you want to\ngrind on today\ni feel like would you judge me if i just\nsay the regular one\nnot at all okay because i feel like\ngenerally speaking like\ni feel like my anxiety is always kind of\nat a base level\nyou know for the most part and i feel\nlike i do like a pretty decent job\nkind of like keeping myself calm and i\nguess like\nhaving that potentially be raised\nlike i don't know that scares me a\nlittle bit that's totally fine that's\nso so i you know the reason that i i\ndon't judge you at all\nand the reason i give you the choice is\nbecause i acknowledge that that could be\na concern\nright so it's not like oh like you're\nnot going to go and they like you\nyou're like i don't want to wipe on the\nelite mob and then run back\nyou know it's just i ain't nobody got\ntime for that i can get\nelite mob is worth 20 more xp but like\ngrinding on regular mobs is normally how\nyou play wow right so\ntotally fine okay so i'm going to teach\nyou something called\num alternate nostril breathing okay\ntends to be my go-to technique\nbut is really good from a physiologic\nperspective as well but won't make\nanything worse okay\nso can you do so take your right hand\nstick out your thumb and then can you\nlift these two fingers\ngood so what i'm gonna do you have a\ndeviated septum by the way\ni don't think so okay so what i'm gonna\ndo\nand do it with me is block my right\nnostril breathe in through my left\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\nand then with a chest full of air i'm\ngoing to block the other nostril with\nthe other two fingers\nand then breathe out\nbreathe in through the same nostril\nwithout switching\nswitch and breathe out\nin\nswitch out\nin\nswitch out\ngood now close your eyes and go at your\nown pace\nremember that you want to switch on a\nfull breath\ngood and then exhale and inhale again\nthrough the same nostril and then switch\nwe'll practice for about two minutes\nso\ncool\nlet your eyes remain closed\ngo ahead and finish the breath that\nyou're on\n[Music]\nand relax just sit with yourself\nif you want to continue deep breathing\nyou can but we'll just sort of sit\nin silent meditation for about a minute\nfish\nnow i want you to breathe in for three\nseconds\nand out for three\nand now in for three and out for\nfive\nand then in for three and out for seven\nas you're ready to breathe in again\nslowly open your eyes\nsupposed to say anything if you want to\ni wasn't sure if you're waiting on me\nyeah not really it's kind of awkward for\npeople they don't really know what\nthey're supposed to do\ni would definitely say this is a little\nbit you know\ni would say that this is probably not a\nvery good public practice i feel like\npeople probably watching the stream are\nprobably like\nyou know okay we'll just sit here and\nwait for him to finish his breathing you\nknow\nyeah well ideally what happens is people\nare meditating with us\noh okay that makes sense that definitely\nthat definitely makes a lot more sense\ni guess i should have instructed people\nbut i hope i'm noticing now that you\nwere anxious about that\nno not necessarily i just thought it was\nkind of funny okay\nhmm\nyeah what was that like for you chuck it\nwas good\ni mean um you know like i said i\ni enjoy my deep breathing quite a bit i\nfeel like it just kind of takes my\nmy mind to a nice rested place\nof relaxation and i like it quite a bit\nlike i i almost like i don't want to say\ni look forward to it because maybe that\nsounds dreadful that like i look forward\nto\nyou know my 15 minutes before bed um\nin my 15 minutes waking up but uh yeah\nit's it's just nice like it's just\nit's nice to have that nice like\nrelaxation before you sleep and like\nwhen you wake up\nalthough i must say like i have a little\nbit of a different schedule where like\num\nmy wife wakes up with a kid so i wake up\na little earlier to feed the dogs or\nelse they go crazy\nso i wake up and then i don't do my\nbreathing then i feed them and i kind of\nchill for like 20 minutes while they're\noutside then i go back upstairs and then\ni go to sleep\nand then i wake up for real and then i\ndo my breathing so maybe there's like a\nlittle bit of a disconnect there i'm not\nreally sure\nbut yeah yeah i mean i don't think it\nsounds bad at all\nit sounds like you essentially you're\nmeditating um when you're doing deep\nbreathing\nand yeah and yeah i don't think it\nsounds crazy at all to look forward to\nmeditating\num you know just a couple things so\nfirst thing is that do whatever practice\nworks for you\nsometimes people find that so this\npractice works a little bit more\nphysiologically than just plain deep\nbreathing\nbut the most important common element\nchuck\nis the length of your exhalation\ncorrelates with the slowness of your\nmind\nso the longer you exhale the slower your\nmind will be\num the question so you were instructing\nthree seconds of inhale\nuh with longer exhales is that something\nthat you would recommend for deep\nbreathing too because generally i do\nlike\nas big as i can and then let out as big\nas i can and i definitely notice like\nwhen i let out\nlike i try and like fully deflate\nbecause i feel like that\nthat always feels like really good so so\nnot really so what i'm telling you is\nthe most important thing is the full\ndeflation\nokay so what i uh the\nreason to yeah so like that last bit\nis really about coming out of the\nmeditative state and kind of like\nre-anchoring us into the world\num but the length of the exhalation is\nthe most important thing so the reason\nthat this\nmeditative the one nostril breathing\npractice is that it just slows your\nbreathing down because you're using half\nyour nostrils\nto let the air in and let the air out\nthere are also some other kind of weird\nphysiologic things like it sort of\nbalances\nit deactivates your parasympathetic\nnervous system which is what releases\nlike adrenaline\nand stuff like that so it'll slow down\nit'll work in a physiologic way to like\nreduce your\npro-anxiety hormonal state\nbut deep breathing can do it too so i'd\nsay ultimately do what works for you\nthis uh technique arguably is a little\nbit\nit will be like statistically slightly\nmore successful for people with anxiety\nokay so would you recommend doing this\nin place of like\nthe deep breathing uh before or after\nsleep so so i would\ni would recommend that you follow what\nworks for you\nbut a good place to start would be you\nfigure out which one you want to do\nfirst but i would start probably with\nthis one for about\nfive to ten minutes and then do your\nnormal\ndeep breathing for about 10 minutes with\na goal of about 20 minutes of practice\nokay that's uh that's completely\nreasonable\num and then\nso just other questions like how long\nbecause you were kind of instructing me\nthis time like how long would you say\nlike do the nostrils and then like\nlike uh switch into the uh the regular\nbreathing\nor whatever like i guess with both\nnostrils is what i'm saying\nyeah so so i would say do the alternate\nnostril breathing for five to ten\nminutes\nand then do whatever deep breathing\npractice you have been doing\nfor about 10 minutes so uh i mean like\nliterally like continue to swap the\nnostrils for the full 10 minutes is that\nwhat you're saying\nno yeah for five to ten minutes yeah so\nokay okay\ngotcha okay\nokay um and then after that do your own\ndeep breathing practice where you know\nyou're doing whatever\num another question is does it matter\nlike\nhow i'm doing it like generally i kind\nof do my deep breathing laying down\nlike kind of preparing for bed like\nwould it be prefer to\nuh sit up or good question so the most\nimportant thing is that your spine and\nyour neck are straight\nso laying down works fine sitting up\nworks\nstanding up works okay but your mind\nyour back needs to be straight\nokay i i would say though if you're\ngonna do\nthis alternate nostril breathing\npractice i would do that sitting up and\nthen lay down and then do your\nyour regular deep breathing okay\ni can do that okay excellent questions\nlook at who has questions now [ __ ]\nall right sorry i need to i didn't need\nto attack on the [ __ ] at the end\nbut that's okay you know not a fan\noh interesting right because like\ngreat questions really fantastic\nquestions chuck love them\nany any other questions now i may have\nembarrassed you or\ntanked it but no i i i actually don't\nthink i have any other questions\nokay great excellent questions so good\nluck to you\nyou know um you know let me know how\nthings go if you\nif you kind of like i think we have like\na quick guide that will send people post\nstream\num i hope i'm not shooting myself in the\nfoot but i'm pretty sure we do this\nwhere\nyou know a lot of people uh you know\nhave like more private questions or\nthings like that about how to find a\ntherapist and stuff\nso i think we've got a you know so we\ncan sort of help you with\nwith that a little bit um you know if\nyou\nand so just take advantage of that if\nyou want to\num and then you know i think if you\nif you want to i think there's still\nother stuff we could still talk about so\nwe can i don't know exactly how\nscheduling works but if you ever\nyou know want to come back i think um\ndefinitely we can focus a little bit\nmore on\non what's happened over the last three\nyears um\nbut that's also something that you you\nknow i you don't need to do with us\nyou can definitely do with your\ntherapist but it just feels to me like\nsomething that was pretty significant\nthat we kind of didn't have time for\nwhich is fine\nbut you know i would encourage you to\ncontinue exploring that with someone\nfor sure sound good yeah absolutely all\nright good luck to you man\nthank you so much for coming on yeah\nthank you for having me i appreciate it\ntake care man bye yeah you too so who\nare you rating chat\nokay we're going to raid garglon\ndeeznutz\nand joe mama sagandis"
