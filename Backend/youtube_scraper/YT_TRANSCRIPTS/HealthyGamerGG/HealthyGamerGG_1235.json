    "transcript": "so this i think was was the context\nright so i think it came back to this\num donation that we got from hiromobific\nwhich is\nwhy do you do it why get up why keep\nfighting do you believe you're fighting\nfor something\nfor more than your survival can you tell\nme what it is do you even know is it\nfreedom or truth\nperhaps peace illusions or temporary\nconstructs\nokay so here's the thing so then i asked\nyou guys the question\nwhy does rain fall down and then\neveryone was like\ngravity and then i asked the question\nwhy does fire go\nup and then everyone was like we don't\nknow\nanti-gravity science physics\nyou know it just does you know\ndensity someone said i don't know\nso i was in india and and i was\nbasically asking my teachers\nsome of these questions and it's like\nwhy do\nwhy does this happen to us why do we do\nthis like why are human beings like\nfundamentally like why are we\nnot content right why do we come up with\nthese magic pills\nfor the problems that we have like\nfundamentally like why are we not\ncontent like why can't we just be happy\nlike if you look at a rock\nthat's outside the rock is just happy is\nit is this just a consequence of\nconsciousness\nand so what my teacher said and this is\nthe funny thing about you know\nmeditation teachers and ashrams is like\nsome of them really don't know science\nbut they like kind of talk like they\nknow science so then he was like\nhe has to be why does where does all\nwater end up and where does all fire\nend up someone so so eventually it was\nsort of like all water winds up in the\nocean and the scientist in me was like\nnot really because like you know\nthe like it also ends up in the clouds\nlike the whole point is that it's a\ncycle and it's like\nyou get evaporation then you get clouds\nand you get rainfall rainfall ends up in\nrivers and rivers\nends up in the ocean then he's like\nwhere does all fire end up\nit's like i don't know it just like kind\nof burns right like it like\nthere's combustion and then you like\nproduce like carbon dioxide and carbon\nmonoxide and\nthings like that and he was like\nit ends up in the sun and i was like so\ni was like okay\nwhatever and so then his point was this\nthat all fire points towards the sun\nand all all water goes towards the ocean\ni was like sure i mean i guess from sort\nof like a you know like\ni mean i guess sort of in a weird way\nit's like kind of true because fire goes\nup and the sun is generally up there so\ni'm with you kind of\nand so i mean i think the dude was\ntrying to make a point so i was like let\nthat slide okay so this is the problem\nis that if you're a skeptic\nin an ashram sometimes you get into\nthese sorts of situations where\nif you contest him on those points you\nnever get to the end of the story\njust like you guys are gonna never get\nto the end of the story and so what what\nhe was saying\nwhat came next and i was glad i kind of\nheld my piece because he was saying that\nall things strive for their source\nand sure his analogies weren't great and\nso i think like you know when people ask\nme like why do we do this like why\nbother getting better and the one thing\nthat i\ni will say is that if you look at human\nbeings we definitely have a particular\ngravity\nto us right i don't mean like gravitas i\nmean like\nthere are things that pull us in a\ndirection\nlike we get pulled like if we're\ndiscontent\nwe get pulled towards peace\nyou know we heard today about how unit\ngets pulled towards like\nquieting those calm feelings so why do\nwe do it because that's the direction\nthat we're pulled\ni could call this thing dharma or duty\ni could say that it's my duty to help\npeople but like\nthat too is like it's not dude it's just\na word that we wrap around\nlike being pulled and so what i want you\nguys to really stop and think about is\nlike\nwhat is pulling you in a particular\ndirection\nand earlier we had you know we had a\nsomeone\nkind of offer a pretty big donation and\nwe're grateful for that he was also\ntalking about how they\num you know how they're struggling and\nthey're treading water and i want what i\nwant\nall of y'all to realize if you guys are\ntrying water or you yearn\nfor something or you want something is\nlike that is actually really really\nimportant\nyou have this gravitational pull to\nbecome happy and peaceful and content\nand so it's not so much about why i mean\nlike i could offer whatever theories i\ncan that'll be just as pseudo-scientific\nas\nall fires seeks to return home to the\nsun\nthe point of the matter is that all fire\npoints up and the point of the matter is\nthat there is a gravitational pull\nthat is pulling you towards like\nbecoming content\nand happy and wanting to change your\nlife\nand so this is where i'd say use that\ngravitational potential energy\ndon't get caught up in your mind to like\nthink like oh this is the particular\nthing\nthat i need what you should focus on is\nthe direction\nnot like the precise point right so you\nmay think that a particular thing will\nmake you happy\nbut it's not that thing that's going to\nmake you happy and this is what people\ndiscover\nis they get things and things and things\nthis is what some people call\nthe hedonistic treadmill if you seek one\npleasure then you seek another pleasure\nand another pleasure and another\npleasure i see this a lot with my\nclients who work at investment banks\nwhere they're like okay once i make vp\nthen i'll be happy and then they wind up\nas vps and they're like once i make\njunior partner i'll be happy and then\nthey're not happy you're director in\nbanks and then once i become a managing\ndirector\nthen i'll be happy and then like what\nthese people don't realize is that\nthere's like one person from each of\nthese positions who comes to my office\nevery week\nincluding the managing directors they're\nat the top of the food chain\nand they look around at their life and\nthey've got two divorces behind them\nand they're like not happy\nand so like there is no particular thing\nthat if you get that thing it's gonna\nmake you happy\nthere's certainly a lot of happiness to\nbe found\nthrough achievement through\nrelationships through gaming even\nbut at the end of the day what you guys\nreally need to move towards is like just\nmove in the direction that you want to\ngo\nand don't get particularly caught up\nin in like a particular magical pill or\nsolution\nif i do this then my entire life will\nchange\nand i've seen this too it's in like\nthere's certainly progress to be made\nbut i see it in all kinds of clients and\nall kinds of people because at the end\nof the day if you listen to buddha\nbuddha you know he says that happiness\ncomes from within and that's not like i\nknow it's become like a new age yoga\ncalendar like\ninstagram kind of like thing that people\nlike posting like uh\nhappiness comes from within men so\nthat's why you should buy these\n120 lululemon pants because happiness\ncomes from within\nyeah subscribe like follow us\non twitter if you want happiness from\nwithin\nuse more social media bro yeah give us\ndonations man\ncome to my retreat bro order my merch\nbro because happiness comes from within\nwe have this really great t-shirt that\nsays happiness comes from within\nyeah and so what we recommend people do\nis they chop it up into little pieces\nwith scissors and make it into a stew\nand then eat it because then happiness\nis on the inside\nright like like we say that so much but\nwe don't\nrecognize what it means what it\nactually means is that like it is your\nthe way that you view the world\nthat matters the most and so if you're\ngetting caught up like move in the\ndirection that you need to go in\nand don't get particularly attached to\nsome\nthing that is in that direction so if\ni'm hungry like i need to eat\nsomething not eat precisely the food\nthat i'm craving\nand so you guys should do that for\nyourselves as well in terms of taking\ncare of yourself\nif you if you're if there's if there's a\npart of you that wakes up in the morning\nand is like i need to be in more shape\nthan i\nam i want to look better and then what\nhappens is you attach yourself to a\nparticular fantasy\ni want to look like that don't follow\nthe fantasy\nmove in the direction so it's not about\nhaving like\nyou know being one of these these\ngeneric\ndudes who's on the bachelor it's like\nabout\nbeing a little bit better than you were\nthe day before\nand so exercise a little bit eat a\nlittle bit healthier eat a piece of\nfruit\ndrink water instead of soda like take\none little thing\nand do that thing move in the direction\nthat you're going but don't get caught\nup in a particular\ngoal i'm only going to go to college if\ni can go to harvard and nothing else is\nis worth it right i'm only gonna go to\nthe gym like i'm gonna start going to\nthe gym once i'm in shape so i don't\nembarrass myself it's like\ni know exactly how those people feel\nbecause that's how i feel i have those\nthoughts\nbut it's like completely missing the\npoint just like think about that thought\nprocess for a second\nyou know it's like i'm gonna go to the\ngym once i'm in shape look what\nyou know like this is the only thing\nthat's going to work for me like you\nattach yourselves to this particular\nhope\nand you go towards it but just get help\nmove in the direction that your\ngravitation is pulling you\nhead towards the source do something\nanything in the right direction\nand that is how you wind up in the right\nplace\nyou don't start from you know the\nbeginning\nand see a particular point because you\ndon't know what's going to work from you\nat the very beginning of the journey\nthis is something that is called the\nplanning fallacy which is that we make\nplans at the beginning which is when we\nhave the least information\nand therefore our plans are actually\nobjectively the worst plans that they'll\never be\nis at the very beginning but this is\nwhat we do we attach ourselves to a goal\nand we say oh this is what i need to be\nhappy but what do you know like you're\nnot like\nyou haven't started that journey move in\nthe right direction\ntake one step forward and let go of\nwhat's going to happen\ni was psyched today because i had a\ngreat meditation for yuna i was like\nthis is going to be perfect this is what\ni studied meditation for\nbecause she has this problem and i have\nthe perfect meditation for her\nand then life taught me the same lesson\nover and over and over again because\nthis is what i've noticed happens to me\nthe more perfect of an answer i have i\neven said her i said i have an answer\nfor you\nyou guys notice that i don't usually say\nthat\nso i've noticed that when i feel like\ni've just noticed this weird pattern in\nmy own life that when i think i know\nsomething and i'm like\nah now the wisdom of dr k will transform\nyou\nlife comes and just [ __ ] slaps me\nit's like uh dr k get back in your place\nlisten to what they're saying because\nthey don't seem to be ready for it yet\nand it's like okay fine\ni'll take it let me just follow her\nwhere she wants to go and the perfect\nmeditation is for another day\nyou guys notice that like how bizarre it\nis that i don't usually say that\nusually i'm struggling to find something\nand today i have the perfect one\nand jabaided is absolutely right\nand so we learn these lessons like i get\ntaught these lessons continuously and\nyou guys should take away this lesson\ntoo\nwhich is that if you're attached to a\nparticular thing that is the answer to\nall of your problems\nchances are it's not the answer to all\nyour problems the answer to all of your\nproblems is to take\nsecond best get the silver medal every\nsingle time or even the bronze like\nwho's complaining just go for it\nright okay so that was the story"
