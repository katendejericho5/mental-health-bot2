you\nreally good i'm so sorry i'm late\ni think that's okay it's not really yeah\nokay it gives me i i you know sometimes\nit's a weird\num uh it's sort of like a weird blessing\nin disguise because i get to actually\nhang out with chat for a little while\nwhich could be a long time\nyou're so nice i i literally woke up\nfive minutes ago yeah i've\nslept through my alarm yeah that happens\ni'm sorry that's okay are you are you\nyou seem\nreally really um and maybe embarrassed\nor something about it\noh yeah yeah a little bit\nand how can i reassure you that you\nbeing late is really not a big deal\noh not oh i i believe you now\nokay i believe you\n[Music]\nokay cool so uh yoona if you\nyou know if you need a minute to wake up\ni don't know if you will like want to\ngrab a cup of coffee or something you're\nwelcome\ni'm awake normally oh\nwait okay yeah yeah and so\num you know just a couple things so\nsometimes we'll have a quick call with\npeople before they come on stream just\nto outline that like\nyou know if there's anything that um you\ndon't want to talk about or anything you\ndon't feel comfortable talking about\nsometimes we'll give people an\nopportunity to set that boundary i know\nthat you know we didn't have that chance\nso\ni just want to tell you if there's\nanything that you feel uncomfortable\ntalking about\num yeah you know you can just say so if\ni ask you any question that you feel\nlike is out of line that's totally fine\njust let me know i'm also going to try\nto pay attention to things that may\nmaybe may make you feel uncomfortable\nand then i may ask you for permission to\ncontinue and i may even say\nare you sure you want to continue\ntalking about that because it seems like\nthere's some emotions coming up or\nsomething like that\nis that okay yeah sounds good\num one other thing is that it seems like\nokay cool\nwhat are you excited about talking to\nyou\nokay what what do you want to talk about\noh\nnow oh uh\nuh uh my\nissues okay that's a scary word\ni have a lot of i have a lot of issues\nokay what are your issues so many issues\noh\nokay um uh\nuh i guess i'm a big workaholic\nokay i don't have i don't i feel\nanxiety when um\nwhenever i hang out with friends or\nfamily\num okay that's i i would say that's like\nmy number one issue i feel\num i feel guilty about um hanging out\nwith\nfriends and that's probably why i don't\nhave any friends\nokay um\ni think i also have like i can't\nreally um i don't really do well\nin like a group setting\nlike a social group setting um\nso i get a lot of anxiety um\nand\ninsomnia i'm a huge insomniac i can't\nsleep um\nand that's yeah\nthat's around that's about it sounds\nlike\nenough to me\nsounds sounds actually pretty tough you\nknow\num um it's okay\nit's all right i deal with it i've been\ndealing with it for a while\nhow long have you been dealing with it\num\nsince\nlike college okay school\nhigh school college and can you tell me\na little bit about\nwhat high school was like for you\num high school wasn't too bad\nmy school was just like um\ni would say high school was pretty\nnormal um\ni thought i had a\nlot of time to work on my stuff\ni didn't really have any friends but um\ni had one close friend\num but she kind of went a little crazy\ni guess because like her parents became\nlike her parents are\nsuper religious and then\num she they kind of\nlike she was like super cool with\na lot of things and then her parents\nkind of took over her\nand like told her like she um\nlike listens to music or watches movies\nor you know\nthere's any of like those type of things\num they'll like abandon her and then so\nlike\nyeah it was really extreme and then she\nso she and i stopped being friends\num and then yeah that was the only thing\nthat was like really like uh on a during\nhigh school\nwow that's kind of wild what's it like\nto lose your only friend to\nreligious extremism um\nit sucked what talking about\num\nwell\nbecause she was like the only person i\ncould talk to about things so like\num losing her uh\nkind of sucks a lot\nhave you lost people before um yeah\ni had like i had another best friend\num but she had to move\nbecause of visa reasons to japan back to\njapan and then when she moved she like\nnever\nspoke to me again which was weird\num but\nyeah and um\nso can you help me understand so it\nseems like you usually have\nmaybe like very few friends that are\nvery close yeah\nuh-huh and what's your understanding of\nkind of how that happens\ni'm sorry what do you mean so when i\nthink about high school\nlike i was not very popular by any means\nbut yeah i had you know a little gang\nand i think and i i think that you know\nmost people in high school have sort of\na gang or a click\nand they certainly may have particular\nfriends that they're very close to but\ni'm not really hearing that you\nyou really have a social circle like\neven in high school no\nno i never never had one do you have a\nsense like did you have like a social\ncircle like it when you were younger\nthan high school like middle school\nno no my my childhood was really bad\nlike what do you mean by that i was\nso when i was in elementary school um\nso i was born uh unlucky\nkind of in korea um\nso when you're close when you're born\nclose to lunar year in korea\nyour age um\nit's like plus two it's weird\nand so then the kids get\nan option to go to school early\num so my parents wanted to\ndecided that they wanted to like further\nmy education\nfaster so because life is a race\nyeah so they put me to school early um\nback then\num korea had like capital punishment\num so like i couldn't\nuh keep up with class because you know\nkids\nif you're like back when you're a kid\nlike one or two years of difference\nmakes like a big difference\nright um so i couldn't keep up with like\nhomework i couldn't keep up with like\nanswers in class\num i was like the smallest out of all\nthe kids\nand so like whenever we would get\nsomething warm up like multiple times\nlike the\nteachers would like bring us up and hit\nus with like a wooden stick\num in front of like all the kids um but\nbecause like i couldn't\nkeep up like 99 of the time i was always\nlike shown\nand um hit\noh no okay okay okay wait\nwait wait wait wait wait wait um so this\nis like first grade too\nhold on\nso you know how i said that there are\ngoing to be some things that may come up\nbecause we haven't touched this is fun\nthat this is fine\nyeah because i talked about this like in\nthe stream before so this is fine\nwhat are you feeling right now uh\nthat i'm sensitive what does that mean\num because i'm like tearing up a bit\nis being sensitive a bad thing no\nit's just annoying what's annoying about\nit\nbecause i start crying and what's\nannoying about that\num because it's\ni don't know i guess there's nothing\nwrong with\nit there's nothing wrong with what\noh crying then why do you feel annoyed\nwhat does that word\nmean annoyed because i i'm i'm like i'm\na\nlike i'm an easy crier it's like\ni um when i talk about emotional stuff i\ntend to like cry\nall right i understand that you do that\ni see that you do that what i'm curious\nabout is\nyour reaction to the crying\noh yeah yeah it's um it's like it's not\nnecessary\nwhy isn't it necessary um because it's\nokay to cry\nbecause it's okay to show your emotions\nyeah so maybe i'm maybe i'm\nmisunderstanding you here you know but\nwhat i'm sort of noticing is that you\ncry\nand then when i ask you about crying you\nsay it's annoying\noh yeah yeah yeah so so the annoying\nso and then when you say it's okay to\ncry like i'm a little bit confused\nbecause it seems like there's a part of\nyou that feels\nsensitive or annoying or like maybe\nyou're weak or something like that\nand you shouldn't cry and there's a part\nof you that no no it's totally fine to\ncry\nthat's kind of what i'm getting from you\ni'm getting kind of mixed\nis that yeah accurate yeah yeah\nfor sure yeah okay so\ni know this is gonna sound weird but\ni think what we're gonna try to teach\nyou is that\nyou're okay okay and the weird thing\nabout that\nis that part of teaching you that you're\nokay doesn't mean just\naccept you're accepting yourself for\ncrying it also means\naccepting yourself for being annoyed at\ncrying\noh okay does that make sense or is that\nkind of weird\nso like it's it's weird but if you feel\njudgment towards yourself like oh i'm\nstupid i shouldn't cry i'm too sensitive\ni want you to voice those feelings too\nso we can learn how to sit with those as\nwell\nokay because i think in a weird way what\nyou're doing is\nis you're doing to yourself what your\nteachers used to do to you\nyeah you say yes if that makes sense\ncan you explain that to us um\nso like you're basically saying like um\npunishing myself by making myself feel\nlike\nit's not okay to cry or\nexactly is is that what you think you\nmay do sometimes\nyeah a lot\ni think so too i think maybe being a\nworkaholic has something to do with that\ntoo what do you think\nyeah probably yeah all right\nso we could kind of go back to the story\nbut like first of all you know that's\nlike that sounds shocking and very\ndifficult to go through as a child\nyeah because um what would happen is\nlike you know how kids learn\nfrom adults yes so like you know when\num the teachers would like you know hit\nme like the other kids like during\nplaytime or whatever would just kind of\ngather up and hit me too\nand so like it kind of um\nso that was like my elementary school\nexperience\nand then like um um\nand then my dad got a job in the us\nand we i was taken away from like\nlike my parents didn't know about any of\nthis because i never told them\num and what's your understanding of why\nyou never told them\num well what would happen is like\nmy parents would be called to school\num and my teachers will tell\nmy my my parents that\ni'm not doing so good and that i'm not\nvery smart\nand i'm not like i'm kind of stupid so\nlike my parents\num decided to like put me through like\narts\nlike direction of heart because they\nthought i was like\ntoo dumb to get a real job\nyeah yeah um\ni um\ni don't know why i didn't tell them i\nthink i just thought that\neverything that i was doing was just\nwrong\nso like at that time\ndo you ever feel that way now that\nsometimes your mind just kind of feels\nlike everything you're doing is wrong\num uh in some ways\nyeah in some ways yeah okay\nso let's just put a quick pin in that we\ncan maybe come back to that thought or\nthat feeling later\nyeah and so what happened when you moved\nto the u.s\num it was really nice because like i was\nreally shocked that\nlike you can make mistakes and like\nteachers\nlike other kids don't bully you and like\nthat was not allowed and\num it was really nice\nbut you know i had trouble making\nfriends because of the language\nbarrier and\nbut that's when i met like i became\nfriends like with my japanese friend\nand because she was also um she also\ncame to the us\num and we kind of like learned and hang\nout hung out together\nand then how how old were you when you\nmoved to the us\neight and how did you do in school\nwhen you moved to the us um i was like\nso i have a severe adhd\nso i would like i did my best because\nlike\num my parents didn't want me to get any\nlike bees\num so like i did all right but i didn't\nlike straight a's all the time\nwhat what's your understanding what your\ncat is doing right now\nshe loves me does she do that\nor does she she's she cuddles\nshe wants cuddles 24 7. okay so this\nisn't yeah it's not like she's\nshe can tell you're suffering or\nanything and is coming over to\num sometimes sometimes\nsometimes she's timed really well\nokay and i know like if i whenever i\nleave to take out the trash\nshe starts crying like yelling\num so i know she's very attached to me\num yeah she's cute she's really really\nshe does seem very comfortable yeah she\nlike\nshe's like to snuggle like right here\nwhen i\ngo to sleep she's very cute\nawesome and so\nit sounds like you did okay in school\nbut your parents put some pressure on\nyou but you were generally relieved\nwhen you moved here yeah yeah\nand then they relief and what was it\nlike to have a friend\ni was nice oh it was really nice i\nremember like\num back when i was in south korea\ni had like one friend i was like\ni managed to convince one friend to come\nover\nor like to convince a person to come\nover and\nplay and hang out and i had so much fun\nand then when\nthat person left i cried so much\nduring like that time because it was\nlike\nand then so now i have when i had a\nfriend who came up for all the time\nit was awesome and when did your friend\nleave to japan\num like in middle school\nlike like in the middle of school i\nwould say like mid or ends i\ncan't remember exactly i think middle of\nmiddle school\nbecause i had another friend that was\nreally close to but she also moved\nhmm\nit seems like your friends always leave\nyou yeah\nyeah yeah\nis that funny no i laugh\nwhen i laugh i laugh\nwhen i feel sad sometimes it's like it's\nlike my go-to\num yeah i laugh when i'm awkward i laugh\nwhen i'm sad\num sometimes i laugh when i'm pissed off\ni it's like my go-to um it's very\nprotective isn't it\nstay yeah what do you so you\nwhat do you think about that sort of\nlike growing up and having your friends\nlike\nbecause here's here's kind of what i'm\nenvisioning so first of all you know you\nwere taught\nearly on that you suck\nright like that's that's what i'm\nhearing like your teachers used to like\nyou were you were put into the situation\nwhere like you were you know the deck is\nstacked against you\nand and like it sounds really really\nhard\nbut you were taught this lesson and i i\ndidn't curse to me that i was a little\ninsensitive to say that but\nhonestly that was the best way that i\ncould encapsulate like what i\nimagined a child like that feels like\nwhere your teachers would like publicly\nshame you\nand sort of tell you again and again and\nagain that you're not good enough you're\nnot good enough you're not good enough\nand then furthermore the other kids\nwould be like oh she's the one who's not\ngood enough and we're supposed to hit\nher\nokay you know and so you were taught\nthat other\nchildren were like not people that you\ncould connect with\nand then you managed to find a friend\nyou know another little awkward\nimmigrant who maybe has language\nbarriers and you can connect to her\nand then she leaves and then never talks\nto you again\nyep and how did you feel\nlike what thoughts went through your\nhead when she left and\nnot just when she left but when she\ndidn't well\ni think back then because i'm i'm like\ni'm 30 i'm turning 31\nreally soon so like back then it was\nhard to\ncommunicate outside of because like\nthere\non social media it was there was only me\nemail right\nand you know um she didn't have like a\nnumber or so but she did give like\nme like her dad's email um\nand i wrote her and stuff i like her\naddress\nbut i just never got like a response\nback\nso um i didn't really think much of it i\njust thought oh she probably can't\nlike because it's her dad email or um\nso it sounds to me like you attributed\nreasons to her not responding\nyeah yeah and is there a part of you\nthat sort of felt like\neven though all that stuff may have been\ntrue that she sort of didn't\ncare to respond or didn't care enough\nabout you\num\n[Music]\ni think like i i mean\ni guess when i think about it now it\nfeels like that i think back then i just\nkind of\nbecause i tried for like four years\nso long um yeah so i didn't\nlike i don't i don't know i just\ni didn't really think like she doesn't\ncare about me i\nconstantly think oh she probably just\ncan't\nreach back for some reason okay\nand so it sounds like you made another\nfriend in middle middle school\nyeah i've made another friend and then\nbut\nshe actually also moved away\nout of state and how did you feel about\nthat do you remember\nuh i thought oh crap\num i was sad about it but\nyou know i was like oh i could just i'll\nmake another friend\nin high school and you made another\nfriend\nin high school yeah i did i made a\nanother friend in high school\nand she and i were really close\nwere yeah because she\nkind of just suddenly like became\nbecause she was like her family was\nsuper religious\nbut she herself was she was still\nreligious but she wasn't fanatical\nand then like she would hang out with me\nall the time we would go watch movies we\nwould play games we would\num listen to music and like her parents\nlike found out\nand like told her like you know\nif she continues to watch movies um\nlisten to music then they'll like\nabandon her\nyou know you know besides her yeah like\nshun her\nyeah you know this sounds really crazy\nbut it seems like life conspires to take\npeople away from you\nyeah oh but i don't feel yeah\nyeah i sometimes feel like that\nthat's weird\nis that just are you just unlucky or\nwhat's going on like how do we\nunderstand that\num is it just a feeling like\nhow do you make sound i have no idea it\njust\nhappens yeah\ndo you feel lonely\nyeah but\ni mean i have one\nlike i have one really close friend now\nso like\ni feel less lonely now because i feel\nlike when i have one\nlike all i need is like one close friend\nsure\nand um so now i feel like\nless lonely i would say\nlet me think about how to say this\ni can see that you can survive with just\none close friend\nyeah and at the same time i think it's\nreally sad\nwhen people can grow\naccustomed to being\nokay with the bare minimum of what they\nreally deserve in life\nit's actually one of the saddest things\nto me really when people get used to it\nyeah\noh\nwhat do you think so i should make more\nfriends\ndo you want more friends i do have\nfriends like i have\num i do have like\nbut i have like one close friend and\nthen i have like\nfriends i can hit up sometimes\nnow because um i made a lot of streamer\nfriends\num so\nyeah it's but i feel also feel bad\nbecause i don't have time\na lot of time to hang out with a lot of\nthem\nbecause i'm too busy working sure\nyeah i\ncan i think for a second yeah\ni'm trying to figure out where to go can\ni just think out loud\nyeah yeah you can yeah you can help me\nso first is that like you know we can\ncontinue talking about your feelings and\ntrying to explore where things\ncome from and you know how you feel and\nwhat you think about stuff\nyou asked me an interesting question you\nsaid should i make more friends\nand so that is what we that's kind of\nlike a problem-solving sort of thing so\nlike i\ni don't always give people advice they\ndon't tell people that they should do x\ny or z because i mean\nwho am i to say i mean and my\nmy gut reaction to that answer is like\nyou know it can be hard to\nhave just one friend because\nlife circumstances can take people away\nfrom you\nright yeah and so there's a part of me\nthat sort of says you should diversify\nso that if someone has something going\non then then like\nyou know you're not stuck friendless for\na while in forming one connection but\nyou know that's that's just sort of it's\nan intellectual answer i don't know that\nyou should make for\nfriends i think it's like that's a\nquestion for you to decide\nyeah um and then there are a couple of\nother things so we can kind of continue\ntalking about friends and stuff like\nthat we can just switch\nto sort of switch gears but i i think\nit's all going to come back to this\nbecause i think it didn't\ni mean i don't know why but like it\nfeels to me like\nyou know growing up the way that you did\nis gonna significantly give you social\nanxiety\nyeah and and so you know we can talk a\nlittle bit about what social anxiety\nfeels like in the moment\nwhat is it that keeps you from making\nfriends what\nwhy is it that you make sort of one\nfriend at a time like how does that\nhappen\nand why doesn't that number become two\nand i suspect that that has something to\ndo with the way\nthat you interact with them not the way\nthat they interact with you\nthat you probably do certain things\nuntil you find a friend\nand then you stop doing those things\nbecause then you have a friend like what\ndo you mean i'm not sure\nthat's why we can kind of talk about\nthat okay so because it is weird that\nlike you\nthere's got to be a reason why you have\none friend at a time basically\nlike that can't just be coincidence it\nhas to do you know\nyeah i'm gonna sort of use a completely\nlike different kind of random and maybe\ninappropriate example but like\nyou know sometimes i've worked with\npeople who have a lot of affairs\nand it's like it's not a coincidence\nthat they keep having affairs it's like\nthey're doing something to put\nthemselves in a particular situation\nwhere they create a particular kind of\nsocial situation\nand in your case you know i don't think\nit's just like there's like just\nrandomly one person that you can connect\nwith i think something happens about\nyou know once you make a friend you\nprobably like either you start spending\na lot of time with them so you don't\nhave time to make other friends or\nsince that's enough for you you stop\neating because you feel full or not full\nbut you just don't feel hungry enough\n[Music]\ni see yeah what do you think about that\nit's interesting i never thought about\nit that way\num\ni think like like for me what happens is\nlike\num\nlike i like i put\nlike i work a lot because like it's\nwhere i feel like the safest\nyep we're gonna get into that in a\nsecond i'm good i'm glad you realize\nthat\nsaved us a lot of time yeah and then\nlike um\nand\nlike i have i think i choose to have one\nfriend because like\num\nwith this one i don't feel\nanxiety when i hang out with him because\nhe lets me work\nwhen i'm hanging out um\nso like i think\ni i'm trying to figure out my reasons\nwhy like i only\nchoose that one friend at a time um\ni think it's i don't know i because i i\nconnect\nreally well when i have like one close\nfriend\nbecause i do have like other friends i\ncan hit up\ni think it's just that whenever i play\ngames or i'm away from my work fully\ni get really anxious to go back to\nworking\nso like um\nlike i guess like my close friend\nunderstands that\nso like when we hang out i'm still\nworking and he's totally cool with\nit um\ni also find myself being really curious\nyuna and this is definitely a boundary\nthat we don't have to talk about but i'm\nreally curious about your romantic\nrelationships\nand if you've had them um\nand that that you know some people\naren't comfortable talking about that so\ni i think it could be informative and\nour goal here is to help you understand\nyourself\nand at the same time i can imagine that\nyou of all people would be quite private\nso i want to steer clear of that if you\ndon't want to talk about it\nyeah i can talk about\num let me let me think about it for a\nsecond\num\nyeah i guess i don't i don't know if i\nwant to get into makes perfect sense\ni think we have a lot of stuff a lot of\nother things that we can talk about\nthat'll be very productive\nyeah so let's talk about the anxiety of\nbeing a workaholic like to\nhelp me understand what you mean by\nanxiety when you're not working\num when i'm not working\nand i'm like doing something else like\nplaying games or socializing i\ni'm like i feel like i have this like i\ndon't know why\ni know it's not right but i feel like\ni'm wasting time because\ni'm always i'm like oh but i have to do\nthis and if i\ncan get this done or like um\nlike and then i don't actually actively\nthink this i just feel it\nfeel like\nlike impatience like you're pointing to\nyour stomach\nyeah like i don't know how to explain\nthat it's like\nwhen you take a lot of caffeine it's\nlike i don't know how to explain that\nit's um\ni feel anxious\ndo you do you remember what you this is\nto be kind of a weird shot in the dark\nbut do you remember\ndid you know when you were growing up in\nkorea that you were going to get called\non\nand that you were going to get the\nanswer wrong\ndid you see it coming oh yeah do you\nremember\nhow you felt when you saw it coming\nscared is that the way that you feel now\nwhen you feel anxious\nyeah yeah let's see yeah how similar is\nthe feeling on a scale of one to ten\nten being exactly the same one being um\nit's similar i would say it's similar\nit's not exactly the same because\nback then it was scarier yeah so so so\ni i think what i'm hearing is that the\nquality\nof the feeling is the same the intensity\nof the feeling is lower yeah\nyeah and the more you work\nthe more the feeling goes away\nyeah yeah i just feel safer when i'm\nworking\nyep and so i know this sounds kind of\nweird but like\nthis is gonna be a real stretch okay so\nif it doesn't make sense\ntotally my fault but i think the reason\nyou're a workaholic\nis because that's the way that your body\nhas learned how to avoid going up in\nfront of the classroom and getting\nsmacked with a stick\num i think like\ni think that it's\ntrue but i also feel like i'm a\nworkaholic because i feel like all my\nworth is tied to my work for some reason\nyes yeah that's not for some reason it's\nthe same\ni mean so oh okay right so like let's\nthink about this what was your worth\ntied to when you were growing up\nme answering questions your performance\nright yeah yeah and so you were taught\nthat you were like not a good human\nbeing\nbecause your performance is bad\nyeah and now like when your performance\nis bad how do you feel you know\nreally really really really really\nreally really bad\nand do you feel like you did when you\nwere up front in front of a classroom\nand um\nthe quality is the same like you were\nsaying definitely not as\num intense yeah sure yeah\nand at the same time you used a lot of\nreallys there\noh yeah that's true all right you're\nlike really really really really really\nreally bad\nyou're right that's true oh my gosh\nwhat do you think about that\num i just never realized i it's just\nlate\nit's just like so many connections are\nbeing made i didn't\ni didn't realize it before\num what do i think about it\num you could just sit for a second and\nprocess\nbut yeah or you can say something\nwhatever you want to do\num\nit makes sense um\ni would say um it makes sense and\ni guess it's not it's not necessary for\nme to feel that way\nsure it is what do you mean it's not\nnecessary help me understand that\ni i think i'm kind of getting confused\ni think my mind is staying like like my\nmind is kind of getting confused\nwhat are you confused by um i just said\nsomething that was\nkind of weird and contradictory so if\nthat's confusing you that was the\nintention of my statement\noh no i'm like i'm trying to figure out\nlike how i feel about it but i don't\nfeel\ngood about it i feel good about what uh\ni don't feel good about\nthat i um\npunish myself for um\nright not doing well yep\nso remember when i said acceptance is\nnot just\nsaying it's okay to cry it's also\naccepting what\num accepting that you\njudge yourself for crying yeah yeah\nright so i think you're doing the same\nthing here\nwhere you're not you're judging you're\npunishing yourself for whatever\nthe reaction is it doesn't it sort of\ndoesn't matter\nyeah even in this discussion what i'm\nkind of hearing from you is that\ni think part of the reason that what you\ndescribe is confusion\nand i can understand what feels like\nconfusion now i'm really maybe confusing\nyou so apologies but\ni think part of what's confusing is that\nlike they're you're making revelations\nand you're also judging those\nrevelations\nand telling yourself at the same time oh\nthis should be different\nis that going on um\n[Music]\nyeah i would say so and what are you\nsaying about yourself that should be\ndifferent tell us what should be\ndifferent about you\num well i just i feel like i should\num i\nguess i should just not feel that i mean\ni guess\ni should just not feel like i'm judging\nlike\ni shouldn't judge myself yep but that in\nand of itself is you judging yourself\nfor not judging yourself oh no\ni don't know what to do exactly exactly\nthat's the point\nthat's the point no no you're good good\ngood good good\nthat's what you do about it like you see\nlike\nit goes on forever yeah\nyou can judge yourself for not judging\nyourself for not judging yourself you\ncan ju\nlike you just keeps going on forever\nyeah and so that's why that's why i'm\npointing it out to you because as long\nas you judge yourself like as long as\nthere's any kind of judgment towards\nyourself it'll like it'll it's never\ngonna work\nit's actually the same thing that\nhas put on a mask\nbut it's the same lack of acceptance and\njudgment towards yourself for not being\ngood\ngood enough and you see how quickly it\nmoves it's like\noh you should be more accepting of\nyourself\nhow dare you be less accepting of\nyourself you know that's a judgment\nyeah right and and so so this is what\nhappens is there's a part of your mind\nthat when you feel kind of insecure or\nanxious\nis gonna tell you yoona you need to do\nbetter\nyeah and even in this conversation it's\nlike it's telling you like oh you know\nlike you need to be less confusing\nyou need to like you need to be able to\nlisten and understand what he's saying\nlike you're going to be judging yourself\nconstantly whereas you're doing great\ni can guarantee if there's any\ncommunication problem in this\nconversation it's totally on me\nbecause i can be really hard to talk to\nwhat do you think about that oh god i\njust dreamt um\nno you're awesome i don't i think you're\nreally easy to talk to\num i think um\nyou're right i shouldn't i shouldn't\njudge\nyou're doing it again oh my god okay\nwait i don't know what to do i know it's\nreally confusing\nit's really confusing right so so this\nway\nlike i know it sounds weird but at the\nvery beginning i said it's okay to judge\nyourself\nso because okay\nbecause if you if you say it's okay to\njudge yourself\nyou're not judging yourself for judging\nyourself you're accepting yourself\nokay i see see it's weird\nyeah and it feels really foreign to you\nlike you don't\nknow how to do that you don't know how\nto yeah\nthat's really weird how do you do that\nit's really confusing and it's hard\ntrust me\nyeah right because as a kid you were\ntaught how to judge yourself\nyou were judged by your teachers you\nhaven't really touched on parents will\nprobably steer clear of that because but\nyou're probably judged by your parents\nbecause all of our parents judge us you\nknow you should do art because you're\nnot smart enough etc\nyou know and i mean they wanted to do\nthe best that they could for you and\nthey yeah\nyou know so they their heart was in the\nright place but sometimes\nyou know that can still leave\npsychological\nimprints um and so i know it sounds\nreally really weird\nto accept yourself and i know it's gonna\nbe really really confusing for you but i\nthink it's gonna\nbe like really really transformative\nwhen you learn how to do it\nbecause then suddenly you don't have to\nbe a workaholic\nthe only friends that i like being like\nyes you do so let's talk about that that\nwas nice\nwhat feels nice i love working what do\nyou love about working\nit's fun okay it's\nfun i love i l it's like but\nmy work is like my hobby as well so\num i love doing it\nand i get really proud when i\nwha i get proud and of the stuff that i\ncreate\nat the same time i'm always i have a\nreally severe imposter syndrome\nso i'm like i'm proud of it but\nat the same time i can't be it's weird\njust like it's like um\nbecause in my head i'm like oh it's not\na big deal because\nyou know if i can do it like why why is\nit that special because i\ni did it so it must not be that special\nbecause\nif i can do it anybody can do it um\nso i guess yeah i have like i struggle\nwith a lot\ni struggle with a lot of like being\nproud of the things like i am proud like\ni tell myself\nthat to be proud of it and to be happy\nwith\nit but like i struggle with that a lot\nbecause\num i don't actually feel it\nyep what do you feel\ni don't feel anything like i actually\nlike as a\nlike when i make something and i create\nsomething and i know it's good like in\nmy head\ni know it's good because\nyou know i get told that it's good\nbut like i myself\ni tell it to myself i don't feel\num like oh this is awesome\noh what i created was awesome um\ni tell it to myself i don't feel it i\ndon't know how to explain it do you feel\nlike\nit's bad or you just don't\nfeel like yeah yeah i feel like it's bad\nbecause\ni'm like i shouldn't be so prideful\nbecause like\nyou know at the end of the day i mean i\ndon't know i keep telling i keep pushing\nmy i keep putting myself down\nhonestly like when i think about it\nbecause i always say like\noh i shouldn't be that proud because\nlike my code sucks there's so many\ndifferent ways to make this better like\nyou know it's so messy um\nyou know there's so many people that's\nway better than\ni am with like with coding and\num so like why should i like i shouldn't\nfeel\nproud of it because it and at the end of\nthe day it kind of sucks so i need to do\nbetter i need to fix\nit um i'm not doing enough\num all this stuff\nyeah right so here's what i'm hearing is\nthat it's not\ngood enough yeah\nright because yuna isn't someone who is\ngood enough\nyeah so even though\nso so this is the tricky thing is that\nthere's like eight-year-old yoona\nor six-year-old you know a four-year-old\nyuna or whenever you started school\nand then there's almost 31 year old yuna\nan almost 31 year old yoona knows that\nwhat she puts out is good\nbut inside there's like six-year-old\nyuna who like every time she does her\nbest\nwhat happens to her\num she gets like not you know what's\nfunny\ni have adhd but i want to tell you a\nfunny story please\num i loved it so one time i found a\nwooden stick\nlike a lay a big long one inside i don't\nknow i found it\nthis big long stick that like it's the\nstick that you used to hit\npeople with right like the same ones\nthat they used\nin the um schools and stuff i i found\nthe stick\nand i was proud of finding the stick and\ni brought it to school because\nto defend myself and instead my teacher\ntook the stick\nand used that stick to punish me\nfor like the the rest of\nthat was like her favorite stick um\nso yeah it feels like it feels like um\ni don't know why i've segued into that\nstory um i just when you told me like\nhow do i feel\nabout me getting hit um excuse\nyourself like me getting hit like\nlike i i just that that one was like the\nmost shocking\nlike yeah i think that your mind is not\nadhd there i think that is forming a\nreally important connection\nthat is actually exactly what we're\ntalking about\nbecause i want to tell you i'm going to\ninterpret that story for you\nin a way that i mean i sometimes is just\nblows my mind\nso what that story tells me is when yuna\ntries to do something good in life\nwhat happens\nwhen she tries to take control it gets\nturned around right so every time you\ntell yourself\ni'm doing a good job now this is good i\nshould be proud of this\ninside is the girl who's like we tried\nto take control we tried to move forward\nwe tried to get better\nand we got beat yeah\nlike it's like like that's that's the\nmost important story you've shared\nbecause it's the story that taught you\nthat you can't\nmake you can't change your life\nyeah it's one thing to have your life\nagainst you\nit's another thing to try to change it\nand be like beat with that stick for the\nrest of elementary school\nyep so like when you tell yourself that\nlike\nhey i'm i'm a good person now i make\ncontent that's good\ni should be proud of this code that's\nyou picking up the stick again\n[Music]\nand then there's a part of you that's\nlike uh-uh we've been down that road\nbefore it does not end well\nwho are you to pick up that stick you\nbetter just leave it on the ground\n[Music]\nsorry oh wait i'm not that sorry\nno so what i want you to say is i'm\nsorry for crying and it's\nokay for me to be apologetic for\nsomething that i shouldn't\nbe apologizing for you just cry just\njust sit\nhere\nyou want a tissue or something yeah i'm\ngonna get one\nsorry\nlet's see if she figures this out\nall right okay\ni'm just going to stand up for a second\nokay so before\nthis is civilian so before before um we\nhad our interview you know i was telling\nyou i like to connect with twitch chat\nso someone asked a question in chat what\nshould you do\nwhen someone starts crying and then i\nwas telling them that you have to learn\nhow to sit with it and then someone in\nchat was like can you stand with it and\ni was like yes you could stand with it\nand it's just a little but yeah yeah\nit's it's\nso what what are you feeling now what\nwas why did you start crying\num\ni felt sad and then i felt embarrassed\nand then i felt\nand then i felt um when i said sorry i\nfelt\nbad about that and then i felt\nso i need to say sorry again and i felt\nbad about that\nyeah it's like it's it's it's the whole\ncycle yeah and what are you feeling now\num\num\n[Music]\nuh giggling yeah right\nso so i think i think so you you know\nyou asked me earlier what do i do about\nthat\nand this is exactly what you do about it\nyou kind of like huh yes absolutely\nright\nright so like you sort of like recognize\nthe absurdity of it\nand then all you can do is sort of laugh\nyou don't fight against it you don't try\nto change you're just like\noh look at how crazy that is that's\nridiculous\nand that's actually the first step so\nthere's a there's a funny kind of\ntradition in zen buddhism that when zen\nbuddhist masters become enlightened the\nfirst thing that they do\nis laugh yeah and it's because they\nrealized that all this work that they\nwere doing was\nnever necessary yeah\nand so as best as you can just kind of\nnotice it\nand and just be like okay like because\nat some point i think something magical\nhappens when you\nstop apologizing and judging yourself\nis you wind up laughing you're like well\nyeah nothing i can do about that\nlol right\nyeah and then what happens is i know it\nsounds kind of weird but like over time\nas you\nlearn how to do that and the things that\nyou're and then what's going to happen\nis the judgment is going to start to\nmelt away\nas you learn how to like you're\naccepting it because you're saying oh\nyeah\nyou're not trying to change anything\nyou're just sort of saying like okay\nlike\nthat's ridiculous like that's not gonna\ngo anywhere well\nand then you move on with the rest of\nyour day and every time you do that\nevery time you become\naware of the cycle the cycle actually\nstarts to break apart a little bit\nand it's the cycle that i think is\nreally causing you\na lot of suffering and it's a cycle that\nyou've been\ndoing for a long time sounds like you\nknow 20 plus years\num the other thing you know is that\nyou know a lot of times we'll talk for a\nwhile\nlike we would be sort of like a little\nbit past the halfway point\nbut i'm noticing that you've actually\nmade i think you've discovered a lot in\na very short amount of time\nyeah and so i'm gonna do something a\nlittle bit unorthodox which is i'm gonna\ngive you the option to sort of stop here\nlike if you feel like this is enough for\nyou to kind of process and it's not like\ni want you to pick one or the other\nbecause i still have a lot of things i\nmean you said earlier that you know you\nfeel the safest when you're working and\nthat's just\nthat's just too juicy for me like you\nknow like\nlike i have to ask you about safety and\nall that i mean there's a lot of stuff\ni'm still super curious about i think\nthere's a lot to learn\nbut at the same time i'm noticing that\nyou've been through a lot\nand you've kind of discovered a lot in\nlike a relatively short amount of time\nand and i want to give you the chance to\nkind of just put a pot hit the pause\nbutton and kind of process and work\nthrough that\nand then maybe like we can revisit down\nthe road\nwhat do you think keep going or um i\nwant to talk more for some reason yeah\nit feels nice\nokay tell what do you want to talk about\num i feel let's save this when i'm\nworking\nokay so tell me tell me about\nwhat what tell me about feeling safe\nwhile you're working\num i think\ni think it's just i think i feel safe in\nthe marketing because\ni feel like um i'm progressing every\ntime i work\nit's like oh i'm progressing and i'm get\ni'm doing\num it's helping in some way and then um\nevery time i'm not working i'm like\ni feel like all my stuff that i worked\non like it's like falling apart\nbecause i'm not working um\nand i always like i'm like and i always\ni'm like oh\nbecause i spent these two hours hanging\nout with my friends\nnow my\nnow uh i'm less ahead than i would have\nbeen if i spent those two hours\nworking and i know it's wrong and so i\ncorrect myself in my brain but\ni have like why is it wrong\num because it\nshould be it's totally fine for you to\nhang out with your friends\nis it though oh it's not\ni don't know i'm just saying that no i'm\njust i'm i'm genuinely trying to\nunderstand what\nwhat you think um\nlike because i mean every time you hang\nout with your friends you're you're\nfalling behind\ni thought like you could be working yeah\nit's like it's like\nlogically i know like it's totally okay\nto hang out with your friends\nbut like my negative spiral cut like my\nnegative thoughts always like kind of\nlike\nlike go in and then i start and then i i\nalways feel\nlike that weird feeling in my stomach\nand then\num and then like once i've got\nonce i'm back working once i'm back\nprogressing\nthen i feel like better\nand i have this issue like with um not\njust friends but with family too\nwhere like um\n[Music]\nlike i feel bad about spending time with\nthem like i i want to\n[Music]\nlike i always have this desire when i'm\nworking oh i want to spend time with my\nfamily i want to spend time with my\nfamily\nand then when i when it gets to the\nspending time with my family\ni start feeling like all that again and\nthen\ni'm not i'm no longer like there paying\nattention you know and i'm just like\ni need to work and it's like it's really\nweird because like\nin my mind i'm like oh no i shouldn't\nfeel this way it's not right\nlike i can't help feeling it um\nand then when i get rid of that\nit sounds really like you're kind of\nstuck like\nif you work then you're kind of missing\nout on your family but even\nif you try to spend time with your\nfamily your mind automatically goes to\nwork and doesn't even let you enjoy\ntime with your family yeah that's the\nsame type of thing i feel with\nfriends as well like um\nyou mentioned guilty earlier when you\nwere hanging out with friends is that\nwhat you mean by guilty\num guilty guilt is like when you feel\nlike\nyou're\nwhen you do something wrong right and\nthen you feel good about it\num oh yeah i think so\ni was just a feeling how do you feel\nwhen you hang out with your friends\num anxiety\nwanting to go back to work um\nalso feeling like um i'm not\ndoing i'm not doing a good job\nperforming as a friend like a little\nlikable person as a friend as a caring\nperson\num yeah i judge myself a lot\ni'm noticing yeah you do and\nwhy do you think that is\num\nbecause i always feel like i'm not good\nenough yeah right so\nso then then the question becomes why\nwhy do you feel like you're not good\nenough\ni think this is like patterns of my life\nwhich ones help us understand that um\nyou know the things that happen in\nchildhood\num you know when like\neven when i like made friends\nthey left without it being our faults\nat all like we never got into fighter\nwith circumstances\nand then um\nalso like with my with the past\nwork that i had like in career as well\num\nthey always kind of made me feel like i\nwasn't good enough even when i did a\ngood job\nand um\ni think one of the uh i think one of the\nbiggest reasons as well is also like\num\ni guess\ni had some relationships that made me\nnot feel\num good enough to\nsince i i was like i did have a\nrelationship when where i was cheated on\nand that was like\nnot cool sure\num i can imagine that i i know\num you'd expressed a you know boundary\nthere so i'm going to just try to infer\na little bit\nyeah just because you shared something\ncan i just work please\nyeah go for it uh\nit's workplace stuff as well whenever i\noutperformed i was\nlike i had a in my opinion\ni mean i don't know if i should go into\nthis either because\num i think i would school very simply\nlike whenever\ni outperformed at work\num whenever you picked up a stick\nwas never i don't know like\nit was i don't know if i should go into\nlike how sure i was treated\nin my last job i i want you to in my\nlast few jobs\nwe're gonna pause for a second so you\nknow one of the really important things\nabout these conversations\nis that they're supposed to be on\nbalance for your benefit\nand so i certainly don't want you to\nshare anything that could negatively\nimpact your life in some way\nyeah yeah so if you want to maintain\nrelationships with people\nso i wouldn't talk about that if that's\nyeah yeah yeah i think we've got plenty\nso let me i can try to infer a couple of\nthings okay so one is that\nyou know when it comes to a romantic\nrelationship and getting cheated on\ni can imagine that that would feed\nthis cycle that you have of your head\ntelling you\nyou're doing good enough and it's not\nyour fault and then some of the business\ndown here\ntelling you like like i can imagine you\ntalk about this conflict that you have\nwhere like up here you tell yourself\nit's enough i can hang out with my\nfriends i do a good job i should be\nproud of what i do\nand then like in here and then in your\nstomach you've got these other feelings\nthat are like no\nit's not good enough like you're not\nactually doing a good job like anyone\ncould do this\nand i can imagine that your romantic\nrelationships\nfeed that fire of your head telling you\none thing\nand then your stomach telling you\nsomething else yeah\nand so you feel safe when you work\nworking is nice yeah it feels nice to\nwear\nwhat feels nice about it um\ni'm doing this i'm doing something that\ni love um\ni also feel like like if i\nfor some reason in my head like i also\nhave like these thoughts of like\ni can't depend on other people\nbut i can i i know like i can\nlike i think i have like control it's\njust when it comes\nlike i can control my work i can make it\ngood\num you don't have control issues\nyou don't know how to trust people\nbecause all of your friends have\nabandoned you\nyeah i mean i don't mean to be like too\nblunt about it but like\nyeah right\nand and i i think when you say control\nissues what i think that probably means\nis that you have\nyou feel like you need to have be in\ncontrol of every little thing\nwith your work is that what you mean by\ncontrol issues oh actually no\nno actually no actually you're right\nit's not it's not really\na control issue i think what you what\nyou said was more\nokay correct it's more that i feel safe\nin my work because like don't\nnever leave i guess um\nand also like i just can depend on it\nbecause\nit's just me myself i guess\nand um like i can\ndepend on the fact that if i do like if\ni work hard\nthen i can make something awesome\num and like it'll be there for me\nand then um yeah i guess that\nand then what's like people it's like\num i i guess i don't think you can\ndepend on them to be there for you\ni think that's like the feelings like\nthat i think\nyeah i mean i thought you said something\npretty profound when you said your work\nwill be there for you\nyeah right\nsounds very safe to me yeah i like\nworking\nokay so let me ask you a quick question\nso you know you said earlier that you\nit feels good to talk so i don't know if\ni should ask you more questions or\nshare like maybe a little bit of a\nhypothesis\nor try to explain to you what i'm\nhearing what do you think would be\nbetter\noh i want i would love i would love to\nhear your thoughts\nokay so i think it's tricky\nbecause i i think you're one of these\npeople who genuinely enjoys their work\nand finds it gratifying\nyeah yeah\nand\nit is doing things for your psychology\nthat i think are holding you back\nso the mind does this a lot where like\nwe'll find one thing that works for us\nand then we'll do it to access and then\nactually like\nhurt ourselves in the process like for\nexample i like playing video games\nand if i'm not careful i really\ngenuinely love video games like i think\nthey're so much fun and i really enjoy\nplaying them\nand but if i'm not careful what i like\nabout video games is if i have a hard\nday at work i can play a game and have\nsome fun and relax\nget some dopamine spend time with my\nfriends\nand it's like a genuinely like positive\nand fun experience\nand i can also use video games as an\nescape\nyeah right i can start to rely on them\nto like\nturn away from some of the things that i\ndon't like about my life\nand i'm hearing sort of the same thing\nfrom you about your work\nthat there's a lot of genuine pride\nthere's a lot of genuine fun\nthat a lot of times when you work it\ndoesn't even feel like work\nyeah which is awesome and you're lucky\nand you're grateful and all that good\nstuff\nand at the same time\nwork is a safe place that allows you\nto not face certain things\nbecause those things are painful\nwhat do you think um\nyeah i agree\nso what's painful outside of work what\nfeels unsafe\noutside of work\nlike you mean like my feelings\nsure um\num i would see the feelings i feel\nand the negative thoughts that i get\num\ni would feel i would say that that feels\nunsafe\nare there particular thoughts that you\nhave outside like so like i'm\nenvisioning a particular day where\nyou know maybe someone messages you and\nthey're like hey do you want to hang out\nand then in this in your mind or in\nyourself in your whole being you have\nthis little war\nwhere there's some thoughts and feelings\nthat are telling you one thing\nand then what happens is you're like no\nno no i'm gonna work instead\nand then like everything kind of calms\ndown and you feel safe\nso what was it that scared you back to\nwork in that moment\num i usually think whenever someone asks\nme like\nhey do you wanna hang out i go to my i\ngo to like my work first\ni'm like i really do want to hang out\nbut i have to do\nthis this and this and this and this if\ni don't do these things and i'm gonna\nfeel bad\nabout it and i know that when i'm\nhanging out i'm just gonna be thinking\nabout those things to do\nand feeling bad about it and then so\nbut then like in principle or like\nlogically i'm like but i should hang out\nbecause\nit's good for me\num i guess because like\nthe feelings that i get i don't\nwant to even do my mind i'm like you\nshould\ncan i think for a second yeah\n[Music]\ni'm gonna drink some water too yeah\nwater\nokay you know this is going to sound\nweird okay\nmaybe a little bit unsatisfying okay\nbut unfortunately i actually have an\nanswer for you\nokay so i think i know like how to fix\nthis i say this rarely because usually\nthings are complicated and i usually am\nwrong\nbut for whatever reason i don't know if\nit's just because you've been really\nreally open\nyou shared that story like really early\nlike i think you've been incredibly\nauthentic\num i think you're also incredibly\ninsightful and even your subconscious\nmind is like working to solve these\npuzzles for you like you came up with\nthat story about the stick\nthat you picked up which i think is like\nthe best story to help us understand\nwhat that feeling is like when you try\nto rise up and you say to life\nno i'm not going to take the [ __ ] that\nyou give me life is like uh-uh\nsit the [ __ ] down right like when you\nget a friend your friend is like\nadios i'm going to japan and you can try\nto contact me for four years and you'll\nnever hear from me\nand oh you have another friend and it\nturns out that their parents are\nreligious fanatics and they can't see\nyou anymore because you listen to music\ntogether\nhow dare you yuda yeah\nright so that's the story and so it\nmakes sense\nit makes perfect sense to me that you\nhave the feelings that you have\nthat you carry around this idea that\nyou're not good enough\nthat work feels safe because you can\nrely on it because it's a computer and\nnot a human being that's going to\nabandon you\nright yeah and so like i i get that it\nfeels safe\nand i get that like there's a logical\npart of you because and that\nwe're going to try a couple of\ninteresting\nmeditation exercises in a second okay\nbut i think basically what i see is that\nyou have these negative feelings\nand you're being controlled by them and\nby controlled by them i don't mean that\nlike you're crippled with depression\nwhat i mean is that you'll do anything\nto avoid\nthose negative feelings and you try to\npush them down through logic you try to\nconvince yourself\nyou tell yourself oh i should go hang\nout with these people and when you go\nhang out with those people then those\nfeelings come up\nand then like you can't even benefit\nfrom hanging out with people and so they\nall like\nif you go hang out with people the\nfeelings are going to come up right\nyes the only way you can get rid of the\nfeelings\nis to workaholic\nyeah there are going to be other things\nthat i think also\nget rid of the feelings which oddly\nenough is going to be like really\njudgmental towards yourself i think they\nactually make the feelings go down\nwhich i know sounds weird what do you\nthink about that\nthat's interesting i would like to know\nso when you beat yourself up what\nhappens to the feeling in your stomach\nand i beat myself up\ni'm not sure what do you mean i know it\nsounds weird we'll we'll explore that\ndown the road but anyway let's not worry\nabout that for now\noh okay so the main thing though is that\nwhen you work\nit calms down the feeling right there\nare so many things that you do\nto calm down those feelings and those\nare the things that make it hard for you\nto live\nlife does that make sense\nlike you you you you exclude\nportions of your life because spending\ntime with your friends and family brings\nthose feelings up\nyeah so it's the avoidance of that\nfeeling that keeps you from living life\nbecause you can live life with the\nfeelings or you could\nforget about life and be a workaholic\nand then you don't have to worry about\nthe feelings\nyeah so oddly enough your answer is very\nsimple\nyou have to just learn how to sit with\nthose feelings and accept them\nsee if you can tolerate that feeling it\nno longer needs to control you\ni see yeah okay so now i'm gonna try to\nevoke those feelings and you are you\nready\nokay okay and we're to teach you how to\nsit with them\nand i'm going to teach you a meditative\npractice that will like help you work\nthrough them\nand i i suppose i should ask for\npermission first because i said i'm\ngoing to do this thing but i don't know\nif you really want to yeah yeah\nokay i assumed you were but at the same\ntime you seem a little bit like oh [ __ ]\nthat's what i saw in your eyes there for\na second\nhow are you feeling i'm curious\nokay sit up straight\nyou can cross your legs if you want to\ncan you sit cross-legged\nuh i'm good like this okay wait do i\ni like like this like yeah you can sit\njust your back should be straight oh\nokay like this\nthat feels like do you mean like the the\nthis thing\nyes yeah yeah yeah yeah my feet are\ngonna show\nokay i guess that's\ni don't know what the significance of\nthat is no because\nbecause the tos says you can't show feet\noh the tio says no they're saying you\ncan't show me\non twitch i have t os ptsd\nokay i don't know about any of that but\nif the tio says you can't show feet then\ndon't show your feet\nwe can't talk to you about this i'm sure\nreal ptsd\nptsd this is the first time i've ever\nheard of tio they didn't teach me about\nthis at\nharvard medical school\nso i think another big\ni think okay so like i've been banned on\nthis platform three times\nokay and um\nso this i'll talk about the second and\nthird bands\nokay um\nbecause it's i it's legit it's a legit\npiece\ni dream about it um\ni dream about this but like okay so\nthe first band was because i had\nthis feature i programmed this feature\nthat i thought was funny\nwhere i said a dollar for d\nso when someone sends me a dollar a\nletter\nd will pop up on my virtual character's\nphone\nand um i thought it was f\ni thought it was a funny joke because\nyou know like you get the joke right for\ndr\nj i i i the dollar for d\nmeaning a dollar for dick okay so like\nso like the the joke is like\nbecause dollar for d is like um it's in\nit's like kind of it's funny because\nlike\nyou think it's like a dick pic but it's\njust a letter d\nthat pops up in your phone and it's like\nhaha it's funny anyway\nanyways it was supposed to be like a\nfunny joke thing um\nbut i got banned for that and the\nreasons was that i was soliciting\npornography\nand um soliciting pornography\nthat was their reason you got something\non your lip maybe\nyou can't tell oh yeah um\nsoliciting pornography and then\num yeah that one that one\nreally like like\nuh i cuz like that one that one i think\nreally like\nmessed with my brain because i was\ni kind of know i i i don't think i was\nsoliciting pornography\nwith the joke i thought i was soliciting\na joke\num but i think like\nin my mind it just\nokay so my third band i'll talk about my\nthird band\nmy third band was because um\nso i had i do this interview type\npodcast\ni bring up the streamer in my world\nand we talk about things and one of the\ntopics that we wanted to\nget into talk about was sexual\nharassment towards female\nstreamers and she told me she collects\nemails and messages and she has it in\nthe folder and she\nyou know she shares it on her stream and\ni asked her if we can show it on my\nstream and she was like\nshe was totally okay with it because we\nwere on the topic and i wanted to talk\nabout\nfemale sexual harassment because i\nthought i think it's an important topic\num so she sends me a screenshot\ni pull it up i read it\nwe discuss it she sends me another one i\npull it up\ni read it we discuss it\nunfortunately that second screenshot had\nthe person's first and last name and\nemail on it\n[Music]\nand that's what got me banned\num\nand like i was i couldn't figure out\nwhat it was because\nwhen i got banned um like i couldn't\nfigure out why i got better my like\nwhen i got banned because um\nin my mind like i didn't do anything\nwrong\num but then when people when i was told\nwhat happened i was like oh that makes\nsense because\nlike at when i was showing the\nscreenshot\ni never thought oh this is like a real\nperson and i'm doxing a real person\nsure you know in my mind they think\nit's a hate mail it's not it's obviously\nusing like a username alias like that's\nthat's kind of the thoughts i have in my\nhead right and\num but\ni guess i think like that whole\nexperience of getting back three times\nwhen\ni myself didn't see myself as a toxic\nstreamer\nlike but\nit feels like it feels like because i\ngot banned three times like\ni must be a toxic streamer like i must\nbe\num not wanted on the platform and i\nthink\nit kind of just reiterates like my\npattern\ni guess of like i try really really hard\non something and you get punished for it\nand i get punished for it and like\ni have i have ptsd because i dream about\nit because like\nthe last dream i had it's kind of funny\nthe last stream i had\ni wanted to get pizza and i had a pizza\nflyer\nand i showed my chat the pizza flyer\nthat the owner's first and last name and\nnumber was on the pizza flyer\nand then i showed it to chad and i got\nbanned for it\nand i was so upset in my dreams so\nso you know i have to be honest with you\nso first of all\nyou know just so people are aware okay\nso\ni don't even know what to do with this\nbut let me just let me give this a shot\nokay\nfirst is i i i i've never heard of tos\nptsd before but sure as hell sounds like\na thing\num you know it's interesting because\nwhen we look at the features of ptsd\nhypervigilance and nightmares are\nactually two parts of it like they're\ntwo parts of the diagnostic criteria\nso i think you know you know we toss\naround the word ptsd a lot or the phrase\num yeah i think you know i haven't sort\nof said this yet but\nit's so bizarre that you're talking\nabout tos ptsd but\nyou know you may actually i don't know\nif you see a mental health professional\nbut like\ndepending on what's going on here like\nyou may actually want to get evaluated\nbecause\nyeah in the event that you actually have\nbecause i mean you seem to be saying i\nreally have ptsd over this and i know it\nsounds kind of absurd but\nthat you know just the little parts that\nyou've mentioned you know do make me\nthink that it's warrant\nit's it warrants getting an actual\nevaluation i've never heard of something\nlike this before\num but you know there are\ntreatments if you have real ptsd\nyeah and and if you're if you like think\nabout it a lot and it's kind of\nintrusive in the nature of its thoughts\nif you have\nnightmares about it and and things like\nthat like\ni know it sounds so bizarre that's so\nsilly i know it sounds\nso silly but\nyeah go ahead sorry no\nno no no it's just i feel like it's so\nsilly because like\nlike the pizza flyer story like if i if\ni talk about it it's funny\nlike it is a funny story like why would\nyou dream about that but like\nso it kind of also makes me feel um\nit just makes me feel really silly and\nyeah so you know i want you stupid i\nwant you to really hear what i'm saying\nbecause\nyou feel silly and stupid and this is\nthe first time during the conversation\nwhere i'm telling you that this could be\na real thing that warrants actual mental\nhealth treatment\nokay right so i'm telling you like i\nknow it sounds bizarre i mean it sounds\nbizarre even to me\nbut the whole so one of the actually\ninteresting hallmarks of my\nclinical experience of working with ptsd\nis that\nfrequently people think that things are\nsilly or stupid to the outside world but\nit affects them in a really profound way\nright and the most simple example i can\nthink of is like people in abusive\nrelationships\nwhere they're like oh you know it's like\ni know this is silly and stupid i feel\nso dumb but my\npartner hits me every time you know i\ndon't make the food right\nit's i just i'm so stupid it's so silly\nand that's like actually what they'll\nsay and\nand so i know it sounds bizarre but this\nis the kind of thing where first of all\ni'm a little bit dear in the headlights\nbecause i\ni don't quite know i have to think about\nthat for a little bit\ni feel like it's a whole other can of\nworms\num i i do see what you're saying in\nterms of like there's a common theme\nhere about you\ntrying to assert yourself in some way\nand you kind of get punished for it\num at the same time you know it does\nmake sense to me that you got banned if\nyou\naccidentally sure it's an accident and\nthis is also where like we have to be a\nlittle bit careful because you have this\ncomplex within you that sort of thinks\nthat you're not good enough and this is\njust\nand it can take advantage it can use\nthis\ntos kind of stuff is like fuel for its\nyou know like\nenergy for beating you up and judging\nyou yourself\nand at the same time um\nyou know i i think that part of\nunderstanding the appropriateness of the\nban\nis in recognizing that the reason that\nyou're not banned\nor the reason you're banned is not\nbecause you're a toxic streamer or i\nmean arguably that could be\nviewed as toxic it sounds to me like it\nwas a genuine mistake\nyeah that twitch appropriately sort of\nsays this is not acceptable behavior and\nyou need to be super super careful about\nthis\nyeah so this is also where from a\nbehavioral standpoint i kind of think\nabout especially\ntemporary bands is is and i don't really\nknow because i don't talk to twitch and\nmaybe i'll feel differently\nyou know inevitably i guess one day i'm\ngoing to get up and i'm going to walk\nout i mean i i'm not wearing socks or\nshoes right now i wear flip-flops\nand so if i leave the room i guess my\nfeet are going to be visible that's fine\nthat's okay it's unless they interpret\nit\nas being sexual but like\nmost people won't\nokay so i'm it's only it's only when\nit's interpreted as being sexual that\nwhen it gets\nso i i mean this is another discussion i\nguess i'll have to ask our account\nmanager but like\nso i'm indian and i sit in yoga postures\nand as part of my culture we do not wear\nshoes or socks really in the house like\nindian people go barefoot a lot\nyeah you find as long as it's not being\ninterpreted as being sexual\nso if i sit in a yoga posture like\nbadmasan which is the lotus posture\nwhich buddha sits in\nis meditating and you can see his feet\nand all the statues about buddha\ndo you think that's something i can get\nbanned for\nyou know but if you are a sexy hot lady\nthat was like you know i had a lot of\nbooba\nand um bubba means boobs\nyeah okay a sexy hot lady with boobs\nmaybe like that's\nwhy it's inter it's all the\ninterpretation like okay i mean\nyou know i i get it because you got to\nkeep the coomers at bay but\num you know i i was just okay thank you\nfor educating me because i\ni sit cross-legged on stream i mean like\ni'm sitting cross-legged without socks\non right now it's just you can't see\nthem\nyeah but okay so so it's just i guess\nit's about the sexuality of it\nyeah yes the sexuality of it uh\nand i mean i was advocating that you sit\ncross-legged\nnot out of any sexuality but just\nbecause i know the reason that\ni sit cross-legged just because i think\nit's a good meditative posture\ni know don't worry yeah yeah yeah yeah\num anyway\nso i'm gonna have to think about this\ntos ptsd thing\ncan i have some time to process like i'm\nserious i'm not i'm not trying to\nname about it yeah it's just like i just\nit's just so silly\nlike i don't even think i don't know i i\nhave like for example\nlike when you are telling me to get\nmental health check out for ptsd\nmy first thought went to will i get\nbanned for that because\nthen you know will twitch see me as like\na legal threat\nand would i get banned for that no\ntwitch is actually very supportive of\nof streamers like taking care of their\nmental health\nokay so then what if i they see me as\nlike a legal threat or something\nokay so this is where i can't i can't\nspeak for twitch but\nbut you you know we have a we\nwere like healthy gamer works with\ntwitch yeah\nbecause twitch actually cares about your\nmental health\nand so we like literally have a program\nwhere twitch will provide you with\ncoaching through healthygamer\nso if you want to work with one of our\ncoaches\nwho works specifically on issues like\nimposter syndrome\nburnout and now like i have a meeting\nwith all of our creator coaches today\nso these are coaches who work\nspecifically with streamers\nand content creators so you can sign up\nfor that program and actually like\ntwitch is paying for it so they care\nabout your mental health like very\ngenuinely like i'm not\ni'm not saying this because it's an\nadvertisement for them i'm saying\nbecause like\nthey're actually you know they seem to\ncare about it\nand they're working with us and in our\nexperience which is like really positive\nand now with our in our meeting with our\ncoaches today i'm going to bring up tos\nptsd\nand ask them to talk to their clients\nabout do you guys have ptsd over being\nbanned\nbecause it sounds like it could be like\na common issue actually\nand if so we'll try to figure out what\nto do about it i think my issue was is\nthat\nlike it just keeps on making these weird\nsilly\nthings in my brain like for example when\ni want\nlike oh like can i get banned now\nbecause\nif i seek mental health um\nlike stuff for it does that make me like\nelite like you know how that those\nconnections\nare kind of silly but like i make them\nyeah so so i think that's a it's a\nreasonable connection though so when it\ncomes to getting mental health treatment\nthis is what i would\nadvocate is that like you know that's a\nprivate thing\nso like you should like when i say that\nyou know there are particular bounds\neven around this conversation that like\nthere are a lot of things that if i was\nactually your therapist i think would be\nreally important to discuss\nyeah such as diagnostic criteria for\nptsd i would evaluate for that\ni i you know other things would be like\nreally digging into romantic\nrelationships because that sounds\nimportant to me but like\nhere in a public discussion about\nanxiety and some of the things that\nhappen in your mind that's not really\nappropriate\nyeah um i don't think that they're going\nto think you're a threat in fact i think\nit's sort of like\nyou're taking care of your health right\nbeing yeah you know\nyeah i really don't think so that i\nhaven't gotten i mean i can't speak for\ntwitch but\ngenerally speaking the response that\ni've gotten from them is overwhelmingly\npositive and supportive\nthat they recognize that you guys deal\nwith a lot of hard stuff and they're\nactually going out of their way\nto support content creators on the\nplatform\nthat's been my experience yeah um i also\nknow\nthat like twitch even provides discounts\nfor therapy and some so\nsomething that my account manager sent\nme so you have some information there\nwhich you can talk to your account\nmanager about but\num so i think they actually do a fair\namount cool\nand i can't imagine that they would\npunish people for you know they're like\ntrying to provide you\nlike trying to oh no me saying that was\nmore of me\njust telling you that i think it's silly\nthat i oh i see that's the\nexample of an irrational thought yeah\nyeah yeah got it\ngot it um so i was trying okay that\nmakes sense yeah so it was just\nlike these irrational thoughts always\npop up in my head\neven when i'm streaming um\neven when i'm like making content all\nthese irrational thoughts just\npop up and make weird connections and\nit's been\nlike one of the biggest things that's\nbeen kind of\nholding me back from like who i was\nbefore\num when i perform on twitch\nand it's something that i've been like\nreally frustrated with\ncan i think of can i just process for a\nsecond yeah\ni'm gonna use the restroom real fast\nokay don't show your feet\nso chad is any anyone else\na little bit offended on my behalf that\ni won't get banned for showing my feet\nbecause apparently i'm not sexy enough\num one second sorry i'm saying\nokay uh once again what's up once\n[Music]\ni can't hear you now\napparently i'm not sexy enough chat\nmy mic's still working though\nno i mean it's weird right i i guess\ni guess coopers will come to anything i\ni don't i really don't i don't\nunderstand this at all\nbut okay i mean gotta live and learn\nand one of the best educational tools on\nthe internet is the band hammer\nif you guys haven't you know\ni still don't entirely understand what a\nkumar is\nby the way\nyeah so you know at some point we could\ntalk about lust like i don't mean like\ni mean because it's you know to step\nback from the memes but to be all\nyou know serious like the satisfaction\nof desires and\nexploring lust and and sort of managing\nsome of your feelings whether it be lust\nfor food lust for\nmore sexual things\nimportant topics very important\nokay i'm back i'm back okay welcome back\nhey so um\ni i i'm gonna have to think about some\nof the stuff more you know\nyeah yeah um you know i think\ni think there's something really\nimportant that you just said about\nwho you were before and the thoughts\nthat you have that keep you from being\nyourself\nlike it's almost like they you know it\nsounds like they're very intrusive\nand kind of disruptive and dominating in\nterms of like\naffecting you it's not just a thought\nthat comes and goes it's like you're\ntrying to live your life and then\nthis thought comes in and it kind of\nreally disrupts your\nyour joy and tranquility i also\nfeel like i also feel like a bit\nlike i don't have control over my work\nas well anymore because\num in a way because sometimes i work\nreally hard and then i'm like\noh i like i'm probably going to get bad\nand so like\nwhy am i trying\nlike i i have these irrational thoughts\nthat like always truly pop\nup and i think it's just kind of it's\nlike it's just been a pattern of my life\nand it's like it's like whatever\nit's like whenever i take control of\nsomething and do really well on\nsomething\ni get knocked down and\nand like\num it's just it's like\nit's i recognized like that was like\ncompletely my mistake even if it was an\naccident\nbut i just for some reason i always get\nmyself into these situations even if\nit's an accident even if i don't mean to\ndo it\nthat always just kind of like\nhappens yeah um\nso you know i think this is really a\ndifferent\ntopic because i know this sounds kind of\nweird but so\ni i wanna so i think that there are some\nweird\nprinciples from spirituality about\ngetting yourself in\ninto situations and then also learning\nso they're learning how to not get into\nthose situations\nyeah and and i know this sounds weird\nlike we're kind of we tend to take a\npretty like we've taken a pretty\npsychological approach today in terms of\nthese patterns and what you think about\nyourself and not being good enough but i\nthink there are also\nother dimensions that you can work on\nthis\nlike in terms of cultivating the right\nkind of shakti\nor energy that's s-h-a-k-t-i\nwhich is the sanskrit word for energy\nthere are certain practices that you can\ndo certain things that you can do that\nsort of cultivate a particular kind of\nenergy\nand it's not really scientific really\nat all but um i do\nfind that taking that sort of approach\nabout you know what am i sort of putting\nout into the world and being very like\nthoughtful and careful about that\ncan actually help people but that's a\ndifferent dimension so i think that\nthat's a discussion\nabout how do you avoid getting yourself\ninto those situations\nwhich i think you can absolutely avoid\ndoing now\nthat's the big caveat there is that you\ndon't really control\num you know you can't really control\nwhat the outside world does you can't\ncontrol what twitch chat does you can't\ncontrol\ntwitch it does but there are certainly\nways of cultivating particular things\nand sort of setting yourself up for\nsuccess that's kind of one angle\nthe second angle is sort of helping you\ndeal with\nwho i am who you were before and what\nhow these thoughts\nhave really shattered that how can we\nhelp you find a place of like\npeace and tranquility where you've\nlearned from your mistakes\nyou're going to be careful about not\nmaking them again\nand also like those mistakes haven't\nshattered\nwho you used to be because what i'm\nreally hearing is that they've really\nremapped\nthe way that you think about situations\nand the way that like you exist\nin the world which sounds very\ndevastating to me\num what do you think about that\num\nthey as in like the situations that\nhappen in my past the thoughts\ni would say really the thoughts that are\nintrusive\nyeah um\ni'm hearing that you can't be yourself\nanymore\nyeah i\ni think like\num i think it's just that i get to\ni get influenced\ntoo easily by\noutside situations that's like like for\nexample like i have\na hard time recovering from things that\nshouldn't be that big of a deal i guess\nokay\nthat makes sense sure it makes a lot of\nsense so here\nhere's what i'm gonna say at this point\nso you know i think we\nuncovered a really really important\nunderstanding of a little bit about how\nyou work\nespecially in like the first hour of the\nconversation\nand i feel like we're opening up a\ncouple of doors and i'm a little bit\nhesitant because i feel like\nthere's a lot of like there's some\nimportant lessons which i'd really like\nto\ndrive home with you yeah so that you can\nstart to make progress\nwith like spending time with your\nfriends and family yeah\nand if it's okay with you all table\neverything else yeah\nyeah and teach you a little bit of\nmeditation yeah\ni i don't mean to say that this stuff\nisn't important it really does sound\nimportant but i think like let's\nlet's try to work on one problem at a\ntime i told you i have so many issues\nyou did i have so many issues\noddly enough i i think a lot of your\nissues are related this\nptsd tos stuff sounds different to me\nthough\ni think that's related though because\nit's\ni have like i think i have\nmore pt i think i have ptsd for my\nbecause\nof situations that happen in my past\nlike okay\nbecause the thing is is that i think\nit's the whole like\nit's a whole like i because i work so\nhard on my stream\nlike it's my entire life literally the\nthings that i've created is literally\nlike my entire life and\nit's something that i thought i finally\nhad control over\nand you know the dollar for d\nthing i could never i just i just could\nnot\nforesee that one and like\ni just in my mind i could not foresee\nlike that a letter d\nwould be it would equate to pornography\nas me selling pornography like it just i\njust i still to this day\ni still have i still have trouble making\nthose links\num and like\ni think it's just that these\nso like in my mind that situation wasn't\nreally\nin my control like in my mind that's\nkind of how i see it\nhow i show it and um\ni work like my stream is my life and i\nput so much into it\num and now i'm already on my third band\nand i feel like it's\ni just feel like you know again this\nis probably gonna be taken away from\nfrom me\num and so that's severe like worry and\nthat's severe like\num just anxiety\num i think that's what's causing\ni don't even know if it's ptsd oh like i\njust have dreams\nabout getting banned a lot um\nin different situations i didn't mean um\nit's always like\ni do something that i completely didn't\nrealize that i was doing\nat the time and then and then hindsight\nthey\nthey tell me oh like the pizza flyer\nthing oh you had the owners first and\nlast name and number on there but\num and so i\ni think it's just that it's just like a\npattern\nof my of my life that i've been dealing\nwith where i\neven with something that i feel like i\nhad\ncomplete control over and was doing\nreally well and\num can be just taken away from me\nand will probably be taken away from me\nconsidering\nall the things that happened\nsounds like it's almost inevitable\nwell that's why i convinced myself which\nis bad\nbut um that's just kind of what i\nconvinced myself\ni like what you did there what\nso you said that's what i convinced\nmyself of and it's bad yeah\nyou didn't say i shouldn't do it\ndid you notice that i don't know if you\nwere thinking it but\njust right there you sort of just stated\nwhat you felt without judging yourself\nfor feeling it\nyeah which i think is progress\nbut i'm also seeing that this is like\nvery feels\nreally really important to you and\ni i'm i'm getting a sense of\nyou know the train is coming down the\ntracks and you're kind of stuck on the\ntracks kind of thing\nthat no matter what you do that this is\ngonna happen\nit's just like a it's just a pattern you\nknow\nit's just i even like now when i feel\nlike\ni'm doing really well and i'm\nin my mind i'm like in my brain i'm like\noh\ni think i'm i'm successful or\nnot successful but it's i think i'm\ndoing really well\num i tell myself i\nshouldn't enjoy it because it's gonna\nhurt too much when it's like\nripped from me\nit's hard to live life where your two\nchoices\nare to try to protect yourself\nand forgo living or to enjoy yourself\nand be punished for it\nit sounds really tough you know\ni just i kind of just i don't know i in\nmy eyes kind of justify as like oh it's\ngood because you shouldn't be\nthat successful i don't know\nmy my brain works in a weird way\nmy brain is a weird place i know it\nlooks weird and contradictory\nbut one of the things i've come to\nappreciate about our minds is that\nthey're actually\nquite logical they just have their own\nsystem of logic\nwhich sometimes we can't see\nso i'm going to ask you in the last few\nminutes that we have do you want to\ncontinue talking or would you rather\nlearn\nmeditation\nwhat is your recommendation mr dr\nk my recommendation would be that you\nlearn meditation\nbut what i'm picking up from you is that\nyou still have a lot more to say\nso i think ultimately it's i have so\nmany issues\nso so this is where i e you know i kind\nof say this and sometimes people think\nthat i'm doing this as kind of a\ndisclaimer or whatever but i\ni really think uh you know you could you\nshould either sign up for our\ncontent creator coaching program or\num and or go see a mental health\nprofessional and just sort of get\nevaluated\nand and they may be able to help you\nwith social anxiety or ptsd or things\nlike that\num and you know i say this as a\npsychiatrist like i\nyou know i think it would be very\nappropriate for someone like you to come\ninto my office\nand say hey here's what i'm concerned\nabout and like i think it's very\nreasonable and an appropriate thing to\nexplore about whether this is\nyou know really ptsd or not yeah\num and in terms of meditation i mean i\ni think that meditation is good because\ni i'd like to teach you\na practice to learn how to sit with\nyourself\nand especially sit with those negative\nemotions so that you don't have to work\non them but i'm sort of feeling like now\nit's kind of artificial\nbut i mean the meditation but anyway\nit's okay\nbut so if you really want to learn i'm\nhappy to teach you\nwait why is it artificial i felt like it\nwas a lot more appropriate before we\nopened this other thing up\nand it feels a little bit distant to me\nfrom the current topic of conversation\nthat's all\ni see\num but it is still like the same type of\npattern\nsame pattern same same thing okay so sit\nup straight\nokay okay so\nwhat do you close your eyes for a second\nokay and what do you feel in your body\nhunger okay\ni just realized i'm hungry okay\nokay sorry yeah okay\nreally hungry okay so\nso okay then you know we're gonna we're\ngonna\nnot do this okay okay so this is this no\nno\nthere's nothing to apologize for i\nactually didn't\nyeah so i want this to be a really\nreally important lesson that that i want\npeople to take away\nso meditation is wonderful it's great\nall that good stuff i'm a big fan of it\nthere's\nscience that suggests it helps with ptsd\nit helps with anxiety\nand also sometimes it's not the right\ntime to meditate\nyeah and if you get really really sleepy\nwhen you meditate\nif you're really really hungry rather\nthan\ni know it's kind of ironic because what\nwe're trying what i was about to try to\nteach you\nwhat how to do is to you know sit with\nsome of the feelings that you've got\ninstead of giving in to them\noddly enough i think you should just go\nand eat something\nand and like like honestly like just do\nwhat your body and your mind sometimes\ntells you\nlike you learn how to resist some of it\nand some of it you just gotta you just\ngotta eat something\nyou know because you woke up this has\nbeen intense you've been at this for two\nhours you've been crying off and on\nexploring a lot of stuff\nit's very energy intensive so i'd say\njust\ngo eat okay i'm sorry\nno it's fine i feel like i i feel like i\nruined this interview\nvery careful with my language you i had\nan\nexpectation and a hope which you have\nthrown a wrench in and one of the most\nis that bad\nyes oh but there's a big butt\nso this is the other really important\nthing that i think it's really important\nfor you to learn yoona\nis that it's okay to ruin stuff\nright like this is the big lesson that\nyou've got to learn is like\nif your stream is not perfect it's okay\nif you say something and you're with\nyour family like if you go and hang out\nwith your family\nand you feel like you're distracted by\nstream\nand work and stuff like that that's okay\nso what i want you to do is learn how to\nbe okay like\nwith i mean you didn't like the\ninterview was incredibly productive i\nthink it was incredibly educational\nand all of the important things that we\nneeded to accomplish i think we\naccomplished\ni had this other expectation because i\nhad a really good meditation technique\nbut i just don't think sometimes\nsometimes it's just it's not gonna work\nwhich is fine\nright that's life and that's an\nimportant lesson that we have to learn\nhow to let go of our expectations\nand then like the second time this rolls\naround we'll do it again and then we'll\nteach you meditation\nso remember that life is going to send\nyou some things on its timeline\nand like you just have to respect that\nand if you're hungry\ngenuinely speaking from the bottom of my\nheart to someone who's been teaching\nmeditation for almost 20 years\ni'd say you need to go eat okay\nokay okay thank you are you judging\nyourself\nno i was i'm just\nthen you've made me happy and you've\nmade the interview worthwhile\nyay okay\nso best of luck to you i i as i\nunderstand uh\ni may actually wind up on your show\nsometimes yeah\nso i'm really looking forward to that\nthat'd be so\nfun yeah i'm i'm so i don't know what to\nexpect but i i think i'm we're gonna you\nknow\ndo it around it'll be really fun\nokay great um okay cool so\nthank you so much for coming on take\ncare of yourself\nand then you
