    "transcript": "this is the first time when people\ncouldn't hear jacksepticeye\nand everyone rejoiced um\nall right so you go by jack right yeah\njack's fine\nand is there something in particular\nthat you want to talk about today\num not really specifically we i did talk\nto\nbrandon about it and i was talking about\nkind of the idea of parasocial\nrelationships and things like that but\ni mean kind of everything that this job\nsort of entails is fine with me\nyeah absolutely um so you know my staff\nasked me\na couple of questions and i got this\nquestion a couple of times they're like\ndo you want to know what's going on with\njack and i was like no\nand then they were like like two or\nthree people ask me they're like do you\ndo you want to know what's going on with\nhim and i'm like no right\nand is that something we should talk\nabout whatever is\ngoing on with you or is it sure\nno i mean the the roughest part of it is\nkind of past\nwhat happened was that my father passed\naway like\nthree weeks ago oh my god um yeah he\npassed away at the end of january so\ni've been taking\ntime away from youtube and streaming and\neverything since then\num and i've done one update video on it\nand talked a bit about it just to let my\naudience kind of know where i was and\nwhat's been going on but thankfully like\nthe the sort of grieving hump\nis that i'm coming off the other end of\nthat so i'm in a better place mentally\nnow than i was and i'll probably be back\nto making videos and stuff\nnext week i think uh okay okay\ni assume that's what is going on with me\nunless they know\nsomething else about me that i don't\nknow i mean it sounds like that's the\nkind of thing that\nyou know it sounds like it's affected\nyou uh\ni mean affected in the sense that you\nknow it sounds like you've taken a step\nback from making content and stuff\nyeah i i took time away last year to try\nand\nlike reevaluate who i am and what i want\nto do and\nwhere i fit into the world um and i\nthink this is another to hear more about\nthat\nyeah we can circle back to that for sure\nit was definitely a very formative\ntime in my career but i think this i was\ngoing to take some time off in january\nanyway\njust because it's slow and i don't know\nvacations are good\nbut then this sort of like forced me\ninto a sort of break\nof sorts um but i wanted to make sure\nthat i took the time to do it and i feel\nlike i'm in a better place mentally\nwhere i don't feel like i have to be\nalways on and give the audience what\nthey need or want constantly and being\nable to take that time away and\njust kind of say fu to everybody else\nand take my time for myself\ndoes that require an fu when you take\ntime for yourself\nno no i'm being a little dramatic and\nhyperbolic about it um\ndefinitely for some people some people\nneed kind of like the harsh like no i'm\nleaving\nand you need to be okay with that for a\ncouple of weeks\nbut most people have been extremely\nsupportive about it okay\num yeah so what do you want us\nuh thank you for sharing that with me i\ni didn't uh i mean i guess in a sense i\ndid mean to pry\nit's just it was strange like i don't i\ntry to actually talk to people sort of\nblind\nin the sense that um i think when when\nwe don't talk to people blind it's\nquickly to get it\nit's really easy to get into like drama\nusually is what it is\nlike something is going on and like it's\nlike i don't really\ncare about that you know right um\nso so but if it feels important to you\nwhat i'm hearing from you is that you\nknow something really unfortunate\nhappened i'm assuming that you view it\nas unfortunate\num which is a pretty big assumption but\nand that you've\nkind of worked through it you feel like\nyou're in a pretty good place and and\nso i'm not hearing a whole lot that\nneeds to be talked about there\num probably not i mean we can go into it\na little bit um\ni guess just uh because i don't feel\nlike i don't feel like it really happens\ntoo often\nin the online community you don't really\nhear about this sort of thing happening\nfairly often and um i think sort of to\nowe it to the legacy of my dad it's nice\nto kind of\nremember him in good spirits and kind of\ntalk about him in a way\nso i talked about him a little bit on my\nchannel before and i've\ni've never been hugely close with him\ngrowing up and\nthere's always kind of been a distance\nto it but i think having something like\nthis happen it's nice to sort of\nlook back on it fondly and it's sort of\na weird thing\nthat when you're in this position you\nit's a thing where you kind of have to\ntell people that it's happened\nbut at the same time you kind of want to\nkeep it a bit more private\nbecause i need to let people know to not\ngo poking when i disappear for\nthree weeks yep to leave my family alone\nand to leave me alone and to kind of\nrespect the boundary\nof what has happened and you kind of\njust need to tell people up front\ninstead of leaving any sort of ambiguity\nin the air because\nfrom my experience that just makes\nthings worse yeah so\nit's interesting because i'm noticing\nthese two threads kind of weave together\nbecause\nit sounds like we're starting us sort of\nskirting on parasocial\nrelationships we're skirting on um\nyou know pressures of being a streamer\nand how\nyou sort of don't i've worked with a\nfair number of streamers and one of the\nthings that really shocks me is that\nmany of y'all you know are privileged in\nmany ways but that you guys don't get to\ndo things that normal people get to do\nright in the sense give me an example\ngrieve in private\nlike you have to give people an\nexplanation to like\nwhat like you know most people don't\nhave to give\nyou know the rest of the world an\nexplanation when they like go off and do\nsomething\non their own for like two weeks yeah\nit's it's a really strange phenomenon to\nhave to do\nyeah um and and one of the things that\njust keeps popping in my mind is like\ni was talking to someone who was and i\nsort of joked that\nif they post a picture of them eating a\ntaco people will get upset with them for\nbeing like\nanti-hot dog right now i have this\nfeeling a lot and it's it's kind of\nskirting between am i an [ __ ] or is\nthis like\nmy life now where i go out and you see\npeople look at you and then the first\nassumption is do they know who i am\nand then the part of me that kicks in is\nlike well\nwho do you think you are thinking that\npeople should know who you are but then\nit's kind of\nsomething that's happened in such a\npattern that it's hard\nnot to kind of fall under that\nassumption and then when i'm out eating\nat that moment where i'm i'm getting\nready to eat my food i'm like how do i\neat food again\nhow do humans eat food normally do i\nlook weird\nare they gonna like talk about how i ate\nmy food weirdly or what i ordered and\nthings like that it's such\nit's a weird sort of circus that goes on\nin your brain when these things happen\num yeah i\njack it's talking about those kinds of\nthings which is why i love doing what i\ndo\nbecause what i'm hearing from you is\nthat like your mind\nis doing all kinds of stuff that\nbecause of your life it's been trained\nto do which are like not\nnormal things yeah right and and so\nand and i really also really get excited\nwhen i hear people sort of talking about\nlike\nwho they are like i i like talking about\nthe stuff i like\nexploring kind of what the true nature\nof self is\nand yeah me too and and i i kind of\nnoticed because\nbecause of the way that the the examples\nthat you used about oh like\nam i someone like who am i to be someone\nlike what does that mean to\nbe someone and to not be someone i mean\nat the end of the day you [ __ ] just the\nsame\nas everyone else and you know so it's\nnot really like you're a different\nperson but it can sometimes feel like\nyou're a different person and\nhow do you navigate that um right so we\ncan talk about you know the circus that\ngoes on in your head too\num\ni love the way you describe that too so\nwhat where do you want to\nwhat do you want to start with do you\nwant to start with and i wasn't really\nsure whether you wanted to\nsay something a little bit about your\nfather or talk about that or we should\njust skip over it and\nyou know get to taking a break or a pair\nof social relationships or what\nyeah i think i think the video i\nuploaded on my channel kind of speaks\nfor itself\nthe things that i wanted to share and\nthe sort of legacy that i want to live\nis it's a bit more internal than i want\npeople to know and i think the sort of\nprivate matters of it\nneed to stay private personally i think\nthat it's\nit's good not to share too much with\neverybody all the time\nyeah um and not just skirt over it\nbecause i'm like avoiding it or anything\nlike that\nbut just uh i've said my piece you're\nallowed to avoid it\ntrue um but i think i've talked about it\nenough and\nokay i feel like i i've i've dealt with\nit in my in my personal time so\nperfect um i'm really happy to hear that\nyou know if that changes\num you know just a couple of quick\nthings just about grief for you and\neveryone else\ni lost my dad about nine years ago\nand i was really surprised because\nwhat i really felt was that i didn't\nneed a whole lot of support when it\nhappened\nbut i found myself like missing him\nat kind of random moments over the next\ndecade\nand and it was sort of like there's all\nthis support for the first month\nand then like what i really needed is\nthat support sort of spaced out over the\nnext decade\nand so yeah i've sort of realized that\nin this sort of\nbusiness as well especially is that a\nlot of people are there\nin the like hyper intense moments and a\nlot of people will say a lot of things\nin those moments but i've come to\nrealize that a lot of the people in my\npersonal life\nand a lot of people who i consider\nreally close friends you can really tell\nthe merit of their character during\ntimes like this\nbecause i've had some friends say\nsomething immediately and then check in\na week later and then check in a week\nlater\nand that that meant a lot more to me\nthan everybody just rushing to sort of\nget social points\nimmediately and i noticed that\nin some regards a lot of people took it\nupon themselves to make it about them\nwhich was a again it's something that i\nkind of knew already but i've never been\nthrough something\nso intense like this that it became\nsort of a writing essay for some people\nto sort of\nsay who could give the best condolences\nbasically and who could be\nthe better person at being sorry for me\nand then i just become a character and\nsort of a\ncast member outside of what their\nconversation is\nand i that was something that i just\nwanted to shout out all the people\ntrolling on it and shut out all the\npeople just going way overboard in the\nother direction and it was\nit was everybody in the middle who were\ngenuine about it that i really\nappreciated the most\nwhat i'm hearing is that you became a\nsidequest\nnpc for them yeah and i\ni feel like that's what happens to a lot\nof streamers you become a character in\npeople's lives rather than a person\nthat's something i've always strived to\ndeal with personally but also let\nremind people that i am a human\nunderneath everything and i'm not\nsome weird character in your sort of\nfantasy i'm not an anime for you to\nwatch and\nfawn overall all the time fawn over\n[Laughter]\ni'm trying to increase my lexicon i've\nbeen watching a lot of ludwig\num yeah so what how okay\nso let can we actually just go back to\num\nyou know you said you took some time off\nlast last year to try to figure out who\nyou are and\nwhat you wanted can we talk about that\nyeah sure\num yeah i think for a long time i was\ni experienced some like really shitty\nyears on my channel and then sort of\ngoing through the motions and you\nyou kind of hit this well perceived peak\nof what you want to do what you want to\naccomplish and it's all about growth\ngrowth growth all the time and\nsatisfying your audience and then you\nkind of get to a point where that\nhits its peak um and you kind of feel\nburnt out and you're doing the same\nthing and i\ni felt like i kind of became a\ncaricature of myself that i\ni do these things and then people\nrespond to certain aspects of it so i\njust double down on those because that's\nwhat people\nreact to yep and doing that for so long\nand getting into that cycle i just\ni kind of got tired of my own [ __ ] and i\nwas making stuff\nthat i wasn't fulfilled by my audience\ncould tell they were just showing up\nbecause it was the same time every day\nlike uh\nit's like the same reason people watch\none piece for so long they're sort of in\ndenial about how long it's going on and\nhow samey it is\ni care after a while i can't get into it\nman\nyeah i just got into naruto and i'm\ntrying to like hold out on that and\nthat's a\nthat's a bear to take on as well it is\nit is\ni've been working on naruto now for\nprobably about 15 years and yeah\nyou know one episode at a time yeah\nbut one piece is a completely different\nmountain to climb\nyeah um yeah just going through those\nmotions for a while and then\nwondering where i kind of fit in with\nmyself and then\nat this big moment where i thought well\ncan i exist\noutside of my channel and outside of my\nnumbers and outside of this perception\nof what people think of me and\nwho even am i beyond jacksepticeye\nanymore\ndoes me as a person as shawn even exist\nor the two so melded together that i\ncan't\ndifferentiate them anymore and i took a\nmonth off to kind of\ni i thought i was going to quit i\nthought i was done with everything\nbecause i just\ni kind of got tired of doing the same\nstuff over and over again\num it took a lot of time i got into like\nstoicism\nand read up on a lot of books about like\nmarcus aurelius and things like that and\nhow to deal with\njust yourself and how to deal with other\npeople in a healthier way\nand it helped me a lot and i started to\ncome to some realizations after\nreflecting for a while that i i can't\nexist\nas both and i just need to take the\nright amount of time\nfor each and set healthy boundaries for\neach and now\ntrying to get over kind of the\nperceptions of what other people think\nabout me\nversus how i actually act based on that\nfeedback\nand realizing that i can't live my life\nfor everybody else\nthe feedback they were giving me i\nrealized that i would react to that and\nthen try and do that\nand correct everything that was going\nwrong according to them\nsure um and so i wasn't really living\nfor me anymore i was kind of living for\nwhat other people wanted me to do and\nthen it was just so many different\nvoices so many different opinions that i\ncouldn't i couldn't accurately\ndo what everybody wanted because that's\njust impossible so it's something that\ni've kind of dealt with for a long time\nis kind of being a people pleaser and\ntrying to get over that\num do you want help with that\nsure so how long have you been a people\npleaser\nprobably my whole life i think because\ni'm the the youngest in my family and\ni've\nuh two older brothers and two older\nsisters i think that i was always sort\nof the\nwhenever things got tense i feel like i\nwas sort of the comic relief\nof the family to try and like break\ntension yeah and make sure that\neverybody's\nokay um but i think doing it my whole\nlife i think i started to realize that i\ni didn't value myself anymore i didn't\ncare about my own opinions i just cared\nabout what other people thought about me\nand i've gotten a lot better at it over\nthe last year but i think there's still\nevery now and then something will happen\nand it'll kind of like hit that nerve\nin me that i need to kind of like get\nover again\num i don't know it's a bizarre thing\nyeah so let's learn about that sure what\nwhat is the what is the nerve what is\nthe nerve that they hit\njust worrying that i've upset somebody\nor haven't\nmet somebody's standards or haven't\ngiven somebody\na good time because it's it's never been\nabout me it's always been about our\nis somebody else having a good time yeah\nand getting into this job i think\nhaving so many other people to try and\nplease after a certain point\nyou realize that you can't please\neverybody which is also cliche and\nobvious\nand people say it all the time but it's\nso hard to actually do\nso\njack are you okay if i like take a cup\nso first\nthis is fantastic i'm i'm really happy\nto be having this conversation\ni i think it makes me so happy when\nso i spent many years like studying this\nstuff formally and i think it is the\ncoolest thing in the world when\ni meet someone who just threw personal\nreflection\nhas like understood so much of like what\ni spent like\ntime studying and it really just makes\nme\nit reinforces in my mind that like there\nis no substitute for personal reflection\nand that you can read all the books in\nthe world but ultimately all of the\nknowledge that you need is actually like\nwithin you which sounds cliche too\nand so if it's okay with you what i'd\nlike to do is\nis i think one of the things i can do to\nhelp you on your journey\nis just to expand your lexicon and and\nkind of\ntie like sort of button down a few like\ndifferent kinds of concepts and nuances\nwhich i think you already understand\nbut may not have language for and i\nthink it'll help you become\nmore versatile and like dealing with\nthese things and understanding these\nthings\nlet's go so so the first is that in\nsanskrit there are two words for\nknowledge one is vidya which\ngets translated as objective knowledge\nand is also like\ninformation and transmissible okay\nand then the second is nyan which is\nsubjective knowledge\nnot transmissible and oddly enough\nin the west we tend to value vidya over\nnyan\nlike we tend to say that unless\nyou know you can prove it to me so\nscience is all about vidya for example\nso like science is about knowledge that\nother people can gain from your efforts\nbut yogis and i would dare say marcus\naurelius\nvalued nyan more than vidya and what\nthey realized is that ultimately\nsubjective knowledge is superior to\nobjective knowledge okay\nand so you know when you say like this\nstuff sounds really cliche\nbut this is where i would call vidya\ninformation\nand nyan understanding and so we can say\ncliche things and they sound cliche but\nthat's from a video perspective\nbut once you understand them from a neon\nperspective\nthey actually start to shape your\nactions and\nshape your thoughts instead of being\nlike a fact that is philosophically or\nintellectually or logically true\nit becomes like a reality in your mind\nwhich then alters the course of your\nlife\nokay um and so\nwhat i'd really like to explore with you\nis i i think you've gained a lot of neon\nover the last year or two and sort of\nlike exploring kind of what that is and\nwhat you've discovered\num but what do you think about those\nkind that differentiation of\nof knowledge between these two types\ni think it makes a lot of sense because\ni think well maybe i\nmaybe i'm not right in saying this but i\nfeel like the stuff that i've\nsort of gotten into over the last year\nyear and a half is sort of more\non the spiritual side of things um\ni'm trying to get and trying to get in\ntouch with that stuff because\ni've always been like a very scientific\nminded person\ni'm not like the smartest at it but i\nalways love the sort of\nlike machinations of how things work and\nespecially people i love\nseeing how people take how they work i\nlove observing like body language and\nhow people react the way they react\num but that's all maybe that's like the\nobjective\nside of things and i i really like\ngetting into sort of\nthe weeds of how people's brains work\nand why everybody's different but the\nsame\nand things like that so i think what\ni've just\ni think i've sort of broadened my mind\nin the last year to realize that\ni i can't control everything and the\nreason i react certain ways to certain\nthings is because of the value systems\nthat i've kind of put on them\nand then somebody breaches those value\nsystems in my mind so then\nthey're that's bad and you shouldn't do\nthat but what i've\nstarted to get better at is realize that\njust do whatever the [ __ ] you want i\nwho am i to tell you or to react that\nway like just go live your life and i\nlive my life and hopefully we\nwe meet somewhere in the middle yeah so\ni love the way that you talked about\nvalue systems and how so other i have a\nfeeling we're going to cover a lot of\nterminology today okay\nso um so this is also where like buddha\nbuddha talked about something called\nwhich is suffering it's the sanskrit\nword for suffering\nand what he said is that the root of\nsuffering is actually attachment to\nexpectation\nand so what i'm hearing from you is that\nyou know\nsomeone would do something and then it's\nthe value system that you\nimpose upon it that causes you the\nsuffering\nright and so it's it's a really radical\nway to look at life because what that\nsort of posits\nis that suffering or contentment is like\nactually yours to control and that when\nwe let other people\nwhen we when we so far i mean most\npeople\nactually seed control over their their\nwell-being to the people around them\nbecause they fall into those value\nsystems\nright and when you start to step away\nfrom those things or notice that your\nyour reactions to the thing is actually\nwhat causes you the suffering\nthat's when people start to move towards\nthis\nconcept called enlightenment which is\nsort of the stepwise process\nof of eventually getting to the point\nwhere like\nyou have essentially no reactions\num for as a scientist i'll also kind of\ndifferentiate for a moment that\ndukkha is different from pleasure and\npain so you can still experience\npleasure\nand pain both with duke\nbut it sort of operates on a different\naxis it's not like the same thing\nokay so it's not that you're it\nimpervious to pain\nit's that you're impervious to suffering\nif you become enlightened\nbut if you imagine if you're enlightened\nand you give childbirth like you have\nchildbirth you'll still be in a shitload\nof pain\nright um so\nany thoughts about that concept or how\nthat relates to kind of your\nself-reflections\nyeah i think it makes a lot of sense um\ni\ni think sort of the way i i was\na while ago was that and i think this\nsort of falls into the parasocial side\nof things as well that\ni've i did things for a certain amount\nof time and then so many people told me\nthat i was right or i was smart or\nyou do this but this other person does\nthis and you're so much better than them\nfor doing it this way\nthat i feel like that sort of worm got\nin my brain\na while back and it was as much as it is\npraising me\nand it's it's great at the time and it's\na compliment\nit was putting down the other person and\nit essentially built me on this platform\nhigher than they were in their brain\num and i feel like for me after a while\nof hearing that\ni i couldn't really tell\nwhat it was doing to me anymore and\ni started to realize like both extremes\nof like the negative and positive\nspectrum can influence your brain in\nnegative ways\ni think yeah i i was about to say i i\nthink you may not have known what that\nworm was doing to you there by the way\nthere's a sanskrit word for that worm\ntoo\nwhat is it ahamkada\nokay i'm gonna forget all of these\nthat's okay so ahamkara is\ntechnically translated as the i feeling\nso it's the feeling of like i i am\ndot dot dot oh i thought you said like\neyeball i\noh no and and it gets loosely translated\nthe closest word that we have in english\nis ego\nright but it's not just ego so like the\nahamkada has a couple of like\ninteresting attributes\nanything that compares you to another\nperson is a hum god is the eye feeling\nokay and and so um the other key thing\nyou know if you listen to buddha is that\nahamkar even though it makes you feel\npleasure is always going to be a source\nof duk\nokay what do you think about that\nyeah that makes sense yep like i said i\nthink you understand all this stuff i'm\njust going to give you terminology for\nit today\nwell it's good to reaffirm it as well\nand kind of hear it again so you kind of\nstay on the path\nand and i think that your your neon is\nvery very clear to me because you used\nthe word\nworm right and and so this is like it's\nsuch a beautiful word for a honk gun\nbecause it kind of like burrows in and\nyou don't really notice\nits negative effects and as you pointed\nout you feel\ngood in the moment right like it's\npleasing for your ego\nand then like but once it like kind of\nburrows in like it starts like doing\nthis weird kind of damage\nyeah like you know what i mean oh yeah\nfor sure\ncan you tell us a little bit about that\nwell i i was gonna say i feel like it\nhappens to a lot of people\nin this industry um and the\nself-awareness kind of evaporates after\na while and the humility kind of\ndisappears\na lot of times through no fault of their\nown because a lot of people just tell\nyou that\nyou're amazing and when you become\nsuccessful at doing that and people tell\nyou you're amazing you tend to think\nthat your way is right\num and then any sort of criticism or any\nsort of feedback\nbecomes an attack and then i i found\nmyself getting very defensive about\nthings in the past\num maybe not publicly but definitely\nwhen somebody said something about me\nonline it's like\nwell who do they think they are without\nand then it's like wait\nwait why am i reacting that way yes\nit's not it's not a good way of reacting\nto things so i'm gonna tunnel down into\nthat for a moment so a criticism becomes\nan attack\nso what i want you to notice there is a\ncriticism is directed at who\nall right what i should say\ni mean for me it would have been a\njacksepticeye and not\nme as a person sort of exactly right so\nlike\nlike and i think that's the attack part\nso what i was going to say is that\nsomeone can criticize let's say a piece\nof content that you make\nright but when the hum car is strong\nit's not\nyou don't you take that attack on your\ncontent and you it turns into an attack\non you\nright like does that make sense yep like\nthey're not actually criticizing you as\na person but when the ahm god is strong\nyou sort of like taunt their aggro and\nthen like it's pointed to you as a\nperson\nand that's why they use a hum god is the\ni feeling so if you think about it\nyou know you inject yourself into their\ncriticism\nyeah um which is good so it's it's it\nseems like you've learned how to\nnot do that yeah i mean it crops up\nevery now and then\nbut i think i've gotten a lot better at\nlike ego checking myself\num and kind of stopping that trail of\nthought before it becomes like i\nremember in the past it would be a lot\nof like\ni need to tweet out something and tell\neverybody because this one person\nonline said something so then i ended up\nthinking that everybody was saying this\nabout me or if four people said it\nand it's like well everybody's talking\nabout that now and then you have to\nlike respond to it but i think i've\ngotten a lot better at just not\nresponding to it and letting it kind of\njust sit\nin the ether um and realizing that\nbecause it became this weird thing where\njacksepticeye became this like being\noutside of me and outside the audience\nit was like everybody was watching this\nother entity\nthat i didn't even have control over\nanymore because the community kind of\ntook it upon itself\nto build it into whatever they wanted to\nand in some ways that was good but\ni think the feeling of me as a person\nseparate from that kind of\num evaporated yeah so this is where\njust to give you once again a little bit\nof a structure\nwhich i you know isn't true it's just\nfor you to consider\nway against your experience and then you\nbe the scientist\nand conclude what you want to so one is\nthat ahamkar\nand self-awareness are at opposite ends\nof a spectrum\nokay so the more egotistical you become\nthe less self-aware you become\nand furthermore that i think the your\nawareness\nat one point was completely absorbed in\nthe identity of jacksepticeye\nand that you felt a lot of suffering at\nthat time and the more that you've been\nable to externalize\njacksepticeye the more you've been able\nto separate who you\nare from the character i think the more\nat peace\nyou'll become yeah for sure about that\nokay i think there was a lot of there\nwas a lot of fear in the past of\nseparating them because then\na lot of people tend to think that oh\nwell what you're doing is jacksepticeye\nis fake then because it's a character\nthat you're playing and essentially it\nis because it's a persona\nit's like the best version of me that i\nwant to show the world\num and it's me and my zone and it's me\ngoing to work and doing what i do\num and i always worry that if i talked\nabout separating them and setting more\nboundaries\nthat people wouldn't think of what i was\ndoing as genuine\nanymore which it obviously is i don't\nthink i could do this for this long\nand be this excited about what i do if\nit was all an\nact and so i know this is going to sound\nweird but\nwhere does that fear come from\ni don't know so that comes from the\nahamkar too\nbecause if you think about it what are\nyou afraid of you're afraid of how they\nwill perceive you\ndo you see that yeah and so like all\nthat crap\nalways comes back to the amkar okay how\nthey will see you\nand so like it's sort of like you were\nafraid of separating from the ahamkar\nbecause then like they would see you a\nparticular way but that right\nthat fear is a hum guard does that make\nsense yep\nand so it's it's weird because like it\nfears for itself it fears for the\ndissolution of itself\nit warns you against abandoning it\nokay what do you think about that\nuh could you go into it a little bit\nmore yeah\nso like i i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut\nyou know you were afraid of what people\nwould think of you\nright but that thought in and of itself\nso like the reason you're not separating\nfrom\nyour k like like jacks up there's\njacksepticeye and then there's the real\nyou right\nand when you were thinking about\nseparating the real you from\njacksepticeye\nsomething in your mind warned you\nagainst it\nand it said jack don't do that because\nif you do\nif you separate the ego from your true\nself\nthen what will people say about you they\nwill say you are not genuine\nbut that thought in and of itself is\ncoming from the ahamka\nright so it's sort of like you know an\nabusive person telling you\nnot to break up with them because you'll\nalways be alone\nright yeah it's getting kind of weird\nand abstract but like\nit's just interesting that you know i\nthink a lot of your thoughts the more\nthat we tunnel down into this\ni think a lot of what is going to have\nkept you trapped is going to be that\nuh-hum god\nlike a lot of your hanging out and stuff\nyeah for sure\nany questions so far no\ni think you've been very good at\nexplaining things how do you feel about\nthe direction of this conversation\nit's great i love it okay this is the\n[ __ ] that i live for\nokay um yeah i think uh like i was\nsaying earlier sometimes people will\nsort of have an\nexpectation that if someone has gone\nthrough something like losing a parent\nlike\nwe're gonna you know cry and talk about\nyour dad and all that kind of stuff and\nyou know i'm sorry to disappoint which i\nknow once again is like what people come\nto dr k to see\nyeah and so even right now i have a\nlittle bit of a struggle within me about\noh should i ask him about things that\nare like\ndeeply emotional and then oh jack to\naccept a guy's gonna cry\nand then it's gonna be a really good\nmoment everyone's gonna love it and\nthere's gonna be lots of hearts in chat\nyou'll get\nyou'll get your clickbait yeah\nabsolutely right and so\nsometimes what we have to do is like not\ngive in to that thing\neven though that may lead to more growth\nbut what are we here for\nwe're not here for growth yeah that's\nthat's one of the things that i\ni think a lot of the burnout that i've\nfelt about my own channel was also\nfeeling burnout against\nother creators at the same time i think\nit was like burn out against\nagainst the system in a way the way\ncertain people react\nto the way the system works like the\nalgorithm or whatever\nterminology you want to use for it that\ni think a lot of people show a certain\nversion of themselves but then when it\ngets down to it it's very it's a very\ninsular sort of\nthing that's happening on youtube all\nthe time is that everybody's kind of\nfighting for themselves\nand if they have a chance to get more\nviews out of something they'll go for\nthat and i\nfor a while it felt like everyone was\nkind of like climbing over each other\nof course not everybody's like that\nthere are some very good genuine\nkind-hearted people there who are just\nthere to have fun\nand i've tried to sort of vibe with them\nand kind of\nmagnetize myself towards them more and\nget surrounded by those types of people\nbut i think\nit's just something that no one really\nwants to talk about how everyone's kind\nof like\nfighting each other just to get to the\ntop and then it's like you get to the\ntop it's like well\nwhat's there like what are you aiming\nfor it feels like this sort of\nidea of growth is kind of leading people\nto nowhere\nthat you get to the top and then what\nhappens you kind of sacrifice\nfriendships or you sacrifice personal\nhealth and\nmental health and your own time away\nfrom everything and everybody's so\nentrapped in their work and\nalways on and working for themselves\nconstantly all the time\nwhy do you think that people get trapped\nby the idea of growth\ni think just the metrics that were shown\nall the time kind of do it and the\naudience kind of reaffirming that like\noh you're dropping off\nwell last time you got this many views\non something well this time you're\ngetting\nless or this person did the game and\nthey got\nx number but you did it and you got y\nnumber like\nthey're so much better and then people\nhave a fear of they have a fear if they\ndon't stay on this treadmill\nconstantly that they're just gonna fall\noff and they can never get back onto it\nagain and that everyone's gonna forget\nabout them\ni've tried to like i've had a bunch of\nfriends especially after i took that\nbreak\nwho came to me and talked about it i was\nlike no it's the best thing you can do\nlike no one's going to leave you\nif some people will and that's fine\nyou're going to have to just deal with\nthat\nbut i feel like the people who are\nactually genuinely there\nto just have fun and watch your content\nare the people who kind of stick around\nand for me that was kind of a hard\nhurdle to get over as well because i\nused to do two videos\nevery single day for like five years and\ni never missed an upload time it was\nalways the same time every day and i was\nso proud of it\nbut then i became the guy who was\nuploading at the exact same time and i\nwas just so\nconsistent and i worked so hard and i\nrealized that i didn't really want to be\nthat guy\nand just work for the sake of having\nthat title\num and there was more important things\noutside of that\nagain needing to realize if i could\nexist outside of that work ethic\nhow did you realize what was important\num i don't know i think i just\nphysically and mentally got exhausted\nfirst and then started questioning\nthings\nand then uh being in like a really\nhealthy relationship now that kind of\ngives me the support\nand really wanting to spend time in that\num and swim around in that relationship\nand enjoy it and have fun with it and\njust kind of like hang out and do things\ntogether meant a lot more to me because\ni\nwhen i started off my channel it was\nlike trying to find that sort of family\nor that sort of relationship so i dealt\ni dove head first into that parasocial\naspect of it where i\ni craved that sort of attention from\npeople because it was like finally\nlike-minded people who hang out with me\nand we all do the same sort of thing we\ncan all\nit kind of felt like a bunch of friends\nwere showing up each and every day\nand then realizing that that\nthat sort of feeling and that sort of\nhappiness was never going to come from\nan external source and the other people\nthat i had to sort of\nfind it within me and i watched a really\nnice video about like buddhism on like a\nted talk\nwhere they talked about like well why\nare you happy i was like well this\nhappened today\nand you realize well that thing made you\nhappy and that's not a consistent source\nof happiness that\nyou can't have that same thing every\nsingle day so you need to find a better\nway of having consistent\ninternal happiness to try and like i'm\nbutchering it but\nit was that idea of finding more inner\npeace and i think a lot of people sort\nof rolled their eyes at that but that\nwas like fascinating to me\nwhy did they were butchering it\nbecause i feel like they just had such a\nmagical way with words\nand i feel like synopsizing it didn't do\nit justice\nbecause it had such a profound impact on\nme when i heard it\nthat i would like people to hear it the\nsame way and potentially have the\nsame reaction\nso this is where we get subtle so that's\na really wonderful thing\nand at the same time what are you doing\nto the words that you say\ndevaluing them yep and you're comparing\nthem to the ted talk\nright there it is again you see how good\nthey are at explaining buddhism and how\nbad i am\nthere's the aham god so jack if you\nreally want people to hear it i can\nguarantee you that\nwhat you said was like beautifully\nexplained\nand the only thing that got in the way\nbecause you\nknow this right like why do you think\nthat the person giving the ted talk\nunderstands it better than you do true\n[Music]\nand so the only thing that's getting in\nthe way is your own ego\nright so if you've learned something and\nyou have something to share with the\nworld\nthen i know because i know i know you\nunderstand this then just\n[ __ ] share it and for the people that\nare in the frame of mind to hear it\nand are ready to hear it they'll hear it\ntrue and for the people that aren't\nready to hear it they won't hear it\nbut that like you can't control that\nright all you can control is what you\nput out there yeah that's true\nnow if you want to if you want to get\nlike psychological and all that kind of\nstuff then we've got to talk about this\nwhole like craving attention and family\nand parasocial relationships\nbut that's good let's go baby okay it's\ngoing to be a different tone okay i'm\ngoing to ask you like\npersonal questions about feelings and\n[ __ ] like that it's going to be more of\nwhat\npeople you know come here to see sure\nokay so tell me about your family\ngrowing up\num it's a we had a pretty big family so\nthere was seven of us\ntotal um my my dad was\nan older man he was in his 80s when he\npassed\nso he would have been 85 this year so he\nwas he was\nmuch much older than i was\nso there was always this sort of\ngenerational gap to things\nand i think my brothers and my\nespecially my older sister\nthey i feel like they had a stronger\nrelationship\nwith him growing up because he was just\nmore\npresent he was there he he was in sort\nof like his prime years so to speak\num so they always had some sort of\nconnection whether it be\nnegative or positive there was there was\nat least some sort of like emotional\nattachment\nthere that sounds\nkind of sad yeah\ni i've often told people that neither of\nmy parents have never\nverbalized that they love me\nin a way and it's the thing that i can\ntell that they did\nand my dad has always talked about how\nhe was proud of the stuff that i'm doing\nespecially now\nand i can tell that he always like\nworked for his family\nand he was he he definitely deeply cared\nit's just\nhe's an older irishman from a different\ngeneration so he just\ncan't he can't verbalize things\ncamper blaze's thoughts his dreams his\ngoals\nand i feel like that was sort of the\nlegacy that i wanted to\nbring with me to sort of like\nbe that person for him in a way while\nalso learning from that experience\nhow do you mean by that what do you mean\nby that\nbecause i i wonder about like his goals\nand his aspirations and his dreams\nand if he saw enough of the world and if\nhe\nmet enough people or if he i don't know\ni just\nhope that he had fulfilling experiences\nin his life\nand i feel like for me having\nseen stuff like that and somebody who\njust works all the time and works really\nhard and for a good purpose\ni want to make sure that i'm just not\nworking all the time i want to make sure\nthat i take the time\nto let people know that i love them and\nto share my feelings and to\nopenly talk about things and keep up\nwith my family and make sure that i'm\nseeing parts of the world that i want to\ninstead of putting it on the back burner\nand realizing oh there'll be time for\nthat\nlater i want to make sure that i'm not\njust working myself to the bone\ndoing what i do here for the sake of\nwhat other people expect me to do and\nthat hey i might take a month off every\nnow and then and\ngo do whatever the hell i want to do\nit sounds like you've become acutely\naware of the value of time\nyeah probably through some\nthrough some unfortunate circumstances\num and having to go through\nkind of a marathon emotionally to get\nthere but\ni feel like i feel like the sort of\nemotional strength i've come away with\nhas definitely been worth it and i've\ndefinitely matured emotionally\na lot over the last like year or so\nyeah you seem like an absolute beast man\ni was watching\ni don't know about that i was watching\nyou play bloodborne and one shot things\nwith the whirly gig saw\nlike oh hell yeah it was it was the\nfirst time i'd seen your stream and i\nthink the only time i've seen your\nstream\num wow and i was surprised because like\nwhat happened is i someone recommended\nbloodborne to me in my in\nmy channel because i was looking for\nsomething to play good show\nyeah it was fantastic and so then i was\nlike oh like let me just see you know if\nanyone's playing bloodborne\nbecause like you know the game is like\nfive years old now or something right\ni saw you just one shotting things and\nthat's what i think you're doing today\nyou're just like one-shotting [ __ ] like\nleft and right bro\nwell i'll take that your way any day of\nthe week\num so tell me a little bit about uh so\nhow old was your dad when you were born\num late 50s okay\nand how much older are your siblings\nmy oldest sister is mid-40s\nand my other brothers are in their 40s i\nthink one of them is about to hit 40\nor is 40. i'm bad at my family's age\nthat still means that your dad it sounds\nlike was\n40 when he had his first child\nyeah okay and how old is your ballpark\nhow old is your mom like about the same\nage or no she's\nshe's 20 years younger than him and so\nthere's a massive\nage difference between them as well so\nand you said your dad was\n50 when you were born in late 50s yeah\nlate 50s okay so then your mom was\nlate 30s when you were born about that\nyeah\nmid to late 30s and and what do you\nremember about kind of like\ngrowing up i remember that\nmy dad had retired when i was at a young\nage\nit's like one of the earlier memories i\nhave of him retiring and they gave him a\nlamp\nfor retiring like here's years of\nservitude here's a [ __ ] lamp\nand i remember the party for that and i\nwas taking pictures of it on like\npre-digital photographs and i remember\ni remember it was the first time i ever\ngot to have like a camera in my hand and\ni got to take pictures of things and i\ntook about 40 pictures of this\n[ __ ] lamp that were all pointless and\nuseless and\nreally badly shot i would love to say\nthat i had like spielberg's eye at a\nyoung age but i didn't\num but i remember that vividly\ni i don't know why i think it was just a\nturning point and kind of realizing how\nmuch older my dad was than everybody\nelse\nuh or everybody else's dads because he\nwas retiring and their theirs wasn't\num and i remember then the\nwhen he was retired he would always he\nwas like the\nthe stay-at-home dad then i i would go\nto school and\nwhen i come home he would always cook me\nmy dinner and he was always the person\nwho was there\nit was just me and him in the house for\nlike a couple of hours after school\nevery day and i think that those were a\nlot more formative for me than i\nrealized at the time so having him cook\nme dinner every day was always something\nthat i\ni now greatly appreciated realizing\nkind of like all the hard work he did\ngrowing up and when he was retired he\nwas like still\ntaking care of me um and then\nlike 10 years or so ago when we moved\nand it was just kind of like us\nlike to cut a long story short i lived\nin a log cabin in the middle of the\nwoods for like four years\num and my parents lived in one as well\nso i would cook them dinner\nevery day sort of like the cycle kind of\nlike continued\nat that point and i kind of took care of\nthem every day\nbut i i always remember him doing that\nfor me when i was a kid\nwhat are you feeling right now good\nit's nice to remember the good things\nthat happened with my dad and\nkind of recalling all of these memories\nthat i didn't realize were kind of like\nin my brain and then when something like\nthis happens and you're\ni want to reminisce and i want to\nremember and think about him fondly it\nwas like oh yeah these were all\ngreat times and we had some good years\nwhat would you cook uh what would he\ncook you for dinner\nhe would cook me like potato waffles um\ni don't know if many people outside of\nlike uk ireland or whatever would have\nthose and like fish fingers which you\nguys would call fish sticks\nand he would cut me that every day and i\nwould just have a big blob of ketchup on\nthe side of the plate\ni would always say that i went to my\nfriend's house at one point and they his\nmother coke [ __ ] fish fingers i was like\nno my dad's the best at cooking them you\ndon't you don't know what you're doing\nand what would what would you make for\nthem when y'all lived in the log cabin\num a main favorite was like lasagna\ni always cook a mean lasagna and they\nlove that but then\ni when i was trying to like get\nhealthier and like bulk up and work out\nand all that kind of stuff in my early\n20s\ni would cook them like just really\nhealthy like stir fries and\nlike just try and cut out as much fat\nand try and take care of them\nas much as possible because i feel like\nthey were just very\nindulgent because it's just it's easy to\ndo that\nhow did they feel about that i don't\nthink my mother liked it too much\nbecause\nto her it was taking out a lot of the\nflavor but i think my dad liked it\nyeah that's wonderful how did you guys\nwind up\nand you know i know you mentioned\nearlier that there are particular\nboundaries you want to keep in terms of\nwhat's private and what isn't\num you know you'd mentioned that you\nwere pretty happy with what you shared\nin terms of the youtube video about your\ndad so if i\nask anything that it feels off limits to\nyou just let me know and we don't have\nto\nyou don't have to answer okay sure i am\ni find myself curious though how does\nyou know how do you wind up in a log\ncabin with your parents for four years\nor it sounds like you guys had separate\nlog cabins\nyeah it was weird we we sold our house\nand then we moved because my\nmother wanted to get closer to her\nmother so we moved in like next door\nbecause she was in her uh\nlater years as well so we moved like log\ncabins at the time sounded\nlike fancy and it sounded like a nice\ndream sort of getaway sort of thing\neveryone thinks that they want us to\nlive in a log cabin in the woods\nthat [ __ ] is cold you do not want to\nlive in one of those yeah oh i'm with\nyou\ni think it's wonderful to spend a\nweekend in a lob cat\nlog cabin oh yeah i i don't know about\nliving there\nno it was tough i it's like\ni mean i guess a lot of texans can\nrelate right now is that\nmy pipes would freeze every winter and\nthat ice would like come up to the\ninsides of the walls\nall the time so we had to get like a\nstronger heater for the cabin to kind of\nlike make sure i didn't get hypothermia\nyeah\nfor like a year it was really really\nrough with the cold and\ni think that's where i kind of i\nrealized that i didn't want to like\nthis i didn't want that to be my life i\ndidn't want that to be like\nwhat i did all day every day and that's\nkind of where i started my youtube\nchannel\nmaybe out of spite of that sort of\nliving arrangement\ncan you tell us a little bit about what\ninspired you to start making content on\nyoutube\ni i watched a lot of youtube back in the\nday i\ni watched i was playing battlefield 3 a\nlot back then\nand i just got a gaming pc for the first\ntime when i was like 21\nand i was fascinated by i was like how\nare people so good at this and how are\nthey so quick and\ni can't even like figure out how to move\nthe mouse without taking it off the\nthing and i felt like such an old man\nand then i\ni have an upon a channel called level\ncap gaming who still makes content\num a really nice guy and he i was\nwatching him a lot and then one time he\nmentioned that he did it as a job\nthat kind of blew my mind open and i i\nnever like intended to start doing it as\na job it was never my goal\nbut i thought man people do this like\nfull time that's so cool i was like i\nwonder what that's\nlike to do and i kind of got into it and\ni was like well i'm playing games all\nday anyway\nit would be cool to learn how to edit\nand talk over them and i've always kind\nof been\ni've always been fascinated by like\nacting and showmanship\nand things like that and maybe being the\nbaby at the family i\ni loved being the center of attention at\none point in my life yeah but i\nyou keep i kind of got into it that way\nyou keep mentioning being the baby of\nthe family\ncan you tell me a little bit about what\nthat was like for you\num i i don't know quite what that means\nbut you kind of you know you'll\nattribute many things that you say to\nbeing the baby of the family\nright i think it was just something i\nwas told a lot growing up\nbecause i was i was always like a\nminiature version of other members of my\nfamily\nrather than being my own person i mean\nme and my\nthe brother closest to me were really\nreally um\nalike when i was growing up so i was\nalways called the younger version of him\num and i think being the baby of the\nfamily my voice kind of got drowned out\na lot when family gatherings would\nhappen so i kind of like fought to have\nmy place at the table\ni think that's why i've always been good\nat sort of talking\nand like why a lot of my humor is very\nquick and\nand things like that i was trying to\nlike if i said something loud\nand quick and clever then i would be\nheard more than everybody else\nand that feeling of like cutting the\nroom with laughter was always something\nreally fun when i was a kid it sounds\nlike you learned how to be a character\nat quite a young age\ni guess so i am and that you had to be a\ncharacter to be noticed\noh now we're getting into some [ __ ]\naren't we i\nwarned you oh no i guess so i never\nthought about it like that\nright i mean but that's what i mean it's\nfascinating yeah\nthat's what i'm hearing from myself now\nnot that i say it yep\nwhat do you think i think it's\nagain it's fascinating this is the stuff\nthat i love like figuring out and\nrealizing oh that's where certain things\ncome from and i didn't realize i was\ndoing that\nback then but yeah that absolutely makes\na lot of sense now\nyeah i think you were jack's\njacksepticeye long before\nyou created a youtube account no\nprobably most likely yeah he's buried\nsomewhere\nyeah well i don't know about buried\nsounds to me like he's i was out in the\nopen from a young man\n[Laughter]\nand just to also kind of telegraph where\nthis could go\ni think as we explore some of who you've\nbecome jack\nthere may be certain things that we'll\ntalk about which could\npaint things in a possible negative\nlight\nsure okay so if you feel that way\nit's not really my intention to paint\nthings in a negative light but\nin my experience you know kind of like\nyou said you know things are getting\nserious like why did you feel like that\nwas a serious comment\ni think it's just because it sounds so\npsychological\nto put a pin in it that way it's like oh\nokay\nit's like it's like those psychologists\nlike sort of like twist that you see in\nmovies\nall the time where it's like i i used to\nalways make that joke\npeople would say i had a dream last\nnight that i ate marshmallows for eight\nhours i'm like what does that say about\nyou and your father\na lot and i would always just make that\njoke um\nso hearing it that way is kind of it's\nvery profound and i kind of like that\nsort of stuff\nsure so that's a moment of neon\nokay does that make sense absolutely\nyeah\nyeah so that's what we shoot for is\nbecause that's\nunderstanding and then that's gonna like\nyou know it's not just a bit of\ninformation\nthat's the light bulb going off\nsomething landing so um\nbecause here's the concern that i have\nis if we sort of say that you had to be\nfunny to be noticed\nsure what that also sort of means is\nthat you kind of weren't\nyou you weren't given you had to like\nkind of elbow your way in\nyou know and and so what that could\nimply is that like people didn't\ngive you an opportunity to speak\nbecause generally speaking you think\nabout you know the lower you are on the\ntotem pole like the more\nsupport you need from loving people to\nyou know get a seat at the table\ndo you feel um like we're being\njudgmental or anything are you kind of\ngetting that\nkind of flip side of the argument at all\nno i mean i can see why it's perceived\njudgment but if\nif anything it's bettering me as a\nperson and it's helping me understand\nmore about why i am\nthe way i am and i i kind of like that\nand it also reaffirms a lot of stuff\nthat\neven these days if i'm talking in a\ngroup and people don't hear me it's not\nthat i\ni feel like i'm important listen to what\ni'm saying it's just\ni don't like that feeling of being\ntalked over which i imagine a lot of\npeople don't\nbut i feel like that's\ni don't know it hits upon a lot of\nthings that i think are very relevant to\nme as a person\neven today that i'm trying to like i'm\ntrying to undo\nor trying to come to terms with and be\nbetter about and form healthier habits\nwith\nand i feel like you can't do that unless\nyou get into\nthe weeds of it all how does it feel to\nbe talked over\nawful especially when\nwell in in this day and age it's like\nbuffering issues and internet issues and\nall that kind of thing\nit's like you get talked over anyway\njust because the sound kind of cuts out\nand whatnot\nin conference calls but it's i just\ni think that's where i'm de-valuing\npeople talk over you\nthat's [ __ ] stop doing it\ni i feel like that's where\nmy devaluing of my own opinions come\nfrom\nbecause when i get talked over then i\njust kind of like shut down\nand then i stop giving my opinion on\nthings\nokay\nso do you remember times growing up\nwhere\npeople didn't respect your opinion and\ntalked over you\nnot that i can vividly recall there's\nnothing that's like really stands out to\nme\ni feel like maybe i like said a joke and\nno one heard it and that kind of was\nlike oh man i thought that was a good\none\nbut nothing where i had anything of like\nlike profoundness to say and then\nsomebody talked over and they kind of\nlike defeated me\nnow at least nothing comes to mind right\nnow sure sure sure that makes sense i\nthink the real\ntricky thing there is that you know if\nyou were devalued then\nin retrospect you may not think it was\nprofound\nprobably yeah right it's kind of weird i\nthink that's a very irish way of\nspeaking that if you're not heard\neveryone says well it wasn't important\nthen\nyeah oh interesting um\nyeah so let's uh what was it like having\na dad who was like significantly older\ndid you\nkind of feel like because it sounds like\nyou noticed\nthat things were different compared to\nyour friends and stuff like that\nyeah i think i just hearing my friends\ntalk about their dads being at work\ni couldn't really relate to that at the\ntime and also\nyou get a slight bit of ridiculing\ngrowing up i wouldn't say i was like\nbullied about it or anything but\ndefinitely when people hear it it's like\noh it's always like a point of\nconversation\nit's always something that people feel\nlike they have to like yeah\nthey have to like poke further into to\ntry and understand because it's so\nforeign to them for that but for me that\nwas my\nnormality but hearing that it wasn't\nnormal was like well\nwhat's what's wrong with me what's wrong\nwith my family why why is everyone\nreacting to that\ndo you remember when\nyou started how old you were when you\nstarted being concerned about your\nopinion not being taken seriously and\ntalk being talked over\num i think it was more in my teenage\nyears probably\nbecause i think those are very formative\nyears for anybody and\ntrying to figure out who you are in the\nworld and trying to put your stamp on it\nwhich i mean nobody ever does when\nthey're a teenager it's like a\na weird fallacy that everybody talks\nabout because you're taught i saw that\nin school like you need to know who you\nare going into college\nyou need to know like the rest of your\nlife is being set up right now what are\nyou going to be what are you going to do\nit's like i don't [ __ ] know i just\nwant to play metal gear solid and\ncollect yu-gi-oh cards\nyeah um exactly who you were going to be\nwhen you grew up\ni mean i did this didn't exist back then\nso no\nyeah but you are still you i think\nthat's cool right\nanyway i just you know i was just\nthinking it was kind of ironic because\nyou're like i don't know who i am and\nthat's actually exactly who you were you\nknew exactly who you were\nwell yes just realized you could be that\nyeah\nthat's against the norm at the time at\nthe time it's like well you grow up you\nwork in a factory you\nslave away you get your two weeks every\nyear you\nyou get married you have kids like it's\nso burrowed into your head that\nfrom everybody else's experience and in\nireland especially it's like you\nyou work to get drunk at the weekend and\nthat's it that's what everybody's lives\nwere everybody\nstarts in a small town and everyone\nstays in a small town you can go back 20\nyears later and they're all still there\na lot of them are i mean i shouldn't\ngeneralize but a lot of them are kind of\nstuck in the same sort of jobs and stuck\nin the same cycles as their parents and\ni think i was always determined to not\ndo that\nespecially being in the world of video\ngames i always saw so much more of the\nworld like oh there's japanese game devs\nand like what are they doing and\nlike oh american game releases are like\nearlier than hours like\nwhat's that about that sort of like\nknowledge door was opened at a very\nyoung age\nand i feel like because ireland is very\nheavily religious i remember being 12\nyears old and like rejecting that\nand being like no i don't believe in any\nof that i'm not going to church every\nweekend\nanymore and it was always sort of this\nsort of defiance\nagainst culture and i think that\ni mean you might not know this but when\ni started off my channel i i didn't talk\nin my regular voice i had like a\nweird sort of americanization\npronunciation of everything because that\nwas how i spoke clearly and\neverybody i watched kind of spoke like\nthat and to try and speak clearly i\nchanged my accent because i thought\nwell if i sound different then\neveryone's going to notice that\nsounds like you've been on a long\njourney to become yourself\noh yeah that's why anybody watching this\nright now if you're in your 20s and\neveryone's like time to figure out who\nyou are\nin college it's you're not going to\nfigure that out that quick\nit's like at least i didn't maybe some\nof you will if you're emotionally\nincredibly mature and had to\nhave a great functioning life but i\ndidn't i barely know who i am at 31\nyears old\ni feel like it's going to take me until\ni'm 40 before i'm like actually\nvery comfortable with doing whatever i\nwant to do\nyeah it was interesting because i think\nthose people do exist i\num you know when i was training to\nbecome a psychiatrist i was surprised by\nhow many people i was surrounded by like\nwho knew exactly who they were going to\nbe for a very long time\ndid they or were they just pretending\nthat they no\nthat's the things i think they knew for\na long time\nyeah and and looking at them\ni'm not so sure that they're lucky i\ndon't know that they're luckier\ni i think that's a value judgment that\nwe place that knowing who you are\nearlier is better but i don't i don't\nnecessarily think\num but i'm curious what happened when\nyou told people that you were\nnot interested in going to church\num my mother didn't like it uh my dad\nwell my parents have always been like\nreally good at let me do what i do\nalmost to a fault\nat some point um i'm sure we can come\nback to that\nin a bit but it was always just\nsomething that everybody did\nmy friends were always like jealous that\ni didn't have to go anymore\nbecause i mean as a kid i didn't really\ncare about any of it i would be an altar\nboy sometimes just so i didn't have to\ngo to church and sit down the same way\nall the time\nit's like well at least now i have\nsomething to do at church yeah i can\nring a bell or\nhand a collection plate to somebody but\nwhen i was younger i i don't know why i\nvividly remember going around\nthe field at the back of my house i was\njust like walking around as kids do\nand i just had this like profound point\nin my head where i was like i don't\nbelieve in any of this\nand then i started like questioning\neverything and that sort of like\nscientific side of me kicked in\nor i wanted to just like question the\nworld and the universe and\ni don't know my mother didn't like it\nand she was like don't tell your\ngrandmother because my grandmother was\nhyper religious\nand i i never had any sort of like\nanimosity towards anybody who did\nbelieve i'm like that's\nfine even at a young age i was like\nthat's fine you can still believe that\nif you want if i'm wrong i'm wrong\nit's just not for me\nso it sounds like overall people sort of\nwere pretty accepting of that\ni think so yeah weirdly yeah because\nyou're\nwhat i'm really hearing is that your mom\nwasn't concerned that your\nyou know your soul would wind up in\neternal hellfire she was more concerned\nthat your grandmother would find out\nwhich is just actually sort of a tacit\nacceptance\nof your beliefs right right it's like\nyou're like\nyeah i feel like a lot of my family were\ninto the religious side of things as a\nsort of\nsort of like a a transcendental sort of\nmeditative\naspect of life like knowing that there\nwas something there and doing prayer and\neverything was a very\nlike calming thing for them to do and\ngave them a sense of purpose and\neverything and i i feel like that that's\nthat's fine to do that i never i i\ndidn't get that\naspect out of it and my grandmother i\nthink definitely got that\nin her later years and it was something\nto like keep her company and\ngive her sort of peace of mind every day\nand i i think that that's kind of nice\nyeah so i think at that point it doesn't\nmatter if it's real or not it was real\nfor her so it doesn't matter\ni was i had i was kind of fishing around\na little bit there\nbecause i'm going to be sniffing around\nfor you know moments where you felt\ndevalued and talked over\nand and you know sort of coming out\nas being agnostic or atheistic in a in a\ncatholic uh household\num would be you know kind of prime\nprime time for being disrespected and\nundervalued but i'm not really hearing\nthat at all\nyeah i think ireland was in sort of a\ntransitional period at that point\nwhere the church kind of ruled\neverything versus government and\ni think in the 90s to early 2000s it\nkind of shifted very drastically\num so right now i have a pretty clear\nintention just in my head and i want to\nshare that with you and you let me know\nif that's good or not\nwhich is that i'm going to try to help\nyou understand a little bit about this\ndevaluing business\nand being talked over sure and in order\nto do that i think what we need to do is\naccess that emotion like a little bit\nmore\nraleigh if you can't in a raw format\nwhat i mean\nif you can't think of any time during\nyour teenage years when you really felt\nlike you were talked over people didn't\nlisten\nthen that's okay um then what i'm going\nto ask you is there a time recently\nthat you sort of really felt that way\nand it bothered you\num i think\njust doing because i've been doing a lot\nmore like larger multiplayer sessions\nwith people\nand i feel like just the nature of like\ni said the way the internet buffering\nand everything is sometimes what you say\ncan get lost\nand i think sometimes it kind of like it\nkind of triggers that sort of response\nin me\nbut i think nowadays it's not sort of a\nmalicious like how dare they not listen\nto me it's more of like a\nah they probably just didn't hear it and\nthat's fine i think\ni've tried to get a little better about\nrealizing that like what i said doesn't\nalways need to be heard all the time\nyeah so so that's actually a really good\nnuance which i want to point out which\nis that\nyour reaction to them not hearing you is\nsomewhat automatic\nand then a different part of your mind\nhas to kind of calm\nthat pissed off part down do you see\nthat\nyep and and so still what happens though\nis that programming\nactivates in those moments\nsure and so the question is like so\nlet's move a little bit further back\nhas there been a time that you can think\nof where that programming sort of\nactivated before\nideally we want to find something before\nlike a year ago because i think that's\nreally when you started to gain a lot of\nself-awareness\nand the more self-awareness you have the\nless that that programming is going to\ncontrol you\nbecause that too do you see how you have\nthe reaction\nand then awareness steps in and then you\nrationalize\nand then you kind of end up in a sort of\nmore peaceful place\nyeah and so what you want to do is go\nback to\nsorry go ahead i was going to say maybe\nsome\nscenarios again with like other creators\nwhere we're\nwe're at like uh a business thing or\nsomething or maybe we're trying to get\nlike\nfeedback on something and i say\nsomething and then i get talked over\nby them and then their opinion matters\nmore in the eye\nof the eyes of the people who are asking\nand then\ni think that sort of like it just shuts\nme down a little\n[Music]\nand just that because i i guess it's\nsort of like imposter syndrome that\ni feel like a lot of why i am who i am\nnow and\nwhere i got to is a lot of like\ncircumstance and look\num definitely hard work put in\nbut getting to this point now like being\ntold a lot that like oh you got a\npewdiepie shout out that's why you're\npopular\nand things like that it's like i i was\nnever allowed to enjoy the merits of my\nown success\nfor what they were absolutely that had a\ncontributing factor to it\num but then always feeling like the\nlesser of\ngreater people i think that\nthat's where it kind of kicks in\ndo you feel like you were the youngest\nchild in the household of youtube\nprobably yeah i feel like\nbecause i came on the i came on a tail\nend of a lot of things where\nlike bigger youtubers like a pewdiepie\nor a markiplier would have been in the\nsame space and\nfor a long time the three of us were\nassociated incredibly heavily together\nbut i was always considered like i just\nkind of like came along\nthat i didn't pioneer anything that i\ndidn't like set the ground for anything\nand i felt like a lot of times i'm like\nwell i feel like i deserve a little bit\nof\nrecognition in like certain aspects of\nwhat i did but just hearing over and\nover again that you're\nyou're not good enough to be considered\non the same level as people like that\ni think it's always been this sort of\nlike comparison in my brain\nto other creators of that stature and\nthen\nit was something that i didn't like for\na while because i'm like well these guys\nare my friends i don't want to compare\nmyself\ntoo much to them because then it becomes\nme versus them and the youtube system\nrather than real realizing like oh no\nwe're just friends that\nlike we shouldn't be against each other\nyeah so what i'm hearing jack is that\nin some ways you've always been sort of\nstanding in the shadows of giants\nyeah it kind of feels like that and so i\nthink the tricky thing here is that\ncan i think for a second i need to find\nthe right words\nabsolutely go for it\ndo you think you're standing in the\nshadows of giants\nlet me rephrase is there a part of you\nthat thinks that you're standing in the\nshadows of giants\npart of me definitely i feel like\nthere's a there's like an expectation to\nknow exactly what you're doing at this\nlevel\nto have every move planned out and you\nare like 10 steps ahead and you're like\na business mogul and like you got to the\ntop and like you're the greatest of what\nyou do\nwhen in actuality a lot of the people\ndoing this i feel like\na lot of people i talk to have no idea\nwhat they're doing and we're kind of\njust taking it day by day\nand i'd like to see it perceived more\nlike that\nand i'm kind of just trying to have fun\nin the moment rather than\ncreating 10 businesses a year out from\nnow and things like that\nlike most days i don't have a [ __ ]\nclue what i'm doing and i feel like\nthat's fine\ni feel like i i want to try and like\nnormalize that aspect more\nnormalize the sort of like\nbreaking down of the pedestals of sort\nof\nthe the idolization of things because i\nfeel like that's\nthat's where a lot of the the stan\nculture comes from\nwhich i feel like the what culture\noh am i gonna have to explain something\nto you\nplease you don't know what stan culture\nis\nno so you have fans of something\nand then standing something is like the\nnext level\nof that so it's like whenever you hear\nof like\nk-pop twitter or something like that or\npeople being\nlike very hyper aggressive and i i by no\nmeans want to tire everybody with the\nsame brush here\num i'm just trying to like break it down\nthat standing is like really\nreally obsessive like idolization of\nsomething where it like consumes your\nlife and you're like hyper into it and\neverything about your day\nis part of it um but i feel like that\nleads to a lot of negative things i feel\nlike it leads to a lot of\nbecause people talk about haters a lot\nand like ignore the haters and like\ndon't listen to them\nlike sometimes they have a little bit of\ngood things to say\nsometimes you kind of need a little bit\nof that because sometimes you're not\nright about everything\nbut on the other scale of things you\nhave the stands\nand i feel like those are also not there\nto help\nyou in most regards but they are to\nbuild you up they're there to make you\na team to fight on and i i didn't like\npeople doing that with me either because\nthen the comparison\nhappens and then everyone fights for\ntheir you become a fighter in a game\nyou become a character in a show a tribe\nyeah like that a lot of people who are\ncharging onto the field of battle with\ntheir banners with that have\njacksepticeye\nand then other people have you know the\nother youtubers\nand that tribalization happens and then\neveryone fights for you\non your behalf and from an outside\nperspective\nit can look cool but i feel like it's\njust not helping me\nit's not good for anybody because i feel\nlike i can\ni i just don't want people talking for\nme i don't want people to feel like they\nknow who i am\n100 where they feel like they're like my\nbest friend online\nand then they go start attacking other\npeople in my stead\nwhen i'm a 31 year old man i can fight\nmy own fights if i'm ignoring something\nit's probably for a very good reason\nyou can speak for yourself exactly\ni mean not always i i definitely didn't\nspeak up when i should have but\ni feel like these days absolutely i\ni i'm allowed to speak for myself and\nit's i feel like a lot of people have a\nhard time\ntackling that because it feels like\nyou're attacking your fans\nwhen that's not at all what i'm trying\nto do i'm trying to let people know that\nhey\nsome of you go a little bit too far\nthankfully\nhumorous manner\nwhen you point that i used to i used to\ni think these days i've gotten a lot\nbetter at like setting the boundary\nand just cutting things off when they\nneed to\nso jack i've got a couple questions but\ni'm noticing like a bizarrely common\ntheme here and i don't know if it's just\nbecause i'm\nyou know looking to make constellations\nout of stars here\nokay but i'm hearing these same themes\nof like speaking\nup and being heard and other people\ntalking\ninterestingly enough i don't know if\nthey're talking over you here\nbut they're talking for you and then\nit's our we have to sort of decide\nas scientists whether we want to do the\nmental gymnastics of saying that those\ntwo things are connected\nis it talking over you or is it simply\nthat like because what i'm really\nhearing is a common theme of\nyou really having to carve out your\nvoice\nyeah i feel like that's fair\nand and so then the question becomes you\nsaid that in the past\nyou didn't speak up for yourself what do\nyou mean by that like now you've gotten\nbetter about it\ni feel like if i saw something in my\ncommunity that was getting out of hand\ni would kind of brush it aside and hope\nthat it would just go away\nand kind of like funnel in something\nelse to kind of drown it out\nyeah or like if i saw something on\ntwitter getting out of hand\ni would just ignore it and then move on\nand then hope that everyone just reacts\nto the next thing that i do\ninstead of just calling it out\ni mean some some things can probably\njust be left alone because there's no\npoint like\nmaking a mountain out of a molehill but\ndefinitely some of the stuff that's kind\nof pushed my boundaries\nand pushed me as a person and that i\ndidn't appreciate\ni think i've gotten better at\njust drawing attention to it and saying\nlike that's not okay please stop\nokay i still i still falter every now\nand then but it's something i've tried\nto get much better at over the years\nso jack um i i'm going to share with you\na couple of thoughts these are going to\nbe like pretty half formed\nbut i want to leave you with something\nyou know if if it strikes a chord with\nyou and and you want to talk about it\nyou're\nyou know we're more than welcome to i'm\ngoing to sort of\nyeah i'm just gonna toss it out because\ni think you're an incredibly\nself-reflective person and i think that\neven though it makes for a little bit of\nunsatisfying television\ni wanna give you something to turn over\nin your mind and\nand maybe it'll help okay and then if\nsomething\ntriggers and and there's an experience\nthat you can think of or\nit really resonates with the way that\nyou feel like we can certainly talk more\nabout it\nbut usually what i do is i ask a bunch\nof questions and then i offer a\nconclusion\nat this point i'm going to just offer\nthe potential conclusion first and then\nlike we can sort through\nyou know i like to make it sort of like\nthe climax but you know\nhere it goes so so i i think this is\ngoing to sound kind of weird but i think\na lot of this actually comes back so we\nwere\nkind of hunting around for this idea\nthat there may have been moments in your\nlife where you had something to say and\npeople spoke over you\nand and the funny thing is that you know\nthat really sounds like it's the thing\nbut when i ask you about that you're\nlike ah nothing really\njumps out we sort of went down the dead\nend of the religious thing because that\nsounds like oh man like that was like oh\nhe was like religion he liked practicing\nreligious freedom and he was oppressed\noh my god that's when he lost his voice\nit's perfect oppression\ngreat but this was sort of a dead end\ntoo right\nyeah so so i i think what what i'd like\nto toss out then if that's a dead end\nlike let's just let it be a dead end\nlike that's okay\nand oddly enough i think some of this\nmay have to come from your perception\nthat you're standing in the shoulder in\nthe shadows of giants\nand what i mean by that is like so what\ni'm hearing you say is that you have to\nyou know you have to elbow your way to\nthe table\nyou have to really like go out of your\nway to be noticed\nand so if we really think about it like\nyou know the things that bother us\nlike when people talk over you or don't\nlisten to your opinion\nthat could be sort of traumatic in its\norigin in the sense that something\nhappened to you at some point\nlike you know sometimes we'll see this\nkind of thing with people who grew up in\nabusive households where they're like\nthey really weren't\nthey had something to say like i worked\nwith one particular patient who was\nmolested in a gas station bathroom\nand like tried to tell people and like\npeople wouldn't\nlisten and and so\nit was like a really challenging sort of\nsituation where like he was trying to\nspeak and like\npeople weren't listening and so\nsometimes that's where that kind of\ncomes from i'm not really\ngetting any of that from you so the\nother option is that it's not actually\nthat you were ever truly spoken over\nbut that you felt like you didn't belong\nand so anything that exposes that\nor resonates with that genuine fear that\nyou have about yourself\nis what like really kind of triggers you\nso it's sort of like\nthis idea that you know it's not that\nother people\ndidn't let you speak it's that you kind\nof feel like you're\nplaying in a game with the big boys and\nthat you're the small you're the\nyoungest kid in the room\nand so as you carry that fear within you\nyou're kind of very sensitive to\nanything\nwhich like may rub up against it\nso if someone says something you know\nit's sort of like if i'm insecure about\nmy appearance\nand someone doesn't give me a job and\nthen i'm like oh it's because\nthe other person was prettier than i am\nit's not because\nthat's not true at all maybe it's true i\nmean i don't know but our\nown insecurities are the things that\ncause us suffering because\nour brain is sort of scanning for a\nconfirmation bias to make us feel like\ndevalued\nyeah so the interesting thing is like\nmaybe we can approach it from sort of a\ntraumatic angle where you were really\nnot listened to but the other thing is\nthat you\nyou genuinely there's a part of you and\nso i kind of asked you this earlier\ndo you feel like you're kind of like\nthere's a part of you and this is the\ntricky thing is that\nas the awareness grows outside of\njacksepticeye this other part of you is\ngoing to get kind of packaged\nand set aside and there are going to be\nmoments where you're more aware where\nthat thing isn't really going to have\nany power over you\nbut your own awareness outside of\njacksepticeye is going to fluctuate\nand in periods of time when your own\nawareness is low\nthat kind of devaluing insecurity the\nidea that you're the small\nkid in the room full of big kids that\nyou're the kid whose dad is retired and\nthere's like there's like everyone else\nand then there's you\nand and if that's really the case then\nlike i think the the sensitivity\nto you know other people speaking over\nyou\nmay come from your own insecurity that\nyou don't deserve to speak\nyeah what do you think about that\ni mean it feels like you're hitting a\nlot of the right points\nis that feels like that's kind of yeah i\nfeel like that's kind of the\navenue that i'm in um\nit's kind of because i i have always\nwondered that like where where is it\ncoming from why do i feel this way and\nwhy there why do i react a certain way\nand trying to get over it but never\nreally fully understanding where it\ncomes from\nto begin with yeah um\nso it's always been a tricky thing to\ngrapple with\nso then the question becomes when did\nyou start to\nfeel like you weren't good enough\nor that you not good enough good enough\nisn't the right word when did you\nstart to feel that you were kind of last\nplace\nin a particular group of people oh\nthat's school for sure\nlike even from the earliest ages seeing\ni had a lot of friends who were very\nvery smart\nand who were very good at like maths or\nsome were good at\nxyz subject and i always felt like i\nkind of\nlagged behind and i didn't get like bad\ngrades but\nmy friends were always getting great\ngrades and they were always doing so\nmuch better than me and i remember\njust not being out like certain things\ndidn't click with me but\ni never really had the hunger to make\nthem click with me\nbut the dissatisfaction of not feeling\nlike i kept up with them\nwas still present and i feel like are we\ntalking about your school friends or\npewdiepie and markiplier\nno school friends school friends um\nthey i feel like when i was in college\nas well i went to college twice and the\nfirst time i went for like\nmusic production um in my when i was\nlike 18 19\nand i i remember leaving that course\nbecause even though i passed all my\nexams year two\ni didn't go back for the third year\nbecause i felt like i just didn't get it\ni other people were like sailing ahead\nthey had so much hunger for they\nunderstood everything all the time\nand i just couldn't get it it didn't\nclick with me\nso instead of asking for help and\nadmitting that i looked dumb\ni felt like i had to just like leave\nthat i\ni'm not smart enough to keep up with\nthese people so this just isn't the\nplace for me i need to like get out of\nhere\num and i feel like that sort of\nthat fear of looking dumb has always\nbeen sort of something that's persisted\nin my life for a very long time\nand i feel like doing this sort of job\nas well it's it's very easy for people\nto just\nsay that to you um\nand it's it's like it's not like one of\nthose like super biting like slurs or\nanything like that it's just something\nso\nchildish and benign sounding but it it's\nalways like struck a chord with me\nso i'm like damn it's like i really do\nsuck at this don't i\nand i always kind of shoot myself down\nas a result of that\nso let me ask you something when you\nfeel like someone is talking over\nyou does it feel to you like you have to\nrebel\nagainst that part because like like\nhere's what i'm envisioning okay this is\ngonna get\nman this is gonna fall apart real quick\nso\nyou know it's my fault really not yours\nif i can't explain this but here's what\ni'm envisioning and it's going to happen\nlightning quick okay\nso like you're not a failure you've\nnever thought of yourself as a failure\nbecause you always passed your exams\nlike you actually you know\nfinished your two years but everyone\nelse is just\nso much better and you carry that\nthought with you\nthat everyone else is so much better but\nthen there's another part of your mind\nthat's like [ __ ] we can't\nthink that way about ourselves and so\nlike if someone else\neven remotely like\nsuggests that they are better than you\nyou're like\nthat part of you comes rushing to your\nrescue and they're like no\njack's opinion is just as good as yours\nhow dare you guys treat him that way\ni deserve to speak and i'm not stupid\nyeah is that what happens\nyeah i don't think in as much of an\naggressive way but\ndefinitely that sort of like tide starts\nrolling in pretty quick\nright but but the tide is a response\nto that initial insecurity what do you\nthink about that and it's it's going to\nbe quick it could be hard to notice\nand i could be wrong yeah no absolutely\nyeah\nso now if you want to unravel this\nyou've actually got two or three options\nokay\none is that you can notice that\nprotective part of you\nand that protective part of you like if\nyou i know it sounds weird\nbut if you disarm that that's gonna be\nthe same thing as like\nlooking at yourself and asking for help\ndoes that make sense like both of those\nare protective mechanisms\nyeah and so if you dismantle that with\nyour awareness or if you notice it\nthis will start to dwindle away because\ni\nit's hard to describe but like if you\nstop the over compensation\nthen you can actually fix the problem\nbut as long as you're applying band-aids\nlike you're never going to get to the\nroot of it yeah and then the other thing\nthat you can do is actually\nexplore and this is the kind of thing\nthat you you know you can do with a\ntherapist\nor um you're a twitch streamer yeah okay\num so so this is also where you know\nthis is the kind of work that our\nour creator coaching program does but\ni'd say if you haven't seen a therapist\nit's a good thing to work on\num which is that that initial idea of\nlike why did you start devaluing\nyourself\nright and you got to talk and this is\nwhere you've got a lot of stories\nand so this is where like you have to\ntalk through and sort of sit with and\nreflect on\nall these instances and they're gonna be\ntiny tiny instances\nwhere you didn't fail but you felt like\nother people were better\nright and like as you settle\neach of those moments down then you'll\nbe free of this\nokay thoughts questions\nresponses yeah i mean again\nyou're very good at explaining things so\ni think you kind of hit the nail on the\nhead\num and it's kind of it's things that\ni've kind of known for a while\nand especially again a lot of the\nreflecting over the last year i've\ngotten better at like\nwhen these things happen to kind of like\nstop and take a pause\nand think about it objectively and\nrealize like\nwhat they're saying is not the truth and\nkind of has no bearing on me and i\nshouldn't take it so much to heart\nevery time i've definitely gotten better\nat it but i still i still think i'm on\nthat journey\nyeah so so let me try to help you just a\nlittle bit of tweaking that\nthe first step is to say i shouldn't\ntake it the heart\nto heart the second step is why do i\ntake that to heart in the first place\nokay because you could take all kinds of\nstuff to heart\ndoes that make sense yeah like your\nphysical appearance\nyou know whatever your accent right\nand so like like there are lots of\nthings which you have allowed yourself\nto be\nbut this is the one thing that still\nlike\nis the [ __ ] in the armor that like you\ndo take to heart so forget about the\nfact that i mean\nyou think you've you're halfway there so\nthe next step is\nwhy does this thing resonate with you so\nmuch\nright and as you explore that then\nyou'll get to the real root of it\nyeah yeah that makes a lot of sense\ncool awesome\n[Music]\ni feel like we're at a decent stopping\npoint i mean\nbut you know it's sort of like i feel\nlike if we keep talking we have to open\nup something else\num yeah and we'd probably be here for\nanother three hours\nso so i also find that when i'm working\nwith someone\ni think it's important from a memory\nconsolidation point to kind of like\npause and let you kind of process this\ndigest this\nexpress skepticism with yourself etc and\nyou can always like revisit things later\nbut like this is what i kind of want to\nleave you with\nespecially given your own capacity for\nself-reflection i think it's like pretty\ngood\nwell i hope so but yeah i think that's a\ngood like pin to put on things\nyeah um do you have any questions or\nanything that i can try to clarify\nfurther or anything that you feel like\ndidn't make sense\num no i feel like if it didn't at the\ntime i would have\npoked a little bit further and asked\nabout it yeah and i thought it was very\nhelpful when i sort of\nsniffed up the idea of like you know\npeople talking over you when you were a\nkid and you were kind of like nah\nnothing comes in mind and that's really\nhelpful so that is i think ultimately\nwhat allowed us because if you had sort\nof played along i don't think we would\nhave ever gotten here\nyeah i i like that sort of avenue aspect\nof doing things because i can sit here\nand think about it all day but there's\njust so much to consolidate\nthen like i you'd never know where to\nstart it's like well what am i trying to\nfix and what am i trying to think about\nwhat am i where am i trying to start\nwith any of it so it's nice to have\nsomebody kind of like funnel that down\nyep and and i think this is where like\nif something doesn't resonate to you\nwith you\nultimately it's not about what i think\nit's about what fits\nright when i say something some things\nare going to resonate and some things\naren't and you really know\nand this is what marcus aurelius would\nsay is that like you know everything\nyou just don't know that you know well i\ndon't know if you would say that\nprecisely but\nyou know that that like the change comes\nfrom within that the neon is like buried\nwithin you\nand and all you have to do is follow\nthat internal compass and you'll get to\nyour answers\nyeah i think the the self-confidence in\nmyself is something that i\ndefinitely need to work on a little bit\nfurther\nyep maybe forever but i don't think\nthat's a bad thing\nno i don't think so yeah so i think it's\ninteresting because you know we've\nstayed away from the term\nself-confidence because i think you come\nacross and you would even describe\nyourself\nas a confident person\ndid i wouldn't you\ni guess so i'm confident\nand i'm confident in my myself yeah like\nme as a person yeah um outside of\neverything i i kind of know who i might\nyeah i know where my brain is at\nyeah and and i think that this is the\nother interesting thing is that\nyou know that self-confidence is outside\nof jacksepticeye\nand jacksepticeye thinks that\nhe's you know the youngest kid in the\nroom\nand and so that's that's what we kind of\ngot to dig into\nyeah cool do you meditate\nuh probably not as frequently as i would\nlike to but it's definitely something\ni've started doing\nin the last year i was doing it a little\nbit before this call\neven what kind of meditation do you do\nif you don't mind me asking\ni don't know if i'd have a term for it\nbut i like to just like\nsit in silence and kind of like just\nfocus on my breath\nand my breathing and try and camp things\ndown i try to think about nothing\nokay and kind of just have like one\nfocal point\nin my body and just kind of sit there\nwith that for like 20 minutes\nwhat's the focal point you use uh\nit's usually like my nose or just my my\nbreathing in general\nokay um can i share with you a slightly\ndifferent technique please\nso i'm going to teach you a technique\nthat comes from\nkundalini tantra or kundalini yoga\nand kundalini yoga is like this business\nabout chakras or chakras\nwhich are these sort of energy centers\nit's super super hokey not very\nscientific\nbut particularly what i want to do is\nteach you a meditation technique that is\ngoing to govern\nand strengthen this once again not very\nscientific\nconcept of the third eye which is like\nyour sense of intuition and\nunderstanding\nso like knowledge and nyan comes from\nthe third eye\nand i think that when you're the journey\nthat you're on\njack is like one that really has to do\nwith a lot of like\nunderstanding and so i don't think you\nneed success\ni don't think you need self-compassion i\ndon't think you need to\nyou know conquer your impulsive desires\nor anything like that there are\ntechniques for all that kind of crap\nbut i think if i had to share one thing\nwith you it would just be to enhance\nyour ability to understand\ni was about to say yourself but i'm not\ngoing to add anything just understand\nperiod\nokay um how does that sound to you great\nso i want you to sit up straight your\nback and neck need to be straight\nokay okay so this is um so\nand uh take off your glasses\ni think yeah okay so i know this is\ngonna sound it's gonna be really weird\nbut what i'm gonna ask you to do is\nis close your close your eyes and then\ni'm going to ask you to take i'll show\nyou so i want you to take your middle\nfinger and i want you to hover it\nlike maybe a few centimeters\noff of the middle of your two eyebrows\nand slightly above\nokay so there's a point right here yeah\nnow close your eyes don't touch\ndon't touch and focus on the sensation\nkind of in your forehead that your\nmiddle finger is hovering over\nare you able to kind of feel something\nthere\nyeah yeah that's weird yes it's gonna be\nso just focus on that for like let's say\nso actually let's pause for a second go\nahead and open your eyes\nso what we're going to do is we're going\nto do some deep breathing for about 30\nseconds and then i want you to start\nthat practice\nand then we're going gonna do that for\nabout 60 seconds where you're going to\nhold your middle finger over that point\nand then after about 60 seconds i'm\ngoing to ask you to relax\ni want you to adopt let me think about\nthis\nchin mudra so do this with your hands\nokay and then put them palms face up\non your knees when we're done okay so\nit's gonna be 30 seconds of breathing\none minute of finger over that and then\nadopt this mudra\nand then just sit there and i want you\nto continue concentrating on that spot\nokay okay and we'll do a total of about\nmaybe three minutes of practice\nso 30 seconds 60 seconds and then 90\nseconds of just focusing on that spot\nokay two questions yeah when i do this\nshould i keep my eyes closed yes eyes\nclosed the whole time\nokay and will you prompt me when to\nswitch yes\nokay okay beautiful okay so let's close\nyour eyes\nand let's just start by anchoring\nourself in the breath\nbreathe nice and slow\nreally want to stretch out that\nexhalation\nand now take your middle finger on your\nright hand and hover it between your\neyebrows and slightly above\nand you can vary how close it is you\ndon't want to touch\nbut there's going to be a particular\ndistance\nthat will kind of maximize the sensation\nso focus on that sensation we'll do this\nfor about 60 seconds\ndon't try to move around too much\nonce you find like a decent spot just\nstay there\nand concentrate on your eyebrow center\nit may feel a little bit intense\nbut try to stay on top of it continue\nyour attention there\nand now let your hands come down let\nyour eyes remain closed\nand continue concentrating on that point\nnow in a relaxed manner\ntry to drive your attention\nor put energy into that point\nfocus your concentration\ninto the eyebrow center\nwe'll practice for another 60 seconds\nnow let yourself come back\nlet your eyes remain closed but let the\neyebrow center go\nreturn back to where you are\nyour breath returns\nnotice your body and your mind as they\nstart to wake up again\nand now i want you to put your palms\ntogether in front of you in sort of a\nnamaste position\nand then rub them together rub rub rub\nrub rub hot\nhot hot and cup them over your eyes\ntake a deep breath in and as you exhale\nslowly open your eyes with your palms\ncovering them\nas the breath completes let your hands\ncome down\nthat was great\nsmile says it all yeah\ni love that what did you love about it\ni love the what's the right word for it\ni love the\nthe focus of it i tend to\nwhen i try and meditate on my own i tend\nto get very sporadic\nthoughts and it's it's very hard to\ncontrol them and\nbring them back non-judgmentally to\nnothing\nand it's like to focus on my breath and\neverything is one thing but then i get\naware of like\nam i breathing too much am i breathing\ntoo little that kind of stuff so it's\nnice\nto like it shut off my brain more i\nthink\nand it helped me have a better focal\npoint did you experience any sensations\num i don't think so on the first time\nokay just sort of like\na lightness okay totally fine\num but you know if it if it grabbed your\nattention\nthat's the point of a good meditation\ntechnique and i think this is hard\nbecause\nyou know this gets we get this gets lost\nwith like all of the apps\nbecause the apps aren't really tailored\nright\nbut i think you know a good meditation\ntechnique should\nhelp it become easier for you to\nmeditate\nand and ideally what a good meditation\ntechnique would do is let your mind\nfall into the meditation more naturally\nas opposed to like\nwrangling it and forcing it in right\num which is i think the way that a lot\nof people kind of do it nowadays but\nyou know yeah so i i'd say\ni think a lot of people tend to think\nlike am i meditating right am i doing it\nis this meditation yep and i think for\nme a good one was um\nbinaural stimulation helped a lot and i\ntalked to a therapist before about like\ncognitive behavioral stuff and like\ndoing stuff with like a pen back and\nforth and like making sure your eyes are\ndrifting back and forth and that\nthat definitely helped me a lot so\nanything sort of like\nanything with sort of like a sensation\nkind of gets me into it more i think\nyeah and also if if there's a\nfluctuating sensation i think that's\ngoing to work better for you too\nbut i really think you you sort of\nstumbled upon the preparatory practice\nto this practice so this\npractice is sort of phase two of a\nsequence of practices\nand phase one is concentrating on your\nbreath in the tip of your nose and\nactually gazing\nat the tip of your nose um so i think\nyou're sort of naturally gravitating\nalong this path i think also where you\nare it sort of fits because this is the\npath of like understanding it's not\ngoing to do anything for you it's just\ngoing to give you answers\nand so try it out i'd say you can do\nthis practice for\nthree to five minutes i recommend about\n20 minutes of total practice\nat least three days a week that's from a\nclinical standpoint and sort of a\nneuroscience standpoint what's required\nto make\nchanges in your brain right but i would\ntry to do this practice three to five\nminutes and then you can combine\nyou know the other things that you do\nwith it you can lengthen it out if you\nwant to if you want to do this for a\nfull 20 minutes that would be wonderful\nbut\ndon't stress about it sure i'll try it\nand then if we get a chance if you do\nthe practice diligently\nand we get a chance to follow up at some\npoint um\nyou know just let me know and then i'll\nteach you\nstep three okay\nokay exciting okay well\nthanks for coming on jack no problem\nthis is great\nyeah and and good luck to you any last\nthoughts or questions before we\nwrap up uh no i was just gonna ask about\nlike um\nhow long to meditate and how often and\nstuff like that so you answered that\nalready\nyeah um good well you know\nbest of luck to you i think it was\nawesome having you i i hope that\ni really loved our conversation um it\nwas\nawesome because i think you've come so\nfar on your own it's like really fun to\nwork with someone who's\nyou know halfway there yeah no this is\ngreat this is the\ntype of conversation that i love and\ni've always been trying to like champion\nmental health for years on\nyoutube and what i do so it's good to\nhave like\ntools to deal with this sort of stuff\nand just talk it out and reaffirm things\nyeah i think it's wonderful that you're\nchampioning mental health i think part\nof\nyou know a mistake that we sometimes\nmake is because sometimes\nthings do get kind of emotionally\ncathartic on this channel i think\neveryone thinks that understanding\nmental health has to be like\na painful you know tearful kind of thing\nbut i i think\nunderstanding your mind is can actually\nbe like a really fun\nand kind of curious sort of exploration\nand i think you really exemplified that\nreally really well today\nit doesn't have to be like therapy you\nknow where you're like talking about\nlike uh my dad\nlike passed away and like he didn't love\nme yeah\nit's like you know you know your dad\nloved you it's clear yeah you know\nyou don't need to be tragic about it\nexactly right so\nexploring mental health even the\nchallenges that we face can actually be\nlike\npleasant enjoyable and funny and\ninsightful\nand i think you did a wonderful job of\nkind of walking that journey today so\nthank you so much\nwell i had a great guide yeah well\nyou're very welcome\nso have a good day and um you know good\nluck to you man\nyeah you too i hope everything in texas\nsettles down soon and yeah\nyou don't have to worry about things i\nhope so too i think um i it's supposed\nto be in the 70s\nyou know which is like what what is that\nlike um\nlike 30 celsius i think\nsomething like that it's hot yeah yeah\noh no not 30. what am i thinking\ni mean i can't fat correct you anyway so\nyou can say whatever you want\num but anyway have a good day and best\nof luck to you man\nyeah you too thanks for having me bye\nokay chat who are we um\nyeah it's 20. we need to subtract 10."
