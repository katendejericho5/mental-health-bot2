better\nsuccess ladies and gentlemen that's\nright saved we are here okay\nyeah i try to minimize um\nuh i try not to look at chat when i'm\ntalking to people\nbut yeah well i wish i wish i i do the\nmarket so i have to\nsteal content from anywhere i can and\nit's usually them\ncool that is a massive cup of\nsomething\niced tea iced tea good stuff yeah i got\nit thank you oh now you can\nthanks dear appreciate it\nall right you you have a a red thread\naround your right wrist\nyes this is from my wedding oh how\nlong ago were you married uh well it's\nit's been replaced since then but uh we\nhad our wedding in um\njanuary of 2019. oh interesting\nin delhi yeah wow\nthat sounds wild man i mean\nit was interesting because i tried\nbringing an elephant in because i wanted\na way i wanted to ride an elephant into\nmy wedding because i was like listen\none of two things either a i have an\nepic story\nor b i'm trampled to death by an\nelephant in my own wedding which is also\nan awesome story\nso for me i was like that would be cool\nbut they wouldn't allow us to have an\nelephant within the city limit so i had\nto ride a horse in\nthat's you know\nit's really frustrating that you weren't\nable to get your elephant\nyou know i figure there'll be another\ntime there'll be another time i'll i'll\ni'll i'll i'll chalk that one up too is\nyou know a missed opportunity\nand and um so am i calling you stonk a\nguy or\nwhat do you go by stocky tsg\nboomer um foxy i don't know there's a\nmillion names out there\nwhat do you prefer\ni don't really have a preference i just\nkind of go with what it is i mean uh\nwell okay no not jim creamer god\num uh whatever whatever is comfortable\nfor you stocky tsg stock guy\nokay uh i'll i guess i'll go with tsg\nunless\nshould i just use your name or is that\nsecret\ni mean they know my name it's just\nawkward because of the character well\nnot character but the\nthe the person i play on stream so okay\num i mean if you want to call me jason\nthat's fine\nokay uh we can go with tsg all right\num yeah so tell me tsu what do you want\nto talk about today\nanything in particular\num i i mean i don't know i mean i\ni they reached out just to talk i don't\nknow i was told\nso let me let me orient you okay please\nokay so oftentimes people come onto the\nstream because\nthey want to learn about something or\nthey need help with something\nso i i recognize that\nso a lot of times people on twitch will\nlike have kind of like you know podcasts\nor whatever where they'll talk about\nstuff\nwe usually don't talk about stuff in\nsort of a third person way although we\ncertainly can\num so usually like a lot of streamers\nyou know will\nwill have um particular questions about\nmental health or they have an issue\nthey're struggling with\nor things like that that that we'll kind\nof then explore together\nusing the lens of like um you know\nactually yourself\nbut some people have you know that\nthey're not entirely comfortable with\nthat\nor or things like that which is totally\ncool in which case we can just\nyou know talk if there's if there are\nany questions that you have that i can\nanswer that's totally fine\ni think um two of the things that uh\nhad been floated were sort of talking\nabout fomo\nor financial stress um\nand i don't know if those topics seem\nrelevant to you or anything like that um\nwe can talk more about your marriage if\nyou want to\nwhat it's being like married to an\nindian woman um\nyou know whatever whatever you whatever\nyou want to talk about\nso oftentimes people will come here with\na particular like goal in mind but if\nyou don't have one that's totally fine\nwe can\nyou know we can roll with it um yeah i\nknow i mean i'm still\ntrying to get this over um as far as me\nlike i'm not really a twitch\nperson it's gonna be weird to say that\num i'm not so\nyeah so so two and a half years ago i\nnever even heard what twitch was\nuh and even now um after i get done\nstreaming\ni you know i have to you know i have my\nnewborn so i take care of her give my\nwife a break i have to take care of the\nwife the dog\nbusiness inquiry stuff you know um\ntrades and stuff like that i don't\nreally spend a lot of time on twitch i'm\njust now starting to network with people\nafter the two years so um i knew who\nwho you were and what what what you do\nand and the way that you know you\nyou talk with streamers stuff like that\ni knew of that but i didn't have a lot\nof like\ndeep understanding of it um so\nyou know but one of my mods also works\nwith your team so i kind of understood\nso for me um i'm i'm coming into this a\nlittle blind\nbut i think that i think that i think\nthat it's a good opportunity since you\nwork with mental health and\nand helping people understand things i\nactually think that this is a good time\nto talk about certain things for people\nbecause i think this whole gamestop\nfiasco um\na lot of people got caught up in\nsomething they didn't know a lot of\npeople\nhad some misunderstandings a lot of\npeople lost a lot of money or they\ndidn't know what they were doing and i\nthink that i think that it's actually\na good conversation to have regarding um\nfomo whether it's uh chasing get rich\nquick you know following the trend and\nstuff like that i think that it's\nactually a relevant conversation so i\nthought that was something maybe we\ncould begin with\nand then kind of easy that's totally\ncool yeah so tell me about\nthe game stop quote unquote fiasco\noh well\nlike from the beginning or like just\nkind of like what's going on well i mean\nbasically you know there was this\nthere was this thing online where um it\nstarted out that we could make money\nyou know there was money that this stock\nis going to go good and then as it got\nup there was more hype around it\num regarding a short squeeze and gamma\nsqueeze which is in stock terms mean\nthere's a chance that this can\nexponentially go up um\nand then it started doing that and the\nsqueeze happened but um\ni think a lot of people it went from\npotential to make money to it's gonna\nmake everyone a millionaire and we're\ngonna take down the big guy and we're\ngonna get rich doing it\nand i think a lot of people who didn't\nreally understand what was going on also\nthrew money at it\nlike anything and now they're bag\nholding\nfrom the top and they've lost a lot of\nmoney and some people who are\nmaybe more susceptible to sensationalism\nor\nor gambling or are in a really bad\nfinancial situation thought this was\ntheir out\nand now they're way worse off than they\nwere before\nand uh you know i'm seeing that around\nand i'm really it really bothers me and\nyou know um i was very clear with these\nguys yeah we were having fun we were\nhyping it up the andrew and we're all in\nthis and it's all great\nbut i tried to make it very clear\nthroughout the time you know guys also\ndon't be in this\nholding over the weekend more money than\nyou have that you could afford to lose\nbecause\nit is a total gamble it's a complete\ngamble gamestop is not going to be 300\nor 400\nin a year so be careful and a lot of\npeople they get caught up with the\nemotions\num and they lost a lot of money and and\ni've always been one of those people who\nyou know i hate seeing people in my\ncommunity lose money or people out there\nlose money because\ni try to make it my mission to to help\npeople but i'm also an entertainer so\nit's a little bit of a mixture\nthere so that's something i've been i've\nbeen struggling with a little bit but\ni feel you know i feel for some of those\npeople what do you what do you mean by\nyou've been struggling with what what\nexactly has been the struggle\num the struggle for me is\nis that you know you're always gonna i'm\ni'm one of those guys who always\nwonder if if if potentially\ni didn't like you know um\ni didn't give\nenough warning because i've always built\nmy stream\non the idea that i want to help people\nmake better\nfinancial decisions you know teaching\nthem stuff making it fun right so i've\nwe have people that have learned about\ngetting their 401k in their ira or\nrefinancing their house or getting their\nloan down or\nyou know management fees you know hsa i\nmean there's so many things\nthat that's so much good and so much\nawesomeness and\nand and amazing things that have\nhappened in this community it gives me a\npurpose every day\nit's the greatest thing that's ever\nhappened to me but\ni sometimes like if somebody finally\nsays hey stock guy because of you i\nstarted investing\nthat's awesome next day market's down\nfive percent\nand it's like now i feel guilty you know\nwhat i mean like even though i know that\nthis is part of the market like they're\nlooking at me like i did i listened and\nnow i'm losing money like\ni feel guilt even though i didn't do\nanything\nand with the gamestop fiasco it was fun\nit was engaging i was i was loving it\nwith the hype was great\neven though i was giving the message\nalong the way of guys don't put it more\nthan you can afford to lose it's a\ngamble\nif you have your money now you can sell\nyour shares for a profit\nsell your original investment let the\nrest ride hand the torch off\nand i even though i shouldn't a little\nbit of part of me is like\nhow clear were you and did you like i\nmean i can't force somebody to do it but\ni\nsometimes i'm like you know yeah i said\nit but you know i don't know there's\njust a little bit there so but yeah so\nthat's about it let me see if i kind of\nunderstand what you're saying\nand if the questions get if you want to\nbe a little bit more abstract\num and and less personal about your own\nfeelings just let me know okay\noh i got i'm just sort of dude on the\ncamera i'm not worried yeah okay\nso what i'm hearing is that you know in\na sense you kind of know you're not\nresponsible right so like you you you're\nvery clear in terms of trying to provide\nguidance\nyou know there's no such thing as a sure\nthing um you're being very explicit with\npeople\nthat you're like this is a [ __ ]\ngamble right absolutely\nit's it's a gamble it's a meme you've\nbeen saying it all along\nand at the same time i'm noticing that\nin your head\nyou're doing all the you're actually\nbehaving in a responsible way\nbut that there's a part of you that i it\nsounds kind of weird\nfeels responsible\nwhen people lose money it's something\ni've struggled with from the beginning\nyou know um i i'm i'm very very clear\nthat you know\nactively trading the odds are heavily\nagainst you\nyou know day trading odds are heavily\nagainst you\nyou know the there's no such thing as a\nsure thing i mean the market itself\nalways goes up historically i mean yeah\nit goes down but then it goes back up so\ninvesting is not so much a gamble but\nactively trading day trading\nis a gamble it's a gamble and you're\nmost likely not going to beat the market\nand even if you do the sweat equity you\nput in\nisn't worth the the profit at the end if\nyou and that's why even me i tell them\nall the time i put\n90 of my my money in long-term\ninvestments\n10 i trade and i and i make money when i\nmake profit i dump them into my long\nterm\nand that's that's it and i'm very clear\nyou know i'm not telling anybody they're\ngonna get rich or i'm not trying to tell\nthem\nyou know follow me and you'll have a\nyacht i'm very clear um\nand we talk about a lot of stuff but for\nsome reason\ni feel like even though it's not my\nfault\nyou know i sometimes get a little bit of\nthat guilt of\nyou know they lost money because they\ninvested or\nthey invested and they've lost money in\nthe short term\nyou know i can't time it perfectly i\njust want to get them interested\ndo people blame you\nnot anymore i think people understand\nmore but\nit's not so much that they blame me i\nmean they blame me as a meme\nbut um i think i put it on myself more\nthan they put it on me\nyeah so let me ask you how how much\nhow much does that bot does that guilt\nsort of bother you\nlike how inconvenient is it because i'm\ni'm hearing very clearly that like in\nyour head\ni i think you're doing all the right\nstuff and you've really thought this\nyou thought the ethics of it kind of\nthrew pretty heavily is what i'm i'm\ngetting from you\num is that the sec\nno um uh so so i'm sort of getting the\nsense that that you really\nyou know have thought through not taking\nadvantage of people\nnot promising any yachts and things like\nthat you know\nteaching basic financial literacy being\nopen with the fact that\nninety percent of your investments are\nin like long term not unexciting stuff\nand that ten percent is kind of what you\nplay around with\nand so i i'm i'm hearing that you've\nbeen very very judicious with that\nand i'm still kind of curious from like\na personal standpoint\nhow much does it bother you to have\nthese feelings of guilt\ni mean my wife has to tell me all the\ntime she's like you literally tell these\npeople\neverything but like you put it not even\na disclaimer you just tell these guys\nhey listen this is this this this this\ndon't do don't do anything don't chase\nit you're not gonna get rich\nthere's a difference between making\nmoney and building wealth there's you go\nthrough this\nbut newer people see the excitement they\nsee the money you make real quick when\nyou make a big share trade or when\nsomething like that\nthey see all this and they want to get\nin on it too and and they fomo\nin and then they lose money and it's\nlike if you didn't have this this this\nor you didn't have the gains channel\nlike in my discord have a gains channel\nand people post their gains right they\nnever post their losses but they post\ntheir gains sometimes they're up\n7 000 in a week or like a thousand you\nknow percent a day\nand it's like they go in there and they\nsee that and people like oh i can do\nthat too\nand it's like you know i know that\nthat's just what people are doing\nthey're showing their stuff but at the\nend of the day like\ni don't know there's a small part of me\nsometimes bigger than i think\nthat just i i don't want to see people\nget hurt\ni really don't want to see people get\nhurt why do you say bigger than you\nthink\nbecause i know that i it's not my fault\nand that i've done\neverything in my power to make it very\nclear but\nthese people started doing this because\nof me\nand so a small part of me is like hey\nyou know i stopped doing options on\nstream i i mean i still do a few here\nbut i used to do mostly options on\nstream because it's exciting it's fun\nit's content lots of money to be made or\nlost quickly\nbut then i started noticing lots of\npeople that were new we're like oh i can\ndo that too i'm just going to copy\neverything he does or everything\neverybody else is doing\nand they lose everything so i was like i\nhave more responsibility with a bigger\nplatform now\nlet me kind of bring it back to a little\nbit more responsible\nand still make content out of it okay\nyeah and and so\ni'm still i'm still feeling like i i\ndidn't get a clear answer to my question\nhow much does the guilt bother you\ni mean like if i could take a a magic\nwand and and wave it away\nhow appealing would that be\ni mean it's not the biggest issue in my\nlife it's not\nit's not it's not it's not like in the\ntop five issues in my life\nbut i think about it i spend all my time\noutside stream that i'm not doing with\nfamily dealing with the business and\nwith the stream and with the community\nand stuff like that so\nit does it does affect me but it's not\nlike you know i'm i'm i'm not able to\neat dinner because of it yep\nyeah yeah so so well said so i i'm not\ngetting the sense that it is a big issue\nso i guess um tsg what i'm kind of\ndigging for is essentially like a topic\nfor us to dive into because in my\nexperience the most useful thing is to\nlike\npick one thing and explore it thoroughly\nright\nand so by doing that we sort of\nunderstand the nuance i think a big part\nof your stream is like\nhelping people understand that it's not\nsimple\nright yeah and helping people just get\nto a better life because i come from\nsuch poverty and such [ __ ] life\nthat you know this is something i'm\npassionate about this is something i\nlove\nand i want to share with people and the\nfact that these guys are\nso much positivity is coming out of it\njust gives me this purpose of like\n[ __ ] yeah i love this this is addicting\nyou know\nyeah so can you tell us a little bit\nabout where you come from\nuh sure so um basic tldr\nuh both my parents were were drug\naddicts uh my mom was a stripper\num they uh they moved to hawaii i was\nborn there\num they divorced shortly after i stayed\nwith my mom\nmom was not right in in a lot of ways um\ndealt with a lot of problems\nuh lived in a shack in the on a mountain\nside in\nhawaii uh no electricity no running\nwater um\nbasically rain water with a fire for\nshowers in an outhouse and just running\naround barefoot\num kind of went to school had a lot of\nmedical issues as a kid because of the\nunsanitary conditions\num slept back and forth between her and\nother other people\nuh was taken out of the home my home\nseveral times by the state\nalways returned um very very\num very bad abuse um in a lot of ways\nthere um\nyou know eating out of dumpsters because\nshe was trading you know\num food stamps for drugs and stuff like\nthat so it was really rough\ni went back and forth between my dad on\nthe mainland panhandling for money with\nhim\nso they could buy more drugs it was just\na really [ __ ] situation\num then when i was 10 taken out\nbrought to the mainland put in a\nchildren's home um\nwas there by myself until i uh i\ngraduated high school\num went into the military was the only\nopportunity i had because i was\ni had a hard time in school uh went uh\nwent to war\ncame back uh did katrina recovery came\nout\num didn't really have qualifications did\nsome jobs got into transit officer\ndid some other things got into hotels\neventually\nplaying poker learned how to gamble\nwhich got me into the stock market which\ngot me into penny stocks which was\nstupid blew up all my accounts\num then ended up learning about actual\nstocks and actual investing and trading\nand\nthat grew a passion learned about\neconomics and finance\nand grew a huge passion started getting\ngood at trading and investing started\nmaking good money off of it uh really\ngood money off of it\num then i had a really bad year lost my\nuh my mother my father my brother and\nanother family member in one year but\nbefore that they were sick so a lot of\nmoney went to helping\num so i had to decide do i go back to\nwork and go back to trading so i did\nboth\nand then um started streaming just for\nfun because i was tired of\ngoing online looking for community uh to\ntrade stocks\nand talk stocks but everything was\neither pump and dump or a scam or\nselling courses or just idiots so i was\nlike let me create my own\nstarted out with the fun djen stuff\nfound that people really really enjoyed\num d-gen stuff like just yoloing\nlike taking ten thousand dollars and\ngambling it on a\nwild stock you know for fun for content\num\nbut then i realized that people actually\nwanted to learn this stuff\nand i was able to teach it in a manner\nthat people understood it\nand it just kind of grew from there and\nnow here we are\nthat's quite the story yeah i left a lot\nout because i don't want to drag it out\nbut yeah\nthat's horrifying\noh i got married had a kid too yeah i\nthink we figured that part out\nyeah yeah um but you know if you left a\nlot out\ni mean what what you put in didn't seem\nseemed like quite the painful ride\nyeah it sucked\nlet me think about how to ask this can i\nthink for a second yeah go for it go for\nit\ni'm usually not this open but i i mean\nit my chat knows my backstory\nfor the most part\nwhile you're thinking i'm gonna go turn\ndown the ac is that cool sure yeah go\nfor it\nme\nman i have no idea where to go from here\nso much\nsorry about that okay cool no that's\ntotally fine um so uh\ntsg i find myself being incredibly\ncurious and fascinated about your\npersonal journey\num you know there's a lot of stuff in\nthere that sounds\nabsolutely like devastating to live\nthrough\ni think that there's a really\ninteresting like dichotomy between\nthe background that you share in the\nperson that you are today\nlike you seem happy to me\ni mean we all have our personal\nstruggles um\nyou know stream i like what i do\nand this is why i'm so passionate about\nstreaming because it's a moment for me\nto forget\nany other issue and to\nto to to give other people happiness joy\nor\num you know um help them\nbetter their lives or you know i mean it\ngives you that purpose like you go\nthrough your life\nnever having a real purpose feeling like\nyou're just kind of like running a race\nbut you don't know where the finish line\nis\nand now it's like hey i found a path it\nmight not be the right path but\nif i follow it maybe that's where the\nfinish line is you know i'm saying so at\nleast i'm\nit's kind of given me that purpose and i\nand i'm really passionate about it yeah\nyeah and i've built a great community\nwell i haven't built it they've built it\nbut it's an amazing community\nokay so i'm gonna\nsay this again so you seem happy\ni mean i try to be i try to be i i've\ngot my own demons i deal with you know i\nmean\nand and i tell these guys all the time\nyou know everything you see stuff online\nit's usually\na highlight reel right people put up\ntheir highlight reels everybody i had a\nconversation about this today\nyou know everybody sees the highlight\nreel so yeah i mean i i struggle with\ncertain things but\num i think that um i'm in a better place\nnow than i have been in other times in\nmy life\nso i want to highlight a couple of\nthings so one is that\nyou know the relationship i want to be\nlike a little bit precise with our\nlanguage\nso one is that you know it sounds to me\nlike\nyou have your struggles you have your\ndemons that you fight\nbut that really having purpose is what\nallows you to have the strength to deal\nwith those struggles\nwhat would you say to that i'd say it's\nmore of a distraction\ninteresting can you say more about that\noh we're gonna get deep here okay um i\ndon't usually talk about my stuff but\ni'll i'll do it sorry because it's\njust pausing for a second so we're\nhitting the border of my guilt okay\nso we're here to learn about you and to\ntry to help you but also\ni don't want you to say anything that\nyou don't feel comfortable saying\noh no no i'm not going to push into that\ni'm just i'm just i'm just i mean\nfor the for for the purpose of this you\nknow it's good because i'm a very big\num advocate of of seeking or talking\nabout things and not bottling them up\nobviously though i'm on a platform where\nthere's a lot of people so i have to be\ncareful\num but um what i mean by distraction so\ni think that\nand i say this a lot i feel like a lot\nof the funniest people do it because\nthey're hiding pain\num and it's it's a way of of of of\ndealing with that right so for me um\ni think it's a distraction because not\nonly does it give me a purpose but when\ni'm doing this\ni'm not focusing on the other stuff this\nis my focus\nand so the other issues of not sleeping\na lot or having you know physical pains\nor\nyou know potential mood swings or\nanxiety or depression or whatever else\nyou deal with\nthis right here is you're on stage\nthere's the lights\nyou know that's it you know the crowd is\ndarkened it's you\nand you're focusing on what you do and\nyou know that there's good feedback\nyou're doing a good thing\nit's a great distraction it doesn't take\naway but it does a good job of\ndistracting it's kind of like when you\ndeal with\nhorrible trauma whether it's in as a\nchildhood or in war\nyour brain sometimes compartmentalizes\nthat\nand and and you'll block out certain\nthings that you would normally remember\nyour brain does that or\nit'll compartmentalize it and let it\nsurface when you're sleeping and you\nhave night terrors or whatever\nso i think that this is it it helps with\nwhat issues i do face with i think it's\na great distraction\num not a cure but a distraction\nand what about the cure\num i'm not a doctor so i mean i'm not\ngoing to say that there is no cure for\nthese things i mean i'm sure that\ntherapy helps i'm sure that uh oh [ __ ]\ntesla thank you\num i'm sure that medication stuff like\nthat you know which i've i've i've\ntalked and i've gotten some issues\nor help with the issues i've had um and\ni'm and you know\num but at this point i'm at that age\nwhere it's like\nyou know i'm not cynical or apathetic to\nthe idea of curing it but i've just kind\nof\ndealt with it so long i'm just kind of\nused to it\ni think that makes a lot of sense let me\njust\nlet me just repeat back what i heard so\nas you said\ni'm not a doctor so i can't say that\nthere's no cure\nbut basically there's no cure\nthat's why no no no no i believe that\nthere\nthere definitely is something out there\nor there are\nopportunities but for me i'm just like\nwhy do what why do you believe that\nwell because i've been able to\nget certain things that have helped me\nmove away from certain things\nbut at the same time i'm not one of\nthose guys who i'm a veteran\ni've dealt with other veterans and i've\nseen veterans dealing with stuff and the\ncure was\nthem medicating them until they're a\nzombie i can't live that kind of life i\nwould rather\nlive who i am in pain than live as a\nzombie but not deal with\ncertain issues not that i'm against\nmedication i'm just saying i saw that\nnow\nthat doesn't sound like so as a\npsychiatrist and a medical doctor\nmedicating someone to the point of being\na zombie is not what i would consider a\ncure\ni would consider that a bad thing as\nsomeone who prescribes medication\nfor people to help with their mental\nhealth i mean that's not a cure dude\nthat's\neverything that is wrong with our mental\nhealth system\nis that we sometimes all we do is\nmedicate people until they're zombies\num but this is where i'm beginning to\nthink that maybe this conversation is\ngoing to be far more important than i\nthought at the beginning\nbecause i i i'm beginning to think\nthat um\ni'm beginning to think that you don't\nhave to live the way that you do\nand i think that it's reasonable that\nyou live the way that you do because\nthat's all you've learned like you said\ni think your your brain learned how to\ncompartmentalize\nat a very very early age and so what i'm\nhearing you kind of say is that like\nthis is a distraction\nbut like when the distraction ends\nyou're back to kind of where you were\nand that your life is sort of filled\nwith these compartments of\nof suffering basically and and that\nyou've learned how to adapt and live and\nthrive\nin spite of all of the things that you\nhave to deal with like you've learned\nhow to cope\nright and successfully so what do you\nthink about that\ni think there's i think um sorry i'm out\nof my element here because normally i'm\nmeaning in chat and talking about this\nand these guys have never seen me like\nthis i know but these guys have never\nseen me get this kind of deep with it\nand\nit's a little bit out of character and\nnormally we're talking about the market\nand all this stuff right now but so\ni'm a little out of my element here so\nand i'm in front of you know\nseveral thousand people so it's uh it's\na little bit uh it's a new experience\nfor me so\nforgive me if i have any trepidations or\nany kind of like you know um\nhesitations but um\nyeah i mean i i it's not so much an idea\nof just deal with it it's just\nit's just like for example i had a birth\ni have a birthmark right i have a\nbirthmark that covers\nthe front half of my chest my arm and\nhalf my back right\nas a child i was very conscious of it i\nwas very self-conscious of it i'd wear a\nshirt in the pool\nand i would worry about people staring\nand stuff like that but as time went on\nand i got older\ni forgot i even had it yeah it's still\nthere sure every now and then i'll see\nit in the mirror and i'll remember it's\na thing but i'm not conscious of it\nanymore i'm not worried about it anymore\nit's just part of who i am and that's\nkind of with those issues it's just\nbecome part of who i am and it's just\nnormalized for me\nyeah so i understand that it's\nnormalized so i think um\nokay can i think for a second please\nso first thing i want to talk about is\ntrepidation you don't\nneed our forgiveness for your hesitation\nor trepidation\nthe first thing that we have to\nacknowledge is you say that i'm not used\nto being like this\nthe first question is do you want to be\nlike this in this moment\nor is this uncomfortable for you and you\ndon't want to be like this\nas far as dealing with the issues that i\nhave the way i have this direction of\nthe conversation how okay with this\ndirection are you oh i'm fine if i'm\nuncomfortable i'll let you know i mean\ni'm okay right now yeah\ni'm not i'm not gonna hide anything here\nso so the next\nquestion then is like okay let me give\nyou a let me give you an analogy okay so\nuh tsg i was working with a a parent and\nand she had a special needs child and so\nshe came to me because\num you know i'm holistic and all that\nkind of stuff and\nand so she had been diagnosed with\nvarious stuff that probably wasn't very\naccurate it really probably had to do\nwith just\nthe difficulties of having a special\nneeds child you know she had\nand kind of really like when you have a\nchild you i'm sure you sort of\nunderstand this a little\nbit um you know you have expectations\nuh of what your life is gonna be like\nand and sometimes you have hopes\nabout what your child is you know what\nyour relationship with your child is\ngonna be like and\nand for some people they really build up\nthis this kind of fantasy in their mind\nof like having children\nand so for her there was a lot of\ndifficulty because like all these things\nthat she had kind of envisioned\ndoing um like you know teaching her\ndaughter how to dance and teaching her\ndaughter like passing on certain things\nthat she\nshe cared about and just really\nrealizing that like her daughter's never\ngoing to be able to do like any of that\nstuff\nand and not only is she not going to be\nable to do that stuff she's going to be\nlike in diapers her entire life\nyeah and and so it's it's just really\nchallenging\nand so i was having a conversation with\nher and we'd worked together for a long\ntime and\nand you know she was like i'm doing a\nreally good job of like\ncoping but it's it's hard and like every\nday was about\ncoping coping coping coping coping and i\nteach her this meditation technique i'd\nteach her that meditation technique\nand you know one day we kind of sat down\nand i just said like this isn't gonna\nwork\nand she was a little bit taken aback\nbecause usually like i'm supposed to be\nthe hopeful one right\nand and she was like what do you mean\nthis isn't going to work and i was like\nyou can't keep coping for the rest of\nyour life like that's just not\na that's not a life like constantly\nputting out fires and constantly like\ncoping because you're on the verge of\nbreakdown and meditating your way\nthrough your anxiety is like that's just\nnot\nit's not gonna work right you can only\ncope so much at some point\nyou need to like have relief or\nlike this problem needs to like resolve\nitself in some way right like you can't\nyou know it's kind of like if your boat\nis sinking and you're bailing water like\nyou can't\nsustainably bail water like sure it\nworks in the moment\nbut at some point you got to like plug\nthe holes does that make sense\nno it makes sense for sure i mean i i'm\non board with you there i\ni mean for me i just i don't know if\nit's so much\ni mean i've i've always been this person\nwhere like i said\num i've had a hard time even building\nrelationships right like i i the reason\nis is because\nyou know and i don't mean that this is\ngonna sound so sappy but i'm just gonna\nsay it because it'll move the\nconversation in the right direction\nyou know i didn't hear the word i love\nyou until i was\n20. you know mom never\ndad never never a hug never uh never uh\nnever uh\nnever uh uh how was your day never any\nof that right\nso when i was a small child i didn't\nbuild that understanding of\nrelationships\nof longing of of missing of feeling you\nknow wanted and accepted\nso for me i've always struggled with\neven\ni mean i have to rem i have to be\nreminded to call a family member after\nthree or four weeks just because it's\njust it doesn't it doesn't register\nmy you know my my friends or my family\nleave i don't miss people\ni don't get butterflies in my stomach\nyou know what i'm saying so like\nfor me it's always i've always lived in\nthis instant gratification um\nlifestyle and it led to a lot of\ndestructive behaviors when i was younger\nand so that's something that i've dealt\nwith and so when i look at something\nlike that\nit it makes it more difficult you know\nto look down the down the path and say\nhey\nyou know i look forward to having a wife\nand kids and grandkids in a little\ncottage\nfor me it's like i just i just see\nemptiness and i don't know what's what's\nup and i'm just like ah [ __ ] it you know\nwhat i mean let's let's\njust do the best we can\nthat sounds wonderful it sounds [ __ ]\nhorrible it's terrible\nthat's why i love streaming so much\nbecause i just need what's\nwhat's horrible about it because\nbecause you get jealous looking at other\npeople who have like a\nthis is actually taking i really i'm now\ni'm just ruining my whole brand because\ni'm telling people always have a plan\nand i have a plan i'm just saying like\nit's not about not having a plan it's\nabout it's about that that that\nbuilding that through time i just had a\ndaughter so i think that a lot of that's\nchanging\nbecause i'm i'm worried about her you\nsee what i'm saying\nlike it's the first time i'm worried\nabout somebody and so i go and i check\non her and i hear and stuff like that so\ni think it's\nreally really um really awesome do i\nhave a plan yeah i have a plan but i\nthink that\nit's just one of those things where man\ni'm getting deep in front of a lot of\npeople but um\ni think it'll help maybe help somebody\nout there so i wanna i wanna be able to\nsay what i can\num you know i i i just it's just that\nfeeling of like\nof like like i said the whole idea of\nrunning the marathon or running the race\nbut not knowing where the finish line is\nlike you're just running around\nlooking for something you think you know\nwhat you're looking for\nbut until you see it you don't know\nwhere it is you were hoping for a path\nand i'm trying to give myself that path\nwhat's it like to not know where your\nlife is going\nit's always been [ __ ]\nbut i think that through a lot of\na lot of things that have been happening\nrecently in my life they're starting to\nthey're starting to become a path i tell\nthese guys all the time you may be\nhaving a really bad year\nbut you can't give up because you never\nknow 2019 right 2019\num lost my mother lost my father are you\nafraid that you're not gonna\nbe able to walk that path even if you\ncan see it\ncan you can you mean like not walk the\npath if i can i mean are you\nconcerned that like because you kind of\ntalk a little bit about other people\nright so you like mentioned for a moment\nso i said that sounds wonderful and you\nwere like\nit's horrible and then you were like\nkind of like other people can\nsee where they're going like other\npeople have like things that they\nwant and that they're looking forward to\nand what i'm hearing from you\nno no no i'm not i'm not trying to\ncompare myself to other people because i\nthink that comparing yourself to the\npeople is just a keeping up with the\njoneses and you will\nspend your entire life trying to have\nsomething that not even you you just\nbecome\nthe shell and you spend all your money\nand time i don't mean other people as in\nas in like all other people i mean like\ni'll see my wife and her relationship\nwith her mother\nthey talk on the phone four five six\nhours a day they laugh they talk they\nthey look forward to it every single day\ni feel like it's a burden no because i\nlike i gotta\ni gotta remind myself to call people and\nthen as soon as i'm on the phone i'm\nlike looking for an exit\nand what's it like to be like that\nlonely\nfrustrating what's frustrating about it\nwell because it's like when you don't\nwant to be in a certain position or\ncertain situation\nbut yet you're there it's frustrating\nit's like being in traffic right like\nyou want to get to your location you\nwant to go there but you're stuck in\ntraffic\nand it's the same kind of thing it's\nlike other people in the other lanes are\ngoing by\nand you're just sitting there and you're\nlike what the [ __ ] you know and so\nthat's kind of the analogy i would use\nyeah that's a beautiful analogy so so\nwhere is it that you're stuck what is it\nthat like when you look over to the\nother lane and you see other people\ngoing by what is it that you wish\nyou had that other people seem to have\nthat you seem to not have i don't want\nwhat other people have\nwhat i just i just i'm just hoping\nand this is it's starting to happen with\nthe stream and the purpose and the\nfamily\nfrustrating because it's so much work\nbut it's i'm a workaholic my wife will\ntell you i never stop working\n24 7. anything i do i i just work work\nwork until i get to the top of it\nwhether it was working in\nyou know as an officer working in hotels\neven streaming she made a joke about it\nshe goes\nwhen you started streaming i i didn't\nrealize you know whatever and then you\nknow\nthrough a lot of circumstances here we\nare it's because i don't stop working\nbecause\ni need to be busy and the reason i need\nto be busy is because if i have idle\nhands i do destructive things because\ni'm bored or because i'm just\nyou know i i i need something so i'm\nalways busy\nso i'm i'm getting a little bit of um\ndissonance a little bit of cognitive\ndissonance from you\nso and let me just lay this out i know\nit's going to sound [ __ ] weird\nso you do this beautiful job of talking\nabout an analogy\nwhere you're in one lane and you see the\nother people going by\nand then when i ask you\nyou know what is it about like you're\nstuck in traffic and other people are\ndriving freely like\nhelp me understand what it is about\nother people that\nyou know you want and then you've said\nthis twice now where you're like oh i\ntry not to compare\nmyself to other people which i think\ntotally makes sense i'm completely\nbehind\nwhat you're saying that it leads to\nkeeping up with the joneses and egos and\ncomparisons and things like that\nand at the same time i think like so\nthere's one part of your mind that's\nsort of like i don't compare myself to\nanyone else i am who i am\nthis is me i have a unique situation\ntotally behind you with you 100\nand yet there's still this part of you\nthat's sort of like drawing these\nanalogies about like\nyou know you make comparisons because\nyou talk about how your wife\ntalks to her mom for like four hours a\nday and when you talk to someone on the\nphone you can't wait to get off the\nphone\nso it's sort of weird because like i'm\nseeing and hearing comparisons but when\ni\nwhen i try to dig into them with you i\nkind of get\nblocked\ndoes that make sense yeah i i think i'm\njust i'm just not\nreally good at explaining it because i'm\nnot really used to talking about this\nstuff\num i'm kind of doing it very ambiguously\ni think not on purpose but i think it's\njust\nit's just me trying to put my thoughts\ntogether and it's just not coming out\nclearly\nso uh that's exactly why we're here\ni'm sorry one second\nokay um we work in the ambiguous\nterritory that's where we want yeah\nabsolutely\nabsolutely um no i mean uh you know\ni think i think back to what i was\nsaying about relationships i think that\num i think i want to know what it's like\nto have those feelings\nthe feeling of longing for someone the\nfeeling of like that love that warm you\nknow\nyou know i'm saying like missing\nsomebody looking forward to seeing\nsomebody\nand not the idea of oh god i gotta go do\nthis or i gotta do this or you know\num oh i gotta you know whatever or\nwhatever i'll do it another time i think\nthat's something that would be\nis very very uh it's something that i\nalways look at and say you know what\ni wish i had that it's not that i'm\njealous of other people that are having\nit\ni just kind of wish i had it in in my\nown way you know what i mean like i'm\nnot mad at somebody else for having like\ni'm super happy that my wife\nhas a great relationship with her mother\ni just like i wonder what that's like\nand it seems like it's a nice thing yeah\nso tell me when you're on the phone with\nsomeone how do you feel\nit depends on why i'm on the phone with\nthem\nthat's a good answer so so so let's say\nlike a family member\ni don't have much family left but like\nif it's my if it's my grandfather\nyou know i want to check in to make sure\nhe's okay you know he's older\num and then sometimes we share stories\nwhich are fun but then it's like okay\ncool\nyou know talk to you later talk to you\nlater if it's uh\ndo you feel satisfied by that\ninteraction\ni guess to be a level of satisfaction am\ni satisfied that he's doing better am i\nsatisfied that we had a talk\neither which one are you satisfied by\ni'm obviously satisfied that he's he's\ndoing well because he's older and i\ndon't want anything to happen to him but\nyou know um you know i've had a lot of\nfamily members\nthat i lost and some of it i didn't feel\nanything\nyou know what i mean it's like what do\nyou think about that\ni think it goes back to the whole idea\nof not having that connection\nyou know it's like it's like when you\nlose somebody that you have that\nconnection to\nthere's much more you know pain and\nsorrow and emotional\nyou know draining but when you\nlose somebody who like for example if\nyou lost the if\nyou if your best friend you grew up and\nplayed football with in high school you\nfound out died in a car accident that's\ngoing to hit you\nbut a dude who was you're in band camp\nwith that you guys played on the same\nline\nyou knew him but you know you're like\nthat sucks\nyou know whatever but it's not going to\naffect your day-to-day life yeah\nmake a lot of analogy so you'll have to\nforgive me i'm a very visual learner\nso i always use analogies so that i can\nsee what i'm talking about\nlove it bro i think it's it's a great\nway to explain\nwe'll get to that too about why you do\nthat\num and and so let me ask you something\ntsg are you do you feel lonely\num ah wow\num i mean\noh god oh that's a hard one to answer\ndo i feel lonely i mean you know\n[ __ ] uh\ni don't even know how to answer that\nit's not a simple yes or no\nthat means that it's the right question\noh [ __ ] right so this is this is the\nbarrier of our understanding\nand it's complicated right and so when i\ntalk about\ncure cure isn't really the right word\nbut when i talk about resolution so here\nlet me explain for a second okay\nso i may do a lot of explaining today so\nlet me start by saying that tsg i think\nyou're an awesome\nguy dude like it's amazing\nwhat you've built out of the life that\nyou were given\nlike i'm truly truly impressed um\nand i think unfortunately like as you've\nastutely\nrealized you sort of like weren't\ngiven some of the basic rule book like\ngrowing up\nright like you said like you weren't\ntold like you don't know what it's like\nto miss someone or love someone or or\nwhatever\ni mean you're learning now um and and\nyou know you put your mind to it which\nis also fantastic\nbut like there are a lot of things that\npeople take for granted which like you\nhaven't been able to take for granted\nlike missing people and so\ni think when we talk about it not\nnecessarily cure but like what\ni would call it resolution or\nintegration so this is the other thing\nis that you've learned how to\ncompartmentalize stuff\nand so you're kind of a workaholic\nbecause like work is your distraction\nand like what does it distract you from\nthe personal struggles whatever they may\nbe\nand this is where like when we think a\nlittle bit about work-life balance and\nthings like that when we think a little\nbit about you know what the next decade\nof your life is going to be like\nand and what your daughter\nkid is is going to you know learn from\nyou like what is she going to learn from\nyou about work\nand and things like that and and how are\nyou going to sort of balance that\ni think it's worthwhile to think a\nlittle bit about you know do you\ndistract yourself\nso much because the things aren't\nresolved\nand in order to resolve those things i\nthink they can be resolved i don't think\nyou have to distract yourself so much\nwhat are those things are these like\nissues of you know loneliness\nwhere you know that's just one word but\nit means so much more\nit's not just lonely because like you\nknow your family's around\nand you like you have the community and\nthere are all these things that you have\nthat should be an antidote to loneliness\nand what i'm hearing from you is that\ndespite you having a lot of stuff\nthat makes it so that you're not\nshouldn't be lonely\nand on a day-to-day basis i would even\nsay that like you know you don't really\nfeel\nlonely like your wife pops in and then\nyou you're with your daughter and you're\ndoing this and you're\nbeing a dad and you're being a husband\nand you're talking to the community and\nyou're supporting people and like so you\nhave a lot of people around\nand you have like important connections\nwith those people but i also get the\nsense that you're\nkind of alone that like even though\nthere are people around and you have\nthese relationships that like\nthere's some kind of like connection\nthat's missing that like you know\nit's almost like there's a color that\nyou can't see\nbut you know it's there and so when you\ntalk to your grandfather it's like oh\ni'm happy because my grandfather's doing\nwell but\ni i feel like i should feel something\nmore i just don't\nknow because i never really have\nhow am i doing no i mean i think i think\nyou're you're on\non a decent tractor i mean yeah it's\njust because like i mean\nthis is gonna sound horrible [ __ ]\nhorrible but at least it\nunderstanding if for some reason\nyou know what i have is taken away from\nme tomorrow\ni'll be able to continue on\nokay and i need to say that because i\ndon't want people being like a\nmisunderstanding from from an outside\nperspective saying oh\nif you if your wife and child or your\nhouse or your job or everything went\naway you'd be able to continue on\ni've just been on my own my whole life i\nwould never want that to happen\nbut for the transparency conversation i\nthink it's\nit's it's important that i say that so\npeople understand what we're talking\nabout because\nthat's that's some deep [ __ ] right there\nyeah tsg i think we all\nknow that i don't think anyone who's\nwatched this whole conversation\nis surprised to hear that and i think\nwhat you've\nlearned how to do is to be alone to\nexist\nalone right and so i have no doubt that\nthat you know it would hurt and on one\nlevel you would be devastated\nbut like you're an old hand at being\nabandoned\nyeah yeah i mean and and a lot of times\nit's like\ni mean veteran from the military or from\na veteran being\non your own it's a play on words both\noh okay as i say because i'm both i\ndidn't know if you were trying to make a\nconnection there or not my bad\nnever yeah but you were saying sorry\nno i was just agreeing with you yeah for\nsure yeah\nso how do you what do we do about that\nwell i mean like i said i've i've i've\nfound two focus in my life that i'm\ni know it's not it's not a cure and it's\nnot it's it's just transferring the same\nthing i did before of distracting from\nuh destructive behavior which was\ndrinking and gambling and smoking and\ndoing crazy stuff\nand now instead of using that as a\ndistraction i'm using two new things and\nthat's one is the stream the job the\nhelping people which is great feels good\nand now the idea that i have a sole\npurpose of two things that my daughter\nnever struggles the way i did\nand that she can grow up to be proud of\nher father that's the only two things\nthat are on my mind on a day-to-day\nbasis\nis building this so that i can build a\nlife for her and\nand making sure that i am a man that she\nis proud to call her father\nthose are the two things i give a [ __ ]\nabout now what's it like to have a\nfather that you're not proud of\noh okay we're not doing this okay okay\num what's it like to have a father\nyou're not proud of\nhold on when you say we're not doing\nthis does that mean you\nyou're allowed to say we're not doing\nthis and we're not gonna do it oh no no\nno it's an expression i say\nlike we're like like i'm talking to me\nand myself like we're not doing this\nwe're not gonna like\nlike show too many emotions here okay\nnot you and i are not doing this like\nwe like like well that sounds\nschizophrenic that's not what i meant\nbut like\nit says expression i say like we're not\ndoing this okay so let me let me\ncontinue on\num uh it sounds like you learned how to\ntalk to yourself because you maybe\ndidn't have other people to talk to\nno no no no no i i say it to chat all\nthe time and i'm like we're not doing\nthis like we're not gonna move this to\nlevel but usually like\ni'm not going to give you the reaction\nthat you want but that's not what i\nmeant here so just please ignore what i\nsaid it's for\nlegal purposes i didn't mean like you\nand i are not going to do this let's\njust move on\nmake me sound schizo for a second not\nthat there's anything wrong with that um\nall right uh my father so the difference\nbetween my mother and my father is that\ni didn't i didn't i knew my father loved\nme i knew he loved me\nhe had demons inside he dealt with\nopioid drug addiction his entire life up\nuntil\nhe died of a fentanyl overdose a few\ndays a few years ago\nand i saw him shell away\nand despite all the pain he caused me\nbecause of the things he did i knew that\nhe didn't do it out of\nmalice out of ill intent he was doing it\nbecause he was a slave to the drugs and\nan addiction and he had these demons\ninside so i knew that he loved me\nand so i loved him for that i wasn't the\nbest son\nbecause obviously my own issues but\nyou know i i\ni felt horrible and i wish i could have\ndone something to help him but a million\ntimes it was\nlet's get into rehab let's get him clean\nlet's do this but it just it just\nstopped and it was always\nneeding money or robbing and he would do\nsome of the dumbest stuff\nlike he one time asked me when i was a\ntransit officer\nhe was like this guy stole my tv can you\ngo in uniform with your weapon and and\nknock on his door and get it back i'm\nlike do you realize you just asked me to\ncommit a felony\nto get your tv back that you probably\nsold for drugs like he doesn't think you\nknow so\nthat one was tough but i always loved my\nfather i loved my father in a way that\nwell you don't realize you love somebody\nuntil they're gone sometimes but like\ni i don't know if the love was there but\ni didn't dislike my father my mother on\nthe other hand\nwas an evil person so two different\nthings\nhow did you know your father loved you\nhe never hurt me intentionally\nand he would try when he was in a sober\nmind\nto do good things\nlike what you know like\nsay things you know like like for\nexample like my father would try if he\nwas sober to make sure that i was fed or\nto make sure\nthat you know i was safe i guess\nlike i mean most of my childhood's been\nblocked off so\na lot of the things i used to remember i\ndon't remember anymore um\nbut uh but yeah you know my father my\nfather was was not a bad person\ni know that he he everything he did he\ndid\nfor the addiction\nand so i can see through that as\nsomebody who's dealt with his own demons\nand say\nhe hurt people not because he wanted to\nbut because it was just\nwho what what what that addiction did\nand it was never a male intent and you\ncan tell the difference between\nhurting someone physically or doing\nsomething because you're getting your\nfix\nno you can i definitely can because i've\nseen it i've been there you know we've\nall been you know not all\nyeah so what i'm hearing is that\nyou know i know it sounds kind of weird\nbecause you mentioned like panhandling\nand heroin use and stuff like that but\ni'm i'm still getting the sense that you\ncould tell that your father like\ncared about you like you thought\nabout okay you know before i get high\ni'm gonna make sure like here's\nhere there's half a pizza in the fridge\nif you eat it get hungry\nand yeah i mean i didn't get to spend as\nmuch time with my father but\num when i would see him you know there\nhe would he would he would come and give\nme a hug and say stuff you know what i\nmean like like\nlike later on in life\nyeah um [ __ ] i don't remember a lot of\nwhat he would say um sometimes he would\nsay love you bud\nlater on in life but i'd already been\npast all that other stuff\nso that was kind of important to me\nbecause it was like hey you know he\nwouldn't say that\nin that moment unless he meant it you\nknow what i mean i may not feel it but i\ni know he meant it\nyeah yeah so you know just a\nquick intellectual side point how do you\nknow he means it\nbecause when he was high or trying to\nget something from me\nversus when he was just he didn't he\ndidn't ask for anything else\nhe did he didn't have any ulterior\nmotives it was just a goodbye hug\nlove you buddy there wasn't a there\nwasn't a game\nhey i love you can you do this for me\nyou know i mean there's a big difference\nbetween that\nyeah so so i think that that makes a lot\nof sense and i'm going to toss something\nelse out\nthat maybe the reason another reason\nthat you knew he loved you is because\nyou did feel something that you were\nunaware of\npotentially just something to think\nabout down the road\nyeah i think that that was you know one\nof those things where you know\nespecially towards the end of his life\ni felt a lot of you know i felt i i i\ndeal with guilt for some reason\nin a lot of things um and of course when\nsomebody\ndies you're like hey did i do enough to\ntry and save him did i\nwas i good enough to him in his final\nmoments to remember i mean i remember\nhe stayed alive i don't know i don't\nknow if he took his own life or he just\naccidentally overdosed\nbut you warned them enough about gmb\ndid i warn my dad enough about gme nope\ndid you warn him\nit's okay so so it's interesting right\nbecause i'm noticing a parallel between\nlike\nwhat oh okay you're going back to the\nbeginning of the conversation i was like\nsitting here talking about my dad taking\nhis own life and you're like did you\nwarn him enough about jimmy i'm like is\nthat a [ __ ] sick joke dude like i was\nabout to get pissed okay\nno okay um go back to what you're saying\nyeah sorry sorry about that i should\nhave been a little bit no it's not your\nfault\ni was i'm a visual person so i was\nsomewhere else when i heard that so i\napologize\ni shouldn't have gotten that go ahead\nwhat you're saying no your reactions i\nthink are fair\nit's just i i i was noticing that that\nthere's actually sort of like a common\nthread about like guilt and like doing\nenough for people\nuh like does that feel connected to you\nat all\nyeah i mean sorry i i got a little i was\njust\ni really feel bad about what i just did\ni didn't mean to like like\ni was really confused in the moment so i\napologize again\num yeah it goes back to guilt a lot of\ntimes and i don't know why because i\ndon't feel like i ever have i'll give\nyou an example my brother was passing\nwas was was had lung cancer and and\nliver cancer a lot of abuse to his life\nand i was reached out to and said hey\ncan you be a liver donor we can't get a\nliver to him\ncan you be a liver donor holy and\nand they said hey if you don't you know\nyou know we need you to do it and i was\nlike\nwait a second you my mother who i\nhaven't spoken to in years\nhave reached out to me after 10 years to\nsay\nyour brother's dying can you donate your\nliver or what part of your liver\ni'm like wait a second why because they\ncan't find a donor anywhere so now\ni am like wait a second\nyou're now asking me to be in a\nsituation to give a liver if i say yes\nit could save if i say no it could kill\nhim and i knew she was a manipulative\nperson but that just [ __ ] with me\nand so i sat on this for several days\nand i'm like if i give part of my liver\nit could save his life but at the same\ntime\nyou know i could i could recover or\nbecause i drank a shitload when i was\nyounger and i had fatty liver at one\npoint i could have complications from it\nand i'm like i have a wife now and i'm\ntrying to have a kid\nyou know what what do i do and so now\ni'm sitting here making this decision\nand i'm like holy [ __ ] man you know and\nthen i decided that you know i talked to\nsomebody and they said\nthey said to me they said um don't ever\num\ndon't ever make a decision based on\nguilt and they said are you doing the\ndecision because you want to or because\nyou'll feel guilty if you don't\nand so i didn't do it and my brother\ndied\nand i still live with that\nbecause i had to make a decision over my\nblood brother you know whatever even\nthough\nregardless of our relationship or the\nchances of me\nnot being there for my wife and\npotential daughter and that was a really\n[ __ ] up situation we put in and i had\nto make that decision so yeah\nthere's always guilt you know what i\nmean\ni mean there's no there's no way to make\na decision there and not have some kind\nof feelings\noh absolutely i'm just there's no way to\nlisten to that story and not have\nfeelings i'm just floored just by here\nlike\nby trying to imagine what your situation\nis\ni'm that was only 18 months ago by the\nway\nthat's crazy i just need a second to\nlike sit with\nhow impossible and shitty of a situation\nthat is\nyeah yeah it did yeah i didn't mean to\nlike derail this\ni i i don't think you can derail it it's\nall just part of the road man\nyeah i thought i was told that these\ntalks are usually pretty like just fun\nloving and stuff i didn't mean to like i\nmean i don't know i'm\nhave you seen our streams before no i\nhaven't that's the problem that's why i\ncame in so unprepared like i was i\nonly saw clips of you and it was always\nfunny [ __ ] so i don't know\nyeah i mean i'm trying to use humor to\nget out of this like awkward moment for\nme so\nyeah do let me get my gatorade\nyeah i'm just gonna yep\ngotta get out that's right\ndick joke no i didn't go anywhere i just\nwanted to get something to drink i was\nthirsty\nyeah yeah no it's all good\nyeah holy [ __ ] man yeah\nstocky uh stocky uncensored here\ntell me about your mom\ntell me about my mom um\n[Music]\nstripper um drugs um\n[Music]\nbecame a uh well never mind\nnot important um\nprobably had lots of mental health\nissues that i i don't know about um\nyou know we lived in a in a shack no\nelectricity no running water\nvery abusive um you know uh\nvery loved my sister uh for some reason\nand my sister's a great\nyou know my sister also had to deal with\na lot of these problems too but she you\nknow didn't\nshe she was upset when i was born\nbecause i was a boy um\nmy older brother dealt with a lot of it\na lot of abuse\nnot to get real into details but sure\nyou know\nsitting on raw rice for hours tying up\nwith a\nphone cord and cow prodding um you know\nhitting with a\nskillet across the face i got stabbed in\nthe face like lots of [ __ ] up things\num her boyfriend's everything on raw\nrice mean\nkneeling on raw rice so what you would\ndo is if your kid was\nacting up and you were a psycho you\nwould put raw rice and then make them\nkneel on it for a couple hours until it\nbrews them\nreally badly oh my god yeah yeah dealt\nwith some crazy [ __ ]\nso then uh so then um the uh the the\nstate would take away\nuh take us away for a little while put\nus with somebody else for a little while\nthen we'd come back so\ni don't want to get in any more details\nfrom that but uh pretty\npretty [ __ ] up situation um and uh\nand uh and uh dealt with a lot of severe\nabuse\num the whole family did uh and so that\nwas it um didn't really see her a lot\nmore after that\nonly saw her whenever she would try to\nget money from somebody suing somebody\nor trying to do whatever\num no love lost there no love lost there\ngood so so when when we were talking\nabout your dad you kind of mentioned\nthat your mom was like\nmalicious like it seems like she was\nlike\na bad yeah i think that i think that she\nwas abused probably when she was younger\nit was just her way of\nunderstanding how to deal with kids and\nthen because you know drugs get involved\nyou don't understand what you're doing\nand you just kind of\ndo it i i i at this point it doesn't\nmatter the reason behind it should\nhappen it's in the past you know i've\nmoved on from it well\ntried to do you ever wonder about your\nupbringing and how that could affect you\nas a father\ni think that my upbringing is going to\nmake me\nmake sure that those mistakes that i not\nmistakes but\nthe things that happen to me will never\nhappen um\ni've never lifted a hand to anyone\nyou know like in in in a personal com\nyou know issue you know obviously if i\ndifferent situations but you know i've\nnever even raised a hand to my wife\nor to a girlfriend or a family member\nyou know in that way\nthat's not who i am um i i i don't even\nthink i could if i wanted to\num you know i i i get frustrated as a\nperson who doesn't sleep and have a\nstream and the baby you know cries but i\ngrab her\nand i rock her and i sing songs to her\nand i love feeding her and i love her\nlittle smile\nand her cute little feet and she's she's\njust adorable when she's not screaming\nher head off like somebody's trying to\nmurder her\num so i i look forward to it and i've\nalready planned on all these little\nthings like i'm like\nhey maybe she wants to be tea time and\nprincess stuff and i'll get a a\nprojector and\nand get little little mermaid we'll\nwatch it or if she's into you know\nyou know other stuff we'll go i'll teach\nher how to survival or camping or\nwhatever like whatever she's into like\ni'm excited to\ngrow up with her and like kind of\nkind of give her that life like i don't\nwant to spoil her because i understand\nthe\nthe concept of hard work and how much\nthat's important but i'm really looking\nforward to just like\nbeing that dad you know what i mean like\nbeing in her life to the point where\nshe's like\ngod dad you're embarrassing you know\nlike like i wanna have fun you know and\ni wanna i wanna give her\ni never got to play catch with my dad if\ni think is what i'm trying to get at\nand i will forever understand and know\nand see people playing catch with their\ndad\nand and not know what that feeling is\nlike and understand it's like\nlet's play ball dad let's play ball\ni was i didn't get to do that so i want\nmy\ndaughter in whatever way she means that\nwhether it's tee time or throwing the\nball\ni want to be the guy when my daughter\nsays hey dad\nlet's play ball i'd be like you got it\nlet's do it\ni'm just gonna tear up here for a second\nand sit with those nah i don't i'm not i\nmean i'm just i'm just being real with\nyou you know what i mean like\nthis gives me i'm tearing up oh okay my\nbad\nis it okay no absolutely i i i'm not\nit's not my intention i'm just\nit's just it's just one of those things\nwhere you know um\nit's an opportunity i have and\nand i'm not gonna screw it up\nsounds like she's very lucky to have you\nas a dad\ni just want to be someone she's proud of\nas well i i wanna\ni wanna i wanna not just proud of but i\nalso\nto i want her to not\nhave to worry what it's like to be\nhungry\nto be cold to be sick to have your head\nshaved because you have lice\nto have intestinal problems i don't want\nher to have to\nbe picked up by her hair and punched\nuntil she pisses blood when she's seven\nyears old\ni don't want her to be locked in a\ngenerator room until she passes out from\ngas food you know gas fumes\ni don't want her to be taken from her\nhome i just want her to be comfortable i\nwant her to be loved i want her\ni want her to be happy\nand i want to be the one to give her\nthat happiness and i want to be the\nright father\nthat's what i want to do i want to give\nmy daughter everything that i wasn't\ngiven\nat the end of the day\ni'm going to need a second yeah go for\nit go for it\ntrying to think about how to put these\nwords together\nthis is tricky\nall right we'll just give this a shot\nso i want you to think for a second\nabout the life that you want to give her\nright and and what is it like\nto have grown up\nwith none of the things that you want to\ngive to your daughter\nlike i want you to take a moment to like\nimagine\nwhat it would be like like imagine how\nyou would feel if your\ndaughter did grow up with all of that\nstuff\nhow would that make you feel i\ni don't want to overdo it i don't want\nto overcompensate i don't want to\nover spoil her i'm not talking about\nthat let me rephrase\nso i want you to you know all what you\nsaid that you don't want your daughter\nto live through all of that stuff right\nright\nwell of course not no okay okay so so\nhow would you feel if she did\nand i had any ability to prevent it\nif you couldn't do a damn thing about it\ni can't even imagine that i can't i all\ni can think of is that\ni don't care if i have to sell hot dogs\non a corner or\nboxes in a fedex truck or if i've got a\nif i've got a you know it doesn't matter\nwhat i have to do i will not let that\nhappen so i can't even imagine it\nokay i will do anything how to make sure\nhow do you feel about those things\nhappening to you\nit's in the past i can't go back and\nchange the past i can only learn from it\nand be a better person and help\ntake the lessons or not even lessons\nbecause i didn't do anything wrong\nsee what that pain is like know what\nit's like and make sure that that that\nthat someone else doesn't ever see that\npain if i can prevent it\nso i think that that's a wonderful\napproach to take and i feel like it's\nincomplete\nbecause this is what i'm gonna try to\nshare with you okay tsg\nstalking so like i want you to think\nabout the feelings that you would have\ntowards your daughter right and she's a\nchild like she can't you can't protect\nyourself when you're seven\nand for those horrible things to happen\nlike it awakens\nshe's eight weeks now yeah yeah so it it\nawakens within you a profound\nemotion a profound protective instinct a\nprofound love\n[Music]\nand i want you to notice that there's\nlike a huge difference between the way\nthat you\nview that happening to her in the way\nthat you view it happening to yourself\nright it's like night and day yeah but\ni'm looking at it from the point of\nperspective is that i can prevent that\nfrom happening\nit it it's up to me like like she is\nshe's an innocent\ni understand that i i and i know you're\ngoing to i know this is weird\ni know it's weird i'm trying to follow\nyou i'm trying to follow you yep yep yep\ni think it's going to be\nvery foreign to you may not not even get\nbecause i think the concept so what i'm\nessentially talking about is like maybe\ni'll just put\nit make it a little intellectual what\ni'm talking about is self-compassion\nso what i'm hearing from you is that\nlike painful things have happened to you\nbut you don't really\nknow how to feel pity or love or\nanything like that like\ntowards your former self\ni i feel like my former self is is a\ndifferent person\nand i don't mean like that a better or a\nworse person i just feel like\ngood i just feel like you know what i\nfeel like you know those little russian\ndolls\nyes good okay it's kind of like that\nright yeah like like like\na little guy is inside but you're no\nlonger he's a shell he's inside that\nshell and now you became that guy\nand now you're in the military you were\nin uh\nacting you were in this that's what is\nthose people are in there\nbut there's been so many layers over\nthat i don't even recognize them and\nit's so hard to find them that it's just\nkind of you know they're there\nbut you got to work your way to get\nthere and i don't really like you\nokay if it's too much work that's fine\nif it's too much work that's\ncompletely that's an excellent reason to\nnot do it\nbut i think it's it's beautiful because\ni i think like this is the thing is like\nthat seven year old still needs\nall of the love that your daughter is\ngonna need from you\nyeah but that that part of your brain\nthat is developed during that time you\ncan't go\nback and rewire that you can re-learn\ncertain\nyou can learn new things but you're not\nthat i mean i'm not a doctor like i said\ni'm not a doctor but from my under my\nlimited understanding\nof the human brain and development that\nzero to\nthree year old of so many emotions being\nbuilt\ni mean you can rewire it but you can't\nlike get back that innocence and the\nunderstanding of it from that\nlevel like it's like okay give an\nexample it's like if you're in a\nrelationship and everything's great\nbut then you're cheated on you can learn\nto trust\nin your future relationships but you can\nnever get that innocence back\nbecause you'll always remember that\nalways have that small piece in the back\nof your head so that innocence is gone\nin your future relationships you can\nlearn to trust again you can forgive and\nyou can be with somebody else and say\ni trust this person but that innocence\nis gone\nand i think that that's what i was\ntrying to get like i can fix i can\nrewire my brain but that initial\nthing is never gonna be there and i\nrecognize that at least for me\nmaybe i'm wrong\nso i'm not so sure that i agree\nbut what i feel really confident in is\nthat there's like some middle ground\nso when we think about like trauma\ntherapy okay\nso like a big part of trauma therapy is\nsomething that we call processing\nand so part of that processing is like\nso there's compartmentalization with\ndistraction\nthere's learning from the past and being\na good father like all awesome stuff\ndon't get me wrong\nbut there's also like i get the sense\nstocky that\nyou know there's actually like a lot\nof relief to be had for you\nand and\nyou seem frustrated i'm not frustrated\ni'm just\nit's it's i believe you but like at this\npoint in my life it's like\ni've become so apathetic to the whole\nthing that\nlike i believe that there is but\ni'm i'm so i don't know maybe it's maybe\nit's i try to\ndistract myself maybe i'm just\nfrustrated with it maybe i've just given\nup maybe it's just\nit doesn't matter maybe i've got a new\nnew focus in life but like you're saying\nyou're never going to be that good\nfather you're never going to be that\nreally good father unless you can also\nheal yourself it's like i tell these\nguys all the time you can't learn they\nlike why am i not in a relationship why\ncan't i find somebody\nyou can't love someone else until you\nlove yourself\nwho said you couldn't be a good father\noh no no i'm not saying that i'm saying\ni could be a better father\nby by by i feel like i could be a better\nfather\nhow does it oh [ __ ] this is a whole\nthing\nso let me let me tell you what i just\nsaw so i saw maybe i maybe i said the\nwrong words and i was trying to get over\nsomething\ni'm pretty sure you said the right words\nso i saw frustration\nso i said stocky there's a way forward\nand you're like [ __ ]\nyou're not doing anything wrong and\nthere's no misspeaking everything is\nthere i i think it's it's\nit's it's perfect just the way it is\nokay you're not\nso let me explain to you what and like\nnow like this is i'm putting you in a\nreally tough situation stocky\ni never realized this until this moment\nbecause you have i don't think you're\napathetic i think you've tried really\nhard and like you've sort of given up on\nintegrating yourself and really fixing\nthis you're sort of like i can learn\nfrom the past i can be a good father i\ndon't have to fix myself\ni just have to stuff it all to the side\ni can distract i can do it i can do it\nand here i come and i tell you you can\nfix it\nand now you're like [ __ ] because if i\ndon't fix\nit then like am i not gonna be like am i\nletting my daughter down by not fixing\nit like i'm putting you in one hell of a\nbind bro\ni mean it's a two-way street for me i\nthink part of that\njadedness i wouldn't call it jadeness\nbut part of that\nthat that\nthat what i went through and what i deal\nwith is motivation to be a better father\nright but at the same time i don't know\nif it's just procrastination\nif it's if it's anxiety it's like i\ndon't know if i\nwant to to work on it like i don't know\nif i really want to\nbecause like i said i'm 35 at this point\nit's like\ni don't know if i even want to work on\nit because it's just part of who i am\nit's like the birthmark right\ndo i want to you know i mean sure i\ncould probably\npay to get this taken off or you know\nenlightened or whatever like that but\nit's just who i am i don't even pay\nattention it doesn't matter to me\nanymore like i\nit's it's out of sight out of mind i\ndon't actively think about it anymore\nyeah it's there and i'll notice it in\nthe mirror sometimes if i'm paying\nattention but\nit's like [ __ ] it's just who i am\nyeah i know it's much deeper than that\nbut i don't all know i don't know\ni i i i don't think you need to work on\nit\nand i don't think you want to work on it\nwhich i think is totally fine\ni think you're gonna be an amazing\nfather whether you work on this or not\nso i just i wanna i just wanna leave a\ngood impact on the world i wanna i want\ni wanna i wanna\nfeel like i have a purpose and i wanna\nleave a good impact i wanna you know i\ntold you with my daughter that's that's\nwhat i want to do i want to be that\nyou i don't matter as much anymore like\nin my mind\nnot to sound dark but i'm not worried\nabout me anymore\nas in as in not like i don't care i'm\nnobody\ni find the fact that i can give so many\nother people out there\nso much it feels like\ni don't know how to explain it you know\ni don't want to be famous i don't want\nto be\ni don't want to be you know them to\nwrite you know\nbooks or something about me but the fact\nthat\ni can get satisfaction by helping other\npeople change their lives whether it's\nthrough\nfinancial education or or or jokes or\nmaking them laugh or get them through\ntheir work day\nit feels good you know what i mean it's\nlike and i know this is probably gonna\ncircle back to though well you were\nnever wanted you never felt wanted as a\nkid and now you feel wanted\nso this is what you're doing you're\nmaking up for it i'm i know that i'm not\nno but that i feel like that's part of\nwhat's going to come from this\nbut do you think that's true oh i knew i\nknew i'd set myself up for this i knew i\nsaid second i said it i knew it i saw\nthe look in your eyes and i knew i set\nmyself i was confused because i was\ngoing to make the opposite\nconclusion oh please go on then go on no\nno but i'm curious what you think\nno no please please after you\nokay we'll just okay fine i'll go first\nso i what i was actually kind of\nconcerned about stocky was that\nyou know you know when have you mattered\nyou said you you've come to re like you\nknow you've come to put other people\nfirst which i totally get\ngood good for you good it's gonna make\nyou a good dad\nis gonna make you valuable on twitch\nthat you really care about\nyour community like i think that's\nawesome man but\nhave you ever mattered i put myself\nfirst before\nand i [ __ ] a lot of things up\nhmm because i'm a selfish son of a [ __ ]\nif i care about myself only\ni smoke i drink i gamble i [ __ ] uh i\num i do a lot of things that\nuh that that that that i i i'm not proud\nof\num and so and so\nyou know i try to be busy because i tend\nto find a purpose and focus\non um positive things and and keeping\nmyself busy you know what i mean so i\nthink that that's really really\nimportant because when i put myself\nfirst it's like\ni mean i'm working on it i'm trying to\nlike put myself first in healthy ways\nlike oh\ngo do this or go do that or go do this\nbut then i'm just bored and i'm like\n[ __ ] that i'll just work you know it's\nmore\nat least i'm working towards something\nrather than wasting time\nyeah so stocky i i you doing okay buddy\nyeah i'm just i'm just sometimes i say\nvery little with a lot of words and i'm\nlike\ni think sometimes you say a lot with\nvery few words\nmaybe um\nif you're curious about that all you\nhave to do is go back and watch the\nvaude about when i asked you if you're\nlonely\nyou okay yeah my wife grant walked in to\ngrab something and i was just telling\nher to\nbe careful yeah okay um\nso saki i'd like to share a couple of\nthoughts with you and then i'd love to\nget your thoughts about\nyou know or maybe i should ask well why\ndon't you go first this time\nbecause this is going to be but help me\nunderstand like what what what did we\ntalk about today\ni thought we were going to talk about\nthe problems with gambling addiction\nand finance fatigue and the dangers of\ndoing things\nand you were probably gonna maybe roast\nmy hairline and then we were gonna talk\nabout boomers joke about our indian\nwives\nwhich now sounds terrible that i said\nthat uh and i didn't have a good time\nbro\num i thought that was gonna be good\ntimes uh and then we were gonna make\njokes about you know\nroadies being around i was gonna tell\nyou about first time she cooked the\nwhole nine yards i thought that's what\nwas gonna happen but\nwe got deep but you know what i'm not\nupset about it not ashamed of any of it\nnot embarrassed of any of it i\ni i think that i like to tell my story\nnot as in-depth as we did here but i\nthink that it can help inspire people\num a lot of people always think that\nwhen they think about my\none of my big goals is to get people\nstarted whether it's investing or\nwhatever getting started and a lot of\npeople don't do it because it's so\nintimidating\nit's this big intimidating thing and i\ntell them it's like the gym right\nevery guy you see throwing up 400 pounds\neventually started small and if some guy\nlike me\nwho grew up with absolutely nothing came\nfrom conditions that were third world\nand and went through so many\nso much pain and struggle can still do\nit\nwhether it's investing or getting your\nlife or doing something you know\nmaybe that can help somebody else i\nactually like\ngiving some inspiration if it means me\ngiving my story so that's something good\nthat came out of it\nwill anything change probably not i mean\nnot not to sound like a\na dick but i mean i mean i don't know if\ni if\nif you know i'm gonna\nchange anything after the conversation\nbut it was nice to have the conversation\nand\nyou pointed out a couple things that i\ndidn't really think about what did we\nwhat did we what did we talk about\nthough and what were the things that i\npointed out that\nyou think may be worth thinking about\ni think that the idea of well maybe it's\nstuff that i said that i had my own\nself-realizations maybe maybe um but it\ncame out\nduring during the conversation was\nsomething for me to think about um\nbut uh um you know\ni i just realized i'm gonna be honest\nwith you let me be honest with you\nbecause i know this will\nthis will be good i think the one thing\ni realized\nout of this entire conversation is that\ni love my kid more than i thought i did\nand i don't mean that from a way of like\noh i just kind of liked my kid like\ni think that i just listened to myself\ntalk very open and honestly\nand that for the first time in my life i\nfound something that i do care about\nin a deep level and that i have a\nmission to make sure my daughter has the\nbest father that i could possibly be\ni think that was kind of cool\nyeah i i i think you're i agree\ni love my wife too i'm so sorry i'm\ntalking about my wife at all\nbabe i love you too i love you i'm i'm\nsteering clear of your wife\nfor the health of your marriage that's\nwhy we're not talking about oh no\nokay because because she can watch this\none day\nmy mother-in-law and father-in-law in\ndelhi watch it every single day my\nstream and it's\noh my god yeah terrifying well the good\nthing is that my father-in-law doesn't\nspeak english\nso so let me uh stocky let me just share\nwhat my\nimpression of the conversation is is\nthat okay\nand then i'd like to leave you with a\ncouple points to think about so the\nfirst thing is that uh you know it\nsounds like you had a super super\ntraumatic upbringing\nand what happens when people have a\ntraumatic upbringing is they can get\ntaught\na lot of weird things so one thing that\nthey\nlearn how to do kind of adaptively is\ncompartmentalize\nright so you take like negative feelings\nand sensations you kind of wall them off\nin a part of your mind\nand then sometimes even though you've\nwalled them off like\nthe energy is still there and it sort of\nlies dormant and it can kind of trickle\ninto your mind in other weird ways and\ncan lead to like destructive behaviors\nand the need to distract yourself okay\nso\nand it sounds like you used to distract\nyourself in unhealthy ways\nand now you distract yourself in healthy\nways\nand that's medication helps too but yeah\nthat's definitely a step in the right\ndirection\num and at the same time in my experience\nthe real goal is to like no longer need\nto distract yourself\nnow i recognize that that could be\nputting a burden on you but just\njust something for you to kind of\npercolate on\nso i also think that it's sort of\ninteresting because\none of the other things that i wonder a\nlittle bit about and it's\nit this is a super subtle kind of\nshift is that i think you're super\ngenuine\nabout having a dharma which is the\nsanskrit word for duty or responsibility\nto like the people around you\nand i think you genuinely carry that\nmantle of like trying to educate people\ntrying to teach people trying to help\nthem you absolutely carry that\nthat burden towards your daughter in\nterms of like you carry the\nresponsibility of being the best father\nyou can possibly be\nand so so you know so putting other\npeople\nfirst is like absolutely a genuine and\ngood move\nand then there are also times where you\nused to put yourself\nfirst and that was definitely bad so i\nget where you're coming from there\nthere's a nuance here\nthough that i think is just worth\nexploring\nwhich is that when kids are traumatized\na lot like they get\ntaught that they don't matter like the\nreason that\ni think you you know you say your dad\ncared about you is because like\nyou mattered to him through the haze of\naddiction and you sort of felt that\nright\nand and there's a subtle lingering\neffect which could be there could not be\nthere\nwhich is that i still don't know that\nyou matter\nto yourself right so so\nyeah so so there's a difference between\nsaying that other people matter\nmore than i do and\ni matter like there's a difference\nbetween saying\nmy value is a hundred dollars but my\nchild's value is a thousand dollars\nand sort of saying my value is a zero\ndollars and my child's value is a\nthousand dollars\nand this actually goes back to like the\nyou know the russian dolls\nwhich is that like i think each of those\npeople actually exist within you\nso when when we form memories like those\nmemories get laid down and sort of\nretain the age at which they were formed\nso i think within you there's actually\nlike a seven-year-old kid\nwho needs a lot of love because they\nweren't shown that and that need is\nthere\ni think this sort of translates into\nweird ways like\nsort of feeling lonely or like not being\nable to like really connect with people\nlike i know you love your wife\nit's clear that you do it's clear that\nshe loves you i know you love your\ndaughter\nbut that's just that's just stocky\nright that's the outermost russian doll\nthat is like\ncapable of feeling love and there are\nall those other dolls as well on the\ninside that like still\nlike it's hard to fully connect with\nsomeone when the only thing that they're\nconnecting with\nis the current version of you and so i\nthink this sort of gets back to like\nwhen you\nwhen i ask you are you lonely and you\nsay it's complicated i think the reason\nfor that is because\nsome layers of the doll are lonely and\nsome layers of the doll aren't\nthe last thing that i kind of two other\npoints the three other points actually\none is that i think part of the reason\nthat you use analogies and you use them\nreally really well\nis because you're probably somewhat\nalexa thymic\nso lexithymia is the inability to\ndetermine what your internal emotional\nstate is\nand so what that means is you're kind of\ncolorblind\nto emotions so if you go back and you\nwatch this interview\nlike you can describe\nthings really well with visual imagery\nbut because you don't have the\nvocabulary for the emotions themselves\nso you come up with these beautiful\nanalogies of like russian dolls\ncompartmentalized but you don't really\nknow like\nwhat the emotion is and so\nthe interesting thing is as you talk\nabout it what'll happen is sort of what\nhappened today\nis you're gonna like uncover like the\nemotions underneath and like today it's\nlike wow i really i didn't quite realize\nlike i knew i loved my daughter and i\nknew that i wanted to\nmake the world awesome for her and make\nher life awesome but not spoiler\nso that that's going to hurt her later\nin life i want her to\nteach her to be like an independent\nresponsible human being\nwhere you're going to support her\ninterests and you're going to support\nher growth\nand what you want to do is give her a\nnest and give her wings\nright you're not going to hold her back\nbut you're going to do everything that\nyou can to help her build her own life\nand i get that and it's through talking\nthrough things like this that you\nuncover those emotions you start to\nrecognize your emotions a little bit\nmore\nyou feel a little bit more it tends to\nfeel\nhopefully generally speaking positive\neven if it's not a positive emotion\nwhich i know is weird\nso i think it's just something to kind\nof think about the last two points that\ni want to share with you one is there's\na sunscript concept called\na some scar which is sort of like a ball\nof\nundigested emotion that you kind of\ncarry with you\nand that and i think you have a some\nscar sort of around\nguilt and what that means is that like\nyou've got this weird like\nguilt sort of like hiding in a closet\nthat then like\nmanifests in weird ways like it trickles\ninto your conscious mind and then\napplies to like\nother relationships that aren't entirely\nappropriate so i think part of the\nreason that you feel guilty around this\ngme stuff is because\ncognitively you know that you you give\npeople good advice\ncognitively you know you're not\nresponsible and in fact you go\nout of your way to try to help people be\nresponsible\nso then like where is that guilt really\ncoming from\nyou know because you you find yourself\nquestioning and and this is where i mean\nwe can go into\nyou know a whole lecture about this but\nbasically like it's been my experience\nthat\nthe strange emotions that people feel\nwith that ten\nthat that tend to conflict with their\ncognitive mind tend to essentially be\nlike\nemotions that are stored from the past\nand so my sense is that if you work on\neven talk through like this guilt around\nyour brother and stuff which is like\nholy [ __ ] bro\nthat that enough is like that's crazy um\nthat hopefully somebody's just do it\nafter a while yeah\nso so this is where like you get used to\nit because you've gotten calloused\nright like you've formed mental calluses\nwhich allow you to function\nbut like a callus isn't really healing\nit's just\nyou know it's just a layer on top of\nsomething\nand then the last point that i'm going\nto give you is just a tiny tiny tiny\nunlikely thing that could happen\nbut i want to just clue you in on this\nin the event that it does because i\nimagine it'll be important i'd say\nthere's a less than five percent chance\nwhich is that be careful about\nwhat kind of echoes could happen if your\nwife does something that you perceive as\nbeing negative towards your daughter\nokay and what i mean by that is that\nlike so we have this\nthis basically what i don't want you to\ndo is\nproject like if you if your mind\nsees your wife do anything similar to\nwhat your mom did to you\nyou could get this weird like volcanic\nrush of emotion\neven though your head is gonna like it's\nclearly apples and oranges\nyour wife would never do anything to\nyour daughter like what your mom did to\nyou\nbut there's a chance that if you see\nsomething\nsomething [ __ ] up is gonna happen\ninside you and you're gonna get this\nvolcanic rush\nof anger and like other kinds of weird\nfeelings\nand just if that happens\nyou know go talk to someone about it\nlike go see a therapist and work through\nthat stuff\nokay because i really don't want that to\nmess up your relationship\ni know it's kind of grim no no no i'm\ni'm on board with you i know what you\nmean i'm already i've already\nyou know working through that stuff for\nexample when i take care of the baby and\nshe starts crying my wife comes running\nin i'm like yo\nwhat she's like don't take the baby out\ni'm like i'm a parent i'm her father i\nknow\nthat it's cold i've got a thing on here\nnot that i'm angry but i was getting\nfrustrated i was like why don't you just\nlet me be a parent i'm also\nhalf parent here i can make good\ndecisions too\nand then i kind of step back and i said\nyou know what babe i'm sorry i know\nyou're only doing this because you want\nwhat's best for the baby and you're not\ntrying to say i'm not a good parent like\nthat\nand we talked about it and i've gotten\nbetter with it i'm very i'm very i'm\nvery\ncognitive when i make a mistake and i'm\nvery i try to make sure that i work\nthrough it and talk about it unlike\na woman not no not any woman but like\nher as\nher way where she'll just spend you know\nthree days upset about something and not\ntalk about it\ni'm very very you know expressive in the\nmoment\nand then i i i realize my mistake and\nthen i go\nyou know i'm so sorry um i i i am\nexpressive and i\nand i then i work it through and i say\nhey listen i [ __ ] up let me make sure\ni don't do it again and so i\ni really appreciate what you're saying\nand i agree that's something i have to\nbe cognizant of moving forward that\ni don't automatically assume that it's\nsomething negative\nyeah so just be aware stocky because\nunfortunately like you said you know\nsome stuff gets laid down in our brain\nin terms of like how we\nautomatically respond to situations\nand and just to be aware that like there\nmay be some weird feelings that arise\nand you may not even recognize them as\nfeelings like\nbecause once again if you're a little\nbit lexa-thymic like you're not going to\nunderstand exactly what you're feeling\num\nbut you know just a couple things to\nkind of think about any last kind of\nthoughts or questions\nno i mean this was this was nice you\nknow it's uh it's obviously you know\njust exposed a lot of things about\nmyself not exposed but just\nopen up about a lot of its deep things\nin front of thousands and thousands and\nthousands of people i never thought this\nwould happen\nuh it's not easy to do that but it was\nnice to talk and i i just hope that\nmaybe someone else out there can\ncan can be helped by this maybe not that\nthere's\nspecifically a solution or resolution to\nthis conversation but maybe\nthey can say hey listen if this streamer\ncan deal with these things so can i and\nthen maybe i need to go get help or\nmaybe i need to talk to somebody or\nyou know stocky i i think a lot of\npeople are going to be helped by this\nconversation\nno i just want them to know they're not\nalone and that and that listen there's a\nlot of people out there that have it\nreally rough and\nand it doesn't mean that you can't you\nknow accomplish good things you don't\nhave to be born with a silver spoon you\ndon't have to look up and say well that\nperson has what i don't i can't ever\nhave that\ni just want people to be happy and i\nwant to be able to help people and and\nif this helps people\num in any way then it was worth all of\nthis\njust exposing myself to the world as\nlong as i can help somebody\num you know i mean i i talked to my chat\nbefore i said you know listen i i dealt\nwith adhd in a very\nvery rough manner for many many years\nand it wasn't until two years ago i\nstarted getting treatment for it\nit's helped my life significantly in a\nlot of ways so\nyou know um obviously it's totally\ndifferent than the conversation we had\nbut\nit's cool i'm just i'm just really\ngrateful you know\nthat uh that i've got this community and\nuh and that they allow me to\nhave this job it's it's it's so [ __ ]\nsurreal that these guys let me\nthis is my job because of them you know\nwhat i mean so i'm glad that i can help\nsomebody if i can\nyeah and i want to thank you too because\ni i think um\nlistening to you has been really\neducational i think you kind of\nyou know like you mentioned you were\nsort of vulnerable and and\ni think that can be hard to do in front\nof thousands of people so i\ni appreciate that the other thing is\nthat um\nyou know i think the world is a better\nplace because you're in it man\nand i i think as a father like i'm\ninspired like listening\nto you talk to you know about what kind\nof dad you want to be for\nyour daughter like it makes me want to\nbe like you get\nget my juices flowing like makes me want\nto you know go there\ni appreciate that i appreciate that yeah\num\nlast thing is that you know i i mean it\nsounds like you may be in\nyou may have some kind of provider or\nsomething but\nyou know i would encourage you if you\nwant to work on this down the road to\nreally go see someone about it\ni don't think you need to work on it i\nthink it's totally fine for you to\nnot want to work on it now\nand but down the road you know you may\nchange your mind at some point and it's\ntotally fine to seek someone out at that\npoint\nyeah i mean i'm not against it it's just\nlike you said that's just not\ni'm i'm i'm not okay or fine or happy\nwith everything but i'm content to the\npoint where\nit's just gotten used to it you know i\nmean it's like my birthmark just kind of\nused to it at this point\nyeah and the calluses are formed yeah\nsure it would be great if i\nif i took off my shirt and somebody\nevery now and then looked and didn't\nstare and say hey what's that\noh it's a birthmark that'd be great i\ndon't give a [ __ ] you know what i mean\nlike\ni've got a beautiful wife i've got a kid\ni you know i've got a great\ni'm not worried about what somebody\nthinks there and so for me it's like\nmakes perfect sense you know what [ __ ]\nit you know what what up [ __ ] it\nit is what it is let me just make sure\nmy daughter doesn't have to have these\nsame\nemotional bags that she has to carry let\nme carry them absolutely absolutely yeah\nso normally i teach meditation on stream\ni can't do that yeah i i was gonna say i\ni wouldn't recommend it today\num as well but so i think we're we're\nwe're maybe on the same page there i'm\njust being honest with you i i can't\neven read a book more than a page\nwithout earmarking it i'll never make it\nthrough meditation\nuh yeah i i mean we do a lot of\nsuccessful meditation with people with\nadhd but but\ni think more of the reason that i would\nsuggest against it is just because\nyou have to be really careful with\nmeditation and and\nhistories of trauma so what meditation\ntends to do is remove the calluses\nso what can happen is peop like people\ncan get like\nan upwelling of emotions and things like\nthat which i i don't i don't think\nyou're\num i don't think you need that right now\nso i think if you want to do yoga or tai\nchi or something that would be like\nreally great but like\ni wouldn't recommend meditation for you\nto be honest\nwhat about a hot tub stream that's fine\nokay hot tub is cool yeah do you have a\nhot tub\nno no i was just wondering because these\nguys have been giving me [ __ ] about it\nfor days i thought hey listen i could\nrelax get some warm water and\nand uh and and bait some dono's maybe i\ndon't know\nyeah well listen sake thank you so much\nfor\ncoming and i know you didn't really know\nwhat you signed up for i i really\nappreciate you being such a good sport\nabout it\nyou know if you regret coming on or\nsomething like that at some point down\nthe road which is a completely\nreasonable thing for you to feel\nyou know please let us know if there's\nany kind of fallout or aftermath from\nour conversation today\num and and it you know it's causing you\nany kind of problems please let us know\nand we'd love to try to support you\nthrough that or kind of fix\nit you know um yeah so\ni i think that my community um i've i've\ndone a very\nthorough job in my opinion of keeping a\nnon-toxic very supportive community lots\nof memes lots of [ __ ] posting but not\nactual hate people\nwe don't allow that it's cool if\nsomebody thinks of me differently\nwhich i don't see why because i've\nalways been very open and very\ntransparent about everything my trades\nthe way i do things the way i think my\nlife\ni don't mind doing this because when\nyou're open and when you don't have much\nto hide and you're doing that\nyou don't really worry about that\nbacklash so i think if anything my\ncommunity got to see a side of me a\nlittle bit more in depth\nmight let them know who i am a little\nbit more and if anybody\nout there saw this and was like yeah\nafter seeing all this i don't want to be\npart of that guy they're probably a\n[ __ ] [ __ ] person i don't want him\nhere anyway so i think it's a win-win\nfor everybody i think everything that i\nsaw about you was like\nawesome bro seriously except this fire\njesus christ do you have anything for\nreceding hairlines look at that [ __ ]\nl are you is it really receding\nyeah not a lot but i mean at 35 i have a\ndecent hairline but it's it's\nit looks like the male it looks like a\nwidow's peak\nthe whole thing's moving backwards\nthat's because all this hair is gone so\nit just looks that way okay\njesus christ my man over here it's\nlow-key roasting me\nokay i okay yeah i mean\nyou know there are there are things\nthere are medications and stuff for hair\nloss\nthere are some ayurvedic treatments as\nwell but those aren't really well\nsupported through the evidence\num well i mean you could get coconut oil\ncoconut oil massage or almond oil\nmassage goes a long way yeah she does\nalmond oil massages and stuff like that\nbut\nwith the baby and everything and we\nhaven't had time um and i get concerned\nbecause the last time she gave me a\nmassage we got pregnant so i just try to\nbe very careful with you know the timing\nof things but\nno i'll definitely um i'll definitely um\nlook to see if there's something i can\nadd\nyou should ask her she'll know what to\ndo\nall right doc it was nice uh nice\nchatting with you uh\ngot one question for you um what's the\nyolo\nwhat's the yolo what does that mean i\nknow yolo means you only live once but\ndoc i got i got 20 grand what am i going\nto put it on today\ni i don't know the idk oh god that one\nalready got played\ni'm just kidding you're not giving me a\nyellow listen thanks so much and i hope\nthat uh i hope that you have a great one\num and uh you know i i i i\nmaybe down the road so i had a\nit's gonna sound so random but um\nback when i was studying to become a\nmonk i got exposed to a lot of really\nweird pseudo-spiritual\npseudo-scientific kind of [ __ ] um so\nfor example like i'm a certified crystal\nhealer but\ni don't do that because i don't really\nthink it works\num so i was just learning a lot of\ndifferent stuff and one of the things\nthat i came across was someone who\nuh i got trained in dowsing do you know\nwhat dowsing is\nyeah i found out that sounding rods and\ndoubting dowsing rods are not the same\nthing by accident but yeah at dowsing\nrods\ni'm familiar yeah so so the person who\nwho got a wild man\nso like no i'm serious these guys asked\nme about sounding rods i thought it was\ndowsing rods so i googled it and i just\nwasn't ready for that i learned\nsomething new that\nyeah so so someone once made the claim\nto me and i thought that this claim is\nabsolutely ludicrous but if you\nno one's ever asked me to pick a stock\nbefore but what i would do if you really\nwanted me to pick a stock was\nwas get my dowsing pendant because i\nhave a dowsing pendant which is sat in a\ncloset for the last 18 years because i\nthink it's [ __ ]\num but it is pull that out and then if i\ncould get like a page of stocks i would\nuse the dowsing pendant and like pick\none\nokay these guys are all waiting right\nnow they're literally like 5 000\nwaiting for you to do that oh but how do\ni find the dowsing pendant is a physical\nobject so it's like a pendant so what i\nneed to do is twirl it and and have it\nsit over a stock\nso how literally you just get a bor you\nget the alphabet and you do it and the\nfirst three it lands on\nare the three the alphabet a b\nc d e f g h i j k\noh oh so i should just get a an alphabet\nyou just get a square\nthing with the alphabet and you do your\nrod you're sounding nothing\nare we gonna do housing through the\ncircle are we doing this\ngo for it and then the first three i'll\nmake you a deal this is\nfor entertainment purposes only you do\nthat the first three letters it lands on\ni'll buy a thousand dollars of that\nstock okay right here live\nokay we're gonna do so then i'm gonna\nmake i'm gonna make a i'm gonna\ndo that i'm gonna go pee while you're\ndoing that we're gonna come back right\nnow all right let me go\nfind i have to go right i'll be right\nback i'll be right back okay\nas well\nthis is for entertainment purposes only\nentertainment purposes only\nbe right back while you're doing that\nget three alphabetic letters i will buy\na thousand dollars of that stock\nright here on live on stream three okay\na to z do your thing and then the three\nletters that it does i'll buy that stock\nokay\nso or even get a scramble get a scrabble\nboard\ni'll be right back i'll be right back\nokay\nso you know it's funny chat because we\ndon't talk about this a lot on healthy\ngamer\nbut you know i've explored a lot of\nbs in my day in my search for like\nwhat works and like what actually helps\npeople\num is this one\nmaybe i need to get my kids to help me\nwith this i was showing my kids\nall this stuff because it's been sitting\nso i i you know i don't advertise some\nof this stuff but like i've i've like\ni'm a reiki healer and like other kinds\nof stuff and and\nreally guys i want you all to understand\nthis there's like there's a lot of bs\nout there right\nso i'm also a skeptic so what happened\nis like i was like okay i'm gonna have\nan open mind\nand we're gonna try to learn oh [ __ ] not\nto find my dowsing pendant\nall right let's do this full disclosure\nthis is for entertainment purposes only\ndo not\nbuy this stock you're not shadow trade\nthis is not fine with the device it's a\ncomplete [ __ ] right now okay\nyeah but i got a feeling of which i need\nto find out how much money i've either\nmade or lost today because i had like\na lot of money in disney before we got\non and i'm green so i might have done\nwell let me see\nit may take me a minute to find this\nthis thing\nbut these guys don't care this is very\noh it hit 190. i'm good i made money i\nmade 150 bucks\num so just so you're aware um\nyeah yo turn up swagger with the five\ngifted\nall right disney took a while but i\nfinally made money i still got\n40 minutes which means it'll probably\njump on me npa dropping\nolb is getting i'm getting down five\npercent on that\ni forgot i forgot to stop the stop loss\nthis is not all right let me tell a\nlittle bit of stock here\nlet me sell you know what i'm going to\nbuy instead of meditation\nbut i've had 10 shares 10 shares of\ndisney\ni've been wanting to do this for decades\nbut i never\ni never had the scientific integrity to\njust actually run this experiment\ni was like it's not scientific integrity\nliterally gambling at this point\nyeah but my wife heard me and said that\ni'm selling it five minutes after i buy\nit\nwhatever it is hold on wait she said\nthat to me but you know what i did i\nlooked her right in the eyes when she\nsaid that and i said\ni said\ndid you dig yourself a hole i said yes\ndear whatever you say\ni'm not doing it she's watching i'm not\ndoing it guys\ni said\nmaybe one of my kids oh no no\nsome bad energy with drawing crystal\nthat's different it's a whole different\ncrystal so many crystals\nso this one found it here it\nright so that's your is your dowsing\nthing

not like i don't do reiki\nright because\ni mean there's evidence that reiki\num you know helps people feel better but\nuh doesn't actually lead to better\noutcomes\nso what we do on stream\nis actually just like it's like the\nstuff that works\nbut what people don't know is there's a\nlot of [ __ ] out there that doesn't work\na b c d e f g h g k\nl m m\no p q r\ns t u v\nw x y and c damn

of you i have just\nspent\nwhat's our outcome though like how what\ndo we do with this like\nwhat's how do we know what the end of\nthe experiment is\ndiamond hands what does that mean\nel no sabe

a lawyer\nin case this goes badly the dowsing\ncrystal did not tell me\nso so when i think about this i think\nabout this as a scientist so what i say\nis that we should design an experiment\nand i've never done this experiment\nbecause there's no plausibility that it\nwould ever\nactually work so it's the experiment\ni've never done but i've thought through\nit many times and what i'd think is that\nwhat you have to do is like\npick a random assortment of stocks and\nthen dowse to pick\nanother assortment of stocks and then\ncompare your growth from these two\nand then you run that test so many times\nand then you\nassess for statistical significance i\ngot an idea how about this\nyeah i'll hold each one for a week okay\nwednesday to wednesday it sounds next\nwednesday you tell me the stock that i'm\nselling this\nprofit or loss based on this dowsing\nthing and i'll buy that and we'll just\nkeep rolling that\nand see what happens okay so i'm picking\none stock via dowsing\nevery week i mean i mean you're a busy\nman but if i just get bored what what's\nour what's our control group though\nlike what right so we have to have a\ncontrol if we're doing an experiment\ncontrol we're talking about a crystal on\na piece of\nfreaking wire piece of thread and you\nwant a control group\nthat is a good [ __ ] point but yes\nif we are going to do this we might as\nwell we have to have something to\ncompare okay\nhow about this this is why so we run\nyou're dowsing versus this right here\nokay here you go\ni got some random letters here okay i\ndon't even have all my letters here but\ni'm just going to randomly pick three\nletters and i'm going to put\nthe same amount of money in both of them\nokay i don't even have all my letters\nhere so this isn't even going to go\nwrong\ni'm talking i'm just going to pick the\nfirst one okay here you go you've got\ng okay um i only have like a third of\nthe alphabet here but we're just going\nto do it anyways what's

stock going up right now you\nguys are idiots\nall right um all right so i'm gonna buy\n42\n42.12 shares\nso so if we wanted to publish this study\nit would uh they won't let me\nthey won't let me do it [ __ ] it i got to\ndo 42 even okay\nit's fine we'll give the control group a\nslight edge okay all right so here you\ngo so\ni have two positions now you're dowsing\ncrystals and me just
