    "transcript": "hey dr k um in the past you mentioned\nwhat contributes\nto making friends meeting potential\npartner unplanned regular action\ninteraction plus shared goal\nwhat are your thoughts on and tips\nregarding meeting people over the\ninterla\ninternet and online dating now that is\nour only option\na side question how do you jump a bridge\nbetween introductory small talk and\nfree-flowing conversation\ni've matched with girls on tinder not\nexclusive to online interaction before\nvirus met people with something\nin common at parties but never started a\nconversation\nbeing terrified of not knowing what i\nshould say to spark interest\nand have the other side engage back is\nthere something internally\nholding back that i should think about\nand digest or is there a technique that\ncan help me get through\nokay so chat i've been thinking about\nthis for a long time i think\ni think we gotta we gotta come up with\nlike a you know\nhow to date and meet people by dr k\nbecause i i'm okay we're gonna talk\nabout this okay okay\nokay how do you jump a bridge between\nintroductory small talk and free-flowing\nconversation\nbeing terrified of not knowing what i\nshould say to spark interest and have\nthe other side engage back so this is\nthe key thing okay\nall right so let's think about this okay\nchat all right stay with me now\nokay so here's the thing when y'all talk\nto someone\nit's not your job to spark interest\nit's not your job to make the other\nperson engage back\ni want you guys to think about\ninteractions with\nwe're gonna assume a heteronormative and\nmale standpoint\nyour job is not to make them like you or\nget them interested\nyour job you're like you're like a\nstreet vendor who has a table of stuff\nthat is laid out right so your job is to\nlay out the stuff on the table\nand if they're interested they'll\nyou know they'll play the game but you\nit's not about saying the right thing or\nthe wrong thing\nit's about saying what you have to say\nand so like put yourself out there right\nso i'm not i don't mean\ndick pic that's a terrible idea under\nall circumstances but i mean like\nyou know especially if you're a male\nlike you know do a little bit of the\nmale dance\nand and so there's small talk but then\nlike i think there are a couple of\nquestions that you can\nyou can ask um you know like what was\n2020 like for you\nyou know so that's like that's like a\ngreat kind of open-ended question\nbut generally speaking you want to you\nwant to show people like who you\nare and if they're interested in that\nthey'll engage with you and if they're\nnot interested in that they won't\nbut what you don't want to do is like\ntry to get them to spark interest\nand try to get them to engage with you\nby like being something that's\ninauthentic\nbecause then it's like you're just\nsetting yourself up for failure down the\nroad\nso just be who you are and be authentic\nas it turns out in my experience most\nwomen find that\nattractive right when you're just like\nauthentic and fun\nand like when you're cognitively focused\non like enjoying yourself and being who\nyou are\nas opposed to like trying to be\nsomething that you're not which is like\nso\ncognitively intense that you're like\nliving a lie and there's all this like\nsubconscious processing going on\nlike you just can't you're not relaxed\nyou're overthinking it\nyou're less fun so just be who you are\nand\nand let other people engage i mean even\nif you're a woman it goes both ways\nright so you shouldn't\ntry to be a particular thing for a man\nor if you're gay you shouldn't try to be\na particular thing for\nyour partner or someone that you're\nattracted to just be who you are\nand display that and for the people that\nare interested they'll respond\num so does does that make sense like\nlike i want you guys to not\ntry to get something to get them to like\nyou it's sort of like\nbe who you are and if they're interested\ngreat\nbecause you're probably pretty\ninteresting\nand and if they're interested cool so\nlike then you guys can build on that and\nit's like it's it's a relationship\nthat's founded on authenticity\nnow how do you break in between small\ntalk and free flow and conversation this\nis where like you got it like there's\nsome notes to take here okay\nso open-ended question followed by like\ninvestigative response and then a little\nbit of sharing\ntwo to one question to answer ratio okay\nso like this is where oh what was 2020\nlike for you oh interesting okay\noh wow that sounds crazy oh you got a\ncat cool tell me about your cat\nawesome and then you're like yeah i\nyou know you can toss in like i'm i'm\ndeathly allergic to cats but\nnow it's like tough because i clearly\nwant to meet your cat\nand i'm totally into you but i'm\nallergic to cats so it's like do i\nchoose\nyou know allergies or continuing to\nyou know shoot my shot with you i don't\nknow\nand then like this is also where like\ni'd make your intentions known like\npretty early\nokay you gotta let her know like you\ngotta flirt\nbros you know you'd be like oh man\nthat's a real pity but you know maybe i\ncan learn to live with allergies for you\nlike\nif it's if it involves you like\nabsolutely i can learn to adjust\nand then you see how they respond to\nthat like if they're like oh my god this\nguy's a creeper and\nand then you're like okay you back off a\nlittle bit maybe you overplayed your\nhand\nor she giggles in which case it's like\nyeah\nlet's go baby and so so you know\nintroductory small talk and then like\nactually get to know the person because\nwhat you're thinking about is like\nyou're thinking about dating this person\nright so like you want to get to know\nlike is this a person interesting\nwhat are they into what are you into um\nyou know how does that and and then like\ntry to engage with them around\ntopics that like seem interesting to\nboth of you guys\nso ask a couple of open-ended questions\num\nyou know i think there are a lot of\nquestions that people tend to ask that\nlike\npeople feel put on the spot so\nsteer clear of yes or no questions steer\nclear of like questions about like\nyou know if you want to do like what do\nyou do for a living i don't think that's\nan interesting question\num you know what was 2020 like for you\nis a good one\num you know what's something that you're\nexcited about\nfor 2021 is a good one right so you get\nto like learn a little bit about their\ninterests\nyou can be like authentically curious\nabout what they have to say you can\nshare a little bit\num i think they're like a lot of\nquestions like that that you can ask\nthat that will sort of open up the\ndiscussion\nwhat do you think about love i think\nthat sounds like it's coming on a bit\ntoo strong\nuh is dr k a pickup artist certainly not\nthe last person i picked up was 17 years\nago\nso i'm dated to say the least\nyeah as smiling is important\nright and then like the other thing is\nremember you all can be authentic so\nthis is like\nthis is the this is this is what i think\nis sort of the trump card which can\nreally like\nit you can make or break you but if\nyou're having trouble talking to a girl\nbecause you don't know like\nwhat to say to her just walk up to her\nand be like for the last 10 minutes i've\nbeen\ntrying to think about how to strike up a\nconversation with you because i think\nyou're\nabsolutely gorgeous and i haven't been\nable to come up with anything\ncan you help me out just\ntell her like lay it out there like be\nauthentic\nand like i've been racking my brain\nbecause i'd love to get to know you\nbetter but i just can't think of\nanything\nright and and just be authentic\ndudes\nright be authentic and then we'll see\nhow she responds and she's like oh yeah\nyou know\nthat's a sweet thought but i'm i'm\nreally not interested and you can say\nokay thanks thanks for letting me know i\nreally appreciate it\nenjoy the rest of your night and then\nyou don't go barking up the wrong tree\nlike you it's also like\nvery important to respect boundaries\nright like you don't want to push them\nand then you can even like so this is\nwhere you can do a little bit of like\nasking for\nfor permission and you can say okay i\nget what you're saying sounds like\nyou're not interested\num if i think of something good\nlater on in the night like let's say the\ntwo-year-old at a bar or whatever like\nif i think of something really really\ngood\ncan i take another you know can i take\nanother swing\nand then she'll either say yes or no and\nlike that's like you're you're asking\nfor permission you're making your\nintentions no\nknown you're respecting her boundaries\nbut you're also letting her know like\nyou're not gonna quite give up right\naway and then if she says like yeah you\ncan take another shot at it\nyou're like fantastic um\nand then i don't know\nbased or cringed i don't know what based\nmeans\nright does that make sense guys like you\nwant to you want to be you want to be\nlike respectful\nbut you want to be like authentic like\nrespectful authentic\nyou know respect the boundary you know\nmake her laugh\nbe funny you know have confidence\nit's like authentic that's that's that's\nthe way\nand then if she's like no you know i'm\ni'm seeing someone you're like\nawesome good for you and good for that\ndude presuming it's a dude\nand then you move on with your life\nbut i can i can [ __ ] guarantee you\nthat over the next 24 hours\nshe will think about you at least once\nat least once right\nand and like it's cool like even if she\nrejects you which it's not really a\nrejection it's just she's seeing someone\nat the end of the day like you're still\ngonna make her feel good about herself\nright so like you've made the world like\neven if it's like rejection on your part\nyou've made the world like a slightly\nbetter place because you've you've\nhelped like you've helped a\nwoman or man or whatever feel attractive\nand feel wanted by another human being\nwhich is an awesome gift to give\nright even if there's no relationship in\nit like it like you you guys are way too\ncaught up in how it's like affecting you\nlike oh my god she said no i'm so\nembarrassed\nbut like yeah she use she said no but as\nlong as you're not cringe about it\nwhich we'll talk about you know cringe\nis all about boundaries and respecting\nboundaries\nbut as long as you're not cringe then\nyou know like even if she turns you down\nit's like she's gonna\nwake up the next morning and feel like\nshe's an attractive woman\nwhich is like an awesome thing right so\nwe live in a society where\nwe're taught that we're unattractive\nbecause of you know magazines and\nintegra\ninstagram filters and all that kind of\ncrap so if you can help someone feel a\nlittle bit attractive about themselves\nlike cool\nall right"
