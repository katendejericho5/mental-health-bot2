    "transcript": "uh the ultimate way to come up for air\nis a dick joke\nthat's yeah to tie a dick joke into my\ndad's death would be phenomenal\nyeah i'll come up with one rigor mortis\nwho knows\nright there look at that look at how\neasy it is\nhey man hey how's it going does my\ncamera work for you and all that\nit does work for me so many things about\nwhat i see work for me\nthat's i'd love to hear that let's enter\nit it's not centered\nokay nope\nall right we're money all right there we\ngo it's nice\nso you go by ludwig it's uh yeah it's\nsupposed to be ludwig but i go by ludwig\nyeah and what would you prefer that i\ncall you today\ni go with ludwig yeah ludwig okay that\nwas great\nso ludwig um thanks for coming on i\nreally appreciate it especially oh is\nthat a deathly hallows water bottle\nit is it is i can't take credit it is my\ngirlfriend's butt\na quick pick up yeah you get to cr you\nget to take credit for having a\ngirlfriend who has a\ndeathly hallows water bottle though that\nwas the plan all along all right i\nwouldn't have dated her if she didn't\nhave the water bottle\nyeah that's that's dope man um so\nyou know thanks for coming on i i really\nappreciate it um\nespecially today because we are you know\ndoing a fundraiser for chalk\num and and i understand that you're a\npretty big deal in the twitch community\nso thank you very much for\noffering your time well absolutely you\nknow a big deal seems\nflattering but you know this seems like\na cool charity i like\nget gamers for chalk yeah i heard you\ntalking about it it sounds really nice\nyeah so hopefully we can help them out a\nlittle bit um\nis there something in particular that\nyou were hoping to talk about today or\nor anything that um any questions or\nanything that i can potentially help you\nwith\nyou know i i have a couple of topics\nthat uh that came to mind\num i don't feel like i\nhave like you know compared to most\nmaybe uh as\ndeserving of a spot on the show\num like like my girlfriend actually i\nthink she came on cutie\ni don't i don't know if you remember it\nwas a bit ago uh\nyou know she she got she got the bag she\ngot anxiety depression the whole works\nand uh and i feel pretty good you know\nlike um\nor fortunate i should say that you know\ni don't have\npersonal problems that i think i mean\nthat i know of that i feel they need to\ntalk to but\nuh maybe broader subjects like um\nthey talk about uh parasocial\nrelationships a lot on stream\nsure and uh and i'm sure you have some\nsome sage dumb about it\nand then um the only other thing is\ndeath\ni figured you probably know what happens\nafter we die and i wanted to ask at some\npoint\nsure so i let's man\nwell said so like i i i really first of\nall appreciate how you kind of laid out\nhow you're thinking about coming on\nstream\nand the first thing that i want to say\nis that i think you are just as\ndeserving as anyone else\nand and i think that um part of the\nproblem i think that we sometimes get\ninto on stream is that\nwe tend to over emphasize people's\nstruggles and really we're not\nand that gets like i think a little bit\ntoo close to psychiatry so like part of\nactually what i really like about\num you know understanding the mind and\nunderstanding like life\nand understanding yourself is that it's\nnot necessarily pathology focused\nso i think that's where we just you know\na lot of people need help and we're here\nto help people but i think like\nunderstanding having conversations\naround death or having conversations\neven about\nwhat you deserve and what you don't\ndeserve and do people who struggle with\nanxiety quote unquote deserve\nmore than you do i think those are\nactually really important conversations\ntoo\num and i love talking about death cool\nso yeah i don't i you love that\nsure all right yeah that's high i love\ntalking about most things\nsure i guess that makes sense for you um\nand yeah so what what do you wanna\ndo you wanna talk a little bit more\nabout you know sort of deserving this\nspot or are we kind of done with that\nand we can\ndive right in i feel fine about it just\nwanted to just\nlighten it up so i i think um because\nthe other way to think about it ludwig\nis like if we are going to talk about\nparasocial relationships and death\nreally the goal of stream is to you know\nhelp one person\nhopefully understand something but\nreally the goal is to like\ntalk about things that would benefit our\naudience and\nyou know i think these two things like\nif we have a conversation about these\ntwo things i\ni have to imagine that a lot of people\nwill appreciate it and will benefit from\nit\nso i think it's totally cool yeah makes\nsense i'm on board\nso we starting with parasocial\nrelationships or death\ni think you're supposed to end with\ndeath so parasocial it is\nokay so tell me what is uh and i may not\nhave sage advice because i think you\nguys probably know more about this than\ni do\nso can you tell me what a parasocial\nrelationship is\nokay yeah so well yeah basically it is\nuh you know\na one-way relationship um with\nwith someone and uh and i think that's\nthe gist of it but\nthe way i understand it is basically\npeople who form relationships with me\ntheir streamer um even though i can't\ngive anything back personally\nuh and then you know they might gain too\nmuch of an attachment\nyou know a lot of people say things like\ni love you and\nand uh and\nbasically treat me as a friend and i\ncan't reciprocate\nokay and and what do you think about\nthat\nyou know i've always been pretty chill\nwith it because i kind of grew up on\nyoutube\nand uh and i feel like i grew up pretty\nfine\num but my my roommate slime always\nseemed very concerned about it\nand uh and then i think as i grew a bit\ni was like\nhuh you know this can be a bit\nproblematic\nbecause i think my viewership started\ngetting a bit younger\nand uh and i guess more impressionable\num and i just think that especially\nnow that covet people are on twitch so\nmuch that you know they\nsometimes forego irl relationships for\nonline ones with people that\ncan reciprocate what's wrong with that\ni don't think there's anything\ninherently wrong with online\nrelationships i\nthink that\ni see myself being like i read my\ndms and the dms people send me\nit feels like it's\ni mean i don't know if i want to say\ncrossing a line but i'm not the guy for\nthe job\na lot of the time um and they're using\nme as the guy for the job and i can't\nfulfill the role\nwhat what's the job help me understand\nlike\nhey this is going on do you have any\nadvice\nyou know um\ni don't know what to do for my\nmajor any basically piece of advice or\njust try to talk to someone who will\nlisten\neven um like you would with a friend\nthey though they might with me\nuh and i can't\nanswer of them all because there's a lot\nsure and\nand i have in the past a bit but you\nknow then it gets\nweird too because i don't you know i'm\nnot particularly in\nlike involved in the person's life so i\ndon't know the whole thing so\nsure so basically that yeah if that\nmakes sense how do you think that these\nrelation\nwhy do they dm you for advice about what\nthey should major in\nhow do you understand that i don't know\ni don't particularly know why i'm the\nfirst maybe\ni've thought about this because people\ndo it for advice they'll also do it for\nlike\nmaybe just like money straight up or\nthey do it\njust for like like they'll ask you for\nmoney yeah or\njust simple pleasantries or like\nterms of endearment um and i\ni think it's maybe a mixture of a shot\nin the dark\nand maybe it's just easier to say to me\nfirst\nif that makes sense yeah let me\nunderstand that say it to you first\nlike if you were gonna be like you know\nif i was broke imagine i'm broke as hell\nand you're my good friend\nand i like i've come to you before and i\ndon't want to be like yo dr k can you\njust slap me a thousand\nlike it's easier to just ask a random\nman on the internet\nwho probably will ignore it but there's\na chance i'll answer and at least like\npractice how i'm gonna say this before i\ngo to you\nyeah sure so why do you think it's\neasier to approach the random man\non the internet because you don't think\nthey'll respond\nyeah that's kind of interesting but i\nalso think devastating because what\nyou're suggesting and i think this is\ntrue is that\nsometimes it's easiest to take the\nchances that we know have the highest\nlikelihood of failure\nyeah yeah i think people do that a lot\nthey do do that\nwho like send me emails with a resume\nbeing like can i be an editor\ni feel like it's the absolute minimum\nyou could do\num but still doing something\nyeah and and\nyou also mentioned at the early on\nsomething about i love you\nyou know and what do you think what do\nyou think people what do you think your\nviewers\nwhat do how do they view their\nrelationship with you\nwell that's what i'm concerned about you\nknow i would hope\nit is like you know um\nlike youtube was for me as a kid or like\nany show is\ni guess like a little form of\nentertainment you can hop online too\nand maybe pull some character traits for\nme that you like and\nget some laughs but that's kind of the\nuh\nthe extent of it is that what youtube\nwas for you\nentertainment it was entertainment in\nsome like life lessons yeah i would say\nit was both those things but i wouldn't\nsay it was like you know\na source of friendship or uh camaraderie\nor anything\nso i'm hearing you kind of if i were to\ninfer i'd say that you didn't really\nform parasocial relationships with the\nyoutubers that you watched\ni like to think i didn't i could be\nwrong but i i imagine i didn't\ndid you ever tell a youtuber that you\nlove them\ni don't think so it's also just weirder\nin a youtube comment\nsure um did you ever tell\na youtuber did you ask them to for a job\nno i did send a youtuber my youtube\nvideos\nasking for advice\noh sorry what no we oh my god you got a\nthousand dollar donation\nyeah um by anonymous and 500\nfrom chewbacca sorry we're get we'll get\nto donations in a second i don't want to\ncut me off for a rack that's fair\nthank you guys very much for supporting\nchalk\nyes good job 11k here we come\num anyway you were saying that you you\nnever asked them for a job but you maybe\ndid ask for advice\ni i might have asked for a job you know\nwhen you're\n16. i definitely have asked for jobs in\na lazy fashion\num before 100 but i do vividly remember\nasking for advice on a youtube video i\nmade when i was 16\nfrom like a larger youtuber and uh he\nactually replied\num which was hype he said\nkind of funny jokes but [ __ ] quality\nsetup\nthat's what he said yeah and replied\nwhat was your question i don't\nunderstand no it was like do you have\nany advice\non like my youtube videos because i sent\nhim a video i had made\noh i said i thought to this video and\nhow that's pretty good\nhow did that make you feel when you\nresponded\nit i think didn't matter because i had\nalready quit at that point but i thought\nit was cool that he replied for sure\nwhat was cool about that that he took\nthe time for a young 16 year old boy\nyeah so we're going to point something\nout ludwig what did you just do\nuh thanks the anonymous donator in\nconjunction with you and brought up a\nstory about\nuh addiction yeah so so\nso like you just changed your voice a\nlittle bit uh-huh\nright yeah and yeah you kind of made a\njoke out of it you're like yeah\noh like was nice for a 16 year old boy\nyou're roasting me live on twitch.tv you\nknow well\ni can stop if it if it makes me oh\nyou're so good you're so good i did do\nthat yeah\nwhat well how do you understand why you\ndid that\nuh how i made the voice you make it more\nspicy no no no i mean but why did you\nmake the voice in that moment\na little flare yeah but why flare at\nthat point i completely agree it's flare\nyou're cracking a joke you're making it\na little bit funny\nwell then because i guess it was a bit\ni was a bit goofy that i uh everybody\njust put me laughing you got me\nit was a bit goofy that the whole entire\nsituation but it's something i look\nmaybe fondly back on\nyep um but you know\nyeah yes so it's kind of interesting\nbecause i i think actually like what\nyou're doing is lightening i think the\nsignificance of it\nokay yeah why'd i do that so so i i\nthink it\nwe can get to that in a second i just\nlet's notice it first right so we start\nwith observations\nand then like we can develop hypotheses\ndown the road the more data we collect\nthe more accurate right but like\ni think that sometimes people feel\nuncomfortable if i had to venture\nsometimes like people feel uncomfortable\nlike talking about\nthings that are impactful to them and so\nwhat we do is we like make light of it\ngosh okay right yeah well yeah i just\ndon't like bringing too much gravity to\ngravity to\nto things that's around me usually i\nlike to keep it light fluffy\nyeah perhaps that's it yeah so so then\nif we\nif you really want to go off the rails\nwhat what makes it hard for you to sit\nwith gravity like\nyou know important things well you know\ngravity comes with a bit of weight and i\ndon't like throwing weight around i like\nthrowing light and fluffy it's a little\nmore\nfun a little easier yep absolutely\nit's fun it's easier serious\ni'm i'm with you so now i'm going to\ngive you a choice ludwig we can dig into\nthat we can go off on that tangent but\nthat tangent is going to be a little bit\nmore personal\nbut i also want to fully respect you\nknow what you want to do and what you\ndon't want to do we're going to ignore\ntwitch chat don't care about what they\nthink it's not about that\ngotta go down the road dr k that's why\nyou\nwe have to nope i want to\ndo you feel beholden to\nin yeah okay what does that word\nmean so it do you feel obligated to hmm\num or do you really think it's i think\nit's a more hype road to go down\nand that's what i'd prefer okay\nwhy do you choose the hype road well\nbecause\nwhen it's hype it's more fun it would be\nregrettable to not pick a hype decision\nyeah so so once again you gravitate\ntowards fun\nand lightheartedness see it's happening\nright now you're doing it again\nno it's just like it's something that's\nhype like like i could i could\ngo down the road that i had\npredetermined and then\ni could think a week later like damn\nmaybe dr k had some [ __ ] to say like he\nprobably had some bars to drop\nand i didn't like go for the bars\nis it okay to not go for the bars\nsometimes yes but if you can and it's\nnot that problematic why not\nokay cool so if you want to go down the\nroad enough of them\noh [ __ ] lost my pen\nyeah you do it new doctor k way to make\na lighthearted joke in the moment\nno i mean i i seriously my fingers are\nslippery\nwhich is a you know a whole different\ndiscussion but\num i'm supposed to ask you about\ncoombers at some point too\nokay sure um speaking of making things\nlighthearted\nbut so so tell me what i mean do you you\nknow were you always kind of the joker\nyeah for sure class clown can you tell\nme a little bit about that\num yeah you know i i remember\nstarted third grade we had uh i think it\nwas called brambling\nwhere you write for like 15 minutes\nuninterrupted you're not allowed to not\nwrite\nyou can write whatever and then at the\nend of it you could volunteer to share\nand i shared my parody of the book um\nmy brother sam is dead remember that one\nit was about uh civil war\nand i called it my brother slam is dead\nand i had this hilarious joke where slam\nhis mother told him to take a shower and\nwash the dishes like a mother would\nand he and then he says like as a\nnarrator he's like and then i wash the\ndishes and took a shower\nat the same time and everybody thought\nit was the funniest thing ever\nand ever since then i've just been on a\nhigh road i just ride that high\nwhat is that high they all laughed\nthey thought it was funny it was a\nclassic good one\nand how did that make you feel\n10 out of 10. it was a banger\ncertified good one live in front of all\nthe people in my class\nand my crush and the cool teacher\nsounds amazing did i do the voice again\nyeah\nit was amazing it was good yeah um\nand it sounds like you've been chasing\nthat high ever since\nis that why you is that kind of how you\ncan you tell us how you got into\nstreaming\nuh yeah i did comedy in college\nand then i thought i should do something\nwith this after graduating and i did a\npodcast with a friend\nand he streamed it on twitch and um that\nwas slime as well and i was like oh you\nknow i could just maybe stream\nwhile i try to find some comedy group in\nla or whatever\nand then i just did streaming and then\nthat worked out\ncool well congratulations thank you can\nyou\ncan you tell me a little bit about um\nwhat growing up was like\nuh grew up in new hampshire\nit was chill i had like a like a nice\nhouse indoor pool\nthat's cool that's like a weird thing\nthat people don't have a lot\num dad died high school was great\n3.0 i would say\nyeah pretty good high school all in all\ndid you say your dad died yeah my dad\ndied my dad died\nwhen i was 10. yeah but also 3.0\ni was in choir honors wire\nwow that's impressive\ncan i just think for a second go for it\ngo for it\nvarsity soccer how old were you when you\nwere into the 10th grade\nuh no he died when i was 10 not in the\n10th grade unless you're just wondering\nsorry how old were you it when the the\njoke story is from the third grade it\nwas uh\non hindsight i misremembered it's fifth\ngrade i believe actually\nhow old was your fifth grade\neight no wait\nten wait\ni was 10 dr k see you did it again\noh [ __ ] yeah i was 10 years old\na detective voice do you remember\nwhat else happened that year wait\nmy dad died that year wait okay i'm\ni'm using a voice but i do think i\nhaven't wrecked\nyeah i guess that does add up\nsure you're onto something here i think\ni mean maybe mm-hmm so it's okay\nlet's just sit for a second how are you\nfeeling right now ludwig\ni feel good i'm trying to remember dates\nuh because he died in march i can't\nremember if it was before or after\nthe story but i don't i don't remember i\ncan't remember\ncan you tell me a little bit about what\ngrowing up was like before your dad\npassed away\nuh chill i don't remember a lot which uh\nis regrettable\nbut you know i was i was like 10 and now\ni'm 25.\nwhy do you regret it well you know i'd\nlike to remember\nmy father uh but i can't remember that\nmuch from when i was 10\nbecause i had smaller brain less formed\nuh but it was good i remember we went on\na lot of vacations\nto europe where the family lives so we'd\nsee family a lot\num school was pretty bomb\nuh played a bunch of video games\nwouldn't you play\ni was the renowned worst gamer in my\nfriend group but i played a lot of\nsmash and uh\npokemon snap and kingdom hearts\nwow cool um never really got into any of\nthose\nreally yeah well i've seen your show\nin no offense dr k you're a bit of a\nboomer i mean you're whipping out like\ni feel like the references you whip out\nin the games you're playing are\ndated yeah they're a little bit older\neven absolutely man you'll always be\nlike you guys ever play star quest\n17 and it'd be like for like\nwindows 84 yeah so so you know it's\nstrange thing because i\nfeel the boomer inside me yeah i feel\nlike coming too\nlike it's it's it's interesting because\nlike when i see games now it\nnowadays i think to myself like this\nthought pops into my head\nman games are so much better like\neveryone talks about ff10 like you guys\nneed to go back and play ff4 and f6\nyeah you know let me tell you i was just\nwatching right before this\nuh one of the streamers i really like\nplay ff10 i'm like damn this game's\ngoaded the kids won't know these days\nthey're all playing persona now\nyeah i need to give persona a shot i\nwant to give pokemon a shot too with my\nkids but\nit seems like pokemon sword and shields\nsuck\nyeah i think pokemon kind of fell off\nafter the ds\nwhen they went 3ds it's kind of but the\nold ones hold up\nlike black black and white um\nthey're good cool so what we just did\nthere is something called coming up for\nair\nokay okay so sometimes when we talk\nabout things that are serious\nwe sometimes crack a joke or we talk\nabout games for a little bit and then we\nkind of come up for air and now we're\ngoing to go back in again\nokay yeah i go for air a lot i don't\nhave a big\nlung yeah\nwe'll see okay we'll see but yeah i\nthink so i think so\ni think that's sort of i think you have\na bigger lung than you give yourself\ncredit for\nokay yeah that's fair uh but i would say\nyou do come up for air a lot so let's\njust try to\nnotice things about what we do right and\nmaybe we'll learn something\nso you say that you kind of wish you had\nmore memories\nbecause can you tell me a little bit\nabout that\nyeah you know like like\ndad dead boom i'm 15. remember a good\namount\nonly like a few years ago five years\nlater\n20 in college can't really remember\nlike maybe like his face or something\nyou know it was like you know you forget\nthe voice the face and then you gotta go\nto like pictures and stuff like\njust like conjure it up and uh like the\nsmell just like things you'll forget\nover time because um\nit happens over time you forget\nthis sounds kind of weird but it almost\nsounds to me like you're\nyou know he didn't die at the age of 10\nit sounds to me like you're actually\nlike kind of losing him piece by piece\ni think you do right i think that's kind\nof how it\ni think it's a a constant war when\nsomeone dies to\nkeep them as much as you can in their\nlives and you\ncan't because you will lose to time\nevery time\ngood job no i'm i'm very impressed by\nyou not coming up for air\nbecause that's some heavy [ __ ] that's a\nbar you're the one\nyou're the one dropping bars there bro\nokay\nthat's it did you notice that like oh i\nlook i tried\nit man i think coming up for air is good\nfor others as well so if i'm live with\nyou know 20k on the reg you know how it\nis uh just came back i don't actually\ni do those that come up for errors come\nup for air dr k um\nuh you know i think other people also\nmight appreciate that if they're not\ntrying to have\nyou know because i think the vibe of the\nstream is expected to be a certain way\nso\nyou come up a good amount then everybody\nelse gets to come up too\nyep yeah\ni wonder if the parasocial relationships\nform when you don't come up for air\ndude yeah yeah\nyeah i feel like even coming on this\nshow could promote social relationships\nif i'm being too\nreal sure and not\nas much of a character yeah and then\nthey're like damn\nit's so real i actually like them now\nand then they give me their money\nso they're like i love you and then\nthey're my dm's dr k\nand and then how does that make you feel\na little bad can't respond all you guys\nappreciate the money easy clap\num i'm gonna toss out a word do you feel\ninadequate\ni used to i think a good amount\ni remember i used to stream like a year\nago and my viewership was like booming\nand i'd have like a really good stream\nlike a banger like\n10k people would be there and then i\nwouldn't want to stream the next day\nbecause i'd be like i'll never hit this\nagain like this is i've peaked this i've\ndone more than i can handle\nand i would just i would i would not be\nable to hit the go live button and i\nwould just lie down on my floor for a\nwhile\nbut i kind of got over that um\ni don't know why i can't exactly pin it\nbut i think i got over that\nyeah so i think there's a lot to cover\ndo you want to you know stick with the\ndad or you want to talk about the\nparasocial\ni'm so open i feel like you're my sherpa\nin a way and i would\nhope you can guide me i i'd happy to i'm\nhappy to be your sherpa\non this journey on a shit-covered\nmountain\nmy dream um yeah so tell me what what do\nyou remember\ni i know that things fade over time and\nand that's sad\nyeah but what do you remember about kind\nof growing up like\nlike like more specific about is this\nabout anything\nabout yeah sure anything any memories\nfrom when you're sure\nuh remember a few from\nit's funny the thing about memories in\nthat if you\nlook up pictures or videos you will form\nlike fake memories based off your like\nnostalgic re-looking at it but i would\nsay the actual memories that stick out\nare\ni used to do a lot of shower races with\nmy dad\nwhich was basically we would both start\nthe shower at the same time who could\nfinish first\nprobably not the best way to teach a kid\nhow to shower\non hindsight you know should take your\ntime behind the ears the whole works but\nuh but those were fun um\ni remember sleeping over friends houses\nuh a bunch playing video games\nand uh yeah there's there's a quit\nthere's a few memories\nschool can you tell me a little bit\nabout your mom\nyeah uh my mom's dope she was a software\nengineer\nand she was let go because like the\ncompany was\num it was it was hewlett-packard and\nthey were just like downsizing\num and then instead of looking for\nanother job in software engineering and\nmaking bank\nshe just like went to school\ngot a business major then became a\nteacher in french and in\nuh spanish uh so she could um\nlike hang out with us because then i\nthink my dad died and she was like oh\nyou know i can't be at work until five\ncause my kids get out of school at three\nwow um and then she was solo mom\ndoing the shits killing it\nand yeah and do you have siblings i have\na sister yeah\nan older sister and\ncan you tell me a little bit about her\nsure yeah she was angsty teen\nyou know on aim i take a peek she gets\nmad she got that\njournal that would be on like\ninfomercials that would lock to voice\nactivation\na bit of a klepto a bit of a trouble\nchild\ngreat heart gotten a bunch of fights\nwith my mom\num yeah no that was that was my sister\nare you guys close now we're pretty\nclose yeah we both live in la we see\neach other occasionally we text a good\namount i think okay\ncool let's see if we can get a\nrelationship now tell me\nyou know what can you tell me about your\ndad or is that\nhard yeah no i can tell you uh he was\nuh he was a cool dad like uh you know\nlike not allowed to watch tv after\nschool because my mom would get mad but\nthe dad would be like because he worked\nfrom home he was like\nyou know run it and then she comes home\nand we have to like you know\ngo through the tom and jerry sequence to\nclean up the house and stuff\nuh and then you know he would he would\nnever narc\num so he's definitely cool dad wore\nsperry's\nbecause he was a big sailor from sweden\nuh lived there most his life well yeah\nwha were sperrys yeah the boating shoe\noh i don't know what that is you might\nrecognize them because like oh i guess\nmaybe not\nit's a newer but it's like uh now it's\ncommonly worn by like frat boys and\nstuff\nit's sperry's and that one brand with\npolos\nokay uh but he was a sailor from sweden\nand so that's why he wore it\nand i was berries for a while after what\nkind of\nafter what he died\nwhat and what does that mean you wore\nsperry's for a while after he died\nlike he died and i was like hey this is\nour thing like this is the this is the\naugren thing we wear sperry's in this\nhouse\ni'm going to be a sperry guy and i\nrocked this berries\nand the frat boys took it over and i\nbacked out\nfrat boys took that away from you they\ntook it away\nthey did i'd never they took it away\nfrom me yeah\nyou didn't want to be like them no god\nno\ndo you wear sperry's now no\nno i wear flip-flops\ncomfortable i'm not i'm not hearing any\nemotion around wearing sperry's now it's\njust sort of like a\nyeah i think i have made\nvery uh deliberate decisions\nto move on from certain things\num that felt like i was attached to for\nno reason\nlike um like i had like his whole\nwardrobe\nand i threw out a bunch of stuff and uh\nand moved on from the sperry's and like\ni had a belt that was his that i wore a\nbunch\nand i've whittled it down to uh to uh i\nwear his ring\nand i have his watch but i'm not wearing\nthe watch right now\nso it sounds like you know you're not\nonly losing him in your mind you're sort\nof like\nlosing you're like sort of letting go of\nthe possessions one by one\nyes yeah because i i thought it was\nunhealthy\nwhat did you think was unhealthy about\nit like\nputting so much of an importance on\ninanimate objects and feeling the need\nto like\nuse them or wear them when like\nif i were to look at it objectively like\nboating shoes are not that convenient\nfor a man who's not on a boat\nand his shirts are not that stylish\nanymore\nso you know it i can keep it in the\ncloset and that's fine and that's great\num\nbut i don't think it like it's not like\nit helps me recall anything\nand i don't think it is functional in my\nday-to-day\nsure where i feel the need to keep it\nyeah\ni think sometimes um you know you can\nalso kind of think of it as like growing\nout of it\nlike i think there are times where you\nknow you may have needed those things\nfor a particular reason and and maybe\nyou just don't anymore\num sounds like a natural part of the\ngrief process to me\nyeah i would i would agree and and how\ndid he\npass away if you don't mind me asking\nalcoholic\nuh and i forget my mom told me\nlike a couple years ago but the nitty\ngritty is\nprobably not that fun to talk about\nbecause it's like something\nbut basically it comes down to he was an\nalcoholic [ __ ] up his insides\nwas refusing to go to the hospital\ncoughed up blood for a bit\nand then uh and then just died\ninternal bleeding stuff like that i\nthink\nwow that's kind of grim yeah\nyeah you wanna i can we can come up for\nair\ni'm okay are you okay i'm good i'm good\num i mean did you understand what was\nhappening\nyeah yeah i was 10 i do remember this\nquite vividly\ni was sleeping in my mom's room because\nhe was like\nnot having the best day he was sleeping\nin the guest room\nand uh at some point during the evening\nmy sister went to the neighbors because\nshe was like a bit like stressed out\nlike she gets really stressed and\nthen he went into the bathroom and then\nmy mom got up and i think he started\nthrowing up blood she called the cops\nthey came i went to the neighbors\nand they came back the next day and it\nwas uh it was bad news\ndo you remember anything about what you\nthought was happening or how you felt at\nthe time\nuh i was pretty scared when i was in my\nmom's room\nand then i went to the neighbors and i\njust kind of slept and chilled\nand just tried to like wait and then\nyeah and then they came back and i and i\ngot and i kind of got it\nframe one cried i think things that died\nfor me before\nso i kind of knew what death was i'm\nsorry i always\nwhat like like animals have died i think\noh is is my thing cut out where are we\ngood\nno no no no i just understood you i\nthought you said things have died for\nyou before\nyeah like i think i understood the\nconcept of death i think we had had\na family cat die and and so i think i\nhad understood my mom had explained it\nto me because one time i asked her i\nsaid how many lives do we get\nafter playing like mario 64 and she's\nlike oh\nlike one and i was like damn that sucks\nand she was like yeah\nso i kind of knew going in that you get\nthe game over bowser screen\num on your first go so when\nshe was like he's dead i was like oh\nthat sucks\nyou know should have got 100 coins kind\nof stupid of them but hmm\njust a quick come up just a quick yeah i\nknow it's okay\num if i don't come up with you it's\nbecause i'm trying to stay down\nand and you'll if i come up with sure\nwe'll be up for a little while\ni just can't farm too many sages i have\na quota\nyep that's why we come up for air the\nultimate way to come up for air is a\ndick joke\nthat's yeah to tie a dick joke into my\ndad's death would be phenomenal\nyeah i'll come up with one rigor mortis\nwho knows\nright there look at that look at how\neasy it is\nlook at how look at how buoyant your\nmind is classic good one\nyeah that's what you got to come up with\num\nit's important to you to be funny isn't\nit yeah it's my job now\nyeah coming up is what you do for a\nliving\nyeah i would agree um\nyou're very good at it you're very funny\ni think uh\nweaving serious topics while i guess\nwe'll phrase it coming up is uh\ni think good because it allows you to\ntalk about more serious things with\npeople who might not want to\nbecause it usually sucks yep it's it's\nvery very\num healthy actually so i think it's\ninteresting because one of the things we\nrealized uh\nin the healthy gamer community\ncommunities we're like starting to\nactually like\nget into comedians or it seems like a\nlot of comedians seem to\nreally need a lot of mental health\nsupport i think they're another\npopulation that like\ngets very very poorly served by the\nmental health system\nso it's a bizarre thing that we're sort\nof noticing\num and i think that there is a lot of\nlike there's a lot of truth in comedy\nright comedy helps us\nsit with very very scary things yeah\nmore easily i i i know that you know\nsometimes some of the\nin a sense most insensitive jokes but\nalso some of the most\nimportant jokes that we make or after\ncodes in the hospital\na code is um when you know like on these\nlike medical shows when they're doing\nchest compressions and\nthey say clear and paddles and stuff\nlike that i think you'll hear the most\njokes like after that\nreally yeah okay it's just hard to sit\nwith like trying to keep someone alive\nfor 40 minutes and then\nyou know yeah so they die yeah\nso you got to break it yep um\nbut you know did you understand that\nyour dad was an alcoholic when you were\ngrowing\nup yeah for sure\ni think yeah how did you know that\nhe got arrested for a dui we lived very\nclose to the liquor store\nuh maybe a mile away and i think he just\nhe went\nhe bought it six to 12 pack whatever\ncracked one\nand then they pulled him over in our\ndriveway actually arrested him took him\nto jail\ni don't think he was even drunk and then\nhe got his license suspended so\nit was obvious because he would walk to\nthe liquor store\nevery day uh and like you know\nlike i was like eight nine but i know\nwhere he's going you know because i also\ncalled her the candy store because they\nhad candy there\nbut he was never going for candy doctor\nkevin it was always for the alcohol\nuh and kids had brought it up as well\nand\noh kids that brought about what what is\nthat yeah i mean\nthis [ __ ] zack on the bus one\ngrade older\nuh would sit in the back because that's\nwhere the cool kids sit and\nhe was just like i forget exactly how it\nstarted but he's like\nhe was just roasting me because my dad\ndidn't have a license and would\ngo buy alcohol and walk there and [ __ ]\nlike that\nyeah that sounds do you remember how you\nfelt or how you responded\ni think i got mad called him a pimple\nbutt\nyou should have seen him he was torn up\nfrom that one\nnice yeah well well played\num and do you know if your mom had\ndid your mom and dad ever talk about\ntheir his drinking\nyeah i mean they definitely had some\nsome fights about it she definitely\nwanted him to not\ndrink because she was like you're gonna\ndie if you keep drinking\nand he had periods where he would stop\nbecause of that\num but then you know he's addicted so\nhe would eventually relapse and he\ndidn't really like professional help\nbecause i think he thought it was like\nmaybe admitting a problem too much or\nwhatever so\nand he just thought he had control over\nit and uh i don't think he really did\nnow ludwig i would i would say that you\nknow\nsometimes uh kids in your situation\nend up being very very like angry\nwith their dad but what i'm hearing from\nyou\nis that it's super matter of fact\nyeah i don't think addiction's his fault\ni think that was\nlike passed to him yeah do you blame him\nno not really i think he could have gone\nto the hospital\nand he would have probably had a few\nmore years but\nno i think he uh he did good as a dad i\nfeel he did a good job\nfor 10 years could have done it longer\nadmittedly but the 10 were good so you\nknow\nwho are you to complain i can't complain\ni got a good tenant\nkids who have a worse upbringing are\nmore deserving than you huh\nto complain um yes\nthey are in fact yeah\npeople who haven't like so you know\nother people with anxiety their\ntheir deserve to come on but you know\na kid who loses his dad from alcohol and\nwatches his dad vomit blood\nand um then dies you don't deserve to\ncome on\nand get support\ni would agree\nagree with what that\nat the end of the day if anything bad\nhappens in life\nsomeone else had it worse and i think\nthat you can uh just look at the\npositives\ni'm gonna have to sit with that for a\nsecond and also i'm gonna grab a tissue\nis that okay\ngo for it just let me let me think about\nmy comeback\nif he says pimple butt we're over\nprofessionally and romantically\nhmm\nfull disclosure i came up for her when\nyou were gone oh you did\nyeah just full disclosure what'd i miss\nit was\nit's less funny if i tell you if you go\nback and watch it you might have a laugh\nokay\ndo you remember thinking when you were\nyoung that there are people who are like\nlike you're actually pretty lucky\ndespite your dad passing away\nthat i was yeah i mean that you were\nlucky to have him around as long as you\ndid and stuff like that\nyeah for sure\nso i mean i'm a yeah i was gonna say i\nthink in general i had a good\nupbringing like you know in middle class\ndad died but he had life insurance so\ncollege paid mostly outside of like a\nbit of student loan but true you know i\nthink that's that's pretty\npretty good that's a good life\nmom bought me a car that's nice that's\neasy\nmove to la you have a lot to be grateful\nfor yes\nyes let me ask you something if you have\na lot to be grateful for does\nit mean that you have\nis it possible to be grateful for things\nand ungrateful for things at the same\ntime or is it either or\nit is but i think the energy spent\nreflecting on what you're grateful for\nis more valuable than what you aren't or\nupset about\nbecause that you cannot change and what\nyou're grateful for\nis something that you can keep\nand continue to grow and like you know\ni think it's more valuable\ni can get behind that\nat the same time i disagree\nlook you know i can be 15 maul that you\nknow\nmy jonah had a dad until he was 17 and\nmy dad died at 10\nor i can be like damn i got this sweet\ncar because my mom is nice\nthat's pog and i think that it's a\nbetter head space to be in the second\nworld\ni agree with that so there's there's\nthere's one thing there's one thing that\ni would\nswitch in your words okay sure you can\nbe mauled at\nwhoever that is at 15 because they have\na dad or\nyou can be grateful for the the car\nand this is where i would say replace\nthe ore with an end\nbut why be mauled\nbecause you're only mauled at life which\nyou have no control over\ngetting mad at something i have no\ncontrol over seems like a fruitless\nendeavor\nlet me think about that for a second\nbecause i i think you're\nright\nwhat do you have control over\ncurrent life relationships\nand um how do you have control over your\nrelationship what do you have control\nover in your relationship\nhow i act in them\n[Music]\nuh and\ni would say that's the biggest one yeah\nhow i act in relationships\nhow i show appreciation everything\nperfect right so what do you have\ncontrol over in your stream\num everything really\nif it even starts you have control over\nyour viewership\ni in a way i would say yeah how so\ni can choose what i do uh which will\ninfluence it\ni think everything i do will impact that\nokay\nokay hold on though so sure what i'm\nhearing is that in your relationship you\nhave control over your actions\nin the relationship you don't have\ncontrol over\nqd's responses right that is true yeah\nin streaming you don't really have\ncontrol over your viewership but you\nhave control over what you do\ni think the comparison\nof like because i get it like i don't\nhave control over other people's\nresponses i would say two things one you\ncan\nlike kind of predict based off of\nlike previous encounters what might be a\npositive response\nand i think that is even more viable in\nstreaming where data is\neverywhere and i can very quickly\nunderstand you know hey this will do\ngreat so let's be a little bit precise\ni have control over flushing the toilet\nbut i don't have control over whether\nthe poop goes down\nyeah but it's gone down like almost\nevery time\nsure but let's let's be precise okay\nsure\nwhat i have control over is whether the\ntoilet gets flush\nthat is true right i did i've never i\nalways thought i made the poop go down\nbut you're right i only just\nflick the nozzle yep yep\nand and so i i i ask you to kind of\nrevisit this idea of like okay so\nyou know what do you have control over\nlike you can't change it like you can't\nchange anything anyway\ni think if i thought that way\ni would not be a big streamer though\nbecause if i thought i had that little\ncontrol i would never have tried\nstreaming because i would thought i\ncan't get people to come on stream\nyeah so this is this is the really\nchallenging thing ludwig is i think you\ni think you're doing great i don't think\nyou're someone who has all these\nproblems or things like that i i don't\nmean to make a mountain out of a\nmolehill\num at the same time i think that there\nare still like areas that all human\nbeings can grow\nand i think the real challenge here is\nthat\nwhat we have to what i think would help\nyou move forward in life which by the\nway i think it's just\nyou know i i don't know if you if i had\nasked you to start with death\ndo you think we like it's just weird\nlike the themes are just like\nin your face from today right so first\nof all\nyou toss out this comment about how\nyou're not deserving to be here\nit's also kind of like i think you could\nask a thousand people on the street\nyou know you're you're grateful for\neverything that you had in life which is\nawesome but like i think\nif you polled a thousand people and\nthey're like you know this kid had his\ndad die from alcoholism at the age of 10\nand he saw him vomiting up blood like\nand he's grateful like is that you know\nfeels a little bit weird to me\nand yeah i mean if you boil it down sure\nyeah right so so you didn't even add in\nthe pog car\nsure and a car makes it okay wow\nlike it was a dog car\ni mean must have been yeah right to\noutweigh\nlosing your dad at the age of 10. yeah\nwell i mean\njetta they do it right in germany i'll\ntell you yeah\nso so i and and like i don't and i think\nwhat you're doing is\nis healthy right so i think you're right\nthat like most people\nlearn that dwelling on the past and like\ngetting hung up on things that i can't\nchange is not like productive or healthy\nand doesn't make me happy\ni'm with you we've we can talk to or\nhave talked to on stream i've certainly\ntalked with people\nnot even patients just people who get\ncaught up in the past\nand it's not healthy so i'm with you\nthere but i think that like the\nchallenge is that when we think about\nyou know growth there's the low-hanging\nfruit\nand then there's the high-hanging fruit\nand i think where we\nare is all the low-hanging fruit has\nbeen taken care of like you've survived\nyou've thrived you've grown\nit sounds like you're in a healthy\nrelationship sounds like you appreciate\nyour mom sounds like you know i haven't\nasked you if you drink and stuff but\nyou know i don't think we need to but\nyou know i'm guessing that you\ndon't and that it isn't a problem for\nyou even though genetically you may be\npredisposed\nonce a week you do a what a classy once\na week\nwhat's a classy like a classy once a\nweek drink\nwhat does that mean like you know just\nlike like a classy one\nit's not like early enough and i'll just\ndo like once a week\njust have my classy drinks and then move\non with the rest of my week\nokay um and\nyeah so like i was saying you realize\nyou railed you my bed\nit's it's all good man um\nbut you i gotta i gotta get back on the\nrails hold on a second\nyeah so like low hanging fruit and high\nhanging fruit right so i think this is\nthe challenge so if you look at like the\nyogis would say that\nthe first problems you solve in your\nmind are the easy ones\nand the more the higher up you go the\nmore you level up\nlike it's almost like an rpg where you\nneed more xp to level up\nand the issues become more and more\nsubtle and\ni think you've adapted really well\nyou've bounced back really well you have\na lot of like really like you're an\nincredibly resilient person\nright you've learned how to look at the\npositive instead of the negative\nthat's helped you like not wash away\nwith like the negativity that you deal\nwith\nit probably has a lot to do with like\nhow successful you are on twitch because\nyour mind is it's really healthy it's\nlike your mind has learned how to shift\naway from the negative and look to the\npositive\nthe challenge is that looking at the\npositive instead of the negative\ndoesn't actually make the negative go\naway\nyeah and and this is where you know if\nyou really i think there's this like\nthere's a and i think we'll get to this\nbecause you already said we're gonna\ntalk about that today\nso so you know i i i mean i wonder if\nthat has anything to do with\num oh god you know whether there's\nwhether it's one life and then game over\nor you can collect coins and\nand you know i wonder if there's some\npart of you that's like\ncurious about like where is your dad now\nyeah yeah probably\ni think he thought he was very uh\nagnostic he was like you know\nit'll be nothingness type of guy\nsucks for him if that's the case why is\nthat bad\nit doesn't seem very fun\nwhat you want to talk about that\nlet's do it i wanted to coming in what\ndid you want to talk about\nuh help me understand what you want to\nunderstand about death\nokay so i had this moment in\ndisneyland i think before my dad died i\nwas like nine\num where i had a dream and then the\ndream\nwas life after death and but my dream\nwas nothing\nand then i woke up with a panic attack\nand then i think i've been a little\nmonka w on death ever\nsince what does monka w on death mean\nscared\nwhat are you afraid of when it comes to\nthat\nif i'm right\num then\nlife is so much better\nthan death yeah and death is so much\nlonger\nthan life\nokay so ludwig we can\ndo this two ways okay i can just tell\nyou\noh yeah or we can like you know\nask you questions and sort of like or we\ncould just explain how death works\nhey i prima strategy guided every game\nas a kid i am unoffended if you just\ntell me the answers\nokay so let's talk about death\nso let me think about how to do this\nwhere do you start\nman a little bit\nprepared sure should i ask questions\nsure you you can but i i may just get\nthere if i i'm just trying to figure out\nthe sequence of things but\ngo ahead and ask a question oh okay dr k\nwhat happens after you die\nit's a good question let me think about\nit\nso i think to understand what happens\nafter you die you have to start by\nunderstanding like\nwhat is like how does the how does like\nthe universe work\nokay so i'm gonna start actually with a\nstory\nso i was um i was working uh at\num this place called massachusetts\ngeneral hospital and if you grew up in\nnew hampshire sometimes you know we\nwould get people from new hampshire\num and you know i'm a psychiatrist so i\nwas doing my\npsychiatry consult rotation which means\nthat you work in the general part of the\nhospital you don't work on the psychoard\nand so different teams will call you so\nlike we would manage alcohol\nso like sometimes you know someone would\ncome in for like a knee replacement\nand then they would start going into\nalcohol withdrawal so we would like help\npeople manage alcohol withdrawal and i\ngot a call from\nthe the folks in the neuro icu okay so\nthis is the neurological part of the\nhospital\nintensive care unit and so\num there was a patient who had gotten\ninto a motor vehicle accident was in a\ncoma for two months\nand then was out and then so anytime you\nconsult a service you have to have like\na question\nso you can't just like call a\ncardiologist and be like\nwe need help you have to call a\ncardiologist and you have to say\nhey we did an ekg which is something\nthat checks your heart rhythm and the\nekg looks weird\nwe don't know what to do with it can you\ncome help us out so the consult question\nfor us as psychiatrists says the patient\ncries when no one is looking\nand so they're like we're not really\nsure like what's going on\nlike he cries when no one's looking and\nso i'm like all right cool so we get a\nlot of weird questions because a lot of\npeople don't have the vocabulary to like\nunderstand\nwhat you know how to frame things for\na for psychiatrist so i was like okay\ncool so i go and i talk to the guy\nand you know i asked the team i'm like\nyou know what you know what's going on\nlike what's his prognosis and they're\nlike oh he's gonna like he's gonna need\nto do probably three months of physical\ntherapy\nhe'll make a full recovery his family is\nthrilled\nthey come in every day he's got two\nyoung boys\num you know like they're all super happy\nlike they were super worried for a while\nhe seems to be happy that he's with them\nokay like what's going on with his job\nand they're like i don't know because we\ndon't ask those kinds of questions i'm\nlike okay so like maybe he's upset about\nyou know something so i go and i ask him\nand i screen him for depression\nand the screen is negative i ask him are\nyou sad and he's like no\nlike what's your understanding of like\nwhat's happening\nlike or you know you're gonna be\ndisabled and he's like no i'm not gonna\nbe disabled\nhow are things with your wife things are\ngreat she's super happy they were\nworried for a while i'm glad\ni'm going to be okay if she's going to\nglad she's good being you know\neverything's going to be okay so like no\ndivorce or anything like that\nyou know you guys like having marital\ntrouble he's like no\nhe's like okay so maybe it's the job\nright like maybe his dude's been in a\ncoma for two months so he's like broke\nfinancially and like that's why he's\ndepressed\nit's like no my boss is super\nunderstanding i have really good health\ninsurance like you know i'll go back to\nwork\nlike you know my co-workers have come to\nvisit me like it's actually fine i'm\njust like really confused and i'm like\nyou know what's going on with this guy\nand so i\nscreen's negative for depression i'm\njust not sure like i don't understand\nright\nand so then like i check on him every\nday because that's what we've been\nassigned to him and i go to the team and\nthey're like what's wrong with him have\nyou fixed him yet and i'm like no i\ndon't know what's wrong with him\nand then you know i come back the next\nday and i like i'm like how's the you\nknow how's the patient doing he's like\nyeah he's still like cries when no one's\nlooking\ni was like what the [ __ ] am i supposed\nto do about that and they're like i\ndon't know what you're the [ __ ]\npsychiatrist you figure it out\nhave him stop crying he's like really\nlike bothering like the nurses are super\nworried\nand so i check on him day after day\nafter day asking you know you think\nabout killing yourself are you suicidal\nare you depressed are you anxious are\nyou\nhearing voices you know he's like no no\nno everything's fine i'm happy i have a\nlot to be grateful for\na lot of gratitude i've got a nice job\ni've got healthy\nfamily kids you know i could have been\ndisabled i could have been brain damaged\ni could have been dead and those things\nare true\nso finally like on day four day five i'm\nworking this weekend\nand it's a [ __ ] saturday and i'm\n[ __ ] pissed because it's a saturday\ni'm\nat the hospital come see this guy every\nsingle day then i'm like dude so i just\nasked him i'm like so you don't seem\ndepressed you say everything is fine\nwhy do the nurses keep on writing my ass\nabout you crying when no one's looking\njust that i was like why do you cry when\nno one's looking [ __ ] tell me\nand so he's conceived that i'm\nfrustrated and this is you know it's\nactually a little bit of a calculated\nplay but i\nyou know i've come and i built a rapport\nwith him and i asked him just tell me\nlike what's going on why do you cry\nand he says doc if i tell you you're\ngoing to think i'm crazy\nand and then i say okay i mean\nthat's i mean i may think you're crazy\nbut i'd love to hear\nand he says like when i was in a coma\nlike i lived another life\nand like i have memories just like from\nthis life\nand i was married and i had two little\ngirls and like i was happy in that life\ni was\nyou know he was like some kind of\nengineer or something like he remembers\nlike\nhe remembers all of these things and\nhe's like the reason i cry is because i\nrealize like i'm never going to see my\ngirls again\nand i mean what do you mean you're never\ngoing to see your girls i thought you\nhad two sons and he's like yeah i have\nboys in this life but i like i had girls\nand like\ni loved them i was there when they were\nborn i was there when you know my\ndaughter got her first period because\nmy wife was like traveling for work and\nlike i had to go pick up tampons and\nlike i have all of these like\nmemories and and what i realized is like\nthe dude is like he's like\ngrieving a life that existed within his\ncoma\nand it's really wild because if you\nactually talk to people who are\nin comas this is a relatively common\nexperience\nthat what they experience in the coma\nfeels real\nwhat do you think about that uh sounds\nlike some inception [ __ ] it is some\ninception [ __ ]\nyeah um\nyeah i don't know it sounds\nit sounds interesting\nand i feel like\nthere's some explanation\nin your brain right neurons firing yeah\nyeah some nerdy scientists who can use\nwords to explain that but\nyeah so that's where you know it's\ninteresting because\nscience so you know when we look at\nscientific evidence\nthere's no evidence of any kind of thing\nin the afterlife\nor anything like that right yeah so\nyou've got like religions who believe in\nheaven and hell and whatnot\nbut the really interesting thing like\nthe the method that i kind of prescribe\nto is is a couple of things first is\nthat\nyou have to understand the nature of\nlike experience\nmind consciousness and existence and\nwhat i mean by that is like\nhow do you know ludwig that you were\nalive\nuh cause i because i am\nokay so how do you know that you are\nbecause i interact with a human world in\na\ni feel like a way that\nis tangible and vivid enough that it\ncan't be fabricated\nokay hold on a second so let's let's get\ninto tangible and vivid\nwhat about the world is tangible\nand what about the world is vivid what\ndo you mean by those words\nwell like everything you know like i\nlike i can i can like i can pick up a\ncrush\ncup and crush it you know how do you\nknow that the cup is real\nbecause it feels real okay it looks real\nyep okay so so if we think about it\nyep so so if we really think about it\nwhat you're saying is that you're using\nyour sense organs\nto collect data from the outside world\nyeah but\nultimately it is your feeling of those\nthings that determines existence\nyes right so this is kind of interesting\nbecause like let's say i'm gonna you\nknow ask you i hope this is a safe\nquestion\ndo you love cutie yeah how do you know\nfeel good when so it's feelings right so\nlike this is\nthis is really important to understand\nso there's a barrier\nbetween the outside world and the inner\nworld and all of our understanding of\nwhat happens in the outside world is\nactually through the inner world\nit is your experience of things that\nthat determines\nthat is the foundation of what you\nunderstand to be real\nokay right and and this is where like\nthis is um\nyou know descartes sort of said cogito\nergosome i think therefore i am\nyeah and what descartes sort of noticed\nis that like even if i'm hallucinating\nthere has to be something that is\nexperiencing just yarn bro it's cool\njust um there has to be there has to be\nsomething that is\nstill being tricked right even in a\nhallucination\neven if the outside world is real there\nhas to be something that is observing\nthe hallucination\nso something has to exist yeah\nand the yogis determined the same thing\nand what they realized is that actually\nlike if you look at dreams and reality\nthere's actually no difference between a\ndream and reality\nbecause in the dream it feels just as\nreal as reality does\nokay right so so then it\nyeah what about like the laws\nlike i feel like science makes\neverything make sense like it's real if\nthat makes sense like\nthere are laws and rules and a system\nand it's and everything falls in line\nquite well\nand we can predict the mars will be here\nbecause it\ndoes that and i feel like in dream you\nknow\ni i'm running away from big crab man and\nlike it feels real in the moment but\nlike a a dream has an internal\nconsistency\nokay why do we wait the internal\nconsistency of waking more than the\ninternal consistency of dreaming\nbecause if you really think about it in\nthe dream you're not like\nthere's no such thing as internal\nthere's like giant walking crab men\nyou do sometimes though right like\noccasionally the dream will be so\npreposterous that you'll like you'll be\nlike\nand wake up okay now we're getting\nsomewhere wait was it a trap\nokay if by trap mean you've made a very\nimportant discovery then yes\nokay right so so this is where there's a\nset of meta\nso what happens in that moment in the\ndream\nusually i wake up\nyeah so tell me about your experience\njust say as much as you can\nsure yeah i remember i had dreams a lot\nas a kid that a samurai would come to my\nhouse\nand i would wake up in my house and i\nsaw the samurai through the window\nbad samurai the samurai was coming to\nkill my mother\nand i i couldn't lock the doors the\nsamurai would always break through\nand then and then would get go into my\nmom's room\nand and i was like [ __ ] this guy is\nowning me because it happened so many\ntimes\nand then a couple times the samurai came\nthrough\nand then i would i would i would be like\nyou know i would try to notice something\nspecific\nabout the samurai that looked goofy\nbecause\nand i would be like that's samurai i was\nwearing no shoes or something then i'd\nbe like that's weird\nand then i would and then i would wake\nup\nokay so you would find some internal\nconsistent inconsistency in the dream\nyeah you would wake up yeah right\nlet me think about how to\nso this is i'll just sort of try to toss\nsomething i'm going to toss out a\nhypothesis okay\nso the first thing to understand is that\nlike with the the experience of things\nin the dream\nis just as real as the experience of\nthings in reality\nyeah the fear that you feel in a dream\nis just as real\nyou know if you wet your pants in a\ndream it's it feels the same\nyeah the interesting thing though is i\nthought i peed myself today\ncan't remember my dream but i woke up\nand i was like i [ __ ] peed myself\nand there's no pee on me so i was good\nyeah yeah so\nso it and then similarly like if we\nthink about it like if if you\nyou know went to bed with heartburn in\nreality\nin the dream the heartburn disappears\nright so like there are conditions from\nreality that disappear in dreams\nand their conditions and dreams that\ndisappear from reality\nyeah and we tend to wait\nreality but really we're not waiting\nreality we're just\nwaiting wherever our mind is at the\nmoment as real\nyeah okay so then the question becomes\nhow do you do this thing of snapping out\nof it\nand what what the yogis sort of realize\nis that that there is\nthere is actually something that is\noutside of your mind so this is where\nlike the next step is that they realize\nthat\nthe observer and the observer\nthe in the object of observation can\nnever be the same\nso when you look at your face in a\nmirror what are you looking at\nare you looking at yourself\nyes no uplift\nno you're not looking at yourself what\nare you actually looking at what is\nwhat absolutely you're looking at an\nimage\nright right so you're looking at\nsomething outside of you so the eyes\ncannot observe themselves you can never\nsee your eyes\nwhat do you think about that i\nget it conceptually but i still feel\nlike i know my eye\nlike if oh if i pulled out my eye\ni would know that's my eye have you ever\nseen your eye before\nonly through reflections good right so\nso i don't doubt that you know what your\neye is\nand now we're getting into sort of the\nnature of knowledge you know what your\neye is because you have an\nexperience of your eye but you have\nnever seen your\neye you've seen pictures of your eye\nyou've seen reflections of your eye\nyou've seen images of your eye\ncompletely agree but you've never seen\nyour\neye yeah so the yogi sort of realized\nlike this is kind of weird because if i\ncan observe my\nthoughts then my there must be something\noutside of me that is not my mind\nand what i would say is that in the\ndream so we're going to call that thing\nconsciousness\nokay and i would say in the dream\nyou become conscious that the mind in\nthis reality is not real\nand it is that rising of consciousness\nabove the mind which experiences\nthoughts and fears\nand predictions and analysis and tries\nto control the\nreactions of others that all happens\nwithin the mind and then the\nconsciousness realizes they're like\noh [ __ ] this is this is weird\nyeah and then you snap out of it okay so\nis this also like\nbecause i used to lucid dream as a kid\nis the ability to live in your mind\nunderstanding it's something your mind\ncreated similar then too\nsure we'll get there okay so i'm not\nsurprised that you lucid dreams so\nthere's a very interesting\ngarment to this entire conversation\nabout is it worth it\nkarma karma okay okay so\nuh because i i think i'm going to teach\nyou a meditation technique which which i\nthink is\nworks better for people who are capable\nof lucid dreaming\nokay because lucid dreaming is sort of\nthe first step that allows you to\nseparate consciousness from mind\nessentially what i'm going to try to\nteach you is how to lose a dream while\nyou're awake\nokay that'd be hard i've not done it in\nlike 15 years\nso so this is where like the yogis\nultimately what they concluded so\nif you succeed at pulling your\nconsciousness out of your mind\nthat is what we call samadhi or\ntemporary enlightenment\nand what happens to people who become\nenlightened is they begin to realize\nthat there literally is no difference\nbetween\ndream and reality\nnow people may think that that means\nthat what you do becomes\nirrelevant but we'll get to that in a\nsecond it's not actually true\nokay um it actually becomes even more\nrelevant\nand but essentially like so the nature\nof reality is that like there's this\nthing called\nconsciousness so now i'll just explain a\ncouple of other things so the yogis\nultimately came to the conclusion\nthat so they did these practices where\nthey essentially like lucid dreamed in\nreality\nand they did a lot of thorough studies\ntheir particular techniques which are\nfunny because the techniques around\ndreaming and the techniques around death\nare very closely related\nso they're actually like a stepwise if\nyou really want to understand\ndeath you have to start with techniques\naround dreaming\nand it's all part of like it's bizarre\nthat you're a lucid dreamer you're\ninterested in learning about death and\nlike we're going to teach you about that\num so this is what they ultimately\nconcluded that reality the basic unit of\nexistence\nis consciousness that when consciousness\noscillates at a particular wavelength i\nknow this is going to sound\nsuper hokey you know it doesn't need to\nmake sense because ultimately all this\nis experiential\nonce you experience this then you'll\nunderstand it it's like i'm trying to\nexplain to you\nyou know what what love is and like\nyou're not gonna understand it until you\nexperience it\nyeah so based on some of their\nexplorations and i'll teach you one\npractice today the conclusions that they\ncame to is that\nconsciousness is the basic unit of\nexistence when consciousness\ncoalesces it forms energy and when\nenergy coalesces\nit forms matter so in a small amount of\nmatter there's an exponential amount of\nenergy and when there's in a small\namount of energy there's an exponential\namount of consciousness\nand what is this thing consciousness\nit's kind of hard to describe but the\nbest experience that you're going to get\nis it's your awareness that exists\noutside of mind\nokay yeah so then\nwe sort of start to get to death and\nit's like so what is death so death is\nsort of the annihilation of body and\nmind but the yogis\nactually claim that the consciousness\nstill persists like so matter and energy\ncannot be destroyed right like\nnothing in this world can truly be\ndestroyed yeah that's true\nit just changes so then the question\nbecomes like\nokay so your matter changes into fish\nfood your body is made of stardust\nthat we're fine with energy cannot be\ncreated and destroyed\nbut what about consciousness now this is\nwhere there's like a very important\ndeviation between west and east because\nwest says that consciousness is simply\na manifestation of neurons firing\nbut i don't know how to explain this but\nlike it's fundamentally wrong because\nlike\nan experience is not an experience is\nqualitatively different\nfrom matter and is it qualitatively\ndifferent from energy\ndoes that make sense yeah like you do\nthere\nthey might fire the same but they can be\ndifferent no\nit's like it's exists on a different\nlike so you know matter and energy are\nfundamentally different right\nyes is experi is experiencing something\nyeah matter\ni would think not right and is\nexperiencing something energy\ni would think not maybe like energy of\nme burning my brain cells but\nno no but that's all matter right so\nwhat i'm saying is that fundamentally\nthese buckets\nare like different stuff the stuff of\nexperience\nsure there's a neurological correlate\nlike i don't\ndoubt that right so for example when i\ndrink this water\ni have taste buds on my tongue that will\ndetect certain chemicals\nthose chemicals will route to my\ngustatory cortex\nand my gustatory cortex will sort of\nroute to my gustatory association cortex\nand will tell me this water is good yeah\nbut\neven though that neurological pathway\nhappens\nit doesn't capture the actual experience\nof water\nyeah okay so you can study the\nneuroscience of fear as much as you want\nto\nit's not going to teach you what feeling\nafraid is like\nyeah okay so the yogis sort of concluded\nthat like\nthere are these three buckets experience\nis its own bucket\nand this is where things get really\ninteresting because still in a dream\nyou experience so they actually\nconcluded that dreams and reality are\nactually like no different\nthat all of and so when we talk about\nenlightenment\none of the things that people say is you\nsort of like wake up\nand that's when you become enlightened\nand that may sound like super mystical\nbut we actually do this [ __ ]\nall the time where like you kind of talk\nabout getting caught up and stuff right\nso you say that you used to feel\ninadequate\nyou would lie down on the floor and your\nmind would be telling you all sorts\nof things and then i think at some point\nyou woke up\nand you stopped doing that and you're\nmore at peace because you kind of just\nwoke up and if someone were to ask you\nludwig how do i stop caring about my\nviewers\nand you'd be like i don't know and\nthey're like how did you do it and you\nwere like\ni laid down for a while the thoughts\nwere in my head\ni tortured myself and then it just kind\nof stopped one day\nand then they they go and they lay down\nand they're like i'm being tortured\nludwig how do i stop and you're like\ni don't know it just kind of happened\nthat is an example\nof you becoming more conscious\nokay you're less trapped within your\nmind it's just like you snap\nout of the dream and then you awake to\nreality you snap out of that mental\npattern you're like\ni really can't do anything about it i'm\njust gonna make the [ __ ] content that\ni want to\ni'm just gonna control whatever i can\nwhich is myself it's like does that make\nsense you become more conscious\nit's also like we call this like taking\na step back\nright where sometimes you get so tangled\nup in something\nand then you learn how to take a step\nback and if we think about what you did\nin the dream\nyou took a step back from the dream and\nit shattered the dream\nand so what the yogis say is that this\nis something that can be learned it is a\nskill\nthe process of learning to stay take a\nstep back\nmakes you more conscious results in more\npeace\nand tranquility results in more control\nover your mind\nand moves you one step towards something\nthat they call divinity which is like\nthe ultimate realization\nthat it's like taking the complete step\nback\nyeah with me you can only do that\nyou can just do that whenever is like\nthis complete step back\nsort of yeah or arguably you've already\ndone it\nyou just don't realize it i have i have\none\nhole that i want to talk about real\nquick yeah\npeople old people are my whole why are\nold people your whole\nbecause they get we\nget like dumber and when you're older\nyour brain starts to i feel like\ndeteriorate a bit\nand it can be because of you know\nwhatever\nuh malady you've gone through but you\nknow like the older you get like when\nyou're like\n95 sometimes your brain starts to like\nyou know get a little less sharp but\nwouldn't the conscious only get stronger\nwhy would the consciousness get stronger\nbecause it's experienced more and it's\nnot weighted to\nbodily problems\nlet me think about that so you're saying\nthat\nsince there is a brain that decays and\nolder people appear to be less conscious\nthe more their brain decays wouldn't\nthat imply that consciousness is born of\nthe brain\nyes\nyes you are correct\nbro the yogi should have brought me in\nwhat now so that's where i would\ni don't know whether consciousness\ni the short answer is that's something i\nactually don't know so the only way to\nreally understand that\ni think it's actually still holds up but\nreally the true way to understand that\nis to have\na mental decay and see if you can\npreserve a sense of consciousness\nyeah because i guess we only know that\nbased off how we perceive them to act\nbut maybe their brain is\nchilling yep so so you may just you just\nmay be aware and this happens sometimes\nright where like you're observing your\nmind going wild\nlike you'll see this a lot in people\nhave panic attacks\nwhere they recognize that their mind is\ngoing crazy and there's a part of them\nthat's like holy [ __ ]\nmy mind is wild i can't control it at\nall it happens\nsometimes if i take an edible you so you\ncan still\nso so but then the question is someone\non the outside\neven though your awareness of your mind\nand your consciousness may be intact\nsomeone on the outside would say you're\nimpaired\ni it's not that they outwardly say it\nbut i'm like that's what the perception\nwould be\nyes yes right so so like and i think so\nthen the question becomes does your\nquality of so\nactually you can do this experiment so\nthis is where ultimately ludwig like\nit's not going to be logic that pokes a\nhole in this\nthe only way you can ever poke a hole in\nthis is to experience something\ncome to me and then you're not going to\npoke a hole you're going to tell me\nyou are wrong because then you will have\nan experience of it so this is what i\nwould say\nfirst of all understand that the the\nquality of consciousness\nand then see if the quality of\nconsciousness alters\nthrough alterations in your\nneurochemistry\nand this is where like one of my\nfavorite experiences is meditating while\ndrunk\nbecause my experience has actually been\nthat the consciousness remains exactly\nthe same\nit is simply the mind and the body which\nchange\nyeah and actually the more that i think\nabout it\nthat actually what your suggestion is\nprobably actually gives us better\nevidence\nfor what i'm saying which is that mind\nand body are actually fundamentally\ndifferent from consciousness\ni'm following i have never thought about\nthat but it is\ntrue that i have reflected on how\ni am acting which yeah yeah that's\nphilosophically deep for my brain i\nthink so forget about philosophy this is\nnot about philosophy this is about\nexperience\nokay so the question is like close your\neyes right now\nokay and notice yes okay [ __ ] okay\nnotice your thoughts\nand notice that there's a noticing\ncapacity and then there are thoughts\nsure right and so now like the next time\nyou take an edible i'm not saying that\nyou should use drugs but if you use\ndrugs yeah try to see\nwhat the difference between those two\nthings is and see what it is that has\nchanged within you\nyes and and this is where what you'll\nreally discover is like this gets like\nsuper deep into [ __ ] like the self right\nwhat is it that's you\nyou're ludwig you have facial hair right\nnow\ni do i haven't shaved and there was a\nludwig that existed before you had\nfacial hair\nis that still ludwig\nyes so how do you know who ludwig is\nbecause it's not your physical form if\nyou lost a hand would you still be\nludwig\ni think it's uh\nhow i interact with the world\nbased off of my previous experiences\nokay so this is stuff that you should\nexplore but essentially what the yogis\nconcluded is that you think about\nanything that you use to define ludwig\nincluding your name\nand that's not really who you are yeah\nbecause you could say ludwig is a twitch\nstreamer and but you were\nludwig before you were a twitch streamer\nyou're gonna be ludwig after your twitch\nstreamer\nyeah ludwig is single like so if we look\nat in cells like in cells identify\nwith the concept of being in cell and\nthen one day they get a girlfriend like\nwhat happens do they\nare they shattered so this thing that we\ncall identity this is a hamkar ego the i\nfeeling\nor identity is all false and the yogis\nrealize that the only thing that truly\nexists\nis this consciousness that your mind\nchanges your emotions change\nyour bodies change your status and life\nchanges and therefore\nall of these things cannot be real so\nmatter can change but at the end of the\nday there's like a finite amount of\nmatter in the universe there's a finite\namount of energy in the universe and\nthere's a finite amount of this third\nthing called consciousness\nand the essence of who you are still\nexists\nno matter what kind of change you go\nthrough\nand so now we get to death because what\nhappens to that essence\nwhen you die\nis death a physical thing\nis it a mental thing both right\nsure is it a thing of but what we're\nsaying is that there's a consciousness\nthere is a ludwig essence yeah that\n[Music]\ntranscends your body and your mind\nbecause your body and your mind change\nall the time but there's a certain\nconstant blood weakness\nand that is your consciousness yeah so\nwhat the yogis would claim\nactually and this claim is based on\npractice\nso what they claim is that that\nludwigness\nis like always going to be there just\nlike\nmatter is always going to be there and\nenergy is always going to be there\nit can change form but there is a\ncertain amount of\npermanence of stuff in the universe\nwhich is actually like scientifically\nsupported right so\nlike we know that matter and energy\ncan't be destroyed and so now the real\nquestion is is this\ndo we have scientific evidence of this\nthird thing and the short answer is\nnot really but maybe and this is where\nyou get into hokey stuff around quantum\nmechanics which\none of my friends a lot of people like\ndraw parallels between like yoga and\nlike these\neastern mystics and quantum mechanics\nand i have a friend who's a quantum\nphysicist who's like\nthat shit's [ __ ] quantum mechanics\nis about math it's not about like yoga\nhippies saying that like\nyou know whatever we can get into that\nif you want to so now going back to your\noriginal question of like what happens\nafter death\nand why do you think this question is\nimportant to you\nbecause i'm gonna die and everyone i\nknow will\nso you know i'd like to know like if a\nfriend moves to europe i'd like to know\nif they're okay and they're doing well\nis it about your dad for sure\nyeah right yeah so you want to know\neverything i mean every everybody right\nyes everyone but i think for you like\nlet's admit it and i think your mind\ndeviates away from this right because\nyour mind focuses on the positive\nyeah but you want to know if your dad is\ndoing okay yeah\nthat's it right yeah sure all this other\n[ __ ] is philosophical\nthat's the way that your mind cloaks\nsomething negative\nin something positive if you don't look\nat the badness and like you want to know\nlike is my dad doing okay and it's okay\nto\nask that right this is where now we get\nto the subtle layers of where you need\nto grow\nit's okay to sit with that thought and\nlike not\nknow you don't have to think about your\nfriends and what's gonna happen to you\nit's okay to like\nnot know and sit with that negativity it\ndoesn't mean that you're molding and\nthis is where\nmolding is within the mind the more you\nbecome conscious and now we come full\ncircle\nbecause what i'm saying is that as you\ngain in consciousness\nyou don't need to wait positive greater\nthan negative\neverything is what it is right so like\nyou used to be\ntrapped in this idea of like oh my god\ni'm not gonna get enough viewers i'm not\ngonna get enough viewers\nnothing changed when you became more\nconscious\nyou were just like i just can't control\nthat [ __ ] whatever i'll get viewers i\nwon't get viewers\ni know analytics i've done my homework\ni've studied for the test i can't\ncontrol where i\nwhether i get an a but i can be\nconfident in the work that i have done\nyeah i like that analogy right\nand that's that's consciousness so then\nsuddenly if i had asked ludwig before\nyour realization and after\nyour realization ludwig\nhold on let me think about this i just\nlost it because it's trying to tie so\nmany\nthreads together\n[ __ ] i had something oh yeah so\nso prior to your realization negativity\nmeant more to you even though your\nsituation doesn't change\nyour mind was like more like nothing\nchanged after your realization right\nlike\nall of the bleak things that you were\nworried about are still exactly the same\ndoes that make sense yeah that's true\nand so\nthe negativity was born of your mind it\nwasn't actually born of reality and when\nyou become more conscious\nthat negativity that all of the all of\nthose things that you were struggling\nwith were just as true\nalthough they feel less negative you\nwith me\nyeah i'm with you and so as\nconsciousness grows the difference\nbetween positivity and negativity starts\nto shrink\nand now we get to where you need to grow\nbecause your mind focuses on the\npositive instead of focusing on the\nnegative\nwhich is absolutely adaptive the next\nstep\nis to recognize that you don't need to\ndo that anymore because there's no\ndifference\nright [ __ ] happens so be it i don't have\nto look away from it\nyeah yeah i feel that\nsometimes i do think about the negative\nsometimes then though when i think about\nthe negative i feel like i'm thinking\nabout it in a performative way like i\nneed to think about this\nyep which is also a weird experience\num like even like just by myself so\nyeah so that's why it there's a lot of\nreasons why\nit feels weird to think about the\nnegative i think\nyep and so the key thing is going to be\nthat you don't\nas you grow in consciousness you don't\nneed to focus on the positive anymore\nokay and you can sit with both things\nyou can be grateful that you got a car\nbut for [ __ ] sake man\nyour dad died when you were 10 yeah and\nyou're allowed to be upset about that\nlike what the [ __ ]\nyeah right you're allowed to like you're\nentitled to a little bit of like\nsag and pity and compassion from other\npeople\nand it doesn't change the two are\ncompletely unrelated like\nlike how the [ __ ] just look at that it's\nabsurd that your mind has an equation\nwhere the death of your dad in a car or\nlike\none to one it's more one to one just the\nfact that your mind even associates\nthose two things is like [ __ ] dumb\nokay sure okay right yeah that's\nnot wrong and so that's that's how\nyou've that's how you've grown and\nthat's how you've adapted and it's like\nawesome that you have gratitude for life\nit's awesome that you're compassionate\nit's awesome that you put other people\nfirst\nit's awesome that you try to make people\nlaugh\nand are you a positive person yes but\nbeing a positive person doesn't mean\nthat you're not entitled to like some\namount of grief\nand some amount of like that sucks for\nme\nyeah right and so like learning to sit\nwith it is gonna happen the more like so\nthe more you try to learn how to sit\nwith it the more conscious you will\nbecome\nthe more conscious you become the more\nyou will be able to sit with it\nokay so the advantage of sitting with\nnegative thoughts and emotions\nis that i'll become more conscious\nideally yes\nbecause sitting with it is not reacting\nto it the even the phrase sitting with\nit implies that the consciousness is\nthere\nso the opposite of sitting with it is\ngetting wrapped up in it\nand if you talk about getting wrapped up\nin it then we're kind of stuck where\nwe're\nwalking around in the fogginess of our\nmind where our mind is telling us all\nkinds of things and we think that and\nthis is wild\njust think about this for a second you\nthink your thoughts are true\nyeah which is the dumbest [ __ ] thing\nin the world because like what is a\nthought\nchatting uh yeah that's a good point\nthat's a good right\nbut when we get caught up in our mind\nit's like i can think about\nyou know i'm gonna make a paladin who's\na half orc half unicorn that's a [ __ ]\nthought it has no bearing on reality\nyeah like that's gonna be my next dd\ncharacter\nyou've thought it up already it doesn't\nmake it real\nlike it's just thought yes\ni yeah i've always thought i guess it's\nnot real until it's actualized\nyou know yeah but then we get down to\nthe whole rack of the road of dreams and\n[ __ ] right so then like ultimately yeah\nyou know yeah so is that is a dream real\nbecause you certainly experience it\nso if dreams didn't exist for sure\nnothing happens after we die\nbecause if dreams didn't exist we'd have\nno qualitative evidence\nthat anything but nothing\nis uh certain after death right like i\nfeel like dreams are the one\nwrench in the science community's\nbeliefs\non death no because the science\ncommunity's beliefs on death will just\nbe that dreams are just figments of the\nlike they're very materialistic in their\nview yeah\nthey just say that like dreams are a\ncreation of the brain\nwhereas the way that i talk about it is\nlike just because you see the sign\nof something reflected in something else\ndoes not mean that that is all there is\nso what i mean by that is let's say i\nhave a sheet hanging in the wind\nand all i see is the movement of the\nsheet and therefore i conclude that the\nwind doesn't exist and all that exists\nis the sheet\nbecause it's all that i observe it's the\nonly thing that i can see it's the only\nthing that i can touch\nbut the wind exists outside of the sheet\nand ripples into the physical world on\nthe sheet\nso in the same way just because the\nbrain is a physical ripple\nof experience doesn't mean that the\nbrain is the only thing that exists\nyes i don't know if that's going to make\nsense or not i think that analogy caught\non for me yeah\nyeah right so it's just the brain is\nsimply like the physical reflection\nof certain things that happen and we're\nfalling into a really tricky trap\nbecause just because we can observe the\nbrain and we can't\nactually it's not a tricky trap it's\njust how science works we just don't\nhave any direct ways to observe\nconsciousness yet\nand so all we can see is the brain so\nthat's all we think exists\ndo you think that's okay though that we\ndon't sure i think it's the way that\nscience works\nright so this has been around huh\nthey've been around like no one's done\nit you know what i mean like observed it\nin a\nyeah so so that gets into the problem of\nthe observed and the observe\nthat the observer and the observed can't\nbe the same thing\nyeah right so this is where this is\nwhere the hokie quantum mechanics stuff\nkind of comes in because some people\nbelieve like there's this thought\nexperiment called schrodinger's cat are\nyou familiar with that\nyeah yeah of course so like the thing\nwith schrodinger's cat is that\nreality doesn't actually exist reality\nis just sort of this weird wave form of\nprobabilities\nand that matter is like coalesces into\nreality through the act of observation\nwhich is [ __ ] wild because the yogis\nfor thousands of years\nhave been saying that the most\nfundamental thing that exists is the act\nof observation\nyeah right and so this is where the the\ncounter argument to that if you're a\nphysics is you can say whatever you want\nto with real language\nbut unless there's math to back it up\nyou don't know what the [ __ ] you're\ntalking about\nwhich is you know fair yeah\nhas a yogi or anyone ever gone\nin to the wake up mode um enlightenment\nand then just and then just\nnever came back to their body because i\nfeel like that\nwould be a a good observation\nof it being real does that make sense he\nhas not come back to their body but then\nhow would you know then if they had\ngained enlightenment because then it was\nit was like they self-actualized leaving\nthe body like if i said\nhey i'm a dip now i'm going to let my\nbrain leave\nand then my body never comes back and i\ncalled my own shots\nyeah so so this is the short answer is\nyes\nlots of people but i sort of have\nskepticism over that\nso a lot what a lot of people will so\nthis is where like people in\nreligious traditions ramakrishna you can\nlook him up on wikipedia\nit's just the first person that comes to\nmy mind who sort of did this and he's\nlike i'm a peace out now\ni'm done you call this shot yeah and\nthen everyone was around and then he\njust never came back\nyep that's insane i think it happens a\nlot so this is also where i think what\nhappens is religious traditions\nsay that that's what their spiritual\nmaster does when they just die\nyeah okay so i'm a skeptic by by nature\nso ultimately ludwig so that has people\nhave called their shots absolutely\nultimately this is what i'm going to\ntell you if you want to understand what\nhappens with death\nstep number one is like just experience\nit\nand i don't mean commit suicide so i\ndon't think you should commit suicide\nbut what what i what i mean by that is\nlike there are certain meditations that\nyou can do\nto like recall your past lives and so\nthat [ __ ] is just it's hard to describe\nbut it's just\nwild it's like the best thing that i can\nthat's what i can use wonderful so\nbasically you have\nmemories of your past right yeah\nso so like there's some meditation\ntechniques that you can do where you\njust like\nhave memories of your past except\nthey're just not\nthis life yeah it's like you remember\nlike this thing that you used to do with\nyour dad where you guys used to do the\nshower race\nyeah it's like you know you just have a\nmemory where like you and your dad used\nto like\nyou know put horse horseshoes on a horse\nand you're like oh [ __ ] i was a girl\nback then and i just it's just\nit's the same quality of memory and then\nyou're like whoa that's [ __ ] weird i\nhave\nthis whole like pile of memories sitting\nin my hard drive\nthat i just don't that now i remember\neven though\nand it just it's weird it like really\ncauses you to question because\nyou've got this whole consistent memory\nbank but it's just not from this life\nand then like then how do you reconcile\nthat\ndo you call it fantasy but it feels so\nconsistent\nand it's so like longitudinal\nand and this is where like i've seen\nthis in [ __ ] weird ways okay so like\ni had this one patient who had like\nreally bad ptsd except\nshe had never had a trauma she went to\nlike a bunch of psychiatrists\nand this is weird like i i'm i'm the\nfirst one to say like i don't know what\nthe [ __ ] to make of this\nexcept it's happened she went to a lot\nof psychiatrists and wound up with me\nbecause\nyou know she was interested in holistic\npsychiatry like meditation oh my god\nso we like did that [ __ ] for a while and\nit wasn't really helping and then like\ni kind of asked her i was like you know\nso it seems like you've got all the\nfeatures of ptsd\nbut like there's no trauma like we dug\nand dug and dug and dug and dug\ncouldn't find any trauma in her life and\nit's like what the [ __ ] so then one day\nwe were just like kind of talking i was\nlike\ndid you get traumatized in a past life\nand she was like yes\nand i was like tell me about that and\nthen she just started telling me all\nthis [ __ ]\nthat didn't happen to her and i [ __ ] you\nnot she got sexually abused by a cult\nleader in a past life\nand then like the second we figured that\nout i know it sounds weird it's [ __ ]\nweird it didn't happen to her it's not\nreal\nbut from a clinical perspective once we\ndid therapy over that trauma\nshe got better and as a scientist i have\nno idea\nhow to understand that yeah\nso this is like the best i can come up\nwith is maybe she saw like a movie\nwhen she was a kid and she thought it\nwas her and that was traumatic\nbut that just sounds like a stretch\nright like\nyeah i mean people i would just\nmark it off as loony yeah absolutely\nso she's off her rocker i'm off her\nrocker i sure as hell i'm not scientific\nyou know because that doesn't bear in\nreality but as a clinician\nlike what do you do when you do therapy\nfor memories that don't exist\nand a patient gets better like how do\nyou understand that like the clinical\nresult\nis absolutely real i don't know\ni really don't know\nyeah and this this happens occasionally\nyou'll get people who like you know\nhypnotize and like it's like really bad\nscience like really\nkind of hokey [ __ ] i don't trust most of\nit i wouldn't trust myself like\nit's not a technique that i employ on a\nregular basis it's like because i don't\nknow what the [ __ ] happened there i mean\nmaybe she's delusional maybe i'm\ndelusional\nmaybe i implanted something or steered\nher in a certain way i have no idea\nyeah anyway that's earnest\nyeah so questions thoughts\num i think my current thoughts\nare uh to sit with negative emotions\nand then the rest of it kind of sounds\nlike the avatar state\nwhich i don't think i can do at this\npoint but seems cool\nyeah i'm gonna teach you two practices\ni'm down i'm just so you know let me\njust say this i gotta dip in about\ni would say about like five minutes\nthat's totally fine practices are gonna\nbe short\nperfect so first practice\ni'm going to teach you step one and it's\ngoing to be sort of the same as step two\nokay i want you to sit in the moment\nbetween inhalation and exhalation\nbut don't hold your breath\nokay okay i'm manually breathing now\nthough\nyep so notice the inhalation\nnotice the exhalation don't pause in\nbetween\nbut there is a space where between\ninhalation and acceleration must exist\nit does exist i can't tell if i've\nmanually made it longer or\nslower or faster you know yep so just\nsit in that space\nhelps with your eyes closed we're going\nto do this for about 60 seconds\nokay come back to us what was that like\nfor you\nbreathing out is way easier\nokay were you able to even find any\ninkling of the space between the two\nyeah i think in a way i don't know it\nfelt like i'm like a mario party mini\ngame\nyep and i was good you know i was i was\nthinking about that great way to\ndescribe it\nyeah that's how it felt okay wow that's\nthe best description of meditation i've\never heard now that i thought about it\nso here's the next thing okay so this is\ngoing to be practice\nfor the real technique okay catch the\nmoment of sleep\nso there is a moment where you were\nawake\nand then there is a moment that you were\nasleep yeah right\nyeah sit in the in between space\nbetween wakefulness and sleeping okay\nand and come back out or just try to sit\nthere sit there baby\ndon't be asleep and don't be awake i\ncatch the moment a lot actually because\nthe way i sleep is with my head hanging\noff the bed and i have my phone and i\nusually have a stream open\nand the moment i'll fall to sleep i'll\nlet go of the phone\nand so i'll catch myself in that moment\na lot right before i fall asleep\nbecause the phone will fall out of my\nhands stay there\nyeah stay there as long as you can\nokay okay and and this is where it's\ninteresting because\nthere's another conversation for another\nday about your karma and how you were\nmeant\nfor this okay that you are halfway on\nthis road baby you're already halfway\nthere i'm just gonna give you a couple\nof techniques\nto help you go the rest of the way if\nthe techniques don't work you're going\nto get there the rest of the way on your\nown\nokay okay\nand then once once you do those for a\nwhile then we'll give you a technique\nspecifically on death\nbut in that transition period when your\nmind\nit's anyway i won't say anymore but just\ndo it for a while and check back with me\nin a couple months if we ever meet at\ntwitchcon or something i'll teach you\nsomething in person\nsounds good that sounds lovely thanks
