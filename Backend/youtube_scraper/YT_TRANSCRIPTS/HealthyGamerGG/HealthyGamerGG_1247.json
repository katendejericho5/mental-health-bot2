    "transcript": "all right so let's jump into questions\nhi dr k i'm a student and ever since the\ncovid quarantine\nand zoom school started happening i\nstarted slacking at school i'm having a\nhard time listening in class i'm also\nhaving a hard time doing homework\nwhen i try to do homework or listen i\nget doubts in myself and i'm playing get\ngames instead of facing things and\ndealing with them\ni'm also never submit projects and\nalmost never get a good score and i know\ni can do better but i find it\nfrustrating instead\nof helping how do i deal with it how do\ni focus on zoom and start to do homework\nthanks in advance okay this is a great\nquestion\num and a little bit unfortunate so\nhere's the thing so i\num so i work with a lot of students\nand the sad truth is that covid makes\nschool way\nharder so the first thing that i want\nyou guys to do the\nfirst thing you have to do is cut\nyourself some slack\nokay that's number one like school is\njust\nharder during covid like gpas are\ndropping across the board\nthe number of patients that i've had to\nwrite so\ndepression is like 300 worse the number\nof letters that i've had to write to\nstudents\ngiving them like medical excuses to\nwithdraw from the semester\nhas been like i've written more letters\nin the last\nsix months than i have in the last six\nyears\num so the simple truth is that school is\nharder\nokay so we're not\nthe school curriculum is not designed to\nbe delivered over zoom\nthere are a lot of problems with the\nschool curriculum but just how we do\nschool in general\num like for example we have you know\npeople going to individual lectures when\nyou have these resources like khan\nacademy that are just better than like\n99\nof math teachers out there so i don't\nknow why we're paying all these math\nteachers to\nyou know teach math when you can just\nwatch khan academy which is what a lot\nof students do nowadays you see this in\nmedicine too where everyone like\nyou have all these lectures from these\nprofessors that are boring\num and then you've got these people like\nyou know pathoma or hussein satar or\nfirst aid or like these other like\nbrilliant lecturers who just\nexplain things so well and i don't know\nwhy we don't just have\neducation being like this is the cool\nthing about the internet right\nis that you actually now have access to\nthe best teachers in the world\ni don't know why we're not having those\npeople teach all of our classes to\neveryone\nanyway i have a whole rant on the\neducation system that i'll do one day\num and how it's outdated but anyway so\nthe first thing to understand is that\nlike school is not designed for\nzoom so it's gonna be tough okay so give\nyourself a little bit of slack\nbut if we kind of look at this what we\nsee is i know i can do better but i find\nit frustrated instead of helping\nso this is the so not only is it hard\nbut\nthis person is beating themselves up for\nnot doing a good job\nso this is the second thing that you\nguys need to understand is anytime you\nface a challenge in life you got to be\ncareful\nthat you don't kick yourself while\nyou're down\nright so like life knocks you down and\nthen your mind steps in is like oh\nyou're so dumb why are you failing\nand then you beat yourself up and you\nkick yourself while you're down like\ndon't do that\nbe compassionate towards yourself okay\ngotta be careful\nhelp yourself up instead of kicking\nyourself while you're down\ngot it so step number one recognize that\nschool is not designed to be delivered\nover zoom the only way they can keep you\npaying attention for an\nhour in a boring ass lecture is to have\nyour ass\nin a seat where if you fall asleep or\ndon't pay attention\nyou will be publicly shamed and\nhumiliated that doesn't happen as easily\nover zoom\nso like that just think about the school\nsystem\nthat requires that thing to be there in\norder for you to pay attention like\nthat's a\npoorly designed system anytime i give a\nlecture i give a lecture\nlast week anytime i give a lecture the\nfirst thing that i say\nto everyone so this is what some\nprofessors say they'll say everyone put\naway your laptops because it's lecture\ntime\nthis is what i say i say everyone take\nout your laptops\neveryone open up your favorite shopping\nwebsite\nsports forum news website i want you\nguys to open up\nyoutube whatever you want open up the\nmost distracting website that you\nenjoyed\nkilling time with on the internet and i\nwant you to start engaging with that\nwebsite and i'm going to start talking\nit is my job as a professor to restrain\nyour attention\neveryone open up shopping everyone shop\nonline and now i'm gonna start lecturing\nand if i am not engaging or interesting\nenough or relevant enough\nthen you shouldn't be listening to me\nanyway if you're not learning anything\nyou might as well shop online like who\nthe [ __ ] cares\nokay okay so back to shahar\nso school is not designed for zoom so\nyou just gotta kind of think about that\nokay second thing is you got to be\ncareful about beating yourself up\nbecause the deck is stacked against you\nright now you're playing the game on\nhard mode so you can't\nbeat yourself up for like wiping a\ncouple of times okay\nvery practically because that's not\nhelping it doesn't help you learn it\ndoesn't help you get motivated when you\nbeat yourself up okay\nnext thing is that try your best to set\naside\na workspace from like a compute like a\nplaying space okay\nso this can mean so when i was in med\nschool i you know i had one laptop\nright so i would play games on the\nlaptop and i would study on the laptop\nbut literally what i did is i had like\ntwo cheap ass desks and i had them right\nnext to each other and literally what i\nwould do is pick up my laptop\nand move from one desk to another when i\nwas ready to work and then i would pick\nup my laptop and i'd move the same\nlaptop like\ntwo feet away when it was time to game\nand so try to set up an environment that\nyou only do work in\nthat you only like when you go to class\nlike as best as you can go to like a\nschool room or a different place or like\ni don't know exactly what it is\nit may be as simple as if you only have\none desk like i have a folding desk like\nyou know\nthese picnic table 10 desks and\nand like even if it's like shifting my\nchair like i don't know if you guys can\nsee this but\num you know so this is like this is my\ndesk\nokay and like this is where i work so\nwhen i'm doing my writing\ni have like papers and stuff over there\nall right and like i just shift over a\nfew feet\nlet me just screw up my camera but\nhopefully that'll be okay\nso i still do this where i have like a\nlong desk and i'll move it over i'll\nlike\nscoop my chair i'll wheel over here when\ni'm doing like my writing with like a\npen\nokay so control your environment and\nonly do schoolwork in one place\nanother thing you can do is if you have\nincense you can always light incense\nlike at the beginning of the day\nor anytime you're doing school work or\nnot anytime because\nhopefully you're not liking like instead\nit's like 15 times a day but\nyou know so you can use scent as well to\nanchor yourself when you work so this is\nwhere\nonce again so i have some himalayan sage\nhere which when i'm having\ntrouble working a light and it kind of\ngets me in the mood\nto study and i only light it when i'm\nstuck like doing work\nokay so that's control your environment\nall right so that's the second thing\nthe third thing when i try to do\nhomework a listen i get doubts in myself\nand i'm playing games instead of facing\nthings and dealing with them okay so\nthis\nalso this has nothing to do with\nstudying bro\ni'm assuming your dude when i try to do\nhomework or listen i get doubts in\nmyself and i'm playing games instead of\nfacing these challenges and dealing with\nthem\nso that's like that's something you've\ngot to work through right that has\nnothing to do with school\nso i mean working through that stuff\nthat's where you can see a therapist\nyou know if it's a kind of clinical\nthing you can do things like journaling\nor like go on a hike and just like face\nthings\nthis is a great example of um the\nstaring at a wall exercise that\none of one of our coaching clients came\nup with\nso like one of my clients came up with\nthis exercise\nand he was like i just sat in front of a\nwall and i stared at it and it was like\none of the hardest things i've ever done\nbecause then you've got nothing to\ndistract you from all the crap\nturns out that he's doing fantastic and\nit's an awesome exercise\nso you can face with things that also\nyou can get a coach right so this is\nwhat our coaches specialize in so i want\nyou guys to understand this\nour coaches are not mental health\nprofessionals they don't treat\ndepression or anxiety\nbut they help with things like this\nbecause this is what they've gone\nthrough right so they have doubts in\nthemselves they start to play games they\nhave fears about who they are\nand they've like faced them and i think\nfor the most part i think they're doing\npretty well in terms of overcoming them\ni almost never submit projects and\nalmost never get a good score okay\nso this is an outcome you can't really\ncontrol this right\nif you do everything up here right this\nwill change on its own you don't need to\nworry about this\nremember that you can't ever get a good\nscore on a test i know it sounds weird\ncan't get a good score on a test the\nmost you can do is study\nif you're super unlucky maybe all the\nthings that you didn't study happen to\nbe the questions on the test\nso you can't control what score you get\nall you can control\nis how much effort you put in i know it\nsounds weird so for this to change\nall of this has to change and if this\nchanges then this will change on its own\nyou don't need to worry about it um\nhow do i focus on zoom and start to do\nhomework yeah so like i said create a\nstudy space okay\nso hopefully that's it so let's think\nabout how to study during the pandemic\nnumber one acknowledge that school\nis not designed to be done in a pandemic\nour school curriculum is boring and\nnecessitates you being\nat a physical location away from\ndistractions in order for you to pay\nattention just\nthink about how terrible that is for a\nlearning environment\nbut that's what our school is built on\nit's built on\nliterally going to a place where you\ncan't do anything else\nbut listening to this boring crap for\neight hours a day\nthat's the way that's the foundation of\nschool it's in the word\nschool school is not an activity it's a\nplace but we talk about it like an\nactivity\nso school is not designed to be done\nduring quarantine so if you're\nstruggling during quarantine\nain't your fault it's because the\ncurriculum is awful and predicated on\nyou being in a boring location for eight\nhours a day\nthe only thing you can do is is like pay\nattention\nso ain't your fault people are doing\nwhat's no big deal\nokay so second tip don't beat yourself\nup for not doing a great job at school\nbecause that doesn't help\nat all right so like this is the\neffects of the pandemic it's really not\nyour fault\nand so you got to be really careful\nbecause what you need is your own\nsupport instead of kicking yourself\nwhile you're down\nnumber three try to recreate the\nenvironment that school\ncreates so set aside a separate space in\nyour house as best as you can\nwhere you do your work and you don't do\nanything there but work\nget yourself some himalayan sage light\nit purify that place with all that\nspiritual [ __ ] and chakras like go for\nit bro\nlike create a new scent so ascent is\nreally good at anchoring your brain to a\nparticular task\nso only like that like that every\nmorning when you sit down to study\nand only study there don't ever do don't\never play games in this separate space\nif you need to literally if you only\nhave a desktop i would say it is an\nawesome idea to unplug your desktop and\nmove it to a different place and then\nreplug it in\nand then on the weekend you move it back\nto your gaming zone\nand like that's where you game like put\ntogether your desktop like\nfive times a month great idea so create\na separate environment\nuse smell to anchor and do your work\nthere\nokay that's number one two and three\nnumber four\nis work with someone if you're\nstruggling either get a therapist or\nwork with one of our coaches both of\nthem work and work through some of these\nissues\nand recognize that the reason that you\nlike you know play games instead of\nfacing things you've got to face those\nthings and deal with them\nand as long as that's like rolling\naround in your head it's going to be\nreally hard to do work\nokay\nnew user account on pc that works too\nokay so people are saying build your own\nschool what do you guys think i'm doing\nwhat do you think healthy gamer is\nit's school for the mind bros that's\nwhat we're doing there's a lecture i'm\nlike literally giving a lecture\nthis is a lecture we call it a lecture\nthe [ __ ] it's not a cult it's a school\nit's like we're doing q a and i'm giving\na lecture look what\nthat's what we're doing we're building a\nnew kind of school given our\ntechnological\nadvances instead of using the old\nversion we don't want to go back to a\nbrick and mortar we want to use the\ninternet to teach people\nin an entertaining and meme friendly way\nto hold your attention\nokay and people think this is a cult\nlike that's crazy man\nschools should be like this schools\nshould be entertaining and fun\nand useful\nit's not a cult okay next question"
