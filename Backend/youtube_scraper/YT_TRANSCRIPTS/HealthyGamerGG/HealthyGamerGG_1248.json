    "transcript": "cool so welcome thank you\ni think someone asked me a loaded\nquestion about what i thought about\npolyamorous relationships i don't know\nif you heard my answer\nwait what was your answer my answer was\ni haven't seen many that are or i\nhaven't seen really any that are very\nsuccessful but there's a big selection\nbias because the people who tend to come\nto me tend to be unhappy with something\nright so all the happy people in\npolyamorous relationships probably never\nend\nwalk in my door i think i think it all\ndepends on what the relationship\nis like right like sure that too\nlike there's like tons of relationships\nthat are monogamous that don't work out\neither\nabsolutely yes i think it all depends on\nlike where the boundaries are and stuff\nlike that and like\ni mean i feel like there definitely has\nto be like more trust and stuff\nin an open or polyamorous relationship\nand\nyou need to like balance each other out\ni think yeah\nand if you don't yeah then it's gonna be\neven worse probably than a monogamous\nrelationship\ni think if there's like more of a\ndifference\nyeah i think that's a really good point\nthat a lot of monogamous relationships\nare [ __ ]\ni think i feel like most relationships\nare [ __ ] somehow\ni think every every relationship has\nsomething that is like not\nvery very wise words yeah\num but i mean if you ask people on the\ninternet especially like\ntwitch people on the internet maybe\ndon't really have a lot of experience\nwhen it comes to relationships so when\nthey see that there's something that is\nbad\nthey judge like everything like so hard\ntoo so\nyeah of course i don't think anyone is\nlike perfect do you feel like your\nrelationship is perfect\ngood god no no yeah and that's i am\ni don't think people know that there's a\nthing yeah yeah\nthank you for having me again yeah i\nthink\napril i think yes it was a while ago\nyeah so tell me how have you been\num it's been like it's been good and bad\num after our last talk\ni feel like it's been pretty good\nbecause i\num i built my whole twitch carrier since\nthen basically so that's pretty cool\num congratulations yeah thank you that\nwas\nyeah that was really nice it made me\nreally happy um i built like my own\ncommunity and everything so it was\nreally fun\ni've traveled around in europe and stuff\nand met friends and hung out with people\nand stuff\num the pandemic and the long distance\nrelationship thing went on for about 10\nmonths\nthat was really hard um\nyeah and i think especially recently\nmaybe like the past\nfour or five months has been pretty hard\nwith people breaking my trust\nokay and that's why i wanted to come\nhere now today\nokay four to five months of people\nbreaking your trust sounds like a long\ntime\nyeah i mean it's been it's been longer\nthan that it's just like the past five\nmonths has been like\nalmost every single person almost\nuh that i'm really really close friends\nwith that's\nterrible yeah\nwhat happened and i think i mean there's\ni don't know i i just feel like\num\ni just i feel like there's so many\npeople that i like that come like very\nvery close and i'm like a very open\nlike happy person that wants to let\npeople in i just want to have fun and\nstuff like that\nbut whenever there's like something that\nthey're not getting in their way of\nor um when they feel like they can get\nsomething out of me\nthey don't give a [ __ ] about how i feel\nanymore and they do something\nand yeah i don't know i don't i don't\nreally understand like why they're doing\nthe things that they're doing and it's\nit's like almost every single one\neven people that i consider in my best\nfriends would do something really really\nterrible\nso let me just make sure i kind of\nunderstood you so it seems like you know\nyou tend to\nbe pretty open you let people into your\nlife\num and that you've noticed recently that\npeople\nif they can kind of get ahead in some\nway they'll take advantage of your\nopenness\nyeah and then like it it can\ni don't know it just kind of like feels\nlike they don't give a [ __ ] and like and\nwhen i\nwhen i call them out on it or just\nlike explain like this like this really\n[ __ ] hurts\nthey usually just wanna like blame it on\nme or something or just say that i\nshould just take it and that i shouldn't\nbe sad about it and\nand and like there's some cases where i\ndecide to just cut them off\nand i just can't because it's too much\nand i just feel like i don't want to be\naround these people anymore because it\nhurts so much\nand then they're the ones that's like\nalways like messaging\nand it's like trying i don't know\nto like make me feel bad about how i'm\nfeeling maybe a little bit and then\num it feels like everyone is like acting\nvery selfish\nand that they have they just like oh\nyeah whatever like it's like that a\nlittle bit about like how i feel about\nthings um or that they just don't give a\n[ __ ]\num i had a person i think\na lot of people like that's watching\nlike knows what happened recently\nbut um i think the thing that hurts the\nmost from that situation was that i had\na person that i consider my best friend\num\njust leaking logs of my deepest darkest\nthoughts\nto the whole world and\nthis is sounds like a pretty big\nviolation of your trust\nyeah um\nwhy would they do that i i don't know\nthat's i try to catch a question myself\nif there if there's something i'm doing\nwrong\nwell you know that's an interesting\nquestion because um\nso i'm not really hearing anything yet\nbut one thing that i have noticed molina\nis that you know sometimes people will\nsay\neveryone does this to me or there are a\nlot of different people who do this to\nme\nand sometimes i kind of think a little\nbit about\nif there's a common conflict that you\nhave in multiple relationships\nit's really important to think about\nyour contribution to that conflict\nbecause the common element\nthat's what i'm trying to do like the\nmuslims if all of these people are doing\nthis and like i am the common like\naspect about everything that has to do\nwith me right um\nyeah unfortunately sometimes that's true\nyeah and figure that out\nyeah so so like i'll give you just one\nexample of that okay so\neven then it's not necessarily that it's\nyour fault\nbut like um you know i've worked with\nwomen who end up in\nand men so let's use an example of a man\ni'm thinking about one person in\nparticular\nwho tends to end up in toxic and abusive\nrelationships like he gets into like\ntoxic and abusive relation girlfriend\nafter girlfriend after girlfriend\nand um and you know they'll they'll be\nlike\nlike he'll like his last three\ngirlfriends have like physically abused\nhim\nand so he's like is it something i'm\ndoing and it sort of turns out that\nearly on\num in in terms of like the way he meets\npeople and who he feels it's just\ninteresting because he's kind of like a\nmacho kind of guy he actually sort of\nselects for partners\nwho sort of have those kind of abusive\ncharacteristics\nand he actually feels like really really\nlike frightened and confused when he's\nlike dating someone who's like caring\num and and so sometimes it can be\nsomething as simple as like the kinds of\npeople that you choose to associate with\num and and you know because sometimes\npeople will like\nkind of hang out with drama-oriented\npeople and\nif you hang out with drama-oriented\npeople you may find drama\nyeah but i i do think it's\nit's it can be challenging but i also\nthink it's like really\nawesome that you're thinking about your\ncontribution to these situations\nyeah i just kind of like i cannot i\ndon't know\ncan you help me understand a little bit\nabout you know what's happened recently\nand\nand how it's affected you um\nbasically what happened is that i i got\na friend named bob\ni about in april as we start talking\num i kind of didn't\nopen up to anyone about anything almost\nfor a pretty long time because i felt\nlike if i wanted\nif i started to like vent to people that\nwould um\ncause problems um\nor like everything when i get dramatics\ni didn't say anything or talk to anyone\nabout anything and that could feel\npretty hard to like if you're not if you\ndon't have like a friend to vent to or\nsomething like that because i\nbecause i didn't i didn't want to like\nmake anyone look bad or anything like\nthat\num and then i think in october\nor something like that like we started\nbecoming like closer friends\nand then i started um i\nwent into some dark phase when i just\ndidn't\nyeah i don't know you know like when you\nstart feeling so bad you almost have\nlike no control of yourself and it feels\nlike your\nbody is like an autopilot and you yeah\nand that was like the only person that i\never like told all of my thoughts\nto and um\nwhat happened a few weeks after that was\nthat\nbob told one of steven's close friends\nall of the stuff that i told him which\nwas really hard for steven's friend\nbecause they were friends and she felt\nworried about\nme and felt worried about stephen about\nour relationship because it was pretty\ncrazy stuff\num so she she thought she was like\nsuper super against me she was super\nagainst that relationship\ni felt super super betrayed and wait\nabout one huh i'm confused why would\nthis person feel against\nit sounds like this person is friends\nwith even his destiny by the way\nyeah and so this person was afraid of\nhow your thoughts would affect y'all's\nrelationship i'm\na little bit confused and like thought\nlike badly of him and thought badly of\nme and everything was just so crazy and\nyeah i'm okay i'm i\njust lost me just he basically just told\nthis person\nall of this like all of my deepest\ndarkest\nsecrets and just like everything which\nwas also like a lot of problems in\nmine and siemens relationship and that\ncomes from like\nbeing away from each other for 10 months\num\na lot of like things that i went through\nat the time and like things that he went\nthrough so there was like a lot of\nthings that was like\nnot meant for like other people to hear\nabout and especially not stephen's\nfriends\num so that really really sucked and i\nfelt like i\ni just questioned like why did you do\nthat and\nyeah this person can like change his\nanswers all the time and says that\nhe did it because he was worried about\nme and that he wanted to vent to someone\nelse about my problems with someone so\nhe could help me\nthen he also said that the other person\nwas in the dark about everything was\nworried about\nthat friend being stephen's friend and\nthen\nor and also like that he just didn't\ngive a [ __ ] about me basically so\nthere's like a lot of different\num he said that he doesn't give a [ __ ]\nabout you yeah or that he\njust it didn't really matter i don't\nreally see the problem with telling your\nsecrets to other people\nlike just like that and i don't see the\nproblem\nhe's just saying that he doesn't see the\nproblem in that so it's like okay\num so it sounds like you're getting a\nlot of different answers\nyeah yeah yeah for sure just so i\nunderstand so it sounds like maybe it\nwas\nhard for this person to sit with all of\nthe\nemotional weight of what you were\nconfiding in him and he needed to\nconfide in someone else yeah but he's\nalso saying that he told this person\nbecause he felt worried about her\nfor being stephen's friend because\nstephen is a psychopath or whatever so\nit's just like really\na lot of really really crazy stuff i\ndon't know a lot of work\ni have so many questions about so much\nabout what you've said\nthe most shocking point is because you\nknow stephen is a psychopath\nwhat does that mean like people are\npeople are always gonna think that just\nbecause he doesn't\nlike cry on stream and like show a lot\nof emotions and stuff like that and he\nhe talks very cold and stuff like that\npeople don't think actually even\nis an emotional guy but she is but no\none really sees that and\nsure people just treat him like [ __ ]\nbecause of it\num and just doesn't give a [ __ ]\nbasically\nbut no none of these people really know\nhim um\nbut yeah but that's basically what\nhappened i felt\nreally really sad i felt really sad for\nabout two weeks after this happened\num until this guy bob convinced me that\nyeah he wasn't\nhe didn't mean to and he wanted to keep\nme as a friend and that he didn't want\nme to cut him off and stuff like that\nand then it went on with like two how\ndid you feel when he said that\num\nhe kind of showed like a different side\nof himself a little bit\nthat's the thing like he always was like\nwhat are you called like a joker he was\nlike almost like\nhe was always like joking around and\nlike he we never really\nlike that was the thing like why i like\ntalking to him was because he was very\nneutral\nand then he would like joke things away\na little bit instead of like making\nit really serious and that would kind of\nlike make me see the humoring thing\nit was really hard for me to talk to him\nyeah but this time\nhe was like begging me to like not leave\nhim as a friend and that he really cared\nabout me you know he was like\nand i've never heard him say anything\nlike that before so for me that felt\nvery genuine i guess or it took me\nlike it took a heart i don't know it\ntook it took a lot of it um\na lot of effort and a lot of like mental\neffort and stuff to um\nto get over that betrayal um\ndid you feel like you had to get over\nthat betrayal\nyeah because this was my best friend\nokay\ni feel like i didn't have any any best\nfriends or anything\nhe didn't have any best friends not\nnot really not really like in this world\nno like i moved away from\nmy friends and like i lived in sweden at\nthe time but a lot of my friends moved\naway from stockholm\num and like i didn't really have a\nfriend that was like super available\ni guess so like this was like a very\nimportant person i just came back\nto america and i don't really know\nanyone in l.a either\nyou know and like i didn't have anyone\nthat was that available and that i\nfelt like i had that connection with i\ndon't even know if that connection was\nreal\nthat was the thing because he lied about\nso many things\num what do you think about\nhe lied about like\nlet me think he um\neverything kind of like turned out this\nway was that there was like two months\nof him\nbasically telling me how bad\nrelationship i was in\nand stuff and i tried to like navigate\naway from that but everything was really\nhard because i felt like i didn't want\nto lose him as a friend and i didn't\nyou know want to be disrespectful to\nsteven it was like everything was like\npretty crazy\nand then like steven's friend that was a\nclose friend of his like didn't like me\nat all and she's like hated me because\nshe saw that i she felt like i wasn't\nrespecting him\neverything was like really insane um\nhe basically told a bunch of lies um\n[Music]\nand he uh it came out that he\ntalked also a so\nlike much behind my back like really\nreally badly\nlike a bunch of [ __ ] about my like about\nme behind my back\nand i've seen like logs of this as well\nso like while this was all going on he\nwas [ __ ] talking\nlike crazy to a lot of people so i don't\nthink this person was like real\ni think this person was i don't know i\nhave no idea like why\nor how it sounds like you're really\nconfused about what to believe about\nbob is it yeah yeah\nso seems like really conflicting\nyeah i i don't i have no idea i don't i\ndon't know i'm\ni i think he i have no idea i don't know\nmaybe he kind of just like give up on me\nor something but like letting like\neverything like go on and stuff it was\nlike really everything was like really\ncrazy\ni only found out about all this because\nme and that person\nor her name is bose she\nseems friend she came to the same kind\nof like convention kind of thing\nyeah that's her name okay um\nand i feel whenever i'm like around\npeople that i know has like a lot of\nreally\num bad opinions about me or there's like\na fight going on or something i never\nspoke to this person really before i've\nnever been in real life\num i get really weird and i get really\nuncomfortable\nand i need to confront so what i did was\nthat i\nin georgia confronted her and said hey i\nknow exactly everything you know like\nyou think about me\nbecause i got a huge like log sent from\nhim the day before\nwe're actually through another person\nyeah is everything is like really crazy\nbut yeah i got like\na lot of her saying a lot of really\nreally bad things about me and i\nconfronted her and then\nduring three hours we figured out that\nhe was full of [ __ ] basically\nso she felt really betrayed as well so i\nyeah this whole thing was like really\nreally insane and then\num why do you want to confront\ni just can't walk around people knowing\nthat they\nuh that they have like problems maybe i\ncan't do that i need to like confront\nthem and ask\nwhy why um\ni feel so bad it's better for me to\nalmost just like\ndo like just like confront them and like\nknow exactly what they\nwhat they think about me i just want to\nhave a straight conversation\ninstead of like hearing a bunch of stuff\nbehind my back about what this person\nthinks about me and like feel their\nenergy\ni can't do that i need to like hey i\nknow what you think about me\nlet's talk about it like i need to do\nthat okay so it sounds like you can sort\nof feel their\nmalice field of negative energy like\nthrough rumors and dms and so and so\nyeah you just need to cut through it and\nand just okay yeah i just have to i just\nhave to do it and then when we did we\nfigured out\nthere was like a lot of things that was\npretty crazy and\num we can't what happened was basically\nthat\nthere was there was other people that\nknew him as well and that knew me and\nher\nso we start talking to another person\nabout all this and that person told us\neven more things that he said to them\nand then we were like oh my god this\nperson is friends with this person as\nwell and i'm friends with this person\ni'm gonna ask this person\nand then it was just like a bunch of\npeople like figuring out like okay wait\nthis happened like\nthis is like all what's been said and\nstuff like that\nhow did it feel to go through that\num kind of that investigation and\nfiguring things out and piecing things\ntogether\nat the time when that happened this is\nreally scary\nwhat was scary i don't know it's like\nreally insane that like that all of that\nhappened that this was like a person\nthat i used to view in such a positive\nway\nand then we find out that there was like\na bunch of people that like that he\nbetrayed as well about like talking [ __ ]\nbehind their back and stuff and he did a\nvery\neverything everything was pretty crazy\nand then\num he kind of like already\nwent around to other people talking\nreally really badly about stephen as\nwell\nand steven knew about this like three\nmonths ago\nlike he figured out that this happened\nlike a long time ago\num especially with bose as well because\nhe talked\nso much to her um so he was really\nreally pissed\nand he felt like he didn't even know who\nthought what about\nanything anymore or like about him\nbecause he was\nrunning around saying so much stuff like\nthat wasn't true like lies\ntwisted truth it's like a lot of crazy\nstuff\nwill you pause for just a second i'd\nlike to just collect my thoughts and try\nto\ni just need a moment yeah sure\nthis sounds like drama to me yeah it is\ndramas it is\nit's very dramatic i mean you told me to\nexplain the situation\nso i'm explaining it yeah yeah yeah i i\nappreciate that\ni'm just just i'm struck by how\nmuch there's this person talk to this\nperson and this person talk to this\nperson and this\nlike like that sounds [ __ ] exhausting\nyeah i mean yeah i don't know i don't\neven know what excel\nlike being calls it is anymore because\nthat's what i feel all the time\nwhat's it like to be exhausted all the\ntime\nthat's hard to explain um\ni feel like two years ago when i wasn't\nstreaming on twitch and i was like not\ninvolved with all these people and stuff\nand i had like my\nmy life in new zealand or in sweden and\nstuff and everything was like very\nnormal i'd say\nit was of course like stuff that\nhappened sometimes\nbut i felt like it was like very easy\nfor me to like\njust disconnect thoughts and stuff and\njust focus on certain things and\njust relax and enjoy things it sounds\nlike it's really surrounding you\nnow like you can't escape from it yeah i\ncan't\nand even if i try to like\num like go work out or go for a run or\ngo for a walk or\njust like follows you around meditate i\ncan't\nit doesn't work i can't do it it's like\nall over\nlike all the time um and then it's like\neverything like upon that as well\nthere's like\nthere's like the stress about streaming\nand\nthe stress about staying in contact with\npeople the stress about\nthe relationships there's stress about\nthe world there's stress about um\nlike so many things you know and and\nthen i have all of these people this is\nlike\nnot just like this thing that happened\nthere's like other things that happens\naround that as well\nand there's people messaging me saying\nthat i am\nlike hurting them because i am not as\navailable as they want me to be\nand stuff like that too and i just feel\nlike i can't sit and like respond to\nmessages\nbecause it stresses me out so much and\nthen i hurt people because i'm not\ngiving them like what they feel like\nthey need out of me i guess\nso i'm like very exhausted yeah\nsounds like a lot of people\nmolina it feels to me like you're\ngetting sucked dry\nyeah i mean i think this is something we\ntalked a little bit about\nlast time but yeah i just like i just\nfeel like\ni'm absolutely going in the worst\ndirection possible at the moment i have\nno idea how to like\ncontrol better what to do and tell me\nabout that direction you're going in\nright now\nwhat makes it so bad um\ni'm just getting so hurt i'm getting so\nhurt over and over again\nand no one gives a [ __ ] that's what it\nfeels like like no one\nno one of these people like understands\nlike i had another i had another friend\nlike betraying me pretty hardcore\nby like really like telling me like you\ncould always come to me you could always\ntalk to me i would never do anything of\nthese things that you're so scared of\nhappening\nand then this person did exactly the\nthing that would would be the absolute\nworst for them to do\nwhat did they do i don't think it's well\ni don't think\ni shouldn't like okay\num but that really really sucks and then\nlike\nthat felt so bad that it just like i i\ndon't think this person ever cared about\nme i think this person was just really\nselfish and wanted me\nto think certain ways about them for\nthem to make it easier to get something\nelse\nand this person is like messaging me\ntrying to like\ni don't know i don't know if they're\ntrying to like make me feel bad\nabout anything because they're still\nlike so like defensive\nabout what they did and they're they're\nvery like but what about me and i'm like\nbut i wasn't the one i've\nlike done everything for you like i've\ndone all the like the the best things\nfor you because i cared you know that's\nwhat i felt\nand then this person just like did this\njust out of like\nwho takes care of you molina\nsounds like you spend a lot of time\ntaking care of other people who takes\ncare of you\ni think stephen king takes care of me\nsometimes like\ni don't think he really like takes care\ni think he cares like whenever we have a\nfight or something like that i think he\ncares about solving it but i think it's\nvery hard for him\nwhich is i understand like he's used the\nway he is but i mean whenever\nwhenever i um like if i would be upset\nabout something like my mom or something\nlike that\num like he would always like take care\nof me of course and like talk to me like\ni was sad yesterday\nbecause i just felt um\nlike all these things are like happening\nto me and i wonder if i deserve it\nbecause all of these like things are\nhappening and they're just\nlike if all of these people just decides\nto do like really horrible things to me\nthat\nmust mean that it feels that way it\ndoesn't sound very good when i say but\nit feels like i decided what does it\nfeel like\num and when they say no\ni feel very small then like very weak\nit sounds to me like you're kind of\ngetting taken advantage of\nyeah but i think i think\ni kind of like always felt that way i\nthink\nit's just that there's more people\nthat's able to do that at the moment\nmaybe i feel like there's more people\nthat's doing\nyeah it sounds like a lot of people are\nthe themes that i'm hearing or that\npeople betray your trust\npeople sort of don't look out for you\nyou know yeah\nthey rely on you for emotional support\nlike it feels like very one-way traffic\nthe way you're describing it\nyeah um\ni feel like it's always been like that a\nlot it's like um\num like my mom is that way she's always\nlike\never since i was a kid i've been her\nlike therapist since i was like seven\nyears old\ni remember yeah and\ni've always kind of like felt like i had\nto like\nyeah like step back a lot you know\nand just like take everyone's stuff but\ni don't\ni don't understand it maybe i'm like not\nshowing enough that i just can't take\nany more you know i don't know maybe\nit's just so how let's\nlet's talk about so let's like pick one\nparticular case and maybe dig into it by\nthe way if you want to explain more\nabout\num you know what's happened with bob and\nstuff recently i'm more than happy to\nlisten\num there was just so much significant\nstuff i felt like i had to kind of pause\nand\nit's like a crazy story it's like a\nmovie it's like very\ninsane like a lot of like really pieces\nand figuring things out and then the\npicture changing\nand yeah yeah a lot of and then like now\neverything is like\nreally weird too because there's like\nother streamers trying to like get us\nbe platformed because get us\nget you de-platformed or yeah like\ntrying to like get us banned from twitch\nlike that's how crazy what's your\nunderstanding of why\nother people what have you done that's\nworthy of being\nbanned from twitch in people's minds\num i have no idea i i have no idea why\nthey would want to try to do that i\nthink they probably just feel really bad\num i think they're really upset because\nthings turn out the way it did\nand they kind of like rewarded someone\nthat they probably regret supporting\nafter what came out after that\nbut why would they try to get you banned\nif they supported someone\nwho's probably because it feels good for\nthem\nright it probably feels good if you\nreally hate someone or if you're really\nupset with someone you probably wish to\nworship for them at the moment right\nso is there anything that that you can\nthink of that\nyou've done that would make someone\nthink\nso hatred is one reason that you want\nsomeone to be banned\nis there anything like what do they say\nlike what's their complaint\nas to why you should be banned\nmotivations aside\nlike to try to bring up stuff from the\npast stuff like that and just like try\nto like\nyeah it's like a there's like one person\nthat is like making a big\ndocument about having their fans like\ntrying to collect all the worst things\nthat me and stephen has ever done to try\nto get us banned\nwow that's how bad it is yeah\nsounds like you're being hunted yeah\nyeah and i i don't\nit all i came from like something really\ndumb about like one person not liking\nthe other person so with the defense so\nthis person defended bob because of it\num basically and then um\n[Music]\nyeah bob came out with like or first\nstephen stephen went live and he\nexplained like the situation with\nbob talking a bunch of [ __ ] about\nstephen to other people and stuff\nbecause he felt like he didn't really\nstop\nlike bob did this to so many people that\nhe just felt like he had to make it\npublic\nbecause there was no way first for bob\nto stop doing this because it was people\nthat already started hating stephen\num and then after that bob just made\nlike a big\nlike what was it like 40 40 like pages\nof just like [ __ ] and\nleaks and just like crazy stuff to like\nmake us look as bad as possible and a\nbunch of lies\nand then steven made like a big one too\nwhere he explained everything that\nhappened basically\num and one of the things that happened\nwas that um\nbob sexually harassed another girl and\nthat came out in this one too\nso after that came out this other person\nwhich is casey john\ntried to get us banned because she's\nreally upset because she took bob's side\non this so it's pretty so it's kind of\nlike a war\nbetween yeah it sounds like a war like\npeople that are like\nit reminds me of like like i don't\nlike it's like really insane like it's\njust like it's a great question\ni mean this reminds me of like studying\neuropean history you know when like\nfrance and spain start to fight and then\nengland is like we're on spain side\nbecause [ __ ] france and then germany's\nlike oh my god\nwe better join france aside and then\nlike you have this whole balance of\npower thing where like different people\nare like making documents and supporting\neach other and like\nyeah it's like really insane yeah i\ndon't know i'm just like\ni just i here's the thing\nwhat kind of person i am i just want to\nlike have a cabin\nin nature just chill do my thing\nmake art and do shrooms that's what i\nwant to do i just want to chill i don't\nwant that\nlike that was my life before this like i\njust like\nliked being very present and stuff\nwhat what do you like about streaming\nlike it's weird right because it's like\ni want a cabin out in the woods i want\nto just be by myself and stream\nyou can just toss that in there gaming\nis nice if i can like spend time with my\ncommunity and i can travel around and i\ncan show them\nthe beauty of the world that's why i\nlike doing because i think the world is\nbeautiful\nyeah if i can do that it makes me happy\nyou know\nbut how do you get into all this\num i mean i became friends with bob\nright that's how it started\nso i think oddly enough so melina we've\ngot a couple of different options okay\none is that you know if you feel like it\nwould be helpful to you\nor helpful for us to understand i'm\nhappy to hear more of the play-by-plays\nabout who said what and who did what\nif you think that kind of thing is\nhelpful generally speaking i i don't\nknow that i'm really that good at\nno i don't think it's necessary either\nokay\nit's more about the um that\nright now i just feel like there's been\nlike so many things\nthat i just feel like i don't think i'm\ngonna be the same person in a year you\nknow\ni think i'm just gonna be at the worst\nversion of myself possible very soon\nokay so let me offer a couple of\ndifferent directions and then you let me\nknow so i think the\nthe term divorced version of yourself\nthat sounds actually let me just forget\nabout what i was going to\ntell you what that means version the\nworst or divorce\nthe worst okay\nwhat help me understand that why do you\nthink you're gonna be the worst version\nof yourself a year from now\num because i just feel like\ni don't think i've\ni don't think okay so i don't think i've\ncried\nas much and like felt so much anxiety\nthis past year or like last year than\ni've ever\nlike felt my entire life almost maybe\nlike when i was a kid or something but i\ndon't remember that exactly\num and i remember when i was\nliving in a van and i was traveling\naround and i was in nature i think\nduring six months i had one bad day\nyeah and i feel like i always like\nevery single day i get back to like a\ndark place\nevery single day and what brings you\nback to that dark place\nit kind of just hits from out of nowhere\nor something i don't know like it from i\ndon't know where it just hits\nand that sounds good terrible i mean\nsometimes when i think about going to a\ndark place i think like if it's\ntriggered by something at least you have\nsome sense of like\ncontrol or preparation\nbut if it just kind of randomly like it\nsounds like it haunts you\nright like i think like it like follows\nyou around\nyeah i think it's like always there i\nguess\nyeah it's it's really hard to like live\nhere\nand just like stream and just like do\nthe same thing like every single day and\nthen\num like that can like happen during\nstream too so that really sucks as well\nand then i feel really really sad and i\nfeel like it can't deliver or like i can\nfunction\nwhat is it that haunts you\num just like\ni just feel like i'm uh\ni don't know i i'm trying to think if i\ncare about these people that hurt me\nlike if i care about their opinions\ni don't know maybe i do a little i mean\ni just feel like so weak and hurt and\njust like\ni feel like i don't like deserve to like\ntake care of myself\nmaybe like that's what it feels like so\ni just like don't really see the purpose\nof like\ndoing anything good for myself or like\nto stream\nor to like eat or like try to work out\nor anything like that i just like\nlose motivation\nhow long have you felt like you don't\ndeserve to take care of yourself\ni think it comes and goes but i think\nthis time period right now has been the\nlongest one and that has probably\nit's probably been like going like\ngrowing\nbut always been there but like growing\nfor maybe like three months\nokay\nso molina this may be a little bit so\none thing i want to kind of offer you is\num so a lot of times we talk about\nfeelings\nbut i think uh today i'm hearing that\nthere may be a couple things that may\napply may not apply but i could actually\nsort of like\ntry to explain a few concepts or even\nmake a couple of recommendations\nin your case now the challenge is that\nyou know if i jump into that now there's\na decent chance some of that stuff is\nactually like\nwrong like it doesn't apply to you um\nand the more we talk i think the more\nyou know\nthe sort of educational principles are\ngonna apply to you but i already have\nsome\nkind of ideas about stuff um\nso do you think we should explore\nfurther or do you wanna try to\nlike maybe start to formulate a plan is\nto like how to tackle this\num we can explore further okay\nyeah um\nso tell me understand what is the worst\nversion of yourself what\nhow is that person different from where\nyou are now\nwhat will you become that you don't want\nto be\ni feel like when i'm happy i'm shining a\nlot\num and i see a smile does really\nlight up your face it's like it's like\nmagic yeah\nyeah um so i just feel like and that's\nlike how i\num like express myself i guess like\nbeing happy i guess and\nyeah um i think i let myself feel things\nwhich is good like i'm pretty excited\nlike i'm accepting my own feelings a lot\ni think\num but i feel like i can't like deliver\nlike what i do i guess or like how i\nhow i am um\n[Music]\nand it sounds like something's getting\nin the way of you being you\nyeah exactly it does it feels like\nthat's taking away from me you know\nand um i also feel like um\nlike instead of like seeing like the\npositive things and like feeling happy\nand excited and just like laughing and\nbeing excited to like do things and\nstuff like that i just feel like i'm\nlike becoming very hateful\nand i feel like i see the worst in\npeople even if they haven't even done\nanything to me yet or anything\ni just like expect the worst i feel like\ni can't trust anyone i feel like i'm\nbecoming more lonely\num i feel like i feel less too\ni feel like it's hard for me to like\nexpress\nmy feelings true i'm i'm almost hearing\nlike\nalmost like a defense of numbness\num yeah i'm becoming like more maybe\nlike i don't even know if it's like\nangry it's just hateful i guess\nand i just feel like the the way that i\nam is like gone almost\noh it's go it's going to be gone soon\ngonna be\ndestroyed by hatred you're gonna become\nyou're gonna become a sith lord\ni don't know i just i just feel like i'm\nlike dying\nthat's what it feels like yeah tell me\nabout the hatred\num no just it's just like a\nfeeling that's there it's just growing\njust there and\nwhatever um\nit's like everything it's\nit's like everything i don't know like\nit it's it it\nit's it's not like i hate like specific\nthings it feels like it's just a hate\nfilter that comes on and then i just see\neverything that way\nyou know yeah so what are some one\nfilter i have like this\nlike dark like hate filter on yeah so i\ncan see how having the hate filter\ninstead of the love filter is the worst\nversion of you yeah that you kind of\nview yourself as someone\ni mean do you think you have a love\nfilter on and the best version of you\nyeah okay\nlike love and happiness and just like um\nit's so hard to like explain i feel like\ni've um hmm\nthis is like really weird but when i\nwhen i used to do like a lot of\npsychedelics and stuff\ni felt like i had like a lot of love\nfilter\num because you kind of like just like\nlove and accept\neverything that's the thing like no\nmatter if it's bad or whatever\nyou see everything is as it is and you\ndecide to just see it in a good way\nbecause that's like the\nyeah it just it just kind of sucks when\nit's like almost impossible to feel that\nway because like\nall of this is like happening and you\ncan't really control yourself and this\nis all just like growing\ni don't know i don't even know if that\nmakes sense yeah i think it makes a lot\nof sense i have a weird question for you\ncan you have a love filter on when you\nlook at your hate filter can you love\nyour hate filter\num maybe this is\nthis this makes me think about um um\nthere's like a picture of a person\nlooking at a field with flowers\nand then there's another person that is\nlike\non books and then that person sees like\nthat behind\num or oh this is like a fake picture\nthis is\nactually just like a screen and then\nbehind that the world is trash\nand then like then there's like another\nperson that is stepping on more books\nor like on books and see that that is\nalso a screen\nand that the universe is like beautiful\nbasically because that person is so high\nup but it seems to be\nlike the beautiful of the universe kind\nof thing it sounds like that a little\nbit\nyeah that's a great analogy yeah\nbut that has to do with knowledge or\nwhatever but yeah\num i thought about that i did like um\ni did how much most i think is like 7.5\ngrams of mushrooms a year ago\nwhich was not really that was an\naccident that was pretty crazy\nis that all right huh is that a lot\nis that crazy yeah like you're you're\ngone\nit's like you're somewhere else um i can\nhandle those sort of moments where it's\nlike really stressful or like really\ninsane like pretty well but i remember i\nthought about that a lot that\num that it everything felt really\nuncomfortable\nbecause it's like really intense but it\nall depends like\nif i if i kind of like just accepted\nthat and just thought\nabout the world trying to like show me\nan experience\nand why wouldn't i try to like see that\nas a positive thing even though it was\nreally uncomfortable and just like try\nto love that feeling instead\nkind of i don't know so it makes me can\ni ask you a little bit more about the\nhatred\num\nfrom people or or from know what you\nfeel\nabout hate yeah like like so i asked you\nlike\nyou know what do you hate and you said\nit's like a filter\nand i hate everything can you give me\nsome examples of like what are some of\nthe things that you hate\num certain people\nparticular people yeah\nwhat about other people like\nyour community yourself stephen your\nfamily\ndo you hate them too or is it just\nparticular people\nmaybe it's like particular people it's\njust that i can't like\nit's hard for me just because my trust\nhas been broken\nit's very hard for me to see people like\nthat hasn't done anything to me in a\ngood way too\nbecause i'm just waiting for them to\nbetray me too\nright so it's like oh that sounds like\ntrauma\nyeah yeah yeah\num\nso it doesn't sound like you actually so\ni guess the the hate filter that you're\nreferring to is sort of\nwaiting for other people to betray you\nbut that\nactually when it comes down to your\nhatred you actually just\nfeel hatred towards a few people\nprobably but it's also just that i i\ndon't know i can feel hate towards\npeople that i don't know\ncan you give me an example of that um\nlike if there's a person that messaged\nme and i can tell like\nmy first instinct is like they want\nsomething you know\nthey want something and these this\nperson is [ __ ]\nthis person doesn't give a [ __ ] about me\nor about it and what would the message\nsay can you give us an example it could\nbe\nsomeone just like reaching out checking\non how i'm doing\nit could be anything that's the thing\nbut i'm just like like this person wants\nsomething\nlike this person doesn't give a [ __ ]\nthis person doesn't know me\nthis person has no idea what's going on\nand then when did you get\nno when did you start to feel like\nwhen did that hate filter come get put\non\nwhen did you start to have those kinds\nof thoughts about other people\num i think it's been slowly growing\nsince a year ago maybe\nbut like right now it's really really\nbad um\ni think like the mo like when it really\nreally happened was probably like\noctober or november i think it became\neven worse for sure\num because there's always like\nsmall things happening and then like\none like big thing happens and then like\nsmall things happens and then like one\nbig one like goes like that and what how\ndo you change when those things happen\num\nfirst i think i get like really hurt and\nreally shocked\nand then i think i get pretty sad and\nthen i get pretty angry\nand then i think it's just like\nsomething has changed within me\nbut i i think i'm like i don't give a\n[ __ ] like i think i'm like that\nbut i think i do but it's just so deep\nthat i can't really see like the the\ndetails of it anymore like it\nwhen it happened i saw details of it but\nthen it's like like another weight\nlike on me i guess yeah it's a very\ninsightful way of thinking about it\nwhat do you think it is that's very deep\nlike like\ncan you give me any information about\nwhat is that thing\nthe the like the heavy weights like um\njust feeling\nbut that's like the thing like that\ncomes like from it's like so deep and\nthen\nit feels like it just comes i don't know\nhow to say it um\nit's hard i don't know do you feel like\nit's dormant\nand then it wakes up at times and then\nit goes back to sleep\num yeah sure a little bit like that yeah\ni guess so\nbut like when something happens it feels\nlike everything like comes up again a\nlittle bit\nyeah yeah that's how it works yeah\num\nso molina can i share some thoughts with\nyou\nso first of all i want to say i don't\nthink any of this is your fault\ni don't know if you you know blame\nyourself for it i d\ndo i think you have some degree of\nagency or control over your situation\nabsolutely\nbut i i i would encourage you to do your\nbest\nto not\nblame yourself but also like strike a\nbalance between accepting that you made\na mistake\nbecause i think you may have made\nmistakes but also like forgiving\nyourself for making that mistake\nwhich is actually a little bit tricky so\na lot of times we will be like\nthat was wrong and therefore i'm a piece\nof [ __ ] or\nnothing was wrong and i'm totally fine\nthe truth is that\nit was wrong and you aren't a piece of\n[ __ ] it's just\nyou know we're human beings we learn so\nhere's\nwhat i kind of hear from you so you're\nlike kind of an open and happy person by\nnature you're like\ni'ma get in a van and drive around new\nzealand and do some shrooms and meet\npeople and have fun and like engage with\npeople and like\nappreciate what life has to offer and\nlisten to the sound of a mountain stream\nand\nand watch a sunset and like you know\nengage with a community and have some\nfun like that's really who you are\nand then people take advantage of your\nopenness um so i think that you do let\npeople in and i think\nprobably this is where like um you know\nlearning some about like setting\nboundaries because it sounds like what's\nhappening is you let people\nkind of like deep in and then they like\nbetray you right and i think there's\nthere's probably something around the\nkind of person\nthat you attract so that like you are so\nopen and you are so bright\nand you have this like they adjust which\ni think we may have talked about last\ntime i'm sort of starting to remember\nbut that you have this sort of like\nenergy about you that like\nbrings sort of like the hungry lonely\npeople from the internet\nand they see molina as shiny and they're\nlike ooh i want something\nright and and then i think that things\nget into like this is where things get\nkind of tricky because i think that you\nactually have needs there too which you\nmay not realize\nwhich is that like i think you probably\nget a lot of benefit\nfrom being that person for other people\nand so you guys enter into these\nrelationships where you guys are like\noffering a lot of like emotional support\nbut it may be a little bit unclear about\nlike what\nthe foundation of that relationship is\nso i think there's like a mutual\nfriendship where people can support each\nother but i see this a lot\nin in streamer communities especially\nwhere\nyou know things get really tangled\nespecially when two people are streamers\nbecause then there's like\nnumbers involved and this person is\ngrowing bigger than i am and this person\nis doing this and this person is doing\nthat\nand and so there's a lot of like genuine\nfriendship there's a lot of genuine\ngoodness there's a lot of genuine caring\nthat then gets like polluted by these\nother things\nbut one thing that i would really\nencourage you to think a little bit\nabout is like for the people who do\nbetray you what did the start of your\nrelationship look like\nand if you want to talk more i think\nthat's where we should explore\nbecause i would guess um and that's just\na guess right so this could be\ncompletely off\nis that like there's something about the\nway that that relationship starts\nwhere either you're kind of like this is\nwhere we put our psychoanalysts sort of\nhat on you can go see a psychoanalyst\nabout this if you want to i don't really\nunderstand this stuff\nbut are you playing out some kind of\nthing with your mom\nor or like is this the kind of thing\nlike because so sometimes we\nas human beings willingly enter\nfamiliar familiar but painful situation\nand this goes back to that that patient\nthat i was working with who\nsort of like like any time like a woman\ntreats him with like respect early on he\ngets like kind of confused\nbut when he meets a woman who sort of\nlike devalues him and then he in turn\ndevalues her he's a toxic and abusive\ntoo it's just like\nit goes both ways and so they kind of\nfall into this pattern and and i think\nin his case it's really about\nit was really confusing for him and we\nworked through like\nthat initial relationship that initial\ninteraction\nwhere like he starts to pull away so\nwhat i'd be really curious about is for\nbob\nyou know how did y'all's relationship\nstart\num and kind of exploring that because i\nthink you'll find a lot of answers there\ni think the other things to think a\nlittle bit about are\nyou know i i do think that it seems like\nyou evoke complicated feelings in people\nso my sense just hearing you know what\nyou said about bob is not that he's like\ni mean maybe he's two-faced and\nuntrustworthy and whatever i have no\nidea\nbut it sounds to me like when he was\ngiving you lots of reasons like i don't\nthink he's like\nlying about five of them and one of them\nis real i think they're all\nreal and contradictory which is why it's\nso confusing for him\nand like so confusing for you\nbecause it probably may have been i mean\nit could have been a lot for him to sit\nwith all of your\nemotional weight he made it neat have\nneeded to decompress\nand then he may be devaluing you in\nterms of how much that hurt you so he\nmay say like oh it's not that big of a\ndeal i don't understand why you're bent\nout of shape\nand the reason he does that is because\nhe actually does care about you\nand the thought that he did something\nthat hurts you\nhurts him so much that he has to like\npretend it didn't happen\nwhich doesn't mean that he doesn't care\nabout you in fact it sort of means the\nopposite does that make sense\nhe can't tolerate the idea this is just\na hypothesis\nwe've never met the guy but it may be\npossible that he can't tolerate the idea\nand he knows exactly\nthat what he did was wrong and really\nhurtful and he cares about you\nso he's like let's pretend it didn't\nhappen can we just move on\nand it sort of makes sense to me that\nhe's huh\ndo you think it's like that with\neveryone almost that's done something\nlike that\ni think that\nlet me say this is that true for\neveryone i don't know but i will say\nthis\nthat\nthe easiest pain for one human being to\nignore\nis the pain that they cause to someone\nwho they care about\nso the biggest deniers of me hurting you\nare parents towards their children if\nyou want to see\nreally really really strong deny denial\ntalk to a parent about how they hurt\ntheir children\nand you'll see the strongest denial in\nthe world so in my history as a\npsychiatrist that is\nand the more you care the more you deny\nbecause like if you care about someone\nand i really really hurt you like holy\n[ __ ] it means i don't care about you\nand that is so cognitively dissonant\nand difficult for someone to sit with\nthat it really causes all kinds of\nproblems and i think it sounds like you\nguys are sort of in the situation where\nhe can't admit what he did to you so you\nguys can't move past it\nand this is where i think a big part of\nlike moving past things\nis actually admitting that hurt happened\nright and then you can really forgive\npeople but like unless there was no real\nif there's no crime then there's no\nmercy right like um yeah\nsure i mean it sounds like it\nin this case i mean i would say in terms\nof everyone so it also doesn't sound\nlike everyone betrayed you it sounds\nlike there are a lot of people in your\nlife that don't betray you\nbut it feels like everyone betrayed you\nyeah i think it's like an unbelievable\nlike amount of people that's like doing\nsomething\nwhat percentage of people that you\nregularly interact with would you say\nhave betrayed you\nprobably like 70 80 percent and what tot\nwhat's the total pool of people like are\nwe talking five people 10 people 20\npeople\n50 people maybe like 50\n20 30 something so that's a shockingly\nhigh number\nyeah that's what if that's\nyeah it's just that like a lot of\ni don't know it's like it's not just\nlike only people that i like know\nreally really like well and deep and\nthat's like that i'm friends with for a\nvery long time it's also like people\nthat\nthat i know about and knows about me and\nthat i've met and then they decide to do\nsomething\na little like that's what it feels like\nand then i think can you give me an\nexample of someone who you\nknow and who you met who did something\nto you\num like like a name\nno just like like an example of what\nthey did that you felt was betrayal\num like\nyou're saying like [ __ ] talking behind\nmy back and stuff like that hearing that\nthat person said things about me but how\ndo you hear that\num because i hear other people say it\nand then i confront them about it\nand then they say oh this person told me\nyeah or i've heard they say\nsomething on stream or something like\nthat yeah yeah so that sounds to me like\nyou may have a betrayal filter\nright so when 80 of people in your life\nbetray you there are a couple of\ndifferent reasons for that one is that\nyou have a tendency to attract scumbags\nwhich is very possible given light\nradiance etc\nsecond option is that you may have a\nbetrayal filter so this we see a lot\nwhere like people\nyou know they when they start to feel\nlike they've been betrayed\ntheir mind will go and hunt other\nexperiences that sort of fit into their\nmodel\nand another kind of random example that\nmay feel like it's pretty far is like in\ncells are a good example of this\nso they're kind of like convinced\nthat they're like unattractive and so\nevery time that someone does something\nthat suggests that they're\nattractive they kind of ignore it and\nevery time there's like even like\nsomething that's in the gray area they\ntheir mind sort of finds that as\nevidence\nand this we see a lot when people have\num a lot of emotional hurt\nright so we know that like when i'm\nhurting\nthings become more painful so people\nwho have depression literally experience\nmore pain from the same stimulus than\nsomeone who's like mentally feeling well\nso you can deliver like the same shock\nor like whatever benign like slightly\npainful thing\nand it like hurts more when people are\ndepressed\nthat could be a piece of it i don't know\nhow that makes you feel though because i\nimagine it's quite invalidating\nwhat does that word mean invalidating\nlike it's like i'm saying\noh it's all in your head i'm afraid of\ncoming across like that\nno i think that's okay okay\ni mean it does sound like a shocking\namount of people\nhave you know yeah betrayed tradies\nespecially the past two years\nand especially the past six months or\nfive months something yeah\nwhat do you think do you think something\nhas happened that has caused all these\npeople to\ndo this\ni think i gave a lot to people and when\nthey see that i am like\nthat i have like one boundary or\nsomething they get really upset\nthat's what it feels like um like there\nwas like one scenario with another\nstreamer where we um\num she wanted to go travel with me and\num\nyeah but but i told her that i\nthat i couldn't i couldn't go travel\nwith her if i didn't stream\nbetween like this time and this time\nevery single day\nand for her it was really really\nimportant for me to not stream at that\ntime because she wanted to stream and\nshe wanted to be\nme to be on her stream um\nwell i'm not live so she could get more\nviewers but i told her that\nthis is not my hobby as it is for you i\nneed to stream\nbecause the past three weeks i haven't\nstreamed this much and i'm losing a lot\nof money\nand i feel like scared of yeah like i\nneed i need to uh i need to stream\nand she was like okay yeah yeah but she\ndidn't really care about it and then\nlike when we came to the moment where\num where i turned my stream on and she\nwas streaming at the same time she got\nreally really really mad\nand that's how the friendship ended just\nlike that\nyeah that felt really weird because i\nfelt like i\nhelped her and then when i had one\nboundary of like i needed a stream\nbecause i needed to survive because i\nwas losing so much sure because\nyeah she didn't respect that at all and\nthen\nshe just yeah she's left\nyeah so that makes a lot of sense i mean\ni i think that\nin the sense of like a big thing for me\nbut it's just like really weird and i\nsee like\nthe stuff like this happens a lot yeah\nso i i think\nlike i mentioned some time ago i think\nthat like maybe what we need to talk\nabout is boundaries\nbecause i i do think it's possible that\nsomething about the way that you start\nyour relationships\nbecause you are so open because you are\nso\ncaring because you are so supportive\nmakes people think that you don't have\nboundaries\nor and this is where if we really want\nto say you're guilty of something\ni would not be surprised i'd give it a\n50 50 chance\nthat there are times early on in\nrelationships where you\nwillingly let people cross boundaries or\nyou don't enforce boundaries that you\nshould\nand so if we really think about where\ndoes the expectation like so people love\nyou molina because\nwhen we talked about this last time you\nput other people first\nand i think actually i've seen a lot of\ngrowth in you because now what i'm\nhearing is like [ __ ] those people\ni belong somewhere but it doesn't feel\nvery good it feels like that's not me\nfeeling that way yeah so i think this is\nwhere you have to\nstart to learn how to i think be someone\nwho is like somewhere in the middle\nright where you can be like open and\nloving and caring\nand also like set boundaries and\nand this is where i'd really wonder i\nthink a lot of this comes down to the\nbeginning of the relationships it's like\nwhen you enforce that tiny little\nboundary at the beginning that doesn't\nmean very much\nhow do you feel about yourself\num selfish i guess there you go\nyeah it doesn't feel good yeah makes\nme feel really bad about myself if i do\nyep\nso i think that's the big problem it\nreally makes me feel like a piece of\n[ __ ] that's like how i feel yeah\nyeah so is it normal surprisingly so\nshockingly so but i think that's sort of\nlike where i\nthink honestly molina a lot of this\nstuff i mean if we want to kind of like\npin it down to one thing i mean\nobviously it's more complicated than\nthat\nbut i think what we're talking about is\nlike you engaging in relationships where\nyou know someone says hey molina can you\nstop your stream 15 minutes early\nbecause i'm having a headache and then\nin that moment you're like oh my god i\nwould be such an [ __ ] i wouldn't be\nthe person that i want to be because you\nhave this version of yourself\nwhich is like you know living in nature\nbeing awesome being supportive that\npeople can count on taking care of your\nmom\nall this sort of stuff right and then\nlike in that moment\nyou sacrifice a little bit because you\ndon't want to feel like a bad person in\nthat moment\nand then you sacrifice a little bit more\nand you sacrifice a little bit more\nand then they kind of like move in\ninto your personal space and then like\nyou finally have learned\nhow to set boundaries right so this\nsounds like a really really healthy\nconversation that you had with this\nperson\nhey i'd love to travel with you here's\nwhat i need\nand then people get bent out of shape\nwhen you're like hey you remember when i\ntold you i needed something and i\nactually need it\nand they're like how dare you and this\nis where if you think about that like\nwhy would someone respond that way it\nmay be because\nin the past you have said hey i need to\ndo this\nhey i need to do this and then you may\nhave let them slide and not actually\nhold them\nhold that boundary yeah\nit's i don't i just like the outcome is\nso crazy it just makes me think that no\none really gives a [ __ ]\nabout me i guess even i really feel like\nthat moment where i said i really need a\nstream\nthat i feel i feel like that was like\ncompletely fair of me but there's no\ni can't believe like why did she get so\nmad it's like so insane and then she\njust wanted she just blocked me\neverywhere\nso so melina this is where i mean that\nsounds like a terrible experience i\ndon't think you did anything wrong there\nbut i'm gonna say something because i\ntend to have a bias\nto empower and hold the person that i'm\ntalking to\naccountable for their situation okay so\nif this comes across as unsympathetic i\napologize\ni think the reason that she is that way\nis because you let her get away with it\nfor so long\nyeah right and when you let people get\naway with something like they're gonna\ntake\nwhat they're used to mm-hmm\nthis is also something that's really\ncrazy maybe it's true that you say that\nthat since last time we spoke i'm\nbecoming a little bit more angry and i\nput\nmore boundaries i've heard from so many\ndifferent people\nthat yeah after that dr k talk that you\nhad you're becoming way more\num arrogant and vic like you're\nvictimizing yourself all the time and\nthey got like really really mad for me\nlike\nstanding up for myself like a lot of\npeople have said that\nto make me feel bad and that's really\nweird i don't know\nand this is like a lot like yeah a lot\nof people\nthat i've known for like a long period\nof time\nwell apologies for ruining your\nrelationships with those people\nand at the same time if they're calling\nyou if they're calling you arrogant for\nstanding up for yourself\ni mean so like when you stand up for\nyourself in the people\nyeah or that i'm like i shouldn't do\nthat or that should be okay for me or\nsomething like that or this is a stupid\nboundary or something like that\ni've had people telling me that like\nthis is yeah so so\nthis is a stupid boundary is how sexual\nassault happens\nyeah that's true right so i think you've\njust got to be really like\nso it's very possible that you're more\narrogant\nit's very possible that you perceive\nsetting your boundaries you call it\nsetting your boundaries but what you're\nbeing in real life is an [ __ ] to the\npeople around you\nthat's possible because i've seen that\ntoo where someone's like\ni talked to dr k and i'm gonna set my\nown boundaries\nand my own boundaries means you can go\n[ __ ] yourself\nthat's being an [ __ ] it's possible\nso and this is where where molina like\nyou really may have turned into a little\nbit of an [ __ ] because i think it's\nnew for you\nright like you used to be so\naccommodating\nthat you may have swung the pendulum too\nfar to the other side\nand so this is where like it takes\npractice between being a pushover\nand being an [ __ ] and somewhere in\nthe middle\nbut frankly what you said i think makes\na lot of sense at least with the\nstreamer person that if you\nhad a conversation with them about what\nyour needs are\nlike over time i think people hopefully\nlike you\nwho learn this sort of stuff end up in\nhealthier relationships like\nwhen when i teach someone how to stand\nup for themselves\neveryone around them is pissed about it\nand then some of them adjust some of\nthem don't and then over time they find\nlike new friends that generally tend to\nbe healthier relationships\nyeah so like just as a yeah\nit's it's just crazy to me to like\nimagine that people can be like this and\nthey can like be mad about\nother people's boundaries it's just like\nso insane i don't know for me that's\njust like because i don't do that\nor like yeah i feel like unbelievable to\nme it's i don't understand like\nhere here's here's the common thread i\nwouldn't think about it as them being\ndisrespectful of your boundaries what i\nwould think about is\nwhat upsets people is when you confound\ntheir expectations\nso i don't think that these people are\nlike you know running around being\n[ __ ] violating people's boundaries\nand pushing people around i don't think\nthat's actually what's happening\nthat's what that's this that's what's\nthat's what this particular case may\nlook like from your perspective\ni think what's really going on is you\nhave given people\na unspoken promise and then you're\ntaking that away\nand that's what upsets people\nright so it's sort of like um\nyou know it's like i'm working with\nsomeone who\ni'm working with a couple and one member\nof the couple has decided to start\neating super healthy and it started\nlosing weight\nand instead of being happy their partner\nis just livid they're so\npissed off because now like there be\nit's being exposed to them like how\nunhealthy they're eating like one\nperson's trying to take care of\nthemselves\nand like the other person is really\nreally like upset they're frustrated\nthey feel super self-conscious for\neating crappy food all the time\nyou know their partner is like getting\ninto shape and it is like one of the\nmost\ntoxic difficult things yeah\nand so you could say i i can't believe\nthat someone would be upset that someone\nelse wants to eat healthy like\nof course that doesn't make any sense\nbut what's going on is we were both\ngonna be degenerate pizza eating\n[ __ ] together and then you\ndecided to go get healthy and now what\nam i supposed to do\ni feel that also a lot about like\nbecause i didn't i didn't really stream\na year ago and then when i started\nstreaming a lot of other people that i\nknow that streams as well\nand when i like got like more viewers\nthan them and stuff they started getting\nlike really angry\nand they would never want to like give\nme a compliment about it they were just\nlike [ __ ] on me for\nlike doing the content that i was doing\nand stuff like that\nyeah so like i said when it comes to\nrelationships between streamers like\nnumbers and quantification and one\nperson growing and one person being left\nbehind like all that kind of stuff\nisn't complicating factor right so like\nit's it's hard because\nit you know in your friend's case did\nshe respect your boundaries no was that\nnice of her no\nbut then we also have to try to be like\nunderstand from her perspective\nshe maybe saw this as an opportunity for\nher to grow her stream\nand she kind of sees you as taking that\naway from her\nand and so it's it's sort of like\nthere's a whole different\nangle right so you're saying that i have\nto stream because i need the money\nand i can't take the hit and she's\nthinking the same thing\nand you're thinking how can she be so\nheartless this is something i need to do\nfor money and she's actually having the\nsame thoughts how can molina be so\nheartless and take streamers away from\nme she's bigger than i am\nshe could grow my stream but instead\nshe's like picking herself over me\nand both of y'all are like thinking the\nsame thing does that\nmake sense yeah it does not\ni really think in that case just based\non what you said i think you're\nabsolutely in the right there because if\nyou have particular needs and you lay\nthat out with people and someone agrees\nand then\nit turns out that you know you're living\nup to what you said\nyeah you know thoughts\nquestions um sometimes people\ntry to like i don't know if i mean they\nkind of like try to manipulate me a\nlittle bit i don't even know if they're\nlike\nconscious of like doing that but\nsometimes if i can talk to people\nand i'm saying no or like i can't do\nthis or something like that they're\ntrying to like make me feel\nas guilty as possible by saying a lot of\nreally horrible things\nlike what did they say like um\nmy mom my mom tried to like force me to\nbe in a call with her for two hours\nsaying that that i am a horrible person\nfor not wanting to talk to her and stuff\nlike that\nand that if i didn't speak to her and\nlisten to her complain about\nwhat is she the person i am to her\nbecause i'm not doing this and this\nisn't that she gonna go kill herself\nstuff like that so like it's like really\ninsane and she knows she has like the\ncontrol over me as well\nshe knows she has that because i'm her\ndaughter and this is what she's been\ndoing for\nlike forever um so that was like really\nreally hard and i couldn't hang up\nlike i just can't physically hang up on\nher it's like too much\nand i was just like freaking out because\nshe is like\nreally really really making me feel so\nincredibly shitty about myself i am so\nsorry melina that sounds\nterrible yeah so i tried to just avoid\ntalking to her but then i like i get a\nmessage i'm like [ __ ] i feel so guilty\ni'm like not calling her but i don't\nwant to call her because i can't like i\ncan't\ni can't talk to her because she's so\ndeep down\nand she's been doing that to me since i\nwas a kid\nthat's [ __ ] up yeah i feel like if\ni then talk to her for probably like\nfour months and then i kind of realized\nthat all the things that i\nfelt about her when i was a kid and that\ni feel still like when i talk to her\nis like like i feel a small version of\nthat with everyone else when stuff like\nthis happens but i feel that even more\nwith her\nyeah and i think it kind of comes from\ni think it comes from that relationship\nwith harats i had as a kid\nokay\nyeah so let's\nlet me think for a second man molina\nyou're very insightful\nwhat does that mean insightful yeah\nsorry\nyou're really good at figuring things\nout i think i'm pretty\nyou're very good at connecting the dots\nand recognizing things\nthank you i'm just thinking about\nhow to help you with this\nokay so how are you feeling right now\nyou feeling okay\ni'm gonna point somehow yeah i mean i'm\nlike very\nlike i feel like if it was maybe like a\nyear ago i would probably very\nbe like very upset i would be looking\nvery upset but right now i'm just like\nso numb\nyeah i guess so i think part of it is\nnumbness\npart of it is strength\num so\ni'm gonna say something i'm gonna point\nsomething out in your thought process\nwhich is super super tricky okay\nit may come across as judgmental because\ni'm going to point out your role in this\nokay\nyeah sure so on the one hand so on the\none hand\nit sounds like your mom has been very\nvery emotionally manipulative\ncontinues to be emotionally manipulative\nand is really\nchipped away at some part of you\nthat i think like other people can like\nthen\nuse like you have a vulnerability of\nbeing emotionally manipulated by like\nother people needing your support right\nand this is why at the very beginning\nwhen they're like hey molina can you\nstop\nstreaming 15 minutes early and then\nyou're like i feel self-loathing if i\nsay\nno i can't i'm sorry you have to give in\nto them so that goes the whole boundary\nthing that we were talking about you see\nthat like that's connected\nso i think the reason that you feel that\nway about yourself is because\nyour mom like\nlike wrote that into your programming so\nyou've got this like one vulnerability\nthat i suspect a lot of people\nso this is where like you know human\nbeings will sniff around for like what\nthey're looking for\nand you may actually attract people who\nlike\nuse that vulnerability on you\nbecause when they need something from\nyou and then you're like oh yeah let me\ngive it to you and they're like oh\nawesome\nand then what they do is they start to\nlike be a little bit emotionally\nmanipulative and like\nlike you said now we're gonna get to the\ntricky part because you say people\ndon't do it consciously but they make me\nfeel a certain way\nnow this is where we're gonna get really\npotentially me being an [ __ ]\nand potentially you know running against\na lot of popular\num thought nowadays i mean like it's\nfine like i get a lot of criticism and i\nget people telling me a lot of things\nall the time that's fine yeah so\nso let me know if this feels critical to\nyou okay so i think you've got to be\ncareful when you're when you tell me\nthat someone doesn't consciously want to\nmake you feel that way\nif you feel like they're emotionally\nmanipulating you\nand the reason you say that they're\nemotionally manipulating you is because\nthis person says something and i feel\nguilty\nthat's what you call emotional\nmanipulation right but that may actually\nhave nothing to do with them that may\nhave everything to do with you\nyeah right so so so that's where like i\nthink you've got to be really really\ncareful\nwhere um so i\nbecause i don't know that people are\nemotionally manipulating you i think\nit's just\nin the past when you try to raise that\nboundary\nyour mom emotionally manipulates and so\nyour brain is doing what all brains do\nand it's learned from the past and it's\napplying the past to the present\nso i know that sounds kind of weird but\nlike you know every time i see a toilet\nthat i've never used before\nhow do i know how to flush the toilet\nit's because my brain is projecting\nprior toilets onto this one\nand i treat this toilet like all of the\nother toilets\nand so what your brain is doing is you\nhad so much of this stuff from your mom\nthat anytime someone does something that\nsort of looks like your mom or smells\nlike your mom\nyou feel the same way that you did with\nyour mom and you're kind of applying it\nto this scenario\nyeah does that feel critical or\ninvalidating to you\nokay because i think you are doing a\npiece of this and i'd be really careful\nbecause i think some people around you\nare really emotionally manipulative\nbecause they've sensed out that weakness\nin you and that's how they like they\nneed people like that\nthey have emotional needs and they know\nthat molina's good\nday or night if i'm hurting molina's\ngoing to drop whatever she's doing\nand she's going to take care of me and\nthen you reinforce that right because\nyou have this [ __ ]\nyou don't give yourself a break because\nyou want yourself to be this perfect\nversion of yourself that your mom turned\nyou into\nwhereas like i think you should be a\nlittle bit of a [ __ ] like that's my\nfavorite molina\nyou know like where you can own the\nspace that you control\nand you can set some limits and like you\ncan try to make the world a better place\nbut\nyou don't have to like sacrifice\nyourself to do it\nso i think you've got to be careful and\nand this goes for everyone else who's\nlistening to that like you got\ngot to be careful if you if you start\nletting other people control\nyour feelings now i think some of that\nstuff like in the case of your mom or if\nyou're in like you know\nalcoholic parents like it's really hard\nto control that sort of stuff but i\nthink it quickly becomes like you do\nhave some control over that\nand there's this guy named victor\nfrankel who was uh one of the jews who\nwas in\nthe holocaust concentration camps and he\nwrote this book about man's search for\nmeaning and he actually went all the way\nto saying\nthat the nazis actually don't control\nanything about how i feel\nthey can kill me but how i feel and is\nmy choice\nwhich is drastic buddha said the same\nthing too we don't really you know in\nthe world of like\nmicroaggressions and stuff we tend to\nhold other people accountable for our\nfeelings\nwhich i think is really dangerous\nterritory\nbut i would be how do i change and like\nthe way i feel about things how do i\nlike approach and like change my mind\nbeautiful question yeah okay so\nthe first thing is that i think that\nyou've got to give yourself\ntime to learn how to set boundaries and\nrecognize that like when you become\nconfident sometimes what you need is\nlike\na friend group transplant so i see this\na lot in people who have\nsocial anxiety and who are doormats is\nthat when they start like when we start\ndeveloping confidence they actually like\nwill lose a lot of their friends and\nlike over time they'll get new ones\nvery practically i'd strongly strongly\nconsider i know this is hard during\ncovent\nbut i think that these kinds of social\ninteractions are amplified by the\nstresses of streaming\nso i think the more friends that you\nhave outside of streaming the less of an\nissue this is going to be\nbecause when streaming like people's\ncareers and livelihoods are on the line\nso it like\nevokes a lot of behavior you know um\nso so that's one thing so like learn\ncontinue to learn how to set boundaries\nand what i would really be careful the\nmost important concrete piece of advice\nthat i have for you\nis early on in the relationship hold\nthat boundary\neven though you feel like a piece of\n[ __ ] that's the most important mistake i\nthink you're making that you can very\npractically change\nso like when you have a new friend it's\ngonna come up and you gotta wait for it\nthey're gonna say hey can you do huh\nyou think that feeling will disappear\nafter a while yes\nit's going to be there forever no i\nthink it'll disappear but there are\nother things you have to do to make it\ndisappear\nthat's going to be the start so so\nremember molina that even if that\nfeeling doesn't disappear\nwhen you give in to that feeling you are\ngoing down\nthe relationship path that leads to\nbetrayal\nwhen you enforce a boundary so even\neven if it hurts to feel like an [ __ ]\nrecognize that\nthat pain in that moment and feeling\nlike an [ __ ] doesn't actually mean\nyou're an [ __ ]\nyou just have to feel like one\nthat protects you from going down the\nroad of people taking advantage of you\nyou\nlaying an eventual boundary and then\nthen them feeling betrayed\nthat's the price you have to pay either\nyou feel like it like hated\nand betrayed six months from now or you\nfeel like a little bit of a [ __ ] today\nyou can also as you're good at right\nbecause you've got a lot of good talents\nhere\nyour tendency to confront check in with\nthem afterward\nsay hey i'm sorry i couldn't pick you up\nfrom the airport because i had to stream\ndo you think that was like i feel kind\nof guilty about that do you\nfeel like i was out of line\nright just talk to him about it yeah and\nthen they say like oh no i totally get\nit like i could just take an uber it's\nlike not that big of a deal\ni was a little bit disappointed but and\nthen some people are going to be like oh\nyeah\nyou are a complete [ __ ] and those are\nthe people you want to knock out of your\nlife\nright so that's so the first thing is\nset that boundary\nearly and often and recognize that the\nreason that people don't set\nboundaries is because of good feelings\nnot bad feelings\nso this is tricky because good feelings\nget\nlike you want to be a good friend you\ndon't want to be guilty and so it's\ngoing to be hard to set that boundary so\nset that boundary early\nokay next thing\nso this what you're describing is a\nperfect example of the sunscript term\nsome scott\nso some scott is a ball of undigested\nemotion\nwhich sort of lies dormant it's like a\nvolcano underneath the surface\nand then it activates at times and like\nwreaks havoc on your psychology\nso there are a couple of different ways\nto digest to some scar\ni would strongly recommend have you ever\nseen a therapist about this stuff with\nyour mom\num yeah but that turned out really bad\num if i ask you questions about that are\nwe gonna learn about bad boundaries\nmore um\nthat situation that was wait is that i\nthink that's like the third\ntherapist i've ever had in my entire\nlife and i didn't have a therapist for a\nvery long time\num but this guy actually tried to be\nsexual with me\ni [ __ ] knew it yeah\nsee how did you know that cause like\nthat like i said if i ask you about this\nare we gonna run into another boundary\nconversation\nyeah but like how am i supposed to like\ndo about that like this is supposed to\nbe a therapist like\nyeah that's their problem not yours\nthey're supposed to see that [ __ ]\nrecognize that they're gonna feel all\nkinds of weird ways about you\nand like restrain themselves turns out\nthat it you probably got a shitty\ntherapist\ni'm sorry but i'm not surprised that it\nhappened\nokay so so this is where you got to give\nit another shot\nmaybe find a female therapist who is not\na lesbian or bisexual\nthat'll help but then you're gonna get\nother kinds of weird boundary violations\nthere too that they need to be super\ncareful about\nbut i strongly strongly recommend\nthat you know like this is the kind of\nthing where like you've been\n[ __ ] traumatized like this sounds bad\nand it sounds like it's ongoing and you\ndeserve help\nand like we're not built to figure this\nout on our own\nokay there's a whole profession that is\ndesigned to help you with this sort of\nthing\nsecond thing that you can do is sign up\nfor our\nour creator coaching program do you know\nabout this i think i messaged you about\nthis so\nwe now like so we're working thankfully\ntwitch has been like kind enough to\nreally support us and support their\ncontent\ncreators where like these issues of\nanxiety and burnout and these sorts of\nboundaries sort of things are like\nsomething that we as an\norganization are trying to support\ncontent creators with\nso this is also where we have to be\nreally careful and if you end up signing\nup for this program it's free for you by\nthe way\num so that's thanks to twitch you can\nthank twitch for that\num so uh so\nthis is where um you know we're gonna\nhave to be really careful that your\ncoach doesn't fall into this\nso like if you sign up for the coaching\nprogram like i'm gonna know\nwho your coach is and i'm gonna prep\nyour coach because you're gonna evoke\nparticular feelings in them\nand then like we're gonna like help like\nwe know it's coming\nso we can probably handle it we can\nhandle it i'm pretty\nsure we can wait what exactly am i doing\nthat makes them think that they can like\nwell like i'm really curious what could\ni even be doing like\nfor people to like think that they can\njust do something like that\nokay i'm just thinking about how i can\nanswer that\nyeah i'm just really curious\nso here's what happens in coaching\nrelationships and also in therapy\nokay so freud are you are you on an\nacademic answer because you're about to\nget an academic answer\ni i only went to high school that's fine\ni think you're okay okay so\nso freud basically noticed that\nwhen you're in a therapy relationship\nthat people will project feelings on\neach other\nand so a lot of what a therapist feels\nis like not a real feeling but it's like\nyou and the patient are acting out of\nplay\nso for example if you had issues of like\nbeing emotionally manipulated\nby your mom and you go see a female\ntherapist\nyou are going to feel emotionally\nmanipulated by her\nbecause like as you guys calm your mind\ndown and as you enter like an authentic\nspace and those feelings come up they're\ngoing to like want to target\ndoes that make sense it's just it's just\nweird\nand so sometimes in therapy what can\nhappen is that like so\nthis is something called erotic\ntransference or erotic counter\ntransference\nyou can even google it their papers\nwritten about it because it happens\nshockingly\na lot and what we find is that like\nsometimes feelings can get tangled right\nso so\ni i [ __ ] you not this is one of the most\nmind-blowingly abusive quotes i've ever\nheard\nbut one of my therapy supervisors once\nhad a therapy supervisor\nthat told them so there's like a boomer\nokay so like\na psychiatrist who was like around in\nthe 50s once said\nthe main thing to think about when you\nhave sex with a patient is whether\nyou're having sex for yourself or you're\ndoing it for them\noh interesting right so like it's all\n[ __ ] up\nbut this is where sometimes what happens\nis you get especially in a therapy\nrelationship you feel\nsuper connected to someone you feel like\nreally really close to them and then\nsometimes people\ndon't know like what to do with those\nfeelings of closeness\nand so it sort of starts to manifest in\nlike a sexual kind of way because\nthey're like\noh i feel so connected right and if you\nthink about sexuality like a lot of it\nis about emotional connection it can it\ncan get muddled it can get confusing\nand then sometimes people will like you\nknow\nget confused and therapists aren't\nperfect either\nand i do think that there's something\nabout the radiance that you display\nthat is like flies going to honey\ntowards like a\nparticular kind of person you have a\nparticular vulnerability that like gets\npeople to like leech onto you\num and this is the kind of thing where\nthat therapist is that's [ __ ]\nthat's terrible but like holy [ __ ] you\ncould see that coming from a mile away\ni feel really weird too because like\nwhen i kind of like\nmade excuses not to go there he would\nkind of like make me feel guilty for\nthat\nsee i told you he's gonna he's gonna do\nit to you\nyeah he's gonna make you feel guilty\nyeah\nthat's the some scar it's the whole like\nit's like\ntextbook right and that's where\nthat's where like with a good therapist\nwhat you should say if you guys are like\nhere's a little bit of education about\ntherapy\nif you guys are feeling reluctance to go\nsee your therapist\ntell them about it and this is where\nlike the right move as a patient is hey\ni feel i feel like there's a weird\nenergy here when i come here\nand it may be a little bit sexual just\nconfront them molina\nand say that i sometimes feel\nemotionally manipulated into coming here\nand i feel deeply uncomfortable about it\nthat'll bring awareness to it he also um\nhe also said that i didn't have to pay\nanymore and stuff that was really weird\nyeah\nboundary violations boundaries\nboundaries boundaries boundaries\nboundaries boundaries\nokay that's really weird that's\n[Music]\nboundaries it's all about boundaries\nokay\nso sometimes i will stop accepting money\nfrom people\nin a therapy relationship but never\nbecause i like them so much\nthe only reason that i stop accepting\nmoney is because people can't afford\nit in which case it's like i'm not gonna\nstop taking care of you as your doctor\njust because you're [ __ ] broke right\nso like they're they're like good\nreasons so that's also like a policy\nthat i lay out with people that i see at\nthe beginning\nbut yeah this sounds bad molina like\nyeah\nyeah and yeah that's why i started like\nto not really like open up a lot about\nhow i felt about things i don't know\neverything it feels like every single\ntime i start talking\nlike i don't know if he just feels like\nstuff like that happens\num do you feel emotionally manipulated\nby me\nno okay\ni don't think so if we keep talking\nit'll happen\nyou really thinks a lot absolutely and\nthat's when we could really work on it\nright so like when it comes up then we\nwould talk through it and you'd like\nlearn how to digest it\nso anyway more practical advice so how\ncan you move forward so first thing is\nis you know like i said think about\nboundaries\nbe a little bit more of an [ __ ] to\npeople early on in relationships\nyeah okay this is also something that is\nlike really weird\nit's like last time and this happens\nlike this is happening already so like\nlast time i talked to you there was so\nmany people that knows that they hurt me\nso much in the past\nwould like come back and try to like\ni don't know like be nice to me or\nsomething like that but then i would\njust realize that they wanted something\nas well so it was just like really weird\ntoo and like\ni don't know it's like and then i feel\nbad for like not rip\nyou know yeah and they know that too\nthey know that i'm feeling\nbad about it too yeah so this is where\nthey [ __ ] off like don't message me if\nyou hurt me [ __ ]\ni don't want anyone to do that after\nthis session okay [ __ ] off that's like\nhow i\nbecause i i can't do it i don't want to\ndo that yeah yeah yeah\nso let's talk about that okay so this is\ngreat so it's like the same patterns\nyou see that it's like patterns and\nthat's sort of good it sucks for you\nbecause it sounds awful\nbut it's also like hopeful because if\nthere's a pattern you and you change the\nwhole pattern\nyour entire life will start to be like\ndifferent\nso this is where like you know if people\ndo reach out to you afterward because\nthey hurt you and they're feeling guilty\nyeah you can have a mature i mean this\nis where i wouldn't tell them to go [ __ ]\noff\nbecause you can get some closure there i\nmean you can tell them to go [ __ ] off\nbut when you're ready i think it's\nuseful to have conversations about\nclosure\nyeah and you can say hey i haven't\ntalked to you in eight months just speak\nplainly okay i'm gonna give you a\nplaybook for this\nyeah okay so if they're watching this\nthey'll know the playbook too but this\nis good this is good\nso just speak plainly and be like be\nlike okay\nwhat is she doing no no this is good\nthis is good it's healthy it's healthy\nfor them too it's healthy for everybody\nso just be like hey i haven't heard from\nyou in eight months\nis there a particular reason that you're\nreaching out to me now\nand then they'll say they'll make some\nlike they won't actually say it they'll\nbe like oh i was just wondering how\nyou're doing\nthen you can you can say i'm doing okay\nthank you for asking\nperiod and then that's it\nif they want to engage in a conversation\nif they push it further you just let\nthem know how you feel and you can say\nhey i really felt like you know when we\nthe last time we talked like eight\nmonths ago you said some things to me\nthat i felt like were sort of like a\nbetrayal i'm a little bit confused\nabout what you want from this\nrelationship\nyeah and then if they and this is where\nlike you're you're gonna when you say\nthings like that you're gonna feel\nguilty because you're like oh my god i'm\nmaking them feel bad oh\nhow dare i tell them that they hurt me\nwhen they hurt me so much\ni can't tell them that they did that\nlook at how much of a [ __ ] i would be\nuh\nright but that's you need to be\nauthentic with them and just say hey\nwhat you did hurt me\nand then get like and then they can say\nwell that's because you were being a\n[ __ ]\nand then that like that's fine they can\ngo [ __ ] themselves right you'll see and\nsometimes they'll say that and then\nsometimes they'll say yeah i'm really\nsorry about that\ni'm sorry i hurt you it could be could\ngo either way but either way you get\nclosure\nand then if you also here's also thing\nthis is like so insane i had like one\nperson do this and then i found out that\nthis person\nwas just doing that to like try to get\ninformation\nabout me so they could go [ __ ] talk to\nother people about me or try to like sit\nand laugh and\nbasically it's like really weird i don't\nknow like yeah i don't know\ni don't know what about you why you\nattract all the drama [ __ ] i\ni don't know that is beyond my my\nexpertise but it's like really\nthere's like a part of it that is really\nlike this person like this person\n[ __ ] idiot and i can see like exactly\nwhat they're doing but then like i just\nfeel\nyou know like yeah they're bad so so i\nwouldn't i wouldn't tell them\nyou know if they're like hey melina how\nare you doing and if you say\nhey i can see what you're doing you're\nyou're being a [ __ ] manipulative\n[ __ ] and you're just trying to get\ninformation\nthat that's gonna make you sound like a\ncrazy lady yeah\nright it's like i was just asking you if\nyou wanted to\ncome on stream because we're playing\namong us like\nright so so just be like so you want to\ntest the waters right so you want to be\nauthentic and vague oh hey i haven't\nheard from you in a while what's going\non\nand then if the relationship advances\nyou can let them know hey\nyou know i'm not quite sure like where\nthis is gonna go because i still feel\nlike\npretty hurt and betrayed about like your\nactions eight months ago\nyou know are we gonna and just state it\nso this is another thing is like you\nlike i want to teach you a little jiu\njitsu trick okay\nverbal jiu-jitsu which is that you don't\nask questions you just make statements\nand then you just be silent and then you\nsee what they come back with some people\nmay\nauthentically want to repair their\nrelationship with you or they may want\nto have\nan authentic conversation about they\nfelt hurt and betrayed about something\nthat you did but then i think you guys\nshould\ntalk about it but the key thing is that\nwhen you feel that guilt like\ndon't give in to it don't do the\naction that alleviates the guilt\nbecause that's exactly what your mom\ntaught you to do that gets you into\ntrouble with her\nbecause then you you give in to the\nguilt and then you find yourself in a\nsituation that you detest\nokay so\nokay where was i all right so number one\nyou know set boundaries and don't it's\nactually on you i think you're the one\nwho's lacks on them and you let people\nget away with it\nyeah and then they're going to get\nfrustrated so be careful about that\nguilt early on when you set boundaries\nwork with a therapist or sign up for a\ncoach i think this is definitely the\nkind of thing that you should work on\nit's something that our coaches are\nactually pretty good at um\nand i think also the two aren't mutually\nexclusive so about\nmaybe 20 of people who come into\ncoaching\nwind up with a therapist because our\ncoaches will say hey i really think you\nshould see a therapist\nyou can do both of them if you want to\nwhatever\nbut i really think that you should you\nknow get a therapist\nor a coach or whatever just get some get\nsomeone\nwho owes you nothing right get someone\nin your life\nlike stephen or it sounds like sometimes\nyour mom is supportive\nbut that's tangled right so like you and\nstephen are gonna have other kinds of\ntensions on your relationship\nit also sounds like for whatever reason\nyou were confiding in bob instead of\nstephen which sort of makes sense\ni confide in people that are not my wife\nbecause she's my wife\nshe confides in people that are not me\nbecause problems in your relationship\nexactly and then you like\nto eventually yeah someone that is\npartner so i think it's going to be very\nhealthy for you to have someone\nin your life who\nthe boundaries are very clear you don't\nhave to do [ __ ] for them\nthere's no they're not sacrificing any\nviewership on stream by\nbeing your friend or anything like that\nwhere there's like one human being\nin your life that for one hour a week is\nthere for you\nin whatever you feel yeah\nyeah sounds good thoughts questions\nno i think this was really good\nyeah okay this is yeah it makes me like\na little bit more\nit's very easy like if i talk to stephen\nabout this he would basically just say\nlike don't\ndon't give a [ __ ] about what they think\njust move on and it's like okay\nlike i was supposed to like i mean i\nunderstand what you mean and you're\nright but like um\nbut it's kind of hard to just like feel\nthat right like it's just hard\nto do that so it feels good to like have\nsomeone explaining to me like how\nthings work then it's easier for me to\nlike understand myself and like know\nlike what to do like you think sounds\nlogical and what you say sounds logical\nto me\nyeah well i'm glad you found it useful\nmolina\num you know i think but like i'm really\nhopeful for you for what it's worth i\nthink you\nyou're a very different person than who\nyou were in april\ni'm sorry yeah\ninteresting you should go watch that\ninterview\ni hate watching myself i can't do that i\nhate watching myself too i can't watch\nit either\nbut anyway i never like if there's like\noh no there's a clip of me that's\npopular like\ni don't i i can't watch it either i\ndon't give a [ __ ] about what other\npeople think about me like that\nand i don't really care about hate or\nanything um but i\nyeah but i can't i can't watch i can\nhear my voice and i can't so\nso i think you've learned how to start\nputting yourself first and i think it's\ncomplicated you may be going too far you\nmay actually because i think there's one\nlast thing that i would mention which is\nthat\nyou know when people dislike you\nyou got to be really careful about these\nanswers like oh it's because they hate\nme like they may actually have a genuine\ncomplaint which may have merit\nright if people like want to get you\ncancelled like\ngot to be careful because i'm pretty\nsure that a lot of people who have\ngotten cancelled\nwould say the same thing which is like\noh haters going to hate they're trying\nto get me cancelled whereas like some of\nthem are really doing things that are\nout of line\nnow i can't envision you doing some of\nthe things but like\nyou know there may have there may be a\nlegitimate criticism in there i don't\nknow\nyeah it's just i it's just i don't know\nsometimes i just wonder like how people\ncan like i don't know i don't like\ncancer culture i really don't\nlike that at all i don't like it either\nbut yeah it's really weird it's a really\nweird thing\num i don't know it's really weird\nthe same people do that is it makes me a\nlittle sad\ni think to see that people want to try\nto do that because\nthe only thing they can see is like\nthey can't really see like what's going\non i guess so they can't like have\nany um they can't really see how the\nother person is like feeling about\nanything and they're seeing this like\nthis they're seeing if they try to\ncancel me they don't seem as a human\nthat's what it feels like yeah and\nthat's as literally\nreally weird because i try to see\neveryone is like i try to understand\neveryone you know\ni try to um that's why i feel also like\nguilty because i try to like understand\nall the time like why is this person\ndoing\nyeah but it's weird to like see that\npeople don't do that\nyeah i mean i have a weird response to\nthat which is like\ntrying to understand people all the time\nis\nbeing a saint it's not being a human\nso you should let yourself be human\njust like just assume the warriors\nhate them no not assume the worst and\nhate them but like let yourself feel\nhatred right because that's human\nyou have parts of your brain that are\nwired to help you feel hatred\nand so like let yourself feel the full\nrange of things\nand that's okay and i think you've been\nso this is kind of weird but like you\nknow if you take\na neutron and then you split it up into\na proton and an electron\nlike with that positive charge you\ncreate the negative charge\nand i think for a lot a lot of time\nmolina your positivity is like creating\nthis like\nkarmic negativity on the other side\nand so you know when you're like way way\ntoo positive with people like it winds\nup with like negative things\nyeah when you're overly forgiving overly\nindulgent\noverly enabling you create little brats\nas children right if you're like a\nparent so like just be a little bit\naware of that and it's okay to feel\nhatred it's okay to\nfeel those things don't let them dictate\nyour actions but don't let the guilt or\nthe other the positivity dictate your\nactions as well\nhmm yeah it's almost like um\ninteresting wait it's it's a it's like a\nlittle bit of the same feeling\nas like having sex with someone because\nyou feel bad for them\nit's not good to do that at all because\nsometimes you feel so bad for someone so\nyou're like oh yeah maybe i can do that\nlike you know like maybe i can just like\nlet him\nyou know that sounds so [ __ ] up but\nlike this is definitely a thing that i\nthink people do\nno i think it's a it's a good example of\nyou know doing something with good\nintentions that doesn't end well\nyeah it's like not good for anyone i\nthink but it's like i don't know um\nand molina i don't know how to say this\nbut if you're pity [ __ ] people\nyou know that may cause problems in your\ninner personal life\nyeah exactly especially with the people\nthat you're pity [ __ ]\ni'm not doing that i can't believe we've\nbeen talking about this for an hour and\na half and it comes down to pity [ __ ]\nnot doing that okay good for you yeah\nall right yeah and on that note\nno seriously though i think you're i\nthink you've grown a lot i think you\nstill have a lot of growing to do\num you know i think it's okay to feel\nhatred but also to really try to be like\nreflective of people's criticisms\nand really try to like find out about\nthis sort of things like early on like\ni'm only 22.\nso it's kind of nice to like yeah\nbecause i i assume like the\nchannel i mean maybe is this true like\nthe older you get the harder\nit's going to be to like get out of like\nold patterns\ntechnically yes\nbut in your case you've got eight to ten\nyears after which it gets hard\nyour brain is still pretty malleable for\nanother decade\nyeah i mean my brain is still growing i\nguess\nyep right yeah so maybe it's like good\nto like find out like old\nlike bad patterns like so i would say\ntechnically it does become harder\nlike according to our understanding of\nneuroscience but practically\ni've seen people who are 40 50 and 60\nchange\na lot yeah like patterns that they've\nlived with their entire life like\nturning them around in a year or two\nthat's really nice\nyeah that's cool that makes me happy to\nhear yeah okay\nso um i normally i ask people if they\nwant to meditate but i just don't know\nwhat it is about today i don't think i\ncan teach you meditation for which i\napologize\nthat's fine if you really really want to\nlearn it i can try to recalibrate myself\nand see what i can come up with but just\nsomething about\ni don't know what it is i'm just the the\nparts of my mind that access what\nmeditation is appropriate for people\nor is like not functioning right now\nokay\ni could try to do it if i if i um start\ntalking to someone do they do meditation\nas well\nthe coaches not much\nbut it's something that we're actually\ngonna do advanced training for them\num now so like they've learned a lot of\ngood stuff but\ni think the next thing that we're gonna\nteach them is like more meditation but\nas healthy gamer we're we're coming up\nwith\nadditional meditation resources yeah i\nthink meditation is so nice i just feel\nlike it's been really hard to like try\nto do something like that but i remember\num there was like i i came to some point\nin my life where i just felt really\nreally bad and then i just like took two\nweeks off from everything\nand the only thing that i did was like\nmoving my body like go on walks\ngo run uh meditated so much\ndid a lot of mushrooms so it was like\nevery i just like completely\ndisconnected from like\nmyself almost and just beca like step\nout of myself for like two weeks\nstraight\nand i felt really really good about\ndoing that but it yeah it's hard when it\ncomes to streaming because you feel\nstressed all the time like even if\nwhen you turn off the stream you feel\nlike you're still working you know\nyeah um okay i remember that\nthat was that was really nice so\nmeditation would be probably really\nreally good\nyeah yeah i'm sorry i just got nothing\ni can meditate on my own i think i think\nokay especially after like\nhearing you say these things it's like\nreally good for me too yeah because now\ni feel like you have a bigger\nunderstanding\nand that's really nice yeah okay like\ni was kind of like stuck in my head and\nnow you kind of like open up like a new\npath a little bit\nthat's i'm happy to hear that um i hope\nit's a fruitful path for you to walk\ndown i'm rooting for you\ni think i i think you're growing more\nthan you give yourself credit\nand for really nice yeah because i feel\nlike i'm just like\nlike i'm just going down there but maybe\nlike\ni don't know it's it's cool to hear that\nyou're telling me that\ni'm like growing but i'm just feeling\nbad because i'm growing\nyeah so that's that's the tricky thing\nright so growing isn't fun\nlike learning isn't fun\nyou know if you think about like a kid\nwho's like throws temper tantrums to get\ntheir way\nand they're learning how to not throw\ntemper tantrums to get their way\nit's not fun for the kid they want to\njust throw a temper tantrum and get\ntheir way they don't want to like\nrestrain their emotions and\nand grow so like growth is usually\nunfortunately painful\nwhich is why actually our learning\ncircuitry is very closely tied to our\nnegative emotion circuitry\nwhich is why if you like touch a hot pan\nyou'll learn like that\nright so in a weird way you know but\nanyway\nso good luck to you you know keep us\nposted\nand um you know if you do decide to go\nyou know definitely worthwhile to see an\nactual therapist but if you want to\ntake advantage of the coaching program i\nthink i already sent you some\ninformation about it but if you run into\ntrouble you can always let us know\nyou can also talk to your twitch account\nmanager about it\nokay yeah take care good luck\nyeah you too bye-bye you guys already\nmitch\noh is destiny streaming uh we'll raid\nmitch today we'll raid destiny on\non friday maybe or maybe we'll rate\nsomeone small find some tiny\ntiny tiny tiny tiny nut streamer"
