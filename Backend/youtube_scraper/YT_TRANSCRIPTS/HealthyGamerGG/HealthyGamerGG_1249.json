    "transcript": "and so today i wanted to talk to you\nguys a little bit about\nconscientiousness\nand so um i know this is kind of weird\nbut like i got this question a year ago\nlike literally like\na year ago or maybe even over a year ago\nand um i i know this sounds bizarre but\ni actually did not have an answer so\npeople\nkept on asking me like how do i improve\nmy conscientiousness\nso i've been working on it for like a\nyear and trying to figure out like\nreading papers on on personality\nassessment you know like reading\nsome of these old texts on yoga um\nand things like that so in trying to\nfigure out like okay how can we improve\nconscientiousness is there a way to do\nit\nso came up with a couple of theories and\nthen tried to test them out with a\ncouple of people over the last\nfew years what does it mean i know we'll\nwe'll um\nuh we'll get into i'll explain what all\nthat is and so then tested it with a few\npeople and it turns out that it actually\ndoes kind of work\nat least anecdotally so that's what i\nwant to kind of talk to you guys about\ntoday\nso this is going to be we're going to\nuse um you know like\ni'm going to draw a little bit so let's\nkind of dive in\nokay so the first thing to understand is\nthat\num so when we look at different kinds of\ndifferent people\nwe have different personalities or\ndifferent kind of cognitive traits or\nstyles\nand in the east we look at systems like\nayurveda or traditional chinese medicine\nwhich will use elements\nto describe what kind of person someone\nis um so they'll say that like for\nexample\na vata person is like a wind type and so\ntheir mind is like the wind so it\nit blows hard in one direction and then\nlike changes direction easily\nso vatas are people who get bored who's\neasily pick things up very quickly\nthey can be very passionate about things\nfor like 15 minutes and then it kind of\nlike\nyou know isn't stable isn't consistent\nso that's where the eastern system\nin the western system there's one really\ngood uh\nvalidated model of personality and that\nis the five\nfactor model and so the five factor\nmodel basically\nstudied people's personalities and what\nthey found using a technique called\nfactor analysis\nis that personality tends to cluster in\nfive different\ngroups okay so these groups are\nextraversion\nopenness agreeableness conscientiousness\nand neuroticism\nand so what do these five factors mean\nso extroversion\nis like how extroverted or introverted\nyou are\num so people who have high extraversion\nlike tend to get\nrelaxed with other people they draw\nenergy from other people\npeople who have low extroversion prefer\nto be like by themselves\num it doesn't necessarily have anything\nto do with how many friends you make or\nhow charismatic you are it's just sort\nof\nyou know what you prefer so openness is\nlike is a tendency to like\nopenness new experiences so you tend to\nbe like open-minded\nas opposed to like a little bit more\ntraditional\nagreeableness is like how likely you are\nto get along with other people and like\nkind of\nbe malleable or flexible with your\nthinking\nit doesn't mean that you're nice or mean\nit just means that like you kind of\nyou know are pretty like open mind uh\nyou're willing to sort of\nchange your views to accommodate others\num\nand then we get to conscientiousness so\nthis is kind of a big thing in the\ngaming community because people who like\nso this is a cool thing about the gaming\ncommunity is that a lot of people\nnowadays who like read the internet\nare actually like amateur psychologists\nwhich i think is fantastic so you guys\nyou know do\na lot of research you guys read a lot of\nstuff on the internet you watch\neducational videos and then one of the\nthings that comes up is this trait of\nconscientiousness so conscientiousness\nis your ability to sort of\nfocus on a task for extended periods of\ntime\num it also governs things like impulse\ncontrol so people with low\nconscientiousness tend to be impulsive\nand have trouble with follow-through\nwhereas people with high\nconscientiousness tend to be um\nyou know like disciplined organized and\nwill follow through\nand so um one of the interesting things\nis that like people tend to think that\ncertain\nattributes of uh you know certain\nattributes are better than others\nso generally speaking a lot of like the\ngaming community feels like they have\nlow conscientiousness and therefore they\nlike\nlost the lottery right so if you're kind\nof born or nurtured in\nin a way where your personality forms\nwith high conscientiousness\nyou're actually okay doing things like\ndelaying gratification working hard\nworking towards a goal and following\nthrough and then there's\nus who's like well we don't we're not\ngood at that i'm kind of lazy i'm\nundisciplined\nand so people ask me the question is we\nwere you know talking about the five\nfactors like how do i\nincrease my conscientiousness so that's\nwhen what today's lecture is going to be\nabout\nand the last uh attribute is actually\nneuroticism which is your tendency to\nworry so people may think that\nneuroticism which is like\nyour tendency to like suffer up here is\na bad thing\nand it certainly causes suffering but\nthere are a lot of things that show that\nneuroticism is actually an adaptive\ntrait\nso people with super low neuroticism are\nwhat i think of as like the classic\npothead\nlike sit around all day do nothing like\nnot really worry about anything like\nthey don't get worried about stuff\nthey're just super chill\nand so as a result they don't get\nmotivated to do things because\nyou know they don't really care about\nthe consequences\nand um so for example doctors or\nactually medical students\nis a better way to put it tests very\nhigh in neuroticism and hit very high in\nconscientiousness\nand the reason for that is because like\nthey were the kids that were worried\nabout getting a b\non a test when they were in college\nwhich pushed them to study like on\nfriday nights\ninstead of going to parties and they're\nalso kind of hard working so like\nthat combination of traits is what sort\nof allows people to like\nbe successful medical students or get\ninto medical school\nso it's not like high neuroticism is\nbetter than low neuroticism and oddly\nenough it's not like\nlow conscientiousness is better than\nhigh conscientiousness\nbut in our society we tend to select\nor reward people who have high\nconscientiousness\nso that gets to the crux of today's\nlecture which is that if i have low\nconscientiousness\nam i sol am i screwed\nor is there something that i can do to\nboost conscientiousness\nand so people basically think if i have\nlow conscientiousness like\nyou know i drew the short straw in life\nwhat can i do about it\nso it took me a little while um\nbut it actually turns out that you can\nimprove conscientiousness\nor at least i think so and here's the\nbest way that i've been able to kind of\nfigure out how\nokay so let's start by thinking about\nwhat actually happens in the mindset of\nsomeone who has low conscientiousness\nokay\nso um when we're thinking about like\nconscientiousness like\noh sorry yes let's think about low\nversus high conscientiousness\nso let's say that like it's a wednesday\nafternoon and i'm done with my classes\nand i've got two choices\ni can play apex legends or\ni can study for my like test next\ntuesday\nright and so in the mind of someone who\nhas high conscientiousness it's a little\nbit easier\nfor them to study instead of like play a\ngame and\num if we think about it like i have two\nimpulses right so like one\nimpulse is like what i want to do and\none impulse\nis like what i don't want to do we're\nnot going to say it's good for me or not\ngood for me because the first thing to\nunderstand is like\nthe impulses are what's what i want to\ndo and what i don't want to do\nand so you kind of get distracted um and\nyou end up going towards ipex legends\nright so if you have high\nconscientiousness you choose the thing\nthat you don't want to do\nyou have low conscientiousness you\nbasically give in to the thing that you\nwant to do\nso you have this impulse to play a video\ngame and you give in to it\nso if we kind of think about it is there\nany way to train ourselves\nto do what we don't\nor not not do what we don't want to do\nis there any way to train ourselves\nto avoid doing the thing that we want to\ndo\nand there's kind of a a subtle answer\nwhat we really mean by that is\nis there anything that i can do that\nwill\nset myself and what i want aside\nbecause that's basically what we're\ndoing right so if i want to play a video\ngame that's like prioritizing me\nand like can we set that thinking aside\nin favor of something else\nhow do we train our minds to set aside\nwhat we want\nin favor of like what's good for us and\nso the subtle thing there\nis that it's not necessarily a choice\nbetween what's\ngood for me and what i want it's just\nthe key act if you look at the cognitive\nact it's actually setting aside what you\nwant which is the important thing it's\nthe impulse control\nwhich is the important thing and so\nconscientiousness is associated with\nwith higher degrees of impulse control\nand so the funny thing is that the\nanswer is actually right in the word\nokay so if we think about\nconscientiousness what do we when we\nthink about a person who's conscientious\nwhat does that mean right so if we think\nabout like what are the different term\nwhat are the different ways in which we\nuse that term to describe people\nso the first okay so people say\naware conscious so it's not necessarily\nconscious\nright so it's it's like they think about\npeople who are like hard-working\nbut when when she think when we also\nthink about we think about people who\nare caring like so if we think about a\nperson who's like very conscientious\nthat person is like\nthoughtful about other people and so the\nfunny thing\nthere's a really simple way to do to\nboost conscientiousness which is just to\nbe\nthoughtful for other people or to i know\nit sounds kind of weird but like to just\nbe a nice person\nto be a good person to try to put other\npeople first to be selfless\nand so this is really subtle because if\nyou think about it like when i do\nsomething for someone else like let's\nsay i've got like\na pizza right and i've got like this a\nwhole pizza to myself\nand if i think about it i'm sort of like\nokay well let me think about what i can\ndo for someone else\ni can eat the whole pizza myself or i\ncan share the pizza with someone else\nand in that moment i have an impulse\nlet's say it's eat the pizza all by\nmyself\nand what i'm doing when i when i care\nabout other people in a very like\nthoughtful and deliberate way\nis i'm setting aside my own impulses so\ni want you guys to think\nabout helping other people and how\nhelping other people\nalmost certainly comes at a cost to\nyourself\nright you have to give something up in\norder to help someone else\nso if you share something that you have\nyou know you lose half of it if i\nhave a friend who's sick and i make them\nlike you know chicken noodle soup or\nwhatever like\nlentil stew whatever and i like bring it\nover there i lose like an hour two of my\ntime i can't play video games during\nthat time\ni have to go and do something for\nsomeone else i essentially expend\neffort at a cost to myself for the\nbenefit of another person\nand i know it sounds kind of weird but\nif you really look at what happens in\nthe mind of someone who helps another\nperson\nthere's a really really key common\nelement\nwhich is the avoidance or restraining\nyour impulse to benefit yourself\nright so if i do anything that's nice\nfor someone else it has to come at a\ncost to me\nand that's actually a really wonderful\nthing because that is what allows us\nto train conscientiousness okay\nso let's kind of think about that so\nthen like the tricky thing about the\npersonality models\nis that um you know people also look at\nthings like empathy right\nand so they say oh isn't helping other\npeople\nempathy isn't that what makes you an\nempathic human being and the short\nanswer is\nnot really and this is why it's a subtle\nthere's a lot of nuance here\nso empathy is the capacity to feel\nwhat someone else is feeling and so\npeople who are naturally\nempathic naturally like or more helpful\ntowards other people\nthat's not what we're talking about\nright so what i'm actually talking about\nthe best example of what i'm talking\nabout\nis the altruistic sociopath so i don't\nknow if you guys know this but\nsociopathy is another like personality\nkind of scale it doesn't really fit into\nthe five factor model or\nit maps onto the five factor model in\nits own way it's sort of like low\nagreeableness maybe a certain amount of\nconscientiousness\nbut the altruistic sociopath is actually\nlike what we're going to look at to\nunderstand this\nso i don't know if you guys know this\nbut there are a lot of people who are\nlike really really good people who are\nnot\nempathic they just choose to be good\npeople\nso i've worked with some of these people\nand a lot of times like the problem with\nsociopaths is that\nthe ones that get like so if you look at\nincarceration rates and stuff like that\nsociopathy is like higher in a prison\npopulation but the tricky thing there\nthere's there's some\nevidence that suggests that like the\nsociopaths who wind up in prison\nare the ones that like get caught and\naren't actually very good at it\num and so they actually may have like a\nlower iq so so you it is possible to\nhave these like altruistic sociopaths\nand i\nsee these a lot so i work with a lot of\nc-suite executives and these people test\nvery highly on the sociopathy scale\ni myself test highly on the sociopathy\nscale psychiatrists actually routinely\ntest highly on the sociopathy scale\nsurgeons test highly on the sociopathy\nscale\nit's kind of strange right so if you\nthink about what what is it that\nwhy are psychiatrists high on the\nsociopathy scale it's because in a sense\nwe have\nlike a very protective or low level of\nempathy and what i mean by that is that\nlike\nwhen i'm sitting with someone with\ndepression i can't let that person's\ndepression\nlike wash over and affect me i actually\nneed a barrier or it helps\nif like i can look at their depression\nlike clinically without feeling\nsad like with them and then feeling like\nhelpless with them\nso instead of feeling feeling that\nempathic helplessness it's actually\nprotective for me to like\nbe insulated from that and so if you\nlook at an altruistic sociopath what you\nsee is someone who\ndoes a lot of things for other people\nbut\nalso doesn't do it because of empathy\nso they do it sort of cognitively right\nso what they do is like eat\nup here what they say is like they wake\nup in the morning and they're like okay\nwhat can i do\noh this will be like something i can do\nfor someone else and like that's a good\nthing\nit's not based on a feeling it's sort of\nbased on a cognitive process\nof choosing to set someone else\nabove you okay and so this is the key\nthing about boosting conscientiousness\nis people look at it and they say like\nokay\nit's hard for me to train myself to like\nnot watch youtube and study ahead\ninstead i completely agree that's really\nhard it's like fighting an uphill battle\nthe trick is to use altruism\nis your tool like that's going to be\nessentially like the weights that you\npractice with\nright so what i want you guys to\nunderstand is that if your conscientious\nis low\nconscientiousness is low do stuff for\nother people\nvery simply right so in that process\nwhat you're gonna have to do is set\naside\nparts of yourself in favor of other\npeople and by doing that what you're\ngonna train\nin your mind is the capacity to set\naside what you want\nand so and the cool thing is if you look\nat the gaming population like\nthis is actually something that's really\nawesome about us is that we actually\nare really good at helping other people\nlike you guys can get off your ass if it\ninvolves like doing something\nsubstantive for someone else so if we\nlook at that motivational hump\nthat you need to get over to train your\nconscientiousness\nonce you throw someone else into the\npicture it actually becomes a lot easier\nso just to kind of summarize you can\nabsolutely\ntrain conscientiousness and the way that\nyou do it is by being\na conscientious human being which is to\nbe like\nnice towards other people and to try to\ndo things for them\nand the really fascinating thing about\nthis discovery is that this is not like\na new idea right so\nif you really think about it like in the\neastern or karmic religions they talk\nabout karma\nor karma and what they say is like what\ngoes around comes around right so they\nsort of say that\nif you do good things for other people\nlike your life will be improved\nand that's really weird right so like if\nyou want to assume there's some sort of\nlike\ncosmic principle or god or someone who's\nlike\nyou know using omnipotence to benefit\npeople that they deem to be good\nthat system sort of makes sense but we\ndon't really have any\nevidence of any of that so let's just\nscrap all that sort of religious stuff\nlet's try to understand is there like an\nactual worldly observation\nthat supports this theory of karma which\nis that like if you do\ngood by other people your life will be\nimproved and the funny thing is that\nthis revelation about conscientiousness\nis like the perfect\nlink that explains that because what the\ntheory of karma essentially discovered\nlike thousands of years ago\nwas that when i do things for other\npeople i am in training my\nconscientiousness\nand by doing things for other people i'm\ntraining my mind to be\nmore restrained i'm training my mind to\nnot be a victim to my own desires\ni'm training my mind to be less\nimpulsive\ni am being the controller of my mind\ninstead of the mind being the controller\nof me\nand what they realize is that the people\nwho consistently do things for other\npeople\nwill i don't know if they put these two\npieces together but they made the\nobservation that people who consistently\ndo things for other people\ntheir lives start to improve and the\nreason for that is really simple it's\nbecause as you train your\nconscientiousness\nlike you're able to study more easily\nyou're able to like\nwork harder and clean and be like have\nbetter discipline and better follow\nand then naturally as a consequence of\nthat happening then people like start\ndoing better in their jobs they start\ndoing better in their families they\nstart\nlike they start being more respected\nlike there are a lot of positive things\nthat come out of that\nand so it's it's really kind of\nfascinating because like the last thing\nthat i just\nkind of want to say is that it's\ninteresting that karma is like so you\nspecific\nand what i mean by that is like how on\nearth in a cosmic\nlevel does me like helping a lady with\nher groceries\nimprove my life like that doesn't make\nany sense\nright there's no like cosmic energy that\nis going to like wrap around and get to\nme like we don't have any evidence of\nthat so if we look at it\nhow does the theory of karma work it the\nonly way the theory of karma\ncan work is actually through you because\nyou're the only common element\nlike if i help an old lady over here and\nthen my life gets better over here\nwhat's the dot that connects\nthese two things it's you and so the\nmedium\nof action for karma must be the\nindividual\nand once we realize that then we realize\noh [ __ ] like that makes perfect sense\nright because\nnow if we look at the the medium of like\nhow we improve our lives through helping\nothers it has to be through us\nthere has to be a change within our\nbrain or body but let's assume brain\nbecause that's usually what\nyou know is responsible for stuff so\nthere had you know there has to be a\nchange in your brain\nthat connects helping an old lady with\nher groceries with like improving your\nlife\nand i think that missing link is\nliterally this this piece of\nconscientiousness\nso it's really fascinating because you\nknow if we look at like how to improve\nyour life\nwe've got this like theory that's\nthousands of years old\nwhich has sort of survived the test of\ntime right so if you think if you look\nat it\nlike there's a darwinian effect for\nconcepts\nin human history so the concepts that\ntend to be like more reliable and\nsuccessful will be the ones that get\npropagated through time\nand the concepts that are like not\nreliable\nwon't get propagated through time right\nso if you look at religions for example\nlike horus and zeus aren't like\nany better than like you know whatever\ngod\nwas around like you know in other\ncultures so there's like\nthere's a sense that religions will be\nborn and die because\nthose particular like figures won't\ndon't add anything it's some of these\ncore concepts from religion which will\nactually last through time\nso the theory of karma has been saying\nthis for thousands of years and what i\nthink is super cool\nis that now that we understand\npersonality analysis we see this\ninteresting link\nthat okay so the conscientiousness and\ndoing things for other people and\nimproving your own life\nactually is like kind of explained\nthrough our current understanding\nof like validated science around\npersonality\nso at the end of the day how do you\nimprove your life\nhow do you improve your\nconscientiousness how do you become a\nhard\nworker when you can't restrain your\nimpulses and you can't do it for\nyourself\nyou recruit a certain amount of altruism\nyou recruit doing it for someone else\nand when you do it for someone else\nliterally what you have to do is set\naside what you want or things that\nbenefit you\nare giving in to your impulses for the\nsake of another human being\nand the more you do that you train your\nmuscle that sets aside your impulses\nand the more you train your muscle to\nset aside your impulses\nthe more conscientious you will become\nthe more conscientious you become\nthe more you will be able to study and\nlike work\nand read instead of playing video games\nor watching youtube\nor netflix or whatever and that's really\nlike it's that simple so i've been\nyou know i put this theory together like\nabout six seven months ago\nand i've been piloting it with a couple\nof the clients that i work with and it\nactually seems to be working pretty well\nthat when people start to put themselves\nlike second instead of putting\nthemselves first\nin their interpersonal relationships\nthey start to like do things like\nthere's one person i was working with\nthat\nhas a degree and hasn't had a job in\neight years so they like finished their\ndegree and they like never got a job\nand you know for a little while they\nwere just working on repairing their\ninterpersonal relationships and like now\nthey have a job using their degree for\nthe first time\nand it's like it's night and day for\nthem so here's what i'd say\nyou know hopefully this works but this\nis where you guys have to try it out\nright\nso like this is where i can propose to\nyou guys i mean\ni'm not the speaker of truth this is\njust the hypothesis that i've come up\nwith which i feel pretty confident about\nbecause i think it's sort of supported\nby like eastern theory and western\nscience\nit's sort of anecdotally tested in like\nhalf a dozen of people\nand based on my own explorations of mine\nand frankly\nthe healthy gamers so i'm also a great\nexample of this where i have low\nconscientiousness\nright so like i suck at this stuff i\nhave a vata mind\nand so if you think about it what is it\nthat keeps me motivated is like thinking\nabout you guys\nso like over the last week i've written\n31 000 words of like maybe a non-fiction\nbook and like what motivates me to do\nthat\ninstead of playing video games it's the\nidea that like oh my god\nlike i may die in like a year or two\nyears or five years or 10 years\nand it would be a real pity if i spent\nall my time learning this stuff\nand like some random accident happened\nand like i didn't\nyou know like it's weird like i was like\nthinking about that and like i only have\na limited amount of time on this earth\nso i better\nget busy because i won't be around\nforever right and i don't mean that to\nbe like\nyou know i don't want people to get sad\nand stuff i mean it's like it's really\nlike a cognitive sort of thing\nthis is where thankfully the sociopathy\nwithin me is it's nice because i can sit\nwith that thought like without\ngetting overwhelmed it's just like a\nreal practicality right\nbut it's actually thinking about you\nguys that motivates me to work like it's\nit's thinking about you guys and trying\nto help other human beings\nthat restrains my conscientiousness\nwhich is like pretty low because i'm a\nsupervisor person\nright i'm bad at follow through and all\nthat kind of good stuff too\nand so it kind of works so i encourage\nyou guys to test it out\nright so like try it out for yourselves\nand see what happens if you start\nputting other people first\nand if you do put other people first\nlike notice what's happening in your\nmind when you do that\nnotice that every time you put someone\nelse first you have to put yourself\nsecond\nand that putting yourself second is\nsetting aside that impulse\nand so every time you do that you're\ngetting a little bit stronger you're\ngaining a little bit of xp\nyou're leveling up just a tiny well\nyou're not leveling up because that's\nlike you know incremental\nbut you know you're getting xp and then\nlike what you'll do is you'll notice a\nlevel up\nat some point right like you'll notice\nthat like oh wow i'm actually able to\nlike clean my room now because\nit's weird i wasn't able to do that\nthat's a level up i'm actually able to\nput together my resume i'm actually able\nto apply for the job i'm actually able\nto\nlearn this extra thing that i've always\nwanted to learn like if you're a\nprogrammer and you like we're like oh\ni'd really like to learn this and you\nnever get around to it\nso try and put other people first and if\nit doesn't work as a diablo the divine\nhas a great question\nif it doesn't work shocking in the\nmeantime with your failure you have made\nthe world a better place\noh [ __ ]\nsucks um if you guys want to work\nthrough some of this stuff right so we\nteach these concepts the whole reason\nthat we have a coaching program\nis so that like you can work with a\ncoach to actually like problem solve\nyour particular issues\nand um kind of work through those things\nlike with someone and then like it tends\nto be pretty effective\nso coaching is a great way to sort of\nexplore\nlike testing and improving your\nconscientiousness overcoming laziness\num figuring out like how to implement\nchanges in your life and things like\nthat\nthey'll also help you find a little bit\nabout your dharma and all that kind of\ngood stuff\n[Music]\nokay\n[Music]\nuh"
