    "transcript": "i have a lot of those i have some crazy\n[ __ ] stories the craziest thing about\nthat\nstory train is that when you said you\nsaw a pair of\nass cheeks clapping i was like what\nhow you doing bro good good good you\nknow just uh\nyou know had a late night playing rust\nand uh\nyou know get some gambling on there and\nyou know hey\nlet's just say you know uh\nluck wasn't on my side last night wait\nso i heard something about this there\nwas some kind of like rust server or\nsomething that came out\nor something yeah what's the deal there\ncan you fill me in\npretty much um offline tv they created\nthis\num server for streamers on rust\nso everyone can collaborate you know get\ntogether and stream the game and\nthat's kind of what it is so we just get\non and it's just all streamers and\nwe just kind of and rust is like where\nyou guys like\nlike people like it's people like attack\neach other and stuff right\nyeah it's like a yeah it's like a\nsurvival game i guess survival some [ __ ]\nyeah it's not\nsurvival i don't know and where does the\ngambling come in\nwell you can so the current well i don't\nknow if it's a currency but there's this\nstuff called scrap\ni guess that's the equivalent to the\ncurrency in the game and\num there's this wheel and you can gamble\nit\nmake a wish oh for the eyelash i like\nthat\nit's a middle eastern stuff right i\nthink so\nyeah yeah so you know\nhey yeah i pretty much go with the risky\nbets you know\nthe one is pretty much like a 52 chance\nof landing you double up everyone does\nthat but you know i'm only going 20 10\nand five which is like the rarest ones\nbut hey you know big risk big reward go\nbaker go home right\ngo big or go home you know absolutely\nman yeah\nso train a couple things i was hoping\ntoday i know we we've sort of been\nwe've mentioned addiction a couple of\ntimes i i think you had alluded to\na few stories or experiences that you\nhad that we never really got into\num yeah so i was really hoping to hear\nabout that today and just what your\nexperiences have been\ni think uh that could be really helpful\nfor other people to kind of hear about\nand the second thing is just from a time\nlimit standpoint um i have to teach\nuh in one hour and 45 minutes um\nso i i really have to stop because\nthere's going to be a you know classroom\nfull of people waiting for me\num okay i should i shouldn't be late for\nthat so\num apologies if i if i have to stay a\nlittle bit more focused today\nso how long do we have an hour and 45\nminutes\nperfect if we're gonna meditate and\nstuff then then we have to save time for\nthat\nyou know if ends up it ends up being\njuicy we could do media you know\ni'll do meditation on my own sure\nabsolutely\nbut let's dive in baby yeah let's do it\nso tell me\nyeah i think uh where where i where we\nhad left off is i think maybe you were\ngoing to college\nlike we talked a lot about kind of your\nupbringing and stuff like that\nand then um you had sort of alluded to\nsubstance use at certain times but i\ndon't think we ever talked about that\nyeah i think um so\nmy entire life um\ni've kind of just been like a dreamer\nyou know i've never really been grounded\nyou know feeling the ground i've always\nbeen you know flying high\num you know no pun intended um\nand i've always been a dreamer i've\nalways\nyou know\ni've always you know um it's what i'm\nlooking for\ni've always\ni'll choose a different word but it's\nnot a good enough word but\ni've always kind of grasped on to the\n0.01\nhope that something could possibly exist\nthat is you know outside of\nwhat we understand to be like you know\npossible or probably whatever the case\nmight be right\nand like that's just kind of me right\ni'm living in my head and\num you know in high school a lot of my\nfriends they\nthey knew how to live in the moment and\nyou know they could be failing all their\ncourses they could be\nbroke getting kicked out and somehow you\nknow\nwhen they'd come over and do a sleepover\nyou know i would turn around and they'd\nbe sleeping with a smile on their face\nyou know and i'm sitting here busting my\nass you know getting good grades doing\nthis preparing for college\nand i'm stressed i mean you know i'm\nanxious\nand i guess i've kind of always been\nbored with the way things are with the\nway\nthings what the way people tell you that\nthings are right i've always wanted to\nkind of just venture outside of that\ni've i've wanted to find the economy on\nthe status quo\nyeah i've wanted to find the yeah the\nadventure and the magic in the world\nright sure so to speak\nyou know like uncharted lands uncharted\nterritory that\nisn't on a map that can't be you know\nseen on radar some crazy [ __ ] right\nand which is which is kind of\ninteresting for a second because it\nseems like\nyou know in high school you were kind of\nwalking the\nthe narrow path of a good iranian boy\nyou know getting the grades studying\nhard\nno no no no no definitely not no no in\nhigh school\nno in high school definitely uh no\nno no in high school i was\ni've been i've been pretty insecure\nprobably up until like my\n26 27th birthday issue i'd say i've been\nvery very insecure i've always i've\nnever been like\ni've always wanted to like\nnaturally like how i am it was it\nwhat i was trying to be by fitting with\nothers i had naturally but i didn't\nrecognize that right because i didn't\nhave that self-love\ni i you know i hadn't gone through like\na self-reflection or\na journey you know to really discover\nmyself\nand love myself and accept myself and\nthrough that i was just like a chameleon\njust fitting in\ntrying to fit in different groups find\nmy place uh\nfind out who i was anyways so\nback to the adventure stuff um a piece\nof me has always crept chaos\ni've always craved chaos you know i just\nwhat is there something uh craving chaos\nis like just craving a disorder craving\nsome sort of\nstoryline almost like creating problems\nfor yourself\nthat perpetuates some sort of like\nit creates like a purpose like some sort\nof\nyou know like because like we kind of go\nabout life we just kind of go like\nrobots right you go to school you come\nhome you do your homework you dinner you\ngo to bed\nright you grow up you get to go to\ncollege you get a job you're married you\nhave kids right it's just this like\nstale\ntimeline the stale schedule kind of\nadrenaline\nsurvival a reason exactly there is\nsomething a little more you know like\nthere's a storyline there that there's\nthere's something\nyou know so i've always kind of craved a\nlittle bit of care or i've craved a lot\nof chaos in my life\nand i think i think that was kind of the\nentryway into\nsome of the hard drugs i've done which\noccurred through college i\ni think i first dabbled in the hardest\nof drugs\nprobably well i'd say i started freshman\nyear with like a little bit of like soft\nmedium drugs and then i went into like\nsophomore junior i went some hard drugs\ncan you help me understand how you\nclassify\nsoft drugs medium drugs and hard drugs\nuh a medium drug to me is like xanax\nhard drugs like percocet oxycontin\nheroin meth\nmedium drugs xanax you know vicodin\ni'd say i don't know and then soft drug\ni don't know\nweed i don't know okay and\nyou know train if i ask you anything\nthat you don't feel comfortable\nanswering you just\ni'm comfortable and the drug topic\nuncomfortable\num because i think it is just important\nto understand like your terminology so\nyou were saying like\nsoft drugs is marijuana um medium drugs\nyes\nis like benzos like xanax did you say\nvicodin was a medium drug\nuh i'd say vicodin is actually low-key\nweaker than xanax xanax is actually\n[ __ ] dangerous low-key so that's\nthat that's right a little bit harder\nit's just like that's like one of those\nthings that's like\nit's everywhere it's like it's become so\nnormalized that you don't see it as this\nhard drug but xanax is definitely bad\ni'd say it's\ni think it's worse than vicodin to be\nhonest but then again i guess watching\ndr house that's not the case\nso yeah so so it occurs to me that maybe\num\nyou know maybe we need to just do a\nlittle bit of public education i may try\nto put something together just a little\nbit about\nwhat 100 please do different drugs so\none thing just so\neveryone knows this is super dangerous\nso first of all you know\ni don't i really don't recommend any\nkind of substance use at all really ever\num the the couple of things that really\nget people into trouble\nare just as an addiction psychiatrist\ni've seen this\ntime and again where sometimes we'll\npeople will use a particular dosage\nand then if they get sober for a while\nthey'll go back to their old dosage and\nthat can actually be lethal\nand then i've had patients uh die or\noverdose because of that\nand the second thing is that drug\nclasses should really never be mixed\nthat exponentially increases the danger\nso if you use benzodiazepines and\nopiates together\nyour chances of death are way higher\nbecause they sort of synergistically act\nto suppress your breathing and things\nlike that\num so so really i mean first of all\ndon't do drugs and be super careful\nbecause a lot of times people feel like\nthey can handle it and and they can't\nwhich is why it's such a problem but\num just a couple of quick points but i i\nhear what you're saying so just to kind\nof recap\nmarijuana is a soft drug um medium drugs\nit sounds like xanax and then\nthen the opiates and you you classify\nmeth as a hard drug\ni'd say so do you know do you have a\nsense of like when you started using\nanything\nsheesh i smoked my first blunt cell from\nyour high school\nand do you have a sense of like what got\nyou into it\nfriends and like just kind of\nlike peer pressure or i don't know i'm\ngoing to be honest it smelled\nreally good you know it's kind of it's\nkind of cigarettes right\ncigarettes smell really good but like\nthey just taste like [ __ ] right there's\nterrible\nweed it has that smell where you just\nwant to eat it you literally just want\nto eat it\nright but it's like it's it's it doesn't\nactually taste like that when you write\nsome [ __ ] like that's what i'm assuming\nright yeah\nyeah so you don't hear pressure probably\nyeah well no it's it's actually\ninteresting so that may not be peer\npressure\num so this is something that a lot of\npeople don't know is that\nyou know so i remember the first time i\nhad a beer i thought it was disgusting\neven now when i have a beer i think it's\ndisgusting i had one sip of alcohol\nyesterday and i found it to be\nabsolutely foul and abysmal\nand then some of the the people i've\nworked with will say that when they had\ntheir first\nsip of alcohol it tastes delicious\nit's like like so so oddly enough\nthere's some evidence that based on\nhow your brain is wired i've never\nreally thought about smell but\nthe taste of things like alcohol can be\nsuper super appealing\nlike your taste buds are wired like if\nyou have that\nbiological predisposition to being\nvulnerable to like alcohol addiction\nalcoholism\nyeah it will taste amazing the first\ntime you try it\nyeah i've heard of that and and i'm not\nquite i've never really thought about\nthis with marijuana but i i wonder if\nthere's something similar where like\nsomething in your brain is like oh that\nscent is like\nthat has some of the chemical compounds\nthat like i really really want\nnever really thought about it that way\nbefore but it's interesting i've never\nheard someone\nyou know say that the first time i\nsmelled marijuana i like really wanted\nto eat it\nit's kind of it's kind of an interesting\nyeah\nyeah yeah that's it maybe yeah\nand so it sounds like you started using\npot in high school anything else in high\nschool\nwell i i wasn't really using pot like i\nwasn't like\ni wasn't one of those pod head kids so i\nplayed\ndude don't lose it this time bro no i\nthink it's in my eye low key\nbut anyways i wasn't one of those\nbecause i played varsity soccer from\nfreshman year all the way to senior year\nso like i was\nconstantly doing conditioning constantly\nyou know\ntraining just just blink because when\nyou're watching\nno no yeah yeah but i have contacts oh i\ndon't know\nthat's what's going to change anything\nso when i blink and there's eyelash in\nthere and it gets mixed with eye contact\nor just slip underneath and it's even\nworse\nokay sorry yeah i didn't realize no\ndon't be sorry it's okay\num because a lot of times the way your\neyelid is\nis designed is it pushes the hair\ntowards the middle\nwhen it closes yeah it's not\nmean or so available it sounds like in\ncollege you started experimenting with\nlike soft to medium\nyeah well i kind of fell out of the weed\nthing you know\ni don't know when like junior of high\nschool you know i started kind of\nthat that was the point where i you know\ni think everyone hits a point where\nyou hit a stage in your life if you're\nlucky i think\nright because some people just kind of\nstay\nyou know whatever but i think it hits a\nstage in the life where they start\noverthinking right they start\noverthinking they trip themselves out\nand i hit that i hit that phase so\nanyhow i'd smoke i just overthink i just\nyou know freak myself out for no [ __ ]\nreason you know what i mean\nand i just stopped that all around right\nbut\ni just yeah so marijuana stopped and\nthen\ni think my freshman year i started\n[ __ ] around some xanax\nyou know i do the mixing stuff you\ntalked about was bad which is like\ndrinking\nthat terrible and then the sense of\nwhat pulled you towards that train i\nwould just say\njust the\ncollege i mean i don't know it was kind\nof the party life\nyou know everyone was kind of just i\ndon't know you know it was something\nyou'd see at a blue mountain state\nyou know some chick you know you know\ndown getting crazy in the bathroom\ni'm saying pop one of those take a shot\nstart [ __ ] you know kind of like one\nof those crazy things right\nkind of happens and then from there\nyou're like damn this feels good\nand you want to feel that again right\nbut you can never feel that again\nbecause\nthe whole trick joe was chasing that but\nanyways\nyeah i don't really like it too much to\nbe honest i mean it feels good at the\nmoment but hey\nthat xanax hangover that is terrible\nthat oh man that feeling can we rewind a\nlittle bit i\ni didn't understand some of what you\nsaid and\nand maybe that's because i just can't\nrelate to some of the experience there\nbut um what is that what do you mean by\nthe trick\noh the trick so it's like you know i\nmean it's especially in like\nespecially in opiates right but this i\nthink applies to any drug right like\nwhen you take it for your first time\nwhat you're gonna feel is just\nabsolute euphoria greatness amazingness\nunstoppableness right and then from\nthere on\nright after a couple more times you\nmight feel that way and then from there\non you start building a tolerance\nright and then you're kind of chasing\nthat original high you're chasing the\ndragon\nright so you take more you take more you\nmix this mix that\nbut you never really hit it until you\n[ __ ] your life up right so that's what i\nmeant by chasing the high\ngot it yeah and and so\ni'm just curious i mean you mentioned\nearly on that you were kind of insecure\nthat you craved chaos\n[Music]\nyou would kind of frame the discussion\nwith those at the beginning yeah go\nahead\nyeah those aren't connected i just want\nto make it clear because i still crave\nchaos but\nyeah okay i mean are either of those\nconnected with kind of like\nyou know the freshman party lifestyle\nmaybe how you felt about yourself\nthe insecurity yeah 100 i'm not really a\npartier\nbecause i'm not really a party like what\ni am is\nbecause you sound like one hell of a\nparty or dude yeah i'm\nlisten i can have a good time right you\nknow\ni think to this day still i've thrown\nyou know the best party at a convention\nso like i don't have a good time i'm\npersian you know persians we love to\nparty we let's have a good time\nbut i'm more of like a you know hang out\nwith\nyou know the three kids in science class\nin grandma's basement do some science\nexperiments eat some chips watch some tv\nplay a board game\nthat's me it doesn't look like me but\nthat's what i enjoy\npartying it's not me it's just it's so\ntiring it's just it's just tiring like\nany like it's the crazy part we talked\nabout last time you know i'm a very\noutgoing person you know i\ni excel in any social situation you\nthrow me into a bin of strangers and\ni'll come out you know friends with all\nof them but\nman it is is it tiring because like when\ni go into these i don't\nsee it like i don't see it for like\nso for example at a party if you go to a\nparty right i don't see a party as just\npeople having a good time\ni'm looking and it's just like\neveryone's\nlike everyone's trying to forget\neveryone's trying to uh push something\nthat they need to do\naway they're miserable they're sad\nthey're depressed no one's actually\neveryone's fronting do you understand\nlike maybe there's a few people have\ntheir [ __ ] together and they're actually\nhaving a good time one time they're\ngonna go back and study tomorrow\nbut it's like it's just it's just a\ncesspool of [ __ ] it's the same with bars\nright like for me\nyou know i worked in the bars for a bit\nand when i look at a bar\nor a club it just looked so gloomy to me\neveryone else saw this fun\nescape let's have you know let's go you\nknow this that adventure\nto me it was just this it was a trick\nit was literally a trick and no one\ncould see it right\nit was this crazy thing that's at least\nthe way my brain saw it so yeah\nit's never been that's never been me but\ni think\nin the search for myself\ni guess that's just one of the paths\ntook me down and so when you were\npartying like let's say early in college\ni mean would you say it was an escape\nfor you\nno what was it for you\nit was a search for adventure\nthat's what it was yeah it was a search\nfor something\ni was hoping that you know something\ncrazy should happen i'll be real\n[ __ ] some crazy [ __ ] happen in those\ndays i have some stories for you oh we\ncan go for\nhours we don't have that today though\nbut wow\nbut yeah do you feel adventure one\njust to give us a sense well it's not\noh if it's not street stream friendly\nthen that's totally\nwell it i mean it's stream friendly but\ni don't know how relevant it is just\nyeah\nwhat's all right well it's just\nyou know there are certain things you\nknow you can talk about because people\ndon't\ni i'll just tell you so i was this guy\nnamed kyle okay\nit's funny cause me and kyle started as\nenemies he was the best fighter in our\nschool he didn't like me\nand he actually went to my high school\nand he was one of the kids that kind of\n[ __ ] with me and bullied me but\nwe ended up connecting after we kind of\nlike fought\nalways seems to be the case um anyways\nhe's the one that had issues with you\nbecause you walked in with your head\nheld high\nyeah yeah yeah but yeah and but he had\nhis own issues he\nhis his dad was you know military and\nyou know it was\nsome crazy [ __ ] you know his friends\nwould tell me stories\nyou know they'd go to his house after\nschool think this is in high school\nthing that there's a kid that's\n16 years old he brings his friends over\nand his dad literally drunk as hell just\nbeats the [ __ ] out of him in front of\nhis friends\nsome [ __ ] up [ __ ] so i felt for the\nguy he was he was a little twisted but\nanyway so fast forward to college and\nwhen i go to a party there's this place\ncalled the view\nat the time it was good i don't know if\nit's trash now or not but\ni remember i walk in with him and we're\nkind of just getting [ __ ] up right\nand just drinking and i'm standing\noutside\ni have like like the last two beers in\nthe whole party right that's how culture\nworks right\ngod knows where the hell the liquor's\ncoming from half the time it's hidden in\nthe owner's you know room\num anyways and i'm staying outside\nyou know i'm double fisting the beer\nright some trash piss american beer\nright some keystone light or some trash\nlike that terrible by the way\num i'm sitting there and this\nthis big [ __ ] six nine six nine\ntwo fifty huge [ __ ] like just\nsteroid\ngeeked up walks up to me it's like\nyou're holding one of my beers i go no\ni'm not\nright at that point i'm drunk right i'm\nfeeling that good buzz right i'm at a\npoint\nwhere superman could have walked up to\nme and i would have thought i was his\nkryptonite\nyou know i would have [ __ ] i would have\ntake i would have stolen lois lane from\nhim you know\nthat's where i was mentally this dude's\n69 250 just steroid it out\nhe's with his friend and his friend was\na mutual of mine\nhe tries to grab my beer i turn away\ni knock his hat off it falls over the\nbalcony\nhe pushes me and then a group of kids\nform this like\nalleyway out into the hallway\nand they want us to fight but we end up\nlike scuffling and fighting\nin the kitchen and he throws a punch at\nme\nand i dodge it and his his hand goes\nthrough the door and the door\nlike the doors in these college areas\nare paper thin it's not like these\nnice wooden doors paper thin his hand\ngoes to this door\nand i remember everyone's like oh we\nboth freeze i look\ni turn behind me i look and all i see is\nmy\nfriend kyle's bare ass cheeks just\nclapping cheeks just just he's going to\ntown\non this other chick in the bathroom on\nthe sink\nand i'm like hey kyle right and then he\nruns out right puts his pants on\nwe go into the hallway and\nto this day i don't know\nsometimes i feel like i dreamt this\nbecause\ni was in this superman\ngod complex mode where this dude's\nthrowing his haymakers right he's this\nbig guy he's slow\nand you know his his his tr his uh his\nlats are huge\nso he can't throw a straight punch he\nhas to throw these haymakers\nand i remember when i was looking at him\nit was as if there was just slow motion\ni was dodging and i was\nlaughing because it was so slow to me\nand\neach when i dodged i jabbed him i jabbed\nhim\nand i ended up winning that i mean if he\nwas smart he would stick him in the\nground and [ __ ] me up but\nhe wasn't so i guess that's the\nstereotype of the meat head but\nyeah so that happened and then the next\nday we end up going to a party and\nhe ends up being there and his face is\njust messed up and he's like six of his\nboys i'm by myself\nvery [ __ ] awkward but fortunately he\nwas a good guy and he apologized i\napologized\nwe're cool now wow that's the story yeah\ni have a lot of those i have some crazy\n[ __ ] stories the craziest thing about\nthat\nstory train is that when you said you\nsaw a pair of\nass cheeks clapping i was like\nwhat right because you're in the middle\nof a fight and that's that's the thought\nthat's all thing it's like\na movie yeah well yeah why are there but\nlike and then there's like no\nthere's no like segway into there the\ndoor was open\nno it wasn't the guy punched through the\ndoor oh\ni pulled his hand out there's a huge\nhole and i look into the hole\nand it's literally just a pair of ass\ncheeks here\nright he's just going to town it was it\nwas some hot [ __ ] yeah it was hot as\nhell but i was in my adrenaline mode so\ni couldn't really\nget into that when i was\nyeah crazy [ __ ] yeah that that's wild\nman\nyeah yeah it was yeah\nanyways so around i'd say i'd say around\nsophomore year\ni met these two kids and\num they were actually pre-med they had\nlike 4.2 gpas\ncrazy gpas you know always studying in\nuh you know the office hours\ni think we called it lab or some [ __ ]\nlike that and\nthey were like smart ass [ __ ]\nlike they were\nthey were on track you know to you know\na top 10 med school\nand at that time in my eyes that's like\nthe most credible thing\naround me right you got someone that you\nknow has a good family\nis a good guy has good values has a high\ngpa\non track to a top 10 med school you know\ndoing shadowing and\nyou know uh internships things like that\nright\nto me that's incredible now these guys\nthey were secretly [ __ ] up right they\nwere on some crazy [ __ ]\nright percocets oxycontin they were\nsmoking them doing heroin\nso you know i kind of got involved with\nthem and in my head\ni'm thinking okay well can't be that bad\nthese guys are\nsmart they're doing well [ __ ] like\nright right [ __ ] it why not\nyeah people who have their [ __ ] together\nare doing it so\nyeah i can some [ __ ] like that yeah\nso it started out with you know perks\nfrom perks you know smoking perks\nfrom smoking perks to ocs from ocs\nsmoking ocs then ocs got banned and you\nhad these things called opanas which had\na coating over it so you couldn't smoke\nit\nand then from there you know obviously\nthose are 20 to 50 to 80 dollars a pill\nyou can get that amount times 100\nfor that same price if you do heroin\ninstead of that\nand realistically what people don't know\nis percocet is literally synthetic\nheroin it's a clean heroine right it's a\npharmaceutical heroin\nright no one knows that everyone thinks\nthey take a perk you know you know\nbecause like there's a stigma behind\nheroin and there should be but\nyet percocet's like this accepted thing\nif you get it prescribed but it's the\nsame [ __ ] [ __ ]\nso right and i guess at the time that\nthat's a very dangerous\nyou know thing to kind of say because\nbut it sounds like i'm justifying it it\nsounds like i'm saying oh well percocets\nare prescribed this is the same thing\nit's just dirty\nright so it should be okay but it's not\nokay so i want to make that very clear\nthat's very dangerous\nwhat what is not okay i'm confused like\nis it saying to yourself a percocet is\nprescribed so that's\nokay or you know i'm saying that like\ncheaper i'm saying like if you know if\nyou go to your boy's house\nand on the counter you see his mom's\npercocet prescription you don't think oh\nwhat a [ __ ] drug addict discussing i\ngot to get out of here bad vibes right\nbut if you you know see a needle in\nheroin you're gonna [ __ ] need if you\njust see heroin on the count you're like\n[ __ ] like i gotta get the [ __ ] out of\nhere and call the cops never come back\nhere again right\nbut it's like they're one and the same\nrealistically right like sure\nthat's what i'm talking about right so\nyeah anyways so you know that happened\nyou know\nsome heroin for like let's say three\nyears\ntried meth once the meth experience was\nnuts crazy story for you there\n[ __ ] that was nuts i remember i came\nhome i\ni told my mom i spilled you know some\nsome\nchemical shampoo on my face and she's\nlike are those meth mites what the [ __ ]\noh she was tripping balls crazy i was it\nwas terrible i thought i was gonna die i\nwas up for seven and a half days\nshe was tripping she was pissed yeah\nlike tripping hasn't pissed she was real\nangry\ni don't know what else used meth i mean\nlisten if you would have saw my face\nbecause i sat there i was picking the\nwhole like because listen\nso the mets the meth thing was like the\nat the very end of this binge\nor binder whatever the [ __ ] you call it\nso when i did math okay i was with this\nlike pro baseball player's kid\nand we were at this like nice apartment\nand it was just him and i\nand i remember like before we did it the\nsame two kids that i did like\nstarted heroin with they're like yo if\nyou're gonna do this with him you need\nto make sure to tell him to eat\nand drink water you need to [ __ ]\ndidn't\nso i remember like i took this [ __ ] like\ni smoked this on wednesday\nsmoke some meth on wednesday okay\ni remember i walk out to the door\nthinking it's thursday afternoon about\nto go home\ni check my phone i have like 300 missed\ncalls right\nit's [ __ ] tuesday of the following\nweek\nsomehow like a whole\nweek had passed by and i was sitting\nthere awake\nplaying i remember ml some mlb mlb like\n2k9 on the playstation\ni played mlb2k9 on the playstation for\nlike six days\nand i walked out of the house thinking\nit was only one day it was\nit was like six days i was gone and my\nparents thought i was dead\nthere was some crazy [ __ ] [ __ ] and i\nhad no [ __ ] clue\nmy face was swollen picking my face and\n[ __ ] like i had no idea\nhow much time had passed imagine that it\nwas some crazy [ __ ] [ __ ] it was it\nwas nuts\ncombat [ __ ] terrible yeah\nso uh that that sounds crazy dude\num yeah it's pretty bad\ni'm just trying to think so like like\nyou said that you you were using\nso what like first of all your mom knows\nwhat meth mites are\nshe googled it but what did she google\nlike so you come home and then i come\nhome i have like scabs and\njust red all over my face she types in\nred scabs all over her face and it says\nmethmites and she's like i thought it\nwas mathemates i'm like the [ __ ] are\nthose\nyeah i look i look that [ __ ] up it says\nlike you know when you're high in meth\nor whatever like\nyou have this like weird thing where you\nperceive there to be\nyou think there is like tiny mites\nunderneath your skins you have to pick\nthem out that wasn't the case for me but\nsome crazy [ __ ] [ __ ] like that yeah\nit was a crazy [ __ ] thing she was\n[ __ ] mad and she was crying and\nthat was terrible i let her down at that\npoint but yeah\nso uh train i mean what what were you\nwhat was going through your head\nlet's say like you know like a year\nbefore that point so it sounds like\nyou're using heroin for a couple or\nopiates of some kind for a couple of\nyears off and on\nlike what did you think about your life\nand what did you think about yourself\nand what did you think about\nuse well nothing because\ni somehow found this balance that gave\nme this\nperfect like denial of slash delusion\nthat like there was\nsomething wrong here i found the balance\ni was\nyou know double majored up i had good\ngrades you know\ni had you know i had good grades great\ngrades i had\ntwo very difficult majors i was getting\nby and doing very well\nright i was on track to you know a top\n20 law school\neverything was fine like it wasn't this\nthing where i just tossed everything\naside i started selling my parents\njewelry and getting high like\ni was i found this thing where i could\ncold turkey\nand it all goes back to like what i told\nyou earlier like that's that story line\nthat\nthat hope that adventure like deep down\ni prefer that over any high right any\nescape\nany shortcut i preferred that real thing\nthat\nsearch for that real thing that\nconnection overall and that's what\nallowed me to actually\nget out of it myself right there has to\nbe something you love more than the high\nso like i see but that's how you got it\nwell yeah i wasn't yeah i wasn't so like\nwhen i said i was using\nthree years what i mean is like i wasn't\nusing\nfor three years straight what i would do\nis\nfor one week i would use then i had cold\nturkey and i was off for three months\nthen i'd be on for two weeks then i'd be\noff for four months right then i'd be on\nfor a week then i'd be offered two\nmonths\nlike i could do that somehow i could do\ni'm sure it was [ __ ] my body up\nbut somehow i found a method where i\ncould hold turkey off and on and just\nuse it like recreationally almost\nwhile also going to school and having a\njob\nright so it's not so i didn't toss my\njob out i didn't toss school out i was\nstill doing all of these things\nand then like you know if i had nothing\nto do one weekend right\nif everything was done with i had a week\noff\nthat's when i'd use it right does that\nmake sense yeah it makes a lot of sense\nso it's interesting train i really\nappreciate the conversation because i'm\nlearning a lot so\nas a clinician i think the people\nwho are like you never really enter my\noffice\nlike i've never worked with someone\nwho's had an addiction let me think\nabout this before\ni actually say it no one comes to mind\nright now i mean usually the people that\nwind up in my office are the ones that\ncan't cold turkey\nafter a week of use it's like one week\nturns into two weeks turns into three\nmonths turns into six months\nturns into eight months it does start to\naffect things\nin in my time of using here's the [ __ ]\nup part\nyou know and not many people know this\nbut anyone who's in the heroin game\nright\nyour friends or at that you know i guess\nfrom an outside perspective that none of\nthem are your friends they're your\nacquaintances or people you're smoking\nwith but when you're in that you know\nworld that they're your friends\nthey're dropping like flies right like\nfour or five friends odin a week dead\nright\ni i've had people die in front of me\nlike some crazy [ __ ] like that like some\n[ __ ] you'd set up a [ __ ] movie\nand like i've seen it like like people\ndon't understand\nit's some [ __ ] up [ __ ] right it's not\nlike the dude's eyes are closed and he's\njust passed out you touch him oh he's\ncold\nright it's like\nright dudes shivering shaking right\nhe's scared right it's some [ __ ] up\n[ __ ] right like\ni i've seen some [ __ ] up [ __ ]\nespecially because like everyone shot up\nthat's one thing i promised also i'd\nnever do i never went past smoking it i\nnever shot up ever\nso many people died and if anyone like\nis ever in that game they know\nthat it is it's it's people just die\nit's just [ __ ] up\nwhen people are dying what goes through\nyour head\nthe same thing goes through everyone's\nhead for every other thing in the world\nnot gonna happen to me\ni'm careful right that's the story of\neveryone's life\ni think for every situation right\nlook at kobit right koben corbin norma's\nmask not gonna happen to me right and\nthen suddenly their family member gets\nit and now they want to be\nyou know they want to start taking\nprecautions right did and did anyone\naround you think you had a\nproblem or tried to talk to you about\nlike did your parents know\ni think they i don't know i had it from\nthem for a while\ni finally told them and they helped me\nand\nyeah no they didn't know\ncause i wasn't home much yeah\ndid anyone kind of express concern about\nwhat you were oh every day\noh my my parents are expressed concern\nevery day but\nthey didn't know what was going on but\nthey knew there was something up\npersian parents typically [ __ ] what and\nwhat did what would they say\ntypical persian parent kid stuff\nlike what what what is that i don't know\nfor me it's all just melded into\ntypical i'm sure you can imagine yeah\ni'm sure you can\nwell i mean so\ni mean my story is like quite different\nbecause\ni wasn't using any drugs in college yeah\nwell i was referring to like like if\nif you didn't do your homework if you or\nif you had homework like whatever they\nbicker at you there\ntake that exact line and throw it at\nthis well yeah so i mean the thing with\nme is that i was failing out of college\nthough right so it sounds like you were\nyour drugs but absolutely bro dude after\nafter two years of college i had less\nthan a 2.0 gpa\nwell you gotta get into those uh groups\ni this little secret society in college\nright\nthere's like look there's this group\n[ __ ] charged like 25 bucks per\nclass they'd give you\nthese guys had the [ __ ] intel right\nthey knew all the five credit courses\nwhere the teacher didn't give a [ __ ]\nright and if you get an a plus that's a\n4.3\nin a five credit course that's a huge\ngpa boost right that's a huge pad\nso you take a couple of those you know\nboost you know the 2.0 2.5 to a 3.2 3.3\nyou know take a couple more of them you\nknow you end up graduating you know\nwhatever the [ __ ] cumulates\nwhat the [ __ ] those are yeah i mean\nfirst of all i didn't i didn't know\nabout that but secondly i mean my gpa\nwas pretty wrecked man like when you've\ngot\nyou know a string of 0.00 like when you\ngot a string of f's\non your transcript it's it's hard to i\nmean i i sort of\ni ended up graduating with like a 2.5\nlike\nand that was busting my ass for three\nyears\ndidn't your school have the thing where\nlike like up to 12 credits they forgive\ni mean it still shows in the transcript\nbut it shows that it counts the second\ngrade great\nsecond grade if they did train i was so\ndisorganized that i didn't apply for it\ni think it's yeah i think it's automatic\nthat well i mean it may be\nit may have been something that they\ninstituted later\nbut like i went to college back in like\n2000 like i started college in like\n2001.\noh wow how did you get their horses\nuh we would walk through the snow my\ndude horses were too high-tech\nyeah figured you know back when it\nsnowed in austin all the time\nunlike this past week it just snowed two\ndays ago yeah insane i've been hearing\nabout it from everyone under the sun\nyeah you know what's crazy though uh\nbefore you\ngo off on those tangent um or whatever\nanyways\nwhat's crazy is uh in all of that\nright now everything we talked about\nthere actually was a moment right where\ni was\noff the rails i remember it was\nsenior year right it was all done i was\ngraduating\ni was working in a bar right it was the\nhottest bar in\nin the entire state of arizona right in\nscottsdale town\nand i was doing some crazy [ __ ]\nlike i was mixing we're talking\nheroin xanax\ndrinking steroids like we're talking\nfour different things\nhardcore and at this time\njust to jump in train like seriously if\nanyone there is watching that [ __ ] will\nkill you\noh 100 i will and i'll tell you yeah\ni'll tell you in a second what happened\nat the time i wasn't very i wasn't too\nserious about my bipolar\nright and there's a huge thing that\nhappens with steroids and bipolar\ni guess any of those drugs realistically\nall of that all that mixing and [ __ ]\naround i ended up having a psychotic\nbreak\nit was called acute psychosis it was a\ntemporary psychosis for two and a half\nmonths\ni remember my parents found me in the\nliving room banging and controller in my\nhead the remote control for the tv\nand i was jibbering some [ __ ] i was\nwhatever saying some\nwhispering some [ __ ] like a [ __ ] cult\ncult leader\nman that psychotic break\nyou want to talk about hell [ __ ]\nmy entire like the best way i can\nexplain this\nlike in in short\nthere's a moment when you're kind of\nlike lucid dreaming asleep but like\nyou don't actually know that you're\nasleep yet right\nyou think you're actually awake and this\nis your real world right\nthere's a moment where you're in a\nnightmare and in like at the precipice\nof the nightmare\nthere is this just pure feeling of\nterror\nand evil in the pit of your stomach\nright you just want to escape\nyou want to run you're praying that this\nis a dream you want to wake up\nthat moment or literally when you\nfinally do wake up and\nit kind of just like you know kind of\nwhatever the you know i'm trying to word\nit\nit slowly kind of dissipates right that\nfeeling was my it was my\nstate of mind it was my constant state\nof mind for two and a half months\nand all i was hoping for was one day\nwould i wake up did i\n[ __ ] up is this permanent you know like\nit was\nit was hell it was sounds terrifying\ni get goosebumps talking about it to\nthis day i was in\nthis two and a half month nightmare\nwhere no matter what i did who i talked\nto\nwhere i was it was\nlike i'm about to cry it was scary it\nwas some [ __ ] up [ __ ] and the thoughts\ni had\nman some [ __ ] out of one of those\n[ __ ] uh tarantino movies\nand all of it to myself to others like\njust some [ __ ] up [ __ ]\ntwisted [ __ ] like i was just\nthat was an insane two and a half months\nof my life i\ni don't think there was any hallucinogen\npsychedelic any any none of that stuff\nthat has ever gotten me as close to\nmyself\nas those two and a half months the\namount i learned\nbecause those like those those\nthose those\nlocked chests lock deep deep into the\nabyss of your mind are\nrarely rarely even like gotten close to\nyou know in like self-reflection and\nself-discovery and like looking inward\nright and in that state of mind\nall of them were like at my disposal i\nwas so deep\nand so and i was in the darkest crevices\nand all of them were unlocking like\njust it was just some crazy [ __ ] [ __ ]\ni can't even explain to you\nit was some insane [ __ ] like it was just\n[ __ ] that was some crazy\ncrazy [ __ ] i came back so hey\nyeah you know train i i think it's\ncertainly\nyou know what you're describing i think\nsometimes people don't\nrealize that hallucinogens and psychosis\nand even meditation share some amount of\nlike common\naspects like if you look at the\nneuroscience of it and how it affects\nyour brain\num but psychosis and hallucin and\nhallucinogens are quite different\nthere is like yeah yeah i know i was\ni was making a reference to it yeah\num and and so i'm really sorry you went\nthrough that man that sounds\nyou know i can't imagine\ni've had some scary experiences in\nmeditation but they they tend to last\nat most 24 hours i don't think i've ever\nhad a negative experience that's lasted\nlonger than 24 hours\nbut for two and a half months to kind of\nbe trapped in that place i can imagine\nit feels like quite hopeless and\ntraumatic\nhave you ever had your ear plugged\nlike your ears plugged like in a plane\nyour ears get plugged yeah yeah\nhave you ever tried a yawn and sometimes\nit doesn't unclog\nright that feeling where you yawn and it\ndoesn't\npop that was the feeling i had every\nmorning waking up\nevery morning when i woke up i was\nhoping i'd open my eyes like that moment\nwhere i kind of gained consciousness but\ni'm not awake i was going to open my\neyes and i'd\nlook around and i was back to me yep\nand that was that feeling that feeling\nwhere you open your mouth\nand it doesn't pop like that that\nfeeling you have that like you can't get\nit to pop and there's no other way to\nget it to pop and you're stuck in this\nway until finally what somehow it pops\nby itself\nthat's the feeling i had every day\ntrying to get back to me and hoping i'd\ncome back to me\nand that was two and a half months it\nwas [ __ ] crazy it was insane\nyeah i mean it sounds like you know you\nknow that\nit's not your normal existence yeah i\nwas aware i was conscious\nyou can't get back there yeah and you're\nwondering am i ever gonna be\nnormal again that's the scary part about\nit right like if i was like ignorant to\nit\nand i just kind of pride myself and i\nwent brain you know whatever the hell\nright\nlike i'm sure that'd be shitty and\n[ __ ] up probably more so for those\naround me\nbut i myself wouldn't know but being\nhyper aware of the situation and being\ntrapped within myself\nknowing that it's not me but being stuck\nin this thing where i know how i should\nfeel\nbut what i do feel is this terror and\nthere's nothing i can do to make it go\naway it's just this it's this terrible\nterrible thing\nand so um it sounds like you got\ntreatment at some point the psychotic\nbreak i did\ni went to the hospital and stuff and\nyeah and then i ended up seeing a\npsychiatrist psychiat i'mma give it a\nbuck 50 with you you're the best\npsychiatrist i've ever\nsee you know obviously we're doing this\nthis isn't an actual session but you're\nthe best psychiatrist\ni've ever seen in my entire life i've\nbeen to hundreds\nokay of psychiatrists and psychologists\nevery\nno joke no exagger i know i exaggerate a\n[ __ ] ton this one thing i'm not\nexaggerating every psychiatrist i have\nseen\ni walk into the office okay because\nthey're all from referral\nthe ones i saw i couldn't just see i had\nto go through you know and i get a\nreferral\nto them i'd walk in\nno eye contact you know sitting there\nalready writing a prescription right no\n[ __ ] given of the context of what's\ngoing on just kind of assuming the worst\nright\nyou know ask me a question i try to give\nhim context just the typical\ncondescending patronizing\nall right tyler you're going to take\nthis and this and this and then leave it\nto me right it's like no shot\nnone of them listened none of them gave\na [ __ ] right like there's a big\ndifference between\nyou know an in you know an induced\npsychotic break versus\nyou know some hereditary natural\noccurrence of one right like there's a\ndifference but they didn't give a [ __ ]\nabout that right\nthey didn't care that mine was induced\nthrough steroid usage and drug usage\nright so like it was just this all of\nthem to all of them and these are like\ntop-rated psychiatrists they just didn't\ngive a [ __ ]\npsychologist on their hand i loved right\ni mean it took me it took me a long time\nyou know and i hear this this is common\nbetween a lot of people and i think this\nwill actually help people\nyou know if you feel like your\npsychologist doesn't you know connect\nwith you\nlisten keep moving around keep keep\nkeep testing out new ones you know\neventually you'll find one that's on\nyour wavelength right that understands\nyou you know there's some that\nare very uh like what's what i'm trying\nlike\nlike mathematical they're very like\nprecise rational right like\nthere is no feeling and you know they\ndon't understand the irrationalness\nright\nand and i can't vibe with that kind of\nperson right i can't do it\nso i have to find someone that's on my\nwavelength understands my feelings my\nimpulses\nno matter how irrational they are\nunderstands them on that level\nand it took me [ __ ] i probably it took\nme about six seven months to find one\nperson that\nended up really really uh connecting\nwith me and i remember\ni'm gonna cry the moment i found that\nperson\ni remember i tried to say i try to say\none word\nand i just bro i cried the entire\nsession for the first like two weeks\nevery session for the first two weeks i\nhad three sessions a week i cried\nall of them just like six sessions i\nonly cried\nlike there's nothing else said he said\nokay see you next week\ni i just cried for six weeks it was for\nsuccession\nit was just insane yeah it was crazy but\nyeah you'll find one if you hop around\nthere's someone out there for you that\nwill understand you so definitely uh\nkeep trying you know don't be\nunmotivated if\nif if you don't find the right\npsychologist in the first go\nyeah train i'm really glad you're kind\nof sharing that message with everyone\nbecause i'd echo at 100\num you know i think that fit is so\nimportant\nand there are so many different styles\nof of therapy and styles of therapists\nand even styles of psychiatrists\nand and i think that like you know what\nwe meant the mental health\nyou know clinical training is is not\nprecise\nright you have all these different\ntheories and all these different\nperspectives and like you've got\nfreudian people and jungian people\nand cognitive behavioral therapists and\npsychodynamic therapists and\npeople who are a little bit mindfulness\noriented and there's just so many\ndifferent flavors and i think really\ntherapy because we don't have the\ninstruments that the rest of medicine\ndoes\nyou know when you've got ct scans and\nand blood tests and\nand you know covet nasal swabs and\nthings like that there's a lot of\nprecision\nabout how to handle things right and how\nto do things you know what's right and\nwhat isn't\nyeah whereas my experience in in therapy\nhas been that it's it's really\nmore or just as much art as it is\nscience there's a lot of science to it\nbut\nyou know we don't there it's interesting\nthere have been studies done where\npeople will try to classify like\ncharacteristics of patients and classify\ncharacteristics of of therapists\nand they'll try to match them based on\nusing data\nand it turns out that that doesn't work\nyou know you can try to do as much data\nanalysis as you want to you can say oh\nlike train has\na history of addictions and this therap\nthis therapist has a lot of experience\nwith addictions\nmaybe they'll be a good match turns out\nthat you can't really it just doesn't\nwork\ncan't match people um yep there's no uh\nthere's no formula well people haven't\nfigured it out yet i think that there's\nstill a formula out there\nbut you know we just haven't we don't\nhave the precision we haven't been able\nto capture that\nthat secret sauce that allows you to see\ntherapists for six months\nand and see this next person and then\nlike really open up to them for two\nweeks and also for that therapist to\nknow how to respond to you opening up\nfor them to understand that you know\nthese tears have been built up\nand the dam is opening up and that like\nwe got to just let them out\nthank you so much for sharing your\nperspective i think um\nthank you no problem i actually uh after\ni stopped using uh\ndrugs or hard drugs like that like\nheroin and stuff like that like meth\nafter i stopped like entirely\ni actually went back and helped some of\nmy old friends that were addicted and\nyou know obviously i tried to get them\nto a psychologist you know after i\nfinally got them out of denial heroin\ndenial is one of those\nit's like i don't i don't give a [ __ ]\nlike i don't\ni've seen gambling denial i've seen\nevery drug denial heroin denial\nis so frustrating\nit just if they don't want it it's not\ngoing to happen\nyou could put them you could force them\ni've seen parents do it you could force\nthem two years of rehab\nthe moment they come out they might be\ngood for a week you better bet your ass\nthe first difficult thing that they face\nthey can't handle and they go right back\nto it you have to\nyou have to want it what's up how did\nyou come out of your denial\nwell i wanted to\nright like that's the difference like so\nthere's one thing that i had that helped\nme a lot in that\nand it's what i talked about earlier i\nkind of have this\nso my anchor\nit's a dream it's an idea it's highly\nimprobable but not impossible and that's\nmy\nanchor in life and i've taken that and\ni've\nburied it deep deep deep within me where\ni can never be taken away you know\nunless i'm killed\nand that is what got me out of it\nit's to achieve that to get that like\nthe wanting of that the\nfeeling that that gave me you know\nit but was that always there yeah it was\nit's been there since i can remember so\ni'm going to\nexpress a little bit of skepticism just\nbecause i want to kind of push you on\nthis\nand because i i'm sure that you'll have\nthe answer but i think it's important to\nfind because\nlike here's here's what i'm thinking\nokay so the dream was always deep within\nyou\nand then there's this period of time in\ncollege where despite the dream\nand then when i asked you how did you\nget out of it you said well i started\nwanting my dream\nbut then at the same time like i don't\nsee how that's different from when you\nwere in college\nand you were using and finding that\nbalance and you the dream was always\nthere\nso still like how did you move from like\nwhere you were in college to like\nwanting to quit i understand that you\nsay that you have to want to so then the\nquestion\nkind of i i ask sort of as a clinician\nand i ask like theoretically and also\nlike educationally\nis how does what was your journey to\nchange your wants\nto value that over the heroin or other\nthings like\nlike how did you come out of the denial\ni get that that's the anchor that was\nyour north star but like\nwhy did you start caring about moving\ntowards the north star to begin with\num i think\nit's\ni i you know i've never really thought\nabout that but if i were to\ntry to think about it right now on the\nspot and kind of give you a quick thing\ni'd have to reflect on it a lot more to\ngive you an actual accurate answer but\nif i were to guess right now\ni would say it's how i was raised i\nwould say it's my parents it's the love\nthey kind of instilled within me\num you know they kind of taught me like\nthey gave me a self-worth that they gave\nme you know like\ni think that that's what it is because i\nremember all the times that i stopped\nit wasn't this thing where i planned it\nokay i'm gonna do this for four days\nbecause i have four days\nright that's not how i went down i did\nit day one i didn't think of the next\nday\nright and then each of these times\nevery time it never failed i'd wake up\nrandomly after day six or day five or\nday seven or day four\ni'm like what the [ __ ] am i doing right\nlike\nit's like it was never me to begin with\ni'd be like what the [ __ ] am i doing\nand that one realization where the other\nme kind of wakes up\nright i don't know if we want to go as\ndeep as saying maybe it's the bipolar\nsplit personality\ni don't know but the other way like what\nthe [ __ ] going on here right\nand that me would always come out\nafter the aftermath of me\n[ __ ] my body and my body was weak and\ni think like that weakness\nallowed the other me to come out i don't\nknow i don't know it sounds like it's\nsome crazy talk i know it does but like\nthat was that was how it was done every\ntime okay cool yeah so that's what\nhappened every time\nso so then but let me ask you another\nquestion then i'm gonna keep pushing you\nokay and and it's because i like i think\nyou're you're getting there\nor i think this is like valuable because\ni think this is this is the question\nthat everyone asks right train is like\nhow how did you quit\nand what i'm gonna press you on now is\nthat like okay so you'd wake up you'd be\nweak in your body\nlike you'd say like what the [ __ ] am i\ndoing and then like\nthe this like sort of this train that\nwas built up through\nthe love of your parents and like this\nself-respect and things like that\nbasically like\nshown through right it's almost like you\nhave cloudy skies and the sun's\nalways there and sometimes the clouds\npart and you get this like ray of\nsunshine so like after six days of a\nbender\nyou get that ray of sunshine where\nyou're kind of like but then what\nhappens is the clouds always come back\nright because then a month later two\nmonths later three months later you\nstart using again\nso what changed what what changed so\nthat\nthe awareness the awareness of it so\ni'll tell you what i mean by that\nwhat changed is\ni've always so be you know\nforgot what the [ __ ] it's called i think\nit's called like hyper like\nit's having bipolar and split\npersonality\nyou can have a version of it where\nyou're not aware and there's a version\nor you're hyper aware\nbut you can't do anything about it still\nright that's kind of been me in every\naspect of my life\nso because of my hyper awareness\nof the situation right like i understood\nwhat the it's like i think i got lucky\nand\nmy overthinking or i don't know what it\nwas i'm not sure what it was but\nhere's the point everyone says not even\nonce\neveryone says this is addicting right\nand because of my you know ability to go\non and off my because i you know\ni never really got like that the urge\nwas never to do the\nheroin the only urge i ever had was\nmaybe the withdrawals were [ __ ] [ __ ]\ni wanted i didn't want to deal with them\ntoday right but it was never the actual\nheroine but i realized\na little bit later on what did not even\nonce meant i realized what the addiction\nis\nthe addiction is what you just said\nwhere the clouds come back\nnow what i've done is i've normalized\nthe new baseline\nfor my sorrows and for my escape right\nfor a lot of people that baseline is\nalcohol it's weed\nand that's it that's where they go\neverything else is scary it's a no-no\nbut once you open up the realm and you\nrealize\nholy [ __ ] i've popped this pill before\nthis feels the same this isn't that\nscary thing on the commercial which it\nis by the way\nright once you do that that is your new\nbaseline so the next time that i\nfeel sad depressed and [ __ ] up with\nnothing\ngoing for me i'm not gonna think i'm\ngonna have a drink i'm gonna think hey\nwhere can i buy some heroin right\nand i realized that is the lifelong\naddiction\nof the drug because it is now the\nnormalized new baseline for me\nand once i realized that i understood\nlike that's kind of like that was like\nhalf the part with it\ni realized like it just needs to stop it\nneeds to be done otherwise\nhow did you realize it\ni mean i this is gonna sound crazy but\nthis is a different i guess this is a\ndifferent talk i guess that this would\ngo into the bipolar split personality\nocd part of it all but\nso every three to four months i'll wake\nup\nand i'll literally like\na whole new style whole new taste of\nfood\ndifferent body composition everything\ndifferent\neverything you can think of favorite\ncolor different what i'm into\nright am i you know my poor girlfriend\nyou know i i feel so that she's such a\ngood girl she's such an amazing person\nbut she has to kind of deal with it but\ni just get uninterested and\nyou know i i change completely like i'm\ntalking full body composition change\nright like i'm talking like\nfrom you know just normal body to like\neverything tight athletic like it's it's\nweird it's weird i don't understand it\ni've been explaining to it 100 times\njust wake up some days and you're ripped\nno no no it's no\nit's like every four months five months\nthat's like the cycle no i'm not ripped\nbut it's just like things are tighter\nokay and my body composition is\ndifferent like tension\nwhat the way i taste the way i smell\neverything's different\nokay i think\nlike i don't know how to answer how did\ni know\ni think that i i i i just kind of woke\nup i'm like\nwhat am i doing this is not this is\ndisgusting i just there was\nthere was a side of me i did not [ __ ]\nwith it it was it was it was a shame\nright like and and that's that's that's\nbeen the lifelong\n[ __ ] it's been the curse of my [ __ ]\nmental disease\ni sit there for so long working\nprogressing\nbuilding on myself and then one day i\nwake up\nand i black out for like three months\nand that three month me\nruins everything toss my money out don't\ngive a [ __ ]\ngo party [ __ ] my body up stop the gym\ngamble everything away\ni don't care and then i wake up again\nright\nthree months after that not remembering\na [ __ ] thing\neverything gone and i'm disgusted right\nbecause that like there's\ndoes that make any sense it's some crazy\n[ __ ] [ __ ] that i can relate to\noddly enough i mean i i think for me it\nwas it was more with gaming but you know\nin my first couple years of college and\neven high school it was like\nyou know i disappear so start of the\nsemester this semester is going to be\ndifferent\nright i'm going to study hard for the\nfirst week i do fantastic\nfirst weekend rolls around start playing\ngames\nyou know sunday night saturday night i\nstay up super late\nwake up late on sunday sunday night i\nstay up super late\nmiss my class on monday ah [ __ ] it i\nmissed one class i can afford to miss a\nclass\nskip the rest of my classes on monday\ngame tuesday rolls around\nyep i did that too classic excuses i\nlike that\nand then you know it's like now that\ni've missed one class like i'll start\noff it'll be better tomorrow it'll be\nbetter tomorrow\nand then like that's that doubt starts\ncreeping up at least for me i knew\ni was making mistakes i was like it's\nhappening again\nit's happening again and i'd be like\nwell well\nthat shows itself through like anxiety\ndepression like that\nthat's what it comes out as from your\nsubconscious right yeah so so so it\nwould start to come out from my\nsubconscious and i would say i'm doing\nit again and i'd\nsnap the door closed on it i want\ni definitely wanted that a lot myself\ntoo yeah that's happened to me quite a\nbit\nand and then like anything to keep it\nfrom coming out of the subconscious\nso then i got to play more and more and\nmore and more and more\nand then i found myself spiraling and i\nknew i was [ __ ] up my life i think\nthe really interesting thing\nis you know train i i know it sounds\nlike you're not making sense but this is\nthe story that i hear\nover and over and over again this is why\naddictions is so hard because i i think\nat the end of the day like there are a\ncouple of questions that have been\nbouncing around in my mind there are\ngoing to be people watching\nright now who may be where you were\nin the middle of college where you\nthought you were different you thought\nyou could handle it\nand what i'm trying to figure out is\nlike what can we explore\nin today's like discussion\nthat will help that person i got it i\ngot it yeah i got it cool\ni got it now i got i i i know what\nyou're asking now okay so here is the\nmoment here's how\ni realize it needs to stop here's how\ni realized it needs to be done somewhere\nso i actually wrote this thesis\num and\nit was it was a very informal one um it\nwas kind of i was [ __ ] around i\nshouldn't even call it a thesis i just\ncall it a paper\num delusions of grandeur and [ __ ] like\nthat call it what a nice train called\nthesis and i i feel like that there's\nthis you know\nobviously you know i don't have the\nstats to back it but you know just just\nfrom\nyou know it's anecdotal just say it\ntrain i thought i feel like there's this\nthis age category from like\n18 to like 24 where\nwe are as men at least suffering from\nthe most\njust like the deepest denial delusions\nof grandeur like we are\ndifferent and every justification like\nthat we can like\njust everything that can like some crazy\n[ __ ] like that\nthe point that allowed me to understand\nand stop\nis somewhere in the psychotic break\nwhich i guess isn't\nsomething you want to hear but like\nsomeone on the scottish break\ni realized i wasn't different i realized\nthat i was the the same as everyone\nand\nthat's it like i literally i just\nrealized i was not\ndifferent i was not special there wasn't\nthis mystical force\nguarding me and watching over me that\nyou know when i would survive a car\ncrash and i said someone's watch there's\na purpose right\nthat's all [ __ ] right like i mean\nknock on wood you know god forbid maybe\nthere was someone but like\nit doesn't tie into that right like or\nhow i passed this exam or how i did this\nor how i guessed on this and that got it\nright right\ni just realized i was the same as others\nwhen i realized that\ni realized that this\nrationalization i guess you shouldn't\ncall it that but this justification i\nwas making it\nthis excuse i was giving myself that i\ncan control this\nis wrong because this can't be\ncontrolled\nand then that's kind of what led me down\nthat path i think was the discovery and\nunderstanding that i am not different\nright like you know your parents are\ngoing to tell you that every day like\nand maybe in different\ndifferent fields you are maybe in soccer\nyou're better than you know the one\npercent right and you're great\nright but i'm talking like you know\nfoundationally as a human\nbeing right like i think the the most\ncommon thing i've seen\nfrom my friends is i can read people\nthat's the most common like delusion\nand delusions of grandeur like the\ndenial i've seen from people who think\nthey're different\ni can read people i know when you're\nlying right but if you actually look\ndeeper into that\nlike the only reason you know someone's\nlying and you can read into them is\nbecause\nyou've seen traits from either things\nthat you've done you know\nuh personality traits you have and\nexperiences you've lived through\nuh lived through right and from that if\nyou're smart enough you'll realize holy\n[ __ ]\ni i'm not able to read him because i'm\ndifferent i'm another read them because\ni am the same\nright and then from there you kind of\nhumble\nyou get humble and you realize you need\nto get your [ __ ] together that's kind of\nwhat happened does that make sense\nmakes perfect sense yeah so good news is\nthat i don't think you have to have a\npsychotic break to realize that\nalthough i'm surprised that's why i want\nto bring that up and i think there's a\nlot of\ncool stuff here train a lot that i think\nneeds to be\ntalked about can i kind of take the\nreins for a second take the reins\nor like can i grab ah yeah grab whatever\ni'm taking yeah\nlet's do it okay so i'm just going to\nkind of like feel free to jump in i'm\njust going to sort of like think through\nthis because i think train you've said\nso much man first of all\nthank you so much for sharing all this i\nthink um you know i know a lot of it's\npretty heavy stuff i know a lot of it um\nmay seem embarrassing but i i think it's\nnot for me\nit's been really enlightening\nthe first thing to understand is that\nlike okay so people are in denial right\nthat's the biggest problem it doesn't\nreally matter if you're talking about\naddictions or other things\nbut people are in denial like you said\nwe we start off by sort of telling\nourselves\nit's okay for us like we're different we\ncan handle it it's in balance\nyou know and then what happens is your\nmind points to the things\nthat are in balance it's setting up kind\nof like this kind of fake news sort of\nlike\nsituation where you're gonna point to\nyour gpa and you're gonna point to this\nyou're gonna point to that and your mind\nis gonna tell you see\nbecause of these things we're actually\nfine you see those guys have their [ __ ]\ntogether and they're using\nit's going to selectively ignore on a\nsaturday you wake up bruised and\nbattered because you got into a fight\nlast night it's gonna gloss over that\npart\nit's gonna gloss over the parts where\nlike oh my my parents are like\nyou know think i have a problem or these\npeople it's gonna gloss over all kinds\nof stuff\nand that's what really denial is it's\nsort of like this very selective\ninterpretation of your events and then\nyou kind of went on to\nsort of say like yeah i'm i'm not sure\nexactly\nyou use these terms like i realized\nright i woke up one day and it just dot\ndot and this is what makes addictions\nreally confusing is because when you ask\npeople about their journey\nwhat they tell you is like a change in\ntheir mind as opposed to actions\nand as human beings we know how to\nduplicate actions but we don't know how\nto duplicate\nrealizations and and this is something\nthat in sanskrit\nwe talk about a lot which is that there\nare two words for knowledge\none is vidya which is information and is\ntransmissible\nand the second is nyan which is\nunderstanding\nand is subjective so vidya is objective\nand nyan is subjective and as a society\ngenerally speaking in western society or\njust\nglobally now we value video over neon\nwe say that unless you can explain it to\nme unless you can prove it to me\nunless it is objective it does not have\nvalue\nso our our our society has evolved to\nlike appreciate science\nover opinion right objectivity over\nsubjectivity\nand in doing that we've lost the\nsubjective\nwe've lost because what happened in you\nwas not an object of change it was a\nsubject of change\nit was in realizing right so realizing\nis not\non a book information is on a book\nand we value things like there was that\nguy on youtube who was like\ni read 300 books a day or whatever right\nhe talked about like reading all these\nbooks and how like\nbecause he's smart because he reads a\nton but the question is what do you\nunderstand\nwhat do you absorb how does change\nhappen inside you\nand this is what's really challenging\nabout addictions if you talk to people\nabout their journey what they say is\ni woke up one day and it was just\ndifferent\nand then everyone who's struggling with\nthe addiction is like well what the [ __ ]\nam i supposed to do with that\nhow do i wake up one day and be\ndifferent\nand so this is where there are two\nimportant pieces okay the first\nis that i want you guys to understand\nthat that subconscious change\neven though it it reaches a tipping\npoint like for train at a particular\npoint\nthat subconscious change is being built\nover time\nso what we hear from train is that\nthere's like this addictive force which\nlet's say like\nhas a strength of 58 and then there's\nlike the\ninsightful like loving train that's deep\ndown within him\nthat's got a strength of like 10. and\nevery time you have a bender you wake up\nand then like that\nthat that strength of 10 sort of like\nlooks at your life and is like what's\ngoing on here\nand every moment you have that awareness\nyou level up to 12\nand then you go on another bender and\nthen like because 58 is bigger than 12\nright and then like you level up again\ni have to re-clarify something yeah now\nnow i understand why you gave me that\nexample\num of you felt that so what i was\nexplaining to you of when i like black\nout for three months and i'm different\neverything\nthat wasn't i wasn't using drugs that\nwas me normal\nsober right that was just my bipolar\nright like that's what that was\nright so four or five months does that\nmake sense i wasn't referring to my drug\nuse like this is\nuh past the drug use this is what\nhappens to this day like right now what\nhappened sure sure\ni think i teased that apart that you\nstill struggle with this because you\nmentioned your girlfriend has to deal\nwith it and things like that so i i\nthink i was aware of that\nyeah yeah um but i still think that this\nsort of as you go through\nthe substance use like you're going to\nhave these moments where the sun shines\nthrough\nand every time that happens you level up\nand eventually what happens is it one\nday you wake up and then like the true\nself\nis it like a 59 or 60 and that's when\nyou start to win against the addiction\nand what i see from people that i work\nwith with addictions is they'll kind of\nsay like oh i was sober for nine months\nand then i\nrelapsed and they're filled with shame\nand they're like oh i [ __ ] it up\ni threw it all away right because we're\na society that values\nquantifiable results it's all about\ntesla's stock price\nand you know where i am on the on the\nlatter for a particular video game\nand how much money is in my bank account\nit's all about numbers\nand we say i threw away nine months of\nsobriety but what i see with people that\ni work with\nis that you know you threw away nine\nmonths of writing no big deal you\nthrew away nine months you don't have to\nyou you relapsed fine\nyou elapsed for like a day it doesn't\nhave to be like a nine-month bender\nright you can still change that and\nover time the duration of relapses and\nthe frequency of relapses\ndecreases as long as you keep on\nbecoming more aware\nyes yeah and this is the key thing is\nthat this is this is an issue of nyan\nnot vidyas you can't learn it from a\nbook\nand so what people need to understand is\nthat they can listen to a thousand\nconversations with train\nbut trains answer is never gonna work\nfor for them because what they need to\ndo is not\nlearn they need to realize\nyeah experience but the other\ninteresting thing about realization\nis that learning implies that knowledge\nis on the outside\nrealize implies that knowledge is\nactually already within\nyou right so it's interesting when\npeople use the word i realize that means\nyou already\nknew on some level you've always known\non some level\nso instead of looking outside people\nneed to like\nlook within right i know it's kind of\nscenario yes\nthat's that's that's it that's and then\nif we listen to your psychotic break so\nthis is kind of interesting that\nthere's a shared realm between psychosis\nmeditation and hallucinogen use\nwhich is the way that it affects this\npart of your brain called the default\nmode network\nand the default mode network is the part\nof your brain that\nlets you look at you so when we kind of\nsay that like human beings are different\nfrom animals because we're self-aware\nand there's a particular cognitive test\nyou can do on some animals where they\ncan like recognize themselves in a\nmirror\nthat implies that they have the capacity\nto be\nhow can i say this they can look at\nthemselves so they can be the\nobject of your own observation and the\ndefault mode network is the thing that\nallows you to look at yourself\nnow this is kind of interesting because\nin depression the default mode network\nactually gets\nreally really overblown and someone in\ndepression is always thinking about\nthemselves\nthey're thinking oh i'm a piece of [ __ ]\nthese people don't like me they'd be\nbetter off without me all that kind of\nstuff\num and so hold on there's a lot of\nwhat is going on\nsorry i'm confused why there's a bunch\nof stuff being\nbanned from chat well i'm actually\nlooking at uh the usernames and\nyour mods are doing a very good job\nbecause i recognize that assad nine guy\nhe's\nyou know he's a fan of mine he's a good\ndude but he's toxic so\nthat seems like a good band good job\nmoderator i'm gonna keep going\nso um what what i was kind of saying is\nthat with the default mode network it's\nlike you get\nto way too preoccupied with yourself and\nin depression it gets way worse\nso people are always thinking about like\nif you're having a bad day\nmy default mode network is hyperactive\nso i think that you having a bad day is\nmy fault\nif my default mode network is active so\ni can't shake\nmy own ego and what i'm really hearing\nfor you in that psychotic break is what\nyou got past was your own ego right like\nwhen you say\ni am different that's your ego and when\nyou shatter that ego and you begin to\nsay\ni am no longer different i'm i'm the\nsame as everyone else\nand so it seemed like for you that\nhappened through psychosis but this is\nwhere\nyou know psychedelics can do it\nmeditation can do it self-reflection can\ndo it\njournaling can do it community service\ncan do it\ndeveloping humility and sort of\nperforming an ego\negodectomy the removal of your ego\nis actually like the most important\nthing to gain insight\nyou need to stop doing that thing where\nyour your mind your ego goes to your\nintellect and bullies\nand says hey i need to come up with a\nreally really selective way for me to\nfeel good about me using the substance\nand so you ignore a bunch of stuff and\nwhen your ego gets removed from the\nequation\nthen you stop ignoring that stuff you\nstart to see yourself as you are\nwith all of your flaws and all of your\nstrengths\nand that's how you gain security that's\nhow you get self-acceptance that's how\nyou gain self-love\nbecause we heard you kind of talk about\nthose concepts but i think these two\nthings\nare are really really tied together and\nthe most bizarre thing train i think is\nthat like\nwhen i listen to your story i think\nabout your karma\nand just what your addiction has done\nfor you\nin terms of your personal journey and\nhow you've grown\nso much through walking this journey how\nyou've come to learn\nso much about yourself how you've come\nto learn and understand\nother people you know and like have a\nhave like a back pocket full of wild ass\nawesome stories\nwhich you know on the one hand we kind\nof don't want to glorify because that\ndoesn't you know i'm not advocating that\npeople do it but like\nlet's at least acknowledge that that's a\nwild story to listen to right\ni got some crazy [ __ ] for you dr k\nbelieve me oh man dude like i\ni hope you so like this is kind of weird\nit's it's a strange value judgment to\nplace but i really hope that\nyou or someone in your family like your\nimmediate siblings have kids\nand then they have kids because you\nwould make one hell of a grandad\ni'm an only child unfortunately but yeah\ni think like i could absolutely see you\nat like 70 and like bent over and like\ntelling stories to your grandkids\nthey're like what\noh like 16 and they're like telling\nstories about\nyou know how grandpa used to do this and\nthat'd be nuts i think one to kind of\ntouch up on what you're saying\ni think i actually want to add something\nbecause i you know i think it's one of\nthe\nbiggest biggest issues with today's\nsociety and the way\nyou know i'm not sure if this is the way\nthe world is or just the way america is\num because because of america's social\nstructure and [ __ ] like that\nbut one of the biggest issues that i see\nis the lack of communication and honesty\nbetween people now what i mean by that\nis\neverybody has their issues\neverybody has issues that if they\ncommunicate with others\nand if they were honest about right and\ni'm not talking to people that aren't\nready to express them i'm talking about\npeople who are\nuh uh um intentionally hiding them\nin order to front that their life is\nbetter than the other right\na good example of this is let's say um\nback in school\nthere was always group of kids that they\nwere miserable\nyou knew that like i knew at least they\nwere miserable studying for this exam\nthey hated it\nbut when the kid that had you know\na harder time paying attention would go\nask them for help or say hey is this\nreally easy for you they'd say yeah this\nis cake\ni knew this [ __ ] like five years ago\nright but in reality\nso now that person is gonna think that\nthey're dumb that person is going to\nthink that there's an issue the person\nis going to think the issues within\nthemselves\nright everyone's fronting to each other\neveryone's making their life seem\nabsolutely amazing like they're\nabsolutely perfect like they absolutely\nunderstand everything they have no\nstress they have no sadness they have no\nhappiness they have no this they have no\nthat\njust to look good for others and what\nthis does is sure in the short term you\nlook good you look like everything's\ngreat but you're the most sad\nand that sadness would be cured if you\njust can't get hey listen\nright comfort in others is so powerful\nif you can just be honest be like hey\nyeah [ __ ] terrible i had to study for\neight hours my parents made me i would\nbe honest right\nthe dude will feel much better like oh\n[ __ ] then i gotta go do the same right\nbut like that ripple effect of that\nsingle lie just to look good\nit causes so much [ __ ] i'm telling you\nlike and this applies to every field\nin every social situation for everything\nso i don't know how the [ __ ] we solve\nthat but\nthat's a big issue i've noticed\nthroughout my life\ndoes that make any sense yeah i think it\nmakes a lot of sense so you know we have\nan interesting thing that we\ntell our coaches which is kind of like\nso\nwe try not to be judgmental right like\nas a society\nwe say that judgments are bad like you\nshouldn't judge me like who are you to\njudge me\nyou know what i mean yeah like like so\nand like if we think about it\nlying and fronting is about did i use\nthat term right\nyeah fronting is about\navoiding a particular judgment or\ncreating a particular judgment right\nif i if i walk in before the test and i\nsay oh yeah i didn't really study for it\nbut i'm going to crush it and secretly i\nwas like\nlaboring away for 80 hours yeah last\nweek yeah\nand i want to make it look easy and i\nwant everyone to know you know how smart\ni am oh\n[ __ ] jobs you all have to study for\nthis [ __ ]\nyep i do quantum mechanics on the toilet\nyou know scrubs\nand it's so so we we say something\nthat's kind of interesting which\nhas been tricky for coaches to learn is\nthat i actually don't advocate for them\nto be non-judgmental\nwhat i advocate for is for them to be\nauthentic and compassionate\nand if your client is doing something\nbad\nyou absolutely judge them for it but you\ndo it with compassion you should be\nauthentic\nlike authentic and and authenticity and\ncompassion\ni think are like our biggest antidotes\nto a world\nfull of like lies and fronting\nright we have to like we have to hold\npeople accountable for\nwhat they say and they do but we should\ndo it in a compassionate way\nbecause i think non-judgmentalness is\nkind of tricky because\nlike if someone [ __ ] up what we're not\ngonna judge them for it like how does\nthat help anyone any\nyou know it's kind of weird but i think\nit's part of the\nyou know cancel culture and this kind of\nstuff is that like on the one hand we\njudge\nreally really harshly if it's sort of\nlike righteous\nand then on the other hand it's like you\ncan't you know\nif i give a talk on the internet about\nthe\nyou know mortality risk of obesity\nwith covid19 which there's an over\noverwhelming amount of data for\nsuddenly i'm fat shaming and it's like\ni'm not allowed to say that\nbecause someone's feelings are hurt and\nthey feel judged\nand that's sort of where like you know\nas a as a psychiatrist i realized a long\ntime ago\nyou know part of my job is to judge\npeople but to do so like they deserve\nhonesty for me like they deserve\nauthenticity from me\nyou know they deserve for me to not lie\nto them and then you have to be careful\nbecause\nthat's how you can turn into one of\nthese blunt [ __ ] where like i'm\ni'm a truth speaker i'm gonna go tell\neveryone how ugly they are because\nit is my ideal to be true but then you\nhave to temper that with compassion\ni hate that yeah that's the biggest\nproblem i notice right that there's this\nthere are these uh differing definitions\nof\nyou know real and fake you know\nauthentic and\nyou know uh disingenuous whatever the\n[ __ ] right\nand one of them is very childish and\nimmature and that's the one that i see\nuse the most\nright and it's if you're real you know\nyou never you never lie you see how it\nis right but it's like when you grow\nolder you realize it's not black and\nwhite\nright it's very subjective there's a lot\nof gray area right if i meet my\ngirlfriend's parents and i hate them\nright i can't be like hey what's up\n[ __ ] i don't [ __ ] like you but\ni'm [ __ ] your daughter\nright that's that's not right it's not\nright it might be how i\nfeel but not actually please don't kill\nme you know but\nright that's not right that says more\nabout me in a negative way than it does\na positive in a sense of realness right\nlike i like if if anything if i'm\nsomeone that is real right or someone\nthat was authentic\ni would have the maturity i'd have the\nrespect\nto understand that it doesn't matter how\ni feel about this individual right i'm\ndating his daughter i need to have\nrespect for him\nand i need to treat him kindly right and\nit's it's that simple\nright it's like so like these are the\nplayers in today's society yeah go ahead\nso like i see this a lot trained with\nwith um\nwith people that i work with that i\nwould call pseudo spiritual\nso like a lot of people that you know\ncome across\nmy world or like spiritual people who\nare like interested in spirituality\nsometimes it'll be like\nyou know if we do consulting for like a\ncompany or something like someone who's\nspiritual will show up\nlike people in our community you know\nthere's kind of spiritual and sometimes\npeople are pseudo spiritual and what i\nmean by that is they're like\nthey like they have a big ego about\nbeing spiritual but they're not actually\nlike\nthey may work hard and they may like\ntalk the talk but they're not really\nwalking the walk in the most important\nways\nand a good example of that is like so so\nlike you know people who sort of say\nthat\nyou know i'm gonna live in the present\nand\nand i want to be present focused and i\nwant to be like unattached\nyou know like they say these kinds of\nlike spiritual things so what that means\nis that like\neven though i have a girlfriend if like\nin the in the present moment if i want\nto [ __ ] someone else\ni'm going to [ __ ] him you know because\nthat's like me being like authentic\nto myself train i want to be like my\nauthentic self i don't want to be like\nyou know pinned down\nby like worldly conceptions and i'm\ngoing to be like in the present moment\nand authentic to myself\nand so this is like a classic example of\nlike a pseudo-spiritual person\nand it's really interesting because if\nyou look at um you know the system of\nyoga\nand and like their they kind of have\nthis hierarchy and what they say is that\nyou know truthfulness is really\nimportant but the\nmost important thing is ahimsa or\nnon-violence\nso truthfulness should always be subject\nto non-violence\nand so not hurting another human being\ntrumps truthfulness and all truthfulness\nshould only be\nshared if it is non-violent truthfulness\nand so there's kind of this hierarchy\nwhere like you're you're even if you're\ntrying to be an authentic person\nso we kind of say authenticity with\ncompassion with our coaches and i think\nthat's a big part of like what they do\nand like\ni think that's a big part of what our\ncommunity needs and craves\nis like you know this is something that\ni sort of dislike a little bit about\ntherapy i sometimes feel like therapy is\nway too non-judgmental\npersonally so i tend to be like a\njudgmental therapist\nwhere people will you know i'll be like\nwhat the [ __ ] man\nyou kind of [ __ ] up there and and so\nyou know some of my colleagues will\nnever say that to a client\nor therapist or patient and they'll be\nlike how could you ever you know\nand it's like i kind of feel like you\nknow\nthey know they're [ __ ] up i know they\n[ __ ] up we all know we [ __ ] up let's\ncall it what it is so that we can do\nsomething about it\nand especially in our community people\nneed to be called out for what they're\ndoing yes\nyou have to do that they're already\ngetting the babying treatment from their\nparents and friends right like\nthey need something like what you're\ndoing i agree with that completely at\nleast yeah i mean so i think it's\nimportant to be compassionate like it's\nnot calling them out for the sake of\nlike justice\nit's calling them out because it's like\nhey man if you made a mistake like let's\nwork on it\nso that you don't have to make that\nmistake anymore yes but pretending it's\nokay\nis not how you fix a problem you know\nagreed\num so i'm with you i know we're kind of\noff topic but i\ni think from a you know an addiction\nstandpoint uh\ntrained i thought it was like wonderful\nwhat you shared in kind of your journey\nand stuff um you know i think i'm i'm\nlucky that that you did\nmake it through right because it sounds\nlike a lot of the stuff that you were\ndoing was really dangerous i'm lucky\nyeah\nand i cannot emphasize this enough like\nthat is not an rng game that you guys\nwant to be playing\nit is not it's not at all it's terrible\nit's absolutely disgusting terrible\n100 um and it it well i'm gonna say this\none thing as well it takes listen\nit takes a piece of you away right i'm\nnot gonna be as dramatic\nyou know and and and reference it to\nlike one of those movie things where you\nknow when you kill someone it takes a\nsoul piece of your soul away but like it\ndefinitely takes a piece of something\naway from you\nwhen you touch these drugs i'd say any\ndrugs realistically like i'd say any\ndrugs i'd say even the softest of drugs\nyou don't even classify as drugs like\ni'm telling you like if i could go back\nthere's one thing i'd change\nit would be like even though it taught\nme a lot gave me a lot of experience\ni still would try to stay sober\nthe sober me it was different right like\nit i'm telling you it takes a piece\nit takes a piece away that you never get\nback\nso don't ever do it ever [ __ ] trash\nit's not worth\nyeah yeah i'll just say yeah\ncool man well caffeine doesn't count i'm\ndo caffeine happen no matter what you\nknow what i'm saying\ncaffeine standing being off caffeine is\nreally nice\nyeah it is because because then in two\nweeks when you drink it again it [ __ ]\njuices you\ni like that yeah man so any um\ni'm kind of thinking like i may like you\nwant to talk about meditation for a\nminute\nor any like last thoughts questions what\nare you how you feeling\n[Music]\num\nhmm\n[Music]\ni like you dr k i like you too i like\nyou\ndoc i like doc so there's\nit's fine dk hey dk\ndoctor that's that's\ni don't know is there anything else is\nthere anything else for you\nuh i mean i think so a lot of people i\nthink are going to be wondering\nhow do i get rid of my ego so i thought\ni would just share\nsome like a different a slightly\ndifferent kind of meditative technique\num for those also there's i'm so sorry\nto interrupt\nthere's also a tr so in between getting\nrid of ego there's a trap door\nokay it's the last hurrah for the ego\nand that trap door it is damn near\nsame as losing your ego you understand\nit is gaining an ego through the loss of\nyour ego when you lose your ego that's\ndifferentiating you from most people\ntherefore you find a new justification\nof why you're different\nwithout actually knowing you're\ndifferent and thinking you've lost your\nego and that's the last trapdoor you\nneed to [ __ ] pass before you actually\nlose it does that make sense\nmakes it's brilliant so this is\nsomething that one of my teachers in\nindia\nmonk told me like 17 years ago\nand it's it's awesome it feels really\nfull circle to hear it from you today\nso he said there are two kinds of ego\nthere's the regular ego\nand then there's the ego of having no\nego\ni've learned that one the hard way look\nat how spiritual i am look at how\negoless i am\nwhat's up [ __ ] get on my level\nget on my egoness level you scrubs\nget rekt shitties you all with your big\negos\nnot like me that's right well said\nwell said thank you um and and so it's\nit's interesting because the\nprocess of sublimating your ego it gets\nsubtler and subtler and subtler\num but i'll just share with you guys\njust like uh i mean we can hop off the\ncall if you want to or you can stay on\nbut i was just going to share a quick\ntechnique about um ego dissolution\ni can watch on stream just see more\nchannels we can do your thing i'll watch\non stream so you can just kind of\nconnect with everybody\nokay cool let's connect again for part\nsix we'll think of something for part\nsix i want to keep doing this\npart six has got to be something good we\ncan do story time we can talk about some\ncrazy [ __ ]\nwe'll talk about something okay we gotta\ndo part six soon\nand also uh uh also i'm to send you a\ncode where you can get my merch for free\nyou got to get this it would look great\non you i'm telling you uh okay\nthank you very much train i got you no\nproblem love you bye bye\nso who are we rating chat okay are we\nrating\ni candice is that is that are you guys\ntrolling me or like"
