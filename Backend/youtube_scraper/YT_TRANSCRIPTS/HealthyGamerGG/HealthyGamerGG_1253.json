    "transcript": "[Music]\nso what do you go by\na mass of roxa what do you prefer\nuh i guess we can go with proxa okay\nthat's one of the most people in the\ncommunity broxah it is\nand um thanks for coming on broxah um\nand uh so any questions about how this\nworks or anything like that\ndo you want some need some orientation\noh no not really i feel like\ni have a decent idea of what what's\nabout to happen okay what it's about\nso tell us what's about to happen\nexplain it to us\nyeah i'm curious what's about to happen\nokay\nwell you are gonna\nsome shitties are about to get wrecked\nwell i guess you'll be directing me\nthrough a solid and healthy conversation\nabout\ntoxicity and general mentality within\nthe gaming community\nand in this case the pro gaming\ncommunity in particular since i'm a pro\nplayer\nokay um yeah so i think that that's a\ngreat way to describe\num what we try to do here so let me see\nif i can um add kind of a caveat\nfor to it so brock's i think what i'd\nreally love to do is\nhelp learn about you as a person\nand kind of use so what we do at\nhealthygamer is we we try to like look\nat\nindividual people's experiences to give\nus an\ninsight into like broader phenomenon\nright so instead of like getting\nlet's say a psychological expert to talk\nabout incels\nwe actually want to talk to and in cell\nabout what their experience is\nand i think that when when we sort of\nhave that one-on-one perspective\nit actually gives us a lot of insight\ninto the community as a whole\num the other big thing that i'd love to\ndo today if i can in\nany way shape or form is actually help\nyou as a person\nso if there's anything that you um\nyou know i have a pretty varied\nbackground so if there's any\nthing that i've studied or learned or\nhad experience with that you think could\nhelp you\nthat's really my main goal um and\nand so if we learn about toxicity in the\nyou know pro-gaming community along the\nway like that's totally cool but i'm\nreally here to\nyou know kind of have a one-on-one\nconversation and try to help you if i\ncan\nsound good yeah yeah sounds really good\nso can you just tell me a little bit\nabout yourself roxa\nyeah i am uh 23 year old\nuh dane i'm from denmark okay i\nhave played league of legends\nprofessionally for the last four years\nokay first three years for team fanatic\nin europe now i just played one year for\nteam liquid in north america and just\ntransferred over to clg\nanother team over in north america okay\nso\nfor the time being right now i'm in\ndenmark waiting for my visa to be\napproved and then i'll be heading over\nto la to\nparticipate in the the league of legends\nleague over there\nokay wow congratulations thanks\nand so um can you help me understand\nlike how you got to playing law like\nwhen did you start playing league of\nlegends\nwell i guess i could go back to the\nbeginning of gaming and\nyeah so i've been gaming almost as\nfar back as i can remember it started\nwhen i was maybe\ni don't know let's say five years old\nplaying game boy playing a lot of\npokemon\non my my game boy um i have two older\ncousins who i've already\nalways looked up to a lot and they\nstarted playing pokemon and game boy so\nof course i had to do\ndo the same later they transfer to pc\ngames\nstarting with world of warcraft and they\ntaught me how to play world of warcraft\ni got into that\nlater we moved on to league of legends\nhow old were you when you\nstarted playing world of warcraft\nmust have been around eight nine years\nold or so wow\nokay i was pretty young i think it was\nlike third grade or something in school\nso it was it was pretty early and how\nold you said you were about five when\nyou started playing pokemon\nyeah that's that would be my guess so\nusually when i would start with\nwith these games i would be very young\ncompared to\nthe general player base and i wouldn't\nreally know what i was doing\nso i would have my cousins helping me\nlearn the game and like in world of\nwarcraft for example\ni i remember really clearly what\nhappened because they\nshowed me the game and i don't know how\nfamiliar\nyou are with world of warcraft but the\nway that the game functions yeah is that\nyou you create a character you go around\nyou\nyou do quests and you gain experience\nright and\ni didn't really understand how this game\nworked so instead of picking up the\nquests and doing\ni guess what you're supposed to do in\nthe game i just found some monsters\naround and i killed them\nand i just walked around killing\nmonsters and then eventually\ni couldn't really gain more experience\nbecause they're all\ngood yeah they were all grey they were\ntoo low level and i was just kind of\nstuck there not knowing what to do\nbecause i didn't know quests existed so\ni deleted the character created a new\none and i repeated you know\nthat was my experience like i had no\nclue what i was doing right\nand then eventually later on one of my\ncousins came in and he\nhe showed me the way you know and i feel\nlike\nin general for me when it comes to\ngaming that's that's\nlike how i got into it that's how my\nexperience has been and even\ncan i just a couple more questions about\nso what was that like when you\ndiscovered that you were kind of doing\nit wrong\ndo you remember when they showed you the\nway\ni don't remember exactly what my\nreaction to i guess\nif anything i was just impressed and you\nknow i was already looking up to my\ncousins right and then i was like\nwow these guys are so smart they're so\ngood at the game i remember here with\nworld of warcraft\ni was just making random characters and\nthen my older costume appeared on his\nhis warlock on you know his horse and\nwith his little imp\nand his different demons and i was like\nwow you know this guy he looks cool like\ni want to be a warlock too\nand then i created a warlock and now\nlooking back on world of warcraft my\noldest character is this warlock that i\ncreated back then\nbecause my of my cousin coming to to\nshow me how to do quests and all that\nright\nwow and and can you tell me about your\ncousins\nyeah so my cousins are three and six\nyears older than me\nokay and um that obviously means they've\nin general they've always been a bit\nmore experienced when we when they got\ninto games they've\nhad a better understanding because i was\nthe young one i sure\ni was younger i didn't really understand\nenglish to begin with\nand yeah in general i come from a game\nof family\nmost of my my close family a lot of my\nfamily in general\nhas played different games at one point\nwith world of warcraft in particular\nuh you know half of the family like\nmy mom dad sister my uncle\ncousins you know wow it was like a\nfamily thing almost like\nand um that has always been really\nexciting so in general games have always\nbeen a really big part of my life\nso if your parents are playing world of\nwarcraft they're just letting you run\naround\nkill boars delete characters and make\nthem again like they didn't\nteach you what no they got into the game\nlater oh okay\nthey were the type of parents who were\nbecause i was so\ncaught up into the game i was so excited\nabout this game right\nso they started playing the game as well\nit was like\nplay with me and learn the game\nalongside me and so kind of helped me\nwhen i was a bit confused and didn't\nknow what was going on\nthat actually sounds really rare i i\nvery rarely hear about parents picking\nup a video game because their kid is\ninterested in it\nit is a bit of a rare thing um\nand in that sense i definitely have some\npretty cool parents with pokemon on game\nboy\nit's the same i mean my mom my mom\nlearned how to play pokemon because her\nlittle kid had no clue how to proceed on\na bus and i sat there getting so\nangry you know and i just kept kept\ndying and dying and i didn't know\nhow to proceed and then she would come\nin and show me like\noh hey mass this is how you do i just\nread up on this and then\nyou know i could proceed and go go\nfurther in the game\nso she would see that you were\nfrustrated and would actually go and\nread about pokemon and then help you\nthrough it\nyes that's the that's the level where\nwe're speaking of here\nthat sounds quite remarkable to me\nyeah i have been i've been very lucky in\nthat since there's no doubt about that\nyeah you know it's interesting because\nyou said you you've been playing league\nof legends for four years and you're 23\nyears old\nno so i've played league of legends\nprofessionally for four years\nyeah i've played league of legends i\nstarted playing league of legends like\n10 11 years ago but it's four years ago\nthat i i started like actually playing\nit professionally\nyeah so i i think that that's\ninteresting because when i think about a\n19 year old pro league of legends player\nyou know you know we hear about these\nlike people like\num who are like you know start playing\nchess for example at a really young age\nand you have parents that will like\nencourage them arguably even force them\nto play chess will find tutors for them\nthere's a lot of like support\nright from the family to support this\nhobby which then becomes a profession\nand and this is the first time i've\ntalked to a lot of pro gamers worked\nwith a lot of pro gamers\ni mean most of them have a pretty common\nstory which is that they're\nyou know they had some problems actually\ngrowing up and things were hard in some\nway\nand and it seems like your parents were\nactually like quite supportive of your\ngaming\nwhich is not very common definitely\ni that there was periods where they were\nnot fully supportive of it\nbecause they thought it was it was a bit\ntoo much and\ni remember there was a period as well\nwhen i was\ni don't know let's say in fourth fifth\ngrade where i had\nthat they thought i was playing way too\nmuch world of warcraft so eventually i\nhad\none day a week where i was not allowed\nto play video games at all\nand then the other days i could it was a\nbit more free but this one day\ni wasn't allowed to to touch my pc and i\ncould go outside and play football or\nread a book or whatever it may be and\nand how did you\ndo you remember how you felt or how you\nreacted or what that conversation was\nlike where they said\nno games for one day well i wasn't\ni wasn't too happy about it at least\ninitially but\nto be fair it's i felt like it was kind\nof fair\nbecause i had so much freedom in general\ncompared to\na lot of my friends and especially now\nyou know hearing a lot of other people's\nstories i can easily see that i did have\na lot of freedom\nand my parents were really supportive\nand while\nsometimes i thought it was a bit boring\nnot being able to sit as a pc\ni think it was a good opportunity as\nwell to just do other things and have\nother interests\nespecially because they were so nice\neven letting me\nlike at the start of the week i could be\nlike uh\nthis week i'm not gonna play on\nwednesday or then the next week i'll be\nlike i'm not gonna play on friday and i\ncould even choose myself for it and then\ni could just pick whichever day and then\ni could make plans with a friend to go\nplay football or\nlike interesting do whatever you know do\na lot of homework whatever it may be\nright\nso plan a bit around it if i if i'm kind\nof filling in the gaps a little bit\nbrock so what i'm hearing is that\nactually because your parents\nwere so supportive you seem to be more\nokay with their restrictions\nyes i think that is fair to say yeah\ncan you tell me about your parents\nso yeah so my parents\nuh well my mom is an accountant my dad\nis a what's it called in english like a\ntrain\nconductor i believe those people that\ncontrol the trains check people's\ntickets all that kind of stuff make sure\neverything is functioning and\ni don't come from i feel like i come\nfrom a pretty\naverage family in the sense that we we\nwere not poor but we were not rich\neither\nso growing up i had everything i needed\ni never had the feeling that\nyou know i was missing out on something\nor if i if i wanted something then\ni would usually have it but we were not\nthe family to go on\nexpensive holidays or whatever either of\nmy\nmy my parents were kind of prioritizing\ntime\nuh with me and my sister rather than\nyou know just constantly working and in\nthat sense growing up i've always\ni guess appreciate it i appreciate this\nfamily time appreciated\nspending time with the people around me\nbecause\nwhile them being home a little bit more\nthan perhaps some other parents meant\nthat we didn't have a big load of money\nwe had a lot of great moments and\nopportunities to spend\nspend time together\nyeah it sounds like they really\nprioritize prioritize\ntime with you yeah definitely\nand supporting you and it sounds like\nyou have a sister\nyeah i have a i have two siblings\nactually um so\ni grew up with my sister my little\nsister was three years younger than me\nand i have a little brother who is\n15 years younger than me who i'm slowly\nturning into a little\na little gamer he's already starting to\ntalk about fortnite and doing his\nfortnight dances and all that good stuff\nso soon enough we'll get them on the\nlegends hype train but for now\nit's fortnite focused yeah\nyou know it's interesting i have a\nfive-year-old and three-year-old\nand um i you know i tried to teach my fi\ni try to teach my five-year-old how to\nplay games cause you know i'm a pretty\nbig gamer\nshe seemed to be relatively uninterested\nand\nand you know like i tried to teach her\nlike mario kart and stuff because like\nyou know i had the i had the wheel\nand so i was thinking oh she's gonna\nhave the wheel and you know her brain is\nnew so it can learn how to do things\nquickly\nshe just is not that interested as it\nturns out my three-year-old\num so you know when they're now they're\npretend playing it seems like like my\nthree-year-old is one of us\nbecause so so my older one pretends to\nbe like a queen\nand a princess and has like teacups and\nthings like that and the younger one\nis um the most recent character\nshe was pretending to be was a dragon\nthat was dual wielding a sword and a\nknife\nand so i was very surprised because i've\nnever showed her dual wielding\nwhich i was really surprised because but\nshe was like yeah i have a dagger in one\nhand and i have a\nknife in the other and and so\nthe older one is queen of the you know\nqueen of whatever kingdom\nand then the younger one says i'm queen\nof the demons\nand it's bizarre but you know maybe\nshe's one of us\num it certainly would appear so what's\nup\nyeah go ahead sorry uh it's it's a while\nago i showed my\nmy little brother league of legends for\nthe first time he was probably\ni know four or five years old and you\nknow i was\ni was sitting at my my dad's place my\nparents are divorced now\num and i was playing league of legends\nand\nthis little guy was sitting on my lap\nand i i just wanted to enter a normal\ngame i don't even remember if it was\nnormal or against bots because\nit was pretty hard playing with this\nlittle guy sitting there and trying to\ncontrol my keyboard and all sorts but\ni'm then going into the game he he\ndecided that we were going to play fizz\nto champion fizz and then he found this\ngreat skin\nwhere it's basically a rabbit a rabbit\nskin\nand we were we were having a great game\nand we were walking around killing\neveryone and\nyou know every time we got a kill he was\nlike yay and cheering for me and\nnow it still happens sometimes you know\nhe's like\nmass when are we gonna play the rabbit\nagain i want to see you on the on the\nrabbit or\nif he watches one of my one of you know\nthe games i play with my team he's like\nwhy didn't you play the rabbit\nwhich is pretty cool good question mass\nwhy didn't you play the rabbit like no\nit's disappointing\ni know but that's the way it goes i\nguess does he understand\num so i know we're supposed to be\ntalking about toxicity in league of\nlegends and whatnot\nis it okay that we're like talking about\nthis yeah it's fine\nso does he understand that you're a pro\ngamer\nhe does he so\nwhen i when i played for fanatic\ni was pretty fortunate in the sense that\nfnatic had these\nyou know the all teams do these player\njerseys and stuff it's fnatic there's\nplayer jerseys and shorts in like size\nfor a free four year old or something\nand my little brother got one of these\nand he was\ntaking his shirt on um in well i guess\nit would have been kindergarten back\nthen\nand he was going my dad was telling me\nthat he was going around in kindergarten\nand being like oh\nlook guys i have a fanatic shirt on and\nhey do you know that my\nmy big brother is broxah you know\nbragging so to the people working that\nwhat not\nyeah he is he's a very\nsupportive little brother too and he he\ndoes know quite a bit about\ngaming and what not by by now i think\ni i guess i'm a i'm both a good and bad\nexample in a sense because\ni'm sure that eventually my uh my dad\nand his girlfriend\ni'm gonna have a bit of a difficult time\ngetting this guy away from the pc\nbecause he's just gonna point at me and\nbe like what do you mean my brother's\nplaying video games all day long but\nyeah but but yeah he does he does\nknow and understand what what my job is\nwhat's it like to have a little brother\nwho looks up to you so much\nit's uh\ni don't know i'm trying to find a word\nto describe it but i guess if\nanything it just it's just really\ninteresting and exciting and\ni guess it's i feel sometimes that it\nputs some pressure on me and\nas well in a way to you know perform and\nto live up to this\nthis little guy's expectations\nbut in a sense when it comes to that um\nlike my family in general has never\nreally put too much\nvalue on like they don't care too much\nabout\ni mean they care about how i perform and\nhow my team is doing\nbut usually the moments where i have\nfelt\nthat like my mom for example has been\nthe most proud of me was when i had like\na really good\ninterview where i acted really\nprofessional or nice\nrather than when i was at my absolute\npeak as a player\nbecause usually when i perform as a\nplayer and when the team is doing really\nwell\nthey're happy because i'm happy yeah\nand when we're not doing so well you\nknow they don't really appreciate it\nbecause i'm kind of\nsad and frustrated but usually they've\nbeen the most proud in some of those\nmoments\nwith with things happening out of the\ngame\nand for my for my little brother i don't\nknow it's probably a bit of a mix of\neverything because he doesn't really see\neverything with\nin the same light i mean he's probably\nthe most excited to know that i'm a pro\ngamer right\nyeah i i it seems it sounds to me like\nyour parents don't\nyou know your parents value you\noutside of your performance in your job\nyes exactly right so it actually sounds\nquite different i don't know if you've\nheard the term\ntiger parents no not really\nso it's it's like parents who um\nwant their children to be really really\nsuccessful and almost like use their\nchildren like trophies so i i grew up in\nthe indian community where\num three out of the five indian kids\nin my school became doctors okay\nand and usually the first words out of\nmy mom's mouth when she's talking about\nsomeone that i haven't heard of in 10 or\n15 years\nis whether they're a doctor or not okay\nand and so you know some cultures and\nsome parents will want their children to\nbe\nmy parent my mom is not a tiger parent\nby any means but\num you know they really want their\nchildren to be like successful\nand like if their children go to\nprestigious universities or have\nprestigious jobs or make lots of money\nthat makes them like really really happy\nand they like value their kids for being\nsuccessful\nsounds like your parents really were not\nlike that\nor aren't like that oh like i could\ni could quit being a pro gamer and\ni could go back to my studies and i\ncould i could\nbecome whatever it may be and obviously\nthere's\nsome you know they're proud of me for\nwhat i've accomplished and they're proud\nof me for\nyou know being a pro gamer in in a sense\nbut\nthey wouldn't care if i was\nworking at a supermarket or whatever it\nit may be working at mcdonald's\nlike as long as that's what made me\nhappy they would be\nhappy too the other thing that i wanted\nto just point out is\ni'm noticing a remarkable similarity\nbetween\nwhat your cousins did for you and what\nyou're doing for your brother yeah i\ni guess you could you could say that in\na way\nhow does it do like i'm just i'm\nnoticing it on the surface\nif you is that thought ever crossed your\nmind that because it kind of seems like\nyou're shepherding your brother in the\nway that your cousins like kind of\nshepherded you\ni think for me it's gonna be maybe maybe\nsomewhat perhaps a middle ground between\nthe two\npartly because usually um\nlike i don't get to see my family that\nmuch because i'm i'm\ntraveling and i'm away from most of the\nyear uh\nlike this year for example i was away\nfor eight months and\noftentimes when i'm home and i'm on\nholiday i don't\ni don't feel like playing as much i\noftentimes i want to get away from the\npc\nbecause i sit in front of it playing\nleague of legends all day for so much of\nthe year\nso i don't think my brother feels like\nhe plays\nas many games with me as he wants to\nbecause\nhe wants to play 24 7 right and i\ni want to play a bit but i want to do\nother things too so\ni'm i'm the type of big brother who\ndoes play games with him but who also\ntries to get him to\nyou know go play football or get away\nwow get away for good\ni think he's very lucky to have you\nbroxah because it sounds like\ni i hope i hope so yeah it sounds like\nyou're teaching him a lot about\nbalance and gaming right that you can\nhave fun but you should also prioritize\nother things this is coming from someone\nwho plays games for a living\nso i i hope he hears that message loud\nand clear\num i hope so too and and tell me a\nlittle bit about\num so i i guess we've got kind of two\ndirections i know i've been asking you\nabout a lot of stuff that has nothing to\ndo with league of legends or toxicity\nso you know i'm a little bit curious\nabout two things so i'll let you kind of\npick unless and of course if you want to\ntalk about something by all means dive\ninto it one is we sort of left off\nwith you discovering league of legends\nso we could kind of pick back up with\nyou starting to play league of legends\nhow you became a pro\num uh option two is i'm a little bit\ncurious about um\nyour parents divorce and just what that\nwas like if you feel like that's worth\ntalking about\num and then the third thing would be you\nknow if you just want to talk about\ntoxicity and like\nkind of cut straight to the chase we can\ndo that because we've been kind of\nyou know we've been sitting in the lobby\nfor a while now\num but you know what\ni don't know i we could go for option\none or two i guess and get to the the\ntoxicity stuff a bit later okay\ncan you just tell me uh quickly just a a\nquick overview of\nyour understanding of why your parents\ngot divorced and what that was like for\nyou\num i don't think i want to go into\nexactly why they got the most\nbut i can i can explain kind of what is\nwhat it was like\nso um as a as a kid\nit never seemed like my parents had any\nproblems actually they were\nthey seemed really happy together our\nfamily was really happy and yeah\ncertainly i was having a really nice\nchildhood\num but then uh kind of what seemed like\nfrom\nfrom one day to another we were sitting\nat the dinner table and you know\nthey they sat there telling me and my\nsister like hey\nwe uh we're gonna we're gonna break up\nwe're gonna have a divorce\nand at first i was very surprised\nbecause\ni didn't really see it coming i didn't\nreally expect it\nand it was it was pretty difficult at\ntimes\ndealing with um especially when\nseemingly it came\nkind of out of nowhere right\nand i think in a sense\nafter that gaming was a bit of an escape\nat least at times because i was already\ngaming a lot right but\num most people this that when when\nthey're dealing with something if\nthey're stressed if they're having\nnegative emotions sometimes just\nopening up a video game and just living\nthrough like\nthat experience at least for a couple of\nhours can help take focus away from all\nthe\nthe frustrating things you're dealing\nwith so through\nsome of those periods i definitely was\nwas using it a little bit\nuh as an escape but at the same time\nthey were not having like a really bad\ndivorce or brutal divorce by any means\nthey actually\nhandle it really well and um even now my\nparents can still\nyou know have conversations together and\nwhatnot so\num that that's also pretty lucky that we\navoided a lot of those problems that\nsome parents are having when they're\nhaving intervals\nyeah i mean part of the reason that i\nasked is because i was a little bit\nsurprised to hear that your parents did\nget divorced because\nyou know just like you said it's kind of\nunexpected right\nyeah um i think i think that's how it\nwas for\na lot of people back then it was a bit\nunexpected and then\nwhen something unexpected happens that\nkind of catches you a bit of god then\nyou get a bit stressed you get a bit out\nof it and during\nthose periods where i didn't feel that\ngreat about it\num i don't remember if i was playing\nworld of warcraft or league back then\nbut whichever i was i was using the game\nas\na bit of an escape sometimes and you\nknow just grinding grinding the game\nand what was difficult about it for you\num\ni don't know i guess most of all all the\nuncertainties all the the question marks\nbecause i was happy with our family\nsure and in general i'm not the type of\nperson who appreciates\nchange if something is working you know\ni don't i don't want it to change and\nfor me as a kid\nlife was great you know we were having a\ngreat little family and i didn't want\nanything to change in that family\nand i i think that was the the toughest\nthing to deal with and i'm sure that's\nhow\num a lot of a lot of kids or teenagers\nor even\nolder people feel when their parents get\ndivorced right it's it's a big change\nand\nsometimes it can be stressful and kind\nof confusing to\nunderstand what's happening and navigate\nthrough that well yeah because it's\nreally hard to understand what's\nhappening right it doesn't\nseem to make sense you don't know what\nthe future is going to hold\nyou really like the way your family is\nnow you don't\nall you know is that it's going to\nchange\nit can't be good because you're pretty\nhappy with what you have now\nyeah exactly it's hard man i hear you\num yeah so and so it sounds like you\nstarted playing league of legends when\nyou were like maybe\n13 12 13 something like that yeah\nexactly\naround around that i i got into league\nand again one of my my cousins\nintroduced me to the game\ni still remember it pretty clearly\nbecause we were gonna have our own\nlittle two-man\nland party and play most of the night\nand\nback then i was really into world of\nwarcraft like i i\nloved world of warcraft so much and i\nthought we were just going to play world\nof warcraft all night but then\neventually at some point in the evening\nhe was like\nhey mass i found this new game that i\nwant to show you and\nthen you know i installed league of\nlegends and\nwe played a couple of games and i don't\nthink it took more than a couple of\nmonths\nand i was uh i was better than he was\nall of a sudden because i had just been\nplaying it so much and i was so excited\nand into it and the same thing happened\nwith both pokemon\nand world of warcraft by the way like\nthey they were\nso good at these games and it was so\nhard for me to catch up but eventually i\nwould just be\nbe so hooked that i i don't think\ni necessarily got better better than\nthem at world of warcraft but i was\ndefinitely spending\nmy fair share of hours improving and\nlearning\nabout the game and and how did you\ncan you tell us what the journey of\nbecoming a pro looked like\nyes so in\nso with pokemon with world of warcraft\nand\neven the first five six years of playing\nleague of legends\ni was just playing for fun i just\nthought it was really fun i enjoyed\nplaying\nafter school with with my friends and\nfor league of legends in particular in\nthe first season\ni was not great at the game i was i\nthink i ended\nthe first season in bronze uh which was\nthe absolute lowest dragon of players\nthe next season i i climbed up a bit\ntowards gold\nand then season 3 in my first year\nthat's when i really started playing the\ngame seriously and i\ni started actually meeting some of the\npro players in my games and started\nproving in that sense and in my my first\nyear\nof high school i like i just slowly\nstarted taking it\nmore seriously started playing a bit\nmore solo because\ni really enjoyed the competitive part of\nit that i\ni hadn't experienced that much before\nsure and it fit really\nit kind of resonated with me because i'm\na really competitive person\nas well so i was just playing a lot of\nsolo games climbing the ladder\nand in my my first year of high school\ni got to challenge her top 200\nin europe for the first time but\neven then i just thought it was a cool\nachievement i didn't really consider\nbecoming a pro player and\ni think more than anything my i mean my\nfriends really enjoyed bragging about\nknowing a challenger and when we saw the\ngame and they were\nyou know they they started bragging and\nall chat about how they have to\nchallenge you on the enemy team doesn't\nyou know they were having a lot of a lot\nof fun and bragging\nbragging for me but i just enjoyed\nthe competitive side of it meeting pro\nplayers was really exciting getting to\nplay against them\num get to know some of them and just\nlearn\nhow did the pro player life functions\nit's interesting i'm not hearing that\nyou brag very much but it seems like a\nlot of people about\naround you brag about you\ni don't know maybe i brag sometimes\nmaybe maybe some of my\nmy family friends um or girl girlfriends\nconsider me a person that brags about\nmyself i don't think i'm the worst\noffender at this\num but yeah anyways\nthen in the so\nin my in my second year of high school\num\ni was invited by some danish friends to\nstart playing in danish lad events and\ntournaments around denmark\nso we were traveling from city to city\nand\ni don't know how many tournaments we\nplayed maybe five or so but we basically\nwon all of them and\nuh earned a little bit of money for that\nwhich was which was great because\ni was just in school i wasn't learning\nanything at the time\nand then\neven then it was just you know it was\njust fun like i just enjoyed it there\nwas a great experience and i\ni didn't really want the team that\npracticed a lot because\ni wanted to have time for for friends\nand school\nand family and it kind of fits really\nwell with the way that\ni've been growing up and what my parents\nhave taught me which is that\num that there should be time for games\nor whatever i want to do\nbut the main thing is that i take care\nof my homework and that\ni'm actually doing my job in school\nbecause what happens with a lot of\npeople and what i've seen with\na lot of the people in my classes um\nwait are you in school and a pro player\nno i i'm not in school anymore okay\nbut yeah what happens to\na lot of people is that they just get so\naddicted to\ngames or whatever it may be and then\nthey stop doing homework entirely so\nit's like they're doing well on the\ngaming side but then they don't do\nanything on the school side and\nlife kind of falls apart where my\nparents made it really clear that i\ncould play games\nbut i have to do my homework otherwise\nthere's no mercy yeah\nthat's kind of the deal we had which\nwhich was fair so\nin high school i when i started getting\ninvites to\nsimilar professional professional teams\ni didn't really want to do it because i\ncouldn't really\nsee how to make life work and how i\nwould be happy having both\nand then when i finished high school all\nright before i finished high school i\nhad a conversation\nwith my mom about about my future\nbasically\nwhat i wanted to do and\ni couldn't really see myself continuing\nmy studies for that next year\ni kind of needed a break and i couldn't\nreally see\nmyself in any of the possible jobs\neither like i had i had pretty good\ngrades and\ni had some different options but\nyou know now sitting down having that\nconversation was when i really realized\nwow this could be my chance to actually\nmake a living out of gaming to try to be\na pro player because before that i just\ni just always had fun but i didn't\nreally consider it that way but\nwhen i reached that point and had to\nmake that big decision of\ngoing to the university or being a pro\nplayer\ni couldn't do both anymore i had to to\nmake a choice\nbecause i i just wouldn't have have any\nopportunity to be a competitive player\nif i didn't\ngo for it at that point in time so then\nafter the the summer holiday that year\ni started playing a lot more solo queue\ni\nspent most of my time playing solo queue\nactually initially i was looking for\njobs like i looked for jobs at all the\nsupermarkets and\num mcdonald's wherever it may be like i\nthink i\nsearched jobs in like 50 different\nplaces and i didn't get anything\nand then i was like okay i'm not getting\nany jobs anyways so you know what i'm\njust going to go all in on league of\nlegends and hope for the best\nif you got a job at mcdonald's you may\nnot be a pro today\nyeah things would have been different\nright because maybe my priorities would\nhave changed a bit maybe i wouldn't have\nenough time to practice\nyeah i don't know but so then i just\nwent all in\nand i think that was in it's in\nseptember maybe and\nat the start of january not january at\nthe start of november sorry\ni think it was november mid-november\nmaybe i got in talks with\nfnatic it was by far the biggest\neuropean esports organization at the\ntime\nbecause i knew i knew that coach who\nused to be a professional\nplayer too and who i had a good\nrelationship with and\nhe was like you know what i think you're\na good player i want you on the academy\nteam\nso i i started playing for the academy\nteam in\naround that time end of november start\nof december and\nthen february i was thrown right onto\nthe main team\nand now i've been a pro player ever\nsince\nwhat's it like being a pro league of\nlegends player\nit's it's really exciting\nbut i i would say it's the type of job\nthat does\nups and downs to i think it's it's a\nreally awesome job but i'm really\nhappy about all the things i've\nexperienced these past four years\nbut there's also some downsides to it\nbut because it's also a really stressful\njob and with my personality and the way\nthat\ni function as a person like wanting to\nbalance life wanting\nbecause as i told you like when growing\nup family time\nwas so important and having that time\nwith close ones\nwith family friends with my girlfriend\nwhile being a pro player while living on\nthe other side of the world\nsome of those things are kind of you're\nin a relationship right now\ni am in a relationship yes how long have\nyou been in that relationship\ni have been in that relationship for\nover four years\noh wow yeah so\nbasically well ever since i got into it\nall i've been in the relationship\nokay so\nso you said their downsides and and\nwhere does toxicity kind of come in\nyeah so um\ni guess if we\ni think toxicity has been a pretty big\none that i've always had a\npretty difficult time understanding\num let's say this year in particular i\nthink this year is a pretty good example\nfor me\nbut it's not going to happen throughout\nmy entire career but this year\num i was on the other side of the globe\nin la\ni um was in a lockdown\nmy team wasn't doing too well things\nwere not going the way we had hoped for\nand then you know\ncriticism hateful comments all that sort\nstarted\nappearing everywhere especially in my\nprivate messages and the sorts\ncomments and social media all that good\nstuff and\nwait people would dm you hate messages\nyeah\nthe way that it works in general is that\nif you are a pro gamer and i don't think\nthis is only the case in league of\nlegends i think it's the case in general\nyou need to be really strong mentally\nbecause\nthere's a lot of good things happening\nbut whenever something\nbad happens or whenever things are not\ngoing your way or your team's way\nsome people tend to forget that and\ni like an example could be even\num my best year as a pro player so far\nhas been\n2018 where we went all the way to the\nworld final\num and i was considered one of the best\njunglers\nin the world at the time and i think all\nreally in the next\nuh split or maybe even right when we\ndropped out of worlds\npeople started getting angry at us\nbecause it's like this team reached the\nworld final but they didn't win\nso they must suck you know they they\nwent zero free this is not good enough\nthey haven't represented\nthe region well and then obviously it's\na minority feeling that way\nusually most of the time it's a minority\nbut\nthat minority kind of adds up and\nrecently i i put out a video\ntalking about all this toxicity and i\nsaw a lot of\npro players and influencers chiming in\nsaying that\nkind of agreeing with me saying that\nit's kind of frustrating that you\nif you're a public figure you have to\ndeal with all these things\num because the reality is if you're a\npublic figure within the gaming\ncommunity if you're not really strong\nmentally\nyou're just gonna break you're not gonna\nbe able to handle it because you can't\nreally hide\nfor me for example i have i have\naccounts on all\npossible social medias at this point\nalmost um\ni have a youtube channel i have a twitch\nstream i have all the social medias and\npeople have so many ways of getting\ngetting in touch with me or of writing\nthings that\ni'm almost certainly gonna read right\nand\nfor a lot of people um\none comment two comments ten comments\nthat are negative and hateful\ndoesn't mean too much but eventually it\nkind of adds up right\nand it becomes really difficult to deal\nwith to the point where\nat times i feel like people are just\ngetting bullied\nlike it's just too obnoxious and there's\na really\nbig difference between productive\ncriticism or productive feedback and\nreally offensive language and death\nthreats and\nall these type of things right death\nthreats\ni i'm pretty lucky in the sense that i\nhaven't gotten\nway too many but it would happen once in\na while that\ni was part of losing a really important\ngame or my team lost a really important\ngame\nand i kind of had to hide from my my dms\non twitter for a little while let's just\nput it that way because again it's a\nminority\nbut what is that what does that do to\nyou you say you have to be mentally\nstrong so let's say like i open up my\ntwitter\ndms and like what's an example of a\nmessage that you would see\num i mean i\ni don't think i should mention some of\nthe worst ones i think\nyeah sure but so you know some people\nit could be anything from people stating\nthat i'm i'm bad or that i'm garbage\nand that i should quit the game which is\nyou know\nokay that's an opinion i can deal with\nthat it's not productive criticism but\nit's an opinion\nso people that say that i i shouldn't be\nliving life anymore and that\ni i don't deserve to live and that you\nknow i've done all sorts of things to\ntheir team and\nthat it's you know and they start saying\nvery bad things because of that\nrate and i think\nsometimes it can be a little extra as a\npro player\nor as an influencer like you you get\nmore messages right because you're in\nthe spotlight\nyou have to listen to this more because\nyou're kind of an easy target in that\nsense and\nespecially for the people streaming and\nwhatnot you know\nthe chat can be a bit a bit ruthless at\ntimes\nit doesn't take much for people to to go\noff in there\nbut it happens to a lot of people within\nthe community i think that was the most\npeople even\nuh for just you know regular\npeople playing the game yeah and and\nwhat does that do to you broxah\nlike when you see that message what's\nyour experience\nin those like walk me through the next\nfew moments of what\nhappens to you i i think it depends of\nthis\nit depends a bit on the state of mind\nthat i'm in\num let's say if i'm in a period where\nthings are not working that well where\num\nthings are not going well with the team\nwhere i feel like i'm not performing\nthat well maybe there's something\npersonal that i'm dealing with\nit's really hard you know you see some\nof these really really hateful things\nand you start questioning yourself quite\nheavily\nand it takes quite a lot to\nhave all those question marks in your\nhead and still you know power\npower through and be confident in\nyourself what are the question marks\num again it could be stuff like\num am i am i good enough to play this\ngame am i letting the team down\nam i a good enough person am i a good\nexample for this community\nbecause some people perceive me this way\nit could be stuff like if i am being\ntreated this way as a human being what\nam i even doing here like why do i\nbother\nhaving this job if i just get depressed\nfrom some of these things\npeople tell me why don't i have another\njob where i'm being treated properly um\nwhy do i put up with the abuse yeah\nbasically like why why do i put up with\nthis why do i have to accept this this\nis\nunfair this is ridiculous this is not\nthe way that things should be\nand i think and and that's the main\nissue that i feel like it it doesn't\nreally make sense that\nyou have to like you shouldn't have to\nbe really strong mentally to function\nanywhere let's say with gaming is with\nsecular people play video games because\nit's\nit's fun you know it's just fun it\nshould be fun\nbut if you are met with a lot of hate\nconstantly then that's\nnot very very easy to deal with that's\nreally really difficult and\nagain for a pro player it's it's one\nthing because\nyou are in the spotlight but even for\nsome of my my friends you know they they\ncan also get fed up with\nplaying a game and people start\nslaughtering them with offensive\nmessages or\npeople at them after the game and tell\nthem really obnoxious things\nsocial media i\nthat's a good question how do i deal\nwith it\num\ni think the way\nthat i try to deal with it is\ni consider myself a really strong person\nmentally\nand i've always been confident in myself\nmy own abilities um\nand i think that alone has helped a lot\nlike no matter what i've had to go\nthrough no matter what\nproblems has come my way i've just told\nmyself that\nno i'm in this position for a reason and\ni deserve to be here and\ni'm good enough both as a player as a\nperson and then\nsometimes when i felt necessary or\ni i needed to vent out i would go to\nsome of my close ones\num i would go to a coach or a teammate\nand be like hey\nyou know this this is bothering me this\nis\non my mind people are telling me this\nand that what do you think\ni should what do you think about my\nperformance\nhow do you think i'm doing in terms of\nthe team how do you think i'm\ni am i am as a person and\njust to get some some proper feedback in\nthe way i guess you could say\nyeah because obviously most of the\nthings that are are coming from like\nexternal sources and from social media\npeople within the game whatever it might\nbe a lot of the\nthe really obnoxious comments are coming\num\ni mean some of them are very\nquestionable and i can't really\nunderstand why people behave that way\nbut some of them are just really\nemotional and frustrated and they might\nhave their own problems to deal with\nright and i just\ntry to tell myself okay you know if\nsomeone\nfeels okay writing this to another\nperson then\nyou know i kind of feel sorry for the\nperson like there's no point getting\ngetting mad over this this problem\nthis person probably needs even more\nhelp than me yeah\nit's interesting because i mean you talk\nabout mental strength\nand and i think the interesting thing\nthere is that you\nso you have this voice when when so\nhere's what i'm\ngonna try to piece together um\nso you know this let's say you have a\nbad\nplacement in a tournament or something\nlike that right and then you say you\nkind of got to avoid\nyour dms for a while so like you open\nyour dms and you see a message that's\nkind of hateful\nthey tend to pile up and then you start\nto doubt\nright you start to ask yourself like hey\nare these guys actually right like\ndo i deserve to be here and then so\nthere's like the doubt about your\ncapability and there's a separate thing\nwhich is like\nit feels really unfair it feels like you\nshouldn't have to put up with this\nand so there's this sort of feeling of\nlike\nyeah like it's like doubt in yourself\nand also separate from that\nthis is unfair and i no one should have\nto deal with this\nyou know why why do i have to do this\nand then like as you start to those\nthose kind of feelings can kind of grow\nmaybe with the more messages that you\nget and you can kind of discard some of\nthem right like you can\nyou can ignore 10 of them you can ignore\n20 of them you can ignore 30 of them but\nthen\nas you have all these different social\nmedia channels and they start pounding\nyou from the left and the right\nand like all over the place youtube\ntwitch\nyou're you're streaming and then some\nhaters show up in your channel and then\nyou log off and you open up twitter and\npeople are [ __ ] talking you\nand it kind of piles up and then you end\nup with these two doubts\nand then something really interesting\nhappens because what i'm hearing you say\nis that you actually\ntell yourself i do deserve to be here\nand that's a really really interesting\npoint because i think that a lot of\npeople\ndon't have that voice\nright a lot of people actually the\nreally unlucky ones will actually have a\nvoice\ntelling them the opposite yeah\nand some people will even have you know\npositive messages\nand then they have a voice in their head\nthat tells them that these people don't\nreally know who you\nare they're just being nice you know\nyeah for sure uh you're smiling as if\nyou\nunderstand which is yeah\nno i i'm just kind of thinking of what\nyou're saying especially about\nbeing confident in myself and that's the\nvoice in my head and\nin my first year as a pro player we had\nwe had a really good sports sports\npsychologist was working with a lot\ndue to conf yeah confidence especially\ni was so nervous like i didn't i didn't\nfeel ready to play for the main team\nin my first games i was literally you\nknow physically shaking on stage\ni was so nervous it was so hard to play\nhigh-pressure games and\nin the past with with exams and all\nthose things like\nit would be the same thing like i just\ncouldn't perform i got too nervous\nbut then um this guy came in and\nreally helped me a lot working on my my\nconfidence and my\nhe called it negative self-talk in\nparticular trying to\nreally think about the way that i'm\nlike the voice in my head basically how\ni'm thinking to myself and what that\nvoice is\nis doing to me in those moments\nand that's something i i got better at\nand started\nkind of taking with me\nbecause i don't know\nlike part of why why i was was smiling\nwhat was thinking about that and like\nhonestly\nif i wasn't so confident in myself i\nprobably\ni mean it's not really a feast to smile\nbut i can't probably would have broke at\nsome point like mentally i would just\nhave quit\nwhich is part of why i think it's a big\nproblem because\ni consider myself really really strong\nmentally and that's probably\na lot of people out there were stronger\nthere's also a lot of people who are not\nbut if i felt that\nmy confidence in myself and my own\nabilities\nmy confidence in myself as a human was\nthe main thing that\nyou know kept me going in this job and\nin this community\nthen that's kind of a problem because\nthere's gonna be\ncountless of people out there who are\njust going to kind of break mentally and\nwe're not going to be able to handle it\nand\ni i don't i don't really like the\nthought of that\nthat's not the way things should be yeah\nso i think there are a couple of uh\ni guess i've got kind of two threads two\nor three threads one is\ni'm sure a lot of people are curious um\nyou know what that sports psychologist\ntold you and how you managed\nto change that voice in your head i\nthink that's something that a lot of\npeople\nare very very interested in um\nanother thing to kind of think a little\nbit about is you say that you are\nmentally strong i'd agree\nand i i don't really consider that\narrogant or anything like that i think\nthat you do have a lot of confidence in\nyourself\nwe can explore a little bit about where\nthat comes from and how to find it\nthe third thing um that i just want to\ntoss out is that sometimes especially\nwhen it comes to issues of toxicity\nwe're still sort of talking in the\nabstract and\nyou know so this is something that i\nwant to be really careful about\nuh sometimes it can be very very helpful\nto take an\nactual case of raw data of\nuh like and walk through it in more\ndetail\nnow i know that some people are\nconcerned about that because\nin that process if you talk about\ntoxicity and we use an actual example\nthere you know people may know who\nyou're talking about if it's a public\nfigure or things like that so i want to\nbe really careful\nwe're not here to really like um you\nknow point fingers or anything like that\nwe're really here to focus on is\nis kind of your experience and how to\ndeal with toxicity\nbut at the same time you know i have\nfound that generally speaking when\npeople give\nwhen we go through raw data it can be\nvery very illustrative\nas opposed to talking things abstractly\nbecause i'm still not sure\nbroxah like anyone who's watching this i\ndon't know how this actually helps\nanyone in a concrete way does that make\nsense like we've heard a lot about it\ni i completely i completely see that\nright so\nso and i think that's where so these are\nthree options i think it sort of depends\non what you feel comfortable with\nor what you think would be useful\ni'm not sure i think the\nthe mental strength one would be a good\nplace to start\nbecause i think that's something that\ncould help\na lot of people and that's really\nimportant sure\nokay um so the mental strength when you\nmean so not the sports psychologist but\nwhere confidence comes\nyeah i i guess so like honestly i'm not\ni'm not even sure exactly where it comes\nfrom but yeah i\ni i'm pretty sure why i'm so interested\nin this one yeah yeah so that's\nremember we're here to help you right so\nit's like your questions so like that's\na great question so let's talk about\nthis\nwhere does your confidence come from\nwell the first thing that comes to my\nmind is you know\nall the all the work that i put into it\ni guess like\nall the the hard hard work all the hours\nthat that has gone into it\ni'm a really structured person so\nwhen i approach a task or a problem\ni usually go into it in a really\nstructured way and really really clear\nplan of what i'm gonna do and\ni kind of have you know my days almost\nset in stone right from the from the\nbeginning\nbecause that way i feel i feel like i'm\ngonna be productive i feel like i have a\nreally clear plan in my head\nof what what the day is going to bring\nand how at the end of that day\ni will have learned something i will\nhave\nproved one way or another okay\nlike let's say uh it could be\nso i'm gonna i'm gonna just interrupt\nyou for a second okay\nso so because i don't want you to get\ntoo far because we're gonna i'm gonna\nbe a little bit more interruptive so if\nit bothers you please let me know okay\nso the first thing that you said is it\ncomes from my hard work so let's like\nlet's look at that kind of\nscientifically\nso you had worked pretty hard when you\nhit the academy team\nyeah you had worked pretty hard when you\ngot on the main team yeah\nand were you confident\nno okay i see where you're coming from\nright so\nso we're i know it sounds bizarre it's a\nvery\nvery um reasonable hypothesis\nthat confidence comes from hard work\nturns out\nnot really the case\nokay yeah okay oh i i i see that\nyeah so so hard work plays a role for\nsure but\nyou know it doesn't come from there so\nthen you said okay so you you have like\na very structured\nmind okay so i think that sort of makes\na little bit more\nsense to me structured mind is a really\nreally\ndifficult thing to really understand\nit's a very deep\nsystem of knowledge but here's the way\nthat i would walk through it\nso a structured mind like your mind\ntells you a b c d e and f\nis gonna happen right let's you organize\nyour thoughts you organize your day\nyou lay out your day and then you\nexecute on your tasks\nyeah and things work\nout the way that you expected them to\nis that the case when you have a\nstructured mind over a given day\nyeah generally speaking obviously there\ncan always be things that\nare unexpected things that show up but\nlike on a broad level i i\nyeah i i have an expectation or an idea\nof what\nwhat the day is going to bring yep and\nso i think that sort of makes more sense\nbecause if we kind of think about it a\nlittle bit\num you know literally what is confidence\nconfidence is the capacity to\nhave an expectation in your performance\nyeah right so if we like define it it's\nlike\nknowing what you're capable of and\nif you have a structured mind and you\nlay out six things for you to do\nand then you do those six things what is\nyour expectation of your performance the\nnext day\nright it sort of builds confidence\nbecause you said i'm gonna do this\nand then you actually do it yeah and so\nconfidence increases\nright so so i think a structured mind is\na big part of it\num but i think of\ni don't really think that's where\nconfidence comes from because what we're\ntalking about is like the negative voice\nin your head\nright and if we really think about it\nlike like where is that\nvoice let me ask you this when you\ntell yourself that you are a good person\nand that you do deserve to be there\nwhose voice is that\nwhose voice do you hear in those words\ninteresting question\ni feel like it's it's hard to say yep i\nwas thinking it could be\ni'm about to say all the\nmany of you know the close ones that\ni really care for that i feel like i'm\nkind of fighting for in a way that are\nputting a lot of trust in me then\nthat's really respect me for what i'm\ndoing\nmm-hmm but i'm not sure if that's\nif that's really it so even from your\nanswer which you're sort of confused\nthere's actually a very big answer\nso you've actually given us a fantastic\nanswer because you said it's an\ninteresting question\nso the first thing to understand is that\nbecause it's a hard and interesting\nquestion the answer is not\nit's my voice do you see that\nyeah no i i yeah i don't think it's\nlike i can't just sit here and say it's\nmy voice because right so so the fact\nthe fact that you can't say that is\nincredibly significant\nbecause what what you what we must\nconclude from that or what\ni mean we don't have to conclude but\nwhat i'd hypothesize what i'd pull away\nfrom that\nis that confidence actually i know this\nsounds [ __ ] weird doesn't come from\nyou\njust think about it because if it came\nfrom you you'd say it's my voice\nthat's me talking to myself\nbut you're like i don't know whose voice\nit is\nso could it be your voice sort of maybe\nyou don't know\nwhat you sound like well right obviously\nto an extent it's always it's always\nyour own voice talking right\nbut where does like where does that\nconfidence really come from and\nlike does it actually come from my voice\nor\nis it kind of inspired from something\nelse beautifully\nyeah so broxah i think that that this is\nwhere we got to trust your instincts\nbecause you're right\njust follow your instincts so i i think\nthat like even you when you kind of say\nthat like\nit's my voice there's a piece of it\nthat's me but it's inspired\nby something else right\nthat i think is like like feels in the\nsame vein of what my experiences have\nbeen\nin terms of exploring confidence so\nhere's the kind of really interesting\nthing is that\nyou know what i would say is that\nconfidence is doesn't come from\nyou it is taught to you\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i think that is fair to say i feel\nlike\ni feel like during my time as a\nprofessional league of legends player i\ni literally learned how to be confident\nthan myself because\nas i said initially\ni wasn't really confident i was i was\nnervous i i\ni wasn't sure if i was going to perform\nand i went on on stage into official\ngames kind of\nquestioning a lot of things and when i\nwas about to make a play in the game\ni had all these voices in my head\nyou know kind of fighting with each\nother about whether going in was a good\nidea or not\nlike you have second thoughts in a way\nright and\ni don't really i don't really have to\nhave that anymore that's something that\nchanged and that i i learned and picked\nup somewhere along the way\nyeah so i don't think that that is\nthe whole of the answer i think that's\nactually the second half because there's\nsomething important there too you say\nthat\nwhen i was a pro player there was a\nfight\nright in your own head between two\nvoices\nyeah so confidence and now you're saying\nokay now that fight has been resolved\nand the confidence has won right\nfor the most part generally speaking\nthere could always be exceptions\nbut if we really if we really tunnel\ndown brock so what that means is that\nthe confidence was always there\nit was fighting at one point but at that\npoint it was already formed\nyeah which means that you didn't become\nconfident\nyou didn't learn how to become confident\nsure confidence grew\nbut that voice was already there\nso this is where i think it's\ninteresting because most people think oh\ni\ni became confident you know through my\ntrial that's when confidence wins but\nit's not where it originates from\nand this is where people run into\nproblems because when people\nlook at you and they say oh like broxah\ndid it because\nhe like fought through that mental\ndifficulty and then like that is how he\nbecame confident\nbut the you're going into the game\nevenly matched\nright the reason that you struggle is\nbecause you're going into the game\nyou've got your draft of like confidence\nand then the enemy has their draft and\nthen you win\nthe problem that people run into is that\nwhen they look at you and they try to\nlearn from your case\nthey're not going in with the same draft\nthat you're going in with\nand then when they fail they blame\nthemselves because they say why can't i\ndo this\nso we still have to go back to like\nwhere that voice that was fighting\nwe'll we'll get into you know how you\nlearn to be confident because obviously\nyou\ngrew a lot negative self-talk and stuff\nlike that maybe that's more the sports\npsychology side we can talk about that\njourney\nbut i want to even dig further back so\nlike you know when you think about\nwhen you were five years old and playing\ngame boy\ndid you feel confident in yourself\ni think i think at one point i i felt\nvery\nvery confident that my ability is\nplaying pokemon in that game for yes i\nthought\ni was very very good at that game okay\nwhat about when you were playing wow\nat one point it was the same thing i\nthink\nusually with games\nit is this kind of started the same way\nwhere\nit's always a bit up and down right\nbecause um\nlike let's say in league of legends for\nexample you can be\nyou can be really confident being in\ngold elo or diamond if you're playing\nagainst lower to your players but\nthere's always a\nstep up and that's where you know you\nkind of start over with the entire\nconfidence thing again because someone\nsmashes you in the game and you you kind\nof have to repeat the cycle rate\nand i think with most games it kind of\nstarted\nwith me just going in a bit blind and\nnot feeling that confident because i\ndidn't really know what i was doing what\ni was doing i was just learning having a\nlot of question marks and then\neventually as i put more and more hours\ninto it as i put more\nhours into doing research and\nkind of having a better understanding of\nthe game\nand became better at it\nthat's when i started becoming a bit\nmore confident in myself\nyeah so i think that makes a lot of\nsense to me and i think there's one\nreally really important piece there\nwhich is oftentimes overlooked\nwhich is you said you go into it blind\nthat's where the money is so let me give\nyou two scenarios right like\nlet's say one thing someone says oh look\nyou have to\nyou know fight for your life in the next\n24 hours\nand then i go into it and then someone\nsays oh look you have to prepare for\nsomething\nover the next 24 hours and then you're\ngonna do something\nif i succeed in the blind one versus i\nsucceed in the prepared one\nwhich one leads to more confidence\nobviously the prepared one why\nbecause you have time to gather your\nthoughts and create a\nagain this is where the structure comes\nin play right because\nlike i would take the opportunity to you\nknow preparing\ncreate a structured plan of how i would\napproach the problem and\ngo about it that way and then once once\nit starts\ni have a good idea in my head of what\nwhat's about to happen what\nwhat i'm about to do like let's say with\nschool for example\nwith exams i would always be really\nconfident about the\nthe writing exams those that you you\njust sit for yourself you get a piece of\npaper and you can just look at all your\nnotes and\nyou know just write something but all\nthe oral exams where\ni walk in i have no idea what subject\ni'm gonna\ni'm gonna have in the exam like i go in\na bit blind in the sense not knowing\nwhat\nwhat i'm gonna gonna discuss i would get\nso nervous because\noh oh okay okay i\nokay so but let me ask you this let's\nsay you go into an\noral exam and you ace it how do you feel\nabout yourself afterward\ni it there's a limit to how many times\nit has happened but when it happened i\nfelt very\nrelieved and very very proud because\ni was put in a place where i was really\nout of my comfort zone and i still\nyou know came out with a really good\nresult i i made it work\nso if we think about how confidence is\nbuilt i completely agree with you that\nthe oral exam you're less confident when\nyou're going when you go in\nyeah but i would say that in terms of\ngrowing your confidence\nthe oral exam actually grows it more\nthan the written exam yeah\nat least for me because i always viewed\nthe oral exams as\nthe big challenge to overcome what i was\nafraid right\nright so so i think this is huge because\ni\ni think when you say i went into it\nblind the less prepared you are\nthe more confident you have the\npossibility of ending up\nyeah so so when i look at people who are\nhighly highly avoidant and lack\nconfidence\nwhat they try to do is prepare\nso that they never have to be tested\nright they prepare and prepare and\nprepare so they never truly get tested\nthey like set up all of these things in\ntheir favor so that success is\nguaranteed\nlike i'm not going to if if i say broxah\ni want to build my confidence as a legal\ni want to\nbuild i want to be a good league of\nlegends player so what i'm going to do\ni'm going to ask you\nand i'm going to ask all the other\nleague of legends pros that i've had on\nstream\nwe're going to queue up together and i'm\ngoing to stack the deck so that i win\nso they're going to do nothing for my\nconfidence it is my insecurity\nthat causes me to reach out to people\nlike you and says will you join my team\nwill you help me stack the deck\nwill you help me prepare for victory\nhere and the victory is completely empty\nyeah right because i got i got carried\nyeah and you you want to be the one\ncarrying\nright but no but no i don't because\ncaring's [ __ ] scary\nright so when you take a written exam\nyou can get carried by your notes\nand the oral exam is so much scarier\nbecause you're like i have none of these\nwhere's my [ __ ] who's carrying me no\none's carrying you bro\nand it's terrifying\nyeah right so actually so this is where\nwe're talking about building confidence\ngoing in blind like when you really\ntest yourself because then you know it's\nnot\ni'm not getting carried by pro it's not\nmy notes it's not all of this\nit's just me i did this\nright like like that's where confidence\ncomes from i can do this\ni don't need the notes i don't need to\nqueue up with brock's as my jungler to\nplay\na game of legal like to win a game of\nleague of legends\ni can do it and in your case just to\nkind of\ntoss another hypothesis you know i think\nthat confidence is taught\nright there's a lot of psychological\nresearch about this i can go into more\ndetail but\ni think that like it would when you kind\nof think about\neven the way that your parents let you\npick the day\nright like what your parents were so\nthat you they let you pick your day that\nyou're not allowed to play\nso even like when you were in fourth\ngrade your parents were saying\nbroxah a mass i trust you\ni have faith in you that you can pick\nthe day\nand i was surprised because when when\nyou know when most parents like\nwhen most parents think their kids are\nplaying too many video games they don't\nsay there's one day that you can't play\nthey say there's one day that you can\nplay\nyeah for sure right and so\nit's kind of interesting because i think\nthat you also mentioned like having\nsupport so i think that\nit's hard but this is a rough answer\nbut the short answer is that i think to\nconfidence is taught to people just\nbecause that's how our brains learn like\nwe learn very little from ourselves we\nlearn a lot from you know\nother people and i think part of the\nreason that you're mentally strong\nis sure you've worked hard sure you have\na structured mind but i think frankly\nlike you got some good rng when it comes\nto your family\nyou know yeah i i can confirm that\nright and and so i think it's important\nto acknowledge and not to say that you\ndon't deserve it or anything like that\nbut i think that\none of the things that really bothers me\nis that when people look at you and\nthey're like look at this\n23 year old chad league of legends\nplayer who's got a girlfriend and gets\nlaid from time to time\nwhat i want people to understand is that\nyou were dealt a particular hand in life\nwhich has nothing i'm not saying you\ndidn't\nwork hard or anything like that but to\nhold in your mind two things one is that\nyou had parents who taught you that you\nhave value\nright they were like mass i want you to\nbe happy\nlike if you lose a game of league of\nlegends you we\nyou still have value as a person\nyou're not just a summary of your\nresults\nyou're more than that and that's where\nconfidence comes from right like it's an\nintrinsic sense\nof value and the more that you value\nyourself the more you can face\nuncertainty because i think you've had\nlittle\nlittle um run-ins with uncertainty a lot\nso i think your parents divorce is a\ngood example of like\nyou were facing uncertainty right you\nwere going in blind it was like an oral\nexam\nyou didn't know what was gonna happen\nand when you get through that when you\ncross that\nyou know lake of fire and you wind up on\nthe other side\nyou're like okay i can handle this now\nand you've had your trials like when you\nyou know certainly when you started to\nbecome a pro it sounds like\nyou you know you had that voice and then\nyou had to fight\nso it's not like it was easy for you no\ndefinitely and\ni think in my time as a professional\nplayer one of the\nbiggest things that i had to learn to\ndeal with both as a player but\nespecially also as a personal level was\nto navigate through all that uncertainty\nand dealing with it even\nlet's say the first time i i went to\nwent to berlin to\nplay with the team i had no idea what\nwas going to happen i had never been in\nthis situation before i had never met\nany of these people\nand often times when when traveling i\nhave no idea\nwhen i'm coming home sometimes i don't\neven know when i'll be leaving until\na couple of days before i'm leaving and\nwhen playing tournaments it's kind of\nthe same like\nthe entire future in the tournament\ndepends sometimes on one single game\nthat you have to play and you have to\nset yourself\nup for up for that game and you need to\nbe ready to perform and in that sense\ni think that is one of the two things\nthat i've\nreally had to spend the most time kind\nof dealing with and learning along the\nway\nmove a bit out of the structure and my\ncomfort zone and\nfeel a bit more comfortable with all the\nuncertainties and navigating\nthrough them and still getting getting\nthe most out of myself\nyeah so that's a great way to put it i\nthink\nmoving outside of your comfort zone and\nbecoming comfortable with\nthe uncertainty right so like this is\nthis is tricky because this is what a\nlot of people who are not confident do\nthey try to remove the uncertainty\nyeah and if you remove the uncertainty\nyou may succeed you may work hard but\nyou won't become more confident\nyeah for sure and that's kind of uh\ni guess a mental not necessarily mental\ncycle but like a mental state of mind\nsomewhere with\nwhere i've been to at times where things\nhave been\nreally difficult with the job and at\ntimes i would be\nquestioning myself and questioning\nwhether i would be able to navigate\nthrough it and i've\ni've been thinking to myself like do i\ndo i actually want to do this am i ready\nfor this do i want to\ncontinue this way but that's where that\nconfidence comes in and tells me that\nas long as i just you know\nas long as i'm just me and as long as i\ni i do my best it's gonna work out one\nway or another and it's gonna be fine at\nthe end of the day and so let me\nlet me ask you a concrete question there\nyou say am i ready for this\nand what's the answer you tell yourself\nit's not always yes it's it's not always\na simple yes\nsometimes it's just a maybe or\ni think so but it's just that's where\nconfidence comes from\nis doing something when you're not ready\nfor it\nyeah right it's i think that's\nyeah that's a good answer to it it's\nbeautiful because i i think sometimes\nyou know you'll you'll give an\nanswer that sounds vague on the surface\nlike it's not always a yes\nbut that is a great answer it says a lot\nyeah because that's the important thing\nit's not always yes\nand and so i think brock's a really what\nyou should commend yourself for or give\nyourself a pat on the back i think you\nwere dealt a good hand i thought you'd\nthink you were given a nice\nstarting stat for confidence\nright it started off pretty high and\nand at the same time i think you really\nhave pushed yourself\ninto uncomfortable situations\nand you've done things that you haven't\nbeen ready for\nand that i think is what makes you\nstrong mentally\nright is that you're willing to face the\nuncertain and and\nif you guys i kind of cut you off but i\nthink you were on a kind of a good chain\nof thought if you guys listen to\nbrock's thought process it's sort of\nlike i may not win\nbut it's gonna be okay in the end like\nthat's a statement of confidence\nbecause some people are like if i don't\nwin it's over\ni i've been there before too many times\nand like honestly\noften times when i go into a game um\nwhether it's solo queer professional\ngame\nthat's that's oftentimes the default\nprocess that can appear right\nbut that's where you need to this is one\nof\nthe things that has been difficult for\nme as well as like going into a game and\nreally setting me up\nlike just thinking to myself that if i\ndon't carry this game if i don't look\nlike a god and if we don't win this\neverything is going to be doomed you\nknow like everything is going to be over\nbut i've kind of learned along the way\nto really\ntake everything one step at a time and\ni've never been the type of player to\ninside tournament and go out in\ninterviews and say that\nwe're gonna smash everyone and we're\ngonna win no matter what because that's\nnot really how i wanna\nthat's not how i set myself up for\nsuccess\num obviously that's that's always the\ngoal and that's always what i'm working\ntowards but\num if we if we're in a tournament then\nthe first thing i'm gonna tell myself is\nthat\nall right we need to reach playoffs or\nwe need to get to the group stage\nand i'm trying to figure out what i can\ndo in order to help\nmyself and my team get to that level and\nthen once we are\nplaying a qualifier and i'm like okay\nbut this is the team we're going up\nagainst this is the situation this is\nwhat needs to be done in order for us to\nreach the semi-final\nand just always really taking it one\nstep at a time\nbecause that way if something goes wrong\ninside the game which is very common\nlike sometimes you\nyou insert a game with a plan and two\nminutes in\neverything collapses and you know things\nfall apart and you need to\nyou need to be really good at um\nreacting\non the fly and figuring out how you're\ngoing to win the game with a different\nplan\nand especially as a jungler and league\nof legends that's so important like if\nsomething falls apart you\nyou have to do whatever you can to bring\nyour team back on track\nand like i i found that if i go into the\ngame thinking i have to win no matter\nwhat if something goes wrong\nlike i i just i just black out i get so\nfrustrated you know because\nthe first thing that comes to my mind is\nlike oh no it's lost we're not gonna win\nbut if i just think to myself that\nlike if i just try to come in prepared\nno matter what happens and take it one\nstep at a time\nthen anything can come my way or\nthat's how i feel right like no matter\nwhat comes my way i'm gonna be\nready to adapt and i'm gonna figure\nthings out on the fly and i'm gonna\nget us in the position to win win this\ngame or the very least do my very best\nto make us win this game\nand i i found that at least for me\nthat's\na really healthy way of thinking because\nit does\nput some pressure on me in a way but by\nno means to the same extent of just\nhaving to win no matter what\nwell said i i think that you've you've\nstumbled upon\nsomething which is a little bit\ndifferent but i think it's not having\nexpectations\nand devoting yourself to your action as\nopposed to the result\nand yeah and this is something that i i\ni mentioned to\nyou know people in in esports before\nwhich is like\num you know if you're let's say you're\nthe mid laner\nand you're going 2-0 you go 2-0 and\nyou're lane\nyeah let's say you're the mid-laner and\nyou go 0-2\nwhich one is more likely to make you\ntilt\ngoing too so i know you say that\nyou're a pro league of legends player so\nyou you have more experience than i do\nbizarrely in my experience\nwhat often times happens is when you go\nto an o you say i got this [ __ ]\ni've crushed this noob and then\nand then if you die once or you die\ntwice then suddenly you're two and two\nand then if you're o and two and then\nyou get two kills at the end of the day\nif you end up as two and two\nthe person who is two and o is more\nlikely to tilt\nbecause they create an expectation of a\nvictory but you're the actual league of\nlegends pro so if you disagree we're\ngoing to defer to your answer\nno i i had a feeling you were going to\nsay that\nand i i kind of see where you're coming\nfrom because\ni i think it mostly depends on the\nexpectations you set\nfor yourself and that's it the way that\nthe mind functions because some people\nare gonna have an easy time tilting if\nthey have a lead\nbecause they they feel pressure they\nfeel like now\nwhoa i have a lead i have to carry and\nthen because that\nbecause of that they start it's\nquestioning themselves and they do crazy\nthings and they throw that lead\nbut i think what often happens is that\nwhen when someone has a\nbad game from my personal experience\nthat's where\nthe mental path can really shine because\nbeing in a really tough position\nand just staying strong just accepting\nthat you've made a mistake and dealing\ndealing with the situation you are in\nand making it work is really difficult\nand what a lot of people tend to do\nmyself included sometimes start rather\nthan\nadmitting that you made certain mistakes\nand that you're the reason you're in\nthat position you start\nblaming other people and you the focus\nkind of\nlike the voice inside your head starts\nfocusing on random things that don't\nhelp you win the game at all\nand often that's where that's where the\nthe attitude problems and the mentality\nproblems come in because people are\nhaving a rough time and then rather than\ntaking\nfull responsibility for it and dealing\nwith the situation they start\nblaming other people and they're like\nyou know i died in my lane\nthe jungle was here and killed me it's\nyour fault why are you not here\nyeah that's something i understand very\nwell so i play more dota than league and\ni'm a jungler and dota\nand and often times my my team blames me\nfor junglic\nbut i try not to let that affect my\nattitude and i continue jungling every\ngame\nthat is the life of a jungler especially\nwhen you're at jungle in these type of\ngames you you have to deal with a lot\nand you have to learn to accept that\num sometimes i think of it as being a\nbeing a babysitter in a way you know\nthere's all these children\nin the lanes and if anything small goes\nwrong you know they start\nthey start screaming and crying and then\nyou have to figure out like\nhow to navigate through that and how to\ndeal with that i'm laughing roxy because\ni was trolling you a little bit\nthere's uh there's no role of jungler\nand donut\nit's it's like an offline though there's\nsomething similar\nthere's something similar but generally\nspeaking when you actually go jungler\nit's a terrible idea because it's like a\nbad strategy\nand oh really i thought i thought it was\nactually like\na viable strategy\nno okay so junglers are just\nlike you know there is offline like a\nlot of people will go into the jungle\nbut there isn't a dedicated role and\ngenerally speaking it's incredibly range\nof\nrage inducing when when there's a\njungler on your team\nbut so you know just speaking of of you\nknow expectations and letting down\nteammates i understand we were supposed\nto\num talk about toxicity and we really\nhaven't\ndone that i mean we've been at it for\nnow\nyou know a little over an hour and a\nhalf do you or right around an hour and\na half do you want to talk about\ntoxicity or\ndo you feel like this has been\nproductive or\ni mean is there something i can help\nhelp you with in terms of toxicity or\nanything you want to say\ni'm not sure i i feel like i feel like\nthis has been this has been productive i\nmean the entire conversation\num i mean i think i saw the start that i\nfelt like i had an idea of what was\ncoming\nand you said that maybe it wasn't the\ncase and i definitely didn't expect to\nsit and talk about all these things for\nfor this long um when it comes to the\ntoxicity there was one thing that that\ncame to my mind\nit was one of the things you said about\nhow\nmy parents were when i grew up and how\nthey\nput a lot of faith in me and i think\nwhen it comes to toxicity or bad\nattitudes or treating people a certain\nway\nwhen i grew up i was taught to be\nresponsible i guess and i think being\nresponsible for your actions being\nresponsible for the way that you treat\nother people is\nincredibly important and\nagain you know i'm not the best example\nof all time in that regard but i can\nconsider myself pretty pretty\nresponsible and\num when it comes to to treating other\npeople a certain way\ni'm also not perfect but i always try my\nbest to treat\ntreats i mean it sounds a bit dumb\nsaying it like this maybe but three\ndollars the way that i want to be\ntreated and treat them like you know\ngood humans human beings rather than\ngoing\ngoing off when something goes wrong and\nwhen it comes to people\nyou know flaming others and getting\nreally mad in video games\ni kind of understand like i'm a really\ncompetitive person too\ni can also get gets really mad when\nsomething goes wrong in my game and when\ni feel like someone is ruining my game\nbut there's still\na difference between getting really mad\nand actually typing really obnoxious and\nhateful messages\nto a person and i feel like when it\ncomes to\nthe hate that influencers\num are dealing with pro players dealing\nwith it's it's kind of the same that\nlike there's no i've never been able to\nunderstand\num why people send hateful messages to\nothers\nlike when when whenever when i was a kid\nand we were watching the danish national\nteam\nplay football like you know we would be\nyelling at the tv and\nthat stuff and we would be like oh this\nplayer is so bad why why did he let the\nteam down but\nwe would never consider you know\nreaching out to them about it it's kind\nof crazy\nyou couldn't right but now you can\nso yeah and i think sometimes when\npeople\nget caught up in those emotions and when\nsomething goes goes off they kind of\nforget about that entire\nresponsibility that they're carrying\nwell hold on a second brock so i'm gonna\npush back a little bit\nso i agree with your general so like\nlike your general point but when you say\nyou know i know that it's you seem like\na super stand-up guy you seem super\nresponsible\nbut at the same time i want to point\nsomething out because\none of the things i'm hearing from you\nand one of the things i've been curious\nabout\nis like i love to talk to the toxic\n[ __ ] on stream\ni've said this like over and over and\nover again where i want to find the most\nwe've like tried this with like incels\nand and like misogyny\nright so like like dudes who hate women\nand\ni don't know if it's just because of\nlike our audience or\npeople are more like mild when they come\non stream and they really are not like\nas fiery or offensive as they are i mean\nwe don't want them to violate tos but\nlike\nyou know we've had a couple of people\nwho sort of identify as incels and my\ntake after talking to them\nis that they tend to be like pretty\ndecent people\nand and that's just been my my own\nexperience with most people who come on\nstream i think like even when they're\nhated by the internet\nor um you know have been toxic towards\nother people like i\ni we just see the nice side of people\nso i'm kind of curious about that but\nwhen you say like you know when you used\nto watch football and you yell at the tv\nlike that's the same thing right\nit's just now we have twitter so you can\nactually like the dude\non on the tv can hear you\nfor sure and i feel like that's that's\nthat's kind of the problem and that's a\nbig change in\nsociety because i know um if you go\ngenerations back\nagain denmark football or soccer is the\nbiggest sport and\ni've seen people so many times you know\nyelling and getting mad over football\nplayers or something going wrong with a\nteam but you would never have that\nluxury of actually being able to reach\nout to them and for them to\nhear what you were what you were saying\nyeah and\nnow that is the case and that creates\nsome\nsometimes really uncomfortable\nsituations and\nabsolutely all parties that that's\nthat's kind of the problem so what do we\ndo about it broxah\ni'm not sure because it's it is a it's\nit's a tricky one one to deal with and\nit's a bit\nsaying that that everyone has to be\nresponsible and everyone has to to\nyou know push themselves to be better to\nmake a change that\nthat might help to in some cases and to\na certain extent but is it is it gonna\nmake it\nan actual difference i'm not sure the\nway\nthe way that i've always looked at it\nespecially now that i've grown my my\nbrand\nto a certain extent is that\nwhat i can do is to try to be\na professional and the way that i that\nthere's a lot of people out there who\nlook up to me\nfor whichever reasons whether it's as a\nperson or as a player\nand when i say something or when i do\nsomething\nmany of those people kind of idolize us\nin a way they want to\nact the same way they want to play the\nsame way and if i come across\nin a poor manner and a pathway\nespecially if i do it consistently\nall those people are going to start\ndoing the same things they're gonna\nstart\nbehaving that way whenever they play\nvideo games they're gonna behave that\nway whenever they go\non social media and\ntherefore even though i'm by no means\nperfect at it\ni i always try to go into\num streams or\nvideos whatever it might be with without\nthat mindset that\num i i want to be a good person\ni want to be a responsible person and i\nwant to make sure that\ni am not part of pushing\nthis particular thing that's actually\nbothering me and that's bothering us out\nof other people\nbecause i think it's a problem so i'm\ngonna\ni'm gonna speak up i'm gonna state that\nit's a problem and i'm gonna try to\nbe part of setting an example of you\nknow how you should treat other people\nhow you should behave\non the internet\nokay i think it's beautiful that you\nwant to do that\nand also i'm curious\nwhat about the people who don't do that\nyeah and that's uh that can be a bit of\na problem right because there's a lot\nthere's a lot of different type of\npeople out there\nand this goes for\nyou know there's a lot of different\nfamous people out there and all in all\naspects whether it's video game sports\nmovies whatever it may be and\nthe way that i see it is that anyone who\nhas a following\nhas a big responsibility for the reason\nthat\nreasons that i i just mentioned i think\nit's so important\nin the in this community the pro-gaming\ncommunity the league of legends\ncommunity whatever\nwhatever gaming community is that all\nthose people with a big voice with a big\nfollowing\nthey don't necessarily have to sugarcoat\neverything or be positive all the time\nor whatever it may be but it's so\nimportant that you\num you come across in the right way\nbecause you have\nlike some of these people have thousands\nand thousands of of\nour fans so brock's i'm gonna\npush back a little bit once again so i'm\nall for your positivity\nyou know we're we try to be positive\nhere but just to\nbecause i i genuinely want to work on\nthis so i want to challenge your ideas a\nlittle bit is that okay\nsure so the first thing is that in my\nexperience sometimes the people who\nwe perceive as toxic believe that\nthey're behaving\nin the same way that you're describing\nthey believe that they're behaving in a\nresponsible way right\nthey just think that like you know being\nhonest or not letting people get away\nwith their [ __ ] or things like that\nso i think that's something we have to\nacknowledge\ni don't think that there are people\nwalking around thinking you know they\nwake up in the morning and they look in\nthe mirror\nlike boy am i a toxic [ __ ] let me go\nmake some dude's life\nmiserable i think most people think that\nthey're behaving actually exactly the\nsame way that\nyou say you aren't i actually don't know\nanything about you know toxicity in\nleague so\nmaybe you're actually a toxic [ __ ]\nand i just am not aware of it\nright um so that's one thing and the\nsecond thing that i kind of toss out is\nthat\nso i get what you're saying i think each\nperson who has a platform has a\nresponsibility to try to be a model\nfor behavior right that's what you're\nsaying\nyeah i think that's that's one of the\nthings i thought about that\nthat's important yeah so i agree with\nyou i think the challenge is\na couple of things one is that some\npeople who may be perceived by others as\ntoxic\ndo believe that they are being a model\nyeah right so that's a challenge that we\nhave to somehow overcome\nand so this is where like sometimes i\nwonder a little bit about like actually\nconflict resolution directly\nso this is where where you know you're\nsaying that everyone should hold\nthemselves to a higher standard what i'm\ncurious about is\nis there a healthy way if there's\ntoxicity between two people\nis there a healthy way to actually\nresolve that that toxicity\ninstead of i'm gonna be a responsible\ndude over here and you're gonna be a\nresponsible dude over there\nand like\nyou know because i think we have to\nengage people this is my hypothesis now\nso i'm not really challenging what\nyou're saying\nit's it's actually if i really think\nabout what i'm asking for is\nyour approval or your criticism\nbased on what i'm thinking to help me\nthink through this\nbecause when i think about conflict\nresolution in real life it's not like\nwhen i have an argument with my wife i\ndon't just hold myself to a model of\nhigh behavior and he\nshe holds herself to an a model of high\nbehavior that's why we [ __ ] argue in\nthe first place is because\ni think i'm holding myself to a good\nstandard she thinks she's holding\nherself to a good standard we just\ndisagree\nright so so what i'm kind of curious\nabout is like now that\nyou can you know in the past we used to\nyell at footballers on the tv\nnow we can dm them and and so\ni'm just i just don't i think relying on\npeople to be models of good behavior\nbasically this is what i'm saying\ndoesn't seem to be working\nno it's uh it it doesn't\nit works to a certain extent but not not\nto\nto the maximum and and so just curious\nif if you think there's some\ni know conflict resolution may not be i\ndon't know if people know what that\nmeans practically but like\nthat i basically believe that we need to\nengage\npeople in like a more active way if we\nwant to do something about toxicity\nthat's my hypothesis\nyeah but how exactly would you do that i\ndon't know\nso so i i will say this\num there's a particular\nesport that that i actually run a group\nfor pro players that um and we kind of\nwork through toxicity issues\non a weekly basis and we kind of show up\nand we talk and i think it's been really\ninteresting to see how things have\nchanged because\nbeing able directly like like fighting\nover twitter\nit's really easy to get mad at someone\nbut like when you get people in a room\ntogether it's like\nharder to call each other [ __ ] and\nsometimes they do call each other\n[ __ ]\nand and even if they do call each other\n[ __ ] then we kind of like work\nthrough it\nyeah and i think a lot of a lot of\npeople who\nwho don't don't behave that well on the\ninternet a lot of them aren't\n[ __ ] a lot of them are good people\nbut there's certain reasons or\nthat they might have a bad day there\nmight be something recently that has\nhappened that's making them frustrated\nand they just went out on the internet\nor\nsomething that happened when they were\ngrowing up there's a lot of reasons\nas to why people behave a certain way\nright and i totally get where you're\ncoming from that\nsomeone can behave one way on the\ninternet and then when you meet them in\nperson it's like\nmeeting a completely different person\nand that can be the case both you know\nit can be this way where it's a positive\nexperience but it can also go the other\nway\nabsolutely yeah so i mean after\nlistening to you you know here uh i\ndon't know if\nwhat is more exciting to me but i have\ntwo or three random ideas one is that\ni think it would be cool if i don't know\nif this is like actually okay with\ntos for twitch but i think it would be a\nlot of fun so my\nyounger daughter the three-year-old\nactually likes dota\nand and she likes um she likes playing\nonce again the monstrous creatures so\nshe's not interested\nin in you know the the female wizards\nand things like that she likes to play\nthis hero called tide hunter who's like\na sea monster\nso she said she wants to play the sea\nmonster and and so she likes to play\nthis year i think it'd be like i think\nit's like really cool i'd love to\ndo like a stream with like you and your\nbrother and and me and my\ndaughter and have like a kids and anyway\ni don't know if that's okay because it\nhas children on twitch so maybe that's\nlike against tos but\ni think it would be cool um because i i\ndo really enjoy\nso i my mind is kind of going there uh\nthe second thing is i don't know if it\nwould\nyou know my wife would be okay with it\nor even i would be okay with it with\nhaving my kid on stream but\num that may not be you know because as\nwe're talking about the internet is a\ntoxic place\nuh the other thing that i'm wondering\nabout is whether we need like some kind\nof couples counseling\nfor people on the internet um and\nand just you know because i i think like\npeople\ni don't know that's just thoughts but\nyeah you think i'm not i'm not sure like\ni think as you're saying finding\ndifferent ways to\nengage people so i'm just chad is\ntelling me that\nno no no nobody below 13 so that's\nabandonable\nmakes sense okay so that's probably the\nidea of the window\nyeah apparently so as you're saying like\ni also think it's important to try to\nwell come up with ways to engage people\nbecause\num in inside these games\non social media you can always you can\nalways tighten up the rules and you can\nmake really strict rules but\nit's not going to help i mean only to a\ncertain extent right i think it goes a\nbit back to what you were saying earlier\nbut\nrather than dealing with with the\nproblem in a good way you're just kind\nof like you're not really dealing with\nit you're just shutting it down a little\nbit but the problem is still going to\nexist and it's just going to come back\nlater yeah yeah i think finding that way\nto\nengage people and and make this changes\nwould be a big step but it's it's a\ntricky one that no one has\nquite figured out yet yeah but that's\nwhat we're here for\nroxanna oh right so sure so we're we're\nstepping into uncertainty now\nand we don't know if we can figure it\nout but i i'd love it if you just\nyou know think on it sleep on it and if\nyou have any thoughts about what we can\ndo please let me know\num or what we can do if there's any way\ni can help you with any answers that you\ncome\nup with please let me know um\nbut yeah so last sort of thing that we\ntend to do\nany questions by the way\nno not really um so the last thing is\nsome people\nwant to learn how to meditate i don't\nknow if you do meditate or if you're\ninterested in learning but i'm happy to\nteach you if you\nare curious about it i've done a bit of\nmindfulness before if that counts\nsure it's mindfulness but it's not\nmeditation\nyeah yeah i think it certainly counts in\nthe same bucket\nyeah to a certain extent it counts but\ni've never done\ni guess you could say actual meditation\nso i'm down for the experience\nokay do you want to do something a\nlittle bit more\nokay so if we're gonna do something a\nlittle bit away from mindfulness\num i'm gonna teach you maybe a more\nintensive meditation\ntechnique that i think also relates to\nconfidence\nokay okay yeah so i'm gonna teach you\nsomething called um it's been a while\nsince we've taught this on stream but\nyou seem to be a pretty resilient guy so\nwe'll we'll kind of go there and and for\npeople\nbecause we talked a lot about confidence\nas opposed to toxicity\nso a lot of people you know if we think\nabout confidence confidence is this\nintrinsic\ncan i just think for a second of course\nokay so i'm going to try to summarize\nand then i'll teach you a meditation\ntechnique okay\nokay so\na lot of people ask us how do i\nbecome confident right like how do i\nlike gain confidence how do i build\nconfidence so i think\nas we learned about from talking to you\nbroxah the first thing to understand\nis that people when when they say how do\ni become\nconfident they're missing something\nbecause confidence is not something that\nyou intrinsically do\nit's not something you can build all by\nyourself\nthat's the first misnomer so we think\nabout where your confidence comes from\nit's actually\ntaught so originally for young children\nand even like you know older children or\nteenagers\nconfidence is something that is taught\nto you and what i mean by that is that\nyour parents or other people that are\nclose to you in life will like speak to\nyou in a certain way\nand that thing becomes the voice in your\nhead\nand then what happens is you know in in\nmoments where you have crisis\nof confidence what happens is you have a\nwar in your head\nand there are two voices right one is\nsaying you can do it\nand the other one's saying you can't do\nit\nand so already if if you have that\nconflict the first thing to understand\nis that when you're really young\nthe part of you that says you can do it\nis not something that you can build on\nyour own\nit's something that you're given and so\nsome people are kind of given the short\nstraw\nand some people are given like a good\nhand i mean\na bad hand of cards or a good hand of\ncards\ngood rng or bad rng and so\nthat's the first thing okay so then the\nnext thing is then you have a little war\nand the more that you\nface things uncertainly the more that\nyou face things that you're not sure are\ngoing to work out well\nthe more you go into things blind the\nmore your confidence is going to grow\nand this is another tricky thing that\npeople fall into is that when they lack\nconfidence\nwhat they try to do is adjust the\nrules of the game so that they don't\nhave to take a chance\nright so what i'm gonna do is like if\ni'm not confident that i'm going to pass\nthe test what i'm going to do is cheat\nand even though i can get the result\nit's not going to build my confidence at\nall\nso people are willing to sacrifice\nconfidence to gain a victory\nso we also see this sometimes in like\ndudes who get friend zoned\nwhere they're afraid like let's say i\nwant to ask a girl out\nand if we if you ever come back on\nstream we've got to talk about your\ngirlfriend\num but you know let's say you want to\nask a girl out and you're afraid she's\ngonna say no\nand so then what they end up doing is\nlike they'll do things like they'll get\nher gifts and stuff\nand what they want to do is they want\nher to like like them more so that they\ncan remove the uncertainty of the\nequation\nand then when they ask her out she's\ngoing to like me so much she's going to\nsee how awesome of a dude i am\ni care about her so much she's going to\nnotice that she'll notice it eventually\ni'll get her flowers for valentine's day\nbut i won't tell her that i'm interested\nand so then they like invest a lot to\nremove uncertainty from the equation\nyeah right and then anyway it usually\ndoesn't end up going well\nbut at the end of the day though like\nthat's tricky because the things that we\ndo like we're not willing to face things\nwe're not willing to face uncertainty\nso and when we do face uncertainty and\nwe come out on top or even if we fail\nwe actually end up more confident at the\nend of it as long as you're willing to\nface uncertainty\nas long as you're willing to go into\nsomething blind\nand when you survive at the end you\nmentioned to us earlier that\nyou know you even if you lose you know\neverything's gonna be okay\nand if you really think about that how\ndid you learn that\nlike that's a really important lesson\nbut the way you learned that\nis by going into something failing and\nthen like\nwaking up the next day and being like oh\ni'm still okay right\nand and so this is where early on you\nsaid kind of confidence comes from\nmaybe the hard work that you put in or\nsome people think that confidence comes\nfrom success\nbut actually if we really think about it\nwhen you talk about your thoughts of\nconfidence\nthey don't necessarily come from your\nsuccess they actually come from your\nfailure\nwhat they really come from is stepping\ninto something not knowing whether you\ncan handle it or not\nthat's how you grow it but it sort of\nstarts with\nyou know there's a part that's given to\nyou and there's a part that you grow\nand that's how you become confident in\nshort so\nthe next question is let's say people\nhave bad\nrng and they're not like you and they\ngrew up in a situation\nwhere they don't have intrinsic\nconfidence their self-talk is not\npositive their self-talk is negative\nwhich is something you've experienced\nright\nso how do we start if you were given a\nbad hand and so what i'm going to teach\nyou is a meditation technique\nthat will neutralize your self-talk and\nwill start to give you\na sense of who you are as a person\nthat is free from what other people\nthink of you\nokay so what that sort of means is that\nif you're not confident i hope that\nyou'll get a sense of like\nyour core being if you are confident\nhopefully it'll still feel good\nokay so there's gonna be kind of a weird\ntechnique\nso this this technique is um is\ncalled b's breath and also it's two\ntechniques\nit's b's breath like the breath of a bee\nand then the second technique is the\nclosing of the nine\ngates okay i know it's weird\nit's gonna be weird it's gonna be even\nweirder when you do it but the goal is\nthat you're gonna do this technique\nand it's gonna be quite enveloping\nfor your consciousness\nand then after you do this technique for\na while what it's hopefully is going to\ndo\nis going to knock out your thoughts\nknock out your self-talk completely and\nyou're going to be\nleft with a state of self that is like\nsuper super neutral\nbut the more you sit with that neutral\nstate the more\nyour negative self-talk will melt away\nand the more you'll be able to go to\nthat neutral state\nif you start to tilt if you start to\nlose confidence you can go ahead and\nyawn just yawn bro\nit's totally fine um it's just\nyou know i'm lecturing so it's\ncompletely fair oh it's not that it's\nboring it's just\nthere's been so much to digest you know\ni i understand that's why i'm not i\ndon't take it offensively and people\nthink it's offensive if you\nbut i yawn i lecture all the time and\npeople are yawning all the time and i\nknow it's not my fault just like i know\nthat in dota when i jungle and my team\nloses it's not my fault it's just what\nhappens right\nanyway okay so you ready for the\ntechnique\nyes okay so this is gonna be kind of\nweird because you're gonna have to take\noff your headset to do it\nokay but this is gonna be complicated\ni'm gonna show you first i'm gonna show\nyou\nthe closing of the nine gates okay\nso i'm gonna take my hands\nhold on let me think about this okay\nso i'm going to take my hands this is\ngoing to be hard so oh [ __ ] how can i\nshoot\nokay these are my hands right so my\npinkies are going to go here\nmy middle uh ring finger is going to go\nhere right outside my nose\nand this is going to be kind of weird\nthese two fingers are going to go on\neither sides of my eyes like this okay\nokay and then my thumbs are gonna go in\nmy ears\nlike that so what i'm gonna do is sort\nof block\noff all of the ways that my mind goes\nout into the external world\nokay so the nine gates that we're\nclosing if we think about the way that\nwe relate to the outside world we do\nthrough\ndo we connect to the outside world\nthrough our sense organs\nokay and the outside world doesn't\nreally know who we are\nso what we're gonna try to do is\ndisconnect from the outside world and\njust be inside\nokay okay so if you need an easy version\nall you really need to do is close your\neyes and do this\nthis works too it's not as powerful but\nit works okay\nbut if you have trouble doing huh that\ncan be planned\nyeah that's gonna be plan b and then\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna buzz\nlike a b\nokay so i'm gonna show you the technique\n[Music]\nyou got me did that clip out\nwell i i heard the style yeah that's\ngreat so you're not a buzz right so why\ndon't you take off your headset\nand adopt the thing and i'm i'm not\ngoing to be able to tell you because you\nwon't be able to hear\nbut how do you feel about trying this is\ntoo [ __ ]\nit's going to be interesting but yeah i\ni think i think\ni have an idea so how long do i have to\ndo it for like\nwe're gonna do one breath and then we're\ngonna check in again okay\nokay\nokay so oh you can't hear me\nso look oh there we go\nfigured it out yep good he can't hear me\nand then it\ninside the ear and then\nwe can't really hear him they can't\nhear us\nokay what was that like\ni don't know okay so\ngreat so we're going to give you one or\ntwo pointers\nso the first time you do it it just\nfeels weird\nyeah it felt a bit awkward and i was\nkind of the\nthe first stage was questioning what i\nwas doing right so so\nwhat we want to do is power through that\nquestioning\nso the first time you do it you're just\ngoing to feel so uncomfortable that\nyou're not even focusing on the practice\nokay so i'm going to give you two\npointers one is that\nthe you don't want to press on your eyes\nfor sure okay\nyeah so if you want to you can do this\nif this is easier like\nsomething like this is fine you want\nyour thumbs to be\ninside your ear canal okay\nokay and now what i want you to do is at\nyour own pace\ndo five breaths so take a big long\nbreath\nokay and then you're gonna feel weird\ndoing it\nand then the second breath is gonna be\neasier\nthe third breath you're gonna get into\nit the fourth breath hopefully is\nrelatively peaceful\nand the fifth breath you may feel a\nlittle bit light-headed which is fine\nso you can go at your own pace if you\nstart to feel like lightheaded\nyou can go ahead and take a breath in\nbetween like you can just you know take\na few breaths in between the rounds okay\nand you're gonna feel super anxious and\nweird at the beginning and then the\nwhole point of the practice\nis that as you breathe the anxiety and\nthe feeling weird is going to go down\nand you're going to be centered like\nkind of in yourself\nokay and then after the last round i\nwant you to just keep your eyes closed\nand just\nsit with yourself okay okay\nlet's do it together okay okay\nbut you're gonna have to do it at your\nown pace you're gonna have to do it at\nyour own pace because we're not gonna be\nable to hear each other\nokay okay chat you guys do it too\nokay\num\n[Music]\num\nhmm\n[Music]\num\n[Music]\none\nhow you doing\ni do feel a bit hills yeah it can lead\nto that\nwhat did you what was your experience of\nit\ni can i can see\nwhere what you said about coming to like\na neutral state come from\nbecause it was just like\nfocusing on the breath focusing on the\non the b sound really\nyeah and just not thinking about\nanything else for like\na little a little moment right and then\neven afterwards\num you know normally the mind wanders\nand you think about a billion things but\neven\nright after closing my eyes i mean i was\ni was thinking\nat a certain point like how long am i\nsupposed to have my eyes closed right or\nwhat i want to that point there's like\ni wasn't really thinking about anything\njust focusing on the breath\nright so as you practice this and if you\ndon't do it on stream and you can do it\nyou know on your own\nyou'll it's gonna be way easier but\nthe the whole point so i guess this\nisn't really a technique to build\nconfidence what this is is a technique\nto wipe away\nlack of confidence yeah\nright so when you're having that\nnegative self-talk when your mind is\nfull of that negativity\nit's a way to flatline it\nand what i would encourage you to do if\nif it fit for you great do it if it\ndidn't fit for you no big deal\num but i'd say if you continue to do it\nyou know\nsit quietly for like two minutes three\nminutes four minutes five minutes with\nyour eyes closed afterward\nand then gradually as your brain\nacclimatizes to the\nyou know different level of co2 and\noxygen\nyou can go up to nine breaths so nine\nrounds and then really just sit\nand it'll kind of like balance you out\nokay yeah cool okay\nwell thanks a lot for coming on man yeah\ni mean thanks for for having me this has\nbeen\nthis has been exciting something very\nvery different for me and i\nenjoyed it yeah man so good luck with\nyour you know the next season of\nof when do you guys start or you guys\nalready started\nwell um so speaking of uncertainties\nthe season begins the 15th of january\nbut i'm\nkind of waiting waiting around now\nfinding out when my visa\nis it's really yeah i'm in that market\nthis season begins in la in nine days so\noh my god that's a bit of an uncertainty\nright there to deal with\nas a pro player waiting to see when when\ni will be able to travel\nall right well good luck with that man\nyeah\nthanks take care yeah you too man\nwow chat talk about uncertainty okay\nray dragon let's trade dragon who's\ndragon"
