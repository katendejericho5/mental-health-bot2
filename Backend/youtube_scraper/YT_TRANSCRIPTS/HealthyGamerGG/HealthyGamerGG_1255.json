    "transcript": "okay guys so it's close to the new year\na lot of people want to lose weight and\nwe here at healthy gamer are\nhere to help you do that so i'm dr k um\none of the co-founders of healthy gamer\nand today i want to talk to you guys\nabout some of the scams of the weight\nloss industry\nand frankly why it's hard to lose weight\nand at healthy gamer you know our main\ngoal is to teach people how stuff works\nright\nso my hope is that by explaining a\nlittle bit about how weight loss works\nsome of the science behind it and also a\nlittle bit about how the weight loss\nindustry works we can empower you guys\nto actually achieve some of your goals\nand live sort of a healthier happier\nlife okay\nso we're gonna jump in with talking a\nlittle bit about the diet industry\nso i want you guys to just think about\nthis for a second so the diet industry\nhas been growing the wellness industry\nis growing\nthey're now multi-billion dollar\nindustries we have\na lot of advances in medical science you\nknow a lot of people are studying\num weight loss and obesity and all these\nkinds of things\nwe have all these qualified\nprofessionals like nutritionists\nendocrinologists medical doctors\npersonal trainers\nthere's so many people out there that\nare their job is to\nhelp you lose weight and we have a whole\nindustry that's spending billions of\ndollars on helping you lose weight\nand what's happening across the world\npeople are getting fatter\nright so obesity is actually on the rise\nand it blows my mind that this is\nactually happening right now\nthat despite all of the advances in\nmedical science despite\nthis gigantic industry people overall\nare still getting more and more obese\nand more and more unhealthy\nand so the question is like why is that\nright so\nwhat's going on here and can we\nunderstand a little bit about the\nscience of weight loss\nwhich may explain why actually going on\ncrash diets\ndoesn't actually help you lose weight it\nactually potentially makes it harder for\nyou to lose weight and we'll dig into\nthe science behind that\nso let's start by talking a little bit\nabout crash diets right so you guys may\nhave heard of\nthings like you know 20 30 years ago it\nwas the south beach diet\nthen people were doing this thing when i\nwas in college called the master cleanse\nwhich is when you drink like a bunch of\nlike lemonade with cayenne pepper in it\nfor like five days\nand nowadays everyone's like low carb\npaleo like\neveryone's got these kind of new diets\natkins diet whatever\nand the the goal of these diets is to\nkind of help you lose weight in sort of\na drastic\nmanner and we see this a lot where\npeople like oh i need to get in shape\nfor the summer i need to get in shape\nfor a wedding so like i want to lose 10\npounds\nin 15 days and i heard about this person\nthat did it they posted it all over\ntheir social media and instagram\nso that's what i'm gonna do too and so\nthe diet industry loves to sell you\nthese kinds of\nof weight loss programs right they say\nstick with this diet and you'll lose\nthis amount of weight in this amount of\ntime\nbut the reason that all of the the diet\nindustry exists is because\nnone of those really work and what do i\nmean by that i mean if we just think\nabout that for a second\nif these solutions actually worked then\nthe industry wouldn't be there right\neveryone would be in shape\nand so if the industry is actually\ngrowing and growing and growing\nit doesn't mean that their their methods\nare effective it actually means the\nexact opposite\nthat their methods i know this sounds\nreally bizarre but the more that people\ninvest in the diet industry the more\nobese we're getting\nso is there actually a scientific reason\nbehind that and i know it sounds\nabsolutely crazy\nbut there actually is and there's\nactually really strong data\nthat going on crash diets actually\ncauses you to get\nfatter and the main scientific theory\nthat's behind this is something called\nset\npoint theory and what setpoint theory\nbasically says is that your body has an\nideal weight that it homeostatically\ntries to maintain\nso your your body actually has an ideal\nweight that it is going to try to\nmaintain and if you try to lose weight\nit'll actually fight against you and if\nyou go over your\nset weight it'll actually start to lose\nweight and i know it sounds really weird\nbut let's just think about this for a\nsecond so let's say you and your friend\nmay not be the same weight\neven though you guys eat roughly the\nsame stuff right most human beings eat\naround 2000 calories a day\nand it's not like people who weigh 300\npounds\neat twice as many calories as people who\nweigh 150 pounds\nand so if we look at a population that's\nroughly eating the same amount of\ncalories\nhow do we explain some people being way\nheavier in some people being way lighter\nwell it turns out that set point theory\nperfectly explains that\neach of these people all of us have this\ninternal calculator\nthat tells us how much we should weigh\nand so that's the idea behind set point\ntheory so the first study that i want to\ntalk to you guys a little bit about is\nfrom the journal of nutrition\nand it basically explains the concept of\nof\nset points which is sort of this\nintrinsic biological capacity to stay at\na particular\nweight so let's try to look at what\nhappens when people actually go on a\ncrash diet\nso when we lose a lot of weight our\ninternal body is like oh my god we're\nlosing a bunch of weight we better\ncompensate for all this weight loss\nbecause otherwise we're going to end up\nin starvation\nand so one of the things that it does is\nit changes something called your basic\nmetabolic rate\nit changes the way that you expend\nenergy and it tries to conserve that\nenergy\nso basically in a gaming analogy what\nthis means is that like we're losing a\nbunch of weight and then our body is\nsaying oh my god weight loss is op\nso let's nerf weight loss and let's\nchange the way that our body\nholds on to energy and i know this\nsounds absolutely crazy but that's\nexactly what happens\nso there's a great study from the new\nengland journal of medicine which is one\nof the most prestigious and\nwell-respected journals in the world\nthat basically talks a little bit about\nhow when you lose weight\nyour body compensates by slowing down\nits metabolism\nand so basically what it says is that\nthis weight loss is too drastic\nlet's conserve our calories let's hold\non to weight as much as possible\nand the other thing that's really really\nscary about this is that\nthere's another study in the american\njournal of nutrition that suggests that\nthis compensatory mechanism that causes\nyour\nbody to hold on to calories when you go\nthrough a drastic period of weight loss\nactually lasts even if you gain the\nweight back\nso what that means is that if you go\nthrough a drastic period of weight loss\nyour body thinks you're starving and it\nstarts to actually make changes to your\nmetabolism\nto cause you to hold on to calories in a\nmore desperate way\nit tries to compensate and even if you\nstart to gain weight again\nthose changes to your body those periods\nof starvation will actually remain\nand you'll actually start to be\npotentially even go above your set point\nand set a new set point that is actually\nhigher than your old weight and so what\nthis really means\nit sounds absolutely crazy is that\nif you do drastic weight loss your body\nwill try to\nkeep you conserving more calories and\nyou could actually wind up\nat a higher weight than you used to and\nthat's actually what setpoint theory\ntells us\nso let's think about that for just a\nsecond so why does our body do that and\nit turns out that it's actually\nevolutionary\nso if we go through a period of\nstarvation you know\nthe organisms that were able to be more\ncalorie efficient\nafter those periods of starvation were\nthe ones that were more likely\nto survive future periods of starvation\nso our body basically learns from this\nperiod of\nof enforced starvation and says we\nbetter hold on to weight as quickly as\npossible or as\nseverely as possible and so the problem\nwith this is that if we kind of switch\nback to the diet industry for a second\nyou know the diet industry is really\ninteresting because what it does is\nit helps us lose weight for a brief\nperiod of time\nand then what inevitably happens is we\ngain all the weight back\nright and then something very very\nimportant happens is that we don't blame\nour physiology or the diet industry for\nthat what we do is we say oh my god i\nlack discipline i'm lazy\ni lost the weight and i just needed to\nstick with the diet if only i had stuck\nwith the diet then i would have kept the\nweight off\nwhereas in reality what's going on is\nsure you may have deviated from the diet\nbecause they're not really sustainable\nbut then we we kind of walk out of that\nscenario thinking that the diet\nworked but we didn't and that's not\nreally what's going on actually what's\ngoing on is that the crash diet that you\nwent on\nis actually changing your metabolism to\ngain weight afterwards so it's kind of\nlike it's a huge scam\nand a huge point of misunderstanding um\nand so another thing just about a set\npoint theory like so a lot of people\nwhen they diet\nthey diet with the idea that okay so i'm\neating 2 000 calories a day right now\ni'm not gaining weight i'm not losing\nweight\nso if i go on a crash diet and i lose 15\npounds\nand i go back to a like my regular diet\ni'll stay at that new lower weight i\nwon't gain weight i won't lose weight\nbut that doesn't really work because\nexactly what happens is setpoint theory\nsort of kicks in and says oh my god\nwe've lost too much weight so\neven if you eat the same amount that\nyou're eating right now you'll actually\ngain weight and may even end up at a\nhigher weight than you started at which\nis what's really scary\nso you can go on a crash diet nowadays\nthey're kind of like you these no carb\ndiets um you can even kind of like do\nall this kind of stuff and you can sort\nof end up with the idea that\ndiscipline is the problem oh you should\nhave stuck with it but the real truth is\nthat if you go on these crash diets and\nif you do this this really drastic stuff\nthen kind of no matter what happens\nyou're going to sort of gain your weight\nback\nso what ends up happening is that you\nstart to view yourself as a failure\nrather than the diet as a failure\nand when you gain it back it becomes\nthis abusive cycle of like losing weight\nand gaining\nweight and each time you know you think\noh the diet worked but i didn't work so\nthen you go back to the diet\nindustry you buy more books you go on\nanother crash diet\nas you go on your second crash diet your\nset point actually increases further\nand as you start to introduce even a\nhealthy normal diet\nyou notice that the weight actually goes\nback to where you used to be\nwhich is what most people's experience\nwith the diet industry is\nso then we kind of get to the quite the\nmain question which is okay what do we\ndo about it right so how do we lose\nweight\nif crash diets don't work if the diet\nindustry doesn't work\nhow is it possible to actually lose\nweight and it turns out there are a\nbunch of solutions and this is\nkind of what we're going to get into\nthere are a lot of things that you can\ndo once you understand what your\nphysiology is to actually\nlead to sustained weight loss right so\nwe don't want to institute something\nwhere\nour body says oh my god this weight loss\nis too op\nnerf this this is op like let's correct\nit\nwhat we want to do is sustained weight\nloss solutions\nthrough sustained action and\nthey're actually really good ways to do\nthat really good ways to understand your\nphysiology that lead to\nconstant and relatively easily\nsustainable changes to your weight\nso don't crash diet because it's\nactually going to make it harder to lose\nweight and there's a great\nthere's a great paper from american\npsychologists that sort of\ndigs into why like losing weight will\nactually cause you to binge more\nso here are just a couple of things that\nyou can do so the first thing to\nunderstand is that sustained weight loss\nis gained through sustained action\nyou need to change your diet on a daily\nbasis it can't be a temporary thing\nthe good news is that you may not even\nneed to change it much there are small\nsustainable things that you can do\nthat will actually change your weight in\na relatively\nefficient way there are all kinds of\ninteresting solutions that we can do\nbased on our understanding of science\nand a good example of this\nis flax seeds so flax seeds actually\nincrease our leptin sensitivity and so\npeople may ask okay what is leptin\nso in our body we have two hormones\nleptin and ghrelin\nleptin is the hormone that tells us hey\nwe're feeling full\nand ghrelin is the hormone that says hey\nwe're hungry we need to eat more\nso what we find in people who are\noverweight is that they are actually\nresistant to leptin and so what that\nmeans is that there's a hormone\nthat is telling you hey we've had enough\nfood\nbut you are resistant to that signal so\nyou're not really receiving that message\nand flax seeds have actually been shown\nto increase leptin sensitivity\nso what that means is that if you're\neating a particular meal and you add\nlet's say like a teaspoon of flax seeds\non top literally that\nmeal's capacity to make you feel full\ngoes up with that teaspoon of flax seeds\nso a lot of simple things that you can\ndo\nthat will sort of play with that\nhormonal balance and allow you to\nactually\nfeel more full and your body will start\nto tell you hey we actually don't need\nto eat as much because\nyou know your leptin is actually\nfunctioning as normal\nother things that we can do are actually\nincreased sun exposure\nthere's actually a great uh paper that\nsort of explores this is a\nfrom the medical journal medical\nhypotheses\num that explores how obesity and vitamin\nd\ndeficiency are actually linked and\nthere's some good evidence behind this\nbut some of it is also theoretical\nbut literally this can be as simple as\nexposing yourself to sunlight\nand so sun exposure may actually help\nlead to weight loss through correcting\nvitamin d mechanisms\nand if that sounds really biz bizarre\njust think for a second about you know\nhow your body functions\nand there's a really simple um sort of\ncausation\nbetween sunlight exposure and weight\ngain and it's simply that people in\nnorthern climates\nare less exposed to sunlight people in\nnorthern climates tend to have heavier\nwinters\nand in the winter time you have less\naccess to food so evolutionarily what\nour body does is says\noh if there's not a whole lot of\nsunlight we need to store calories\nso you can do something as simple as\njust getting some sunlight\nwhich actually produces vitamin d and is\nmore likely to make you lose weight\nso these are just a couple of the\nsolutions that we're introducing you\nguys\nwith today um and there are actually a\nlot of other solutions that will empower\nyou to get control of your weight\nand sort of lead to a sustained weight\nloss and so we don't want\ni really don't want you all to blame\nyourself for your weight loss just\nunderstand how your physiology works and\nthen start to institute changes\nthat will lead to sort of a sustained\nand healthy weight and that's really\nwhat we're here about\nso i hope that was helpful thanks a lot\nand good luck in the new year from dr k\nand healthy gamer\nyou"
