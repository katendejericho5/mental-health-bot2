    "transcript": "let's talk a little bit about motivation\nokay so\nmotivational styles okay so the first\nthing to understand is that we think\nabout motivation as a monolith right so\npeople say i\nlack motivation i don't have motivation\ni wish i was motivated\nso if we really tunnel down into that\nlanguage what it means is that\nmotivation is one quality\nthat has like a quantifiable number\nright it just moves in one direction or\nit's even binary\ni have i have motivation or i don't have\nmotivation\nand so people say like oh i lack\nmotivation\num and so in my experience like that's\nnot really how it works that motivation\nis a lot like body type so\nfor example we know in western medicine\nthat there are different kinds of\nmetabolism right there are people who\nhave slow metabolisms\nand they're people who have fast\nmetabolisms so people who have fast\nmetabo\nmetabolisms can kind of eat whatever\nthey want to and their body is just\ngoing to burn it up\nand then people with slow metabolisms\nthey can even eat healthy and they're\nstill going to be sort of heavyset\nso we can call we call those people like\nbig boned is what people used to say\num and so the first thing to kind of\nunderstand is that like\npeople are different okay and so\nbut in western medicine we don't really\nthink about that in the way that western\nscience conceptualizes things it\nconceptualizes things\nas standalone monolithic concepts so for\nexample like\ngravity is gravity no matter where you\ngo the caloric\nrecommendations from the u.s government\nare like 2 000 calories or the world\nhealth organization\nor 2 000 calories a day no matter who\nyou are or where you are\nright um actually i mean there are\ndifferent caloric\nrecommendations for children and things\nlike that but generally speaking\nwhen we think about western\nrecommendations or western solutions\nthey're a one-size-fits-all solution\nand you kind of see this on the internet\nbecause you'll get a bunch of people who\nare like motivational speakers\nand what they do is try to motivate\neveryone right because they sort of say\nthat you're lacking motivation so you\njust\nneed this motivation and then you'll be\nfine and it's kind of like making a 2000\ncalorie recommendation for\npeople with slow metabolisms and people\nwith fast metabolisms which is kind of\nsilly because these people are\nfundamentally\ndifferent the way their metabolisms work\nis different and so the dietary\nrecommendations need to be\ntailored to the metabolic fingerprint\nof the person right so this person has a\nrelatively different kind of class\nof metabolism they have a different\nmetabolic style\nand therefore they need different kinds\nof recommendations\nfor an ideal diet but that's not how\nwestern medicine works western medicine\nis sort of a one-size-fits-all\nkind of approach right if i diagnose you\nwith depression\ni treat depression so when i was\ntraining to become a psychiatrist they\ngave us a class about\na depression not about people so if you\ngo to the diagnostic and it sounds weird\nbut we treat an illness we don't treat a\nperson\ni say okay if i diagnose you with\ndepression then i go to the depression\nprotocol and i give you this medication\nand i do this and i do this\nand so basically the way that western\nmedicine works is that we\naverage a bunch of stuff and that's what\nwe make is our recommendation\nso if i were to say like okay you know\nhow did they come\nup with the 2000 calorie diet what they\ndid is they asked a bunch of healthy\npeople how many calories do you eat a\nday\nand there was a range some people ate\n1500 some people ate 2 500\nand then they averaged all those numbers\nand they say we recommend that\nyou eat 2 000 calories a day that's how\nwe come up with our answers\nwe average populations to make a uniform\nrecommendation\nbut if you stop and really think about\nit within that population two thousand\ncalories isn't going to work for the\nperson who normally is eating 2500\ncalories\nand isn't going to work for the person\nwho's eating 1500\nand so that's kind of bizarre it's\nalmost like if i were to say okay like\nif we relied on the fda to tell us what\nkind of clothing to wear\nwhat the fda would do is survey the us\npopulation\nand would say what size clothing do you\nwear and some people would wear larges\nsome people wear small\nsome people were would wear extra larges\nthey'd average them all together and\nthey'd say everyone should\nwear between a medium and a large that's\nour recommendation\nand so if you kind of think about it\nthat's just that's just dumb like you're\ngonna miss the boat on a lot of people\nbut like most people would be kind of\nokay with that right\nif you give everyone a piece of clothing\nbetween a medium and large\nit's going to kind of work for a fair\nnumber of people it's going to be like\nkind of baggy but they're not going to\nbe walking around like\nnaked and for the people it's going to\nbe a little bit tight and uncomfortable\nbut they'll manage and so that's what\nour recommendations are like\nso 2000 calories a day sort of works for\nmost people\num but it's not really ideal for many\npeople at all\nand so we think about motivation sort of\nis the same way\nand we kind of say like okay so this is\nwhat works on average for a bunch of\npeople which is what motivational\nspeakers do right they'll say like\ni've done this thing and about 50 of\npeople who show up to my motivational\nseminars get help from it\nand the whole reason that motivational\nseminars\nare still a thing is because they're\nineffective because like just think\nabout this for a second right\nif they were actually effective then\nyou'd do like 10 seminars and then you'd\nhave motivated everyone and then you'd\nbe done and no one would need your help\nthere's a really simple like thing in\nmedicine whereas like you know when you\nhave an effective treatment for medicine\nin medicine like the problem sort of\ngoes away and you don't need the\ntreatment anymore\na good example of this is like the\nsmallpox vaccine like we don't really\nworry too much about smallpox thanks god\nthank god because we sort of like took\ncare of it right\nwe sort of took care of like nutritional\nproblems like you know we sort of took\ncare of things like sinus infections\nwhich used to be lethal like a thousand\nyears ago\nand so when you actually have an\neffective solution\nthe problem sort of goes away and so\nthen the question becomes like why are\nthese motivational seminars so\nsuccessful\nif they don't really fix the problem and\nthat's because they do a good job for a\nslice of the population\nand that's where we get to the concept\nof motivational styles\nso in the west what we tend to think\nabout is that like there's a particular\nkind of motivation that we shoot for\nand i think what gets us into a lot of\ntrouble is it's not\nthat kind of motivation doesn't work for\neveryone\nand that's because we each have a\ncognitive fingerprint or a particular\ncognitive style\nand what i've found is that once you\nunderstand what your cognitive style is\nonce\nonce you understand what your\nmotivational style is\nthen you can actually motivate yourself\nin sort of like a very specific way\nand if we go back to the diet analogy\nlike people are figuring out on their\nown\nthat even though the fda says you should\nyou know bread rice\nor noodles makes no difference you\nshould eat x\nnumber of carbs per day that some people\nare gluten gluten insensitive\nand so like even though the fda says oh\nit makes no difference for some people\nthey're like it absolutely makes a\ndifference\nthat the fda will say a certain amount\nof fat and a certain amount of protein\nwhereas some people will be like dairy\nreally messes me up or cheese really\nmesses me up\nthat there's individual variants within\na population that a global\nrecommendation doesn't capture\nand so i think that's true of motivation\nas well that where we make global\nrecommendations of\nthis is how you get motivated and you\nshould just do this\njust do it man get good noob\nright just do it and that only works for\na particular kind of motivational style\nand so what we're gonna do is turn to\nsomething called\nayurveda so ayurveda is a traditional\nsystem of medicine from india from\nabout 5 000 years ago and the really\ncool thing about ayurveda is people\nin ayurveda sort of said they started\nwith the idea that people are like\nfundamentally different they're like oh\nlook this person has a fast metabolism\nand this person has a slow metabolism\nthis person feels really really like um\nyou know bad when they eat a bunch of\nsalad like they really don't like to eat\nsalad\nand this person really likes salad oh\nthere's like different dietary\npreferences\nthere are different metabolic styles\nthere are different\ncognitive styles and so they came up\nwith these three things called doshas\nand doshas\nare essentially classifications that are\nnot real they're just ways that we kind\nof lump people together\nand what they realized is that the\ndorsals like sort of\nrelate to the elements and what they\nmean by that is not so much that like\nyou can\nyou know so there's like a wind type a\nfire type and an earth type\nand so it's not so much that you know\nyou can like\nbiopsy someone and you're gonna see wind\nin one person but what they noticed is\nthat some\nmines are kind of like the wind they're\nhighly dynamic so i'm avata type which\nmeans i'm a wind type mind\nwhich means that my mind is all over the\nplace so i'm kind of prone to adhd and\nanxiety like my mind kind of thinks\nabout this and then i get excited about\nthat and then i get bored of this and\ni kind of bounce around all over the\nplace\nand then there's there's the second type\nwhich is sort of the fire type mind\nwhich is a bit the mind\nand the bit the mind is sort of like\nfire it's like slow and steady kind of\nburns\ni mean not really slow but it kind of\nburns consistently in one direction\nso if you're trying to figure out you\nknow which way the wind is blowing the\nwind will blow this way today and it'll\nblow that way tomorrow\nwhich is the whole reason you have a\nweather vane right that little thing\nthat spins around because the wind\nchanges direction\nwhereas if i you know if i go to like a\nfield and i like\nlight a fire in the corner of the field\nlike the fire is gonna spread in a\npretty consistent\nand steady manner and this is the kind\nof motivation that we tend to prefer\nor prioritize in the west we tend to\nthink about\nmotivation as fit the style motivation\nlike you wake up every day\nyou hammer out your work you go to bed\nyou wake up the next day you're\nambitious\nyou're driven you're kind of fiery like\nyou you guys like\nyou know people envy and we value sort\nof this western style\nor the fire type motivation of i want to\nwake up every day and have a fire in my\nbelly like i want to work hard and i\nwant to be ambitious\nand uh you know that's the kind of thing\nthat we kind of\ntry to value and then the third\nmotivational style is the kapha style or\nthe earth style\nso people with with a kapha motivational\npattern or sort of like\nslow steady resilient if you think about\nthe earth right like earth is sort of\nlike stable\nit's steady it's strong but it's not\nvery flashy it doesn't move too much\nand so there's a kapha style of\nmotivation which is kind of like slow\nand steady wins the race\nlike um and so these are kind of the\nthree different motivational styles\nokay so i think part of the reason that\ni want to explain this to you guys is\nthat if you try to adopt a motivational\nstrategy that does not meet your\ncognitive style you're gonna run into\ntrouble\nbecause it's not what you're built for\nso just to use a gaming analogy it's\nlike you know if i watch a youtube video\nof like you know mitch has been\nstreaming wow recently so if i watch\nmitch\nand i'm like oh man like mages are op\ndude like mages are sick bro\nand and then like i try to be a mage but\nmy character is like a fighter i'm gonna\nsuck\nright so there are different classes and\njust because a particular class gets a\nbunch of hype\ndoesn't mean it's the class that you're\nplaying and so the most important thing\nis that you need to gear\nand build your strategy based on the\nclass and the stats that you have\nas opposed to like the stats that get\nadvertised\nin the class that gets advertised right\nand so we're gonna kind of go through\nthe three different styles i'm gonna\ntell you a little bit about them\nand i'm gonna tell you a little bit\nabout how to find your ideal form of\nmotivation\nokay all right so what i'm going to call\nthem\nis there's a vata motivation which is a\ndynamic motivation\na bit the motivation which is a driven\nmotivation\nand a resilient motivation which is a\nkapha motivation\nokay and the first thing that i want to\npoint out is that isn't driven in\nmotivation the same thing like isn't\nthat redundant like that's my whole\npoint\nis that we define motivation in the bit\nthe style and that's what holds people\nback is because we assume that all\nmotivation\nhas to be like this drive oriented like\nsteady burn kind of ambition sort of\nmotivation\nand if you really want to be successful\nyou don't need to adopt that style if\nthat's not what works for you okay\nso let's start with the dynamic form of\nmotivation or the vata or wind kind of\nmotivation okay i'm going to use those\nthree terms kind of interchangeably\nso vatas tend to be like very dynamic so\nthey tend to like their mind is sort of\nlike the wind they move in this\ndirection they kind of move in that\ndirection they move in a different\ndirection\nand so their motivation is something\nthat is easy come\neasy go and so the first thing that i\nwant you guys to notice is that for\npeople a lot of people\ncomplain about this they say that my\nmotivation i get super excited about\nsomething\nand then i lack follow through and they\nsay that this is a problem to be fixed\nand then they beat their heads against a\nwall trying to\nstop having their attention wander so\nmuch and then start to like really focus\non follow through and they want to be\nmore bit the like right they want to be\nlike more driven\nand and what i would say to these people\nis actually you shouldn't do that\nbecause that's not who you are and when\ni tried to do that i started to suck at\nlife\nand actually what vata motivators need\nto do is just acknowledge that you're\ngoing to get excited about stuff\nand then you're going to get bored of\nstuff and so the solution for people who\nhave\navata motivational style is to rotate\nwhat you're working on and so what i do\nlike my days like i'm\npart clinician i stream three days a\nweek i see patients\nlike a couple days a week i you know\nhave meetings for healthy\ngamer i do research i do some consulting\nhere and there\num and so like if my my schedule is like\nall over the place like today you know i\nsaw a patient in the morning\ni wrote this lecture now i'm streaming i\nhave a research meeting after this\ni'm going to play some cyberpunk after\nthat i've got a random patient like this\nevening\nand so my mind i can work 10 hours a day\nevery single day as long as i'm giving\nmy\nmind different kinds of things to work\non and this was a huge discovery for me\nbecause what i used to do is like i used\nto look at my colleagues who were\nsuccessful\nand what i would see is people who were\nlike super hyper focused on\none thing like i have a colleague who's\na awesome person\nso she's like an md phd and does a lot\nof schizophrenia brain research\nand she knows the brains of people with\nschizophrenia\nin and out and she like does research\nand works clinically in schizophrenia\nthat's like what she does like day in\nand day out and if\ni would look at her i'd say wow look at\nhow hyper successful she is she's like\nassistant professor at the harvard\nmedical school and she has this like\nshe goes to international conferences\nand presents her research wow she's so\namazing i wish i could devote myself to\nsomething the way that she does\nand then i realized like that's just not\nwho i am right so her\nher style is very kapha oriented we'll\nkind of get to that\nso for vata styles recognize that your\nmind is dynamic\nthat your motivation is easy come easy\ngo that follow through is going to be\nhard for you which is totally fine\nbecause what isn't hard for you is\ngetting re-excited about something right\nso what you want to do is your\nyour excitement is going to bump up and\nthen it's going to fade\nbut what you can count on yourself for\nis you're going to get excited about it\nagain\nso what you need to do is have a\nrotation\nof what you work on so instead of going\nfrom like okay today i'm going to learn\nguitar and tomorrow i'm going to\nlearn drums and then the third day i'm\ngoing to learn piano\npick like one instrument pick like one\nlife skill\nand then like try to write and then work\non your resume and then do this\nand then the key thing about vatas is\nthat instead of going from\none to two to three to four five six\nseven eight nine ten eleven twelve\nthirteen fourteen what you'll actually\nfind is once you hit number three or\nfour\nyou can go back to number one and you'll\nbe just excited about it\njust as excited so you at the end of the\nday what you're gonna do is not dig\none well a hundred feet deep you're\ngonna dig one well one foot deep and\nthen you're gonna start a second well\nand a third well and a fourth well\nand then you just need to rotate back to\nnumber one and then over the course\nof like a month you'll have you'll have\ndug four 50-foot wells\nwhich is like pretty good and kind of\ngood enough okay\nso solution to vata motivation is don't\ntry to force yourself\nto follow through let your mind wander\nand come back to it\nfrom a daily perspective what you want\nto do is take frequent breaks and do\nmultiple things a day\nokay so like for vatas your\nyour day shouldn't be like okay i'm\ngonna start work\nevery day at like you know 10 a.m and\ni'm gonna work until\nsix no i mean your day can be kind of\nall over the place like for structure\nand frequent breaks\nyou know you can start you want to try\nto be consistent but it's okay to have\nsome variability in your start time\nstructure frequent breaks because your\nmind is going to do way better\nwhen it's kind of like fresh and so the\nother way to think about vata motivation\nis that y'all are sprinters\nnot marathon runners so you want to have\nyour day lined up in like multiple\nsprints\nor even like a sprint for a week where\nlike this week i'm gonna sit down and\ni'm gonna learn how to program python\nand then next week i'm gonna sit down\nand i'm gonna like learn how to play the\npiano\nso you want to organize your day in in\nin sprints okay\nor organize your kind of motivational\nstyle in sprints\nnext thing is pitfalls for vata people\nso the pitfalls that vata people run\ninto\ntend to be like anxiety-oriented or\nworry-oriented\nso since our mind is kind of all over\nthe place\nwe tend to um you know anticipate all\nkinds of different sorts of problems\nand then all of those problems will kind\nof destroy our motivation\nbecause we're like this could go wrong\nand that could go wrong and that could\ngo wrong and that could go wrong\nand so the best thing to kind of do\nthere's some meditation techniques and\nthings like that we\nthat we've taught so nadi should be is\nlike a really good technique\nfor um vata motivators\nkapalabhati is also really good you kind\nof want to slow yourself down a little\nbit just recognize that you may worry\nabout things\nand recognize that your mind has the\ncapacity to see\nmore problems than actually exist\nso have a little bit of faith in\nyourself and kind of circle back to it\nand over time your let your excitement\novercome your anxiety because remember\nwhen you get started you're not anxious\nyou're just excited about it\nand so as your excitement dwindles the\nanxiety will start to decrease\nand you'll lose motivation because of\nyour anxiety and that's actually totally\nfine\nso just move to the next thing and then\nover time the excitement will rebuild\nand the anxiety will just kind of go\naway\nbecause the thing that you've got\nworking for you if you're avata mind\nis that the anxiety is going to be a\nsprint in your mind too\nthat the anxiety will flare and as long\nas you don't feed it\nit'll actually die away on its own\nbecause your mind is going to get bored\nof it and it's going to be like oh like\nlet's go do something else now\nso you can play that to your that's a\nstrength that you can kind of rely on\nokay so so def the second type is the\npitta\nor the driven motivational style or the\nthe fire motivation\nso this is what i would call kind of a\nmore traditional motivation so when we\nthink about people who are highly\nmotivated\nwe think about pittas okay so bit the\nmotivation is like the steady burn\nit's like it's not slow but it's kind of\nsteady\nconstant kind of driven towards a\nparticular thing and if you're a pit the\nmotivator generally speaking\nyou may not actually have that much\ntrouble with motivation because our\nsociety is designed\nfor fitness to succeed so our societal\nstructure is like if you look at\nyou know pay raises for example there's\nlike a statistic that suggests that\npeople who earn the highest salaries\nlike move every two years\nso you're not like avatar and switching\njobs every six months\nand you're not like a kapha and\nswitching jobs every five years if you\nlike kind of\ngo to a job you work really hard you\nstart to kind of get bored of it you\nsort of burn out a little bit and then\nyou move to the next thing that's sort\nof the bit the style\nso if you're a pit the motivator a\ncouple of things to\nkind of be mindful of is that you want a\nsort of stable work day so you want to\nwork\nstart at maybe like you know somewhere\nbetween eight and ten in the morning\nand then run until five or six um you\nneces you don't necessarily want to take\na bunch of breaks because like once you\nget going you kind of get going right\num and then like you know if the fire\ngoes out it can be hard to kind of\nreignite it\nsecond thing about bit this is you have\nto be careful about burnout so\nbitters often times have ambition\nthat exceeds their stamina okay so what\nthis means is\nand you go you guys may run into this\nwhich is that\num you know you feel like you really\nwant to work\nbut then you kind of feel burnt out at\nthe end and then like\nyou don't actually end up progressing\nbecause you kind of like\nburnt up too quickly and so what i want\nyou guys to think a little bit about is\nlike\nyou know the brightest candle burns out\nthe fastest\nso if you're a pit that you may need to\nrestrain that kind of fire\na little bit you guys have to be careful\nabout sort of feelings of ambition or\nfeelings of righteousness\nor other kinds of like emotions like\nanger or irritability\nthat drive you to work really hard and\nkind of leave you\nin sort of a burnt out sort of state so\npithas also need to watch out for\ninterpersonal conflict\nso my diagnostic question for pithas is\nare you intolerant of the idiocy of\nothers\nand if the answer to that question is\nyes then chances are you're a pitta\nso as you motivate yourself you guys may\nend up working with other people\nand you may find that their motivational\nstyle\nis different from yours and you can get\nreally really frustrated with them and\nthat can lead to interpersonal conflict\nwhich really shatters your productivity\nbecause then you're fighting with this\nperson instead of doing your work\nso the pitfall to really watch out for\nif you're a beta is interpersonal\nconflict\nthat brings us to our third um\nmotivational style which is kaphas\nso kaphas are earth types or\nthe resilient motivators i kind of think\nabout them\ntheir motivation is like a marathon okay\nso what that means is that it's slow to\nstart\nand really doesn't like start rolling\nuntil like you know\nlate in the day so i want you guys to\nthink about kapha's as people with\nlow acceleration and high top speed\nwhereas vatas have high acceleration and\nlow top speed\nbetas are kind of in the middle so the\nbiggest thing about kaphas is that they\ntend to beat themselves up\nfor not being faster they look at the\nfitness and they say like oh my god look\nat how successful and driven this person\nis\nthey look at the vatas and they're like\noh my god look at how quickly this\nperson learns things\nso uh gaffas just they start slow but\nthey hit their top speed\nand when they hit their top speed they\ndo awesome work so the main thing about\nguppas is you got to give yourself\ntime to get started so some of these\npeople may have a lot of trouble\nstarting work like early in the morning\nand they may sort of like have their\nmost productive hours late at night\nor like in the in the middle of the\nafternoon whereas like a zavata\nonce 3 pm rolls around i like i'm done\nlike my stamina is shot\nand so for kapha kapha's the biggest\nthing that they need to learn is kind of\npatience\nright and recognize that like you're\nsomeone who will take\nmaybe a few weeks or a few months to\nlike figure out how\nyou know your job works some people are\nquick studies\nkaphas are slow studies which doesn't\nmean that they're dumb\nbecause the interesting thing about\nkapha memory is that they learn\nslowly but they also forget slowly\nwhereas vatas learn very quickly and\nthen they forget very quickly\nso with kapha's you're sort of like a\nlate game build\nokay so it's going to take you some time\nto get started so be patient with\nyourself\nonce you get kraken you're a force to be\nreckoned with\nso you can think about kaf as sort of\nlate bloomers i think a lot of people\non you know a lot of people in our\ncommunity are like oh i miss the boat\ni'm so old now\num there are so many people who are\nyounger and more successful than i am\nyou got to understand that you just may\nbe a late bloomer\nand be patient with yourself which\nbrings us to the cognitive pitfall\nof guffas which is that they tend to be\nvery very self-critical and prone to\ndepression\nand as a result they are likely to give\nup\nkind of at the worst possible moment\njust when they're about to really start\nkicking ass\nright so i want you guys to think about\na kapha like a late game carry\nwhereas like if you're 25 minutes into\nthe game and you haven't really done a\nwhole lot you've just been kind of\nfarming and you've died a couple of\ntimes\nbut you're sort of a late game carry and\nand guffas have a tendency to be really\nself-critical\nand so they'll work at something for\nlike you know a week two weeks three\nweeks four weeks and they won't see a\nwhole lot of result\nand then the self-critical thinking\nstarts to step in and says oh look at\nhow dumb you\nare you've been doing this for a month\nand you haven't gotten anywhere you\nmight as well stop\nand then when they stop they really\nshoot themselves in the foot because if\nthey\nactually just like recognize that it's\ngoing to take me a while\nand if you recognize that you're patient\nwith yourself if you let yourself be\npatient with yourself\nif you don't let yourself be quite so\ncritical about how slow you are\nyou'll realize that like when you figure\nthings out you'll have figured them out\ncompletely and then you'll really start\nto fly\nso just give yourself a little bit of\ntime give yourself a little bit of\npatience and recognize that\nyour acceleration is going to be slow\nbut once you get into a groove\nyou'll really do amazing work so i've\nworked with a couple of like guffas\nwho um you know\nthey they sort of feel very anxious in\ntheir workplace because they'll get some\nnew employee\nwho like seems super bright and super\ncapable and everyone's like oh look how\nsmart this person is\nand then like they'll get a new person\nyou know they've been there for three\nyears and then the new person shows up\nnakafa feels like this person is doing\nway better than i am\nand they've only been here two weeks and\ni've been here three three years\nand then if they give themselves a\nlittle bit of patience what they begin\nto see is that like\neveryone starts to realize oh the shiny\nnew toy is just shiny and actually can't\nget the work done\nand they kind of come back to the coffin\nthey're like hey can you help us out\nwith this again\nhey you know it seems like i'm really\nhaving trouble this person's really not\ncutting it\nand so kapha's kind of you know you just\ngot to really give yourself patience\num and so that's sort of a quick rundown\nof different motivational styles just to\nrecap\nwe have vata motivators which are\nsprinters or dynamic\nright motivation is easy come easy go\nthe solution is to rotate things that\nyou work on\nand let your mind be a little bit free\nbut\nrotate them between the same set of\nthings so when you get bored of number\none go to number two when you get bored\nof number two go to number three you get\nbored of number three\nnumber four and then back to one the\nthings to watch out about are anxiety\nso a lot of times your anxiety will tell\nyou oh my god all this stuff will go\nwrong just drop it\nand the cool thing to remember there is\nthat like your anxiety will go away too\nbecause your mind is fata and dynamic\nand you'll get bored of your anxiety\nsecond type is bit the motivators that\nare sort of driven\nmotivators so this is the classic\nmotivation that's kind of kind of steady\nconstant\na lot of ambition which you have to\nwatch out for is interpersonal conflict\nbecause\nyou're going to have low tolerance and\nlow patience for other people\nthere's going to be a lot of anger\nirritability righteousness\nthat could kind of push you in the wrong\ndirection and then you're going to get\nso caught up in your interpersonal\nconflict that you're not going to be\nproductive in your work anymore\nthe third motivational type is the\nkaphas or earth motivators or resilient\nmotivators\nthese are our marathon runners\nso they start slow um they take a while\nto get to top speed but once they hit\ntop speed they're really a force to be\nreckoned with\nso you got to give yourself time and\nhave patience to for yourself\nand recognize that kaphas have a\ntendency to be very self-critical\nand so a lot of kaphas give up right at\nthe moment of success\nand so just give yourself more time give\nyourself time to kind of get started\nand you'll be far more successful\nso i hope that was kind of um\nhelpful and what i want to really what i\nwant you guys to take away is that if\nyou have\ntrouble with motivation maybe the reason\nyou struggle so much is because you're\ntrying to motivate\nyou're trying to play a class that\nyou're not that you aren't\nright so you're a mage running around\nwith a two-handed sword and you're like\nmy dps sucks\nyeah it's going to like start casting\nfireballs bro\nand don't do what other people are doing\nrecognize what your strengths are\nand play to your motivational strengths\nand then you'll be surprised at what\nyou're able to accomplish\nyou"
