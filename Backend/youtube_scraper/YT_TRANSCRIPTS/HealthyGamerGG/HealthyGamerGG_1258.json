    "transcript": "so you guys think you're way up here and\nthen you beat yourself\nup for being over here and so you kind\nof think of yourself in like kind of a\nnegative way right but\nat the end of the day like all of this\nis built\nupon the premise that you're up here\nthere we go welcome folks welcome\num so thank you guys very much for being\nhere let's go ahead\nand start with um just introductions\nso uh do you guys just want to tell us a\nlittle bit about um so tell us what\nyou'd like to be referred to as\nwhat you go by and then tell us a little\nbit about um\nkind of your story is like you're kind\nof identifying as a gifted kid and what\nthat was like\nokay um so i'm said i'm in\nmy final year of my college program\nand so my story is in elementary school\nin high school i was able to\nlike i didn't always hit it out of the\npark but in the places that counted i\ncould always make things work\nbut then when i got to university there\nwere uh\nthere were so for example there were all\nthese other tasks like finding good\ninternships and\nuh helping out professors with research\nassistantships and\ndoing side projects and all of these\nwere things where i either\nlike did where my results were mediocre\ncompared to my peers or like i didn't do\nthem at all so\ni went from a place where everything i\ndid like i could make work to\na state where everything i touched just\nturned into ash\nokay\nuh i'm outcome uh do you want me to yeah\nyeah\ni'm outcome cool um so\nand i was like labeled as like a gifted\nkid like early on\nuh when i was like in uh elementary\nschool um\nand like throughout like elementary in\nmiddle school i never really had any\nproblems with like any of my classes\num one of the feelings that i always\nlike associate with is like there was\nkind of like this weird like\ncast system where like i was like pulled\nout of my classes and like\nuh like taught different material uh and\ni was always kind of like separated from\nlike everyone else who wasn't in like\nthe advanced classes and then coming\ninto like high school\nwhen i had to like uh when i went to\nlike public high school in my second\nyear of high school\ni had to like reintegrate so that was a\nweird feeling and then on top of that\nthings just stopped coming as easily to\nme and i realized that i never really\ndeveloped like\ngood study skills good time management\nthings like that and i was just\nconsistently falling behind\nand this last semester in college has\nkind of been like the\nthis uh it was my first semester in\ncollege has been like the um\nall of that like kind of conglomerating\ntogether and i just did really poorly\nand um\ni'm actually dropping out this year and\ni'm joining the military\nokay um okay uh i'm\nb i guess uh uh so basically\nuh same story like uh labeled gifted kid\nin like elementary school\num i did like pretty fine up until like\nlike pretty much until high school\nfinished um i graduated here early\num from like an aerospace academy uh\nbut i didn't really want to do like\naerospace stuff so\num i thought i might want to do\nengineering things so\num i i had like a full ride scholarship\nessentially\nand i lost it because i um\nlike failed a couple of classes for\nreally silly reasons\num and so i decided to try to do like\nengineering things so i got like a job\nat an engineering firm\nand um it's just not something i wanted\nto do\nso now i've just been doing nothing for\nlike the past year and a half\nokay\num i can go um i go by seoul and um\nyeah so i was like early on um labeled\nas gift a kid or our school district had\na gifted and talented\neducation program uh they called it like\ngate um\nand yeah same story elementary middle\nschool high school or just like a breeze\num basically i put in minimal effort and\nstill got good grades which made it so\nthat\ni didn't feel like i didn't even have\nlike the energy to try\nuh at school and i i\nthat's basically where i'm at now in\nuniversity islam i'm still trying to do\nthe bare minimum to get good grades and\ni can't find the energy to\npursue other things or like work on side\nprojects or try to find an internship um\nyeah that's where i'm at okay\nall right and i'm jacob um\nyeah i grew up you know\nthere wasn't a gift and talented program\nwhen i was growing up but like\nkind of like forging went ahead um ended\nup going to a prestigious college just\nkind of\ngoing down this constant\njust kind of just going down this path\nof like you know pursuing\nlike getting good academics and\nyou know just kind of going down this\nvague stem\nengineering path until like junior year\nwhere all i was doing was massive and\nmassive massive tons of work\nand like was not really socially\nconnected at all\nand at that point i had like no\ninternships and whatnot it just kind of\nbroke down\num and then almost failed my thesis\nsenior year\nand i had i got one job at like an\ninvestment\nfirm for like four months that i ended\nup like\nhaving to leave because of anxiety and\nyeah it's just\nthings just built up until it broke so\nwow so\nhmm can i think for a second\nsure yeah absolutely we have to play\nthis card early today\num so i guess let me just think out loud\nso i think they're kind of two\ngeneral we've got kind of a fork in the\nroad\none is how you got to be here\nand the second is what you're doing\nabout it\nright so like i'm hearing like different\nthings\nlike so some people have sort of you\nknow dropped out\nhaven't really been doing a whole lot\nsort of didn't cut it some people are\nsort of like\nscraping by and then you've got alcohol\nhere who's like decided to drop out of\ncollege and join the military\nright and and so\nyou know i find myself kind of being\ncurious about\nyou know like and because you guys use\nlike some common terms right you guys\nkind of talk about the extra stuff\nlike why it's hard to do the extra stuff\nyou guys talk about\nlack of work ethic or like other things\nthat have sort of been responsible\nfor you know your struggles now\nand then you guys also talk about um\nyou know the caste system and sort of\nbeing treated differently so i think\nthose are all sort of things we can dig\ninto\ni wonder a little bit about um\nyou know you guys talk about lacking\nmotivation and some of these other\nthings\nbut um i i wonder a little bit about\nwhether that's actually like a\nmisdiagnosis\nand sort of digging into what it is that\nlike really holds you back\nso if you think about applying for an\ninternship like literally what is the\nproblem that you run into\num so those are all kinds of directions\nand\nlike i said we can sort of talk a little\nbit about what it's like to be where you\nare now and how you guys\nmade the decisions that you did yeah so\ni mean is there anything that uh\nactually so maybe this is a good way\nso is there anything about anything else\ndid you hear anything from any of your\ncolleagues that you guys are kind of\ncurious about\nyeah actually um the military thing\nstood out like um\nit's just a very big life change and\nit's something that's like very scary\nand\nsomething i would never um probably\nnever consider doing so i'm curious\nabout what\nmade you decide to do that outcome\num yeah so one of the things like one\nanother like driving factor in me like a\nlot of the anxiety i feel with like\ngoing to college\nis um i feel like\nlike i feel like in the non-stem fields\nthere's like a real\nlack of like um like a defined path on\nlike how to get to like an established\ncareer\nlike if you do like art drawing video\nediting those can all be hard fields to\nget into\nbecause you have to go through like\nindependent people\nlike independent firms and things like\nthat and it's a very like\nrigorous um something you like place\nupon yourself like for like you you do\nhave to do like a lot of freelance for\nlike journalism and for uh drawing\nand for video editing uh and then even\nin the stem fields as well i feel like\nthere's a large over saturation\nand so one of the driving forces for me\nis like financial stability\nand i live in the us and i mean we put a\nlot of money into our military and\num you know whether or not that's a good\nor bad thing is\nkind of political but like at the end of\nthe day\nthat would get me you know established\nas like having a career\nand like kind of starting off um in a\nway that like\ncollege really doesn't give me that\nlevel of like financial security um\nand i'm doing like academic things as i\ngo into the navy\nuh like i'm doing like a nuclear program\num and so i like i uh one of the things\nlike i hope that like um\ni work i know that i work well with like\na very like regimented schedule\nwhich is something that like military\nacademics is like notorious for\nprescribing to its students\nuh so i know i can like function well in\nthat type of environment\num and it is like a lot of hard stem\nwhich is like something that i am good\nat like just naturally\nso it should come easier than if i was\ndoing like psychology major or something\nlike that\num but it's at the end of the day it\nreally is just kind of like\na deal of like financial security it's\navailable and it seems like a good\ncareer path for me\na good way for me to get like\nestablished as like\nyou know in my life\ni think that makes you the bravest out\nof all of us here because\nthe rest of us are like either we're\nfailing or just crawling by\nand and you managed like you mentioned\nbefore in one of our early\nearlier conversations that your parents\nwere not really\non board with you joining the military\nso\nyeah i guess i commend you for having\nthe courage to make that move\nthank you yeah that's i mean it's a lot\nof it's like stressful i guess but it's\nat the end of the day like it gives me a\nlot of like\nlike i i so one of the things is like\ni've never been like diagnosed with\nanything but i've always struggled with\nlike anxiety like social anxiety\nuh performance anxiety uh like\nexistential dread about like the future\nand things like that\nand so like the military just like\nhaving like that thing where it's like\noh yeah you go in\nand like after i get through basic\ntraining like i'm kind of set\nlike i'm just kind of like i'm just in\nthere and i'm good to go for like the\nnext eight years of my life i'll have my\nmedical my\nmy dental and like everything covered\nand that like like the amount of like\nweight that that takes off of my chest\nlike like i can't even like\nspeak to how amazing that is to me\ni didn't really relate to that like\nwanting like um a step-by-step\nsort of program that at the end will\ngive you security for sure i can uh\nyeah i think that's really good\none of the things sorry\nyeah uh one of the things that stood out\nand uh this is just kind of like\ni think it was uh i want to say it was\nseoul that said it but it was like\nor i think we all kind of like talked on\nit but like like scraping by and like\ndoing the bare minimum\ni didn't really like put words to that\nbut that's certainly like a feeling that\nlike resonates really well with me\nof like i feel like through all like all\nof my academics it's always just been\nlike a\nlike a very like um it's not so much\nthat i never had to try it's just that\nlike i only tried\nto the point that it was like beneficial\nto my grades\nor the things that i could put like a\nquantitative value on\nwhere i could be like okay i sit down i\ndo my homework for an hour\ni get like six study sheets done you\nknow that\nthat does x amount to my grade that\ngives me you know\nso much about like so much um\nuh like points towards like the end of\nmy year total like if i need like a\nthousand points for a semester then that\ngives me like 100 points like\nit's very easy for me to like\ncompartmentalize that and be like okay\nthis is how i do it\num and that's like not being able to do\nthat with like college\nlike for like a career goal that's what\nscares me\num but like i think there are like other\nexamples of like\nall of us growing up just kind of doing\nthe bare minimum of like that's just\nkind of how we were raised\nto some extent yeah so let me ask\nlet me ask y'all are you guys envious of\nalchem\num i'm happy for him that he's found\nsomething that he\nfeels comfortable doing and he's been\nable to make a decision because i\nhaven't found that so i'm not envious\nthat um\nlike he's going to the military but i'm\ni i really admire and maybe in some\naspects i'm jealous of being able to\njust make a huge like decision like that\nand and go through with it\ni feel like like in my world or in my\nmind the university is just like\na fact of reality like you ha i have to\ngo to university and i have to find a\njob at the end of it with my degree\nor like like what else is there in life\nalmost it feels\nlike that powerful to me as a construct\nwould you all say said jacob\nwhat do y'all think\ni mean i wouldn't say\ni mean for me university wasn't that\nso for me a lot of it was actually\ntrying to like\nescape the ruts of the university\nparadigm because it was like\nmy school is just very\nmuch trying to\nit like made everything competitive like\neven the social scene\nwas like prestige oriented\nwhich was yeah so it's like\nso um maybe maybe at some point i was\nbut it's like maybe like in high school\ni was but it's like\nthrough college is kind of like\ndisillusioned to that\nokay what were you saying said\ni'm not i'm not envious of alchem in the\nsense that i resent him\nbut uh but i guess hearing about\nhow well it's\ni'm not envious in the sense that i\nresent him but i look back on myself and\ni think\ngoddammit said um what happened to you\nand when you say what happened to you\nwhat what\nwhat are you what ballpark are you\npointing that question in\nhaving taking steps towards\nsome semblance of a career being able to\ndo have some kind of\nemployable skill like i have i have like\na mixed bag but they're all sort of\nlike i obtained them just by chance i\nstumbled into whatever\ninternships that would take me and\nthey're all like a mixed bag of niche\nthings that don't really fit together\nwhereas alchem seems to have taken\nlike a like a direct step that will\nyou know put some it'll add some\ndirection\ninto into his future i've just been like\nsitting around here\nnot doing much so i i see that you guys\nare steering clear basically of the word\nenvious but y'all are happy to use words\nlike admire\nit has this negative connotation to it i\nthink it does\nright and and so i think it's\ninteresting because like what's the\ndifference between admiration and envy\num well okay uh like you use the word\nyourself right um it's if you resent the\nother person\nfor their ability as well um and you\ndon't like\nyeah interesting so you guys are you're\nsaying that envy\nlead is coupled with resentment\ni think so that's how i envision it okay\nso i don't end i don't envy alkaline\nthat way i admire okay\nso um and would you guys sort of\ni thought sed did a pretty good job of\nlike voicing what he admires about\nalchem would you guys agree with that\nsentiment that like\nbasically alcum is like he's like taking\na step forward in a definitive way\nyeah absolutely okay so if we're kind of\nsaying\ni i want to be able to do that too\nlet's try to understand what how\nwhat motivates alchem to take this step\nforward\nyeah how did you like start making that\ndecision\ni guess i mean for i mean if i'm keeping\nit a buck it was the\nfinancial insecurity like um\nlike one of the things is i have like a\nbit of a rocky relationship with my\nparents and so i was moved out for a bit\nand dealing with my own finances uh when\nyou don't have a college degree or like\nany real\nlike uh superseding skills to merit the\nonly thing you can really go into\nis the service industry and that [ __ ]\nwill like\nwork you dry and like you'll come home\nat the end of your days\ntired and beaten and it's sometimes like\n60 hour work weeks\nand i i was doing that on top of like\ngoing to my community call it like my\ncommunity college and like\nthat shit's brutal that pardon my french\nbut that is brutal stuff to go through\nand like\ni kind of was coming towards the end of\nthis year and i was just like\ni i can't do this like\nthe whatever it whatever this is like\nit's not worth it\nfor me and so i was desperate to find\nsomething and\num i like in the school that i went to\nlike my high school there was always a\nstrong presence of like military\nrecruitment\nand i had like never seriously\nconsidered it in the past past but i had\nlike\na few of my friends had gone into it um\nand i know some people some guys in my\nfriends of mine who have been like\nreally happy with it and so that was\njust like\nit was kind of like there and available\nand i you know sat down with my\nrecruiter and i talked to him about it\nand i'm happy with the decision and a\nlot of other\nlike the other people in my life were\npretty happy for me and so\ni just kind of said you know\nwe ball and did it so what did you guys\nhear\nmotivated outcome desperation\nyep yeah that's yeah\nso it's interesting right because we\nthink about motivation as a good thing\nlike we think about it as a positive\nquality like we strive for motivation\nbut what alchem is telling us is that\nhis\nmotivation is born of desperation\nand and what we're sort of hearing is\nalmost like a bottom of the barrel kind\nof\nstory where like he like he hit rock\nbottom like there's just\nthere's nowhere else to go but down and\nit doesn't seem like\nthere's a whole lot of chance to go up\nand oddly enough\ni think that there's there's a lot about\nalchem that i i think i can sort of\npersonally relate to as a gifted kid who\nstruggled i mean i think\nout of all the groups that we've uh sort\nof talked about i think you know i\nidentify with you all the most\nand i think there's a certain\ndesperation to it\num i think they're also like elements of\nlike seeding control right so alchem\nlike you guys don't trust yourselves\nbecause you're not gonna do any more\nthan the bare minimum\nand so like all alchem has to do is like\nsign up and then there's no take backs\nright he he freezes absolutely he frees\nhimself of his mind\nbecause it doesn't matter whether he\nwants to or feels like it or whatever\nbecause they're gonna\nthey're not gonna give him a choice and\nand so he's like sort of seeding control\nof his life and then like relying on\nthem to provide as he said he he\nresponds well to regimented structure\nwhich i imagine actually all of you all\nof y'all will\nthat if if there's a situation that's\nchallenging\nand regimented and doesn't give you guys\na choice then y'all will actually do\nreally well\ni i think though it's kind of\ninteresting because um\nyou know i'm kind of curious about\nego alchem do you think that your\nyour ego has anything to do with your\ndecision\ncan you elaborate a bit more on what you\nlike\ni mean\ni don't know could you could you like\nask the question a different way i'm\nkind of confused by it\nabsolutely um\nhow do you feel about yourself joining\nthe military\ni mean i'm i'm happy with the decision i\nlike i think it's a good decision yeah\nlike growing up\num i've always had like like i feel like\nthe reason i always did well in school\nis because like it wasn't a choice\nit was like you know you wake up like\nyou know and your mom is like all right\nget in the car\nor you know it's like hey the school\nschool bus is here\nor like your dad takes you or whatever\nthe situation is and you go and you sit\nyou can't really like leave\nright and your teachers are your\nauthority figures they tell you what to\ndo\nand you just kind of you got the\nregimented schedule\nand it i mean it feels really good that\nlike\nit's kind of like obviously it's not\nlike super self-imposed but the fact\nthat it's like\nit's a decision that i'm making but i\nalso know that like once i\nkind of like what you stick with what\nyou said once i signed that we know\nwhether or not i want to do it\ni'm in i'm in for however many years i\nsigned up for right\num like at that point that's pretty like\nit feels great\nyeah so let me ask the question a\ndifferent way how do you feel telling\nother people that you're joining the\nmilitary\nkind of weird uh i so\num i mean the military is\nis like a really good opportunity for me\nbut it's like out of\nit's kind of out of pocket for me uh\nit's not something that i would like\never really consider doing um\nit was kind of something like it was\nborn out of desperation and it's not\nreally like within\nmyself to do it like i wouldn't like\njust by the choice between like going to\ncollege like if you had asked me three\nyears ago i would have never said i was\ngoing to the military\nthat would have been like the bottom of\nthe list um so i'm kind of apprehensive\nabout it\num but like the way i tell people about\nit\num and how do people usually respond\nthey're normally like oh wow that's a\ngreat decision you know that'll be great\nfor you\nand all of that stuff so what did y'all\nnotice about everyone shared their story\nand how did who did we gravitate towards\nthe one who'd made a decision or who'd\ndone something\nright so what when alcam shares what\nhe's done what is he met with\npraise praise\nadmiration and so let's just think a\nlittle bit about\nyou know before the decision outcome so\nwhere was he before he decided to join\nthe military where was he\nvery low spot right\nso failed out of college sounds like or\ndropped out or something\nyeah and and so so i i think because\ni i sort of saw pieces of this in myself\ni don't think joining the military is a\nbad idea by the way just for the record\nbut i want us to understand a little bit\nabout\nwhy we make decisions and like what\ndrives us\nso like alchem gives us a very logical\nreason\nthe first reason he gave us was super\nlogical it's for financial security\nit makes sense like if he's like anxious\nabout his financial security and whatnot\nlike it's a good reason\nwe dig a little bit further and we get\nto desperation\nright that like even though he sort of\ntalks about financial insecurity that\nlike\nhe's living this life and he wakes up\none day and he's like i can't live this\nlife anymore\ni have to live a different one\nand i think oddly enough what you guys\nmaybe admire about him\nand here i could be projecting but i\nalmost remember like i used to wish for\ncatastrophe\ni i used to wish for being tested you\nknow i\ni wanted to like just like what i what i\nwas what i hated more than anything else\nwas like\nlimbo and like not needing to scrape by\nlike i would have been fine if if you\nhad said\ni'm gonna drop you into an arena and you\nhave to fight a lion to the death and\ni'm gonna give you a club i would have\nbeen like\nhell yeah let's go baby yeah\nright give me death or give me glory\nlike i just can't stay stuck in between\nanymore\nyou guys feel that way oh yes\ntell me about that absolutely jacob\noh there's so many so i the the jo\nlike the weird thing i tell my friends\nhonestly i'd feel better when i'm sick\ni'd actually be more productive when i\ngot\nsick because like expectations would\ndrop and it's just like oh what can i\nget done while i'm feeling crummy and i\nactually get more done\nbut like there's so many i i there's\nlike\nso many dimensions of like\nlike my anxiety dropped when cove had\nhappened\num i felt better and like more\neager to be productive when covet\noccurred um\nlet's see what else uh\nmy mom recently got diagnosed with\ncancer\nand that wasn't great but it's like\nit wasn't like crushing it was like\ni think for like the week around that i\nwas like a little bit more productive\nlike it's it's very bizarre\nlike\nis that something that you all can\nrelate to\nmaybe earlier i think um\ni tried taking advantage of the fact\nthat i would act under\nunder um if i had no other choice and i\ni tried i tried saying okay if i sign\nmyself for all these other things then\nwhich will all be catastrophes if they\nfail\nthen i'll do them but then i didn't and\nthen the catastrophe happened and i\nsurvived and i realized that\ni guess there is no way out maybe that's\njust\nyeah so like so so like you guys see\nwhat y'all are doing is that you're not\nit's actually brilliant and sad so like\nwhat set is doing is he's\nhe recognizes that he can't motivate\nhimself\nright so he like recruits the outside\nworld to put deadlines on to him\nand the same thing that outcomes doing\nit's like i'm gonna i can't control\nmyself so i'm going to create\na situation in which there's artificial\ndesperation and i'll be forced to act\nand then sad really gets screwed because\nhe doesn't act\nand then you know what the really\ndamning thing is about not acting\nis that he survives\nsee if he had really been punished then\nhe would act the next time\ndoes that make sense like the real\ndamning thing is that like the\nconsequences weren't bad enough\nbecause if the consequences were bad\nthen if he did it again then he would\nact\nyou all see that does that make sense\nyeah so um yeah that's really what i'm\ninterested in is\num i feel like anyone if they're in a\nlife or death situation\ngravitates towards life or if they're in\na catastrophic situation they do\nanything they can to get out of it but\num\nif you're not in that place how do you\ngo towards ambition or like success uh\nyeah i i don't understand how people\nhave the energy for for that kind of\nmotivation and not not like um\njust avoiding death\nso tell us what it's like to not have\nenergy\nright the extra stuff\ni don't want revenge go ahead\nokay um i um\noh well it doesn't feel great uh it's\nlike the days just kind of\nslip by you do your work and then i\ndon't know you play some games um\nand then like yeah the time just gets\nfilled with things that are\nnot really valuable to you but then you\ndon't even know what the things that\nare valuable you don't know what is\nvaluable to you\nso you just kind of\nyeah time just looks fine that's the\nbest way i can describe it\nit feels kind of like like monotonous or\nanonymously monotonously not necessarily\nflipping pages\nlike you're just kind of like going from\none day to the next\num like when i was going through this\nlast thing i was also working a lot and\nit was just like this kind of like day\nin day out\nwake up do school go to work just like\nkind of like this dread\nand like whenever i had free time i was\nlike\nlike you know i was doing like partying\nor like\ndoing drugs or like something to fill\nthe time\num and it was just like i don't know i\nwas like hellish\ni could like feel myself kind of almost\nlike decaying\nbut it felt like i couldn't do anything\nabout it\nlike i couldn't take the first step\nit's just like gray and dystopian\nseriously like it is right oh yeah\nabsolutely\nwhat i'm really appreciating is that\nwe're talking about this with a bunch of\n[ __ ] gifted kids so the number of\nsyllables per word is so high\nmonotonously in dystopian\nyeah it's just\nit's rough out there for us yeah we are\nwe all just going through it\ni said did you want to say something oh\num do you ever watch revenge of the sith\nwhere anakin's\nanakin's just burning up and obi-wan\nscreams at him for failing in his duties\nto be the chosen one\nit's like every day it's like i have two\nchoices it's either\nit's either that or i numb myself and\nthere's\nand there's no option to and like the\noption to actually do\nsomething is blocked by like a version\nof me that that says\nwell we're not going to do that what are\nyou going to do about that said\nand yeah so it's either numb myself or\nscreaming myself and nothing happens\neither way\ngood you want to say something b\num i i don't know i i feel like\nuh\nany anything that i would say would be\nkind of is kind of like really\novershadowed by\nthe kind of problems that i've like\nheard i guess\num doesn't really feel relevant\nsay it anyway um\ni it's just like basically echoing with\nwhat they're saying and like to a lesser\nextent\nof um uh so like when i\ngot out of uh when i like lost my\nscholarship and i'm like just basically\nat home doing nothing um for like a year\nand a half it's been\nlike awesome uh i haven't had to do\nanything\nright uh and just being able to coast\nand\num play games all day and uh\nyou know maybe you know look for a job\nsometimes and\nor do something just to cast yeah\nlike i i there's no there's no\nresponsibility that i have to to take\ncare of\nand it's kind of like scary that that\nfeels good so\ni don't know so i have a question for\nseth and the rest of all\nwho are you sad says i know who i am\nright and it's either scream at myself\nor be myself\nso who are you\ni wonder if that's a trick question\nbecause um\nwho am i is a question i've been asking\nmyself for\nevery day for the past uh 19 years of my\nlife um\nand it's and yeah it's evolved a lot\num but like at this point i kind of\nseparate myself from\nthe idea of like self or identity like i\nseparate identity and\nwhat i consider to be the existence of\nme if that makes any sense\ni does it make sense to people\nyeah well not really\nnot to me there's like two different\nkinds of identities\ni think there's one that you ascribe\nyourself and then one that\nother people ascribe you um\nand it just depends which one you care\nabout more\nwill be uh more of who you are i don't\nknow\nso not to get like overly philosophical\nbut the way that i see\nlike like there's like some like inner\nme\nthat is just like experiences and\nfeelings\nand then there's like an outer me that\nis like actually can think and speak and\nform thoughts and\nhas values beliefs ideas like ascribed\nonto it\num and i want to be like\nmore i want to like dissolve all the\nparts that are identity and just be like\nokay existing\nbecause i feel like identity puts a lot\nof pressure on you too\nwell to be certain things\num and if you're not those things then\nthen who are you so like if you place\nall\nyour value self-worth or who you are on\nyour identity then\nwhen your identity is challenged you you\nare challenged\nso solely what is we'll get there\nso who here resonates\nwith what soul is saying like who here\nis like\nsort of or like i'm not really too sure\nor like yeah man\nyeah i i didn't forget it the first but\nthe second time\ni kind of like i kind of get it for me\nthe word i used to describe it is like a\nmantle\nit's like this i like this like ideal\nself\nthat like i would love to live into that\ni would love to be\nuh but like and not even like in like\num like overly high standards sometimes\nsometimes it's just like a pretty low\nbar\num and it's sometimes it's just hard for\nme to like live into that\nlike it's hard for me to reach there and\nit feels kind of like defeating\nand so i'd certainly get the feeling of\nlike kind of just wanting to be like\nlike detached from that or like like get\nrid of it just kind of like cast it\naside\nbecause i often feel like when i don't\nlive into it i'm disappointed with\nmyself\nyeah and the hard thing about the mantle\ni i really love that you tossed in that\ndetail outcome is that\noftentimes you expect so little from\nyourself\nand that's what's so crushing when you\ncan't even do that\nyeah right it's like one thing to be\nperfect but it's like another thing to\nlike okay let me just like work on my\nresume for like 15 minutes today\nand you can't even do that yeah\ncrushing so\ni'll i'm gonna ask sad but you know once\nagain\nanyone can kind of jump in i appreciate\nwhen people do so sad when you say that\neither you're screaming at yourself or\nyou're being yourself like what are\nlike who is that cell like what who are\nyou tell us about\nwho you are and how you view yourself\ni guess i see myself as so like i had a\ngood shot\nat i guess uh\ni suppose i have a vision of of myself\nthat would get\nthings right you know like who would\nhave gotten the right internship or\nwho would have actually um put more\neffort into those responsibilities or\nwould have prevented the catastrophe\nand then there's but then who i am is\nis the person who failed to do all of\nthat so\nsometimes sometimes i feel like i'm just\na guy who\nwho had a shot and threw it away and now\ni've just missed the boat\nand i'm like stranded here in limbo\ndoes anybody resonate with that feeling\nb can you tell us like what your\nexperience of that is like or what you\nthink about yourself or what thoughts\nyou have\nabout yourself um\nsure so um i guess\nin terms of like missing missing the\nshot right i had like this\nyou know full like full ride of you know\ni can\npretty much get through all of college\nand or at least four years and\num have no debt and you know that's what\neveryone wants right so\ni have this this you know ability to do\nthis\nand you know i sleep in for a test\nthat's worth 30 percent of my grade\ni just don't do any work in a class that\ni don't think matters but uh then when\nthose two things add together the\nyou know i just lose my whole\nscholarship right so\num it's\nlike i i still have this ego of oh i\nknow i can do it\nuh but i didn't uh and this like doesn't\nmatch up\nuh of i don't know yeah\nso yeah i missed i missed my shot\nyeah so let's talk about that ego for a\nsecond like i know i can do it\nwhat do you guys think are you guys\ncapable\nor not\ndepends\njacob you want to go yeah i i mean it\nit depends on the task\nand personally also depends whether i\ncan zone into it\nlike like in college in high school like\neverything was like\nkind of like if i could get into a flow\nstate and like focus on it i could\nget it done and if i couldn't it was\njust like\npulling teeth and\nlike as i got out of culture did more\nand more stuff the proportion of things\nthat were\npulling teeth uh increased\num\nand so it's like\nyeah like i i'm not certain if i could\nhold down like a full-time job right now\nor like\nyeah i feel like you know like certain\nproblems i like very good\nlike i feel like there's a very like\nthere's some set of things that i can do\nvery well and there's just like but like\na general holistic life probably not so\nhow does it feel to say that jacob to\nsay those words out loud\nuh i mean i've been coming to terms with\nit for like\nthe last few months so it's not\noh it's not like a huge shock at the\nmoment but\ni don't know it's been relieving coming\nto terms with that so\nactually over time what is it what do\nyou guys think that jacob is coming to\nterms with\nhis idea that he's in some sense like\nshort of his ideal self and that's who\nhe is now\nwhat would you say jacob how how\naccurate is that\num i mean the way i describe it with\npeople is that like\nlike the entire time like it's like\nyou're preparing for a war\nlike i've been making like a jet like\nworking really hard to make like\na giant like battleship turret and i get\nto the end and they're like all right\nare you ready to mount it on your\nbattleship it's like\nno i don't it's i just have like this\nmassive gun that i have to like\ncarry around with like a little bicycle\nand chain\nbecause like there's nothing there to\nactually support like you know\ngoing through like four years of college\nand developing like eight billion\ntechnical skills and like\nphilosophy of the universe when it's\njust like\nyou know i can't sleep and i like\nstruggle to take care of an apartment\nand like\ni can't network whatsoever and like\ni have no like the i haven't even\nstarted thinking about\nlike at no point was like developing the\nnavigation computer to figure out where\nwe're actually going with this thing\nand it's like so\nyes i can send a 500 kilogram projectile\nvery far\nif it's like standing still placed right\nin front of me\nbut we're not doing anything useful with\nthat thing\nso what i'm hearing is that\njacob has faith that he can do it in a\nperfect set of circumstances\nright if the stars align and he's\nbut his his temperamental self otherwise\nhe feels somewhat\nincapable you know when you factor in\nlike the real world and\nall the problems that come with it yeah\nyeah\nright now i think there's a lot of like\npowerful imagery there about the sense\nof it slipping away\nright because jacob used to be decent at\nthe flow state\nand i don't know if you guys sort of\nfelt this but then like something\nhappens and it becomes harder\nlike and then each day becomes like like\nyou used to be okay\nyou used to be able to pull it off often\nenough\nand then you see yourself slipping then\nlike\nyou can barely pull it off often enough\nand then you can't really pull it off\nas much as you need to and then it\nbecomes less\nand less and it's sort of like okay so\nyou're\nyou know i think someone used the phrase\nlike i missed the boat\nright so like the boat is there and\nyou've got 15 minutes to board and\nyou're like okay that's no big deal and\nthen five minutes to board and it's like\noh god\nand they're like pulling they're like\npulling the you know the walkway away\nand like if you run right now you can\nstill like\njump across and like get on board and\nthen the jump becomes longer\nand then you're like but you can still\ndo it and then like you like it starts\nto pull away and maybe you can jump in\nthe water and even if you jump in the\nwater\nlike they'll throw you a line and you\ncan climb on board but like every day\ngoes by and it's like slipping away and\nyou're like\nwatching it slip\naway\nwhat's that like soul i see you nodding\nemphatically\num yeah i definitely felt that um\nduring like early no last year when\ni was in a class and like yeah the\nclasses are always so\neasy at the beginning and you understand\neverything\nand you're doing the assignments\neverything's just going well and then\neach lecture gets a little more and more\nabstract and difficult for you to\nunderstand\nand uh at the end you're like okay i\nneed to\nlike review everything study everything\nmake sure i have everything right so i\ncan actually\nget past the final and um and pass and\nmaybe you don't even do that because\nyou are just procrastinating or\nsomething\num i feel to the question you asked\nearlier about like whether you're\ncapable\num i want to see if other people relate\nto this too\ni feel like i could learn to do anything\nif i had the energy to that i don't have\nlike\nthe way it's modeled in my head is that\ni don't have the energy to do\nany of that or the passion whatever you\nwant to call it\nyeah yeah i feel that\ni don't know if that's exclusive to us\nthough um\ni think uh\nthe difference between or or one of like\nthe major\ndifferences between like uh like a\ngifted kid or\nlike you know like an average kid i\ndon't know would be\none is told that they're\nlike like better basically from a young\nage and\nyou know they have this ideology that\nthey get to keep up\nthey get to say oh i am this so i can\npush forward with it\num and i think that that\nthat gets you so far uh or only so far\num could i um rephrase for a second um\nyeah yeah so i i definitely understand\nthat like everyone has this problem\nobviously but um what i mean\nin the aspect that's particular to us is\nthat um\nlike do you guys like doubt your\nintelligence or like your ability to\nto learn things and process things\nquickly because that's something that\nstays like constant to me\nand it's like the only barrier if i\ncould just unlock that potential by like\ngiving it a boost\nwith energy would be like that's like\nthe only barrier to me is the energy\nthing and like\ni have confidence in almost every other\naspect\nof like being able to learn and do\nthings\nyeah that's kind of what i mean when i\ntalk about like the battleship analogy\nit's like\nyes if i could support this i could\nlevel\neverything but i can't support it\nand it sucks yeah like i i feel like\ni've got like the like the\nthe baseline like like i feel like\nmaybe i don't know maybe that's like the\nintuitive problem solving or like\nsomething\nlike i've got the things that i need to\nlike like if i wanted to like learn a\nnew skill\nor like like try to like you know um\nlike work on like marketing myself for\nlike marketing you know x product i'm\nworking on or whatever like i feel like\ni could do that\nbut it just feels like i yeah like i\ndon't know the energy like i don't have\nthe passion for it like i just kind of\nlike\nsit down and one of the things is like i\nstart asking myself like why am i\nlike why am i doing this you know like\nwhat for what reason and i get bogged\ndown in like this endless loop of like\nwell\nyou know like why is it important to me\nand then like i come upon like\nself-identity like who am i\nwhy is it important to like me why it's\nimportant to like my ideal self and i\njust get like\nshut down and i kind of like shut myself\ndown before i even have the ability to\nlike\nengage with like the the critical\nthinking skills that like\nthat i know or at least i hope that i\nhave\nfor you guys kind of relate to this idea\nof like shutting yourself down before\nyou even get started\nyeah can you guys share what that what\nyour experience of that is\nso it starts with like an idea and\nyou're very excited about it\nand then you think about every other\nidea you've had in the past\nand it tapering off and failing in the\nmiddle of it or towards the end\nand you're like you know let's get ahead\nof the curve on this one and not waste\nall that time\nand by waste that time you mean try yeah\nyeah it's not quite the same for me but\nit'll be like\ni have like i have like\nseveral projects that i've been like\nworking on over like the whole\nfew years and it's like you know it's\nlike\nif i really want like one of these\nthings to go like i have to sacrifice\nand it's like do i really want to like\nis this worth sacrificing devoting\nmyself to and it's like\nand then like you know i'll get into\nlike that mindset where it's like well\npreviously like you know sacrificing\nlike devoting yourself single-mindedly\nhas\nyou know landed me in very miserable\ndeen states and\nor situations where i'm like unbalanced\nand miserable and so it's just like\ni kind of linger in that\nstate of like you know kind of\npoking at a bunch of different things\nand like kind of keeping the dream alive\nkind of\nbut\nsaid it sounded like you had something\nto say oh\num i guess for me it's like\nuh maybe it was easier earlier but now\nthat i've had i guess\nuh four or five years of seeing\nmyself being able to do things but just\nnot doing them\nit's like when i try something when i\nthink about trying something new it's\nlike i see\nthe whole history of all of all my\nfailures staring back at me and accusing\nme\nso i just don't start because facing\nthat is just too terrifying\nwhat's terrifying about it\ni guess so there's there's the numbing\npath and there's the screaming path and\nso i can i can keep myself kind of\nstable\nwhen when i'm numbing myself but then to\nto get to face that history again then\nlike\nall the old voices that scream at me and\nsay like\nwhy did you [ __ ] this up this is so easy\num\nthat just it's just too harsh\ni can't i can't like function when\nwhen when it feels like\nyeah i'm not i'm not too sure how to put\nit towards but it it feels like i\nit feels like reality changes and i see\nmyself for what i am and what i am is\nlike someone who has failed and will\nfail\nand like every step of the way i'm doing\nthings imperfectly is like\nand a voice in my mind says ah yes you\nsee i was right all along\nwe've been through this before i know\nyou we've seen this\ni know what you're doing\nit gets even harder because it's like\nyou get stuck in this numbing space and\nthe only thing\nto like you know you have to get out of\nthat numbing space but the only thing\nwaiting there is this onslaught of pain\nand it's like\nhmm\nso you know\nthere's a part of me like there are a\nlot of questions i still want to ask but\ni i sort of feel like\nif we start asking questions about you\nknow i really liked what bee said about\nsort of the expectations that you grew\nup with and like how you were\ntaught to expect things from yourself\nyou know what the impact of being told\nthat you're capable and bright and\ntalented like\ni think that's really important to talk\nabout but i\ni also feel like we're sort of bizarrely\nkind of at the climax of the discussion\nright now because this is\nit right i feel like we have found\nthe problem do you guys feel that\ni can't really put a name to it yeah\ni i mean i can't put a name to the\nproblem at least but i mean do you guys\nfeel like\nthis is the problem like whatever we're\ntalking about right now\nis the problem yeah right so you can\ncall it like motivation you can call it\npassion you can call it whatever\nbut like there's this idea of like\ndecaying\nright that you're like stuck in this\nplace and like\nyou're like at some halfway point\nand outside there's a terrible storm and\neither you open the door and then like\nyou face the storm and then you like\nwalk for a little while and there's no\nend in sight the storm is going back so\nyou turn around and you kind of like\nyou go back to your like halfway point\nyou know the save zone like and then you\nyou save and then you're at the end\nyou refill your hp and then you just\nhang out there because there's nothing\nthere's nothing on the outside\nand then what happens is since y'all are\nsmart like every time\nyou leave and you don't get anywhere\nthen you stop wanting to leave because\nwhat's the point\nlike said said we've been here before\nwhat did you expect dumbass\ndid you expect the hurricane to stop at\nsome point\nthis is who you are this is what your\nlife has become\nwhy bother and then we get to be\nlike actually this life is pretty sweet\nlike sure i feel like a failure as a\nhuman being\nbut i've got my snug blanket pretty\ncomfortable it's all good\nto stop some noobs from time to time\nit's not that bad\nso then what happens is you guys start\nmaking this halfway point your own\nright it's not transient for you anymore\nit starts to become a home\nyou start to decorate and turn it into\nyour own place\nand then you start to feel stuck\nbecause like the longer you stay there\nlike the more comfortable it becomes\nand then there's like there's just\nsomething and then like now this is\nwhere you guys are\nwhere like you wish what would happen is\nlike some kind of dragon would show up\nand like knock down your\ntemporary shelter and then you guys\nwould have no choice\nyou know it's like the at the end of\nmetroid have you guys played metroid any\nof the metroids\nit's boomers now see it's [ __ ] sad\ni've played tons of\nright right so at the end of metroid\nthey have this really cool mechanic\nwhere like everything\nstarts falling apart you have three\nminutes to get out\nlike it happens at the end of all the\nmetroid games you have to escape like\nafter you beat the last boss you have to\nescape in time\nand like that's what you guys want you\nwant like you know flooding where you\nhave no choice where you've got to go\nlike you've just got to go\ngive me death or give me glory\nabsolutely\nbecause this sort of like weird comfort\nlimbo kind of place and there's like\nand every i like the the problem is that\nthe longer you stay\nthe stronger the hurricane outside\nbecomes because you are the hurricane\nright the the longer you stay there the\nmore you beat yourself\nup when you try to leave what did you\nexpect\ndumbass and so each time you guys\ntry it's like it's terrible because like\neach failure doesn't make you stronger\nso you know we we say that what kills\nyou what doesn't kill you makes you\nstronger right you guys heard that\nphrase\ni've heard it and strongly disagree what\nwould you say jacob\num\ni'll know it just depends on what the\nthing is\nso i'll tell you what we say in medicine\nwhich is quite bleak and we don't\nadvertise this very much\nwhat doesn't kill you makes you stronger\nor cripples you for life\nbecause that's what happens in medicine\nlike when you get someone with a motor\nvehicle accident\nthey survived and they have no legs\ngg good job right because that's really\nwhat life is like like life leaves marks\nlike trauma doesn't always result in\ntriumph like we see in the movies\nsometimes what it results in is like\ndebilitating\ncomplex ptsd in which people like suffer\nfor years\ni guess this isn't sounding very hopeful\nbut i i think it's important to\nunderstand\nyou know what you guys are facing\nbecause i'm going to try to trick you in\na second\nbecause i want you guys to like like i\nthink part of this pro part of the\nproblem here is that you guys are like\nthinking about potential\nand i think a lot of this stuff has to\ndo with like ego and identity in who you\nthink you are\nand what you think you're capable of and\nit's like not\nrespecting what your challenges are\nit's like you guys don't respect what\nyou're actually fighting against you\nthink it's easy\nyou think it's minimal and therein lies\nthe problem\nbecause like instead of treating it like\na lion you feel like you're losing to a\nmouse\neven though it's a lion and the more\nthat you recognize that it's actually a\nlion and not a mouse\nthe funny thing is like that's gonna\ncreate your best self\nright that's gonna actually recruit like\ngive me death or give me glory\nbut the problem is that you guys don't\nthink you're facing a line like you you\nyou devalue your failures\nso if you lose to something strong that\ndoesn't make you weak\nbut you guys think you're weak\ndoes that make sense like it's a truth\nof yourself that\nlike and and i think you guys have\nstarted to realize this\nright you all sort of started to figure\nthis out that like that's not really you\nbut that\nyou guys have been given this mantle\nright like you guys have been given this\nburden you're gifted things should be\neasy for you dumbass\nand so there's something that's actually\nreally devastating about gifted kids is\nthat they\nthey're not allowed to make mistakes\nso if i i'd say there's one thing that's\nholding you guys back it's that you guys\ndon't allow yourself to make a mistake\nif you're stupid and you fail is that\nokay\nit depends on the failure okay\n[ __ ] jacob with his five-head answer\noverthinking things well i mean that\nthat like so like you know there's\nsomething which you're just okay for me\nto fail\nbut like you know like i'm considering\nlike career options and you know like\nsome of them are you know more stable\nand like there's some of them are more\ncreative and you know like\nrunning out my finances and like like\nlike getting evicted is not like\nlike there's certain like i have a hard\ntime determining whether potential\nfailures are worth it or not\nare you allowed to fail jacob\nam i allowed to fail\nit's very esoteric they're like weird\nfor champ\nyeah who's judging whether we're allowed\nor not i guess it's us\nright so this is the problem\ni'm asking a yes or no question and what\nare you guys\nanswering with\ni don't know open response open response\ni'm not allowed to fail too badly\nokay right so i think the first thing\nthat you guys need\nto let yourselves do is fail\nbut you don't like you guys can't even\n[ __ ] for all your five-headedness\nyou guys can't even comprehend the\nquestion like what does that mean\nlike do you guys see how foreign the\nconcept is to you\nlike well i understand the question i\njust have a hard time answering it\nbecause\num if i'm asked are you allowed to fail\ni i guess i would um be like uh like if\ni made a mistake or if i failed i would\nbe like oh dumbass don't do it again and\nthen\ni actually move on pretty quickly after\nthat so i'm not sure that i'm\nsimilar to everyone in that regard\nokay so what i'm hearing from seoul is\nyes i feel like i know that i can fail\nbut i i still always i just\nlike what said said like it goes back\nit's like it goes into the repertoire of\nlike the\nthe however many years of [ __ ] that like\nlooks back at you and screams\nyep like right so i can but it'll come\nback and haunt me\nno no but see that's the thing is you're\nnot allowing yourself\nto fail so like like understand this so\nthe first thing is that\nstock answer but generally speaking what\nholds you back in life is you\nright like that's just how it works\ngenerally speaking and so what is it\nabout you that's holding yourself back\nand you guys have done a beautiful job\nof like describing it\nright it's like the way that you\npunish yourself in the way that you view\nyourself you make a mistake\nand then you yell at yourself for that\nand then you start to believe\nthat you're someone who makes mistakes\nyou are a [ __ ] up you are a dumb ass\nyou're incapable\nyou're not going to be able to do it why\nbother\nand now suddenly like you're you know\nyou just don't realize who you are and\nlike you're playing the game with a\ndifferent character\nand if you're playing the game with like\na different character like the character\nwho has like\ntwo scales he has two skills instead of\nlike succeed or fail he has fail or fail\nharder\nit's like you can hit button one and you\ncan fail you can hit button two and fail\nharder and like that's the\nthat's the game you guys are playing\nand then the more you play that\ncharacter the more you level up your two\nskills\nwhich are fail and fail harder\nand that's the voice right you're\nleveling up that skill and then like you\nbeat yourself\nup even more and then you tell yourself\nlike why bother you're a failure like\nyou're not able to do it see\ni told you so\nand so like you guys are operating under\nthe belief and i don't blame you for\nthis it's just like let's understand\nright and i'm gonna i'm gonna zero in on\nsad because i think\nhe's used like really good language to\ndescribe this which is like\nhe's got two choices either fail or yell\nat himself\nand so what i'm hearing from you guys is\nthat you guys aren't allowed to fail and\nthere's a damn good reason that you guys\nhave been conditioned\nlike i don't think it's a coincidence\nthat all of you guys don't allow\nyourself to fail\nand i think like maybe alcum is letting\nhimself do that a little bit and i think\njacob's sort of getting there\nbut generally speaking i think that\nthere's there's like a reason why this\nis a common pattern\ni think it goes back to like what your\nexpectations were because early on\nyou weren't allowed to fail and so you\ndidn't understand what failing\nlooked or felt like right so like if i'm\nfeeding my three-year-old and she like\ndropped something\non the floor that's something she's\nallowed to do\nlike she's allowed to make mistakes\nand it's like acceptable but i think the\nchallenge is that you guys were given i\nlove this\nthis phrase that malcolm said you guys\nwere given a mantle\nright here we have b graduated one year\nearly\nfrom an aerospace academy i don't even\nunderstand what the [ __ ] what is that\ni don't even heard of that it's just\nlike a\nlike a specialized academy so like i\nmean\nfirst of all they call it an academy\nright it's not a school i haven't gone\nto a school that's not an academy but\ncases right so what kind of\nexpectations does he put him on himself\nwhen he's like i haven't gone to a\nschool that\nisn't i haven't gone to a school that\nisn't an academy\nright and like i don't blame b for that\nbut like just think about what that does\nto the psychology of a child like i'm\nnot going to send my\nson to a [ __ ] school that's not an\nacademy with the plebs\ny'all are different y'all are gifted\nfailure's not an option\ngg too hot to handle percent\nf felt felt too targeted\nmaybe he felt shame because he went to\nschool with cinnamon again\noh so said bro\nyeah um welcome back yeah loading back\nup\nright so like i think it starts with\nwith sort of this idea that you guys\naren't\nallowed to fail and then what happens is\nyou guys kind of get into this cycle\nwhich is like every failure adds to the\nvoice that screams at you\nbut like do you guys see how like that\nvoice can only scream at you if you like\nyou're to blame or the outcome wasn't\nacceptable\ndoes that make sense or did i lose you\nguys there i don't know how to explain\nthis but like\nif you're allowed to fail there's no\nreason for the voice to yell at you\nbecause it's an acceptable outcome\nyeah can somebody yeah\ni was gonna say just like because when\nyou ask the question like are you\nallowed to fail\nuh who's who's judging whether you're\nallowed or not and\nif it's you then you just have to you\nhave to be okay with it\nyeah so i'll ask you guys so like let's\nassume for a moment it's you and we'll\nit's always you by the way\nbut we'll we'll get to you know even\nlike the identity that you show other\npeople\nlike that's still you doing the judgment\nit's that you're putting on the mask of\nother people before you judge yourself\nright yeah it's weird\nit's always you doing judging i mean\nsometimes you guys may have grown up\nwith people like and i mean\nsort of untrue too because you guys did\ngrow up with people\njudging you and then that's how you\nlearn how to judge yourself but like you\nperceive it as being them but it's not\nreally them it's you it was them at some\npoint\nbut now it's not\nright so like if we think about social\nanxiety you think\nother people are going to judge you that\nway but other people are too busy\nthinking about the way you're judging\nthem\nthey're not actually judging you but you\nput yourself\nyou put on their mask when you judge\nyourself\nso now i'll ask you so like\nwhose judgment are you guys really\nfacing\nright like think about your own life and\nlike your experience of the day to day\nfine\nand what do you say about yourself what\ndo you think about yourself\nand not always the best things sometimes\nof a dick to myself\ni know but i feel like i deserve it\nthat's it\nright and so you guys wonder why you're\nstuck\nso like\nyou know the quickest way to get rid of\nmotivation is to explain to people\nthat they don't deserve something\nbecause then they'll stop asking for it\nright if you don't think that something\nis actually a possibility for you you're\nnot going to try it because you're smart\nand i think that like when we kind of\ntalk about passion\nand motivation and energy so i think\nthese are all umbrella terms\nit's like what i need is like i would i\nwould be\ni just need that magic bullet but like\nthere aren't magic bullets like human\nbeings are complicated\nright so you guys are like like i need\nmore motivation i can't find\nmotivation whereas it's like i i don't i\nj in seoul you may be a little bit\ndifferent but\num but i think for the most part\nwhat i want you guys to really\nunderstand is that like\nit's your own judgment that creates the\nhurricane that\nkeeps you trapped where you are\nand that that hurricane like you taught\nyou are conditioned to judge yourself\nthat way so it's not in a sense it's not\nyour fault\nit's just like other people place this\nmantle upon you\nand then you've like learned how to like\nput it on every day\nand then what happens is like they're so\nso this is the real challenge is that if\nyou're\nif you're stupid you're allowed to fail\nand you can get up tomorrow and you can\ntry\nright if you like i played a a game of\ndota recently like\nagainst a pro gamer like a good pro\ngamer and boy did i get\ni mean i got crushed it was like\nlaughable\nand then after i was done i was like\nlet's play again\nright because give me glory or give me\ndeath like that's cool man\nlike all i and this is the thing is like\nthis is what i think is really awesome\nabout like our community and the way\nthat\nwe get misjudged by the world is like\nthey look at us\nand they think we're pathetic and we\nlook at ourselves and we think we're\npathetic but i don't think we're\npathetic at all i think we're actually\nawesome like we're\ngonna be wrecking shitties real soon\nhere\nright and and like what\nthe thing is but but if i if i have\nexpectations that i\nlike i am amazing\nand then i like lose a game like then\nit's so much more devastating right i\ncan't pick myself up off the mat\nand that's what you guys can't do like\nas the boat\nlike gets inches further and further\naway from the dock like you can't pick\nyourself\nup off the mat\ndoes that make sense like you can't\nqueue up again\nit's like each time you fail it doesn't\nhelp you\ngrow it like cripples you further\ny'all with me yeah yes\nand so then the question is like why is\nthat and i think it all has to do with\nthis expectation of what you're capable\nof because if you flip it on its head\nlike let's say you\nflip it and you say that all of you guys\nare\nyou know suck at life\nand you start with that and the funny\nthing is jacob is like slowly working\nhis way there\nright it's like relieving it's relieving\nwhen you start begin to realize that\nsuccess in life is not based on one stat\nthat you guys have all these other stats\nand actually despite having\none stat and you guys sort of understand\nthis intellectually but i don't think\nyou\nfeel it when you get up on a day-to-day\nbasis is that like you guys were given a\nstat\nthat was so high that you didn't have to\ndevelop these other things then you\nblame yourself for like\nnot being able to succeed when it\ndepends on more than intellect\nand i think our value our society in\ngeneral overvalues intellect because\nintellect in and of itself is an\numbrella term\nwe call kids smart even if they're\nhardworking\nit's like what we say about people right\nlike oh you're smart things should be\neasy for you and then if you start to\nstumble what is wrong with you dumbass\nthings should be easy for you\nand it's that part that keeps you guys\nstuck\ndoes that make sense yeah\nyeah yeah i just have not figured like\ni get that consciously but it's like\nsubliminally it still happens even if\ni'm consciously telling myself that\nabsolutely i've been trying to like\nclear up my house and like make it\nbetter and then like\ntwo days ago like my drain got clogged\nand like the grinder got like shorted\nand it's like\nlike not even my fault but it's like i\nwas still out for like the day just\nemotionally yeah\nright so so now you guys have a couple\nof problems\nwhich is that you all have been sitting\nat this like halfway point for so long\nthat you all have become deconditioned\nyou've rusted\nright so i want you guys to start\nthinking of yourselves in a bizarre way\nis like way worse than what you think of\nyourself\nlike i know that sounds weird i know it\nsounds weird so let me explain\nso you guys think you're way up here and\nthen you beat yourself\nup for being over here and so you kind\nof think of yourself\nin like kind of a negative way right but\nat the end of the day like\nall of this is built upon the premise\nthat you're up here\nyou guys get that you can't be a\ndisappointment without a high\nexpectation of yourself\nand so what are you what do we do huh is\nit true\nw oh yeah not true\ni'm a boomer um\nso what i want you guys to do is start\nlike lowering your expectations\nright and i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut like i think in general like i'm a\nbig fan if you guys have watched\nme before of like letting go of\nexpectations and so like really meet\nyourself where you're at\nright and like understand that like some\nof y'all are gonna be like y'all are all\nlike so the big so here's the biggest\nscam of being a gifted kid\nyou know so you guys you guys familiar\nwith like league of legends and dota\noh yeah yes yeah okay oh yeah so let me\nask you guys something gifted kid\nwhat position are they in league of\nlegends\nmid laner\nincorrect y'all are all adc's\nyou come online late disrespectful\nand this is the big thing right is we\nall assume that we should come on\nonline fast and early as gifted and\ntalented kids\nhell be skip degrade\nright so we think that like we're we're\nlike upfront powerhouses and it should\nbe easy for us\nand it's not untrue but in my experience\nyou guys come online late and when you\nhit the ground\nrunning like it's gonna be like a sight\nto see\nand you will be all of the things that\nyou think you are but in order to get\nthere you have to start by not being any\nof those things\nyou guys don't understand that like\ny'all are actually playing\na handicapped class\nit's not a gifted class y'all are\n[ __ ] handicapped\nand that's why like my my one of my\nteachers told me like a special needs i\nmean\na gifted child is a special needs child\nand i was like what are you talking\nabout and then she like\nsat down and explained to me blew my\nmind that y'all literally have needs\nthat are different from other people\nright like you guys have challenges that\nare different from other people and sure\na lot of this is shared and stuff like\nthat\nbut i genuinely do think like y'all's\nneeds in the way that you need to be\nchallenged and stuff like that and\nand that's why like the only source of\nof like success for\ngifted people is usually desperation\nbecause that creates the environment\nthat is necessary for you\nto thrive but if you just stop and think\nabout that like that's one hell of a\nhandicap right it's like\none hell of a way to min max your\ncharacter\nmy motivation is going to be purely\ndependent on my circumstances and\nwhether i'm waiting tables and failing\nout of college\nit's like some hyper-specialized like\ncharacter that has like\nplus a thousand percent damage and\nresistance towards one enemy type and\ndoes zero damage\nand has vulnerability to all the others\nthat's what you guys are playing\nand we can hear it from you right we\nheard it from jacob\nhe's like if all the stars align i can\none shot\nthis shitty\nbut otherwise i'm gonna get wrecked\nbros you guys are gifted y'all are\nhandicapped\nwonderful and honestly that was my big\nrealization\nit was like i'm not gifted\ni'm dumb and then you're playing a\ncompletely different game becomes way\nmore fun\nbecause then like you don't beat\nyourself up for your failures\nit's like if you guys play dark souls\nyeah\nokay not most people you guys know what\na deprived is\nsorry i get the deuce\nright so like like there are different\ncharacters you can be in dark souls like\nyou could be like a knight\nhave like armor and a sword and you can\nbe\nlike a mage and have like a staff and\nstuff right like pretty straightforward\nthen you could be deprived which is a\ndude with like\ntiny whities in a club just like a naked\ndude with a club like that's the way\nwe're gonna play this game\nso my first round of dark souls i was\nlike i'm going to try to be as powerful\nas possible and then i did terribly\nsecond time i played i was like i'm\ngoing to play deprived because [ __ ] yeah\ngive me a club give me a pair of undies\nand let's go [ __ ]\nand so what i'm not hearing from you\nguys is let's go [ __ ]\nright like when you when you think about\nlike applying to a job or working on\nyour resume or anything like that it's\nlike\noh my god you have to succeed like oh my\ngod you suck\noh my god you should be able to do this\nbetter\nwhy do you suck so hard you're so smart\ni hear all that stuff what i don't hear\nis like let's go [ __ ]\nlet's see what we can do\nright like if you guys start to like say\nthat about yourself\nthink that about yourself like start to\nget to know\nwho you really are because i think you\nguys are also stumbling on this idea\nthat like\nthis person that i think i am is like\nnot who i am\nthis person that like society has\nconstructed for me is like not who i am\nso who are you like you don't know yet\nso like\ntry to learn\ni feel like i've talked the most that i\nhave during any of these group\ninterviews so i'm gonna pause for a\nsecond and check in with you guys\ni have a question yeah so um generally\nuh if i'm getting this right like our\nproblem is that our or one of our\nproblems is that like uh we're setting\nour expectations too high and they\nshould be lowered because we're not\nwe think we're up here but we're\nactually down here or something like\nthat yep how do we\nhow do we know where to lower our\nexpectations to how can we\npossibly be objective about where they\nshould land you don't\nneed to be objective do we just start at\nrock bottom\nor not like rock bottom sure as low as\nyou can go okay\nalso uh i thought i thought earlier you\nwere saying um\nthat like with the analogy of fighting a\nmouse\nuh or like we think we're fighting a\nmouse but it's actually a line\ni thought you were going to go down the\nroute of like we'll raise the\nraise the level of your problem like say\nthat it's\nor realize that it's a bigger problem\nthan it actually is [ __ ] you and your\nfive heads\nthe result is the same right whether i\ntransform a\nmouse into a lion or i turn myself\ninto a hobbit like the result is the\nsame\nright right but one i have to like i\nhave to ruin my ego and that's really\nhard you know\nyeah so that's that's the that's the\nother thing which is holding you guys\nback\nlike i don't buy for a second that alcom\npart of the reason he's joining the\nmilitary\nis because he gets to be the person that\nhe always wanted to be\nthere is no way that you guys being as\nfive-head as you all are\non some subconscious level alchem\nrealizes that when he mentions military\neveryone is gonna admire him i'm not\nsaying it's a bad decision i'm not\nsaying that it's\nisn't genuine but i think that like\nthere's a reason why he's joining the\nmilitary after failing out of college\ninstead of before\nright and i'm not saying i really really\ndo i'm not trying to no yeah absolutely\nyou're on the money on that one i think\nyep\nit's a it's [ __ ] ego because i i know\nbecause i felt this like i see\nmyself in all of you to begin with but\nespecially\nthat's why i went to india and i was\nlike i'm gonna become a monk\nbecause then i'll be better in all all\nyou noobs\nso rather than be stupid even though\ni've told i i was smart and i skipped a\ngrade\ni remember like walking into my first\ngrade class but\nin first grade i walked into the\nclassroom on the first day\nand then the teacher like gave us a\nworksheet and i did it in five minutes i\nhanded to her and i was like can i have\nthe next one\nthen she gave me the next one i did that\none in five minutes and then she gave me\nlike\nthe one from like two months from now\nand i did that one and then she gave me\nthe next one the next one i was like oh\nand then they moved me to the second\ngrade\nand like back then i didn't have an ego\nbut like sure like as i grew up i was\nlike oh yeah i'm smarter than everyone\nelse\nand so i know what it's like to not live\nup to the expectations that you set for\nyourself\nand choose an alternate path that gives\nyou a sense of self\nself worth i think it's good i think you\nshould do it bro it sounds like a good\ndecision and i think you'll\nyou know i'm not trying to but i think\nall of you guys have to wrestle with ego\nwith identity and there are weird\nversions of it\nright like like said your ego\nis kind of warped but like you still\nthink very\nstrongly about who you are and that\nneeds to be done away with\nbecause you aren't who you think you are\noh how do i begin to do that\ngood question one that i don't know if i\nhave an answer\nso so what what i've gotten so far like\nif i'm putting this into like coding\nit's like\nlike um if expectation too high\nlower expectation forehead yes that's\nthat's the maneuver\nor if expectation like so it\nlike be sort of pointed out there are\ntwo sides of the equation right there's\nthe way that you rate yourself\nand there's the way that you rate your\nproblem\nand you can either respect so this this\nis where like i love that you guys said\nlike i can't even do the most\nbasic thing and so then what you\nconclude is if i can't do the most basic\nthing\ni must be really dumb\nbut what y'all need to understand is\nthat most basic thing is the most\ndifficult thing\nthat's not a level one problem that's a\nlevel 99 problem\nand there are reasons for that the\nsimplest of which is that you begin to\nrealize that actually the big and\ndesperate things are easy to do\nit's the little things that are hard to\ndo it's the things that are irrelevant\nthat are the most difficult to do\nit's easy to eat when you're hungry it's\nhard to eat when you're hungry when\nyou're not hungry\nit's easy to go to the bathroom when you\nneed to pee it's harder to go to the\nbathroom when you need to be\nit's easier to help someone when they\nneed your help\nit's harder to help someone when they\ndon't\nright so desperation is i get that you\nguys long for it but like what y'all\nneed to understand is that\neach of these little battles that you\nguys are choosing to fight are actually\nnot easy battles they're very hard\nlike if you just think about it\nlogically like the fewer reasons there\nare to do something the harder it is to\ndo them\nand you guys have created like let's\ntake b for example like he doesn't have\na reason to leave the comfort of his\nhome\nand so leaving the comfort of his home\nisn't easy it's incredibly hard\nso you need to respect the problems that\nyou guys face\ninstead of disrespecting them and\nthereby like shaming yourself\nif that sort of makes sense yeah\nso how do i tell the difference between\nme you know\nsetting my expectations lower in a\nhealthy way and\nme saying well i guess this is a really\nhard problem let's run away and play\nvideo games for a week\nso how do i differentiate between\nlowering my expectations in a healthy\nway and just using it as a way to\nignore the problem and also i think like\nself-deprecating can kind of come eat\nlike if you like\nif you're thinking about like lowering\nyourself like it's it's i mean\nlike i'm i'm like i can be pretty doomer\nsometimes like pretty like down in the\ndumps and so i think it's easier for me\nto like\nsometimes just be like i suck but like\nmy ego doesn't really change i don't\nreally lower the bar i'm just kind of\nlike self-deprecating yeah so so there's\na difference between\nhaving an expectation of yourself and\nnot living up to it\nand lowering the expectation of yourself\ndo you guys understand you all do the\nfirst one y'all don't do the second one\nand the problem is that despite multiple\nfailures\nyour bar of potential never changes\nwhat you're capable of never changes\nand therefore each failure hurts more\nand more and more\nso i'm sorry said you had a question can\nyou ask it again\nreally good question by the way so\nwhat's the difference between\num setting that you know setting my\nexpectations lower\nor you know setting the problem higher\nin a healthy way like you're describing\nand just using that as uh an excuse to\nrun away from the problem entirely\ni don't understand how those two are\nlike on opposite like\nhow does how does running away enter the\nequation\noh so i could i could say oh man this\nthis is\nthis is indeed like way too hard for me\ni guess i'll\ni guess it's an acceptable outcome for\nme to just stay in my room for\nthe next few years and play video games\ni see so if you lower your expectations\nand you and failure is to be expected\nthen it's okay to not try\nyes what's staving off hopelessness\nuh yeah\ngood questions let me think about this\nso staving off hopelessness is a\nseparate issue\nwell i guess it's not actually i guess\nthat is the same question\nso let me start by saying said that's\nwhat you already do\nright so like already you guys have a\nthere's no point in trying because\nfailure is inevitable and here's okay\nthis is tricky\nit depends on where you are in time\nokay so it's it's about being i know\nthis sounds weird but like\nif you guys really want to know the\nanswer and y'all are [ __ ] being five\nheads fine\nbecause i wanna doozy you guys wanna\ngive me a hard question i'll give you\nguys a hard answer okay\nso hopelessness is your mind in the past\nthe\npresent or the future when you are\nhopeless\nin the future future good\nnext question is your mind in the past\nthe present or the future when you have\nhope\npresent my experience the present\n[ __ ] weird right who thinks future\ni do i think it would be talk it out\namongst yourselves\nbecause if you have hope um you\nyou think that there is something that\nwill happen\nthat is that what hope is that's not\nwhat hope is\nokay let's define hope if i think\nsomething will happen\nwhat's the word we use for that are you\npredicting\ncertainty yeah certainty okay so\nyou guys are saying certainty or predict\ni'm gonna toss out\nwildword you guys may not be familiar\nwith it i'm gonna toss out expectation\nokay so let's go back to\num bees so\ntell us now i hope there's hope in the\npast present future\nwhat do you think where are you\nwhen you hope oh i mean i well i'm in\nthe present\ni hope but right\nso this is really confusing because\nhopelessness is about the future hope is\nabout the present\nhopelessness is about an outcome or the\ninability to attain an outcome\nhope is acknowledging that we don't know\nwhether the outcome is there or not but\ni\ni want it so you're actually in the\npresent you're in the present looking\nforward\nhopelessness is about the future looking\nback\nand if you really tunnel down that's\nwhere you guys\nlive right so when like said wakes up in\nthe morning and is like let me apply for\na job\nhis mind isn't thinking about the\npresent his mind is thinking about the\nfuture\nfailure is inevitable there's no point\nin trying it is a mind that is in the\nfuture\nthat's what engenders hopelessness\nwhy bother we're gonna screw up anyway\nit's too hard\nthe common element here is a mind in the\nfuture\nnow the real problem the real reason you\nguys suffer from this is because the\nmore intelligent you are\nthe more the deeper into the future your\nmind can go\nand that's what really screws you guys\nright so your predictive capability\nincreases\nneuroticism or anxiety increases\ngenerally speaking with iq\ni think actually that's not true\nwell yeah that's not technical the way i\nphrased it\ni will say this anxiety\nis worse in people who are smart\ncognitive anxiety anyway\ndoes that answer your question about\nhopelessness or\nno actually i guess i haven't answered\nyet yet\nso i just started with this right so\nlike okay who here still thinks that\nhope is about the future\nor that your mind is in the future when\nyou are hoping\nokay i still think that but i i i'll\nthis will be like where i rewind the\nvideo and\nokay so let me let me explain it again\nokay so for those of you who think that\nhope is in the present help\nhelp help us understand what your\nperspective is\ni mean to me hope is like an\nexperiential thing it's also a religious\nthing but it's like\ni don't know i i only think it could be\nin the present because it's just like an\nexperience\nstrangely enough yeah like it's\nsomething you feel like it's something\nyou\ngo through yeah you experience hope\nyou're like thinking about the future\nlike the subject is the future and what\ncould happen in it but like the\nexperience or the feelings you have that\ncome along with hope happen in the\nmoment\ni is i think how i would describe it i\nhope it's like a feeling\nyeah but playing devil's advocate or\npeace advocate you could also say the\nsame about hopelessness i think\nyeah like it's thoughts about the future\nbut it's\nin the present experience in the\npresence oh but um the difference i feel\nlike is\nwith hopelessness you well when you're\nhopeless you're\nlike almost certain or you have an\nexpectation even if it's not like a\ncorrect one that um\neverything's just gonna so turn to [ __ ]\nthis is this is\nnot certain so b this is how i'd explain\nit\nhope is you standing in the present and\nlooking towards the future\nhopeless is you standing in the future\nand looking towards the present\nokay i'll have to think about it more\nthat's fine okay right so so if you guys\nare talking about like you know how to\nmanage\nthis i think the the biggest thing is to\nbe present\nfocused because what holds you guys back\nis like\na certainty or expectation of the future\nthat precludes action in the present\nlike your mind is literally making a\nrisk reward\ncost benefit analysis and your\nmotivation so this is literally how your\nwork\nyour mind works okay so it's kind of\nconfusing\nbut you guys have this thing so we have\nokay i'm gonna explain some neuroscience\nokay\nso since you all want to be five head\nokay so we have\nwe have two systems in our mind that are\nin our brain that tend to\nlike people get confused about because\neveryone thinks about\nmotivation and reward okay so when we\nthink about like\nmotivation we think about the reward\ncircuitry of the brain and we think\nabout dopamine y'all are familiar with\nthis stuff\nlike most people are like amateur\nneuroscientists\nso like the idea is that we have a\nreward structure and that dopamine is\nthe neurotransmitter that like\nsupports our reward structure and that\nwhen we\nget a reward it reinforces the behavior\nand motivates us to act\nright familiar with this okay\nso we have a couple of different so the\nreward structure\nthe risk benefit part of the brain is\nactually not dopamine\nit's actually a cannabinoid structure so\nthere's a different part of our brain\nthat does our risk benefit analysis\nand we actually understand this because\npeople in schizophrenia or in some kinds\nof neurodegenerative disorders\nhave something called abulia or a\nmotivation\nand the really interesting thing is that\nthe people who are a bulic are a\nmotivational\ntheir problem isn't necessarily in the\ndopamine reward circuitry which is what\nwe think of it's actually in like this\nrisk benefit i mean uh yeah risk benefit\nsort of\ncost like analysis that you constantly\nis active in your brain\nthat's the problem that you guys have\nit's not about\na lack of reward it's like the\ncalculation that you all perform\nabout whether an action is worth taking\nit's actually a separate circuit of the\nbrain and right now what happens is you\nguys\nmake a calculation about the utility of\nyour action\nand then you conclude that it's not\nworth it to do\nso it's not that you guys lack energy\nand in fact you guys aren't you don't\nguys don't even lack motivation\ntechnically\nwhat's happening is your brain is\nmotivating you to not act\ndoes that make sense like if we think\nabout said what set is saying is that\nthere's no point in me leaving the\nhalfway point because\nthere's nothing good down the road\nand so it's a risk benefit analysis that\nmotivates you to inaction\nand this is why like all these like\n[ __ ] videos on motivation don't help\npeople because you guys don't\nyou don't lack motivation what you guys\nneed to understand is that you're\nmotivated to stay put\nyou don't lack motivation to move\nforward different\nso then the question okay questions\nabout that clarifications\nall good with me okay\ni'm afraid that i may have bombarded you\nguys with too much tangential\ninformation without actually answering\nyour question\ni mean it's a complicated question so\nsometimes you have to go into tangents\nto yeah\nokay so let me try to like re-explain\nokay\nso um i'm gonna go back to sed's\nquestion which is like how do i\nif i lower my expectations so low\nthen what i'll do is make a prediction\nthat i'm gonna fail anyway so there's no\npoint in trying because i suck so hard\nat life\nright yeah so so the funny thing is\nthat's\nalready what scent does so he's making\nit sound like it's a different thing but\nit's actually the same damn thing\nbecause right now he already does a risk\nbenefit analysis and chooses an action\nyou guys see that whether you think high\nof yourself or you think low of yourself\nhe's coming to the same damn conclusion\neven though i'm telling you guys to come\nfrom a different starting place\ndoes that make sense y'all really got to\nfollow me there\nthat at the end of the day he's saying\ni'm going to fail anyway there's no\npoint in action so that's why i sort of\ntalk about this cannabinoid\nrisk benefit structure because it's the\nsame part of his brain that is still\nrunning the show so he's not actually\nadopting my premise\nokay so and i'll get to that in a second\nso\nthen sen's next question is then how do\ni adopt your premise right said\nyou got me okay i i get that so like\nwe're walking you to that\nso what i want you guys to still notice\nis that as long as the risk\nreward structure is\ndetermining whether you act or don't act\nyou will be motivated towards an action\ngot it so now let me ask you guys a\nquestion okay this is a hard one\nlet's go [ __ ] is that present\nthinking or future thinking\npresent absolutely\nbut that's like literally not the\nthought that you have right like\nliterally in your mind you guys don't\nhave the present thought you have the\nfuture thought\nthere's no point present thinking or\nfuture thinking\nfuture thing you're thinking absolutely\nso some of this so now the question is\nokay what do we do\nabout it right so some of this literally\nis controlling your mind because i want\nyou guys to understand that\nyou can cultivate particular kinds of\nthoughts\nokay now we're really going on a tangent\nbut i want you guys to\nunderstand this for a moment that your\nmind\ngets conditioned what is it that\nconditions your mind\nour environment what impact is our\nexperience\nokay so like how does our enviro so\nthere's the environment right so like\nbut environment itself doesn't do any\nconditioning\nwhen something happens to you you learn\nabout like\nor you learn like you you interpret some\nsort of meaning from something happening\nto you that caused some sort of effect\nand that\nchanges how you think exactly right so\nit's the environment's\neffect on you like it's not literally\nthe environment the environment\nhas to impact you there's like a there's\na there's like\nthe outside and the inside so for\nexample like if i have ear plugs on and\nsomeone is talking to me\neven though the environment is the same\nlike whether i have ear plugs in or out\nthe environment is not reaching me does\nthat make sense\nso let's like think a little bit about\nlike you know if you were raised like\nhow have you guys been conditioned\nyou're gifted so literally what happens\nis this like\nstimuli from the outside create certain\nthought patterns\nand then you guys have beliefs about\nyourself and those beliefs\nlive in your subconscious and generate\nthoughts\nso if we think about a phobia for\nexample like let's say i have a phobia\nof snakes because i got bit by a snake\nwhen i was a kid\nhow does that work like literally in the\nway that like how does that work\nso i get bit by a snake it generates an\nexperience the experience lives in my\nsubconscious\nand then that subconscious experience is\na thought generator\nwhich then like spawns it's like a\nportal and it's like spawning\ncertain thoughts you guys get that\nso now the question is okay if i want to\nbe present focused instead of future\nfocused\nhow do i spawn present focused thoughts\nis that a good question that y'all are\ninterested in yeah yes\nyes how do i change from there's no\npoint to let's go\n[ __ ] and\npart of that literally is that you can\ncondition your own mind by cultivating a\nparticular kind of thought\nright so what we can say is that if i if\nyou guys like for example\nall live in a house and i show up every\nday and i gass you all up\ni'm like believe in yourself man you can\ndo it bro\nthat's going to create a different kind\nof conditioning right because like\nthe reason you guys don't believe in\nyourself now is because you've been\nconditioned to believe that you're a\nfailure\nbut at the end of the day what i want\nyou guys to realize is that whether i'm\nthere or not there the operative thing\nis that what sinks in so if i show up\nand i'm gassing you guys up but i'm\ngujarati\nokay\nand so like it's what enters your mind\nthat's important do y'all\nget that yeah\nand so then comes the key thing which is\nthe cultivation of your own\nthoughts and this is what really holds\nyou guys back\nbecause i've been saying all along this\nis basically the same thing that the\nhurricane outside is created by you\nit's the self-conditioning that gets\nimposed every day when you wake up and\nyou think particular thoughts about\nyourself\nthese neurons literally form channels in\nyour brain that are connections\nand start firing more commonly so it's\nkind of like a game trail like if i have\na field of grass\nand then i run across it the grass gets\nput down a little bit\nand then like a deer walks by and it's\nlike oh there's like there's a path\nthat's a little bit easier to walk\nacross\nand then the deer goes down that and the\ngrass gets trampled the grass gets\ntrampled and the grass gets trampled\nyour brain literally works the same way\nthat's literally the mechanism of\nlearning\nright so like when i when we think about\nmemorization it's like we're running\nthat game trail\nwe're flattening that grass and then you\nknow something and it becomes\ninstinctive\nso the problem is that y'all's neurons\nhave\nbeen condit and that's what we call\nconditioning so your neurons have like\ncultivated a particular thought pattern\nand so literally what you need to do is\ncultivate a different one\nand so how does that work that's because\nyou guys ultimately have some control\nover your mind\nright so i know this also gets weird but\nthere's the true self and then there's\nmental activity\nwhich are separate so there's\nconsciousness\nand there's thinking and we'll get to\nthat in a second when i teach you guys\nhow to meditate\nso what y'all need to do is like\nliterally in a moment in time\nyou can change your thought with intense\nwillpower\nand a mana bar that's going to be\ndepleted every time you do it\nbut you're laying down a new game trail\nso it's gonna be exhausting so like you\nguys are literally gonna be faced with a\ntask\nand you're gonna say there's no point\nand the question is in that moment\ncan you tell yourself let's go [ __ ]\nand now you guys have to be careful\nbecause\nyou're still gonna fail and now we get\nto\nyou have to allow yourself to fail you\nhave to be patient with yourself\nunderstand that a tiny little mouse has\nrun through the grass\nwhen you say let's go [ __ ] and then\ntomorrow comes and there's like there's\nlike a\nsuper highway which is i have so much\npotential and i suck at life\nand then there's this tiny little game\ntrail which a mouse has gone down\nand then it's like hey let's do a few\npush-ups today ah [ __ ] it i'm never\ngonna be in shape\nlet's go [ __ ]\nand then it's a rabbit and then it's a\ndeer and this is how\nchange happens and we see that process\ngoing on with jacob\nright like he's been in the [ __ ] for\na while but he's like getting some kind\nof relief and acceptance\nand i'd guess that that's like that's\nnot something that like he wakes up and\nhe's like\nah it's like i'm accepting where i am\nit's like it's a slog\nright like it's a slog and that's why\nyou guys have to be patient with\nyourselves and you have to give yourself\ntime to change and you have to\nunderstand that that\ny'all are you know undoing anywhere\nbetween 18 and 20 some odd years of\nconditioning\nand that the neurons in your in your\nbrain have have taught you to believe\nthis thing about yourself but this is\nthe other really important thing to\nunderstand\nis to have the revelation that this is\nnot\ntruth i don't know if you guys get this\nyou guys have\nthoughts about yourself right\nare those thoughts true\nmaybe not exactly true mostly\nno so now i'm going to ask y'all because\ny'all are gifted and talented\nare thoughts accurate representations of\nreality no\nno sometimes\nright\nlike if they were [ __ ] unicorns baby\nso the first thing that like another\nthing that you need to understand is\nthat you think all these things about\nyou but there's just thoughts like what\ntruth is there in the thought i had a\nthought today that i was president of\nthe united states\ni had a thought today that\ncd projekt red mailed me cds\nthat have cyberpunk on them i can have\nlike thoughts just the [ __ ] thoughts\nthey have no bearing in real like real\nliterally like they have like no bearing\nin reality\nyeah i know you guys think they have\nsome bearing in reality that's a\nconversation for a different day\nexperience has a bearing in reality\nthoughts don't\nso it's just thoughts that you can\ncultivate thoughts\nthat the cultivation of thoughts is like\na slow process\nand then along the way you if you are\nexpecting results\nthen you're going to be future focused\nand you will not\ncontinue the cultivation of thoughts\ndoes that make sense\nand furthermore so the reason i use the\nword cultivation\nwhat is cultivation\nyou sow the seeds and then come back for\nthem later absolutely\nand what if there's nothing there did\nyou\ndid you cultivate incorrectly\nyes no maybe incorrect\nright so that that's the whole point is\ncultivation\nimplies it's not creation\nthere's a difference between creating\nand cultivating what's the difference\nlike it takes time to cultivate\nsomething\ncreative and it's not cultivating you\nabsolutely so it's about certainty right\nlike creation is something i have\ncontrol over\ncultivating is something that i don't so\ni use some of this language like\nvery carefully because this language\nlike there's a correlation between hope\nand cultivation you guys get that like\nif you cultivate a plate like if i plant\na seed\nlike i hope it's gonna grow but that's\nthe most that i can do is hope\nand the more you start living present\nfocus the more you say to yourself let's\ngo [ __ ] something magical will happen\nwhich is that hope will start to be born\nand the reason that hope will be born is\nbecause you are creating\nthe circumstance which which hope\nrequires to be born\nwhich is to have a mind in the present\nhopelessness is\nis a child of the future like by\ndefinition you cannot be hopeless unless\nyou are thinking about the future\nif the focus of your mind is on the\nfuture you can be hopeless\nif i'm eating a sandwich\nand it's like tasty and i'm just eating\nit can i be hopeless\nnot really it's like literally\nimpossible i want you guys to understand\nthis\nit is literally impossible to be\nhopeless if you were eating a sandwich\nas long as your mind is on the sandwich\nyou're like damn this is a delicious\nsandwich it can be a disgusting sandwich\nbut so so here's where the hopelessness\ncomes in if you start to think yourself\nman i have to finish this sandwich\nhopelessness boom\nyou guys see that god this sandwich is\n[ __ ] disgusting\nno hopelessness i have to finish it\n[ __ ] hopelessness\nso how do you be hopeful if you lower\nexpectations how do you fight against\nthe idea of not needing to do it anymore\nyou just stick your [ __ ] mind in the\npresent as best as you can let's go\n[ __ ] you try to tell yourself that\nthird thing and we'll get to this now is\nthat like you can start there are other\nthings you can do\nthird thing is that you can train your\nmind to be in the presence so that's\nlike\nlike you know it's like focusing your\nmind on the present\nis just like focusing your gaze it's\nsomething you it's a skill that can be\nacquired\nand meditation is basically the most\ndirect skill that we use\nto train your mind to be in the present\ndo you guys feel hopeless when you're\nplaying a video game\nthat's a good question\nwhat if i'm thinking about the game\nexactly\ni'm thinking about the results of the\ngame exactly so you guys know this like\nyou guys know this [ __ ] man\nwhen you're playing a league of legends\ngame and i you look at your draft\ndo you feel hopeless or not because if\nyou're if you're like if you're like if\nyou're thinking about how the game is\ngoing to play out ah there comes the\nhopelessness\nyou guys see that and then there are\ntimes where you're like it's an\neven game and you're not thinking you're\nlike okay let's do it like there's a\nfive-on-five engagement\naround baron and like in that moment\nyou're not\nlike that's what's fun right and like\nthat's why it serves as an escape\nbecause video games put your mind in the\npresent\nthat's why they're fun and video games\ncause you to suffer\nand that's when you're thinking about\nthe future in the video game\nit's like a microcosm for reality which\nis wild i love it so you can even track\nyour like enjoyment of games and you'll\nsee that like when your mind is in the\npresent\nyou'll be having fun\ni have a question yeah so\ni feel like well i mean every decision\nmade is um\nfor like some outcome in the future\nright\nhow do you like how do you decide to do\nthings\nand not think about the future like you\ndo you\napply to college because you have the\nexpectation that in four years you're\ngonna graduate with a degree\nhow do you keep your mind in the present\nalways or like\nhow do you consider what you should do\nin the future\ngood question unfortunately the answer\nis roughly the same but i'll explain it\nin a different way\nso you can consider the future\nbut it's about expectation versus like\nhope right so like i can say so like\nlet's just take like a\nlike so i'm going to talk about dota for\nexample because i don't know league that\nwell\nso there's a hero dota called pudge\nanyone know pudges\npunch is like a fat guy that hooks\nthings okay and like pudge is the kind\nof hero that like\nhas a skill shot which there are fewer\nof in donut and then like the pudge is\nlike\nthe the pick that ruins your games\nbecause you get a bad punch and then\nhe's like useless like he can't do\nanything except for hook people and then\noccasionally on the other team you'll\nget a good punch and he's hooking the\n[ __ ] out of you guys and pulling you\nguys out of position it's like is the\nkind of\ngay hero that just ruins your games\nbecause the enemy has a good one you've\ngot a bad one\nokay so like when you play a game of\ndota like\nyou can think about trying to win or you\ncan say to yourself\nlet's go [ __ ] right it's not really\nabout\nwinning or losing it's not like we're\ngonna draft to win it's like\nlet's pick this [ __ ] meme combo and\nwreck these shitties\nand like when you play the game like\nthat it becomes more fun\nlike sure you have a calculation\nsomewhere in your mind about like what\nthe game is going to look like\nbut that's not where you sit you don't\nsit in the future you sit in the present\nand you're looking forward\ndoes that make sense so our outlook on\nthe future\nshould be that we hope things go a\ncertain way\nand then not really like put too much\npressure to\nhave them go a certain way and just\nthink about what we're doing now\nexactly so focus on action\nright like if the question isn't are we\ngonna wreck these shitties\nthe question is let's try to wreck these\nshitties like how do we wreck this [ __ ]\nlet's do it go for it and that's like\nthat's literally how like so\nyou guys understand this like if you\nplay a game like that if you play a game\nto have fun like let's pick some meme\ncombo\nand stomp these noobs and then even if\nyou guys get crushed you're like let's\ndo it again\nright and like literally that's what\nbuddha discovered about life\nis there two ways to live life\nand when you start living life like\nyou're a meme lord\nlike it becomes fun and blissful\nbecause every day it's like let's see\nlike what we're eating for lunch oh god\nthis sandwich is awful\nlet's see if we get wrecked tomorrow by\nanother awful sandwich\nlulz that's literally what enlightenment\nis\nit's to treat good actions and bad\nactions in equanimity\nright because you guys know this that\nlike even if you get\ntrolled really really hard you can still\nappreciate it\nright and like that's it's silly but\nlike that's actually like the big thing\nlike\nthat's what they discovered that buddha\nwas like the ultimate\nmeme lord and he was realized he\nrealized that if you live your life like\na meme like you're gonna\nthere's nothing can touch you and you'll\nbe blissful irrespective of what happens\nso you can think about the future and\nthis gets also into like ambition and\ndetachment which maybe we can do a video\non one day\nbut a lot of people like ask me like if\ni become detached from the outcome of my\nactions\nhow do i act because usually it's\nambition that motivates me\nand ambition is based on outcomes\nand the short answer is try it you'll be\namazed\nbecause what you'll realize is that like\nyour actions don't have to be motivated\nby ambition they can be emoted\nmotivated by like excitement and\ncuriosity\nand all kinds of other stuff and just an\nappreciation for doing what you're doing\nright and like the people who are\nhappiest are the ones that enjoy their\nwork\nbecause they're not thinking about it\nlike i work with a bunch of investment\nbankers\nand they hate their job and they like\ndo it for the money like that's no way\nto live i mean\nit is a way to live it's a comfortable\nway to live but\nand so like you can enjoy an action in\nand of itself\nif you just devote yourself to the\naction\nturning into a lecture other questions\num so i think we've like kind of\nuh we've touched like around it but like\nuh so\nwhen uh i i think like for\nfor probably a lot of people in general\nbut but definitely for gifted kids we\nkind of put down this\nthis like predetermined quest line of\nyou're going to do you're going to take\nthese classes in elementary school\nthey're going to take like honors\nclasses in middle school and then ap or\nyou're going to go to a collegiate high\nschool or something like that\num and then maybe like\nmore if you're like an immigrant kid\nyou're probably going to get pushed on\nanother questline of\nlawyer doctor engineer um but\nif you're not or once you're past that\nhow do you\nstart making choices um when you've\nnever made any\nwhat paralyzes you from making a choice\nb\nthe future yeah there you go\nvery good\nso can you guys turn that into an answer\ni see that you've connected those two\ndots but i think it's hard to turn that\ninto an answer\nso like do you guys have a sense\nright so you just have to free yourself\nfrom consequences\nso it's like it's the difference between\nstudying for an a and studying to\nunderstand the material\nlike why are you guys studying\nand the more that you devote yourself to\nlike learning the material this is like\na big scam\nin life right is that like\nhow let me think about how to say this\nwe devalue the thing that leads to the\nresult\nand instead we value the result\nas a proxy to the thing\nright so like what we really care about\nis like learning\nlike if you get hired for a job as an\nengineer\nwhat we care about is that you know you\nunderstand engineering\nbut what society conditions us to place\nvalue on\nis great because grades are a proxy for\nknowledge\nand so the more that we get wrapped up\nin like this\nfalse thing it's just like all ego and\ncomparison\nit's not actually about knowledge at all\nand so the more that you kind of focus\non the thing itself like how do you act\nhow do you choose\nyou've been conditioned i get you be\nlike i was conditioned too\nand despite my best attempts i still\nwound up as a doctor\nright and like the reason i'm a good\ndoctor is because i\ndidn't want to be a doctor and then like\nat the age of like 25 i was like oh [ __ ]\nmaybe i actually want to be actually i\ndon't even want to be a doctor when i\nwent to med school\nto tell you guys the truth that's\nprobably why i'm doing a good job\nbecause i didn't\ncare about it like i became a doctor\nbecause my teachers were like\ngo get a doctoral degree and i was like\neh\nokay and oddly enough it's like doing it\nfor no reason so i was like\nyou know or doing it for my own it\nwasn't about the prestige or anything\nlike that it was just like\ni have to do this if i want to take my\nvows and become a monk so okay\ni guess i'll do that and then like i\nfailed right so i got rejected from like\n130\n20 medical schools a lot and then like\neach of those failures it doesn't matter\nbecause like i'm not going to really be\na doctor anyway i'm just like doing this\nfor the sake of like doing it so that my\nteachers can be happy whatever\nmaybe there's an outcome somewhere in\nthere but i think i train myself to be\nlike present focused it's like okay\nyou get 40 rejections\nlike none of those rejections really\ninfluence like whether i apply the 41st\ntime\ni can take that information i can\nintegrate it i can get feedback\nbut i'm still going to apply again like\nyou can wipe a thousand times on a boss\nand you can still like go in the next\nday and like try to wipe again\nright you guys have played dark souls\nyou understand what that's like\nlike it's very frustrating that you're\ngonna wipe over and over and over again\nbut like\nthat's not the point it's not like you\ndon't you don't go into a boss in dark\nsouls and expect it down at the first\ntime\nor a wow rate for that matter or ff14\nyou know that wiping is part of the\nprocess but each time you wipe\nif it doesn't [ __ ] you it makes you\nstronger\nright each time you wipe what i want you\nguys to understand is that like\neach failure in your life is gaining xp\nand so it's about learning not about\nperformance\nand that's why you guys are adcs\nso what happened in my case is like i\nwas a no one for a while\nand then i was an average person and now\nlike people think i'm\nsomeone\ni'm no different from you guys i'm like\nprobably just about where y'all were\nwhen y'all are y'alls age\nlike we're no different the thing is\nsociety\nlooks at me differently but like that's\nbecause society is dumb\nand you guys look at me differently\nbecause that's y'all y'all are dumb too\nseriously thank you because you guys\nadopt the conditioning of society which\ni don't blame you for but let's not call\nit smart\nbecause capability to you guys thus far\nhas been a burden\nright it's a potential let me ask you\nguys this where is potential in the\npresent or in the future\nthe future there we go\nyou guys are trapped in the future\nthere's\nliterally show me potential\nwhat is potential in the universe\nit doesn't exist absolutely there is\njust what is\nand so if there's no potential how can\nyou be failures\nseriously if any of you guys can answer\nthat question\ni will stop streaming\nbecause if i'm wrong about this like\nthis is the foundation upon which\nall of what i all the work that i do is\nbuilt\nwell i guess the only weird thing is\nlike by by that logic\nuh no one can ever be a failure i guess\nthat is correct\nokay\ncan you fail at stuff sure can i fail\ncan i get an f on a test\nabsolutely i've done it before trust me\nbut like this is the concept of advaith\nvedanta\nnon-dualism so is there a good sandwich\nor a bad sandwich\nthere is just sandwich\nconvince me otherwise right so the good\nor the bad is what\nwe apply to it there's just a sandwich\nis it blasphemy or delicious depends on\nwhether it's a blt and you're muslim\nlike you know like the the blt is the\nblt\nand like where we end up with it is like\nwildly different based on some [ __ ] in\nhere\nand you guys think you're failures\nbecause of some [ __ ] in here you guys\naren't failures\nthere's no such thing you guys are just\nwhere you are on your journey\nlike this is the only place you can be\nhow can you uh that's silly\ni could have been in a different place\nif i had done things like how is that\nlike show me anyone who's been in a\ndifferent place because they did\nanything differently\nreality is like one thing bros at least\nuntil we prove like alternate universes\nyou guys start like dimensional shifting\nto like other places like then i'll\neat my words\nbut until that [ __ ] is proven and maybe\none of y'all gifted and talented\naerospace academy kids will discover\nthis\nyou know so like that whole concept of\ny'all being a failure is just wrong man\nno such thing\nenough for today\nyeah i'm good awesome yeah\ni learned that buddha is a meme lord\nyes one of the greatest tricks he's ever\npulled on the world is convincing people\nthat he was something special\nyou guys know this like i'll leave you\nguys with one last story you guys know\nwhat zen masters do when they\nwhen they uh attain enlightenment the\nfirst thing that they do\nlaugh what because literally what this\nzen tradition teaches you is that none\nof it is necessary\nnone of the meditation is necessary it's\nall scam that's literally what zen\nbuddhism teaches\nbecause we're all already enlightened\nand it's all a big meme like i kid you\nguys not like if you go and study\nbuddhism that is what they will tell you\nthere's no such thing as like not being\nenlightened we're all enlightened anyway\nand it's like all just a scam\nif people have you know studied with\nthis they'll understand that but it's\nbizarre they even say they're meme words\nlike buddha was the original meeblor\nit's like the original troll\ni'm gonna teach you guys a bunch of\nstuff that's really hard that you never\nneeded anyway\nand then the his story of enlightenment\nyou guys know this\nso he likes like meditates for a really\nlong time and he does all these really\nharsh systems of meditation\nhe's like [ __ ] it i'm done then he goes\nand he sits under the tree he's like\n[ __ ] this [ __ ] and then he becomes\nenlightened\nit's when he abandons everything that he\ngains his enlightenment\nit's like this is all dumb\nanyway a lot of good stories\nokay so we've been at\nuh um i i do have one thing\nyeah that so like\nthe idea of like buddhist teaching is to\nlike not take anything too seriously\nuh and like the thing that you're kind\nof telling us is like something\nthe same like you know live in the\npresent you know\nuh like what about like commitments\nand like not necessarily commitments to\nlike like um\ni don't know like if you have like a\nfamily like have kids and like you can't\nalways\nyou can't always be like you know [ __ ]\nit we ball\nsometimes you got to be like okay like i\nneed to like think about the future of\nmy kid and like that can be\nyou know worrisome is that like a\nhealthy worry\ngood question so first of all buddhism\nnever says don't take things seriously\nokay in fact it says the opposite but so\nso like and\nthat's that may sound like a\ncontradiction with being a meme lord but\nlike\nthis may sound like a profound statement\nbut like\na meme is actually a very serious thing\nright it's like actually very profound\nbut anyway so to answer your question so\nthis is where like we\nwe bring in dharma right so dharma or\nduty or responsibility\nso this is where a lot of people like\nslip up because they think like\nyou know when i when i say let's go\n[ __ ] that doesn't mean\nthat i get to do whatever i want to in\nfact it means the opposite\nso like what i would say about let's say\nfor example family attachments and\nparenthood so i'm\na parent and i have children so i love\nmy children i'm attached to my children\ni was pretty good at the detachment\nthing until i had kids\nand then actually what i realized like\noh this is pretty cool because then\ni realized this is actually part of my\nkarma and this is the next level\nbecause then what i did is become\ndetached from my attachment\nand i i kid you guys not this i know\nthis sounds weird i had worked so hard\nto be detached and then i had kids and\nthen i was like oh [ __ ] i'm attached now\nall of my detachment has gone down the\ndrain now that i'm like loving and\ninvesting my kids and then one day i was\nmeditating i started laughing i was like\nis it that silly how attached i\nam to losing my detachment\nand so then i was like [ __ ] it i'm gonna\nbe attached i'm gonna love my kids\nso be it and then it's been fun since\nthen and i just let myself\nbe invested in them i let myself\nbe worried i let myself stay up late at\nnight because one of them has a fever\nand what i realized is like you actually\nlive life more fully\nlike let yourself be swept away by your\nfamily responsibilities\nso be it like it it makes no difference\nlike you can you can still\nlive up to your dharma and i think you\nshould live up to your time and like\nliving up to your autonomous simply it's\nlike taking a test i'm not saying\nsit around and do nothing and don't take\ntests i'm saying that you guys should go\nout and you should act\nbut when i'm raising my kids i don't get\nbent out of shape about whether i'm\ndoing a bad job\nand now this is important to understand\nso hopefully you guys can understand\nthis distinction\ni've tried to do the best that i can and\ni don't get that out of shape\nabout doing a bad job so i'm not saying\nabsolve yourself of all responsibility\nand i'm i'm not saying\nstop trying does that make sense\nthere's a huge there's an entire gulf\nbetween\ndoing the best that you can and getting\nbent out of shape\nand what you guys do is the opposite\nbecause y'all get bent out of shape and\ndon't do the best that you can\nyou'll see that\nso oddly enough like you can commit to\nyour dharma\nand this is the power of dharma is that\nit flips those around for you\nso a lot of other things that we haven't\ntalked about today the dharma is one\nego's one\ndissolution of ego but if you start\nliving your time because then it's about\ndoing the action right like if your\nfamily is depending on you\ncase in point so like what we see in in\nuh\nalchem is is like a sense of dharma he's\nlike i've got to do this\nthis is what i have this is what i owe\nmyself to take care of myself\nand i can't live like this anymore\nthat's actually\non its deepest level it's a duty to\nhimself\nthat he deserves more and so he's\ndevoting himself to that\nhope that answers your question\nokay cool so i'm spent i'm sure you guys\nare too\nyeah so i think maybe we'll have to skip\nmeditation for today\ni let me just ask you guys real quick i\nmean like i usually don't talk this much\nhow do y'all feel about that\ni think it was awesome yeah yeah okay\nyeah okay\ntook a lot of the pressure off to\nperform\nwell listen so so actually i have to\ncommend you guys and so like\nbe careful okay so watch what happens\nwhen i say this last thing i'll tell you\nguys i'll leave you hanging after this\nso i think you guys are so smart that\nlike i didn't need to ask you guys\nquestions you guys asked such insightful\nquestions that i could give you answers\ny'all are so smart that i knew you could\nkind of keep up so it's actually really\nfun for me\nwhat does that do to you can't tell if\nthat's a meme\n[Laughter]\ni prefer when you're calling us stupid\nyes right so there's a whole other\nbucket of stuff like why is it that you\nguys can't sit with\nauthentic praise\na lot of stuff you guys need to work on\nbut\nand i don't know that you guys can't sit\nwith authentic praise i'm just making\nassumptions\nhere but anyway strong work today\nmy dudes even if i did most of the\ntalking it's hard to get me to talk\nso well played um\nany kind of closing thoughts or\nquestions before we wrap up\num just thank you yeah this is like\nreally insightful and a good discussion\ndefinitely learned a lot um so i just\nyeah thank you thank you for having us\non here\num yeah yeah i'm not super familiar with\nlike\nyour work i've heard like a little bit\nabout it um dr k but\num do you have uh any recommendations\nfor like i know you said meditation\ni have never heard anything about like\nyou doing meditation before do you have\nany recommendations for things that we\ncould look at for that\nyeah so we have a lot of like different\nmeditations on our youtube channel you\nguys like they're just kind of there\ni think for y'all i don't think it's a\ngood time to teach meditation right now\num just because you have to be sort of\ncognitively there\nbut um i will think a little bit about\nwhat kind of meditation for y'all\nspecifically\nand and maybe we'll pop that up on\nyoutube once i think about it so like\nwhat's a good\nego dissolving meditation but that\ndoesn't feel quite right to me\nokay cool i guess i i can give you guys\nsort of a meditation so there are\ndifferent kinds of meditations one is a\nformal meditation practice\nand one is something that is like more\nof a\nit's a different it's not an alum but\nnot so there's like alumni's are like\nmeditative techniques\nso i'm going to give you guys a\nmeditative a meditation that is not a\ntechnique so i know it sounds weird\ni want you guys to eat something that\nyou dislike and appreciate it\nso try that okay\nokay i didn't say like it i didn't say\nenjoy it i said appreciate it\nso can you just like eat something\nand like even if you dislike it\nappreciate it try to do that and see\nwhat happens\nokay okay\ngood luck strong work thank you"
