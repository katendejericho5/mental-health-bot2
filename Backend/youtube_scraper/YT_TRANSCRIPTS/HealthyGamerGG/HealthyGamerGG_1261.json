experience\nwith talk about toic or why don't you\ntell us who you are and what your\nexperience is yeah so my name is Shay um\nmy experiences with toxic masculin so I\ngrew up in a very like kind of uh um old\nschool household with like gender roles\nand stuff and the ideas of like what\nyou're supposed to be as a man um a very\nathletic like physical very like hyper\nmasculine family um I've spent probably\nclose to a decade uh I may not look like\nit right now but like as a deep in the\nsport of like powerlifting bodybuilding\nthing um I currently work as a bartender\nand uh yeah I've like I've I've been\ndeep in like the hyper masculine culture\num that involves like uh both on the\nends of like partying and like that\nlifestyle but also like abusing steroids\nand like things of that nature so I've\nseen quite a bit when it comes to how\nfar it can\ngo yeah cool thanks for sharing and\nwelcome back Shay thanks bud appreciate\nit\nnow if I remember correctly you had\ntrouble sitting with other people's\npositive sentiment last time it's Rusty\nuh no I had problems with uh ego and\nissues of like being uh how I care so\nmuch about how I'm being perceived okay\nyour advice to me was expose yourself\nokay cool so then welcome back thanks\nhopefully you didn't you know wind up in\nin jail because of my advice but\nno all right so who's who's going to\nwho's going to go\nnext I'll go next I'll I'll go next if\nthat's all right yeah go for it you go\nfirst please okay lemon why don't you go\nall uh my name is Quinton I'm 20 years\nold um I grew up in a household that was\nfairly accepting but I felt I always\nfelt like my dad was kind of\ndisappointed that I wasn't necessarily\ninto sports or into the more masculine\nthings and so as I was growing up mostly\nin middle school I found myself sort of\nhaving hatred towards people that would\nuh sort of Express those values I guess\nor Express those\ninterests yeah interesting okay\nyeah and then you wna I think the other\nperson wanted to\ngo yeah okay um so I'm Ed uh I'm 22 I'm\na postgrad student studying in the UK um\nyeah I guess my experience with h toxic\nmasculinity as a whole is I've always\nbeen an pretty extremely introverted\nperson um and where I grew up uh we were\nquite deep in the countryside and I\nthink me and all my siblings uh it\nwasn't like we lived isolated lives but\nwe weren't part of any sort of\ntraditionally hyper masculine culture um\nbut when I decided to of go to\nuniversity and things like that um that\nwas when I was exposed to it more and\nstarted to especially when as as well\nwhen I was gaming but other things when\nyou know you're drinking and partying\nwhatever I I could see myself displaying\nsome of those traits as well um and it\nwas really really freaky and something\nI've been working on for a\nwhile okay thanks for sharing\nEd who wants to go\nnext I can go um hi my name is Z I'm 21\nyears old and studying philosophy inch\ncol right\nnow um I guess my experience with toxic\nmasculinity has been kind of like for\nmost of my life I feel like I've been\nkind of pushed away from the identity of\nmasculinity because I don't really fit\nthe idea of it\nand uh it caused\nme a lot of\nstruggles with like my identity I guess\nokay H\ninteresting you're you're definitely\nowning that beard bro\num try to sorry go\nahead yeah um\nSam um kind of similar like uh my um to\nto the person that just spoke um not the\nmost traditionally masculine person\nnecessarily um I grew up in a pretty\nfamily with pretty pretty traditional\nmasculine values um like kind of\nemotionless um or aggress like yeah not\nreally expressing kind of emotion in\nany caring or positive way um in a\nmasculine sense um and then I and then I\nwent to like an old boy School and um\nthat was just a really toxic place for\nme um and so I I really felt pushed away\nfrom from identifying in any in any\nmasculine sense cuz the only examples\nthat I had were really toxic so\num I had to kind of try and find my\nidentity outside of a like a a\nsocietal like gender rolly construct\nwhich like I think ended up overall\nbeing healthy but that was really hard\nto get there okay\nthanks a lot for sharing Sam so first of\nall thank you all for being here um let\nme just kind of lay out a couple of\nground rules so rule number one is you\ndon't have to answer anything that you\ndon't feel comfortable answering right\nso if we I'm recognizing that there's\nbeen a lot of challenge struggle\npossibly hurt in some of the topics that\nwe're talking about and you know you're\nwelcome to draw a boundary wherever you\nfeel is\nappropriate um and just to kind of lay\nout that's that's really the only rule\nis that you guys dictate the\nconversation and you get to you know\nstop it wherever you feel comfortable um\nor wherever you feel\nuncomfortable uh in terms of just\nframing the conversation so I was kind\nof\nthinking about a couple things F first\nis like let's try to Define this term\ntoxic masculinity so maybe we can talk\nabout that for a second um and then the\nsecond thing to sort of think a little\nbit about is that it seems like each of\nyou sort of has an origin story about\nyour experience expences with\nmasculinity either identifying with it\nor not identifying with it and and I\nthink it could be really helpful to hear\num what your experience\nwas and then the third sort of area to\nkind of explore there are a lot of also\ngood tangents like for example uml and\nSam said that they they were sort of\npushed away from a masculine identity\nand so you know we can definitely\nexplore what that means or what that\nfeels like or what that looks like and\nthen the third thing that I I think we\ncan kind of touch on is how does your\nunderstanding of masculinity or toxic\nmasculinity affect you today and you\nknow what do it how does it affect your\nrelationships how does it affect your\nidentity how does it affect the way that\nyou move through the\nworld um and so how do you guys feel\nabout you know let's define it let's\ntalk about where it comes from and let's\ntalk about how it affects\nyou with lots of good tangents along the\nway\num if you guys do feel like something is\nvery pertinent and that you want to\nexplore it we don't have to go through\nthat that framework so by all means\nlet's just go where the conversation\ntakes us does that sound cool yeah so\nlet's start with this what is the what\ndoes it mean what does toxic masculinity\nmean okay why don't we start with oml\nand then we'll go to Ed okay\num yeah I think it's an ideal for men of\nbeing I guess stronger than\nemotions um okay that that's how I see\nit at least it has other traits like\nuh the ideal physical body and stuff\nlike that but uh that's mostly how I see\nit okay cool Ed do you want chime in\nwhat's your understanding of tox\nmasculine um yeah no sorry I think my\nconnection was really bad it seems a\nlittle better now um so to me it seems\nsomething along the lines of it's like a\nset of uh it's like a set of traits that\nare usually displayed by men not always\num but that are generally negative um\nwhen I read like a little bit of the\nliterature behind it they described it\nas uh socially regressive Behavior\nBehavior I think it's a really really\ngood way of describing it what does that\nmean socially\nregressive\num so uh maybe it it's something along\nthe lines of like it's uh it's not\nsustainable or if if if everyone acted\nthat way there would be a lot of social\nharm for\nexample\nokay interesting and does anybody else\nwant to share their understanding Shay\nlooks like you're about to speak yeah so\nuh my experience with it is that it's\nlike it's when you take a masculine\ntrait and that becomes greater than the\nperson itself it's like the\ndehumanization of some men where like\nsomething that could just be seen as\nmasculine now becomes more the ideal\nabove them being\nhuman really interesting\ntake Sam Quenton you have anything you\nwant to\nadd no I think I identify with those\ndescriptions\nwhat what do you identify with in the oh\nsorry go ahead\nSam okay um I think like I I agree with\na lot of what of what's been said I\nthink it's\nalso isn't a whole bunch of the really\npositive things within\nmasculinity\num yeah it can kind of bulldoze a whole\nbunch of things that otherwise could\nlead to really positive social\ninteractions can you give us an example\nof what you mean by that I think it's\nit's very much like\na yeah um so I think um I I think men\ncan be pretty\nnon-judgmental if it's\nlike around people that they have a\nconnection with like a close friend like\na lot of guys will watch someone that is\ntheir friend do\nsomething um in or obnoxious and brush\nthat off um\nin in a toxic sense like not call\nsomeone up on like not pull someone up\non something that's um maybe harassment\nor something like that but I think that\nthat not not not that\nnon-judgmental impulse if directed in a\npositive way like you can use that to as\na basis to kind of learn to forgive\npeople or to care for them or to like or\nto give them positive examples\nwithout being some kind of harmful\ncritique or anything like that so I feel\nlike\nthat yeah so let me just see if I\nunderstood you so you're what you're\nkind of saying is that non\njudgmentalness in and of itself can be\nused for a lot of good but sometimes in\na toxic masculine setting you take non-\njudgmentalness and it allows for the\ntolerance of like inappropriate or toxic\nBehavior because people don't call each\nother out on\nit\nyeah interesting\nyeah so Quenton I was wondering you said\nwhen you know all this stuff sort of\nresonates with you can you help us\nunderstand what features of it really\nfeel you know that you kind of connect\nwith yeah um I find\nthat when I was in school at least I\nfound that even when I was with you know\nmy friends and we were just having a\ngood time a lot of PE a lot of people\naround us would get almost offended by\nthe things that would go on at the table\nwhere we' meet\nup like what can you give us an\nexample um I'm\nnot specific example would\nbe when uh face swap apps were a brand\nnew thing we would go around and sort of\nuh just take pictures of random people\nand it would swap their face we thought\nit was pretty funny but uh the girls\nthat were at the table next next went\nover were uh not too happy about it\nokay yeah so um another just kind of\nsuggestion for how we're going to run\nthis is I I encourage you guys to\ninteract with each other so ideally what\nI'll do is launch like you know I'm\ngoing to launch a boat but then I want\nyou all to row so I'm going to ask you\nguys now about origin stories and and\nwhat I'd like you all to do is that\ninstead of having me play referee if\nsomeone says something that you can\nrelate to or that you had a similar\nexperience to actually jump in and just\nsay hey that resonates with me a lot\nhere's what my experience was how do you\nall feel about doing something like that\nsure sure so who wants to kick us\noff tell us your origin story and and\nwhat your experience of growing up with\na masculine or toxic masculine identity\nwas I I can\ngo\num so sounds good\nyeah\num when I was like six years old or\nsomething I\nuh realized it was an option not to cut\nmy hair so I wanted to avoid cutting my\nhair because it was annoying and uh when\nit became long a few years\nlater uh everyone started saying I look\nlike a\ngirl and\nfor at the start it didn't bother me\nthat much and I still kept my hair uh\nthe way it was but a few years later\nwhen I got to sixth grade uh my family\nstarted telling me you should cut your\nhair it's better\nshort uh so I\ndid and\nuh for for most of middle school high\nschool I was uh with a short hell\nand I think it's kind of like it's not\nabout the hair it's kind of the idea um\nsomething about me wanted to be a\ncertain way but the ideal of being Comm\nman said otherwise\nand I caved into that\nthing I've got a thing on her I think um\nwhen I was in when I was like 15\n16 um I started to grow my hair a little\nlonger I think\nit\nkity like it puts up those guard rails\non what's acceptable um in a kind of\nunhealthy like the way that it enforces\nthat so um I started to grow my hair a\nlittle bit longer and I was in a class\nand a couple of guys in that class\ndecided that it would be really funny to\njust have a pair of scissors and cut off\na chunk of my\nhair and that like because yeah they\ndidn't they didn't like the fact that my\nhair was like it wasn't even long it was\njust longer\num so okay so you said something earlier\nthat uh interested me so like my\nexperience with toxic masculinity is one\nof like I grew up like as like the\n[ __ ] Pinnacle I got like genetically\nBlessed Like come from a super athletic\nfamily when it comes to like masculinity\nI did well um and like my very much\nexperience with it is one of like uh\nthis is more important than you and I\nCan't Remember Your Name What's Your\nDragon what's your first\nname hello it's Sam Sam Sam um you said\nhow it kept you made you feel kept out\nof like when you came to was it\nUniversity you felt kept out of like uh\nyour identity because of the masculinity\nand like that's just something that's\nreally interesting to me because like uh\nmy whole experiences with it is one of\nlike it was like it's pushed on guys as\nbeing the most important thing and I\ndidn't really consider how um you can\nlike I don't like you kept from finding\nlike those masculine parts of yourself\num because of like I don't I don't know\nhow how intimidating it would be or what\nbut yeah could you talk a little bit\nmore about that for\nme yeah totally um for me it was that\neveryone that had those traits like\neveryone that was like hyper athletic\nreally confident um all of that kind of\nstuff uh they were also really\noppressive in my life like they also\ntended to be the people that that would\nbully me and my\nfriends um\nthey just yeah they just made my life\ndifficult so like\nthat naturally like I wasn't really a\nnaturally like hyp like person or\nanything like that and so for me it's\nlike here here's this example of these\npeople I really don't want to have\nanything to do with being anything like\nthat um I don't know if that exactly\nanswers your question so are you like do\nyou actively try to avoid things that\nrelate to those kinds of people\ndefinitely like I us to going to a gym\nokay maybe this is better Sor sh if you\ncan if you can repeat what you just um\nwhat you asked um so like do you feel\nlike you're avoiding masculine parts of\nyourself because of like your like poor\ninteractions youve had with them growing\nup in my life yes definitely Ely a\nlittle less now but\nstill Yes\num so I think it took a long time for me\nto understand how masculinity could even\nbe a positive for\nme\num just because all of my experiences\nwith it were like just hyper negative um\nand I also always kind\nof\num eyes so like\nlike uh it was just hard for me to kind\nof find any kind of positive masculine\nspace I didn't like I the the the more I\ngot to choose what I did athletically I\ndecided like not to do sport um I hated\ngoing to the gym I hated like just any\nanything that reminded me of body image\njust like kind of repulsed me because I\ndidn't really have a body that like Max\nmasculinity would kind of accept like\nnot not that like I wasn't really really\nat out um outside the norm it just\nwasn't I wasn't that that Pinnacle and\nso constantly being reminded that I\nwasn't that Pinnacle was really bad for\nmy self-esteem um and so I just kind of\nran away from that\nexpectation um yeah\nH what's that I can kind of relate oh\nyeah go for it quinon I I can definitely\nrelate to the uh running away from the\nmasculinity when I was in Middle School\nI went through a lot of the same things\nuh The Bullying from people that seemed\nto to me at least were the more\nmasculine the more Athletic\nkids and what did that bullying look\nlike um there was a lot of showing off\none uping especially in social\nsituations they\nwould like especially if I was trying to\nenjoy a sport or something in uh in say\ngym class they\nwould specifically steal the ball from\nme or specifically try to trip me or\npush me\nover and why you why would they pick on\nyou because I wasn't as masculine I\ndon't\nknow and what were you\nlike I was definitely a lot weaker I was\nkind of the funny kid in school because\nif I wasn't masculine at least I can get\npeople to like me by being the funny guy\nright did you make fun of\nyourself uh sometimes\nyeah yeah and Quenton had you said\nduring introductions that you developed\na hatred towards masculinity was that\nyou someone used the word\nhatred yeah yeah can you tell us about\nthat uh I don't I don't necessarily show\nit outwardly I kind of still have it um\nbut it's a lot of more of the chatter in\nmy head so if I say I'm at work I'm kind\nof just on autopilot I see some some guy\nthat's looks very athletic just walking\naround maybe holding a girl's hand I'll\nbe like I'll call him names in my head\nall s it's almost jealousy right what do\nyou call them in your\nhead uh just things like uh I say\nknuckle dragger\nyeah so I'll give you guys just a third\npiece of um instruction if you guys are\nokay with it so we're talking about we\nstart off talking pretty\nabstractly but I think that what really\nresonates with people and what what if\nyou really want us to understand I think\nthe more detail you give about don't\nnecessarily give us the\nconclusion give us like paint us a\npicture okay right so I I I think that\nhatred of masculinity is a\nwonderful abstract description Quinton\nbut right seeing a guy holding a girl's\nhand and calling him knuckle dragger in\nyour head says so much\nmore right right it really captures like\nI think that's something that people can\nrelate to\nyeah yeah I mean um when it comes to\nlike the um like that kind of idea of\njealousy um when I was when I was a lot\nyounger had um had really bad asthma and\nreally bad ecma as well and that meant\nthat I didn't um when it came to sports\nand doing masculine things in school for\nexample uh it wasn't just that I didn't\nwant to do it because I didn't want to\nexpose my like literally expose my body\num because it like I had their Xmen was\nreally bad um and I got some very\nstrange looks from people and I always\nthought of myself as kind of a freak\nbecause of that\nand then the Asma on top of that meant\nthat even if I could get over the way I\nlooked uh that I would be like severely\nhindered and I remember trying out once\nfor like the the cross country like\nrunning theme and having an asthma\nattack about a quarter of the way in um\nand as like as a result of that I just\nalways felt extremely excluded and when\nI got older and even when I got into\nUniversity for example I'd see people\nwho were like these big jacked guys or\nlike people that\nwere basically like athletic people or\nmore masculine people and I feel I would\njust kind of despise them to be\nhonest what did you despise about them\nEd well I was kind of placing them\nlike I don't think I was doing it\nconsciously but subconsciously I was\njust placing them above myself and I was\nsaying this guy is better than me\num it it actually caused a lot of mental\nanguish when I eventually got a\ngirlfriend in University because I would\nsee all of these other guys quite\nliterally every other guy and just\nautomatically assume that they were\nbetter than me for you know whatever\nreason and there would always be one\nthere would always be sort of one\nmasculine element that I could pick out\nand just be like yeah they're better\nthan me I don't know why my girlfriend's\nwith me because that person's way better\nand I would just kind of hate everyone\nbecause of that and it it caused a lot\nof trouble in the relationship but as\nwell in just my regular\nfriendship can anybody relate to Ed's\nexperience yeah\num I think uh for me it's\nuh kind of the same\nbut more\nuh into\nthe social side of it I guess like uh\nwhen I see other men\nespecially\num I don't know\nlike just\nnaturally\nbeing okay\nsocially makes me feel it\nlike I'm so much worse than\nthem so I want to tease out one word\nwhich I think is going to say a lot so\noml used the word\nnaturally anybody relate to\nthat yeah yeah I mean in my case at\nleast it felt like they were just\nliterally biologically above me like\nthere just wasn't a there wasn't a a\nchoice or anything I could do to improve\nit it was just they were by default\nbetter so easy for them did you guys\nfind yourself having that\nthought yeah and what was it like for\nyou not so\neasy can you tell us about that any\nall what wasn't so easy for\nyou uh even just social situations for\nme I was quite the introvert so I found\nthat the people that were a bit more\nextroverted especially the masculine\nones the guys were you know it felt like\nthey were above\nme they kind of just had things that I\nwanted but for some reason couldn't\nhave and what's it like to see other\npeople who easily get what you want want\nand can't\nhave feels like I got to put in a lot\nmore\nwork and then I just you know kind of\nburn\nout like trying too hard and then if\nyou're trying too hard people pick up on\nthat right\nso I'm kind of curious Shay so so it\nsounds to me like you actually had a\nsomewhat of a different experience from\nsome of the folks here yeah uh I'm the\neasy one you guys are talking about it\nwas me I got the genetics I took it all\nso tell us\nwhat was it easy on you what was your\nexperience like yeah it's just weird\nhearing this because like I'm on the\ncomplete other end of all of this and\nlike well you guys are like man like\nlook at all the benefits of like these\nguys just had it all handed to them my\nexperience with it is one of like bro I\nmissed out on so much of life because I\ndidn't get a chance to like really\nexperience myself like I don't people\ndon't realiz this but like masculinity\nhas a [ __ ] huge advantage in\nrelationships because only one person\ngets to feel pain and emotions like\nthere's this like this hyper masculine\nidea of like you're a man don't feel\nemotions don't feel pain just [ __ ]\njust man up and like it [ __ ] just\nslowly kills you on the inside and you\njust turn numb and like there's\nabsolutely like when it comes to dating\nin like some social situations there's a\ncomplete benefit to filling that role\nlike it just [ __ ] robs you of life\ntell us Shay I mean I relate to that\nlike\nI go ahead\nSam yeah no like so I have that\nexperience of being all of those things\nbut I think that's one of the really\nlike kind of Insidious parts of it which\nis\nlike no one on the outside sees that it\nkills that it like kills you on the\ninside when when that's what you like\nwhen you actually have all that stuff\nlike and this is something I realize\nwhenever I I internalized like all of\nthe toxic masculine stuff like I I did\nwant to be all of that even while I was\nrunning away from it and every time I\ntake a step closer to being it like I'd\nget hit with some of that stuff where\nit's like this actually really\nsucks\nand and so then like that kind of ended\nup in a bit of a spiral for me because\nthen I'm like well I'm not masculine and\nthis is causing a whole bunch of like\nissues for me\num and I'm not comfortable like being\nlike the world is not comfortable with\nme being like this my the people around\nme aren't but I'm not comfortable trying\nto be masculine like like trying to be\nlike hyper masculine that like that as\nwell kind of kills me on the inside and\nI'm left in the middle being like well\nlike\nwho like who am I like like where do I\nwhere do I go like what like who who am\nI trying to become because I'm not happy\nwith who I am\nI um oh sorry yeah I had something to I\nmean go ahead\num like when I eventually got to\nUniversity and became a lot more social\nlike I wasn't in terms of just like\ngeographically where I was I had more\nfriends and more opportunity to to meet\npeople and stuff I remember making\nfriends there was one specific guy who I\nmade really good friends with um and he\nwas like a extremely masculine person\nand and just like you said um like I got\nto see behind the\ncurtain and see actually how he was\nfeeling and and and what he like what he\nwas thinking as this like really really\nmasculine buff athletic guy that gets\nload of girls and I saw like just how\nmuch pain he was in and realized that\nactually there's there there's\nabsolutely no part of me that wants to\nbe that there's some middle ground but\nwhat he is I don't want to be that at\nall\nShay I was just hoping you could share\nwith us a little bit more in terms of\nwhat your experience of growing up was\nlike and and you know you mentioned that\nyou sort of sacrificed who you\nare in favor of like this ideal that you\nwere sort of taught to be or even forced\ninto and could you tell us about\nthat yeah so I remember very\nspecifically when I was like 10 years\nold taking a car ride home with my mom\nand my mom was talk talk about girls or\nsomething I don't even know what it was\nbut she looked at me and said you know\nShay girls don't like sensitive guys\nokay got it uh and like from that point\non it was very much this like driving\ntowards this like pseudo stoicism of\nlike let's just [ __ ] bury any\nsensitivity and emotion I have down and\nlike uh emotional vulnerability was not\naccepted in my household like you just\nlike you'd make a joke about something\nis you were allowed to do and that was\nand that was that um and like it it I\nfelt like I slowly got more and more and\nmore isolated from myself and my own\nemotions in the world to where I ended\nup like falling ironically end up\nfalling into like working out and\nweightlifting as like my escape from it\nand like which uh I I don't know at\nleast with my experience when you're\nlike that far gone from everyone and\nlike you're only given one thing that\ngives you like any form of Joy it like\nsuddenly turned into the only thing that\nI had in my life and like it became my\nidentity so I like took on more and more\nof this like um I'm a man role I'm I'm\ngonna I'm going to dominate the world\nbecause like I'm gonna display these\nlike hyper masculine traits better than\neveryone else and like this is this is\nnow who I am um so like all the things\nthat like you would associate with like\nmasculinity became like my like that was\njust a heat seeker for those things so\nit was like just being strong being seen\nas like a this like oldold figure like\nwomen um then it had nothing to do with\nhow I actually felt about any of it like\nat no point did ever stop and go like\nokay what do I actually want it was like\nI need to fulfill this role that like I\ndon't know I'm supposed to live up\nto how are you doing\nnow I'm pissed bro\nlike uh I I think I've just recently\nkind of Hit the realization of like this\nis my [ __ ] life and I can do what I\nwant with it and like now I'm like\nstaring at these pieces like I I realize\nthat like as humans we're just a list of\nskills like we were just like skills on\nskills on skills and like the things\nI've developed are like not congruent\nwith like a happy joyful life like I\ndon't know how to [ __ ] socialize and\nlike feel my emotions at the same time\nlike I feel like a [ __ ] robot half\nthe time I'm with a group of people it's\nweird\nI don't know I'm just sad I'm sad I'm\nangry about it I'm like I'm looking for\nplace blame and whatnot but okay yeah so\nI'm going to teach you guys this is way\nmore teaching than I expected but Point\nnumber four what are we going to do for\nShay what does he need from us right\nnow because he needs something right so\nagreed what does he need from us\nmaybe an opportunity to live a different\nlife how do we give him that what can we\ndo for him so he's telling us what did\nyou guys hear from Shay let's start\nthere feels like a\nhot\nlike just on autopilot\nmhm right so so I I add a little bit of\nnuance to that so he exists like a\nrobot but he actually told us that he\nfeels a lot of things that don't sound\nlike a robot to me what does he\nfeel well sadness and\nanger so how can we help him with\nthat well like as as Bros we kind of\nneed to just actually listen good how do\nwe\nlisten I know it's kind of a weird\nquestion in order for us to listen what\ndoes Shay have to\ndo talk how do we get him to\ntalk we asking questions absolutely so\nwhat are y'all going to\nask I've got a question that's all right\num like\nwhat what percentage of of like what you\nhave been do you think you've needed to\njust scrap and and and get rid of to get\ncloser to what like who you want to\nbe I I don't know this is where like\ntalking to Sam or like you're kinding of\nget repulsed by stuff is I don't know\nlike where I sit and all of this like\nthere's like parts of me that like okay\nI like do I actually enjoy working out\nis it like is is it okay to be somewhat\nmasculine what parts are okay and what\nparts are\ntoxic I I genuinely have no\nidea well like are there any parts that\nyou really\nenjoy oh what is\n[Laughter]\nJoy I I honestly I don't know because\nlike there's there's parts that have\nlike in my brain that have responded to\nincentive right so like if you care\nabout how you look and you put on a\ncertain personality you can get like\npleasurable rewards for that but like\npleasure isn't Joy you know so\nlike I don't I I have very little joy in\nmy\nlife okay so I'm going to pause for a\nsecond so we're gonna this is going to\nadopt a strange Dynamic okay so\napologies for this um so the four of you\nguys are going to help Shay\nokay we're going to do this we're going\nto do this for a little bit and then\nwe're going to learn how to help other\npeople so what are yall hearing from him\nlet's start by piecing together what\nsheay is\nsaying sounds like he doesn't know how\nto\ngo yeah they doesn't really know how to\nbe happy I I don't know if I'm reading\ninto it like you're reading in a bit too\nmuch that's that's exactly what you\nshould do Sam right so you're going to\nunderstand you're going to understand\nmore about Shay than what he\nsays because you've been there to a\ncertain degree does that make sense so\nwe want you to read too much into\nit right and then we're going to ask him\nabout\nit soel go ahead what did you want to\nadd\num kind of sounds like he's feeling lost\nlike trying to find happiness or\nsomething else\nand what he's been doing hasn't really\nworked and now he's looking for\nsomething\nnew how are they doing\nShay well I think I don't know yeah\nright so we could see it I don't know if\nyou guys caught it but when whenl when\nthe word lost came out of om's mouth\nsheay nodded he's like yes that is it\nthat is correct that is how I feel right\nso then what we can do is we can ask\nhim what does it feel like to be sad\nangry\nlost right so you guys pick one and ask\nhim I'm interested in how it feel to be\nangry about\nthis um I'm angry because I feel like\nlike whether you're a parent or like\njust in society in general we have like\na a duty to like develop people and like\nas someone's growing up like there's\njust what you're supposed to do is help\npeople develop into like understanding\nthemselves helping themselves and it\nfeels like I like I got benefit enough\nto where like no one looked at me right\nlike I like it looks like he has it all\ntogether so like let's just give him\nthat benefit and not help him or ask him\nany questions and like I I'm\njust I guess I'm just angry at the world\nthat like Why did Why did no one [ __ ]\nstop me at any point in time like hey\nman like I think you need some help like\nhey man what's going on\nlike like it makes me sad like this the\nanger I feel like inside of me is very\nprotective over me like someone someone\nlike I [ __ ] I had no idea I was a kid\nman I was [ __ ] 10 years old and\nyou're telling me to like suppress my\nemotions for like girls like\nthat's not okay like why how the [ __ ]\nyou going to do that to a\nkid and that guess I'm angry for that\nkid like who the [ __ ] didn't like stop\nfor a goddamn second and say hey man\nlike it's okay to be feeling the things\nyou're\nfeeling I feel like this is slightly\ntangential but I think Shay's\ndescription of his anger kind of just\nhit me a little bit um\nis I think there are a lot of really\nnegative ways to express anger um and a\nlot of negative connotations at times\nbut I feel like the kind of anger that\nhe feels there is a really positive one\nlike wanting to to\nprotect instead of lash\nout like and like this there's kind of\nlike that lash out like Revenge\nVengeance type anger thing which can be\nreally negative but I think and Angar is\nto you to\nprotect um other people yourself as\num something could be really\npositive it's a good point Sam I want to\ngo back to what Sam was saying because\nit feels like Sam has emotions coming up\nso we're going to walk yall through this\nagain does anybody have an inkling of\nhow we should respond to Shay\nnow so what is Shay saying that he got\nrobbed of\nwell like some sort of wisdom that would\nhave made his life way\nbetter yeah so I I wisdom certainly but\nalso when he expressed emotion what did\nhis mom\nsay right and so what is he doing with\nus\nnow expressing emotions so what should\nwe do about\nit will encourage it yeah how do you do\nthat\nthis is such like a guy\nthing it sounds really dumb but if you\nasked I feel like if you asked women\nthis or or girls in general it wouldn't\nbe silence you know be like oh well we\nsupport them and we do this and we ask\nthem around to do this and we're all\njust completely\ntools you know\nabsolutely so how do y'all feel\nnow feel ridiculous kind\nof\nyeah almost yeah\ngood right it's like so let this is\ngreat this is way better than all that\ntheoretical [ __ ] okay so let me explain\nlet me try to explain what's going on so\nwhat Shay like so Shay is like this is\nour chance to rewrite Shay's\nhistory so let's think Shay was grow\ngrow grew up and like literally was told\nby his mom at the age of 10 I don't want\nto see that [ __ ] and he's showing it to\nus\nnow right and we're paralyzed and we're\nlike like what he needs to hear\nis it's okay to show us this that's the\nright answer\nM right like I feel you man tell me more\nabout that I want to hear I want to\nlisten\nlike you seem upset or I'm seeing\nemotion in your face like we could just\nstate things very plainly because we\ndon't quite understand but we don't need\nto understand all we need to do\nis\nwatch right cuz his mom turned away\nshe's like I don't want to see that [ __ ]\nso we don't have to be competent we just\nhave to be\nwilling that's all he needs from\nus and now we feel incompetent because\nwe're like oh [ __ ] I don't know how to\ndo this because we weren't taught this\nstuff right and even then like the great\nthing is Ed is like he knows what women\nwould say in this kind of situation but\nyou guys like literally can't bring\nyourselves to say\nit and then you all did something but\nthat was beautiful because look at\nShay's face\nnow what do you guys what do you see\nthere\nbelief\nyeah right and and I don't know if\nanyone caught it did you guys see when\nShay's face changed\nright so it wasn't when you guys it was\nwhen you acknowledged that you felt\ninept and and so so like I think what we\nsaw there is that like cuz sheay doesn't\nneed us to be competent what he needs us\nto do is try and so what he saw is that\nthese guys are trying and they can't do\nit but like it's like when my\nthree-year-old makes me a sandwich it's\nlike it's going to be a terrible\nsandwich but I don't care because you\nknow she tried and she cares about me\nand that much is\nclear and so now we'll ask Shay Shay how\ndo you feel right\nnow\num uh\nI I mean there's still for sure emotions\nbottled up inside me but I really\nenjoyed the fact that like we're on the\nsame page of I don't it just it feels\nrelieving to like be understood that\nlike I really just\nneed Str enough\npermission of the people I'm around so\nI'll use two words here one is I think\nsh sha feels\nconnected and now I'll ask you guys how\ndo you think he felt growing\nup disconnected\nabsolutely isolated he's like no one\nstopped to ask\nme like no one cared about me right what\ndid they care about what did they want\nfrom Shay\nwell they wanted like manliness\nessentially like yep stoic strong\naggressive all all the things that like\nthe guys here kind of despise\nuhhuh right so so if I had to just build\non that I think that's the essence of it\nwhat they wanted was like an ideal they\ndidn't want him\nright they never wanted\nhim and what you guys just showed him is\nlike Hey we're okay with who you\nare we may not be able to help but we're\nokay with it it's okay to be\nyou I'm not quite sure where to take\nthings from here\nwell I kind of had a question for sh\nactually\num like how I think a lot of the rest of\nus spent a lot of time looking at people\nlike you at that age and thinking about\nyou and having a bunch of feelings\ntowards people like you but did was was\nthere any of that in the reverse like\ndid you look at people who weren't as\nmasculine and stuff like that and and\nlike did you did you think about them at\nall or like what kind of kind of\nfeelings did you have to\nLen if I didn't like you yeah absolutely\nI would uh I would neg your masculinity\nin my own head but like if you were just\nyourself and there was absolutely part\nof me that was like very protective and\nlike very much like like it's not okay\nfor anyone to put like uh anyone down\nbecause of like just who they are you\nknow like I just it felt I was felt so\n[ __ ] wrong to see anyone like I don't\nknow uh brought down for [ __ ] they\ncouldn't really\ncontrol and as all honesty too like\nthere's such an isolating world to like\nI don't know that lifestyle that like\nyou just stop [ __ ] thinking about\nother people like you just just just\nlike my my grandpa used to say like if\nyou ever go to the gym like you're\nalways weird about people looking at you\nbut like bro the only way those big guys\nare going to see you is if you get\nbetween them and the mirror\nGrandpa sounds like a wise\ndude okay he's\nbad bad meaning good I'm confused yeah\nhe's a bad [ __ ]\nyeah talk about masculine ideals right\n[Laughter]\nyeah\nso um let me ask you guys this what do\nyou guys think was behind Ed's question\nthat's a hard question to answer why do\nyou think he chooses to ask that\none I know for me it's something I've\nwondered before\nlike how\ndo they think about\nme I I don't know what it means exactly\nbut I can\nrelate well said how do they think about\nme right there's them and then there's\nus there are the Chads and The\nVirgins and and if I want to you know\nreally stir the pot a little bit I I\nthink there's a there's actually an\nundertone of a question which is Shay\ndid you hurt people the way\nthat I was\nhurt someone wondering that in the back\nof their\nmind\nyeah I feel like I need to defend myself\nhere like I like I'm I'm very much a\nsheep dog of a person like I I I protect\npeople over anything else like I and\nthere absolutely are people out there\nlike don't get me wrong I've been in\nthat [ __ ] world there are people out\nthere who like hurt people like that are\nthat they're so insecure about their own\nmasculinity like that they use that\nagainst everyone else um and that wasn't\nme I mean like I don't\nand maybe I'm just a rare example of\nthat I don't know but like uh personally\nto me no I don't I very much did not\never go out of my way to hurt anyone for\nlike the things that I took pride in\nso\nQuenton when I asked that question you\nknow I recognize it was a little bit\nindelicate I recognized that sheay could\nhave felt attacked by it right yeah um\nand and\nso if I had to guess I'd say the reason\nyou didn't ask is because you didn't\nwant him to feel attacked yeah\nexactly and what is it like to hear his\nanswer\nuh kind kind of relieving I don't\nknow really to describe what else is\nthere besides\nrelief I don't know I felt like there\nwas kind of a barrier MH in the\nconversation and it feels like maybe\nthere's a hole in the barrier now I\ndon't know yep that's a good way to\ndescribe it okay so this may be hard for\npeople to\nfollow when we have an unspoken question\nthat we don't ask because we're afraid\nof hurting someone's feelings it's like\nan elephant in the\nroom and so by asking the question and\nrisking hurting Shay but giving Shay a\nchance to answer it lets us put that to\nrest and then we can move together does\nthat make sense Quenton yeah right like\nfor like what we need to do is we need\nto settle that in your mind right like\nyou need to let go of the idea that she\nis like he's your\nnightmare cuz he's not right that's just\nbut but like we have to like address it\nyou know it's sort of like you have to\nbring it to the surface you have to\nrecognize it you have to acknowledge it\nand oddly enough I think that even if\nShay had said yeah I was a bully I think\nyou would feel the same I think you'd\nfeel relieved and like the the there's a\nhole in the wall right okay does that\nmake sense that even if he had said yeah\nI was the guy who used to bully you then\nlike you'd still feel okay about it\nbecause it's about it's about connection\nit's about moving forward because I\nthink you guys are sort of already on\nthe same team and so sometimes you know\nwe have to settle stuff between us so\nthat we can move forward was that a\nlittle bit too abstract for people or\nare people following\nthat\nokay what's y's understanding of of what\nI just explained and what just\nhappened how I see it is as long as we\ndon't\num address underlying assumptions or\nbeliefs we may have we won't ever be\nable to get past\nthem right beautifully put oml and what\nI'm hearing is that all of you haven't\nbeen able to get past take your\npick right that's what holds us back is\nwe're not able to get past\nthings and so teaching Point number five\nfor today is if you guys have a question\nthat you feel is impolite or offensive\nask\nit right and have faith that as a group\nwill work through it with you even if it\noffends\nsomeone and we'll give that person an\nopportunity they may feel like defending\nthemselves but we'll we'll help we'll\nmove through it so does anyone have a\nquestion like\nthat that they've been afraid to\nask because that's what we do right as\nmen we have thoughts and fear yeah go\nfor\nit\nwell I know for\nmyself I've never been like\na bully but I've\ndefinitely\nbeen\nlike made fun of people who I considered\nstill consider my friends and uh\ndisrespected their\nemotions\nand I I was wondering if anyone else had\nthe same experience\nI've kind of had the opposite experience\nto be\nhonest I've had a had a few friends that\num in in school they would\nbe what I saw as was pretty cut off and\nyou\nknow but when it was just the two of us\nhanging out they would open up more and\nthey would be able to express themselves\nin a different\nway so what did that feel like Quenton\nto have one friend in private and a\ndifferent friend in\npublic they felt kind of two- faced at\ntimes and I found if we didn't hang out\nfor set amount of time we would you know\nwe would become more distant they'd be\nless easy to talk\nto AML how do you feel\nabout having kind of made fun of your\nfriends in the\npast\num I mean I've been feeling guilty about\nthat for a lot of\ntime um\nand\nalso I've\nbeen really bad\nat maintaining connections with\npeople so\nkind of\num I don't know interesting to he the\nother side of it\nlike how it feels distant okay so now\nwe're going to do something I'm going to\npoint out another thing I guess this is\nturning into something else so you guys\nlet me know if this is okay or not okay\notherwise we can go with like our\noriginal framework\nokay um\nsoel has now put himself out\nthere and now we have to be careful\nbecause what he wants and what he needs\nare actually two different things what\nhe wants is to understand the other side\nthat's not what he needs though because\nwhat do we do when he Express his\nemotion right so instead of Shay we're\ngoing to focus onl for a\nsecond he says he feels guilty what are\nwe going to do about that\nask him what the guilt feels like\ngreat right y'all are learning so what I\nwould say is not so much what the guilt\nfeels like but what are you guilty\nabout but what what does the guilt feel\nlike is probably going to get you\nthere so who's going to\nask what do you feel guilty about\num\nfeel guilty\nabout being what\nI didn't want to be in social\nsituations um\nlike I'd\nhave\nthis same scenario I lot of time\nwell\nI\num like\nmaybe overstepping boundaries\nand\nbeing I don't know like just making fun\nof\npeople and uh\njust I I feel very disappointed in\nmyself because I never wanted to be that\nperson it sounds like you're putting a\nlot on\nyourself there's a lot of blame going\non\nyeah okay teaching Point number six\ngo ahead no Sam go for\nit um yeah I was just going to ask are\nyou\nscared that's like a part of\nyou the that\nlike yeah yeah are you are you scared\nthat that's like a part of who you\nare someone that can do that\nI I don't think I'm scared about that\nbeing part of me because I already know\nthat's a part of me I'm more scared\nthat that part of me can win and I can\nbe that\nperson so qu and you nodded emphatically\nwhen he said that part of me can\nwin yeah\num like I said at the beginning when I'm\nat work and I'm sort of being the\njudgmental person because I'm kind of on\nautopilot feels like I just am that\nperson that person is a different person\nthat kind of just takes\nover makes fun of people says calls them\nnames so I think we can understand that\na little bit better about you know being\non autopilot in the worst possible way\nbut I I want to just point out a really\nawesome job you guys did\nthere so you all dodged a very important\ntrack so whenl\nsays so when when he says yeah you know\nI I feel like I'm a bad person for doing\nthat and I that I am what I was afraid\nto\nbe normally what what people can say is\nnol you're not that you're great man\nyou're\nawesome but\nbasically you know Shay and and Sam sort\nof stepped in and and Shay just pointed\nout to om it sounds like you're\ndisappointed to yourself and then Sam\ndid something really\nwild and he was like he didn't tell that\nhe's a good person what did Sam do\nright he just sort of accepted where oml\nwas so oddly enough I I don't know if\nthis makes sense but how do you guys\nthinkl would feel if you guys said Noel\nyou are a good\nperson like his feelings were\ninvalidated\nabsolutely right so he would actually\nfeel\ndisconnected and when Sam says are you\nafraid that that person is real and he's\nlike no no I've actually sorted through\nthat so in that moment like we know that\nSam Andel are a little bit closer\ntogether and quent's actually like yeah\nI know exactly what you're feeling\nbecause that person does win for me a\nlot right and now we get to the really\nwild part which is that you know\nautopilot for some negative parts of\nyourself is probably something that Shay\ncan relate to too and I can imagine that\nShay and Quinton I'm just picking two of\ny'all feel like you guys are at opposite\nends of the Spectrum in some\nway but the closer we get to this the\nmore we realize that like toxic\nmasculinity has both of those are\nbad right and and that you guys actually\ncan connect because both of y'all are\nliving to a certain degree on\nautopilot and it sounds like Sam and\nShay have already connected a little bit\nin terms of their experiences but that\nthe closer we get to our actual\nexperiences instead of what other people\nsee on the outside the closer we get to\neach other and hopefully the more toxic\nmasculinity starts to melt away because\ntoxic masculinity is about not forming\nconnections right it's about being a\npillar an island and have nothing\nattached to you and a fully\nself-sustaining Island at\nthat and there were times in Shay's life\nwhere he reached out to connect with\npeople and poor\nQuinton this guy has a bridge that falls\napart and gets put back\ntogether and the saddest thing about\nthat is that it's not his choice right\nsomeone else lowers the drawbridge\nwhenever they want\nto but Quinton is sort of\nlike it feels to me like he's a beggar\nlike he doesn't get to choose when his\nfriends are nice to\nhim you guys felt that way y all\nfelt Shay what' you feel there what was\nthat bro oh that's a [ __ ] heavy\ncomment\nyep yeah there's like a it's like a\ndesperation in your it's like a\nfluttering of your heart man it's like\njust you're sitting on the outside just\n[ __ ] part of the like I think that's\nwhy I [ __ ] bartend even it's just\nlike it forces you in a social situ\nsituations and\nlike man like it just it couldn't be\nlike you couldn't put the nail more on\nthe head\nyeah I'm actually a little bit confused\nI don't know if other people are sorry I\nwas yeah no no that's okay I I think you\ndid the right thing so so this is what\nwe do right so if we if we're not on the\nsame page so I'm going to ask you what\nnail did I hit on the\nhead I lost you there for a second that\nlike\nthis isolation makes you feel desperate\nit makes you feel like a beggar it makes\nyou feel like you're on the outside just\nlike you're helpless waiting to like\ninteract and like be the person you want\nto\nbe but you have no real control in the\nmatter can anybody relate to\nthat can somebody share an experience\nthat they they had that made them feel\nthat\nway I guess uh there was a year in high\nschool\nwhere I had to move away just for a year\nand I sort of lost contact with a lot of\nmy friends so I was sort of starting\nfrom scratch so to speak and I\ndefinitely felt that disconnection felt\nlike at the mercy of other people's\nwillingness to talk to\nme and what does that feel like\nQuenton uh it feels like I'm not really\nin\ncontrol I'm not the super outgoing type\nso if someone wants to talk to me it's\nup to them if we become friends or not\nkind of\nI I feel the same\nway can you share with us\nsomeh\num\nI've well most of my life I had\nlike a decent\nlike amount of FS I\nI was never\nlike very socially excluded but I also\nnever felt very socially accepted either\nthough um it felt like\nI'm friends\nwith most of my surroundings but not\nreally close to anyone\nyeah I have something very similar to\nthat I think um I don't know if anyone\nelse felt this but for a very long time\nwith like without being able to\nestablish that connection with someone\nelse and actually open up properly\nmost people just kind of feel like\nfriends of circumstance as opposed to\nreal\nrelationships\nand I think\nit like it wasn't\nuntil I was 18 I think that I had that\nfirst real\nfriendship how'd that come about\nEd\num\nso when um when I when I was at that age\nlike I had a lot of really really bad\nanxiety issues and like social anxiety\nespecially that most likely stem from\nlike the the asthma and the xma and the\nexclusion that that kind of made me feel\nlike um but I was doing really really\npoorly in my first year of University\nlike I mean in uh in the UK the past\ngrade to get through your first year is\n40% which isn't very high I think I\naveraged 41% for that year I was I was\nright on the wire um and I knew that I\nwas so I had like a bit of a breakdown\nand I'd met this guy um called Luke\nwho's a [ __ ]\nangel um through playing on the\nUniversity OverWatch team and I remember\nwe I was playing with him for some\nreason and he all of the tools that\nwe've been talking about using like\nasking you know how did that feel and\nand actually like going down the rabbit\nhole and validating my feelings he sat\nwith me on Discord for like\nhours and just talk to me about it\nand it it was so weird I'd never\nexperienced that before in my entire\nlife ever and and it was like that level\nof intimacy was almost like there was a\npart of me that wanted to push it away\ncuz it was like what the what the [ __ ]\nis this\ngenuinely and and it's it's really\nfreaky because I think to this\nday I've had\ntens of conversations with this guy\nabout really horrendous like really deep\nhurtful [ __ ] uh and I've just become a\nbetter person every single time I'm like\nhow it took 18 years to get this what\nthe\n[ __ ] what did it feel like for you to um\ndo that with someone like what emotions\nwere you feeling even like exposing your\nown\nemotions I mean I think a lot like a lot\nof the times when people feel emotions\nthey just kind of bubble up to the\nsurface I feel like it's very rarely\nthat we as guys actually get to let them\njust explode and in a healthy way and\nyou just you go down the rabbit hole and\nyou talk about everything and anything\nthat's connected to it and the person\njust listens the hell and it was like\nhonestly it was completely\noverwhelming like just thinking about it\nnow brings back like so many emotions\nI'm so [ __ ] lucky that I have guy and\nI actually as much as other friends of\nmine might not want to hear it this guy\nis like the that like Leaps and Bounds\nabove any other man I've ever talked to\nin my life and it's like it's like\ncompletely overwhelming I mean if this\nis it's like it's a it's a closer\nconnection than I've had with any\ngirlfriend I've ever had it's like\ncompletely mindblowing\nbest friend\num like basically said the same\nstuff must be\nnice I I actually um there was a there\nwas a period where I um for some there\nwas like some reason that a friend of a\nlike a friend a mutual friend of the two\nof us\num uh I like I I I did something kind of\nshitty and I felt really guilty and I\nactually cut off my relationship with\nthis amazing guy for\nmaybe uh like I left the country to go\nwork and I actually cut my relationship\noff with this guy for I don't know like\nsix months or seven months probably what\nactually probably year um and\nlike again it was like um it like you\ndon't know what you have until it's gone\nI'm when I eventually force myself to\nstop being a [ __ ] and reconnect with\nthis guy and talk to him again\nlike it's just like raw luck man it's\nand it's so sad because I see a lot of\nguys that don't have this at all\nuh maybe someone else can relate to this\nbut there's times where like if I do\nhave a like conversation with someone\nwith someone about like where I get\nexpose my emotions like it feels like\nthere's like\na there's a a nozzle on my emotions and\nthere's only like an onoff switch for it\nthere's like no real control and there's\nno real like ability to like kind of let\njust a little bit out it's either like\nyou want to just [ __ ] explode or like\nyou just put up that wall and bottle all\nthat [ __ ] up\ndo you think that's because there is so\nmuch bottled\nup yeah\nprops um it's just like from what I've\nexperienced the the more that I've\nexploded and let it all out the the\neasier it is I know that sounds really\nbad like the the the easier it\nbecomes this is just like a really bad\nsex window\nit's it's gonna have to remain one\nbecause I don't really know how else to\nexplain just go for it Ed yeah like the\nmore once you start you have to finish\nwhat's up\nlsf the more the more you the more you\njust get that out of the way the easier\nit becomes to mediate it in a more\nhealthy way like a little problem can\nremain a little problem because you can\njust talk about it really easily\nso I just can't leave this on the table\nit's kind of like tugging one out before\na hot date right so you can think\nclearly just unload totally oh\n100% seriously like the that's actually\na Perfect Analogy I'm not even\njoking so what I'm hearing from Shay\nthat he's got a case of blue balls bro\nlike emotional blue balls that's\namazing okay but like here's my issue so\nlike if you don't have someone to like\nhave a relationship like this with like\nuh you feel like the [ __ ] like you're\num H what's the word I'm looking for uh\nyou're at the beck and call if anyone's\ngonna have an emotional connection with\nyou like where like you're not in\ncontrol at all of getting any form of\nemotional relief so like you're like\njust [ __ ] this desperate little like\nlike as points I feel like I'm trading\nmy masculinity have like an emotional\nconversation like I'll hook up with you\njust please talk to\nme yeah so I I want to highlight also\nShay Shay made an off-hand comment it\nmust be nice did yall catch that yeah\nhow do we understand that\ncomment\nthat's know how\nto share\nthe like I I don't know how to talk\nabout something happy jealousy like\nmaybe\nEnvy you just don't know how to\nrelate right so so I'm sorry Sam did you\ndid you say\nsomething I think it was just like I\ndon't I I feel like I've been on both\nsides of that where like I spent so much\nof my life wanting to like emotionally\nconnect with other guys or just people\nin general and never being able to and\nso like being in that position where I'm\nlike it'd be really nice to have that\nit'd be absolutely amazing to have that\nand then\nlike that and I feel lucky and I don't\nknow how it happened and I feel really\nterrible talking about it to people that\ndon't because don't feel like I can help\nthem because I\ndon't I feel like I just rolled a you\nyou know like like I just rolled a dice\nreal good\nand yeah like I I want to help but I I\njust don't know I don't know how like\nguys aren't taught to to to have\nemotional relationships like that I\nthink that's one of the things that I\nfeel angry about um similar how like\nwhat Shay was talking about it's\nlike this is this is [ __ ] like who\nwho\nlike like who thought it was a good idea\nnot to teach\ntalk to each\nother like so that it has to be so that\nit has to feel like it's random\nluck yeah so if it's okay with you guys\nI'm going to take a stab at sort of\nsummarizing I feel like we've done some\ngood work today you all okay with that I\nwe'll still have time for questions and\nmaybe meditation and stuff but so first\nthing I want to point out is like you\nknow earlier Shay got emotional and he\nwas saying like no one asked like how I\nwas doing no one thought to care no one\neven they just\nsaw the front which I was taught is the\nimportant thing I was taught that this\nis what I should be and I did what I was\ntold and so everyone thought that\neverything was fine sort of myself\nincluded but I was dying a little bit on\nthe\ninside and and so no one stopped to\nlisten right in fact the opposite they\ntried to shut me up when I spoke and so\nthere's a part of me that says that you\nknow the only thing that Shane needed\nwas Luke like he needed his own Luke\nright and Ed was lucky enough to have\nLuke his Angel of the\ninternet and and you know and it's it\ndoes feel overwhelming and teaching\nPoint number seven so we did something a\ncouple minutes ago with all the\nmasturbation and jerking off jokes\ncalled coming up for air that's what I\ncall it so especially when and men feel\na lot of heavy emotions we have to cut\nthat tension and we have to go back to\nfamiliar territory which I kid you not\nis Dick jokes this is what groups of men\ndo when we feel uncomfortable we start\njoking about our\npenis right and and it's like it's our\nmind's way of like entering familiar\nterritory where once again cuz we're all\nconnected cuz we're all laughing about\nit\nright and and literally like there\nthere's there's one patient of mine in\nparticular that I'm thinking of where\nit's gotten to the point where I've\npointed out this pattern we've seen this\npattern in our own therapy sessions and\nthen I'll ask them is it time for a dick\njoke now and then we'll laugh about it\nand that's\nenough right and then we can stay\nunderwater for longer because the more\ndick jokes we make the closer to the\nsurface the more comfortable you guys\nfeel the more we move away from the\nnegativity but at the end of the day\nwe're we're all bonding at that time\nbecause we went underwater together\nwe're swimming together and then we're\ncoming up together we're holding hands\nthe whole\ntime\nright so that's what happened there\nwhich is good it's\nhealthy and and and it was also like\ninteresting how Ed kind of like\ncontinued sharing despite he was like\nyou know I still want to say this even\nthough it sounds absurd and we can joke\nabout it but like I'm I'm going to I'm\ngonna finish you know and and that's\ngood right so we we let him do that\nand so then we get to kind of what Sam\nsays which is that sometimes I've had\nthose people and sometimes I've\nrecognized that I've met people who need\nme to be a Luke and I don't know how to\nbe a Luke and we hear this kind of from\nQuenton and and oml as well that you\nguys also struggle with some amount of\nlike toxicity and\nhatred and and resentment right so I I\nget the sense that Shay is holding on to\na lot of resentment which is Justified\nbecause you know he was robbed\nright that's what I would say is like\nlike to a certain degree all of all of\nyou were robbed of a particular\nexperience and so then then what we this\nis the only thing that I I'd say is\nreally incorrect out of everything\nthat's happened today which is that\npeople are sort of saying it's up to\nRNG right like Ed was lucky enough to\nhave\nLuke and and Shay was unlucky enough to\nnot have Luke that's what I take an\nissue with because that's true but only\nup until\ntoday and so literally what we're doing\ntoday like you so it's time for you guys\nto be\nluke right like y'all collectively yall\ndid a little bit of it\ntoday where you know you guys helped\nShay and that's what you need to like\nyou don't have to be good at it you just\nhave to try and youall will learn you\nlearn how to be\nbetter and it's not up to luck anymore\nnot if you choose to take an active hand\nin and this is the real tricky thing is\nthat we live our life and we we feel\nlike we're victims of circumstance and\nto a sense we are like there's no way\nthat you know Shay says he got the good\ngenes but he also got the powerlifting\nfamily and whatever so like he was given\nthat that's his\nkarma this is\nKarma and yet your karma does not excuse\nyour Dharma that Dharma and Karma go\ntogether and so like you guys have a\nDharma now to help each other over the\ncourse of this coners ation going\nforward you need to be that thing for\nother\npeople you know you need to help them\nnot feel alone and and all you need to\ndo is just share your own experience and\nlisten ask try to understand like who is\nthis person and recognize and I guess\nthis turned into sort of a a seminar of\nsorts of like how to do this because I\nrecognize you guys don't know how to do\nthis cuz we weren't taught so that's our\nKarma to grow up in a society where we\nweren't taught and is our Dharma to\nteach it to learn it that's what we're\ndoing so I don't accept I accept that\nyou guys have had RNG up until this\npoint but I don't accept that it's RNG\ngoing\nforward right I think you guys can be\nfor each other what you yourself needed\nand I think that's the only [ __ ] way\nit\nworks CU each and every person in this\ncall needs the rest of you and each and\nevery person in this call needs you\nand sometimes the way in which they need\nyou is for you to need\nthem right which is the really Next\nLevel play which is to recognize that\nsometimes the best thing that you can do\nfor someone else is to let them help\nyou that the best thing that I can do\nfor my daughter is when she comes to me\nwith her sandwich which is made of\nPlay-Doh and is\ninedible is not to say this is a crappy\nsandwich I can make one myself I don't\nneed you it's to say thank you and then\nI open my mouth and I eat the\nPlay-Doh right cuz that's what I can do\nfor\nher and so I'd say going forward I I\ndon't know exactly what we're going to\ndo about this but I think we've got to\ndo something about this like practically\nI don't know if it's like Discord like\nwe're going to meet again or what but I\nthink you guys are really on an awesome\nJourney you guys have taken a lot of\ngood steps\ntoday um one person thought that what\nwhat is this stream I saw this\ninteresting comment on chat is this a\nteach people how to coach\nstream that's what they thought you guys\nwere\ndoing but that's sort of it's not\ninaccurate in some ways but anyway so\nthoughts\nquestions\nReflections can I ask\nsomething sure\nI feel I I have a younger sister she's\n10 years old and I feel like I've been\ntrying to be look for\nher um\ncuz I can sort of see how uh going down\nthe same path I went in some\nways but I\nfeel like\nI'm really useless like I I can't\nactually\nhelp\nokay is that a question for\nme I don't\nknow I just I feel like I need to\nbe that person but I don't know how I\nguess that's a\nquestion is that a\nquestion I think so\nwhat are you guys hearing from\noml it's like helplessness helplessness\nmaybe is that how you\nfeel\nyes right so teach you guys one more tip\nso I I'm not sure I heard a\nquestion but why does he frame it as a\nquestion so why do we ask questions to\nget answers to get help so you guys are\nspoton that what he's asking for is\nhelp right even if there's not maybe\nthere was a question in there he said I\ndon't know what to do I feel helpless I\ndon't know how to help her even though I\nsee it\nhappening so what are we going to do for\nhim\nI like ask him what the like what\nspecifically feels\nhelpless like yeah how how does that\nkind of\nmanifest\num\nI it seems to me like\nshe's kind of alone in the same way I\nfelt when I was her age\nand I can't fix\nthat I'm going to put Shay on the spot\nShay what do you think about\nthis one I think it's I I appreciate how\nmuch love you have for your sister I\nthink that's very sweet I just want to\npoint that\nout um and I think this is a lot\nWeighing on your\nshoulders and um\nI'm here for you and I I feel you\nunderstand\nyou and I'm not really sure if I have\nthe best advice to give you I don't\nreally know what the right answer is in\nthe situation but I feel you man this is\na rough spot to be\nin I mean I like I I oh sorry I have I\nhave a really good friend um\nwho I can see going down the exact\nlike exact like patterns of thought I\ncan see the ones I had in him and I want\nto help him and I\ntried and I feel yeah I don't know like\nI feel in in with him I kind of feel\nhelpless as well because I really care\nabout this guy you know um like like I\nfeel it you know I have a question Dr k\nm because I feel like in the situ\nsitations I I've been these a few times\nwhere like like I can talk [ __ ] and\nimagine I know what the right piece of\nadvice is right and I can like sit from\nmy perspective and give what I think is\nthe right advice but I don't know like I\nhave I have no idea like I've never I'm\nnot I've never been in a situation and\nI'm not in a situation so I don't really\nknow what it's like so like and this is\nwhat I feel like a lot of even\nex-girlfriends have run the same issue\nwith where like do is there even like\nshould I offer advice like is this is\nthere a place to offer advice or is this\nlike is the benefit really in just\nsitting with that\nperson yeah so I I thought you knocked\nit out of the park right and I think\nliterally what I would DOL is listen to\nShay's answer and I would consider\nsaying that to your\nsister right so Shay's answer was I\nunderstand that you're in a situation\nthat is tough and I don't know how to\nhelp you with it but I'm here for\nyou and I don't have answers for you\nbecause it's a complicated\nproblem but you don't have to face it\nalone right so like what what sheay is\ndoing is acknowledging that he can't fix\nit\nforl and I think that's exactly that you\nhave to do for your sister because you\ncan't fix it for\nher and that it is complicated and you\ndon't know all the answers but that\nyou're here for\nher and in your case I think you you can\nshare maybe just a tiny bit more which\nis if you felt really alone you can cuz\nshe may not even understand because\nshe's 10 she may not understand that she\nfeels\nalone but you can just ask you can try\nasking her hey do you ever feel like\nkind of lonely or or you know what\nwhatever you see in your in whatever you\nsee of yourself in her you can open a\ndoor for her to walk through about\nthat so I remember when I was 10\nsometimes I felt kind of lonely and then\nI would actually make fun of my\nfriends do you ever feel like you do\nthat I definitely used\nto yeah so so so you know I think the\nmain thing is is sort of what shade\ndid which is like what we have to do\nright so like Luke didn't fix any of\nEd's problems and this is where things\nget really confusing in part of toxic\nmasculinity cuz as men we fix things we\ndon't sit with them we don't support\neach\nother like if you feel alone because you\nhaven't gotten laid go out and get laid\nbro I'm not going to I'll hire you a\nprostitute but I'm not going to sit with\nyou in your\nloneliness right it's all about making\nour problems go\naway it's about fixing the situation so\nwe don't have to feel anymore\nmore it's about lifting\nmore it's about you know being\nbetter it's about moving away from who\nyou are into the ideal of what you\nshould\nbe but never sit with it no no no do\nsomething about it right a man acts a\nman does a man is strong a man doesn't\ntake it lying\ndown a man isn't control of his own\ndestiny man doesn't discuss his\nfeelings feelings are for wimps I a man\nand I do things I fix my life do\nsomething with yourself be the change\nthat you want to be in the world stop\nsucking at it be\nbetter all that stuff has Merit don't\nget me wrong sometimes just sit with it\nand sometimes share with people one of\nthe most validating things you can ever\nsay to someone is that you don't have an\nanswer for their problem because their\nproblem is so hard because that's\nexactly like IFL feels helpless he feels\nlike he has to climb Mount Everest and\nif you come to him and you say holy [ __ ]\nman I have no idea how to get to the top\ntop of that mountain that's one of the\nbest things you can tell\nhim right so like if you say I feel\nhelpless about your problem too at least\nhe's not\nalone does that answer your question\nShay\nyeah entirely thank\nyou\ncool any other\nquestions so how' you guys feel about\nthis\nconversation I feel what I'm doing huh I\nkind feel like I didn't know what I was\ndoing yeah for a\nlot how do you feel about\nthat\nuh a little bit embarrassed but feels\nlike you know if I go back to the VOD\nafter this I might be able to take a lot\nfrom\nit it's a good\nanswer so you know would you I'm just\ncurious and yall are you please be\nhonest would yall have preferred that we\nsort of stuck with our original Three\ntalking\npoints I'm pretty happy with how this\nturned\nout yeah me too\nyeah I mean I feel like it definitely\nbenefited all of us on a personal level\nbut\num I I mean if like just for in like for\nme this been trying to be in uh\ninformative I don't think we explored a\nlot about what like where it comes from\nand understanding what toxic Mas\nmasculinity actually is\nbut I I learned a lot from this I didn't\nrealize the ineptitude that we have of\nsitting with each other's emotions but\nyeah so I I would say I wouldn't say you\nguys are anep or incompetent I'd say\ny'all are inexperienced there's a huge\ndifference if anything you guys are very\ncompetent I think yall are talented at\nthis you guys pick this [ __ ] up very\nquickly\njust say you're inexperienced it's I\nknow it's bizarre but I think yall are\nNaturals Sam did you w to chime in about\nwhether you liked how this went or not\nor would you have preferred a different\nsomething else kind of ended up Landing\nwhere we on the things that we would\nhave glossed over in the conversation\nlike with structure and so I think that\nthat's leaving us hanging I think that's\nand then\nit can I get a thumbs up or a thumbs\ndown like good\nokay there's one more part\ntoo uh one thing I would have like to\ntalk about is like the merits to\nmasculinity because I feel like we're\niing so much of a problem we always talk\ndown to it but I think there's a lot of\nMerit in masculinity and I don't think\nwe gave much like light to that yeah\nlike I think one of the something that\num is talked about a lot when we talk\nabout toxic masculinity is is the\nnegatives of it and there are a lot and\nlike I don't want to downplay that but a\nlot of the the positive change I've seen\nin my life over the past few years has\nbeen through the implementation of like\nsome of the more positive elements of it\num and like I I feel like no one talks\nabout\nthose yeah I I I agree so I I think when\nI went on that little litany about you\nknow doing something about it I don't I\nthink like I said I think that's\ngood right so so I think you all right\nthat this is you know this is\nthe good and the bad at healthy gamer is\nthat no conversation is ever\ncomplete right we make a lot of progress\nbut there's always another conversation\nto be had which is why you know this is\na sustainable\nformat because we're not\ndone um and at the same time I I totally\nget it I I I I also felt like uh you\nknow this was productive and at the same\ntime I I noticed myself still wanting to\nhave that other\nconversation I still want to hear very\nexplicitly about you know how the way\nhow your understanding of masculinity\nshapes your life today I want to hear\nyour stories about what it's like to be\na bartender you know because I I think\nwe we tapped into some of these present\ncircumstances through this conversation\nand um and I think that talking about\nthe positives of masculinity is a really\nimportant conversation\ntoo so let me think for a second about\nmeditation all right I'm GNA be right\nback I gota go pee so bad\nI feel like I want to teach you guys uh\na meditation about adite but I just\ndon't know what to teach you guys um so\nI think a good meditative practice to\nlearn here is one about\nnon-duality so like right now we're\ntalking\nabout I I I've heard this thread a lot\nthroughout this conversation so and\nespecially at the end about like toxic\nmasculine it and positive masculinity\nand oddly enough I want to say that\nthere's no such thing as toxic\nmasculinity there's only\nmasculinity and it isn't toxic in and of\nitself that toxicity is a judgment that\nwe place upon it and I think someone\nkind of mentioned early on about non-\njudgmentalness and how that can be like\nwrong or right right which tells us that\nnon-judgmental in and of itself is not\nwrong or right that all things are as\nthey should be\nand I hear you guys sort of striking\nthat balance a little bit about you know\nbeing the victim of toxicity yourself\nand being a source of toxicity for\nothers I hear that sort of conundrum\nwith Sam too about hating some aspects\nof toxic of masculinity and also\nappreciating some aspects of you know\nwanting something and pushing it away so\nthere's a lot of like Push Pull there's\na lot of Duality\nhere um\nand so I'm just trying to think about\nwhat meditation will help\nus sit with\nthat and this also goes to the idea of\nlike what is the right thing to do there\nisn't a right thing to do there's just\nwhat you\ndo and and I think that the more that\nyou guys appreciate like you know as as\nShay kind of mentioned ATL and I I\nreally think that was what I would call\nquote unquote the right answer which I\nrealize is weird because we're talking\nabout how there is no right answer but\nyou know there's only the answer that\nsheay is capable of\ngiving that's all you can give and\nwhether it's enough or right like that's\nirrelevant all you can do is what you\ncan do and that's what the essence of\nrightness is is to be what you can be\nfor the world to be luke if you were\nLuke forl to be what he can be for his\nsister because he can't fix her he can't\nchange her life you can just be what you\ncan\nbe now I have to come up with a\nmeditative practice that will illustrate\nit will help you guys learn that so let\nme just think for a second how does that\nsound in terms of direction of\nmeditation okay yeah\ngood okay do you guys have access to\nfood do you have food\naround you get some go get some yeah no\nGG wait yeah I could him so this is what\nI want you guys to do I want you to go\nfind a piece of food that you\ndislike who can do\nthat maybe I'll go take a\nlook if if you\ncan't disliking is better but if you\ncan't find something that you can\ndislike\nthen that's okay\ntoo okay just find something I was going\nto say I I don't tend to buy food that I\ndon't like I know I know oh actually so\nyou have an\napple is that an apple does it have a\nstem yeah\nyeah it oh yeah it does so plot the stem\noff and wash\nit okay I thought you were going to just\ntell me to eat it straight up right now\nno no you should wash\nit yeah all right\nGG Get Wrecked\nshitties I think he thinks he can\ndodge mine's kind of shitty\nbut it's okay whatever you guys can come\nup with is fine\n[Music]\nyeah so people who are watching on chat\nyall should go find something that you\ndislike okay all right okay so we're\njust going to talk for a second okay and\nthen I'm going to ask you guys to you\nknow eat the thing um so let's just\nunderstand that so life gives us\nexperiences and we tend to be avoidant\nor dislike unpleasant\nexperiences and often times it is\nthrough the avoidance of the unpleasant\nthat we find ourselves in\ntrouble right whether it be you know I\nfeel lonely so let me become a bartender\nso I can take that loneliness\naway um I feel bad about myself so let\nme make someone let me make fun of\nsomeone so that I can feel better about\nmyself and take the Badness of Myself\nAway\naway and so a big part I think a big\npart of moving forward in life and and I\nLoved Someone who used the phrase\nstoicism which I love pseudo stoicism so\nI think a big part of moving forward in\nlife is to\nnot is to learn how to be okay with the\nnegative so Dharma is one way that we do\nthat right so you you you know I eat the\nplaydoh for the sake of of my child's\nfeelings and so like you can accept the\nnegative for the right reason but even\ndeeper than that or a different way to\napproach it is to just learn how to sit\nwith something that you thought was\nunpleasant and that's what we're trying\nto do right if we want to sit with our\nemotions if we want to sit with this\nnegativity we just have to learn how to\nsit with it so we're going to practice\nsitting with things that we thought were\nunpleasant does that make\nsense so I want you guys to just tell us\nwhat you have\nthere what' you guys end up with\nperfect yeah oyster crackers\nokay okay so you have the peel\nSam you have the peel of that orange\nI've got\npotential yeah great tear off a piece of\nthe peel did you wash the peel or\nno oh no okay so so get some of the\nwhite fuzz from the inside of the\npeel okay yeah good\num what do you have\nQuenton I have a slice of fake cheese\nbeautiful so and then uh Uhl your tomato\nhas the top part that you normally chop\noff and don't\neat yep okay great yeah good so now what\nI want you guys to do is just just with\nyour eyes closed we're going to eat it\neat you know\nsomething and and whatever you guys have\nthere\njust notice your reaction to it and try\nto see is this Pleasant or\nunpleasant okay and and my boy Ed here\nis going to take a little nibble of the\nstem of his\nApple\nokay so give it a shot so close your\neyes so take a moment to just check in\nwith yourself take a deep\nbreath notice which of your nostrils is\nmore open than the other\nand now go ahead and and eat the thing\ntake a\nbite\nokay so notice your reaction to it and\nobserve it\nso notice what unpleasantness feels\nlike go ahead and finish swallowing or\nyou can spit it out if you feel like\nit's\ninedible looking at you\nEd and so just see what happened to your\nsensation of unpleasantness\nnow for those of you who have something\nthat is\nPleasant so I'm thinking like Sam you\nactually have the orange Ed has an\nactual Apple processed cheese oyster\ncracker y'all are probably so but now go\nahead and take a bite of the thing that\nyou\nlike you can spit it out Ed\nlooks so horrible okay good sit with it\nso just sit with the sense of sensation\nof\nhorribleness and now when you're ready\ntake a bite take your next bite so of\nthe good part of the tomato a bite of\nyour Apple the\norange processed cheese and oyster\ncracker y'all are\nstill you know\nand see what it's notice the\ndifference notice how it's it feels\ndifferent\nand now when you're ready go ahead and\ncome on\nback so I'm G to ask you guys what was\nthat like can you share your experience\nwith\nus yeah oyster cracking are tasty as\n[ __ ] that didn't work very well for me\nthey're way good they're much better\nthan I remember I was going to say like\noyster crackers are pretty damn good\nman I love\nthem get yourself some Chow put some\noyster crackers in this [ __ ] delicious\nman yeah man those those were\ngood okay so what did you how did you\nreact so other people's\nexperiences um I had kind of lean in to\none and lean out from the\nother okay go\nahead um this kind of gut reaction of\nthis should not be in my\nmouth that's that's what she\nsaid okay\nsorry me like\nthat I could I couldn't help myself I'm\nso sorry o\nokay you can come up for air we'll allow\nit but see the thing the the reason that\nI apologize for that one Shay is because\nwe weren't even in a heavy place I just\ntook a I mean you know I just\nit was you know so so let's let's talk\nabout that so like I I noticed so it\nseems like it was unpleasant for RL it\nwas unpleasant for Ed\nclearly so Ed can you tell us about what\nthat felt like for\nyou\num it kept stabbing me so it was pretty\npainful to be honest but um like I just\nkept having this urge to just like not\nlike give up but there was this moment\nlike every like 5 seconds or so where\nall the ne like the negative\nemotion would just kind of stop and it\nwas like okay time to get rid of it now\nlike an automatic just like repulsion\nyou know\nokay and then for those of you who ate\nsomething separate what was the second\nphase\nlike when you took the bite of the Apple\nwhen you took the bite of the orange\nit's\nrelaxing looks like a\nspeaking I just hate tomatoes so it\nwasn't that much of a difference okay\num okay so so this is very practically\nwhat I want you guys to do is practice\nthis so don't eat app I mean Apple stems\nbut but you know the next time you guys\nhave a choice to take to choose the\nthing that you like the most you don't\nhave to pick something bitter or not\ntasty you can go closer to the middle so\nlet's say that like you you know have a\nchoice between sandwich and pasta and\nand you want a sandwich I want yall to\npick pasta and what I want you guys to\ndo is in a\nvery scientific sense navigate between\nyour experience of unpleasantness and\npleasant\nthis and the goal here and this is\nreally the goal but what I want you guys\nto learn is how to treat both of those\nthe same\nway right if you practice and if you're\nable to sit with an experience you'll\nbegin to realize that like I don't know\nhow if this makes sense\nbut there's a difference between you\ntasting it\nand\nyou how can\nI there's a difference between you\ntasting it and there being someone who\ntastes\nit okay I know it sounds weird but like\nthere there's a way to observe your\nexperience of unpleasantness instead of\nsit inside\nit right there's a way to\nsay you know like I'm feeling over like\nto notice oh [ __ ] I'm kind of\noverwhelmed today versus being\noverwhelmed today does that make sense\nhave you guys been able so like this is\nthe skill that you need to\npractice right and so so to learn to\npractice to sit with unpleasantness and\neventually the goal is going to be that\nyou can actually choose unpleasant\nthings and they will be no different\nfrom Pleasant\nthings and I don't know if you guys have\ntried to make dietary changes at the\nbeginning like a good example is like\nquitting soda where at the very\nbeginning quitting soda is\nhard but then once you get used to it\nit's kind of like actually I'm okay with\nthis that I can choose between\npleasantness and unpleasantness or if\nyou start to acclimatize yourself to\nlike a bitter\nfood and then eventually hopefully what\nyou guys can do is just learn to sit\nwith the\nunpleasantness and then as you do that\nyou'll start to sit with unpleasantness\nand be able to face things in your life\nthat you other otherwise wouldn't\nface but on a deeper level actually this\npractice is potentially so much more\nvaluable than that but anyway\nquestions is this like the meditations\nof the self like as I do some Sam Harris\nstuff but like you do a lot of work with\nthat it kind seems kind of similar I'm\nsure it's similar I'm not quite familiar\nwith it but I think there are a couple\nof Core Concepts in meditation that\nmanifest in all different kinds of\npractices\nso yes this certainly has to do\nespecially that Detachment part that I\nwas explaining that like you know when\nyou're wrapped up in an experience it's\nvery\npainful when you gain distance from it\nit's kind of like let me put it to you\nthis\nway is water on a screen\nwet right so if you watch something and\nsomeone if you're watching a movie where\nsomeone jumps into water they get wet\nbut that's only if they're like in the\nmovie right the water on the screen\nisn't really wet so on in its deepest\nsense this concept will allow you to\nstep out of the screen and sit in the\ntheater in your own\nlife and then the water on the screen\nwhich gets other people wet has no\neffect on you this is the essence of\nDetachment and when you guys get w\nwrapped up in something like you can't\nit's you're C like you get wet by it\nright like it affects you but then the\nmore you gain distance from it the more\nthat you when you're like oh wow this is\nunpleasant huh this is very unpleasant\nfor me\ninteresting and then that gains distance\nfrom the\nunpleasantness so now I'm going to ask\nso it's it looks\nlike has a little bit more I don't know\nif if Sam has his peel but I want you\nguys to try one more time if you can and\nwhat I want you to really notice is how\npleasant or unpleasant this is for you\nand just see you're like oh wow this is\nthis is really crappy or oh wow this is\nreally awesome and instead of sitting in\nthe awesomeness or the\ncrappiness observe it from the outside\ncan you guys try that we'll try one more\ntime just close your eyes and go for it\nand just tell yourself oh wow that's\nthis is [ __ ] disgusting\nhuh or wow this is delicious and still\ngain distance from\nit looks like he's eating the stem\nagain it's the only thing I've got I'm\nsorry it's\nokay right and just see how unpleasant\nit is notice that and accept that for\nyourself wow this is really awful I\nreally feel like spitting it\nout I really don't like\nit or oh wow this is delicious I wow I\nreally want more and just see\nthat when you've had enough you can go\nahead and come on back\neveryone in chat is impressed that you\ntook a second bite all of your own\nvaltion\nyeah poor my dude I'm so sorry\nman it's good it's good just amplifies\nthe meditation surely I hope\nokay what was that like were were you\nguys able to do that a little bit or not\nso\nmuch yeah a littleit so it's a skill so\ntell me why you took the second\nbite it's actually\nimportant because I felt like I was\nstarting\nto lose the sense of this is really\ndisgusting I want this out of my mouth\nand the whole point point was to feel\nthat so I took another bite so you guys\nget that that's\nhuge so there are two really important\nthings there one is he started to lose\nthe sense of disgustingness which is\nexactly the point of this practice\nbecause then you have power over whether\nyou eat a tomato right now the tomato\nhas power over AEL and this is what\nwe're talking about right we're talking\nabout being Beggars and not having power\nand agency in our own life\nand thus farl has been dictated to by a\n[ __ ]\ntomato the Tomato controls whether he\nenjoys a meal or\nnot he seeds that control to a piece of\nfruit that's number one and so the the\nlevel of disgustingness decreases when\nyou sit with something and then the\nother wild thing is that he had a second\nbite of the tomato\nhe was like let me go look for\ndisgusting\nthis because I've lost it let me go find\nit again and then he took a second bite\nwhich if you if you guys really I know\nthis sounds wild but like this is how\nyou change your\nlife you allow yourself to become\nsomeone who is willing to take a second\nbite of something that is\ndisgusting right I know it sounds small\nand insignificant but I'm telling you\nguys this [ __ ] is is like if you work on\nthis you will be a different\nperson and literally all it takes is\nawareness when you eat an unpleasant\nfood this is how you gain Mastery over\noneself is to be aware of the way that\nthe world affects you and to be able to\nchoose make your\ndecisions independent of how things will\naffect\nyou yeah\nhow do you know how to make a decision\nat that point\nthen excellent question excellent\nquestion excellent\nquestion right so behind Shay's question\nis because is it the pursuit of\npleasantness and the avoidance of\nunpleasantness the compass that we use\nin life ABS [ __ ] lutely Shay and that's\nwhy everyone's life is a [ __ ] train\nwreck and so that's a question that I'm\nnot going to answer for you\nyet but it's it's absolutely the right\none so let me ask you guys how are you\nguys going to find the answer to that\nquestion just keep doing the unpleasant\nstuff yep and then\nsee if you start doing unpleasant stuff\nall the\ntime then\nyou're no longer going to be avoiding it\nand then one day you're going to wake up\nand you're not going to do anything\nyou're just going to sit there the whole\nday and not take a single\naction right that's that's what Shay's\nquestion sort of implies is that if you\ntake away that driver how do you drive\nyour life and Shay that's a question\nthat as you\npractice I want you to answer because\nyou'll see what floats to the surface\nyeah um is this how you distinguish the\ndifference between things that are\npleasurable and\nmeaningful that is a question that you\nare going to answer\nat right so you guys are getting in the\nright place but we don't want to talk\nabout it\nintellectually or at least I don't want\nto because what happens is if I answer\nyour\nquestions your desire to investigate is\ngoing to go away and then you won't do\nit\nso this is another important point that\nlike when we intellectually answer\nsomething for ourselves we reduce our\nmotivation to go out and\ndo so I'm going to leave you guys\nhanging and by all means practice and\nfigure it out for\nyourself and then if you guys practice\nfor a while you know I'm sure if you\nguys catch me on an off day I'll forget\nand I'll answer your question but it's a\nvery good very good question and very\ngood\nhypothesis and and and frankly what what\nI I will say is that sometimes when I\ntry to teach people\nDetachment they get confused because\nwhat happens if I let go of my\nambition because ambition gives me so\nmuch and it causes me so much\nsuffering and if you ask me to give up\nmy ambition what will I what will I be\nit's a good\nquestion do that relate does that make\nsense Shay that that's related to your\nquestion mhm that's the other way I get\nasked\nit it's a good question so so work on\ngetting rid of your ambition and see\nwhat what's left are you just going to\nsit around and do nothing all\nday okay\nexcellent good job guys strong work\ntoday really\nimpressed really impressed really\nhopeful last questions before we wrap up\nfor the day\ncool listen so have a good weekend for\nthose of you who celebrate Thanksgiving\nI hope you have a good and safe\nThanksgiving\nholiday um and yeah good luck with\neverything I I think we're going to have\nto think about what to do so we may\nthink about so by the way for those of\nyou I I don't know if you guys know this\nand I think people kind of picked it up\nthis is the kind of work that we do in\ngroup um I don't know if you guys are in\ngroup coaching or not but I think youall\nwould be fantastic fits for it and the\nmain thing that I that I think was\nreally cool and this is the big\nmisconception is that on paper Quenton\nand and Shay feel like they're never\ngoing to\nconnect right four of y'all like so\nSam's sort of in the middle but three of\ny'all sort of feel like you know you\nwere bullied or rejected or whatever and\nShay was on the opposite end of the\nspectrum and so the the idea is that\nlike I'm not going to connect with Shay\nwhereas it in fact that's exactly what\nyou need to do right both of y'all need\nto be in the same group together we\nprobably also need to get potentially\nwomen in this group\nright that would be interesting to share\ntheir to have their\nperspective um but I I also think that\nyou know I I wonder if we should I'm\njust thinking about this and and I\nencourage you guys to think about it too\nlike think about how we can help you as\nan organization because this doesn't\nfeel like the end of a stream to me it\nstart it feels like the first step of a\njourney and I just don't know what that\nnext step looks like but like it's not\nlike I have all the answers so that's\nwhere I have to lean on you guys you\nguys tell us what what needs to happen\nnext what do you guys want next what's\nhelpful about this and what is the work\nthat needs is left\nundone because ultimately y'all are my\ncompass right you guys have to tell me\nwhat you need and then we'll work on\nbuilding it for\nyou so I mean that's very genuine so\nI'll hang around in this DM and if you\nguys have thoughts let me know\nokay okay thank you guys very much take\ncare\nokay go\neveryone okay chat"
