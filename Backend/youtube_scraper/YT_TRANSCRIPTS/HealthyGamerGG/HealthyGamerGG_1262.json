problems that\nthey're going through and i'm going to\ntry to help them out\nand today's theme is about relationships\nif you guys want to join in next time\nour uh join our discord and post\nscenarios in the channel\nask dr k there's also cool stuff on the\ndiscord like a meditation group people\nsupporting each other's mental health\nand also um you know people are\nare crushing it in league and other\ngames and for real like we offer a ton\nof workshops\num this is all community driven from\neverywhere from baking to coding\nuh we have like a room cleaning group\nthat meets once a week to kind of clean\nstuff up\nso it's it's really a place for people\nto work on themselves and acquire new\nskills and support each other so\nuh feel free to join our discord and\nmaybe submit some questions\nokay so good afternoon dr k i'm a guy\nand i'm wondering how i can get better\nhow can i better understand and\ncommunicate my feelings of attraction\nto another close guy friend he's been\none of my best friends for just about\nfour years now\nand we've even spoken about mutual\nattraction it always\nends up feeling like we've just missed\neach other i care for him deeply but\nit's\nbeen confusing and painful as well as\nvague as\nthat all is i would love to hear your\nthoughts on what attraction is\nuh what different forms are there about\nthe shame that so often can come with\nbeing gay and all\nthat can entail with a close and all\nthat can entail with a close guy friend\nreally good question okay this is a\nlittle bit tricky so let's start with\nthis so\nthe first thing that i like about this\nquestion is that i think it's a very\nwell framed question so\nas we start to think a little bit about\nyou know how do we approach\nproblems as we say a lot on stream good\ndiagnosis precedes good treatment\nand so how do you find the right\ndiagnosis\nby like asking the right question or\nordering the right test\nright so like let's take a step back and\nthink about how should we approach\nchallenges in our life so the first\nthing we should do is understand our\nchallenges but even before we understand\nchallenges we have to understand how to\nunderstand challenges\nand so in medicine you know they teach\nus like the art of diagnosis which is\nall about asking the right questions or\nordering the right tests\nso what i really like about this\nquestion is actually this first part\nover here\nwhich is i'm wondering how can i better\nunderstand and\ncommunicate my feelings of attraction so\nthe first thing you've got to do is\nbetter understand your feelings of\nattraction\nokay so\nand then before you communicate them\nyou've got to understand kind of where\nyou are and you don't have to understand\neverything fully\nbut but in order to communicate\neffectively you have to understand\neffectively and so let's\num let's think a little bit about this\nso i also like that\nthat you know this person has multiple\nshades of feeling which is probably\ncloser to the truth\nthan like one directional so we see this\na lot where people will say\ni'm deeply deeply in love with someone\nand like what they'll say is like it's\nall like\none directional and it's very intense\nand that oftentimes gets people into\ntrouble\nwhen all they sort of recognize is one\nshade of color in terms of their\ninternal environment\num and so you know it's interesting\nbecause it sounds like you care about\nhim a lot\nit sounds like um you know\nyou care about him as a friend uh\nfrankly it sounds like you could be in\nlove dude\num and so you know i think it's\nimportant to just ask yourself that\nquestion like am i in love like you do\nyou know what it's\nlike to be in love if not this really\ncould be it\nand that it's confusing and painful as\nwell so i think it's really good that\nyou sort of understand all those\ndifferent parts about\nhimself i mean yourself\nand so um\n[Music]\nand it sounds like you guys have kind of\nlike even\ngotten into the discussion a little bit\nright so it says we've spoken about\nmutual attraction\nand it always ends up feeling like we've\nmissed each other so that i think is an\nimportant feeling so i\ni wonder if what's going on here is that\nlike the two of you actually\nare interested or do have some kind of\nromantic feelings for each other but\nthat\nneither of you feels comfortable enough\nto like put yourself\nout on a limb and risk like ruining the\nfriendship\nto see if there's more to your\nrelationship\nand i i could sort of imagine that like\nyou know\nyour friend could be feeling exactly the\nsame way which is that you guys are\nreally\nreally good friends your your friendship\nmatters a lot\nto you it matters a lot to him that\nthere's\nit sounds like you guys have sort of\ntalked about being attracted to each\nother\num and then neither of you has been\nwilling to sort of like\nstep into that vulnerable space and say\nlike hey\ndo you want to actually try something\nhere um\nand so you know i think the way to\napproach this\nis first of all to understand like what\ndo you really feel about him is are\nyou you know or because it's possible to\nbe\nreally good friends with someone and\nphysically attracted to them\nbut like not have a romantic component\nright so like we see that in platonic\nrelationships all the time where like\nyou may be attracted\nto you know someone of the opposite sex\nassuming you're heterosexual\nand you guys could be really good\nfriends but like you guys wouldn't\nactually like\nbe a good relationship or there isn't\nactually a romantic feeling\num and so that's possible so i think the\nfirst thing to figure out is you know\njust ask yourself\nand it's like one of these gut checks\nright like am i\nsecretly in love with this person and\ni'm just scared to admit it\nand if the answer is yes then i don't\nknow that i would go about sharing that\ndirectly with the person but i think\nprobably the best way to approach this\nis to have a conversation\nand say you know hey i care about you a\nlot\nas a friend and i find myself being\nattracted to you and i feel like\nwe keep on missing each other and maybe\nthere's a chance for\na relationship but i also value your\nfriendship and i\ni don't i kind of don't want to risk\nthat and then\nask an open-ended question what do you\nthink about that\nso this is something that we often teach\nour coaches which is that like they'll\ncome to me with a question\nand they'll say i have a client who\num you know it feels like like i had a\ncase the other day so one of the coaches\nhad a little bit of trouble with this it\nwas kind of talking it through and they\nsaid that\nyou know i have a client who kind of\ncame in and wanted to work on a goal\nbut um you know the goal is like\nsomething that's really painful for them\nso i'm not really sure\nlike how to talk about it because any\ntime we sort of bring it up like my\nclient gets emotional and i'm not sure\nlike what to do\nso it seems like talking about it is\nhurtful to them but at the same time\nthat's what they're here to to work on\nso these negative emotions come to the\nsurface and i don't know what to do\nand what i would tell that coach or what\ni did tell that coach is that's exactly\nwhat you should say to your client\nright say hey like i know you're here to\nwork on this but\nevery time we kind of bring it up like\nit seems painful for you which is\nexactly why you want to work on it but\nat the same time i sort of feel like i\ndon't know if i should push you or not\nbecause it seems like it hurts and i\ndon't want to\nsay anything that's going to be like\nhurtful to you and at the same time we\nhave to work on it so kind of\nenroll them in your decision-making\nprocess right so like too much about\nwhat what problems we run into in\nrelationships is like when one person\nmakes\nall the decisions right so what i mean\nby that is like a good example of this\nis like friend zoning\nwhere or girlfriend zoning right where\nlike one person\nall on their own builds up all these\nthoughts and feelings and hopes and\ndreams\nand you're all like in your mind you\nlike create this whole\nworld about who this other person is and\nyou fall in love with that person and\nall the wonderful and it's like all in\nyour head and the other person doesn't\nhave any like say so in what you create\nin your mind\nit's not like a mutual relationship that\nyou've created and i know that sounds\nweird that we you know aren't all\nrelationships mutual no\nright sometimes we create all these\nrelationships in our head that are\nsort of like solo relationships and you\nbuild up all these like ideas about who\nthis person is like you meet this girl\nand she's nice to you and you're like oh\nmy god she's the one\nand so what i think you should do is\nlike let your friend be a part of this\nprocess right so like tell him like hey\nman this is what's going on with me\ni value your friendship i feel like i'm\nattracted to you\nwe've kind of touched on it before but\nlike you know i feel like we keep on\nmissing each other and i'm not sure if\nthis is worth exploring or not\nwhat do you think because the foundation\nof a successful relationship\nabsolutely is communication because it's\nlike two people\nright so you've got to like work with\nthem and if you want it to work\ni think a good way to start like a good\nsolid foundation for a relationship is\nlike the tui all sitting down and\ndeciding\nhey do we want to try this or not is\nthere something here or not\nand recognize that you yourself are\ngoing to be afraid of rejection\nright and that you don't want to like so\nlike\nkind of notice that too but it sounds\nlike you guys have gotten close for\nbeen close for a while and you all have\nbeen friends for four years so\nyou know a little bit of rejection can\nhurt but hopefully it won't\nyou know torpedo the relationship that\ni've never really heard of\num you know i've never heard of a\nrelationship\nwhere one person sort of explores their\nfeelings with the other person and the\nrelationship just crumbles apart after\nfour years\ni've certainly heard about relationships\nwhere you catch feelings for someone\nand then you are deeply in love and then\nlike you guys used to be friends but now\nyou're deeply in love and that sort of\nfalls apart because\nyou can't be friends with them anymore\nbecause of your feelings but\nyou know i don't know if we're here if\nthat's what this scenario is\nso i'd say overall you know the way to\napproach it is just to have a\nconversation where you basically say\nexactly what you said to me\nand what you post the way you posted\nyour question and then you explore it\nwith your friend and you guys kind of\nfigure it out together\nas vegas that all is i would love to\nhear your thoughts on what attraction is\nwhat different forms are there and about\nshame that so often comes with being gay\nand all that can entail with a close guy\nfriend\nokay let's talk about what what\nattraction is\ni mean i'm not an expert in this but\ni'll toss out a couple of different\nideas right so one is like physical\nattraction\num and that's just like you're\nphysically attracted to someone\nsomeone's\nyou know the way that they look or\nsomething about them like appeals to you\nsort of like on a\nphysical and biological level\nthen there's also you know more of like\nemotional attraction so as you get to\nknow\nsomeone and this happens a lot with men\nso\nyou know as as you start to express\nemotional intimacy\nmen are rarely taught to express\nemotional\nintimacy outside of like very close\nnuclear\nintimate relationship so you may express\nemotional intimacy towards your parents\nmaybe your siblings and then like the\nother thing\nother place that you express emotional\nintimacy is with\nromantic partners so sometimes what can\nhappen is emotional intimacy can get\nconfused as attraction\nand and what i mean by that is that like\nif if you have a female friend\nand you guys are emotionally kind of\nintimate with each other\nand we hear this a lot from you know\nbitter dudes on the internet where they\nsay like i was there for all of her\nemotional needs\nand then she friend zoned me and it's\nlike yeah that's sort of\nthat's sort of true but i think the\nconfusing thing there is that like\nfor a lot of women and i'm just sort of\nusing the kind of heteronormative\naverage person here so women are taught\nto be emotionally\nintimate outside of romantic\nrelationships and men are not\nso like what what being emotionally\nintimate with a woman sort of entitles\nyou to is not\nnecessarily a romantic relationship but\nyou to be emotionally intimate with them\nwithout a romantic relationship which\ncan be really confusing for us because\nwe're not taught\nhow to like do that right it's kind of\nconfusing for us\nso um you know i think there's there's\nan emotional attraction which can grow\ninto love but oftentimes is confused\nwith sort of emotional intimacy\nand then uh you know the third thing\nthat i'll say i know we don't really\ntalk about this much because it's not\nvery scientific um\nis is i i do think that there's like a\nspiritual attraction so just my personal\nexperience has been like i fell deeply\nin love with i didn't understand what it\nwas but\ni felt deeply in love with my wife like\nliterally the first time i saw her and i\ndidn't even understand what i was\nfeeling like\ni remember i still remember the moment\nwhere i was like walking\noutside and i was walking past a picnic\nbench and she was like walking the other\nway and i i just saw her\nand it felt like someone had slammed me\nin the chest\nand it was just a weird [ __ ] feeling\nand like i didn't understand what the\n[ __ ] happened\nand then like i didn't even talk to her\nfor three years like i didn't know who\nshe was it was just like\ni don't know what that was that was\nweird\num and and so\nyou know i i i do sort of like believe\nin this weird destiny kind of crap like\ni know it's not scientific i know it\ndoesn't make a whole lot of sense\ni know it's old-fashioned but my own\nexperience has just been\nso altering that like i do believe in\nthat\ni mean it's weird um but i i do sort of\nyou know think that that's an important\nthing to acknowledge whether it's\nreal or not i don't really know i i\nstill don't know\nyou know whether it's real um but i\nthink that if we're trying to understand\nthe lenses to view attraction through\nit's important to acknowledge that\nsome people do have experiences where\nthey feel like\ntheir attraction to another person is\nlike\ndestiny or fate or like whatever that\nthey were like destined to be together\nand there's only one person in the world\nfor them and we see that\nin our stories right like they're like\nall these hopeless romantics out there\nand so there's something about the human\ncondition where people interpret it that\nway i'm not saying that it's like\ncosmically true what i'm saying is that\nif you look at human behavior that's\nsomething that you\nhave to acknowledge right you have to\nacknowledge that people consistently\nhave this experience\nand that this is like an archetype that\nruns through our stories and our history\nas human beings\nso i think that there is that sort of\nspiritual kind of attraction\nand then i'd also say that like this is\nwhere things get really confusing\nbecause a lot of times\nwhat happens is we feel that emotional\nintimacy\nand we kind of confuse emotional\nintimacy\nfor that faded love right and that gets\nreally tricky because how do you\nunderstand what the difference is and\nthen the short answer there is that i\nthink the more tranquil your mind\nthe more you'll be able to differentiate\nis this some kind of attachment that i\nhave that's out of proportion or is this\nlike actually like destiny\nthat we're supposed to be together and i\nthink the more\ncalm you are and the more detached you\nare\nthe better you're going to be at telling\nwhich one is which\nand then the last thing which i just\nwant to touch on because it's like sort\nof a neuroscience take on it\nis i just want to talk to you guys a\nlittle bit about oxytocin because i\nthink this is an important part of\nattraction\nso oxytocin um is a hormone that sort of\ndeals with emotional bonding\nso for example uh you know there\nare a lot of hormones that lead to milk\nproduction for\nnew mothers and then oxytocin is the\nhormone that facilitates\nsomething called milk letdown and what\nthat means is that when a child is ready\nto feed there's actually milk in the\nbreast and then like\nthere's like a release valve when when a\nchild nurses that causes the milk\nto kind of like go you know\nleave the breast right so to be consumed\nby the child\nand so that hormone is actually oxytocin\nso oxytocin governs milk letdown\nand along with that comes a lot of\nemotional bonding so\noxytocin\nyou know i i know that this is a\nterrible thing to bring up but it's like\ncome on chat just run with me get like\nyou know stay with me for a minute okay\nlike let's not make boob jokes okay\nso oxytocin is also like the hugging\nhormone so oxytocin is a hormone that\nfacilitates\nemotional bonding and comes from things\nlike cuddling\nso oxytocin also improves our mood and\nlike\nimproves like emotional relationships um\nthere are actually some trials which\nhave found that have tried to test\nintranasal oxytocin for people with\nschizophrenia to see if they can like\nform\nbetter social interactions turns out the\ntrials really didn't\nshow a whole lot of benefit but the idea\nis that\nyou know sometimes people with\nschizophrenia have trouble forming like\nsocial relationships\nand so some people hypothesize that it's\nlike kind of an oxytocin deficiency so\nif we supplement oxytocin\nwill they be able to form relationships\nturns out clinically it doesn't seem to\nhelp much\nbut the theory is sort of there and we\nknow that oxytocin is sort of related\nto um emotional bonding\nand i don't know if you guys like cuddle\nwith stuff right so i know there's going\nto be a lot of\nyou know pepe hands here but even like a\ncat or a dog\nor you know like kids like so i have\nkids and i enjoy like cuddling with my\nkids\nand what happens is like when you do\nthat like literally you get\nyou know oxytocin being released like\nwhen you hold your child and you rock\nthem to sleep and stuff like that you\nget oxytocin release\num and oxytocin forms emotional bonds\nwith like other human beings so whenever\nyou get an oxytocin spurt\nwhoever is around you you're gonna feel\nlike emotionally bonded to\nand the reason i think this is important\nis because nowadays we have a lot of\nlike\nfluid relationships that are forming and\ni think they cause\ni have yet to really see an open\nrelationship that i would say is like\nvery successful and lasts for a long\ntime\num i'm not saying there's anything wrong\nwith open relationships it's just\nyou know i've worked with a lot of\npeople who have been in them and i think\nsomething that happens when you start\nhaving like friends with benefits and\nstuff like that is that a lot of times\nthings will get muddy like it's really\nit's a really hard tight rope to walk\nand i think part of the reason for that\nis that you know when you engage in\nsexual activity with someone\nyour brain is going to be like hey like\nlet's bond with this person like this\nperson i'm going to start caring about\nthem\nso it's almost like a hormone-mediated\nlike boost\nin how much how emotionally invested you\nare in someone\nand so you know i think that there's\nalso like a component of\nlet's forget about physical attraction\nlet's forget about emotional attraction\nor spiritual attraction\nand let's just acknowledge that if you\nhave you know a sexual relationship with\nsomeone\nor now i also hear that there are people\nwho are professional cuddlers\nthat um you're probably going to start\nto f form\nemotional bonds with these people even\nif you sort of don't\nwant to and on the fr flip side you know\nif\nthat's oftentimes what happens is even\nif you don't form the emotional bond\nbaby the person that you're physically\nlike\nyou know sexually engaged with could\nstart forming bonds with you and that's\njust it's sort of neuroscience\nit's kind of how we're wired we're wired\nto be emotionally invested\nin the people that we have sex with\nlast thing is so talking about the shame\nabout\nthat so often comes with being gay and\num\nyeah i mean you know i i\ni don't mean to be insensitive but like\ni don't really understand that right\nbecause like my experience as a\nheterosexual male\nwas that like i don't really understand\nwhat it's like to have\ni've worked with a lot of gay people\ni've worked with a lot of transgender\npeople\num i've helped them sort of find their\nsexual identity and\nand and sort of like you know i've\nhelped them through that process but i\ngot to be honest with you it's one of\nthe things that i understand the least\nlike i don't\nyou know i feel like i have a good\nunderstanding of a lot of stuff but when\nit comes to\na sexual identity like i've got a rubric\nthat i i sort of help people\nwork through um so i've sort of figured\nout like\nfrom almost like a stimulus response\nkind of way like from like a testing\nhypothesis way\nhow to help those people through those\njourney and i feel confident in being\nable to do it\nbut i also want to acknowledge that i\nactually don't know what it's like\nemotionally\nyou know to have a sexuality or identity\nthat\nis generally speaking faces a lot of\njudgment\nand a lack of acceptance and confusion\nby society\nand this is where i'd say that you know\nand i'm sorry to say i just\nyou know this is not something that i\nunderstand i wish i did i really do\nbut i i feel like i would be doing you a\ndisservice if i wasn't honest about\nsaying i don't\nknow what it's like to be gay i don't\nknow like i said i've helped people\nthrough it but i still don't really know\nwhat their experience is like\nit's sort of like i've helped deliver\nbabies but i don't know what it's like\nto be pregnant\ni don't know what it's like to go\nthrough childbirth like i just don't\nknow\nand what i would say is that like you\nknow if you do have shame with\nwith being gay and stuff like try to\nfind communities\nwe're actually thinking about starting\num you know\ntopic specific groups and and healthy\ngamer and\none of them may be sort of around\nnavigating gender identity and sexuality\nso um you know we'll keep you guys\nposted about that but i think like it's\nreally helpful to\nbe with other people who are going\nthrough your journey you don't\nnecessarily\nneed to have answers from someone who's\ngone through it and knows all\nknows everything it can be enough to be\nwith other people who are just\nas confused as you are and you guys kind\nof like work through it together which\nis really what we've seen in group\ncoaching\nokay dear dr k my name is amelia\nand i'm a 23 year old introvert who has\nnever had a boyfriend girlfriend and\nprobably never will at this rate\ni feel so stuck in this constant loop of\nfeeling like i'll\nnever find love or even experience it i\nlook around me at my friends or even\nsiblings\nand they have never suffered from this\nproblem is there something wrong with me\nis there something i didn't learn or\nmiss out on\nwhy am i so out of the loop everyone\naround me is either in a relationship\nthey have kids they are married\nalmost everyone has at least experienced\nlove once before in their lives\ni feel like such a loser it's so\nembarrassing to even think about\ni've never even kissed anyone and let\nalone anything further than that\nit hurts when you realize you've been\nmissing out on these things in your life\nthings that everyone experiences i want\nsomething real i just want i just want\nthat feeling of being happy with someone\nbut also knowing that i make someone\nelse happy\nwhat is pulling me back so much i feel\nlike i just sabotaged myself\nanytime i get any hopeful opportunity ah\nsee good\nour community is evolving chat like\nthey're starting to be reflective\nso this is what i want to say like i\njust want to pause for a second\nthis first half we've heard a lot\nright we hear this a lot it's awesome\nthat this person gives us the second\nparagraph we haven't even read it yet\nbut like do you guys see how this person\nis setting up the question\nand then they're already exploring a\nhypothesis so this is awesome i\nactually feel really hopeful for amelia\nat this point i know it sounds weird\nbut just the fact that like you know\nyou're starting to\nit's okay to have problems in life it's\nokay to ask questions in life\nand then taking that next step to start\nto figure out like let me at least think\nabout this like what have i observed\nwhat have i noticed that's ultimately\nthe strategy that i think leads to\nsuccess\nso let's see what they have to say i\nfeel like i just sabotaged myself\nanytime i get any hopeful opportunity\ni've been asked out on dates but i've\nnever actually\nbeen or gone to one\nokay i get so scared and anxious that\nsomething will happen to me\nand i end and i end up making excuse or\ncancelling\ni feel guilty if i'm even if i even\nthink about accepting the date\ni feel guilty that i would be wasting\nthis person's time if i did accept and\nended up not seeing them again\ni'm extremely scared of even the thought\nof getting into a relationship with\nsomeone or even trying to\ni feel like since i've gone this long\nwithout finding someone if i did get\ninto a relationship with someone\nthen it would have to be perfect but i\nnever even give it a chance or even try\ni have this impending doom that i will\nbe taken advantage of and be used\ni just don't understand what makes me do\nthis or feel this way\ni yearn for a real relationship so much\nand wonder\nhow it feels to experience but my head\nautomatically tells me otherwise\nthat it will never happen and if it did\nhappen that it would go wrong\ni tell myself that i'm happy being alone\nand single but deep down i know i'm not\ni just need help and guidance on how to\nlove and trust again\ndamn this is a good question chat\nso this is interesting right so like\nlet's look at the language\nfirst so i want you guys to notice\num the extremities of this person's\nthinking\nso uh never had a boyfriend\nprobably never constant\nnever\nnever everyone\nalmost everyone\nnever sabotage myself\nanytime i've never\nokay\nhave to be perfect never even give it a\nchance\nimpending doom sort of qualifies i think\nautomatically never\nso this is interesting right because\nthey say i just need help and guidance\non how to love and trust\nagain now we could be i could be making\na mountain out of a molehill\nhere right so like when i see all these\nnevers\ni would imagine that the last sentence\nshould say i just need\nhelp and guidance on learning how to\nlove and trust\nright so that that's what you would\nexpect like if someone has never done\nanything before\nthen you would expect them like that\nthey don't it's not that they lost\nsomething it's that they never had it\nbut what i'm hearing here is that i just\nneed help and\nand guidance on how to love and trust\nagain\nand this sort of makes sense with me\nbecause we have i have a running\nhypothesis here that\nsomething happened to this person right\nso like all these thoughts and feelings\nthat they have that\nyou know they clearly want this and yet\nsomething in their mind is telling them\nthat like they get really scared or\nanxious they feel like they're not going\nto live up to the other person's time\nthey feel like they\nif they did accept they have to be\nperfect they have to commit\nthat the first date is the person that\nthey have to spend the rest of their\nlife with\nso then the question becomes like where\ndo these thoughts and beliefs and\nfeelings come from\nand and my guess would be that there's\nsomething that happened\npotentially traumatic to this person\nlike early on\nwhere you know they got taught in some\nway shape or form that they're different\nthat they aren't worth it that they're\nnot good enough that they have to be\nperfect\nthat and the interesting thing here is\nlike needing to be perfect\nis about not being yourself right like\nwhy does someone need to be perfect if\nyou guys feel like you need to be\nperfect\nif you really tunnel down into that what\nyou see is that\nneeding to be perfect has can only be\ntrue\nif what you are is not worth much\nright so what this really comes down to\nis where did this person\nlearn that they're not worth much\nlike where did this person lose their\nself-esteem and lose\ntheir confidence in themselves so they\ncan't afford to be themselves right do\nyou guys get that like that what this\nperson is saying is that\ni can't afford to be me i can't be\nmyself\nit has to be like this way that i see\neverywhere around me\npeople are in all these perfect\nrelationships and i'm not because\nthere's something fundamentally wrong\nwith me\nand we can kind of see it here because\nlike you know\nthey've never suffered from this problem\nlike so first of all i don't think\nthat's true\nis there something wrong with me like\nthat's what this person feels right this\nis\nthis is a question that is born out of\nan emotion\nis there something i didn't learn or\nmiss out on why am i so out of the loop\nso like this is\nthat's the question you've got to answer\nright so so the way i'd approach this if\nyou guys feel stuck\nwith something like this in life and\nthis is what we\nwe do with people by the way um so i\nthink like this actually is a great\nperson for\nfor group coaching this is a great group\ncoaching candidate so concretely what\ni'd say amelia is that you should think\nabout signing up for group coaching\nbecause and here's why so like the\nproblem is that that this person thinks\nthat they're alone\nright like that i'm the only one who's\never experienced this like this is only\nme\nand so what happens is they they show up\nand they say like since this is a\nproblem that no one else suffers from\nyou know i want to do personal coaching\nand i think one of the personal coaching\nis great don't get me wrong but i think\none of the most\nvaluable lessons this person can learn\nis when they show up in a group\nand they say this everyone else is like\noh [ __ ] this is exactly like me\nand then you have 10 people who all feel\nthis way that there's something\nfundamentally busted with them\nthat the rest of the world is normal and\nthat like i'm\nmessed up in some way or i like missed\nthat day of class where you learn how to\nhave a relationship\nand then there's there's a value to that\nlike sure you can work with a personal\ncoach about the origin of your feelings\nand stuff but\nthere's a value to realizing like oh\n[ __ ]\nthis is actually like there are other\npeople who work through this\nand then something really cool starts to\nhappen because then you guys can work on\nit together right\nand then you guys can kind of explore\nwith each other and you haven't figured\namelia hasn't figured this picture out\nbut she's figured out pieces do you guys\nget this like\nhere are the here's the questions here's\na hypothesis\nand then when you get eight people who\nform eight hypotheses and you guys kind\nof work them together\nthen you get like an answer floats to\nthe surface\nand so my first thought emilia is like\nyou should sign up for group coaching\nand bring this to your group and see\nwhat they have to say about it\nsecond thing is i'll tell you like what\nyou know what i would do if i was\nrunning this group\nis i'd asked you like when did you start\nlike did you always feel like you were\ndifferent did you always feel like you\nwere out of the loop or\ndid your feeling of being out of the\nloop start at a particular point\nand the really tricky thing here is that\nwhen i asked when did it start\na lot of people assume that it has to be\nlike\na large traumatic event\nlike they just assumed that like oh no\nnothing like super traumatic no that's\nnot how it works\nit's usually a very very small and\nseemingly insignificant thing\nbut when you're young when you're like\nfive or six\num and and like something happens to you\nlike you start this like the seed is\nplanted in your mind that you're\ndifferent\nand then what happens is that seed gets\nwatered by like small experience after\nsmall experience after a small\nexperience\nand then it even gets further watered\nwhen you look around and as a cognitive\nbias starts to form in your mind and\nthen you look around\nand you start making these statements\nlike they have never never suffered from\nthis problem\nthat's not true right like it's just not\ntrue but that's what your mind tells you\nand then what happens is you start to\nhave a lens through which you look at\nthe world\nand the more that you look at the world\nthrough this lens the more it reinforces\nyour core belief about yourself and then\nyou're giving it a lot of water\na lot of water and then it's growing and\nit's growing and it's growing and it's\nbig\nand it feels huge it feels like this\ninsurmountable problem\nand then you have to so what you have to\ndo is you really have to go back and try\nto figure out like where did you start\nto feel this way about yourself\nright where did you when did you start\nto learn that you are\ndifferent and that other people you know\nlearned\nlearned something that you didn't learn\nthat you're broken in some way\nthat some some part of your brain just\nisn't working\nand so i think the more that you kind of\nexplore that you'll begin to realize\nthat like\nthat feeling is like a holdover or an\necho from a past experience it's not\nnecessarily true today\nbut what's happening is like each of\nthese experiences forms a little bit of\nan echo in your mind\nand then after a thousand of these\nexperiences you've got this cacophony\nthat feels really overwhelming in your\nmind and dominates your thinking\nbut the funny thing is that all of the\nenergy for those echoes if you stop\nfeeding it it'll actually all die out\nright in order to have that sustained\necho you have to create new sounds\nand so this is where you've got to kind\nof explore where that comes from\nand the second thing is that you know i\nwould really consider\nexploring your feelings when you do get\nasked out\nbecause like this is important i get so\nscared and anxious that something will\nhappen to me and i make up\ni end up making an excuse canceling so\nwhen we approach problems\nlike our you know my approach to\nproblems healthy gamer approach problems\none is to find the root and one is to\nwork in the present\nso recognize that like you can ignore\nthe root of this\nif you can learn a little bit more about\nhow to not\nlet your feelings control your behaviors\nand so it doesn't matter what you think\nor you believe or you feel\nthe the basic problem here it sort of\ndoesn't matter whether you feel like\nyou're overweight so you're anorexic and\nyou don't eat food\nor you feel like you're overweight and\nso you're refused to socialize with\nother people\ni had anxious thoughts about my growth\ntoday and i was like should i shave and\ni was like ah\nwhat right so we all have thoughts and\nfeelings that prompt us to things\ni thought about cancelling stream\nbecause i can't shave right now\nand i was afraid of how i would look and\nso you can have these feelings that can\ncause you to want certain behaviors\nand then understanding in that moment\nhow do you\nlike what is this feeling that like\nis is so strong that you want to make up\nan excuse or cancel\nand then in my experience what happens\nis um as you tunnel down\ninto your emotion in the present\nthe more carefully you look at it the\nmore you realize that it's not\nbased on a solid foundation that it's\nsort of like this feeling\nin and of itself it's like a\nself-contained entity and it's not\nreally based on like\nsomething real which i know feels really\nstrange\nbecause the feeling itself is real but\nthe more that you look into it the more\nthat you tunnel down into it the more\nyou're going to realize\nthat the the emotion is like an entity\nof its own that's\npushing you to do something but it's\nactually not like reality it's just your\nemotion\nright that's what happens when you're\nlike emotions make you feel like things\nare real\neven though they're not and a good\nexample of this for people who are\nseverely depressed\nthey have this feeling that they're\nworthless and that\ntheir like children would be better off\nif they weren't alive\nwhich is a crazy thought and is\nabsolutely untrue\nbut in that moment that person\nfeels like that thought is absolutely\ntrue and you have to dig\ninto that thought you have to dig into\nthat feeling until you begin to realize\nactually hold on a second of course my\nkids love me\nof course they would be better off if i\nwas here\nbut you're not going to realize that\nuntil you dig into that feeling in the\nmoment\nand so i'd say is try to find the root\nand the second thing is you know try to\nfigure out like what's going on\nin these moments where you pull back\nand as best as you can try to let\nyourself\nnot pull back and choose the kind of\npath that feels painful to you in\nin that in that mode right like\neven if you you know because there are a\nlot of thoughts and feelings here which\nwith i think which i think are really\nlike cognitive distortions like if i did\nget into a relationship with someone\nthen it would have to be perfect no it\ndoesn't there's no such thing\nyou know like\nand some of this stuff is some of these\nfears are born of lack of experience\nit's sort of like\nyou know if you've never been in the\nlike if you've never been in a swimming\npool you may be afraid that you're gonna\ndrown the second your foot goes into the\nwater and it's sort of a reasonable\nthought even though it's like not true\nbut like you just haven't done it yet so\nyou're not really sure\nand so acknowledge for a moment that\nlike you actually\nare inexperienced so a lot of your\nconclusions are likely to be wrong\nand and just kind of work through that\nstuff but i think there's really two\nangles here one is to\num you know really try to figure out\nwhere you got these thoughts or feelings\nand the second\nis fine they're here now how can you\nstart to work on not letting them\ncontrol you\nand very practically i'd say that\nmeditation is a very good tool to start\nto explore yourself\ni think if you want to see a therapist\ni'd highly recommend cognitive\nbehavioral therapy\nin in this case like try that out if you\nhaven't tried it already\nbecause cognitive behavioral therapy\nhelps you understand the relationship\nbetween your thoughts\nyour emotions and your behaviors\nthird thing that you can do is sign up\nfor group coaching\nbecause i think you'll be surprised to\nlearn that you're not that\nalone um and then\nthat other people will help you work\nthrough this\nand i think the other really important\nthing that that i like\na lot about group is that there's a lot\nof value which i think we\nunderestimate to being able to help\nsomeone else\nand so you know what amelia really needs\nmore than anything else is to have\nsomeone else in group\nwho feels similarly to what she does and\nand amelia needs to\nhelp this person right help this person\nfind confidence\nand that in of itself is going to give\nher the most confidence\nokay two other thoughts one is\nbut my head automatically tells me\notherwise so this is important\nbecause what i want amelia to understand\nis that this is not actually you\nright so do you guys see how sometimes\nshe uses the first person\nand sometimes she uses the third person\nto talk about her head\nand that's what i mean that this emotion\nis like a separate thing\nit's not actually the real you it's like\nsome some scar\nit's a samskar or like some automatic\nprogramming some malware\nin your cognition that tells you\notherwise it's just like some [ __ ]\nmalware\nthat's like sending you pop-ups it's not\nactually you\nand so that understanding and the more\nthat you begin to realize that\nthe more freedom you're gonna gain from\nit okay\nthe second thing is i want you guys to\nnotice how future focused amelia is\nlike she's paralyzed in the present\nbecause so much of the future is\ndetermined by the now\nif she goes out with someone it would be\na waste of time if she ended up not\nseeing them again\nif she goes out with someone she has to\nbe perfect for the rest of her life\nit's like she's putting she's the weight\nof a perfect future is being weighed\nin her mind against the present\nand so how is she expected to\nright so i want you guys to be really\ncareful when you do this this is a\nreally important point\ndon't weigh the future against the\npresent don't do it\nbecause when you weigh the entirety of a\nfuture\nagainst the present moment the future is\nalways going to win\nso like i i we we had a question or\nsomething someone was talking about\nyou know being 27 and and wanting to\nfinish college\nand they were like thinking about like\nhow embarrassing it would like in in the\nmoment when they're trying to think\nabout okay\nshould i re-enroll in college i'm 27\nyears old\nand in that moment what they're doing is\nthey're weighing all of the future\nof that right like if i go to college\ni'm going to be older than everyone\ni may be the same age as like my\nteaching assistants and they're like all\nof these future things that they're\nthinking about\ni'm going to be like a 29 year old\ncollege graduate it's going to be so\nembarrassing and they they pile on all\nof these future\npossibilities pile and pile and pile and\npile\nand then like that gets weighed against\nthe present which is like do i just\nignore\nmy problems for a moment for one more\nday and do i just queue up\nfor whatever i'm playing so anytime you\nweigh the future against the present the\nweight\nof all of the future against the present\nyou're going to lose\nyou won't it's absolutely paralyzing\nand so start by acknowledging that like\nwhat you're doing today is just going on\na date\nthat's all it is is there gonna be\nanother date\nwho knows do you have to be perfect\nwho knows all you're doing is you're\nmeeting with someone\nthat's all you're doing because that's\nliterally all you're doing\nand to really let go of the expectation\nof everything in your mind about what\nneeds to happen\nin the future or what is going to happen\nin the future because you have no idea\nyou can't predict the future are you\npsychic amelia\nbut that's what your mind tells you your\nmind tells you oh my goodness\ni know exactly what's going to happen\nif you say yes to this person they're\ngoing to take advantage of you\nand you won't like them and you'll be\nstuck in a relationship right so there's\nanother some scar here you guys are\npaying attention\nabout her being stuck she's afraid of\nbeing stuck\nyou guys see that why\nwhy can't she get into a relationship\nbecause she's afraid of being trapped\nit may not be like low self-esteem so\none option is low self-esteem the other\nroute here is that\nshe may have gotten stuck with something\nwith someone a relationship that she\ndidn't want\noh oh man i'm so glad we found this one\ni read this post on my on my um on on\nthe subreddit and i was tempted to\nrespond to it there\ni love this this is a great post um and\ni think this is the kind of thing that\nwe should\nreally think about having someone on\nstream to sort of talk about this sort\nof thing\num struggling between only fans or love\ndating\ni was lurker here for months awesome\nthanks for posting\nonly fans or gf um\ni'm seeking someone who can try to\nunderstand me\ncool welcome to our community my dude\ni've noticed very kind and compassionate\nreplies here so i figured i should post\nmy story here hopefully you got\nkind and compassionate replies and\ndidn't get a bunch of trolls but\ni've been having a thing with only fans\ngirls for the last three years it\nstarted after i was dumped by my\ngirlfriend when i was 21\nit felt like it filled a hole in me\nthat's what only fans does\neven though i'm aware the love is fake\nit feels real\nthat's also a very good analysis\ni can choose who will love me i can\nchoose to pause or leave my only fan's\ngirl\nit's so much freedom and it felt real\nenough but it has cost me\nover 10k which is almost all i had in my\nbank after working a lot at my father's\ncompany during\nmy childhood i started dating a girl\nrecently and even though it\nit's great it feels icky i want to\nswitch her\noff sometimes i want to be able to\nchoose or date other women sometimes\ni feel like i'd rather have the\nshallowness of only fans than to feel\nlike i'm in a cage with one woman for\nthe rest of my life\ni don't want to enter a relationship\nwith her and at the same time\nhave my only fans thing going on that\nwouldn't be fair for the girl irl\nbut i just don't want to give up only\nfans i'm working a lot during college to\nbe able to pay for it and it's worth it\nit feels shameful since no one seems to\nunderstand me\nokay this is a fantastic post okay\nso here's what i like about this post so\nfirst of all\nthis is a real issue i was about to say\nproblem but i'm going to say issue\nthat a lot of people struggle with right\nso like if we think about why is only\nfans so popular\nright it's because it makes people feel\na certain way\nwhich they control it's a faucet of love\nand all you have to do is pay for it\nwhich is fine because that's what we do\nfor things that we like right\nit's a faucet of love so\ni really commend this person for coming\nout of the woodwork because i think that\nthis is a\nfar bigger problem than people realize\nprecisely because it\nis so shaming right so so like if\nlike if you try to talk to someone in\nreal life about this problem\nboy are you going to get a ton of\njudgment all you're going to get like no\none's going to help you they're just\ngoing to\njudge you and i\nwhat i really like about the so first of\nall\nincredibly courageous to post this i\nthink it's going to make the world a\nbetter place by posting this because\nit's a problem that a lot of people\nstruggle with\num next thing that i really commend\nabout this post is that there's actually\na lot of really awesome insight\nin here right like even though i'm aware\nthe love is fake it feels real\nyou know what you like about this i get\nto choose who will love me\nit's a lot of freedom and it felt real\nenough\nand then like even this person's dating\nagain and then like you recognize like\noh like\nyour brain is sort of like comparing the\nreal girl to the only fans girl and what\nit's saying is like we're getting some\nof the same stuff here\nbut i much prefer the situation where i\nget to turn it off when i want to\num i want to be able to choose or date\nother women sometimes\nyes or that's another thing about only\nfans right it's not exclusive\nyou get to have multiple faucets\nand then this is this is i think the\nreally strong\nsentence i feel like i'd rather have the\nshallowness of only fans\nthan to feel like i'm in a cage with one\nwoman for the rest of my life\nright it's really hard\nto be really non-judgmental about your\nfeelings here and\nthat's what i think this is really great\nabout this post is the person is like\nadmitting he's like i know this sounds\nreally bizarre\nand i know it sounds kind of like you\nknow shameful\nbut i actually like the shallowness\ni don't want to give it up it actually\nmeans something to me it's not like\nthey're\nbecause usually what we see is like a\nlot of self-judgment and blame and like\ni i can't stop i really want to stop\nyou know like you know\nyou know like people are very judgmental\ntowards themselves whereas this person\nsays\nthis does something for me and i\nactually really like it\nand i'm going to admit to myself that i\nreally like it i don't\ni just don't want to give it up\nit's worth it right and this is what's\nreally important to understand\nabout like addictive and destructive\nbehaviors\nis that like the reason we keep doing\nthem is because the payoff is huge\nright when we think about an addiction\nwe think about it as a negative thing\nbut the one thing that has i think made\nme the one lesson that has made me an\neffective\naddiction clinician an effective\naddiction psychiatrist\nis the acknowledgement the addiction\nisn't a bad thing it's a good\nthing it's a solution it's not a problem\nright like the reason that an addiction\nis so hard to kick is because it\ntakes your problems away\nit's an escape it's like like imagine\nhow opi it is it's like god mode it's\nlike i have all these negative emotions\nand feelings\nand i feel like i'm a waste of space in\nthe universe\nand i can drink this alcohol or i can\nplay this video game and boom\ngod mode all those feelings go away\nand so like this it's hard to admit\nthat that the only fans means a lot to\nyou\nbut i think that's the first step right\nthe first thing you have to do is like\nacknowledge your enemy\nit's like back in the day when people\nused to like bow before dueling like\nthis is what you guys need to do\nif you guys are facing the problem the\nfirst thing you need to do is respect it\nbow because you're about to rumble\nand it's like it's gonna be a tough\nfight but respect it respect what the\nonly fans does for you\nthe next thing is that this person is\nalso falling into the trap so i don't\nknow if you guys caught this but we\nwe've already talked about this so\nwhat's the principle here chat i feel\nlike i'd rather have the shallowness of\nonly fans than to feel like i'm in a\ncage\nwith one woman for the rest of my life\nwhat is this guy doing here\nabsolutely so\nno wonder right all of the future\nit's like if i give up only fans\ni'm saddled with one person for 40 years\n50 years 60 years 70 years\nwhen if you really stop and ask this\nperson you know how do you do you want a\nrelationship like a loving relationship\nfor 40 50 60 years they may say yes to\nthat question we don't know\nand so i think also this person's like a\ndecent dude because he\nhe realized i'm assuming that he's a man\nbut um\nyou know that he's trying to be fair to\nthe girl in real life\num and\nyeah i mean i i think it's it's tough so\ni think there are a couple of\nprinciples here so the first is like you\nknow once again don't compare the\nentirety of the future\nto your present circumstance because\nthat's a battle you're never going to\nwin the future's always going to win\nyou don't have to date one person for\nthe rest of your life\nso the other thing is like i don't know\nif this person is dating exclusively\nlike this other person exclusively like\nwhoever their irl\ngirl is but like it's possible like you\nknow a lot of people will date\na couple of women at the same time to\nfigure out or a couple\nwomen will date a couple of men whatever\nor men will date a couple of men right\nit's not like\nthere's still this idea of like going\nsteady or being exclusive which\nnowadays is you know people understand\nthat sometimes you're\ngoing on dates with multiple people so\nthat's\nacceptable you know\nand then i i i mean i think this person\nis pretty far\nalong the way right i think that like\nthis is this is definitely something\nwhere they understand\nwhat only fans does for them like they\nget it\nit means a lot to them and i'm not going\nto disagree\nand so oddly enough i feel like this is\nthe kind of thing where this person has\ndemonstrated so much insight that i\nthink like\nthe next phase is actually questions i\ndon't really have a whole lot of advice\nyou know i'm not gonna say i mean i\nthink you should quit only fans because\ni think it's like\nwhat happens with the only fans is that\nthey've figured out\nhow to you know activate some parts of\nyour brain without\nthe rest of it so they figured out how\nto make you feel like you have a\nrelationship without it\nactually being a relationship\nright so they scratch that positive itch\nwithout some of the other stuff\nso my concern for this person is that\nyou know the end of the day like if you\nhurt your back\ni don't think the only fans girls are\ngonna come and like take care of you\nand when i think about a relationship i\ndon't think about the positives i think\nabout\nthe negatives like the real advantage of\na relationship is like\nwhen your chips are down i'm thinking\nabout sort of a committed monogamous\nrelationship that is\nright when you're sick like who's gonna\ntake care of you\nand the other thing is that you know i i\nknow that only fans is\nyou know it's like video and stuff right\nlike in pictures\nbut like i i don't know if people\nactually you know not to be in delicate\nbut i don't know if people get laid\nthrough only fans or not but like i\nthink actual physical connection\nwith another human being in a sexual way\nis like an important part of life\nand going back to the oxytocin so not\njust sexual connection but like you know\nbeing held and hugged and cared for like\nall those things are important too\nand so i think what you're doing is\nyou're investing a lot\ninto these online relationships that do\n[Music]\nabsolutely\nfill a hole and they do a good job of\ndoing it which is why it's so successful\nbut they're not going to fill the other\nholes and the real problem here is that\nwhen you fill one hole so completely\nit's easy to forget about the other\nholes\nand then if we really think about\ngetting free of this the real question\nis like you're not going to be free from\nthis curse\nuntil you process the hole that was left\nby the\nfirst girlfriend when she broke up with\nyou\nso if you really want to be free from\nthis that's what you have to fix\nright because if she left a hole in your\nheart you've got to patch up that hole\notherwise only fans girls are going to\nkeep filling it\nonce that hole is no longer there your\nchances of being free from only fans are\na lot\nbetter so i think the real question that\nyou need to ask yourself because he's\ndone a lot of\nhe's done a lot of introspection and\nunderstanding about his feelings in the\nnow\nthe real question is like how did she\nmake you feel when she dumped you\nand how do you overcome that because\nwhen you get free of that then i think\nthe only fans will be easier to shed"
