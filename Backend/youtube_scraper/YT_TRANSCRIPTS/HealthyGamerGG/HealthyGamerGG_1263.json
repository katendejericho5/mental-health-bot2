    "transcript": "the best way to understand yourself is\nhaving someone in your corner\ncoaches can help you understand yourself\nby providing an angle on your issues\nfor more information on coaching and a\nway to sign up for our waitlist\nclick the first link in the description\nhey man\nuh are you dude yeah\nyou sound like a dude\ni was just i it just occurred to me that\ni i wasn't entirely sure of your gender\nbecause you know oh i see yeah i'm a guy\num so welcome five up oh thank you thank\nyou for having me\nuh do you wanna see my face on the\ndiscord call\num\nsure why not okay there\nmy face is revealed\nhello hey man uh and what do you go by\nuh just five up for twitch okay\nand um and and what would you like to\ntalk about today five up\noh should we just get into like the main\nthings i guess\nor sure uh i guess\nsomewhat being new to\ntwitch and the whole new experience of\nit and what goes along with that\ni guess really good and the bad side of\nit\ni think that's probably the main thing\nokay so\nthe like how to adjust to twitch\nyeah essentially okay and and so can you\ntell me a little bit\nabout um how you got\nuh started streaming on twitch uh sure\nuh so i'd say for around\ntwo years now i've been friends with a\nlot of streamers but\nit's always been like behind the scenes\ni guess so the public didn't\nknow me um then when a manga started\njust becoming extremely popular uh i\nwas good at deception-based games they\nthought it was entertaining and they\nbrought me along for some of the streams\nand then\nthey constantly sent me screenshots of\nlike does\nfive upstream where they can i have a\nlink to a stream or like people begging\nme to stream so\ni eventually just said okay i'll turn it\non it wasn't really a plan to become a\nstreamer\nand then it just grew\nin exponentially an insane amount uh now\nhere we are\nokay um and\nwe're gonna start with one of the\nstaples how does that make you feel\num\ni feel it feels weird i guess\nlike is the best way i can describe it\nwhere\nthe the element of\ni don't think i can process having\naround like\n10 000 to 20 000 people watch me like it\ndoesn't feel like that's\nan actual thing uh i guess where\ni don't think it's even hit me for that\naspect it just more feels like i'm\ntalking to\num a\nlike it feels the same talking to 100\npeople i guess\num but then there's other elements where\nyou actually\ninteract with the people that watch you\nwhich is like the\nvery daunting almost but it's a really\ncool experience at the same time\nwhat's daunting about it um\ni'm not used to having\npeople like be nervous around me i guess\nwhere if you join a channel there'll be\na flood of people coming in\nand then they'll all want to say\nsomething but they'll also like be\nextremely nervous to say\nanything uh and that's a weird\nexperience for me i'd say just because\ni'm used to just talking to people\nuh just like person to person i guess\nokay i'm just listening to your voice\ndo you mind if i ask a couple of\nquestions in general about\num you know ballpark features of your\nlike where you are in life sure so can\nyou just ballpark your age for me\ni'm 21. okay\nand um do you want to share with us like\nare you a student\nor i'm not cur\nsure uh i'm not currently a student i\nfinished high school then i went\nimmediately into working uh i did\ngraphic design\nokay and so are you working right now do\nyou have a job\nuh i not i mean i guess twitch is my\nfull-time job now\nyep but before that uh yeah um i did\ngraphic design\nokay full time and um when did you start\nstreaming on twitch\nuh in mid-august of this year\nokay so just recently\num and\nso can can you help me understand a\nlittle bit about what\nwhat about adjusting to twitch has been\nchallenging for you\num\nthere is a i don't\ni feel guilty when\ni can't control the chat room because\nit's such a new thing that i wasn't able\nto like\nbuild from the ground up and like start\na very controlled community\nwhere um there\nit's just a combination of a bunch of\ndifferent communities plus youtube\nuh all into one very fresh place and\nsometimes it's just like\nthey'll if anything goes wrong for uh\nsay in a game of among us because that's\na game about deception\nthere's going to be heated moments and a\nlot of people understand that and they\nwill\nbrigade other chat rooms occasionally\nand\nit's just um that's not me at all\nand it's very hard to control that\nand that's like i feel bad about that by\na giant amount and then\nthere's like the uh i'm not gonna say\ni don't think i have imposter syndrome\nbut correct me if i'm wrong if this is\nin the\nlines of it where so i'm losing my voice\nin a second\nuh it's it's not it's sort of like\ni work hard for what i do i try to be\nentertaining uh\nbut there is the feeling of like these\nare\nmy peers i've only started in august and\nit almost feels like a level of\nundeservingness\nokay when i compare myself to other\npeople\nfirefox would you describe yourself as\ncontemplative\nuh remind me what that means\nlike do you are you a thinker yeah\nyou sound contemplative\nyou sound like you think about things\nyeah i would say i think a lot before um\ni do anything to the point of over\nanalyzing stuff\nhow do you know if you overanalyze\nsomething\nwhen i can think about like four\ndifferent\npossibilities of ways to go like\neven for this interview i guess it was\nlike what if i say something bad what if\ni say something good what if i reveal\ntoo much blah blah blah blah blah\nand that's like way too much into detail\nversus just going with it\nbut does that bother you to think to\noverannoys\num for some parts it's helpful for some\nparts it's very\nvery um bad i guess where you can get in\nyour own head\nask again does it bother you oh um\nno i didn't think so\nso you know sometimes people talk about\noverthinking as anxiety so sometimes you\nknow we kind of think about people who\noverthink about various possibilities\nand stuff like that as a\nmanifestation of anxiety but it sounds\nto me like you just kind of calculate\nbut it doesn't necessarily\nbother you i'd say that's accurate\nand so i'd say that when you say that\nyou overthink it's actually out of a\nlogical conclusion that\nmaybe you would benefit from thinking\nless and maybe you would do better with\nsort of going with the flow and letting\ngo and doing all these things that\npeople talk about\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i mean that would it's a lot\neasier said than done is the sad part\nabout that though\nyeah where yeah\ngo ahead sorry yeah\ni i don't i've like i've tried to do\nthat occasionally\nbut it's like i'll put myself out on a\nwhim\nand do stuff spontaneous just to like\ntry\nand capture that more but it's like\nstill very hard to do that just like\nportland possible\nsure sure okay\nso let me just try to kind of recap a\nlittle bit about\nwhat i understand about u5 up and then\nyou let me know if i'm\nkind of missing particular things or you\nwant to add anything okay\nso it sounds like you were friends with\nstreamers\nand then you started playing among us\nwith them just kind of out of\nfun maybe and then people started\ninquiring a little bit about\nyou know how do we watch you stream\ndirectly\nand then you kind of decided okay maybe\ni'll give this a shot\nand around mid-august you started\nstreaming and and now you have what\nsounds like five to ten thousand\nconcurrents\nand you feel sort of undeserving but at\nthe same time i'm not hearing that\nyou're particularly\ndistressed if anything you're more\nbewildered and it's sort of like you\njust spawned in the game and you're like\nkind of looking around and you're like\nwhat's going on here and how do i manage\nthis\nwhere am i\nyeah um\ni don't know if\nrelating to the the undeserving part\nwhere\ni don't know if bewildered is the\ncorrect word\nbecause i mean more in that feeling it's\num\nthere's people that i've watched for\nyears i guess or\npeople that have been in the industry\nfor years\nlike nine ten years i guess and then\ni come in and then it's only been three\nmonths i\nit's hard to not compare yourself to\nother people and\nlike a personal opinion was like these\npeople are so entertaining and i don't\nfeel as\nentertaining as them uh and then i\nam all of a sudden like bigger\nand i don't want to use bigger because\nthat feels like cocky almost\num sure but i i can't think of a better\nword\nbesides that where some of these people\nonly have like 500 viewers for example\nand i i feel like\npeople deserve so much more i guess\nwhere\ni'm kind of just here sure\nthat's more the feeling of it yeah yeah\nno i i get it so i'm also\nnot noticing a whole lot of distress\nwith anything that you've talked about\ntoday\ni mean i'm\ngenerally a very very like controlled\nperson where\ni try to not let\nemotions or i guess emotional sides\nin general um affect me\nwhere i think about it a lot\nthen i i decide how i feel about that\nand go on about that rather than just\nlike acting on an impulse or\nletting things affect me too much and\nwhat is it that you're keeping at bay\nwhat is it that you're not not letting\nwhat is it that you're not\nletting affect you um\ni mean i've been\nhmm\nwell i i guess\nbesides like repeating myself i guess um\ni i've never been one to like\nit's not a lack of empathy it's a lack\nof like\nvocal empathy i guess where\nor emotional understanding of people\num i don't know how to like explain\nthis okay well let's\nwhy don't you start by doing a bad job\nand then we'll clean it up\ngotcha sure um\nwhen when someone's going through a\nsituation\ni guess it's i look at things\nlogically and find a logical solution\nrather than an emotional solution\nand that translates over to pretty much\neverything i do in general so not just\nthe um like that\nthat was more of an example trying to\ntranslate over to like everything and\nthat's how my mind thinks\nso that's what i more me by like less\nempathy uh in terms of like\nfeeling and such for so like streaming\ni guess i don't understand um\na lot of the the feelings that go into\nit that a lot of people have\nor like the response and reception from\nchat\ni guess where like it feels sort of like\na giant disconnect\nsure a little better yeah yeah good good\njob so let me let me see if we let's see\nif we can do this together okay five up\nsure\nso i i don't know exactly what i'm\ngetting this from but\ni get the sense that like you don't live\nthe life that other people live\nand i'm not just talking about being a\nsuccessful streamer i mean that\nyou sort of navigate the world and you\nkind of like see\nother people having issues with stuff\nthat just is not an issue for you\nand and you sort of logically understand\nhow there are things that\nyou know people feel and things that\npeople do and stuff like that and\nsometimes they get bothered about things\nand they they feel like imposters and\nwhatnot\nbut you just don't feel those things\nlike you get that maybe on some level\nyou do\nmaybe you feel it a little bit but it\ndoesn't it doesn't it seem to affect you\nas much as it affects other people\nyeah i'd say that's very true okay we\ngot a very true okay\nso yeah man i i think this is gonna go\npotentially in a different direction\nfrom\nuh maybe what you were thinking or maybe\nwhat other people were thinking\num and it's interesting okay\num so let me ask you this five up can\nyou tell me a little bit about your\nupbringing um sure\ni\num i guess from a very young age my\nparents were divorced\nso i was always raised on the two house\ndynamic\nwhere half the week i'd spend a day or\ndays at my father's house half days at\nmy mother's house um\nwent to\num a charter school if you know what\nthat is\nyeah can you explain it to us uh charter\nschool is essentially\nit's not a public school it is a school\nwhere it is more of a small\ndifferent type of teaching style\nwhere for the specific one it was\nlike three years at a campus because\nthis is like\nage six or nine um some i'm just going\nto speak in\nages because europeans might be watching\num\nso ages six through nine then different\ncampus\nuh with a whole different class and such\nin students\nuh three years there then another campus\nafter\nthe ages of nine through twelve then you\ndo two years in middle school\nthat's i guess 12 through 14 and then i\nwent to a public school\num so\nkind of through throughout school\ni\ni've always been the person to finish\nthings\nvery very quickly where instead of i\ndon't really know what a public school\nsystem is for\nthe ages up until high school because i\ndidn't go to one um\nbut we were assigned very like\na set assignments for the week and i\nwould always just finish that in the\nfirst day\nand then i would just spend the rest of\nthe week doing whatever i wanted\ni guess because there was no other\nassignment to do um\nand that lasted up until\ni guess middle school and within those\nthings because i had so much freedom\num the teachers didn't really know what\nto do with me\nand\nthings kind of just got i guess left\nbehind in a way\nwhere i was just my own independent i\nguess\nand it was hard to find the resources of\nlike what i wanted to do fully\num so within these school systems every\ni'd say third year because like i said\nyou switch a campus after\nthree years so first and second fine on\nthe third year the year before you\nswitch to campus\num something always happened to where i\nwas learning\ni guess where either the teacher got\num something happened to them the\ndynamic changed a lot\nwhere like on my third year\nthe teacher got pregnant and then she\ncompletely just like did not pay\nattention to any of the thirty years\num in sixth grade or age twelve\num the teacher swapped from the main one\nand for the three years that we're at\nthese campuses we only share the same\nclassmates for every subject and there's\nonly 28 people per class\nand the campus has like 200 people in\ntotal\nand then middle school same thing\nhappened again\nwhere a bunch of teachers that i know\nwere good from\nmy brother's experience because he went\nto the same schools as me um\nthey all swapped the years i got there\nand so everything was sort of like a\ntransitional period\num i'm sorry can you say\ndid you say you have siblings i have one\nbrother\nand is he older or younger uh older\nand what's he up to um\nhe is\num let's say he's in\nthe medical research field and i have to\nleave that a little bit\num sure broad i guess is he accomplished\nfor yeah uh well he's um he's 23 he just\nfinished\num university but like i can't say\nwhat he does no no i'm not asking what\nhe does i asked\nis he good at it\num i don't know\ni mean he's that's okay it's kind of\nsecret\ni guess\nwhat's secret about that um\nhmm i'm i i don't mean to pry i'm just\ngenuine no no\nno no no no i'm just trying to get a\nsense of like if he's accomplished at\nwhatever field he is and i don't\ni don't yes that's identifying\ninformation\nyeah he's a he's accomplished at what he\ndoes i think that's\nall i could really say sure that's\nthat's oh yeah basically what i'm asking\num five up do you feel like you're not\nlike the other humans\nwhat do you mean by that i'm going to\nthat more\num what was your why did you laugh what\ndid you feel when i asked the question\num\nand i'll go go into it more in a second\ni guess\nwhen you say that it instantly like\nmakes me go into comparing myself to\nother people\nand it's like\ni did things differently than people i\nwouldn't say\ni'm different though i guess\nyeah but but so so i'll pay attention to\nmy wording okay\ndo you feel like you're not like the\nother humans\nyes okay\nso i'll explain more now\nso like humans have like lives right\nwhere they get attached to things they\nget emotional\nsometimes they get anxious sometimes\nthey get confused sometimes they get\nyou know bent out of shape they compare\nthey have egos\nthey try hard they suffer they're\nparalyzed by lack of motivation things\nlike that\nand it's not that you don't feel any of\nthose things it's just that all that\n[ __ ] seems to affect you less\nlike the volume on all of those things\nis sort of turned down\nyeah i'd agree okay\nand so i mean a a five-upper you are you\nlike i don't i'm not getting much in\nterms of like\nemotional distress or like you know\nsometimes people come on and they're\nlike dealing with\nlet's say depression or anxiety or like\nfeeling cut off or feeling unmotivated\nor things like that i'm not really i'm\nnot really getting\nany any of that from you um\nyeah that wasn't um\nuh i guess throughout like\nmiddle school in high school uh or early\nhigh school\ni i had like a little bit of depression\ni'd say\nand i managed to work through that and i\nthink i'm in a very comfortable spot\nuh and now i've been for a bunch of\nyears now sure sure so so i'm just\nconfirming that right so sure i i we\ndon't need to go digging for negativity\nin fact i'm just\ni'm actually trying to close the door on\nnegativity because i think\nthat becomes a much more interesting\nconversation so this isn't going to be a\nconversation at least i don't think so\nabout depression or anxiety or imposter\nsyndrome or anything like that\nwhat do you think about that does any of\nthat stuff like did you want to talk\nabout any of that stuff\num that wasn't really the intention\ni guess of coming on here did you have a\nparticular intention\noh the\nwell i guess two\none was to\none meet you because i am a fan uh two\num\n[Music]\ni guess the there's the\nthe nervousness about everything\nrelating to what happened like\nbeing here now as in the the twitch\nenvironment and\nwhat that means and the\nthe i guess the terrifyingness of what\ncomes after because\nwith such a sudden explosion on such a\num a game that\nhas no business being as popular as it\ndoes the the moment that comes after\nwhat happens next after that game is\nfinished is terrifying\nwhat's terrifying about that um\nthe why do people fully watch me\ni guess because i don't feel that\nparticularly entertaining\ni guess and i don't understand why um\nto this degree this happened for the\nposition i'm in now\nyep okay so i think there's an important\nword there and\nand my my i'm getting kind of like\nan interesting direction which i'd like\nto pose to you now\nso you said you don't understand so\nsometimes when\nlike you don't know you don't understand\nwhat comes next\nso and that's actually what i'd like to\nfocus on today so sometimes when people\ncome on they're struggling with a\nparticular emotion or like\nproblem and and our goal is to sort of\nhelp them like see things in a new light\nin a sense it's understanding but i\nthink it's more of like an emotional\nunderstanding\nin your case five up what i would say is\nthat you are what i would call\nspiritually gifted and what i mean by\nthat\nis that like you're one of these people\nthat\nis actually for whatever reason has a\nfair amount of detachment\nkind of baked into you so what we talk\nabout and what we try to encourage\nin this channel is for people to teach\npeople how to become detached\nokay so so i know this sounds kind of\nweird but like\nso sometimes you know like i mean i\ndon't give people like clinical\ndiagnoses but my sense of people is that\nokay this person has\nanxiety holding them back or this person\nhas shame holding them back or\nyou know this person like isn't in cell\nbecause they have a low value of\nthemselves or whatever\nthe interesting thing is that in your\ncase i i think for whatever reason you\nhave a certain amount of detachment\nbaked into you and what i mean by\ndetachment is that\nyou know a lot of human beings live\nlives that they're like very attached to\nstuff\nso sometimes that's material stuff\nsometimes it's relationships\nsometimes it's like goals and ambitions\nbut i don't get the sense that you're\nparticularly ambitious\ni don't get the sense that you're\nparticularly like\num you know hung up on something\nemotionally\ni think you just sort of\nare generally like kind of content and\nkind of happy and if anything you're\njust trying to figure out like how all\nthis stuff\nworks like you're not but but your your\nyour desire to figure out how things\nwork is not like\nout of a desire to like change something\nso a lot of times like understanding is\nborn of like desperation\nso i'm tired of feeling this way so i\nneed to understand how to stop feeling\nthis way\nyou just seem to sort of be like kind of\nchilling\nand and are like you know life is\nrelatively easy for you\num i don't get the sense that you're\nparticularly attached to like\nacademic accomplishments although it\nsounds like you could be quite\naccomplished if you really put your mind\nto it but you seem to be\nrelatively uninterested um you're one of\nthese rare people that\nseems like you went to work after high\nschool but like\nthat was also like i'd guess that you\nwere relatively successful as a graphic\ndesigner\nyeah i didn't have a um\na reason to go to college where any\nfield that\ni want to go into or wanted to go into\ndidn't really require that education\nyeah so see that's kind of interesting\nbecause that's very rare\nright so very few people say i'm not\ngonna go to college because\nit doesn't suit me so most people\nare actually like you know have\neither a lack of like internal sense of\ndirection to where they go out go to\ncollege\nout of like insecurity and like not\nbeing sure what they want to do in life\nor they go because that's what they're\nsupposed to do like you just sort of\nhave your own internal compass\nthat seems to be a little bit you know\num slick when it comes to like\nthe world wanting you to do things like\nit just the world wanting you to do\nthings just sort of doesn't\nlatch on to you does that make sense\nyeah how how much\ndo you think that what i'm saying\nactually is accurate to\nkind of your who you are in your life i\nthink\num\ni want like my mind says i want to say\nyou're like\ncompletely accurate but i want to say 95\nlike there might be some room for air um\nbut i'd say you got very accurate\nokay so i think oddly enough so so this\nis going to be an interesting\nconversation five up because i i don't\nthink it's gonna be about like so some\npeople are drawing correlations between\nyou and destiny\nand some people are sort of saying that\nlike you know\nthis sounds a lot like destiny like he\ndoesn't experience a whole lot of\nemotion\nfrankly i i don't i don't think you're\nsimilar to destiny at all i don't\nso so some people i think have emotional\nsuppression\ni don't think you have emotional\nsuppression or i mean maybe you've got\nsome\nbut i i don't think you're like you know\nthere's some treasure trove of negative\nemotion that you've talked so\nfar away within yourself that like you\nknow that's what we have to dig up i\nthink you're just kind of confused\nand you're different from other people\nand and you're not really sure like\nhow to systematically understand\nyourself better\nor like what to do with your life\nhmm yeah\ni don't know how to respond to that i\nmean besides like i wanna i wanna give a\nbetter response\nthan just yeah i think that very nail on\nthe head\nbut i don't know like what to say that's\nokay\nso so just just say so you don't have to\noffer more\ni just want you to offer if it's a nail\non the head that's nail on the head\nright\nso then then it's going to be weird\nbecause i'm going to guide the\nconversation because but first we have\nto like establish\num we have to just establish that we're\non the same page about what we're\ntalking about and what direction to go\nright so like i'm just trying to like\nnail this down very clearly that\ni don't think i'm gonna try to dig into\nyour negative emotions from your\nchildhood\nbecause i don't think there's a whole\nlot to find there no\nokay so um\nso then so let's just talk about this so\ncan you tell me a little bit\nuh i i do want to understand a little\nbit more about your upbringing so can\nyou tell me a little bit about your\nparents\num sure so the graphic design side\nwas that is a\nbusiness that my mom's side runs i'm\ngetting a\ncall in a second let me just give me two\nseconds\nsorry about that i just muted everything\ni turned it off um\nyeah so for my uh\nmom's side of stuff she runs the her own\ngraphic design business\nand it's more of like a work at home\nvery specialized type of thing where\ni'm not going to say what exactly we do\nand what we work on because it's very\neasy to find uh\nif you know but we do\na lot of stuff for like specialized\nindustries relating to either music or\nbig\nuh conferences and\nuh hotels and advertisement stuff\nand then for my dad's side it's um\nhe's very accomplished in the rock\nclimbing scene\nwhere like two very very very different\nuh personalities and sides of upbringing\nwhere um\ni guess i got to experience like\none side where we didn't have\nlike any money and we're struggling on\nthat side and then mom's side\nwas a lot more uh frugal i guess\nand it was the the dynamic of going from\nnothing to a little bit of something and\njust pushing back and forth and seeing\nboth sides of that\ni guess um\nthen\ni'm trying to think of how much i want\nto say\num let's talk about this for a second\nwhy why the hesitation\nwhy do you think so carefully about what\nyou want to say\nfor this topic in particular or yeah\njust\nthis topic and also like you know it\nsounds like you're\nvery concerned about revealing something\nwhat is it that you're trying to protect\ni'm not i'm not trying to get you to say\nanything about it\ni just want to understand what your\nmotivations are oh\num i guess it's also\npertaining to\num why i don't show my face where\ni don't want to have people\nfind relating back to i guess\nme being friends with streamers before i\nstreamed on twitch for years\nwhenever i went out with them um they\nwould get recognized all the time\ndidn't matter where they were and the\nthe thought of loss of privacy\nis something i don't\ni don't want it all or okay i want to be\nable to\ndo what i want to do and not have to um\nbe forced to just lose that i guess\nokay so you're just it's just protection\nof privacy\nfor protection of privacy and then\nthere is like how much do i want to say\nabout\num it's privacy for one side and then\nit's like\nvery very very personal things for the\nother\nwhat does that mean for the other um\nso like relating to why i didn't like go\ninto detail about what my\nmom's company does uh that's more of the\nkeeping privacy side of things and then\nfor like why i'm hesitating on the other\nis this like\npersonal events that happen that are\nlike i don't think i want to reveal\nat that moment or like go too much into\nare\npersonal events like that happened in\nyour upbringing yes\nokay yeah yeah i mean okay\nwere you did you grow up in a particular\nuh religious tradition\nno um\nthere there was an event that caused my\ndad's or my dad to become very religious\nwhere he wasn't at\nall and too very religious um\nand then my mom said not at all okay\num have you had people in your life five\nup who\nunderstand you yeah\nlike do do people like understand\nlike have you met anyone like you\nsimilar i can think of three people\nyou can think of three people any of\nthem like older than you\num\ni'd say two of them are like\nsubstantially\none's two years old two years older than\nme the other one\nis four years older than me\nokay\nthen the other one is um i'm older than\nhim by a few months\nokay and how did you get to be friends\nwith a bunch of streamers\num how did that happen if you\noh combination of a few things\ni guess where i i assume you know what\nleague of legends is\nyeah yeah um i peaked a challenger in\nthat game\nand that in suit just goes with um\nyou you meet streamers from like\ni hate saying this but like challenger\nis essentially like all right\nyou you are a person you can talk to who\nyou want to because that is the social\nstatus\nand then the\nthe other side is like i had a friend\nthat i'm not going to say\nwho uh i had a friend that got popular\non\nthe raj patel show now known as like the\naustin or love and\nhost whatever it's called um that no\nlonger goes on there\nand she introduced me to a lot of\nstreamers i guess\nand i became friends with them and how\ndid you feel about that\nwhat was it like being friends with\nstreamers um\ni never really looked at it like that it\nwas more i always try to just become\nfriends with\npeople that are fun\ni've never been one to get like star\nstruck or\nnervous around people i guess\ni think that makes sense um\ndid you ever think about the value it\ncould bring being friends with these\npeople yeah i mean that was\npartially in the back of my head and it\nmakes me feel bad but\num yeah there there is an element of\nlike\nwell i i have friends that are in the\nscene and i have more opportunities to\ndo some fun things\nuh i didn't think uh streaming was like\na potential\nbut i didn't want to\nfeel like i would take advantage of that\nsituation i wanted more do it on myself\nif i wanted to stream\nstreaming was never really a um a thing\ni\nthought to pursue\nokay five foot what do you want to do\nwith your life\nuh i i've wanted\ni said i've wanted to do what i want is\nthe best way to put it\nwhere i want to\nspontaneously do um\njust random goals that i have whether it\nbe travel to a bunch of locations\num and explore\nall of europe or asia versus um maybe\nopen\na very very nice bakery somewhere in\neurope or\num become very uh\nskilled at uh cooking or pastry side of\nthat\num but overall just like have fun and do\nwhat i want\nis always been my goal in life\ni think that would be a waste\ninteresting why so\nyou were born with a really good set of\nrng five\nup\nand i think that that if you're bored\nborn with a good set of rng\nyou've got two options right one is just\nkind of coast\nand you sort of live a life of\nindulgence\nright you learn you get good at things\nlike things that are respectably\nindulgent\nbut you do things like you travel you\nmaster skills because you have the\ntalent and proficiency to do so\nlike something tells me that you know\nhere we've got a 21 year old kid who's\nchallenger in league of legends\nand a very successful streamer after\nlike three months of streaming\nand if you something tells me if you\nwanted to master\nbecoming a pastry chef you would so when\nyou put your mind to something it sounds\nlike\nit ten your mind tends to generally\nspeak and do what you\nwant it to do um you know\nyou have a certain amount of\nself-direction and and\nyou know it's you sound kind of op five\ni i guess but i\nthe\nthe i don't know i respond to that i'll\nbe honest um\nthat's okay\ni i don't know what\nwhat do you mean by it would be oh like\nare\nyou saying that for\nlike you think would be better for me to\npursue i uh\ni don't know uh a field or\ni i don't generally know what you mean\nby it would be a waste yeah\ni i get that and so we're going to talk\nabout that in a second\nyeah okay so here's here's what i think\nwould be a waste\nso like okay so five up i think this\nwill make a lot more sense if i give you\njust some\nactual context so in the\nkarmic religions like hinduism and\nbuddhism\nthey believe in the principle of cause\nand effect\nokay so that's what karma means so karma\nmeans that for\neach action there's an equal and\nopposite reaction\nthat all things that happen have causes\nand that all things\nand that all causes lead to happenings\nyou with me so far yes okay\nso then let me ask you a question\nif you got a good rng like you spawned\nwith a good seed\nokay like you know i'm talking about\nlike rng seed from like roguelikes\nyes okay so if you spawn with a good\nseed\nso let's let me start by asking you this\nquestion okay so we're gonna like\nphilosophize a little bit which is not\nsomething i do often on stream but i\nthink it's actually probably what you\nneed\nbecause i imagine you have these kinds\nof thoughts a lot so\num so do you think that\ncause and effect is a universal\nprinciple of existence or do you think\nthat it is\nit is limited and that some causes exist\nwithout\neffects and that some effects are not\npreceded by causes\nuh definitely the second one so give me\nan example of an effect that is not\npreceded by a\nwhere cause cause and effect break down\nso i mean causes uh\ninspired by a person wanting to make a\nchange or motivation or something happen\nand a person can pursue that\nand do that for a this is a this is more\non the negative side of thinking but\nit's still a example of it doesn't\nnecessarily always because you said\nsome potential parts um so\nthe cause that they are trying to make\nan effect happen from\ndoesn't sometimes amount to anything\nthat's like\nnot that's a very negative way of\nlooking at it where there's also\nthe complete opposite where a person can\nstrive out to do something and make a\nchange\nand that change will actually have a\ngreat effect\num but you you can't\nor at least i don't look at it like that\nis a guarantee\nno well well yeah so so the question is\nis there an effect\nit's not that there's a particular\neffect right\nso like for example so i i'll just be\ntransparent so i believe that\num you know causes have effects and that\neffects have causes\nso it's been my experience generally\nspeaking as a scientist\nthat barring some very rare situations\nthe laws of physics don't randomly break\ndown\nokay from that perspective i agree with\nyou right so like like even if i have\na motivation or intention to do\nsomething\nand the thing doesn't happen that\ndoesn't mean that my actions don't have\neffects it just means that the effect\nthat i wanted was not achieved\nso that's different it's like kind of\nsaying if i roll a pair of dice\nand i want an 11 just because i want an\n11 doesn't mean that\nonce i roll the dice they're not going\nto land on a particular number like once\ni roll the dice the dice will land on\nsome number\nso does that you with me yeah no i\nfollow you\nso so just because the you know i'm not\nsaying that you can necessarily control\na particular outcome in fact the\nopposite\nbut what i'm saying is that all things\ncome from somewhere like\nit's impossible to get a plant without a\nseed\nand generally speaking well i mean not\nall plants but\nnot all seeds will go grow into plants\nright so there are a number of things\nthat can influence\nwhether a seed winds up growing into a\nplant or not\nbut once again you can look at each of\nthose seeds and you can kind of say that\nlike\nthe reason for this effect is because of\nparticular causes like if i\nput a seed in\nyou know in a metal box it's not going\nto turn into\nan apple tree right because the\nsufficient causes are not there with me\nyes okay so so from that perspective\ncompletely\nagree with uh every cause has an effect\nokay\nso so then let me ask you this do you\nthink your birth\nhas antecedent causes\nwhat go into more what antecedent means\nso like is your birth\ninfluenced by prior causes\ni mean yeah okay which ones\ni mean i i guess just\nme being born sure sex like sure\nabsolutely right and so your makeup is\ninfluenced by what\ni mean like the likes of the parents\nabsolutely right\nnow what about your parents financial\nsituation\nwould you consider that to be a cause\nthat determines who you are\nno i i wouldn't say so really\nnot to a specific degree\nwhere i've always been allowed to do\nwhatever i want um and\nwhen it comes to like if i wanted to do\nsomething as in\ntravel or uh get anything i'd have to\nwork for that\nso okay it was own effort to get what i\nwant i guess\nwhere i did have a um\na more privileged side at least on my\nmom's side\num but i don't think\nmoney has i mean it has shown me more\npotentials in the world\nso on that aspect yes where i've been\ngiven more opportunities to see stuff\nand that gathers inspiration\nto and motivation to do over things but\ni don't think money is fully the\ninfluence yeah yeah but but i i\ni i think you're actually i\ni didn't answer the question i i didn't\nask the question clearly but your answer\nimplies to me that\nthat that and that the answer is yes so\nlet me put it this way\nyou know part of who you are today is\nbecause of your genetics\npart of who you are today is the\nfinancial situation that your parents\nbrought you up in\nyes right so so if you're i'm not saying\nthat you're\nmoney-oriented or that or anything i'm\nnot making a particular claim about how\nthe dice\nlanded all i'm saying is that there are\na number of things that kind of\ninfluence\nand drive into who you are in this\nmoment\nand so some of that is genetics right so\nthose are some\naspects of your being that are\nessentially determined before you were\nborn\nfair mm-hmm and then there are all these\nother like nurture aspects\nbut those in turn are determined by like\nyour parents because your parents have a\nslew of experiences\nand then they share certain principles\nor values with you\nand those in turn are like built on\ntheir own experiences which in turn\nare influenced by their genetics and\ntheir upbringing\nand on and on and on\nmake sense yes okay\nso then the question is like okay so\nlike you are what you are\nand then the question is like what do\nyou do with the seed that you're given\nand so this is where i'm gonna make a\nclaim so so far i feel like i've been on\npretty\nstandard footing or pretty solid\nfoundation and i feel like if you\ndisagreed i could\nyou know make a convincing argument\nwhether i can bring you around to it or\nnot is a different story\nnow i'm gonna go out on a limb okay so\nthis is where like i'm on shaky ground\nso it's been my experience that from a\ncall\nso this is where like now we get into\nsort of the spirituality or the\nreligious aspect of it where\nit becomes harder to elucidate logically\nalthough in my experience if you spend\nenough\ntime and energy exploring it you'll come\nto this conclusion\nso there's like this idea of like good\nkarma and bad karma which i think is\nactually\nfalse there's no such thing as good\nkarma and bad karma karma is just karma\nenergy is just energy and cause and\neffect is just cause and effect\nit's we as human beings who apply our\nown\nvalue system onto karma so it is because\nwe desire particular effects that we say\nthat something is better than something\nelse\nwith me so far yes okay\nand so what i'm going to say though is\nthat like it's been my experience\nthat people who are born with a good\nseed\ncan go one of two directions they either\nuse\nthat seed for themselves or they use\nthat seed for\nothers\nwhat do you think about this\nyeah i mean i i agree is\nit's just up to the motivation of that\nperson\nand the how much effort they want to put\ninto it\nyep and so i think\nso i think part of the reason that you\ndid you got this seed\nis because of your past karma\nand i think that you've got an\ninteresting choice because i think if\nyou go the route that you were talking\nabout\nin terms of like learning lots of skills\nand doing cool stuff and traveling the\nworld\ni think your life will be a little bit\nof a waste\nokay that's a provocative statement\nhow do you how do you feel about that\nin in some senses it's like\nif i i feel like\npeople in general have um\na talent and they you can do something\nto make a little bit of a difference\nor a massive difference depending on\nthings that you\nput yourself out to do and some people\nare going to be better at that some\npeople can contribute a lot to\nthe uh i guess society or\num i'm just gonna use society there's\nobviously a\nbunch of words or different types of\nthings i could describe um\nand while that is true\ni feel like\nlearning a bunch of different skills and\napplying it and not necessarily just\nlike a make a difference to the\nworld um is a\nneeded or not i needed isn't the correct\nword\nis uh i don't want to be for example a\npolitician\num i don't want to be a\na pub like i don't know a public speaker\nor a motivator\ni guess so well that i i\ncould be i guess it's\nuh it's hard for me to\n[Music]\nsay like is that what you're telling me\nto do\nis that no i'm not telling you to do any\nof those things i'm also not telling you\nto become a doctor or anything like that\nso here's here's i think what i'm\ntelling you is\nis really just to introduce this concept\nbecause i think for\ni think you should do everything that\nyou have said\nbut i think that i'm just kind of\nintroducing the idea\nthat you know you've got a really good\nrng and so like the world is going to\nlike you you you basically have a fork\nin the road\nof like your life right you can live a\nlife where\nyou tend to focus on yourself or you can\nlive a life\nwhere you improve the lives of others\nnow i'm not saying that those two are\nmutually exclusive i'm not saying that\nbecoming a pastry chef won't be the way\nin which you give back to other people i\ndon't think it looks like anything\nparticular\nwhat i'm really trying to do here and\nthis is hard um\na five up is that i'm trying to get you\nto think about things because i don't\nknow if you've\nquite been exposed to some of these\nconcepts\nand that's really the goal is like i\nthink it's like i think if you want to\ntravel the world you absolutely should\nif you want to focus on yourself for a\nwhile that's actually totally fine too\nbut i i think that when when i ask you\nyou know what do you want it's\nessentially\nto kind of you're kind of saying i want\nto do what i feel like\nwhich is a very good goal but at some\npoint\nhaving seen people who are somewhat like\nyou\nand who are also very accomplished\nthey tend to find that their life starts\nto become like\nrelatively empty at some point\nand so what i'm trying to do is actually\nsince based on our karma i have the\nopportunity to talk to you when you're\n21\ni've talked to you when you are 30\nand i've talked to you when you're like\n45\nand i can tell you where you're gonna\nend up with a lot of confidence\nbecause i've talked to people who are\nyou when they're 30 years old\nand they've built a company that's worth\n20 million dollars and sold it\nand i've talked to you when you were 45\nyears old who built companies that are\nworth a billion dollars insulted\nand and i just want to introduce the\nconcept because i don't think you have a\ngood\nso it's not that you don't have you have\na good internal compass\nbut but i i think you could really\nbenefit from\nexperiences and a system of knowledge\nthat is sort of like hard uh does\ndoesn't apply to most people which is\nessentially like some of these like\nuh eastern texts on spirituality and\nsort of\nthe nature of happiness and stuff like\nthat because as i said before i think\nyou're spiritually gifted so you have a\nnatural degree of a certain amount of\ndetachment\nyou also like tend to operate in terms\nof accomplishment like relatively\neffortlessly\nlike it seems like if you really want to\ndo something like you said you know when\nyou were in fifth grade you would do all\nyour homework at the beginning of the\nweek\nand it doesn't sound like anyone sat you\ndown to try to do that\nyeah right which if you think about our\naudience especially our audience at\nhealthy gamer people would kill for that\nthey work their entire they spend years\nof their life\ntrying to get themselves to do things do\nthings like\ndo their work on monday and then be free\nthe rest of the week\nand instead what they do is they like\nprocrastinate and suffer and push it\nback\nand play games for five days and then\nlike panic on friday\nand it's the same amount of effort it's\njust one is relatively like fun and\neffortless\nand then like the other is like fraught\nwith anxiety procrastination and shame\nand and so i don't even it's kind of\nweird five up because i i kind of feel\nlike\nyou need to just like i think if you\nstudy eastern spirituality\nand i don't mean from an academic sense\ni mean in the way that you study things\nwhich is like very very practically\nthen i think you'll learn a lot\nabout yourself and like what you should\ndo with your life\nokay oh i should get that done\njust so i don't forget something i can\nalways look back to\neastern spirituality\nsure i'll send you more concrete\nrecommendations after the talk\nif you could that'd be very nice yep i\nhave a couple of things particularly in\nmind\nright thank you um what do you think\nabout this conversation\num it's a little bit intimidating i\nthink is a good way to put how i'm\nfeeling\nwhere i get what you mean\nuh i think i have a better understanding\nof what you meant by i was a waste\ni guess or it would be a potential waste\num\nmore so now after you went into that\nside\nwhat's intimidating about the\nconversation hmm\n[Music]\nthe i guess everything that goes into\num doing something\nvery large\nyeah so this is exactly what you need to\nlearn man it doesn't have to be large\nright so like you could become a pastry\nchef and you could run a little bakery\nin some small town in europe\nand that can be actually completely\nsufficient it could be perfect\nright like like if if what you devote\nyourself to is making\ndelicious pastries that enrich the lives\nof people\nand like that's what you put all of your\nfocus into i think it's fine i don't\nthink you have to\nyou know do something grand you don't\nhave to save the world\nit's just about and this is what's so\nhard to explain five up is it's not\nabout the outward action forget about\nthe outward action\nit's about what's going on on the inside\nit's about what your intention is and\nwhat your mindset is\nit's about like you know that internal\ncompass that drives you to act the\naction stuff you've gotten taken care of\nlike that's not a big deal\nand so the manifestation i think is is\nactually somewhat irrelevant i mean it's\nnot irrelevant but\nyou'll figure out what that is the point\nis like\nwhat what is on the inside\nright like what do you what do you\nlike when you wake up and you because\nyou're\nit's kind of interesting because you're\nhalfway there so\nso you know what's your intention when\nyou start to bake something\num i think you might be\nfocusing on the baking side a little bit\nmuch as in that that's just a\nuh i guess a goal or not a goal just a a\npotential\npursuit where at some point i\nthink it'd be fun to do that and then\nafter that i would pursue something else\nafter i was finished with that whether\nthat be\num i mean i guess another goal is be\ntrilingual\num just i i don't\nwant to only focus on one thing five up\ni i'm i'm not focusing on i'm just using\nit as a placeholder because i don't know\nwhat else to say\nokay right so so my point is that it\ndoesn't matter\nwhether you're a teacher a doctor\na streamer or a baker that's my whole\npoint is that like\ni think this i know this is kind of hard\nto understand but your battles are going\nto be\ninternal they're not going to be\nexternal\ndoes that make sense yeah so like i\ndon't care what it looks like that's why\ni'm saying you don't have to like start\nsomething grand like\nforget about the outside world right\nbecause like that [ __ ] is like\nyou know you started streaming three\nmonths ago and you have\nfive to ten thousand concurrence were\nyou in the right place at the right time\nsure did you cultivate it\nabsolutely\ni think i like 70 percent understand you\nand i i feel bad that i don't fully what\ndo you what do you\nsee like it's it's interesting to hear\nhow self-aware you are\nright like you have a good understanding\nof\nyou kind of say that this is\nintimidating fair and yet you're able to\ntolerate it\nyou're able to gauge what you understand\nand what you don't understand\nso tell me what you do understand and\ntell me what you don't understand\ni think i get at what you're trying to\ni guess let me know or like try and open\nanother perspective on it\num the the thing that i'm\ni i guess struggling is when when you\nrespond with like\nthe the you were just using the the\nbaking thing as an example\nand you're more trying to like open up\nlike what do i want to do internally i\nguess\num or the the internal side of it it's\nlike in my mind at least when i say like\ni want to do what i want that's like\nalready somewhat the internal\nstuff of i'm not just going to lay about\ndo like i'm going to do stuff i guess\num\nand whether how easy or how hard or how\nthat makes me feel like i'm going to\ndo stuff that'll be challenging to me\ni'm going to do stuff that's easy and\nfun\num so that's why i guess i'm confused\nwhen you said like\nor why why i'm not gathering when you're\nsaying\nthat i'm not fully there it's a it's a\nit's a good 0.5 up and\nif anything the deficiency is on is on\nmy end because what i'm doing\nis telling you i'm trying to\ni'm being unfair with you because what\ni'm doing is injecting conversations\nthat i've had like i said\nwith 30 year old you and 45 year old you\nto attempt to guide\n21 year old you and the problem is that\n21 year old you hasn't had that\ndegree of experience so it's like kind\nof confusing it's probably a mistake on\nmy part\nbut let me put it this way so let me ask\nyou this okay so\nso let's say you were talking to a\nstreamer who had just blown up\nbut the streamer is concerned that their\nstream has\na certain amount like a certain lifespan\nto it\nright they're like i stream this\nparticular game it's really popular\nright now and i don't know what comes\nnext what would you say to them\nokay that makes more sense now\nif the streamer is worried pretty much\nwhat you're doing is the streamer's\nworried about the lifespan you give them\num the nudge of like\nwhat they can do um\nways to either help sustain it or\nwhat they can do after that or what\nthey've created i guess\num or\nother things to do in the solution\nbehind it\nokay and are you doing that stuff\noh yeah i mean yeah i'm\ni'm doing a mixture of\ni so is this relating back to myself as\nlike giving self advice or like what i'm\ndoing currently\nso i'm just saying like so so here's\nokay\nthis is tough five okay so let me let me\nstart with this so like\nyou say you're terrified of what's gonna\nhappen after among us\nright i don't think you're actually that\nworried about it\num\ni i there is a degree of worry where\nsure it's not like\ni don't think i'm gonna go from\nten thousand to zero i don't think that\nwill be a thing because that doesn't\nmake sense\nin terms of where things are but there\nis the um\ni guess the the self-conscious aspect of\ni know a lot of people watch me because\ni'm good at the game\nand it's i tend not to like think about\nnumbers\num but when you compare like among us to\nlet's say i stream a different game\nit's hard to i mean that is like\nthere's a there's a jump now i've taken\nthis step in trying to\ni guess introduce people to more sides\nof what i do\nbut it's still a very big intimidation\nor an intimidation i keep saying that\nword it\nit's daunting i guess yeah so if you\nwent from ten thousand to zero five up\nhow would you feel about that\ni'd feel pretty sad about it um not\nrelating to like\ndamn i really want to be a streamer and\nin sex that i killed my stream it'd be\nmore like wow\ni guess people didn't find me\nentertaining and really only watch me\nfor this that make me feel sad\nand where would you be a year from then\num if streaming died completely youtube\ndied completely\ni would probably pursue\na degree in denmark from\nsome stuff that i've earned from\nstreaming and try and pursue\nuh education from their kids i mean this\nis a goal that i've\nwanted to move to denmark for a very\nlong time\nand so i would use what i've gotten from\nstreaming to\nhelp me with uh getting there as a goal\nand whether it be so like this is kind\nof my point\nright so man this is so hard i'm i'm\nsorry five up i i may i may need to\ntake another crack at you later but so\nlike this is my point so like\nif your streaming career ended in\ndumpster fire\ni think you would be fine in a year i\nthink you would continue moving along\nthe goals that you've set for yourself\nyeah okay if your streaming career was\nsuccessful i think you'd do the same\nthing\nlike here's what i think you think about\nyour streaming career and when i make\nstatements like this i\ni'm i'm giving you an opportunity to\ntell me that i'm wrong\nokay so i don't want you to like by all\nmeans say\nyou have no idea what you're talking\nabout dr k so like here's\nlike i think that you recognize that you\nhave an opportunity\nand you're going to make the most of\nthis opportunity and something of your\nidentity and your ego is kind of getting\nconfused because i think you had a\npretty clear sense of who you were\nbefore this whole thing happened\nand that this streaming thing is like\nkind of a weird stress or pressure\nwhere you still have a pretty good sense\nof your identity but it's starting to\nget maybe a little bit muddy\nand then like at the end of the day like\nyour compass is your compass and if you\nhave a good opportunity you're gonna\ntake advantage of it\nand you're gonna make the most of it and\nyou're gonna try to make it\ndo what you can out of streaming because\nit's like it'd be dumb if you didn't\nbut i don't hear that you're caught up\nin the idea of being a streamer i don't\nhear that it's actually important\nto it's just a means to an end\nyeah the way i've looked at streaming is\ni've always decided like like i said in\nthe beginning\ni wasn't i didn't have the intention of\nbeing a streamer it just sort of\nhappened\nand i told people in the beginning um\ni'm going to stream if people want to\nwatch me and be a means of entertainment\num and then maybe form a nice community\nabout it and then\nif people didn't watch me then i would\ngo on about it so\nwhile i am saying that from where i am\nnow going from\na big number to zero is daunting it's\nit's that wasn't the this hasn't been\nsomething that i've like worked my whole\nlife towards i guess\nlike a lot of people it's their\naspiration and their like life's desire\nto be a streamer\num where i just didn't go through that i\ndon't have the\nattachment of trying to\nlike i guess make this work like other\npeople have\nit just sort of happened and here i am\nright so so okay i don't even know what\ni'm trying to say at this point\nlet me just think about this for a\nsecond\ndo you have questions five up that would\nprobably focus my mind a lot\num\ngive me a second let me think\ni thought i'm on the spot it's hard to\nthink of a question um it's okay\num\ni guess what do you what do you do\nbecause you you have a lot of influence\nespecially for what you provide\nand especially being a doctor or\ntherapist or\num this means like what do you do with\nthe amount of influence that you have\nand how do you like fully control it\nbecause\ni think you you do a very good job\nat helping people and educating the\npublic and making people have\na better mindset uh or way of thinking\nand it's very hard for me to\neven realize the influence\nbecause it's also new i don't know how\nto control it that's like i guess i got\ninto\na big drama in the middle of me\nstreaming i guess with xqc\nfor example um what happened\nuh so i guess during\nan among us lobby\num i had the intention of\ngoing to a specific group but i saw one\ngroup was forming\nuh like a lot earlier so i was gonna\nplay in that group\nuh and then swap to the other group when\nthat time frame happened\nthis group happened to be the the prior\ngroup the early one that i was going to\nswallow through later\nwas the one with felix and then\num how much do you know about among us\ni played it once played it once okay for\nlike\nan hour and a half gotcha let's just say\ni am you\nyou've spoken to me for like an hour or\nso now i think you\nprobably gathered that i'm like heavily\nlogical thinker\nthat side um i will\ntry and have a conversation and\ntry and like provide my side of it and\nthat might come off as arrogant because\ni think\nat least from the logical side and i\nhave a giant amount of experience\nwhen it comes to deception based games\nbecause i've played\ndo you know what mafia is for example\nyeah okay i've played mafia\nin a hyper competitive scenario or\nhyper-competitive environment for like\nfive years\nso like that was just\nthat trained me for among us i guess for\nthe the social side\num and then mechanics from i guess\nleague transfer over\nor i guess games so it i people deemed\nme as a very good player i guess\num in among us interesting karma there\nhuh\nyeah um so\nwhen i go at it versus felix it was like\njust the clash of he\ni guess intentions of how to play the\ngame where\nin the old game um you used to be able\nto confirm if a person is imposter or a\ncrewmate just by looking at the taskbar\nat the top\nand i felt that defeated the the purpose\nof the game\nin general because it's no longer a\nsocial deduction game it's more just\ni'm going to look at a person do this\nand the game mechanics instantly\nconfirms who\nall the imposters are and who all their\ncriminals are i as a person who is\nintention is like string me the game for\nentertainment\num my goal is like for all the streamers\nto have fun in the audience to have fun\nbecause there's\nwhat like 200 000 people watching uh\nacross all the streamers\nso when that happened and i\njust i'm known as like one of the best\nimposters in the game\nin general uh that causes me to get\nvoted out consistently\nit doesn't matter if i'm good or bad um\nand that got heavily on my nerves and he\ngot he gets hyper competitive um\nso eventually just left me to leaving\nthe lobby after a few scenarios where i\ncall him and posture explain why\nand then he's i guess [ __ ] talking and\nit was a consistent thing where that\nentire\nuh thing annoyed me and um i eventually\njust left\nhe said a bunch of things uh\nand continue to speak about it after i\neven left i said my piece of what i\nthought of the situation\nthat heavily blew up um on live stream\nfails\ngot on to like random gaming web\narticles was on snapchat\nand just caused like a really really\nshitty dynamic\nwhat does that mean shitty dynamic where\nif you do anything wrong text you see\nhis chat will brigade you\num and that is what like people only\nknew me for for a month\nand was like it feels awkward\nuh it felt awkward for a while it's like\ni can't play in the game with him\nand because you're gonna get brigaded by\nhis chat\nuh well it's not\nlike people were on my side and now you\nhave\nuh his chat defending him but\neveryone else [ __ ] on him and then\nit's like if i play in a lobby with him\nthere's going to be no matter what me\nversus him\num and i like i\namong this is 10 people and i want to\nplay with my friends but he also plays\nwith my friends\num so it was just\nthat whole situation was really bad so\nhow does that make you feel\nwell it made me feel bad i didn't like\nthat at all what did you feel bad about\num there were two things one\ni am a hyper competitive person also so\ni understand that but i have never been\none to rage\num but i'm very understanding of like\nwho xqc is and why he's like that\nand i didn't find it like\ni i didn't want there to be a rift or a\nweird dynamic but i knew\nthe chat would cause it so if it was\njust like if me and him were it was just\nlike a one-on-one\nor just playing with friends it wouldn't\nmatter um\nwe would just both move on and it'd be\nfine but because there\nis a bunch of other people talking about\nit looking about it causing a bunch of\ntrouble he got tons of hate for it\num because everyone made him look out to\nbe like this the worst guy in the world\nuh and i felt bad about that and i mean\ntrain talked to me about like\nhow the bigger streamer pretty much no\nmatter what gets the fault\njust because of the audience um\nand that's not necessarily true for\neverything but\nthe more people you have the more people\nthere are to [ __ ] on you and\nso there was the combination of i don't\nthink i was in the wrong yet i also feel\nbad about the situation that happened\nand that's also why i wanted like how do\ni\ncontrol an audience because i don't want\nthat to happen again\nokay so um my answer is going to be\nsomewhat disappointing but\nyou don't right so like let's just talk\nabout what you're saying\nso how do you control the behavior i i\nmean i'm going to give you a more\nsatisfying answer in a second but the\nshort answer and it's really important\nto understand this\nis that you don't right like i can't\ncontrol\ntoxicity like i don't control what\nsomeone else does\nlike i can't control what someone else\ndoes now there are a lot of practical\nthings that will people will tell you\nthat you can\nsort of cultivate a particular kind of\nchat and we work very hard to do that\nso you can have you know mods that have\nlow tolerance towards certain kinds of\nbehaviors and things like that for sure\nthey're practical things\nbut in in the essence of it i want you\nfive up to take a step back from like\ncontrolling another human being\nand now you may not agree with that\nbecause i i think you probably are\nreally good at hurting\nother people i i said heard h-e-r\ni i heard i probably probably\nright so i i think you're good at that\nbut like be really\nreally careful about what you actually\nexpect from\nyourself and just because you tend to be\npretty good at like\nhurting other people into doing what you\nwant to\ndoesn't mean that you can actually\ncontrol them\nand the bizarre thing is i think that\nit's the understanding that you can't\ncontrol someone\nthat in and of itself is one of the most\nuseful things in influencing them\nbecause once you acknowledge that you\ncan't control another person\nonce you seed that power over\nto your audience you\nalso\ncan kind of like influence them in the\npurest way\nwhich is to like give them an offer so\nwhat i try to do is\nis cultivate a particular like attitude\nand i model particular behavior and\nwith a lot of help from mods we sort of\nencourage a certain we cultivate right\nso you can't\ncontrol someone but you can absol\nabsolutely cultivate behavior\nit's the difference between control and\ncultivation\nyeah i i didn't want to say con\ncontrol i guess like that's not how i\nfelt about i don't want to control\npeople\nit's i guess influence is the better\nword yeah so\nso so and i think you use the word\ninfluence\nactually in your question and and so i\njust want to kind of\nmaybe i'm belaboring a useless point but\nso then the next thing is that i\ni think like you can just model write\nthe appropriate behavior\nand and so i mean i think that's the\nmost that you can do but frankly this\nsounds to me like a hazard of like being\na streamer on twitch\nright because you've got a community and\nhe's got a community and y'all are gonna\nget into it\nit sounds to me like you're choosing\nyour words very comparably\nuh carefully because you said the word\ncompetitive\nlike 15 times and it sounded to me like\nthat was code for something else\num but i i mean it i i mean i haven't\nfigured out how to avoid twitch drama\nif that if that's your end if that's\nwhat your real question is\num yeah i mean they're\nuh for for me uh i i am carefully\nsaying what i say um yeah i can tell\njust i i don't i don't want to get into\na situation\nlike that pretty much ever again i don't\nwant to say something that\nwouldn't or like give people a wrong\nimpression\nor i'll try to correct that wrong\nimpression as soon as i think i might\nhave given it\num but but i i think five up so\nmaybe here i can give you some concrete\nadvice and then i'll try to i'll try to\nlike circle back to\nwhat on earth i was trying to say for\nthe last hour um but\nlet me say this so i think when you\nchoose your words very very carefully\ni think people can tell and i think if\nanything\nit highlights like something weird\nright so so i think sometimes being\ntransparent and authentic\nand kind of accepting of things is\nactually\nlike way better from a drama reduction\nstandpoint\nthan being like choosing your words\nsuper carefully\ni feel like that's hard to do because it\nis hard to do so\nso like i think like for example if i if\ni had to say\nif i was in your situation here's how i\nwould tell the story\nso felix and i were in an among us game\nwe're both [ __ ] competitive he\ngot super [ __ ] toxic i got super\n[ __ ] toxic\ni thought i was less toxic than he was\nwe got into it our chats started yelling\nat each other now the internet hates him\nand his chat hates me and i like felix\nand i want to be able to play with him\nbut it's [ __ ] awkward every time\nwe're in the lobby now\nand i just want to be able to play the\ngame and i think he just wants to be\nable to play\nthe game and i wish everyone would\n[ __ ] come calm the [ __ ] down\nthere's the there's the side of me also\nthat it's like\ni have my opinions um\ni don't think what i said was wrong and\ni don't think what i said was toxic\nand i will die on that hill\num so it's like it's a god there's the\nattachment\nso so it's a matter of like\ni'm not going to\njust not give out my opinion\num and if i say something i mean\neverything i say generally\ni'm not a toxic person and i've never\nbeen\nso that's why that situation bothered me\nheavily\nyeah so so i think it's taken us about\nan hour and a half to find which hail\nyou're willing to die on because that's\nan attachment\ni haven't detected an attachment in you\n5 up until this moment\neverything that you've said\nso now now the question is like why is\nit so important\nfor you to die on that hill\num\n[Music]\ni i guess just because i believe what\ni'm saying and\nif\nif something's bothering me i will try\nand say it\nin a more respectful way i don't want to\nlike burn bridges with anyone\ni don't want to um i don't want to teach\npeople from\nlike if i'm in front of people i want to\nlike give them it's okay that you don't\nhave to accept an apology or you don't\nhave to say you're sorry\ni wanted to say um\ni i want to stand for what i believe in\nand if what i think is right i'm going\nto\nsay that i'm not going to say no i'm\nwrong like that's not\nhow i want to think about things yeah so\nso i i\noddly enough i i think that's okay so i\nthink it's okay to die on a hill\nbut let me just so i still think you can\nbe transparent about that\num there's a degree of transparency that\nyou can go to\nwhere it\nyou can have an opinion about something\non twitch or another person\nand it's not good to say that sometimes\nlike sure some people say whatever the\n[ __ ] they want and\ngo for it i mean that's fine uh but i\nalso don't think that's like a good\nenvironment at the same time for\nlike having a relationship with people\nand if you're no matter what going to be\nin contact with\nuh x person um\nwhether that's like in your control or\nnot just because of the nature\nso uh community and such let me be let\nme be let me circle back to your\noriginal question five up\nso you said you know what like how do\nyou influence\npeople like in twitch chat and my answer\nwas\ni would be a little bit more transparent\nthan your being\nso that's my answer right so like like i\nagree with you i mean i have all kinds\nof opinions that i don't share\nso for everything that i say there are\nlike nine things that i don't say\nso i'm not advocating for like radical\nhonesty i think that's\nidiotic so i i think but\nsomething tells me that you know\nsomething about the way that you speak\ni think twitch chat so twitch chat is\nlike very very like intuitive\nlike they're very smart and they're also\nlike deeply empathic\nand i think they sniff out bs\nand i think one thing that you do\nproject when you choose your words very\nvery carefully is it sets people's bs\nmeter off\nand and so if you want to like calm chat\ndown it's been my experience that you\nhave to be like honest with them and you\nhave to sort of treat them with respect\nlike don't try to pull a fast one over\non them because it's not gonna work\nand just you know just and then like if\nthere's something that you stand behind\ni think it's okay to say it\num and but at the same time if you feel\nlike it's going to create more drama\nthen it's a tricky balance like don't\nget me wrong\ni i i think that you know it's hard like\nwhen you're\nwhen you when you play at a\ntension-inducing game like among us\nwith streamers and not everyone is going\nto be quite as like\ndetached as you are it's part of what\nmakes them successful right is being\nemotionally invested in the games that\nthey play like i think this is gonna\nhappen\nyeah um\nthat's not my my\ni could say this also um with what i\nsaid with\nregarding xqc in that moment i would say\nthe same thing again\ni don't have regrets on that um if that\narose again uh with a different person i\nwould\nsay my opinion on it um what actually\nhappened i i don't even\nknow i'm saying that oh what happened\nwas\ni\nin the for when that whole situation\nhappened\nhe just every time i played with him\nhe would vote me out as in he they call\nbutton nobody's dead and still vote me\nout\nthat was how the game was played and\ni sat through that um for two hours on a\nspecific day on other days i enjoyed\nhopefully playing with him but on that\nday it was just\nuh like already being tilted\njust going into it where i have\neverything\nuh going for me in a game and then\ni just get voted out because it was me\nand it was always him doing it and that\ngot on my nerves\nand then whenever i call him out it's\nlike he called me like\nit just discredited everything i said\nand eventually it left me to\nleave the lobby i left politely i\nthere's there's a video on it i mean i i\ntry to make things\nas peaceful as an exit as i could and\nit's just because i left on me catching\nhim\nand just the whole situation going down\nhorribly and then me saying it after and\nthen that exploding\nand then\ni don't want to say some stuff i'd be\nfine messaging you some stuff but i\ndon't want to say some stuff\nthat's fine and i just i was just like\nyou're talking around something and i\ndon't know\nyes there is something i'm talking\naround and i can't say it that's fine\ndon't worry about it i mean i i think at\nthe end of the day like\nso your original question so it sounds\nlike this was just a mess\nyeah it was it was a disaster definitely\nso um but\nthat's not my main worry that was that\nwas a a battle between him and that's\nover with we've\nspoken it's fine um my thing with twitch\nhas\nthere is such a juxtaposition between\ni don't try and hide stuff um i'm i'm\nbeing selective what i say right now\nbecause it's related to this specific\ntopic\nif i'm talking about like it seems like\nchat as a whole it doesn't matter how\nlike i'm playing with friends when i\nplay right now\nit's i genuinely enjoy love everyone\nthat i play with right now\num but if they do something stupid it's\neveryone just in insane\num toxicity towards that streamer and\nit's the juxtaposition of like\nwhy why is that happening when there's\nlike no hostility\nin the game in general someone made a\nmistake it's a game about deception and\ni can't i i just don't know why that's\nhappening and it's\nso many people and i it's\nvirtually impossible to control okay so\ni mean that i have sort of a slightly\ndifferent answer for\nso you know i went off on i feel like\nthis conversation has been a lot of\ntangents that i'm going off on that may\nnot be very relevant to what we're\nactually talking about or where you are\nso i apologize for that but i'll share\nwith you something that we try to tell\nour coaches\num which is that be careful about\njudging your own influence and what i\nmean by that is that we frequently have\nthe situation where our coaches feel\nlike they\nget like they're like i'm not doing\nenough for my client\nlike my client is still struggling like\nthey're depressed every day or like\nthey're\nhaving trouble finding a girlfriend or\nwhatever and our coaches meet with\npeople on a weekly basis weekly basis\nand they kind of meet with them week\nafter week after week and it sort of\nfeels like\nsince the person doesn't have a\ngirlfriend our coaches can feel very\nfrust not frustrated but really um\nlike they're letting down their client\nso\none of the things that we try to tell\nthem is that you know be careful because\nchange happens slowly\nand it's very very hard to judge your\nimpact on something\nin a short term so what i would say to\nyou actually\nfive up is that like you know if people\nrespond to someone making a mistake with\ntoxicity\nyou can model the right kind of behavior\nand if you\nchip away at that long enough you'll\nstart to see a change\nthe other thing i mean you can even use\nsome particular techniques\nif you really want to get into it but\nyou can help people understand their\ntoxicity\nand it can be as simple as like hey\neveryone is jumping down\nxqc's throat right now or my throat it's\nhard for yourself\nbut if someone you know if someone makes\na mistake and everyone jumps on them you\ncan ask people hey i'm noticing that a\nlot of people are jumping down this\nperson's throat\nyou know what's going on there you can\nask an open-ended question or you can\neven pull a dr k\nand ask like how do you guys feel about\nthis person making a mistake\nand then as you bring attention and\nawareness to the behavior\nit tends to get better like once people\nrealize what they're doing that they're\nactually channeling their frustration\nout on someone else and if you can bring\nattention to it it'll kind of slow down\nokay i mean i feel like i've done\nat least that to a degree and i try to\nas much as possible\nit just doesn't feel like the the result\nis much i guess right so\nthat's where you have to think a little\nbit about what is your\nwhen you say the result doesn't it\ndoesn't feel like the result as much\nso that you have to pay attention to\nlike how calibrated that instrument is\nand what are your expectations\nright so what's your ability to detect\nchange\nin in an among us game are you expecting\nthat\npatterns that have been reinforced\nthrough years of gaming and blaming\nother people because\nthat's what games tend to make us do are\ngonna be wiped away by one comment\nor a dozen comments or comments over the\ncourse of three months\nno obviously not well i i\ni don't know right so what's your\nexpectation on like\nwhat would change look like like what\nare you looking for\num i just don't\nwant like my ideal world\ni guess is if someone makes a mistake in\nthe game\num whether i mean so hofu is the main\nperson i play with\num became really really good friends\nwith her um\ni guess they're among us and there is so\nmuch blatant\ni guess sexism um\nlike if she does something that like she\ncatches me in a lie\nor um or someone makes a dumb play in\nthat lobby\nthen the chat will just\ngo like rampant like pure rampage on\nlike\ni hate this person they caught like it's\npeople are so invested into what happens\ntowards me in a game where i understand\nwhat the game's about but even when i\ntry to\nlike i defend people 24 7 i guess\nand that's the biggest like i don't it's\nhard to control that\nokay is there some way to observe\nan among us game i mean watching a\nstream i guess\nor what do you mean by like are you guys\non a discord call or like how does that\nwork\nwe are on discord yes\nso like everyone who's in the game is on\ndiscord yes so we play the round we're\nall muted\nand then when a body is found we all\nmute and talk in the meeting\nand there's no looking at chat during\nthe game because people will say\nspoilers so\ni can't control my chat while i'm alive\nin the game unless i'm an imposter\nso if i'm a crewmate like it's all mod's\nresponsibility\num can i can i actually\nwatch this like can i sit in a discord\ncall with you guys one day\nsure i don't want to actually play the\ngame is there is there like an observer\nposition in the game\nyou would have to watch a stream there's\nno spectator there's no spectator okay\ni'm just a little bit curious now i find\nmyself being curious about what y'all's\nactual interactions look like it's\nanyway so that that's one thought\num because i i feel like if you wanted\nmore advice about how to handle that\nit's just such a unique environment that\ni don't know\ni feel like me just watching it once i'd\nactually be able to answer your question\nway better okay\num because i played like i said i played\namong us once\nand and like it was like with our\ncommunity and like\nour communities like super healthy\nlike everyone cares about each other and\n[ __ ] so i feel like i didn't even i\nhaven't been\ni haven't seen this world that you're\ntalking about i've been in the kiddie\npool\nand you guys are like swimming in the\nenglish channel and it's just not\nit's not the same at all\num yeah just watch any um\namong the stream where someone\ngets caught i guess so just the\nreactions\nfive up i wanna if it's okay with you i\nwanna try to circle back and like\nshare something with you in a sensical\nway before we wrap up is that cool\nsure so a lot of people have been asking\num you know\ni kind of early on i sort of said that i\nthink like you're you're spiritually\ngifted\nand people are kind of confused by what\nthat means i'm sure you're confused by\nwhat that means so that that's kind of\nlike\ni just want to address that for a second\nand do something that i i do\nkind of rarely which is like advise you\nso\nfive up so it seems to me like you know\nlike i kind of said earlier you were\nborn with good rng\nso you have a certain kind of like mind\nso it sounds like you're intelligent um\nit sounds like you\ngrew up you know i'm not hearing any any\ninkling of like abuse or anything like\nthat although maybe it's just really\nreally well hidden\num but i'm not hearing that you struggle\nwith any negative emotions\nor not when i say it's not that you\ndon't have negative emotions it seems\nlike you're pretty good at like kind of\nprocessing with\nthem processing them dealing with them\nthings like that\nand when i kind of ask you like okay\nwhat are you going to do in your life\nand it sounds like you've got a strong\ninternal compass\nthat sort of is like yeah college is not\nactually something that i need to do so\ni'm not going to do it\ni'm not hearing i mean this could be\nthere but you know\ni'm not hearing um that you\nin high school were thought that you\nshould go to a place like harvard or\nyale or whatever\nstanford and that you were afraid that\nyou wouldn't get in so you like decided\nnot to apply at all i'm not\ngetting that whiff um did you have those\nkinds of thoughts or feelings\num there's a there's a big element of\ncomparing myself to my brother\nwhere uh\ni i we didn't dive too far into this i\nguess for the school\nmy brother was a complete straight a\nlike beyond honor student\num and then because of the the\nsituations that i learned from like the\nfirst\neight years of school i guess where it\ndidn't matter like\nit felt like uh my perception of school\nwas they all taught\nat least the school that i went to um i\nlive in arizona\nthe way the school systems work here is\nthey pay the teachers based off of\nthe grades people get not just for the\nstudents so\na lot of the teachers would\ninflate people's grades just so they get\nbetter pay also\nso it i realized that i was all teaching\nto the test\nand not necessarily teaching people and\ni heavily disagreed with that and it\nmade me lose a heavy interest in school\nso it was\nhere's my brother getting perfect grades\nworking hard because\nhe he knew what he wanted to do that\nrequired\nstuff like really good grades to get in\nand\nthen i just had a complete loss of\ninterest\nin all that because of how the system\nworked\nso it wasn't necessarily that i got good\ngrades\num but it was like here i am not\nnecessarily doing the best in school\nbut that's off my own volition but\nhere's my brother doing the best and\nit's like\nwell i mean i there is the pressure from\nfamily to do very well\nso not necessarily like harvard but\nthere is good school\num they're like you know probably should\ngo to that potentially\nokay so maybe maybe i i i've misjudged\nthis\ni don't think i'm entirely wrong but\nthat sounds way more\nof sometimes what happens so maybe\nthat's worth\nyou know exploring a little bit further\nunfortunately i i have to get going in a\nfew minutes but\nyou know it may be far more pedestrian\nthan than i thought\num in terms of just you know standard\ncomparison and stuff and i apologize for\nnot\nexploring that with you i think that was\nalso my fault for not like going\nto that degree because that's definitely\nimportant\nyeah so but let's kind of just circle\nback to this idea of like spiritually\ngifted because i still think that that's\ntrue\nso so then then i think the next thing\nto kind of think about is that like you\nseem to have\nyou know streaming success kind of\ndumped in your lap\nlike you sort of fell into it um\nand you're kind of like focusing on like\nfun for now\nand things like that and and you're kind\nof like okay what am i going to do that\nwill give me more freedom what am i\ngoing to do that i\nenjoy and it seems to me like you kind\nof just put those\ntogether and like you know you move in\nthe direction that is good for your like\nlong-term security and that is like\nenjoyable\ni'm not hearing you as the kind of\nperson who will like\nsacrifice eight years of your life to\nbecome a doctor if you don't enjoy doing\nthat\nright and and so the other interesting\nthing is that i i do think you\nyou genuinely have a fair amount of\ndetachment and what i mean by that is\nthat if your streaming career tanked in\na year i think you would be okay with\nthat\nyou'd sort of be sad because you\nrecognized that you maybe had an\nopportunity that you missed\nor you squandered something or something\nalong those lines\nmaybe you screwed up in some way and so\nyou'd be kind of sad about that\nbut you'd also be like relatively\ncalculating and sort of think about okay\nhow could i do it better next time\nbut overall i'm getting the sense that\nyou're going to be okay\nand here's here's what i'm i would tell\nyou five up the first thing is that if\nat some point you feel\ndirectionless you know i do think that\nthere is a system of\nexploration of the self and the meaning\nof life and things like that\nwhich i think may be interesting to you\nand hopefully helpful\nwhich is sort of like this eastern\nperspective on like life and and\nkarma and things like that i'm not\ntrying to you know say like you don't\nhave to\nit's not about religion it's just about\num\nwhen i think about religion i tend to\nthink about like belief systems\nand sort of like you know faith and\nthings like that\nit's really more um\nan exploration of like how stuff works\nit's about understanding what are the\ndifferent way like why are we here like\nhow does this stuff work\nwhat should i do with my life what is\nthe nature of happiness\nwhere does happiness come from where\ndoes desire come from\nyou strike me as someone who would\nreally really enjoy\nand probably benefit from some amount of\nformal instruction and this kind of\nstuff\nbecause i think you figure a lot of this\nstuff out on your own and all i'm\ntelling you is that\nyou know you may like it's kind of like\nyou're working through the laws of\nphysics on your own and it's like hey by\nthe way there's a physics textbook you\ncan read\nwhich you should still question um\nyou know and by all means you should\nquestion it's a big part of it\nbut i think that you know you may find a\nlot of value in that because i i think\nthat a lot of the\ncommon wisdom may not apply to you\nbecause i think you're different\nfive up um and for people that i've i've\nmet who are sort of like you they tend\nto find\na lot of solace and direction in\nsome of these texts the next thing that\ni would say to you is that i think that\nyou're gonna sort of gradually feel\nempty if you continue this path for a\nlong time\ni don't think you should deviate from it\nnow but what i mean is that\nright now you're sort of leaning towards\nthe next strategically best thing\nthat fills you with the most enjoyment\nfrom day to day\nthe thing that challenges you the most\nthe thing that gives you a sense of\nmastery\nand you're gonna do that right like you\nsaid you're gonna do baking for a little\nwhile and then\nlike don't get too caught up in baking\nbecause i'm gonna move on to something\nagree you're gonna learn three languages\nyou're gonna learn how to bake you're\ngonna stream some\nand then you'll get to be 25 and then\nyou'll get to be 30 and you'll get to be\n35 and you'll have accumulated a lot of\nskills\nand then that process and this is the\nreal point that i've been trying to make\nthat process of chasing after one thing\nat a time until you sort of master it\nand move on\nis gonna start to feel empty does that\nmake sense\nyeah it makes a lot of sense and that's\nwhy i'm telling you like i've talked to\nyou when you're 30 and i've talked to\nyou when you're 45 and that's what i've\nseen from people like you\nand then ultimately what brings these\npeople happiness\nis like us a stark and difficult\nexploration that's entirely internal\nand if you have questions about that or\nif at some point you feel directionless\nor you feel like you have difficulty you\nknow and you don't know what to do with\nyour life like\nyou know shoot me a dm because i i may\nbe able to give you some concrete\nrecommendations at that time\nall right i'll remember that is that\nno yeah that makes sense okay that's\nbasically what i was trying because i i\nthink like you can't live\nnormal people's lives if you're not a\nnormal person\nand i i think you've already figured\nthat out um\nand there may be some stuff around\ncomparison and ego and\nand not being able to live up to\nexpectations and stuff\nbut at the end of the day you know i\nthink you can keep on doing what you're\ndoing but\nyou'll move from one thing to the next\nto the next to the next\nand you may feel accomplished and you\nmay feel like you're progressing but\nit'll start to feel empty\nis my guess\nyeah i can\ni mean that is a worry um that i've had\nso i thought about that a little bit um\nso i i definitely know what you're\nsaying\nbut but i i would also say that\nthere's no it's worth it for you to go\ndown that road\nso you feel that worry very genuinely\ni don't know i'm not saying you should\navoid that is what i'm saying\nno i mean i i'm definitely still going\nto\npursue a lot of my goals yeah yeah i\nthink you should\nabsolutely any last questions for me\nfive up\num not so much question but more of like\na\nthank you for talking to me i guess not\nhaving the time\nyeah of course man i i you know i feel\nlike i kind of owe you an apology\nbecause i'm not sure how helpful this\nwas and i\ni really do try to help people but i\ndon't know maybe it's not having the cam\ni'm not quite sure no i mean i think it\nwas\nif anything like no matter how helpful\nit was i mean talking to a person is\nalso nice about the\nthings and advice about it from a\ndifferent perspective\nit's always really good\nyeah i feel like i have i have a karmic\ndebt that needs to be paid\nin this conversation i feel like what\ni'm supposed to give you i haven't given\nyou yet\nhmm\num i think you i think you have\nto a very big degree but also\ni don't think i've given you the means\nto like i don't think i know what i need\nto give to\nhelp you also i guess possible\ni i don't need um just to clarify i\ndon't need you to\nit's just a feeling i'm sharing with you\nokay it's not a particular response i'm\nlooking for\nbut you know\nyeah i was just letting you know maybe\nwe can talk more about your brother\nsure um so\nlisten thank you very much and are you\ninterested in learning meditation\nfive up um sure\ni mean i've yeah\nwhat am i going to teach you have you\nhave you watched our\nhave you learned alternate nostril\nbreathing\ni don't think so actually we're gonna do\na different one for you\num okay give me a second\nokay so i'm gonna do something a little\nbit different for you okay i want you to\nclose your eyes okay and listen to the\nsound of your breath\ncan you hear it\nand so what i want you to do is\nphonetically spell out the sound of the\nbreath\nthat's hard\nso can you give me anything give me a\nbad answer before a good one\ncan we say it out loud sure whatever\nyou've got whatever you\nwhatever you can think of\ni think it's like inhaling is a lot of\nlike\ns's and exhaling is a lot of h's\nokay good so practice it for\na couple of weeks and then let me know\nand just see if you can figure it out\nokay\nokay\nthat's difficult all right yeah so it\nrequires it requires\npractice and it requires you focusing\nyour attention\non something relatively internal\nbut i i think for definitely for you\nfive up\nyou want well i mean you can learn\nformal meditation at some point but\ni think an investigative technique is\ndefinitely the way for you to start\nokay\nany last thoughts or questions before\nyou wrap up\ngood answer by the way you're on the\nright track okay\num i don't i don't think i have\na question that comes to mind right now\nuh anything from your side i guess nope\nthat's all right yeah take care\nall right well thank you for having me\nthanks for coming on five up and i\ni really do want to watch one of y'all's\nuh among us streams now\nyeah we usually play at um 8 p.m pst or\nit's not 8 pm 8 am pst\nuh go all the way until like generally 2\np.m or not 2 p.m\n1 okay p.m\nand sometimes we do night streams okay\ncool\nsounds good all right take care man i'll\nget some\nthank you too bye bye\nall right chad ours sorry about that i\ni don't know what was going on i don't\nknow if it was me or him or not the face\nor what\nbut i felt like i was kind of off my\ngame today"
