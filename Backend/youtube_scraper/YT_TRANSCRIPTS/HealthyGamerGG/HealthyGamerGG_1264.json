coaching and a\nway to sign up for our wait list\nclick the first link in the description\nhey guys dr k here\nso today i'd like to talk to you guys a\nlittle bit about\nnon-clinical depression or what i call\ncongruent depression\nnow this is kind of a weird video\nbecause in this series on depression\nso far we may have focused a lot on like\nclinical depression\nor what we think of is an illness right\nso let's just stop for a second\nand kind of think through this so\ndepression right now like\nin the world and certainly in developed\ncountries seems to be getting worse\nand why is that so it's my belief that a\nlot of people are depressed\ncertainly people are getting depressed\nand then they go to see a psychiatrist\nand then a psychiatrist may diagnose\nthem with an illness\nright they say that your something about\nyou is broken or ill\nand then they'll provide for them\ntreatment like medication\nand part of the reason that i think\ndepression is getting worse is that even\nthough people are seeing more\npsychiatrists\nnot all of the depression that people\nexperience\nis an illness and somewhere along the\nway as\na society we started assuming that if\nyou're depressed\nthat also means you're ill so let's\nthink about that\nand kind of take a step back and try to\nunderstand what is\nillness and is it possible for a\ndepression\nto for you to be depressed but it not be\nsome kind of malfunction\nand i think once we think through that\nwe'll start to see like\nhow to move forward if we're not\nactually ill or malfunctioning\nso the first thing to think about is\nthat an illness is like a malfunction\nit's something in your body that isn't\ndoing what it's supposed to be doing so\nif we think about let's say like getting\nthe common cold\nour nose is sometimes supposed to\nproduce mucus and sometimes we're\nsupposed to cough if maybe we get\nsomething stuck in our throat\nbut when we get ill with a cold our body\nstarts to produce way more mucus than\nnormal and it\nstarts to cough when maybe it's not\nsupposed to\nand so we can kind of think about that\nas an illness it's the body not working\nthe way it's supposed to\nif we think about blood pressure so our\nblood pressure\nis supposed to stay within a particular\nrange and then when we get something\nlike hypertension\nour blood pressure rises above what it's\nsupposed to do\nso that too is a malfunction and\nsometimes\nour brain malfunctions and we end up\nwith clinical depression\nand so what that means is that like what\nthat really means is that your\nbrain is malfunctioning compared to what\nyou are supposed to be doing\nso if your life is going really well and\nlike you have a good job and maybe\nyou're in a relationship and you know\nthere are people in your life who care\nabout you\nand at the same time you wake up every\nday and you feel sort of sad and empty\nthat's more consistent with a clinical\ndepression because we look at this\nperson's life and we say this person\nshould be happy\nand if they should be happy and they're\nwaking up every day and they're sad that\nimplies to me that there's a malfunction\nand if something is broken that also\nimplies a particular way that we're\nsupposed to fix it\nso in this person maybe their serotonin\nsystem is malfunctioning or their\nserotonin is low\nwhich is why we can consider doing\nsomething like giving them medication\nand then if we correct that sort of\nserotonin imbalance they start to live\nthe normal life that they're supposed to\nbut the tricky thing is that not\neveryone who's depressed\nshould be happy right and in fact if we\nreally stop and think about it\na lot of people who are depressed maybe\nshould be depressed\nand what i mean by that is that it's\nactually normal or i like to use the\nword congruent\nwith your situation if you're stuck in\nlife if you don't have a job you don't\nhave a fulfilling\nromantic relationship you're kind of\nsocially isolated\nit's almost like you're supposed to feel\ndepressed in that kind of situation\nso unlike clinical depression congruent\ndepression\nis kind of like appropriate to your\nsituation\nnow this gets tricky because clinical\ndepression can\ncome out of something that is is\nlike you know not good in your life like\nif you lose your job you can sort of get\na clinical depression that's\ntriggered by a bad circumstance but the\nkey factor there is that if the bad\ncircumstance\nis fixed someone with congruent\ndepression will start to feel better\nin someone with clinical depression now\nthat the clinical episode has been\ntriggered\nit has a lifespan of its own that's\nindependent of its circumstances\nso if we think about clinical depression\nonce again it's\nepisodic so it has it has a start and it\nhas a finish\ncongruent depression can be more\nlong-lasting can last for years or even\nyour entire life\nand is sort of related to like major\nshortcomings in your life\nso sometimes people will come into my\noffice and they'll say i've been\ndepressed\never since i was 15 and they're like 30\nyears old so they've been depressed\nevery day since they were 15.\nwhen i think about that person and i\ntalked to that person i don't think\nabout a neurochemical imbalance which\nhas been\nsort of off for 15 years i think that\nthis person\nis depressed because there's something\nin their life that's fundamentally\nlacking\nthere so people who have congruent\ndepression\noftentimes have a life that lacks\npurpose\nthey lack motivation because there's\nlike no end goal that they're moving\ntowards\nthey sort of feel loneliness and\nsometimes they feel paralyzed by their\nloneliness\nthey feel stuck they feel like they're\nliving their life on autopilot\ntheir life can feel like a blur like\nyou're fast forwarding through your life\nwith video games\nsubstances binge watching shows social\nmedia\nlike you wake up every day and you just\nengage with devices or things that\naffect your dopamine system without\nactually like living life it's just like\na blur\none day becomes the next one day becomes\na week one week becomes a month\none month becomes a year one one year\nbecomes three years\nyou don't know what you're doing it's\nalmost like you kind of become the\nzombie\npeople who feel like they're behind when\nthey're comparing themselves to other\npeople like\nyou know they look at all these other\npeople who are way more successful than\nthem\nand for years and years and years they\nfeel more behind more behind more behind\nnow is that a problem absolutely is it\ndepression\nabsolutely but is it a brain malfunction\ni'm not so sure and that's the idea\nbehind a congruent depression\ni think some of the depression we\nexperience in life isn't\nactually our brain malfunctioning it's\nour brain functioning the way that it's\nsort of supposed to\nor it's our brain doing the best to be\nadaptive which can sometimes cause us\nproblems\nbut it's almost like an appropriate\ndepression or as if it's\ncongruent to our circumstances\nand so like if we think about that we\nkind of have to take a step back and we\nhave to ask ourselves like why you know\nif\nsadness and depression aren't a\nmalfunction\nthen what is their function and that\nbegs the question\nwhy have our brains evolved to\nexperience sadness or depression in the\nfirst place\nwhy do we even have negative emotions\nand it turns out that sadness and\ndepression are\nour brains way of signaling to us that\nwe need to\nfix something in our life right like if\nwe feel lonely\nthat sort of if we think if you take it\nthe average person let's not talk about\nsomeone who really has congruent\ndepression but if we think about just in\ngeneral\nthe feeling of loneliness why does our\nbrain have the feeling of loneliness\nand that's because it's our brain's way\nof telling us like hey we need to\nconnect with other human beings and then\nusually\npeople who feel lonely will reach out to\nsomeone or they'll you know call their\nfriends or they'll reach out to their\nparents or they'll\nmessage their their gaming buddies and\nthen you'll get together\nand then that loneliness kind of goes\naway a lot of negative\nfeelings that we have negative emotions\nor feelings of depression\nare actually our brain or our being\nour self way of like giving us a compass\nto move forward and make a positive\nchange\nin life dissatisfaction with ourselves\nhelps us learn what our compass is and\nhelps us actually move\nforward loneliness actually pulls us\ntowards other people\nfeeling like you're lacking purpose is\nyour brain's way of telling you to like\nhey like\nlet's go do something because this life\nis not cutting it for us right now\nso like if these things are sort of good\nfor us then like what's the problem\nright why don't we just\njust feel i mean it's kind of weird but\nlike what's the problem with this if\nthis is our compass like isn't that a\ngood thing\nand this is where i think we get into\nsome really tricky stuff which is that\nthese signals from our brain used to\nhave easy solutions\nand i think the reason that we suffer\nnow is because they don't really have\nsolutions that used to be simple like\nthey were\nremember that our brains and our you\nknow emotions and things like that\nevolved millions of years ago and were\nsort of like designed for a more simple\nlifestyle\nlike if you think about you know\nloneliness and connection like i'm\nindian and like a thousand even 50 years\nago\nin india there used to be arranged\nmarriages so romantic loneliness was\nlike in a sense less of an\nissue kind of or i'm sort of making that\nclaim\nbecause like you know your your partner\nor your spouse was kind of chosen for\nyou by your family anyway and like 50\nyears ago 100 years ago\n1000 years ago it's not like things are\ntoday with tinder where like you know\nyou have to meet a thousand people and\nlike 999 of them reject you there isn't\nthat same sense of rejection because our\nsociety\nhas started to evolve in a particular\nway that is leaving our brains\nand our evolutionary like emotional\ncircuitry kind of behind\nour brain and evolution just can't keep\npace with the rapid change of society\nso these these compasses these feelings\nthat we used to have\nused to have generally speaking easier\nsolutions\nbut i think the solutions have gotten\nmore difficult\nand it's harder to actually figure out\nhow to move forward\nanother good example of this is like you\nknow if you think about\nlet's say once again in india if you go\nback 200 years there used to be a caste\nsystem so you were sort of born into a\ncast\nand your job was kind of determined by\nwhat your family's job is\nthere wasn't really like much choice\nlike finding purpose in your life was\nlike pretty simple because\nyou know your dad is a farmer his dad\nwas a farmer your mom is a farmer her\nmom was a farmer you all are all farmers\nso what are you gonna do you're gonna be\na farmer\nand so in a sense things were a little\nbit more simple whereas\nnow if you're lacking purpose like there\nisn't a clear answer how you go about\nfinding it\nand what that means is that you wake up\nevery day and you're kind of feeling\ndepressed\nand and it's almost like congruent with\nyour life because your life actually\ndoesn't have a whole lot\nof purpose you're not really doing\nanything that benefits the world in a\nprofound way so like\nthat's how you should feel in a bizarre\nway\nand so i'm not saying that you know it\nsort of makes sense to me\nwhy congruent depression happens that\ndoesn't mean that we need to accept it\nor that we shouldn't fix it in fact\nquite the opposite\ni think actually a big part of why we're\neven making these videos is to help\npeople understand that\nif you wake up and you feel depressed\nbecause you have not no reason to get\nout of bed in the morning\nthe solution to that may not be to go\nsee a psychiatrist and get started on a\nmedication\nthe solution is to learn in our current\nworld\nhow you go about finding purpose how you\ngo about\nfinding meaning how you go about\ndiscovering the nature of motivation and\nwhere it comes from\nand so in order to do that we have to\ndig into a lot of really important\nquestions\nlike where purpose comes from how to\nstart comparing to others\nor sorry how to stop comparing to others\nand start living your own life\nhow fantasies keep us stuck where hope\ncomes from how to overcome hopelessness\nhow to develop confidence and what the\nthe challenge here is that like\nwhat's happened is as we sort of\nmedicalized depression\nwe stopped looking for answers to all of\nthose questions and we started saying oh\nyour problem is that you have a\nneurochemical imbalance\nso here's a pill to fix that and so our\nsociety has been sort of\nfocusing on the medical definition of\ndepression\nas we sort of study neurochemistry and\nwe have\npharma pharmacology companies that are\ncoming out with new drugs\nwe put so much emphasis in that\ndirection that we've stopped\nasking ourselves these questions and i\nthink\nthat if you're depressed there are two\noptions right one is that you actually\nyour brain is malfunctioning\nand the other is that it's functioning\nperfectly fine\nand in either case there's certainly a\nway forward in the case of a malfunction\nwe want to correct the malfunction\nbut in case of a congruent depression we\nneed to start answering some of those\nquestions right like where does\ndepression come from what are all of the\nthings that we're i'm feeling\nwhat are all of the ways in which\ndepression manifests in my life\nthere could be a neurochemical imbalance\nthere could be like a lack of\nspirituality or a lack of like you know\npurpose in your life\nso we have to differentiate these out\nbecause if we use\npills to fix all that it's not going to\nwork for half of it\nand that's the whole reason to think\nabout a congruent depression\nso in your case you know if you've been\nfeeling depressed for years\nand have these like big issues that like\nmake you\nunhappy in life certainly psychotherapy\nor seeing like a therapist could help\nbut chances are your solution is\nactually going to be in finding purpose\nin finding meaning and\nunderstanding yourself better and sort\nof\nfixing your loneliness developing\nconfidence and we're going to dive into\nthat\nas well"
