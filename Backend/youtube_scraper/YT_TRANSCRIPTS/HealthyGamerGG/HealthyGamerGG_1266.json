    "transcript": "you know like healthy gamer is new and\nit's like did\nwas this going to work like how on earth\nwould we think that this would be\nsuccessful\nwe wouldn't think this would be\nsuccessful it was done before\nand yet we did it anyway and that's how\nwe started and that's what we do now\nlike that's where our coaching program\ncomes from i started streaming on twitch\nand i was like okay this is what needs\nto\nwe need to try this then people were\nlike dr k help me dr k\nhelp me dr chao and i was like oh [ __ ] a\nlot of people to help\ncan't do them all myself can i train\nother people so let's try is it going to\nwork we don't know\nlet's try and so that's what we did\nand then like we started off with mostly\nindividual coaching\nand then what we realized is that like\nthere are\nshared issues that people struggle with\nand these are things like\nyou know people like feeling awkward and\nlacking purpose and being lonely\nand like not having someone to share\nthose feelings with and work through\nthose problems with\nthey don't have someone to help and\nthat's where group coaching comes in so\nthen we evolved group coaching\nand so group coaching is about you know\npersonal coaching i think is really good\nfor people who have like a particular\nissue that's very specific to them\nbut generally speaking what we find in\ngroup coaching is that the issues that\nyou think are super specific to you are\nactually shared by a whole bunch of\nother people\nand let's think about that because if\nthat wasn't true this stream would be\nnowhere if this\nif the people that i interviewed did not\nresonate with all of our audience\nthe stream would be nowhere why do you\nguys watch because you connect with the\nperson that we talk to\nand the problems that you share you\ndon't have to fight those battles on\nyour own\nthat's why we started groups groups are\ntricky they take a while to start\npeople are confused about how to do them\nbut their outcomes are very good\nand they like groups kind of gain\nmomentum over time\nright like you don't know like what in\nwhat way you need to improve\na lot of areas of your life that need to\nimprove and then like other people are\ngonna be the same way they're like i\ndon't know where to start\nright like i'm i i'm not in a romantic\nrelationship i don't have a good job\ni'm not doing well in my classes and\nthen like\nthose people help you and remember that\nthe real value of healthy gamer\nis that it's easier to see\nin someone else your problems\nit's easy to look at them objectively\nbecause when you look at someone else\nwith anxiety\nit's like way easier to understand it\nbecause you're not experiencing it in\nthat moment\nso the real way that growth happens in\ngroup is actually by\nwhen i share an experience i benefit\nsome from it but then everyone else\nactually benefits more\nand then they share their version and\nthen i benefit from that and then like\nwhat happens is each person\nbrings one piece of the puzzle to the\ntable and with a dozen of you all or 10\nor all or 80 all you'll put\nyou'll put those puzzle pieces together\nand then it's cool it's great\nall right you looking good feeling good\nuh-huh let's get started cool okay\ndon't mind if i do\num yeah so anita have you been i've been\nall right yeah\nbusy busy busy but getting more sleep\nand taking a little bit more care of\nmyself than i used to\nso that's great i'm really happy to hear\nthat seriously i i think you deserve to\ntake care of yourself\nyou deserve to be cared for by yourself\nand um are you wearing a hat that says\nsimp\nyeah can you tell me about that\nall right so um i\ni me and uh stream elements we we\ndesigned merch\nand i was thinking to myself uh what\nwould be really relatable\nand very appropriate for my chat and\nthis is how the hat happened and i just\nhappen to like it and i just wear it day\nto day\ni i i actually really love my sit pad\nso yeah that's the full story i think\nit's uh\nit's a good way um okay so i guess i can\nshare this story hopefully it's not\nidentifiable\nand if the person that i'm talking to\nyeah there's no way that people are\ngonna so i was talking to someone who is\nyesterday i was working with someone who\nwas a little bit concerned about\num their hair\nuh because they're kind of going bald\nand the problem is\nyou're going bald yeah i'm losing my\nhair\nthat's scary yeah uh it's impossible to\nfind out why kids are covered because\nthere\nare like doctors and everything are\nreally they've got their hands full\nso i guess i'll find out sometime\nthrew me for a loop there but let me\njust finish my story real quick and then\nyou know we can talk about that if you\nwant to but um so they were feeling like\npretty anxious because they're losing\ntheir hair and\nand what what they said is that you know\nlike they're prominent\nin like the streaming esports world\nand so they can't show up one day like\neven if they wanted to get a piece like\na wig like they couldn't\nget one right and so\ni what i suggested to them is that they\nshould just\nshow up one day with one and then in the\nmiddle of like an interview or something\njust take it off\nadjust it and then just put it right\nback on and just let the whole world\nknow that you\nwear a wig but anyway we'll see if they\never do that\num yeah i feel like owning it takes the\npower out of it and nobody's committing\na crime by losing a little bit of hair\nas well i think that streaming is about\nbeing relatable and\nbeing company to people who feel a bit\nalone and there are probably plenty of\npeople who watch that person who are\nalso losing their hair\nso i don't think it's gonna work against\nthem and i don't know why they'd be so\nafraid\nyeah so i mean it's a good question\nright why are people afraid\nand if we think about it so if we\nwell this is gonna get yeah let me know\nif this\nmoves too fast for you okay anita it's\nfine go for it\nso i mean i'm a little bit curious so\nespecially being a woman i can imagine\nit can feel\nvery distressing if you're\nlosing your hair\nah there's always wigs i'll be okay um\nbut the thing is like i know chat\nlatches on to you absolutely anything\num so it's not really something i want\npeople to get distracted by\nand that's really my own concern with it\ni don't have a partner i don't have\nanyone around me i'm alone like 99 of my\nmy day\nso it's not like anyone's going to\nbother and i don't really look in the\nmirror much so it's not something that\nreally scares me\num so for now i just try to make sure\npeople don't get distracted by it so\nthat\nwe can focus on the content really\nrather than my body because people try\nto focus on my body a lot during\nstreaming\npeople take clips of my ass and stuff so\nlike i\njust try to keep people's attention on\nthe on the topic rather than me\num and that's the only reason why i take\nany measures to really hide it\ninteresting um yeah i think you do a\nreally good job of like owning things\nand making them\nmore acceptable to people who are\nashamed about them\nuh i think that's actually one of the\nreally awesome things that you bring to\ntwitch\ninto this community i'm curious what\ndoes it feel like to have people\nkind of be focusing on your body and\ntaking clips of your ass and things like\nthat\ni've experienced it my whole life my\nwhole life has basically been a struggle\nto make friends with people who were\njust trying to depth test me\nand like seeing dying friendships\nbecause\ni see more and more signs that someone's\ninto me and i try to show signs that i'm\nnot interested back and they don't see\nthem because they have a bias because\nthey want something for me\nand so chat is just making is just\nanother way that i relive that exact\nsame struggle where i'm trying to hold a\nconversation about everything else and\nit keeps falling back to their desire to\nget their willy wet\nand so i'm so used to navigating it that\ni just poke humor at it now and use it\nas content because i can't make it go\naway i can't control how other people\nfeel\nhow they behave so in any way if i can't\ncontrol the situation or change it for\nthe better\ni try to change its effect on me and\nothers and so the way i've been managing\nit\nis just to poke humor at it and make it\na reason for people to smile and laugh\nin various ways and that's the only\nthing i can really think to do about it\nsounds very mature um\nyou know to approach it that way i'm\nsurprised you say so\nbecause poking fun at people for being\nattracted to me doesn't sound like an\ninitially like a mature premise\nfor any kind of content but yeah i guess\ni agree with you that poking fun it\ndoesn't sound like that but that's why\nwhen we dig into actually what you're\ndoing that does sound mature to me\nright so like sort of saying hey there's\nsomething about the world that i can't\nchange and people are going to be people\nso i'm going to do my best to kind of\nfocus on what i think is important and\nsteer people in the right direction and\nif people want to\nyou know focus on something physical i\ncan kind of just poke fun at it\nand then kind of focus on what's\nimportant that sounds pretty mature to\nme\nthank you i mean i think surreptitiously\ni poke fun at it as well\nto show people who are very\ninexperienced in talking to people\nthey're attracted to that this doesn't\nwork\num i try to use like gamer-based\nanalogies to show people that\ncertain things are not okay or not fun\nand not cool\nlike pickup lines i describe them as\nwhen people think there are cheat codes\ninto women's pants that you can just say\na generic sentence\nand you'll be able to sleep with someone\nand that's not how people work because\nthey're individuals and stuff\nand that when you try to use a cheat\ncode to get in someone's pants\nyou're basically saying i'm lonely and i\nwant to [ __ ] it's not about you\nif it was about you i'd say something\nspecific to you that's to do with you\nbut i'll just say this generic thing and\nhope that your panties fall off sort of\nthing\nand these sort of descriptions help me\nto describe to people how not to hit on\npeople so that maybe one day they'll\nsuccessfully connect\num so i kind of seen it as an\nopportunity to help people figure out\nwhat doesn't work\nso that they can lean towards what does\ni need to is there\ni thought i detected a note of anger\nthere\noh yeah i mean there's a a huge\nundercurrent of frustration i want to\nconnect with people long term i want to\nhave friends i want to have\nyou know really fun interactions and\nthere's this barrage of lonely dicks\nbetween me and all the people that are\nworth hanging out with the people who\naren't trying to [ __ ] me\nit happens everywhere i go and\neverything i do like i've gone to social\nclubs and all sorts trying to make\nfriends because i was desperately lonely\nand then like two or three men will\nlatch on to me and try to talk to me\nlike interview me for a role in their\nlife i do not\n[ __ ] want and they just won't leave\nme alone i'll try to ditch them and go\nto the bathroom i'll come out there\nwaiting for me\nand whilst everyone else sees that i'm\ntalking to people they don't feel\ncomfortable talking\nto me so all the people who don't want\nto [ __ ] me don't get around to talking\nto me and i'm just stuck with these\npeople who i know\ni'm gonna disappoint and there's no\nfriendship there because\nthey're just waiting to see if i'll [ __ ]\nthem and i've tried so hard to make\nfriends with people who are attracted to\nme\nand been like oh make a good thing out\nof this and it doesn't work out because\nthey get more disappointed and\nuncomfortable\nand it becomes too painful for them to\nhang out with me so i have been lonely\nand frustrated and angry\nand trying ever since i was young i was\nisolated and alone\nand i've been trying so hard my whole\nlife to make long-term friends and these\nfriendships keep [ __ ] dying\nand i've had female friends thinking\nyou'll be fine and they've all hit on me\ntoo\nso i don't know how to escape it and i\nfeel really frustrated and alone\ni know there are people out there i'm\nnot egotistical enough to think that\nit's just that everyone wants me it's\njust that when other people who do\nare attracted to me are pushy they kind\nof barge everyone else\nout of the way they kind of they kind of\ninhibit my ability to spend time with\npeople\nwho actually have a genuine friendship\nwith no other intentions\nand i want to be worth that to someone i\ndon't want to be just something to death\ndepth test i want to be a friend i want\nto support people i want to see people\ngrow and have kids and get married i\nwant to be with people long term\nand have a great time with them and not\njust be sad all the people who come into\nmy life and get disappointed that i\ndon't have more to offer i want my\nfriendship to be a [ __ ] nuff\nbravo\nanita i think you've grown since the\nfirst time i talked to you\nreally immensely\nand what makes you say that\nso you told me some wild stories the\nfirst time we talked\ni don't know if you remember but like i\nwas really confused because you would\nsay like\nyeah people continuously fall in love\nwith me and it sounds like sort of like\na\nlike on the surface much like you know\nthe mature comment it can be\nkind of confusing but it sort of seems\nsort of narcissistic to say that right\nbut i don't think it was i think it's\ngenuinely your experience but\ni can imagine people would judge you\nthat way um\nand and you know i oh wow and\nthere's so much there so first of all\nthank you so much for being so authentic\ni i was so i i\nyou know you're a genius with words by\nthe way i don't know if you like you're\nlike a wordsmith\ni just ran it i i don't i what what did\ni say that\nyou said you said this is one of the\nbest sentences\ni've ever heard or read in my life\nthere's a barrage of dicks between me\nand\na real friendship that's such a great\nsentence\nit captures your experience so well\nfirst of all i've never heard the phrase\nbarrage of dicks\n[Laughter]\nyou know it's like it's a new\ncombination in the english language\ni think it it really does such a good\njob so i spend my days\npracticing my words i spend my days so\nif you think about human experience\nhuman experience any human experience\nthat's translated into words\nloses something right because i can't i\ncan use the word love but like\nwhat love feels like in in four letters\nl-o-v-e there's like a wide chasm\nbetween those\nyeah and what i really respect about\nwhat you just said is like\nthat chasm got really really small you\nknow when you kind of talk about how\nincredibly frustrating it is\num that you want something and that\nthere's all this crap getting in the way\num and yeah i mean i think it was just\nvery well said and i think it's an\nexperience that i imagine\ni mean i've talked to a lot of women who\ni think would resonate with that\nexperience\nthat you know they they keep on getting\nblamed for friend-zoning people\nbut they're they get girlfriend-zoned\nall the time immediately\num and so yeah i just thought it was\nwell said\nand i think the reason you've grown is\nbecause the first time\nthat i talked to you you were just\nrelentlessly positive and you still i\nmean you're still a positive person\nright like you're kind of like i can't\nchange other people so\ni'm gonna do the best that i can to make\na world a better place like that's why\nanita's awesome\nand but i almost thought that you were\ntoo positive\nbecause you didn't give space to\nyourself to feel\nnegative and to recognize that that's\nnot fair and that that's not okay and\nthat like\nyou deserve to have friends and now i\nhear you getting frustrated about it\nwhich i think is actually a step in the\nright direction i think it was\nsubsurface anger\nand now it's surface anger but that's\nhow we let things out\nand and now it's interesting because i i\ni feel like\nsort of embarking on a conversation that\ni very rarely do\nwhich is to change other people so\nusually we talk about you\nbut i i wonder if there are some things\nthat you could do or we could explore\nlet me just think about how to say this\nbecause i get the sense that you do have\nthis like\nmoth drawn to a flame kind of thing\ngoing\nright so you've mentioned to me that\nthere are many people like even female\nfriends of yours that you'll feel close\nto\nwho sort of wind up kind of falling for\nyou in a romantic way\nand so there's something that tells me\nthat something about what other people\nsee in you makes them think romance\ninstead of friendship so\nuh in response i've got two responses to\nthat i hope i remember them both the\nfirst\nis that um i used to go down a very self\nblaming route with it a long time ago\nin my early teens because i used to just\nwalk in the street and\nguys would panhandle for sex they come\nup to me like hey baby where you headed\ncan i go with you do you know local pub\ndo you want to come with me\nwhere'd you live what's your name all\nthese personal details i didn't want to\ngive to a stranger\num usually an older stranger and i was\nlike this must be something to do with\nme i attract these horrible people that\ni don't want to interrupt my day\num i i kind of i want to so i got\nchanged i wore this massive\ntrench coat thinking everyone like when\npeople look at people who've been\nsexually assaulted they go well what\nwere you wearing and as a kid i thought\nthat meant that if you just wore\nspecific clothes\nno one would bother you sexually um and\ni got the wrong idea from those\nquestions that i saw people asking\nanyone who suffered sexual assault so i\nwas like fine i wear a trench coat\npeople leave me alone nobody can see my\nbody there'd be no reason to hit on me\nand i was wrong and people still hit on\nme i tried so many different approaches\ni tried being rude to people and distant\nand people still chased me i tried to be\nfriendly and warm and people still\nchased me i tried everything and every\napproach i could think of i i\nput people down harshly i was like i\nwill never [ __ ] you in a million years\nand that didn't work and i would have i\nhospitalized\nboys at school and for being too pushy\nand aggressive\nand they'd come out of hospital and ask\nme out straight away with their cast on\nlike i just couldn't find an approach\nand i was soft and gentle and they just\nwouldn't get the message\nand so like i stopped blaming myself a\nlong time ago for people not paying\nattention\nbecause i wasn't flirting i wasn't you\nknow i don't flirt with these people i\npay attention to it and i'm like why are\nyou getting me signals and why\nwhen i when i avoid you because you're\nhitting on me do you not get these\nsignals like i can avoid people and like\ndoes she love me i'm like how\nthinking like this still every time you\nhit on me i go silent and walk away and\nyou're like\ni don't know what she wants women are\njust a mystery\ni've even said like no just no just not\never and they're like\nis she playing hard to get what do why\ndon't they just say when they want me i\ndon't\nunderstand women are a mystery and i\njust can't [ __ ] find\nthe right thing to say to someone that's\nbeside with you because they're so\npreoccupied with what they want and\nthey're thinking with little brain\nso they don't hear sense and so i\ni i've asked myself my whole life this\nquestion\nand as well people think i'm conceited\nif i ever bring it up so i can't ask\npeople for advice\nso it's like a problem that's making me\nreally lonely and desperate for\nreal friendship it's making me really\nreally struggle to trust people\nbecause people say they're not attracted\nto me and then spring out on me and then\nbreak up as a friend\nthe minute they realize it's not going\nto be anything more like i have so many\nissues surrounding this i want a\nfulfilling life and a fulfilling social\ngroup\nand it's destroying it even when i do\nfind long-term friends\nwho like say they're not into me and\nnever hit on me at all right\nthe minute i have more friends they get\njealous\nand angry and it starts to show or like\num i'll have friends around me that are\nnice\nand aren't hitting on me and people\naround me will assume that we're\ntogether\nand start socially assassinating them\nand trying to break up that friendship\nand a lot of the times it even [ __ ]\nworks\nlike there are so many situations where\neven if i if\neven if there's no romance at all\npeople's romances [ __ ] it up\nand people's attraction to me [ __ ] it\nup and there are people in chat right\nnow saying i think she's\nmaking a big thing about being\nattractive i don't feel attractive i\ndon't understand this at all and it\nannoys the hell out of me i'm not\nboasting\nthis suck this really [ __ ] sucks\nand i'm sick of it i don't want to have\nto politely navigate people's intentions\nand constantly disappoint people i don't\nwant to feel like a disappointment\nanymore i don't want to feel like my\nfriendship is a [ __ ] consolation\nprize\ni want people to just be happy with it\nand like if i have to acknowledge that\npeople are attracted to me in order to\nfind the route to do so\nlet me do that because i'm not making it\nup and i'm not boasting about it and\nit's not a [ __ ] compliment that\npeople don't want to spend time with me\nunless i [ __ ] them\nthat's the opposite of a compliment why\ndo people think i'd be proud of that\nthat is the\nultimate insult\ni'm gonna think for a second if that's\nokay\nokay i didn't get to my second point but\ni think that's enough\nno let's hear your second point um\nthis what was this i had it in my brain\njust for a second it's gone out the\nwindow what was it\num firstly it's not a compliment and\npeople think i'm conceited and\nall that stuff stuff but secondly um\ni'm not oh manipulation i'm not trying\nto fix anyone\num i've i'm done trying to be\nresponsible for other\npeople's lack of growth i'm not going to\ntry and convince people to value me\nbeyond sleeping with me if they can't\nsee past that that's their problem i'm\nexhausted i used to spend so much of my\nyouth\nsupposedly being so mature for my age\nand people\nwho have problems gravitating towards me\nincluding partners\nand they put me in charge of their\npersonal growth and they also blamed me\nwhenever they could struggle to be good\nand they were like well if you were more\nsupportive or if you were more confident\nin the bedroom maybe i wouldn't have\nand all this sort of stuff and the\nminute you start rushing in to help\npeople build on themselves in situations\nwhere they're just\nshallow [ __ ] you end up struggling\nand crying and being hurt with them\ntaking responsibility for their [ __ ]\nlike i'm so done with that i'm a\ngrown-up i hang out with grown-ups if\nthey can't grow and be mature and think\npast their woolies that's their problem\ngonna find people who can think past\ntheir willies\ni'm not going to try and change people\nnot in this respect and\nto be honest the times that i've changed\npeople the most are when i've never\ntried to change them at all\njust by being happy and being myself\npeople see solutions that they've not\ntried before\nfrom the way that i exist and i'm far\nmore happy with that way of helping\npeople\nthan actively trying to meddle with\ntheir minds and their lives\nmost often change doesn't really happen\nunless people want it to\nso it has to be their idea in the first\nplace and honestly\ni'm just so done playing therapist i was\nnice to help people grow\ni've definitely helped people in the\npast and really enjoyed it\nbut i'm exhausted now i've spent my\nwhole life caring for my mom and caring\nfor other people and i just want to\nwork on myself and be around people who\ndon't need work from me that just happy\nyou have come a long way anita really\nhappy\nseriously i'm really i'm thrilled to\nbecause seriously like the first time i\ntalked to you it was like\nother people need to come first like you\ncould go back and watch it\nit's like other people need to come\nfirst and anita gets\nno space in anita's life\nand then what i'm hearing you say is i\ndon't exist for you\nanymore i'm done existing for you\ni'm done being what you want me to be\ni'm gonna start existing for myself\nand there's a lot of hurt around that\ntoo because it seems like\nwhen you exist for yourself people don't\nlike it\nbecause they like you to exist for them\ni need to change me\ni need to [ __ ] me i need to do this for\nme take care of me help me\nanita be the case for me to fix\nbe broken so that i can feel better\nabout myself and make you feel better\nabout yourself\nand then [ __ ] me afterwards\nright yeah\nand it's not fair and i i hear you you\nsay you've tried it all\nbecause early on people treated you a\ncertain way and you're like oh crap i'm\nbeing treated\nbecause of what i'm wearing or who i am\nor how i am acting\nand so you started wearing a trench coat\nand you changed yourself for the sake of\nother people\ntheir immature behavior suddenly became\nyour\nresponsibility to fix on your end that\npeople are acting\nthis way towards you because of what you\nwear and you're like [ __ ] that i'm done\nwith that i'm not responsible\nfor their reactions to me which is fair\nso you tried to change yourself for the\nsake of other people and you were like\n[ __ ] that\nand then what happened is\nyou tried the other extreme which is\nthat you said i'm i'm gonna stop so at\nfirst you were like i'm gonna transform\nmyself i'm gonna wear a\ntrench coat and a hat and glasses and\nthen\ni'm gonna change myself so that people\ndon't interact with me a particular way\ni'm gonna stop being who i am because\nwhen i am who i am\nbarrage of dicks then what happens is\nyou\nyou went the other extreme and you said\ni'm not going to try to change\nother people anymore because you tried\nthat for a while too right you tried to\nrehabilitate people you tried to\ntransform people you try\nto change people so then it's not about\nchanging yourself it's all about\nchanging\nthe other person help them learn a\ndifferent way\ntry to teach them that you are more than\nan object for their lust\ntry to teach them be compassionate be\nmature be patient\nand try to change them and you're like\n[ __ ] that that doesn't work either\ntried to change yourself didn't work\ntried to change them\ndidn't work and now you're here\nand you're frustrated because you've\ntried it all and you're smart\nright so like when you say you've tried\nit all i believe you and i think you\nalso probably came up with\npretty creative solutions\nyou know i don't know how many\nadolescent girls i've ever seen\nin trench coats but that you know just\nshows us that you were probably thinking\noutside the box maybe it was cottman\nwhere you were\ni don't think i've ever seen like a\nteenage girl in a trench coat\nyeah i i was pretty much the only one\nright so you you did a lot of outside of\nthe box thinking\nyou're pretty smart and you've tried\neverything under the sun\nand you're frustrated and absolutely so\nbecause for a while you didn't put\nyourself forward first and now you're\ntrying to put yourself first\nand it's and you gotta let me know if i\nsay this too much okay because i just\nlove the phrase now\nit's a barrage of dicks\nright and so now it's kind of like okay\nso like what do we do about this\nlike what do we do for you anita how can\nwe help you\nfind friendships i think part of is\nboundaries because\ni i don't\nso a lot of the people around me are\npeople who are trying to get in a\nrelationship with me and it's a pattern\nthey'll hit on me a little bit hit on me\na little bit and i'll go that's really\nsweet of you to be so nice\num and that i'll try so hard to be\naccepting but at the same time there's a\nnew thing\nas he am i allowed to acknowledge that\nthis feels like he's hating on me am i\nallowed to\nis that thing i can do because it feels\nconceited to jump to conclusions\nso i give them the benefit of the doubt\nand go maybe this person is just being\nnice\nmaybe i can still hold hope that people\ncan just be nice for the sake of it but\nthere's a pattern and i'm already\nrecognizing it and people are commenting\non it and going i think this person\nlikes you i think this person likes you\nand just like uh i don't wanna i don't\nwanna face it i don't wanna\nbecause if if this is real if this is\nwhat's happening then i'm going to lose\na friend\nand it doesn't matter what situation no\nmatter what angle i take it from\ni'm going to lose a friend and then ah\num\nit gets to the point where i have to\nhave the discussion thank you for all\nthese things but i just want you to know\nand don't take this personally\num a lot of people do this and it's\nbecause they're interested in me and\nin case you're interested in me i'm not\nlooking for a relationship right now i\ndon't i don't make it impersonal i'm\njust like i'm not looking to date anyone\ni'm not interested in anyone right now\nrather than directing it directly at\nthem i'm not going to like these are all\nthe reasons i'd never [ __ ] you because\nthat's really mean and unnecessary\num and usually the response is oh i\ndidn't like you anyway it's not like\nthat i'm just being nice to you okay\nand then from there they carry on doing\nit\nand the most common pattern i get is\npeople pretending they're not hitting on\nme until it hits\nuntil it sticks they're like um no means\nno until it means yes\nit's how people take that they still\nhold out hope unless i crush them and\neven if i crush them sometimes they hold\nout hope\nand so i'm in this horrible position\nwhere it's not appropriate\nto be cruel or direct anyway it's not\nlike i could just explode and go\nyou gave me some stuff and i just want\nyou to know i'd never [ __ ] you in a\nmillion years it's not okay to do that\nbut the gentle approach doesn't work and\nit's really frustrating i'm trapped and\nthey keep pushing and pushing and doing\nall the stuff i know\nis love bombing and i don't know how to\nsay stop and it doesn't stop and i just\nend up\nreally unhappy and uncomfortable all the\ntime it's happened to me with roommates\nit's happened to me with friends it's\nhappened to me\nso many people and they push and push\nand they want to take more and more they\nwant to take more of my time and they\nguilt trip me if i don't spend time with\nthem if i don't play games with them\nthey're pushing and like they they want\nto talk all the time they know i'm busy\nthey get angry at me if i don't message\nback and tell them about my day\nlike they start to want more and more\nand more and it makes me more and more\nuncomfortable\nand i pull back more and more and more\nbecause everyone around me knows\ni'm busy i struggle to keep up with\nmessages and even these people who hit\non me know this\nbut they still pressure me and it really\nit's such a struggle because i don't\nwant to hurt their feelings and i enjoy\ntheir friendship and i don't want to\nhave to push them away\nbut they're pulling pulling pulling so\nmuch that the only thing i have left to\ndo is push\nand so this friendship starts to get\nruined in increments i start to dislike\nspending time with them and feel\nuncomfortable\nand i feel guilty about it and like i\ncan't say anything because they're being\nnice to me\nand then eventually i have to let them\ndown and the first time i let them down\nthey won't accept it ever nobody ever\ndoes\nno matter how i approach it whether i'm\ndirect or soft they don't\nacknowledge i've said no and they keep\npushing and pushing after\nand they start doing weird [ __ ] this is\nwhere the weird territory starts to\nhappen like waiting for me to be really\ndrunk to try and kiss me\nand things like this you know all this\nstuff that gets dodgy\nand this is where things really bad\nthings have started to happen to me as\nwell from people who just\ndon't take no for an answer and the\nproblem with that is that they're\nusually really nice people\nusually they're people no one would ever\nsuspect of being weird and creepy\nbut it gets like that and i feel like\nit's my\nfault for not just deleting them from my\nlife sooner\nand i should have done it earlier and\nearlier and early i knew they were\nhitting on me i knew they weren't\nlistening to me\nand it happened so [ __ ] much and it\nhappens with nice guys that everybody\nlikes that are deep in my friendship\ngroups and people i don't feel like i\ncan challenge\nand it's so hard and awkward and risky\nand terrifying\nand i've had like so much happen to me\num\nbecause i just don't know how to\nnavigate this and set boundaries and i\nwant\nfriends as well i keep holding out hope\nthat maybe they'll just give up\nand they'll accept my friendship and\nthey never [ __ ] do\nso the worst case scenario is sexual\nassault but the best case scenario is\nthe friendship\ndies because they're disappointed and it\nhurts too much to hang out with me\nand there is no middle ground and there\nis nothing fun about this and i keep\ngetting my heart broken by people that i\ntry to connect with\nover and over again\nthat sounds terrible\nit's hard it's awkward it's risky\nit's terrifying\ni get the sense\noh it's like sort of like this history\nrepeating itself this like inevitability\ni kind of imagine that like you see you\nknow a bright\nlike a little spot in the distance and\nit's like\nthe the light of a train and no matter\nwhat you do inevitably that light grows\nand grows and grows and grows and grows\nuntil that train is like\nbearing down on you and that there's\nthere's a lot of just\nthere's a lot of like just fate\nin what you're saying that like no\nmatter what you do whether you change\nyourself whether you change people\nwhether you try to set boundaries and\nyou're a dick to people\nor you're nice to people like there's\njust this inevitability of like you know\nthe moon coming crashing down onto earth\nno matter what you do\nthere's an incredible gravity to what\nyou're describing\nthat's what i'm hearing from you that's\nwhat i'm feeling from you\nis that how it feels yeah but i keep\ntrying i keep holding out hope and i\nthink that's what's got me into so many\nbad situations is that\ni keep holding out hope that maybe i'm\njust paranoid or maybe i'm just you know\nlike and then i let it continue for way\ntoo long because i'm either\ntelling myself it's not okay to\nacknowledge it's happening i shouldn't\nbe so full of myself not everyone\nfancies you anita\num or like i try to push them away and\nit doesn't work\nyeah that's what i was about to say it's\nlike it seems like you're damned if you\ndo damned if you don't\nit's like either you're mean to them and\nthen it ruptures the friendship or\nyou're kind to them and they start\npushing boundaries and wait until you're\ndrunk\nso anita i have two options for you okay\ni'd love to try to help you with this\ni do think that you can be helped by the\nway um\nand and oddly enough the reason that i\nhave hope is because there's a pattern\nso in my experience where there's a\npattern there's room for understanding\nand once there's understanding then you\ncan change\nwe certainly see a pattern here um\nso let me start by this i've got two\noptions for you\none is the smart option it's the logical\noption\nthe other is the shot in the dark it's\nthe thing that's more likely to be wrong\nbut may actually be potentially helpful\nbut the chances of that are\nvery low you want to go for the shot in\nthe dark\nor the more reliable thing\nlet's just talk about both because for\nme i've tried so many options and failed\nthat you know\nwhich one first that's right\ni'm curious about the shot in the dark\nokay so there's a lot of negative space\nin this conversation\nokay and what i mean by negative space\nis you're talking a lot about one thing\nand what we're what i'm i'm hearing a\nconspicuous absence that actually once\ni mention it hopefully this makes sense\nto people and i don't really know that\nthis is where the money is in fact\nyou're pointing really really hard in\none direction\nwith where your problem is and what you\nwant and what i'm noticing is that the\nharder you drive in one direction the\nmore you're moving away from something\nelse\nthat seems like the very opposite of\nwhere the answer is\nso that is this do you want a romantic\nrelationship\ni don't know\ni don't know i mean i've been on the odd\ndate here and there\nthat's not worked out um\nso i think there is a part of me that\nwants to but\ni'm also really really really happy on\nmy own and i do\nso much better in life on my own i'm\nmuch happier on my own\nand so um you know it feels like\ni'm content where i'm at but if the\nright person comes along i'm happy to\nyou know bring someone into my life um\nbut unfortunately a lot of the people\nthat are attracted to me are not very\nhealthy or good for me like a lot of\nthese people uh graphic i\ntend to a lot of people who are very\num dark in their behavior\ntend to gravitate towards me and so\nyeah i've been on a few dates they\ndidn't work out and\nthat's about as far as it's gone i've\nbeen i've been alone for quite a while\nnow\nokay so i'm gonna repeat back\nyour answer as i heard it\nand i want you to tell me whether you\nanswered the question so i asked you do\nyou want a relationship\nand you started off by saying i've been\non a few dates\nit tends to not work out well\ni'm somewhat content and if the right\nperson comes along\ni'd think about it but generally\nspeaking\nthe wrong person comes along did you\nanswer my question\nyeah i think i don't know if the right\nperson comes along then sure\nis is is an answer i'd say that's the\nclosest thing to the answer\nright so i think it's interesting\nbecause you said i don't know and then\nyou kind of talked about your\nexperiences\nand i wonder where there's whether\nthere's value so like i'm just going to\nask you the question again\ndo you want a relationship\nno i don't think i do why not\ni think if you'd asked me this question\nlike a month or two ago i\nsaid yeah i want a relationship because\ni was trying\neven and i i think i've settled into a\nmentality very recently where i'm just\nlike\nthis is actually pretty awesome like\nah i'm noticing more and more that i'm\nmaking\nroom for myself to read to learn\nto do stuff for my stream to spend time\nwith animals and you know really\ngrow and do all the stuff i've wanted to\ndo and made excuses not to\nand i feel like i'm discovering what i'm\ncapable of\nall over again i did that when i started\ndoing animal rescue work and it was\nreally dangerous and scary and i\npushed through a lot of fear and did a\nlot of stuff that made me feel great i\nwas like wow i'm capable of a lot more\nthan i thought and\ni feel like being alone especially\nin lockdown and not really seeing anyone\ni've really\nenjoyed it just just having some space\nand time to\nactually attend to stuff my own needs\nfor once\nand not think about pleasing anyone and\nyou know all this messy stuff with\nboundaries and people hitting on me i've\nenjoyed the respite\nfrom it and i don't i don't think i need\nanyone in my life right now\nand i think it'd be bad to ha\ni feel like if you have holes and you're\nlonely if you should fill it with your\nown [ __ ] i don't think that you should\nget with someone because you have needs\ni think you should get with someone\nbecause\nyou're happy and you have some extra\ntime and love to give someone\navailable um rather than it just being\nlike i need someone because i'm bored\ni'm scared i'm alone i need someone to\nlove me because i don't love my\nmyself i think i'm in a good position to\nhave a partner but because i'm in a good\nposition to have a partner\ni don't actually need one\num once again a lot of wisdom\nanita a lot of wisdom coming from you\ntoday\nthanks that no i i don't think i want a\nrelationship and\nand yeah i'm perfectly happy living my\nown life\nokay i'm gonna\njust think about what you said for a\nsecond if that's okay\nso here's what i'd say so i think that i\nlove your answer\nright so you're you're learning to be\nwith yourself\nyou've prioritized other people over you\nwhether they be your mom\nthe animals that you take care of your\nbunny your gigantic bunny you have a\ngigantic bunny still\nyeah he's been compared to me\n[Laughter]\num you know the random friends that you\nknow lean on you for support and stuff\nyou're learning how to be with yourself\ni do think it's very\nlike it's like one of these profound you\nknow\num statements where you're kind of like\ni don't need someone and that's why in a\nsense\nmaybe i'm ready because i i can be with\nmyself\nyeah i think that there's a lot of merit\nthere i i wonder\non some level whether there's something\nunder the surface there too\ni think it's maybe not worth digging\ninto but there\nthere's still i'm getting an\nundercurrent of like something left\nunderneath there i don't think we need\nto get into it but i'm curious whether\nyou know if we end up talking again like\na couple months from now or things like\nthat or if you actually do wind up\nactually i think this becomes relevant\nif you wind up in a relationship\nthat you want maybe there are other\nfeeling i'm just getting the sense that\nthere are some feelings there that are\nleft unaddressed\num and it sort of makes sense and i'm\ni'm glad that we could move you from an\ni don't know to a no\nbecause i think it's important to kind\nof like map that out\nbecause the implication of everything\nyou've been saying is that you don't\nwant a romantic relationship right\nyou're saying like\ni want friendships i want people who\nwant me for me i actually don't want to\nlike you've been saying this whole time\ni don't want a\nromantic relationship which is why it\nsounds kind of weird that like maybe i\njust went out there and asked the\nquestion but just to confirm like let's\nbe clear\nthat you don't want one\nand then the reason why not is that that\nyou're basically working on yourself for\nnow\nand you're learning to prioritize the\nthings that you've neglected\nin the pursuit of taking care of other\npeople anita is taking some much needed\nme time\nright and that's fantastic i can support\nthat\nany questions about that or do you want\nto talk further about this or should we\nswitch gears\nto the more important part\nthat's good what's the more important\npart so here's the thing anita\nlet's let's just assume for a second\nthat everything that you said\nis exactly as you said it okay that you\nare someone who\nseems to attract men\nand women and they sort of continuously\nfall for you\nand want everything from sex to\nlove in a deep meaningful soulful\nrelationship\nso the first question is are you is that\ndifferent from most people's experiences\nyes or no what do you think\nit's not very different from my mom's\nexperiences my mom gets this a lot too\nand i've watched her struggle with it\nher whole life from a young age\nguys used to bump heads trying to kiss\nher hand at the same time and\nthey get so distracted by her they'd get\ncaught in the bus doors and be dragged\nby buses and things like\nuh there were always women who were\ntrying to tear her down and socially\nsabotage her because\nthey're jealous that their boyfriend\nfancied her and things like this my\nmom's always had people\nstalk her and things like this she had\nlike a herd of stalkers one of them\ncarved her a wooden dildo\nwe now use it as a self-def defense\nstick if in case of emergency which is\nhilarious\num but there have been yeah my mom's the\nonly person i know in my life\ncues like this to you but me and her\ntemperament and the way we engage with\npeople is so different my mom is very\nblunt\nvery noble [ __ ] and after everything\nshe's gone through\ni don't blame her like i'm a lot more\ngentle with people\num like my mom i confide in her about it\ni'm like what do i do and she gives me\nreally good\nadvice sometimes because she's\nexperienced so much of it but at the\nsame time she's like\ni would make this recommendation but\nyou're too much of a nice person\nlike sometimes she's like i the way that\ni'd approach this\nyou wouldn't do and so i often end up\nfeeling stuck in situations because i\nknow that her\napproach is a lot more let's say direct\nand angry sometimes um\nyeah just kind of d i'm gonna restate my\nquestion and i'm going to repeat the\nanswer that i heard\nis it is it a normal experience or\nabnormal experience to have\npeople continuously want you\nfall in love with you etc and you said\nwell it seems similar to my mom's\nexperience\nright and then you went on to point out\nsome differences between your mom fine\nso fine so that you and your mom share\nan experience cool that's actually a\nreally important data point that we'll\nvisit in a second\nis it a normal or abnormal experience\ncompared to other people\nuh i mostly hang out with dudes and i\ndon't know any of them who go through\nthis except one i know one dude who goes\nthrough this\nso most of the people i know don't go\nthrough this okay so\ni would say that you know if you talk to\nwomen on the internet\nmany of them will say that some of this\nbehavior is common\num and and so we've had streams about\nthat but\ni also have never met anyone\nwho has been unable to find friends or\nhave\ntheir friendships including their female\nfriendships continuously wrecked by\nwhatever this is\nso in this sense i think you're an\noutlier right so we're going to approach\nthis scientifically\nand we're going to start by forget about\npsychology and all that kind of crap and\nlike\ndo you want a relationship oh my god\nwhat's going on inside you do you put\nyourself first you put yourself second\nlike forget about all that\nlet's look at it and look at it\nscientifically so first thing is like\nis this are you an outlier right and\nwhat would you say yes or no\ni'm actually unsure i i would want a\nlarger sample of\nof women's experiences before i could\nsay\nokay because i know it's uncommon among\nmen and they're the people that i mostly\nhang out with i have some female friends\nthroughout the past but\nmost of them i lost to this situation as\nwell\nthat i'm in so let me ask you this or\nis it a common experience for human\nbeings to be unable to make friends\nyes not just not for this reason it's\nhard for early adults to make friends\nbut for this reason probably it's\nunusual maybe\ni don't know i am actually genuinely\nunsure that's totally fine so so\ni'd say you're an outlier\nso the word like so anita you're a siren\nyou know what a siren is guys remember\nthis [ __ ]\ni do yeah right so what's your\nunderstanding of what a siren is or what\nwhat do you\nshe sits on the rocks and she sings\nbeautiful songs and men\nyou know see men get enchanted and they\ncrash their ships\non the rocks sound like you\ni think the difference between me and a\nsiren is intent\nabsolutely completely agree but like\nlike\nwhen i see you and i hear your your\nstory\nit sounds to me like a siren right like\nthere's like something weird\nyou have some musk or there's something\ngoing on with you\nwhere like people are drawn to you and\nthey start out as like\nyou're you've tried everything in in the\nbooks right so like let's think about it\nscientifically you've tried to be an\n[ __ ]\nyou've tried to be nice you've tried to\nset boundaries you've tried to\nyou know be very clear with people and\nsay i'm not interested in this\nyou've tried to just be friends you've\ntried to fix people\nyou've tried to change yourself and none\nof it's working which tells me that\nthere's some kind of siren song\nso then we say like okay so if none of\nthat stuff is working then like why are\nthese people drawn to you\nbecause what i'm hearing is that people\nare drawn to you it's not even like\nsomething you're doing\nright if you think about a siren song\nsure there's intent and they want to\ncrash\nand so maybe not a great example but\nwhat i'm noticing is like the word\nit's not that you're doing something\nyou're not luring them\nthey are drawn to you\ndoes that make sense like i'm just\nobserving this based on what you're\nsaying\n[Music]\nand i think there's an inhibiting factor\nof like\ni don't see myself the way that these\npeople do and it's difficult to try and\nunderstand it\nbecause i don't feel particularly\nattractive or interesting i don't feel\nlike i'm the kind of person that's worth\nmaking this much fuss about\nlike in my situation if i fell for\nsomeone\nand they didn't reciprocate they they\ndidn't want to be with me\nand they were saying no a lot i wouldn't\nkeep trying i wouldn't go man you're\nmaking noises as if you have a choice\nbut you'll like me eventually i can\nearn it like yours your attention can be\na reward if i'm just\nepic enough you know and i just i just i\nwouldn't think like that if i have to\ntry to get someone to like me i'll move\non to someone who actually likes me\neffortlessly\ni don't understand why people think that\nit's worth being degraded and pushed\naway\nand just being rejected over and over\nfor me\ni'm not neurotypical i'm a pain in the\nass like most of my friends have to\nenjoy the odd slap\nor a smack or like punch or whatever\nbecause of my tics\nand you know they're very patient and\ntolerant and i can't see how\nhaving to tolerate someone who's not\nallowed and brash and annoying and\nembarrassing to be around like\nthe kind of ticks i have like we'll be\nplaying chess in a calf\nand stuff and i'll be like do you like\ndick and before they've even answered\ni'll be like he likes dick\nand just shouting to everyone else in\nthe in the room like people have to be\nso patient with me\nand i can't see any reason why this\nhappens and it feels wrong to ask and go\nwhy do you like me why are you willing\nto go through all this\nwhy are you willing to put up with all\nof this why is it worth putting up with\nthe rejection\nme not liking you why is it worth\nputting up with my condition\nand i'm i feel like a very bland and\nmediocre woman do you know how many\nbrunettes with brown eyes like small\nyou know there's no i'm a very average\nlooking person here in the uk\nit doesn't it doesn't feel like i the\nway that people are\nnothing that makes sense to me nothing\nthat feels usable\nor changeable what's their answer\nthe most common one is that there isn't\nanyone like me\nwhat do you think about that\nthat literal [ __ ] one what do i do\nwith that\neveryone's unique it's the most generic\naspect of any living being ever we all\nhave unique experiences we all have\nunique personalities\nwe're all individuals i literally can't\ndo anything about\nthat\n[Laughter]\nit doesn't help me at all\nhow does it make so sure you can't do\nanything about it\nhow does it make you feel\ndefeated why\nwhat's defeated because if they could\ngive me an\nanswer that i could use to change the\ndirection this\nthe shipwreck if we're gonna go with the\nsiren analogy okay it's actually a good\none right because it ends up as a\nshipwreck\nyeah and it's like i'm not singing\nbecause i want the seamen to come and\ncrash\non the rocks i'm singing because i'm\nalone and i want to enjoy something and\nhave fun and be myself i'm singing\nbecause i like the song\nnot because i like them they're the ones\nthrowing themselves at me\nand the only other option is to sit\nthere silently\nalone and not be myself which would make\nme miserable\nand so i i kind of feel like i want to\nsing my song i want to be myself i just\ndon't want it to be\na shipwreck for everyone around me and\nnone of the answers i'm getting are\nhelping me avoid it\ni'm gonna need to think about that is\nthat cool\nsomeone just said wait till you're in\nyour 30s i am in my 30s\n[Laughter]\nowned\n[Laughter]\npeople always like oh it must be so hard\npeople liking you all the time boo hoo\nand no one empathizes with me\nbut the thing is as well i had this\nillusion that it was all going to end\nit's kind of tragic how as well\nbecause when i was like 9 or 10 like i\nwould go to like\nparties and stuff and like people's\npeople who were had wives in the next\nroom\nwere hitting on me in their 40s and i\nthought and this and it was creepy and\nuncomfortable and what i learned from it\nwas\noh there are a lot of dudes who crave\nyoung people\nlike when i'm a young teenager when i've\njust hit puberty and stuff this is gonna\nbe a problem\nbut when i'm a grown-up people won't\neven like me even if i get a husband\nthey won't even like me and i'll be free\nand i watch this go on and on and on for\nmy mom she's now 50\nand it's still the same problem and i'm\nlosing hope because i'm 30 and i have\nmore people doing this to me than ever\nokay man there's just so much here okay\nhmm so many directions let me try to let\nme try to tie one thing up\njust something for you to think about so\nhere's what i see i see like\nas a scientist i'm making observations\nand what i see is that your\nyou and your mom seem to be sirens of\nsome sort\nright so the interesting thing is that\nthe fact that there's something going on\nhere and it's not just the way of the\nworld and there's something either that\nyou were doing\nor exuding that\ncauses people or influences people to\nreact to you in the way that they do\ni think the fact that your mom does it\nor it's happening to your mom\nmakes it more likely that there's\nsomething going on here\nright so either it's genetic or it's\nlike behavioral\nand because we internalize the\nmannerisms of our parents\nright so so like you know my kids do\nsome of the things that i do and it's\nkind of like\nit's weird because i'm kind of academic\nand then you know my kids will sometimes\nbe like academic with me\nit's kind of bizarre but like we pick\nthings up from our family\nso i think you've picked something up or\nthere's some sort of genetic pheromone\nkind of business going on\nwhere like we can sort of accept that in\na bizarre way in\nin sort of an outlier way that men and\nwomen even\nso that's the real thing right it's like\nyou can have female friends\nwho will fall in love with you and\nbecome sexually attracted to you as well\nand so there's something going on here\nso if there's a phenomenon that is an\noutlier\nit's my experience as both both a\nscientist and a clinician\nthat there's a pattern there there's\nlike some kind of like order to that\nand if we try to look at it we may find\nsomething\nwith me so\nand i'm going to toss out one thing\nwhich maybe i've talked to you about\nbefore but i think\none potential hypothesis because i've\nseen this in women before\nso i worked with a few women who are you\nknow\nthe men just seem to be like\ndrawn to them like moths to a flame\nand what i tend to find actually is that\nsome of these women i think\nyou know this is going to sound kind of\nweird but i'm going to use some\nterminology from like\nthe system of like yoga and the hindu\ntradition\nbecause i think it captures\nit's a way of describing the world that\ni think we don't really have good words\nor concepts in the west\nso in in the tradition of yoga or more\nspecifically\ntantra tantra they sort of\ntalk about a feminine energy and so that\nlike if you think about the capacity\nto create life like comes from women it\ndoesn't come from men\nso the male contribution is generally\nspeaking minimal\nand that like if you really think about\nlike you know\ncreating a new organism is primarily\nsomething that women do\nmen don't do and so they sort of\nequate this to like this kind of\nfeminine energy\nwhich is also like sort of maternal in\nnature and if we kind of think about\nlike\nanthropology and sort of the idea of\nlike maternal figure ads\nlike figures and sort of like feminine\nenergy like maternal energy\nwe can even think about it like you know\nwe call earth a mother\nright so it's like mother earth and so\nlike that which gives life and that\nwhich sustains us you can kind of look\nat it\nin a literary fashion you can look at it\nsort of in an energetic fashion which is\nkind of how the east looks at it my\nsense is that you have an\nenergy right because it's weird it's\nlike it's not just in your behaviors\nit's not\nif we look at it scientifically we can\nsay it's not the way you look because\nyou look\naverage it's not what you wear because\nyou've changed that so you've adjusted\nall of these variables and despite\nany of those variables being adjusted it\nmakes no difference\ntherefore those variables are not those\nare independent\nof whatever this thing is and the best\nthe best words i can give you is that\nyou've got a particular energy\nand i've seen this before because\nsometimes what happens is like you're\njust this authentic person\nand that's the answer that you get when\nyou ask people why are you in love with\nme and they say\nyou're just you right so there's\nsomething incredibly pure\nabout like what you give off to other\npeople\nand so i think that that frankly a lot\nof men are are so\nstarved for authenticity\nand acceptance and like you accept them\nas a pure friend\nright like you don't think about them in\nloss\nin terms of lust you don't think about\nthem in terms of rejecting them for\nbeing a romantic partner or accepting\nthem for a romantic partner\nyou treat them for who they are and you\nwant just a pure friendship\nwith nothing else on the line and that\nkind of like\nauthenticity and almost like maternal\nacceptance\nright it's almost like you're like a mom\nwho's like you just be you and i'll\naccept you for who you are\nall of your flaws i've tried to fix\npeople and that [ __ ] doesn't work\nso i'm not gonna do that anymore i'm\njust gonna take you for who you are and\nwe can hang out from time to time\ni won't judge you i won't fall in love\nwith you i won't expect you to buy me\ndinner\ni won't do any of that i'm just going to\nbe me and you're just going to be you\nand it's going to be cool and we're\ngoing to hang out we're going to have a\ngood time\nand there's something incredibly\nrefreshing about that because that's not\nthe world we live in\nright the world that we live in is one\nof judgment\nand you're not good enough and i want\nyou to be this and i should be more of\nthis and i should be less of this\nsocial media i should be taller i should\nmake more money i'm on tinder and i'm\nfive eight and they're all these\nprofiles that say if you're under six\nfeet no need to apply\nand along comes anita\nand anita accepts me for who i am\nand then this is kind of unfortunate for\nyou but then what happens is like these\ndudes get confused\nand what i mean by that is that like uh\nmy gender often times doesn't\nunderstand what we feel and we've\nactually been\nconditioned to like equate some things\nlike\npure acceptance with a romantic\nrelationship\nbecause yeah i i agree with you but i\nfound a different path to the same\nconclusion\na while back you see for me i don't\nreally believe in femininity and\nmasculinity i think that if we deny that\num men are nurturing and caring then why\ndo we let them be fathers like i think\npaternity is a thing i think that\nthe differences between the male and\nfemale brain are usually socially\nconditioned because\nwe live in a society that benefits um\nfrom financially from\ndiverting 50 of labor to an unpaid group\nand if you make um nurturing and\nexpectation\nyou get free caring for the elderly and\nyoung you get free nurses you get you\nget to pay them a lower wage yeah this\nis your job you're a woman you're\nsupposed to take care of people\nthey become the therapists and the\ncleaners and the people who just\nmaintain [ __ ] in the home\nif 50 of the workforce is an unpaid or\nlower paid group and\nparticularly all the fields that women\ndominate are on a low paid\nthen you know it benefits society i\nnoticed that pattern but then there were\nloads of studies that reinforced it if\nyou put people in a submissive\npermission position tell them they're\nnot as good or lower than\nsome sort of way they immediately adopt\nfeminine traits\nregardless of their gender so they'll\nstart grooming\ntaking care of people sucking up to\npeople it's it's a thing that people put\ninto a group of submission dude not\nspecifically a female\nthing i've read lots of studies by\nneuroscientists who are saying like the\ndifferences between the male and female\nbrain are being over represented and\nthat you know i don't think it's because\nwomen are naturally nurturing\ni think that it's because we don't tell\ndudes it's okay to feel\nfrom a young age we point them and go\nbig boys don't cry shut up\nthis is beneath you only women do this\nbut you're strong you're better you're a\nman you don't cry you don't emote and we\ndon't give dudes the\npermission or the space to explore their\nfeelings and verbalize them from a young\nage and a lot of people grow up going i\ndon't know how i feel sometimes i feel\nangry sometimes i feel lust and these\nare the two\nmost represented male emotions in media\nthey beat up their problems and they\n[ __ ] all the women and so we give\npermission to be honey and we give\npermission to be angry or in control but\nwe don't give permission to be\nvulnerable we don't give permission to\nself-assess to talk about feelings and a\nlot of people there's much more suicide\namong men\nthan women and when you listen to them\nthey're saying i didn't have room to\nspeak\ni didn't i felt like people would call\nme a [ __ ] i didn't have room to be\nvulnerable i thought i had to be a\nprotector\nand so when you put men in this position\nin their friend groups if you talk about\nyour feelings you're a [ __ ] and people\nare scared to speak up\nand from that position that's so\nsocially conditioned\nposition um when you make a friend who\nlets you talk about your feelings when\nyou make a friend who isn't vying for\ndominance when you make a friend who\ndoesn't expect you to be a man\nthey expect you to be yourself you see\nit as a form of intimacy\nand the thing is that's so different to\na female friendship because when i'm\nwith girls\nwe talk about our feelings and our\ndreams we're allowed to be vulnerable\nnobody cares nobody judges in that\nenvironment it's fine\nand so when women take that level of\nfriendship that they've grown up being\nused to\nand do that with a dude they're like\ni've never had this before this person\ncares what i have to say they're\ninvested in my feelings they don't judge\nme\nand it's a unique kind of friendship and\nto a woman this looks like friendship\ninto a dude this looks like a form of\nintimacy they've never experienced\nbefore and so it feels like a higher\nlevel of closeness than a friendship and\ni've seen this happen a thousand times\neven with other people's friendships\ni've seen that mistake and i know it i\nknow it exists\ni know that king of the hill without it\nis such a relief and that friendships\nwhere you get to be\nhave a break where you're not judged and\nyou are loved and you do have\na space to talk about who you are and\ndiscover who you are some people like i\ndidn't know who i was or i didn't know\nhow i felt about things until i met you\ngiving guys space to be themselves\nunjudged is a\nreally favorite thing of mine tell guys\nthey're beautiful compliment the way\nthey look because they don't hear it\nenough that sort of thing\nbut i make it clear from the beginning\nthat i do this with all of my friends i\ndo it to other friends in front of them\nso they know it's not floating\ni also talk about how it gets\nmisconstrued as flowing so they know\nthat this is a thing\nand they'll still overestimate the way\nthey feel around me\nand assume i feel it too even if i start\navoiding them when they try to indulge\nit\nand so look i've communicated about this\naspect i'm not gonna drop the way i'm\nfriends with people i think it's\nimportant to show people that they can\nbe supported whether no matter what\ndangly doodads they got going on in\ntheir pants\ni'm gonna treat a dude the same way i\ntreat a woman and that's fine and i'll\nlet them know it\noften gets misconstrued and if they\nstill misconstrue it that's [ __ ] on\nthem but i swear to god i make sure they\nhave all the information there and they\nstill do it\nand like i've literally told every male\nfriend ever that i have to tell guys to\nstop hitting on me\nand that if i want to be with someone\ni'll make it known first\nand i hate it when people hit on me and\nthey still do it\nokay so then let me ask you a question\nso if you make things crystal clear for\nthem\nwhat effect do you think that has\non all the societal stuff you talked\nabout\nnone i don't try to change that no no\nbut like you're saying\nthey've been conditioned right and so\nyou tell them hey\ni'm just gonna be like friends with you\nthis is something\nwe discuss things that are emotionally\nsensitive i do it with all my friends\ni'm gonna do it with you too because\nthat's who i am\nand then they discuss their emotions you\nguys become\nan intimacy of a different kind\nand then what do you ex how do you\nexpect them to respond\nwell the thing is i\nexpect them to see it as friendship\nbecause i've laid down how i am friends\nwith people\nand they know this is how i interact\nwith people great\nright so so i'm going to give you an\nexample that's sort of like a bizarre\ncounter example so sometimes\ni work with men and women who\nand unfortunately i think this is harder\nsometimes on women but you'll\nthey'll have friends with benefits right\nand then like\noftentimes what happens is people will\nbe crystal clear at the beginning and\nthey'll say like hey we're just friends\nand from time to time we're going to\nhave like sexual relations\nwe're going to be friends with benefits\nbut i don't want to date you i'm going\nto be super transparent\ni'm not in love with you and then both\npeople agree\nand then oftentimes what happens is like\none person catches feelings\nright and then like the other person\ngets kind of frustrated because they're\nlike hey we talked about this ahead of\ntime\nlike we said this was just friends and\nbenefits we had a conversation about it\ni was very clear that i'm not interested\nin a relationship\nand then the other person is now pushing\nfor a relationship\ndoes that scenario make sense to you or\ni mean\ni know that you tend to be in the\nopposite kind of yeah\nsee what i see there is that you don't\nchoose how you feel\nand that if you put yourself repeatedly\nin a situation that people do often feel\nin love that it happens\nand the the sad thing about emotions is\nthey can escape\nlogic like you can understand how\nsomething works\nand still end up feeling it sure\nabsolutely right so as you said if you\nput yourself in a situation that people\nusually feel loved then like logic can\nkind of go out the window\nand and you know the emotions can start\nto take over\nso if we look at your relationships\nwhere you're emotionally intimate with\npeople and you kind of explain to them\nfor the get-go hey this is what this is\nthis is not what this is and then you do\nsomething that is\nthey've that men are sort of conditioned\nto feel a particular way because usually\nthat kind of emotional intimacy comes\nhand in hand with a relationship\nthen we can kind of see the result\nright just like you said it's sort of\nlike you you're putting yourself in this\nsituation\nwhere or they're putting themselves in a\nsituation where even though you've\nexplained things\nall that logic which may be on some\nlevel they understand can kind of go out\nthe window once they start catching\nfeelings because that's what we're\ntalking about right\nis that they become really really\nirrational with the way that they start\nrelating to you\nand so i think that there's something to\nbe understood here now i'm not saying\nthat you need to\nchange the way that you interact with\nyour friends because you're allowed to\nbe you\nbut i i can sort of see like i think if\nthere's a pattern here there's\nthere's got to be a reason for it\nyeah right and and now we get to to what\nyou said\nearlier which is sort of like i don't\nknow what to do about it right because\nyou're not willing to compromise some\nthings and this gets back to the idea of\nlike\nself blame for attraction and\nresponsibility for attraction and things\nlike that\nand and this is where i i think you have\nto be really really careful anita\nbecause i think\nthere's something going on here which i\ndon't even think we've touched on and\ni'm not sure what it is\nthere's some part of me that honestly\nthinks that given your upbringing\nthere is some part of you so when you\nwhen you have a child\nwhose needs are not met\nright and what i mean by that is that\nlike it's not that anyone was abusive\ntowards you or anything like that but\nthat\nliterally like there was someone in your\nhousehold who demanded a lot of your\nattention and you had to become a mother\nvery early\nright and so when you have a situation\nlike that i'm not sure if any of this\nactually applies to you because i\ni can't actually detect it i'm just\nletting you know oftentimes what i see\nis that like there's a there's a\nstarving\nfor affection or there's a starving for\nlove or there's a starving for something\nthat that child carries with them\nand i suspect that the thing that we may\nbe missing here\nis that in some way you were starved for\nwhat the people are giving you\nbecause i think the really crazy thing\nis that anytime i see a behavior in\nsomeone\nthat seems really really harmful and\nmaladaptive\nthere's usually a damn good reason for\nit\nwell here's the thing my response to\nthat though\nis that i think i've already taken that\npart of the journey\nbecause when i was a kid first up we had\na we had like my mom had boyfriends\nwho'd come in and out of my\nlife i had like a father figure for a\nwhile but he would snap\nhe would turn from he was in our lives\nfor nine years\ni i was glad we pushed my\nlike we were pushed away from my dad i\nwas happy with that decision i was\nsurprised they stayed alone\ntogether as long as they did i saw his\nimpact on other people that he ended up\nraising i'm really glad\nthat we stepped away from him i do not\ncrave a father figure i did not crave a\nfather figure i was glad of the space\ni've been escaping people my whole life\nusually people were very dangerous\ni used to go and break out of my house\nin childhood and just go walking in the\ngraveyard at like 3am just to be away\nfurther away no one was bothering me\njust to be further away from humans\ni was very comfortable even though i was\nlonely\nbeing away from people and pretty much\nseeing them as a threat\nand then i did feel very lonely for a\nwhile and agrophobic and scared and sad\nand alone\nand i got in a chain of relationships\none for a year\none for six years another for six years\nand so\ni coped by putting all of my needs on\none person and it was very codependent\nand unhealthy in a multitude of ways and\nit made me put up with a lot of abuse\nthat i didn't and shouldn't have needed\nto\num i came out of that developing a sense\nof self proving to myself what i'm\ncapable of and looking for just\nfriends and in this whenever i make\nfriends with people\ni don't crave attention i'm not the kind\nof person who immediately reacts to dms\nand needs to know what they say now i'm\nnot the kind of person who chases people\ni never chase after people i'm kind of\nreally lazy friend when it comes to\narranging things and seeing people\ni cannot see someone in months and still\nfeel good that i know them\nand so i don't pursue people and i don't\nfeel particularly desperate for\nattention\num and so from that perspective i don't\nfeel like these people fulfill a need\ni the only need i have now is i want\nplatonic friendships i\ni kind of feel like i don't need the\nattention and i feel very very\ncomfortable without it i spend a lot of\ntime alone and i don't get bored of it\nor desperate for affection or attention\nbut i do think that i did go through a\ntime where i had that need\nand i used to seek it in relationships i\nsaw unhealthy how unhealthy it was i\nworked through it i got over there i got\nout of that situation\nbut with me i kind of feel as well\num i don't think that these people do\nfulfill a need i feel endlessly\nlike they don't fulfill a need because\nthey are\nlooking to [ __ ] me and it feels too\nconceited to recognize what's going on\nearly\nso i go through this place where i they\nkeep pushing my boundaries\nanita let me ask you a question so so\nthis is really helpful\ndo you think that's being someone who\ncontinuously needs to be\n[ __ ] and and being really frustrated\ndoes that feeling of who you are fulfill\nany kind of need\nwhat you mean what it's a weird ass\nquestion\nyeah absolutely so not their behavior\nokay but their behavior makes you feel\nlike a particular kind of person\nright so you feel a particular way\nwhen they treat you a certain way right\nand that way that way feels painful\nyeah right i know it sounds really weird\nreally really weird i'll give you an\nexample in a second does\nfeeling that way feel\ncomfortable or right to you in some way\nit feels familiar and i know that people\ntend to do this awful dance with things\nthat feel familiar and if it's not\nreally what they want\nyep it's called a life trap people get\ntrapped in a pattern of behavior where\nthey don't want it but they've known it\ntheir whole lives and don't know how to\nbe anything else\nand this is why people who were sexually\nabused as children are more likely to\nend up becoming sex workers\neven if it's a very painful thing for\nthem and they don't really want to be\nthere it's so familiar that it ends up\nbeing a life trap\nand this is one example of many people\nwho relive something\nfreud recognized it as repetition\ncompulsion and it's one of the few\nthings that he\nthrew out there and it actually stuck um\nhe was wrong about a lot of things but\nrepetition compulsion is still something\nthat therapists recognize and work\naround and you know\npoint out in people to this day and i\nknew about this from a young age i read\nabout it when i was like nine or ten\nafter going through some pretty\nhorrendous things myself this is why i\nfelt like i avoided that sort of life\ntrap where i'd end up\nin a lot of the positions that people\nwith [ __ ] up lives do\nbecause i knew that there'd be a risk\nfactor for it and the familiarity with\nit\nand so i know exactly what you're trying\nto point out here am i purposely\nunwittingly\nputting myself in positions where that\nare familiar\nas a trap almost like a repetition\ncompulsion\nthat's literally what i was thinking\nabout\nbecause i've already explored this and\nwhat's your sense\num so i think this was the reason why i\ntried so many different approaches\nat interacting with people and to loads\nof different people i thought if i\nhung out with people who were generally\nvery nice that maybe mean people\nwouldn't hang out with me and you know\ni wouldn't on all sorts no no but that's\nwhy you tried to do what you do what do\nyou think about it though\ndo i think that i'm in a situation of\nrepetition compulsion\nyes i think i would have to be able to\naccurately assess\nwhy people like me to be able to\nintroduce it\npurposely i feel like it's difficult to\npin\ni where i went with that is like can i\npinpoint a time where i try to make\npeople attracted to me where i've hit on\nthem or done things that might seem\nseductive\nand then looked back on it and blamed\nmyself and been like yeah my bad or\nwhatever\ni can't find anything i need to suggest\nokay\nyou're so so here's the thing so so\nfirst of all it may not be repetition\ncompulsion but sure as hell sounds like\nit\nokay so let me let me explain to people\nbecause [ __ ] a you were really smart\ni mean i'm very impressed\nso here's here's so this is why i'm\ngoing to just lay it out for you okay so\na lot of times i have to like\nlike lead people to it or try to catch\nhim with it or something like that but\nit's great\nso i was absolutely leaning towards the\nrepetition convulsive compulsion so\nlet's talk about it\nso the first thing is that you have a\npattern in your social interactions\nright you're an outlier\nyour mom is an outlier so what does that\ntell us so either you have something\neither you know there's either there's a\ncognitive bias where you're not really\nan outlier\nor there's something going on that\nis causing people to treat you a\nparticular way\nand then what happens is that you say\nlike okay if if i'm the issue then i'm\ngonna change myself and you tried that\nbecause you're a scientist at heart\nright so you tried wearing a trench coat\nyou tried doing this you tried doing\nthat you tried doing this you tried to\nchange yourself\nand then you're like [ __ ] this i'm gonna\nstop blaming myself for people being\nattracted to me\nit's not on me it's on them then you\nwent the route of let me try to change\nthem\nbecause that's where the problem is and\nthat didn't work either\nright and so then you're like okay well\nnow i don't know what to do because no\nmatter what i do i find myself in the\nsituation\nif i change myself it doesn't work if i\nchange them it doesn't work i'm screwed\nno matter which way i do it it's\nincredibly frustrating i'm incredibly\nangry and then you say\nokay fine so if this is the repetition\ncompulsion what i need to do is look at\npeople that i'm attracted to\nwhereas i think that's actually this is\nwhere hopefully i can help you\ni don't think that's the case that you\nneed to look at in fact i think it's the\nexact\nopposite of the case that you need to\nlook at what i would suspect\nokay and this is by suspect i don't\nnecessarily think this is true i mean\nthis is a hypothesis that needs to be\ntested\nokay so i'm going to put it to you\nplainly\ni want you to find a case where you do\nhave a friend\nwhere you really have a friend because\nwhat you're telling me is that the\nthe relationship evolves over time right\nat the beginning so sure there's the\nbarrage of dicks but the real\ntragedy sure people dehumanize you all\nthey want to do is get their willy wet\nwhatever you want to call it\nthere's that camp of people but the real\ntragedy anita really what\nthe place where my heart goes out to you\nis that there are some people who don't\nstart out in that camp\nand then suddenly they transform on you\nand that's what sounds like it real\nsucks a bag of dicks\nright that's what's really awful is that\nyou have people who\nare your friends and then like this\nbeast comes out of them where they like\nturn into everyone else\nthe explanation i've heard is that they\nhad the intentions\nfrom the start they just didn't feel\ncomfortable\nexpressing them and so\nyeah i wonder how many are people that\ngrew\nan attraction and how many people were\njust playing the long game\nbecause i've had people throw tantrums\nyou know the\nnice guys who are like i listened to\nyour problems i hung out with you\ni believe one time yeah and they're like\ni'd like to cash in\ni'd like to cash in all of those things\nnow yeah turning in my tickets\nyeah absolutely exactly and you know you\nget a lot of people who\num this is why i always get scared about\ntalking about demisexuality it took me i\nmade a video about it explaining what it\nwas it took\ndemo sexuality i'm not attracted to\npeople at all\ni i am unreceptive to visual stimuli i\nthought i was asexual for so [ __ ]\nlong\nand it turns out that i need a\nlong-standing emotional connection and a\nsense of familiarity\nto see people through a sexual lens i\ncan't feel attracted to strangers i've\nnever had a crush on a celebrity\nnothing it just does not work lady boner\ndoes not happen to porn\nnothing turns out that there is a group\nof people like this there are people\nmost people are capable of crushing\nwe're not i have never felt attracted to\nanyone i didn't know and it's usually\npeople i've only known for a few years\nthat i've ever been able to see\nin a sexual way or be attracted to ever\nand so this is called demisexuality so\nthat people can connect with people\nwho are like this too because it kind of\nfeels alien in a society where tinder\nexists and you look at people's face\nand you swipe and you know whether or\nnot you want to sleep with them based on\nthat one trait alone from the start\nand so a lot of people a lot of people\nare lacking that and i just am lacking\nit it's dead i don't know what happened\ni was just born without the ability to\njust be attracted to strangers\njust can't um and you wouldn't think\nthat was a unusual thing plenty of\npeople oh i prefer\na connection too but you can watch porn\nand you can like have\na celebrity crush and [ __ ] like you are\ncapable of a superficial attraction\ni'm just not and um it comes with trials\nand tribulations\nbut i'm so scared about talking about it\nbecause it makes people play the long\ngame\nso like i when i make new friends with\nguys and stuff i don't say it\ni don't talk about it and you know\npeople ask me what i look for in a man\nall the time\nin chat and i'm just like why would it\ntell you what to pretend to be to get\nclose to me\nlike i'm so wary about it but um\nyeah i do have to wonder like it's so\nhard i know where you're trying to lead\nme here\nand i've thought about it too um where\nam i trying to lead you\nwell you're trying to lead me down the\nwell what makes\npeople suddenly be attracted to me\nduring a friendship and it's so hard to\ncollate the data on whether that's\nactually the problem\nor if a lot of people disguise their\nattraction to me and wait\nbecause they know it takes a long time\nfor me to know whether i'm attracted to\nanybody in the first place\num and so it's very very difficult for\nme to assess reliably\nat all whether or not it's true that\nfriends fall in love with me\nor people just play the long game so i\nthink i think that's\nthat's actually like a great answer\nbecause that tells us i think where the\ndarkness\nand potentially where the answer is\nright so like you're saying it's hard\nfor you to assess and i think that's\nexactly why you're in this situation\nbecause\ni one of the hypotheses so there's a\nnumber of hypotheses right\nand and i would say that given\neverything\nabout your history\nthis reeks of something like repetition\ncompulsion or\nsomething like pheromones and i tend to\nput more stock in the former than the\nlatter\nand what i'm really really curious about\ni would love to see if there are\ninteractions that you have with people\nwho are potentially friends which you\nunwittingly push into a weird space\nright and that may be something as\nsimple as someone who is actually could\nbe a friend of yours\nyou or like it could be like a weird\nkind of selection bias where you say\nyou're not really good at keeping up\nwith friends and so there may be like\nlet's say that there are 10\npeople that you encounter and you're not\ngood at keeping up with friends so the\nones that would actually end up being\nfriends\nyou sort of don't keep up with and who's\nleft are the people who are secretly\nobsessed\nyeah that that is something that has\nbeen running a theory of mine for a\nwhile\nright so that's why um yeah because um\nyeah people who wake up every day and\nask how you're doing in the morning and\nsay good night at night\nlike most of my friends aren't like that\nbut the people who are interested in me\nwill try to talk to me every single day\neven if they don't always cry\nyeah so so so i mean there are a lot of\nthings going on here which i think like\nlike whether wittingly or unwittingly\nlike\ntheir influences and this is kind of\nwhat i was saying where i'm not saying\nthat you should blame yourself for like\nbeing in this situation\nsort of it's not really about blame it's\nabout recognizing that\nif there's a pattern in your life\nthinking about it critically looking at\nit critically which clearly you've done\na shitload of\nand i think that's why i mean it's\namazing anita how far you've come\ngiven the hand that you were dealt and\nand that's what actually frankly is so\ngratifying\nto me about having this conversation is\nbecause i've seen people who are at\nevery stage of where you are but i've\nnever actually seen someone at this\nstage\ni've seen people who are in the six-year\ncodependent relationship because their\nmother was sick\nwhen they were growing up and they\nlearned how to be like a mother at a\nyoung age i've seen that\nright i've seen it right so you've been\nall of those things and now you're in\nthis really weird\nkind of situation where unfortunately\none of the real challenges in life is\nthat\nwhen we solve the as we solve problems\nthey start to get more and more subtle\nright so you've done a lot of personal\ngrowth you've developed a lot of\nconfidence\nyou've tried to change yourself for\nother people you've tried to change\nother people you figured out know that\nstuff works\nso now we're getting to this yoga talks\na lot about this that like\nthe most difficult problems to solve are\nthe subtlest\nand i think what we're really dealing\nwith is like really really small stuff\nprobably in the early stages of your\npotential friendships\nwhere either there's a selection bias or\nyou steer things a certain way\nor there are like unconscious reactions\nthat you have that cause you to deviate\ntowards the familiar\nright and then there's also like really\nreally simple epidemiologic stuff which\nis like you're a twitch streamer\nso you're gonna attract a certain kind\nof person\nbut what i'm hearing from you is that\ndoesn't seem to be that big of a deal\nbecause it sounds like you have a lot of\ninteractions outside of twitch and stuff\nlike that and you\nshould run into normal people but\nand the last thing is that you do use\nthe word friend so it sounds like you\nactually have friends\nwhich has been confusing me for a while\nso i have my editor i've known him for\n10 years\nhe's amazing he's never hit on me ever\num he's always gone for a different kind\nof person which has been oddly\ncomforting to me\num we've done a lot of rescue work\ntogether but we don't have a close\nfriendship\nand a behavior well we do in some ways\nbut not most so\nwhat i consider a close friendship is\nsomeone i spend a lot of time with\nand i find it really really difficult to\ndo that with people one of the reasons\nwhy i'm under invested in friendships\nis because if i feel like i spend too\nmuch time with someone that\nit can fall apart like you give more\nroom for mistakes for misunderstandings\nfor\nbitterness this sort of stuff so if you\nhang out with someone once every couple\nof months you play a few games with them\nhere and there\nthey are at the right distance where\nthey can't get over invested in the\nfriendship and start hitting on you\nbut you can't you also don't actively\nannoy them and if you are mildly\nannoying\nlike once or twice you won't happen\nloads and loads in a week and you lose\nthem so i do hope people ask that\ndistance\nyeah but i mean that's what i'm [ __ ]\ntalking about that like that's that's\nlike this is what i'm talking about like\nyou know this [ __ ]\nright and you're like why don't i have\nfriends and you're like it's because i\nhold people at a distance because i'm\nafraid if they get too close\nthen then they're gonna fall in love\nwith me\ni have a few i have a handful of friends\nthat i've known for years and i love\nthem deeply\nand i feel like it's partly because i've\nkept them at just the right distance\ni feel like i get to hang out with them\nreally love those days i spend with them\ndo you want to spend more time with them\nno because then awful things might\nhappen\nokay so see that's where so so you do\nthis thing a lot where i sometimes\nask you what you want and instead of\nanswering what you want you talk about\nwhat's gonna happen\ntrue but that those are\nthere is what you want and there is\nwhat's gonna happen\nabsolutely but i'm just saying it's\nimportant for you to not\nconflate the two i'm not disputing that\nthat's what's going to happen because\nthat's been your experience\nbut i suspect that something around this\nrealm of stuff right like\nif you have a pattern that repeats in\nyour life\nare you responsible for it like should\nyou blame yourself if men are attracted\nto you and change what you wear and\nstuff like that like i don't want to go\ndown that road but\nat the same time i do feel that as a\nhuman being you have some degree of\nagency and control over your life\nand in fact here your story i think\nexemplifies that principle that you\nwere a particular way and you started to\nmake changes in the way that you treated\nyourself you started to make changes in\nthe kinds of people that you hung out\nwith\nand you're no longer in codependent\nrelationships with arguably abusive\npeople\nand the next step i think is one of\nsubtlety where you found that okay\nyou keep people at arm's length and\nthey're kind of friends for a while and\nif you're too emotionally intimate with\nthem too quickly\nthey tend to fall in love with you and\nsome of them play the long game and what\nnot and what not and what not all that i\nthink is perfect\nbut i think you just keep on moving in\nthat direction keep on paying attention\nto yourself and try to\naccelerate a friendship a little bit\nmore and be\ncareful because i suspect that sometimes\nso there's there's old pattern territory\nwhich is like emotionally intimate\nfriendships\nand then there's new safe friendships\nwhich are kind of\ntemporally distant or geographically\ndistant or emotionally distant in like\ndrips and drops at regular intervals\nthat doesn't\ncross the line into the old familiar\nterritory\nbut i think the closer you get to that\nborder and the more you pay attention to\nyourself\nthere's no [ __ ] way anita that if you\ndon't explore this more\nyou're not going to learn something\nvaluable i just don't buy that the one\nthing that i have\nabsolute confidence in is that if you\nunderstood the repetition compulsion at\nthe age of nine\nand you grew up with your mom and then\nyou had a toxic amount of positivity\nand self-deprecation and putting other\npeople first and then you show up\na few months later pissed at the whole\nworld that's an immense amount of growth\ni think if you just keep yeah i don't\nknow\ni think it's hard from this session to\nreally understand\nwhat is a jump and what's not i i kind\nof feel like\nso i do think that my generosity is real\ni do think that my\nurge to connect with others and be\nbeneficial to others is real i don't\nthink it's an\nissue i don't think that just because i\ngrew up a carer that altruism isn't\n[ __ ] real\ni don't think that it's a flaw with me i\ndon't think that i'm deranged i don't\nthink that i donated a thousand pounds\nto you because i'm hot potatoing\nother people's generosity i think that\nthere's something intrinsic in all of us\nthat feels\ngood when we do good and it doesn't have\nto benefit us directly i think that's\nreal in people that have suffered just\nas much as people you haven't i think\nit's real in me even though i had a\n[ __ ] up childhood i don't think it's a\nsymptom i think it's an aspect\nand a positive aspect of me and i think\nthat\nthe more that you i i know it's very\neasy there is this risk when you're a\ntherapist\nthat you draw false correlations\nsometimes because you're so used to this\npattern and i do it myself even though\ni'm not\nbeing a therapist to others but one of\nthe common things is like\na lot of therapists who receive children\nwho've been\nput into foster care or have been you\nknow have lost both their parents\nthey they tend to think that people\nwho've lost both their parents tend to\nbe criminals or have issues\nor people who know about when it is\npeople who've been abused in childhood\nthey think that it unanimously makes\npeople abuses because most of the people\nwho come to them\nare people who have negative results\nfrom that childhood experience\nbut the people who grow up to be healthy\nthe people who grow up to be great\nand the people who have grow up without\nissues and you know get past it\nnever show up at a therapist door so\nthey never see them\nand so there's this idea that a higher\npercentage of people who have childhood\ntrauma have issues\nthan actually do because believe it or\nnot sometimes people go through hard\n[ __ ]\nand you know what are you hearing me say\ni'm hearing you say that this is somehow\nmy fault that this is a psychological\nphenomenon\nthat my generosity is the result of\nbeing a carer and b have not having my\nneeds met and that the reason why people\nfall in love with me\nis because i'm just repeating some\ntraumatic cycle\nbut at some point i've got to stop\ntaking responsibility for other people's\nproblems and i'm definitely\nnot the only [ __ ] woman who gets hit\non and says no one doesn't get hurt\nbecause a dude's thinking more about his\ndicks than his dick than the way he's\naffecting the people that he's attracted\nto\ni definitely think that is something\nthat i've experienced and it's part of\nit too\nbut also i think that if i keep on\nswitching my behavior i'm constantly\nadjusting myself so i don't trigger\nyou know the weak wills of some people\nmale or female\nthat i won't have any room to be my\n[ __ ] self because i'm so preoccupied\nwith how people are reacting to me\nand how what they might or might not do\nthat i won't be able to just enjoy\nconnecting with people and being myself\nso i think there has to be room for the\nidea\nthat maybe not all of it is me because\nother people do experience this too\nthere is a problem with men respecting\nboundaries and thinking the friend zone\nis a zone\nand not just no like people call it cute\nzones so they can be all creepy and go i\ndon't have to listen to this i can make\nyou like me\nbecause it's just a cute little zone i'm\nin and i can step out of it not consent\nor anything\ni'm not a weirdo ignoring your consent\ni'm so sorry\nthese conversations i'm seeing in chat\nand i'm just kind of exploding a little\nbit because everyone's like\nyou just don't understand biology dudes\ncan't be friends with women or\nyou you need to change this about you\nyou're just whining about being\nattractive oh boo hoo i don't sympathize\n[ __ ] you\nand i'm so tired of being hated and i'm\nblamed when people hit on me when people\n[ __ ] try to feel me up when i'm drunk\nand [ __ ] i'm so tired of being blamed\nwhen other people do this stuff because\nthey ignore what i'm saying\nand i'm so tired of adjusting myself\nbeing this\nbeing that being cold being soft being\nwarm being friendly\n[ __ ] punching people in the face i'm\ntired of wearing this wearing that i'm\ntired of being held responsible for the\nway that people behave when the truth of\nthe matter is that my no is not a zone\nthat you get out of it's a [ __ ] no\nso let me clarify so you're saying\nthat i'm saying that this is your\nfault and that you create this because\nof some psychological thing that\nhappened in your childhood\nthat your altruism is a reaction\nto some sort of psychological trauma\nthat's what you're you're hearing me say\nit is sometimes i feel like you're\ndirecting me to a sense of\nresponsibility for other people's\nactions when we don't control them\nand it's not always because i'm\nattracting people i am thinking the\nroots that you've\nyou're taking me i've spoken to\ntherapists in the past\nand i've talked about how i interact\nwith people i've talked about why i've\ntalked about why with people that i've\nstopped being friends with\ni've had very sober cold conversations\nwith people who turned into [ __ ]\ncreeps\nand gone why did this happen i don't\nwant it to happen again\nand and i have also talked to therapists\nabout why\nand what i hear from you sometimes is\nthat you're diagnosing\nnot just my altruism but other people's\ndisrespect of my boundaries which i'm\nfar too accommodating of i let it go on\nfor too long and that's on me i know it\nis\nbut i do give clear signs that people\nshould listen to along the way\nand i do think that it's not just me i\ndo think that there are things that\nother people have to take responsibility\nfor too and it's something it took me a\nlong time to recognize\nyeah so uh just curious so thank you for\nclarifying that\nand i i apologize for conveying that\nsentiment so i just want to make sure i\nwant to apologize appropriately so i\nwant to make sure\ni understand what am i diagnosing you\nwith\nso you see it as a repetition compulsion\nthat there's some aspect of my behavior\nthat traps me specifically in this loop\nthat this there is an active aspect of\nmy behavior\nthat makes people behave in a way that\nthey shouldn't\nokay so i actually\ni agree with some of that so let me try\nto clarify and then you let me know if\nan apology is appropriate\ni'm happy to because i i this\nconversation just took a turn that was\nreally not where i was intending to go\nand if i made a mistake i'm more than\nhappy to apologize for it i just really\nwant to understand what that mistake is\nso the reason i brought up the\nrepetition compulsion with you is so let\nme walk you through my reasoning and\nthen you let me know whether an apology\nis appropriate or not\nso generally speaking human beings tend\nto encounter\ncommon situations in life right like we\nrun into the same problems over and over\nand over again\nand here's what i heard you say so i\nheard you say that you run into this\nproblem over and over and over again and\nit's hard for you to make friends\nbecause they don't respect your\nboundaries and sometimes you're overly\naccommodating and things like that\nfine i accept that i accept that you're\nin the situation that you're in\ni accept that it's very difficult for\nyou to make friends i accept that people\nstart with friendship and then ask for\nmore i accept that\nyou have tried to change yourself to\naccommodate them right\nyou've tried to transform yourself to\ncontrol their behavior\nand that's not fair to you and that's\nnot the right answer which i agree\ncompletely\nyou've also tried to change them which\nisn't your [ __ ] responsibility\nbecause it's their job to change\nthemselves\nyou're not responsible for changing some\nsomeone else i completely agree with\nthat and so then we end up with this\nreality right because that's what you're\ntelling me anita is that\nirrespective of you trying to change\nyourself and irrespective of you trying\nto change other people\nyou're [ __ ] stuck and people don't\nrespect you they don't respect your\nboundaries\neither they're just looking to get their\nwheelie wet or they're playing the long\ngame or\nat the end of the day they start out as\nfriends and then something happens and\nthen even though you've been crystal\nclear\nyou wind up in this situation\nwe on the same page there is there\nanything\nabout that that you think i have done\nwrong or unfair\nor that i should apologize for\nso far no not in that aspect\nof the parts that i think issue with\nwere the parts where\nyou start using words like at some point\nyou have to take responsibility for\nyou know this pattern and those sorts of\nwords where it's still\nmy fault that some people can't respect\nboundaries because this is amount to\nstuff that's very very serious that most\npeople know is wrong regardless of my\nbehavior i could cartwheel down the\nstreet naked\nand i still don't deserve to be\nassaulted and stoked\nyeah so so let me let me try to add some\nnuance to that\nand if that still feels like it's wrong\nto you please let me know\nokay so here's here's the challenge so\ni'm stuck\nbetween a rock and a hard place because\nas a human being\ni accept that you are who you are and i\nthink you should accept yourself for\nyours\nyourself i also accept that\ni don't control other people's behavior\nand i'm not responsible for other\npeople's behavior\nand so then the question becomes what is\nmy role in life\nwhat do i control what is the part of my\nlife that i have agency over\nand what i find is that the more that\npeople accept\nthat you do have some influence in it\nright like at the end of the day if i\nfind myself in a situation\nover and over and over again i would\nhope\nand part of what i absolutely try to do\nis to help people understand that you\nhave some power to change this\nbecause anita if there's one [ __ ]\nthing that you've demonstrated to me\nit's that you have the power to change\nyour life\nthink about where you grew up think\nabout the co-dependent relationships you\nhave\nthink about where you are now think\nabout all the way you've come what do\nyou think you think other people did\nthat\nyou did that right the person that you\nwere started to shine through\nand you helped her out i don't think\nthat i think your altruism is\nabsolutely genuine i think it's part of\nwhat makes you amazing\ni think you're incredibly authentic and\ni think it confuses the [ __ ] out of some\npeople\nwho have been societally conditioned in\na bad way\ni don't think that's your fault i don't\nthink you should change who you are\nand at the same time i have to\nacknowledge and i really do believe that\nyou have\nsome agency over your situation\ni don't think that woe is me is like\nlike absolutely woe is you but if anyone\nhas the capacity to\nnavigate this tricky [ __ ] it's you\nand i do believe that you have some\npower here that you have some control\nhere and i think when i say that\nwhat either consciously or unconsciously\ni'm signaling or what you're receiving\nis that it's your fault\nand that's a really tricky place to be\nin right because like\nif we accept that we have power to\nchange something\nthen it becomes in a sense our fault\nso i think that your interpretation of\nmy words is sort of inappropriate\nit's just not meant to be blame it's\njust like you can't have agency without\nresponsibility the two come hand in hand\nand and the emotional response\nthat i got from you which i've seen\nemotions come which i think is\ncompletely authentic\nand and now i'm not trying to like oh\nyou emotionally responded therefore\nyou're wrong so like don't take it that\nway but\ni think there's something really\nimportant there right i don't know what\nit is\nand what i'm really trying to say is\nthat there's a road forward i have to\nhope like so when any time i sit with\nsomeone anita\ni don't part of what i try really hard\nto do part of what i try to have\nagency and control over in myself is to\nhope that your situation can get better\nand in what ways can your situation get\nbetter like how like and that's why i\ntalk about the [ __ ] psychological\n[ __ ]\nbecause i think you already understand\nthis stuff and i think that you're a\nhuman too\nand what i see is that you've exhausted\na lot of really good options\nyou try to change the way that you dress\nyou try to fix other people and neither\nof them worked\nso i think there's something in the\nmiddle there right that that and we kind\nof see it in your patterns of friendship\nthat either people get overly invested\nin your friendship\nor you keep them at arm's length and\nthat makes me\nsad because that's not what you want\nyou want something between those two\nthings\nright and so then the question is what\ni'm encouraging you to do and what i'm\nreally saying that you should do\nis over here is safety but emotional\ndistance and over here is intimacy and\npeople misconstruing what you say\nthere's something there in the middle\nand as you move towards something in the\nmiddle i want you to really understand\nand if this is something that you take\nissue with please let me know\nas you navigate that tightrope in the\nmiddle i absolutely believe you have\nsome control over how that turns out\nyeah someone in chat is saying something\nreally interesting about this\nand i don't normally talk i don't\nnormally bring it up but someone's\nsaying i think the\ndisconnection here is partially as a\nresult of the implied\ndynamic default dynamic associated with\ntherapy therapists specialize in\nindividual problems but what anita seems\nto be struggling with is more of a\nsocietal problem\nthat being that men are rarely\ndiscouraged from overstepping their\nboundaries\ni don't think dr k is going to uh i\ndon't know\nzooming too fast he's going to going out\nof his way to downplay that factor in\nthis conversation\nbut is his profession and i do think\nthere is an intersection here between\nthe fact that\nthis is not something that is entirely\ncontrollable or influenced\nuh easy to influence because there is a\nsocietal\naspect at play and it is impossible for\nit to be\nconsistent as well because the\noverstepping of boundaries can vary so\nmuch\nthis is why i was looking for patterns\nso i could interrupt the path\nabsolutely so so i think that person is\nspot on and this is frankly why the deck\nis stacked against you and this is why i\nthink that you haven't figured it out\nalready\nright because it there is like finding\nthat balance is\nreally hard because there is this\nsocietal conditioning\nand that's what i was like the whole\nmaternal shakti thing that i was kind of\ntalking about is like this idea that\ni think you are giving someone an\nauthentic version of yourself\nand they've been conditioned to\ninterpret that a different way which is\nnot your fault\nand i don't think you should change who\nyou are i think who you are is awesome\nand what i'm saying is that in the\nmiddle there\nit behooves you to think about\nthis psychological [ __ ] like the\nrepetition compulsion because one of two\nthings is gonna happen\non the one hand shirt maybe i'm judging\nyou and i'm saying oh this is the\nrepetition component blah blah blah\nfreud blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nthis is what's going on with you anita i\nhave it all figured out i don't give a\n[ __ ] about that i don't give a [ __ ]\nabout figuring it out\nwhat i'm saying is if there's any\nmileage to be picked up there\nto get you in the direction that you\nwant to go if there's even one percent\nof the repetition compulsion\nthat lets you walk that tightrope\n[ __ ] look at it\nand rather than me analyzing it you're\nthe one who used the phrase repetition\ncompulsion so i'm like\ndamn right anita see if that's what's\ngoing on\ni can't give you answers anita i can't\ngive you conclusions\nthe most i can do is give you hypotheses\nyeah and there's something here\nwhere i think that you should be\nauthentic\nyou should be who you are and you've got\nthe deck stacked against you in terms of\nsocietal conditioning\nand i choose to hope\nthat you don't have to be trapped in\nthis situation together and that you can\nmove one step closer to that midpoint\nand i think doing so is going to involve\nlooking at not the drastic\nsets of your behavior but really\nstudying how you interact with people\nbecause i think any relationship is a\ntwo-way street\ni i i also know that first-person\nperspective it's very easy to miss\nthings that the\nperson perspective would get far more\neasily um it's like my aim is terrible\nwhen i'm first person but when i'm third\nperson in a shooter i can suddenly\nactually connect with the with the\nheadshots and click heads\nand so i think i i've asked my closest\nfriends who are with me when things have\nhappened and gone\ndid i do anything to make him think that\ni'm attracted to him did i do\nanything to make him think that this was\nokay and\nso far the resounding aspects that i\ni i don't miss this i see it but i don't\nknow how to avoid it\nit's like they were saying well he\npushed boundaries here and here and here\nand normally i'd have gotten pissed off\npunched him kicked him away you know\nkicked him to the curb\nand you were forgiving like you did\nyeah see that's that's one of the things\nthat really really frustrates me because\ni think like that\nthe problem there is that i don't\nif you're a forgiving person like i\nthink that's a good thing\nright i'm looking for option c which is\nnot for you to be less forgiving\nor for him to not put like i i i want\nyou to continue to be who you are and\nfind\nsome road through this and i completely\nagree with you with the first person\nthird-person stuff\nso i think actually what you've got to\nfigure out anita is why this happens to\nyour mom\nyeah well well when i look at my mom\nbecause i thought about that too\nand i look at my mom and she's very very\ncapable\nso like everything about her is just\ngenuinely admirable and awesome and\nthere are aspects of it that don't apply\nto me\nfor example pretty much most of her\nboyfriends have been gay like\ncompletely gay like never had a\ngirlfriend before or after her\num and the\nthing is like she has her own life chaps\nand things like that and she's helped me\nlearn to escape a lot of bad things\num just by learning from the lessons of\nher life i'm grateful for her failings\nas much as her\nlike positives just because it's helped\nme to grow in many ways\nand navigate the world um but like so\ni'm not gonna fault her\nfor them i can understand how she ends\nup in some of the situations she's in\nbut i also think that she's just\ngenerally a brilliant woman\nshe really is she's very impressive in\nmany many different ways she looks young\nfor age she's very beautiful\num she's like really unique she's like\nthis goth and she has like really great\nmakeup and really great personality and\nshe's interested in all these cool\nthings\nshe's a fantastic artist she's a\nscientist she's a photographer she was a\ndancer\nand she aced all of those things and she\nhas a myriad of\nshe was a kickboxer and she competed\nagainst men and won things because she\nwas very very good at it\neverything she tries her hand at she's\namazing at and to this day she's really\ncrippled by a very very debilitating\nillness\nand she still finds ways to create\nbeautiful things and do\nvery impressive things she's just very\nvery amazing in every respect and a lot\nof guys don't just look at her and think\ni like her they think i want to be her\nthis is why so many gay guys like her as\nwell because they don't just\nlike her they want to be her she is the\nif they could be a woman they would be\nher\nsort of thing and so there's a lot of\nadmiration involved and i've\nnoticed that because i see it on twitch\nchat a lot um\na lot of guys don't have to be\nattractive they can be very average and\nbe huge on this platform they don't have\nto be attractive\num and the thing is when guys are young\nthey're not taught to relate to women\nnobody dresses up as princess leia when\nthey're kids no dudes are allowed to\ndress as women it has a stigma attached\nto it\nand so when people aspire to be us\nthey're usually women\nother women and not a lot of dudes\nactually relate to us as if what they\nwant to aspire to be like us because\nthere's\nsome sort of mental block there where\nadmiration equals attraction\nand so usually with me people don't\nusually relate to me they aspire to be\nwith me when they see positive traits\nabout me they confuse it with attraction\nrather than just relating to you or\ntaking inspiration from another human\nbeing it's a trap that a lot of female\nstreamers\nfall into but we get heavily policed for\nbehavior that big\nmale streamers don't men can be toxic\nand it can be fun to watch but when\nwomen are toxic nobody wants to be\nwith a woman who is toxic so it's not as\nentertaining because it puts you\noff them whereas if you found us\ngenerally relatable\nif you were trying to relate to us\nrather than possess us\nthese things wouldn't get an entirely\ndifferent reaction\nfrom the audience and so i see it\nmanifest a lot in twitch i see it as a\nvery very big thing\nand so a lot of people don't just a\nconfusion with admiration and attraction\ni see and so and so a lot of guys\nconflate\nadmiration with attraction if the person\nthey admire happens to ha\nhave female genitalia it's very very\ndifficult to separate the two\nand so when it's the opposite sex or the\nsex that you're attracted to\nand so a lot of people admire my mother\nand so they conflate that with\nattraction it becomes attraction because\nthat's how men are comfortable admiring\nwomen\nthey're not encouraged from a young age\nto admire women from an aspirational\nperspective\nand my mom is very very admirable in\nevery sense of the word are you\nshe's i don't know i don't admire me\nbut my mom's just like different let's\njust think about what you're saying\nright like so what i'm like if i put so\ni'm going to\ncreate a constellation out of the stars\nthat you laid so this could be my\ninterpretation\nso you let me know if this is fair or\nunfair okay so i'm interpreting\nsomething here\nso people can conflate admiration with\nattraction\nso you're saying that your mom is very\nadmirable i asked you\nwhy why does this happen to your mom and\nthen you went on on this thing about\nadmiration and attraction fine\nokay cool let's accept that so therefore\nthe reason that people\nyou know bump heads when they try to\nkiss your mom's hand is because they're\nconflating admiration with attraction\nand now what's happening is you're\ntalking about twitch and then you segue\nto twitch and you segue to you know\ndouble standards between\nfemale streamers and male streamers\ntotally get that\nand so that now what what i'm if i kind\nof put that consolation together because\nthose are parts of the same conversation\nwhich started from the question of why\nare people attracted to your mom\nand what i would piece together is that\npart of the reason that people are\nattracted to you\nis because they admire certain qualities\nabout you\nand then they conflate those with\nattraction\ni don't i don't know if that's true i\ni don't i don't really see myself as a\nvery admirable person\nright so so like let's think about that\nright so like i don't know okay so i'm\ngonna try to be\nokay so i asked you a question why are\npeople attracted to your mom\nand you said they conflate admiration\nwith attraction\nand then you talked about twitch and\nthen you were like\nyou know like people anyway so\ni think there are a lot of qualities\nabout you that are very admirable and if\nyou're confused about why people\nare attracted to you and why this keeps\nhappening like my point is that this\nconfusion can be understood\nright like your confusion about why this\npattern happens i believe as a scientist\ngenerally speaking\nif you look into patterns you can find\nanswers that is also a fault of my\nprofession\nbecause my profession is filled with\nunfalsifiable hypotheses\nright so i can dig into like whatever\nkind of theory i want to\nand you can say whatever you want to and\ni can still convince myself that i'm\nright and you're wrong\nthat you're just in denial that's that's\nthe trump card of the therapist\nmy patient is in denial right so i have\nto watch out about that cognitive bias\nwhich is why i'm laying it out to you\nand i'm trusting you and you because you\n[ __ ] come this far you haven't done\nthis [ __ ] with my help\nthe best i can do is give you hypotheses\nand then like the person that you\nare that has gone from where you were\nwhen you were a kid to the person that\nyou are now i have faith that person can\nfigure that [ __ ] out if i can help him\nout a little bit\ngreat so here's the last thing i'll\nleave you with\nokay maybe the reason that it's\nconfusing that people are attracted to\nyou is because you don't see\nwhat they find admirable you don't see\nyourself as admirable which whereas they\nfind you is very admirable\nmaybe you're actually a really admirable\nperson\nright maybe maybe you can talk about\nyour mom and how she creates art and\nthis kind of stuff and you have some\nkind of standard in your mind whatever\nbut that if i were to tell you and and i\nwas gonna sound weird but like let's\njust lay this out right you're an\nauthentic person\nyou genuinely care about people you go\nout of your way to try to help people\nyou care about animals you oftentimes\nput other people ahead of yourself\nyou're intelligent you think about\nsocietal problems\nyou're self-reflective you're a streamer\non twitch you're charismatic\nwhen people attack you with toxicity you\nrespond with humor\nyou wear a hat on your head that says\nsimp you joke about being bald\nand then normalize that experience for\nother people\nyou take something that is one of the\nmost shame inducing things in the world\nfor men\nlet alone women if you want to talk\nabout double standards there talk about\nbaldness\nand then you scratch your head when\npeople think you're admirable\nwell thank you i don't think there's a\nlot of women\nroom for women to see themselves as\nadmirable i think it's very very\ndifficult because\nthere are songs about how the most\nattractive thing about a woman is when\nshe doesn't know she's attractive\nthere are bits in tv shows and sitcoms\nfind a girl with low self-esteem because\nthey'll do more in the bedroom\npeople don't like women who have good\nself-esteem the minute you ever try to\nlike yourself people try to rip it from\nyou constantly and call it narcissistic\nand\nconceited we'll chisel and carve a\nbeautiful statue of a woman\nand we'll call it beautiful but if we\nput a mirror in our hand we'll call it\nnarcissism we'll call it\nvanity that same statue because she's\nadmiring the same view everybody else is\nit's so difficult to build any\nself-esteem in this environment\nand i think a lot of guys are very\nheavily intimidated by the idea that\nsomeone might know their worth\nbecause a lot of people are insecure and\nthey think if you like yourself\nyou'll realize that you deserve better\nthan me and i've seen that and i've had\nmen\nsay it to me i've had my i've battled\nwith my self-esteem my whole life\nand it's very very difficult to even\nlook for long enough to come to any\nconclusions because it feels dangerous\neveryone will hate me if i ever admire\nmyself this is a scary\nline of thought i don't know how to\ncompliment myself i don't know how for\nit\nhow it can be okay i don't know if this\nis a safe thing to talk about\nlet's change the subject because\neveryone compliments you but nobody\nwants you to believe it\nand people get offended and take it back\nif you ever do if you ever want proof of\nthis there are whole compilations of\nwomen accepting compliments on the\ninternet where guys like oh i didn't\nknow you were full of yourself\ni take it back you know and so\ni i don't know if it's something that i\nam ever\nnot gonna find confusing because i don't\nlive\nin a world and a space where it's safe\nfor me to ever admire myself\ni don't think it's comfortable to sit\nand think about myself positively i'm\nreally i feel panicked when i do um you\nknow\nlike when you're in a in a stealth game\nand\nslowly you get more and more noticed\nlike you're off in the distance\nand the npcs can't quite see you yet but\nthere's like a rumple pack letting you\nknow that you're about to be seen and\nyou need to hide\nand if you stand still long enough um\neveryone panics and knows you're there\nand starts attacking you\ni feel that little rumble pack warning\nemotionally\nanytime i try to think about anything\npositive about myself\nand i know where it comes from and i see\nit in other women and i don't think it\ncould be remedied\ni don't think i'm in a position to ever\nnot find this confusing because it's not\nsafe for me to be okay with myself\nto have any self-esteem let alone\ncompliment myself\nand i know that's an issue which makes\nit really hard to assess what you're\nputting\ntowards me you're asking me to see and\nassess\nany positive attributes of myself and\ni'm saying that emotionally in society\nsociety i'm not in a position to do so\nif this is the answer it's going to be\nthe hardest hurdle of my life to ever\nclear because i have to accurately\nand comfortably see positives in myself\nand it's just really [ __ ] scary and\nhard\nso anita you've put me in an interesting\nposition\nyou've put me in a position where having\nfaith in you\nburdens you\nright because my instinctual answer is\ni'm glad you understand it my\ninstinctual answer is\nif i have faith that you can do it is it\ngoing to be hard absolutely is society\nrunning against you\nabsolutely are you do you live in a\nworld where you're not allowed to do\nthat absolutely\ni won't disagree with any of those\nthings and now we get to the\nthe bias of an individual person\na psychiatrist versus a sociologist\nso the person in your chat was spot on\nso my experience has been\nthat if you want to change the world\nthis is just mine i'm not saying it's\nthe only way to do it my way of trying\nto change the conditioning of the world\nhas been through self-reflection\nwalk this journey yourself and then just\nlet other people watch\nand there's a part of me that says it's\nscary it's hard it's insensitive\nof me to say just try anyway because if\nit's too hard it's too hard\nif you're never going to be able to do\nit then that's cool that's\nfine i accept that if you choose that\nyou don't want to try i accept that too\nwhat i don't accept is that it's going\nto be impossible for you\nbecause anita if there's one thing\nyou've demonstrated to me it's that\nyou've defied the impossible\nyou've done a lot of things that i've\ntalked to a lot of women\nwho say this is impossible\ni've talked to a lot of women in abusive\nunhealthy codependent relationships and\nliterally\nyou know why they don't leave\nbecause it's impossible to leave yeah\npeople feel trapped absolutely\nand so who am i gonna who am i gonna put\nmy money i'm gonna put my\nmoney on [ __ ] you because you felt\ntrapped before and you've come out of it\nagain and again and again\nand trying to ask your question yeah go\nhome go for it\nhow do you balance self-esteem because\nthis is something that i think a lot of\npeople would benefit\na lot of people that are watching us\nright now are going to be the\ndemographic for twitch is\namerican dudes in i.t most of them are\npeople that\nyou know are not going to relate to the\nissue of me\nhaving too many people fall in love with\nme but what they are going to relate to\ni think this benefits everyone listening\nto you right now\nis how do you reliably have self-esteem\nbecause\npeople don't buy [ __ ] unless they feel\n[ __ ] the whole world has a whole economy\nbased on making us feel inferior and\ninsecure\nbecause it makes you buy [ __ ] to fix it\nand solve problems that aren't really\nthere\nwe're all told from a young age we\nshould feel insecure\nand i have the additional aspect of like\neveryone's like your whole value\nis to be attractive and you should try\nto be attractive but if you feel\nattractive will hate you and that's\nunattractive so you have to be\nattractive\nand you have to be awesome and perfect\nand have a great personality be fun\nlike computer games like me and do this\nand do that right and eat loads of food\nbut\nsimultaneously stay really slim i love a\nlot girl who eats so long as she's like\nanorexic\num so like there are loads of double\nstandards that are so hard to live up to\nit's so hard to feel like you're on the\nright track because people criticize you\nevery step of the way\nhow do you have good self-esteem and\nthen if you do manage to like something\nabout yourself\nyou hold on to it in a world that just\nhates you if you ever acknowledge it\nit's a very good question it's the right\nquestion which is more important\nbecause i think that applies to everyone\nhere i don't i barely know anyone who\ngenuinely is like [ __ ] yeah i'm awesome\ncan i think about that for a second it's\na hard question answer\nokay anita so i don't know if i can\nanswer the question generally but i\nthink i can answer it for you\nso the first thing is that i think\nyou're actually well on your way\nyou are walking the path that in my\nexperience leads to self-esteem\nwhich is in the first phase denial right\nlike\noh i'm not angry other people are more\nbetter than i am things like that i'm\ni'm using psychological terms that can\nbe judgmental but just a\nif you go back and watch our first\ninterview it was like i'm not worth it\nright and now you're saying something\nelse which is that i do deserve this and\nit's\nfrustrating that i'm not getting it\nand and to me you feel very different\ntoday than the first time we talked\nbecause you are so much more\ntransparently angry\nright which i think is actually great\nand i i think that\ni actually i i don't know how to say\nthis i think you're going to find your\nway there because you're saying\nall of the things that i think people\nneed to do because you're saying that\ni've been alone and i feel\nit's fantastic i get to be with myself i\nget to prioritize myself\nyou're building self-esteem with each\none of those steps\nyou're saying i'm going to do what i\nwant to do you're learning how to not\ngive in to other people's boundary\nviolations because they're not right for\nyou\nright because you used to let people\ntrample you and now you're like\nfrustrated because you tell them to go\n[ __ ] themselves and you end up with\nyou know terminating the relationship\nand then you feel really sad and\nfrustrated\nbut at least you're drawing that\nboundary right you can't draw that\nboundary\nunless you have some esteem for yourself\nbecause you used to put them ahead of\nyou and you just let them cross all over\nit\nbut you stopped doing that so i think\nthat the bizarre thing\nis you say how do i have self-esteem i\ndon't have it\nand this is the part of me where now i\nget to be real arrogant i think you have\nmore\nmore self-esteem than you realize it's\njust so [ __ ] foreign to you you don't\nknow what it looks like\ntrue it's not consistent yet there are\nstill people who cross my boundaries and\ni still flounder a bit it's not\nit's fully there yet i'm still\nstruggling\nbut i am i have an idea of like that\nthis is unacceptable\nand that's new so what i said is that\nyou're on the path\nright and i think if you keep doing what\nyou're doing\nyou'll get there right because i\ni have faith in the person who has\nbrought you this far\nbecause she's in your corner and she's\ncaring about you she learned how to care\nabout herself\nshe learned how to put herself above\nother people\nright and that person also willingly\nputs other people ahead of her\nit's not like a good thing or a bad\nthing like you can be genuinely\naltruistic it's totally fine\nand i i think that as you learn to\ncontinue to navigate yourself as you\nstart to look at your relationships more\nclosely\nas you start to navigate what agency you\ndo have in relationships\ni think that self-esteem will grow\nand you you still accept what i say\nabout you as a compliment you say\nthank you the question is do you believe\ni'm right\ni have a mental block there like i keep\ntrying to access the thought and it\nshuts down\nokay right so that's what we need to\nwork on\nyeah we'll work on it we'll work on it\nit takes time\nit takes time and if you can't accept it\nas true like sure i mean\nyou know that i accept that you don't\naccept it and i'm going to continue\nthinking that about you and i'm going to\ncontinue feeling that way about you\neven if you don't accept it for yourself\nwell thank you right because you don't\nget to control my feelings\ni get to feel about you the way that i\nwant to\nand you get to respond to that however\nyou want to you get to say\ni'm never going to talk to you again\nbecause it makes me uncomfortable and\nyou get to do that that's your line in\nthe sand to draw\nwell thanks well at the very least\nyou've identified the\nbits because usually these mental blocks\nwhere every time i try to access the\nthought it doesn't let me\ni've had that before you start having\nwith anger things like that\num or i'm telling you yeah go ahead i'm\nsorry\nno tell me dude you feeling angry is\nlike i'm so happy for you\nand even i'm telling it's it's coming\nout you got to clean out that trash\nright you got to take it out of the\ntrash can\nand it'll come out and you you're\nentitled to that anger because you've\nhad to deal with this [ __ ] for so long\nand let you know just let like feel that\nbaby just feel it\nand let yourself be wronged because\nthat's what's happened\nright but you can't know that you're\nbeing wronged unless you\non some level know that you deserve the\nright\nand so that seed of self-esteem is\nalready there\na lot of people blame women in abusive\nrelationships why didn't you leave and\nit's like\nif if people are raised to never know\nthat they can expect respect or what\nrespect looks like\nhow do they even know they're being\nwronged a lot of people in abusive\nrelationships don't know\nthat it's wrong and so yeah\nso i think yeah you're right there and i\ni think\nyeah it's a hard place place to be this\nis really difficult to do live there are\nlots of people who get like a tiny\nsnippet of the conversation and let them\nbuy it\nfill in the rest they like arrive for\nlike two minutes and they judge\nthere are lots of armed chairs\npsychologists who come up with [ __ ]\nlots of sexist [ __ ] about men like\nmen just can't be friends with women and\nwomen are this and men can't be that too\nlike i believe in men men can be decent\npeople\nand friends and yeah no i i don't have\nthis awful stereotype that men can't be\nfriends with women and [ __ ] i\ni wouldn't be friends with men if i\nthought that it was a thing that they\nwere just too\nprimal to do so like i think i have a\nlittle bit more faith in men than twitch\nchat does but i'm still being called\nlots of awful things like a man hater\nright now which is very odd it's so\ndifficult to have these sorts of\nconversations live i'm getting so much\njudgment\nand it's so funny like it'll bounce\nbetween she's so wrong she doesn't\nunderstand basic biology and there'll be\npeople\ngoing could you fart for me between it\nall\nit takes a lot of practice to be very\ncalm and kind of\num indifferent to all of the weird\nweirdness of twitch jet so any of the\nlast thing i'll leave you with\nis that i want i commend you for\nhaving this conversation right it's an\nimportant conversation that the haters\nare gonna hate\nwhatever but i think that there are a\nlot of people out there who are really\nlistening\nand hearing something that they need to\nhear\nsecond thing is i want you to cut\nyourself some slack\nif those people get to you\nright because it is hard to deal with\nand you deserve to not be perfect\nyou deserve to feel judged you deserve\nto feel weak\nyou deserve to feel all of those things\neven if they aren't true i don't think\nthey're true\nbut social media and the internet does\nthat to us they make us feel small and i\nthink one of the biggest problems that\nwe\nrun into is that we judge ourselves for\nbeing weak when we're allowed to be weak\nand so we beat ourselves up for letting\nthem affect us\nand then suddenly we're on the same team\nwith them\nthey're beating us up and we're beating\nourselves up so don't be on that team\nand if you are on that team that's okay\nthat's just how we're conditioned\nyeah good luck to you thank you i feel\nlike we didn't get enough time to answer\npeople's questions\ni'm sorry yeah i know i i i'm i know we\ndidn't get enough time and i'm so glad\nbecause i i think that this conversation\ni don't know how other people are what\nother people are going to think about it\nbut\ni think your your growth has been really\nremarkable\nand and i mean you may not see it you\nmay not feel it i know that you're\nfeeling\npotentially more negative emotion than\nthe first time we met but like it's just\npart of the journey\nright because now you know you're angry\nbecause you deserve more than what\npeople are giving you\nand that like that's the [ __ ] essence\nof self-esteem\nwhen you know what you're worth anger is\na hopeful emotion it's when you don't\nstand for how things are and you hope\nthat they can be better i mean\nanger would be useless but anger if it\nwasn't that\nanger is why women have the right to\nvote anger is why\nso many slaves were freed like anger is\nwhen we\ndon't like how things are and we want it\nto change i understand that it's a\npositive thing when used\nmaturely i i was writing off everything\nevery bit of anger as\nimmature and i yeah i do think that\noh oddly anger is something people\ndeserve to feel not in a malicious way i\ndon't feel like you deserve to be angry\nfool\ni mean you know yeah like the way you\nsaid it i think you said it's beautiful\npeople deserve to feel\nvulnerable and angry and all those\nthings they have the right\nyou made me cringe a little bit i hope\nyou let yourself be angry in an immature\nway too\n[Laughter]\ndon't be a perfect version of yourself\ntrue true yeah okay i'm glad you called\nthat one yeah just it's you gotta be\ncareful\nyeah yeah you get to be inappropriately\nangry you get to just have a bad day\nbecause people are mistreating you and\ntake it out on other people you should\napologize afterward but you get to feel\nthat way\ni'll try not to either yeah try not to\ntry not to but don't beat yourself up if\nyou slip up from time to time\nbecause it's a process it's a journey\ncool\nyeah definitely i'm sorry if i did that\nwith you i mean i'm under a lot of\npressure right now there are thousands\nof people blaming me for the situation\ni'm in right now\nso it felt like a little bit much but i\nhope you didn't feel disrespected during\nthis conversation\nbecause i have a lot of respect for you\nno i didn't feel disrespected in fact\ni'm really really glad\nthat you shared that with me\nbecause anita telling me that i did\nsomething\nthat was not fair or judgmental is not\ndisrespectful\nthis is my whole point you get to say\ni'm disrespectful if i'm disrespectful\nand i have to listen to that\nright it's not like i can't [ __ ] up\nlike you get to say that\nyou get to say dr k you're being an\n[ __ ]\nyou're being judgmental and then we sit\ndown and we look at\nlike what's going on there like you get\nto say that man\nwoman sorry yes\nall right anyway i really enjoyed this\ngood luck to you good luck on your\njourney\nthank you and thanks a lot and you know\nhaters are going to hate i don't know\nwhat to say\nthere are a lot of us out there who are\nalso rooting for you so\nthank you send the haters our way we try\nto talk to them and see where they're\ncoming from\nthank you cool good luck take care\nyou too\nyou"
