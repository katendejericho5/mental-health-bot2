    "transcript": "today is november 9th which means our\ncoaching program is now live\neven though our program isn't designed\nto treat depression or anxiety our\nclients experience about a 15 to 20\nreduction in depression and about a 15\nto 16\nreduction in anxiety for more\ninformation or to sign up check out the\nlink below\nhey guys dr k here now i want to talk a\nlittle bit about anxiety and hopefully\nhelp you all understand a little bit\nmore about\nwhat is anxiety how does it actually\nfunction\nand once we understand what it is and\nwhat it's supposed to be doing we can\nstart to get a sense of how to overcome\nit\nso anxiety is essentially our brain's\ncapacity to predict\ndanger and warn us about it it gives us\nthe opportunity to look into the future\nsee or anticipate problems therefore we\ncan take corrective actions now\nto prevent bad outcomes that's\nessentially what anxiety is\nconsider being worried about looking\nstupid at a party\nor afraid that you're going to fail a\ntest or being afraid that you're going\nto get rejected from a job interview\nall of these things are examples of our\nmind looking into the future\nexamining things analyzing things and\nwarning us about danger so that we can\ndo something about it\nand so essentially what happens when our\nmind worries is it's making predictions\nof bad outcomes in the future\nin a hope that it can warn us about it\nwe can kind of do something to correct\nor prevent it so anxiety is essentially\nour ability to see\nproblems and consider consequences\nanxiety is when our mind has thoughts of\nthe future\nusually associated with negative\nconsequences it involves predicting the\nimpact of current\nactions into the future and specifically\nhow\npainful the future will be if we in a\nparticular way now\nwe tend to talk about anxiety like an\nillness but if we look at the\nfundamental function of worry\nlet's not forget that most of the time\nworry isn't a bad thing it's actually a\ngood thing we're wired for it it's\nsomething that our brain is telling us\nto\nto do so let's try to unpack anxiety a\nlittle bit further and we're going to go\nthrough\ntwo examples kind of as we sort of\nanalyze anxiety\nand those two examples are going to be\nbeing afraid of looking dumb\nor offending people at a party or being\nafraid that what we're going to do\npoorly on a test\nso the first thing that we need to look\nat is both of these examples\ninvolve you right so anxiety involves\nthinking about you and the consequences\nthat\nyou may or may not take usually\nyou start with yourself and you look\ninto the future the reason you do this\nis you try to figure out all the\npossible\nsolutions to prevent bad outcomes\nand so anxiety tends to focus on some\nkind of insecurity\noftentimes with you but it could be an\ninsecurity about someone else\nyour sense of your own capability or\nwhat you're not good at\nso in the case of looking dumb or\noffending people you may not have\nconfidence in yourself as a person\nsomewhere along the way you discover\nthat people may not like you very much\nor that the only time they like you is\nif you kind of put on a particular mask\nor you put on a show\nand that they they like that version of\nyou but not the real version of you\nyou may believe that you're just not as\nas charismatic as other people\nyou may find yourself comparing yourself\nto a lot of other people\nbut at the end of the day there's an\ninsecurity about your likability as a\nperson\nin the case of studying you may be\nafraid of failing or\nfear that you haven't studied enough you\nmay recognize that other people can be\nconfident once again there's going to be\ncomparison there\nbut something just makes you worried\nthat you're not going to do good enough\nor you're afraid of doing good enough or\nyou're afraid of being good enough\nsometimes people consider anxiety as\nstemming from the past\nnow i sort of say that anxiety is the\nfuture focused mind\nbut people will say but i have anxiety\nabout the past let's just tunnel down\ninto that tangent for a second\npeople will say oh i messed up last\nnight and if people\nyou know people are gonna dislike me\ntoday because i was dumb\nyesterday at the party or yesterday in\nclass i asked a stupid question\nso now everyone is gonna think i'm\nstupid and so they pause for a second\nand they kind of look back and they say\noh i made a mistake yesterday i'm\nanxious about that\nbut if you really look at it what\nthey're doing is they're looking at an\nevent in the past\nand they're still projecting the\nconsequences into the future\nso all anxiety involves looking into the\nfuture\nand even though you can be worried about\nsomething that happened in the past if\nyou\nreally pay attention what you're what\nyou're really looking at is you're\nworried about the consequences\nthat could evolve from actions that\nhappen in the past\nso we see that anxiety is about\npredicting possible problems that\narise and now we get into another\ninteresting tidbit about anxiety is that\nsince anxiety is about making\npredictions the smarter you are the more\ncomputing power you have to make\npredictions\nand this is really really unfortunate\nbecause what i find time and time again\nas a clinician\nis that the smarter you are the worse or\nmore crippling your anxiety can be\nthe more that your mind is able to\ncompute potential futures the more\npotential problems that your mind will\ntell you to worry about\nand so it's really unfortunate but\ngenerally speaking the smarter you are\nthe worse your anxiety is and so now\nthat we kind of sort of\ndug into a little bit about the you\ncomponent of anxiety\nlet's look at what the mind does with\nresponding to anxiety\nso what does the mind do when we\nactually experience anxiety\nhow do we deal with these worries in the\nfuture the short answer is that\nuncertainty is really frightening so\nwhat we try to do is to remove the\nuncertainty\nmost of anxiety involves an if then sort\nof statement so we see the then portion\nso if i say this then people are going\nto think this right if i go to the party\nand i speak up people are going to\ndislike me\nif i don't study enough i'm going to\nfail the test and so\nit's kind of like an if then statement\nand so what we try to do is we try to\nfix\nthe then right we try to alleviate\nour anxiety by essentially controlling\nsomething in the future\nand we may think a little bit about\novercompensating\nso let's take the example of you know i\ncracked a joke about someone and maybe\nthey're upset\nby it let me just apologize just in case\neven if you\ndidn't say anything offensive a lot of\ntimes people with with anxiety are so\nconcerned about it that they'll\novercompensate\nand try to control that future in the\nevent that this person is offended\nlet me remove that uncertainty and just\napologize just in case\nthe other thing that we try to do to\nsort of control the future\nor remove the uncertainty is to not\ntrigger it at all right so if we avoid\nthe situation entirely\nthen we can control any potential\nnegative outcomes that happen\nso if i don't even show up at the party\ni can't misspeak\ni won't people won't think i'm stupid\nand so how about i just don't go\ni can control that worry completely by\navoiding the situation\nentirely and for people who are worried\nabout failing a test\nthey'll study extra hard because we're\nthey're so afraid of failing\nand so they kind of do as much as they\ncan to control the uncertainty of the\nfuture\nby sort of changing something in the\nhere and now\nand this may sound like sort of a good\nthing in a sense right like if i'm\nstudying\nextra for a test like isn't that a good\nthing the problem is that oftentimes our\nsolutions for anxiety our desire to\nexert control\nis very restrictive and actually causes\nus to suffer\nso if we think about the social example\nlike sure if i don't go to the party\nyou know no one can think i'm dumb\nbecause i'm not there but then i never\ngo to parties\nand so i actually narrow the scope of my\nlife and i start to restrict\nthe kind of things that i can do and\neven in the case of studying we're so\nparanoid that that\nwe're going to fail a test that we skip\nparties or social events or don't hang\nout with friends\nor we stay up way too late or we wake up\nway early in the morning\nwe miss out on a lot of fun that you can\nhave when you're a student\nby studying way too hard and this is the\nreally damnable thing which is that\nanxiety oftentimes has positive benefits\nlet's not forget that anxiety is\nactually there for a reason and the\nreason it exists is because generally\nspeaking it helps us out\nso for example if you look at medical\nstudents\na lot of medical students have high\nlevels of anxiety and that's part of the\nreason they got into medical school in\nthe first place\nbecause when everyone was out partying\nthey were the ones who were on a friday\nnight\nat 10 p.m in the library studying for a\ntest\nand so even though it the event anxiety\ncould be\nadvantageous for us at times generally\nspeaking we want to be really careful\nbecause if we give into it and we try to\ncontrol those\nuncertainties it actually restricts us\nor causes us to suffer\neven though it may give us some kind of\nmaterial advantage in life\nthe other issue is that oftentimes with\nanxiety since we're so\nconcerned we actually end up over\ncompensating which can make the problem\nworse\nright so if we're concerned that people\ndon't like us and we apologize to\nprofusely\nthen what can happen is we can actually\nbe kind of annoying and make people not\nlike us because we're afraid\nor we're trying to fix the fact that\nwe're they don't like us that creates a\nreally dangerous loop\ni'm afraid someone doesn't like me let\nme apologize\nsince i'm apologizing too much and\ninappropriately\ni annoy them and then they end up not\nliking me right it's this\nweird self-fulfilling prophecy or\nvicious cycle\nand so it's our solution to the anxiety\nthat actually causes our suffering\nmakes our life a little bit more\nrestricted and actually creates problems\nand the last really really sad and\nunfortunate thing about anxiety is that\nsometimes if we give into it other\npeople can take advantage of our\ninsecurity\nso if you if you are super anxious\nsometimes you can behave a little bit\nlike a doormat right you're apologizing\nall the time\nand sometimes you're going to run across\npeople who never want to\nadmit that they did anything wrong and\nso they're more than happy to have\nsomeone around\nwho is always apologizing for\nthings that aren't their fault makes it\na super convenient bearing\nso it can be really dangerous because\nsometimes our anxiety\nresults in people taking advantage of us\nand so how do we deal with this right so\nsure we've got this issue of okay\nanxiety is our mind\nour predictive capability focusing\non particular problems in the future\nbased on our on\na sense of uncertainty and insecurity\nusually in ourselves\nso what do we do about that right so i'm\ninsecure in myself and i'm predicting\nall these problems and i'm a smart\nperson so i\nmake a lot of predictions and then i try\nto control that uncertainty by\navoiding parties or restricting what i\ndo so how do we break out of this what\ndo we do about it\nthe first thing to understand is that\nanxiety is literally the mind thinking\nin the future\nif we can bring the mind to the present\nit's it's literally impossible to be\nanxious i know it sounds completely\ncrazy\nbut if you look at the experience of\nanxiety your mind\nis thinking about the future and so\nanytime you're thinking about the\npresent or focused in the present\nyou can't be anxious good examples of\nthis are like let's say you take a bath\nor like a nice hot shower\nand if you're immersed in the experience\nof taking the shower or the bath\nyou won't be thinking about other things\nand you can't experience\nanxiety and we deal with anxiety in all\nkinds of ways by bringing our mind to\nthe present some of these can actually\nbe harmful but we can\nsee this in things like games or\nwatching videos or watching tv shows or\nmovies\nor even substances when we play video\ngames for example like our mind stops\nthinking\nin that future and starts focusing on\nthe game and then what happens to our\nanxiety it melts away\nif we get engrossed in a tv show or\nsomething like that\nthen once again we're not thinking in\nthe future and we're not thinking about\nourselves we're thinking about something\nelse\nand so the anxiety falls away sometimes\npeople will use substances like\nmarijuana or alcohol and those certainly\nhelp with anxiety as well\nand how do they help with it they sort\nof keep our mind it's a biological\nsubstance that helps our mind focus a\nlittle bit more in the present\nright and so i'm not advising that these\nthings are actually good in fact i think\nall three of these are poor choices to\ndeal with anxiety\nbut let's try to map out a full spectrum\nof how we do deal with anxiety and then\nwe can sort of\nstart to shift gears a little bit\ntowards healthier methods of coping with\nanxiety\nso the key thing still remains that\nanxiety literally cannot exist\nif you're not thinking about the future\nand\na good example of this is sometimes\npeople will have you know anxiety about\nlet's say going to a party or failing a\ntest\nand if you really look at people's\nexperience once they sit down and they\nstart to study right once you get\nengrossed in the act of studying\nthen the anxiety sort of melts away once\nyou actually show up to the party and\nyou stop kind of thinking about it and\nyou start engaging with people\nfor those of you that are a little bit\nlucky and can focus in those\nexperiences then the anxiety disappears\nright we can also use like stage anxiety\nor performance anxiety\nis a good example that you're really\nreally worried when you go up on stage\nbut once you actually get up on stage\nhopefully you start to feel way better\nanother great example of that is jumping\ninto a cold swimming pool\nwhere before you jump into the water oh\nmy god oh my god it's gonna be so cold\nit's gonna be so cold it's gonna be so\ncold it's paralyzing you\nbut once you actually jump into the\nwater generally speaking the anxiety was\nfar more paralytic\nthan the reality of jumping into the\nwater\nand so if we can sort of engage in the\nactivity\nthen the anxiety will actually start to\nmelt away\nso the second thing to kind of think\nabout so just to summarize you know if\nwe can bring our mind to the present if\nwe can actually go ahead\nand jump in the water if we can engage\nin an activity\nif we can move away from the future if\nwe can train our mind\nto focus in the present then anxiety\nliterally cannot exist\nstaggering okay the next thing to think\nabout\nis that remember anxiety is rooted in\nsome kind of insecurity\nright so if we think about the cases in\nwhich we're not anxious\nso you may not be anxious hanging out\nwith your dog well\nwhy is that it's because you know you\nhave confidence that your dog likes you\nas a person\nif you think about even like playing a\ncompetitive video game\nwhy aren't you anxious when you go into\nthe game it's because you have\nconfidence in your skill\nin the video game even that you may win\nor you may lose but you're kind of\nconfident with your ability to face that\nuncertainty\nit's kind of weird right because in a\ngame you don't really know whether\nyou're going to win you don't know\nwhether you're going to lose but you\nhave faith in yourself or your skill in\nthe game\nand so therefore you can face that\nuncertainty\nso the second big way to focus on or fix\nanxiety is not just to kind of bring the\nmind to the present but it's to focus on\nthe insecurity itself\nand what do i mean by that it's to\ndevelop confidence\nso let's think about what confidence\nreally means\nso confidence is literally believing\nthat you have the capacity\nto deal with the unknown and\nlet's kind of think about that for a\nsecond right because if we think about\nhow anxiety functions\nnormally what we do is there's\nuncertainty in the future\nand so what we try to do is we try to\ncontrol that uncertainty right\nwe don't face the uncertainty we try to\nremove the uncertainty\nand so every time that you remove the\nuncertainty you\nlose the chance to build confidence\nbecause confidence comes from\nwhen you face something and overcoming\nthe challenge not\ntaking the challenge away and so a lot\nof our solutions to our anxiety\nabout controlling our future actually\nprevent us from developing the\nconfidence that we need to really\novercome anxiety\nand i know this sounds absolutely crazy\nbut when we start to control\ncertain circumstances of our life we\nactually make our anxiety worse\nbecause we decrease our confidence\nbecause we're never actually facing\nanything\nwe just avoid playing the game entirely\nand so the other big solution really is\nto\nsort of learn how to develop some\nconfidence and we can go into more\ndetail with that down the road\nbut essentially resolve that personal\ninsecurity that you have um and then as\nyou resolve that personal insecurity\nyou're able to face\nuncertainty without needing to control\nit\nand when you don't need to control your\nlife then your life becomes\nless restrictive and you become more\nfree\nso to summarize anxiety is essentially\nthe future focused mind\nthat revolves around a particular\ninsecurity\nand the smarter you are the more\nproblems you begin to see\nout in the future and generally speaking\nwhat people do with anxiety is they\nthey try to distract themselves or they\ntry to control\ntheir future they try to remove\nuncertainty from the equation\nand so generally speaking what we want\nto do is be really really careful\nbecause a lot of our solutions\nfor anxiety actually make our anxiety\nworse\nand what we want to wind up doing\ninstead is actually learn how to focus\nour mind in the present\nright so if we can bring our mind to the\ntask at hand\nthen anxiety literally can't exist\nbecause anxiety by definition is us\nthinking about the future\nso you can unplug into anxiety entirely\nby focusing on the present\nthe second thing that you can do is\ndevelop confidence\nin relation to your insecurities and\nwhat that\nhelps us do is the more confident we\nbecome the more that we can face the\nuncertainty of anxiety\nbecause remember anxiety is if then\nstatements if happens then what am i\ngoing to do\nif this happens then what am i going to\ndo this happens in what i'm going to do\nand if you become confident yourself\nyou're like okay if that happens\ni'll handle it if this happens we'll\ncross that bridge when we come to it\nand if i offend someone and they don't\nlike me well then they don't like me and\nif i did something wrong i'll apologize\nand if i didn't then no big deal\nnot everyone has to like me terrifying\nthoughts for someone\nwith anxiety but our goal here is to try\nto help you guys learn a little bit more\nabout\nanxiety and a little bit more about how\nto develop these solutions\nso that you can ultimately conquer it\nand it doesn't have to plague you\nall the time so i hope that was helpful\nthanks for listening\nand adios from dr k\nyou"
