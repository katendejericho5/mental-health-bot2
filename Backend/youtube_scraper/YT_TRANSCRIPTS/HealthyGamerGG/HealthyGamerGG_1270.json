    "transcript": "hey guys before the video starts i just\nwanted to let y'all know that our coach\nprogram is actually expanding\nthreefold coaches are all personally\ntrained by me and are there to help you\nwith problems like procrastination\nmotivation depression anxiety and\nhelping you get unstuck\nso check out the first link in the\ndescription below\nhey guys i'm dr oliver konoja i'm a\npsychiatrist and co-founder of healthy\ngamer\nand we're on a quest to help the\ninternet with its mental health\nso today i want to talk to you guys with\nabout something really important it's\none of the things that keeps people sort\nof stuck\nin failure and that's a principle called\nmoving goal posts\nso one of the damnedest things that we\ndo to ourselves is that a lot of times\nanytime we succeed we actually our mind\ndoes this little flip that turns\nsuccess into a failure and i call that\nprinciple moving goal posts\nso a lot of times you know we'll set\ngoals for ourselves right we feel like a\nfailure because we're\num maybe we're out of shape or\nyou know we don't wake up on time or\nthings like that and then our mind does\nsomething really really tricky when we\ntry to make a change\nso what will actually end up happening\nis we will make a change at some point\nright one day you'll eat something\nhealthy\nand then instead of viewing that as\nsuccess success our mind does something\nreally tricky if we eat a salad for\nlunch\nour mind does this really slippery thing\nis that it tell\nit tells us oh we should have done this\na long time ago\nwhy didn't we start sooner right and oh\nnow we're going to start eating eating\nhealthy every day so our mind takes\none success and it turns it into a\nfailure just think about that right\nand it does it in two ways the first\nthing is that we beat ourselves up for\nnot doing it earlier\neven though we're taking a step in the\nright direction instead of being\ninspired by it instead of being\nmotivated by it\ninstead of giving ourselves a pat on the\nback what do we do\nwe beat ourselves up and so bizarrely we\nturn\nour success we turn this positive energy\nin this good thing in our life that oh\nwe ate healthy today\nand we turn it into a failure we\ntransform it into a failure about the\npast oh i should have been\neating healthy my entire life and watch\nwhat your mind does it's tricky right\nand so it takes positive energy and\nturns it into negative energy\nthe second thing that we do that sort of\ndestines us for failure\nis that we take a success and then we\nmove the goal posts\nwe say oh i ate healthy today now i'm\ngoing to eat healthy tomorrow\nthe goal that you woke up with today was\nto eat\nhealthy today it's not to eat healthy\nfor the next week\nor the next month or the next year it\nwas a small goal\nand you can accomplish a small goal you\ncan take one step at a time\nbut our mind does the damnedest little\nthing which is that it takes\na success and moves the goal posts on us\nright\nand then we destin ourselves for failure\nso we say okay i ate healthy today now\ni'm gonna eat healthy the entire week\nand that's not something that you're\nreally capable of right because what can\nyou actually do you can eat healthy\nmaybe one meal but when you the second\nthat you have one success\nyou move the goal posts on yourself and\nyou set yourself\nup for a success or for a failure that\nbecause the success that you\nwant is not really going to be feasible\nright you take taking one step forward\nand then suddenly you expect so much\nmore from yourself you take the concept\nof your success and then you move the\ngoal posts you change\nthe way you define success okay i ate\nhealthy today\nnow i have to eat healthy for the entire\nweek\nand that too transforms your success\ninto a failure\nso stop moving the goal posts on\nyourself be really really careful\nbecause this is what leads to a life\nwhere you feel like a failure every day\nthe crazy thing about this is that\nyou're not a failure every day\nyou guys are actually succeeding all the\ntime\nthe problem is that you won't let\nyourself sit with that success\nyou won't let yourself give yourself a\npat on the back all that ends up\nhappening is that you move the goal\nposts on yourself and you expect so much\nmore than you're capable of\nright instead of focusing and practicing\nand getting better at eating healthy\ntoday\nthe second you eat healthy today you\nexpect so much more of yourself tomorrow\nand the next day in the next day and\nthen what happens is you inevitably fail\nand when you\nfail comes all the shame comes all the\ndisappointment comes all the oh i can't\nyou know i i'm lazy i'm undisciplined i\ndon't have any willpower\nlook at all those people out there that\nare so much better than i am\ni wish i was disciplined enough to eat a\nsalad every day\nno my friend that's not what you should\nwish what you should wish is exactly\nwhat you've accomplished which is that\ni wish every now and then i could eat a\nsalad\nbecause if that's the goal post that you\nset for yourself and you don't let\nyourself move it\nyou can succeed and then you become a\ndifferent person\nyou become someone who succeeds\nsometimes and fails sometimes\nwhich is a wildly different thing from\nsomeone who fails all the time\nand why do you fail all the time because\nyou keep on moving goalposts on yourself\nand so then we have to we have to beg\nthe question why do we do that\nwhy do we move the goalposts it's\nbecause of all of that negative\nperception\nthat we have to balance right if i view\nmyself as a complete\nfailure if i view myself as someone who\nfails all the time\nthe only success that will balance that\nis a huge success\nit's not good enough if i'm 300 pounds\noverweight\nit's not good enough to eat a salad one\nday a week it's just not\ngood enough and that's what we tell\nourselves right because we have this\nperception that we're\nso overweight or that we're so much of a\nfailure that we have to balance it with\na big success it's the\nonly way to make up for how bad of a\nperson you are is you have to have an\nastronomic success if you dropped out of\ncollege you can't\nfinish community college you've got to\ngo to harvard right\nyou got to balance that success because\nyou feel like such a failure\nthere's got to be a huge success\notherwise it's not enough\nand so when we eat healthy for a day we\nsay i gotta eat healthy for a month\nbecause i have 300 pounds to lose eating\none\neating healthy one day a week is not\ngoing to give me the success that i\nneed to be where i want to go\nand so we move the goal posts because\nwe've got to make up for lost time right\nwe've got to make up for it because\nwe're such a failure\nand why do we have to move the goal post\nbecause we view ourselves as such a\nfailure\nso what happens when we start to see\nourselves as instead of a complete\nfailure\nsomeone who succeeds sometimes and fails\nsometimes\nif you start to see yourself that way\nthen suddenly you don't have to move the\ngoal posts as well\nright you don't have to be an absolute\nsuccess\nbecause you're successful half of the\ntime you only have to you only have to\nmove the goal posts a little bit\nmore you don't have to move them a huge\namount you just have to move a little\nbit more\nand then something magical happens\nbecause the less you start moving the\ngoal posts\nthe more successful you become and the\nmore successful you become\nthe more your identity changes\nto no longer being a failure and the\nless of a failure you feel about\nyourself\nthe less you move your goal posts the\nless you move your goal posts\nthe more successful you become the more\nyou view yourself as a success\nand the less you have to move your goal\nposts\nyou guys feel stuck in a cycle of\nfailure\nand that absolutely sucks and don't get\nme wrong it is a cycle\nright because with each failure more\nshame you have to make it up more\neach year that goes by that you fall\nmore and more behind\nthe more miraculous you have to be to\nmake up for lost time\nif you're 24 years old you just have to\nmake up for a couple of years\nif you're 28 years old you have to make\nup for so much more time\nif you're past your 30s now you have to\nreally do something miraculous to turn\nthings around\nand so the bigger gap you create for\nyourself the more of a failure you feel\nlike\nand then the more of a failure you\nbecome because the\nthe goal posts have moved so far that\nthere's no human way there's no\nplausible way that you can actually\nsucceed you destine yourself for failure\nso it is absolutely a vicious cycle and\nthe question is how to break it\nand the good news is that the vicious\ncycle works\nboth ways if you can start to\nto take one step forward and be\nsatisfied with it\nright if you can take one step forward\nand not move the goal posts\nand you can say you know what i did a\ngood job today\nat the end of the day today is a day\nthat i actually ate healthy\ntoday is a day where i may be 300 pounds\noverweight\nbut i know at the end of today i'm not\n301 pounds overweight\nif you can give yourself one success and\nthen not move the goal posts\nthen you shift your perspective about\nyourself the more you shift your\nperspective the less you move the goal\nposts\nthe easier it is to succeed and then the\nmore you shift your perspective\nand then eventually you become the\nperson that you want to be\nyou become the person that you see and\nyou envy\nyou become the person that other people\nenvy\nthey look at you and they say man that\nperson is disciplined\nthat person isn't lazy and the crazy\nthing\nis that you are exactly the same thing\nthat you used to be\nthe only difference is what you do in\nhere the only difference is that you\nperceive yourself\nto not be a failure anymore because you\ndon't actually fail all the time\nno one fails all the time it feels that\nway\nbut you don't actually fail all the time\nand then what you focus on is okay\ni ate healthy today i ate healthy today\nand i ate unhealthy for the next five\ndays\nthis week i'm gonna see if i can do one\nday a week of eating healthy\nand then you can do that right and then\nthe next day next week now here comes\nthe tricky thing what do you do the next\nweek\ndo you bump it up to two days a week no\nno no that's moving the goal post\nthe next week you say let's see if we\ncan do it again\nlet's see if we can eat healthy one day\na week\nand then the next week do you move it to\ntwo days no no no\nstill one day a week and something\nreally magical starts to happen because\nif you stop moving the goal posts\neven though you set your target at one\nday a week\nyou'll start to eat healthy more you'll\nstart to be inspired and then you'll say\noh wow i actually\nate healthy three days a week today\nthat's crazy\ni better eat healthy three days next\nweek no no no\nthen you go to two be careful about\nmoving the goalposts\nthe second you start to expect\nyourself to be perfect every day the\nsecond you start to expect\nmore from yourself than you're capable\nof is the second you doom yourself to\nfailure\nand so acknowledge where you are and do\nthe best that you can today\nand set low expectations for yourself\ninstead of correcting for all of the\ncrap that you've had to deal with in the\npast instead of making up for lost time\nbecause it's hard right\nyou can't lose 300 pounds in a week but\nthat's sure as hell what you feel like\nyou\nhave to do so don't give in to that\ndon't move the goal posts on yourself\nexpect more from your less from yourself\nlet yourself be worse than you are and\nlet yourself be successful at taking\ntiny steps\nthere's no shame in eating healthy for\none day\ncreate that shame in our mind by moving\nour gulpos it isn't enough\ni should have done it a long time ago\nright so be careful\nand something magical will happen if you\nsee yourself moving those goal posts and\nyou don't let yourself do it because you\nhave to catch yourself doing it first in\norder to stop it\nand the less you move your goal posts\nthe more your life is going to turn\nin a positive direction and that's going\nto be a vicious cycle too and that's\nwhat happens with people who lose 300\npounds\nit's a vicious cycle of positivity\ninstead of a vicious cycle of negativity\nand that vicious cycle is born out of\nnot letting yourself move the goalposts\nso i hope that this little tidbit and\nthis little insight\ninto why you're doomed for failure why\nyou're destined to failure helps you\nbecause it really does help\nas you start to see this stuff happen in\nyour mind you can see how you work as a\nperson\nand you can start to make changes in\nyour life and if you guys like this kind\nof stuff if it is helpful to you\nlet us know by liking or subscribing or\ncommenting\nand the more that we hear from you about\nlike what's helpful and what isn't\nthat's how we know what to do so thanks\na lot for listening guys i'm dr k from\nhealthy gamer and\ngood luck and don't let yourself move\nyour goal posts\nyou"
