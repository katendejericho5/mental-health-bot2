    "transcript": "so a couple of quick announcements so\nwe're starting our coaching program\ni mean sorry our coaching program has\nbeen full for a couple of weeks now\num we're releasing a bunch of spots on\nnovember 9th\num for those of you guys who don't know\nwhat our coaching program is\nso it's not a medical treatment right so\nif we think about\nmedical treatment is like\nanti-depression right like that's what\nthe medications are called\nantidepressants coaching is like sort of\npro happiness or like\npro moving forward in life so it's not\nnecessarily about fixing what's broken\nit's more about getting unstuck getting\nunparalyzed\nworking on your motivation thinking\nabout understanding your emotions and\nwhat holds you back\ndigging into problematic behaviors like\nclinginess\nor like other kinds of like self\nconceptions that you have that\nprevent you from moving forward a good\nexample is like if i can't get into\nharvard i'm not gonna apply to college\nlike that sort of thinking right\nwhere we want to help you guys\nunderstand that and help you take a step\nforward\nand so that's really what our coaching\nprogram is about it turns out that our\ncoaching program does actually happen to\nimprove\ndepression and anxiety and it's not like\na direct clinical effect it's more\nthrough helping people live build\nand live like more fulfilling lives and\nthen depression and anxiety just start\nto get better\nas you start to build confidence about\nyourself that's what our coaching\nprogram's about\nhow you doing man good i woke up with\nthese two lines under my eyes i can't\ntell if they're wrinkles or i slept\nwrong\ntake a look at these things you see that\non my right eye\nwhat do you mean the bagginess under the\nright eye yeah maybe you're right i\ncan't see where i'm poked well here\nlet me see can y'all see yeah this\nyo look at these things yeah these\nwrinkles like am i permanently going to\nhave these\nno not necessarily so bagginess under\nthe eye could be um actually a sign of\nlike inflammation right so if you've got\nallergies for example um\ni mean it could be a wrinkle but usually\nthat looks like your eyes are puffy\nyeah that just it just happened this\nmorning i woke up\nand it was there do you have allergies\nyeah yeah i do so are they bad at this\ntime of year\nlike usually cedar fever you're in\naustin right\nyeah yeah yeah so cedar fever can get\nbad during this time of year\ndo you have are your allergies acted\nuh i don't know okay\nuh are they like telltale signs\nyeah so like stuffy nose you know\npost nasal drip stuff in your throat\nthings like that\num no i mean yeah i\ni wouldn't i wouldn't worry too much\nabout it train but if you're really\nconcerned and it persists you can always\ngo see a doctor\nwell you know i have\nlook at this wait can you see it no you\ncan't\noh look yeah look how many gray hairs i\nhave\nthe gray hairs are coming in do you see\nthis this is\ninsane i have so many gray hairs now i\nhave two wrinkles below my right eye\ni think i'm i'm getting old\nand how do you feel about that\nwell the hair part i kind of like\ni'm kind of i think i look good\nyeah it makes you look distinguished\nyeah i think in a gray\nmature yeah it would well mature\nnot mature mature i like that that's\nyeah\nthat could be oh my god i can make a\nbrand of clothing\nand make it more expensive and do like\nyou know\nthe ape gang merch mature and put an\napostrophe on one of the letters\nyeah you feel me beautiful yeah i i feel\nyou i mean that's you know\nyeah yeah wow but yeah the gray hair\nlook great people with black hair or\ndark hair call it mature\nand once you start turning gray it's\nmature\nmy tour i like that mature couture\nyeah there it is look at the ideas\nflowing\nlooks like mine's so sharp yeah\nmaybe i guess we'll see i just kind of\nuh\nyeah yeah damn hopefully yeah\ni think the eye thing is going to go\naway i've had you slept wrong yeah\ni think i'm pretty sure like i think i\nslept and that's actually an imprint of\nlike\nmaybe my sheets wrinkles i don't know\nbut maybe not\ni don't think it sheets wrinkles i think\nit's more likely to be like some\nlow level of inflammation or puffiness\nit looks like puffiness to me\nmore than anything else yeah my dad gets\nthat puffiness stuff so\nthat could be what it is yeah yeah\nso yeah um train what is there something\nin particular you want to talk about\ntoday i mean i know we\nwe've had a couple of conversations yeah\ni think this is like the uh\nin a way i guess this this may come off\nno i don't know but say it bro yeah\nperfect\nyeah i think uh this is like the\nthe memoirs yeah train wrecks tv you\nknow we have story one story two and now\nwe're on\nday three you know and one day it'll be\nday 100\nyou know and and you know like all human\nbeings\nwhen you know i yeah let's\ni don't know uh yeah yeah so\nyeah go ahead tell me about so so tell\nme about\nwhat you know where did we kind of leave\noff i know we sort of started talking\nabout your family a little bit but\nwhat are we going to discuss in in day\nthree\num we could i think i think we're going\nto get into the uh\ni think we're going to get into the\njuicy i think oh yeah i think we're\ngonna start into the\ni think we're gonna get deeper i think\nyou had asked last time at the end\nfor me to get into the like the bullying\nof school and then what led to drug use\nand then that's something i think that's\nwhere we left off\nright so yeah i think i think so too i\nwasn't sure exactly where we were going\nbut i remember that we had sort of been\nuh kind of like a little bit we done an\noverview\nand then we were going to kind of tunnel\ndown so can you tell me about the\nbullying\nwell before we go there we have to you\nknow kind of open the\nyou know we you know if we just go into\nit right\nnow i feel like it's going to be this\nvery cold thing\nfirst i got to ask you how have you been\ni've been\ndoing well man i think um so i like the\nweather\nyou know so i really like um i took like\na hour-long walk last night\nand it was just really nice um\ni think personally\n[Music]\nyou know it's interesting so i think\nwe've done a lot of good things\nand yet i find myself um\nnoticing a lot of problems in what we do\nso and i i mean i think this is good\nit's all progress but i i feel pretty\nexcited actually because i'm finally\ngetting to do\nsome of the things that i really wanted\nto do and what i mean by that is when\nyou know when i\nwhen we started streaming on twitch so i\nstarted working with rando gamers\nand then really enjoyed that and then\nstarted to notice themes\nright so okay these guys are like they\nthink they're all they all think they're\nlazy but they're actually not lazy\num so that's like a good example of one\neveryone thinks they lack motivation but\nthey don't\nlack motivation it's just plugged up and\nthey it can't shine through\nyes i think i think a lot can actually\napply to that i think uh\ni think there's a lot of things that the\ngeneral public\num kind of diagnoses streamers with\nnot realizing that it's it's not\nactually the case it's it's not like a\nresult of who they are it's more of a\nresult of\nthe streaming and and if you mix a\nstreaming in with any individual\nit'll happen to anybody even the most\nright like so a good example of that\nwould be\ni think for some reason everybody\nis a sociopathic narcissist on twitch\nand i i can maybe see to some certain\ndegree maybe\nlike but i don't think that's the case\nbut for some reason like the general\nviewer base likes to assert that\nthat like diagnosis onto like every\nstreamer\ndoes that make any sense and i've never\ni mean i understand it because i can see\nwhich ones\nmight be but the majority that they\ndiagnose\ni don't think are at all why do you\nthink yeah why do you think\nthey think that oh they say it i know\nbut but why do you think they say that\nwhy do you think they think that what do\nthey see that causes them or what\nwhat drives them to come to that\nconclusion they i think they see the uh\nso i think they see like a generalized\nsymptom but they don't realize that it\nyou know it's kind of like you know if\nyou get a\nlet's say you get a sinus infection\nright and you're getting like a\ntightening in your chest congestion\nright and\nyou decide to go to webmd and you type\nin\nchest uh chest tightness and congestion\nand then you know three results one says\nsinus infection\nand then two results say can you know\ncancer and then the other one says\nwhatever the [ __ ] right like for some\nreason people want to believe the more\nextreme ones\nyeah yeah something like that right so i\nthink it's just like they see like a\ngeneralized symptom\nand they just automatically attribute it\nto\nwhat's the symptom that they see i i\nthink it's a it's a good\nit's a really i think it's a frankly\nsophisticated\napproach i think oftentimes we confuse a\nsymptom with a diagnosis\num yeah and and so i'm with you that i\ndon't think that the majority of\nstreamers are sociopathic narcissists\noh no not at all i can't i've yeah i can\nsee\nhow by virtue of being a public figure\nyou exhibit some of the signs that\nnarcissists would\nexhibit right like there would be some\nsymptoms about\nyou know things like i mean\nself-promotion and like building a brand\nis like actually part of your job\nwhich can appear a lot like narcissism\nfor example\num yes but what do you what do you think\nit is that they see that makes them\nthink that it's like\nlike narcissists like what's the symptom\nthat\nwhat's the symptom that makes them\nassign that diagnosis i think the main\nsymptom that people confuse\nfor narcissism mainly is\nconfidence i think there is a huge\nhuge huge lack of confidence amongst the\ngeneral\nlike viewer that watches twitch and i\nthink\nas a gamer that they have they've set\nsome sort of\nsome sort of thing that every gamer\nneeds to be\nand if any gamer passes that threshold\nof confidence and they have to be a\nnarcissistic sociopath\nbut i i think they fail to like realize\nthat what you see you know the\nconfidence that you may see\nwhen they're in their environment of\nstreaming or gaming\nyou can't assume that that's their\neveryday state or every second state\nright like does that make any sense yeah\ni think people failed oh yeah go ahead\nyeah no go for it finish yourself i\nthink people i think people fail\nto consider like what happens off stream\nright like\nin that confidence in order to have true\nconfidence in my opinion\nyou have to have a level of awareness of\nyour own insecurities\nyou have to understand that they're\ngoing to be there always and that\nthey're\nthat they're there and everyone has them\nand\ni think that that's a big portion or\nthat's part that's a big part of the\nformula to get to a level of confidence\nit's\nit's it's accepting your insecurities\nand knowing that they're there and kind\nof just making peace with them\nbut i think some a lot of people that\nare more like inexperienced they think\nconfidence is not having any\ninsecurities\nwhich is just wrong in my opinion so\ndoes that make any sense yeah\nsort of um i i think uh i i find myself\nkind of being curious about your\npersonal experience as opposed to\nabstractions\nso when you say like they don't see what\nhappens off stream\nright so you're let me just lay out what\ni understand\nokay from what you're saying so you're\nsaying that\na lot of times people judge streamers\nfor being sociopathic narcissists\nthat the narcissism why do they think\nthat\nit's because they see something like\nconfidence\nand they kind of like confuse confidence\nand narcissism\nand that streamers don't i mean\nthe audience doesn't really account for\nwhat happens offstream in the streamer's\nlife which i completely\nunderstand but what i'm curious about is\nlike\nwhat happens offstream that as it\nrelates to this\nbucket of like narcissism and confidence\ni think the same thing that well not the\nsame exact thing but just relative to\neach person's life\ni think similar things that are\nhappening in every viewer's lives that\nthey they think the streamer doesn't see\nright i think the streamer's life is\nkind of like how\nwe view a an actor's life or a\nsports player's life or just these\ninstagram pictures of the happiest\ncouples lives i think\na lot of people make the mistake and\nthey see this loved streamer that's\nloved by many and\nthat's making so much money and you know\ntalking with such confidence but they\nthey failed to think about what's you\nknow all the intricacies and all the\n[ __ ] that's like they're what i'm trying\nto say is everyone's the same like all\nof us have our time where we're going\noff stream we're doubting ourselves\nwe're thinking did we make the right\ndecision did we not make the right\ndecision\ndid i do this well did i not do this\nwell right and that people don't realize\nthat\nwhen you're on camera sometimes you have\nto be strong\nfor the crew for the community right but\npeople\nmistaken that it's it's like it's like\nthey haven't thought\nfar enough to realize okay let's say he\ncomes on and he acts\nor and he is insecure and doubting and\nthis and this and that right\nnow the only people that that would make\nhappy are the ones that want to see you\nfail and need to see you in that state\nso you can't ever you can't ever uh\ncater to that\nbecause those people the fact they want\nto see you in that state\nthat's a reflection of their own\ninsecurity right they need to see you\nthere or below in order for themselves\nto feel better so they're not there for\nthe caring of you\nthey're there to find some sort of\nshort-term cure for themselves\nand then you have the other factor you\nneed to be strong for those of\nfor the ones that are weak right and\nthen those ones you're strong but then\nyou give this other effect off that\nyou're coming off as everything's great\nand\nyou know blah blah blah does that make\nany sense it's a\ni think one of them is the greater and\nthe other\ni don't know does that make any sense\nyep i think that the reason that it's a\nlose-lose is because at the end of the\nday you're being false\nyeah and i think a lot of people yeah i\nagree with you\nso the question that i have trained is\nlike\nwhy do you have to be strong for someone\nweak if that's not really what you are\nyou're almost implying that you know\nstrength is a mask that you put on for\nyour audience\nwhy can't you be weak\nyou can be but there's a time and place\nokay i mean\nhere's the thing\nhere's the thing okay hear me out here\nokay\nso\nthe way i go about it\nis a little different i think\ni just kind of wear my like\nyeah i kind of just wear my emotions on\nmy sleeve in a way\nkind of i'm a little closed off but i\ndon't know actually\nbut i definitely show like for me like i\nwas talking about like what i see\ngenerally for me for my stream i think i\nyou know when i'm feeling sad or down or\nwhatever i think i'm pretty open with my\nchat\nand they know when i'm you know in that\nmood when i'm feeling good i feel good\nright i think\ni'm more so referring to\nthis is why i say on my stream don't put\nme on a pedestal i'm just like you\nright i try to i try to give that off as\nmuch as i can\ni think the main reason like i think\nwhat i'm trying to say is\nthe main reason i think that those\nthings that we're talking about come\nacross and everyone labels every\nstreamer as that\nbecause they fail to realize that we're\njust like them we make the same mistakes\nyou know we [ __ ] like them we fart like\nthem we have our disgusting habits like\nthem we have our good habits like them\nwe last two seconds in bed like them\nsome days we last long some days some\ndays we have no sex at all some days we\ndo have sex some days we're just as\nlonely right\ni think people like attribute\nwrong things to people just because\nthey have fame or money right obviously\nnot to the level of like actors and\nstuff but this is like more like a c\nlevel c class whatever the [ __ ] but does\nthat make any sense\nyes what i'm trying to say is uh go\nahead what is it like\nto be what i'm hearing you basically say\nis that they don't\njudge you fairly oh well for me it's\ncontent i just\nyou know what do you mean content oh you\nknow i have a couple row sessions\nwell what what i didn't quite follow you\nthere but let me\ntry to reiterate yeah um so\nwhat i what i'm hearing you say is that\nyou know you guys get\njudged as streamers for being\nsociopathic narcissists and the problem\nis that people don't see\nthe rest of you right and that you guys\nare just like everyone else but you get\njudged in a different way that you [ __ ]\nyou finish in bed fast some days slow\nsome days\nyou're lonely some days you're not\nlonely other days\ncompletely get it right and you say\ndon't put on a pedestal\nand yet what i'm hearing you say is that\nyou know despite you sending that\nmessage\npeople do treat you differently right\nthey do put you on a pedestal\nor they put you under their crosshairs\nright that they project their\ninsecurities on you and things like that\nthat's\nthat's kind of well to be fair in a way\nthere are some people so the pedestal\nthing is just what i do i do the\npedestal thing to be fair i don't think\nanybody really follow\ni think people want to be put on a\npedestal right so that's kind of\nsomething i do in my stream i say don't\nput them in a pedestal\nbut i think the i think others they they\nwant the benefits of the pedestal\nbut then when it comes to the\nresponsibility taking responsibility of\nthe other half of being on put on a\npedestal they don't want that part\ni don't want either of them because i\nknow if if i don't want the bad parts i\ncan't have the good parts right\nand if i want the good parts i have to\naccept the bad parts so i just say\nlisten don't put me on a pedestal\ni'm just like you i'm gonna make a\nmistake next week i might say some [ __ ]\nthat might cancel all of us\nyou know don't think i'm this pg-13\nfigure that is some sort of robotic\n[ __ ]\nyou know uh inhumane thing i'm not right\nso that's me i think a lot of people\nwant to grab the good and then not have\nthe bad of the pedestal part\nso that's on them but i think that's one\nof the reasons\ni think that needs so it's not just a\nviewer thing it's it's a both thing\nstreamers kind of\ntake that they encourage it yeah and\nthey don't\npush back real does that make sense they\ndon't realize that\nif you don't want to take responsibility\nfor the bad parts of being put on a\npedestal you can't\nencourage and take the good parts and\nthen as soon as the bad happens you kind\nof step away and say oh this isn't fair\nso i think it's something that both\nviewers and instruments need to come\ntogether and they need to communicate\nand be more open about\nin order for the viewers to not just see\nthem as like a computer screen or some\nrich famous guy that's playing games\nthey would just see him as themselves so\ntrain i\ni noticed that you know if i just pay\nattention to the\nthe you know the subject of a lot of the\nsentences\nthat you use you're talking about\nstreamers but then you actually say that\nyou don't fall into that\nbucket in a lot of ways i'm hearing that\nlike so for example you say\na lot of people do want to be on a\npedestal i don't want to be\non a pedestal you know i feel like a lot\nof people want the good and don't want\nthe bad whereas i recognize you can't\nhave the good\nwithout the bad so yeah i don't want to\nhave it\nand and so what i'm curious about is i\nmean we can talk kind of hypothetically\nabout\nstreamers but frankly i don't know what\nto make of that right so what i tend to\nget curious about is like\nyou know what's in the mind of the\nperson who thinks that all streamers are\nsociopathic narcissists\nwhat's what's in the mind of the\nstreamer\nwho is on the receiving end of\nother people thinking that they're a\nsociopathic narcissist\nand so what i'm really curious about is\nlike what's in your mind\nand we can talk generally about\nstreamers but i don't i don't know how\nmuch we can learn\nor i mean i think we learned a lot but i\nthink you can offer a richness of\ninformation if we're talking about you\nthat we can't get\nif we're hypothesizing about other\npeople\ntrue okay\nso so i was just using this as a warm-up\nconversation to get my brain fluids\nflowing but yeah\ni'll answer that and then we'll go into\nthe actual juicy part of round three of\nthe dr k trainwrx tv talk so to answer\nyour question\num\nwhat's going on in the minds of\nthe viewer that's asserting\nor that's making that diagnosis or\nwhatever it's called\ni i guess i i don't know but i would if\ni made a\nguess i would say it's\nso from the viewers side i would say\nit's some sort of insecurity of their\nown\nwhere that where the where instead of\njust viewing the person as as they are\nand enjoying them as they are\nand realizing that they're not going to\nlike every single person if they don't\nlike them they should just move along\nand\nsee a new person i think i think they\nneed to\ni think that they need that diagnosis\nto be true like that's their way\nof shaping the streamer they're watching\nlike they don't want to leave because\nthey like them but\nthere's something of that person that\nmakes them feel away and the only way\nthey can make that feeling go away or\njustify that feeling and stay there\nis to assert those diagnoses onto them\nin order for them to rationalize why\nthey're perceiving the behavior that\nthey're\nlike attributing or whatever the word is\nthey're using as a rationalization to\nstay and watch\nby minimizing them and putting\nthemselves greater does that\ndoes that make any sense that that's\nwhat i would guess possibly as the view\ni completely agree i mean i i think so\nthere's something really interesting if\nyou look at\num you know eastern theories of the mind\none of the things that they say is that\nthe ego is a protective mechanism and\nthe ego\nhelps you when you're feeling sad or\nvulnerable or emotionally hurt\nby putting pumping yourself up or\nputting other people down\nyes right so yes i can feel better about\nmyself if i put other people down\nand this is one of the really\ninteresting things is i've been\nexploring why people are so toxic\ntowards celebrities and and streamers\ni think one of the interesting things\nthat i realized is that\nyou know if you put an ant down\nyou don't your ego doesn't get a whole\nlot if you put a peer down\nyour ego gets more if you\ntake someone who's above you down a\nnotch\nthen your ego gets a lot and if you\ntopple someone who's at the top of a\npedestal\nwell then you get to feel really good\nabout yourself\nyeah and so it's really interesting um\nand you know just as a side note train i\ncan't i'm gonna troll you here a little\nbit let me know if you you know this is\noffensive but\nnothing's offensive if you're wondering\nyou know maybe why people think\nyou come across as narcissistic what i'm\nhearing from you say\noh i know what it is\nwell i'll be honest with you\ni mean just look at me right now my legs\nare crossed i mean look at me like i'm\nsitting here as if\nyou know i mean i see it myself i feel\nlike\ni'm almost offending myself by looking\nat myself like i just look like\ni don't know i look aggressive i look\naggressively confident as if i figured\nlife out and i know what i'm talking\nabout i don't mean to come off that way\ni don't think\ni think i know nothing right now i'm to\nbe honest i'm insecure about half the\n[ __ ] i've said the last 30 minutes but\nwhen i'm looking at my physical features\nin the outside shell it looks like i\nthink\ni've said everything because i know it's\ncorrect and if you disagree you're gone\nthat's the way i look to myself but on\nthe inside i've actually been insecure\nabout the last 30 minutes of what i've\nbeen saying because honestly\ni'm so kind of i'm so foggy and gloomy\nor uh\njust so i'm just waking up i don't know\nwhat the [ __ ] i've been seeing the last\n30 minutes\nright so that's what's inside but the\noutside i'm looking at myself it looks\nlike i have figured the world out and\ni'm just telling you\nwhat i'm telling you is god's grace and\nyou should you know be happy i've been\nspeaking that's what\nthat's what i look like to me when i'm\nspeaking but the inside of actually\ninsecure about what i've been saying i'm\nlike what the [ __ ] am i saying right now\nholy [ __ ]\ndoes that make sense you feel entirely\ntoo much okay can i do one thing real\nquick yeah\ni have to use the restroom real quick is\nthat go for it okay\nand i'll gather my thoughts i'm so sorry\nno no\ndude call of nature bro i'm back sorry\nabout that no problem man\nyeah you know that uh that hot tea just\nwent through and\nyou know i just took the longest pee of\nmy life\nyeah no i'm just kidding i i i yeah i\nyeah you know i i don't like talking\nabout this because\nyou know i i still you know uh\nlisten chat i took a [ __ ] okay get over\nit\nand it was good it was one it was one of\nthose where you know honestly i wish i\ncould have sat there for another 45\nminutes\nyou know and just just really just wrote\nit out you know what i'm talking about\nit's one of those that\ni almost wish i could have sucked back\nin and redid it\nit was that good does that make any\nsense yeah that sounds\nyeah yeah i've never heard anyone say\nthat but yeah i too\nexperienced i i enjoy sitting on the pot\nyou know after doing a number two and\nand actually it's a very um\nphysiologically intensive process\nyeah you know well i want to know that\nsome time like recover from\nit so yeah but anyways so back to where\nwe're\ni'm a lot more clear now so actually you\ngo ahead i think you're going to respond\ngo ahead\nyeah so i was just going to say you know\nit's interesting because you say when\nyou look at yourself\nyou see a guy who comes across as\narrogant yeah\nand which is interesting because what\nyou feel is insecure\nand i don't think you come across as\narrogant at all man i think you come\nacross as pretty chill and pretty\ngenuine at least that's how i perceive\nyou i don't think you're\nyou know you're not like claiming to be\nyou know the the source of wisdom and\nknowledge in the world in fact quite the\nopposite you're\nyou're owning that you're just one guy\nand you're like everyone else and and\neverything else you're kind of sitting\nback you're relaxed\nyou're kind of chilling and and i think\nthe interesting thing is that\ni don't think it's a coincidence that\nyour feeling of insecurity\ncoexists with your judgmental perception\nof yourself\nright so if we think about it so you\nperceive yourself as someone who's\nfalsely confident or\noverly confident or look at this guy who\nwho looks like he knows what he's\ntalking about\nyes and when you say it's it's\ninteresting because if you really tunnel\ndown into that that language\nlooks like he knows what he's talking\nabout\nyep and that looks like actually is\nrooted in your own secure\ninsecurity train well if if i may expand\non what i meant by that\nso you you\nyou are you know wise you have\nexperience you know and\nyou're a little older than the j you\nknow than an average viewer of twitch\nright so it's not\nso when i tell you that i look at myself\nand that's what i see\nit's not because it's what i feel about\nmyself\nit's because what i've that's what i've\nbeen told\nthat i look like ever since\nmiddle school and that's one of the\ngeneral re that's actually probably the\nmain\ni honestly believe and this this is a\nfact\nthis isn't some victim card thing that i\nknow they love to say victim card\nthis is this is a fact and anyone who\ndoesn't admit this by this point on\ntwitch based on everything that's gone\non\nis just in denial i'm vilified no matter\nwhat i do\nso it's it's that vilification\nthat that's where it stems from right\nit's the voice it's the mixture of the\nway i look the way i come off\nso when i say i look this way it's not\nthat i truly believe i look that way to\nme the way i look is completely\nnormal and average like anybody else now\ni understand\ni have some protruding features i mean\nthere's this one time that stuck with me\nsince now\ni went to a doctor and the doctor tried\nto convince my parents to\ngo to undergo a surgery to shave down my\nprotruding\nbones in my face to have a more uh uh\nwell-liked appearing face like a more\ntrusting face rather than like a warrior\nbones protruding so a doctor tried\ntelling my mom to do that\nand my mom yeah my mom said no and i'm\nhappy she said no because [ __ ] that\nright\nyou're beautiful shane and thank you\nthank you and people told me to get you\nknow\nno surgeries i said hell no you know i i\nlove my nose you know like i i love\nmyself i have a love for myself you know\nand it doesn't go into this like\nnarcissistic thing like i just i\nappreciate\nyou know the way i look i do think i'm\nthe best looking on twitch that's not a\nmeme you know it's half meme to kind of\nease it into people's minds but i'm my\nfamily best looking\nright these things are what i believe\nit's not that i think i look this way\nit's that i've learned that when i speak\nfor some reason these things are\nattributed to me and people\nsince middle school and this will go\ninto the bullying stories people\nneed me to be a certain thing like they\nneed me to be the villain or whatever\nthey see\nthey need me to be that otherwise i\ncan't be accepting their\nlike i don't know if it's out of a fear\nthat's like instilled in them where i\nneed to be ripped down and teared down\nand\nso it's just it's just been continuous\nthat right and i'll give you examples of\nthat um\nhere later on we go to the bullying\nstuff but so that's what i mean when i\nsay\ni i've slowly understood where they're\ncoming from because\nwhen i look at myself i\nwhen i put myself into when i try to put\nmyself into someone that doesn't know me\ni mean this part isn't an insecurity\npart i think it's just true right if i\nwere to see let's say a chance on the\nsoda puppet on the street right i'd be\nlike yeah i don't want to approach him\ni'd be like hey what's up man you need\nhelp with that\nbut if i saw me on this trip like damn\nif i say the wrong thing i'm gonna get\npunched in the face\nlike that that's just like i think it's\njust a common like instinctual thing\nright like if you see someone that has\nthis like\nmore protruding face you know kind of\nyou know he looks\nangry because of his extreme passionate\nfacial features\nyou know he gets he gets into an\nargument he can't just talk normal tone\nhe has to start yelling\nbut i'm not actually yelling i'm just\nexcited but since i have a deep voice\nit's coming across like\ni'm doing a battle cry right so these\nthings that\ni for the longest time didn't realize\nbut these things\nare what people kind of see and since\nthey don't know me\nthat's kind of their first impression\nthat they assert\ndoes that make any sense that's just\nkind of what i gathered i'm not saying\nthey're right to do it\nbecause i i don't think they are but\nit's just what i've accepted to just be\nthe baseline\nto be vilified no matter what you do\nwell it's kind of funny\nbecause it's been this way since the\nbeginning\nnow am i saying that i'm a perfect human\nbeing and i don't deserve to be\ncriticized or held accountable for\nthings no i definitely think i should be\nheld accountable for a lot of things i\nthink i made a lot of mistakes\ni think that i will continue to make\nmistakes\nbut it's weird because because it's been\nthis way for so long for me\nit's like my bod my myself has adapted\nto now when i'm not vilified\nwhen i go through bouts of acceptance\ni'm bored i'm content i've lost\nmotivation\nit's almost as if my body has adapted\nwhere i need to be hated and doubted\nin order to to to to to to progress\nand i'll give you an example of that um\nearlier this year\num there was the australian wildfires\nand we did a charity for them\nand i think for the first time in a long\ntime it was like two days\nwhere it was just pure peace everyone's\nlike oh train\ngood thing he did ignore everything else\ngood thing great thing good job train\nand there was nothing like it was like\nlike i should you know i was happy i was\ni was happy that i was being accepted\nfinally or whatever but\ni was kind of i was like damn what now\nyou know and i didn't do it for that\nreason i did it because\na lot of my community is from australia\nso i knew that the fires were\nyou know impacting their lives and i\nknew that it was you know [ __ ] their\n[ __ ] up and they would talk about in my\nchat so i thought you know\nwe kind of do it for the core community\nand for the people\nbut that little two days of just\nacceptance i was like damn what now\nit's like my body couldn't or my mind\ncouldn't\nit's got i gained this adaptive trait\nover the last like 15 years where i\nneeded to be doubted\nhated and vilified in order to progress\nand prove people wrong does that make\nany sense\nmakes a lot of sense so what do you why\ndo you think that's an adaptation\nso if we think about an adaptation an\nadaptation allows us\nto succeed in a particular environment\nright so what is the adaptation like\nwhat right so you like you've taken\nthe negative energy directed towards you\nand you use it as fuel that's what i'm\nhearing\nyes yes right\nyeah can i think for a second\nplease do yeah\nso what what happened after the\nwildfires like did you do something to\nbecome\nvilified once again because people\nthought you were like a decent person\nand then you kind of\nyou say you get bored then what happens\noh it just goes back to a baseline what\nis the baseline though\nthe baseline's just the vilified the\nvilified thing or it's kind of just like\nis that but how do people vilify you or\nis there something that triggers\ntheir hatred\ni think that\num i definitely say\nsome stupid [ __ ] i'll do so i'll\num yeah i mean\nyeah i i think i say some pretty dumb\n[ __ ] i think you know there's times\nwhere i say some stupid [ __ ] there's\ntimes where i you know\nhave a little laugh with my friends or\ni'll have opinions that don't match the\nuh\nyou know popular opinion can you give me\nan example of what\nwhat you described as a dumb shift that\nyou say\num i think there is so since there are\nso many people watching\ni think there's a disconnect between\nlike uh with context\nright so if i'm talking to like my\ncommunity and we're just like making a\njoke or i'm just talking to them and\njust clowning around\nthat that could be clipped and obviously\nunless you're there in that moment and\nyou can pick up the last two hours of\ncontext you're gonna see that as\nwhat the [ __ ] is this guy saying like\nthis is some stupid [ __ ] how could you\nsay that right\num so i think that leads to a lot of\nthings and\ni think the main part is so\ni think that\nit's just there's no benefit to the\ndoubt given\nright so i think uh for example right\nlet's say\na buddy of mine chants he says some soda\npop and he says some\ndumb [ __ ] it kind of goes nah it's just\nchance he doesn't mean [ __ ] right\nbut if i say some dumb [ __ ] that's out\nof context there's no like there's no\ndigging and looking at the context\nthere's no seeing what was it about it's\nlike\nthey need to believe that it is the\nworst possible thing that i could mean\ndoes that make sense and i think that\ncomes from the base level\nwhy do they believe that about you why\ndo they give chance the benefit of the\ndoubt but they don't give you the\nbenefit well\ni genuinely believe i genuinely think\nit's that halo effect thing\nright what is that halo effect what does\nthat mean\nthe you know i don't know that term\noh it's like i think\nthis is tough to say because no one's\ngonna ever\ni think it comes down from the way that\nyou come across\nright i think uh a buddy of mine poke\nhim and i did this test one stream\nwhere we talked beforehand and there was\nthis like graph we both saw\nand we didn't tell the stream and\nthere's this graph of like a face that's\nlike more trusting\nthat people can be okay with them being\nsuccessful or better or having a better\ncar or a better house or better\ngirlfriend they're okay they're like\nplease do we\nwill even support you more if you have\nit and there's a face where\nif you even have one thing better you\nhave to be torn down to the ground\nand me and poke saw this graph and we\nrealized like we're sitting at the exact\nopposites\nof like like he's on this face i'm on\nthis face and kind of laughed at it\nand then we like did this a little test\nand\nthe reaction was perfect it was like it\nwas the per it was exactly what we\nthought and what the like graph would\nsay it would be\nright whereas like one face looks more\nlike it just needs to be torn down and\nneeds to be like\ndevoured and the other face every\nbenefit the doubt given every\ncredibility given even more\ncredibility given than even uh deserved\nright\nso it's kind of like those two\npolarizing spectrums of the way you come\nacross\ndoes that make sense yeah\nso train i'm a little bit\nso i'm in a fork in the road yeah go\nahead\nso i have a couple of random thoughts\nthat are sort of starting to come\ntogether in a hypothesis\nperfect please please let me finish\nand then the other thing though is that\ni'm wondering whether it's\nbetter to hold on to the hypothesis from\nnow\nfor now and talk to you a little bit\nabout bullying\nbecause i think that'll probably flesh\nthe hypothesis out\nokay or i can kind of you know\njump to a conclusion it's not really a\nconclusion because it's not really\nwell-formed it's just like\ndata points that i think it's kind of\nlike a constellation right like\ni see these couple data points and\nsomeone's like that's an archer and it's\nlike it's just a random\nscattering of points right so the archer\nis what i'm\nmaking out of these data points and\nthat's really unfair\nand i really am so with with some people\ni would just jump out and i would say\nhey here's like maybe what's going on\nbut let's just think about\nwhat you're telling us what you're\ntelling us is that people don't give you\nthe benefit of the doubt what you're\ntelling us is that\nsomeone looks at one constellation of\nstars and\nif it's sodapoppin they say that's a\nbirthday cake and if it's you\nthat's a tombstone right like and so\nit's interesting because that's that's\naccurate yeah so now i have to be really\ncareful because\ni would normally consider sharing this\nwith you but if we really think about\nwhat your actual\nwhat you're telling us is that like\npeople don't give you the benefit of the\ndoubt so there's a part of me that wants\nto kind of pull back and say\nlet me really make sure let me give you\nthe benefit of the doubt let me\nask you a few more questions let's get\ninto it and then maybe i can\nshare this with you at the end but i\nreally leave it up to you\nbecause you know it's what you want to\ndo why don't we start with the\ngood the the juicy stuff where we left\noff for around two we'll tend to round\nthree because\nbecause i don't think to be honest\ni don't feel like i explained everything\ni explained to you right now\nas a perfect representation of what i\nbelieve i think some of it was just kind\nof filler because i couldn't think of\nthe right stuff\nso i don't feel too confident in an\nanalysis like of that of me\nso let's start with the round three the\nround three of our talk based on where\nwe left off\nand then it goes into exactly what we're\njust talking about but i think\nif i can explain to you through my\nexperience and through actual example\nyou can actually get a better\nunderstanding of what i'm saying because\ni think the way i'm describing it is\njust so\nit's just so all over the place that at\nthis point i'm not even recognizing what\ni'm describing to you as being myself\nanymore so\nyeah let's start with the round two the\nthe round three stuff we'll start and at\nthe end you can\ni'd love to hear actually cool examples\ncool\nyeah okay so we can let's start\nlet's start end of elementary school\nokay so end of elementary school so\nfifth grade to sixth grade from fifth\ngrade you're in a different school\nsixth grade is middle school so you\nswitch schools entirely and you get into\na different whole different bracket\njust explain this because some people\nhave you know things that are mixed from\nk1 to 12th grade\nit's elementary school i remember i was\nuh you know\ni was still a kid when i say kid\ni'm talking kid i'm talking zero\nawareness of\nhygiene for myself and my parents still\ntell me you know\nzero awareness style zero awareness of\nwhat's\nin music wise blah blah fifth grade i go\ninto sixth grade\ni'm still wearing my short shorts i\nstill have my\ni still remember the shirt i had on\nfirst day of school it was this little\nfish shirt that had a\nhole in it because the the teachers\nhamster in fifth grade\nthat i held in my hand actually nibbled\nthrough my shirt i wore that shirt to\nschool as a fish\nshort shorts glasses you know probably\nbad breath because i didn't brush my\nteeth that morning\na couple of pimples and i remember going\nto school everyone\neveryone kind of i don't know what the\nword is assimilated or they kind of just\nwent into the style you know everyone\nknew how to dress the you know the\nbasketball shorts below your knees\nshort socks instead of long white socks\nyou know actual lace shoes instead of\nvelcroed ones\neveryone kind of knew and i wanted to\nschool with one best friend\nand that best friend's name was tyler\nthat was my name and i remember the\nfirst day of school\neveryone kind of looked at me laughed\nyou know and\ni had one best friend that i like\ntrusted he was my best friend from\nchildhood all the way up to sixth grade\nand there was this other kid\nthat was like a baseball prospect he was\nlooking to be like on the baseball team\nfirst year everyone was talking about\nhim in the leagues\nhis name was ryan now i remember uh\nsixth grade or my first lunch\ni got my lunch and everyone's kind of\nsomehow everyone knew each other i don't\nknow how they could know each other i\ndon't know if there was some event\noutside of school that they all knew\neach other beforehand\nbut anyways i found tyler and tyler's\nwith sitting with ryan and other people\nand\nat that point i'm you know already\nfeeling insecure\ni'm feeling terrible i'm feeling\nunwelcome\nand i'm thinking i have one good friend\nso i go up to him and i'm ready to sit\nwith him and he looks at me and he's\nlike\nyou can't sit with me and i kind of just\nlike i was kind of in shock\nand he said a couple other mean things\nand then all the friends laughed and\nthen from that\nfrom that day on for the rest of sixth\ngrade i ate my bathroom alone\nin in this in the bathroom like i ate my\nfood alone in the bathroom alone\nand that kind of started a big that was\nlike the start to everything\nthat was the start to like that was the\nstart i would even say to the to my\nbrand on stream\num the squad w the double standard\nand i'll get to that a little later so\nanyways i i i go through sixth grade\nlike that eat my bathroom\ni eat my food in the bathroom and\nyou know that came with its own thing\nyou know i would be eating\nusually i'd be crying in there and i'd\nhave that little you know\nthat deep pain in my chest kind of\nfeeling and i'd end up just\nnot eating because i'd be full after\nthat but that was for that entire year\nseventh grade came along and\nin seventh grade there was this girl\nthat was in\nsixth grade that was seen by the entire\nschool as the hardest girl in the school\nnow for some reason this girl she saw me\nand she didn't want anyone else she just\nwanted me\nbut i was just so like i was still so\nmature i was so hated i was even more\ninsecure\nand keep in mind in this is gonna be\nreally hard to believe but in middle\nschool\ni had this deep a voice this this voice\nyou're hearing i had this voice\nand i remember and i know i'm not\nmisremembering cause i remember\nspecific teachers to this day that still\ncommented on my voice's deepness\nat that age\nso anyways\nso this girl kind of saw me looked at me\nand she liked me i didn't know how\nbut she did and you know i never made\nanything of it\ni kind of just stayed friends and then\nyou know um i believe\ni want to say\num so i rode the same bus as her best\nfriend and her best friend would always\nlike kind of tell me and talk to me and\ni'll get into that i can bring this back\nup yeah but her best friend kind of\nuh related to me right but i was at that\npoint i was like\nso nervous and insecure and shy that it\nwas as if she was talking to a wall\ni just didn't i didn't really absorb it\nor i thought it was just\nsome sort of plot against me at that\npoint with like how much i got [ __ ]\nwith\nso anyways 7th grade comes along i\nforgot\nwhen 911 happened to this time\nbut i did 9 11 in sixth grade or fifth\ngrade\n2001 i mean anyways seventh grade comes\nalong\nand you know i'm pershing i'm iranian so\nthe 911 thing in in in that\nyeah in arizona right it didn't matter\nif you're\nyou know iranians completely separate\nfrom\neverything else like it's different\nlanguage different ethnicity different\neverything\nbut they didn't care right iran sounds\nlike iraq that's just what it was\nfor them in that school so i remember\nthere was this kid\nshane um he was kind of the redneck\nkind of of the school and he was proud\nof it like he would say that stuff\nand i remember he uh made comments that\nmy parents\nblew up the building they were in the\nplane blah blah blah or like my parents\nbrothers were on the plane and\nmy parents are responsible and this\nother guy named chris set up the fight\nbetween me and that kid and that kid was\nthe cool kid of the school he was in the\ncool kid group he was the wrestler\nand i was you know the soccer player and\nthe loser\nand chris set up the fight and long\nstory short we met up in the bathroom\nand i ended up breaking his nose and\nin that moment that three minutes that\none punch that broke his nose\neverything changed suddenly because i\nbecause of one punch that isn't\nreflective of my character isn't\nreflective of who i am\nit is it has nothing to do with\nwho i want to be what i think i am my\nemotions\nwhat i want to see in the world there's\nno depth to it nothing\nbut because of a simple punch suddenly\nthe entire population of girls wanted me\nsuddenly all the guys wanted me to sit\nat their table and be friends with them\nand at that time i couldn't understand\nhow i could sit there and go through\nwhat i went through relative to my life\nfor those one and a half years\nand then a single punch to one person's\nface that's clearly in the wrong as\nbeing racist\nis all that it takes for me to be loved\nby all\naccepted by all right it made no sense\nto me and you know that this will lead\non to\nmy brand and squad w and everything else\nso anyways uh that happens i end up uh\nyou know i i get carried away a little\nbit into it all\nand but i don't forget the girl that\nliked me before it all\nand i kind of just stuck with her eighth\ngrade comes along\ni'm sorry can you see that that last\npart again what about that oh i i stuck\nwith so i\ni ended up choosing the girl that was\nwith me for all of the [ __ ] right\nso she liked me before the punch and now\nthat i punch someone all them want me\nthey want me to sit with them and hang\nout with them and go to their little\nkickbacks and parties\nand this is the girl that was super hot\nor no\nyes it was the girl that liked me before\nthe punch it was the super hot so were\nyou dating her\nuh we weren't dating we were still doing\nour little\nyou know thing yeah yeah i would i would\nwell i did those on virginity at 13\nwhich is middle school\nso it's not this thing where it's middle\nschool we're just talking nothing\nhappening like the people were\ndefinitely doing stuff\nat least in my time in day and age you\nknow people are doing stuff that i guess\nis weird to talk about now for some\nreason but\num we're you know we were hooking up and\nstuff but we were just kind of like\ngoing slow\nit was something you'd see out of like\nsome like teen wolf you know some\nsome mtv movie you know anyways\neighth grade comes along and i'm still\nkind of riding out the punch you know\ni'm still kind of the cool kid now\nbut you know i'm still friends with all\nmy friends\nand at the end of eighth grade you know\ni'm still\ni live that life i have that year and a\nhalf of\nperspective that i've gained from being\nthe cool kid from\nyou know anything i say\num\ni was definitely still insecure um\nbut i definitely did ride out\nsome of the benefits of the position of\nbeing the cooler kid and\nyou know the feared kid or whatever the\nhell the case might be\ni wrote it out a little bit you know\nobviously i was young i was\nimmature and you know i i definitely\nwrote it out\nyou know it had its advantages and\nalmost had no disadvantages to be\ncompletely honest\nweird weird school is just weird high\nschool middle school is weird for some\nreason\nif you're the cool kid you already have\nzero disadvantage until later in life\nwhen you realize\nthat was your peak and it made you\ncontent with everything so you had\nno you know further ambition to move\nhigher up anyways\nso anyways no it didn't happen to me and\nbecause it's because i i'll tell you why\nand this may have actually saved me in a\nway but\nso at the end of eighth grade i'm still\nkind of the cool kid going around you\nknow\ndifferent schools are getting together\nyou know\ni i'm like the i'm like the pillar of my\nschool and the other cool kids at other\nschools we'd all get together party and\nlike it was just it was like a crazy\ntime anyways\nso end of eighth grade my parents want\nto move\nnow keep in mind i'm like this emo kid\nso that was kind of my day and age i'm\nthis scene kid i've\nyou know girl pants on shirt jacket you\nknow\nand you know i'm just\nyou know it's one girl after the other\nbecause it was insane\nright this was eighth [ __ ] grade so\nlike it was just\ncrazy awesome virginity that eighth\ngrade and\nmy parents want to move to different\ncity\nso the city that i was in\nwas very culturally diverse there was\neveryone\nyou know a lot of you know a lot of\nblack kids a lot of mexican kids a lot\nof\nmiddle eastern kids a lot of white kids\neveryone just it's a big melting pot\njust\nmixed mixed mix mixed my parents want to\nmove\nright we end up moving\nwe end up going over to which i guess\nthere was more background stories i\nended up losing my best friend because\nof the move\nbut that's i guess that's irrelevant to\nwhat we're talking about i guess there's\na piece of it but anyways\ni'll just i'll skip that we'll get to\nthat later so we ended up moving\nwe're not moving to scottsdale\nscottsdale arizona\nnow i end up going to the school um\nyeah this is in eighth grade so you guys\nmove in the middle of eighth grade no no\nwe move at the end of it good so i moved\nmy first\nfreshman year of high school oh wow so\nnew high school new high school\nnew city new place no one knows me\nmove there and if there is any place\nopposite of culturally diverse melting\npot type thing it is this\nschool that i went to it was called\nchaparral high school\ni think it is a rated school and it's in\nthe top 1200 for like america\nfor public schools now\nthis school's all white kids when i say\nall white\ni'm saying that like my junior year in\nthat school was probably the first time\ni saw a black kid walk in the halls\nor and then we had like two asian kids\nlike it was like that\neveryone was white everyone there it was\nthe weirdest\nexperience and they were all like going\nto that phase where they're gangster\nwhite\nbut they all came from very rich\nfamilies right it was just a very very\ndifferent place and me walking in there\ndressed the way i was dressed being the\nway i was\nit started all over and\nthe bullying so right\nso i walk in no one knows me\ni kind of just you know first day i'm\nshy i don't carry over any of the\nthings from eighth grade and i just kind\nof was myself\nand it was just a crazy experience and\ni remember freshman year you know uh\ni got [ __ ] with a lot you know i for\nme for me it was more so\nthe it was the it was the vocal\nuh it was the emotional bullying that\ni was kind of cursed with\num so i got so\ni would get made funner for my big head\npeople would call me domer which\nnow it's been made into a meme and it's\na better thing but\nthey call me domer they call me t-rex\nbecause of my protruding bones in my\nface they'd say i look like a dinosaur\num you know all the things that you hear\ntoday in twitch chat they said then\nnow it's kind of different so i'm okay\nwith it now\nyou know now i've kind of owned it um\nyou know typical stuff just ugly\nunwanted [ __ ] like that and and in those\ndays you have to understand in those\ndays\nthere was no acknowledgement\nfor emotional abuse there was none it\nwas sticks and stones may break your\nbones but words cannot hurt you and that\nwas accepted by\nall everybody including myself right\nso it was a different time there was no\nawareness of that it was physical\nbullying or no bullying and\nlater on we find out that emotional\nabuse is even worse\nbut anyways it was just non-stop you\nknow girls would\npoint and laugh guys would point and\nlaugh they would throw food at me [ __ ]\nlike that\nnow and how did you feel about yourself\nwhen\nthat kind of stuff would happen um\nwhat did you understand like what's your\nunderstanding about the world\nand who you are and who they are\nand\ni was an idiot i\nthe more i got\n[ __ ] with the better i wanted to be\n[Music]\nlike to them i thought\nmaybe i don't know\nyou wanted them to like you i want i i\nwanted them to like me but i also\ni i have this weird thing in me and this\nis how i am to this day where\nyou know right now you could punch me in\nthe face and we can we can get into a\nfist fight\nand right when that fist fight ends it's\nlike the slate is cleaned\nlike i i will go and buy you a burrito\nwe'll have a nice lunch together\nright so after like a bout of emotional\nabuse or bullying\ni would do nice things for them\nand it\nconfused them\nbut i didn't see it as anything bad\ni saw it as i just kind of\naccepted that that's just the way i came\noff\nthat maybe like that's what i needed to\ngo through\nin order to be seen\nas like a i don't know\ndoes that make any sense i'm not really\nsure how to explain\ni thought i needed to go through that\nthat was my\nyou know i thought maybe i i needed to i\ndon't know\ndoes that make any sense yeah it almost\nsounds to me like you felt on some level\nyou deserved it\nit needed to happen right\nyeah i use deserve in a loaded way\ni know i know i know i know i didn't\ntake that in that yeah don't worry\ni'm not i'm not\ni guess i didn't under so it's crazy\nbecause right now everything in my life\nright now to this day my brand\neverything i preach\nit stems from those days\nabsolutely i just i i didn't understand\nhow\ni didn't get how like the nice things\nthat you know\nare nice things nice you know the\nactions that\nthe good things that you do for people i\ndidn't get how those\ndidn't matter it's like people they talk\nabout them like they matter\nthey talk about how they want them how\nthey wish the world was like this\nbut when they see it happen\nit's made fun of it's uncool the person\ndoing them is just a [ __ ] nerd loser\nyou know soy boy right whatever the [ __ ]\nright\nbut it's the talk of wanting it that\npeople value more than the actual\ngetting it right so it's like all the\ncool kids will talk about doing all the\ngood\nbut they'll just be [ __ ] douche bags\nand dicks and superficial and\ngo do opposite if they talk and then\nwhen there's somebody that's doing it\nit doesn't matter if they're doing it no\none cares it's like it's the cool thing\nto do is to talk about it\nto share the idea to to spread the hope\nthrough the talk but when someone\nactually does it they're\ni don't know it was just this weird\nthing i learned this happened all the\nway back then too\nit was [ __ ] insane right uh\nso it was uncool to be nice and good\nfor the second time yeah go ahead how\ndoes it feel to be vilified no matter\nwhat you do\nright because that's what you're telling\nme you're telling me that like\nyou know everyone talks about being nice\nlike something to aspire to\nwe in our talk we place value to it\nand what i'm imagining is there's like a\na kid in 10th grade\nman in 10th grade who\ngets made fun of because of\nthe way your face looks and then\nlike what i'm hearing from you\noverwhelmingly is that like you sort of\ndidn't\ndeserve what they did and and you could\nhave been an [ __ ] and they would have\nmade fun of you you could have said\nnothing and they would have made fun of\nyou\nwell i said nothing yeah and then you\ncould you tried to be nice like you\ntried to be a good person you tried to\nbe\nwhat people aspire to right you tried to\nbecome a good person and to be respected\nand then they laughed at you and made\nfun of you anyway well they hated it so\nno matter what\nif i can get to the end and then i'll\nanswer that because the end is so\nimportant to everything\nright okay and i've only had i think\nwhen i get to the end and tell you\nwhat i'm going to tell you i've only had\nmaybe three or four other people in my\nlife\nbe able to admit what this individual\nadmitted\nand recently actually hafu is one of the\npeople that could\njust be confident enough or i don't know\nwhat the wording is but to admit it\nthat's why i respect the hell out of\nwhen i really like hafu but\nso long story short you know just\nanother four years of\njust you know even on my soccer team\nright i made varsity freshman year\nand even there man you know\ni got in in the soccer team they\nactually physically bullied me right\nlike they would\ncoach wouldn't look it was something you\nsee out of a movie you know they would\ntrip me they would just\n[ __ ] push me down kick me on the\nground and the coach would look back\naround and\nhe would think that i'm the one horsing\naround so i would get the laps\nit was some just [ __ ] up [ __ ] but that\nwas just i just took that as what it was\nnot to mention i ended up taking\none of the senior player spots because i\nended up being the first leading goal\nscorer for\nin freshman year so that was more of i\njust saw that as\nyou know the insecure kind of\nlike i said the talk over the action\nthing anyways\ni'm gonna skip past everything okay\nthere's a lot of detail in there but i\nthink\nyou get a good gist i don't need to make\nthis a pity party so senior year\nwhy not because\nbecause in my opinion by now i think\ni think the people or you\nbased on what i've said they know what\ni'm talking about\nif you don't know what i'm talking about\nat this point then the more i talk\nyou i feel like it's only gonna make you\nunderstand through pity and feeling bad\nand if you understand through pity and\nfeeling bad you don't\nactually understand and there's no\nactual solution that comes from it\nall that comes from it is just the\nfeeling of feeling bad for the\nindividual\nand giving them you know treating them\nin a way because\nyou feel bad but you don't truly\nunderstand what they went through right\ndoes that make any sense man i could go\ndeeper into sophomore junior and senior\nyear\ni could definitely you know the parties\nthe not being invited the\nkind of being kicked out in front of\neverybody because\nyou know i was never welcome in the\nfirst place or i'm a loser like\nthings like that like i can go i mean\nthere's a lot of like rejection and\njust you know what what i'm what i'm\ncurious about is why you're devaluing\npity\nbut anyway we can just we can go to the\nend i'm just taking notes\ni guess i devalue pity because\ni don't know i was i was kind of\ni don't know like i\nfor me it was there's you can't put your\nhead down in sulk\nyou can't pity you have to you know\ninstead think of a way you're going to\nbeat it\nyou know think of the think of the way\nyou're going to climb the mountain and\nget over it you know if you sit there\nand\nyou know just i don't know\nyou know for me that there was no i\ndidn't have my things solved by others i\nhad to solve them\nright so i don't know does that make any\nsense\nyeah yeah it makes a lot of sense but\ni think it's it's pity didn't help is\nwhat i'm hearing\nno pity i was\ni've never been i've never been\ni don't know what the word is i don't\nwant to say blessed\ni've never had the accommodate i've\nnever had the luxury\nof being pitied i've never like no one's\never felt\nno one's ever said oh poor you know he\ndoesn't you know minus my parents maybe\nbut like\nyou know no one's ever said oh damn man\nlike it's all good bro like you don't\ndeserve this\nlike you know keep your head up like one\nday you'll be hungry and proof of them\nwrong\nthat was never the case it's as if like\nin a way\neven the people who called me friends in\na way like\nin the back their minds they enjoyed me\nbeing put down\nso like i just you feel if i said i pity\nyou\ni guess in a way i feel insulted i think\nso\ndoes that make any sense you're just\njust from like where i'm at\nyep so i don't even think like i don't\neven want the pity\nyou don't want the pity i completely\nagree yeah what's insulting about it\nhow dare you that's what i that's\nwell yeah what's insulting about it is\nwhat i went through where i'm at right\nnow i don't even see it as a bad thing\ni'm glad i went through it i see it as a\nstrength\ni i turned weakness\ni turned i turned the destruction of\nmyself the the putting down of myself\ninto one of my greatest strengths and\ninto a fuel\nthat people who didn't have that life\ncan never taste and i'm not saying that\nyou need to have that life or it's a\ngood thing in my life it's not\nbut i just don't need anyone's pity\ndoes that make any sense makes a lot of\nsense\nyeah so we'll circle back to that okay\nwe'll circle back to it okay so senior\nyear\ni finally got to a place now keep in\nmind i'm still insecure\ni'm still immature i'm still extremely\ninsecure\nto the point i mean there's a lot i left\nout about you know just this school is a\nrich school\nso that's where a lot of my insecurities\ncame from where i felt like i need to\nlie about what i have in order to be\naccepted\nyou know why about a car or a house or\nwho owns what\nand it stems from this school but\nanyways\nsenior year comes around i still\nremember the group of kids that would\nbully me right\num it was pretty much the football team\nright and\nthat the head of it all his name was\nethan\nright now i think he's like in hollywood\nsomewhere like uh\nhe's best friends with like the brother\nof\nemma stone emma stone his brother\nspencer and then i went to school\nspencer and\ni think freshman year emma emma's\nbrother spencer and spencer's best\nfriends ethan\nand they kind of took him to hollywood\nnow they work there anyways though\nso\nso that's kind of what it was well\nhere's the thing\nso emma was actually a very nice person\nshe's always been very\nnice and very good like very mature very\nnice so that's actually the surprising\npart like\nshe was the like mature responsible one\nshe was cool\ni only got like i think i only saw for\nsix months before she would transfer\nschools to like a private school or\nsomething but\nher brother ended up transferring back\nto our school\nand he he had his bouts you know he was\nhalf and half he was kind of embarrassed\nto you know be around me i was the loser\nhe was the cool kid whatever\num how do i feel about that we'll get\ninto that a little later\nbut anyway so at the end of the school\nyear\ni gave that background information just\nto kind of add more credibility to it\nall but\nby credibility i mean how how well i\nremember the events because the human\nmemory usually you know it's not too\ngood but anyways\nso senior year comes around and\ni've always been a very like blunt\nperson when it comes i just kind of\nasked straight up things that people are\ntoo like embarrassed for and it wasn't\nalways like this it kind of built up all\nthe way to senior year\nso senora comes around and\ni had a class at this english class and\nmy teacher was the football\nlike strategy coach\nand all the players were my class at the\nend they would hit me in class\nand then the teacher would i think\nrelive his the high school experience he\nthinks he deserved through being a\nteacher and\ngiving the cool kids a pass and getting\nme in trouble for getting hit and\nretaliating\num sometimes school year ended and i\nended up asking this guy\nthis this ethan guy like why\ndid they hate me right and i remember\nactually there was one big thing i\nremember they would so ethan\nhis girlfriend worked in the student\nyearbook so in like the student council\nyearbook\nand this was the worst part for me i\nthink that wasn't the worst part it was\none of the bad parts that to this day\nremember\nevery year book i had i would rip out\ntwo pages\nand i would cry in my bathroom even at\nthe age i was at\nbecause he would get his girlfriend to\nadd in\na page of just like just like clowning\non me just like\njust rumors about me into like so like\nin the sections where i'd say most\nlikely to be\nthey would put rumors into me and it was\nthe school joke and they would all\nturn that page and laugh at me and point\nand i would always rip that page out in\nthe bathroom and\nflush it down and just cry but anyways\nat the end of the year i asked uh\n[ __ ] but anyways at the end of the\nyear i remember i asked them strip i was\nlike\nlike why like the [ __ ] like\nyou know what was all this for\nand this was the first honest answer i\ngot\nat least now that from what i know now\nhonest answer that i got\nhe said the reason that i\nthey hated me hear me out here okay and\nwe'll get to why i brought hafu up in a\nsecond here and some others\nhe told me the reason they hated me and\nthe reason they felt they needed to\nbully me is because they felt they\nneeded to bring me down a notch\nliterally word for\nwhat you said earlier they need to bring\nme down a notch they felt when i walked\ninto their school\nthey didn't like that i walked around\nwith my head up high they didn't like\nthe way i\ntalked confidently little did i know\nthis wasn't the case at all i was\ninsecure it's just part of\nwhen i talk i have this deeper voice\nright i might get a little passionate\nand me walking my head up high what the\n[ __ ] it to them if\nlike think about that i want you to\nthink about that\nso i wasn't any of the things they\nattributed to me\nbut because of the way i looked and the\nway i walked\nit's as if i owned the place and they\nfelt like they needed to bring me down a\nnotch\nand that was that was the stem of my\nbullying it wasn't even\nanything that i had done to them it\nwasn't anything that\ni said or that actually disgusted them\nit was the mere fact that i threatened\ntheir\negos because of\nwalking with my head up high and\nit that was the first time i didn't\nunderstand it then but i understand\nclearly now\nand the reason i bring up hofu because\ni'm sure they'll be pushed back on their\nstory a little bit\nbut recently um hof and i started\nplaying among us i'll skip back to\nschool and stuff in a second but half\nand i started playing among us\nand so she's actually a supporter of\nmine i support her she's a friend now\nand\ni respect the hell out of it for\nadmitting this because i think a lot of\npeople feel this way but\nit takes a certain confidence to admit\nit\nhafu literally said word for word what\nethan told me senior year of high school\nshe told me this like two weeks ago like\ni was talking to her about\ndifferent groups why some groups don't\nwant me in there and she literally said\nexactly what it is the looks thing you\nkind of you kind of look like you know\nyou look\nkind of scary the way you talk it's kind\nof intimidating and aggressive\ncomes across as if you had to beat\neveryone's ass like like\nhearing that from her in the message\nwhen i responded i'm like listen\ni i like a piece of me\ni just respected the hell out of her\nbecause this is the vibe i get\ntime and time again from a lot of people\nbut that you you can't\nwhat what man is going to admit that no\nman it goes again if you feel that way\nabout me\nit goes against the very thing to even\nadmit that because if you feel that way\nabout me in the first place it means\nthere's something that's being some\nego that's being triggered right some\ninsecurity\nwhich contradicts the mere fact of ever\nadmitting oh well i don't like you\nbecause\nyou kind of scare me right so no one\never admits it but i think\nthat's like a deeper reflection of it\nall right and i think that's why i'm\nvilified i think that's why a lot of the\nthings that i do\nare kind of devalued they're kind of\nlessened\nand i think so that's why i brought the\nhawfu thing up just to kind of verify\nthe story that i was told in\nsenior year about by my bully\nand yeah so that that was that and then\nyou know college came around and\nsame thing happened in college you know\nwent to college same [ __ ]\nand then i got into the drugs and the\ndrugs were a crazy time\nbut i'll stop there so we can kind of go\nover that stuff i mean\nmaybe now that i think about it maybe i\nshould have went deeper into the high\nschool bullying stuff\ni feel like but whatever go ahead so\ntrain first of all let me start by\nsaying\nthank you so much for sharing man you\nare a phenomenal storyteller\num really yeah oh thank you\nyou know it's interesting because i i\nsee you always make statements whenever\nwe talk about like you know\ndo you get what i'm saying do you hear\nme i think train you're a very clear\ncommunicator\ni i think that you you capture the\nessence of things\nin a way that cannot be wrapped around\nwords\nand so sometimes you have trouble\nfinding the words but i don't think\nit's because you're so if we think about\nit any word\nis a false representation of a real\nthing\ntrue right agreed so i i think sometimes\nyou think you're communicating poorly\nbecause you have trouble finding the\nwords and i think the reason you have\ntrouble finding the words is not because\nyou're dumb\nit's because you're so close to the\ntruth that no word captures it\nthat's right i can't think of that's\nthat's exactly right i'm just like very\nyeah like right and and but i don't\nhave i mean there's basically only been\nonce\nduring the last hour and a half where i\nhaven't been able to follow you and i\nsort of told you right away\nbut i think for the most part like i\nthink you know even at the beginning\nwhen you said i'm nervous i i don't\nthink i'm speaking clear i think you're\nspeaking very clearly\ni think you tell you're a wonderful\nstoryteller\num i i think that you know your life has\na\na narrative to it for sure um\nand and i think it's there's a lot of\nauthenticity there\nthere's a lot of truth there there's a\nlot of pain there\nand there are a lot of adaptations in\nyour story um\nyou know before we get into the drugs\nbecause i i want to just\ntoss out a couple things one is that i\nthink maybe we should save drugs for\nnext time presuming there's an over time\ni do want to share some thoughts with\nyou and i i want to kind of give you\ni i'm curious what you think um i think\nthis is going to be a challenge because\nat this point i feel\nquite confident but that doesn't\nnecessarily mean i'm right but i\ni wouldn't be surprised if you\n[Music]\ndon't see things quite the way that i do\nand\nand the the main reason that i think\nthat like we should maybe talk about\nthis before we get to the drugs is i\nsuspect\nsomething about the drugs has to do\nwith this right so when we think about\naddiction\nand we think about substance use\noftentimes the road to sobriety\nis not through like focusing on the\naddiction it's to focus\non the things that the addiction takes\nadvantage of\ncertainly there's like a neurochemical\nmaybe biological predisposition\nor whatever fine but in my experience\nliterally as an addiction psychiatrist\nit's [ __ ] like this\nthat when you figure this stuff out the\nsubstance use gets way better\nand if it's okay with you trained i'm\ngonna just start talking\nand feel free to jump in yeah go ahead\nbefore\nyou fully go in actually i'll save the\ndrug thing yeah\nfor next time because the drug thing\nisn't directly related to\nthat but it is a little bit anyways yeah\nyes talk go away you talk go ahead just\ngo i find it hard to believe that it's\nnot going to be related because like\nthis is the story\nit is and it's not but yeah okay sorry\nyeah go ahead\nokay so i'm gonna kind of go\nchronologically\nbecause that's the way that my notes are\nmaybe i can collect my thoughts better\nbut i think it'll hopefully come\ntogether\nokay cool so let's actually just start\nwith talking about narcissism for a\nsecond\nokay because i think it's actually an\nimportant discussion so people talk\nabout\nnarcissism narcissists as people\nright like we say that this person is a\nnarcissist\ni don't think that's the right way to\nthink about narcissism i think the way\nto think about narcissism\nis that it's like a particular pattern\nof mind that's in response to something\nelse\nand specifically it's like a defense\nagainst an attack and it's like a\nprotective mechanism\nright when people put you down there's a\npart of you that says no\ni'm more than that right and everyone\nhates me but i'm more than that i'm a\ngood person whatever\nand i think part of the reason that that\nstreamers and i think is it's really\ninsightful\nto me anyway i think it's nuanced the\nway that you understand train that like\nyou know people exhibit\nsymptoms like streamers exhibit symptoms\nof narcissism which aren't about them as\na person\nthey're not narcissists it's part of the\njob something about streaming\nin the world that we live in exhibits\nthat or\nprovokes that kind of behavior which i\nagree with 100 and so maybe the reason i\nthink you're insightful is because we\nagree\num but so i think a lot of what we see\nin narcissistic behavior is because\nfrankly you guys get attacked a lot\nright so\nwhen does narcissism tend to crop up\nit's when you get attacked\nand if you look at celebrities and why\ndo celebrities and streamers and\ninfluencers exhibit narcissistic\nqualities\ni think once you get into the public\nface it's as simple as you get attacked\nmore and when you get attacked more\nyou have more narcissistic defenses\nand and so i just wanted to kind of toss\nthat out because i i do think it makes\nsense and\nwe're actually working on that and\ntrying to understand that and trying to\nsupport\nuh content creators better at healthy\ngamer um\nbut then i want to get to the beginning\nthing which is like this weird\ninsecurity that you have at the\nbeginning of our conversation in the way\nthat\nyou see yourself when you look when you\nlike see yourself right so you said i\nfeel insecure about the way that i talk\nand when i look at myself i see some guy\nwho's falsely confident\nright but i want you to just think about\nhow closely those are tied together\nthat's not actually what you look like\nlike that's absurd bro\nwhat does false confidence even look\nlike you just look like you\nyour perception of false confidence\ncomes from your insecurity\nlike i think those are really the\nperception of false confidence\ncomes from so it's what i'm it's what's\ndrilled in my head\npeople cannot be okay with me being a\nconfident person\nso i try to look into i look at myself\nand through their eyes\ni completely but let's be clear\nit's what you just said it's drilled\ninto your head which means that the\nperception\nof you being a falsely confident person\nis coming from\nyour head it's not coming from the\noutside world i don't doubt that it's\nbeen\ndrilled into your head by external\nevents but this is something i want you\nguys to really understand\nis that external events happen and then\nthey drill into our head\nbut where they live is in your head\nthey don't actually live in the outside\nworld they don't live in the way that\nother people continue to see you\nonce something drills into your head\nthat's where it lives\nand i'm not saying that it's\ninappropriate yeah that it got drilled\ninto your head\ni think there's a so real quick to enter\nin here\nso it's not that it's drilled in my head\nand i believe it it's that so when you\nask the question why\ndo you think people are scared of you\ni'm trying to i'm tr when i answer that\nit's not i'm answering it through\nwhat they're telling me is that makes\nsense it makes sense\nbut just let me finish so i i agree with\nyou so i was going to get to this where\ni know you don't believe it\nand yet you do and we'll get to that\nbecause i i think it's really\ninteresting and i think it can be\nkind of confusing but i i just want to\nlike highlight this point where like i\ncompletely agree and if we listen to\nyour [ __ ] story man\nclearly the world has been sending you\nparticular messages which i think\nlive there now because you even tell us\ni'm really insecure\nyou say it all the [ __ ] time right\nand so if we think about like why are\nyou so insecure\nbecause you're also you're insecure and\nyou're confident at the same time\nyou really strike me as someone who has\na lot of genuine confidence\na lot of genuine compassion a lot of\ngenuine goodness\nand a lot of genuine insecurity and that\nseems like irreconcilable to most people\nbecause they think that\nyou can't be confident and secure and\ninsecure at the same time\nwhereas i think that's the way most\npeople think they think it's like a\nlinear scale but it's not\nyeah you can have parallel insecurity\nwith parallel confidence well i think to\ngo further i think in order to have\nconfidence\nyou must become one or you must become\nor\nyou have to accept your insecurities\nyeah so we'll talk about that\nfrom the acceptance of insecurities and\nthe acceptance of imperfection right i\ncompletely agree so i think your\nconfidence comes from the pers\nacceptance of some insecurities but i\nthink there's other stuff down there\nthat is still affecting you in a\nnegative way which we'll get to\nokay so we're gonna get to this idea of\nlike okay i'm vilified no matter what i\nneed\nwhat i do so i'm gonna just actually\nhighlight a couple of things which i\nthink\nexhibit narcissistic defenses i'm not\ncalling you a narcissist but it's just\nlike\nwhen we're thinking about people who are\nnarcissists like what do they do right\nso one is that yes\num you know one is that you say that\nthings are facts right like you say like\nthis is a fact\nso so like it i mean sort of like yes\nthese events happened\nbut like you know your perceptions of\nthe way that people\nperceive you you view as facts those are\nnot actually facts there are beliefs\nthat are supported by evidence\ndid a doctor actually come to you and\nsay\nhey this guy has a protruding forehead\nwe need to do surgery and i'm like what\nthe [ __ ]\nright and and so so that is a factual\nthing but then\nout of that experience train comes a\nbelief that lives in your mind\nand then you start to think that that\nbelief is a fact\nright because it's supported by so much\nevidence people like you had this deep\nvoice\nteachers told you and then you're coming\nup to us and you're saying look at all\nthe evidence for what i believe\nbut oddly enough train i don't think\nit's actually a fact\ni think all of those things happen to\nyou and i want you to just\ntake a step out of your own shoes and\nlet's think about someone who thinks\nthat they're ugly for example right\nright and like you talk to them and you\nsay like\nbro you're not ugly but they're like no\nthis happened and then this happened\nand then this happened and this happened\ni'm telling you bro i'm ugly the entire\nworld has told me this there are so many\nfacts that make me\ni know i'm ugly it's a fact it's not a\nbelief\nright i'm fully on yeah i'm on same page\nyeah\nand so there are other things that you\ntend to do which is like\nyou know i'm vilified no matter what\nright and like that's kind of weird\nbecause then you also make these\nstatements about\nthey need me to be something and like\nyou you talk a lot about what other\npeople like need you to be\nand so there's a really tricky there's a\nreally subtle ground there which i i\ngenuinely trained i'm gonna say this\nagain i'm not just saying this is a\ndisclaimer i genuinely think you're like\nan awesome compassionate\nnot narcissistic guy but i think that\nyou have an adaptation\nin there that is absolutely something\nlike narcissism\nbut i don't i don't blame you for it i\nthink it's like just think about the\nlife that you've lived\nunless you can be a little bit\nnarcissistic you would have been like\nsmashed to pieces i mean you were\nsmashed to pieces\nyeah right and like it's the only way\nthat you can survive but that\nlingers with you and we'll get to that\nin a second because i think\nthat which has been adaptive for you is\nnow\nstarting to be maladapted and we'll get\nto that\nbut it kind of like there's this really\ntricky thing about like if you say i'm\nvilified no matter what\nthey need me to be this in a sense\nyou gotta it's dangerous territory i'm\nnot saying you do this but i want i want\neveryone who sort of thinks this kind of\nstuff about themselves\nso here's what i'm saying so like like i\nthink i was talking i don't know when we\nleft off so i'm gonna try to just recap\nreal quick\nokay so like if you think about people\nwho have insecurities right they look\nand they think\nthat like they call their insecurities\nfacts and what they do is they assemble\nall this evidence\nright and they say like oh but this\nhappened and then this happened and then\nthis happened and like that's why\nlike i'm not dumb for believing this\nit's a fact\nand i completely agree i don't think\nyou're dumb for believing it but let's\nbe clear that it's not necessarily a\nfact it's just a belief\nand it's a powerful belief it's a\njustifiable belief but it's still a\nbelief\nand and now i want to get to this idea\nof like i'm vilified no matter what\nbecause that's a really dangerous tight\nrope to walk i\ni sort of agree with what you're saying\nbut i think that there's a\npotential for a different way to look at\nit which is that when you start to say\ni'm vilified no matter what it starts to\ndiscount\nwho you actually are right you're saying\nthat the\nthe the connection between who i am and\nhow the world treats me\nis completely independent and so the the\ntricky thing there is if you start to\nbelieve that about yourself\nthen in a weird way you start to become\nyou start to lack power over\ninto them and they chose to hate you\nanyway so that got drilled into your\nwhole\nyour head and then you have that belief\nthat's swimming around which is like\nyou know like people don't\nlike me and i'm vilified no matter what\nand the last thing that i want to kind\nof point out here is that when you say\ni'm vilified no matter what and you say\nand i ask you\nhow do you feel about that you say it's\nkind of funny\nright if you really stop and think about\nit like that's not funny at all\nlike if i if i am talking to a kid and\nthe kid says no matter what i do\nmy parents like hit me\ni can't make them happy like that's not\nfunny\nbeing vilified no matter what you do\nlike being i know you've like donated\nand supported a bunch of streamers\nyou try to support your community you're\nsuper authentic\nlike i think you're genuinely a good guy\nand\nand for you to be treated like that is\nnot funny\nand and we kind of we kind of even hear\nlike how that happens because then you\nsay\ni've adapted to it right i thrive off of\nit\ni've adapted to being hated it's fuel\nfor me\nand you start to feel uncomfortable\nwhen people like start to respect you\nand and and that's where we get into\nreally\ntricky territory because this is where\nsometimes a hypothesis\ncould emerge here and one is that it\nreminds me of something called the\nrepetition compulsion\nwhich is like this idea that we tend to\nlike repeat things that are even kind of\nbad for us\nbecause we have this compulsion to do\nsomething\nover and over and over again and\nwhat that means is that i i really\nwonder actually whether you self\nsabotage\nand what you're kind of saying is that\nlike you know i felt really good after\ndoing this\nthis like fundraiser and you feel good\nabout yourself and then two days later\nand then i ask you what happens after\nthat\nand your response is i start to say\nstupid stuff but i think in a weird way\ni wonder whether what's going on is like\nit's uncomfortable territory for you and\nlike\nyou're way more comfortable being hated\nand we'll get to\nwhy that is and we even said that right\nlike you said that like the\nthe hate fuels me and you kind of say\nthat if we listen to the narrative what\nyour narrative is is like\nbeing hated has been my source of\ntriumph it's how i grew as a person\nit's how i understand who i was it's how\ni like learned strength\nand like what my true value is it's also\nhow you support\nother people because your message to\nother people is that if life is not\ntreating you well and people aren't\ntreating you well\nyou can grow past that it's become such\na core aspect of who you are\nto be hated and that your strength comes\nfrom being hated\nwhich begs a very important question\nwhich we'll get to later which is like\nwhat happens if you're not hated and\nthis is where i'm gonna give you a\nlittle\nspoiler right so like what is the one\nthing train that i've said to you that\nyou have not liked\nthat you pity me absolutely\nright and it's kind of weird because\nlike like why do i pity you like pity\nthat that comes from compassion it comes\nfrom like\nholy [ __ ] man do you just realize like\nwhat your life is like\nhow is pity not an appropriate or fair\nresponse\nand i think the reason you hate it so\nmuch is because like that it's a\ndifferent narrative\nbecause if we respond to you with\ncompassion\nthen like this person that you become\ncomes tumbling down because this person\nwas born of hate\nit's strength through adversity it's\ntriumph and you absolutely have man\ndon't get me wrong i'm with you 100\ni think it's amazing what you've\naccomplished because you could have\ngotten turned into like a little piece\nof nothing\nyou could have gotten bulldozed by the\nworld but you didn't\nlet that happen and the hate became part\nof your fuel it became part of your\nstrength\nand so if i try to be compassionate\ntowards you if i try to pity which like\nfrankly bro i mean come on like what do\nyou expect man\nyou don't think that you deserved pity\nyou don't think that you people didn't\nmistreat you and of course you do and\nthis is why\ni think these things can exist in\nparallel\nbut i think it's challenging because if\ni pity you then\nthe adaptation that you've created for\nyourself doesn't hold anymore\nand now it becomes really really\ndangerous territory\nand one of the things that just pops\ninto my head is like\nwhat would have happened to you if you\nwere 15 and one person came up to you\nand maybe this did happen\nand we can explore that down the road\nbut it's just kind of a hypothesis i\nstill have other things i want to say\nif one person came up to you and be like\nman it's really shitty how other people\nare treating you\nyou don't deserve to be treated this way\nit's not your fault\ni would take care of them to the end of\ntime to me that to me that's\nto me that's loyalty and that's that's\njust like decent that's being good\nyou say that right and if i but if i say\nthat to you if i say train you didn't\ndeserve that\ni'm sorry this happened to you what's\nyour response to that\ni would say i appreciate it but it's not\na big deal i got through it\nexactly right so like that's what i'm\nsaying i i ask you hypothetically if\nthis had happened you say one thing\nand then i actually say it to you and\nyour response is something else\ndo you see that\nyes and it's really strange right like\nit's like\nlike you expect one thing to happen but\nyou don't actually respond that way\nyou don't actually respond that way to\ncompassion\ni mean you have because i think that's\nwhy you treasure hafu so much is because\nshe said something to you that was\nincredibly validating right\nshe said they treat you this way because\nof what you like you know so\nso we'll get we'll get there i think\nit's just something we can explore down\nthe road\nyep um\nyeah i mean i i think that\nyeah so like the other thing is that i\nthink we as twitch\nwe actually propagate a lot of this\nstuff\nin a way that is not good for you and\nthe best example that i can think of is\nwhen you went to the bathroom\nboy did we have a field day with it\nright and i i think it's it's\ninteresting because you've become such a\nstrong person and you've learned how to\nlaugh it off\nbut i still think that like you know i\nwe're [ __ ] toxic to you man\nright and that's not okay even though\nyou laugh it off like\nwhen you go into the bathroom and people\nmake start making jokes about you\nsnorting lines of coke like\nwe all laugh about it right and it's\nokay but i think on some level\nthat hurts on some level that hurts\nyou've just learned how to deal with\nthat hurt so well\nand in fact as you've said you use that\nhatred as fuel you use that hurt as fuel\nand i know you're okay with it because\nyou joke about it but i think on\nsome level no you're right on some so\nbecause i've started banning it recently\nso i'm\nif you're joking about it i'm cool with\nthe joke\nthe problem is there are people now that\nthey're using it as something to devalue\nthe work i put in right so those are the\npeople i'm trying to get away from so\nlike\nif you use it as an inside joke within\nthe community i'm cool with it i\nunderstand it you know it's funny i'm\ngoing in the back you know every second\ni'm coming back doing long streams it's\nfunny the problem is there are people\nthat are now\nusing it to devalue the work i put in\nor devalue a lot of different things\nthat i do\nand at the end of the day i know deep\ndown they know i'm not doing it but it's\nwhat they\nit's all they have to grab onto\nthat's negative at that moment they do\nthose are the people i try to get out of\nthe community i banned them from\nmisusing it does that make sense\ni think that makes a lot of sense and i\nstill think that on some level\neven the the more benign jokes\neven if it's not intended to like hurt\nand we're saying it all in good fun and\nwe take that cue from you\ni think that you think things that are\nlike objectively painful\nare kind of funny and i think that like\nwe need to be more careful and i'm\ncertainly going to be more careful\nabout joining in when you're\nself-deprecating\nright and if you really stop and think\nabout it and this happens a lot where\nlike\nyou put yourself down and then everyone\nelse puts you down too and then like you\nguys all have a good laugh about it\nand it feels protective but it at the\ncore of that\nis like a tiny insecurity that people\nare reinforcing\nright it's kind of like if you're the\nfat kid in the group and then everyone's\nlike oh ho ho this person is the fat kid\nright and you're like ha ha because like\nthat's how we learn how to adapt right\nwe're like\nif you can't beat them join them and\nthen you join them\nin making fun of yourself and then like\nyou're still making fun of yourself but\nyou're not alone anymore right\nat least you've got a team you guys are\nall joking about something together\nand that can feel really good it can\nfeel like you're not isolated anymore\nit's why this dynamic happens all the\ntime\nbut at this end of the day there's still\na group of people yourself included\nwho are like making fun of you for being\nfat\nright on some level i really\nhypothesize that there's something there\nthat's actually like we're bullying you\nand you're\ngiving us permission to and there's\nsomething about that that when i really\nstop and think about it like i think\nthat needs to change\nand can i can i just keep going\nyes okay so the other thing that i want\nto get to is like this this thing when\nyou punched someone\nand then you suddenly became popular\nright like you were crying in the\nbathroom every day and then you punch\nthis kid and then suddenly you're the\nhottest [ __ ] in the world\nand like you rode that you took\nadvantage of it but i think that\nactually sends a really dangerous\nmessage which goes back to\ni'm vilified no matter what because then\nyou realize it's the same [ __ ]\nmessage which is that\nwho i am as a person does not determine\nhow other people treat me\ni'm vilified no matter what and i'm\nrespected for all the wrong reasons\nboth of them are very dangerous messages\none on with one you're on top and with\none you're on bottom\nand one of them seems really positive\nand one of them feels really toxic\ni think they're both equally bad because\nwhat\nwhat that reinforced for you is that\nrespect\ndoes not come from your actions\nit doesn't come from your intentions it\ndoesn't come from what you do\nit just comes from random ass [ __ ] and\nhatred also comes from random ass [ __ ]\nthat is outside of my control\nand so i think that's a dangerous mask\nto reinforce\nit's a dangerous world for you to have\ni agreed and then\nyou know you kind of keep on talking\nabout like it happens all over like in\nthe ninth grade\nand then like later on and with ethan or\nwhatever and so i think like these\nthemes about\nyou know who you are and how other\npeople appreciate you or how other\npeople treat you and who you truly are\nthere's like a fundamental disconnect\nthere\num and\nand i think it puts you in a really\ntricky spot because at this point like i\ndon't think you can take the mask off\ni don't think you can stop being\nadaptive in this way because\nbecause like the the converse of it is\nlike terrifying\nand i'm telling you train and i know\nthis is gonna be triggering for you but\nlike\ni'm telling you like you deserve pity\nman like what the [ __ ]\nlisten just think about the story that\nyou've told us\nand imagine that someone in your view\nyou do these things you do these streams\nwhere like your viewers call in\nright and like they tell you and you try\nto help them through their problems\nand if anyone had told you this story\nyou would respond to them with\ncompassion and pity\nbut you'll be damned if anyone responds\nto you that way\nwhich goes back to narcissism because\nyou're different and this is really\ninteresting because\ni think these things exist in parallel i\ndon't think they're actually like in\nconflict\nyou recognize that you are a normal\nperson\nand you believe that to the core of your\nbeing you [ __ ] just like everyone else\nyou eat just like everyone else you have\ngood days and you have bad days just\nlike\neveryone else but then parallel to that\nis this overwhelming story that you have\nin your mind that you're\nnot like everyone else and you have so\nmuch evidence for that when other people\nwhen someone looks at someone else and\nit's the soda popping story right like\nthey get the benefit of the doubt but\nyou don't get the benefit of that you\ngot the sloping forehead they called you\nt-rex\nyou know [ __ ] doctor told you to get\nsurgery on your forehead\nand how can you say that you're like\neveryone else because your entire life\nyou've been told\nthat you're different you've been judged\nfor being different\nyou've been judged for [ __ ] that you did\nnot do you've been judged unfairly\nand how can you say like we are like\neveryone else\nand you tell us over and over and over\nagain that i'm different\nright and like like so it's weird\nbecause those\ntwo things exist in in parallel as well\nand and can i keep going\nwe good yeah okay please yeah so like\nlike then there's just a couple of other\njust kind of random thoughts right like\nat the height of the emotional bullying\nyou said i i\nlike when you were kind of talking about\nit and you said like i was an idiot\nright like when people were treating you\nso bad you say i was an idiot i was dumb\nand i was nice to them\nand it was confusing to them and that's\nthat sort of like really rubs me the\nwrong way because\ni i don't doubt that on some level it's\nstupid but like\ni think there's something really\nself-deprecating about\ncalling yourself an idiot when people\nare being\nvitriolic towards you you're saying i\nwas dumb because i was nice to them like\ni think i don't think that was dumb i\nthink that's like\nthat's you your true character shining\nthrough\nand it's so devastating because this is\na time in your life where people are\ntreating you badly and you're like the\nessence of like turning the other\ncheek and trying to be nice to them and\ntrying to be like a good person and you\nget punished for it\nand holy [ __ ] what does that tell you\nabout goodness in the world\nright it paints a really bleak picture\nthat you were nice to your abuser\nand like that sounds like a [ __ ]\nabusive relationship right where it's\nlike\nyou know someone abuses you and you're\nlike oh i'm so sorry like let me bake\nyou a cake\nand and i think this is going to be hard\nfor you to hear because you don't\nthat's too victim card right like you\ndon't want to own\nthat you were a victim like you want to\nown that you were a victim and you've\nrisen above it but you don't want anyone\nspitting\nand i i think that like this is really\ntricky because like i think there's a\nnuance here where\ni wish you lived in a world train where\ni could pity you\nand still respect you and i think that's\nwhat it comes down to\nthat i can pity you and i actually\nrespect you all the more because of what\nhappened\nbut don't take away my right to be\ncompassionate because you've been hurt\nand that you didn't deserve it and that\nthe world does treat you differently and\nthat's\nthat's what's so [ __ ] heartbreaking\nman is because\non the inside you're exactly the same as\neveryone else and you keep telling us\nthat\nover and over and over again and on the\noutside\nno one treats you like everyone else\nyour voice your stature and what is it\nlike to live a life where you\nare like everyone else but no one treats\nyou like everyone else\nwhere you're vilified no matter what\nlike if that doesn't deserve\npity and if that isn't heartbreaking and\nif that isn't soul crushing i don't know\nwhat is\nand so this is where i i think the last\nthing i've got like just one or two\nother thoughts and one is like\nthis whole thing about devaluing pity\nand you're like i don't want you all to\nthrow me a pity party and i was like bro\nthat's exactly what you deserve\nif anyone on this earth deserves a pity\nparty it's you\nright and like i wish you could\nget to the point where like you could\nunderstand that you deserve\npity and you deserve people saying like\nman that sucks for you\nthat like even earlier i asked you like\nwhat would you have said back then if\nsomeone said you don't deserve this\nyou've been like i would attract to that\nperson forever and then when i say it\nyou're like i'm insulted\nright that i mean it's it's like apples\nand oranges because you won't\nlet us you won't let us say that to you\nyou reject it from us you don't want us\nto throw a pity party\nbut this is the thing i i i want you to\nunderstand this if you can\nthat if we throw you a pity party it\ndoesn't mean that\nyou we're devaluing any of your\naccomplishments i think it's like\ni think both of those can exist right we\ncan say train like\ni mean you were [ __ ] bullied your\nentire [ __ ] life\nright and you had a lot of you have a\nlot of things to be grateful for in life\nyou had really supportive parents you\nhad really awesome parents\nright you can really like have a\nsupportive community and twitch loves\nyou\nand at the same time like we can also\nhold these two\ncontrary truths because you hold them in\nyourself every day\nthat you're confident and you're\ninsecure you're genuinely confident\nand you're a pile of insecurities and so\nwhat i'd love for you to do is to\nactually just be confident\nto let go of those insecurities and i\nthink the reason you can't let go of\nthose insecurities\nis because you've built a narrative of\nyourself of like triumph\nand hate is what propels me forward so\nlike you can't\nget anything from us except for hate\nbecause it's terrifying because if we\nstop hating you then where does your\nfuel come from where does your strength\ncome from\nwhere does your triumph come from and\nthat's why you hate being pity because\nwe like\nif we turn that hate into love then your\nadaptive strategy in life gets no fuel\nand where this becomes maladaptive is\nthat if you\npropagate that hatred by saying an\noff-color thing or things like that\nand i think you really struggle with\nthis and we'll see maybe this is where\ni'm really\nwalking on shaky ground is that like\nthat's your fuel right so i think on\nsome level you probably do some things\nto self-sabotage\nbecause that's what we do when we build\nup adaptive mechanisms early in life\nand we figure out okay hatred fuels me\nlike how on earth just think about that\ncompletely hypothetically for a second\nif i tell you train there's a guy\nwhose triumph and success and strength\nand self-worth are born of hatred of\nother people\ndo you think that person is going to do\nsomething to evoke hatred\nit's interesting possibly yeah because\nthat's how you fill up your gas tank\nand i think if we think about moving\nforward for you\nright so i get that this is all a house\nof cards that i'm building right so it\ncould be all [ __ ] wrong\nso i accept that but if i think about\nmoving forward to you\nfor you i think that you've got to\nunderstand that like some of these\nconceptions that you have for the world\nwere absolutely what you needed to\nsurvive\nabsolutely put you where you are today\nand you can let them go what i\nimagine is that when you were when you\nwent into middle school\nyou reached a river\nand then you built this raft and you\nused the raft to cross the river\nand then you looked at yourself and you\nsaid you know what without\nthat raft i would have never crossed\nthis river so now that you're on the\nother bank you pick up the raft you put\nit above your head and you start walking\nand then people like train why are you\ncarrying that raft around and you're\nlike without the raft i would have never\ncrossed the river and it's like\nyeah man but you've crossed the river\nyou don't need it anymore\nyou don't need to have your strength be\nfueled by hatred of other people\nbecause you have intrinsic value that is\nso much more than that\nyou don't need their hate anymore\nyou've grown past it you just don't need\nit like you're amazing because of who\nyou are\nyour strength may be born of hatred or\nbeen fueled by hatred but now\nthat adaptation has become maladaptive\nand i i don't know i don't know if you\nself-sabotage yourself but like this is\nthe kind of thing\nthat leads to self-sabotage\nhypothetically this is what i've seen\nthat you start to build a narrative\nabout yourself that is\npositive and protective in so many ways\nbut is built on a foundation of\nrot and you just think about i don't\nknow if you have kids or not but like\nyou think about your parents or you\nthink about the kids that you're gonna\nhave one day or the kids that you\nalready have\ni don't know and do you like what would\nyour dad say or what would your mom say\nif you said you know i need hatred to\nsucceed\nand would they want that kind of life\nbecause here's the crazy thing train\nhere's the crazy thing\ni think that your strength is not born\nof hatred\ni think your strength is just you baby\nit's just you\nand it's not that the hatred is where\nyour strength comes from\nit's that you're so [ __ ] strong and\nhatred was so ubiquitous\nfor such a long part of your life that\nyou started to tie those two things\ntogether\nyou got bullied over and over and over\nagain\nand you rose above it and so then you\nlook back and you say without hatred i\nwould be nother\nwhereas i say you were something before\nthat hatred and the hatred tried to\nknock you down and it failed\nand i think the more that you start to\nthink in that way the more you realize\nyou don't need hatred\nyou don't need to be provocative and i\nthink i you know that right and like\nthis is the weird thing is that\nthe crazy thing is that you have within\nyou\ntwo trains right one is the train that\nwe all see\nand one is the train who walked into the\nsixth grade\nwith your shoes and your glasses and\nwhatnot that\nkid you carry that kid with you and\nthat's your insecurity\nthe kid who walked up to your friend and\nsaid hey can i eat lunch with you he's\nlike you don't get to eat lunch with us\nwhen you look at your an image of\nyourself and you see false confidence\nthat's the kid who's who gives you that\nimpression\ni don't see false confidence i see real\nconfidence\nthat's the kid that i protect yeah does\nthat make sense\nabsolutely that's the kid that i have to\nbe strong for right\nso it doesn't happen to other does that\nmean so like i am\ni see myself as a i don't know\nso here's the problem train when you\nprotect that kid\nthat kid can never get confident in\nthemselves\nyeah you fight that battle for that kid\nyou've got to stop protecting that kid\nthat kid is stronger than you think\nbut you never give him a chance that's\nwhat i'm saying\nyou think you have to protect that kid\nis the source of your strength man it's\nnot hatred\nhe's the one who's been strong from the\nbeginning\nand the only problem is that kid doesn't\nknow that he doesn't need your help\nbecause you never give him a chance to\nlike explore it you never let him play\non the field so he never realizes what\nhe's good at\nall he sees is himself is that i'm the\nkid who's in the bathroom\nbathroom and i've got train the guy who\nbroke that guy's nose\nhe's going to protect me and you're both\nof those people\nbut he's stronger than you no because\nhe's [ __ ] you\nthose are the same kid yep\nyou don't need to protect him he doesn't\nneed your protection\ni know it's weird that's what i've got\nyeah that was about yeah\nyeah yes yes\nyeah yeah yeah i mean\nit's yeah you know\nit's it's not that i don't think the kid\nthat kid is weak it's that\ni know i was that kid and i know what i\nwent through\nto get to who i am today\nand it's not that i use hate as fuel\nit's that i know how to\ntransfer it into positivity\nbecause of the love my parents gave me\nso i got so even though\nwhen i was bullied i was loved equally\nor greater by my parents at home\nwithout their love i would probably\nbecome some sort of [ __ ] serial\nkiller by now with how much i was pushed\naround right\nso it's their love that that's why you\ns that's why you see so many parallels\nthat are completely contradictory to\neach other\nit's because at home my parents gave me\neverything\nthat they could every like they gave me\nlove greater than love itself\nand then at school i got\nthe darkest of hate so\nthat's where the two sides built up\nthese two polarizing sides where i saw\nsociety for what it was in that moment\nand i saw what controlled it what\nmanipulated it one punch\nsuddenly i'm the greatest human being\nand any any deed i do\nis seen as you know the hero the hero we\nneed\nbut before i could do the greatest of\nthings and i'm a [ __ ] loser\nbut because i punch what the right kid\nin the nose i am the hero we need i am\nfor the people\nand that is just the most disgusting way\nand it just that's just the way i see\nthat today\nstill though today to this very day that\nis\nhow i see society work that is how i see\nthe general public accept\ndifferent people and it makes\nno sense to me so it's not the fact that\ni'm carrying this around\nfor no reason everything that happened\nto me in that day\nin those days it's not that it's still\nhappening to me it changes that i\nsee that it's that's how people are\noperating train train bro\nright exactly so let me let me just\nrepeat to you what you said\nit's not that i'm carrying it around for\nno reason\nyou're damn right and that's why it's\nhard to put it down\nbecause you have a really good reason\nyou learned a lot about the world and\nthat's why it's hard to move let it go\nright because you have like i s like\nthat's it man and i i don't know how\nlike\ni think your your conception of yourself\nis perfect like you're right\ni think you you saw\nunconditional love on one side and\nunconditional hate on the other\nand those were polar opposites and i\nthink what you've got to do is like\nlearn to integrate and very simply\nvery simply train you could say whatever\nyou want to you can hypothesize\npsychoanalyze whatever\nat the end of the day if you cannot\naccept the pity and compassion of\nanother person\nthat's a problem\ni i can't accept it under one thing\nthough\ni and this could be crazy but i don't\nthink it is\ni i can accept pity and compassion\nif it's coming from someone that\nunderstands but if i'm just accepting\npitting compassion for the sake of it\nbeing the right thing to do\nbut there was no understanding i i find\nthat as\na cheap pity it's something that it's\nit's not going to\nthe only way we fix what's going on is\nthrough understanding what's going on so\nif you want to have pity because you\nunderstand what's going on\nand that pity is coming from a place of\nmeaning\nthen i will accept that and i will be\nvery happy and i'll i'll take care of\nyou right because\nthat's that's very meaningful to me i've\nnever felt like i've ever deserved it\nbut if you see that and you feel that\nthen i appreciate that\nbut if it's just this you know i feel\nlike pity these days is like a [ __ ]\nbirthday card\nright it's like no one actually means\nthe happy birthday man like hey\ni'm happy you're here no one means that\nit's just a happy birthday bro\ni mean it's just like a thing that\nyou've been you know a programmed to say\nevery birthday regardless of if you even\nknow the [ __ ]\nindividual right there's a difference\nbetween meaning it understanding it\nbeing about it\nthan just saying it because you're\nprogrammed to say because society's\nprogrammed you to do it right\nso it's that pity that i don't accept\nbecause i know\nthey don't truly care or understand\nwhat they mean when they're saying they\npity me for what's going on\nright and it's that i don't want to\nencourage or perpetuate that because\nthat is the\nvery problem that led me to be where i\nam yeah yeah makes perfect sense so so\nnow we're going on to dangerous\nterritory and by dangerous territory\nwhat i mean is that\ni think we're quickly reaching the point\nwhere the problem is subtle\nand i'm going to amplify it but i don't\nthink it's a big problem\nor arguably it is okay so like does that\nmake sense like\ni'm going to make a mountain out of a\nmolehill here but i'm going to do it on\npurpose\ngo ahead so the problem is that you got\nto just really pay attention okay\nbecause when you say\ni can accept pity from someone who\nunderstands makes perfect sense i'm with\nyou right\nwhat's wrong with that that there's a\nlot of false pity in the world and that\neverything is like birthday cards\ninstead of like authentic it's like sort\nof you know\nvirtue signaling kind of stuff i'm with\nyou there too\nnow why is this a problem for you it's a\nproblem because you got to remember\nthat like the\nin your mind there's a fundamental\ndisconnect\nbetween how the world perceives you and\nhow\nyou feel you are and you believe that\nthe world\nfundamentally misperceives you and that\nyou're vilified no matter what\nand some first impression yes and so the\nreal\nchallenge there is that coming from such\na skeptical\nit's been drilled into you i love that\nphrase it's been drilled into you\nthat people are going to misjudge you\nand not give you the benefit of the\ndoubt\nand the problem that with that is that\nif you doubt\nother people's judgments of you i think\nthere's a lot of\nauthentic pity and compassion that you\nview as a birthday card\nwell well just to clarify i don't say\nany of these things out right it'd be\nvery rude to like\ndiscount someone's compassion but it's\njust like it's kind of like a vibe you\nfeel right\ni understand i'm not talking about you\nsaying anything what i'm saying is that\nlike like\nso there's a there's a kid crying in the\nbathroom\nwho still lingers in you and manifests\nlike he bubbles up\nhis insecurities right and what i'm\nsaying is like\ni think that there's a layer i mean\nyou've done phenomenal training you've\ndone amazing\nyou've you're a statistical outlier so\nyou don't need to do anything else you\ncan just keep being you baby you're\nbeautiful\nand at the same time i envision a world\nwhere you could live with fewer of those\ninsecurities\ni envision a world where that [ __ ]\nrelentless thought process of\nself-judgment and sounding stupid\nand are people following you and you\nworrying so much of that or you could be\nfreed of that and you can just\ntalk right where you can understand that\nlike sometimes you're going to stay\nstupid [ __ ] for for the most part what\ncomes out of your mouth\nis like intelligent and understandable\nand has value and people could see you\nfrom that\nthat's what i'm talking about in terms\nof forward momentum\nto be free of that insecurity i'm not\nsaying the insecurity screws you\ni'm not saying it holds you back from\nsucceeding in life i'm not saying that\nyou're not\nyou know you're you're a force for good\nin spite of that insecurity\nso right now your adaptation has been\nso much in spite of something negative\nright strength in spite of toxicity now\nyou think that this maybe the toxicity\nfuels the strength i think it's in spite\nof and what i'm saying is that\nthe next layer which is more subtle\nbecause you're not you know you're not\nunable to have a job and things like\nthat right\na lot of people like forward momentum is\nlike really concrete for them they need\nto find a job they need to find a\nrelationship whatever i think you've\ngot a lot of stuff solved at least as\nfar as i can tell\nbut the next level this is challenging\nis really more spiritual growth\nit's about unburdening your mind of this\ninsecurity\nand i think the way to do that has\nsomething to do with accepting people's\npity\nit has something to do with letting go\nof the perception that people don't give\nyou the benefit of the doubt even though\nit could be true\ni don't doubt it's been true i mean\nobviously right\nbut at the same time like you don't the\ninsecurity so so that can be true but\nthe conditioning\nthat that creates in your mind does not\nhave to be true\nif that makes sense the external fact\nin the world can be true but the\nthe scars that that does for you can be\nlet go\nand that i feel very strongly right you\ncan be a physically\nugly person you can be someone that is\nnot\ndesired by people that you're attracted\nto\nand you can also let go you can accept\nthat fact\nand still feel good about yourself\nwe all have weaknesses we all have\nshortcomings\nright like yes yes and like that can be\na factual statement of truth\nwithout it creating like these scars in\nyour mind which you carry around\nand that's what i want you to let go i'm\nnot going to dispute\nthat your voice is deep i'm not going to\ndispute that you have a prominent\nforehead in a prominent nose\nyou know i'm not going to disbe fine but\nwhatever that means to you i dispute\nbecause disputing that is useless\nme too that's why i don't change them\nthat's why i like the way they are\ni think it's just me i'm stepping\noutside of me\nto explain to you what i think others\nsee it's not necessarily a pro so i\nunder so i understand like on a simple\nlevel\nwhy that would be a projection of my own\ninsecurities within\nbut here's why i believe it's not\nso everything i told you of why i\nbelieve others\nfeel the way they do about me isn't a\nprojection of insecurity of my\nown things it's literally\nfive six years of trial and error\nresearch like\nin my research i mean like a\nlight-hearted like asking like yo what's\ngoing on here what's up right like\ndoes that make any sense it seems as if\nit seems like\nso for example the the example you gave\nearlier of\nyou know calling the person fat or\nwhatever right it seems like\nwhat is said about me or what i'm told i\nam\nthat's negative if i accept it\nthen it's like okay good thank god he\nsees it\nif i don't accept it it's like oh you're\na terrible [ __ ] cocky narcissistic\nperson right\nand then somebody else right let's go to\nsomeone else that's uh not\nin my shoes right if someone says\nsomething terrible and they accept it\nit's like no don't say that about\nyourself you're good right that pity\nnaturally that instinctive pity of a\ndecent person\nautomatically turns on it's like no\ndon't say about yourself you're good\nyou're not this you're not that you're\nnot this\nbut in my situation from most of my\nexperiences\nit's like i need to accept the fact that\ni am this thing that people are telling\nme\nand if i don't then i'm some cocky evil\nmonster that needs to be put down a\nnotch\nthis is like countless time and time\nagain now do i have positive\nreinforcement in my community yes do i\nhave positive people in my life yes do i\nhave\ncomments that are very nice to me one\nhundred percent\ni'm not referring to people who have\ngotten the time to know me people that\ngone\nknow me have said the things that you\nsay obviously on a much more like just\nsimpler level obviously\nyour assessment is flattering and very\nnice and it's a lot more\ncomplex and i like that but they do\nsupport\nit's i'm everything i'm referring to\ni'm referring to the first time\nimpressioners i'm referring to first\nimpression\non this site and in this world first\nimpression\nis everything and what i'm saying is\nthere is no first impression that comes\nfrom me\nit's an automatically like thing it's\nsomething that's just in their mind\nit's like they look at me and it\nautomatically fears instilled within\nthem\nand there's this this this thing where i\nneed to be brought down\ninstantly i need to be brought down a\nnotch this guy is too cocky\nhe thinks does that make any sense it\nmakes a lot of sense so train i'm gonna\nhave to get going because i have to\ncover for we have a thing where we\ntrain and i mean sorry support our\ncoaches so i have to do some coaching\nsupport\nround four then next week uh yeah two\nweeks reach out to zank\nbut i want to just leave this with you\nso i i don't get cool i don't disagree\nat all because you're talking about\nother people's impressions of you so\nhere's what i want you to look at\nokay i'm not concerned about that yeah\nwhat i'm concerned about and what i'd\nlove for you to pay attention to\nis your reaction to that\nit's your conditioning to that it's\nhow does it feel to be a human being who\nwalks this earth\nand when people look at him you're like\na hunchback\noh complete [ __ ] yeah right and like\nthat's that's what we've gotta like\nbecause\nwhen you when you sit with like when you\nkind of think about that like that's\nthe kid like i was like i gotta think\nthat there's some overlap between that\nfeeling\nand like the way you felt when you're\nwhen your friend tyler comes\nturns to you and you oh no it's the same\nfeeling it's the same feeling yeah\nyou're right\nit's it's a perfect overlap it's the\nsame exact feeling yes so here's the\ncrazy thing man\nthat feeling doesn't come from the way\nthat they look at you\nthat feeling is an echo of\ntyler telling you that it's the feeling\nthat you carry with you that's the raft\nmy dude\nso you're saying that no matter how much\npeople doubt me hate me or\nwhatever i don't need to feel the way\nthat i do i can just be like a [ __ ]\nwho gives a [ __ ] like are you saying i\ncan get to that point like\n[ __ ] him it's not even oh [ __ ] em you're\nnot gonna have that reaction\nthat's the raft you're carrying you've\nbeen carrying that raft\never since you walked into the bathroom\nand ate that lunch on the first day\nyou were judged unfairly that feeling of\nunfair\njudgment irrespective of how you look\nnot it's it's the raft bro and you can\nset that down i know it's\nmind-boggling but that's exactly what\ni'm saying yes\nyou can live a life where you can meet\nanother person and the first thought in\nyour head is not oh [ __ ]\nnow i have to do this thing where\nthey're going to judge me and i have to\nlike wait until they get to know me\nyou can live a life that is\nthat's what i have to listen i have to\nliterally in these new groups\ni have to like literally like i have to\nlike talk like this you're ready for\nthis i'm like\noh no you're good man like everything's\nokay like i have to do that\notherwise i'm just automatically this\nterrible [ __ ] right like i can't like\nhey\nmy man that's not cutting it like that\nsuddenly is i'm at war but i'd be like\nyo\nyou're good don't worry about it man\nlike everything's okay i do this like\nreinforcement\nlow higher my pitch in my voice it's\nthis weird [ __ ] i don't understand it\nbut the fact that i do it and it works\nproves everything that i'm saying like\nwhat the [ __ ] yeah so so train i i just\nunderstand how like frustrating that is\nthat like all this action\nall of my actions are thrown out and\nthen\nthe entire cure to it all is to hire my\nvoice a little bit\ncome off less confident and suddenly i'm\na good person now\nbut all my actions that prove otherwise\nto my physical features are irrelevant\nthey're thrown out it doesn't matter\ndude do you\nbut as soon as i do something that makes\npeople feel better about that\nyeah do you realize how shitty it is to\nlive a life\nwhere instead of being yourself you have\nto be some caricature of what you think\nother people want\nit's exhausting like what do you think i\nmean when i say you're carrying a raft\naround\nit's heavy and you carry it every day\nand what i'm telling you is if that\nfeeling is exactly the same\nthis is just the way the mind works it's\nan echo\nif you go back and you help that kid\nthat feeling\nwill dissolve like what do you think\nprocessing a trauma\nis like literally there's a field\nof treatment for ptsd but doesn't that\nbut doesn't that in itself be\nbefore we wrap up here doesn't that in\nitself the mere fact\nlike even even if i put the raft down\nlet's put the raft down and i stopped\ncaring about it or stopped reacting to\nit i want to ask you this question\nthat very effect that is coming from\nwhat i just explained\nhow all of my actions are thrown out who\ncares of the action it's about the talk\nit's about how you present yourself in a\nsuperficial form\nthat dictates whether people believe in\nyou trust you or like you like does that\nitself kind of show you how primitive\nand barbaric\nwe as humans are in a way like on a\ncertain layer like i can put the wrath\ndown as much as we want but it doesn't\nchange the fact\nthat this is the this is this is what is\nresulting\nright like this is happening how does it\ni'll ask you for the third and final\ntime\nhow does it feel to be vilified no\nmatter what you do\nit pisses me the [ __ ] off it's not funny\nyeah no it pisses me the [ __ ] off it\nlegitimately pisses me off\nright it makes me angry it makes me\nangry\nnow it makes me mad yeah now we're\ngetting somewhere\nyeah it makes me very very angry\nno it's because what people want what\ni'm sorry to cut you off what i hear\npeople\nwant is directly contradictory\nto to to to their to their own\nactions so let me explain what i mean by\nthat\nright people want a world where they're\naccepted people want a world\nwhere you know good is done where\npeople are taken care of where people\nare being nice to each other right\nthey want that but they don't realize\nthat they are the very\nproblem that is stopping them from\nhaving what\nthey want themselves do you want to\ntrain what's everything\nto grow up in a world surrounded by\nthose kinds of people\nbut it's all of us every human being if\nthey came to this understanding\nwhat's it like to grow up in a world\nsurrounded by other people like that\n[ __ ] infuriating absolutely now we're\ngetting somewhere\nbut i can't do anything about it so\nthat's why i just try to stay consistent\nwith my actions\nand in the back of my mind i keep that\nhaters\ni do not accept that you can't do\nanything about it\nwell i do slang about it but what i'm\nsaying is i can't\ninsert it into their minds like they're\ngoing to learn in 20 years of time\nyou don't need to do [ __ ] in their minds\nsolving this problem comes from here\nit comes from you i know it sounds\nabsolutely crazy\nbut i guess we're gonna have to have\nthis con finish this conversation later\nso i'll just leave you with that and i\nthink if you feel fury now we're getting\nsomewhere\nright because that's a feeling that's\nburied beneath all the niceness towards\nthe\nthe bullies that treated you that way\nand like that's it's there bro and like\nyou got to let that that's a raft you've\nbeen carrying around for a long time\nhovered by yeah\nthis is if you want to know the truth\nthe unboxing of how i feel\nput into this like metaphor or analogy\nthis is what it is\nokay who i am is the kid\nbefore the kid that i was before i\npunched that kid in the face\ni am that kid the one before the punch\nright\nthe kid that punched in the face and\nsuddenly\ngot all the credibility is what i see\nso many people in today's world as\nright for some reason they\nthere's something that they have or they\nget that gives them\nall the credibility but they they have\nnone of the actual intention\nor action that like solidifies\nwhat people think they are and no one\ncares\nthat there is no action it's like the\ntalk is enough but then all of their\nphilosophies are\naction is greater than talk but they\ndon't like they don't hold that\naccountable for anyone that they are\nalready like\nhi it's so hard for me to explain this\nlike what i'm trying to do a great job\nwhat i'm trying to say is it seems like\nthe people\nwho are punching in the face the people\nwho are somehow the cool kid\nthey're still winning and in the genuine\ngood that are actually doing good\nthrough\naction they may look ugly they may look\nterrible they may\nlook evil they may say a couple of cuss\nwords and [ __ ] yous and\nsuck my [ __ ] but they're the ones that\nare\nthe heroes are the tr the heroes in\ntoday's world that are brought up\nare the true villains and the villains\nthat are seen\nas villains are the true heroes and it's\nthat mere it's\nit's that that is why our world where is\nwhere it is but no one sees it\ndoes it do does that under do you\nunderstand it's like so\ni'm going to ask you a question and then\nyou tell me whether i understand okay\ni'm not it's going to be hard because i\ni really have to go but\nyeah how does it feel to be to try to be\na good person in the world and to be\nvilified for it\nright it feels\nhonestly this is what it feels like\nevery day\ni continue to do what i do regardless of\nbeing vilified because i'm wired that\nway\nit's just how i am but\nit's\nit's disheartening but\ni i don't know i'm just okay so so this\nis like\nwe'll get there right so this is what\nwe've got to explore\nyeah yeah anyway i don't know yeah i\ngotta run change\nreally i'm sorry i have to cover for\nsomeone else's vacation but okay cool\ni think we're actually at a good\nstopping point i'm sure i think we are\ntoo\nbut yeah we'll come back to this exact\npoint okay\ncan someone check well real quick can\nsomeone in chat clip this\nbest idea if someone clips this last 56\nseconds\nnext show we can we can play it and see\nwhere we left off\nexactly train it so let me yeah okay we\ncan do that but i i think we're going to\nget here\ndon't worry however we get here wherever\nwe start train we're going to come back\nhere okay this is this is who you are\nthis is how you see the world and it's\ngonna\nit's gonna shine through we can talk\nabout whatever you want to and we'll get\nback here\nokay so thanks a lot man absolutely\nloved it i think\nincredibly courageous of you i think um\nyou know to do this i think personally\ni'm going to be a little bit more\ncareful\nabout uh you know taking a jab at you\nand and making fun of you\noh it's all in good fun nah you're good\nbelieve me you're completely good\nyou can do all jabs all everything
