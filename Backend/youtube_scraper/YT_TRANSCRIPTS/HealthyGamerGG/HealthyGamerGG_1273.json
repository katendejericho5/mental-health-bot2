    "transcript": "hey guys before the video starts i just\nwanted to let you all know that our\ncoach program is actually expanding\nthreefold\ncoaches are all personally trained by me\nand are there to help you with problems\nlike procrastination\nmotivation depression anxiety and\nhelping you get unstuck\nso check out the first link in the\ndescription below\nhey guys dr k here today i'd like to\ntalk to you guys about\nunlocking motivation which i think is a\nreally important topic\nso a lot of times we feel like we don't\nhave motivation we feel like we're\nunmotivated and we can't bring ourselves\nto do things but if you really tunnel\ndown and pay attention to your thought\nprocess\nwhat you'll often find is that you\nactually really do want to do something\nand that you actually have a lot of\nmotivation it's not that you\nlack motivation it's that your\nmotivation is actually blocked by\nsomething else\nand this is a really interesting problem\nbecause a lot of times when people think\nthat they lack motivation they do things\nto boost their motivation\nand none of that stuff really tends to\nwork because even if you boost your\nmotivation\nif it's kind of blocked or locked up\nthen motivation boosting strategies\naren't going to work\nso i'd like to explain this kind of\nprinciple which is that if you\nreally really want to do something but\nyou can't seem to bring yourself to do\nit\nwhat could be going on and how to\nactually unlock or unblock that\nmotivation\nso this actually starts way back in\nindia so when i was 21 years old i was\nlucky or desperate enough to go to india\nand i stayed in a monastery for a few\nmonths\nand i had the privilege of working with\na couple of very wise monks\nand one of them explained to me that\neach desire you have each\nintention you have each goal you set for\nyourself\nwhether it be small or big is a little\nbit of a spiritual drain\nthat kind of pulls at you until it's\ncompleted or finished\nyou can kind of think about each desire\nthat you have in your mind\nas a karmic tie and each of those karmic\nties that you create for yourself\nactually\ntie you up and and bind you up until you\nactually let yourself get free of them\nand so we kind of know this because we\nknow that like generally speaking\npeople with who set goals will sort of\nmove towards that goal\nso if we really think about each desire\nor each intention that we kind of set\nsort of pulls us in that direction the\nproblem arises when we get tied up with\ntoo many different intentions and too\nmany different desires\nand so his solution to me was that if i\ngo back and actually\nunburden myself of old karmic ties that\nmy spiritual energy will increase\nand i'll be able to be more successful\nin life and so that may be like a really\ncool\nkind of spiritual perspective but does\nthat\nactually map onto science or does that\nmap onto our\nunderstanding of the mind let's take a\nlook so the first\nexample that i want to come up with is\nthe idea that you know we get paralyzed\nwhen we're overwhelmed by a bunch of\ntasks\nso generally speaking if i have one task\nthat i want to complete\num you know wanting to do something sort\nof drives us to do it\nbut what happens is the number of tasks\ni need to complete increases\nwhat tends to happen is with each task\nthat i add to my plate\ni start to become more and more\nparalyzed and eventually what happens is\npeople can become\nso overwhelmed that they become\ncompletely paralyzed\nand can't complete any of the tasks at\nall for those of you who have fallen\nreally really behind in school or work\nor other things\nsometimes you know if you even if you've\nfallen behind in life\nyou have to do so many things that you\ncan't even get started\nso if we really like stop and and look\nat that what we begin to see is that\nactually maps onto the spiritual\nprinciple of karmic ties pretty well\nthat the more things that you need to\ncomplete the more\nparalyzed you become and the harder it\nis to move forward\neach of those desires you set for\nyourself each of your those goals you\nset for yourself\nis actually kind of a karmic tie that\nkind of binds you up and paralyzes you\nand then you eventually say oh i don't\nhave motivation because you have so much\nstuff to do and you can't bring yourself\nto do it\nif you really tunnel down and you ask\nthat person how important is this\nlet's say it's the most important thing\nin the world i really want to do it i\njust\ncan't so if we really look at that what\nwe see is not that they don't\nhave motivation but that their\nmotivation is blocked let's take another\nexample\nabout how this sort of principle works\nfrom psychology\nand this example is something that's\nreally fascinating because we take it\nfor granted\nevery day and this example is in\nunderstanding\nhow our mind remembers things so i know\nit sounds weird but like let's just\npause for a second\nand realize that our mind remembers\nstuff right\nyour mind reminds you to pick up milk or\nreminds you that you have to work on\nyour resume or reminds you that\noh maybe like you should apologize to\nsomeone for like being late\nor your mind reminds you about all kinds\nof things and so if we look at the\nprocess of remembering how does that\nwork\nso we have a conscious mind and you know\nyou may be going throughout your day and\nyou're like playing games or watching tv\nor whatever\nand then something somewhere in your\nmind\ncatapults a particular thought into your\nconscious mind oh by the way remember we\nhave to dot dot dot remember we have to\ndot dot dot\nand so if we really look at this what\nwhat we must conclude is that\nsome part of our mind is actually\nkeeping track of\nall of our incomplete tasks and the more\nincomplete tasks we have the more your\nsubconscious mind has to keep track of\nand the more it has to remember and the\nmore\nits hands are full with keeping track of\nall of these tasks\nand so what does that mean for people\nwho have blocked motivation so\nlet's take a look at that so we find in\npeople who have kind of blocked\nmotivation\nis that their conscious mind tells them\nto do something\nsomething but the rest of their being\ntheir subconscious mind\ncan't really support them in completing\nthat task right so you tell yourself\nhey i really need to work on my resume\nbut then like the rest of your mind sort\nof\nyou know you're kind of telling yourself\nthat the rest of your mind doesn't kind\nof join you in that task\nand the reason is because it's hands are\nfull right the more that your\nunconscious mind\nhas to keep track of things and remember\nthings it sort of\nserves as kind of like a cognitive load\nor cognitive drain\nand when your unconscious mind is filled\nwith tasks to keep track of\nit can't actually support you in moving\nforward and actually completing tasks\nso each of these incomplete tasks is a\npsychological burden for your\nunconscious\nand as long as your unconscious mind is\nis burdened you're not going to be able\nto\non the motivation that you consciously\nhave and so these two examples\nthe idea that you know motivation is is\nblocked or we become paralyzed with an\noverwhelming number of tasks\nor even that the more stuff that we have\nto remember or hold on to unconsciously\nthe less energy we have that sounds like\na wonderful\ntheoretical psychological explanation so\nthe next question and i think this is\nimportant because\nyou know dr k is an evidence-based\nperson and i really like to look at data\nis there any data to support any of the\nspiritual hokey stuff or\nany of these psychological theories and\nit turns out there's\namazing data for it and that's what i'd\nlike to share with you guys next\nand what we're going to look at is\nactually alcoholics anonymous\nand i love this example because if we\nthink about an alcoholic\nan alcoholic is a person who knows or\nhopefully\nknows that they need to quit drinking\nright they wake up every day and they\ntell themselves i've got to stop\ndrinking i've got to stop drinking i've\ngot to stop drinking\nso if you look at their conscious mind\ntheir conscious mind is\nhighly highly motivated but other parts\nof their being\ntheir body their brain their unconscious\ncall it whatever you want to\nthe addiction is kind of floating around\nthe surface\naround the edges of the the conscious\nmind and takes control of them\nand keeps them actually paralyzes them\nfrom\nfollowing their motivation so i think\nalcoholics are a great example of sort\nof motivation that's\nlocked up or interfered with by other um\nyou know parts of our mind and so the\nquestion is\nwhat what do alcoholics do and does this\nprinciple play it all\ninto becoming sober and the answer is\nabsolutely yes\nso if you look at alcoholics anonymous\nthere it's a 12-step program and one of\nthe steps is what they call making\namends\nand what the making amends step is is\nthat you actually literally go into your\npast\nand you go you think about every person\nthat you've wronged\num usually kind of related around\ndrinking and then you sort of do your\nbest to make amends with them so you\nlike track people down and you apologize\nyou try to basically fix everything that\nyou've done wrong in the past\nand the really interesting thing is that\neven as people do the this step\nsometimes they'll relapse right so\nthey'll relapse and they start drinking\nalcohol and you may think that that's a\nfailure\nbut people in aaa say that you need to\nwork the steps\nso it's not necessarily that you even\nneed to succeed right away it's that you\njust\nkeep working at it so even if you have a\nrelapse you should still go and make\namends if you create a new problem with\nyour drinking you should go and make\namends\nand the more you work at it you work the\nsteps\nthe more amends you make something\nmagical starts to happen\ni've worked with a lot of people with\nalcohol addiction and i think the\nbiggest\nindicator of success in aaa is whether\nthey're actually able to complete this\nstep\nand what i find is almost magical that\nas they start to make amends and as they\nmake more and more amends suddenly like\nthey start to gain power over their\nalcohol and\nwhereas one month ago they wake up and\nthey have to start their morning with a\ndrink\none month later after they've sort of\nlike made all these amends it seems\ncompletely unrelated\nbut they wake up and they suddenly like\ntheir conscious mind\nis more in control and they're able to\nactually attain sobriety which is what\nhappens in alcoholics anonymous\nand so the interesting question is how\ndoes that work and it maps on\nperfectly to the spiritual principle and\nthese two psychological principles\nthat people with alcohol problems tend\nto have a lot of\npent-up stuff floating around in their\nunconscious\nand so their unconscious mind is really\nburdened and even though they\nconsciously want to move forward\ntheir motivation is blocked by sort of\nall of this crap from their past\nand the more that they settle those\nkarmic ties\nthe more they become unbound or untied\nfrom their previous desires\nprevious intentions tedious karma the\nmore they're able to actually align\ntheir motivation and move forward so i\nthink this is a really\nfascinating example because at the end\nof the day\nit's been my personal experience as well\nthat when you\nit's not about finding motivation it's\nabout\nunblocking your motivation and the way\nto unblock your motivation if you really\nreally want to do something and you're\nparalyzed in order to do it\ni want you guys to be really careful\nfrom a diagnostic perspective\nif you really want to do something in\nyour paralyzed you don't actually lack\nmotivation\nyour motivation is restrained and so\nyou've gotta\nunrestrain it you've gotta free it up\nand the way that you do that\nis actually by settling karmic deaths\nfrom the pest\nso if you guys feel stuck in life i know\nit sounds completely counterintuitive\nbut instead of worrying about what you\nneed to do today\ngo and fix things from the past go and\napologize to the people that you need to\ngo and try to right the wrongs from\nyesterday\nand i know it sounds really bizarre but\nlike if you really look at it a lot of\npeople when they need to complete\nsomething and they\nstruggle with motivation they try to\nreally push through that block and they\npush themselves push themselves push\nthemselves\nand it doesn't work and so oddly enough\nthis can really free you\nup a lot and i highly recommend that the\nmore that you settle your past\nthe more that you unburden your\nunconscious mind\nthe freer you're going to feel and then\nsuddenly you're going to wake up one day\nand you're going to\nyour conscious mind is going to tell you\nhey i need to do this thing\nand then something magical is gonna\nhappen you're actually gonna do it\nand it's gonna feel free it's gonna feel\neasy\nit's gonna feel effortless and that's\nwhat i really want you guys to learn\ni want you guys to learn you know not\nhow to work harder but to understand how\ndoes motivation work\nwhat holds us back and as you start to\nunblock it your life is\nabsolutely going to transform so i hope\nthat's really helpful\ni hope you guys give it a shot and i\nwish you all the best\nyou"
