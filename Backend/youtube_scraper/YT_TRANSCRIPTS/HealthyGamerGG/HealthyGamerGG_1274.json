    "transcript": "you don't accept that like all you get\nto control is whether you roll the dice\nwhat you're putting on your shoulders\nis the burden of what the role is\nactually going to be you're saying i\nwant to create this thing\nto take away people's pain and that's\nwhy you work so hard that's awesome\nbut then you beat yourself up if for\nsome reason you feel like it's not\nworking or it's not good enough\nhow's it going man going good man how's\nit going\ngood um so and and what do i call you\nfriend\nwhatever you want arcadium uh arcade\nif you like pronounced arcade but don't\nworry\ni there is there is a 16 long copy pasta\nhow many different ways people have said\nthe name so it's fine so\njeremy or arcadium yeah that's fine cool\nman better\nand and thanks for coming on so much\nthanks for being supportive\nof us and everything um is there\nsomething in particular\nis is it okay if i call you jeremy is\nthat cool yeah that's fine\nokay um so jeremy can you tell me a\nlittle bit about what you want to talk\nabout today if there's anything that we\ncan help you with\nuh well i think the biggest thing um\nis uh kind of like a i guess\ni guess it's a dual like pronged thing\nbecause the first thing is i deal with a\nlot of uh imposter syndrome stuff\nokay and i didn't even know i didn't\neven know what that was called\nuntil then uh and like until like\ni don't know like eight months ago or\nsomething like that i didn't even know\nthat term existed or even\nand uh the other thing was\nhow\ni guess in in addition to that um\nto deal with the the burden of\nresponsibility that has just grown\nlarger and larger what is that\ncan you tell me what what burden you're\ntalking about\nwell specifically um i've always been in\na position of\npseudo leadership because uh dungeon\nmaster is the arbitrator of the game\nand gets everybody together and arranges\neverything\nbut i don't know over the past three\nmonths\nthe uh the weight\nof all the additional stuff on top of\nthat has just been weighing on me a lot\nwell what's can you help us understand\nwhat additional stuff has been weighing\non\nokay i'm gonna try and\nput this in a way that i can explain\nwhat i'm going through\nso essentially\ni judge a master for nine different\ngroups right now\nwow uh i know it's uh roughly about 40\npeople\nif you count the guest stars and then\nthere is\nall the people in my discord which when\ni you know got my channel started\ni wanted to run an mmo like d d sort of\nmud thing in my in my discord like to\nthank the subs and for the stuff that\nsounds\nawesome man that's pretty sick but uh\nthe problem is is that um\ni i am a dungeon master not like a\nadministrator\nand all these other skill sets i don't\nactually have so i had to like learn\nthose on the fly\nand of course i wanted to do it right\nand i wanted to do it well\nso i had to learn a bunch of stuff that\ni wasn't really ready to learn and i\nmade\nyou know mistakes along the way but it\ngot to the point now\nto where it's uh\nnot only has my actual twitch growth\ngotten to this point to where there's a\nlot of people depending on me for their\nentertainment but\nit's it's somehow increased even more\nbecause\nthe players that i have many of them\ndon't stream the games\nthat we play they depend on me for\ntheir own release their own freedom from\nfrom their daily routine you know to\nplay and to\nhave fun but because they get so into it\ntheir communities do too and then they\nfollow them and then\nit's that pressure has just kept\nbuilding and building\nand building on top of it and um\ni'm not afraid of a little hard work the\nmilitary put that in me but\nthe the problem i think is is that i\ndon't know there's just\nthis voice in my head telling me i'm not\ndoing good enough\ni guess how long does that\nyes so beautifully put so first thing i\nwant to say jeremy is it's an\nabsolute pleasure to talk to it dungeon\nmaster\nexplain what their experience is because\neven your storytelling\nyou know your brain is wired to tell a\nbeautiful story\nyeah you take a couple seconds to think\nabout how you're gonna start and how\nyou're gonna finish\num it's unfortunate that the story is\nyou know one of\nof burden and and happiness\ni i guess i i do want to be clear i'm\nnot\nungrateful for anything or or even that\nit's a really a bad\nthing you know i i mean i i don't really\nview it negatively in\nits entirety because it it like you were\nmentioning something earlier uh\non your intro um uh the the\nit was a hinduism term that you said\nyeah uh i\ni know that as ikigai from the japanese\nterm\nwhich is essentially i think similar to\nwhat that means\nwhich is you know what you can get paid\nfor what you're good at\nwhat serves the world and what gives you\ninner peace you find that\nand that's what your purpose in life is\nand i was fortunate enough\nto find that when i was 13 years old\nso i've been doing the i knew exactly\nwhat i wanted to be\nright when that happened can you tell us\nabout that\nyeah sure um so i guess\nthis has a little bit of extra context\nto it um\ni'm not sure how heavy we want to get\nbut suffice to say i grew up\nin the deep south in a uh\nin a place that was not tolerant of\nanything\nit didn't matter what it was it you know\nd and d least of all\nand um i uh\nspecifically at the time i was living in\na literal junkyard\nin a trailer with tainted well water and\nyou know\nin my opinion uh problems that\nany american should be living in with\nour wealth level but that's a whole\nother thing\num but that's what i had to grow up with\nso when i made some friends finally um\ni would go to their house and i would\ntry to go there as much as possible\nbecause\nthere was peace there and uh\nand i never could find it for myself\nwhen i uh you know when i inevitably\nhad to go back to my house\nso while i was there one day we were\nsummer and we're just kind of laying\naround doing nothing\nmy my best friend's dad came in\nsaw us kind of laying around i said all\nright i'm going to teach you guys\nsomething\nand he sat us down and he taught me\nsecond edition d\ni cut my teeth on on a d and d yeah fake\no\nall of it and uh after the first session\ni knew it's exactly what i wanted to do\nwith the rest of my life\ni didn't have a single doubt in my head\nabout it i knew that\nthis is what i want to do what was it\nabout a d and d that\nresonated with you so deeply i was less\nabout what the system did it was\nit was there was this one moment when i\nforgot\nwho i was\nbut then i remembered what i did\nand then it became a part of me and i\ncould\nswitch i could basically i guess dodge\nthe pain that i was feeling but in a way\nthat didn't feel like it was destructive\nso so i guess\ni guess uh i guess it was more like it\nsaved my life because i mean\nit it gave me from that point forward\nthat's all i concentrated on\ni didn't care about anything else it my\nmy my parents would be fighting tooth\nand nail\nin the middle of the kitchen breaking\nstuff my sister would be crying and all\ni could think about was dragons\nit was what i needed and then eventually\nyou know i got through that\ni joined the military i was taught how\nto be a good person\nand then after that i just went full\nfull force into it\nhow did you decide to join the military\ni\nescaped so 80 percent\nescape 20 romanticized uh\nlike viewpoint of what the military is\nwhich is you know everybody is rewarded\nfor their merits everyone acts right\neveryone does the right thing because\nit's the right thing you know\ni of course was taught the truth that\nsince people are involved there will\nalways be all the things that make\npeople you know awful but for the most\npart\nthe military was one of the best\ndecisions i ever made it taught me to be\nan adult\nbecause i certainly didn't learn from my\nparents and more importantly i think\nthan anything else\nit taught me the value of hard work\nbecause until that point\ni was taught um never work hard\nsteal if you can take from others\nbecause they're suckers\nand you can you can trick people\nand uh i was taught how to do it and i\nlearned how to do it because i watched\nwhat my parents would do\nand why i watched what my family would\ndo and the people around me\ni grew up in places where people made\nexcuses\nrather than results you know things like\nthat\nthe military taught me that you can't\nmake an excuse\nwhenever you have a battle brother or\nsister on the line\nyou know and i and i signed up during a\ntime the time of war so\ni had to sit in a room look at a piece\nof paper\nand understand that if i signed it they\ncould imprison me for my incompetence\nand kill me for my cowardice\nand i took that seriously and after my\nservice was done\ni was a i was a better person for it\nwow yeah\nif this is any indication of of your\nstorytelling capabilities you must make\none hell of it dungeon master\nsorry no that's beautiful\nit's quite it's quite the story man it's\nyeah\nyou know i i'd want to call it beautiful\nbut it sounds like it's\nit's got ugly pieces here and there to\nbe sure um\ni i think i think a flaw in something is\nwhat makes it beautiful too\nyou know nothing's perfect do you\nremember\nhow you felt growing up with mom and dad\nfighting\nin one room with your sister crying\ni have a lot of pieces of myself\nthat i've had to fight against i think\nuh\ni think probably the most intense one\nis uh is this rage that started growing\nin me\nbecause like i said i grew up i grew up\naround a lot of prejudice\ni knew what a wizard was before d and d\nif you understand what i mean by that\nand uh\nand i i was taught awful things\nthings that i know now aren't true\nbut i that's that's what like\nit was when it's ingrained into your\nhead when you're a child\nand you ex of course your elders and the\npeople\nthat love you you're you're you what\nelse do you have to go off of\nyou know you get taught those things and\nthen they become reality and it gets\nreally hard to change that and\ni i think the reason that i chan i turn\nthat corner\nyou know at least racism-wise was the\nfirst\nactual person who didn't look like me\nthat i met\nwas nothing like i was told he was a\npunk skater\nhe wore like uh punk music t-shirts\nhis name was tj and he did sweet kick\nflips\nthat's it he's completely different he\nwas so cool man\ni want to do kick flips so i changed\neverything\nso that's one of those what is the rage\ntell me i don't see racism\nsorry sorry sorry sorry that that was an\nexample of\nbecause when i found out that i had been\nlied to\nthat's when it started from that lie\nbecause i uh\ni didn't really have a childhood i grew\nup really fast um\ni know i wasn't really able to be naive\ni think\nuh it started with that that i knew that\npeople were lying to me and trying to\nfigure out who was lying to me made me\nsuspicious i think\nand then when i actually started and\nbecause i had that suspicion\nyou know my mother and father were no\nlonger\nthe um the bearers of truth and my\nextended family\nyou know pillars of wisdom they were all\njust\nliars and cowards and i started seeing\nit for what it was\ni would see how my father in one hand\nwould tell me\nuh you're doing a great job but then\nwould have such little faith\nthat i was going to perform the simplest\nof tasks right that he would send my\nlittle sister in to make sure i was\ndoing it right\nhe just destroyed my confidence\nconstantly\nyou know just one thing there that's\njust an example and\nall those little things kept piling up\nand then the big things or my my\nparents kept splitting up and um and i\nwas\nforced to see violence i've had\neverything happen to me\nthat most people have had happen to them\nin some way all forms of\nabuse all of them so\nand i guess when i finally found\nuh d and d i found that there is a place\nwhere i can make things\nthe way i wanted them to be and that i\ncould bring joy to people through it\nand it gave me a weapon a weapon i could\nuse against\nthe darkness so to speak and that's uh\nthat's what it did and now we get to the\nburden of responsibility\nyeah so what's the responsibility you\nbear\njeremy\nthrough the course of my career people\ncome to me\nbecause they seek sanctuary like i did\nall those years ago\nwhether it be uh\nwhether it just be to have some fun to\nblow off some steam from work\nor because they're trans and they want\nto be the gender they want to be\nand for a couple hours i can make it\ntrue\nor they can be strong and fast\nsmart and wise charismatic\npretty doesn't matter\ni can make it true for a couple hours\nand i take it seriously\neven though in the end it's just a game\nuh to me it's it's more than that it's a\nit's a weapon against despair\nwhich is why i have which is why i have\nthat dichotomy in my storytelling i\nthink\nwhich dichotomy hope and despair\nyou said that you learned about this\nterm imposter syndrome recently\nyeah uh specifically like uh i wanted i\nthink it was eight months ago\num but it was devin nash talked about it\nand i was wondering what does that mean\nand then i looked at i was like yeah\nokay\nand so that's me what features of\nimposter syndrome\ndo you think apply to you or do you do\nyou identify with\nwell i don't even know if i have it but\nthis is this is what happens\nto me is that i'll do something good and\nthen i cannot see\nthe success that i have even now like\nthe the level that i'm at right now i\ndon't even see it\nbecause all i all i all i hear is that\nwhisper in the back of my head that it's\nuh\nnot good enough and when i was in the\nmilitary i\ni tried to cut out guilt completely out\nof me\nto combat it combat that voice but i\nwent too far in the other direction i\nbecame a terrible person for it\ni didn't care about anybody i just did\nhorrible things and i didn't feel any\nguilt at all\nand because i like forced it out of my\nout of myself because i just didn't want\nto feel guilty for doing the right thing\nbecause i didn't do enough but that was\ntoo far and\nthen i pulled back on and then i found a\ndecent balance\ni think but now i think that that\nthe force multiplier of the size\nof the weight is just\nyeah makes the void like if the voice is\na percentage\nof who i am because of the burden's\nweight\nthe voice is louder now because it's\nbigger i suppose can i think for a\nsecond\nyeah go ahead buddy\nso jeremy we've got a fork in the road\nyeah okay\nand so you get to pick so one is i can\nexplain\nthe stats of the imposter syndrome\nclass and how does imposter syndrome\nwork how can we understand the mechanics\nof it\nit's going to be not an individual\ncharacter it's going to be a set of\nrules in a rule book it's not\nit may apply to you it may not it's just\nthe the diagram\nof what imposter syndrome is and how it\nfeels and where it comes from\nokay the other fork in the road is to\nactually build a character which is you\nright is to take this principle and we\ndon't have to do\nbut we don't have to do one or the other\nit can be both i guess it's an\nissue of sequence potentially but we can\nask you\nmore questions about you know the way\nthat you've managed guilt the way you've\ndealt with your feelings\nthis sort of sense of burden of\nresponsibility we can we can talk about\nyou in a more specific sense\nand in short i you know i think i i\nalready have a a decent hypothesis about\nyou know where a lot of your struggles\ncome from um\nand we can kind of go more specifically\nabout you so do we want to explore the\ncharacter that is\njeremy or do we want to talk about the\nclass\nimposter syndrome i mean you're the\nyou're the boss here which do you think\nis better i'm the dm\nbut you're the pc so you get to choose\nokay\nuh finally get to play yes\num i guess\nthe second one okay so tell me\num tell me what uh\nlet me just try to find my question\nbecause you gotta know the character\nbefore you choose the class yeah\nso you said that you tried to\ncut guilt out yeah\nright and and now what is it\nyou feel guilty or that you're not\ngood enough or you're gonna let people\ndown or what\nwell i suppose now because i because\ncutting it out\ncompletely wasn't the right call at all\nnow it's um\nsince the stakes are so high and since\ni've\npulled off things that a lot of people\ncan't even believe\nthat someone can do there's now this uh\nthis\nthis rising bar of expectation\nwhere i can't falter at all i can't make\nmistakes\nbecause if i do then\nfaith turns on its heel and\nfrom my experience early in my career i\ncan see how quickly that\nthat faith can turn to just\ndistrust and just some awful stuff so\nwhat do you mean by that\nwell like uh\ni have an example here so uh in the\nearly days\nof my career before i went professional\nlike i started charging\ni did a couple of side campaigns and one\nof the side campaigns i\nuh told people that i would try to\nprepare everything for them and so\nbecause i told them that hey don't worry\nabout it i'll do this\nthey just tried to challenge me because\nthey just started doing random stuff\nand then it got to the point to where i\njust\ni just couldn't keep up because they\nwould literally try to make me wrong\nand so whenever the time came that one\nof them did something\nand i didn't have it ready for them they\nsaid i knew you couldn't do it\nand then i felt like i failed them even\nthough now i know that that person's\nthat person's just an [ __ ] but now i\nknow that it's\nyeah i only know that now then i felt\nlike i let him down\nokay completely so i understand we just\ngot a rate from\nanita so um\ni'm just gonna include people in so you\nwant to introduce yourself jeremy to\nthe yeah sure sure hello i am arcadium i\nam a\nprofessional dungeon master on twitch.tv\nuh\ni like you wow\nyeah that's all so uh well welcome guys\num so we're big fans of anita\nhere at healthy gamer i'm dr k so we're\ntalking to arcadium today about\num sort of hi so as he's grown more\nsuccessful he feels some\nsense of like imposter syndrome which is\nthat despite\nthe world telling him that he's doing a\ngood job\nthe more the world tells him that he's\ndoing a good job\nthe stronger the voice in his head\nbecomes\nthat it's all going to come crashing\ndown or that there's something that\npeople don't understand or things like\nthat\num i mean i know you haven't sort of\nsaid that explicitly but that's\ni'm basing that pretty much it i'm\nbasing that on the the class description\nyeah yeah um so i want to just highlight\nwhat you just said\njeremy because you kind of said that you\nknow you told people hey i'm going to\ntake care of everything and then they\nset on a quest to prove you wrong\nand they're going to do that right yeah\nyeah and then\nthere's the statement that they said i\nknow you couldn't\ndo it yeah\nhow does that statement relate to the\nvoice in your head that you would\ndescribe as imposter syndrome\nwell\ni suppose what i what i what i would\nequate to that is um\nthey said they knew that they couldn't\ndo it now i know why that person said\nthat now\nand yeah more often because you know all\nthat but i guess at the in that moment\ni just heard my dad i think more than\nanything else\nbecause you know he would tell me i\ncould do anything\nand then not have any faith in me at all\nthat i would\nuh in the same breath so i'm glad you\nmade that connection\nbecause beautiful um right because i i'm\ni'm envisioning that story where\nyou know your dad would tell you to do\nsomething and he would send your sister\nwith you because\nhe sort of yeah and and so\nwhen we think about you know and now if\nwe sort of start to connect the dots and\nwe think a little bit\nabout imposter syndrome like\nwhat you know you so despite your\nsuccess and despite\nyou you being aware that you can do it\nthere lives within you a voice that\ntells you\nthat you can't so then the question\nbecomes if we want to understand the\nvoices inside us right because like this\nis the thing is that\nwe live our lives and we're like\nhopefully functioning adults or even if\nwe're not really functioning adults\nit doesn't really matter we know we're\ncapable of some things we have evidence\nthat we're capable of some things\nand there are voices that we carry with\nus\nand so if you want to overcome that\nvoice that you carry with you\ni think the biggest thing to understand\nis to understand like we know where did\nyou learn that\nand to understand it it's interesting\njeremy because you say that\nnow looking back on it you can\nunderstand even though\nyou know you felt bad in that moment you\nrecognize that that was his problem\nthat's not yours\nif he sets out to you know screw you\nover when you're\ndming a campaign like he'll he'll make\npeople not have fun\nright like pcs can do that no matter how\nstrong you are as a dungeon master\nan [ __ ] pc can ruin a game for you if\nthey really want to\nyeah um and and so i think\nyou know it's interesting because you\nsay that you tried to cut out guilt and\ni think that\nyou sort of formed a very strong version\nof yourself\nthrough the military you learned a lot\nabout yourself you learned a lot about\nhow to be a good person but you know\ndespite\nall of that growth like wounds still\nneed to be healed\nyou know if if i'm sitting at half\nhealth and i level up and i\ngain eight hit points and then i level\nup again and i gain eight hit points\nit doesn't matter like that damage is\nstill there and the damage has to be\nhealed\nand what i hear is a guy who was running\naround at half health who's been\nleveling up a lot\nbut at the end of the day never healed\nthat\ninitial wound yeah\nand so i think the the issue is going to\nbe like\nyou know when you feel like you can't do\nit\nis that your dad's voice\nis it yours\ni suppose i uh my father's a part of me\nwhether i want it or not so it's\nprobably mine\nand so what do you tell yourself\nwell what i've been doing lately to deal\nwith it\nand it's probably not healthy but it's\nthe only thing that\nthat uh seems to quiet it\nis that uh each time\ni hit a point it'll say you can't do\nbetter i'll do better\nand then it's quiet for a while and then\nit comes back and it's quiet for a while\njust keep\nhitting it down now i guess it helps\nbecause i keep\ndoing better i don't know it's it's\nreally it's really strange to put it\ninto words\num it's almost like uh\ni've got like a shadow in my mind a\ndemon if you will\nand i live a good life out of spite of\nit\njust despite it yep you know so it's\ni don't know it doesn't really come from\ni guess in that particular instance it\ndoesn't come from like a place of\nlove and understanding and compassion as\ni would like it to be it's just\nfrom spite competitiveness i guess\nyeah so now we come to another feature\nof the character class of imposter\nsyndrome\nwhich is that it's actually adaptive\ntowards success\nso it actually even though it tortures\nus\nfrom an objective level it actually\nhelps us succeed\nso i see imposter syndrome a lot like a\ngood example is in the investment\nbanking field\nyou get you know 22 year olds who end up\nat goldman sachs they move to new york\nand they live the life of a banker\nand you know at the age of 22 they're\nmaking 250k\nand then suddenly it's like from\nno money to 250k a year can feel like\nand then the imposter syndrome hits and\nit tells them\nyou can't do better look at this other\nperson he's doing better than you\nyou're fake you know people haven't\nrealized\nand then they they do exactly what you\ndid which is they fight the voice and\nthey try to overcome it\nand it does quiet it for a while and it\ncertainly improves you\nright like like you you grow in\nobjective success\nbut then the voice comes back so here's\nthe question when when the voice says\nyou can't do better why do you have to\nprove it wrong\ni suppose um\nthe reason that i i do that specifically\nthe reason that i have to prove it wrong\nis because\ni'll start to believe it\nbecause then it says other things like\nlike uh you don't deserve what you have\nand that you lied to get there and that\nyou did this and that\nbecause um that's something else that my\ndad did\nis that anytime he would get into an\nargument\nhe he was not satisfied\nwith understanding or even victory he\nwould only accept\nabsolute victory and even then\nhe would not be satisfied like he would\nwin an argument with my mother and then\njust\ndrill her into the ground afterwards\nbecause he won he was right it was\nit was awful and for the longest time\nyou know i i would uh\nequate that like especially growing up i\ni would equate that that is the only way\nthat\na winner is decided is if absolute\ndefeat\nvictory and it wasn't until you know i\ngot old enough\nto realize that that was just the lie\nthat that wasn't true\nbut you know at that point it was taught\ninto my like core functions\nso it's really hard to resist it\nyou know so jeremy let me ask you\nsomething when you\nhave the voice that tells you that you\ncan't do it\nand you overcome that voice\nand you succeed and you do better\nwhich part of you is your dad\nthe voice or your response to the voice\nprobably the voice the crazy thing is i\nthink it's both\nyeah right because what what do you do\nwith that voice\nyou try to crush it you try to prove it\nwrong\nyou try to drive it into the ground to\nprove to it\nthat that voice is wrong yeah\nand so what you're doing is you're\ncutting out a part of yourself there too\nso here's the crazy thing like there's\nthere's a different perspective\nand i think it's gonna be hard but like\njust hear me out for a second\nwhich is that you can't do it\nor that you may not be able to do it it\nlike the whole problem here jeremy is\nthat it's like it's a battle where\nabsolute victory\nis on either side and an absolute\nvictory against yourself is still a loss\nfor you\nand like what you need to do is learn\nhow to be in the middle\nto recognize for example that you may\nnot be able to do it\nand that's okay because the thing that\ni'm hearing that is completely foreign\nto you\nyou understand victory and defeat you\nunderstand triumph and lost\nyou don't understand forgiveness\nfor not running yeah\ni suppose right it's weird so i mean\ni suppose i suppose now you said that i\nsuppose there's a part of me that\nbelieves that it doesn't exist\nof course because you don't no one\ntaught you right so the military is\ngonna teach you a lot of things\nit's gonna teach you you know like\nhow to potentially like be disciplined\nand and work hard and stuff like that\nit's not gonna uh very few people i've\ntalked to in the military have learned\nforgiveness from the military\nand what i'm still hearing is a war\nagainst yourself like the wars we fight\nagainst themselves\nourselves are the ones that even if we\nlive we win we lose\nand what i'm what i'm hearing is you\nknow you kind of say oh my god i'm\nresponsible for creating an escape for\nso many people because\nthis was an escape for me and that's\nwhere i'd say like i\ni don't think i don't think you're i\nmean i'm sure you understand this but\nlike\ni i really encourage you to think about\nit is that you can't create an escape\nfor someone else\nright the whole point of d d is like you\nguys have to create it together\nand it's not you can't guarantee you\ncan't all the pain\nthat you experience growing up that dnd\nhelped you escape from\nyou want to give that opportunity to\nother people awesome\nbut it is not as a human being you are\nentitled to your actions but not the\nfruits of your actions right\nit's my choice whether i choose to swing\nmy sword\nit's not my choice whether i critical\nhit critical fail or hit\nthat's determined by the dice and the\nproblem here\nis that the burden of responsibility\nthat you bear\nyou don't accept that like all you get\nto control is whether you roll the dice\nwhat you're putting on your shoulders\nis the burden of what the role is\nactually going to be\nyou're saying i want to create this\nthing to take away people's pain and\nthat's why you work so hard\nthat's awesome but then you beat\nyourself up if\nfor some reason you feel like it's not\nworking or it's not good enough\nlike your job as a dungeon master is to\ncreate an opportunity for other people\nto come and escape if they want to\nbut you don't get to actually control\nlike whether that escape happens or not\nbut you accept that for yourself you\ntake that responsibility so oddly enough\ni think i think you the burden of\nresponsibility that you take\nis not actually yours to bear\ni could see that\ni just it's a harder thing for me to\naccept i suppose because\nas i've gotten better at it\ni have been able to do it\nand if you can help somebody\nthen you should sure at least i i feel\nat least so yeah so so jeremy i\ni can see that you're not quite buying\nwhat i'm selling so that's\nso let me explain it in a slightly\ndifferent way and then i think we have\nto get to the\nemotional underpinnings so you're saying\nthat but i have been able to do it\nyou're damn right so as you level up\nright your thakko gets better\nand like the more you level up the more\nfact your thakko gets better and the\nbetter your thakko gets the more hits\nyou see\nand yet at the same time even if you're\na level 20 fighter with a thaco of one\nit doesn't mean that you're gonna hit\nyou still do not control\nthe dice no matter how hard how good you\nget\nyeah right so i but i think that that\nsomewhere along the way\nyou transitioned in your mind and i'd\nencourage you to really pay attention to\nit when did you start accepting\nresponsibility for how the dice was\nactually going to roll\nwhen did you cross the line between it's\nmy choice\nwhether i roll a dice to i have to hit\nand i see this in medicine too because\nthe better doctors become\nthe more that they start to think that\nlike the more competent of a doctor\ni become the more that i think that i\ncan hold death at bay\nthe more people that i save the more i\nstart to think like i can do this and\ni'm i i'm stronger than that\nbecause see how many times i've eaten it\nand yet the more victories you have\nand the more skillful you become the\nmore you level up you can't conquer that\nyou can create a place where people can\ncome to escape\nbut you can't give them escape\nyeah i suppose and i mean and i know in\nmy\ni guess my heart that that's true so i'm\nnot i don't disagree with it at all\ni just i guess i lament that uh\nthat i can't do that good in its\nentirety\nyes and now we're getting someone so\nwhy do you lament that jeremy\nwell\nlife is unfair and suffering and we're\ngiven the strength to make it through\nthat\nbut others aren't as strong as me so i\ncan lend them some of mine\nand i just do it through d and\ni guess i see that if i get strong\nenough then i can\nremove more suffering\nthat way and that because i can do it i\nshould\nand then if i can keep doing it then i\nshould\nand i lament that i know that i am\ndoomed to fail\nan absolute victory and i know that\nyeah so can i tell you a story\nyeah if you've studied eco guy you may\nhave heard this one before\nso there's a monk that's um\nsitting on the banks of a river and he\nsees a scorpion\ncrawling around on the banks of the\nriver and the scorpion\nfalls into the river and starts to drown\nand the monk\nreaches over and he plucks the scorpion\nout of the water and the scorpion stings\nhim he's like\nand then he sets it you know on the bank\nof the river\nand then his disciples are kind of\nwatching nearby and then\nafter a little while scorpion wanders\nback down to the river\nand falls into the river again and the\nscorpion picks it up and it stings him\nhe goes out\nand he like puts it safely back and the\nthird time scorpion goes into the river\nthird time he plucks it out and a third\ntime he gets stung\nand then one of his disciples is like\nmaster\nwhy do you keep on saving the scorpion\nif it keeps on stinging you\nand you know what the master says have\nyou heard this one before\ni guess not i said all right i've i i've\ngo ahead it's so evident version of it\nyeah so so the master says well\nyou know i keep doing it because it's in\nmy nature to save drowning animals it's\nin the scorpions in nature to bite\nto sting things that pick it up\nand so i i think this is the kind of\nthing where like you know i think your\nproblem jeremy is that you seek absolute\nvictory\nright your problem is that you've shed a\nlot of what you grew up with\nbut the need for absolute crushing\nvictory so that you never have to deal\nwith it again\nis i mean this is just the nature of\nthings\nyou can give people a place to escape\nand they're going to come\nin and they're going to follow their\nnature and you keep doing you\nright it's not like i encourage you to\nbe like the monk and like\ndo what is your role to do do what is\nyour ika guy or your dharma\nyeah and understand that\nif you were expecting and like i think\nwhat you need to learn is like\nthe satisfaction of or contentment of\nrolling the dice\nthe satisfaction or contentment of\nabsolutely by all means\noffer what you can to help other people\nand give the most that you can\nto improve other people's lives and if\nyou can do it should you do it\nhell yeah buddy go for it\nbut don't for a second think that\nbecause you try\nyou're going to succeed don't for a\nsecond think that your success\nis actually in your hands because it\nisn't\nyour effort is in your hands\n[Music]\ndo you bear a burden or do you bear a\nburden absolutely but the burden that\nyou bear is not one of improving their\nlives\nit's one of creating a space where they\ncan where they can come to\nbecause let me ask you this like who\nbore the burden of responsibility for\nyour escape\nwhen you were thirteen\nmy son said bob smith\nyeah he taught me dnd\nand he was hammered the whole time but i\ngotta tell you it was\nis the most honest like\nhe's just a good dad to his son and to\nme\nso that's probably has something to do\nwith it too\ni think so connect those dots for us\nwhat do you think it has to do with it\njeremy\ni guess because whenever uh whenever\nandy won with my\nfriend who's his son whenever he'd do\nwell\nhe'd pat his son on the back\nand that would be it there'd be no uh\nbackhand so to speak and what happened\nwith you jeremy\ni won and i didn't need anything else\ni didn't even win i guess uh\ni guess for once i i just i existed in\na state where it wasn't all extreme\nand it wasn't all how am i gonna put it\num\ni could speak instead of scream it's the\nbest way i can really put it\nwell set yeah\nit's just fun man that too it was just\nfun too\nthe most fun i'd ever have up to that\npoint\noh maybe it's just the right combination\nyou know\na good role model that didn't knock me\ndown when i\ngot stood up peaceful place\nquieter nobody was angry\nand i was around friends i guess\ni thought about that a lot like like\nwhat combination happened\ni don't i don't know the answer to that\nbut\ni'm thankful every day that it happened\nand\nso help me understand when you feel like\nyou're an imposter what kind of thoughts\ngo\nthrough your head\nvisions of myself\neither failing or misusing\nthe position that i have the power that\ni have\ni suppose or or or the responsibility or\nor or\nneglect just lots of those things\nwhy do you fear that those things will\ncome to pass\ni don't know uh\nbecause i'm always i guess i'm always\nthinking about it\nlike in the back of my head especially\nwhen i go to sleep\nthat's i think that's where the\nnightmares come from but\nwhat do you mean nightmares oh i\nnearly every night i just have\nawful nightmares so i don't get a lot of\nsleep\ngranted that's also been helpful because\nsome of my best monsters\ni've made for dnd have come from that\nbut\ncan you share something with us\ncan you share something what have you\nmade from\nliterally the stuff of nightmares all\nright here we go let me tell you\nsomething\nso one time uh i was i was i was\ndreaming\nthat i was like in this warehouse and\nlike\nfaces were being like stitched onto my\narms and it was crazy\nand it was so vivid and real and they\nwere like the faces of people that i\nknew growing up\nand then after that i woke up i\nimmediately started making the creature\nand that's where i made\nuh my first like uh like like\nface stealing creature which i kind of\nbased on i looked up mythology of and it\nexists in other places\nand i really got together and started\ntinkering with it a little bit\nand then i unveiled it a year later\nagainst the party and it was like one of\nthe coolest fights they ever had\nbecause it had stance changes and it\nwould steal like their personality\nsubtypes and they'd have to fight\nagainst themselves it was awesome\npretty sick sounds pretty awesome man\nman it was awesome\nbut yeah that's that's where most of\nthem come from\nhow are you feeling about this\nconversation jeremy\nuh i don't really talk to anybody\nlike this about this kind of stuff so\ni guess a little anxious um\nso when i look at your face i don't see\na whole lot of emotion\nlike i'm having trouble figuring out\nactually the impression that i'm getting\nis that you're able to understand with\nthings intellectually but that you're a\nlittle bit disconnected from\nyourself well\ni think\nmaybe the the thing with that is um\nmy family isn't intellectual\nthey're very emotional\nand while i know that there's a lot of\ngood that can be done\nthrough that method you know i can\nfeel for a lot of different people and\nstuff like that but\nthere's just a lot of a lot of\nbad things that can come from it as well\num\nyou know anger being the one i'm most\nafraid of\num and sometimes my passion for the\nthings i talk about kind of eek out and\nthen i'll get a little emotional that\nway\nbut i don't know too many too many times\nwhen i've allowed myself i guess that\nvulnerability it uh\nit's just caused something worse to\nhappen and there's very few people i can\nreally\nmean vulnerability well\npart of my job is to remain\nneutral and unbiased which means i have\nto\nto some degree detach myself emotionally\nfrom the situation because while the\ndice do\ndecide many things i decide the\nparameters and which the dice are rolled\nagainst and i have to calculate\nlet varying levels of fairness and if i\nwhile i can't control exactly what the\ndice do i can augment them greatly\nby the challenges that that person has\nto face\nso if i'm emotionally attached to\nsomebody and i don't want to make them\nfeel bad\nthen i won't challenge them properly and\nthen\ni make all of their successes and their\nfailures meaningless\nbecause i don't give them an honest\nchallenge\nit's one of the reasons i don't fudge\ndice rolls and some dm's do\ni don't do that because the only way\nthat someone can\nknow success as if failure is real\nat least in d and d um i don't know if\nthat applies across the board but i know\nit applies in d d\nand i've got the\nplenty of evidence to support that\nbecause that's why my career happened\num so\nin that regard i think that's why i uh\nwhen i talk about things like that i\ndetach myself\nemotionally especially also on you know\non stream and stuff because\ni you know i know that i'm more of a\npublic facing\nfigure now and i feel like i should be\ncareful with what i say and\nemotions make you less careful they make\nyou more honest i think but also less\ncareful and\nand i suppose also when all things are\nconsidered\ni\nthey're really\nstrong and i can't\ncontrol them if i let them out too much\ni think i i hope that\nsuffices i don't i don't know yeah so\nthat i'm i'm getting that\nfrom you yeah and i think that's a real\nchallenge because i i think what you've\ngot to do jeremy is\nnot controlled\nyeah right so you you've tried to cut\nguilt entirely out of your life\nthat didn't work so well and it sounds\nlike you have difficulty controlling\nthem\nbut what i'm what i'm getting from you\nis that like sure i can explain\nsort of logic and we can talk about that\ngo and all that good stuff\nbut at the end of the day i get the\nsense that\nthere's a certain amount of teflon\ncoating that you've got\nand so we keep slipping off of it\nit's slick and and i think if you really\nwant to get to the root of this imposter\nsyndrome i mean we can talk about\nfeatures of the class and whatnot but\ni think at the end of the day like what\ni want you to understand is that that\nvoice is not coming from a rational\nplace it's coming from an emotion\nit's coming from conditioning and if you\nwant to undo\nso like i want you to really think about\nthis like so the thoughts that\nenter our head come from somewhere\nit's crazy like the simplest thing is\nthat you know so you\npopped open what looked like some kind\nof dr pepper beverage and\nand as i saw that my indriyas or my\nsense organs\ndetected something and then generated a\nthought\nin my brain so sometimes one of the\nsources of thoughts is our indriyas or\nour sense\norgans but thoughts come from more\nplaces than our sense organs they come\nfrom more places than the outside world\nsometimes they come from us\nand if you think about you know i want\nyou to think about like a portal\ninto some you know\nlower plane that's spawning denizens and\nwhat happens is you're there and like it\nspawns a denizen which is the thought in\nyour head and it says\ni can't do well you're you're gonna fail\nand then you smack that denizen down\nyou beat the crap out of it and then\nyou're like yeah i won\nand then a day later a week later oh\nthere's the thought again\nand you smack that one down too and\nthere's the thought again\nyou smack that one down too and like we\nsaid imposter syndrome\nis adaptive because if we think about it\nwe're farming xp right\nwe're just farming these denizens for xp\nit's great we're leveling up\nbut it sucks because you're kind of\nfighting these denizens from the lower\nplains all the time if you want to get\nto the portal that portal is emotional\nif you want to close that portal like\nyou got to go\nyou can't keep on fighting these\ncognitive wars against yourself\nand buying yourself until tomorrow\nyou've got to go to like where this like\nyou know where this feeling comes from\nthe idea that like\nyou have within you a belief and\nnow i'm going out on a limb so we can\ntalk about it could be right could be\nwrong\nso i and i've seen this with people\nfrankly from\ndeep south so i grew up when you say\ndeep south what state are you talking\nwell arkansas okay so like i grew up in\neast texas\nand so pretty similar i mean\nmaybe not quite as deep i mean if well i\ngrew up in a city that had a population\nof 100 000 people but\nyou know there were there were wizards\nand dragons of a different kind down\nthere too\nyeah and um\ni think at the end of the day\nyou know there there's a part of you\nthat not to be in delicate and i'm going\nto use an\ninflammatory phrase to see if we get\nsome traction\nthere's a part of you that's a\nsuccessful twitch streamer and dungeon\nmaster and living the life of your\ndreams and you carry with you\na white trailer park trash kind of kid\naround\nyeah right and and those\nthoughts don't come from arcadium\nthey come from jeremy\nand like if you really want those\nthoughts like that insecurity about what\nyou're capable of and the idea that\neven if you do well it's going to come\ncrumbling down around you like that\nfundamental\nlack of faith is not arcade\nbecause arcade is [ __ ] amazing\neveryone knows that\narcadium is the the person that\nliterally takes\nthe stuff of nightmares and turns it\ninto an escape\nfor people who are suffering in the rest\nof their life like how cool is that\ni don't know how much more fallen hero\nanti-paladin you can get\ni i know i don't feel that way but\ni i i unders i understand what you mean\nyeah and i know that you don't feel that\nway so what way do you feel jeremy\ni feel uh i feel that you're right about\nsomething that i didn't really think\nabout\nthat the persona that i created for\nmyself\nisn't really me\nnot really i mean it's a part of me sure\nbut it's not me me\nyou know not as maybe that's the wrong\nway to look at it but\ni try to i think i think you know i i\nignore\njeremy and i try to become the person i\nmade for myself\nbecause that's what i want to be but i\ncan't just not be\nthe other part of me and i gotta find a\nway to put them together again yep\nso now we come to a weird thing that i'm\ngonna say\nthe reason you feel like an imposter\njeremy is because\nyou are one\nright because you're and i know what you\nmean by that yeah yeah yeah\nyeah right so the reason that like\nlike there there is a part of you that\ncould fail\nand i think that actually you're gonna\nreach just like you said\nit's it's the failures that make the\nsuccesses worthwhile and it's while you\nwhy you don't fudge roles and in your\nown life\nyou're trying to live a life of pure\nsuccess\nwithout carrying that that failure with\nyou\nand you're more than arcadium and thank\ngod for that you're jeremy too and it's\nbecause like\njeremy is the fuel for arcade\nall of your compassion all of your like\nintrinsic understanding of your despair\nand if you go find a therapist i'm sure\nthey'll have a field day with your\nnightmares\nand the you know psychological symbolism\nthere\nyeah and so uh jeremy i think what what\nyou've got to do is\nunderstand that yeah maybe you will fail\nmaybe you will people let\nmaybe you will let people down maybe you\nwon't win 100\nand that's okay that when someone\nconcedes an argument you don't have to\ndrive them into the ground\nthat you don't have to be perfect all\nthe time if you're running nine\ncampaigns and you [ __ ] up one day like\nthat's no big deal you're allowed to\nmake mistakes\nyeah you should have the biggest problem\nis that you don't have any mercy for\nyourself\nthere's a relentless you know like\nyou're trying so hard to prove to\nyourself that you're\nlike it's weird like you have this war\nwhere like you can't tolerate the idea\nthat you're not\narchaedum and that jeremy may be alive\ninside you and like that's not a battle\nyou're ever gonna win because jeremy is\nalive and inside you\nyeah the crazy thing is that the\nconclusion that you draw from that is\nthat like that's a bad thing i think\nit's a good thing i think it's who you\nare man\nyou're not straight 18s bro\nyou've got a dump stat or two here or\nthere\nshould have rolled my stats no it's\nnever gonna\nno i get i get what you mean though yeah\ni'm sorry if i seemed resistant to the\nthings you were saying i didn't mean it\nthat way or\nanything no i it's not something you\nhave to apologize for it's an\nobservation\nno right i think it's it's it's not i\ndidn't interpret it as a resistance i\nthink it's protection\nthis is like one of those campaigns\nwhere like there's some you know cave\nthat's sealed off by a bunch of wards\nyeah and like eventually you got to take\nthe wards down and go in\nthe words are there for a reason they're\nkeeping the anger at bay\nand i think a good place for you to\nstart is not so much about guilt it's\nas you said rage like what are you angry\nat man\ndo you let yourself be angry\ni try very hard not to let myself be\nangry\nthere is a portal deep inside a cave\nthat's warded off\nand every week it spawns something and\nall that [ __ ] is trapped in there\nso i can understand that you're afraid\nso i think this is going to be like a\njourney\nyeah you know where you learn to like\nunderstand your anger and become more\nfamiliar with it\nit's your choice whether you want to try\nto go there today or not i don't\nnecessarily think we need to open that\ncan of worms but if you want to we can\ntry to explore it\nso now we come to another fork in the\nroad which is mechanics of imposter\nsyndrome we're exploring your anger\nlet's do anger because that's the thing\ni'm most afraid of\nwhy are you afraid of your anger\ni promised myself before i came on here\nthat i'd be honest completely\nand i'd listen to what you say but there\nit is again\nwhat are you doing to yourself\ni don't know so so so i i okay go ahead\nand finish your thought\ni was just i was just gonna say that\nit's i\ni don't know what the rules are and what\ncan be talked about or anything because\ni don't know how it all happens i just\ni knew that before i came in here that i\nwanted i wanted what help you had to\noffer\nokay and uh\ni'm about to say i haven't really said\non stream before\ni wouldn't say anything against tos or\nanything that's illegal no no no no no\nno no no i'm not going to say that no\nit's it's just um\ni don't it's something i did that was\nreally bad and i don't want people to\nthink\ndifferently of me because of it but\nif we're gonna explore the anger then we\nhave to go to probably the\nthe moment i became afraid of it\nit was when i was 16 years old and um\nmy mom had just come home from another\ndrunken binge uh and this was two weeks\nafter\nshe had almost uh killed\nme my sister and all my friends in a car\naccident\num and all the\nall the you know the back of my head\ngot to the point where i couldn't hold\nit back anymore\nand i uh\ngod i realized how strong i was then\ni uh\ni got very angry and it was over\nsomething so\nsmall and petty like it was\nit was uh my mom\nwouldn't let me go to my friend's house\nshe wouldn't give me a ride because she\nhad a headache\nand i knew she had a headache because\nshe had been out drinking\nsuch a petty thing to get this mad over\nbut\nit was just the straw that broke the\ncamel's back\nand it was uh\ni i broke things\nsmashed the car uh\nbroke windows shattered the door\nah the neighbor that was our landlord\ntried to stop me\ni meant 10 years at 20 years my senior\nuh and i heard him pretty bad\num\nwe had two friends of the family\nthat were there these two these two boys\none of them was two years\nmy junior i hurt him pretty bad\nhis little brother was faster than me\nthough i couldn't catch him\nand what i remember standing out on the\nroad\nright in front of where we where we were\nliving\nall i could remember was how good i felt\nand that terrified me afterwards\nbecause you know i thought\nthat what i was doing was wrong\nbut every single part of myself\ntold me it wasn't\nand uh\nyou know i was 16 young and nobody\ntaught me anything\nand i know now it's you know there are\nhealthy ways to let out anger and\ncatharsis and or whatever that is but\nall i know is that at the moment\nit felt\ngood to the level that it\ni never want to feel like that again\never\nyou never want it to feel like that\nagain\nno it was it was it was a\naddictive power\nlike it's a good thing that my father\nwasn't in the picture\nat that time because i probably wouldn't\nhave stopped\nthe only thing that stopped me was uh\nwas when carlos came back and i saw how\nafraid he was of me\nand that's when i decided that without a\ndoubt i was going to join the military\nand i was going to be taught how to\ncontrol my aggression\nand they did do that they taught me the\ndiscipline\nso that i would never falter again\nnever let it out again and\nand i also sought some therapy uh\nthrough my\nchaplain while i was in there and they\nhelped\nit was more religious oriented but it\ndid the job for a bit\nand uh i got through it\nand it hasn't happened since\nbut that's why that's where that's\nthat's why i'm afraid of it\ngood reason to be afraid\ni i wasn't even fully grown man\ndo you have anger still within you\nyeah but it it doesn't get that\nit doesn't get there anymore i i i found\nways to\nto deal with it or not\nangry at\ni mean i guess a lot of things but\ni honestly don't know\nso jeremy sometimes people\nsuffer from depression and\none way to look at depression is that\nit's anger directed against the self\ndo you ever direct anger towards you\nyeah how\nfrequently i mean is that a big part of\nthe anger that you allow yourself to\nfeel\nwell i start to feel it towards somebody\nelse and i try to\nblame myself because i don't want to\nhurt someone else\ni i guess there's a part of me that\ndoesn't believe it's my fault but i make\nmyself\nbelieve that it is so that way it\ndoesn't\ni don't ever hurt anybody like that\nagain\ni can't can't ever let that happen again\ni can get behind that and at the same\ntime\ni think you're doing something kind of\ntricky to yourself right\nyeah so the solution that you found is\nto take\neverything that other people do wrong\nand blame yourself instead\nthat certainly ain't going to help the\nimposter syndrome\nright because each insult that is done\nto you suddenly you become the one at\nfault\nyeah and we see this a lot with people\nwho like\nfrankly we see this at i mean i see this\na lot when i think about abusive\nrelationships or codependency\nwhere you know it's it's not his fault\nhe hit me\nit's my fault because i didn't do\nsomething and i made him angry\nand in a weird way you know i hear you\nblaming yourself in order to protect\nother people from your anger\nand it's hard because i i think you you\nseem to think that if you stop\ndoing that then what would happen\ni don't know that's\ni i you know\nit's reason why i don't drink or or\ndo any uh anything that inhibits my\nmental facilities\nbecause you know i\ni understand that trying to control\neverything is bad\nbut i suppose for better or worse it's\nthe best way\nyou know how yeah i convinced myself\nthat it was\nthat it was better to suffer from trying\nto control everything too much\nthan the risk that would take if i gave\nup too much\nwell obviously ideally it'd be the\nmiddle but\ni haven't found that yet yeah i mean\nthere you've got it bro\nright you're not alone there\nis that if you take the blame on all on\nyourself then like things in a sense\nbecome\neasy because then you're in control\nright because if it's all your fault\nthen\nyou get to control the role of the dice\nyeah but i think this kind of comes back\nto like now we see why you have the\nburden of responsibility\nbecause you are the dungeon master of\nyour life you're all powerful\nand all things come down to you\nand so no wonder you see a burden the\nmore people that you\ninteract with the bigger your groups get\neach of their responsibilities you take\nunto yourself\nand it weighs you down because you're\ntaking the responsibility of 36 people\nor 40 people yeah\nwe haven't even talked about i don't\nknow if you're in a in a romantic\nrelationship or not or if you've got\nkids or anything like that but\ni don't have any kids i've i've been\nwith uh\ni've been with my fiance for 11 years\nso i mean there's maybe a whole other\nconversation there about\nwhat that relationship is like and\nyeah how you feel about that how you\nrelate to her\ni'm assuming it's a woman but yeah yeah\nno it is yeah\nyou know\nyeah jeremy do you see a road forward\nfrom here\nwell\ni don't know why i think this way\ncertainly i i have no precedent\nor or or teacher\nfrom my childhood to have instilled this\nin me but\nat least not that i can remember um\nbut i see my life getting better\nbecause if i'm completely honest it is\nit is bad the imposter syndrome\nbut all the other asset like facets of\nmy life are getting better\ni don't worry about about like\nfinancial stuff anymore or i don't worry\nthat i'm wasting my time\nyou know like like job like uh what's\nthe word i'm looking for they're like um\ni don't know what to call that like i\nmade a bad gamble with my career\ni guess you know um\nmy family is doing better i helped i\nhelped\nmy mom beat cancer so\nthat kind of stuff's kind of working out\nthere\num you know it's\nmy life is not as bad as it was\nit has gotten better so i have so i\nguess the way forward here is\nyou know um\nseek some therapy that can help me\nthat can put the time in to unravel this\nwilderness um to help me through it\nbut i mean i\ni was i was taught something one of the\nfew positive things i was taught with my\ngrandfather\nwas that\nappreciate the water not the fish you\ncatch\nthat's what he told me and that really\nresonated with me\nthat fact of the matter is\ni'm here where so many people\nin my family haven't been anywhere near\nwhere i am\nthat i can help people that i cannot\nworry about money that i can\ndo something that i'm truly proud of\nand it gives me hope that even though\nthis\nvoice is in my head that it it won't be\nthere forever and even if it is\nthen i'll find a way to manage it\nbecause i i believe in what i do\ni think it makes the world a better\nplace so\nso yeah i guess that's yeah so i think\nthat sounds\ngreat and i want to share a couple of\nkind of principles so the interesting\nthing is you're saying everything is\ngetting better on the outside you know\nit's it's funny because mental health\nlike so we're getting better at cancer\nwe're getting better at heart disease\nand we're getting worse at mental health\nlike why is that so i think that this is\nsomething that\nyou know people discovered in india a\ncouple thousand years ago is that\nthe better the more we take care of\nthings on the outside\nthe more that internal problems begin to\narise\nand that if you look at like what a monk\ndoes one of my teachers once told me\nthat anything you accomplish in the\nmaterial world is going to be\neasy mode compared to like anything you\naccomplish in the inner world\nany task that you set your mind to\naccomplish outside of yourself\nis going to be easier than anything you\ndo within yourself\nand it's it's kind of weird but there's\nlike another really interesting\nkind of strange conundrum in the eastern\ntraditions which is that\nyou know in the in like ancient india\nsometimes some people are familiar with\nthe caste system are you familiar with\nthat\nthere were like casts and yeah somewhat\nyeah yeah so just that you're born into\nthem\nexactly right so like there were\nforecasts so the the highest caste is\nthe brahman or the priest\ncast yeah below them or the chatrias or\nwarriors or nobles\nthey're the kings the warrior cast\nthe leader cast below them or the\nmerchants and below them or the laborers\nand so the really funny thing is that if\nyou look at all of the the\nthe people who founded religions\nor are divine or attained enlightenment\ncall it whatever you want to one is\nhistorical they like\nbasically started a religion like buddha\nfor example\num another way to think about them so\nthey're viewed as divine by some people\nbut another way to think about it is\nthey attained this like\nsort of superhuman state called\nenlightenment\nthe funny thing is that none of them are\npriests\nwhich is kind of weird because they're\nthe experts in meditation\nall of the enlightened beings that come\nout of india buddha included\nare kings and so then it begs the\nquestion\nwhy don't priests get enlightened if\nthey're the experts on meditation\nand the answer is because you have to\nsettle your material world\nto really fight the internal\nit makes sense and what happened with\nbuddha is he\nwon the game of life right like you have\na fulfilling career it sounds like\nyou've got a good relationship sounds\nlike you're\npatching things up and so imposter\nsyndrome arises\nthere's a reason why imposter syndrome\narises the most\nthe more successful you are the more\nimposter syndrome gets worse\nand i think it kind of speaks to this\nage-old principle of like material stuff\nis easy compared to internal style\nnow that may not be entirely true and i\nthink a lot of times\nyou know people have very genuine\nout outward circumstances case in point\neight year old you 13 year old 16 year\nold you\nyeah but i i think that\nyou've got to be careful because just\nbecause things in the outside world\nare getting better i think they're\ngetting better because you worked on\nthem\nand you have to work on this too\nand i think a couple of things i think\nif you want to see a therapist that's\nfantastic\na couple of i don't know how else to do\nit really yeah so we don't know how to\nwork on that\nwe can teach you right that's what i'm\nhere\nyeah yeah so the first thing is to i'd\nsay just be aware\nof what you're angry at and i'd start\nwith anger\nand i think that there's a have faith\nin the structures that you've put to\ncontrol your anger\ni don't think that like exploring your\nanger is going to turn you into 16 year\nold you\nlike you're just a different person\nright like you're like you failed your\nsaving throw back then but like\nyou're saving throws you're like you're\njust way better now\nso you're you're not going to be 16\nagain you're just\nthe reason you feel like an imposter is\nbecause arcadium is not\nentirely you but you're not entirely 16\nyear old jeremy either\nyou're both yeah right so you're like\nyou're like a whole party\nof people and there's one person who's\nbeen lagging behind and\nand needs your help so start by being\naware\nof what you feel and i'd start with\nanger\nseeing a therapist is i think a good\nthing the second thing is that just like\nyour grandfather said\nappreciate the water don't worry about\nthe fish\nand in that way like do the work that\nyou came here to do\nand whether it serves an as an escape\nfor people or not like that's up to them\nyeah right you're going to show up with\nyour fishing rod\nand your bait and your tackle and your\nboat and you're gonna sit there and\nyou're gonna put your\nline into the water whether the fish\nbite or not is like that's not up to you\nlike what what's yours to control is the\npreparation that you put in and the fact\nthat you show\nup but the second you start\nexpecting those fish to bite the second\nyou beat yourself up for those fish not\nbiting\nwhich i think you do a lot yeah\nthat's the problem right so notice that\nnotice that it's a very subtle threshold\nand on the outside it looks exactly the\nsame\nwhat like the two people one person who\nexpects a fish to bite one person who\ndoesn't expect a fish to bite\non the outside they look exactly the\nsame\nit's just one of them is okay right huh\nbut one\ngets a pleasant surprise yep yeah and\none of them\nat the at best meets their expectation\nyeah so i think you've got to start\nsharing that responsibility man\nit's not yours and that too i think\nyou've you've described it really well i\nthink you've\ncreated a compensatory mechanism\nfor yourself which is like\ni'm gonna take the blame so that i don't\nhave to be angry at other people\nand so that's something you really gotta\npay attention to\ni think this is where really looking at\nyour romantic relationship which\nyou know i think is going to be more\ncould have a lot of\nhow can i say this mal adaptations\nto it in terms of you know you may be\ntaking more of the blame than you should\nor maybe even like sometimes you lose\ncontrol a little bit with her\nthings like that like because it's just\nnot tenable sometimes it's unfortunate\nbut sometimes we show the worst part of\nourselves or we give the worst part of\nourselves\nthe people that we're closest to\nyeah i have infinite patience with\nanyone i'm talking about on stream\nunfortunately sometimes i'll you know\nget upset with my kids\nbecause they can be infuriating\nand it doesn't make me you know a bad\ndad and it's something i work on but\nlike just be careful about the people\nthat are closest to you\nyeah and the last thing is in terms of\nimposter syndrome so now i'll explain\njust a little bit about it so\nimposter syndrome tends to arise when\nour internal sense of worth\nis far outweighed by our external sense\nof work\nso when the world starts treating us\nlike we're the hottest shits and slice\nof bread\nand we feel like we're nothing special\nthat's when imposter syndrome arises\nso it's it's like applying to medical\nschool versus getting in\nthere's a huge difference even though\nit's like a 24-hour period\nwhere one day you were applying and one\nday you'd get in\nand and so oddly enough that you know\nthe the what i've seen working with a\ncouple of influencers and\nand other people basically the more\nsuccessful you are the more vulnerable\nyou are to imposter syndrome\nand that internal sense of self-worth i\ndon't know where you live now but like\nspending some time with nature is a\nreally really good way to get in touch\nwith yourself\num i guess\nnot really a lot going well there's uh\nthere's a park there i could try that\nyeah are you in the u.s\nyeah i'm in texas do you mind if i ask\nwhat part of texas\nuh fort worth uh saginaw yeah so like\nthere's gotta be like you know i mean\nthey're like a ton of national parks\nin texas yeah you may have something\nthat's like an hour away or something\nlike that i mean i'd say go there the\nweather in texas is getting real nice\nnow\nyeah it is um and and so\nyou know i'd spend some time away from\npeople and kind of like with yourself\nthat's a good way to kind of think about\nit the other thing about imposter\nsyndrome is that\nyou know i think lastly like uh jeremy\nyou need to let that voice be there\nand don't try to beat the [ __ ] out of it\nyou know like it's it's okay to have\ndoubt about what you're capable of\nbecause like i want you to just think\nabout that voice in a slightly different\nway like that voice is scared\nit's a representation of your doubt it's\na representation of your insecurity\nand when when you you know when you tell\nyours like when\nwhen jeremy comes to arcade and says hey\ni'm afraid that we're not going to be\nable to do this\nand arcadium is like sit the [ __ ] down\nand shut the [ __ ] up\nright that's not that's gonna just make\nthat voice come back\nlater because you haven't done anything\nto address its fears\nthe right way to talk to that voice is\nhey man i understand you're scared\nand it's okay to be scared and it may\ncome crashing down around us\nand that's okay\nall right i'll try that\nsee now there are feelings\nah yeah what are you feeling\na little sad a little happy\ni don't know all of it i guess a little\nbit of\na little bit everything what makes you\nsad\nwhen i was speaking those words what\nwere you thinking about\nhow much suffering i've put myself\nthrough if\nif this works then that's all i had to\ndo\ni guess be careful good\nso be careful it's not\nit's not that's not how it works so this\nis the crazy thing that happened so this\nis how we hold ourselves back\nthis is subtle okay but pay a lot of\nattention to this\nany time we take a step forward\nyou know what we do we blame ourselves\nfor not taking it earlier\nwe this is the way it's funny you know i\nwas talking at the beginning about\nhow we're trying to like make more kind\nof discreet content on youtube and like\nthis is one of the pieces that i filmed\nthis past week\nhow we turn our successes into failures\nbecause anytime we take a step forward\ninstead of\nbeing happy with ourselves instead of\nbeing proud of ourselves\ninstead of giving ourselves a pat on the\nback what do we what have we conditioned\nourselves to do\nwhy didn't you do it earlier yeah\nso we take what should be a success and\nwe turn it into a failure\nand no wonder we're stuck\nyeah cut yourself some slack\njeremy it's it's a long road ahead\nlearn to talk to yourself see even that\nis the same thing\nit's the same way that you talk to\nyourself don't talk to yourself like\nthat\ninstead of what you need to tell\nyourself is hey man it's okay that we\ndidn't learn this earlier\nright like\nlike be the person that tells you like i\ndon't know if your dad ever told you\nstuff like this maybe your grandfather\ndid but like you need to be like that\nlike the person that your dad should\nhave been\nfor yourself which is that hey man\nyou're gonna learn at your own pace\nsome people pick things up slow and some\npeople pick things up fast you'll get\nthere in the end\nit's so automatic you got to be careful\nokay last thing is meditation you\ninterested in learning meditation\nsure if i can i'll try\nwhat do you mean if you can\ni'm not very chill\nwho says he has to be chill to meditate\ni guess i was wrong to say that i'm\nsorry i didn't mean\nno no you're not wrong i'm just\nchallenging your perception\nit's just because you sit still\ni said still\nwhy when you said meditation i thought\nof like sitting there not doing anything\nyeah so you're telling me you're not\ngood at sitting there or not doing\nanything\nno no i'm not okay so that's totally\ncool so we'll teach you\na form of meditation that does not\ninvolve you sitting there not doing\nanything\nokay sorry we were talking about monks\nand then so i got in my head i was just\ngonna\ni don't just sit there and not do\nanything yeah and so that's a reasonable\nso that's why i challenged it jeremy\nbecause that's\na completely reasonable response and\nthis is one of the things that frankly\ninfuriates me\nis that somewhere along the way we\nstarted to think that meditation was\nonly one thing\nwhich is that you have to be tranquil\nand you have to be still no [ __ ] that\nokay i'm gonna blow my nose real quick i\nencourage you to do the same\nbecause i'm gonna ask you to breathe\nokay this is gonna be kind of weird\nokay all right i want you to sit forward\nat the edge of your chair\nokay and i want you to put your hands\non your knees and kind of lean forward\nokay like you ever been sick to your\nstomach\noh yeah yeah yeah like you know like\nwhen you when you're sick to your\nstomach and you're kind of like leaning\nover\nlike you're trying to figure out if\nyou're gonna throw up or not yep yep so\nthat's the\nthe posture we're gonna we're gonna yeah\nokay so\ni want you guys to lean forward you all\ncan do this too i know it sounds it\nfeels kind of weird so now what we're\ngoing to do is i'm going to\ni'm going to demonstrate okay so i'm\ngoing to put my head down i'm going to\nlet my head hang down\nand then i'm going to breathe in and i'm\ngoing to move my head up\nand then as i exhale i'm going to come\nback down\nokay okay all right we don't need to sit\nstill\nokay so head down and let your head hang\njust feel that for a second okay just\nlet your head\nreally hang down sponsored by audio\ntechnica\nand now breathe so breathe in through\nyour nose\nbig breath and bring your head up\nand then down\nagain\nand out\nthree more breaths at your own pace\nhmm\nyou're done just let your head hang\nnow we're going to do five more deep\nbreath\nin go\nnow\nin\nout\nin\nout\nin\nout\nlast one\nin and\nout\nnow we're going to do the last round\nlast version\nnow we're going to do is we're going to\nuse our back too so i want you to hunt\nyour back\nand then as you breathe in you're going\nto move your head up and then you're\ngoing to\nraise your back and then as we breathe\nout we're going to compress\nand move our head down okay\nokay okay so start from the\nyou know curve your back let your head\nhang\nand begin deep breath in\nand then out\nin as your head comes up straighten your\nback and then curve the other way\nall the way back and out\nagain deep breath in\nhead is up back straightens back curves\nhead is all the way\nback and out\nhead starts to curve forward back starts\nto straighten and then down\nand then two more rounds\nout\nnow with this last round really pay\nattention to the signals in your body\nand now sit up straight when you're done\nhow do you feel\nyeah pretty good actually\nyeah you gotta get gotta get that so\njeremy your emotion\nis gonna be locked up not only in your\nmind but in your body\nso you gotta get that body moving\nit's not just exercise so overwhelming\nevidence suggests that mind body\npractices\nare superior to exercise when it comes\nto physical and mental health\neven things like arthritis tai chi is\nsuperior to exercise\nand it's not just about what you do with\nyour body it's about what you do with\nyour mind\nand if you don't like to sit still don't\nsit still\nwhat were you thinking about or what was\nyour mind doing or focusing\non when you were doing the practice\nnothing just there you go who's bad at\nmeditation now my dude\nokay right yeah\nthat's the point to enter a no\nmind state because the more time we\nspend in a no mind state\nimposter syndrome can't exist there\nliterally\nit's thoughts it's emotions and the more\nthat you focus on the sensations in your\nbody\nwhen you open yourself up when you start\nto\nchannel your piranha and clean it out\nokay i see what you mean so for you\nit's not so much about meditating for\nenlightenment it's really about\nbalancing your prana or your vital life\nforce\nwhat's the uh\nwhat's that clap the tension tension is\nthe two e class right\nyeah yeah yeah these are like kenshin\nexercises\nit's nice to talk with a fellow boomer\nwho understands 2e because like i think\ntoo he's the best system man\noh man oh it's so good\nsee here here's the interesting thing\neveryone thinks like nowadays everyone's\nlike\ncaught up in balance and like tui wasn't\nbalanced at all but back in the day it\nwasn't about balance it was about flavor\nyeah haste aged you a year yeah dude\nthose are the days right like that [ __ ]\nso good yeah every time you cast haste\nyou get aged for a year feels bad man\nbut that's the price you gotta pay\ni'm human [ __ ] i'm elf nice\n[Laughter]\nthat system was so broken man\nbeing a bard you had to be three classes\nleveled at the same time\nuh yeah like a prestige class\nit's good stuff no paladin there was no\nsuch thing as a prestige class until you\ndo\nwell duel class is what you get and that\ncame out in uh\nyeah dual class was op man yeah yeah\nyeah\nmost op you can get because humans could\nswitch to a class\nand then everybody else had yeah yeah\nyeah humans were so op\nstupid cheating humans do whatever they\nwant yep\nyeah man they lived 40 years teehee\nyeah cool dude so you you run 5e games\nor what\noh i mean i\nuh i've ran everything i i've i've\nadverse but right now i run heavily\nhomebrewed fifth edition games\nokay like it's um and i run it in a\ncustom\nsetting that i've worked on for well\nsince i was 13 so 18 years now\nwow and yeah oh it's\nit's definitely my life's work it's\nawesome\nthat's great man i'm so happy about it\nit's\nfifth edition is a great system for\naccessibility\nbut it lacks complexity to kind of hold\nplayers in and to give them depth\nso what i did was is i like tried to\ni tried to augment that missing piece\nand add it\nthrough story elements and it's really\nbeen working out i think\npretty pretty good the system still\nlimits the size of my\nof my sandbox but yeah i can at least\nbuild high\nso it's pretty good yeah that's cool man\nwell listen dude\nlike best of luck to you thanks a lot\nfor coming on\num you know good luck with this journey\nman because i i think you\nyou know you don't deserve to treat\nyourself this way\nfor much longer you got to be free from\nthis man\nthanks thanks for all your help\nyou're very welcome man good luck to you\nyou really did help\ni hope so man take care yeah\nall right see you later"
