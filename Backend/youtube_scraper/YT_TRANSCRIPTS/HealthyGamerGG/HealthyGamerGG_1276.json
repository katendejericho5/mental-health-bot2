    "video_title": "PSYCHEDELICS: A Conversation With Rick Doblin | Dr. K Interviews",
    "transcript": "it felt like an oasis of sanity in a\ncrazy world\nand so it's not that unusual that there\nwould be a guidance counselor there that\nwould know about\nlsd research thanks a lot for coming\nrick so we're live\num just so let me just introduce you\nagain so this is\na rick doblin he's the founder and\nexecutive director of maps which is the\nmultidisciplinary association for\npsychedelic studies\ni know that uh a lot of our community\nhas been very interested in psychedelics\nrecently there's been a lot\nof uh studies that have come out showing\nthe potential benefits\nof using psychedelics um as mental\nhealth treatments and i know\nother will kind of get into how it has\nadditional uses\num and so i i think a lot of that\nfrankly is due to you rick because maps\nhas been funding studies and\nyou've been a long-term proponent for\ndecades\nsince 1986 is when i started maps but\nbut really since 1972\nwhen i was 18 when i decided to focus on\npsychedelics\nyeah so thank you so much for all of\nyour hard work and dedication because i\ni do think that psychedelics are going\nto offer a really wonderful opportunity\nin psychiatry um just a quick disclaimer\nthat you know psychedelics are currently\nnot\nreally medically approved treatments for\nanything so um\nyou know we don't really re or i don't\nrecommend that you guys use them\nwe'll talk a little bit more about that\num so\nyou know in the studies as i understand\nthem are done in relatively controlled\nenvironments\nwith controlled dosing and sort of a\ncertain amount of\npurity of like what people are using so\na lot of times things are contaminated\nand so you know steer clear of that but\nrick i i know you may disagree\nwell um i i think our clinical studies\nare done in a highly controlled\nenvironment with\npre-screened patients with\nmedical tests to make sure that they're\nfine\nto handle the experience and then it's a\ntwo-person therapy team\nwith them for eight hours and there's\nbeen preparation and\nintegration so yeah it's a highly\ncontrolled environment\num but i i do think that um\nsome of the most important experiences\ni've had um\nafter i was quite familiar with\npsychedelics was doing them on my own in\nthe woods in nature\num some once actually on my own in a\nflotation tank\nfor 17 hours oh wow\nwith a big dose of lsd\nso i i do think that it's wise to have\nsomebody\nthat's not under the influence of\npsychedelics kind of like a designated\ndriver\nbecause you can go deeper when you feel\nreally safe and you're not worried about\nthe interaction with the outside world\nsomebody at the door the phone or\nanything like that\num and also i i do think that\nthere is a lot to be uh gained from\nother contexts than therapeutic context\nbut but the concern i have there is just\nthat\nwhen people take them in more of a what\nyou would say recreational or\ncelebratory context\nif you're just doing it to have fun one\nof the big dangers is that when\ndifficult stuff comes up\nand psychedelics do kind of impact this\nmembrane between the unconscious and the\nunconscious mind and\nthings that are emotionally charged come\nto the surface if you're just trying to\nhave fun\nand something difficult comes up if you\ntry to stuff it down\nand not focus on it you could end up\nworse off for months or years later\nso i think the attitude going into it\nis very important regardless of whether\nit's a therapeutic setting or\nany kind of settings back in the 80s\nwhen mdma was first being\nwell it was middle 70s actually that\nmdma under the code name adam was first\nbeing used\nin therapy settings and then eventually\nescaped\nout of those therapeutic settings and\nwas used uh recreationally under the\nname ecstasy\nthere was still sasha shulgin who was\nthe chemist that\nreally helped pioneer this whole area\nand sort of rediscovered\nmdma he and his wife anne had a several\npage mimeographed information sheet that\nthey handed out along with the drug and\nand\nit ended up with remember there is no\nsuch thing as a casual experiment\nexperiment you do have to take it\nseriously\neven though it may not be in a\ntherapeutic or\nreligious uh spiritual setting it's\nstill you shouldn't underestimate these\nsubstances and just don't approach it\ncasually yeah\nso rick just in that vein i've actually\nhad a lot of people reach out saying\nthat they've had\nptsd or anxiety develop after\nusing lsd or other psychedelics what do\nyou think about that\num i think that that's um very\nit's not uncommon i mean again it's when\nyou take these situa\nlsd and psilocybin and\nthe classic psychedelics operate by\ndissolving your sense of self\nyou know which can lead to this sense of\ndeeper unity and connection but it also\nhelps um if people are are not feeling\nsafe in a way it can contribute to\npeople\nfeeling like they're losing their mind\nor that often we are so identified with\nour ego with our sense of who we\nare that the ego dissolution is\nsometimes confused with physical death\nthat ego death or ego dissolution is\noften\nconfused with physical death um stan\ngroff\nwho's um sort of the world's leading lsd\nresearcher and therapist\num he started doing lsd research in the\n50s in the czech republic he's 89 now\nand we just published his book way of\nthe psychonaut for\nencyclopedia in her journey so i highly\nrecommend that for people but he told a\nstory about how\nhe watched a bunch of people um\ndoing lsd before he ever did it himself\nyou know now these are patients and he\nwas the the psychiatrist in this part of\nhis training\nand he saw how this confusion between\nego dissolution and ego death and\nphysical death\noften manifests um and so when he had\nhis first lsd\nexperience and he started going through\nthat same thing he\nuh for a temporarily he persuaded\nhimself that somehow or other because he\nhad had a\na special illness when he was like six\nyears old that that had altered his\nbody chemistry such that even though\nhe knew that other people when they\nstarted feeling that they were dying it\nwas actually not true\nfor him he thought it was really true\nbecause he had this\nillness when he was six and it only took\nhim it took him a while to work through\nthat but\nthis just relates to your question that\npeople can uh\nwhen difficult stuff comes up and you\ntry to um\npush it down or you don't feel safe in\nthe context to explore it\nyou have now created a situation where\nthese memories that have been\nunconscious are now sort of\nhalfway conscious halfway not and\nyou can have very difficult experiences\nin therapeutic settings in the future\nand also underground settings and i've\ndone this\num you know back before mdma was illegal\nbut you know when people have difficult\nexperiences with lsd or psilocybin\nwhat you can do is give half a dose of\nmdma\nand what that does it's not like a\ntranquilizer that sort of\ntries to take you out of it and freezes\nthe conflict in place\nbut what it does is it reduces the fear\nof whatever it is that you're concerned\nabout the fear of dying the fear of\ngoing crazy\nor traumatic memories that are coming up\nand then you can process it\nso that you know that would be the if\npeople go to the emergency rooms or\nsomething because they've got a panic\nattack from lsd the ideal solution and i\nknow emergency rooms aren't\nprepared for this at least not yet would\nbe to give a half dose of mdma\nand then keep them processing it and\nprovide that sort of support\ninteresting so rick you mentioned that\nyou've been doing\nkind of you've been interested in\npsychedelics for a long time can you\njust\ntell us a little bit about like what\nyour upbringing was like and\nyeah um yeah i'd be very glad um\nyeah so it was really um i was born in\n1953\nand i was born in in chicago um\nyou know i feel like the sort of\nclassic american story in that\ngrandparents on one side great\ngrandparents on the other side were\nimmigrants\nthey came fleeing anti-semitism and\nviolence against jews in russia and\npoland to the united states\nand then after a couple generations they\nwere successful\num my great grandfather was the classic\nrags to riches in the sense that he was\nactually a rag salesman\ncollected rags and um there was a family\nstory about one time in the winter in\nchicago he's on his horse collecting\nrags and there was a little\ncart behind him and he froze to the\nsaddle\nand my great-grandmother had come out\nwith hot water and\npour it there so that he could unfreeze\nfrom the saddle\num and eventually build a paper company\num\nso i was um\nand then after in his 60s he sold the\npaper company my great grandfather moved\nto palestine\nand built a house there in 1924 that is\nnow a historical site\non rothschild boulevard and it's kind of\nan iconic image of\nisrael and tel aviv because the house\nhas been preserved but\nin the backyard is a skyscraper and\nright across the street is another\nskyscraper so it's in the middle of this\nyou know very commercial district but it\nwas\nwhen the house was built just um less\nthan a hundred years ago\nit was just sand around it it was yeah\num so\nthe the all that is to say is that i've\nbeen raised on stories of the holocaust\nand you know the foundation of the state\nof israel the\nsort of the response to the the\nholocaust\nand my father was a doctor um so i you\nknow my family was well off\nand so i just was given i'd say the\nthe gift of security in order to\nlook at more deeper risks\nwhat do i mean by that what i mean is\nthat um\nyou know prejudice genocide um\nyou know those those you could you could\nbe financially secure as a lot of people\nwere in germany\nyou know before hitler and then you\nstill end up dying\num you know so that the deeper threat is\nthis kind of\num\nproblem of the human spirit you could\nsay humanity as a whole\nis um a lot of people are um willing to\ndehumanize others to be racist\nto um think of us as separate from\nnature and trash nature\nso rick this is a deeply interesting and\nphilosophical kind of take\ni'm kind of curious what was your act\nlike i mean were you thinking this way\nwhen you were like 12\ni was yeah see my father's hero was saul\nlewinsky\nand so saul alinsky wrote the book rules\nfor radicals he's a community organizer\nin chicago obama studied with saul\nlinsky you know his approaches um\nso my my family was very um progressive\nyou could say so you grew up in chicago\nyeah i grew up in chicago i grew up in a\nplace called\nuh well first off in skokie\nand sometimes people know of skokie\nbecause\nit's heavily jewish a lot of survivors\nof the holocaust\nand at one point in time about i guess\nit was even 30 or 40 years ago\nthe american nazis wanted to march\nthrough skokie and the american civil\nliberties union defended them\nand um as a right of free expression and\nand they lost a lot of support but i i\ndo think they did the whole\nthe right thing but in any case i grew\nup surrounded by\njewish people i was um six years old and\nmy family tells this story i thought the\nwhole world was jewish\nbecause that was the whole world that i\nknew and my parents\nwhen they realized that they said no no\nno we're like a fraction of one percent\nof the whole world\nand i got really scared and i'm like\nwell you know what if they're right you\nknow what if\nyou know christ is the messiah we're\ngoing to hell you know\nand they were just like well just you\nknow we don't know about that but we're\na tiny tiny minority\nand so this idea of um\nsort of yeah security\num and the concerns of the world\nthat i was really moved in this\ndirection and so\nwhen i was um growing up before i became\num\n12 was the cuban missile crisis and so\nthat was something else that was deeply\ndeeply traumatizing you're a little kid\nin school you know today\nsometimes the little kids in school have\nactive shooter drills\nwhich is terrifying but this other idea\nthat\nthere could be a nuclear war between the\nthe russia\nand the united states and we have all\nthese weapons and it could\nblow up the whole world then you know\nand then you're saying what\nhow was that traumatizing in what way\nwell you just think of how insane that\nis\nyou know that um we could be destroying\nthe world you know for these um\npolitical conflicts and also that you're\ntold you know duck and cover\nyou know get under your\ni'm sorry um you know duck under your\ndesk\nand then you you might survive\nyou know and then you see all these\nmovies of hiroshima and nagasaki and\nwhat's going on there what happened\nthere so it just was terrifying that\nthat\nthis was beyond like um genocide\nof the concentration camps now this was\nlike we could lose the whole world and\nthat this could be pois\ni remember reading i love to read\nyou know there was a book i read called\non the beach which people probably don't\nknow\nmuch about today but it was about um\npeople that were on the beach in\naustralia\nand this was after a nuclear war and\nthey were waiting for the radioactive\nfallout to you know come to them in the\nwind\nso it was like post-apocalypse you know\npost-nuclear war waiting for them all to\ndie\nso it just expanded my sense that\npsychological factors um the way that we\ncan dehumanize others the way that we\ncan make other people the enemies the\nway we lose our\nsense of common humanity that that that\nwas a real\ncritical problem and and i i recall\neinstein saying that our technology has\nexceeded our humanity\nso rick yeah yeah i'm i'm noticing so\nsometimes i'll ask you about kind of\nyour experience of growing up\nand i i for example i asked you know\nwhat was traumatizing about that\ni noticed that a lot of your answers\nhave to do with the world\nyeah that like you know the world was a\nscary place that gender that we had\nexceeded so i i'm\ni'm kind of curious about you know use\nyour mind seems to have a focus\non the outside\nthat you're sort of thinking about these\nlike broad existential\nor cultural or societal or worldly\nproblems about like\nthe nature of humanity losing our\nhumanity that our humanity has been\nexceeded by our technology so i'm kind\nof so i'm i'm sort of\ni'm just kind of noticing that we don't\nseem to be talking about like when i ask\nyou about you\nyou talk about the world ah well\nmy my parents were married for 67 years\nbefore my father died\num i had a big extended family of\ngrandparents aunts and uncles and\ncousins\nso my personal life was\nreally secure and beautiful you know i\nhad loving parents loving grandparents\nbig extended family um\ni'll share something else about me\npersonally um when i was 12\nwe moved from chicago from skokie to\nwinnetka\nwhich is a little bit further north\nsuburb and my parents\nhad a house that was they they had a\nhouse designed by a student of frank\nlloyd wright's\nand so i grew up in this incredibly\nbeautiful\nstructure that had an enormous impact on\nme personally and how i thought\nyou know frank lloyd wright sort of\nblends inside and outside\nthe whole idea that the you know the\ninside flows to the nature outside um\nit was a chinese pagoda with a big eight\nfoot by eight foot square skylight at\nthe top it was a one-story house but the\nroof went up 22 feet so i had\nit wasn't a box i didn't grow up living\nin a box i grew up\nwith an indoor atrium where we had a\ntree that was like\n15 20 feet high inside the house and i\ncould see from my bed\nthrough the skylight uh the moon and the\nsnow\nand the rain at night and i could see\nthe whole house had stained glass\nwindows\nuh not saying sliding glass doors i mean\nsorry it did have some stained glass\nwindows too but it had sliding glass\ndoors\nuh between as the exterior walls\nand we had a very private location so\nyou know it just flowed from the inside\nand out and\none of the biggest influences on me as i\nwas growing up was um\nyou know this house the the other part\nwas that i feel now\nin retrospect that i had absolutely\neverything that could be done\nto give me a sense of self-efficacy you\ncould say that i could impact the world\nso\ni was born at the time of america height\nof american power\nyou know before we got uh into vietnam\nand stuff\num i was uh jewish the chosen people\nbefore i realized that everybody's the\nchosen people\num i was white um\nmale i was the first born male child\nand you know my family was well off so i\ni had\num you know probably every advantage\nthat you could\nhave so i guess when i started talking\nabout the world\nthat's where my um my insecurities were\nnot about my own life\nbut were about what the world could\nimpinge\non me in different ways and you know\nwhen you're young jewish too you're also\ntaught about uh jewish history\nand there's just this uh constant theme\nof\nvarious people trying to scapegoat and\nkill the jewish people\nand you know we were jerusalem world is\na dangerous place\nyeah that that was the kind of thing but\ni had that message from the utmo\nsense of security in america after world\nwar ii with\nyou know just where we moved in winnetka\ni i didn't know this at the time but\num they weren't um\na lot of people were unwilling to sell\nthe jewish people so there was four\nhouses\non a cul-de-sac that my parents got\ntogether with three of their jewish\nfriends and they had a christian person\nbuy the land and then once the christian\nperson bought the land then they\nseparated out into these four jewish\nfamilies\nwow so the only way we got to live in\nwinnetka was to overcome these\nprejudices against jews interesting so\nthat was a\nbig part of my upbringing um\nand so i guess the other thing is that i\nreally got to\nbe very interested in the other you know\nthat\nand so i studied russian in high school\nto learn about the russians and because\ni had\nmy great grandparents came over from\nrussia and my parents were very much\nopen to educating me experiential\nlearning\nso after my junior year of high school\nmy parents sent me to russia for the\nsummer\nand to study russian and we went to\nsummer con tashkent there's about 60\nother\nhigh school students from around america\nwe went to london to paris\nall over moscow but my parents\nsent me on a mission as well and they\ngave me in my\nluggage they gave me a bunch of prayer\nbooks to give to the people at the\nsynagogue because prayer books were\nforbidden\nat this time in soviet russia which was\nyou know atheist\nso as a 16 year old boy my parents are\nsaying here's this political mission i\nwant you to do bring these prayer books\nto the guys at the synagogue\nwow and because i spoke um\nrussia not very well but well enough to\nget by\non this group of 60 people\n60 high school students uh me and two\nother guys\nwere approached by some of uh russian um\nyoung people as well but they were like\nblack market people\nand so this is now 1970 summer of 1970\nthe psychedelic revolution is happening\nin america didn't happen in russia so\nthe russians wanted to buy anything that\nsmacked of freedom\nso button shirts even or um books or\nalbums somebody had uh abbey road\nand you know they bought the record for\nlike two bucks we sold it\nfor a hundred rubles which was more than\na hundred dollars worth now rubles at\nthe time were not worth\nanything outside of russia so they\ndidn't want anybody to be able to escape\nwith money\nuh but we made thousands and thousands\nof rubles by selling\nstuff from all of the people in our trip\nyou know their clothes they're this and\nthat and we took our cut of course\nand so in the end you know i just had a\nlarge amount of russian rubles\nand i went to the synagogue\nin moscow to um give these prayer books\nthat my parents had sent me to deliver\nand i said to this guy hey i got all\nthis money for you got these prayer\nbooks and the guy said\nhey we're being watched uh don't give me\nanything here but i'll meet you at the\nsubway station\nunderground subway at a certain time at\na certain station and bring the money in\nthe books then\nand i was like okay and i just thought\nokay you know i'm a 16 year old kid if\nthe russians catch me they'll just send\nme home you know can we just pause for a\nsecond rick\ncan you tell me what on earth it's like\nto be given a\ncovert political vision at the age of 16\nlike what's going through your head when\nyour parents are like what was your\nunderstanding of what you were getting\nyourself into\nwell my parents were like uh each of us\nas individuals can make a difference it\nwas very empowering\nit was like look we we can't stop the\nprejudice against the jews we can't\noverturn everything in russia but you\nyourself can bring a few prayer books\nand that is something to do so it\nconnected me with my small life\nand what an individual can do maybe you\ncan't solve the whole uh\nproblem but but you can make a small\ncontribution so\nthat's what i felt like i i thought this\nis a really wonderful thing that my\nparents are thinking\nthat in this small way with a few people\nnow maybe getting a prayer book\ni can make a difference and i think that\nwas that was the main education that i\ngot from them\nis that you can't just stand idly by you\nhave to\nget involved and even if it's you know\nway bigger than any of us\neach of us individually can make a bit\nof a difference wow\nso yeah i i respected them for it and um\nand and also they were telling me that\num they wanted me to take certain risk\nnot only that that they didn't want me\nto find the safe path\num that they wanted me to take certain\nrisks so\nwhen i was 18 two years later and after\ni had been in college\nhold on we got to find out what happened\nwith the did you meet the dude in the\nunderground station\ni did i did so what happened\nwell you know we made the transfer and i\ngot away safe\nand nobody and he got away safely and i\ngave him all these rubles and he was\nsuper happy\nand um and i just felt like wow\nyou know my first underground activities\nwas against the russians\nagainst the communists in russia um\nand it kind of prepared me for uh\naddressing the drug war too\nwhich was also similar you know unjust\nin different ways that means i prepared\nyou for the drug war\nwell you know this was illegal what i\nwas doing in russia\nand so you know once i started wising up\nto the fact that the drug war was\nuh criminalizing tools that could be\nused for\npersonal growth for spirituality that um\nand if i wanted to use them i would\nbecome a criminal myself\nthat that was uh how i was prepared you\nknow that that this\nfirst sort of law breaking was against\nthe communists\nand then this law breaking was against\nrepressive drug war\ninteresting okay so you were saying uh\n18.\nyeah so at 18 now i'll also add that as\ni was growing up my parents\num don't drink alcohol they don't\nthey're both dead now but they they\ndidn't smoke cigarettes they they\nthey were very um rational my\ngrandparents\nmy father's parents had a bookstore they\nwere you know poor immigrants had a\nbookstore they lived above the bookstore\nthat\nthey had only one child but my dad and\nmother were very\num rational and i and i think that\npart of that was about the fear of what\nhappened in nazi germany that the\nirrational\ngets out of control and and we see\nechoes of that in the united states\nright now where rationality and truth\nyou know don't matter and it's to a lot\nof people\nso it was just this um they were very\nrational and so we i didn't have a\nhistory i'm the oldest of four kids too\nso there was no drug use going on in my\nhouse really my dad\nwho was a doctor realized also that a\nlot of what he learned\nin medical school was no longer true so\nwe had a\ndrawer of drugs medicines\nat our house and whenever we get sick my\ndad's attitude was don't take a thing\nyou know you're gonna heal on your own\nit's going to be a little\nfew difficult days the downside of that\nis when i say oh i don't want to go to\nschool i feel bad you know he's like no\nyou better go to school\nso but i just believed the propaganda\nthat i was receiving about psychedelics\nso even though i knew better in other\nways i believed\nthat if you took lsd five or six times\nyou were certifiably insane\nokay that was one of the stories that\nyour sanity is a delicate\nbalance and if you take lsd five or six\ntimes you've\npermanently altered that balance you're\ncertifiably insane\ni believed the idea that you had\nchromosome damage\nand that you would have deformed\nchildren from psychedelics that was\nanother big thing you know i believe\nthat\nthat these drugs were something that\ncaused hallucinations delusions there\nwas nothing\nvalid about them whatsoever\nand it was in my russian class actually\nin my senior year when i was 17\nthat this uh sort of propaganda i\nstarted cracking through the propaganda\na friend of mine in the russian class\ngave me a book to read\nand i just loved it this was a\nphenomenal book\nand when i gave it back to my friend he\nsaid\ndo you realize that some of this book\nwas written\nby the author when he was under the\ninfluence of lsd\nand and i was like that's impossible you\nknow there's nothing good comes from lsd\nhow could you possibly write this great\npiece of literature\nit can't be done and and he encouraged\nme to check into it further which i did\nand it turned out he was right\nit was one one flew over the cuckoo's\nnest by ken keezy\nand some of it indeed had been written\nunder the influence of lsd\nso that that sort of made me think\nhere's all this propaganda that i've got\nit can't\ncan't all be true the other part was\nthat um\nbecause i had thought so much about the\nholocaust about the um\nyou know the human missile crisis and\nall that now i was being confronted as i\nwas getting closer to\n18 about vietnam and i was in one of the\nlast years of the lottery and i was\nyou know we had to face the fact what am\ni going to do about vietnam\nand at the time\nand still if if you want to be what's\ncalled a conscientious objector\nand you can get a deferment for a\nconscientious objector\nyou have to be a pacifist you have to be\nagainst all war\nand i was not against all war i think\nthat there are times when it makes sense\nto defend oneself\nso i couldn't be a conscientious\nobjector and this was also at the time\nuh you know martin luther king was\nassassinated um\na little bit before that and there was\njust so much that was going on about\nvietnam\num when i was actually\num 14\ni was the precinct captain in my area\nfor eugene mccarthy the peace candidate\nin 1968\nand of course he got hardly any votes\nand so i wanted to be closer to the\naction so i actually volunteered\nfor mayor daley who was the mayor of\nchicago and i was a runner\nfor the delegates inside the convention\nof 1968\nand so i was um\ntraumatized there at one point where i\nwas downstairs\nin the sort of um outside of the the\nwhere the main convention was taking\nplace and there was a media room and i\nwent in there and there was all these\ntvs and people were watching tvs and it\nwas tvs of the riots in downtown chicago\nthe police riots against the\ndemonstrators\nand just this way in which uh the\ndelegates were trying to pretend as if\nlife was normal while there was these\nmassive riots going on outside\nit just really further radicalized me so\ni decided to\num that what i would do in terms of\nvietnam\nis that i would not register for the\ndraft\nthat i would not cooperate with the\nsystem\nat all and that i would\ndrain the system of the most energy um\nby having them come after me and i would\ngo to jail\nso i talked this over with my parents\nand they were\nfine they just said the problem is that\nif you do that you're going to be a\nfelon and you're never going to be able\nto be a doctor or lawyer or whatever is\ngoing to require a license\nbut they were not sympathetic with the\nwar in vietnam and\nand so i you know what uh martin luther\nking had said\nthat um he said for those who\nthink a law is unjust and are willing to\nbreak the law\nand suffer the consequences as\na way to send a message to everybody\nelse about the unjust nature of the law\nthat they actually have the highest\nrespect for the law\nso that this kind of civil disobedience\nit's it's you're you're really trying to\nmake the\nsystem of laws better by showing the\ninjustice\nyeah so i i thought that since i was\npaying taxes i had a social security\nnumber i was in\nhigh school you know that i would be\ncaught\nbut as it turned out it was just this\namazing loophole\nthat i didn't register for the draft and\naround\n60 000 other people never registered for\nthe draft and nothing\nhappened to us at all enough people were\nvolunteering for the war\nthat um they had enough recruits\nand somehow or other from\nanticipating going to jail to then\nrealizing nothing's going to happen\nso at a very early stage when i was 18\nthinking that i was going to be caught\nany day but i was in college and i\nstarted doing lsd\nand psilocybin and uh mescaline and\ni started getting this intimations of\num this deeper unity you know beyond\nego identification i had a difficult\ntime with my drug trips because i was\num insecure and\nyou know not very emotionally adept and\nso it was very hard to let go\nit was very i got scared a lot but i\nfelt that this was very important it was\nalso\num 1971 1972. so the the backlash\nagainst the 60s\nreally took place in 1970 with the\ncontrolled substances act and nixon\ncriminalizing all these drugs saying\ntimothy leary was the most dangerous man\nin america\num and so it was after the backlash that\nthat i started\nuh doing these psychedelics and i\nstarted sensing something which was\nthis why did you start well\nbecause of that book because of um one\nflew over the cuckoo's nest\nyou know i just thought this is\nbrilliant\nand if if lsd had something to do with\nthis\nthen it's something that i should\nexplore\nyou know that it it's not just a\nhallucination it's also that i was very\ninterested in psychological\nfactors and this repression how people\ncan be irrational\ni had i had a great class in high school\non young\nit was um so my senior year of high\nschool i had a jungian psychology class\nand the only thing we did for the entire\nsemester was read moby dick\nfrom a jungian perspective and so again\ni started getting more and more\ninterested in psychology\nand that's around the time i started um\nlooking to psychedelics\nand it was really a political\nunderstanding\nthat inspired me the most that if you\ncan\nidentify as part of everything\num you know and that that's your core\nidentity and that your other identities\nof your race or your\ngender your nationality or your religion\nthose are\nsecondary built on top of this common\nhumanity which is also linked intimately\nconnected with nature\nthat that's the antidote to genocide or\nthe antidote to this irrational\ndehumanizing and otherizing others so\nand when i looked at what happened with\nthe 60s and with all the psychedelics\nand how that motivated a lot of people\nto get involved with the anti-war\nmovement\nand also with the environmental movement\nthe women's rights movement civil rights\nmovement\nthat it just felt like in a crazy world\nwhere\nit could we could blow up the whole\nworld with nuclear weapons or there\ncould be another hitler or that their\nmy own country was now doing these\nthings that\nreally seemed um counterproductive and\ndeadly and dangerous\nand and not helpful um it's\nit's just felt like here was a ray of\nhope psychedelics and the psychedelic\nconsciousness\ncan not only do this connection to\nspirituality but can also be used\nto help help us with our own individual\nissues and the fact that they were\ncriminalized\nand wiped out the research wiped out all\nover the world\nand because i at the time i still\nthought i was going to go to jail any\nday and i couldn't have a normal career\ni thought ha\nit all comes together i can potentially\nbe a psychedelic therapist i could be an\nunderground psychedelic therapist\ni don't need a license for that and i\nneed psychedelic therapy myself\nand and i'll just say one other thing\nwhat crystallized it for me was that\num i i had a lot of difficult times with\nmy trips\num and so i went to the guidance\ncounselor at college\nwhat did i mean by difficult yeah yeah\num well to give you one of the worst\nexamples um resistance i was scared\nto so you know psychedelics are moving\nin you they're\nopening you up your your logical train\nof thought is\nuh inhibited and and you're getting\nfeelings and emotions and different kind\nof\nvisual images when your eyes are closed\nsometimes when your eyes are open\nand the sense of uh being safe enough to\nsurrender control and i didn't feel safe\nenough to do that so\none time when i was um yeah at the time\nalso to\nput this in context the standard dose of\nlsd was 250 micrograms which was\na major existential dose right now a lot\nof the\nlsd tabs blotter tabs are like 60 or 80\nmicrograms\nso this is three or four hits at one\ntime and that's\nwas just standard what people took you'd\nbe going through a period of a couple\nhours where you have a hard time to talk\nfor those people that love music one of\nmy absolute favorite albums was\nby david crosby came out during the 60s\nwith people from\nall the other groups from san francisco\nbut the title of the album was\nif i could only remember my name\nso it's a classic psychedelic album it's\nterrific if i could only remember my\nname\nby david crosby so that's what some of\nthese experiences\nwere like and so i i felt like i was\nscared i couldn't let go\nand i had the image of my brain\num heating up like a light bulb you know\nthere's like\na current that and if you resist the\ncurrent\nyou know it lights up and so i felt like\nmy resistance to all this mental energy\nwas such\nthat my brain was actually melting and i\nhad this\nuh nasal drip at the time and i started\nlike\nthinking oh my god that's my brain\ncoming out of my nose\nwow and i would hear my brain sloshing\naround and\nand you know i exaggerated obviously\nmy brain did not melt but that was the\nfeeling of\nyou know one of the worst trips i ever\nhad that i was\nand then what made it even harder is\nthat it was my fault\nyou know that i was bad that i was\nresisting that it wasn't from the lsd\nllc doesn't normally do that it was my\nown weaknesses that was causing this\nterrible situation to happen but i felt\nthat i needed to do it i felt like the\n60s idealism had crashed and burned that\nwe needed to do this inner work to\nfigure out how do we make a better world\nand so i i kept doing lsd and the\nexperiences kept\nbeing more difficult still with\nintimations of some beautiful moments\nand that's where i went to the guidance\ncounselor at college at new college of\nflorida\nin sarasota florida and i said help me\nwith my trip and\nyou know it was a different era then and\nhe took me seriously\nand he said this is important what\nyou're doing and it's\njust as important as your classwork uh\nmaybe even more important\nthat you really need to be seeing a\nyou know you're your own instrument you\nare your own instrument and\nyou need to work on your own clarity as\nwell so that\nyou know we see the world through our\nown blinders the whole scientific method\nis about\ngetting past our own biases the beauty\nof the scientific method is\nuh methodologies to try to make it so\nthat we can see\nmore closely to what's really there\ncompared to what we want to see\nso this guidance counselor gave me a\nbook to read\nand this is what sort of sealed my\nfuture rare guidance counselor\nit was so lucky well beyond lucky\num the book was realms of the human\nunconscious\nobservations from lsd research by stan\ngroff\nthis was 1972. this is stan's first\nbook it wasn't published till 1975.\nso the guidance counselor had a\nmanuscript copy directly from stan\nand reading that book is what\nput it all together for me and i would\nstill recommend that book realms of the\nhuman unconscious\nto people who are looking to understand\nmore about lsd psychotherapy\nbut what stan was talking about was\nsort of three basic areas you could say\nyou know your\npsychodynamics based on stuff that\nhappened when you were\nalive then this um birth trauma\nthis idea of you know going from this\nfloating in your mother's womb to going\nthrough this traumatic situation of\nbirth that that kind of\nimprints things in in consciousness and\nthen beyond that would be the union\nera that he spoke about which was sort\nof archetype spirituality mysticism\nthings that went beyond our own\nindividual life but sort of\nabout all humans and all that he learned\nabout\nthese realms from lsd and so it had that\nmystical spiritual thing which i thought\nwas fundamental for political reasons\nbut\nit also had a scientific overlay\nbecause i had already learned to\ndistrust um\nreligious mythologies that\nyou know a lot of them are you know they\nthey make things too concrete\nthey can be beautiful symbolically but\nwhen they become concrete then you have\nto be\na little bit more suspicious of them and\nthen particularly when people say this\nis the only one right way\nand all that but so this was science\nlooking at um mysticism and spirituality\nin a way i felt was trustworthy\nbut the ultimate thing was that it was\nabout psychotherapy\nso it was about a reality check a\npractical thing\nwhat do all of these mystical what are\nall of these\nexperiences that you can have what do\nthey actually do to help people\nenjoy their lives more to have a deeper\nricher sense of meaning and purpose\nand that that was something because i\nthink you can get lost in spirituality\nand lost in mysticism and and\nwhere do you bring it back down to earth\nand to try to practically\nthat's so practically so i thought this\nwas something reliable so i wrote a\nletter\nto stan groff now i'm just a confused\n18 year old you know doing lsd and\nstands in his\n40s and is\nyou know premier md phd at johns hopkins\ndoing lsd research that was just\nbeing shut down and he wrote me back\nthat was the amazing thing and he\nencouraged me and he said he was doing a\nworkshop that summer\nout in california with joan halifax who\nhe had just been married to\num and he invited me to attend\nwhich i did so i hitchhiked across\namerica in\nsummer of 72 back when people were\nhitchhiking\nsome people have heard about the rainbow\nfestival which is a big gathering\nit's kind of a hippie native american\ngathering and and i saw\nsigns about it the very first one as i\nwas hitchhiking across america and so i\nended up going to the first rainbow\nfestival\nin granby colorado i ended up\nyou know making my way across the\ncountry and i took this workshop with\nstan\ni did a month-long encounter group\nin the mountains of california again\ntrying to work on myself as an\ninstrument i heard about primal therapy\nwhich was sort of the primal scream\nabout this\nbirth trauma and so i did a three-week\nprimal intensive\nand in the end of all of it i wasn't\nwhere i wanted to be i i wasn't\nevolved as much as i hoped i still had\nall sorts of problems\num worries concerns and i i\ni dropped out of college you know i told\nmy parents that\nschool no longer mattered to me that\nthis inner work mattered and i wanted to\nstudy lsd\nand i wanted to drop out of college and\ni wanted them to pay for me to study lsd\nand to give you a sense of how my\nparents were\nit took them a while but they eventually\ndecided yes they would help me\nand my what my dad said was that he\nthought i was a stubborn guy\nand that um if he didn't help me\ni would still try to do that and it\nwould take me a longer amount of time to\nrealize\nit was a mistake and if he helped me\ni would realize it was a mistake sooner\nand he said\nhe had a shred of doubt maybe i needed i\nknew what i needed to do\nso he also validated that so my parents\nwere willing to\nuh help me from age 18 drop out of\ncollege and study lsd and so\nafter i did all these things i went home\nand lived with uh my siblings who were\ngoing to school but i just sat around\nfor a couple months and\nthat's where i realized that i had um\nunderestimated the importance of\nintegration\nand i think to sort of weave this back\nto some of your earlier\ncomments about people who said that they\nhad ptsd or\ndepression or so after their lsd or\npsilocybin experiences\nthat you really need to spend time\nintegrating it that that's the way that\nyou can process these things that\nit's not just about the experience at\nall in fact that's a big\npart of it but it's even more about what\nyou learn from it what you bring back\nhow you integrate it and i had had a\ndelusion\nthat the more drugs you take the faster\nyou take them\nthe more you'll evolve and i just really\ndidn't understand that\nyou could end up digging yourself deeper\ninto all that way you really need to\nintegrate what you've learned and that's\nwhat we've\nyou know totally put into practice in\nterms of our mdma assisted psychotherapy\nlots of emphasis on preparation and\nintegration\nthe experiences are embedded in a larger\npsychedelic\nuh psychotherapy process\nmost of the sessions without drugs at\nall so\ni just really didn't understand that and\nfinally i realized that i was so lost in\nmy head about these\nspirituality philosophical worldly\nthings\nthat i i felt like i needed to get\ngrounded and so that's where i got back\nuh\ni thought i need to build things get in\nthe physical world\nwhich which basically led to 10 years\nfor me\nof building houses building handball\ncourts of just building things\nto help me integrate my psychedelic\nexperiences and it wasn't till i was 28\nthat i was able to go back to college as\na freshman to\nformally study to be a psychedelic\ntherapist\nwow interesting yeah so that's that's\nvery rare you know it's interesting rick\nbecause i i think um\nin a sense i think our story has i have\nsome interesting parallels with my life\nto what\nyou describe and i think this is part of\nthe message that i think\nour community needs to hear so you know\ni finished college at the age of 23\nafter failing a bunch of classes\nand then basically had my parents sort\nof support me with the goal of becoming\na monk\num really yeah yeah and and\nso i was lucky enough because you know i\ni didn't have to worry about\nhow i was gonna pay for a ticket to\nindia and\nand i would you know fly to india and\ni'd stay at ashrams or monasteries and\nand study different kinds of meditations\nand\ni think a little bit more on the\nesoteric mystical or spiritual side\nwhere i also had\nexperiences that were you know\nfar beyond mindfulness um\nand then i sort of start i started med\nschool at the age of 27\nand then it took me about four years to\nsort of get into med school and i think\na big thing that\nwe hear a lot from from this community\nis that like people feel like they're\nbehind\nyou know they're like 23 they're 24\nmaybe they dropped out of college\nmaybe they you know finished college and\nweren't able to get a job and\nand i've been trying to explain to them\nand i think your story is\na wonderful example of of in my mind\nkarma\nkarma yeah that it's such an interesting\nconfluence of events you know it's like\nit's so interesting how your\nyour your life what i'm hearing is like\na lot of threads that kind of get woven\ntogether you went to some you grew up in\nin outside of chicago went to a school\nin florida it sounds like yeah right so\nlike like you wind up at a school\nand you wind up with a guidance\ncounselor i for the life of me cannot\nimagine a single guidance counselor i\nhave ever met or ever heard of\nwhen someone when an 18 year old comes\ninto your office and says hey i'm having\nlike bad trips\nthey send you straight to like\nuniversity health services\nfor addictions no one says hey i have a\npre-manuscript copy\nfrom stan groff who's sort of the\neminent researcher on lsd\nand this is a book that's not going to\nbe published for years take it and read\nit\nlike the the the statistical\nunlikeliness of that confluence of\nevents\nis just such an outlier\nwell i'll say one yes very much so but\nthe college that i chose was an\nexperimental college\nthat had started in the 60s and it had\nbeen\ncreated by people who really wanted to\ndo an alternative to\ntraditional education interesting and so\nwhat they said was that the\nstudents curiosity is the most important\nthing\nand therefore nothing should stand in\nthe way of the students curiosity\nso they designed a school where\nthere was no grades it was all written\nevaluations\nheavy emphasis on independent study\nwith with professors you could create\nyour own classes you get a few of your\nfriends you say we want to study this\nand\nyou come up with a reading list or so\nyou talk to a professor you can get\ncredit for that\nyou had to do a contract for a semester\nand you passed or failed the whole\nsemester and you negotiate what's in the\ncontract\nit can be some classes some independent\nstudy some risk everybody had to do a\nsenior thesis\nas well now the honors college of the\nstate of florida\nbut the other thing that they did not\nthat i did not know\nwhen i um applied there um i\ni just was getting tired of being boxed\nin the\nrequirements this and that so the\nfreedom to explore my curiosity was\nreally attracted to me to that school um\nthey sent out stuff to people that did\nwell on the national merit scores and um\nand so i just got something in the mail\nfrom i've never heard about that but\nthe the two things that they did not put\nin the brochure\nthat i didn't notice when i visited the\ncampus with my father\num until i got there was that they had a\ntradition of all night dance parties\nwith psychedelics until the sun rise\nthe school the building was designed by\ni am pay\nthe famous architect and it had a\ncourtyard palm court in the middle of\nthe dorms\nthat imp had designed where the\nclassrooms were off that he'd also\ndesigned somewhere else\nand so we would have these uh all night\nparties with psychedelics\num and then in the morning um it would\ngo till sunrise\nkind of like prefiguring raves and\nthings like that and um\nbut there was also this sense of the\nindividual doing their own psychedelic\nexperiences you know that that was\nvalued so\nit was both therapeutic spiritual and uh\ncommunal recreational celebratory\nwith psychedelics so that was that's how\ndude\nyeah well it gets even more so um the\nswimming pool\num it didn't have a lot of facilities it\nkind of was a\na school for the imagination because\njohn ringling the ringling brothers\ncircus\nhad was wintering in sarasota that was\ntheir long\ntheir history there and so the john\nringling's house\nwhich is this massive beautiful big\nparty house now a state\nof florida museum was um right next to\nthe campus and his brother's house\ncharles ringling's house that was\ndonated to the campus to create the\nschool so\nwe we had this like party theme carnival\ntheme circus theme\nbut also there was a woman who actually\nhad studied with jung marion hopping was\nher name and she taught jungian\npsychology\nand her husband was um quite wealthy\nand they donated this olympic size\nswimming pool with a big deck around\nit big fences all around it and somehow\nor other it evolved into a nudist colony\nso i was a super shy guy in high school\ncould barely talk to girls\nand now here i am at in this nudist\ncolony with with all these\num you know naked men and women\nand it just felt like the underground\nenergies of sex and drugs\nwere sort of brought to the surface\nwhere we could\ntry to deal with them it felt like an\noasis of sanity in a crazy world\nand so it's not that unusual that there\nwould be a guidance counselor there that\nwould know about\nlsd research what i think is wild is\nthat you describe the nudist colony with\nall night psychedelic parties\nas the oasis of sanity in a crazy world\nyeah well it just felt that way that so\nmuch is repressed\nthat and when you repress stuff it comes\nout warped and distorted\nand when you bring that to the surface\nyou can work with it you can see\nit's just um yeah it did feel like this\noasis of sanity that\nthat we and the campus police their\njob was to protect us from the real\npolice\nfrom the city police and so\njust to give you an example again um\nthey had two lists of where people were\nwhen when parents would call or people\nwould come and say you know where\nwhere's\nthis uh where's my son or daughter you\nknow what room are they in\nso they had the list at the police the\ncop shop we called it they had the list\nof wherever\nthe rooms were that people were assigned\nto live in\nbut then they had another list of where\npeople were actually living\nyou know you could move in with your\ngirlfriend or you could do all these\ndifferent kind of things\non campus uh it was just astonishing so\nit it\nand and there was this general sense\nthat um\nyou know the young people are leading\nthe revolution we're doing this\npsychedelic stuff and\num you know the older people are you\nknow repressing and so\nit did feel like an oasis of sanity and\nand so i just\nwould not be who i am without that\nparticular\ncollege experience wow dude that's\nthat's\nwild man thank you so much for sharing\nthat\nyeah now i'd also i got a question for\nyou which is uh\nhow did you decide not to become a monk\nso you you go to meditate you're doing\nall these things\nwhat made you turn away from from that\npath\ni so in a sense i didn't turn away so\nwhat i real a couple of things one is i\nmet my wife and fell in love and was\nconflicted for a while\num and and so it's funny because i sort\nof talk about it like i met her at the\nend i actually so as soon as i tried to\nbecome a monk so when i was 21 years old\ni went to my teachers after one summer\nso\ni had a pretty amazing summer where i i\nstarted to practice some pretty\nintensive meditation\nand and what i loved about it is that i\ni had some spiritual experiences\nand so i was always sort of a curious\nkid was always a skeptical kid but\nwhen you have experiences of\nyou know con connectedness or\nother i mean it's hard to describe but\nyou start to\nexperience sensations and\nexperiences that are different from your\nday-to-day existence\nso a good example of this is like\nsometimes i'll ask people\nwhere their thoughts are localized in\nspace\nand i think if you really pay attention\nyou'll learn\nthat your thoughts are localized\nactually somewhere around the space of\nyour head\nbut we don't think about our thoughts as\nbeing around our head\nuntil you haven't like something like an\nout-of-body experience where your\nexistence is outside of your physical\nbeing\nand then once you step outside of your\nphysical being then you realize oh\nthere's actually like a layer on top so\ni had these kinds of experiences which\nwere really fascinating and i loved them\nbut really a lot of my deciding to\nbecome a monk so i went to my teachers\nand i said hey i want to take my vows\nand at the age of 21 i want to become a\nmonk\nand they said we're we're thrilled that\nyou want to do this fantastic\ngo finish your education go get a\ndoctoral degree\nand then if you're still interested at\nthe age of 30 we'll take you\nand and so i think they sort of\nrecognized that i was passionate and\nthat it was sort of\na decision that was made from the wrong\nplaces and what i realized is that my\ndecision to become a monk was actually\nout of like ego\ni'd failed at life i sucked at it i knew\ni was smart\ni was the son of two doctors and they\nhad everyone expected so much from me\nand i expected a lot for myself\nand so i found myself underperforming\ncompared to people who i was better than\nand that was really hard for me and so\nwhat i realized is that\ni'm going to devalue everything that i'm\nbad at\nand i'm going to become spiritual as\nopposed to materialistic\ni'm not going to care about going and\nbecoming a doctor and i'm going to rise\nabove all of that\ni'm going to be better and all that but\nreally it was like a very deep\nrooted spiritual ego which i think is\nvery present\nlike in a lot of spirituality there's so\nmuch underground ego\nlook at how spiritual i am and and it's\nreally bizarre\nand so i realized that i don't need to\nbecome a monk\nthat actually ultimately becoming a monk\nis not about wearing a particular thing\nor living in a particular\nplace it's all about the quality of your\ninternal experience\nand that being a monk is about attitude\nit's about paying attention to what's\nwithin whether you're doing external\nthings or not it's completely irrelevant\nand so you know i i think it was strange\nfor a while because i would do things\nlike sleep on the floor and stuff\nbecause i didn't care\nand then my my wife cares about nice\nthings so she would get nice things and\ni would learn to appreciate those and\nlike\nalso learn that like it doesn't matter\nwhether you sleep in a nice bed\nor on the floor and like you just like\nbeing a monk is entirely internal it's\nnothing on the outside\num and so ultimately that's why i\nrealized that it was\nit was kind of false and then\ni i was in love and i was conflicted and\nthen i realized actually that like\nthat was also a division that i didn't i\ncould i could love her and be with her\nand that\nthat was part of my karma and i could\nalso continue my internal spiritual\njourney\num which is what i've done so that's\nkind of how i decided\nwow now i i have a a monk story i'd like\nto\nshare it seems very appropriate now so\nthis is uh\none of the experiences that where i took\nmdma by myself\ncamping out in nature um this was now\nin um um 1985.\nand i had gotten to know a christian\nmonk brother david steinle ross\nand i i would encourage people to uh\ncheck him out\nhe's he's written one book was called\nthe gratitude is the heart of prayer\nthere's something from brother david\nsteinle ross on\nyoutube i think it's like a three-minute\nmeditation about gratitude like today\nit's a beautiful beautiful thing but he\nwas also\necumenical he was very much\neven though he was roman catholic he was\nvery mystical he wasn't\ndidn't see that in in only those ways\nand also i i met him\nin 1982 um when i went\nto uh when i first went back to college\nat age 28 but i started\nmy first semester was at esslin\ninstitute in big sur with stan\ngroff on a month-long workshop called\nthe mystical quest\nhe was one of the teachers that's where\ni also learned about mdma\nlater on in 83 and 84 i had given him\nmdma he expressed an interest in doing\nmdma\nin half doses in the monastery as a tool\nto aid meditation\nand he found that it was very helpful\nand when we\nsued the dea in 84 to try to keep mdma\nlegal as a medicine there started to be\nsome publicity\nand in the beginning of 85 newsweek did\nan\narticle uh the first major media article\non mdma and it quoted me but it also\nquoted brother david and he said that\nhe described his experience doing mdma\nas a tool for meditation and he said\nthat it\nproduced the same enlightened attitude\nthat uh hmong could spend 30 years\ntrying to meditate to achieve which is\nan incredible statement\nthe quietness that you can get so i i\ntook mdma one time um\nshortly after this article came out i\nwas camping out it was just this\nbeautiful\nbeautiful spot um right at the beaches\nuh at the edge of the pacific the\nmountains came down right behind me\num there was some boulders out in the\nocean so that um the high tide came\naround me but i was protected from the\nhigh tide\nthere was a freshwater stream right\nnearby and\nit was a safe protected spot that i knew\nreally well\nand so i decided that i would take mdma\nthere and i was not in a relationship at\nthe time\nand i was thinking i wonder why would\nsomebody want to be a monk\nyou know what what's the you know and\nwhy would somebody want to be celibate\nand and i also was wondering how do i do\nwhat i want to do\nand not get busted by the dea as well so\nunder the influence of mdma um you know\nit's not visual like lsd or psilocybin\nbut\nthere was a big tree there and i was\nsort of projecting images on the tree\nand the tree was like the dea looking at\nme\num and how do i stay safe and and i came\nup with this strategy basically which\nhas\nserved me well i think which is that the\ndea is always looking at what's under\nthe rock\nyou know what's hidden but a lot of\ntimes you just come straight at them\neven if you're criticizing them um\nironically that can be safe you know\nyou're just coming right at him\nso then i started thinking about um\nbrother david\nand why would somebody want to be\ncelebrate and why would somebody want to\nbe a monk and\ni was thinking about that for a while\nand then i just felt like the roaring of\nthe ocean the waves of the ocean\nthe ocean was so enormous and then the\nsky\nthe milky way and the sky was just\nincredible\nand it just felt like i was perched on\nthe edge of the world which i really\nwas in a sense and i started thinking i\nmight just\ndisappear you know what is keeping me\nhere i mean\nthe the universe is so vast um\nand and i felt like i was dissolving\ninto the universe and and there was that\nthat beautiful aspect of that but then\nafter a while\ni realized i'm still here you know\nwhat's keeping me here and\nthen i started thinking about gravity\nthat somehow or other\ni had this image of gravity\ni as the arms of a lover that that i was\ncradled in the arms of gravity\nand that that was keeping me together\nthat's what\nmade things adhere instead of just\ndissipate into everything\nand i i felt gravity as\nwarm as an embrace as an embrace of a\nlover\nand i thought aha this is what the monk\nand celibacy is about that you're\nsupposed to\nfeel that kind of love for the universe\nif you focus it on a\nspecific person maybe that makes it\nharder to\nto transfer it to the that same kind of\nwarmth to the\nto the universe and so one once i felt\nthat\ni after that experience i never have\nfelt as lonely as i have\nbefore because i feel like there's this\nlove woven into the universe\nbut then once i realized that i was\ncradled in the arms of gravity and that\nthis was kind of what the monastic life\nwas in part about i said great\nnow i don't have to be a monk yeah\nnow i can have a real lover as well as\nthe gravity as a lover\nnow 30 years after that i was at a\nconference\nand brother david was one of the\nspeakers and\nhe was uh sitting next to me at dinner i\npurposely went to sit next to him at\ndinner\nand we kept in touch over the years but\ni had never spoken to him about this\nexperience and and i said\nuh brother david i just want to share\nwith you this experience the most\nmystical experience really of my whole\nlife\nand you were connected to it and i'm\nwondering just what you might\nthink about it and so um i told him the\nstory and i told him about um\nyou know cradled in the arms of gravity\nand he just was silent for a very short\ntime\nand he said every day\ni think about gravity every day\ni think about gravity every day\nand he reaffirmed that sense that the\ngravity and this kind of is a force of\nlove\nso i i felt that it took 30 years for me\nto kind of get that affirmation from him\nthat that was\nthe case and and so um i i feel\nlike um that that was one of the pivotal\nexperiences of my life\nthat on the beach yeah thank you so much\nfor sharing rick this has been\namazing i think um i know you have to\nget going in about 15 minutes so\ni'm kind of curious i think i've got a\ncouple of questions or directions\none is uh well one thing i just want to\nreinforce this point so the first thing\nis like for people who feel like they're\nbehind i think rick\nyou're a wonderful example of like you\nknow don't\ncompare yourself to someone else's\njourney\nand even this last story that you told\nis like even\nyou know the the ending to this\nparticular experience\nhappens 30 years later yes exactly you\nknow\nand and so what i'm what i'm really\nhearing from you and what i want people\nto really take away is like what i've\nexperienced in my life which is that\nyou're not living anyone else's life\nyou're living your own\nso don't judge your life by what other\npeople are doing or things like that\nbecause\nit sounds like you started college at\nthe age of 28\nand then built up this organization\nwhere we're now you know i mean maps is\nreally an amazing organization yeah well\ni i started college at 17 and then\ndropped out at 18 for 10 years\nand then went back as a college freshman\nat age 28.\nyeah it's crazy um so so i just wanted\nto kind of\nwanted to do it any differently i mean\nit was really the right thing for me and\ni i think the lesson you're trying to\npull out of it is really right yeah is\nthat you're on your own timetable\nand you don't have to compare with you\nknow what's right for somebody else\nmight not be what's right for you\nand um you know the the other\nsort of aspect of this is um and and\ni'm not quite sure where you were and\nyour wife are with children but\num you know my wife and i we've had\nthree children but they've all\nuh two of them are on their own one of\nthem is still in college\num but when you have little kids you\nend up um you know it just seems like\nit's going to go on forever\nlooking forward you know it's like it's\nnever going to change you're always\ngoing to\nhave your kids at home but when they're\ngone and you look back\nit's like a heartbeat where did those uh\n18 20 years go\nyeah so what i want to say from that is\nthat to have a 20-year plan or a 30-year\nplan\nis not really that long you know before\nyou know it the future will have arrived\nso also chart your own way don't feel\nthat you're behind others but also you\ncan have a very long-term plan\nuh and i think a lot of people don't do\nthat and and then you don't plant the\nseeds\nthat can later blossom all these years\nlater\nyeah so that's the mistake people make\nis oh you know i've got to think in more\nshort-term chunks\nrick you may not understand what i'm\nabout to say but i think it's\nillustrative so\nwhat i'm hearing from you is that you're\na late-game carry\nyeah and and so i don't know exactly how\nyou mean that but\nthe yeah late bloomer is sort of how i\nsee myself yeah\nyeah right so i i love the way that you\nkind of think about it i think the\nproblem is that everyone wants to be\nlike early game focused and they don't\nrecognize that you can sow all these\nseeds and these\nyou know nudist colony all night parties\nare soda foundation\nalong with you know an incredible work\nethic and parents who\nsort of acknowledge that you're probably\nwrong but still held enough faith\nand enough humility to kind of give you\na chance and then\nalso that i i sort of see the forces of\nkarma kind of supporting you it's not\nquite as active as i'm making it sound\nbut well i would say so\ni'll just share that i had a dream this\nis what i think is my karma\nthe dream was many people have seen um\n2001\nspace odyssey the movie by stanley\nkubrick and near the end of the movie\nthere's the scene where the astronaut is\nin an all-white room he's on his\ndeathbed\nthis is right before the sort of birth\nof the star child so in the dream\nand this is in my middle 20s so this is\nafter i decided to focus my life on\npsychedelics but\num i remember this dream like like it\nwas just last night\num so there's a person on a death bed\nthe room is all white and the the fella\ntells me a story the story is that\nhe was miraculously\nsafe he almost was killed but he was\nmiraculously saved and he knew he was\nsaved for a purpose but he didn't know\nwhat the purpose was\nand then he says to me let me show you\nhow i almost died\nand it turned out that the scene now all\nof a sudden we're out of this all-white\nroom we're at the edge of town it's\nsomewhere\nrussia poland something like that\nthere's thousands of jews that are lined\nup\nin front of this big mass grave bunch of\ngermans they machine gun them all\nthey're pushed into this mass grave they\nthrow some dirt over it\nand this guy is wounded but not killed\nand then it sort of switched a little\nbit into like a jesus story where he was\nburied for three days and then he was\nresurrected sort of so he sort of climbs\nhis\nand i'm with him in the dirt underground\nseeing this whole thing and then he kind\nof comes to\nand he claws his way up and um he gets\nend up somehow earlier he knew where the\nup was and\nhe gets onto the uh the dirt out of\nthat and there's nobody there it was at\nthe edge of town he runs into the woods\nhe works with the partisans\nuh till the end of the war and then then\nhe said that's how i was almost safe so\nnow we're back in the all-white room\nhe's on his deathbed and he said now\ni know what my purpose was i know why i\nwas\nsaved from that i know what my purpose\nis and i'm like oh\nwhat did you learn he said my purpose is\nto tell you to study psychedelics\nand that that's going to be the sense of\nmystical connection\nis going to be the antidote to genocide\nand in my head i'm thinking\noh okay i've already decided that this\nis a heavy thing\nyou're trying to lay on me you know that\nthat you want to pass this thing on so\nyou can die in peace\nand in my mind i'm saying okay i already\ndid decide that so\num i will accept that i said okay you\ncan lay that on me i will do that\nand and then he died um and then i walk\nout of this white room\ni watched him die i walk out of the\nright room and all of a sudden i'm in\nthe middle of a forest\nand then i i i go down there's a little\nstream and so i'm sitting in front of\nthe stream i dread a lot of hermann\nhesse and\nthis siddhartha and so i'm like watching\nthe stream go by\nand and all of a sudden i realized\nthere's a young boy\nsitting next to me and about 10 years\nold or so\nand then i realized i know this boy um\ni i know his father and his father is a\nfriend of mine\nand at the time i had a large stash of\nlsd\nthat i was scared of getting busted so i\nhad asked his father if he would store\nmy lsd stash at his house in his freezer\nand his father had said yes so once i\nconnected this little boy in the dream\nto lsd\nthen it all made sense then i woke up so\ni feel that the karma for me is this\nall these people that died because they\nwere dehumanized because\npeople were motivated by fears and\nanxieties that\none of the many strategies that can be\nhelpful for that is this kind of\nhelping people understand how we're all\nconnected and helping people work\nthrough their own fears and anxiety so\nthat they're not so easily manipulated\nby\nby them yeah so uh rick that's a great\nsegue i think to an important question\nis that\nwe get a lot of people in our community\nwho are wondering okay so they've heard\nyour amazing story\nright and i think a lot of people um you\nknow feel\ndirectionless feel a little bit broken\nhave insecurities and anxieties of their\nown\nand want to partake in what you're\ndescribing\nso and i struggle with this too it's\ninteresting i actually have a\na patient who has treatment refractory\ndepression\nwho i'm trying to figure out how can i\nhelp this person because i do think that\nit's not like a neurochemical imbalance\nor something i i really do think that\ntheir depression is more spiritual in\nnature\nso what do people do who are interested\nin this kind of healing\nbecause as a medical doctor you know i\ncertainly won't\nand and really can't recommend it right\nnow\num and and so but what do people do like\nso we do get questions about\nyou know i i want to like figure out\nwhat my purpose is\ni want to feel less insecure i want to\nheal\non a spiritual level what should what\nshould they do\nwell first off you can recommend\nketamine to people ketamine isn't a\nmedicine for um refactory depression\nsometimes it does help people have\nspiritual experiences\ni i think the first thing and we sort of\ntalked about this earlier\nis that what's legal and what's moral\nare two different things\nso everybody has to decide for\nthemselves\nto what extent are you going to respect\ncertain laws and to what extent\nare you not going to so you know\nthat's for each person to decide for\nthemselves what risks are you willing to\ntake\num one of the incredible things about\nstan that i think\nstan groff that was so remarkable is\nwhen psychedelics were criminalized\na lot of people who had been psycho\nresearch said okay\nit's taken out of our hands let's\nexplore meditation let's explore other\nthings\nand then some of even like we don't need\npsychedelics anymore you know there's\nother ways to get there which is true\nthere are other ways to get there but\nwhat stan did\nwas to see that that kind of\nnon-ordinary state of consciousness that\nwas produced by psychedelics was very\nvaluable\nand he developed an approach called the\nholotropic breath work which is\nhyperventilation\nwith support in groups to let these\ndeeper experiences come out so anybody\nlegally anywhere can look for\nholotropic breathwork practitioners and\nthere's quite a few hundreds that have\nbeen trained around the country\nand around the world even more that\npractice holotropic breath work or other\nkinds of therapies so people can go to\ntherapies\ni think that there there's um it's a\nvery small place but it's called peyote\nway church\nof god and you can go on an individual\nvision quest with peyote you know\nthey they're part of the native american\nchurch they've got a legal context for\nit\nyou know you know it's not that big but\nthey have it set up for people to take\nthey\nand wander off you know in a special\nplace where they're\ncamping you can also look for ayahuasca\nchurches\ncert in america there's quite a lot of\nayahuasca experiences that\nthat the two churches uned vegetable and\nsanto dami are legal\nbut um you know most of the ayahuasca\ncircles are not exactly in those kind of\nsettings but you could try those um but\ni i also think that\nthere are um a lot that can be done with\nclose friends\nyou know a lot of peer support so\nbecause you know at college we have this\nall night dance parties what maps is\ndoing\non the one hand it's mostly uh drug\ndevelopment\nmdma assisted psychotherapy for ptsd\nthrough the fda\nbut we also have what we call the zendo\nproject which is psychedelic harm\nreduction for people\nwho have difficult trips that take it\noutside of medical context how do we\nhelp them\nso we train all sorts of people in this\nso people could look at the maps.org\nwebsite\nand we have training materials about\nzendo how do you help somebody with\ndifficult trips we also have what's\ncalled the treatment manual\nfor our mdma assisted psychotherapy for\nptsd\nso you go to the research menu bar mdma\nnear the bottom of it it's called um\ntreatment manual that explains how our\ntherapeutic approach is done and you can\npractice it on your own with your\nfriends um\nsitting for you or or you can sit for\nyour friends i i think that\num it's difficult you know to find\nways to channel that interest at a time\nwhere we still are living under\nprohibition um you know denver has made\nthe mushrooms the lowest enforcement\npriority so now has\noakland so as ann arbor there's the\noregon psilocybin initiative that's\ngoing to be on the ballot\nso there are more opportunities for\npeople to go to certain\nareas and have these experience you can\ngo to the netherlands amsterdam for\nmushroom experiences there are\nall sorts of people that bring groups\nthere there's going to south america for\nayahuasca\npersonally i i prefer things in my own\ncultural context\num but you know some people really like\ngoing into these other contexts i think\nthat what you can do is\nstudy humanistic and transpersonal\npsychology\nuh transpersonal psychology is sort of\nbeyond the person trans it's what we\nshare in common and it does have a lot\nto do with these kind of spiritual\nmystical states but it also\nhas a lot to do with you know just\nregular psychodynamics and what's the\nroot of a lot of the problems\nand and i think that there are going to\nbe\nover the next um couple of years we're\nhoping now we anticipate\nthat if our research continues to go\nwell\nsometime in early 2023 we should have\nmdma assisted psychotherapy approved for\nptsd as a prescription drug\nthe people working with psilocybin are\nare thinking\nmaybe the end of 2023 2024 they'll have\npsilocybin approved\nwe'll be setting up all these\npsychedelic clinics and the therapists\nall want to be cross-trained they don't\nwant to be an mdma therapist or a\npsilocybin\ntherapist or a ketamine therapist they\nwant to be a therapist that knows all\nthese different\nmodalities that we're really trying to\nbring in a new\nfield of psychedelic psychotherapy where\nthe psychedelic psychotherapists have\nthe range of psychedelics available to\nthem and they customize the treatments\naccording to the individual\ni think people who are struggling now\num it's difficult one way to\nlook at it is clinicaltrials.gov\nif you go to clinicaltrials.gov\npharmaceutical companies sponsors have\nto list their studies there and you can\nput in drug and condition\nand you can see what studies are\navailable that you could maybe volunteer\nfor there are even studies some of them\nthat need healthy volunteers where you\ncan\nvolunteer and get psilocybin or mdma you\nknow as part of the control groups or\nsomething\ninteresting so i i think there's\nopportunities for people but but\nmany of them if they are involving\npsychedelics are going to be against the\nlaw\nand so that's really up to each\nindividual's moral compass\nyou know what what they feel about that\num but but also i would say to people\num don't give up hope you know that the\nthings are coming around\nthe things are changing and there will\nbe um increasing opportunities\nand the other big thing i'll say is\ndreams you know we tend to undervalue\ndreams\ndreams are incredible tools freud called\nthem the royal road to the unconscious\nyou know jung did all sorts of stuff\nabout his dreams um you know i just\ndescribed to you one of the most\nimportant dreams in my whole life that\nthat's really influenced me my sense of\nkarma what i've been passed on\nthrough my forebears in a sense so i i\nthink people\ncan spend a lot of time just focus on\nyour dreams and if you don't remember\nthem in the morning just\nhave a dream journal you write that down\nand um\neven if you write down i dreamt nothing\num you know over time you'll get\nbetter and better you'll remember more\nand that can be a powerful tool for you\nto work on psychodynamic issues\nyeah thank you so much for kind of\noffering that perspective i think um\nyou know just one or two thoughts that i\nkind of have one is that\ni think holotropic breath work is pretty\ninteresting i think it has a lot of\nroots\nactually in kundalini brown i am yeah\nyeah and so i actually sort of steer\nclear of holotropic breath work because\ni think sometimes it can have i think it\nneeds to be done with the right kind of\nsetting\num it can bring stuff to the surface the\nsame way that it's like delicate\nexperiences yep\nyeah and and so when i was studying\nkundalini yoga myself i mean it was done\nin isolation\nactually precisely for that reason so\nlike you're done it's done with a guru\nand like\nit's very intensive and and what my\nteachers told me is that it's kind of\nplaying with fire and it can be\npowerful and transformative and it can\nalso really\nkind of mess you up if you until you\nlearn how to integrate it\ni mean the interesting thing is in\neither case the experience is powerful\nit's really i\nreally like your emphasis on integration\nafterward it's it's when you kind of\ntalk it through or work it through with\na\nwith a guru um that really i think you\ncan\nreally change uh one other thought that\nthat i i kind of just want to share is\nthat\nyou know i had some realization i don't\nknow if this is entirely true of\npsychedelics but i think it's sort of\ntheoretically true that\nif you think about chemical substances\nthey don't really\nchange our brain really what they do is\nactivate it\nright so you look at any any compound\nand and\nwhat it serves as an activator like if\nyou think about marijuana they're\nendogenous cannabinoids they're\nendogenous opioids\num i don't know necessarily that what\nthey're what we would call endogenous\npsychedelic compounds but\nit's been my understanding and what my\nteachers have told me is that\nessentially\nyou know if you take if you use\nsomething like mdma like this\nthis monk that you mentioned sort of\nsaid that 30 years of dedication you can\nachieve that in one moment with with\nmdma and i think that that's true\ni think that the the interesting thing\nabout\nmeditation is that you know you sort of\nlearn how to cultivate a particular\nbranch\nof spiritual experience and my\nexperience\nor my understanding has been that in\npsychedelics you know different\ncompounds will lead to generally\nspeaking different kinds of experiences\nbut when you take a substance you don't\nreally know what you're signing up for\num exactly well stan groff has talked\nabout lsd\nas a non-specific amplifier of the\nunconscious\nyeah which means that you don't know\nwhat's going to come up and\nyour conscious mind can't predict it you\ncould even have a list of\nall the things that you want to deal\nwith during this session and what\nemerges may be completely different yeah\nthat's interesting\nyeah so i know you've got to run well i\ndo have a bit more time if\nso i i think you know another 10 15\nminutes uh\ni mean i i think rick though the richest\nthe best part of this i think has been\nyour stories bro\nlike i think i think hearing your\nstories has been has been eye-opening\nman\nit's such an interesting background and\nit's so interesting because i\nyou know i had envisioned you as as you\nknow this this phd who had\ndone research and and just to hear a\nlittle bit about your life has been\namazing\num okay well i have two another story i\nthink that yeah\nmaybe so this comes up with maps of\nstrategy so this is where i really\num so this is a story of two days one\nday where i did dmt the next day\nketamine and so again back in 1985\nso this is you know 35 years ago but but\nreally maps his strategy evolved from\nthat from\nin a sense from those experiences and\nwhat i mean by our strategy is\non the one hand is drug development on\nthe other hand is drug policy reform and\ntrying to\nwork on what's called mass mental health\nthat\nwe want to help people that are\nsuffering first that's the doorway into\na frightened culture that's been\nscared about psychedelics that has a lot\nof misinformation\nthat that is um the opening uh wedge you\ncould say medicalizing\nbut that we all need this kind of\nmission purpose uh meaning\num and healing and growth even if we\ndon't have a clinical diagnosis\nso masses had this parallel strategy and\nso\nwhere that sort of came um\nfrom was these two experiences um\nalso took place at esslin and this was\nwith the groups of people that were\ngathering to try to figure out how to\nprotect the use of mdma\nas a therapeutic drug so\none day we did dmt this was with terence\nmckenna ralph metzner a bunch of other\npeople that were very um experienced i\nhad never done dmt and and so the way we\ndid it was\nthere was about eight of us sitting in a\nroom and one person would would smoke\nthe dmt\nit takes around 10 minutes you just lie\nback and you have this experience and\nthen you come back\nand you share a little bit with the\nother people about what happened so this\nis the integration part\nand then you pass the pipe to the next\nperson and then they do it and then each\nperson in sequence will have this\num dmt experience\nand so for me the the dmt which i'd\nnever taken before\num it's very powerful now it's the main\nactive ingredient in ayahuasca\nbut when you take it in oral form it\ncomes on slower\nit lasts longer when you smoke it it's\nabout a 10 minute experience and so\nthe the first thing that i experienced\nwas just uh\nyou smoke it you sort of fall back\ni just felt there there's a line there\nwas just like a horizontal line\nand then there was a vertical line and\nthen it turned red it was a color and\nthen it started assembling in\ncubes so it became kind of um\nthree-dimensional\nand and then it rapidly turned into like\nan m.c escher kind of drawing where the\nthe dimensions didn't quite work and\nthen i was blasted into\nsort of the universe and all of that is\nlike fraction of a second\nbut you know this was the progression of\nit and so then i\ni felt like i was part of creation part\nof this uh big bang and\nand and at one point i had this thought\nwhich is amazing in a way that you can\nstill be thinking\num even though your normal orientation\nis not there\nthat in the most inner parts of myself\num and and you talked about this about\nwhere are your thoughts located you know\nand you're saying it's around here but i\nthought inside\nmy my head where i i talk to myself\nwhere i think\ni'm using words and i didn't invent\nthese words\nyou know in the most private part of me\nit's\nfrom millions of people that have\ndeveloped the english language that have\ndeveloped\nlanguage that all of this might so the\npart that i think is the most private in\na way is not\nactually the most private it's it's\nintimately connected with everything\nthat's come before and so i felt like\nmore and more it's just this beautiful\nthought of this whole long stream of\nevolution i'm part of everything and\nand it just just felt great but then i\nhad this thought\nwhich you know i've learned not to\ndisregard these thoughts but the thought\ni had was if you're part of everything\nand everything's part of you then hitler\nis part of you too\nit's not hitler out there i'm all good\nthat bad is out there the\nthe the hitler is part of me too i have\nto own that\nand that was just such a shattering\nthought\nthat um\nit just really brought me down and i i\nfelt like there's a logic to it i\ni can't deny it um this inner hitler\nand so it just depressed me\nyou could say and and the whole rest of\nthe day you know we went through i told\nmy story we went through the rest of the\nother people's stories uh\nbut the whole rest of the day i was just\nreally wrestling with this thought that\num that there's this touch point where\npart of me is hitler too that i can't\nreally disown that\num it was very kind of a somber day so\nthe the next evening we decided that we\nwould do ketamine\nand this was intramuscular a hundred\nmilligrams ketamine intramuscular this\nlasts\ndifferently it lasts about an hour so we\ndidn't we all did it more simultaneously\nwe\nwe didn't want to you know one person\nsit there while they would go out for an\nhour and come back\nall right so during this experience of\nketamine\num somehow or other i was\ninto a different space i was um\nabove and behind hitler as he was giving\na\nspeech to a a mass rally\nand i'm thinking okay hitler's part of\nme i'm potter hitler how do i get inside\nthis part of my head or how do i get\ninside his head to\nsee about healing this murderous um\nnature of what he's doing how do i\nyou know do this and and so that got me\nreally scared like i have to psych this\nguy out i have to figure out what's\ngoing on\nand um and the more that i saw him do\nthese uh speeches\nthis particular speech um and\nand then i got this sense a whole\ndifferent sense i'd never thought of\nabout the heil hitler salute the way it\nwas heil hitler and then everybody would\ndo it back to him\num and it it felt like this power from\nthe one to the many\nso that he was doing the salute and then\nthey would all do it back to him\nso it's like push out this energy and\nthen they would all give their energy\nback to him\nand then he would do it again and then\nthey would do it again and it felt like\nthis vibration that was getting stronger\nand stronger that was increasing this\nkind of\num connection between um you know him\nthey're all giving his power to him and\nand i started thinking this is this is\nterrifying i'm i i\nand i i felt like i might freak out and\ni had this image then of bubbles that\nwere like air bubbles that were coming\nto the surface but these were fear\nbubbles\nand if these fear bubbles broke the\nsurface then then i would panic and i\nwouldn't be able to really deal with it\nand the the one of the good things about\nketamine is that it doesn't interfere\nwith your respiration\nthat's why it's such a good anesthetic\ndrug so i had the thought breathe\nbreathe if you just breathe\nmaybe you'll be able to not panic so\nmuch so i was able to breathe\nand i didn't panic and then i got this\nthought that there is no way\nto get inside of hitler's head he's\ngetting so much out of it\nyou know that p the same way for\npsychedelic therapy is that people have\nto be willing\nto face things that they're the ones\nthat are doing the healing\nthey're the ones that are doing the hard\nwork you try to create a safe and\nsupportive setting and you prepare them\nbut in the end the therapist is not the\nthe magician that's making everything\nhappen it's the person\nhealing themselves and they have to be\nwilling and so i realized\nthat he wasn't willing\nthere was no way that i i from the\noutside you know he ended up committing\nsuicide\nnot having any kind of change even after\nall of germany was\nyou know destroyed and so many people\nwere died\num so i realized though that the\nlong-term strategy\nhas to be all of those people that were\ngiving away\ntheir power to hitler they get a lot\nless out of it\nso that that's why we need mass mental\nhealth\nthat the strategy for for maps the\nstrategy that i'm trying to put\nforward is how do we help all these\npeople who are giving away their power\nto dictators or authoritarians or\nyou know um we see this a lot in america\ntoo people that are giving away their\nrationality and their power\nwe have to it's it's going to be easier\nto help each one of them\nwork through their traumas and fears so\nthat they don't give away their power so\nironically rather than changing one\nperson\nit's changing 50 million people or more\nand so that's where maps of strategy has\nbeen that the medicalization\nis a tool for\na larger change in consciousness\nthat can only come from embedding this\nkind of\nnew awareness in millions and billions\nof people\nwhich then need drug policy reform as\nwell as\ndrug development so most of the um\nnon-profit or for-profit psychedelic\ncompanies\nare about um drug development they're\nabout\ntraining other therapists treating\npeople and doing research\nand so the difference between maps and\nthem is that we are really\nabout mass mental health\nand going beyond just working with\npeople that have a diagnosis to try to\nspiritualize\nhumanity as a whole yeah that's that's\ngreat you know it's funny so someone\na couple months ago mentioned that what\nwe do at healthy gamer\nis something called aoe healing and\naoe means area of effect and so the\nimplication is it's actually i think it\naligns perfectly with mass\nmental health so i mean a big part of\nour mission and\nwhat we do is is exactly what you\ndescribed it's sort of the idea that\nyou know we think that we can try to\nunderstand ourselves better as\nindividuals\nand the reason that we have these\ninterviews is so that one person can\nshare their experience\nright and then that your experience goes\nout and affects a ton of people\nand then those people create changes in\ntheir life without\nwhich i think definitely does feed back\nto you or at least to me\num we had a pretty traumatic uh suicide\nin our community a couple of months ago\nand you know i think it was hard on me\nbut i i think it was\nreally interesting to feel everyone's\nenergy and support and\nand how at the end of the day it's like\nwe're all on the same team\nand you know we have to support each\nother and and i'm with you a hundred\npercent about sort of\nyou know fixing each individual person\nkind of one at a time\nbut that's how you create a mass you you\nsort of i mean\nit's a beautiful way to put it i think\nit's it aligns perfectly with\nwhat we've evolved into because that's\nwhat healthy gamer has become it's been\nbecome a community of somewhere between\n30 and 250 000 people depending on which\nmetric you use\num and you know we really try to support\neach other and we we try to work on\nourselves\nand we work on ourselves together even\nthe way that you kind of described the\ndmt process like we have a you know a\ncommunity like our discord server where\npeople come and sort of share their\nindividual take on things\num and then we kind of go around and\npeople will share their own take on a\nparticular subject\nwe had like this particular channel that\nwas devoted to ego so people come in and\nthey talk about okay\nwhat's my ego telling me to do how do i\nunderstand my ego how does my ego\ninterfere with things\nand one of the things that i love about\nhearing these communities and\nin our groups is that it's really hard\nto see\nyour problems in you because of\ncognitive bias\nit's way easier to see your problem in\nsomeone else\nand you can learn so much when somebody\nelse is talking about the same thing\nthat you can\nthat you struggle with and you're like\noh wow that's exactly what i do\nand it's so much clearer when you're\nkind of working together with a group of\npeople and when you kind of integrate\ndifferent people's perspectives\nyou can learn so much more so it's\namazing and and i want to say one thing\nabout ego too which is\na couple times i've used the word ego\ndeath but i've mostly used ego\ndissolution\nbut um i think ego death gives people\nthe very wrong impression\num and so we need our ego we just need\nour ego to be in the proper\nplace so the metaphor is that um\nwell stan sanderoff has said that the\npsychedelics are the study of the mind\nwhat the microscope is the biology and\nthe telescope is to astronomy\nand so you know at times the telescope\nhas produced\nknowledge that was very dangerous and\nthis was for the\nstatus quo so this was in the time of\ncopernicus galileo and all\nand so what we thought at the time or\nwhat people thought at the time\nthat the earth was the center of the\nuniverse and that everything revolved\naround that\nand as it turned out that's not the case\num\nthat um we revolve the earth revolves\naround the sun the sun is just the minor\npart of this galaxy there's\nbillions of galaxies and i think the\nsame thing is true of the\nthe ego is that we think everything\nrevolves around us but that\nactually there's the bigger self the\nbigger world and so we need to put the\nego in its place\nuh but we we need to pay attention to\nour own ego we are\nbounded by life and death we are\nindividuals to be egoists\nto not pay attention to that is also not\npaying attention to a\na key part of reality which is that we\nare real\nhuman beings and we have uh to take care\nof ourselves and to take care of each\nother so\nwhat stan has also said is that the ego\nbecomes transparent to the transcendent\nit's like cleaning the window but the\nwindow doesn't go away the window\nprotects from\nvarious things so i i just think that um\nyou could get very punitive in this idea\nthat i got to have no ego\nyeah that's really important that that's\nwhere i think you get that spiritual ego\nthat you see a lot in spiritual circles\nthe ego of having no ego\nlook at how egoless i am yeah\nand and so i i'm with you and i think\nsort of there there's so much that i\ncould kind of relate to what you said\nin in sanskrit and sort of yogic\ntraditions um\nyou know and i'll just leave you with\ntwo or three like i think the most\nrelevant things the first is that\nyou know the yogis also say ego is a\nfunction of mind just like emotions or\nintellect it's just about who's in\ncontrol\nis the ego in control of you or are you\nin control of the ego\nthe second thing that i i kind of it's\nit's interesting so there's there are\nfour\num mahavakyas which are like great\nphrases\nand i think these are sort of the\nessence of what a lot of yogis\nunderstood\nand one of them is aham brahmasmi which\nmeans i am the universe\nand and i think this is very poorly\nunderstood because i think people sort\nof assume that this is kind of like a\nyoga calendar sort of concept it's like\ni am like you know we're all connected\nlike it's not an intellectual or a\nphysical philosophical concept\naham brahmasmi is the experience that\nyou are hitler and hitler is you\nand that that like is is terrifying\nas that is that essentially there is\nsome kind of\nunderlying unity which carl jung talks\nabout\nwhich you know people who have\npsychedelic experiences talk about and\nthe yogis talk about\nwhich is that the self and the other\nthat there is atman which is individual\nsoul and paramatman which is universal\nsoul\nand that essentially like there's one\nocean and you can pull a drop\nout and is the drop no longer the ocean\nis it a separate thing what happens to\nthe drop as it goes back into the ocean\nyou know and and so like a humbra masmi\nis like the main thing that\nwhen i sort of do meditative practices\non the hum brahmasmi i think i have\nexperiences somewhat like what you\ndescribe\num but it's interesting that there's so\nmuch overlap between like eastern\nmysticism and a lot of what you're\ndescribing\nyeah i i guess i'd like to go back just\nfor a second and then i do have to go\num which is to the the the sadness that\nyou said about the person that committed\nsuicide that was part of the community\nand this isn't just about that person\nbut\nbut i think a lot of times what happens\nis people lose the connection to the\nwhole\nthey feel so isolated and alone\nthat life is unbearable but but they\nthey have somehow\nlost that touch with the the bigger\nlike uh you know cradled in the arms of\ngravity or that kind of\nlove that permeates the universe or even\nbeing part of something bigger\nthat that that i think that experience\ncan help\npeople um as an antidote to suicide\nyeah that's been my experience that a\nlot of people who feel suicidal\nultimately what they feel the most\nprofoundly is alone\nyes isolated and um\nit's a it's interesting as a mental\nhealth provider to to see\nwhat works for suicide and what doesn't\nand\ni mean i think that's a conversation\nmaybe for a different day but\nrick i know you got to get going thank\nyou so much for coming\nthank you for having me it's been a\nwonderful discussion yeah thanks a lot i\ni did not know that you wanted to be a\nmonk yeah\nand so it's it's interesting um\nthanks to wise monks and your wife that\nuh talked you out of it\nwell take care rick and and best of luck\nwith everything and thank you so much\nfor all the work that you're doing and\nall the wonderful work that maps is\ndoing\nif people want to participate just learn\nmore maps.org\nyeah perfect we'll we'll send that out\ntake care bye\nyou"
