    "transcript": "so i want to talk to you guys a little\nbit about\nvalue today so sometimes we have these\nexperiences in life that like hurt\nand they can make us feel less like\npeople like they're even dehumanizing\nand\nyou know we look around and we see like\nother people being treated with value\nand sometimes we don't get treated with\nvalue\nand that hurts so much that like our\nmind has to come up with a reason\nwhy that person is treating me that way\nbecause the idea that this\nthat i'm just like i'm not worth it is\nso\npainful in and of itself and that i have\nto rationalize\nor justify or excuse that person's\nbehavior\nbecause if we can excuse someone else's\nbehavior\nthen it's not that we don't lack value\nthey're not actually treating us\nappropriately\nthere's a reason they're treating us\nthat way so it's like okay for\nthem to do that to us and it's bizarre\nbecause\nin that moment by giving the other\nperson an excuse you're protecting your\nown sense of value\nbut then what happens is that becomes\nmaladaptive very very quickly\nand then what happens is like we start\ngiving people excuses\nfor mistreating us because when we give\nthem an excuse then it's not our fault\nto like\nyou know we're oh i'm not actually a bad\nperson this person was just raised in\nsuch a way and like that's just\nyou know has nothing to do with me it\nhas everything to do with them\nand so we start to create these\nsolutions where we protect ourselves\nfrom what they do to us by giving them\nan excuse\nand that's actually what screws us\nbecause then suddenly\nno one is doing anything wrong and at\nthe end of the day you're still getting\nhurt\nand if you're getting hurt and no one's\nto blame then like what do you do with\nthat\nand that's when you end up like stuck\ninterpersonally with other people\nthat's where you end up with like\ntrusted views and all these other like\nweird manifestations\nare propagating unhealthy relationships\nbecause you're not willing to hold the\nresponsible parties responsible\nand so when you give them that excuse\nyou take away from yourself the capacity\nto forgive\nyou take away from yourself the capacity\nto move on\nbecause remember if they didn't do\nanything wrong then what is there to\nforgive\nand so you're kind of stuck in this\nlimbo where there's pain\nthat you kind of defend against but you\nhold no one responsible\nand therefore you can't forgive because\nthey didn't do anything wrong and then\nyou're kind of stuck\nand you end up in this weird like limbo\nwhere like it just feels weird like\nrelationships feel\noff to you and this especially happens\nwith people in your life\nthat you love because the more you love\nthem\nthe harder it is to accept that they did\nsomething hurtful to you\nbecause that hurts way more so the more\nyou love them\nthe more you make excuses for them the\nmore you make excuses for them the more\nit isn't their fault\nand the more it isn't their fault\nthere's no need to forgive everyone's\nhunky-dory everything's great\nno need for forgiveness i can hang out\nwith him tomorrow\neverything's great except they did do\nthat thing to you\nand it did hurt and it does hurt another\nweek goes by\nthey do it again another excuse no\nforgiveness\nno responsibility no need for change and\nthen your heart builds up a little bit\nbut no no no no i'm gonna be\ncompassionate\ni'm gonna be a nice person it's not\ntheir fault they were raised by really\nabusive parents so it's okay if they hit\nme\nthat's just the way they were raised and\nso it's devastating\nit's difficult because like part of the\nreason you're stuck is because you can't\nforgive\nand part of the reason people ask me how\ndo i move past stuff\nhow do i let go you have to like forgive\nright you have to accept you have to\nforgive\nbut you can't do that as long as you\ndeny there's a problem\nand the reason that you deny there's a\nproblem is because it hurts to admit\nthat there is a problem\nand so in a bizarre way if you want to\nstart moving forward i know this sounds\nbizarre\nbecause people are going to tell you\nthat like blaming is what gets people\nstuck\nbut especially with those you love start\nwith blame\nstart by holding people responsible for\nwhat they're doing\nstart by holding yourself responsible\nfor what you do and then comes the hard\npart right because we're really good at\nholding ourselves responsible and\nbeating ourselves up\ni'm gonna do better tomorrow i'm gonna\nwork harder tomorrow\nnext time it's gonna be different and\nthen you beat yourself up so when it\ncomes to yourself\nyou need to do the second piece which is\nforgive\nso assign responsibility accept it\nforgive and that's when you can be free\nthat's when your relationship can get\nbetter that's when you can start to move\nforward\nbut you have to start by calling it what\nit is\nif someone mistreats you call them out\non it\nif you love them anyway you can say hey\nlike i care about you\nbut like what you did wasn't good\nand it hurt and when it comes to\nyourself\nif you blame yourself way too much learn\nhow to forgive\nlike yeah you did screw up but that's\nokay because no one's perfect\nand you're gonna do your best next time\nand that you are in your own corner\nthat you're willing to give yourself\nanother shot so be careful because\nthe things that we do to protect\nourselves from hurt\nare the things that sign us up for more\nhurt down the road\nand you have to understand what you're\ndoing to yourself\nand once you begin to understand what\nyou're doing to yourself you can start\nto change it try to change it do your\nbest\njust like today right if we look at\naaron like what he did wonderfully was\nlike at that very\nlast point i don't know how to say this\nbut you know we talked about it for a\nwhile\nand then he didn't get to it until we\npointed out\nwhat he does to protect himself and if\nyou guys are trying to\nclean the hurt you have to take off the\nshell first\nand then you can get out in there and\nclean it up so be careful about the\nthings that you tell yourself to protect\nyourself from being hurt\nand try not telling yourself those\nthings let yourself feel that hurt let\nthe consequences flow\nsit with them and then you can move\nforward"
