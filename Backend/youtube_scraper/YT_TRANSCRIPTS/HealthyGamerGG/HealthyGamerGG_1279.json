youtube and then\nyou went live\nan hour later talking about it just your\nthe words you speak\njust hits hard you start talking about\nget up and fight\nbecause i've been living anxiety and\ndepression for like for the past three\nyears so when you start talking like if\nyou've got problems get up\nget asked for help oh oh you spoke to me\nthat's when i started streaming properly\nin uh july\nso yeah just want to say never change\nkeep doing what you're doing\ni say it's all the time you're one of\nthe streamers out there that actually\nare here to help\nyour viewers and that's so rare so uh\nwell done\nfun thanks thank you um i'm glad it was\nhelpful you know it was i think it was\npainful for all of us\nright but sometimes pain can bring us\ncloser together and\nit's kind of bittersweet but can help us\nmove forward\nright and so what that you said you've\nbeen struggling with depression and\nanxiety for three years\nmostly anxiety for the past three years\nyeah oh my god so\nuh yeah yeah yeah well shall i give you\nthe short\nstory sure okay so pretty much\nand my viewers hate hearing this because\ni'm like a broken record i i try not\ntalk about ever\nuh but about i i've been streaming on\nand off for seven years\nback in 2015 i st my partner\num we split up and i streamed every day\nin 2015 in 2016 in april of 2016\ni got permanently banned on twitch\nbecause i used to get like 10\n000 viewers but i used i was a horrible\nperson\nright i used to just be so toxic and i\nuh\ni got myself permanently banned by abide\nby just slandering someone's name\nright i got permanently banned the day\nthat happened\noh i i was scared to talk to about\nanything to anyone i become this i just\nbecome\nso scared to even speak and i've just\nkind of\nit took me years i've just got over it\ni've just got over it now i'm like\ni just don't give a [ __ ] anymore i\nshouldn't swear sorry but i just don't\ncare anymore just talk\nsay and i feel ten times better and uh\nso yeah anxiety\nyou know but i was just so scared to\ntalk like on twitch i was scared to say\nanything i was scared to swear i was so\nscared to even do anything but\ni'm over it now and life's great life's\nperfect i'm just a bit annoyed with\ntoday\nbecause my daughter i was meant to\nstream today and i i have a daughter\nright\nand she was meant to go to school but\nher temperature was 38 so the school\nwouldn't allow her in because of this\ncoronavirus\nso i couldn't stream today and um i'm a\nbit my friend's here now looking after\nher she's fine\nnow she's fine oh here oh great here she\nis hello hiya\nhi uh yes yes what do you want yes yes\nyou're gonna go next door\nshe's four five three nearly 33.\noh i tell you what she can't speak so if\nyou want to\ncome over to my house in real life and\ngive some lessons that would be great\nwe're getting all the help she can trust\nme she's got all the help she can get\nshe just can't speak interesting\nyeah you know it's a funny thing um\nsometimes kids that are super super\nsmart actually don't\nthey learn to speak slower because they\nactually can communicate without\nspeaking\nright they're sort of like\nyou know it's interesting yeah i'm with\nyou that's what they say they said she\nkeeps\nall the information to herself she's not\nexpressing herself\nso um but yeah we're really close and um\nwith me and a mum we split up half a\nyear ago and we got a 50 50.\nso i take it for one week then a month\ntakes for one week i'll have it for one\nweek\nmonth you got me yeah that's it yeah\nsounds like she has she's having fun\nwith daddy at home well actually she's\naddicted to this pad\nand i can't get her off it but is it a\nbad thing this\nis these pads for kids are the you know\nthe ipads is it a bad thing\nso i think the the trickiest thing is\nactually though\nwhether it's long form or short form\ncontent\nso generally speaking uh we want to be\ncareful with kids that\ncan like essentially switch things very\nquickly or things that have commercials\nor like short video clips because that\nsort of\nreinforces a short attention span\nwhereas electronics that are more long\nform like if you if they watch like a\nwhole\nepisode of something um that's actually\ni think\nbetter for their attention than you know\nthings that are sort of like pop-ups and\nlike\nall of you so as long as it's a long\nform i think it's\nit's okay but the short answer right\nyeah yeah i was gonna make sure she\ndon't tell my pc she always goes to my\npc and turns it off sometimes yeah\ni know what you mean oh shaw's a biscuit\ni'm listening doctor\nyeah that's fine take take care of your\nkid man what's her name\nif you don't mind me asking it's ellie\nand what's your name\nali your name is ally yeah well my dad's\nturkish\nall right so it's meant to be pronounced\nali but\ni can't speak turkish doc okay and i\nwon't lie to you i'm pretty nervous but\nas the interview goes on i'll calm down\nmy nerves are really\nhigh but i'm coming down but yeah her\nname's ellie and a lot of people\nthink it's cringe but i named her after\nthat gel win the last of us\nyou know ellie because i first played\nthe lot i haven't played it but i\ni need to oh dark yeah you should um\nyeah when i first played that game i was\nlike oh if i have a kid a girl\ni want to be like ellie and the last of\nus so yeah\nthat's it that's something like cringe\nbut honestly she's cute as hell\nyeah yeah she's she's amazing she looks\nbut you know this by the way like you\nknow the anxiety\nlike you do know that anxiety is\ndepression's best friend right if you\nguys\nif someone's got anxiety the pressure's\ngoing to be right next door to it you\nknow that right\nyeah great so yeah so it was only when\nmy partner left me half a year ago\nand i don't want to get like telling my\nlife story but she left me half a year\nago because pretty much we weren't going\nanywhere in the relationship\nright it when she left i pulled up my\nsocks\ni was like i'm gonna be a dad i'm gonna\nstart doing everything she does\nand i was like i'm gonna start streaming\nbecause i haven't streamed in three to\nfour years because i had this really\nthis cute\ntrolley community and they scared the\n[ __ ] out of me like they were\nmy community still to this day they\nscared me they say things to me they\nknow where i've been\ni'm convinced they i'm convinced these\nguys are tracking my car they got a\ndevice to track my car\nthey know everything about me they know\nwhere i've been which day i can't hide\nnothing\nright you're communicating yeah but i\nmean i'm not\nthe more you show them the more i show\nto where i'm scared the more they might\nmess around me now\nthey don't surprise me you know but it's\njust people in general they like to\nfreak me out and that\nwould normally give me anxiety but now i\njust kind of laugh with it that i i\nbrought\nlike a new car right like two months ago\na jaguar right and i was hiding the\nnumber plate i didn't want to know\nthe number plate because if you have\nsomeone's number plate you can find out\nthe details off the car\nhow comes i went on stream the next day\nand they're all spamming the number\nplate\nhow how do they know that doc you know\nso that's why\ni know man yeah people are the people\nare smart and i said to them all\nall the people my community they should\nwork for the fbi because\nthey're too smart you know but um but\nfor the\npast three years i've been scared of\nthem they would terrify me but now\ni just smile and i've got cctv\nand whatever you know it's one of them\nthings what what is scary about that\nwell they know my address right and um\ni'm pretty much i've been dark i've been\ntrolled so hard i've been trolled so\nhard\nno you couldn't even i you know yeah i\ncould yeah i couldn't even\nbegin it's you could i've had do you\nwant me to go into detail\ntrue okay i've had some okay so the\nfirst thing is unpaid food right so\nyou've got your address thing people\nwant to send you unpaid food\nthat's that's easy mode i've had i've\nhad i've had someone\non my door opening cracking the lock and\ni'm like what are you doing and they're\nlike oh we got a phone call\nthat you were locked in your bathroom so\nthey put locksmiths to my door i've had\npeople come to my door with snakes\nlike snakes snakes like oh you ordered\nsome snakes i'm like nah i did not order\nsnakes\ni've had sad things happen i've had\nchildren come with bags of toys\nbecause someone's placed an advert\nsaying i need toys\nso these poor children bringing bags of\ntoys to me\ni i won't lie to you the most people\nfind this funny but i've had hookers\nlegit hookers sent to my address and\nthey're all like with a pimp\ni've had that and it's been terrifying\nyou know and\nlike people like my reactions they find\nit hilarious and i you know\num i get stuff said to me all the time\nand wow i see the funny side but there\nare some bad sides to it but\nbut best thing to do is i don't i just\nkind of laugh it all now\nthe more that i get scared of it the\nmore that i'm gonna play on myself and\nget anxious and then depressed\nso i just kind of like take it i always\nhave my best friend he works for me now\nso he makes sure\nthe streams always go smooth so that's a\nnew thing we did you know that girl\nanita she's got a problem with some guys\nstalking her what you should do\nis should you get someone pay someone to\nmake sure that no one's gonna\nsecurity pay for security every time you\nget someone outside think about it right\num but yeah that matches the beginning i\ncould tell you a hundred things\nyou'd probably end up laughing but yeah\ni'm good now ali um\nwhat what did you want to was there\nsomething in particular that you wanted\nto focus on today i\ni'd love you know i'm happy to hear\nrandy i'm more than happy to be on you\ni'm more happy to talk to you and just\nget so i i was told\nso so you said that you got perm\nabandoned in 2016 so you started\nstreaming again are you streaming on a\ndifferent platform are you back on\ntwitch\nno i'm back on twitch they let me back\nin july of 2017.\nokay it was a year and a half won't lie\nto you\nbeing banned on twitch it's the worst\nthing in the world it's it's\nlike it's like a party you're not\ninvited to and no one wants to do\nbusiness with you no stream wants to\nknow you everyone will\nfollow you people to see it as bad\nbusiness and it was the worst year and a\nhalf\nof my life right i had often been on\nyoutube\nno one knows i wish people could just\nfeel the feeling of how i felt then\noh i wanted to kill myself i i legit got\num\nwhat's it called again when you get when\nyou're harmed yourself\nand you get restrained by the police in\nthe hospital where that you're a danger\nto yourself\nright what's the word for it ryan\nthere's a word for it\nyou know what's it called um section\nsection cisco\nsection the day i got banned on twitch\nyou know i made a video got millions\nlike two million views on youtube but i\ni legit was gonna go kill myself and\nthen i got took by the police there and\nthen\nand i was put into like uh a hospital\nbecause i was\ni was like yep i've got no point of\nliving and that was it and then it took\nthat year and a half i just spent money\ni didn't stream\ni i legit kind of streamed and i just\nspent my money and then after a year and\na half\ntwitch i i appealed i i i did i did\nchange\nbut i didn't have to change i just had\nto tone it down a bit so instead of\nch i changed too much i lost my fan base\ni lost them all i look because i went\nfrom crazy\nopen book character to this riddled\nanxious boring sheep of a guy\nand noah found me interesting twitch let\nme back but i lost to my fans\nit's only been recently where i'm on i'm\ni'm becoming the old me\nbut without the without the negative\nyeah yeah so it sounds like you found\nbalance\nyeah yeah you know starting to to be\nyour true self and be kind of\nentertaining and\nand fun to watch and at the same time\nnot overboard\nthat's right because back then i was a\nsmall streamer so i was doing anything\nto get attention but then i blew up and\nbecome a big streamer\nand the spotlight was on me and i was\nstill would say and do anything for\nattention so i was a very i would call\nall the shoutcasters names all the time\ni'm talking horrible names like the\nolder women are cool\nand i'm not proud of it like paul and\nstuff so why do you why do you think you\nwould do anything for attention\noh i i i already i i knew this was\ncoming\nbecause okay you've got to start asking\nme why i'm the biggest attention seeker\nin the world doc and i can explain why\ni've already\nasked myself these questions\nmy daughter is a mute right she can't\nspeak she don't talk right\ni was the exact same as a child i was so\nfrom the ages of\nzero to ten of primary school which is\nyour like\nyou americans call it different what do\nyou call primary school so from zero to\n10 elementary\nelements right your elementary school i\nhad no friends i was bullied\nmy mum was sleeping around with other\nguys and i didn't have my dad was never\nthere he still\nisn't really there he smokes a lot of\nmarijuana right\nso as a kid i had seven sisters no\nbrothers\nand my mom never knew how to interact\nwith me right because she only knew\ngirls\nright so when i was growing up i\ncouldn't talk to anyone when i went to\nschool we were moving from school to\nschool because my mom was trying to get\nwith a right guy\nright to provide and i had no friends\nin school and i was so quiet i got\npicked on i got picked on a lot\nright when i was 11 and i moved into the\nsecondary school which you would call\nhigh school\ni was so smart i thought to myself okay\nnew school no one knows me i'm just\ngoing to\npretend i'm this really loud guy because\nit that that's the guy i want to be so\nthat change i remember exactly where i\nwas i was on my bed\nthinking of the day before the school\nstarted i wanted to be this guy\nso secondary school started the first\nday and\nall these kids don't know me and were in\nclass and\nthe teacher was like okay guys i'm gonna\nteach and i was like\n[ __ ] you miss and everyone laughed and i\nlaughed and i was like huh\nthis is great this attention wow and the\nteacher get outside now\neveryone i felt amazed i was like yeah\nlike that feeling\nlike that and i love the attention and\nstill to this day\ni like the attention and it's like\nthat's why i you know i'll be honest\nwith you\ni say and do a lot of stuff for\nattention because i'm i'm trying to\ncatch up on the 10 years that i missed\nand that's it doc so that's not like\nthat\nyeah yeah so\ndo you think you're going to catch up oh\ngood question\noh god um i don't know i'm not thinking\nabout it too much but\num i i don't know you know a good\nquestion\nam i gonna catch up i don't know doc i\ndon't we have to see\nyeah i mean yes i'm i mean\ni'm getting infused we are i'm listening\nthat's\nyeah um\nit looks like she wants some attention\nfrom dad yeah\nthere's been yeah she's a daddy's girl\num\nthere's been some trouble uh with\nuh oh man don't press that button that's\nthe off button definitely don't press\nthat\ngo on um yeah no there's been she's\ngoing for it\nyeah no i'll make sure she doesn't okay\nyeah no there's been some she's\nmore of a daddy's girl than\nmum but it's uh yeah there's\ntrouble with i got pretty much\ni don't get too much detail because it's\na bit private but i had um\ni i we i was uh reported to\nthe social services do you have that in\namerica yeah\nright great so someone i don't know who\nreported me to the social services and i\nwas a\ntoxic abusive dad you know and they got\nto take all the reports seriously\nand they've been involved for the past\nhalf a year and um\nshe gives me so she she's such a daddy's\ngirl\nand her her mum they\nit's it's not to say she don't treat her\nmum the same way\nso they're looking at like she's a\nvillain do you understand\nthey're looking at her your\nmom her mom is a villain my ex yeah\nbecause she\nshe's so daddy's girl if i was to go to\nher school\nshe's ecstatic when she sees me when she\nsees her mom she's like oh it's mum\nbut the social services are like\noh is there something going on here\nyou're like why is she so different\nand they were telling me she can't\nexpress herself so it's all up in the\nair right now and they're really trying\nto make her speak\nbecause she can't speak right now so if\nsomething is going on we don't know\ndo you know so i'm in a bit of a\neven right she just came around the\nother day there's another meeting next\ntuesday\ntomorrow so it's all interesting when\nit's all just\ndrama gosh but how you how do you handle\nthat\nali what do you mean oh well i i can't\nworry about it too much because i've got\na life to live i got provided i've got a\nstream so i\ni could spend all because my ex partner\nshe's been dating this guy for seven\nmonths\nand he's i'm sorry to say he's not a\nnice guy he at all\nright and the third and i'm not trying\nto say you know when i want her to give\na nice guy but\ni mean the first conversation i got of\nthis guy was him saying that he was\ngonna\nyou know set my car fire and put me in\nit you know he's he's nuts\nbut she likes him and i'm happy for him\nto like him but i can't live my life\nworrying when she's with her mum i can't\nlive my life like that or could because\nlet me tell you something smoking's bad\nfor you eating unhealthy food's bad for\nyou but let me tell you what's really\nbad for you\nworry and working worry you can legit\nworry yourself to death you know that\ndoc\nyeah right so pretty much why worry it's\nnot\ni look after when she's with me when\nshe's with\nyeah how do you do that though well\ni just think to myself i'm even going to\nspend the rest of my life until she's 18\nworrying\nor i just got to get on with it and and\nbe happy\nand get on with the work so i can\nprovide for her because um\nali so so i i was under the impression\nyou had wanted to talk about sort of\nmoving on\nyeah absolutely yeah can you tell me a\nlittle bit about that\num okay so i've been on a lot\noff with this girl for 10 years and um\nand then about yeah seven months ago she\nwanted to\nshe she just met this guy oh she met\nthis guy\nand she's with him now and i hated her\nfor for like four to five months and i\noh i couldn't message her and you know\nthe school was like you gotta try and\nmake things right and be friendly to her\ni couldn't find me i was just so toxic\nto it i just hated how she just left me\nand now i only see my daughter half time\nbut about two months ago something\nhappened\ni woke up one day and there was no hate\nthere was nothing it was just civil and\ni was like oh and that's when you know\nyou're over someone\nisn't it because you don't hate them and\nyou don't love them you don't miss them\nor hate them there's nothing it's just\noh\noh okay so now we're cool\nwe're fine and i'm happy for her to be\nwith any guy and that's it so\ni've been happy for the past couple of\nmonths i gave like\ni bought her a pc for three thousand\npounds when she\nwhen she left she was trying to take the\npc i was like hold up we're not married\ni thought if you want that pc\nit's going to cost you 1300 pounds right\nand that was a great price\nand then um she didn't want it i said\nokay but then we made up and i was like\nyou know what\ntake it for 800 pounds which is an\namazing price if you saw the specs of\nthis thing\nand um i don't mind giving her like i\njust want it gone i just want\nher to have it or i'm trying to do her\nfavors because that's when you know over\nsomeone you don't hold grudges\nyou know so i could promise you i'm over\nthis girl\num but it is the um\nmother of my child so i'm always gonna\nhave a connection with her she's always\ngonna love\ni'm really weird every girl i've ever\nbeen with i wish them all well\ni want them to do well you know i don't\nhate any of them i don't\nhate anybody because hey for me hate is\nlike when you hate someone\nit's like why when you hate someone it's\nlike a pressure you go look over your\nshoulders for all your life\nyou know so yeah but it took time it\ntook time it took about five to six\nmonths\nof getting there but it got there in the\nend and i'm there's nothing now just i'm\nhappy with her so it's i mean it sounds\nlike you sort of sorted that out\nyeah i didn't i don't know what happened\ni just said to ryan who's my best friend\ni said i just woke up one day and there\nwas no hate\nand that is when you know your oversight\nthere was nothing i couldn't i didn't i\nthought i had to think to myself when\nwas the last time i thought about that\ngirl oh three days ago\ndo you know how does that mean\ntime heals everything you know\nor am i wrong i don't know man\nyeah i think it's yeah that's kind of\ndepends on\non what you say right i mean i i think\nit's quite remarkable that\nyou know you were filled with so much\nhate and then one day you wake up and\nit's gone\ni just i exactly exactly\nwe i don't know what happened doc\nyeah so it sort of makes sense i i think\ni can understand why you would make up\nfor lost time\nin terms of not speaking because it\nseems like sometimes you wake up and\nand your feelings just sort of sort\nthemselves out right\ninteresting time yeah for well everybody\neveryone's different right so when it\ncomes to me getting over that girl i\ni've just it might be different from\nsomeone else but that's how i got over\nit time hmm why is that\nis that the wrong answer because you're\nlooking at me no it's it's not the wrong\nanswer i i\ni ali i don't i don't have the right\nanswers i'm just curious because\nyou know a lot of times when we talk\ngotta say something yeah yeah go ahead\num when i got banned on twitter 2016\nbecause i've always had breakdowns i'd\nalways be emotional i'm either i'm\necstatically\nemotional so i went and got i'm gonna\nsaw a psychiatrist\nand um and then i went to source i went\nand saw a psychiatrist and within two\nhours of\npsych diagnosing me which was\nobviously private it cost me 250 pounds\nan hour which is like 320 bucks\nan hour in that two hour period she\ndiagnosed me with bipolar\nright so there's that and my nan was\nalso bipolar and uh pretty much let me\nsay this they put me on\nmood stabilizers right calm the mood so\neither take them before i slept\nbut then they were like okay after you\ntake the mood stabilizers we're going to\nput you on um\num so called lithium right so i was like\nokay now like i can lithium you gotta\ntake for the rest of your life okay i\nwas like okay sure let's do this\nso they write me a um they got they've\ngot the right prescription\nto be handed in to the um beyond the\ntill\nto get this lithium so i take it there\nand they turn around and go oh the\ndoctors forgot to sign it you have to go\ntake it back\nand i know at that point i don't want to\nsound i don't want to sound like\nsuperstitious or anything like that i'm\nnot christian\nbut i believe there was a force out\nthere in life where that wasn't meant to\nbe\ndo you understand what i'm trying to say\ndoc so i didn't after she didn't sign it\ni was like no it's no no this is\nhappening for a reason i'm not\ni'm not going to be on this lithium\nbecause that drug is like\nthat what i've been told that drug is a\nstrong drug that it's like\ndon't touch that button and that drug is\nlike dangerous and you've got to be on\nit for life and it'll calm you right\ndown\ni think they give it like people what\nthey'll consider what crazy\ni know people get offended by the word\ncrazy but that lithium drug you should\nknow\nit's like don't mix of that that's some\ndangerous stuff\nyou know um be\nright so i'll let you know so i i was\nwatching reckful's\nyou did interview with redford he's\nbipolar two\nnot i'm not saying two is in oh he's\nbipolar i'm saying\nright type two bipolar right i i'm not\ntype two i'm just\nbut i get days doc where i'm like oh no\nmy viewers make fun of me oh you're\nbipolar you're bipolar and they're like\nguys guys guys i'm not i'm not and then\nthe next time going bloody i am i am and\nthen on stream i'm\nhappy i'm wonderful everything's great\nand the next minute i'm they beat me\nwith the donations\nthey roast me that's what my streams are\nme cooking me getting roasted pretty\nmuch\nand then i get so sad and so down and\nit's just like the moods are like this\nyou know so i every day goes bump again\nokay i think i am here i think i am but\nyou know everyone's different your own\nways so ali\nyou know just a couple of thoughts one\nis does your mood fluctuate\nlike rapidly throughout days or are we\ntalking like\nyou'll be okay i never get it's very red\ni get depressed by the way because i\ndon't have a bad diet it's very red i\nget depressed\ni i can't remember the last time i was\ndepressed like depressed i can't\nremember\ni don't think there's been a day i mean\nmy life's been going so i won't lie to\nyou the past\nsince july when i started streaming\nagain my life's been\nperfect legit perfect and we're moving\nhouse we're buying our first house and\nwe bought that\nmy dream car because my viewers and it's\nlike it's nothing else really\nthat i want out of life i'm single i'm\ngoing to stay single by the way\nforever i mean that i don't think i'm\never going to get married and i know\nwe're going off onto a different\nconversation\nbut i mean i'm so happy and content\ni i don't relationships hurt you know\nbut i know it's\nthis shows about moving on but i'm\ngetting to a point where\nrelationships i feel like we're changing\ndoc and we could talk about that in a\nminute if you want but um\nas for my moods do my moods fluctuate a\nlot\ni'm i'm i don't know you'd have to watch\nmy vods i don't know\num i've never really thought about it\nokay well uh yeah\ntell me you mentioned something about so\nit sounds like you've\ngotten things figured out alex right\nright\nright so when you ask for the show i was\nlike okay i'm in good form i'm not like\ni think i think life is perfect so when\nyou were like we're talking about\ngetting overrelationships i was like\nokay i'm over the relationship\nyeah so so tell me what this so now that\nyou have things figured out you said you\ndon't want to get\nmarried no nothing okay right now just\nhear me here because some people might\nbe watching the old fashioned\nlet me just hear me out and don't laugh\nbecause this is what it is\n60 years ago 70 years ago right if you\nwere to\nwant to sleep with someone you had to\nmarry him right okay and then times\nchanged and then in order to sleep with\nsomeone you had to be\nwith them now that this day and age no\none cares\neverybody seems anybody and no one gives\na [ __ ] right you got all these rappers\nbragging about in their songs\nthe the men and the women and i feel\nlike we're in a generation now where\npeople are doing open relationships\npeople are just happy being free all the\ntime no one has the time for\nrelationships\nand the past half year i've been dating\nwomen but i never get with them and\ni tell them that from the start and we\njust enjoy our moments together\nyou know i think relationships and this\nis just my opinion i don't want anyone\nto get offended\nright i think relationships are dying\nout i just think people aren't doing\nrelationships because people don't have\nthe time for it\nyou can still spend time with someone\nhave a good time don't need to label it\nyou know i just don't feel and that's\nfor marriage marriage\nwow i just think that's so old-fashioned\ni don't think i'm ever going to get\nmarried doc\nand i thought you know because when\nyou're free and there's no label on it\nit's lovely\nyou know there's there's a science\nscientists say that us human beings are\naren't born to be with each other\nforever only dolphins are\nis that a true fact or am i am i reading\nfake news\nyeah i mean i i think i think human\nbeings have been\noftentimes monogamous in the history of\nhumanity\nand and i think that so that means that\npeople have been and committed\none-on-one relationships for a lot of\nhumanity and i don't tend to think that\nlike human beings\nare one way so i think that we have\ntendencies to be\nin you know relationships that are more\nopen and we have tendencies to be in\nrelationships that are more committed\nand i don't think like humanity i i\nthink either side that says\noh science says that open relationships\nare bad\nor scion says that open uh committed\nrelationships are bad i think neither of\nthose people really understand science\nbecause it's like we're complex human\nwe're complex organisms that's been my\nunderstanding and i think if it works\nfor you i i think that's fine i think um\nyou know like like you said so it sounds\nlike they're a lot of work\nand that um you you tend to find a lot\nof enjoyment\nout of kind of more temporary\nrelationships\nright and and so marriage sounds like\nheadache and bondage every the thing is\ndoc\nevery time you've got to remember this\nyou're smart i'm dumb\nright simple as that so when you're\ntalking words to me\ni like how you're talking to me you\nyou've got to get to my level because\notherwise i'm not going to understand\nyou\nright i know you're very extremely smart\ni got you um but let me say this\nand i'm going to be honest um every time\ni you know i'm very open book every time\ni get\nand i don't mean to brag i've i've been\nwith 22 women 23 women\nright in my life right when it comes to\nsleeping with the whole way that's not\nincluding other\nforeplay okay all these women that i've\nbeen with\ni can promise you i and i'm not bragging\nevery woman i get with they always try\nand get me in the relationship with them\nright and so most of my relationships\ni've landed in the relationship without\neven wanting to be there\nyou know you know how it can be if\nyou're a nice guy\none of these women or guys they you know\nthey give you\nand next you know it you're in a\nrelationship you're moving it together\nnow let's talk about marriage and you\ndidn't consent to it it just kind of\nfell into place\nand i always fought for that trap it\nhappened all my life i'm 28.\nit's happened all my life so now i'm\nlike no no no i need to start being more\nyou got to be cruel to be kind to doc\nyou know that you know that\nwhat does that mean you got to be cool\nto be kind you've got to be cruel to be\nkind\nto be kind okay okay so if you're always\nnice if you there's a girl that you like\nand she likes you and you make out\nthat's fantastic\nif she if you have consent sex with each\nother fantastic but she might get the\nincentive that you want to be with her\nand you got to tell her from the get-go\nactually\nthis isn't you've got to hurt her a bit\nto let know where she stands if you\ndon't tell her\nthat hey this is only you know us dating\ntemporary\nshe's going to get led on and she's\ngoing to get hurt way worse\nrather than telling her now yeah it's\nbest to be cruel to be kind\nearly you understand that it's happening\nno no it's not but it's just saying it\nit sounded cool i said it no i mean i\ni think it makes sense that you know it\nsounds to me that being\nsort of honest and transparent about\nwhat your intentions are towards a\nrelationship is absolutely a good thing\neven as soon as you make it out as soon\nas you get to know each other\nput it out on the table that's my advice\nto your viewers if you want to get with\na girl or a guy\njust let them know where you stand\nstraight away don't get yourself\nblock going don't go blindly because if\nyou do you're going to be ended up in a\nrelationship can i explain this\nmy daughter do you want to know how that\nhappened right sure three years\nthree years ago i was with this spanish\nwoman\ni got bad on twitch i went to spain i\nhad a spanish girlfriend which i didn't\nwant to be with but we landed in a\nrelationship like we're talking about\nwe finally broke up and it was kind of\nmessy i then had an italian girlfriend\nwho funny enough i made up with lot\nlast night i had so we we dated and that\nended\nterrible because drama and then straight\nafter i\ngot with um the mother of mother of my\nchild right so we\nhooked up on on on a couple of occasions\njust for\njust for sex and she was you know the\ntruth is she didn't plan on getting\npregnant she didn't know she can get\npregnant because she\nwas she was convinced she couldn't get\npregnant and then\nshe was we were friends and she was\nlooking for accommodation so she stayed\nwith me because i was being nice because\ni'm a nice guy\nand then the first i moved into this\nhouse doc i'm cleaning my car\ni'm looking up i talked to my neighbours\ni looked up i said thank you god\ni've got my supra which is my sports car\ni looked up and thank you god nothing\ncan ruin this moment\ni turned around i opened the door and\nshe went i'm pregnant\nwhile holding a pregnancy stick so i\nsaid\nyeah yeah and i said [ __ ] you and she\nshe was like\nshocked like this like but no no no\nseriously [ __ ] you because i don't i\ndon't really believe in abortion right\nso i was so upset i cried i never i\nnever cried i went to my mum's i said\nmom i don't want this i can't be a dad\ni'm\nterrible um and my mum really loved her\nso my mom was like\nencouraging it which is another note to\nall the viewers out there\ndon't don't force yourself to stay with\nsomeone if you don't want to be\nof them it's not right right you connect\nbecause you're gonna they're\nyou're wasting your time and you're\nwasting their time and that's what i\nlearned with my ex\nally your camera's just a touch blurry\ni'm sorry yeah so\nso aly i want to kind of dig into one\nthing maybe\nso you say that you you land into\nrelationships and then you also said\nthat one day you kind of wake up\nand then there was like no more hatred\nso i'm kind of noticing that like\nsometimes\nthey're just the language that you use\nalmost makes it sound like\nyou know things sort of happen outside\nof your\nintentions or control\n[Music]\nsorry ask me the question one more time\nthere wasn't even a question there i'm\njust making an observation that\nsometimes the way that you talk about\nthings you sort of say like i\ni you know you wind up in a relationship\nyep that's right\nit and it's you make it sound like the\nweather you know right\nand and also like when it comes to your\nmood you kind of mention that you know\none day you woke up and\nand your hatred was gone and that too it\nsort of sounds like a roll of the dice\nyeah yeah yeah so i'm just i'm just\nwondering whether there's some value\ninto digging into like\nhow do things happen in your life and\nlike what role do you play in them\nbecause it's kind of interesting right\nbecause if people could learn\nwhat happened to you right so my life's\ni've always just gone into life blindly\ni've never had enough structure it's\nonly been recently where i'm like okay\ni'm gonna stream every day right i'm\ngonna have my best friend\nlook out for me and he's gonna help me\nand we're just going to\nfocus on no relationships going i'm\nhaving a good time every couple of\nweekends\nright we can't do every weekend so i've\ngot my daughter on on the weekends on\nthe week where i have her\nand right now it's just full focus\ntwitch all in\nwith our chips twitch tv right so for\nthe first time in my life because i'm\nnow 28 i've just realized to have\nstructure but before the past 28 years\ni've just been doing life blindly and\ni've been that's why i've been\nso with relationships jumping in in and\nout\nin and out there's been drama there's\nbeen hatred but for the first time\nyou need you definitely need in your\nlife like a um\na plan like a routine or yeah an idea of\nwhere you want your life to go\nwhat do you want start planning now\nwhere do you want to be in a couple of\nyears time\nyeah so so can you tell me how do you\nhow do you\nlike how did you wind up in a\nrelationship\nthe last one yeah sure anyhow okay so we\nshe obviously was pregnant and she was\nwith with her\nand there were talks hooks of abortion\nand even though we were both against it\nit and anyone watching could say they're\nagainst abortion but the second that you\nare in that predicament where you have\nsomeone pregnant\nyou you start thinking maybe i'm not so\nmuch against it do you understand doc\nsure do you understand because it's\ndifferent when you're in that position\nas an outsider from the outside right\nexactly so their ward talks about it um\nand believe it or not\nthis the day that and we this is going\nto sound horrible but the day that\nit was like a couple of months into it\nof of because it takes months here in\nthe uk\nall the way sorry to sound rude but the\nabortion clinic here in the uk\nis like a month waiting period because i\nguess people just love unprotected sex\nright so we were lined up to do that\nwhich sounds horrible that she's here\nnow but back then\nshe wasn't existed we didn't know of her\nso i don't want people watching thinking\noh that's horrible she's right there\nshe wasn't even around it was nothing it\nwasn't a you know\nso the day that it was meant to happen\ntell me why doc the alarm didn't go off\ni don't know why\ndon't ask me why you know she was gonna\nsaid the alarm it never went off\nright so pretty much i got up i was\nupset like oh my god\nare you crazy we can't be adults you\nknow i'm a childish idiot and i'm not\nready for this\nso she starts crying and i thought and i\nwas so nice i was like [ __ ]\ni can't put this stress on her because\nif you stress out a woman who's pregnant\nyou can ruin their\nbody you know that right you can ruin a\nbody where they can't even have babe\nbecause the stress of\nso i gave her a hug i said it's fine\ndon't worry about it we have to\nreschedule\nbut i never did reschedule we never did\nreschedule next thing you know what doc\nshe's got a bump and it's growing and i\njust put it off i was like you know what\nyou know this because twitch were on\nbanning me at the same time\nand twitch were like look we want to\ngive a really clean profile i was like\nno problem\ni can't have all the structure so next\nthing now that she's you know she's\ni became overweight by the way that's\nanother thing i came really overweight\nand my fans hated me like they made fun\nof me and\nwith the overweight and all that bad\nfood because when my\nwhen my girlfriend was pregnant that\nwomen have cravings they crave a lot of\nfood\ni was eating the craving food as well\nlike the fast food the mcdonald's the\nkfc's\nand then pretty much next you know she\ngave birth fantastic\nthat was great and then in that year\nperiod of\nuh my daughter being brought up being\nalive i was i forced myself to stay in\nthat relationship\nto do the right thing i got to be a\nparent i got to step up i've got to\nstand this relationship now this is my\nlife\nand in that year doc was the worst year\nof my life i loved my daughter\nbut forced myself self to stay of that\nwoman when i didn't want to be in a\nrelationship it wasn't toxic i just\nit was so hard um and then\nbecause i didn't want to be with the\nwoman i wanted to be free\ni always like being free and a lot of\nthese and i'm not trying to\ni'm not at all sexist at all but a lot\nof the women i get with\nthey see my freedom and they want to\njust take me and shove me in a cage and\nhold me there\nthere's a people people have this thing\nof where to control other people\nand i hate being controlled i get so\nangry i mean i was just\ndating a woman last month from wales and\nshe was 38 10 years on me\nand she we i knew for a week doc one\nweek\nand she started saying where are you\nwhere are you going why are you out who\nare you with and i just said back up\nman back up i'm not doing this because i\njust hate people that\ncontrol people is that like an\ninsecurity thing i just don't like\npeople that control other people and\ni've been controlling my life\nbut yeah controlling you in your life\nman every girl i've ever got with man i\ni\ncan't there's only been one girl i've\never wanted to be with and that was my\nex-girlfriend\nin 2014 to 15 which ended up cheating on\nme which i deserved it because\ni was so naive doc i could tell you\nstories and blow your mind but i've been\ni've gone through everything but you\nknow what i only blame myself\ni i was so naive i used to invite all\nthese guys around all my fans\nright and she had real depression i'm\nnot talking everyone has\neveryone watching my depression we've\nall suffered from depression but\nyou don't know depression until you meet\nsomeone who's\nseverely depressed where every day is a\nmission\nevery day they're crying every day they\nhave to take the antidepressants\ncan i ask you one or two questions go\nahead\nso i'm kind of curious about no i i love\nyour stories man i love listening to you\ntalk\nyou're a really good storyteller right\nyeah but all my fans think they're fake\nbut they're not fake i swear to you go\non\nno i don't think they're fake man thank\ngod thank god\num so so you know it's interesting\nbecause you kind of talk\nit's almost like fate right so like\nyou're talking about these things like\nyou know the the morning that you were\nscheduled\nyou met you the alarm got unplugged like\nduring the when you got prescribed the\nlithium somewhat\nand so i'm just i'm kind of noticing\nthat it i can't\ntell ali whether you're in control of\nyour life\ndoc i'm convinced i'm confident and i\ndon't want to sound crazy or like\ninsane but i'm convinced that there's\nit's a stimulation like the matrix that\ni'm the only real person here and i'm\nbeing watched by eight\nbillion trillion aliens in my brain and\ni'm just a puppet and they're just\neveryone around me is not real that's\nwhat i'm convinced do you understand\nwhat i mean by that like how do i know\nthat you're real how do i know she's\nreal\nit could all be a simulation because\neverything is just happening for a\nreason\nright so i don't sound nuts but you must\nunderstand where i'm coming from right\nyeah because everything's happened for a\nreason and i believe this and i said\nthis to ryan i'm so\nglad my twitch career has been dead for\nthe past three years because\ni didn't want her mother my child to be\ninvolved in it because i feel like\nit wasn't meant to be it's only started\ntaking off the past couple of months doc\ni'm gonna be honest with you\nyeah so how does that feel when you say\nfaked you scared the hell out of me\nbecause i used to play league of legends\nand there was a catholic twisted fate\nand i don't sound cringy but he's like a\ncard master who believes in fate it's\njust weird that he said the word fate\nit is like fake my life is like fake\neverything has happened for a reason\nyou're scaring me doc yeah yeah yeah so\ni mean what's up with that\ndon't ask me i don't i don't every let\nme tell you this right now there is\nnothing in my life i would change\nright now at this moment there's nothing\nzero\nlife's perfect my best friend and me are\nworking together\nmy daughter and me have got the closest\nrelationship\nall the streamers like me i mean my fat\nand my viewers\nthey make the content all i got to do is\nturn up and cook\nwho's responsible for that ally\neverything in your life is going well\nright so\nshould i tell you what it is positivity\nevery if you're in life if you're a\npositive person\neverybody's positive let me give you an\nexample if you turned up to\na car dealership right and you want to\nbuy a car\nif you turn up or being negative they're\nnot going to want to do business with\nyou if you're all positive and like oh\ni'm going to work a lot i'm going to do\nthis\nthey might give you that load on that\ncar because they believe in your\npositivity\nif you go around all being negative no\none wants to be your friend\nknows to do business no one's to get to\nknow you you've got to be positive to\nto have positivity in your life and\nhonest to god i'm always smiling\ni swear to you honest to god and\nyeah that sounds powerful right but let\nme tell you this though doc\nshall i tell you why sure diet you don't\nunderstand\ndoc i don't want to sound like a crazy\nperson but my god\nthe government should ban white pasta\nwhite rice\nwhite bread it should all be permanently\nbut and i don't want to my dad's turkish\ni'm not but red meat\nred meat should be bad it's so unhealthy\nfor you it makes you feel terrible next\nday\nit's just as bad as alcohol are you i'm\nnot i'm not religious\nbut i've i've been fat and i've been\nthin and i'm telling you now\ndiet is effing i i've experimented this\n100 times\nif i was to eat a bowl of rice tonight\nand then wake up tomorrow i'd feel\ndrained i feel terrible i feel depressed\nlegit i feel\nmy brain what do you eat\ni eat chicken like not i like fried\nchicken but just\ncooked chicken with seeds walnuts\nalmonds salad spinach eggs\ni've got all the time i prefer a salad\nany time\nall the time and i feel so strong when i\neat it and it makes me feel\ngive it a try flush out your system\ndon't eat anything bad for 24 hours only\neat healthy and you'd feel\nso good but you've got to eat you've got\nto eat some fats as well because fats\nfats are designed to make you feel good\nbut not too much fats\nyeah avocado or if you want to eat\nchocolate have a bit of chocolate\nat the end of the day reward yourself or\nhave a couple of sugars in your tea you\nknow but that's the truth\nit's all about diet people ask me a lot\nif you look at my instagram i\ndid a transformation i was the if you go\nback i would\nmy face look like a bumblebee like i was\nstung by a bumblebee\nthree years ago because i i was 14 stone\ni'm now 10 eight yeah i know you don't\ndo

smoked\nmarijuana twice and that was in\ncalifornia twitchcon last year\nand pretty much i'll tell your viewers\nright now if you're fighting depression\nor anxiety\nnumber one rule i'd say to you is look\nat your diet and tell me that isn't your\ndiet doing that to you\ngive it a day where you don't eat bread\nor pasta or or rice\ngive it a try and just eat the right\nfoods and chicken is amazing fish\namazing but yeah that's the one thing\ni'd say so back to the question\num who's doing all this to you first was\nme\nand it's my diet and everything else i i\ndon't get angry\never i've never if something back my\ndaughter spilled\num porridge all over me i just kind of\nlaughed and wiped it off here's a funny\nstory\nlast week i had a white car right it was\nmy exes but i bought it for

was faking it right you would see\nright through me\nyou would see you would know if i'm\nlying to you right now right\nuh i thought maybe you could get a sense\nof people right okay yeah\nwhat i'm trying to say is i'm not lying\ni'm not trying to say\nyou know i don't have any issues i've\nbeen through a lot\nbut right now i don't even like to think\nabout it i can talk about it\nbut yeah honestly yeah\nyeah so aly can i can i share what i\nwhat i am getting from you\ngo ahead i'm always so so i i think i\nmean you do sound very genuinely happy i\ni think you\nyou know you've you've sort of figured\nout\nwhat you want and and you know you're\nkind of living life and i think you're\nmaking the most of life i think\nyou kind of roll with the punches right\nthat's it\nand and so i i really see that i i think\num\ni'm a little bit uh you know i think\nthere's\nthere's something to be said of\nsort of the fate right so i i don't know\nexactly how to understand that\num but i i do think it's kind of\ninteresting because you know yeah\nhonestly ali and let me know i i don't\nmean to offend you or anything would you\nremind me obviously\ni'll get i can't get offended you've got\nto [ __ ] i'm the most\nundefeatable person you could offend you\ncould call me anything you want go ahead\nno so\nyou kind of remind me of a b a\nlike a b like a wasp slash b yeah yeah\nyeah like a b like you're kind of like\nmoving from flower to flower\nright right like if you think about like\nif you think about the existence of a\nbee it's like it's kind of like\nhappy-go-lucky and it's sort of like\nyou're\nkind of going over here today like we're\non this flower we're gonna appreciate\nall of its beauty we're gonna just you\nknow do what we're doing today and then\nyou kind of flip to the next flower\nyou kind of flip to the next flower now\ni'm hearing i'm hearing notes of of you\nreally trying to structure your life\nand trying to actually like be dedicated\nto something which is very not be like\nyou know then it's it's more like you're\nyou're kind of like really kind of\nfocused on building something\nyou're dedicated to streaming streaming\nevery day you're dedicated to building\nstructure for your daughter you have her\none week on one week off\nso you're you're not you know in a sense\ni think a b is a little bit unfair but i\nkind of see both of these sides of you\none is like\nyou know live for today be with the\nperson that you're with\nenjoy yourself on any given day\nbe with the woman that you're with and\nthen you know\nsometimes you feel very very concerned\nabout getting caged\nand it seems like there's something\nindescribably attractive\nto to women about you because once they\nget a taste of ali they can't\nthey need a little bit more people dog\npeople gonna say\npeople are gonna say cap all the time\nbut doc\nyou gotta see it in person you've gotta\nsee it in person you're gonna see a\nperson\ni think so man i i believe you dude i i\nthink that there's\nyou know i think you're a very\ncharismatic positive sort of guy right\nright the thing that i sometimes wonder\na little bit about is that you know\nyou're you're talking about\nfeeling perfect in the here and now and\nthat makes sense i think you're\ngenuinely very happy\nbut what i'm also getting the sense of\nis that that you know that\nthere can be sunny days and there can be\ncloudy days\nright right and and that like everything\nis fine until\nyou feel controlled or until and then\nsomething will really upset you\nor you know even if you kind of talk a\nlittle bit about like the story of\nof how you discovered that you're you\nknow that i don't even know what to call\nher your ex-girlfriend\nor was pregnant and and so you know\nthere are a lot of\nups and downs right and so i i think\nand and a lot of times people will call\nthis bipolar i'm not i don't really know\ni mean i have to i'd have to ask you a\nbunch of questions i'm not so sure that\nyou're bipolar\nbut because it seems to me that you're\nso just a quick\nuh take a step back and and here's my\nunderstanding of bipolar\na lot of people think about bipolar as\num you know like you're like you have a\ngood day and then you have a bad day and\nyou're happy one minute and you're\nreally angry the next minute that's not\nreally\nbipolar that's what we call emotional\nlability\nwhich means that your emotions can rise\nand fall very quickly\nright um bipolar disorder what i really\nthink of is\nis episodes that last days weeks or even\nmonths at a time\nof being depressed or manic or hypomanic\nand so the closest thing that i can kind\nof get to is that you know you\nyou know that's possible that you had\nthat mood episode for four to five\nmonths\nafter your uh ex-girlfriend kind of\nbroke up with you or whatever like six\nseven months ago and you said you one\nday you woke up and you just felt better\nthat actually is the thing that makes me\nthink the most about any\ni mean but that just could be you know\nit doesn't have to be\nan illness or anything it's just you\nknow you had a bad situation where it\nsounds like your ex-girlfriend cheated\non you and you were\nbreathing and unhappy and it sounds like\nan appropriate\nsadness to me um the interest i'm going\nto get is from you\nyeah i don't i don't want to hold that\nfault it's going to sound crazy and i\nsay this to my viewers all the time\nbut i really do believe i've never done\ncocaine and i've never i've only smoked\nmarijuana twice in california i'm not a\ndrunk i'd like to get drunk i don't\ni have a cupboard stashed with alcohol i\ndon't touch it i'm not craving it i\nnever have never will\nbut the thing is i really do think i've\ngot a healthy diet and i\nthink and i don't want to make people\nthink i've got the biggest ego but i\nthink\ni'm an example of the perfect human\nbeing and when people see me all happy\nthey think oh you're bipolar because\nyou're way too happy or you're way too\nloud or you're way too confident you're\nbipolar i don't think i am i think i'm\nan example of a perfect human being we\nsaid people think oh look at this guy\nhe's got a huge ego he must be bipolar\nso people just can't understand me\nbecause i'm i don't\ndrug my body i don't i look after i work\nout\nand uh i just want to share of you i\nreally do believe to myself\ni'm an example of what everyone should\nbe like a healthy minded positive\nthinking person\nand that's just what i feel so i i also\ndon't think i'm bipolar\nenough that you're telling me well\nyou're what do you think this would be\nsurvived by bipolar\nfor sure i don't know if you're bipolar\nor not i was definitely i was definitely\ndefinitely\nlooking i came in i got battle twitch i\nwent into that psychiatrist\nangry looking for any answer why am i\nlike this why am i\nand she diagnosed me within two hours\nwhich is way too short for a diagnosis\nin my opinion and on top of that do you\nknow what they did to my driver's\nlicense\nthey they made it from like a 20-year\nlicense to like a one-year license we\nhave to renew every year\nso i go back to the doctors and i'm like\ntake that bipolar off my record right\nnow and they're like we can't do that\nsir\nit's like cancer once it's on the record\nit's on there for life i was like oh\nwe'll take it off\nbecause i don't want my driver's license\nrevoked every year so they've now made\nit a three-year license so every three\nyears i've got to get tested\nto make sure i'm i'm fit enough to draw\nallie let me just be very clear i i'm\nnot removing bipolar from your chart\nbecause i don't really know if you're\nbipolar or not all i'm saying is that\nso far i think a lot of times people\nconfuse something called emotional\nability with bipolar disorder right\nand and bipolar disorder is a period is\nreally characterized by weeks or\nmonths of feeling a particular mood\nlevel\nyeah and then you switch for once again\nweeks to months\ni still now what i'm hearing from you is\nthat and\nand i i get what you're saying about you\nknow being a perfect human being\nbut what i'm what i'm hearing from you\nis that you're a perfect human\nyou're a perfect human being some of the\ntime\nright did i say that no\nbut that's what i'm guessing um\nwell in the past few months with my\nstreaming streaming and all that\neffort's\nfantastic like i've got everything that\ni want in life so i'm always\nhigh you understand yeah so what happens\nwhen you don't have something that you\nhave in life\nlike my twitch channel my twitch channel\nthat i told you it was the worst doc\nnever get yourself banned on twitch i\nyou\nyeah uh i could explain i couldn't i\ncould it brings back\nlike that i i need do you know what it\nis the attention\nit's i'm at a party i you know what it's\nit's a race\nright now we're in a race 100 meter\nsprint all these streamers are lining up\nand i'm in the race\nbefore that a channel i'm not in that\nrace i've got to sit from the sidelines\nthat's what it's like i can't compete so\nso that that's what concerns me a little\nbit is that like so if we\nif okay let me just can i think for a\nsecond before while i\ncollect my thoughts okay i'm gonna view\nand put the kettle on\ni'm all is yeah i'm just thinking\ni love what you do doc gotta say as you\nthink love what you do\nbest stream i'll tell you\nthanks ally i appreciate that man\nyeah so ali here's the really confusing\nthing\nso i i i think i think a lot of what you\nsay\nmakes a lot of sense i don't disagree\nwith you really much at all i think that\nyou\num i'm not surprised that i love that\num i i'm not surprised that many women\nwant more of a relationship with you\nthan\nyou want with them i i don't think that\nuh i think that you've discovered a\ncouple of really important things about\nyour mood and diet and things like that\num and i i do think that at times you\nhave um\nyou know a really wonderful energy about\nyou uh\nyou know you're positive you're\ncharismatic you're funny you're a good\nstoryteller\nall those things are great um the thing\nyeah yeah yeah there's a there's the\nother shoe coming so get ready for it\nso so here's the only thing that really\nconcerns me ali is that that it seems\nlike a lot of this stuff is dependent\non things outside of your control so\nthis is what's really interesting is\nthat you know when i ask you about\nit you know why are you feeling so good\nabout yourself i think you've discovered\na couple things that absolutely are in\nyour control right\nso your diet staying positive waking up\nevery day and saying okay i'm going to\nfocus on stream and then stream kind of\ndoes well\nand like reinforces you so it's kind of\ninteresting because you're\nyou're you're like i think you're\nhalfway i mean i i agree with you\na hundred percent but i i feel like\nsomething's missing there's something\nincomplete\nand i think what this comes back to is\nis sort of this idea of like attention\nseeking\nand that's the best way i'm gonna\ndescribe it is that it seems to me\num ali that a lot of the way that you\nfeel is dependent on your circumstances\nso like when yeah for example like today\nwhen my daughter had a bit of a\ntemperature and she couldn't go to\nschool i couldn't stream i was\nreally upset i was so frustrated and\nflustered\nand i'm so oh and i was sitting there\ngoing my fans are going to kill me\nthey're going to think i'm lying\nyou know i'm ditching yeah good example\nand you're right\nyeah now i'll keep going i'm listening\nyeah so so\nyou know if we think about 10 year old\nyou that that um\nwhen your teacher says okay kids\neveryone take your seats and then you\nsay [ __ ] you miss\nand then everyone laughs then you feel\namazing right\ncan i just go back a second yeah i would\nbe more like cheeky i i\nyou know i said that but back in school\ni would say like when i was 10 11 12\nyou could ask anybody went to my school\ni'd say miss i've woke up miss you got\nreally nice tits today\ni should go ally get out right now and\nshe would laugh but i would go out so it\nwasn't like a toxic\nit was like a yeah i was yeah but go on\ncarry on i don't want to come across as\nlike a toxic but go on\nno yeah so so i i don't\ni i'm just noticing that i think a lot\nof what your mood or\njust how you feel about yourself and a\nlot of your positivity\nseems to be dependent on\ncertain aspects of the outside world and\nespecially\nlike sort of the esteem of other people\nand that you know if if things are going\nwell on twitch or you're able to stream\nor stuff like that you feel really good\nabout yourself\nbut if you're kind of isolated if you're\nback to being like the kid that you were\nwhen you were growing up where you were\nsort of like\nyou know people sort of didn't treat you\nwith respect and stuff like that\nit kind of makes it so you kind of\ndon't feel so good about yourself which\nis normal right so like we respond\num to how we get treated\nyeah i'm with you you're right but is\nthat a bad thing though\nis it like no i mean everyone's like me\nso so\neveryone's like that right so if people\nmake fun of me then i'm gonna feel bad\nabout myself\nand if if people treat me well i'm gonna\nfeel good about myself\ni think some people are more or less\nresponsive to the esteem of others\nokay right so so what i'm curious about\nand i\nand this is the thing is i think when\nyou're positive i can see why people\nsort of would\nuse the term bipolar to describe you\nbecause\nit seems to me that you know a lot of\ntimes you're like you're\nas you put it a perfect human being um\nand and you know pardon me ally but i i\ndon't think that you're\nuh i i don't think you're enlightened or\nsomething like the buddha or\nchrist or anyone like that so i i don't\nthink you're actually perfect\ni think you're perfect the way you are\num\nand at the same time i wonder like when\nyou're feeling less than perfect like\nwhat does that look like and where does\nthat come from\nand how do you buffer yourself\nhow do you okay i'm gonna tell you now\ni am addicted to feeling good and\nlooking good\naddicted so much addicted that about two\nyears ago\nsomeone changed the forehead emote to a\nfree head emote\nright you know when some brits on\nbritish talks and the whole chat spam's\nfree head\nmy teeth were scuffed before right i\nwhen people started smacking free head\nto me\ni went and got my teeth knocked out by a\ndentist and got fake teeth put in like\nyou see my teeth now\nthey're all fake let me get up there but\nand let me tell you why\nright because number one i'm insecure as\nhell not anymore i used to be\nsince i've changed everything i know i\nlook like yeah i'm not scared anymore\nbut look you see that\nthey're not real okay yeah now because\nthey were all scuffed before but let me\ntell you this as well\nso much so and i mentioned my dad's\nturkish that my\nviewer base grew of me having a big bent\nnose i thought it was big\nit was bent it was like a witch it was\nlike have you played the sims\nyou know the character the game the sims\nyou can create a character you could\nchange their eyes their eyelashes\ntheir cheeks the jewel but it looks like\ngod made gave me a really big nose and\nit was a doc it wasn't like a bit no it\nwas like oh my god that guy's got a huge\nnose it doesn't suit him\nso the first thing i did was it cost me\nfive grand i got a nose job right\nthere's no scarring they went underneath\nthe nose so i won't lie to you i'm\naddicted now\nto looking good feeling good and i weigh\nmyself every day i am very conscious of\nwhat i eat if i was to eat cheese\nor like a slice of pizza that's like two\npounds on there and i need to lose that\nweight\nbut i and this is a problem i've got\nwhere i'm addicted to looking and\nfeeling good\ni've got grey hairs i have a gray hair\nso much so i have to get my hair\ndyed like oh this is like you see this\nlike a silver blonde thing going on\nbecause that's who i am and honestly it\nfeels amazing but if that was to be\nif if i do slip or if i do look bad i\nfeel\nterrible i feel horrible no one's\nlooking at me\nno one likes the way i look at is it a\nbad thing doc is it a bad thing\ni think so oh you think it is yeah\nright why yeah great question and i'm\nsorry i'm just being transparent with\nyou\nso i i think that at some point so what\ni'm hearing is that you're your\nyour your esteem of yourself is\ndependent on\nexternal things right the way that you\nfeel about yourself\nright right but that's then you're right\ngo on carry on\nno go for it you want to say something\nand i won't lie i don't know this is why\ni'm like this because this is one\nquestion i've got myself i've done one\nlike this\nbut doc i'd like and i don't know\nit's a problem it's an addiction i am\naddicted to\num what's the what i'm looking for here\num i'm very uh materialistic\nand i like it i wear it and i like it i\nlike i don't think it's just\nmaterialistic yeah so um\nhave you have you seen the car just\nbought it's a big\nblack jaguar f-pace suv and\nit when you if you look at it you're\ngoing to say that is a [ __ ] extension\nwell nothing wrong by penis stock i can\npromise you nothing don't need it's fine\nit's a great size\nbut you'd look at it and think why there\nare there are 23 women that\nget a taste of it and want more right so\nright\nso either way my point is i don't know\nthis one i know myself really well but i\ndon't know why i'm so addicted to\nmaterialistic things i always\nhow does it make you feel to have that\nit annoys me\ni told you this it angers me so much\nwhen i see all these streamers that are\nmillionaires\nand they don't even they don't\nshow their communities what they've what\nwhat their viewers have bought them it\nannoys me it makes me\nangry i don't know why i get some people\nto be private for their own security i\nget that\nbut for me every time if i'm going to\nbuild something i want to say guys\nyou bought me this and so right now\nwe're going to buy a house and i can't\nwait to move in i can't wait to show my\nviewers to a\nstore like you guys got me this and i\njust said i've got something wrong with\nme there\nso how did it make you feel when i\nbought that car do you want to know the\ntruth yeah\nokay so the first i bought that car i\nfelt amazing it felt great i showed\neveryone i felt on top of the world\nthe next day doc and it still feels the\nsame way i\ndon't i don't even feel like i own the\ncar it feels like it's not even there\ni'm like i want my house now\ni want a dual garage with a driveway\nwith a gated with gates i want security\ni want a cctv i want big girls i want a\ni want my friends with me i want my dad\nfor me i want a big house just to say\nthat\nalso to say to my ex and this is about\nmoving on but it's just\ni want it to all the girls i've ever\ndated to say haha [ __ ] you\nlook what you could have got it's like\nbragging rights i i'm not i don't choose\nto be like that\nbut that's how i feel so maybe there is\na second one with me you can tell me\nwhy am i like this\nyeah let me let me just think about how\nto answer that oh good\nso allie what i'm noticing is that like\nso you've got this car right it's an\nawesome car fantastic oh i've got a\nsuper\nokay go on okay so and and i\ni think it like it makes sense that you\nknow you're happy and you want to share\nthat with your viewers because you're\nthe viewers of the ones that enabled you\nto get that car like totally makes sense\nright\nit makes me feel really good when i'm\nout going to bars and clubs and\nhotels and i'm pulling up in the best\ncar they're like hahaha\nwankers yeah not a sounding mature but\nwe're going to get everyone out on the\ntable now\nis this a problem of mine i it's how i\nfeel i don't know why i'm like what i\nthink\nwhy like this i think so i think it is a\nproblem\nas a poor kid i was brought up i didn't\nget any pocket money we lived in a\ncaravan\na cat and guess what my mom still lives\nin the caravan like proper\nproper eight mile a\nm m yeah i'm not joking\nokay i never had my own bedroom\nbedroom for my sisters yeah i'm gonna\nsay something it's gonna be a little bit\njudgmental okay do it and i think we\nsort of we got\nto this in the first few minutes but so\nyou're making up\nfor being a shy kid who didn't have his\nown bedroom\ngrew up in a caravan with bad teeth and\na mom who\nslept around and and now to make\nthat like on the inside that kid is\nthere\nand so the more that you make yourself\nperfect on the outside\nthe more you get your t3 done get your\nnose done\ndye your hair drive a fancy car the more\nyou can ignore forget or no longer be\nthat kid i'm not going to cry but yeah i\nthink that i think you're right is\nyou've just blown my mind\ni think you're damn right i hated that\nme yeah\nyou got it and i'm not yeah i'm not\nashamed of that i'm not i'm actually\nmore proud of you i\nam now i'm more proud of who i am now\nthan that i'm like that's definitely not\nme\nbut yeah you you yeah but but so but tha\nso here's here's the problem right so\nali you\nyou try so hard to not be that kid\nwhich makes sense and at the same time\nlike i don't think there's anything\nwrong with that kid\nright that kid like he's just he did the\nbest that he could given the\ncircumstances that he had\nand like sure that kid can grow into\nlike\na successful man who takes care of\nhimself\nand like eats properly and goes out of\nhis way to take care of his daughter and\nlike is an awesome dad\nand streams on twitch and tries to\nprovide positivity to people and give\nback\nand and you don't have to be ashamed of\nthat kid\nthe reason i think this stuff is bad ali\nis because when you buy the jaguar you\nfeel awesome for a day\nand then the next day it's like what's\nnext yeah\nyeah yeah yeah right yeah and so you get\na nose job\nand then you feel amazing and then it's\nlike oh [ __ ] i got to get my teeth done\nnext time yep yep yep all my viewers\nknow that that's\ni or they ah yeah you've now there and\nalso as my daughter let me say this\nmy dad wasn't there for me my i wish my\ndad was there for me i always wanted my\ndad to turn up to school\nand to see me and i wanted always i\nalways want to spend days with my dad i\nalways wanted\nmy dad to come to school to pick me up\nin his car he had the same car\ni've currently got the supra and i\nalways wanted that but he never did\nand that's why when i talk to her school\nnow i'm the best parent there and all\nthe kids look at me and they wish that i\nwas that i was the dad and all the proud\nparents look at me and i'm like\nbut yeah so i'm being the dad that my\ndad want there for me\ni'm being that dad for her and yeah\nthat's the truth\num but yeah you're nailing this you're\nreally good at what you do\nbut i'm really tough i'm crying on the\ninside but i'm not going to shot on the\noutside i'm not going to do it\nbut yeah right so there it is again\nbecause because what you see\nwhat you s what we see on the outside is\nso important to you\nright is that bad though it's not\ni generally speaking i i hope you don't\nstay that way i think it's fine\nwe're all that way and then the question\nis do we want to be a different way\nbecause he let me put it to you this way\nali you're you're gonna you're gonna\nmodel like your daughter's gonna learn a\nlot from you\nokay and so do you wanna teach her that\nif her nose doesn't look perfect\nshe has less value as a human being no\nbut i'll be paying for a nose drop if\nshe wants it but\nask me a question again sorry ask me the\nquestion so like\ni've already thought about this if her\nnose comes out anything like my old nose\nbecause in genetics or any of my kids\ni ordered those jobs are on me for free\nit's like it's like that's\njust standard go on ask me the same\nquestion again because yeah i mean what\ndo you want to teach her\nabout her worth what is her worth\ndependent on\ni want her to i don't want her to be a\ntwitch streamer like me i want her to\nactually have an education go through\nuni and be\nsomething to change the world don't\npress that button don't you dare press\nthat button\num yeah so what's okay so do i want to\nbe like me in that way\nwell i just want her to be i'm just\ngonna let her be\nthe woman she wants to be and i'm just\nif saying\nif she starts being a bit weird or i'd\njust say\nis that who you are if that's who you\nwant to be be\nthat because life's not hard dark i want\nto be honest with you if any viewers\nwatching this is what i've learned\nif you want to be that guy it takes a\nmini second in your brain to be that guy\nfor the rest of your life\nif you want to be a dick of a person you\ncan just be a dick and you're that dick\nperson so\nif you want to be a nice person be it it\ntakes a second\nto be that person and that's the truth\nso um\nwhat's my point with my daughter i'm\ngonna let her sculpture herself\nbut if there is ever a concern or a bit\nlike that's a bit weird\nwhat you're doing i might say are you\nsure you're sure sure\ni mean that's your job i'm never going\nto be a parent where i'm making them but\nyou know you've got\nstrict parents out there that make them\nwear that certain amount of that clothes\nor where that or they're going to be and\nshe's going to be\na free bird and i'll pray she makes the\nright decisions\nokay guys let me let go on so\nallie let me try to i'm going to try to\nexplain this you asked me is that bad so\nlet me put it to you this way so like\nlet's take your ex-girlfriend right so\none day you woke up\nand you no longer hated her now does\nthat\nlack of hate\nso hatred can kind of come from two\nplaces like\nlike maybe the reason uh how can i this\nis sorry i i gotta take a step back\ni use that even to this day i use that\nas an energy the reason i came popular\nin 2015 to 2016 because my ex cheated on\nme\nand i was like [ __ ] you i'm gonna stream\nmake it\njust to piss you off and i use that\nenergy and that transformed the song\nperfect\nand then after half a year when i was\nover i had this perfect thing going on\nso use it as an energy\nyeah yeah so so i think that's great and\nat the same time i still feel like it\nkind of comes back to this idea that\nit's not\ndependent on you it's dependent on the\noutside world\nright like if you're doing things to\nshow people\nthat they're wankers and that you've\nmade it and all those kids that bullied\nyou on school look at ali now like\nally's got\nbeautiful teeth beautiful nose beautiful\nhair beautiful [ __ ]\nyou know he's got he's got everything\nnow like who's making fun of who\nand and and sure i mean that can feel\ngood\nfor a while but generally speaking in my\nexperience\nhappiness that comes from the outside is\ntemporary and also depends\non the outside and that there's\nthere's another kind of happiness that\ncomes sort of from within\nfor lack of a better term and and i i\nthink that you've probably you've\nundoubtedly had this right like where\nit's it's not\ni mean i think that there are parts of\nyou that feel really good about\nyourselves because of the kind of dad\nthat you\nare but it's not because anyone is\nseeing like your daughter doesn't even\nknow\nwhat you're doing for her right there's\nno outside\nreinforcement or support of your esteem\nor worth\nit's something that like you wake up in\nthe morning and you say like okay she's\ngot a fever today so she can't\ni'm gonna be pissed about it but i'm not\ngonna get mad at her it's not her fault\nand she's never gonna know that she's\nnever gonna thank you for it\nno one's ever gonna say like oh like\nlook at ali he's such a good dad like he\nstayed home and canceled his stream\nin fact if anything you're you may get\nthe opposite where your\nyour viewers may be like upset your\ncommunity may be upset oh this guy's\nflaking again\nbut but like all that stuff even from\nthe outside you're gonna get\nno reinforcement and maybe even some\namount of flack\nor hatred or you know trolling or\nwhatever\nbut you can still feel good about\nyourself regardless of how the outside\nworld treats you\ni think that is better than the way you\nfeel\nbeing dependent on how the outside world\ntreats you\nand at the end of the day ali i hate to\nbreak it to you man but if you hadn't\ngotten a nose\njob i don't think i would think any less\nor more of you\ni think what makes you amazing is not\nyour nose\nright it's it's your like your drive to\nlike\nbe better and your ability to like roll\nwith punches\nbut but like the the the nose the nose\nchanges the way that you perceive\nyourself\nright\nman that's so nice of you oh man that's\nyou're so i really believe that you're\nlike\nan angel or something to speak words of\nwisdom to people honest to god\num i know what you're saying though and\nget it you're trying to say\nyou don't need all this because you can\nbe you're\nyou're loved on the inside alley you're\ntrying to say that but what if i told\nyou\nit's like venom the movie and spider-man\n3\nwhere eddie brock is like and he's like\neddie don't don't take the suit it's bad\nand he's like yeah i like being bad\nit feels good right now it feels good\nbeing this\noutside\nhere's here's the problem i completely\nagree with you that it feels amazing\nright now right so it's like a problem\nis this what we want to like step back a\nbit because you're going to get no so so\nhere's the thing\nif you if the reason you feel amazing\nright now is because your twitch career\nis going well because everything is\ngoing well you just bought a\ncar you're going to buy a house like\nlike if everything\nif your happiness is tied to the outside\nworld and what the faiths give you\nthen it's tied to what the faiths give\nyou\nright right and so what i'm asking you\nto do\nis consider a life where your happiness\nis not tied\nto what the fates give you but it's like\nlike buddhas do that don't know they\ndon't have any of that they just sit in\nthe mountains and they they just have\neach other\nso like that sort of that's like\nobviously live stream\nso i don't know go on yeah so\nokay my question is how am i meant to\nfind happy my question is how am i meant\nto find happiness\nwithout having goals and things to show\nfor in the real world\nyou tell me okay great so close your\neyes\nand if my daughter comes in the top of\npc just scream okay\nso ally\nwhat's wrong with you right now\ncan i respond yeah nothing\nokay then why do you need anything\nright right\nwell all i want to know is one answer\nfor you how can i be happy\nwill you tell you told me i can be happy\non the inside rather than the outside\nworld so you tell me how i could be\nhappy or how you'd demonstrate to anyone\nelse\nhow i'd be happy with the inside not the\noutside yeah yeah so so but what\nwhat do you what but so it there's\nnothing wrong with you right\nright shuffle like i still want about\nwhatever you prefer\nshe's coming okay okay okay yeah\nokay yeah go on so so yeah so but ali\nhere's the thing right so like like if\nyou think\nabout why you want something in the\noutside world\nthat comes from a desire within you\nright so is it outside the is the inside\nof me is the outside of me right\nabsolutely\nbrilliantly put right so like this is\nwhere so like right now you feel\nperfectly content and so so\nthen what's gonna happen is at some\npoint you're not gonna be content\nsomething within you is going to say i\nwant a house or i want a car\nright and then why can't i why can't i\nkeep just chasing that for the rest of\nmy life that's what gives people\nlike goals isn't it it's like they get\none goal fantastic feel great want the\nnext one but that's life we have to work\nhard and have goals am i wrong or\ni think you have to work hard but but i\ni don't i mean\nyeah goals so that gets tricky for a\nsecond but let me take a step back and\nask you\nuh we'll talk about that in a second but\nlet me just point this out so like right\nnow you're perfectly content you don't\nwant anything right\nbut one day and all the stuff but yeah\nbut so but how do you feel\nyou don't have a house so how do you\nfeel right now\nyeah incomplete okay where does that\nsound comfortable where does that\nfeeling of incompleteness come from\ni don't own a house yeah so so what what\nis that\nsecurity but no inside you\nally i know it's kind of a weird baby\nshark dude it's legit\nyeah um but what what is that feeling of\nincompleteness\nwhat does that feel like right so like\nyour knowledge that you don't have a\nhouse\nis represented inside you in some way\nright right so like if you imagine\nwalking into your house you're gonna\nfeel something on the inside\nwhen the first time you walk into a\nhouse you're going to feel something\nand until you do that there's like this\nemptiness inside you right\nthat's right okay so like yeah\nempty slash um the feeling of one\nuh the chase i won't call it empty it's\nlike uh\nwhat's that what's that yeah hunger yeah\nwhat is that\nyes yeah that's it it's that feeling\nit's like oh it's the chase it's like\nyeah yeah i'm gonna get that i want that\nyeah okay that gets my stream on every\nday that's why i'm a bit upset i didn't\nstream but go on\nokay yeah so so let's think about hunger\nfor a second right\nbecause there are times where you've had\nhunger for rice\nsure and yeah and what happens when you\ndon't give in to that hunger\nlike when you when you when you feel\nhungry for rice and you start eating it\nman do you feel good right and then the\nnext day how do you feel\nbut then if you eat more rice or you\nhave a cake oh man like there we go\nagain like i feel that hunger i want it\nagain\ni want it again i want it again i want\nit again oh what's the next thing\nthe next thing the next thing the hunger\nalways comes back that's true\nand the more you feed it what happens to\nyou\nyou get fake yeah right you start to\nfeel bad about yourself\nyeah yeah so sorry yeah so so how do you\nwhat are you doing oh no you're trying\nto say that when i get this house\nand i've got that hung i'm gonna be\nwanting the next thing\nand the next thing is that what you're\ntrying to say yeah\nyeah but let me say this doc who's\nlaughing when i own five six seven eight\nhouses\nand i'm a landlord and then my penance\nwho's laughing\nbecause you could put this like this\nisn't the same being a landlord's\ncompletely different to being\nhuge and overweight and feeling bad do\nyou understand what i'm saying yeah so\nso the only part that's huge and\noverweight and feeling bad is your ego\nwhen you're a landlord\nright your ego gets overblown then\nyou're like who's laughing now\nall y'all little [ __ ] and i'm a big\nman look at me\ni'm a ladler you're a [ __ ] tenant at\nthat point\nyour mind is obese your mind is 14 stone\nyour ego is 14 stone oh you think but\ndon't you think some people find that\nattractive\nof course some people find it as like\nwow i want to\nbe like this guy he's confident yes\nyou know what you you attract the wrong\naudience you attract the wrong type of\nwomen that are\ngold diggers and you check the wrong\nfront difference they're trying to\nexploit you and use you i completely\nknow where you're coming from but i'd\nrather\nbe that guy than be someone who's\nscraping by\nreally struggling living anxiety that he\ncan't cover his rent\nso you know yeah\ni agree i agree you should strive for\nstability\nso so you should absolutely strive for\nstability and i i think i think ali this\nis part of your journey right like you\nstarted off\nhis anxious got it getting banned from\ntwitch\nnowhere and now you've come out of it\nand then your next phase is to transcend\nthe entire thing to move like stop\nplaying the entire [ __ ] game because\nwhen you say like who's laughing that's\nego man\nlike why do you need to show all of\nthese women that tried to control you\nthat like you're doing fantastic\nthey're living their lives and like what\nwhy why do you want to show them\nlike what you're just going to cause and\npain because you're successful\nlet me tell you that there's something\ncalled flexing and yeah i know\nyou're you're not a type of gutter flex\nthere's no way you are you're really\nhumble and lovely\nand i'm glad you don't but there are\ntypes of people a lot of people out\nthere\nthat i don't care who's watching and\nwho's the thing if anybody out there\ncan flex it feels great it feels good it\nmakes you feel when lying effectively\nempowered and other people get inspired\nby that person flexing sometimes\nsure right yeah i completely agree with\nyou so let me ask you this\nwhen did you first want to flex oh my\ngod\num\n[Music]\nit was it's going to be really cringy\ndoc but it was when i got banned on\ntwitch i was depressed\ni didn't spend money i made a lot of\nmoney i didn't spend the money it's only\nwhen i got banned\ni started spending money got addicted to\nit and i bought this stupid car and i\nput a big spoiler on it\nand i thought it was so cool i thought\nit was really amazing i made this video\nand it was the most cringiest thing ever\nbut i got addicted to that feeling it\nwas a nice feeling you're damn right so\nso let's think about that ally you\nstarted flexing when you felt\nbad about yourself you know what your\nfirst flex was your first flex was way\nbefore you bought a car my friend\n[ __ ] you miss that was your first flex\nyou didn't have to be the nobody that\nyou were back in\nprimary school right yeah yeah yeah yeah\nyou could show\nup and boy did you flex you were like ah\nlook at me [ __ ] ally's in the house\nnow\ny'all best pay attention yep and\neveryone laughed and boy did it feel\ngood\ni\nthere's a video on youtube that i made\nit's no longer it's re-uploaded it had\nwhen i first released it got a million\nviews back in 20\nand here here i am here i'm not talking\nabout it but i made this video when i\nwas\num 13 and i'm now 28 so it's 15 years\nago on youtube i made this video and i'm\ngoing around the school\nand i'm just being a terror and it was\ncalled gross school goes to school and\ni'm just terrorizing\nthe libraries and kicking books down and\nscreaming\nyou know calling people names and it\nwent like viral on youtube it got like\nhalf a million views in a week and my\nheadmaster pulled me in to make remove\nthe video\nthere's a re-upload of it and um but\nyeah you're right you're right you're\nright\nyou're really right god about what\nhelp me understand the whole flexing\nthing about it's in it's who i am\nit started when it started when i was\nlike 10 11. not it didn't start when i\nbought the car yeah so the flex alley\nthe flex is to\ncompensate for an instructor penis\ndon't say penis please i'm not saying\npenis okay\ni swear that i swear it's i don't know\nwhat it is that\nno no no it's dude it's it's it's to\ncompensate for like caravan you\nbad teeth you shy you who got bullied\nthat's true right but here's the thing\nhere's the thing that's not the real you\nthat kid isn't the real you and if that\nkid isn't the real you then you have no\nneed to flex\nright if there's nothing wrong with you\nwhy do you need to show off or prove\nanything to anyone\nright\ndid you ask me a question no because\nit's all going in\nsort of you're right you're right you're\nright\n[Music]\nyou're not asking me to change you're\nnot you're not asking me about are you\njust making me understand right\nsure right do you want to change\nno not one bit i just i'm understanding\nmore about me okay because i've always\nliked this and you've helped me\nunderstand and i'm definitely\ncompensating for\nyeah the the old me like you said um but\ni don't want to go back to that\nguy i you know i love who i am now doc\ni'll be honest with you like\nyou know yeah so ali i don't think\nyou are truly what you are now\nand i don't think you're truly what you\nwere back then\nright i think you are what you are and\nthat there's nothing wrong with it so\nyou don't have to prove anything to\nanyone\nthey don't need to see they don't need\nto they don't need to see who you are\nbecause they'll never know who you are\nyou know like right now what does your\ndaughter think you are\nwell i hope she knows that i'm her dad\nwe did a dna test and she i am the dad\num\nbut um well she can't speak i mean i\nwould hope she thinks\nthat i'm a father yeah for sure yep\nright\nand that you love her and she thinks\nyou're awesome\nshe can't get we've been talking for an\nhour and a half and she can't get enough\nof you\nright right is that because you got a\nnose job\nno is it because of your teeth no\nis it because of your car\nis it because of how many followers you\nhave on twitch oh\nshe's faint how can she like you without\nany of those things\noh i see oh i see i see what you mean\noh okay right\nshe likes it for who i am i right\nyep okay but for a two and a half year\nold this is different to all the people\nnowadays it's if she's different to like\na 25 year old woman\ndude just just because people out there\nare [ __ ] dumber than a three-year-old\ndoes not mean you need to cater to them\nright i got you\nanimals and kids are the ones that see\nyour real value\nnot instagram models\nright so you can you can live up to\ntheir esteem if you want to\nso you're you're right ally i'm not\nasking you to change it's not my place\nto ask you to change\nit's my place to show you or try to help\nsee what i think you are and in theory\nmaybe that's what you really are\nand then you should decide right if you\nwant to continue chasing materialistic\nthings go for it\nif you want to continue flexing on\npeople go for it but this is what i will\ntell you and what i have observed\nis that the more your happiness is\ndependent on\nother people's opinion the less in\ncontrol of your happiness you\nare that makes sense\nso it's like playing with fire is what\nyou're trying to say absolutely\nso if i loved myself and who i really am\nand like early like we're talking about\nanimals\nthey love who you are that's i'm not\nplaying with fire then that's like a\nsafe thing to do\nright i i i safe absolutely i mean i\nthink that's where real happiness comes\nfrom\nsustainable happiness like you think\nabout how does your daughter feel about\nherself\nand why does she feel that way it's\nbecause you see something within her\nwhy does she love you so much it's\nbecause you probably don't\ntreat her based on what she does on the\noutside gotcha\nright her mom probably treats her\ndifferently whereas like you treat her\nlike a person\nnot like any one facet\nof her being you just don't pick one\nside\nyou treat her as a person\nand my guess is that like and it's not\nyour fault or anything i think this is\nwhat happens\nwhen kids get made fun of and when you\ngrow up where like you grow up in a\ncaravan and other people have houses\nyou they make you feel like less of a\nhuman being\nand what i'm telling you to do is stop\nplaying their [ __ ] game\nall right because whether you have a\nhouse or whether you have a caravan\nshe's gonna see the same person does she\nknow that you guys have like a mansion\nor an apartment or a caravan right now\nshe doesn't know and she doesn't care\nyeah it doesn't care what color your\nhair is\ni don't want to say doc okay\ni'm just taking it in sorry no no it's\ngood\ni mean no it's nice hearing it though\nit's you're right\nit's not hearing it um what happens\nthough when she grows up and\num she hasn't got nice things\nright and then people at school make fun\nof her excellent\nnow we get to the important point this\nis why you need to so\nyeah so allie this is beautiful you took\nthe next point i i was made fun of in\nschool if i had a big nose and living in\na caravan\nand people would call me all names like\nyep you know what i mean\nso why would i want uh that's i do a lot\nof it for her i say this all the time\nbut i do\nwant her to have the best things so i'm\nthe cool dad when i and i i don't sound\nweird here but\nwhen she goes to school and she has uh\nit's her birthday\nall her friends can come stay in a big\nhouse and have a party which i never had\ndid i mean i don't i'd rather have that\nlife rather than of life where because i\nnever had a birthday party\ni never had loads of friends over i\ndidn't get that luxury\nyou know i mean i've already got a\nsleepover and if so it was weird\nbut um and that's it so i want i want\nher to have nice things\ni don't want to get bullied\nso so ali i can get behind that 100\nbecause let me explain something to you\nthough so why should you work hard\nworking hard to flex on noobs is one\nthing\nfor family but i do want to dismiss that\ni do everything i do do\nis for my daughter as well it's just a\nadditional it's also\nfor ellie it's also for\nyeah i'm doing all right yeah so so so\ni i think when you work hard you do so\nfor two children\nyou do so for ellie\nand then you do so for 10 year old you\nright\nand so what i'm saying is one of those\nis going to be temporary\nand you're going to feel like you're\ngoing to go back to feeling the second\nyou buy a nice car\nand then someone that you dislike buys a\nnicer car you're gonna go back to\nfeeling like that 10 year old kid\nbut should you work your ass off should\nyou stream every day should you try to\nbe bigger and better and more secure\nshould you become a landlord instead of\na tenant and have control over your own\ndestiny\nabsolutely it's the why that's important\nare you doing it to make other people\nsee how big your dick is are you doing\nit for your daughter\nyeah i i got you i i asked me that\nbecause\nyou know i mean i think you're yeah yeah\nyeah and i think i think\nboth of them exist within you right now\nthat's okay it's just over the next\ncouple of years\nyou've got to decide whether you want to\nchase temporary happiness because you're\ndamn right it feels good that's why\neveryone chases it like why do you think\neveryone's doing this\nwhy do you think instagram exists it's\nbecause temporary highs are very\naddictive and so easy to attain\nit's way harder to sit with that hunger\nand conquer it and not give in because\nit's so satisfying\nwhen you get that bowl of white rice and\nyou just start shoving it in your face\nman does it feel so good for that hunger\nbut then the hunger comes back tomorrow\nyeah and then a jaguar and then a home\nbut why do you want a home\nis it because you want to flex or\nbecause you don't you want to be able to\nhave a party for everybody\ni've got a massive thing and this is\ngetting a bit to know me when i was a\nkid and i was growing up\nmy dad walked there my my mom split with\nhim when\nshe was six and one second\nsorry my friends listen to the stream\nand i can hear myself talking i hate my\nown voice\nso pretty much when i was a um when i\nwas a kid i um\nmy dad weren't there and they they he\nset my mom's car on fire they broke up\nright it's drugs and all that crap and\nuh pretty much what happened was\nuh um my mom met this fella\nafter a few years of dating a few guys\nand um he's very old-fashioned\nand the day that i left school i was a\nvery quiet kid\nat my family at the caravan at home at\nschool i was a terror\nso much so that my mum would get reports\nthat i was really loud in class and she\nwouldn't believe it\nshe we turned up to a parent's evening\nand the teachers were like ali's loud he\nswears a lot and\nshe's like not my alley what this ally\nand i would sit there like\nyou know so the day that i left school i\ndid really bad i didn't pass any of my\ngrades i came\ninto school i was meant to get a's and\nb's\nbecause i took this dark side of being\nimmature and flexing with\num this loud mouth potty mouth kid i\nleft with\nall bad grades the day that i finished\nschool\nmy i felt it coming for years my\nstepfather\nthe day that i left school when i was 16\nthe day that happened\nhe was like get out go and we got into a\nmassive fight\nand my mom and me got a like a bit she\nshe punched me in the nose\nshe she denies it to this day she's like\ni didn't i was like yep i had a\nnosebleed you punched me in the face\nshe she's like live it if i when i tell\nher that she doesn't want to hear\nshe just says no no no so i got kicked\nout when i was 16.\ni always got kicked out when i was 14\nbut i went and stayed around a friend's\nhouse and still to this day\nyou no one on this stream knows knows\nwhat it's like to live with someone and\nif you do you do but\nyou have no idea what it's like to maybe\nyou do doc\nto live with someone and be dependent on\nthem to keep you there it\ni lived growing up for my teenage years\nin anxiety that my stepfather's gonna\nkick me out and i was so scared of him\nwe never talked we never interacted all\ni want to do is sit down and play\nrunescape\nand that and make youtube videos and\nthat guy terrified me\nthat still to this day i my worst fear\never\nis not being able to pay my rent\nthat's why every time i get a girlfriend\ni get i'm like i'm paying all the rent\ni'm paying all the bills i'm paying\neverything everything's on me i won't\nlet you spend a penny because i don't\nwant anyone to feel that anxiety which i\nfelt\ngrowing up i hate no one there might be\nsomeone watching this stream like a\n16 year old who's doesn't know what's\ngoing to do with leave school it's the\nworst\nfeeling in the world living with someone\nand being scared they're going to kick\nyou out\nbecause it's just the worst feeling in\nthe world and now i had that i used to\nclean up\nbe really polite was quite quiet and\nscared\nand still just to have that anxiety\nthat's why now i want to buy\na house if not houses and i want to own\nso it's like a\nsecurity like hey i'm never gonna if if\nif if [ __ ] hits the fan i'm okay because\ni bought these houses and i could sell\nthem and live off that for a while\nand that's it doc so that is so it's not\nso much the reason i want to buy a house\nis number one\nyes it's my dual size well number two\nit's it feel makes you feel good i\nown a house but number three mostly it's\nsecurity\ndo you understand it's that i have this\nliving anxiety i'm so scared that's why\nnow i the past three years i haven't\nstreamed i've just been living anxiety\nbecause i was too scared to stream with\nmy fan base\nbut now all i want to do is stream every\nday i would stream 30 days\na week a month if i could but with with\nmy daughter i can't but um either way\nthat's the truth so\nthat it you know that anxiety is still\nthere and\nall my last girlfriend i let her live\nhere\nand the problem with me we're human\nbeings\nwe can find negatives in the most\npositive thing for example\ni did not pay anything i paid her car\ninsurance i paid all for\nall her food her clothes you name it\nit's all on me the past three years\ni did that so much i paid every bill i\npaid everything\nthat in her brain i starved her\nfrom being her own woman when she left\nme she was like i want to leave i want\nmy own place i want to pay my own bills\ni want to be independent\ni gave her so i didn't let her pay\nanything that i stopped her from let's\nsay independency she could go out\nshe could go out i'm not keeping her\nindoors she was allowed to go out she\ncould she was free as a bird\nbut because i paid all the bills her\nbrain taught is a negative because us\nhuman beings will find a negative\nlook at millionaires look at\nmillionaires they they\nstill hate their lives some of them\nbecause they just see negatives and\nall their friends are afraid all their\nfriends are fake and\nand they're you know and it's not enough\nyou know\nso pretty much i made a mistake with my\nex-girlfriend i\ni i pretty much started from\nindependence about paying all the bills\nbecause i didn't want\nher to live my ex i didn't want to feel\nthe same way i did when i was\num when i was a kid of the anxiety i'm\ngoing to get thrown out get kicked out\noh my god it was the worst feeling in\nthe world worst feeling in the world and\nthat's that's so that's\none of the reasons why i want to buy a\nhouse so it's like\nyeah and i want to keep on going until i\nfeel really secure\nit ain't gonna stop streaming all the\ntime every day\nbut yeah that's it so now you know a bit\nmore it's it\nsheds a lot of light ally thank you so\nmuch for sharing\nright\nis she insecure but my daughter\nyeah we don't we not not at all she's\nnot scared of anyone\nshe doesn't play her by the children she\nloves she prefers adults when she goes\nto her school\ndoes it she she i can have\n10 strangers turn up women men she won't\ncare she'll walk in the room she doesn't\ncare she act like they're invisible\nlegit invisible where does that security\ncome from\nwhat her security yeah i don't know\na lot of her kids her age are really shy\nshe hasn't she's the opposite yep she\njust\nyep ellie where does security come from\nit's you're born that way right\nno right or no no where does your\ninsecurity come from\nwhich one the one with me want to buy\nstuff or the one where i want the\nattention like or the one where i'm\ntake your pick good good answer right\nokay so your insecurities come from\nexperiences\nyour desire to have a house in security\ncomes from this\ntraumatic fear of being kicked out when\nyou were 16. that's where the\ninsecurities born\nright the interesting thing is that\ncookies i'm listening i'm listening i'm\nlistening right cookies is the full\ncookie man\ni'm gonna make a dinner shortly go on\ncarry on doc i'm listening yeah\nno i'm just appreciating her\ni'm always i'm all yeah so so my point\nuh goren\nand maybe we can\nwrap up in a few minutes but just to\nthink about this is like so you're\ntrying to solve the insecurity of\nyesterday by like buying a house today\ni'm not saying you shouldn't get a house\nabsolutely you should provide\nsecurity but what i'm saying is that the\ninteresting thing is that\nher security doesn't come from solving\nan insecurity it comes from like\nfaith in herself and comfort because\nlike that's what you've given her\nright like she knows her value as a\nhuman being because you treat her with\nvalue and what i'm saying is that the\nsolution to your\ninsecurity sure a house will help\nbut that emotional scar like has to be\ndealt with directly\nright so like it's about sitting with\nsome of the feelings that you have in\nacknowledging\nthat you have this like traumatic event\nabout like being kicked out\nbut like appeasing the anxiety from the\noutside doesn't actually do\nanything to the insecurity like just\nlike when you get a nose job a little\nwhile later you're going to be worried\nabout your teeth a little while later\nyou're going to be worried about your\nhair\nthere's something with the insecurity\nexists and fixing it from the outside\nisn't going to do anything to the\ninsecurity on the inside\nand so i know it's kind of a weird\nquestion but you need to do for yourself\nwhat you've done for your daughter and\nthen the insecurity will be gone\nright right i've self-consciously done\nthat she's very\nshe's not insecure at all so tell me\nexactly what i got to do\ntreat yourself the way that you treat\nher pay attention the next time she\ndoesn't because she's gonna feel\ninsecure all the time\nright so i know it's she's a secure kid\nbut they're gonna be little moments like\njust now\nright so that she has a need and like\nhow did you deal with her just like pay\nattention to your interactions with her\nbecause something about the way that you\ninteract with her has made her a secure\nchild\nand i'm not sure exactly what that looks\nlike but i think you just got to look at\nthe way you treat her and look at the\nway you treat yourself\nlook at the things within yourself that\nprompt you to action\nand look at the things within you that\nprompt you to action for her\nand they're very different\nwith her you have a fundamental idea\nthat she's okay\nand so all of your interactions with her\nare built on a foundation\nof this kid is awesome when it comes to\nyourself\nthe foundation is very different because\nyou weren't treated like you were okay\nright growing up you had this stepdad\nwho you [ __ ] knew\nhe was looking for an excuse\nhe was just looking for an excuse\nand your daughter\n[Music]\nhas that's just alien to the way that\nshe's growing up\nshe has no idea what it was like\nbut that's where security comes from\nfate or god or the universe\nhas given you a perfect example from how\nto move forward to hear and she's in\nyour own home and she's three years old\ndo for yourself what you do for her\nand whether you get a house or don't get\na house whether it's a big house or a\nlittle house\nwhether you look beautiful or you look\nugly it won't matter\ngot it dog will do\nhow you feeling good good\njust happy good\njust good just um\nyeah feeling good good good i'm happy to\nhear it yeah\ni'll leave you yeah yeah go on yeah i'll\nleave you with one last thought ally and\nthen you can have the last word\nso the only thing that i feel sad about\nis that you chase something that you\ndon't need\nright that you're fine the way you are\nand all of your insecurities are\nfalsehoods\nthat were instilled in you by people who\ndidn't treat you the way that you should\nhave been treated\nright yeah that makes sense it's their\nestimation\nin their eyes you're lacking and then\nyou learned how to look at yourself in\nthe mirror\nand see what they saw but those [ __ ]\nare wrong man\nand so\nlook at yourself the way that you look\nat your daughter\nlast word is yours my friend\nthe last word is mine yeah yeah if you\nwant to say something\nlast word uh no i just want to say\nthanks for\nhaving me on and it's uh just\nso good to uh have someone\njump in my brain like that it was like i\nwasn't expecting now i was like man\nthere's nothing you're gonna tell me\nthat
