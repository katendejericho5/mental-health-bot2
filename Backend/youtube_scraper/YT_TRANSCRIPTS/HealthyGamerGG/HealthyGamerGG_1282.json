    "transcript": "i want to talk to you guys a little bit\nabout our coaching program\nand mental health in general and like\nwhat's going on with the world\nand what's going on with us why are we\nsad why are we stuck\nwhy are we depressed why are we lonely\nall this stuff we're just going to talk\nabout it for a few minutes\nand just think a little bit about what\nhealthy gamer does as an organization\nso first thing to consider is that\nmental health is getting worse\nall over the world it's now surpassed\ncardiovascular disease\nand cancer in terms of causing the most\nmorbidity and mortality\nwhich means that the cost of mental\nhealth in terms of like lost work days\nand\nimpairing like people's education and\nstuff like that\nas well as mortality is now worse than\ncancer and cardiovascular disease\nso like what's going on there right why\nis like why is mental health getting\nworse like isn't the world getting\nbetter like aren't we like advancing as\nsociety and\nsure in some ways but why is that\nso mental health is getting worse right\nnow and what our society does to deal\nwith that is essentially like\npsychiatric treatment right\nso if you have a mental illness then you\nshould go see a psychiatrist or\ntherapist and then they'll help\nyou with that and that's certainly true\nand i'm a psychiatrist so i'm a big\nbeliever in psychiatric treatment\nbut i think part of the problem is that\nsomewhere along the way\nmental stress became like illness and\nwhat i mean by that is that if we think\nabout like depression right\nso an illness is something that when\nyou're like body or brain\ndoes something that it's not supposed to\nthat's ill\nso it's like a malfunction of your mind\nor your brain\nand sometimes something like depression\ncan be caused by a malfunction\nsometimes what happens is when when\npeople feel like\nlost or they feel depressed or they feel\nstuck\nit's not like a malfunction it's not\nlike their life is actually going\nwonderful\nand something in their brain tells them\nthat they're awful human beings\nthat's what real clinical illness looks\nlike it's like\nif you think about someone like\nschizophrenia for example you know\nthere isn't a whole lot of evidence that\nthe devil is possessing the people\naround them but that's what they believe\nit's like their mind is not congruent\nwith with reality\nthe challenge that we face nowadays is\nthat\na lot of our depression is actually\ncongruent with reality\nespecially if you look at like gen z and\nmillennials like the world that we live\nin\nand the reality that we face is actually\ndepressing\nif you're 23 years old and like\nstruggling to find a job\nand feel alone and like don't know what\nto do with yourself\nand don't know like where to go\nhow to put your life together how to\nfind motivation\nthat's not an illness like there isn't\nsome part of your brain that's like\nmalfunctioning that's just\nthat's life and so this is the problem\nright is because then like you have a\ngeneration of people like us who get\ntold oh like you're mentally ill\nso go see a psychiatrist or therapist\nand then you go see a psychiatrist and\ntherapist\nand they diagnose you with depression\nthey start you on a on a pill and they\nsend you home and then you like play\nvideo games all day\nbrowse reddit watch youtube whatever\nlike it doesn't\nand the pill doesn't fix your life\nbecause that's not\nwhat it does and so the first issue is\nthat like sure mental health is getting\nworse in this country and like\npsychiatrists and therapists\nare not cutting yet that's been my\nexperience as a psychiatrist\nso let's just think about so the average\nage of a psychiatrist is older than 50\nyears old\nright so if you go to them and you say\nyeah like\nyou know you're talking to them about\nlike twitch like they're not gonna\nunderstand what you're talking about\nthe second thing is that sometimes it\ncan take months like two months three\nmonths four months to see a psychiatrist\nor therapist\nit can be quite expensive so therapists\nwill cost\nanywhere from like a hundred to four\nhundred dollars per session\npsychiatrists will charge anywhere\nbetween like\n200 for a 30 minute appointment up to\nlike\n400 or 500 at least in the united states\nyou know they don't understand gaming\nthey don't understand social media they\ndon't understand like fomo and things\nlike that right they're going to\ndiagnose you with edible complexes and\ndepression\npsychiatry is too old too slow\nand too effective ineffective\nit just doesn't work well it's just it's\njust not doesn't work great\nand so this is why we started our\ncoaching program\nbecause a lot of what you guys struggle\nwith is not\nillness but is like actually congruent\nwith reality\nthat you don't know what you're doing\nwith your life you don't know what your\npurpose is you don't know how to get\ncontrol of your life you play too many\nvideo games\nyou struggle with depression you\nstruggle with anxiety etc right that's\nthat's why we started the coaching\nprogram to help you with all of those\nthings\nbecause the story that i heard time and\ntime and time again\nso when i started when i appeared on the\ninternet in a while dr k appeared\ni would tell people hey man like you\nshould go see a therapist bro like they\ncan help you with the depression men\nand then what i the the story that i got\nback was i did go see a therapist\nand i spent like two weeks talking to\nthem and they had no clue what was going\non\nlike with me like they didn't understand\nanything\nthey were like just stop playing just\nlike play video games less bro\nthat's that's what they got right so a\nlot of psychiatric treatment just hasn't\nbeen affected\nthis is actually known in the\npsychiatric literature so i'm going to\nshow you guys something okay\nso the journal of the american medical\nassociation antidepressant drug effects\nand depression severity\na patient-level meta-analysis here's the\nmain thing that i want to show you guys\nokay\nso this is a good paper published in a\nreputable journal\nokay among so this is a scale\nthis is a depression scale the hamilton\nd\ndepression scale cohen d effect sizes\nfor the difference between medication\nand placebo were estimated to be less\nthan 20\nwhat this means is that antidepressant\nmedication\nhas a less than 20 percent improvement\ncompared to placebo so like the effect\nsize of antidepressant medication\nis less than 20 in this meta-analysis\ndone in the journal of the american\nmedical association\nokay estimates of the magnitude of\nsuperior superiority\nof medication over placebo increased\nwith increases in baseline depression\nseverity\nso what that means is that the more\ndepressed you are\nthe more medication helps but on average\nit's a it's a less than 20\nimprovement and let's think about why\nthis would be\nand i think the reason for this is\nbecause when people go to\na psychiatrist when they're depressed\nnot all of them are mentally ill\nso the pill works if you have a\nneurochemistry imbalance but a lot of\npeople just have\nlike a congruent depression it's like a\ndepression that\nfits with what's going on with your life\nright now you should be depressed you're\nnot mentally ill\nyour life is just going nowhere so\nthat's why you're bummed man so let's\nlook\nat another paper okay so this is the new\nengland journal of medicine\nthe most reputable medical journal in\nthe world\nso what this paper is talking about is\nthe idea that antidepressants are like\nnot as effective as\nas we think they are so what this means\nis that if you look at\naccording to the published literature so\nstudies on antidepressants\nit appeared that 91 94\nof trials were positive so if you look\nat all of the studies on antidepressant\nmedication 94\nof them are positive but if you look at\nfda analysis\nso this is all of the data that was\nsubmitted to the fda\nthat not necessarily published you know\nso like if a drug company does a trial\nthey have to submit their data to the\nfda\nbut they don't have to publish it fda\nanalysis only 51 percent of trials are\npositive and so if you look at the\neffect size of antidepressant medication\nwas anywhere between 11 and 69\n11 to 69 for drugs and 32\noverall so one study tells us that\nantidepressant medication is less than\n20\nimprovement the this study shows us that\ngenerally speaking antidepressant is 32\nimprovement so it's like 20 to 30\npercent and why is that it's because\nlots of depressed or sad people are\ngoing to see psychiatrists and they're\nbeing given pills and the pill doesn't\nfix it because not everyone has a\nneurochemistry imbalance\nso psychiatry is like we're struggling\nwe're failing you guys are going to\npsychiatric offices\nand then they're giving everyone\nmedications not everyone but a lot of\npsychiatrists\nare primarily what we call\npsychopharmacologists so they see\npatients for 15 to 20 minutes\nper visit they'll see three to four\npatients per hour and they primarily\nprescribe medication\nand the improvement that they're giving\npeople is 20 to 32\nso something is not working right the\nsystem is not working\nthe best that we have to offer and this\nis me too like i'm [ __ ]\nfaculty at harvard medical school and\nlike when i prescribe an antidepressant\nmedication\nit's not like my numbers are better my\nnumbers are still 20 to 30\nthat's just how it is so like what's\nwrong\nso this is cool so somewhere along the\nway what someone realized is that like\nokay if someone has a problem you can\ntake a well-trained psychiatrist who has\nnever\nlived a day in the life of that person\nand try to give them like\nexpert knowledge but if you really want\nto help people\nit turns out that people who have actual\nexperience are actually effective at\nhelping people so this is where peer\ndelivered recovery support services come\nin\nso on one end of the spectrum we have\npsychiatrists\nso these are like highly trained\nindividuals\nthat have never really experienced\naddiction\nand on the other hand of the spectrum we\nhave aaa sponsors like alcoholics\nanonymous sponsors\nwho have lived it with addiction their\nentire life but have no formal training\nand so what happened is someone had this\nlike brilliant idea like what if we take\naaa sponsors\nand we start training them we give them\nsomething like a training of what a\npsychiatrist has\nand a peer delivered a peer support\nspecialist was born\nand it turns out that this is an\neffective and\nand cost effective and treatment size\neffective intervention that if you take\nsomeone who's lived with something like\nvideo game addiction or alcohol\naddiction\nand you put them through training and\nyou equip them to help another human\nbeing\na combination of their personal\nexperience plus formal training is\nactually very effective\nso there are a lot of methodological\nlimitations so this study is from 2015\nso there's more data on this\nnow the body of evidence suggests\nsalutatory effects on\nparticipants there are better papers\nthat sort of suggest that\npeer support interventions work so this\nis where our coaching program was born\nso it was born from a couple of ideas\nthe first is that\nwhat holds us back in life and why we\nfeel\ndepressed or anxious isn't necessarily a\nmedical illness and doesn't necessarily\nneed a medical intervention right so\nwhat our coaches target is like how do\nyou find\nmotivation how do you stop\nprocrastinating how do you overcome\nlike feelings of like game uh guilt or\nshame\nright how do you stop playing video\ngames how do you understand yourself\nbetter so that you can play the game of\nlife better\nthat's what our coaching program is for\nthat's why it was built\nit's because mental health is too old\ntoo slow\ntoo expensive and also mis-targeted\nso our coaching program was developed\nspecifically because what i realized is\nlike\nwhat we need is like an army of peer\nsupport specialists we need an army of\npeople who understand what you've been\nthrough\nand then they need to learn like a\ndistillation\nof the best of what like psychotherapy\ntechniques and motivational interviewing\nand a couple of these other\nevidence-based interventions and if we\ncan put those two things together\ncan they help so now what i'd like to do\nis answer that question for you guys\nso here is data from our coaching\nprogram here\nis the change\nin purpose and meaning after\nfour weeks of group coaching so this is\ngroup coaching personal coaching free\ncoaching\nokay so after four weeks people have a\n12\nincrease in a sense of purpose and\nmeaning after one month of group\ncoaching 14\nincrease after eight weeks and 20\nincrease\nin purpose and meaning after 12 weeks of\ngroup coaching\ntheir sense of control over their life\nincreases by about nine percent\nthe negative effects of video games go\ndown by about eleven percent\nthe positive effects of video games go\ndown by about one percent\nthey have a 15 reduction in anxiety and\na 17\nreduction in depression after 12 weeks\nof group coaching so like\nremember what's the effect size of\nantidepressant medication on depression\ndo you guys remember\nso personal coaching so this is\ninteresting right\nso if we look at eight weeks of group\ncoaching\nand eight weeks of personal coaching we\nsee that personal coaching\nhas a 20 improvement in meaning after\neight weeks\nso these people get more than a six\npercent versus seven percent\nagency or control negative effects of\nvideo games ten percent versus fourteen\npercent\nand this is pretty cool like they\nactually enjoy video games more at the\neight week mark\nthe positive effects of video games are\nactually improved which is something\nthat\nreally no one else looks at besides us\nbecause the rest of the world just\nthinks about video game addiction\ner video games bad what i've come to\nrealize is that video games have\npositive\ngood things and bad things about video\ngames 17 reduction in anxiety 17\nreduction in depression now if you\ncompare the 12-week mark\nright so group coaching catches up and\nthen theoretically even like\npersonal coaching drops down a little\nbit\num at the 12-week mark we're not really\nsure why that is\ni think some of this may be sampling\nbias which i can get into details but\nbut generally speaking group coaching\ncatches up to personal coaching at 12\nweeks\nand the other thing is i don't know if\nyou guys know this but about a third of\nour coaching hours\nare free coaching so we also looked at\nfree coaching\nso this is pretty interesting right so\nif you look at free coaching is personal\nby the way\nso our free coaching cohort actually\nimproves more than our paid coaching\ncohort\nso like the question that we wondered is\nlike is our free coaching\nlower quality than our personal coaching\nand it turns out that the answer\nis no in theory it's maybe even superior\ni don't i think there's some issues with\nthis data but\ngenerally speaking it means that if\nyou're if you're a free coaching client\nyou're not getting the shaft\nokay so don't worry about it the point\nhere though is that if you look at these\neffect sizes like i mean all these like\nnumbers 19\nversus 18 you know 19 here 14\nhere whatever the ballpark is that like\nit's about 20\nright like like there's about a 20\nreduction\n15 18 reduction 18\nreduction 20 reduction like it's\nsomewhere around 20\nso our our coaching program works so\npeople were wondering okay how do we\nmeasure this so here's an example\nof like the kinds of data we collect so\nwhen we're trying to assess for\npurpose or meaning we ask people does\nyour life\nlack direction my life that lacks\ndirection my life has purpose i'm\nexcited to get out of bed in the morning\ni have forward momentum in life i feel\nstuck in life so like\nthese are the things that get 20 percent\nbetter after eight weeks\nand when you guys are thinking about\nlike 20 so i i know that\nyou know we make it sound like 20 isn't\nvery big but let me tell you as a\nclinician a 20\nimprovement in depression is huge right\nso just think about this like what if\nyou\nyou know you're you weighed 20 less\nor 20 more than you do what if you were\n20 taller or 20\nshorter 20 is a big difference and\nespecially when it comes to something\nlike depression because\nall it takes is like you to start moving\nin the right direction for you to start\ntaking care of yourself better\nso there's like a cumulative a 20\nimprovement\nin meaning from week to week even if\nit's a 20\nincrease if you have more meaning in\nyour life when you wake up if you're\nexcited to\nif you're 20 more excited to get out of\nbed every morning\nthat's going to be an effect that will\nbuild up over the course of a year\nand your life will start to change so\ntwenty percent\ni'm happy with these are the kinds of\nthings so like this is like closer to a\nten percent improvement right\ni'm too dis undisciplined to make\nmeaningful change\nunfortunately we only help that by about\nten percent we're working on that by the\nway we're working on improving our\nintervention to help with this\nright so this is the kind of data that\nwe collect so this is why we do coaching\nand this is why we did this like we\nstarted this whole thing because\nbecause you all need help and is a\nsociety\nmy profession and myself included or\nfailing you guys\npsychiatry is failing y'all and that's\nwhy we started this you know\nthis coaching program was built\non your support and so i i felt like it\nwas important to share with you guys\nwhy we're doing what we're doing what\nwe're doing and\nwhat the data looks like and and i hope\nyou guys it's kind of funny right\nbecause\ni mean we showed you the data like i\ndidn't sugarcoat anything like that's\nthe actual data and so there\nare weird things in the data like\npersonal coaching like\nyou know purpose drops by one percent\nfrom week eight to week 12. so like we\ndon't know what's going on there\ni i don't really know um but that's the\nactual data and i think our program is\nsuccessful and people\nyou know people are grateful for having\nworked with a coach like their life\nis starting to transform because of the\nwork that they do with their coach\nand our coaches are highly dedicated\npeople\nreally smart because that's the thing\nlike we pull from our population right\nso like gamers are smart\nyou give them like someone to help and\nyou say like hey\nif you show up one hour a week and you\ngive\neverything all of your attention all of\nyour compassion and all of your\nintelligence\nto one person you can make a difference\nin their life\nand our coaches wake up every day and\nthey like they knock it out of the park\nand what they do is these are these are\nnoobs from the internet with a few\nmonths of training\nhave effect sizes that are arguably\ncomparable\nto the breakthrough drugs of like\nbig pharma right and it's like noobs\nfrom the internet and it's because they\ncare and it's because they try\nand it's because the kind of help that\nwe deliver\nis actually design it's coaching it's\nnot medical treatment\nit's not designed to treat depression\nit's designed to like\nhelp you move forward in life because\nsometimes you guys may be depressed but\nthat doesn't mean you're mentally ill it\njust means that\nyour life is like not that great right\nnow\nso make it worth living and that's what\nour coaches are there to help you do\nthey're there to help you understand how\nyou work\nand so once you understand how you work\nyou can play the game of life\nin the way that you want it's about\napplying\nself understanding to building the life\nthat you want to\nand that's what we're doing and so thank\nyou guys very much"
