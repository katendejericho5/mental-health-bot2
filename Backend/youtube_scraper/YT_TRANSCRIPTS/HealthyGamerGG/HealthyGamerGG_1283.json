    "transcript": "so today we're going to talk about\nloneliness\nwith um one of our viewers so someone\nfrom our community\nuh is going to come on and we're going\nto just talk a little bit about\nloneliness\nif you guys are suffering from\nloneliness or being stuck for a video\ngame\naddiction or motivation or other issues\nthat are kind of keeping you\nfrom moving forward in life unable to\nfind your purpose things like that\ngo ahead and check out our coaching\nprogram\nand you know i think group coaching is a\ngreat way to sort of address\nloneliness and sort of meet other people\none thing to know about\ngroup coaching is it's not really about\nmaking friends it's about sort of\nforming really authentic bonds with\npeople\nthat you guys can like work on your\nissues with um work through your\nchallenges kind of together\nbut if you guys are looking to party up\nand and work on being stuck in life\ndefinitely check out the coaching\nprogram\nhey man thanks for coming on\nno worries man so and what am i calling\nyou\nuh you can call me nicholas or nick\nwhatever you prefer\nokay so nicholas\num and so tell\nso we're talking about loneliness today\num yeah well mostly uh emotional\nloneliness not like a physical point\nof view okay so let's start there what's\nthe difference between physical\nloneliness and emotional loneliness\num well to me it's um\nwell you can have friends physically and\nhang out with them but you can still not\nfeel the\nconnection always so then you\nemotionally feel lonely because you\ndon't have anyone to maybe\ntalk to and really lit up with if that\nmakes sense to you\nso yeah okay you get emotionally\nisolated at that point\nis what i feel like okay so can you tell\nus what that feels like\num to me it feels a lot like\nuh well you feel lonely of course you\nfeel like\nyou can't rely on anyone and you don't\nreally feel understood\non a lot of points as a person so you\nfeel\nlonely and like you can't be understood\nyes that's part of it um it's a lot to\ndo with the fact that\nyou don't yeah it's mainly just like\nbeing understood by people on a on an\nemotional level like on a deeper level\ni guess you could say so so you it's it\nsounds like you actually have kind of\npeople around you you have friends but\nyou feel misunderstood\ndefinitely i don't i don't feel like um\nlike really really close with an\nexception of like a few people\nbut i have a lot of friends that i don't\nhave like an actual connection with\nif that makes sense okay so it's like i\ndon't feel like i can\nrely on a lot of them on a deeper level\nokay but it sounds like you do have a\nfew people that you sort of\nrely on or can rely on on a deeper level\nyeah more or less i don't really i don't\nreally talk to them\non a deeper level level a lot um\na lot of it is me myself in my own room\nfeeling myself being lonely if that\nmakes sense\num and then um to kind of explain it\nbetter it has like two parts of it\nit has the part where i feel like i\ncan't connect with a lot of people but i\nalso have like\ni don't wanna call it anxiety but i\nwanna i'm like scared right\nso i'm scared of being alone later in\nlife or being like\nforever alone if that makes sense\nso it's like those sure combinations so\nso\nyou're scared of being alone and what's\nthe second piece\num no the first piece is that i'm\ncurrently feeling like\nemotionally alone um which i tried to\nexplain earlier\nyeah and then the second piece is kind\nof me being scared for the future\nthat i won't have people uh to be with\nboth like plasonically and romantically\nokay um have you been in a romantic\nrelationship before\nyep that's been around four years ago\nokay and do you mind if i ask how old\nyou are\nyeah i'm 20. you're 20. okay yeah\nand how long have you been feeling\nemotionally lonely\nfor around three years maybe\nokay and do you remember what you felt\nlike in your late teens like what\nwhat changed um\nwell now it's something i have accepted\nit's like a part of me now so it's not\nsomething\ni'm bothering to bother too much by um\nbut you've accepted that you're gonna be\nlonely\nno i'm accepted it's the feeling i have\nuh okay so like you know yeah yeah\nso basically during high school i\nuh i was bought bothered a lot by the\nfact that i felt lonely and that\nmy peers seemed way more popular than me\nin all aspects\num which gave me insecurities and then\ni went to a therapist like school\ntherapist\nand she kind of changed my outlook and\nstuff by saying it's all about the\nattitude when you go to like parties etc\nright\num so she tried to instill in me that\nif you come in with a good attitude\ncompared to the bad one\nyou'll have more success in finding\nfriends and so on\num which you know did work in finding\nfriends but it doesn't really work for\nme\non an emotional level if that makes\nsense sure so\nfeeling it yeah interesting\ncan i think for a second nicholas sure\nokay give me just another second okay\nyeah no worries it's a good thing let me\nask you something did your feeling of\nemotional loneliness get worse\nthe better you got at changing your\nattitude\nthe um what i call anxiety or whatever\nit is\ngot worse so whenever i had um\nan episode of feeling extra lonely and\nstarted spiraling in my thoughts\nthat would get worse a lot worse\nbasically what would get a lot worse\num the amount of times i would\nfeel like the feelings and the thoughts\nwould come up uh came more often than it\nwould\nlike be there for longer like the\nepisode and so that\nthat happened more the more you learn to\nchange your attitude in social\nsituations\nyeah definitely okay so let's let's just\nnotice that for a second because that\nsounds\ni mean it makes perfect sense to me but\nit sounds strange\nright so like here you're seeing a\ntherapist and your therapist is telling\nyou hey if you're like\ninsecure about going to parties what you\ncan do is change your attitude\nand then you can like learn to be like\nmore friendly and more positive\nand as you become more friendly and\npositive you'll be able to make more\nfriends\nand you'll be able to go to parties is\nthat a fair\nno i would say the way she wanted me to\nthink about it\nis that if you change so um she had to\nthink about self\nfulfilling prophecies right so if i came\nin there thinking\noh um nobody would like me or nobody\ncares about me or whatever\nshe would say that would you know rub\noff to people\ncompared to if i came and being like hey\nlet's meet new people let's make friends\nso she was saying she was basically\nsaying if i went to the party with a\nmore positive\nattitude um i wouldn't feel\nuh as judged or whatever you could call\nit\nokay and and that worked\nyes well while it did uh i got more\nfriends\ni was more confident although i am more\nconfident confident about going to\nparties\nbut i also feel more disconnected\nokay right so let's so this is going to\nsound kind of strange\nlet me ask you nicholas what do you\nthink is how do you understand that do\nyou have any ideas as to what's going on\num kind of i mean to me\ni think it's because most of the\nrelationships are kind of superficial\num and why are they superficial\nwhat makes them\ni'll say it's due to the fact that we're\nonly connected by\nother friends and we don't actually like\nhang out\nand meet and interact you know what i\nmean so we only\nhang out superficially whenever there's\na reason to do it\nwe don't really support each other like\nwith feelings and whatnot because we\ndon't talk about it\nthat much at least um\nso i feel like that's the main thing\nbecause we don't really like support\neach other\nin that fact what keeps you from talking\nabout your feelings\num i have a strong feeling of\nindependence\nand not really relying on each other or\nother people\ni would say anyways okay so i'm going to\ntalk about a theme for today\nright it's how the solutions are the\nproblems\nthat's our theme for today sure\num so i'm going to try to explain this\nconcept for a second and then we're\ngoing to see if how much of it applies\nand how much of it doesn't\nokay okay\nso\nif we think about people who have\nproblems in their relationships\nthey tend to hold on to old solutions\nthat\nused to work so one of my uh\nteachers once told me that the process\nof growing up\nis about getting rid of what works which\nis kind of a weird way to think about it\nbut like let's say i'm a two-year-old\nkid and i don't get what i want and then\ni start crying and then maybe i'll get\nwhat i want\nright so like like two-year-olds have\ncertain ways to make their needs known\nand get what they\nare looking for and get their needs met\nas we grow older ideally a two-year-old\nwill like\nabandon some of those things because\neven though it used to work it's sort of\nnot working anymore\nbut even like a 13 year old who throws a\ntemper tantrum\ndepending on the circumstances that they\ngrow up in will actually get that\ntheir needs met through a temper tantrum\nand they're also\n20 year olds 30 year olds 40 year olds\nfor whom like\nthrowing temper tantrums is a way to get\ntheir needs met\nand if they end up like let's say you're\n25 years old and you're used to throwing\ntemper tantrums because your parents\nsort of tolerated that kind of thing\nand then you start engaging in a\nromantic relationship and you start\nthrowing temper tantrums\nand depending on who you're dating\nthey'll either tolerate that\nor they'll break up with you and when a\nlot of people break up with you\nthat becomes sort of a relationship\nproblem right like it's there's some\nproblem that you have with relationships\nand what i find time and again is that\nfirst of all i start with the assumption\nthat like people aren't stupid\ni also start with the assumption that\npeople aren't like broken in some way\ni think for the most part most people\nout there like have\nbrains and bodies and minds that are\nfunctioning the best way that they know\nnow right if you think about like you\nknow your body like\nmost people's hands work pretty well\nmost people's eyes work pretty well this\nis a really crazy thing most people's\nminds work pretty well they do exactly\nwhat they're designed to do\nbut they do know do the best that they\nknow how\nso what i'm noticing any questions about\nthat\nno that makes sense okay so it's kind of\nweird right because you went to this\ntherapist\nand your therapist like taught you this\nlike positive mental attitude strategy\nand what we're hearing is actually a lot\nof success we're hearing that you were\nable to go to parties\nthat you were able to make friends that\nyou changed your attitude and you feel\nconfident and comfortable\ninteracting with other people whereas in\nhigh school you didn't really feel that\nway so that's a success\nright right yeah and at the same time\ni asked you kind of a weird question\nbecause if this is a success\ni asked you the question have you found\nthat\nthe better you got at this the more\nemotionally isolated you feel\nand your answer was what um yeah\ncorrect so like let's try to think about\nhow does that happen\nlike what's going on there so\nmy sense is that this worked for you but\nwhat you learned how to do\nwas like put on a certain kind of\nclothing\nlike you put on this mental clothing of\nlike i'm gonna have a positive mental\nattitude\nand then you started to be someone that\nyou're not exactly\nlike you started to take parts of\nyourself like you had these insecurities\nright and then what you did is you like\nburied those insecurities underneath\nthis like positive mental attitude\nand as a result the most connected that\nsomeone can get to you\nis halfway because the most they ever\nsee\nis like the positive part and then what\nyou're here what i'm hearing from you is\nthat like you you\nyou don't have a deeper emotional\nconnection with people\nand that's sort of because like i think\nyou approach it from sort of a\nhey let's like hang out and like let's\nmeet people and let's have a good time\nand so you project that side of yourself\nwhich is a good side and people kind of\nlike that and they're like hey like\nnicholas is a pretty cool guy\nbut it never gets to something serious\nbecause all the serious stuff has been\nkind of pushed away what do you think\ni can definitely agree with that um\nmainly to do with all of my good friends\nthat i do rely on every now and then are\nfrom you know before high school mainly\nso you know back from when i was 14 and\n10 and under\nstuff like that so so yeah so let's\nthink about\nwho did they get to know um\nwell yeah definitely the more uh\nconnected or like\ntrue part of myself i guess you could\ncall it i just know actual true part of\noneself but you know\nwhy not what does that mean well um\ni just have to think that you always\nproject one side of you to everyone\nyou don't always reject like the whole\nside of yourself\nno matter who you're with i feel like\njust um because you know like when when\nas you talked about the mastering when\nyou go to\nlike a sports club or whatever you put\non one side of yourself when you go to a\nclass you put on another site so on and\nso forth\num so i feel like with\nmy older friends they definitely got to\nknow me better\non a more all-around standpoint but\ni don't think there's anyone that like\nreally\nyou know know that for me not even\nmyself\nso do you want them to know the for you\num no why not i don't think so\nbecause i think there's some things i\nwant to keep private for myself\num just for the fact that there's some\nthings i feel like that\nthat shouldn't be shared to other people\num it doesn't have to be anything\nsensitive just um\nit could be hobbies it could be\num just your alone time in general\nhonestly it could be your own those\nsecrets or\npromises to yourself but i think it\ndepends from person to person mean so i\ntotally get that things are\npersonal right i'm still a little bit\ncurious about\nit seems like you feel like they\nshouldn't be shared\nno i'm not saying that necessarily it's\njust my\num i'm just saying me personally would\nrather\nnot share everything something someone\njust wants to keep\nyeah and are there things that you want\nto share but you haven't been able to\ndefinitely yeah um like now like the\nemotional and\nand every time i felt depressed like in\nprevious times in high school\nuh i couldn't for example always talk to\nmy parents because i wasn't comfortable\nwith it\num stuff like that you know so you\nweren't comfortable with it what does\nthat mean\num the reason why i wasn't comfortable\nwith it\nis due to my mother being very uh\nlike she blames herself a lot for a lot\nof things so i felt like if i told her\nshe would\nbe upset about it um so that's the\nreason\nand also just the fact that i wasn't\ncomfortable sharing things about myself\nin general at that point in time\ni was very like isolated so\nso nicholas those two combinations what\nare you afraid is going to happen if\npeople see who you are\num i'm afraid that people will leave\nlike for good physically and emotionally\ndoes that happen to you before yes\na long time ago though i was\n14 i believe where i had like a lot of\nfriends that were just\nfrom my knowledge randomly leave without\nany actual reason\nand what's can you tell us about that\num so i had a combination of online\nfriends and real-life friends\nthat sometimes would just like cut me\noff and\njust stop talking from that point um\nwhich seemed to me at that point that we\nwere in good terms\nso it didn't really make sense to me um\nso that's where like\nbasically a lot of it stems from i think\ni think so too\nyeah so i feel like a lot of it at least\nafterwards at that point\nwhich i do know is that i i shrugged\nmyself in\nand didn't trust a lot of people um and\nthen they kind of\nkind of came over and started trusting\npeople again and talking to people but i\nnever really\nyou know fully opened myself up anymore\nafterwards i think you started talking\nto people again i don't think you\nstarted trusting people\nright what can you tell us\nuh can you tell us a story about when\nyou were 14 like give us an example\nlike help me understand what that what\nhappened\num it's it's kind of hard to\ni mean not to talk about but to explain\num\nbasically so i had a few friends that i\ntalked to almost every day\num and i don't know there's not much to\ntalk about\nexcept for the fact that i was just\ncaught off completely one day\nfrom all of them or one of them no it's\njust a few of them like a few of my\nfriends\nover a period of time i think it's\naround like half a year\njust like disappeared um and they didn't\nreally know each other so i'm not sure\nhow\nlike it happened but just um some\nimportant people left me\nlike after each other basically and\nhow did they how did they cut you off\nlike like how did that happen\nlike that you know they uh blocked me on\nsocial media they didn't reply to\nmessages they stopped\nhanging out with me in that sense\ninteresting so these are real life\nfriends let's like just about just\nboth both a real life person and a few\nonline yeah\ncan we just pick one and kind of go\nthrough the sequence of events\num sure i'm trying to feel like uh\ni'm trying to find if there's any theme\num\nso what happens is that huh nicholas i i\ndon't want a theme and i don't want a\nconclusion\ni want as raw of a data as you can\nprovide\nso as unfiltered as you can give me like\ntell me you know think about like just\nlike pick one person and then you kind\nof said they blocked you on social media\nand stuff like that so\nwere these people that you knew at\nschool\num no mostly online friends some of them\nare my later on though\nbut mostly only friends so that i came\nto know online friends and like how did\nyou know them online did you guys play\ngames together like what was the deal\nsome of them i played games with uh and\nothers i just met on this\nuh social media app called meow chat\nwhich is not you know available anymore\nokay um server shutdown or something i'm\nnot sure about anyways\nit's like basically an app like discord\nbut you can meet random random people\nokay um some of them i happened later\none of them became my girlfriend\nafterwards um not my current girlfriend\nbut like\nat the time um\nand yeah so we i talked to them there\nand then a lot of them\nthey didn't know each other a lot of\nthem started cutting me off after like\nhalf a year i think it was\na half a year year's time um\nand one of them also\nlike basically one of them states that\nthey couldn't use the phone\nand then i found out they had the phone\nlater on to you know chat on\nand then you know i was blocked later\nhow did you find that out\nthey had an alternate account\nand how did you feel when you found out\nthey were lying to you\ni felt betrayed to put it simple pretty\nmuch yeah\nwhat do you mean by betrayed um like\nthey\nthey betrayed my trust basically and\nuh the friendship we had at the time how\ndid they betray it\num well like you said lying to me uh\nby trying to get out of the relationship\nwe had like\nthe friendship um without an actual\nreason without telling me why or what's\ngoing on or anything like no\ncommunication whatsoever\num so i think that is what kind of\nstruck me so i'm i'm envisioning that\nyou sort of\nstarted to be afraid that there's\nsomething wrong with you\nright yeah i guess you could say that\nthat is um\nsorry go ahead um no um one of the\nthemes i have when i\nwhen i get these episodes of feeling uh\nlonely and\nafraid is that i feel like something's\nwrong with me but i quite can't\nuh figure out what it is does that make\nsense where does your mind\ngo yeah go ahead um it goes in a spiral\nbut it usually goes\ntowards the direction where i feel like\ni don't deserve a lot of friends\nand relationships is where it tends to\ngo towards\ncan i think for a second sure\ndo you have a sense of of why it is that\nlet's assume for a moment that that's\ntrue that you don't deserve a lot of\nfriends\nwhat do you think it is that makes you\nnot deserve a lot of friends\num that's what i never can't figure out\num so that's why i call it like an\nanxiety even though it's not\nyou know diagnosed because none of the\nthoughts that get makes sense\nwhatsoever like there's no logic in them\nokay so i i i just spiraled towards it\nand i can't figure out why that would be\nthe case\ni'm just looking at trends in the fact\nthat you know\nmy friends seem to be more popular and i\nlost friends and stuff like that if that\nmakes sense\nso i want to ask you something nicholas\nor i'm going to make an observation\nactually sure so i want you to notice\nthat a lot of times\nwhen we have a feeling our mind tries to\ncome up with\nreasons which is what it's supposed to\ndo\nso let's say that i'm walking barefoot\nand i feel something poke my foot\nso what do i do i i notice that\nsensation i have a feeling of stepping\non something\nsharp and then i lift up my foot and i\nlook at my foot\nand i look at the ground does that make\nsense\ni look for a reason why\ni feel a certain way\ndoes that make sense that makes a lot of\nsense yeah so like let's say i'm in a\nrelationship\nand i have a feeling that my partner is\ncheating on me\nthen what i do is i go look for reasons\ni start checking their phone\ni start texting them i start asking\naround\ni look for a reason to explain a feeling\nand what i'm hearing from you is that\nyou have a fee\nand you have a feeling but you haven't\nbeen able to find a reason\ndefinitely yeah and you're still looking\nfor ways\nyes what do you think about that\num that is\ni don't know i i can't collect my\nthoughts on exactly that\ni feel anything if anything i feel\nscared um yep\nso i think the more you look for a\nreason\nand the more you're unable to find one\nwhat does that do to your fear\nuh accelerates it i would say absolutely\nright\nbecause you're like oh my god there's\nsomething wrong and i can't find it\nand it's big and it's bad and i'm\nlooking and i'm looking and i'm looking\nand i can't find it and if i can't find\nit i can't fix it\nand if i can't fix it i'm going to be\nalone\nbecause whatever it is is going to pop\nup again and it's going to drive people\naway\nyes that would be the case okay\ndo you think that kind of encapsulates\nhow you feel\nuh yeah actually i would say it is um\nyeah because that would count both\nplatonically and momentarily\nyeah okay\nso i want to talk to you for a second\nabout something called psychosis\nokay and i realize this is kind of weird\ni'm not trying to judge you\nyeah have you heard this term psychosis\ni have but i'm not quite sure of the\ndefinition of it okay\nso like do you know what the word\nparanoia means\nyeah okay so i i don't think you're\npsychotic i don't think you're paranoid\nor anything like that\nthe the reason i'm bringing it up is\nbecause sometimes if we want to try to\nunderstand how something works\nwe have to look at\na malfunction of that object\nso for example if i'm trying to figure\nout what a tire does\non a car if i\nslash the tire and let the air out then\ni quickly figure out oh\nthis is the function of the tire does\nthat make sense\nif we break like some piece like if i\nunplug my mouse like if i don't know\nwhat controls my computer and then i\nunplug my mouse i can quickly figure out\nokay the keyboard controls this and the\nmouse controls this does that make sense\nso we can discover the function\nof something by looking at a case of\nmalfunction\nwith me yeah so i want to use psychosis\nto illustrate\na general principle of the mind that\napplies to everyone\nbut when we look at psychosis we'll kind\nof see how that function of the mind\nworks because we'll look at like\na version that's kind of busted so\nsometimes people\nhave um paranoia and it's sort of like\nan\nit's like a illness or like it's it's a\nmalfunction of paranoia\nso what happens is that you know\nsometimes people with psychosis they'll\nwake up one day and they feel like\nthey're being watched\nthey have a feeling i'm being watched in\nthe same way that you have a feeling\nthat something is wrong with you\nyou just wake up one day and you're like\ni've got i'm a feeling i have a feeling\nthat something's being watched\nso then what happens is their logical\nmind starts to try to figure things out\nlike okay where like who's watching me\nand they look around and they're like oh\nwell i have like these two webcams here\nand so like that must be what's watching\nme so what they do is they unplug their\nwebcams\nand they like feel better for a day and\nthen they wake up the next day and\nthey're like okay i feel like i'm being\nwatched\nlike i took care of the webcams like\nwhat else is going on oh must be someone\nmaybe someone's looking at me through\nthe windows so then what they do is they\nlike they\nclose up all the windows and then\nthey're like feel better for a day and\nthe next day they wake up and they're\nlike i feel like i'm being watched\nand they're like not really sure what's\ngoing on so then they walk down the\nstreet\nand sure enough there's someone looking\nat them they're walking down the street\nand there's someone walking the other\nway and like that person's kind of\nwatching\nand then they go and they're they drive\naround and they see like their\ncars like they make a right turn and\nsomeone else makes a right turn\nand they're like oh my god maybe i'm\nbeing followed\nand this goes on for a while and then\nlike they they try to figure out okay\nwhere is this feeling coming from who's\nwatching me\nand then eventually like they start to\nconstruct like really bizarre theories\nso they start to think that like\nit must be the government or the mafia\nbecause they think\nwho has the resources to be constantly\nwatching me\nand the best answer that they can come\nup with is like a powerful organization\nbut what i want to point out is like\nyou know which comes first the thought\nor the feeling\nthe feeling and the thought is always\nlooking for an answer does that make\nsense\nyeah and so the the really interesting\nthing is that's the way our mind is\nwired though because like when we step\non something we have a feeling and then\nour mind has evolved to be like hey\nlet's try to figure out where this\nfeeling comes from\nlike that's what our mind does it's like\nit tries to explain\nour feelings because our feelings tend\nto be like\nyou know intuitive like warning signs or\nlike i mean there's a lot of\nimportant stuff in feelings if i walk\ninto a room\nand i make eye contact with someone and\nthen i have butterflies in my stomach\nand i start to feel sweaty\nand i start giggling like an idiot like\nthose feelings are telling me something\nright so feelings are a really important\nsource of information\nand then my mind tries to like piece\ntogether what's going on with the\nfeeling\nany questions so far no that makes sense\nwhat makes sense about it um\nthe fact that we are you know we've\nevolved to perceive stuff\nand then make sense of it right so we're\nusing our senses yeah that makes a lot\nof sense to me yeah yeah\nbut the thing is that feelings come\nfirst\ndefinitely right and and so like you\nknow you can walk into\num you know you can walk into your house\nlate at night and then like you get this\nfeeling that maybe you're in danger and\nall the lights are off\nand like that feeling comes from\nsomewhere and then you try to reassure\nit you turn on the lights you look\naround whatever\nso in your case i think what could be\ngoing on\nis that you have a feeling that\nsomething in you is busted\nand that's not an inaccurate feeling\nbecause\nhow else do you explain these people\nghosting you like there must be\nsomething wrong right\nbut i i think what started to happen is\nthat feeling\nhas started to grow so much and develop\na life of its own\nthat your mind is doing all these\ncompensatory mechanisms it's like\nstarting to think about this and think\nabout this and think about this\nand you can never find the answer for\nwhat's wrong with you because i don't\nthink there's anything wrong with you\ni think the reason that you feel like\nsomething is wrong with you is because\npeople did treated you in a way that\nmade you feel\nnot valued yeah\nbut the thing is that feeling doesn't\ncome from the outside it comes from\ntheir actions towards you\ndoes that make sense sure yeah so like\nlet me give you just another example\nso let's say i have abuse of parents if\nmy parents treat me like [ __ ] i'm gonna\ngo through life\nfeeling like i'm worth nothing\nit doesn't actually mean i'm worth\nnothing it just means that\nthe way that my parents treated me made\nme feel like i'm worth nothing\nand then as i go through life with that\nfeeling i'm gonna come up with all kinds\nof compensatory mechanisms or solutions\nto deal with it like i need to ask\npeople all the time like i have to ask\nthem like if i'm dating someone i have\nto ask them every single day\ndo you love me true\nbecause i need to hear it from them\nbecause i don't believe it about myself\nso i need reassurance do you love it\ndo you really love me do you really\nreally really\nare you gonna leave me promise you me\npromise me you'll never leave promise me\nbecause i don't have faith or confidence\nthat this person wouldn't want to leave\nme\nand so your mind comes up with all these\nthings to try to account for it but at\nthe end of the day like\nwhere does that person's lack of\nconfidence come from\nwell that would come from themselves\nabsolutely\nright yeah do you think this applies to\nyour situation\nyeah i would say yeah\ni would say in a different way but it\napplies more to the fact that i\num keep telling myself that i'm gonna be\nlonely whenever you know\nthese thoughts come up and i just um i\ncan't stop that feeling of thought\nfrom coming and then in that sense as\nyou said earlier i take the logic to the\nfact that that might be something wrong\nwith me even though it's not an actual\nfact\num so i think in that way it would apply\nbut you know yeah so\nnow we get to an interesting great point\nso let me ask you\nwhen you feel like you're gonna be\nlonely what do you\ntry to do with that feeling\num whenever that happens i don't really\ndo\nmuch about it i tend to isolate myself\nand just be in my fields for the next\ntwo hours three hours\nand then after that i just kind of get\nnumb if that makes sense\nokay that doesn't make sense so i think\nyou you kind of get like\nmentally exhausted from the feeling yeah\ni would say that yeah yep\nright so like sounds like an overload\nyep overload and then it's like\nyou know it's like a you know what a\nblue screen of death is a bsod\num no okay so it's like when your\ncomputer crashes\nyour ram overloads or something and it\njust restarts\nright yeah so like that's that i'm\nhearing that happen with you\nso let's think a little bit about do you\nhave any idea about how to move forward\nfrom here\num i feel like it's a lot to do with um\naccepting myself but i'm not sure how to\ndo that\nright so that's the problem because it's\nlike everyone's like\naccept yourself nicholas for who you are\nand then you will be free and then\nyou're like how the [ __ ] do i do that\nyeah you know it makes no sense from\nit's basically like telling depressed\npeople not to be depressed you know\nlike no it's actually the opposite\nthat's why that's why they have trouble\nwith it because it's not telling them to\nnot be depressed it's telling them to be\ndepressed\nnot quite sure what you mean so\naccepting yourself\nis not if so if there's someone who's\ndepressed and we tell them to accept\nthemselves\nare we telling them to be depressed or\nnot be depressed\nno that's not what i meant i mean like\nwhen you tell depressed people not to be\ndepressed\noh right yeah yeah yeah okay it's like\nyou can tell them just\njust don't be depressed it doesn't work\nand i can tell you\njust accept yourself and you're like i\nhave no [ __ ] idea how to do that\nexcellent yeah okay so let me tell you\nwhat accepting yourself looks like\ngive me a second okay sure\nokay so when you meet someone\nyou show them a mask right\nwhy do you show them a mask um\nto be liked by that person i would say\nbe accepted by the person\nyeah so so see this is this is the\nproblem right so your solution is the\nproblem\nto be liked by them to be accepted by\nthem and when they accept you\nyou [ __ ] yourself because they're not\nactually accepting you\nwho are they accepting well yeah my\nhusk basically yep yeah and so all of\nyour interactions\nreinforce the idea that the only thing\nabout me that is\nthat is worth loving is my mask\nyeah and so like the more people that\naccept your mask\nwhat happens to your emotional\nloneliness\nwell it would get worse absolutely the\nsolution\nis the problem so now let me ask you a\nquestion\nnicholas sure how do we change that\ncycle\nwell in that case um it would be\nstopping\nlike stopping yourself from putting a\nmask on which\nwould that's easier said than done but\nabsolutely\nyeah but go ahead\noh i was i was going to say basically um\nnot to enable yourself going that way\nand try to\nyou know be yourself around more people\nyeah so but we've made so that's very\ndifferent right because telling the\ndepressed person to not\nbe depressed in that case the person\ndoesn't\nknow how to do it they literally don't\nknow how to do it\nbut now we've come to a different\nproblem you know how to do it\nit's just really hard yeah does that\nmake sense\nlike there's apples and oranges yeah\nyeah\ndefinitely okay right so like like now i\nknow this is gonna sound weird but this\nis how you accept yourself\nwhen you show yourself to other people\nyou have to that's you have to accept\nyourself in that process\ndoes that make sense you can't show\nyourself to someone without\naccepting who you are yeah\ni can see that right so like i know it\nsounds weird but that's how you do it\nso what what that means practically is i\ni think that like\nthere are going to be times where you\ninteract with other people where there's\ngoing to be a part of you that says\nyou're going to have a thought or you're\ngoing to want to do something or say\nsomething\nand there's going to be a part of you\nthat says nicholas don't do that\nbecause if you say that they'll run away\nyou know which part i'm talking about um\nwell that would be the suppressed part\nof me or like my actual\nbut i encourage you to look at your yeah\ngo ahead\nyeah no um i'm not sure how to phrase it\nuh\nit would be the part over the my expect\nexpectations of others inside of me or\nsure\nsure yeah my point is i'm not sure i was\nafraid the\nmask has a cognitive component right so\nwhen we call a mask you're not actually\nputting on a mask what the mask is\nis it's a set of thoughts that dictate\nyour behaviors\nsure does that make sense so the thing\nthat if you want to accept yourself\nwhat you have to do is notice those\nthoughts that are telling you to not say\nsomething\nand then choose the other thing and\nthey're gonna say like so you have a\ngirlfriend now it sounds like\nno no no no no okay um so\nso you know like are there certain\nthings that we've talked about today\nwhich you thought would be relevant but\nyou haven't shared because you're afraid\nof judgment\num hold on i'm trying to think about it\num only thing\nno no not really okay\nyeah no just going okay can i um you\ngotta\nlet me know if this is going overboard\nokay but i'm just gonna ask you a\nquestion\ncan we talk about why you don't have a\ngirlfriend\nsure okay now my hope in talking about\nwhy you don't have a girlfriend is that\nyou're going to have certain thoughts\nabout yourself\nthat the mask is going to want to cover\nor certain feelings about yourself\nright do you think that that's the case\nif we talk about why you don't have a\ngirlfriend\ni think it could be the case but not to\nthe extent you might think\nokay so then give me something else\num the thing about this is that i've had\nit for a while\nso i've kind of come to accept it as a\npart of me if that makes sense\nthat i just do it you know yep i\nunderstand so that's why i want\nsomething that's like\nyou know so let me put it this way you\nknow you said earlier that there are\nsome things that you\ndon't want to share with people because\nthey're private\nso like let's pick one of those topics\nand talk about it\num well this was one of the topics it's\nnot that i'm\nhonestly it's not because i'm afraid to\ntalk about it i just don't do it um\nfor the fact that i don't want to bother\npeople with it okay so what's something\nthat you don't want to bother us with\nyeah well yeah this was one of them the\nsecond\nwould be um my insecurity in\nmyself sometimes in my like the way i\napproach people\nwhich i feel like is a huge factor as to\nwhy i don't have a girlfriend as well\num also my um\nwell what was i going to say also the\nfact that i get depressed not diagnosed\nwhich is like a huge\nhuge difference but everyone gets\ndepressed every now and then\nwhich happens quite a bit um and all of\nthat kind of contributes to me you know\nfeeling it down a lot and i isolate\nmyself\num and then you know i just end up\ngetting those overlaps that talk to you\nabout nicholas i want you to show us an\nugly part of you\ni want to see another i'm not sure how\nto show that though i'm not sure what\nlike\nwhat's that when you say that um\ni don't know it's hard for me to do like\nuh\nwhen you say it i don't know what to\nshow you know\nnothing really comes up if that makes\nsense okay\nso that's kind of interesting right so\nthat that leads to one of two\nwhen i ask you to i want to see the\nugliest thing you've got\nand that if you can't come up with\nsomething what are the reasons that you\nmay not be able to come up with it\num could be the mask as you talked about\nuh but um the other thing i'm not sure\nabout honestly\nokay so one is that you've gotten so\nused to suppressing it\nthat you don't even know how to find it\nanymore i have another\nwild wild idea what if you have nothing\nugly within you\nand all you really have much like the\nparanoid person\nis a feeling that you're ugly and that\ndespite you look first what's ugly\nwithin you you can't find anything\nmaybe what you just have is the feeling\nof ugliness\nyeah i could agree to yeah i could agree\num again as i mentioned at the start\nuh whenever i feel this loneliness i\ndon't know why um and i think that's\nconnected with this because i can't\nfigure out any proper reason for me to\nnot\nbe lonely but it happens in a way yep\nyou know so\nso i have a crazy idea it's just a\nfeeling\nright it's not a truth there's nothing\nbroken\nyou're not ugly because i'm i'm telling\nyou man if you are ugly like that's cool\nshow us so that we can either accept you\nor reject you\nright and and\nso i think this is also where acceptance\ncomes in i think you have to give\npeople the if you want so\nnicholas this all comes down to your\nsense of value\nsomewhere along the way you started to\nbelieve\nthat you weren't worth very much\nthat people treated you poorly because\nyou weren't worth treating well\nand like that's why you put on the mask\nbecause people can't see the ugliness on\nthe inside\nso you have to put on a mask because\nwhat's down there is fundamentally ugly\nand then you you say this a lot so like\nyou don't deserve a lot of friends\ni don't want to bother people if we\nthink about those two statements what\nthat mean is that like\nyou're inconvenient like you're not\nworth it\nlike you're not worth inconveniencing\nsomeone else's day\nit all comes down to value yeah now\nhere's the really tricky thing\nas long as you keep a mask on your sense\nof value will never\nincrease because the more you wear the\nmask the more what they judge is the\nmask and they don't judge you\nand then you end up emotionally lonely\nbecause you never get to connect with\nsomeone\nbecause all they connect with is a false\nface that you put\nyeah so the way that you connect with\npeople is by showing people now that's\nhard\nbecause i don't know that it's a\nparticular thing and maybe we can find\nit maybe we can\nbut even if we can't find it what i\nthink you need is courage\nbecause you have to you have to let them\nlook underneath the mask\nand take the risk\nof being hurt again\nyeah but the only the only way that\nyou're gonna start\nto have faith in yourself and the only\nway you're gonna realize that you're not\nugly on the inside\nis when you take off the mask you go\noutside and then like people treat you\nnormally\nand then the day that you start doing\nthat your life is going to be entirely\ndifferent because it's like holy [ __ ]\ni'm actually a pretty cool guy people\nactually like me they see me they know\nme\nand like maybe the reason that those 14\nyear olds blocked me is because they're\n[ __ ] 14 and it's meow chat and the\ninternet is a weird place\nmaybe there's nothing fundamentally\nwrong with me but you can't know that\nunless you give people a chance\nto reject you\nright now the problem is that you're\nnever you're never putting anything on\nthe table like you're never\nyou're not giving people a chance to\nknow you that's why you're lonely yeah\ni think um the hard part of it is to\nto locate when exactly you put on the\nmask\nand then you know uh rejecting it or\nputting it off\nsure i'm not quite sure because yeah\nbecause right now i've not really\nthought about\nputting the mask on more than what i\nexplained to you earlier\nthat the fact that everyone puts masks\non depending on the situation right\nbut i've never thought about it the way\nyou just put it um\nso i don't think i know how when it's\nthere okay if that makes sense sure so\nnicholas let me ask you\ndo you have a mask on right now possibly\ni'm not i'm not entirely aware of it but\ni think i do\nyeah okay so what does that tell me\num that's something i can't\nquite locate okay um yeah how does it\nfeel\nhow does it feel when i ask you these\nquestions and you can't answer them\nuncomfortable and confusing good\nperfect we're getting underneath the\nmask\nwhat feels uncomfortable about it tell\nme about that discomfort\num i think the discomfort comes from the\nfact that i can't answer\ngood so when you can't answer a question\nthat dr k is asking you how does that\nmake you feel\nwell yeah uncomfortable okay honestly it\nmakes me uncomfortable yeah\nokay so there's what's uncomfortable\nabout it\nit's uncomfortable about it because i\ndon't know why like the\nthe thing that i like because i don't\nknow it makes me uncomfortable because i\nthought that\ni kind of more or less knew why i had it\nbut this makes me a little bit\nuncomfortable because i can't figure out\nnow\nso how does how does someone who can't\nfigure something out\nwhen they're being asked feel\nuh well unknowledgeable or\nstupid sometimes there we go so when you\nsay uncomfortable\ndo you mean stupid\num not entirely when i mean\nuncomfortable it's just when i think\nback\nto all the times i've interacted with\npeople when i i don't know when i've had\nthe mask on then\nyeah but i'm talking about right now\nokay so so\nyou don't know when you've had the mask\non so i'm guessing so generally speaking\nwhen i ask people questions\nand they're not able to answer them and\nthey use the word uncomfortable what i\nimagine they mean is that they feel dumb\nbecause they don't have the answers\nno that's not quite where i feel what do\nyou feel it's just\nuh i want to say i mean i guess you\ncould call it stupid but not quite\nuh is i feel more um surprised\nin like in a bad way kind of like when\nyou get a shock right\num for the fact that i haven't known\nabout this because i\ni feel like i know myself quite well um\nbut apparently i don't it doesn't make\nsense yeah so so\nso you feel like you should have figured\nthis out\nyeah yeah i guess you could say that\nyeah so now that's interesting\nso i think like that too comes from your\nsense of value\nright so instead of just feeling stupid\noh this is gonna be hard nicholas okay\nbut i i wanna i want you guys to really\nlike pay attention to this\ninstead of just feeling stupid he's\nblaming himself for\nnot figuring it out already and\nthat comes from the idea that you're\nfundamentally you're not\nworth it right like oh god this is so\nhard i hope you guys understand this\nbecause i can't explain it better\nlike the person who doesn't value\nthemselves\nblames themselves for not knowing\nsomething\nwhen they learn something new\ndo you guys get that like you guys see\nhow that's his just it's his\nlike instead of just feeling dumb like\nanyone else\nhe feels worthless because he couldn't\nfigure it out\nhe should have figured it out long ago\nlook at how dumb i am like look at how\nworthless i am\nother people would have been able to\nfigure it out but i can't figure it out\nyou guys see that it's all it's all like\nspiraling out of this sense of lack of\nwork does that make sense to you\nnicholas\nthat makes sense you're like blaming\nyourself for not having figured this out\nis that fair yeah it's not no it's not\nfair it's not fair yeah but\nyeah is it accurate i wouldn't say it's\nfair it's accurate yeah yeah\nright so but do you see how like i'm\njust asking you a question and then what\nyour mind is doing is you're saying\noh i can't believe that i didn't notice\nthis before\nlike how dumb am i that that that is the\num feeling of australia\nyeah right so like that too is a feeling\nof value it's about a feeling of your\nidentity as a person it's not like i'm\ndumb because i have low iq it's like i\nshould have figured this out like you're\nbeating yourself\nup right so now i'm going to ask you a\ndifferent question nicholas here you are\nbeing an idiot in front of us and\nrevealing\nall of the things that you should have\nfigured out on your own\nand how do you feel\num i feel nervous honestly and\ni feel um\ni feel like i should have done this a\nlong time ago with friends honestly\nthat's that's the two main feelings okay\nso\nso let's there it is again okay so now\ni'm gonna ask you i should have done\nthis a long time ago with friends\ntell me about that um\nif i if i feel like if i've done it with\nfriends before\nmaybe the problem wouldn't have been as\nprofound as\nas it is and so who's whose fault is it\nthat the problem is this bad\nin that sense i would say it would have\nbeen my own fault there you go you see\nhow your mind does that\nyour mind jumps to blame you\nno matter like however i twist and turn\noh it's like oh\ni should like you see do you really get\nwhat i'm saying here\nyeah i can see now what you mean i think\ni do that quite a lot\nyeah your mind jumps to this idea that\nit's your fault\nand why is it your fault because your\nsense of value for yourself is low\nit can't be someone else's fault\nnicholas\nwhen they stopped when they blocked you\nwhose fault wasn't nick\nmy fault there it is yeah yeah i see\ni see\nwhat do you see tell me\ni see why um you know these feelings\nkind of come up now\nif i'm constantly putting myself under\nthe bus basically\nexactly yeah you know that makes sense\nright makes a lot of sense yeah it's\nweird man but so here's the thing\ni hope that you have some some kind of\nhope at this point\nbecause i certainly have hope for you\nsure\nyeah i mean i don't feel so here's the\nthing i don't feel hopeless\num yeah because i felt progress and then\ni've you know kind of like taken two\nsteps forward and then one back kind of\nback and forth um what really gets me is\nwhen i have\nyou know um those episodes of overload\nbecause that then it kind of affects me\nfor like days at a time\nbut i feel like yeah so like\num let's say i get it and then i'm\nfeeling\nlonely and anxious for like three hours\nmaybe\num and then i then i will feel numb for\nlike two days three days\nokay and that's that's what really like\nmakes me feel lonely after that point\nnow what i'm not like everything else\nyou say still counts but this is what\nlike really hits me that's what i was\nhoping to\nkind of talk about yeah so i i know this\nis going to sound maybe a little bit\ndisappointing nicholas but\ni don't think you can do so much about\nthose overload states\nright now sure i think the overload\nstates will get better\nover time the more that you notice\nand accept that there is a part of you\nthat is going to twist and turn and\nblame yourself\nand my guess is that if you tunnel into\nthose overloaded states or\nright right before you get overloaded if\nyou tunnel down into what you're\nthinking\nsomehow it's a thought that stems from\nyour sense that like you messed up in\nsome way\nor that you're not a good person\ni could agree it's like a frenzy of like\nthoughts about oh i messed this up or i\nshould have done this or like\nyou know this person like i could have\ndone this better and and\nlike it's something about you not and in\nall of those\nshoulds that you tell yourself those are\nnot acceptance\nbecause like even then like if you say\noh i should have done this with friends\nlike you can't accept that like\nit's okay to not have done it with\nfriends like you're doing it now\nlike it like do you see how should and\nacceptance or opposite\nends of the spectrum like this pen is\nblack\nit should be blue like that's not\naccepting that the pen is black\nit's just two opposite ends and\nand so the cool thing is that i think\nthat you you will get better but\nthe the solution to the overload\nepisodes\nis not to fix the episode it's to slowly\nchip away at the fuel for the episode\nright right so and and the more that you\nlook at like how your mind makes it your\nfault\nis your mind making it your fault here\nwhen you're listening to me is it doing\nsomething\nno i'm just i'm just listening okay i'm\nthinking about when i have the episodes\nthat um usually something triggers it\nright so\ni've done something but it's just that\nway i feel like i was in the wrong yep\nthere it is okay\nyeah right you could tell me more but do\nyou see you see how like what triggers\nthe episode is the idea that you've done\nsomething wrong and what's [ __ ] up is\nyou probably didn't even do anything\nwrong\nand so what i'm saying is if you want to\nconquer the episode so i want everyone\nto understand this\npeople come to me and they say how do i\nput out the fire my house is burning\ndown every week it burns down\nand what i say is don't try to put out\nthe fire put out the match\nput out the match that gets you started\nand like because people look at this and\nit's kind of bizarre but like\nit's way easier to put out a match than\nit is to put out the fire once it\nstarted\nand so once you get into that overload\nmode it's going to take a lot of effort\na lot of work to kind of wrap that in\nbut what i'm telling you and this is\nwhen when i think about\nyou know when i've helped people who\nhave like panic attacks and stuff to the\npoint where they're like off of\nmedication\nthey're basically i mean they're not\nreally cured but in psychiatry we don't\ncure anyone\nwe have something called sustained\nremission which means that\nthey don't have any symptoms for a long\nperiod of time but we don't cure anyone\nbecause we don't we can't do that fine\nso when i see\npatients with sustained remission the\nway that i get there is i\ni get them to put out the match you go\nto the root of it\nand you pull out the root and all of the\nsubsequent behaviors\nwill come crumbling down\nso would you say um would you say the\nway to find the match would just to be\nrecognized in it\nwhen it happens absolutely because you\nsaid\nit gets triggered by what nicholas\num by me blaming myself basically there\nit is\nyeah so the\nthe hard part at that point i would say\nis just to\nto stop the thoughts from rolling in\nnope you can't stop them nope\nthat's not acceptance right see that's\nwhat you try to do\ni would bet money i would bet money that\nyou fight against them\nyou fight against them with every fiber\nof your being\nand the more you fight them the more\nthey grow\nthat's right right so i want you to\nimagine this\ni want you guys to think about your\nthoughts like water\nand the harder you hit it like if i if i\njump off of a hundred foot diving\nboard and i make myself flat and i smack\ninto water it's hard like concrete\nthe harder i push against it the harder\nit pushes back\nif i'm in a bathtub or if i'm in the\nlet's say a bathtub\nif i'm in the bathtub and there are too\nmany waves in the bathtub\nand i push against the waves what\nhappens\nwhen they push back absolutely and so\nthat's what you do\nwhen those thoughts come what do you do\nnicholas\ni push back and then what they what do\nthey do\nwell they push back harder then what do\nyou do yeah\npush back yeah back and forth you know\nand then you hit\noverload right you see that it's an\nescalating cycle until you're like\nyou're tired of pushing back\nyou're physically exhausted you just lay\nback they hammer you for a while and\nthen they stop\nand then you crawl out of the tub and\nyou're numb for two or three days\nbecause you're exhausted from all this\ncognitive activity\nso acceptance is laying back at the very\nbeginning\nokay stopping the cycle so when they\nhammer you\nyou just notice it and say oh here it is\nagain\nhere's my old friend here's 14 year old\nnicholas\nwho's paranoid that the world doesn't\nlike him\nbecause that nicholas is still 14 it's\nnot the person that you are today\nwith your cool hair and your beard\nyeah right there's four there's 14 year\nold nicholas who's not confident\nwho's insecure\nand sometimes he's afraid and he comes\nand he says\nnick i'm i'm afraid that people aren't\ngonna like me and then you're like [ __ ]\nyou\neveryone likes you you piece of [ __ ] why\nare you complaining\nand then he grows he gets stronger every\ntime you push him away\nhe gets stronger\nso when those spirals start see that\nwithin yourself see that there's like\nthis part of you that's like oh my god\nthese people don't like me\ni screwed something up and instead of\nsaying no no no you didn't screw\nanything up you're great bro\nyou're awesome because that's actually\nwhat the abuse of 14 year old nicholas\nlooks like\nthat's the positive [ __ ] mental\nattitude that your therapist taught\nright it's telling you like no man like\nyou're awesome like everyone likes you\nyou have no reason to feel that way\ni know it sounds bizarre but that\npositivity is abusive\nit's the weirdest thing in the world\nso you would say it's basically enabling\nyourself absolutely\nand that's what we hear from you right\nwe hear that everything you do makes it\nworse\nlet's just stop doing this that's\ndefinitely true right yeah\nand it started with this positive mental\nattitude stuff because the positive\nmental attitude was useful for a time it\nworked for a time\nright it helped you make friends and\nstuff but now you're finding like okay i\ncan't make authentic friends\ndefinitely and so i i think that there\nare times where you interact with other\npeople where\nyou want to say something that's\nauthentic and then your mind tells you\nyou're going to screw it up if you tell\nthem\nyeah and then you don't speak\nand instead what you need to do is speak\nand here's the wild thing\ni'm not going to tell you you won't\nscrew it up\nthe way to overcome this is by screwing\nit up\nover and over and over again because\nyou're not going to screw it up all the\ntime\nyou're going to screw it up sometimes\nand you're not going to screw it up\nother times\nand that's when you're going to find\nlike the middle road of like who you are\nthat you're not perfect because that's\nwhat you try to be by the way i don't\nknow if you noticed\nsure like the more you try to be perfect\nthe more that comes from the idea that\nyou don't have inherent value\nlike the less and the more insecure you\nare in yourself as a person the harder\nyou try to be perfect and instead what\nyou need to be is just be who you are\nwhich is like a 20 year old guy who's\nlike got some problems with\nself-confidence but it's also like kind\nof friendly and charismatic and knows\nhow to talk to people\nsure be that yeah\nbe the guy who like pisses some people\noff and\nbefriends others\nyeah yeah i can agree the thing\nit's hard though right it's absolutely\nhard to not push back\nyeah that's the that's the main thing\nyep um\nso now nicholas we're gonna test you you\nready for a test\nsure okay if i tell you to push back\nand you can't push back\nhow do you think about yourself\nuh wait um can you rephrase that yeah so\nyou say it's hard\nso let's say you try and you fail\nhow do you think about yourself after\nyou fail\ni would feel disappointed normally\nyep right and then you would say to\nyourself i should be able to do it\nyep correct and there it is again\ndo you see it same thing yeah\nyeah yeah yeah i see what you mean right\nyeah so so the next time yep\nso the next time you try and it's hard\nand you fail what are you gonna tell\nyourself instead\nthat's okay absolutely yeah\nand what is it okay it's okay to fail\nyes yeah definitely okay it's okay to\nnot be perfect\nyep and and what do we call that by the\nway\nacceptance there you go yeah\nthat's how you accept yourself you see\nyou figured it out\nyeah now i just have to put it into\npractice\nyou know what and and what happens when\nyou try and you fail\nthen i should be okay with it and accept\nit\nyeah right because even then when you\nsay now i need to put it into practice\nwhat you're doing\nis your your d devaluing the success\nof understanding you just had\nokay that's interesting\nbecause i didn't notice that yep because\nyou don't because it's there man it's\nthere in your programming right because\nwhen you say now i need to put it into\npractice what that says is nicolas isn't\ngood enough\nokay that's interesting\nyeah that's interesting because i i\nwould say i saw it differently but\nyeah when i said it firstly it was more\nlike a hopeful statement\nsure but i can see what you mean by it\nyeah yeah yep\nand i'm not i'm not disputing so i think\nthe other tricky thing is that i think\nhope can be within this thing\nright i i think you can because if\nyou're different you can hope\nright it's it's subtle but you're like\nif i was a different person if i behaved\nlike i should\ni'm hopeful for the future\nokay if i dot dot dot then i can hope\nbut the still subtle thing there is that\nnicholas you don't need to do anything\nman you're perfect just the way that you\nare\nyeah perfection and imperfection is what\nyou mean like yep\nthere you go yeah yeah okay gotcha\ngotcha yeah\nthere you go yeah yeah\nyeah that's how it meant\nyes that's good that's progress\nbecause let me explain something to you\nwhen you say that's hard man\nthere's no should there there's no hope\nthat is a statement of acceptance okay\nright that is a statement that says i\ndon't know if i can do it\nit's not beating yourself for up for not\nbeing able to do it it's not saying that\nyou should be able to do it\nit's saying you know what man that's\nhard\nthat's acceptance yeah\nyeah i can see i see yeah that's true\ni'm trying to wrap my uh mind around\nyeah sorry it's it's kind of\nit's getting abstract but nicholas\nreally i\ni think it's like there are a couple of\ncore things where i really think if you\ncan kind of\nreally get a handle on them and learn\nhow to see them\nand learn how to say that's hard\nright like so like there's 14 year old\nnicholas and there's 20 year old\nnicholas and when 14 year old nicholas\ncomes to 20 year old nicholas and he\nsays\nhey my friends bro blocked me on meow\nchat\nand then when nicholas says hey man\nthat's rough that's hard\nthat's got to be tough that's acceptance\nright\nit's not telling him hey you're a piece\nof [ __ ] it's also not telling him that\nyou're a wonderful person you didn't do\nanything wrong maybe you did\neither way you can accept that it's hard\nthat it's tough\nand it doesn't have to mean anything\nmore beyond that\nokay questions yeah\ni'm trying to think of some\nright so what would you do um\ni guess i guess this kind of answer i'm\ntrying to unfold it a bit more\nsure so what we do when some someone um\ndoes something about the mean\nbut you can't figure out the reasoning\npoint\nin this case being uh so i used to live\nin spain\num in spain what happened i went to a\nparty\nand at the party someone um literally\npunished me like without any reason\ni figured out the reason they say being\nthat she was trying to get some money\noff of someone\num you know by doing some\nwork she would say i don't know if i can\nstay on stream\ni don't know if you can't either i mean\nthere's against tournaments\nyeah um it was you know some illegal\nkind of what she's trying to do with\nsomeone\nokay um and she felt like kind of\nblocked that off so she punched me\num but i i didn't know that until later\nso i beat myself up for that because i\ncouldn't figure out\nwhy i was punched right um\nso in that sense why would you what\nwould you do like because\ni'm not sure how you would accept that\nthing\nas except for just that that you know\nexcept that someone punched you without\nreasoning\nhow would you not overthink it is what\ni'm trying to say because i\ninstantly you know tried to as we've\nyou know talked about tried to find a\nreason for it yep\nso i think because that's a great\nexample man because that example shows\nand i say this with love how [ __ ] up\nyour reasoning is\nbecause when you're at a party and you\nget randomly punched by someone\nif your mind somehow does some\ngymnastics to make it your fault\nwhen you don't even know who this person\nis and she just walks up to you and\npunches you\nlike do you see how that's just\nabsolutely ridiculous like the reason\nshe punched you is because she's an\n[ __ ]\nthat's the reason right has nothing to\ndo with you\ndefinitely but i'm trying to figure out\nlike how would you\nbecause i feel like most people would\nthink about that it's an extreme right\nabsolutely such a random thing that\nwould\noccur so how would you stop yourself and\nwell not stop yourself but how would you\nnot beat yourself up from it is what i'm\ntrying to ask\nokay so i mean i think oddly enough\ni know this sounds bizarre nicholas i\ndon't think most people would beat\nthemselves up after getting punched\npunched randomly in the face sure enough\nokay sure\nokay but i i think but that doesn't help\nyou because you beat yourself up\nand that should just give us an idea for\nhow strong that complex is in your mind\nso here's a here's an answer for you so\ni want you and this is going to sound\nkind of weird but maybe it'll help\nbecause it's sort of a long shot\nso i want you to think about karma karma\nwhat's your understanding of karma\num i have the understanding that karma\nis necessarily good or bad but it's a\nbunch of\nenergy that kind of determines where you\ngo in the next life\nokay if i'm just correct yep so i'm\ngoing to tell you a story\nso you've heard of this guy buddha\nbuddha yeah siddharth okay\nso buddha gets enlight okay and then he\nlike he's like teaching people\nand so he's got a bunch of disciples and\nhe's like sort of famous at this point\nand one day someone comes up to him so\nhe's like teaching and now he like gives\na lecture and after the lecture\nyou know he's got his disciples that are\nthere and then someone comes up and\nsometimes people will come up and ask\nhim questions\nand so someone comes up to him and and\nhe says hey do you remember me and\nbuddha says\nno i don't he says well you tried to\nteach me how to meditate 15 years ago\nand it didn't work\nand then the dude spits and put this\nface\nhe's like [ __ ] you and then his\ndisciples get pissed they're like this\nguy's like he's disrespecting the master\nlike\nlet's beat his ass and then brother's\nlike no no calm down chill\nand he's like just let him go so the\ndude like spits in his face and he like\nwalks away\nhe's like expecting something to happen\nmaybe walks away and they're like how\ncan you let this guy disrespect you like\nthat and with this like that's just a\nkarma that he has to wipe away\nso he has like some amount of resentment\ni may have wronged him\nhe's fit in my face and now we're done\nhe's gone he's gonna go live his life\ni'm gonna go live mine\nit's just sort of like it just gets\nwiped away\njust because i'm enlightened doesn't\nmean that i've become free of all of my\npast karmas\nit's just a debt that i had to pay okay\nso i don't know if this is going to help\nyou or not\nbut i would say that you know if you're\ntrying to think about\nwhy bad things happen to you and you're\nlooking for an\nalternate solution besides\ni'm an idiot and it's my fault and i\nlack value\ni would toss out garma for you to think\nabout\nnow you have to decide for yourself\nwhether like after studying it and\nthinking about it it's a good alternate\nsolution\nbut in my mind you know all causes have\neffects\nand all effects have causes\nso one way to think about it is like\nyou're looking for you know the cause to\nthe effect of her punching you whereas\nlike that cause may not\ncome from you and in fact her punching\nyou may not be in effect it could be a\ncause\nshe could be opening up a new karma\nwhere like you had the opportunity to\npunch her back\nright anyway it gets complicated but i i\nmean the simplest answer i can give you\nis like just understand that\nsome of the [ __ ] that happens to you in\nlife is like you could say\nyou don't want to think about karma you\ncould just say hey man [ __ ] happens\nsome people say that right some people\nsay that the world is a random place and\nsometimes just random bad things happen\nto good people like which is a\ncompletely reasonable\nhypothesis on the other hand some people\nsay that everything is determined and\norderly and like it's because god wants\nit to happen and stuff like that\ni think that's completely fine\nhypothesis too in the middle i think\nthere's just the simple principle of\ncause and effect which is karma which is\nthat like\nthings happen like all things have\ncauses and all causes have offense\nand that doesn't mean that you're the\ncreator of the universe and sometimes\npeople are going to be [ __ ] to you\nbecause that's just\nyou know why is one person born in the\nunited states whereas another person is\nborn in zimbabwe whereas another person\nis born\nin australia you can say it's randomness\nyou can say it's karma\nbut in your case i'd say just think\nabout like you know are you the center\nof all things that happened to you\num in my world technically yes you know\nbecause you\nyeah you perceive everything right so\nthat's something that i would encourage\nyou to think about right so i don't\ndoubt that you perceive it\nand you may even arrive at a logical\ntruth that you are the center of all\nthings that happened to you but i'd\nencourage you to think about it\nand be like is it my fault if i'm\nwalking down the street and someone\nyou know spills their drink on me\ndid i do something wrong and i'm not\nsure\ni need you i think you need to give your\nlife\nactors besides yourself\nyeah i could agree yeah right because\nsometimes when people block you it's\nbecause\nthey're envious not because you did\nsomething wrong\nbut because they're envious all kinds of\nreasons people block other people\nsure yeah i mean it's not the fact that\nthat they blocked me it's more like the\nway that\nthey just you know cut off the\nrelationship sure\nyou know is it yeah because people get\nlocked all the time\nbut it's more like there yeah yeah and\nso once again there are lots of reasons\nthat could happen i think the problem is\nthat your mind\njumps to one and the more that you\nnotice\nokay here my mind is blaming me again\nand even in that scenario if you notice\nthat your mind is blaming you for being\npunched by a random person at a party\nthen just be like whoa that's kind of\nweird like there it is again\nblaming me for being punched by a random\nperson\nsure yeah and i know that's something\nnot going i was gonna say like i i don't\neven think you need to do much more than\nthat\nif you can just notice that that's the\npart of the mind i i kid you not\nit it starts to get better i know it's\nbizarre\nwell yeah it's definitely worth a try\nsomething you know\nyeah 100 yeah that's a wild man\nthat she just punched what do you mean\nyeah no i was there\nso we were sitting um like in a circle\nand i was talking to my friend he was\nsitting across me and she was sitting in\nthe middle\nand then um to put a friend she thought\nthat was blocking her because she was\ntrying to\ncharge him for it and then she punched\nme um\nand then we left but i i didn't find\nthat out on so like a few days later\nso sounds like you helped your friend\nout\nyeah i mean he also just found it out\nlater\nso you know but it it is what it is\num yeah that's\nwild story man yeah i mean that's um one\nof the good things to do when you travel\naround right\nyou get to experience them i said that's\none of the good things about traveling\nis that yes experience wild stories yeah\nyeah\nother questions um no i don't think so\nokay so we've got a choice then nicholas\ni feel like we've covered uh\nlike you know we've kind of gotten to\nlike an important conclusion\nif you want to open up something else we\ncan or we can kind of switch to\nmeditation what do you think\nuh i don't really have anything to open\nokay\nyeah um the one thought that you'd made\none statement which i don't think we had\nreally addressed one was that\nindependence leads to like a lack of\ndisclosing or sharing with other people\nlike you said something about\nbeing independent and that's why you\ndon't want to share\nyeah i have this feeling um of\nself-reliance right so i want to be\nvery independent in pretty much\neverything i do\nwhich is also you know with contracting\nwith my own feelings and stuff like that\nso i usually don't\ntend to to reach out to people on this i\nknow\nfor sure i can't do it myself um\nwhich is kind of contradicting with you\nknow this whole thing because you know\nbut that's how it is practically not\nnecessarily\ni i don't i don't think it's\ncontradictory at all i think that\nif you if you have low value in yourself\nyou can strive for independence because\nif you can do it all by yourself\nthen you don't have to worry about it\nsort of negates the low value\nit negates being you know relying on\nother people i think it makes a lot of\nsense but i\nokay um so let's talk about meditation\nsure have you had experience with\nmeditation\nuh a little bit because um i used to\nmeditate\nlike before going to bed just like\nsitting down and relaxing\nfor a bit but not like too much\nokay so i just\ni did like five minutes just sitting\nclosing my eyes and listening\nthat's it like some minutes\nokay let me think about what to do\nsure i have a meditation technique for\nyou but it's a little bit\nadvanced so it could be hard\num but i i wanted to do something a\nlittle bit different\nokay let me just think about how to\nexplain it okay\nokay so i want to teach you something\nnicholas that\ninvolves understanding\nyour relationship to the outside world\nokay okay so if we think about like this\npunching example\nsomething in the outside world happens\nand you\nsomehow think it has something to do\nwith you\ndoes that make sense like i know it\nsounds really bizarre\nbut like as human beings we assume that\nwe\ninteract with the world in a particular\nway that we're responsible for some\nthings\nright so in a weird way it's almost like\nwe believe subconsciously that we\ncontrol\nthe world i know it sounds weird but\nlike let me give you an example let's\nsay that i apply for a job\nor i ask a girl out and i get rejected\ni blame myself it's my fault that i\ndidn't get the job\ni should have studied harder i should\nhave done a better internship i should\nhave wrote a bigger personal statement\nwhatever\nand we don't really acknowledge that the\noutside world has all kinds of reasons\nfor treating us the way that it does\nwhich have nothing to do with us\nlike maybe the reason that i didn't get\nthe job is because\nyou know it was a job maybe the company\nis actually going out of business\nand then they interviewed people and\nthen like never hired it\nright but that's not the way that we\nthink about it we always assume that we\nare responsible for the things that\nhappen to us\ndoes that make sense yeah so\ni know it sounds weird but i want to\nteach you a way where you can start\ndiscovering what the actual relationship\nbetween you and the outside world is\nwhere does nicholas end in the outside\nworld begin\nokay okay i know it sounds weird yeah so\nlet's give it a try um the the practice\nis actually quite simple\nbut it's hard okay so what i i have to\nfigure out how am i\ni need music\nokay so um what i want you to do\nis tune into the stream\nokay so you can hear the background\nmusic\ncan you hear the music yeah i hear the\nmusic\nokay so this is what i want you to do so\ni want all you guys to close your eyes\nand listen to the music so hear the\nnotes\nin the music\n[Music]\ncan you hear the music nicholas yeah i\nhear you\nokay so when you listen to my words\nor the music\ni don't know how to put this but your\nattention is\nfocused on my words right it's focused\non something outside\ndoes that make sense yeah so you're\nlistening to the notes of the music\nsure okay so now what i want you to do\nis put your attention on your ears\nand put your attention not physically on\nyour ears but\non the sense of hearing okay\nso don't listen to the notes pay\nattention to\nyou hearing them so it used to be that\nyour attention was on the notes\nnow your attention is on you hearing the\nnotes\ncan you do that i\nthink so yeah try\n[Music]\num\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nnow you may find that your attention\ngoes back\nto the notes after a few moments\n[Applause]\ndoes that happen a little bit\nokay and then when it moves back to the\nnotes shift it back\nto the hearing of the notes so put all\nyour attention\non your hearing as opposed to the music\n[Music]\nokay\nhow long can you hold on to the hearing\ninstead of the notes\ni think maybe um half a minute to 45\nseconds at a time\nokay before going back\n[Music]\nokay so just we're gonna practice for\nabout another minute okay\nokay\n[Music]\n[Music]\nme\n[Music]\nonce again your attention may go to the\nsound of my voice or the notes\nhear me speaking and then move back\nto the hearing\nso as i continue to talk do your best\nnot to pay attention to my words but\nlisten or pay attention to your\nhearing of the words without paying\nattention to the words\n[Music]\nit can be difficult\n[Music]\nnow go ahead and come back okay\n[Music]\ncan you go back to camera sure\nokay okay\nso now what i'm going to ask you to do\nis look at me sure\nso see my face so we're going to do it\nsame thing but this time we're going to\nuse our eyes\nokay so look at my face\nand so see it right you can look at the\nbackground\nyou can put your attention on anything\non your screen\nor actually yeah or you can look at\nsomething in your room it doesn't really\nmatter\nokay then what i want you to do is put\nyour attention to the looking\ninstead of looking at something having\nyour attention\non the objects that your eyes see have\nyour attention be\non the looking itself\nso it'll almost feel it feels to me like\nzooming out\nand then like a blurry version kind of\nyeah it's not quite blurry vision but\nthen you're doing it right right so just\npay attention to the seeing itself as\nopposed to the object of seeing\nand you can look at something like an\nobject in your room\nor the screen\nand then focus on the object like let\nyour eyes look at the object and really\nsee the object and then\nlet your attention pull back and see the\nseeing itself\nwe'll go for about a minute\nokay\nokay\nthoughts questions do you want to share\nwhat that was like for you\ni felt um i felt like sort of calmness\nbecause i\ni didn't feel like i was thinking about\nstuff you know yeah so\ni just felt uh observing\ni guess you could call it just like\nseeing\nyeah did that make sense where you're\nseeing the seeing itself\nas opposed to seeing an object yeah\ndefinitely okay i i feel like that's\ndoable\nokay so so i i don't know how else to\nput this but\nso here's the cool thing about this\npractice okay\nwhen we see an object it is outside of\nus right like so let's say here's me\nhere's the object if i'm looking at it\nthen the object is out here and\ntherefore me and the object are separate\ndoes that make sense yeah\nso like i'm over here seeing is over\nhere\nthe object is over here\nwhen you look at the seeing what happens\nis the seeing\nmoves from you to the outside\nyeah and then you're looking at the\nseeing itself\nso there's almost a piece of you\nthere's a piece of who you think you are\nthat you shift outside of yourself by\nlooking at the scene\nbecause then the seeing is out there and\nyou're looking at it and then you're\nover here\ndoes that make sense yeah yeah yeah as\nyou said\nit kind of feels like um zooming out for\nme it's more like\na bit of a blurriness i guess you could\nsay um\nbut it definitely feels like you're not\nlike focusing on one thing\nyeah except for like you know so so\nso this is tricky right so after the\nzooming out\nthere is actually the focusing on the\nthing that is doing the zooming out\nright right it's noticing\nthe seeing itself which has the effect\non the object side of zooming out\nbut what i really want you to focus on\nis the act of seeing\nyeah i got you yeah okay that that is\num no yeah go on no go go for it\ni was just gonna say that is i mean it's\ndoable but i don't\ni can't do it for like long periods good\nyeah it's very hard\nso here's the crate i know this is gonna\nsound wild\nbut your problem nicholas is that you\nconfuse\nwhat's in here with what's in the\noutside world\nthis person ghosted me that's not on the\noutside\nthat's on the inside this woman punched\nme\nthat's not on the outside that's on the\ninside and that's the [ __ ] up thing\nthat we've showed you today\nand so literally if you do this practice\nyou will learn\nhow to like like get control over what\nis on the inside and what is on the\noutside\ninstead of misattributing everything you\nwill begin to see\non a very fundamental level what you\nare and what the outside list and what\nyou control\nand what you can't control this all\ncomes down to\nearlier you toss out this tiny tiny quip\nwhere i don't know what to show people\nbecause i don't know who i am\ndon't you yeah and this will be a\npractice where you can learn\nare you seeing are you the object that\nyou see\nare you the seeing itself or are you\nsomething else\nand if you continue to do this i really\nthink it'll help you along with the\nnoticing and acceptance and all that\nother craft we talked about\nit's like literally a cognitive training\nskill to like\ndo something different with your mind\nyou can practice it\nand then when it comes to dealing with\nyour your view of like your\nconfidence in yourself or your value as\na person you'll have done a bunch of\npush-ups so when it comes time\nto actually use your mind it'll like\nwork way better it'll make everything\nway easier for you\ndoes that make sense well yeah yeah that\nmakes sense\nokay cool man any last thoughts or\nquestions\nno um i think we're good to go okay\nlisten uh nick it's been awesome having\nyou man i really really\num appreciated what you shared with us\ni think it's very very important like\nthere are a couple of key principles\nhere that i think are really really\nimportant\nso thank you so much for um you know\ncoming on\ni'm going to take a moment to collect my\nthoughts and then i'll try to recap\nfor other people you're welcome to watch\nthe stream sure is that okay of course\nyeah i'm sure well thank you for having\nme thank you for coming man it's been\nawesome take care no worries\nyou too man bye now bye\nyou"
