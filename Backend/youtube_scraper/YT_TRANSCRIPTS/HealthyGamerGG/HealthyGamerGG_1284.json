    "transcript": "like so that's really interesting right\nbecause for one person\na failure means i'm a bad person\nbut when you feel fail when you say it's\na lesson learned that actually makes you\na better person\nand so if you want to talk about what's\nop it's when failure pushes one person\ndown\nand failure pumps you up like why the\nlike no that's\nthat's op thanks for coming on on stream\ntoday\ni really appreciate it my pleasure get\nbig feel that i've like conquered it all\nbut i haven't everyone still goes\nthrough stuff like\nthey still have difficult days but you\nhaven't conquered at all\nno oh man talk about false advertising\nyeah oh [ __ ] um got the wrong person\nfor the day and and what should i call\nyou my friend\nyou can call me whatever you like paul\npassed pastely what do you prefer\nhonestly a pest is fine if you just call\nme pest\nokay sure it's easy all right so pest\ntell me a little bit and you know if\nthere's\nyou know if you haven't conquered at all\nthen and if there's some way that i can\nhelp you conquer something that you\nhaven't yet conquered\nthen i'm i'm i would love to be of\nservice to you\num okay what's the question\nsorry there wasn't a question there i\nwas just it was an offer\nmore than a question but no like the\npoint i'm trying to make is um i don't\ni don't like bounce out of bed every day\nlike yes i'm ready to next do the next\nthing like there are days where you wake\nup and you're like\nthis is not a good day you know but and\nthen you\nyou have to either self-reflect on that\nday and and just\nwrite it off as this is a day that's not\ngonna be very productive compared to\nother days where i can wake up wake up\nand i'll work 18 hours straight and i'll\njust be still like keen to keep going\nbut\ni know i need to sleep okay so can you\ntell me about\num can you just tell us a little bit\nabout yourself and\nand kind of how you wound up where you\nare today\nall right i'll give the the shortest\nspiel i can so\ni'm one of eight my dad um has had uh\neight children with four different women\nand so i've got one full sister and the\nother ones are all half but we all\nconsider each other brothers and sisters\nwe've\ngot a really big family um i don't\nreally speak that much too much\nbut i'm very open about any questions\nthat people ask me so\nbig family and um i'm the seventh of the\neight\ngrew up in a place uh just in victoria\nin australia\nand uh a bit bit more of a country side\nof things but\num you know just just a general kid like\nskateboarding and all that kind of stuff\nwanted to leave school to join the army\nbut i didn't because my mom wanted me to\nfinish school\nso i finished school and then kind of\nscored me out a little bit\nschool meaning high school okay year 12\ncompleted my normal education okay i\ntried university but i did not like it\nthree months i was out um and then\num i joined as a reservist in the\nmilitary for a uh for a period of time\nuh where you do like you got to do your\nbasic training and then you just go back\nto living your normal life and\nyou train once a week but i didn't enjoy\nthat too much and then i went\nfull time when i was 21 years old and\nspent eight years in the military\nin the infantry in the army and then\nafter eight years in the army i\nleft with no real direction and\ni was going to take some time just to\nreflect on life and do what i enjoy\nwhich was fishing and computer games\nand i started streaming to find friends\nand\nthen after three or four months i\nthought hey i could actually make\nsomething of this\nand three years later which is now but\njust about hit the three-year mark\ni would consider myself a pretty\nsuccessful content creator\nwow that's awesome man\nyeah quite the unorthodox story\nright yeah i was a firefighter for a\nlittle bit as well um\nafter the army as well yeah so can you\ntell us a little bit about\num okay so kind of let's start from the\nbeginning what\nwhat what was it you mentioned that\nyou're you had\nseven siblings correct yeah\nit's a little bit weird because all of\nthem are older except for one\num so like most of them were like adults\ndoing adult things like jobs and all\nthat stuff and i was still like a pretty\nyoung\nkid but um now that i'm a bit older it's\ngreat like\ni've got family everywhere it feels like\nbut yeah um\nyeah um my parents separated\nwhen i was three years old and um that\nwas a\ni don't know i'm sure most people have\ntheir parents split up it's never the\nmost easiest time\num you know separated parents but i\nstill got a really good relationship\nwith both my mum and dad\num i talk calm every week i'm living in\nthe netherlands at the moment\ni probably should have chunked that one\nin there um and so everyone's back in\naustralia i'm in the netherlands so\ni call them every week and say hello and\nyeah\nhow did you wind up how did you end up\nin the netherlands\nso in 2012 i was climbing a mountain in\naustralia which\nthey're kind of like big hills for the\nrest of the world um and\ni was sitting up on top of a hill or\nmount with my mate and i said you know\nwhat i'd love to do this more\nand so i started building this plan\nwhere i heard the story of a guy who\nclimbed the highest peak of every\ncountry of europe\nhe didn't he went to do it in six months\nthe war broke out in kosovo and it took\nhim two and a half years instead\nand so i said i want to do the same\nthing i want to try and do it in six\nmonths and then i started planning\naround my long service leave in the army\nso in australia\nafter you work for 10 years you get six\nmonths off at half pay or three months\nat full\nand i um i was planning this trip and\nthen when i left the army i said i'm\nstill doing the trip i don't care i'm\ngoing to europe\nand then so this year because of how the\ntwitch stream turned out\ni caught instead of doing all the\nclimbing mountains i was still going to\nclimb some but i was going to more just\nsee the world\nand then kovid broke out and i spent\nnearly the entire time\nin the netherlands instead i see\ninteresting\ncan i think for a second go for it\nso past you sound different and what do\ni mean\nso what i'm really curious about is\nsometimes you know people wake up and\nthey say i want to do something\nand then that's as far as they get\nright they're like oh man it would be\ncool to climb mountains in europe\nand yet i'm already hearing something\nvery different about you because\nwhen you think about something you\nactually like\nkind of go out and do it yeah\num yeah my wife kind of helds me back\nsometimes with that\ni have these crazy ideas right so all\nlike when i started streaming i was like\nwhat if i like okay so most people won't\nknow but in escape from tarkov there was\nused to be like at level 40 everything\nwould start like that would be the end\nof the game\ni was like what if i did that in one\nsitting and my wife would sit there and\nbe like how are you going to do that\nlike i'll just not sleep i'll just keep\nplaying\nyou know and so then i when it happened\ni streamed for like literally\n40 hours straight and i did it you know\nlike most people would be like nah\nthat's just stupid why would you do that\nbut i'm like no i'll try it\nlike i don't like referring myself as\nto like someone like david goggins but\nlike his kind of mentality where it's\nif anyone doesn't know david goggins\nhe's just kind of the kind of person\nthat just\ni can run a hundred miles i don't know\nif i can physically but if i can't my\nbody's gonna be the one that stops me\nnot my mind you know like he'll push it\nto the right to the end\num and for me it's kind of very similar\nlike i said i say i want to do something\ni actually\ntry my best to do it and the only thing\nthat's going to stop me is if my body\nwon't let me kind of thing\ni try and let my mind yeah so so how\nlong have you been that way\ni don't know um i've always been the\nkind of person where\nif there was a fire people would run\nfrom it i'd be the one to run to it\nso um an example would be like\nuh people watch that 10 hour iar stream\nand people be like that's insane that\nsounds so horrible i'm like i want\nlike my feeling is i wonder what it\nfeels like to listen to iar for 10 hours\nstraight\nso then i go and do it i i don't know\nhow long it's been like that but\nfor a long time i've always kind of been\ni guess it's curious\nof what the world has to offer i i don't\nknow any other better ways of exploring\nexplaining it sorry yeah so it's\ninteresting so i literally just wrote\nthe word curiosity\nand and what i'm kind of thinking about\npast is that that you know so let's say\nthat like\nyou're not you right and i think this is\na\ncommon issue which is that most of the\npeople on twitch are not you\nand and what i'm kind of curious about\nis what can we learn from you is it just\nthat you're wired differently do you\njust i mean\ndid you just born you were born with the\nslightly insane curiosity hard-working\ntrait and and therefore there's\nsomething about your brain\nor your just you were born different\nwhich is why you\nlike you are where you are now and so\npeople who weren't born with that\nwill never be where you are i don't\nthink that's the case\ni think after my after finishing school\ni used to always look at my friends and\nthey would always want to do\nwhat i found was just mediocre or boring\nno one wanted\nto explore or have fun like my version\nof fun which is like let's\ngo and see what is over there or let's\ngo and do that and so\nthere is definitely a comfort zone that\npeople live in\nand i always had to push myself to go\ninto those\ndiscomfort areas um when i signed up to\njoin the military i had full intention\nto join special forces\num and my mate joined the army with me\nmy best mate at the time and in the\nlead up training to join in the army\nwhich there was no requirement to do any\nof this [ __ ] we did um\nwe would just find stuff to do that\nwould push ourselves mentally and\nphysically because we knew\nif we were to get into the special\nforces they're going to make us do the\nmost\ncraziest [ __ ] you could think of so like\nwe lived\nnear the surf beaches down in victoria\nare in australia and we'd be like\nalright it's a pretty choppy day let's\ngo swim out to the boy and back\nand i wasn't even a good swimmer but i\nwas like i'm doing it like because\nthat's what we did\num and one of my mates was really good\nwith that i think it's more of like an\nalpha male\nbeta male kind of thing sometimes um i\nnever really saw myself as an alpha male\ni was always a little bit of a follower\num before the army\nbut i kind of took my strive once i hit\nthe military side and i had to take\ncharge because i just saw how\ni don't use the word lazy but some\npeople are really lazy they find that\nlazy people can actually be really good\nbecause they can find the easiest way to\nget [ __ ] done quick because they just\nwant to get it done\nthey don't have to spend any time the\nmore time they have to um or they just\ndon't do it at all\ncorrect which is the most annoying time\nbut um\nbut yeah like a lot of people like to\nfind the easy way i try and find the\nright way\nyeah so how long have you been like that\nwhere does that come from\ni don't know i i don't know right so pes\ni i think the challenge here and if it's\nokay with you maybe we'll explore that a\nlittle bit because i think\ni'm still hearing i can i can imagine\nyou know who i was when i was 21 22 23\n24\nand listening to this conversation and\njust\nfeeling like i wish i was like you\ni'm not like you that you're lucky\nthat i have when everyone else runs away\nfrom the fire i want to be the guy that\nruns towards it\nbut unfortunately i'm like everyone else\nwhen i think about joining the special\nforces it's something that i want to do\nbut because i know they're going to put\nme through the hardest things\npossible instead of swimming out to the\nbuoy and back\ni'm just not going to get into the water\nat all\nthat's the guy that i am\nand i look at you and i say that you're\nnot like me\nand then what i would say is that here\nis a guy who is disciplined\nand i am a guy who is lazy and i would\ndefine you in one way and i would define\nmyself\nin a completely different way and i\nwould say if i was in your bucket then i\nwould be successful\nbut i'm in my bucket therefore i'm\nscrewed\ni'll tell you a story so when i signed\nup to be a reservist in the army i was\n19 years old\ni spent a bit of time away from home but\ni was never really extremely out of my\ncomfort zone when i went out\nout from home like you know what i mean\nlike when i went away it was always like\na little bit discomfort\nwhen i did my my basic training uh it\nwent for about 47 days\nand um i hated it i absolutely hated it\nand to the point where i contacted my\nmy parents and said i want to go home\nand i used to work for my stepfather\nand i said can you write me a letter to\nsay that i'll need it back at work\nbecause literally that's all you would\nrequire to go home\nlike if you you know the military had to\noblige by people's contracts of business\nand that\nso he wrote me a letter and i got the\nletter and\ni walked down this the hallway and\nknocked on the door of the corporals and\nand i said i need to speak to you know\nmy corporal and he he got me in the room\nand he goes what's this letter and i'm\nlike oh you know i need to go back home\nfor work\nand um he said i'm just going to talk to\nyou like a new normal human being here\nbecause they they would have that like\nyou know persona that they're always\nlike\nbig people goes i know this is full [ __ ]\ni know you don't want to be here\nbut if you quit this right now every\ntime something gets difficult in life\nyou are going to quit and you're not\ngonna you're not gonna finish it\nthis is the easy way out there's only\nthree weeks left\nand even if you hate the three weeks at\nleast at the end of it you can hold your\nhead up high and say\nyou done it it was [ __ ] but you did it\nand then when\nanything gets hard in life you can\nalways push through and finish it\nbecause of that\nnow i remember that guy's name exactly\nand i remember what he looks like and he\nprobably\ndoesn't even remember who i am but he is\nprobably one of the most influential\npeople in my life\nbecause from that point there i always\nkept that mentality i finished that\ntraining and i said this\nis this is something that i need to make\nsure i do because of that reason\nnow he might have just been talking [ __ ]\nhe might have been like\nyou know he got told to tell that thing\nbut it actually did have a big influence\non me\nthat one in particular um what was that\nsorry do you remember when he said that\ndo you remember how you felt\nprobably felt a little bit embarrassed\nat the time because i got called out you\nknow\nlike he called my bluff\nbut at the same time\ni felt like there was a bit more respect\nthere because he knew i was going to try\nand push through\nso i think that worked and i think later\non in particular\num because you go through like you're\ndoing field training and all that stuff\nthere was that little bit of like almost\nlike mutual respect there because he\nknew i was pushing through my discomfort\nso\nyeah it's interesting right\nyep that definitely is\nso i know this is going to sound kind of\nweird\npast i think it's a fantastic story\nperfect time to tell it\nbecause i think it says so much but what\ndo you think are the important points of\nthat story\nwhat are the takeaways\noh for me at the time at least and and\nto now it's like\num i guess in a metaphor you could\nprobably say\nanytime life gets tough it doesn't mean\nit's you can't get through it it's you\nneed to push\nyou can push through discomfort isn't\nalways\nyou know it doesn't mean it's not life\nisn't meant to be easy there's going to\nbe times that are tough and\ngetting through it you know is\nachievable if you\nreally want it yeah so you know oddly\nenough i'm going to kind of disagree\nwith you there\nbecause and follow me for a second okay\nit's not that i disagree that you're\nactually wrong but i'm going to take a\nslightly different approach\ndisagree is not the right word so what\nyou're saying is that you have it within\nyou to push through\nand then what i think about is all the\npeople who decided to submit the letter\nand walk away and then when we hear\npests say\nyou have it within you to not quit\na funny thing happens which is that you\nactually\nthat story i think is just as likely to\ncreate\nshame as it is to create inspiration\nbecause then what everyone does is they\nlook at you and they say pest is the guy\nwho decided to push through\nand i'm the guy who decided to not push\nthrough\nand you know just like you said your\ncorporal gave you a choice and he's like\nif you quit now\nyou're gonna be a quitter\nand i think that a lot of people end up\nquitting and now they think about\nthemselves as quitters and when you say\nif you really put your mind in to it you\nhave the capacity to push through\nwhich sounds inspirational but it's also\nkind of damning because that means that\nlike\nif you didn't push through you always\ncould have and it's your [ __ ] fault\nwhich i think is don't get me wrong but\ni think there's one really other\nimportant piece of the to the story\nwhich is that\nin that moment that corporal had faith\nin\nand what happened is someone you were a\nquitter when you walked into that office\nit wasn't actually like entirely you\nthat decided to not quit\nright your quitter you got the letter\nand everything\ncalled home figured out how to do it had\nthe letter in your hand you were like 99\npercent\nquitter and then the corporal looks at\nyou and he has he has faith\nhe looks at you and he says no [ __ ]\nand he says that i think you're not the\nperson because he could have just\naccepted the letter right he could have\nbeen like all right\nfine you have the letter adios but he\nlooked at you and he said\nyou know what i don't think even though\nyou've come 99\nyou're a 99 quitter i'm not willing to\naccept\nthat you're 100 of a quitter yet\ni think that within you there's someone\nwho's not a quitter\nand when you say you know he was one of\nthe most important people in your life i\nthink that's\nwhy right because like in that moment\nyou had become a quitter or you were\njust really really close\nyou'd set everything up to quit and then\nhere's one guy who says you know i just\ndon't think that\nthat's who you have to be i think you've\ngot a different option\nwhat do you think about that i think\nit's fair\ni've never really thought of it in that\nin that respect so\nand again and i guess it could it could\nbe damaging to people to feel like\nbecause\nif i had gone home then i probably would\nhave reflected it as\ni'm now a quitter for the rest of my\nlife and or i don't know if i would have\nbut it could have\nso it could be just as damaging as it is\ntrying to push someone through that\nit's it's hard also for me though\nbecause\na lot of the stuff you hear in the\nmilitary post that like after i went\nfull time in that there's a lot of talk\nlike that\nlike you know like uh\nyou know like pain is weakness leaving\nthe body\nlike all those kind of sayings where\nit's like\num you know they'll just try they'll\nliterally say anything to get you\nthrough something\nlike they will literally say anything to\nget you through something yep so\nyeah i think that's kind of an\ninteresting idea too because like i\nthink the point is that\nyou know they'll say anything to get you\nthrough but i think at the end of the\nday\nyou're the person who gets through it\nright i mean they can say pain is\nweakness leaving the body but like i\nmean they can say whatever they want to\nand it may help you psychologically for\na time but at the end of the day\nyou're the one that did it they can't do\nit for you they can say whatever the\n[ __ ] they want to trick you\nor push you but you're the one who has\nto do it and you're the one who\ndid do it which is awesome\ncan you tell us a little bit more about\num\nyou know what what it was like being in\nthe military\num there was\ni always i'll summarize it as there's a\nlot of boring times a lot of time where\nyou're literally sitting around and\nthere is\nnothing going on i want to like be 100\nstraight here i didn't spend any time in\nthe middle east i haven't seen any\ncombat\ni spent most of my time in southeast\nasia i speak indonesian\nas a linguist um and\ni spent most of my time in in training\nand exercises in australia so\nfor me it was mostly very boring sitting\naround\ntedious times and or\nvery physically demanding painful times\non my body\num where either i was in charge of\npeople that i had to push them through\nsituations that were quite difficult um\ni was\nmostly in a leadership role for most of\nmy time in the military\nwhere i was like either you know in\ncharge of soldiers or training people\nand\num it was it was probably\ni didn't like a lot of it but i did it\nbecause i know a lot of people\nwere very proud of me doing it um\nyou know like my mum or dad when i ever\ncalled him up and i was like you know\nlike i'm\nyou know thinking about ending in a year\nor so they'll be like oh but stable job\nit pays really well you get to see the\nworld and i'm like yeah it does but\nyou don't get to see you know fear of\nnot having a weekend\njust because it's you know your time to\ndo guard duty that they decide\nto give it to you on a friday or\nsomething like that there's a lot of\nreally really stressful times in the\nmilitary and i think that's why\na lot of people come out of the military\nlike exhausted looking 100 years older\nand then\nalso missing the friendships and the\ncamaraderie of it because\nthey always had their mates there\nwhereas when you leave it's a lot harder\nso it's a very very difficult place\nit's not for everyone what was it like\nto leave\nit was like i'd had a constant pressure\non my shoulders for a long time\nand it was finally off what was that\npressure\nwell i would argue i i wait for a\nmajority of the time in the career but\nlike in all seriousness it was i always\nfelt like someone was\nready to just tell me off for something\nor to send me away somewhere or\njust control full control over my life i\nquit the army\nand um my girlfriend at the time is now\nmy wife um\nshe she knew i was literally just\nquitting and i had no job lined up i was\ngoing\nto just put myself back into the society\nand just forget about a lot of the\nexperiences that i've been through\num that are just really been hard\non me so fast let me ask you a question\nyou know it's so interesting because you\nuse the word quit i just quit the army\nthe interesting thing is that i can i\ncan almost envision\nquitting is not like i think what would\nhave been quitting like spiritually\nquitting\nwould have been to stay does that make\nsense yeah\nthat sometimes quitting is like that's\nthe hard thing\nlike because at some point you know\nsticking in the staying\nin the life that you've become\ncomfortable in\na stable job good pay kind of\nrespectable\nyou know like all that kind of stuff\nlike walking away from that\nis actually the hard thing and and i'm\nalso hearing kind of a common thread\nhere which is that like\nyou know in your corporal's office you\nalso\nby staying you actually walked away from\nsomething\nyou walked away from a life of comfort\nright you could have peaced out could\nhave taken the easier road\nand you walked away from the easy road\nand oddly enough what i'm hearing about\neven though you used the word quit is\nthat you actually walked away from\nstability security something you had\nknown\nwithout anything in place that actually\nsounds like it takes\nit sounds hard not easy yeah most people\nthought i'd go back\nand like a large amount of people\nthought i'd be back in the military\nand why did they think that\ni'm very passionate about anything i do\nso i took a lot of pride\nin the work that i did in the military\num\ni had lined up a position where i would\nactually be a chinese translator as well\nwhere i'd learn chinese and\ni was i was trying to line up a few\nthings that would probably get me\ninto like say embassy positions later on\nin my career\nlike i wasn't going to just be sitting\ndown the bottom runs like forever i\nactually was pretty ambitious\num so everyone had always seen how hard\nworking and passionate i was about the\njob\nbut as soon as i quit and as soon as i\nresigned\nand i went into a new path and i could\nput my passion into something else well\ni think the evidence is clear how when i\nreally am passionate about something how\nfar i can take it so\ni think the military if anything was\nactually holding me back\non my potential more than anything and\nhow did you come to decide to leave\num i had an\nargument with the ceo\nwhich was pretty much the deciding\nfactor um i\nwas meant to be studying chinese in\nmelbourne um\nthat year and due to controls from like\ncareer management they stuffed up and i\nwas got pushed back one year\nand so then i had to resubmit the form\nthe following year then i did it as soon\nas i started the year and then\nthe ceo didn't approve it and i said why\ndidn't you approve it and he says you\nwere in an infantry hat badge or an\ninfantry\nsoldier for life and i'm like i'm not\ngoing to be treated like that anymore\ni'd i'd been putting up with that kind\nof\nbs for a long time and i was like i\ni'm going to do anything else and then\nas soon as i resigned and put my\ndischarge paperwork in\ntwo months later i had a posting order\nsaying that i'm going to melbourne to do\nchinese studies and i said nope i've\nmade my decision i'm going\nso\ncan i process that for a second yep\npass i i when you tell these stories i\nthink about moments from my own life\nand it's interesting i think you know\nsome people talk about\nsuccess as taking advantage of good\nopportunities\nmy experience has been that success is\nwalking away from good opportunities\nyou know when when they give you\neverything that you want to\nbeing able to say you know what no thank\nyou\ni'm gonna do it my own way um\nit's interesting i have a story very\nmuch like your corporal story too\num but wow that's that's impressive man\nso can\nwhat would you when you when they gave\nyou that paperwork or gave you the\noption to go study chinese in melbourne\ndo you remember how you felt\num i expected it i i i expected it\nthey they they called me into the\nbattalion hq and they were they said\nuh we've got your posting order here and\nwe've got your discharge paper\ndo you want to throw your discharge\npaper out now that we've got your\nposting order and\ni said no but it wasn't the big bosses\nthat were telling me that that was the\nclerks\nbut i walked straight out and i was just\nlike that's so typical like i knew that\nwas gonna happen\nbecause what's typical about that uh\nso the military will what they do is\nthey\nit's a numbers game it's all about they\nneed to kick all their quotas all their\nboxes for promotions and and their\ntheir career progressions so for the ceo\nit's for him it's about\nthe first thing he needs to do is get so\nmany people through all their\nyou know all the officers need to get\nall their quotas done for the year et\ncetera et cetera and it goes\nit trickles down right and then the\nworst thing they can have is\nlow retention rate so first thing they\nwant to do is they want to kick all\ntheir boxes so they need as many\nsoldiers to do that\nbut then the worst thing after that is\nto you know lose their corporals because\nit's hard to get good corporals i i\nconsider myself a good corporal when i\nwas one or so\num and so then me\nleaving the military after eight years\nand uh due for promotion and stuff\nit's just you know it's just so easy for\nthem to go oh we'll just you know now\nthat\nyou know he's called our bluff we'll\njust do that\nso i i didn't fully expect it but i said\nthere's a i thought there was a pretty\nhigh chance\nthat it was actually going to happen and\nand why didn't you take the posting\num i'm kind of the person that when they\nmake their decision to do something and\nstart a new thing i'm going to go for\nthe new thing a new exciting route of\nfishing and computer games\ncan you help me understand what decision\nyou made when\nyour ceo denied your application\num i called up my girlfriend and said\num the ceo didn't approve it and\nin the past when they've done that they\num\ngenerally don't uh they don't\nthey don't post you once the ceo says no\nso i said to her\ni said i'm not going to stay in the\ninfantry any longer my shoulders are\ncooked\nlike legitimately my shoulders are just\ndestroyed and i'm not going to break my\nback\nfor you know in the infantry if i do for\na core transfer that could take\na year and that's if it even happens i'm\nnot gonna i don't i didn't want to stick\naround with that anymore i wanted to\nmove into intelligence something using\nmy head instead of my body\nand so i said that i'll try something\nnew\nand we just started a plan which at the\nmoment at that point she didn't even\nhave a job\num or she was working part-time and i\nwas like all right well i'm gonna\nquit so we need to like start applying\nfor jobs together\nand uh she got a really good job and uh\nyeah we just went with it\nsounds like you were like you said the\nweight on your back it sounds like\ncontrol like it sounds like you\nwere tired of not having control over\nwhere your life went\ncorrect yeah 100 and so what was it like\nafter you left\nit was it was a little bit\ni i would always want to work like i'm\ni'm not the kind of person that can just\nlay on the couch for a couple of days\nlike maybe one or two days but the third\nday i'm like i need to do something so\ni was like trying to find little odd\njobs to do to help people out if anyone\nneeded a hand with anything i went\num back to victoria just for a week to\nbuild a retaining wall for my mum\nlike i just whatever i could do i would\njust do but in the in the\nother times i'd either be playing\ncomputer games to you know find friends\nor\ni went fishing tell me about fishing\num it's really good i don't i\nfor me it's i'm not very good fisherman\ni want to be really clear right now i'm\nnot a good fisherman at all i just like\nthe idea that\ni'm out in the water on a boat i can\njust relax\nit's like freedom like there's nothing\naround\nand i can who knows what's going to come\nup i could get\nyou know like some massive tuna or i\ncould get like a little kind of\nshitty you know bait fish kind of thing\nit doesn't really matter to me it's just\nabout\nthe adventure and fun of being out there\nyou know pasta once again noticing i'm\nhearing you say a lot of things that\nmake me think that\nwe're fundamentally different people so\nwhen you say\nyou know after two or three days of\nlaying around on the couch i need to get\nup and do something\nwhereas in my experience two or three\ndays is just getting started\nforced relaxation is hard for me like\nit's my mind is always ticking\nyeah i have a kind of random question\nhave you ever\nwondered whether you have like 80d\num no not really\nyeah interesting um so it sounds like\nyou kind of get restless and bored\neasily\nyeah i'd say that okay\ni feel like i have a lot of ideas in my\nhead and i\ni i've gotten better at writing them\ndown uh i used to want to start a stream\ni used to have a notebook and pen right\nnext to me\nand i used to write everything\nphysically down but now i use a a\nprogram instead\num but\ni'm the kind of person like i i just\nlike my most creative\nperiods are like when i'm laying in bed\nin the shower\njust doing those really mundane me like\ni'm i've got a an exercise bike behind\nme like when i'm on on the bike\nlike when i'm just zoned out that's when\nmy head's just gone crazy with all these\nrandom ideas\nand then when i'm in work mode it's just\nlike go go go\nso yeah i'm\ntrying to figure out how to pull\ncertain i think there are a couple of\nimportant principles here\nabout you know idleness of the mind\nspending time in nature um\nhow to go go so like here's just one\ntidbit for example so i think a lot of\npeople once again what i'm envisioning\nuh pest is that as people hear this\nconversation they\ni find themselves thinking more and more\ni find myself thinking if i were them\nthinking that oh this guy's like i'm\njust different from him\ni'm not someone that can go go my\nproblem is that i can't go go go\nmy problem is that i go and then the\nother three goes don't happen\ni stop it's not go go it's a go stop\nstop\nand and so i'm and the more that you\nkind of speak about the way that your\nmind functions\ni'm thinking that like your solutions\nare not going to work for them because\nyou're just a different kind of person\nyou know they can get behind some things\nlike they're bored easily too\nthey also get curious i think they also\nhave a lot of thoughts in their head\nbut all it ever stays is thoughts in the\nhead\nso how do you get from being\ndisorganized and having a bunch of\nthoughts\nto going going going do you have a sense\nof that\ni i i know exactly everything you're\nsaying\nis the question how do i make these\nthoughts go into action\nyes\ni i bounce a lot of ideas off my my wife\nbut\nin before her i would always just\ni would just think about the process of\nhow that would actually happen\nso for example climbing mountains across\neurope\ni would think of all right what are they\nwhat are the ways i could\nhire a buy a car i could sleep in the\ncar i could backpack\ni could and i would just go think about\nall those options and then i would just\nslowly just broaden my ideas on\nother people's experiences or what\nthings that could actually work there's\na guy who\nhe traveled from somewhere in europe i\ncan't remember exactly\naround the world and it cost him like\ntwo thousand dollars and he just\nbackpacked and you know hitchhiked and\nworked on people's boats to get from\ncountry to country he just did whatever\nhe had to do\nlike almost like a nomad kind of person\nlike\nthere is a wealth of information out\nthere if you're willing to just go to\nthe effort of researching it and then\ni don't know i just try and figure out\nways to make it happen\nand i suppose taking the first step is\nprobably the hardest point and then once\nyou take the first step then you kind of\nif you go into it by the mindset of you\nwhen you start something you're going to\nfinish it\nwell now you've got no choice you've got\nto keep going so i don't think the first\nstep is the hardest step\ni mean so sorry i i agree that taking\nthe first step is the hardest step i\nthink the problem is that\ntaking the first step is not one step\nit's a thousand steps\nthere's a thousand steps between step\nzero\nand step one and if we listen to you\nthat's what we hear\nright you have an idea and then you\nthink about the how\nyou externalize the idea you discuss the\nidea you call it broadening your\nexperience\ncan i draw you a diagram\nyep and apologies i'm curious i'm going\nto try to hypothesize something\nand i'm curious whether you think that\nthis is accurate or not\nbecause the basic issue is you\nbeautifully put it is how does an\nidea become an action and i think pestly\nwhen we look at you\nwhat we see is a guy for whom idea and\naction are very close together\nand when i look at most of the the\npeople that like are my people or people\nlike me\nwhat i see is that there's a big gap\nbetween idea and action\nso the issue is how does an idea become\nan action\nhow does an idea become a reality\nand i want to i want to toss something\nout and see if you would agree\nokay i am i could use heaps of the\nexamples where most people would look at\nme and go\nthat's crazy like i already decided i\nwas going to raise a million dollars for\nstarlight before my channel took off\nlike a starlight also it's a children's\ncharity in australia\nso um last year in december i\nsat down my wife and i said i want to do\nsomething good with this channel i want\nto give back\nand i said next year let's raise a\nmillion dollars for starlight children's\nfoundation australia\nand then the end of the year i had a\nmassive um\ni've had a drops event on on on my game\nand and my channel blew up\neven more than it already was and so\nthen i spent this whole year\njust devising different ways on how we\ncould raise money and we hit\na million dollars in seven months\ninstead of taking the whole year\nlike i don't know like stuff like that\nwhere i just think of it and i go how\nwould i\ncould i do this is it feasible like is\nit possible\nand once i know it's possible then i\njust go all right what are the steps we\nneed to take and i go for it\nlike right so so i think i think there's\na subtle so\nso this is the problem pest is that a\nlot of people think about the steps that\nthey take\nand then you go for it and we don't\nit's too much too many steps\nso i think you're cognitively doing\nsomething very interesting\nokay so let's say you have an idea and\nyou apology you can see this right\nyep okay so generally speaking here's\nwhat happens when we have an idea\nwe get bored of it just like you do okay\nwe're not disagreeing that you don't get\nbored\nwe'd get bored you get bored this idea\nturns into other ideas so idea number\ntwo\nidea number three idea number four\nright and then we think about this for a\nlittle while and this is idea number ten\nidea number six idea number 12.\nand then tomorrow comes and nothing\nhappens you with me\ndoes that make sense yeah it does okay\nso let's think about so that's us here's\nyou\nso you get bored of idea as well i know\nit sounds weird\nand then what happens is you actually\nhave a second idea\nbut\nbut your idea is how\ndoes idea number one work\nand then what you do is you talk to\npeople\nabout idea number one and then you\nalso\nexternalize idea number one\ni i don't know if this makes sense but\ndo you see how talking to people\nabout traveling is not the same as\nthinking about traveling\nwhen you get it makes it real it makes\nit actually an\naction actually thing instead of just a\nthing inside the mind\nit's now in i want to use the word\nuniverse but it's actually\npeople have now been involved in it as\nwell\nsure so i think that also is especially\ntrue for for this one over here which is\nabout externalizing\nbut what i what i want you to notice is\nthat like if you think about the\ncognitive action or the cognitive\ninterest about thinking about something\nand talking to someone about it\nthose are like fundamentally things you\ncan get bored of thinking about\nsomething\nand you can go to talk to someone about\nit and it'll be interesting if you talk\nto them\ndoes that make sense correct yep\nthe interesting thing is at the end of\nall of these\nyou come back to idea number one\ndoes that make sense yeah so whereas\nthis person ends up with like you know\nspending\na little bit of their time on ideas two\nthree four five six seven eight nine ten\neleven twelve\nyou still have a different cognitive\naction here\nyou don't get bored if you're thinking\nabout if you're doing research on the\ninternet\nand then you talk to someone and then\nyou jot things down on a piece of paper\ncognitively it's not the same as just\nthinking about it\nso it's cognitively i think fresh enough\nto where you get curious about it\nyou get curious here and then you\nmaintain your curiosity by actually\nchanging up\nthe cognitive action in the second step\nand the cool thing is that\neach of these actually goes and\nreinforces the same idea\nand so now for your second iteration\nidea number one\nis like twice as strong and then you do\nyou\nexternalize some more you like take\nnotes about it\nand then you talk to person number two\nabout idea number one\nand then you do some more research\nand so what happens is that at the end\nof the day\nyou're still reinforcing the same idea\nwhereas this person\nkeeps branching off idea number 86\nidea number 100 and there's no way to\nreinforce\non your original idea does that make\nsense yep it does\nand so i think that when we think about\nyou know if you get bored of things\neasily you're doing something very very\ncool\nwhich is that you're i would call this\nprocess in sanskrit this is something\ncalled sangha\nsangha actually means community and what\npeople discover when it comes to\nmeditation\nis if you try to meditate by yourself\nit'll fizzle out in like three days\nthat's how much energy you have\nand then it's over the interesting thing\nis that if you meditate\nand then you're part of a community then\nyou talk to someone\nabout meditation you're like oh like how\ndo you meditate this is the way that i\nmeditate\nyou join a group and you guys all\nmeditate together\nand then you read about meditation or\nyou go to a lecture\nwhat this does is at the end of the day\nthis\nreinforces meditation\neven though you're going to get bored of\nthis activity\na conversation can be okay you're going\nto hang out with other people and you're\ngoing to read about it\nand it reinforces the same activity and\nso essentially what sangha lets you do\nis maintain what we would call focus\nbut the interesting thing is if you get\ndistracted easily how do you focus\nand i want you guys to really pay\nattention to what pastel is doing\nbecause pest gets bored easily of things\ntoo\nthe only difference is that when he gets\nbored easily\nhe does things that naturally get him\nexcited about stuff\nokay and now i'm going to give you guys\none last example\nso let's say you play what what games do\nyou play\nuh escape from targov is the main one\nit's a first person shooter\nso let's say you're playing escape from\ntarkov you get bored of eft\nright but then what happens if you\nwatch a stream\nyou read a strategy so one of the one of\nthe questions i always get is how do i\nnot get bored of tarkov\ni get it all the time but the thing is\ni don't get bored because i always just\ndo different stuff\nabsolutely so you took took it right\ntook\ngot the punch line right yeah yeah\nit's not everyone thinks it's just this\nbut i want you guys to pay attention to\nwhat pesta is doing\nbecause pest isn't just doing eft he's\ndoing eft\nand then like side activity one\nright let's do a 40 hour stream that's\nactually a different idea\nand then let's do let's write a guide\nabout it\nno you're 100 right because i do guides\nand then i do like\ni don't know i'll do a challenge on\nmyself or i'll play the game with only\nusing one gun\nor whatever like i just do random stuff\nall the time\nright i never get bored of talk of no\nbut see here's the thing right so when\nthey look at you and they say how do you\nnot get bored of tarkov\nyou do get bored of tarkov and then you\ndo different things\nthat maintain your focus in one\ndirection\nso i think past the reason that you're\nsuccessful\nis because your mind maintains focus in\na single direction\nthe reason you're successful is because\ninstead of building\n10 wells that are one foot deep\nyou actually build one well that is 100\nfeet deep\nbut the tricky thing cognitively is like\nhow do you do that if you get bored\neasily\nyou just i i don't know the well analogy\nkind of falls apart but it's like sort\nof like you use different tools to dig\nthe same well\nit's like today i'm going to use a spade\nand now i'm going to use a shovel\nand now i'm going to use it because it's\nso it's actually different activities\nbut all of those activities are aligned\nin the same direction\nso what do you think about that does\nthat make\nwould you agree disagree yeah no i\ntotally agree\nokay so once again this is what i\ndiscovered about my life so i'm going to\ngive you guys just an example\nso first i was a monk or not not really\na monk\nbut i wanted to become a monk right so i\nstudied yoga and i was like oh like i\nwant to understand\nokay here's here was my here's here's\nhow i started out\nso i was like this is\nand let me know if i'm boring you okay\nfast no i'm good okay so this is where i\nstarted\ni suck at life because that's what it\nwas i sucked at life\nlike life is hard i'm a bad player life\ni was like okay how does that work\nokay gotta do something so i went to the\nashram\nand i was like oh interesting this\nis how people\nwork okay that's what i discovered\nand then it was sort of like but i still\nwent back to okay\noh this is\nhow i suck at life\nfollowing me i sort of figured out like\nhow i suck at life i was like oh\ninteresting\nso it's actually the same thing\nbut now i have a how and then i was like\nokay well let's figure out how the\nneuroscience of this works\nso i started doing like eeg research\nwhat's aug electro encephalogram\nmeasuring brainwave patterns\nokay on meditation\nright and i was like okay so like that's\nthe how\nand then went to med school\nokay and then i was like okay like\ninstead of saving lives\ni decided to like become a psychiatrist\nbecause you know i wanted to know how i\nsuck at life\nand now so now it's like okay this\nis how other\npeople suck\nat life sometimes it's illness that's\nwhat my psychiatric training taught me\nsometimes it's lack of direction\nsometimes it's lack of dharma so this is\nwhat india taught me\nbut at the end of the day do you do you\nsee how it's like it's all the same\nthread\nit's all the same thing it's like how\ndoes life work\nbut i get distracted really easily\nright that's how you keep your focus\nabsolutely\ni keep my because i don't actually keep\nmy focus\nit's bizarre i how does\nlife work okay so this is where i sort\nof end up\nand this question was born because i\nsucked i was like how does this\nhow this stuff work i don't understand i\ndon't understand how\nwhat's the deal with life and now like\neven today so now what do i do because i\nget bored easily\nso i stream on twitch i do clinical\nmedicine\nthis is my favorite part now i get to do\nthe teaser\nand then oh hold on no no there we go\nso this is what i do in my free time\nright so like this is my understanding\nof depression\nignore this stuff over here but then i\nsit down and i map out like okay how\ndoes depression work there's clinical i\ndon't know i guess you guys can't see\nthat\nbut anyway so this is what i do so like\nthis is what i do in my free time\ni write about depression i think about\ndepression i dictate about depression\nand then i work with people and i stream\nand we do all these different things\nbecause i get bored easily\nso it's like if i see patients for 30\nhours a week i get bored\nif i stream for like 10 hours a week i\nget bored\nand i'm hearing you do the same thing\nand so i think the big takeaway for\npeople and i know i'm supposed to be\nasking you questions but i think\npast you're too good of an example of\nthis principle\nthat you're not i mean i do think you're\ndifferent in some ways don't get me\nwrong\nwhich i think is awesome but i think\nthat people can still learn that\nwhat i want you guys to see is that like\nsure pest\nwhen he rises when a challenge faces him\nhe doesn't back down which is awesome\ndon't get me wrong and we'll talk a\nlittle bit about that but one thing that\ni want you guys to notice\nis that i think there's a reason why\npest knocks it out of the park\nin multiple parts of his life\nright because that's what we're hearing\nyou're a dude who climbs mountains it\nsounds like you\nkind of were climbing in the military\nand you could have continued to climb\nyou've become a successful\ntwitch streamer and what i really think\nit is and i don't know how else to\nexplain this but it is what you do with\nyour mind\nbecause i don't know if you guys get\nthis but most of success or failure in\nlife has nothing to do with your\nphysical body\nmost of it has to do with your mind\nright call it studying call it your job\ncall it relationships\ni know some people think that they're\nphysically unattractive and sure that\ncan get in the way\nbut it's like what you do with your mind\nthat's the most important\nand what i hear is that pest has\ndiscovered\na way to align his mind\ntowards a common goal despite deviating\nthis way in that\nand what he does i don't know how to put\nsay this but he like\nsoaks his mind in\nexposures that move him in the direction\ntowards a common goal\nhe goes and he talks to this guy and\nthen he reads about this thing\nhe immerses himself which we\nthink means that he he's like his mind\nis super focused but it's not\nit's just when his mind wanders he lets\nit wander\nbut he lets it wander in a general\ndirection\nand i think an example would be yeah um\nlike when i started my twitch stream\nand i started like to figure out how the\ntwitch universe worked and how to become\nsuccessful\ni was like oh you know um twitch doesn't\nhave the greatest discoverability so\nwhat i need to do is i need to start a\nyoutube channel oh how do i start a\nyoutube channel and then i was like oh\ni'll\nyou know start creating videos and so i\nliterally just\nthrew myself at adobe for like three\ndays straight and in three days i pretty\nmuch taught\nmyself how to make youtube videos so i\nstarted making youtube videos and i just\nkind of like just\ni and what i like to do a lot of is i i\ntry something\ntest it and if it fails i don't stress\ntoo much about it because it's either a\nlesson learnt\nor maybe i just implemented it wrong or\nin a poor way and i could just\nuse it in a different way at a different\ntime or maybe it was it was too big of\nan idea\ntoo early in the career or something\nlike that like i\ni try and treat everything like a bit of\na lesson learnt or how maybe\ni'm not afraid to fail as well that's i\nlook like an idiot half the time on\nstream anyway with some of the stuff i\ndo like i dressed up as a therapist from\nthe game\nyou know like and i just i don't care if\npeople like it's been on seven news in\naustralia\nlike that stream and it's just like i\njust have fun with it i just try and\nenjoy it\nso why don't you mind failure how long\nhave you\nnot cared about failure um\nas long as i'm confident that i did the\nbest i can do\nwithin realistic like measures then i\nit doesn't affect me as much as i\nprobably\ni might affect most people i don't know\nwhy it's the case but\nhow long have you been that way\num i'd say a fair while\ni were you that at least before okay\nbefore you joined the military\nit probably was in the lead-up to the\nmilitary i\ni remember a period before the military\nwhere\ni was very self-conscious a lot of\nthings i did and i was like\ni wanted to become a better person i\nremember for a fact i wanted to become a\nbetter person because i was just like\nyou know people would do cool stuff and\ni was like why can't i do it\ni was very like self-conscious of that\nstuff\num i kind of remember what i used to\nlisten to in that\nbut it was just like i used to watch\nlike\num i think it might have been just\nbefore youtube because there was other\nwebsites but\nit used to be like videos that you could\nwatch you know as people just talking\nabout how to become the best person they\ncan be and\nand part of it was that there's like the\nphysical you know\nphysically fit part of your body and\nalso the mental so you strengthen your\nmind and your body so i used to work out\na lot\ni used to like bodybuild not for a\ncompetitive side\nbut more of just like i just wanted to\nbe the fittest strongest person i could\nbe\nand i used to be really strong and fit\nlike i still got a lot of muscle mass\nbut\nlike i still look after myself but then\nit was the same with the mental side and\nthe mental part was the hardest part to\ntrain\nthan the body the body was easy you just\ngo to gym five days a week you got two\nrest days it's all good\nwhereas you've got a measurable well\nyou've got a measurable weight it's like\nyou go to the gym\nand you can do it where the mind is it's\nit you can get lost in the mind really\nlike um and it's a lot easier just to be\nlike oh i won't worry about that today\nor\ni don't know i found that's how i found\nit\nthere was definitely a period between\nlike 18 and 21 when i went full time in\nthe military before when i went\nfull time in the military i was very\ni felt like i was older than the\nmajority of people around me\nbecause i felt like i'd developed my\nmind more\nas in in a maturity level than a lot of\nthe other people\num about a year before i joined i lost\nmy life license i know it was about\na little bit less than a year a little\nbit less than a year before i joined\ni lost my license to drink driving and\num\nit wasn't like i wasn't like heaps over\ni think i was 0.08 so in america i think\nthat's legal\num but i had a little bit of shame\nbehind it but after that i\ndidn't drink for a long time like three\nyears i didn't really drink\nand i saw all my mates getting really\ndrunk in that and i'm like i'm gonna go\nto the gym and i'm gonna skateboard and\nyou know do all the things that i enjoy\nand a lot of people are pushing\nlike they were all always about the\npartying side and i was more about let's\ngo explore and have fun and adventure\nkind of side so i don't know\nthat's a bit of a tangent sorry no no i\nappreciate it i\ni'm i'm glad you're sharing this because\ni think it once again tells us that\njust go to the gym five days a week has\nbeen damn near an impossibility for me\nmy entire life\num is is i'll put a question to you\nif is is it because it's not a priority\nlike okay let me put it in this\nperspective like if\nlike you don't a lot of people say they\ndon't have time to do something\nright but if you got home and you're\nlike i don't have time to go to the gym\nbut\nwhat if like you got home and your\ndishwasher or\nyour toilet was leaking all over the\nfloor well now you have time to call a\nplumber\nto fix the toilet right yeah whereas\nbeforehand you had no time to go to the\ngym well it's i don't\nsee it not having enough time ever as an\nexcuse\ni see it as it's not a priority i agree\ncompletely\ni didn't say i don't have enough time to\ngo to the gym i said i'll just use\nan example of yeah a lot of people use\nthat i don't have time thing and i'm\nlike\nbut it's just not a priority yeah so in\nmy experience\ni'm someone who would much rather\nhave gone to the gym than go to the gym\nyep and you know i\nsort of take care of myself i could take\ncare of myself better\nbut i agree with you that in my case\nit's an issue of priority\nbut i i think you know it's interesting\npast because i think there are some\nthings we can learn from you\nand there are some things that you say\nthat make me think that like some of\nthis may be a little bit more intrinsic\ni think there are a couple of really\nreally important anyway so let me ask\nyou a couple other\nquestions that okay yeah and then i'll\ntry to\ntry to sort of summarize a little bit in\na second but there are a few minutes\nso can you tell us so it sounds like it\nwas sort of a rough transition from\nleaving the military and like sort of\nstarting to stream on twitch can you\ntell us about that\nit was more of a rush rough transition\nbecause i didn't know what i wanted to\ndo\num i knew what i enjoyed but\ni didn't like the pressure i put on my\nmy girlfriend\nwho's now my wife at the time that i\nwasn't making any money and she was the\nonly person making money paying all the\nbills\ni did have a little bit of money saved\nit wasn't like i didn't contribute\nanything\num and\nalso not having a lot of friends um a\nlot of my friends either in the military\nhad moved\nback home to where they were from or\nbeen posted different states\nand a lot of the friends that i grew up\nwith live back in a different state\nso we were living in south australia\nwhich\nwe moved to the middle of nowhere like\nit was three hours or two hours from the\ncity\num so i needed to\nre i had to push myself back into\nsociety in ways and i joined the lawn\nbowls\nteam lorne bowles is like botchy but on\ngrass\nfor anyone who doesn't know what it is\num where everyone plays when they're\nretired no one's under the age of like\n60. so like but the coolest thing is\nthey're the people that know all the\nfishing tips and tricks and spots so\nkind of worked out well with that but um\nso yeah that was i started streaming to\nliterally make friends and i made a heap\nof friends\npretty quick most of them moderators now\nor they might have moved on to different\nthings but\nit's been nice so were you feeling\nlonely\num\nmaybe a little bit maybe a little bit\nnot a lot like i wasn't like i need to\ngo find friends\nright now but i definitely why so help\nme understand why\nbecause you make it sound like the\nprimary reason to stream was to make\nfriends\nso why did you feel like it because a\nlot of times loneliness\nand maybe there's a lesson to be learned\nhere when i think about people who are\nhungry for friends i sort of assume for\na moment that they're lonely\nbut what i'm hearing from you is not\nnecessarily that you were lonely but you\nwere still very\nintentional about making friends so\ni love playing computer games i really\nenjoy playing computer games\ni can't play a computer game for more\nthan probably an hour before i'm bored\nif i'm not playing with friends so when\ni've got a\nchat i can play all day there's no issue\nwith that\nwhen i started streaming like literally\nall my friends were married with kids\ndidn't play computer games anymore\nthey'd all moved on from the gaming\nscene like nearly no one i played\ncomputer games with when i was younger\nstill plays computer games\nso i wanted people that enjoyed the same\ngames as me to just find to play games\nand\nand have good chats and play till three\nin the morning four in the morning and\nall that kind of stuff but um i still\nhad\nfriends but not ones that i could either\nhang out with or play computer games\nwith\nso you started streaming just sort of to\ntry to find people to game with\nand to talk to during the day yeah\nand then when did you start to think\nabout this as a career\num so that was in october i started\ndoing that in january\ni went on a big drive along the east\ncoast of australia with my wife\nand we um\ni don't know i maybe had like 15 20 subs\nand something like that\nand i was like i actually feel like i\nunderstand how the platform works\num i've done by that stage i've done a\nbit of research and stuff and i didn't\nreally\nstream that whole month and i said i\nwant to\ngive it a give it a solid crack i want\nto give it like a year or two years\num and i'll just go really hard i'll\nthrow everything i can at it and i'll\njust want to see\nwhere it goes and it sounds weird but\ni said if i could get maybe 2 000\nfollowers because by the way i was like\ni'm going to sell my house\nto go to europe like i was legitimately\nhappy to sell my house to move to\ntravel europe i said if i can get 2 000\nfollowers that might be interested in my\ntravels through europe\nand i can like maybe fund it some way\nthrough that\nthen you know it could be all worth it\nand so\nyeah i started streaming in hope to get\n2 000 followers before i got to europe\nhow did you decide to go to you so you\ndecided that you were gonna go to europe\nand climb\nin 2012 and when did you start streaming\non twitch\n2017\nso what were you doing when were you in\nthe military\nfrom 2009 to 2017.\ni see okay so you started streaming on\ntwitch in 2017.\nand when did it become really like a\ncareer for you or a job\n2018 and what happened around that time\num that's when i went on that drive with\nmy wife and we decided i'm going to give\nit a go and then that's why i\nstarted taking it more serious i just\nstarted working as a part-time paid fire\nfighter so i had\nsome sort of income as well so it wasn't\njust my wife making all the money but\num it really took off pretty quick to be\nhonest\nwhat's your understanding of that within\ntwo months i was partnered\ni think two to three months and then the\ngraph\nis hasn't really slowed down\nwhat's your understanding of why that\nhappened\ni feel like i'm a friendly person i\nthink my whole\nmy whole basis is the fact that we're\njust a bunch of like-minded people that\njust enjoy computer games and i'm not\nthe best at the game but\ni just want to invite anyone who wants\nto have\nfriends or make friends the people that\nlike we've got a common interest escape\nfrom tarkov\nlike i play a lot of other games now at\nthe moment but\neveryone that pretty much jumps into my\nchannel likes escape from tarkov\nyou're not judged on anything but what\nyou say in chat and your name\nthat's pretty much all they can judge\nyou on and you know where you're from in\nthe world doesn't matter you can just\nwe can hang out we can talk and we're\njust a big community\nand i've been big on just a community\naspect like\ni promote streams in the tarkov category\ni know like a lot of most\nmost streamers and categories on twitch\nthey don't promote other channels like\nnot very often\ni'll literally be talking about another\nstreamer and be shouting them out during\nthe stream all the time or\ni used to do it a lot more than now but\num\ni i'm more than happy for everyone to be\nsuccessful i feel like if the category's\na really healthy category then it just\npromotes all channels and grows all\nchannels anyway so\nwhy not have a good community across\ntwitch a cool thing i've been doing of\nmore recent\nis when i do a big event like a\nstarlight charity event i actually have\nintermission periods so say the stream\ngoes for 12 hours at the four and eight\nhour mark i'll get\num a streamer from the music section a\nprofessional musician\nand i'll play on my stream for 10\nminutes and it advertises their stream\nbut gives 10 minutes of music\nentertainment to my to to my community\nso it's it's gives me a break i get 10\nminutes to just drink some water and sit\nback\nlisten to cool music i love it i think\ntwitch is an amazing platform and we\nshould all try and push everyone\ntogether to grow\nas well yeah i can see why you've been\nrising\nand growing i think it's really awesome\npes to the way that you\ntalk about your experience on twitch the\nway that you know people use this word\nwholesome a lot\nbut i i think you know you're there\nbecause you love the game and you love\nthe community\num and it sounds fantastic man\nso you mentioned that you had a\ngirlfriend and now your wife\nso it sounds like you guys have been\ntogether for a little while\num just about five years now can you\ntell do you mind if i ask a few\nquestions about her\nyeah within reason like i i sure\ni'll save it yeah just let me know um\nbecause i you know i like we when we\nkind of think about the corporal\nfor example and just sort of how him\nbeing authentic with you and sort of\nlike how you guys kind of had that\nmutual respect as you put it i'm\nnoticing that\nin your life you're not playing single\nplayer\nright you partied up and and the\nquestions that i have about your\ngirlfriend or wife aren't really so much\nabout like you know her but more about\nher influence on you is that\nfair you think that's okay yep okay yeah\nso can you tell us just a little bit\nabout\num how you all met oh we met on tinder\nactually\nwhich is like most people don't find\nrelationships on tinder but i did um\nyeah the actual meeting story is pretty\nfunny but um\nyeah we just we she actually i messaged\nher and she said i'm really busy right\nnow can you talk\nto me in two weeks and said sure i said\nsure and i waited two weeks to the day\nand messaged\nher and she was surprised so um it kind\nof went from there\nbut um yeah we dated for\nthree or four months and then we became\nofficial and\ni don't know we've just had a really\nopen dialogue for majority of our\nor for our whole relationship really can\nyou tell us a little bit about\nhow the relationship has intertwined\nwith\nyour life\num sorry it's a bad question\num i was just kind of thinking so i i\nget the sense that she's actually like\nvery supportive of you\nand 100 i would not be anywhere near\nthis successful without her\nyeah so tell can you help us understand\nthat for a second\num well she was willing to put up the\ncrazy idea that i wanted to share my\ntwitch\nuh full time that that was um pretty\nfull on i actually tried to push her out\nof her job\nto help me once it started getting\nbigger and she wanted to\nfinish um her contract and she decided\nthat\njust i needed more help so she actually\nfinished up a little bit early to help\nme\num just because there was that much\ngoing on but pretty much anything that's\never happened with my stream\nshe's known about it at the same time\ni've thought about it because i'd be\nlike hey\ni've got this idea can we do this and\nshe'd be like how are you going to make\nit work and i'm like\nyou know and she's like maybe like don't\ndo that bit but everything else will\nwork\nall right cool you know and it's been\nvery much like that from the very start\nand\ni'd have an idea because pestilence\nbased off the word pestilence\num and so you know like the plague\ndoctor for example so like i played the\nlong game you know with the coronavirus\ni started planning this whole plague\nmass thing\ntwo years in advance so um she helped\nmade all the logo and all that and she's\ngot a she's a really creative\nlike as in artist creative person which\nis really cool\num and so yeah like all those kind of\nideas\nwould go to her at some point\nand then yeah i had to develop onto the\nstream\nshe's been amazingly supportive i don't\nknow what you want what exactly you want\nme to say\noh\nbecause it's i think we see that right\nso we we see that she\nyou know she's kind of behind the scenes\ni sort of have detected that\nin a lot of the different stories that\nyou've told\num and so i i just wanted to help us uh\nhelp everyone who's kind of thinking a\nlittle bit about your story like what\nrole she plays in it\nsounds like she's incredibly supportive\num 100\nand not just in an emotional sense but\nin uh\nyou know you know like very practical\nlike she sounds like she designed some\nof your art\num yeah she's she's my manager now so\nshe runs the actual business\nyeah there's same same with me too\nactually so\nthat's there are a lot of coincidences\nso i i have basically stories to match\neach and every one of yours\nand and my wife is now my boss yep\num so yeah it's interesting i i think\nyou know i've had a lot of interesting\nexperiences about working with your\nsignificant other um and\nit's been fun but it's i imagine much\nlike yourself so i think we were\nrelatively small channel until she took\nover\nand then she helped us become big\num and so\nyeah i mean i think just kind of getting\na quick perspective on on\nyou know so it sounds like she's pretty\ninvolved and also supports you in terms\nof like taking\nrisks in terms of figuring out you know\nif you have\nuh and now i may be projecting a little\nbit from my own relationship but\nyou know it sounds like if you have an\nidea she tries to help you make it work\ninstead of it just being a crazy idea\nshe would never shut me down\nshe would at least listen through the\nidea first\nand like sort of make it figure out how\nto make it feasible\nand ideally it can't be feasible i've\nnever said something and she's just gone\nno\nlike that that's something she would\nnever do because she knows that\ni might say something that's a little\nbit out there but i actually have\nalready thought of a bit of a process to\nget there\nso she'd want to actually hear it out\nfirst\num like like even the fact like we've\nbeen stuck in europe to try and get back\nto australia like i was like what if we\njust\nbought a yacht like i know it sounds\ncrazy but like\ni love fishing and sailing and all that\nkind of stuff like what if we bought a\nyacht\nand then we just hired a crew and we\njust like but\nlike we had to go down the path of we\ndon't know what to look at\nin a yacht like what kind of like it\ncould we could buy a lemon and we'd be\nhalfway across the pacific and sail to\nthe bottom of the ocean you know like we\nhave no idea what we're doing\nso like you listen to the idea but\nyou know obviously that one didn't go\nahead but it's she won't just go nowhere\nso past you know what's really fun is to\nwatch your face when you talk about her\nyeah do you know what you do when you\nstart talking small\nabsolutely right lights up your entire\nface\ndo you feel when you talk about her i'm\ni'm i'm happily married i think it's\nclear\ni'm gonna do that i'm gonna do the\npolitical response\ni think that's the beauty right is that\nit's like it's not it's clear to us\ni think or clear to me anyway that it's\nnot political i mean i\ni think in all seriousness to do a job\nparticularly like what i do\num there is a lot of hours to go into it\nand i have to make sure i allocate time\nto spend with my wife and she does\nshe kind of draws like says hey you know\nwe haven't had a time\nto ourselves for a while let's like next\nweek we're going to see a castle in the\nnetherlands because\ni've worked every day for the last like\ni don't know two weeks\nso it's like hey we need a she she keeps\nme leveled\nyeah so pes is there something in\nparticular\num first of all thank you so much for\nsharing everything is there anything\nelse\nanything in particular that you want to\ntalk about that we haven't discussed or\nanything you wanted to share\nnot really um\ni don't see myself as like better than\nanyone or anything like that i hope that\ni haven't come across like that at all i\ni just i definitely do feel like i\ni see things differently to a lot of\npeople a lot of people will see an idea\nand think oh that's really hard\nand i don't i i kind of like i just get\nexcited by the options of like what if\nthat was possible\nor something like that like i don't know\ni\na little bit of fear of like i might\ncome across as really arrogant in this\ntalk or something because\nyou know how my thought processes go\nacross but\num yeah pasta i'm gonna say something\ni think you are better than average well\nthank you\ni mean i i think you are better than\nmost people\nand i think part of and and i i know\nit's sort of like we\ni don't think that any human being is\nthat like has more inherent\nvalue than another human being and at\nthe same time\ni think when a lot of people look at you\ni know when i listen to you i think\nabout the ways in which you are better\nthan i am\nand this is the crazy thing is i don't\nthink that that's bad\ni think that you are different and you\nare exceptional\nyou've done a couple of things that are\ni think many people would be envious of\nand it doesn't mean that i think you\naccurately representing those things\ni can imagine people would perceive as\narrogance but i don't think so i think\nthe whole reason that you're here\nis so that we can learn how to be better\nright and and i'm not saying that like\nin a sense i think that's true of\neveryone that comes on the stream\nwe're here to learn from you and in your\ncase i think you have\nobjectively done things that are like\ndifficult to do\nyou objectively the way that your mind\nworks and the way that you live your\nlife\nseems to be like pretty enviable like\nlet's be honest\nand i think that's okay it doesn't make\nyou arrogant it just means\nyou suck less at life and so i think the\nimportant thing\nthe reason i'm really glad you came on\nand that you've been so open is because\ni think we can learn from you\nand the whole goal of this channel is\nthat like we can learn what everyone has\nto offer\nand we can become better at life by like\nlearning a little bit of your playbook\nwhat works what doesn't\ni think i mean some of the stuff that\nyou're talking about i can get behind\nsome of it i can try to\ndeconstruct and duplicate and some of it\ni'm just gonna have to figure out my own\nway\nbecause at the end of the day going to\nthe gym five days a week is just as you\nput it not enough of a priority for me\nyou know and so we we're gonna have\nsomething important awake anymore just\nto be clear\nlike but like i think there's definitely\num people\ndon't prioritize what's important to\nthem sometimes and and and i'm the same\nlike i go i really want to look after my\nhealth but then i don't go to the gym\nso like why yeah no go ahead i was\ni was going to say why don't people\nprioritize what's important to them\ni don't want to say the words lazy\nbecause i don't think people are always\nlazy it's just a matter of\nlike they get distracted easy like\nthere's\nlike like so many bright lights around\nus these days\nwhere and and things that just distract\nus so it's like oh another episode of\nyou know i was gonna say game of thrones\nbut no one wants to talk about game of\nthrones anymore but\nanother episode of a tv show comes out\noh i'll just watch that\nyou know like it's just it's they have\nfull intention to go to the gym they\nwere probably\nalready going to their gym clothes and\nthat but it's just you know\nsomething's shiny and it just distracts\nthem\nyeah so it's it's hard it's and there's\nso much we all want to do\nand we've only got so much time the most\nvaluable thing we all have is time and\ni don't like the idea of wasting it\nyeah i i don't think many people do\nwhich is why it can be so frustrating\nwhen they find themselves wasting it\nso pes let me ask you so i i think it's\ni really appreciated all the questions\nyou've\nanswered and your openness is there\nanything in particular that um\ni can help you with or anything that you\nwant to work on\num not really when you when you message\nasking for a talk\ni i i actually sat and\ni didn't reply straight away because i\nthought you know what could we talk\nabout\nand i like i go through the same like i\nhad like yesterday for example\ni woke up and i just did not want to\ntalk to people\ni had no one i did not want to talk to\npeople so instead i\ninstead of streaming i worked on youtube\ncontent you know i i just did something\nelse\nlike i i go through the same mentalities\nand issues i'm sure other streamers\nwould go through and other content\ncreators and\nand that way you just or people just in\ngeneral not wanting to go to work for\nthe day but i just try and make the most\nof the\nlike the day i can and then i think i\nwatched\nmaybe four episodes of carnival row on\nthe couch\nbut you know i got to rest as well\nthat's how i say it\nyeah that was the risk so let's just\ntalk about that for a second i think\nthat there's a really important\nshift that you make in your mind\nwhich is i think a lot of times people\nfocus on what they can't do\nand what they try to do is overcome the\ncan't\nlike how can you turn the cant into a\ncan\nright like i just can't talk to people\ntoday\nand they look at their lives and they\nsay like okay like what i need to do to\nmove forward is like you know how do i\ngo to the gym\nlike how do i just how do i just muscle\nthrough and do that\nhow can i grow and become disciplined\nand not be lazy\nwhereas i think you figured out a pretty\ninteresting solution which is you just\ndon't try to overcome it it's not about\nwhat you can't do and overcoming what\nyou can't do\nit's about what can you do\nand that's something that i found in my\nown life which is like i can't\ngo to the gym five days a week but like\nwhat can i do\nand i find that the less time that i\nspend trying to overcome my weaknesses\nand the more time that i spend sort of\nlike giving in to myself\nbut at least extracting a little bit of\nthe direction i want to go in\nthe better off i am can i at least do\nfive minutes of yoga\ncan i do 10 push-ups can i just can i\njust do something like what can i do\nokay fine you want to be lazy [ __ ]\ntoday\nno big deal we're going to be lazy today\nbut what can we do do we have to be lazy\nfor 14 hours of the day\ncan we just be lazy for 13 and a half\nand at least for 30 minutes like\nclean the kitchen and what i would\nencourage everyone to do is just pay\nattention to what pest said\nand sure so you're like you're like i\ncan't talk to people today i just can't\nstream okay but i can work on youtube\ncontent right\nand that too is sort of this idea that\nlike you have this central idea and like\nokay you can't stream but\nyou're willing to go over here to\nyoutube which is still like moving you\nit's still digging your well one foot\ndeeper it's just using a different tool\nfor the day\n100 and for the people\nlike really i encourage all of you guys\nto think about exercise or\nyou know finding a job it's like i can't\nfind a job and like\nthink about what pest has been telling\nus okay what's the process what can you\ndo\nmake a resume okay i don't even like\nknow how to make a resume can you\ndownload a template\ncan you download a template and just\nchange the name and the address at the\ntop\nbecause then you're one step closer to\nwhere you want to be\ncan you at least look at other people's\nresumes\nwith anything really yeah\nwhat can you do and i think too much of\nour or\ntoo much of myself and us we spend so\nmuch time and this is like the problem\nbecause i think a lot of like the\nself-help kind of stuff like david\ngoggins is a good example\nif he's all about overcoming can't\nright he's like and i'm not saying\nthat's bad i'm just saying that there's\nlike\nthere's a different way overcoming can't\nis half the battle\nand sometimes the other half is giving\nin to camp and focusing on what you can\ndo\na lot of david goggins stuff is also\nsaying stop giving a [ __ ] what other\npeople think though\num which i i kind of agree with that\nstuff stop caring about what other\npeople think\ndo what you want to do if you want to do\nthis be the best of that you can be\nyou know like it's not always overcoming\nissues but the negative forces of\npeople's\nideas and that coming towards you as\nwell like\nyeah i don't know like that that for me\nthat's more where i\ni just block out other people's you know\nnegativity with that as well\nbecause if i'm like i wanna i wanna do\nthis like\ni've wanted to walk 100 kilometers\nbefore and i've done it you know like\njust to see if i could do it but\nthere's so many people to be out there\nlike you couldn't do that don't do it\nlike that's stupid or you should go to\nbed because you've been up too long stop\nyou should stop you look tired well i'm\nnot tired i know that i can\nstay awake for three days straight i've\ndone it three times in the military\nlike you can say i can't do this but i'm\ndoing it so\nyou're wasting your time typing that\nthat's how i see it i don't\nlook at someone's message of me like\nyou're silly like i don't know\nyeah past i think you have a strong\nsense of who you are\nas a person and you come across as very\nconfident which makes it easy to\ndiscount what other people say i think\nthe challenge is that\nwhen someone says something about you\nyou have an intrinsic sense when they\nsay\nyou shouldn't do that that's dumb and\ninside you there's something that rises\nup and fights against that it's like you\ndon't know who i am i know who i am\nyou shouldn't stay up for well i've done\nit before so you should\nsit [ __ ] out i think the challenge is\na lot of people don't have that\nright and and so if it's okay with you\npast can i try to highlight a couple of\nthings that i've heard you say that i\nthink\nmaybe can get people moving sort of a\nlittle bit in the direction that you\nfound yourself in\nyeah official 100 okay so it starts with\ncuriosity\nright so if we really listen to you past\nwhat we hear is that like\nwhen you're curious about something you\nactually\ninvest the time and energy to try to\npursue it\nand i think this is huge because i think\na lot of people are very curious\nbut the curiosity ends with like a\nwikipedia search\nand there's something about you know the\nway that you cultivate ideas and like\ndevote yourself to like you know the\nsame thing over and over and over again\nbut\nyou're curious and you're bored easily\nwhich i think that's not something that\nis unique to you i think that's for most\npeople\ngamers in particular i think twitch this\nentire generation tends to be like\ncurious and bored easily and so i think\nthat's instrumental to getting you to\nwhere you've gone the only difference is\nthat i think you've actually\nfed your curiosity in a really healthy\nway\nand as far as the board easily like the\nway that you kind of still focus your\nthoughts in one general direction\nalthough you let yourself get bored\nbut when you get bored you're kind of\nlike okay what can i do with my boredom\nthat's almost in the direction that i\nwant to go\nthe second thing is that i i want you\nguys to really pay attention to this\nbecause i think pest didn't do it alone\nright and i think if we really listen to\nyour story we hear that\nit starts with like when you're on the\nbrink of quitting one person having\nfaith in you\nand one person looking at you and saying\ni don't think you\nare the person that you think you are\nyou've come so close to quitting and\nultimately they didn't like\nthey didn't give you a huge speech but\nthey saw within you\nsomething that has value and they saw\nwithin you that\nunderneath all of the layers of a\nquitter\nis someone who doesn't quit\nand that i think is is huge we also see\nthat even now\nit's not a single player game right like\nin when you kind of talk about your wife\nwe see the way the way your face lights\nup\nwe see like how she's been helpful and\nsupportive and stuff like that how she\nkind of keeps you in check\nbut also gives you wings\num\nso one time i was working with someone\nso\nin some of these hospitals that i work\nin there are these like older people who\nare just super wise\nusually not doctors but they're like\nnurses and just like people who just\nhave really\nand and you know when i had kids i went\nto this one person who i respected a lot\nand they've got a couple of kids and i\nassumed their kids are\nhealthy and happy so i asked him like\nhey do you have any like advice for like\nraising children\nand he said yeah give him wings and give\nhim a place to fly back to\nand it was like one of those just\namazingly\nsuccinct like give him wings\nand let him fly and then have a place to\ncome back to and when i hear about your\nrelationship with\nyour wife that's kind of what i get is\nthat she does\nyou know support you she always listens\nand then every now and then she's like\nhey you've been working for two weeks\nlet's be normal human beings and take a\nlittle bit of a break\nright so she gives you those wings and\nthen she gives you a place to come back\nto\nso the second thing is that you know\nit's important to have people in your\nlife and then if you don't then how do\nyou get those as a whole other question\num so i think that faith\nhas been transformative for you and\nsupport has been transformative for you\nthat ultimately i think a lot of your\ngrowth has come from\nyou exercising control and taking\ncontrol of your life\nwhich i know is hard to duplicate but\nyou know you sort of tried it for a\nwhile and you kind of played this game\nand then people were like\nthey weren't willing so at some point\nyou developed that faith and confidence\nin yourself\nand your ceo refused to see it\nand so there was one time in your life\nwhere all you saw within yourself was a\nquitter\nand someone refused to see it there's\nanother time in your life where\nwhat they saw was a quitter and you\nrefused to see that\nyou're like you know what [ __ ] you guys\ni'm done\num and so i think it's really amazing\nhow you've\nyou know taken risks and you don't know\nhow things are going to go\nand another thing that i would say is\nthat like this kind of comes back to\nwhat you were saying about you don't\nfear\nfailure i think that's one of the\nbiggest problems is because the fear of\nfailure\ntends to paralyze a lot of people\nthe other subtle thing that we can hear\nfrom your words is that when you\nfail i don't hear it say anything about\nyou as a person like a lot of people\nfeel like when they\nfail they are a failure like the person\nand the failure are the same thing does\nthat make sense\nyeah yeah so i don't see the failure\nas being something that is the\nit's i see as a lesson learned that more\nthan just being like\nunable to do something yeah so i want\nyou like so that's really interesting\nright because for one person\na failure means i'm a bad person\nbut when you feel fail when you say it's\na lesson learned that actually makes you\na better person\nand so if you want to talk about what's\nop it's when failure pushes one person\ndown\nand failure pumps you up like why the\nlike no that's\nthat's op every failure you have\nactually makes you\nstronger and better and gives you a\nsense of like confidence that you're\nyou're better than the person you used\nto be before\nand then there's like a whole crowd of\npeople out there who are like when they\nfail they feel like less of a human\nbeing\nand it's like you know i wanna i wanna i\nwant your strategy\nand that's what i've seen a lot in\nclinical medicine too\nis that like sometimes when you have a\nbad outcome with a patient you can feel\nlike a bad doctor\nand then like the other way to think\nabout it is like\nnow that you've had that bad outcome\ni'll be damned if i ever let that happen\nagain\nand what you've actually done in that\nmoment is improved the lives of\nevery patient that you're gonna see\nafterward if you learn from it\nif you throw yourself a pity party and\nyou feel like a bad person\nyou're actually doing a disservice to\nall the patients that come next so i\nthink that's really fascinating which i\nhear you kind of talk about like you\nknow failure isn't about your value as a\nperson it's about\nlearning and then the last thing that i\nwant to highlight is that\nyou know a lot of people think that you\nneed like discipline and stuff and when\nwe look at past and we think like oh my\ngod this guy's so disciplined\nbut i think it's really cool that you\nlearned adobe in three days\nand i think that there's absolutely a\nroad of six towards success where you\ndive really deep into something for a\nfew days\nand then you don't have to devote your\nentire life to like making youtube\nvideos\nthat you can actually have your mind\nwander between different things\nget super excited about something learn\nit really well but as long as it's in\nthe same\ngeneral direction i think you're going\nto end up kind of like where you did\nwhat do you think yeah\ni think you don't need to be the master\nof everything there's no way you need to\ndevote all your time and effort into\nmastering one trade\num like yeah the adobe is a good example\nwhere i just i learned enough to make\nyoutube videos and then i started making\nyoutube videos\ni i thought it'd be really cool to be\nable to make really cool\ntransitions and everything but i soon\nrealized like that would be so time\nconsuming\nin hindsight i would actually hire an\neditor like early on in my career\ni made my first 500 youtube videos in\nthe first two years and that was a lot\nof life that it took\nfrom me but um the\ni do that with a lot of things though\ni'll try try something out for a little\nbit see if i like it\nput some time into learning it and then\nbut just enough to get the understanding\nof it not to\nto master it i think i think there's a\nlot people can do with that where you\ndon't have to feel like you have to\nmaster\nthe craft of something to be\nit's like there's a guy that said in 10\nhours you can learn something i was like\nted talk or something\nand he played the guitar after 10 hours\nand he learned a song or something or\nukulele actually it was\nit was a really cool ted talk in 10\nhours you can actually learn a language\nfor example you can\nlearn the basic rapport building of a\nlanguage or something\num so yeah i think there's some\ndefinite premise behind that piece\nanything that you think i kind of left\nout\nthose are i think the key things like\nsort of curiosity\nit's okay to get bored easily having\npeople have faith in you\nbeing able to quit walking away from\ngood things\num acknowledging that failure is not\nabout\nyou it's a failure actually makes you\nstronger not weaker\num and kind of diving in this kind of\ngoes to the board easily thing but sort\nof diving into one thing for like a few\ndays at a time and then\nthat's good enough i think um\na lot of a lot of that can be summarized\nup in just always trying to improve\nmyself as a person\nreally um i always\ntry and be the best person i can be and\nnot just in like\na what do you call it like a a practical\nsense like being able to have these\nskills to make a video but\nalso like i try to reply to every single\ndiscord dm there is i get a lot these\ndays but like i still try to reply to\nthem all like\njust try and be the best person you can\nbe and one of the things i'm big with my\ncommunity is paying it forward\nlike i'll do something for you and then\nyou do it for someone something for\nsomeone else it doesn't have to be\ndirectly back to me\num and with that premise we can just\nmake a better society and a better\ncommunity\num i'm i'm guessing you're trying to\nstart to head towards wrapping it up but\ni actually really just uh um i just like\nthe fact that people\naren't so community focused these days\nlike when i was a child i everyone knew\ntheir neighbors\nso when i bought a house the first thing\ni did well not literally the first but\nlike\nwithin the 24 hours of moving into my\nhouse i went and said hello to all my\nneighbours i've knocked on every single\none of their doors and said hello hi\nmy name's paul um you know i live next\ndoor i'm in the army if you ever need\nanything just\nyou know knock on the door i'm i don't\ncare how big or small\nand and from that point onwards they\nwere the best neighbors ever because\nlike someone parked in my driveway once\nand they gave me a call and said hey\nthere's some random car in your driveway\nlike they didn't have to do that but if\ni'd never introduced myself\nthey never would have done that you know\nand that community aspect\nisn't just like a twitch thing for me\nit's it's a life thing\nyou know just be good to everyone and\nhopefully it all\nmakes the world a better place yeah man\ni am i'm sort of leaning towards\nwrapping up is there something that you\nwant to\ndiscuss otherwise or anything else you i\nthink it's a great great sentiment about\ncommunity i think that's actually one of\nthe really interesting things is\ntwitch is a place where or just the\ninternet is a place that in a lot of\nways fractures and isolates us\nbut i think conversely is the very\nantidote\nto the poison that it kind of creates\nand we sort of\nsort of get the sense of fomo and like\nyou know\nthinking less about the ourselves and\nseeing what other people are doing in it\nat the same time it's the very tool that\nwe can use to bring ourselves together\nyeah and i think twitch is a really\ngreat platform for community\ni really i as a marketing side i really\nwish they pushed it more\nis it marketing what side like the\ntwitch twitch management should be\nactually focusing more on the community\naspect than anything\non the platform yeah and how they can\nenhance the community because i think\nit's just i think it's great i think\nthere's so much they could do so much\nmore they could do\nwhat would you like to see even like\nlike among us is a perfect example of\nhow anyone playing any game can play the\none game and enjoy it\nme bringing musicians across to play on\nmy stream\nlike all those kind of things where we\ncould\nbring communities like from different\nstreams across together to\nto cross-pollinate i guess would be the\nword but also\num\nlike i i before kobe kicked in i did\nmeet ups in\nin france portugal and the netherlands\nand i went to pax east um but like\nyou know conventions are great like all\nthat kind of stuff\nwhere people can go and hang out and\ntalk\nmeet each other and have fun or if they\ndon't want to go to those conventions\nthey can still play games together and\njust anything that enhances the\ncommunity aspect of twitter i'm\nall for and stuff like this this is\nactually like\nbringing people together to talk about\nstuff so thank you so much for what you\ndo\nas well yeah likewise man i think it's\nthank you so much for coming i think\ntoo often i do we focus on sort of the\ndownsides of life like we focus a lot on\nhow people mess up and what i really\nappreciated about you pest is that\ni think you gave us an opportunity for\nlike\nyou know what is what does success look\nlike\nand i don't mean to make you know i'm\nnot trying to kiss your ass or anything\nor flatter you but i think that\nyou know when you look at it you play a\ngame and some games you win in some\ngames you lose\nit's just as important to look at the\nreplays that you win so that you can\nfigure out what did you do right\nand equally important to look at the\nreplays that you lost to figure out what\nyou did wrong\nand living life is about like\nunderstanding both of those sides it's\nnot just about all your mistakes in fact\ni'd argue that\na lot of what holds people back is that\nthey focus too much on their mistakes\ngoing back to this idea of like how do i\novercome what i can't do well like\njust set that aside for a second man\nlet's look at you what you can do let's\nlook at what you are good at\nlet's look at like how do people\ntransition\nfrom a place of being lonely and not\nhaving friends to like starting a twitch\nstream and things like that i think\nsuccess stories are just as important\nnot just because it's like\nsuccess men but very practically like\nyou know what are the things that you\ncan do\num so i really appreciate that so thank\nyou very much\num do you want do you do you are you\ninterested in learning how to meditate\ndo you meditate\num i used to have an app called\nheadspace and\nit used to like the issue i used to\nalways have with it was\num once as soon as my brain starts to\nstop thinking i fall asleep because i\ndon't sleep a lot\ni get like seven hours at the moment in\nthe past it used to be five hours\num i guess seven hours sleep at night\nand now i'm not i'm really happy i get\nthat much now\nbut anytime i meditate i usually just\nfall asleep\nso um i know you're pretty big on it and\nand i've definitely tried it in the past\nbut generally for me a lot of the time\ni just fall asleep okay it's okay\nokay i'll ask you this question then is\nthere a way to instead of meditating to\ncalm the mind is there a way to like\nkeep the mind active but still\nstop me from sleeping then sure i've got\na meditation for you\nokay you ready for it yep so if i asked\nyou to close your eyes and meditate now\ndo you think you'd fall asleep here on\nstream\nno why not\num it depends on how long it went for\nokay so so i've got a great meditation\nfor you it's perfect you're suited for\nit\nit's gonna be so easy for you it's gonna\nbe hard for other people but i think\nit'll be easy for you so i don't know\nhow much it'll help other people to\nlearn\nmeditation okay you ready for it\ni want you to catch the moment of sleep\nand what i mean by that is that\nclose your eyes paul so you're awake\nright\nand so like being awake has a certain\nconsciousness\nyou can notice your thoughts you may be\naware of sensations you can hear my\nwords\nand sleep is different right\nso what i want you to do\nthis is going to sound silly because i\nknow you said you\nyou were not gonna fall asleep but i\nwant you to\ntry to fall asleep and as\nbecause don't remember it's not about\ngoing back to what we just said like\ndon't focus on what you can't do like if\nyou always fall asleep during meditation\nfine\nthat's not a problem that's our solution\nlet's run with it\nso what i want you to do is catch the\nmoment of sleep\nso there's going to be a transition\nwhere on one side of the transition\nyou're awake and on the other side of\nthis transition you're asleep\nand just catch that moment of sleep\nit's like you're fishing there's nothing\non the\nline and now there's a fish on the line\ncatch that moment\nbetween empty hook and fish on the hook\nlet yourself fall asleep\nwe'll try for about five minutes\ncan i be silent or do you want me to\ncoach you through the process\num it's up to you i'm i'm\ni don't know what are you doing right\nnow tell me\ni'm just focusing on my breathing\nokay and waiting for yourself to fall\nasleep\npretty much good\nso i want you to be like a tiger\ncrouching\nready to catch that sleep\nwait for it wait for it\nnotice what your mind is doing\nand now i'll be silent for about three\nminutes\nare you asleep yet not yet\nwhat are you doing just focusing on\nbreathing\nokay so i'm going to ask you a couple of\nquestions is that okay\nyep so like focusing on your breathing\nis meditating right\nwhat happens when you meditate\num you relax no no what happens when you\nmeditate\noh um\ni know my body just feels more heavy\nyep and then you fall asleep yeah\nwhat have you been doing for the last\nfive minutes meditating\nwhy haven't you fallen asleep\ni think probably anxiousness if anything\nthat would have sleep in front of uh\nin you like this are you thinking lots\nof thoughts\nyeah too many okay\nso here's the crazy thing so i think\nyou're doing a good job\nand maybe it's because you're on stream\nalthough i'm going to assume for a\nmoment that it's not\nso maybe the reason you didn't fall\nasleep is because you're on stream fair\nenough\nbut i want you to try to do is to catch\nthe moment of sleep\noffstring and see what happens\nand i suspect that something silly may\nhappen\nwhich is that if you try to meditate\nyou'll fall asleep\nand if you try to catch sleep you'll\nmeditate\ndoes that make sense yeah it is\nyou can come back to us\nhow do you feel relaxed\nso catch it if it wants to come let it\ncome catch it\nand maybe you won't fall asleep maybe\nyou will win\nwin either way if you do fall asleep\nnext time\nyou felt you know you fell asleep you\nmissed it you missed your prey\nso next time you can practice and do a\nlittle bit better\nquestions does that make sense\nyeah it does cool man\nwell thank you very much oh my pleasure\nthat was really good it was really good\nyeah thank you could you want to just\ntell us a little bit i i know you've\ntalked to them about stream but you want\nto tell us kind of more formally like\nyou know who you are where we can find\nyou what kind of streams you do\nso twitch.tv forward slash pastely i'm\nmostly focused on first-person shooters\nbut i'm branching out into pretty much\nanything but i feel like at the moment\num it's mostly just a community people\nthat just enjoy computer games and we\njust have fun and\na lot of banter um it's we don't take\ngaming serious it's i'm not trying to be\nthe best out there i'm just trying to\nhave fun try and teach people and\nsometimes they teach me games when i\nplay different games as well and\nyeah it's a bunch of cool people\nawesome pastel and thank you very much\nand everything\nyeah that's awesome thank you so much\nfor coming and best of luck with\nstreaming and\nand all that and thank you for what you\ndo it's like\nit's really cool i've um i've i've\ndefinitely listened to a few\num different youtube videos in and out\nover time so\nreally thank you so much for what you do\nyeah you're very welcome man\nand and you know as someone\nwho has a wife who supports me\nand i don't know how to say this but\nplease express my gratitude to your wife\nfor people like her existing in the\nworld because i'm one of
