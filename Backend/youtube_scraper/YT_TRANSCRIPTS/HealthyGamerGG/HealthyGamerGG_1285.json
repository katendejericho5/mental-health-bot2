    "transcript": "hey lou sorry sorry for being late\nthat's all right sorry are we ready um\nokay okay\nso thank you for coming on and and you\nprefer\nlou is that right um yeah you could call\nme lou\nor poo or pooper noodle\nyes so what's up what's up with that by\nthe way\nwhy is your why is your pooper noodle\nokay i didn't think we'd do this already\noh no i mean we don't have to i was\nsorry is that something i'm not supposed\nto ask you about\nno no no i can i can i can say um no\nit's just kind of like it's an\nodd name no yes\nsorry it's a bit weird um basically\nuh the second time i went\nto university i was\nas the title suggests very socially\nanxious\num i i used to\ni had a sink in my room\nand i used to i used to pee in the in\nthe sink because\ni i was avoiding my flatmates\num well i mean it started off okay like\nfreshers week was okay but then i didn't\ni ended up staying in my room\non my computer for like a week and then\nlike i hadn't seen them in a week and i\nwas like\nokay it's been a week like if i see them\nnow that\nit's gonna be really weird so then it\nlike the weeks tend into months\nanyway um so i didn't\ni didn't go into the kitchen ever\nand i didn't use the bathroom i used to\npee in my sink in my room\nand i used to make food in my room as\nwell\noccasionally i would make noodles in the\nsink\nand in the uk there's this brand called\nsuper noodles\num anyway uh\nbut um i didn't yeah i\none time i one time i i\ni defecated in the sink by accident um\nyeah i didn't it wasn't on purpose\nnormally i would\num normally i would [ __ ] in like\num wait can i swear oh it's too late now\num\nnormally i'd [ __ ] in like plastic bags\nokay um yeah\naccident yeah\nyeah um but anyway that's what happened\nand then the guy i was that who's my\nboyfriend at the time\nhe made a joke called me poop noodle\ncause it was the same thing that i made\nnoodles in and rhyme with superman\nyeah so i mean that's i think that's\nfunny i i also think it's interesting\nthat you\nyou know this is not the kind of thing\nthat people would normally advertise\nno no not really\nso help me understand that\ni i don't\ni don't know um i i very\nopenly i used to talk about this a lot\nand like make like sort of\nraunchy gaudy sort of jokes and stuff\nand talk about that sort of\nthing um i i think i felt like\nsort of wearing it on my sleeve\nhelps is that does that make sense\ninteresting\nright so let's let's just put a pin in\nthat concept\nright because i can imagine that if\nwe're dealing with social anxiety\nyou know telling the story that you just\ndid i would i would imagine\nmakes your social anxiety worse\num yes\nyeah yeah does it\ni don't know i don't think so are they\ninteresting\nactually no because i'm saying it to you\nand i can see your face\nyeah that's hard that's really hard but\nsaying it to like my stream when it's\njust a bunch of text\ncompletely different what makes it hard\nwhen you can see my face\num\ni didn't i don't know just like your\nface\noh no that's my face\nno i don't like it\num i just i feel like i\ni pay a lot of attention to yeah\nexpressions\nyes and do i\ni know that i misinterpret expressions a\nlot\nas negative and i i don't like looking\nat people's faces\nwell i don't like looking at your face\neither\nokay so we'll talk about that so paying\nattention to people's expressions\nright yeah and misinterpreting people's\nexpressions\ni don't think that you're\nmisinterpreting them by the way\ntechnically\nokay i think what you're able to do is\ndetect\ndissatisfaction in a face that primarily\nis satisfied if that makes sense so\nthere's actually research on this\nso let me let me explain it from the top\nit's a really interesting study\nso i'm smiling at you right\nand then i get okay i'm mad at you\nlike there's a transition so smiling\nmatt\nand there's like a transition right you\ndoes that make sense like\nthis and then this is kind of halfway\nand then like this\nyeah yeah yeah so there's there's a\ntransition so if you think about it\nhalfway between smiling and being mad at\nyou my face is displaying 50\nhappiness 50 anger does that make sense\nyes i think so so a normal person and i\ndon't mean to say you're abnormal i mean\nsomeone who's not as sensitive as you\nare like literally your brain has a\nhigher processing power\nhere okay so okay so most people they're\nprocessing power when they when they see\nlike the half angry half happy face\nthey they're just confused they think i\ndon't know what this person is feeling\ndoes that make sense because it's like\nhalf smiling half angry it's like what\nis that person feeling i don't know\nand even if you think about it when i'm\n80 smiling and 20\nangry most people will think that i'm\nhappy\ndoes that make sense yes but people who\nhave\nsocial anxiety or some other\nit's not even a psychiatric thing but\nlike there's some other diagnoses that\nare associated\nwith the ability to detect negative\naffect or negative emotion in someone's\nface\neven though it's hidden so you'll be\nable to detect the 20\nanger with the 80 smile\nand your brain will tell you oh that\nperson is still 20 angry\ndoes that make sense so it's not that\nyou that you're like\nyou're detecting false things you're\njust detecting a small amount of\ndissatisfaction\nin spite of the large amount of approval\nand your brain is clueing you in to that\nsignal but it's not like it's in your\nhead it's literally that your brain\nis more sophisticated and can detect\nlow negative emotion at very low amounts\nokay does that make sense\nyes absolutely the other interesting\nthing is that people who've experienced\ntrauma especially in childhood develop\nthis skill\nso if you look at people who like have\nabusive parents\nyou know if your parents are abusive and\nthey seem like they're in a good mood\nit becomes a survival mechanism to be\nable to detect\nstorm clouds oh is my dad really in a\ngood mood\nor is he like uh happy on the surface\nand like a volcano underneath and so\nlike their brains literally adapt\nto detecting like negative emotion\nunderneath positive emotion okay\nit's almost like they have x-ray vision\nwhich is kind of what you want\nso the thing that you have to be careful\nabout is that your\nmind will detect 20 dissatisfaction\nand that's what your mind will zoom in\non and it'll ignore the 80\nso that's something you have to retrain\nbut your capacity to detect you're\nliterally more sensitive like you can\ndetect things\nthat normal human beings can't people\nwith anxiety and people with histories\nof trauma\nare like able to detect things because\ntheir brain has like told them hey like\nthis\nstimulus is actually important so let's\npay attention to that\nwhat do you think about that it made it\nsound\nmuch much cooler than i thought it\nwhat did you think about it i don't\num i don't know my\ni mean my my parents were lovely yeah so\ni i mean obviously there were some\nthings that happened in my childhood\num but i i couldn't pinpoint\nlike a single thing that sort of\nyou know i like i i remember i have\nmemories of like my mum wearing\nsunglasses a lot and whenever she was\nwearing these sunglasses i always\nthought she was angry at me because i\ncouldn't see her face\nso i always found it quite scary um\nand so when she wore them i'd always ask\nher to take them off because i couldn't\ni couldn't see her face\nbut like i i have fond memories of of my\nparents i don't\nyeah i i didn't mean to imply that you\nknow your parents were abused i'm just\nsaying that's\nwhat we see yes sometimes\nthere's two camps there's people with\nsocial anxiety there's also people who\nhave a history of\nabuse growing up they both their their\nbrain wires to be\nsensitive to facial expressions what are\nyou getting from my face\num\nyou look a bit bored okay now\noh now you look like you're cringing no\ni'm smiling i'm having a blast\nokay\nthis is my board face i guess does this\nlook like a board face t\nwait no it's because i'm i was looking\nat\nthe other because there's a little bit\nof a delay wait\ndo the face again wait are you you can't\nsee me on discord\num because you're like really really\npixelated so i'm looking at your stream\nbecause you're not\nyou're not pixley here i'm pixelated\nthat's gotta be tough um\noh i can see you now okay fantastic\ngreat\nso just look at me don't watch stream\nand certainly ignore twitch chat i do my\nbest too\nokay yeah sorry for the random ass\ntangent\nokay\nno i was i was just gonna say um yeah\nsorry sorry about that\nand then so i think there were a couple\nthings that i really\nthought were really important about your\nstory uh which highlight\nso like social anxiety so one is like\nthis idea that\nthey haven't seen you in a week so you\ncan't see them\nyeah right and then two weeks go by and\nthen it's like no\nnow i can't show my face and every week\nthat goes by\nyou ca they can't see you and then every\nweek it gets worse and worse\nand then you have to become a hermit you\nhave to just like move out of the\napartment\nat three in the morning that's exactly\nwhat i did i used to i had this little\npile of cushions that i would put\nlike right next to the door so i could\nsit and listen\nfor long periods of time to work out\nwhen\nthey weren't in the corridor and i that\nsounds\nabsolutely crazy doesn't it yeah um\nyeah yeah that's that's what happens\ni mean like what you said about the it's\nbeen the weeks and then it's been months\nthing like i remember one time\num oh isn't it quite a long uh\nuber journey and as i got in the car my\nseat belt um got stuck in the door so it\nwas like poking out the door\nso i sit in the car but i didn't want to\nmove over so i was i couldn't\ni couldn't actually use the seat belt um\nbut it had been about 20 seconds by that\npoint and i felt like oh no if i if i\nsay something about it now to him and\ni'm just a window\nyeah like so so i ended up just sat\nthere for the next like 20 minutes\nthinking that i was gonna\ndie because i wasn't wearing a seatbelt\nbecause i felt too nervous to actually\nsay hey\ncan i yeah yeah and then it's like how\ndo you tell them oh like\nfive minutes into the journey like oh by\nthe way i don't have a seatbelt\nten minutes into the journey by the way\ni don't have a seat belt on\nand then they're like why would why\nwould you wait 10 minutes and then tell\nme you know\nit's crazy yeah\ni remember one time i had been out of\nschool for a little while\nand then like since i was out of school\nlike i couldn't go back like what would\npeople think\nyes and then like i had missed classes\nand then like how can you show up like\ni've i've just been skipping\nclass because playing video games all\nday and then it was like halfway through\nthe semester if i start going to class\nnow i can still pass\nbut can you just like i didn't know like\nwhat to think like there are 30 people\nin the class and then halfway through\nthe semester someone just walks in that\nyou've never seen before\nyes yes and then they're like what are\nyou doing here and you're like i'm in\nthe class and they're like no you're not\nwhere you've been this whole time i\ncouldn't do it\nso yeah i mean yeah i dropped out of\nuniversity\na few years ago because of i just felt\nlargely because of that\nyeah oh right so i showed up on the day\nof my final\nand then i i put my head down and i\ni thought i was banking on people not\nnoticing because they would be taking\ntheir final\nyes and then took my final and then\nwalked out\ndo you know what grade i got in the\nclass can you guess\ni don't how do you grade things\noh yes so a b c d\nand f okay how do you grade things where\nyou are\nthat way but i don't know i just thought\nit might be different\nuh a c f wait no did you\noh okay\nthat's how you fail at class boys and\npulse\nso you never go and then you show up on\nthe final and then you do your best\nwhich is pretty awful\nand then i went home and i played a lot\nof diablo too to make my feelings go\naway\nthat sounds fun thing it was actually a\nlot of fun\nit was a blast of semester i really\nenjoyed it\nalas okay i did actually\nhave a class that i failed as well\nbecause of that but that was at\nthis university uh it was it was um\ni was studying chinese and i\ni went i went for like the first couple\nmonths\nand then it dropped off i have this\npattern with everything that i do it\njust it slowly drops off\nbecause i miss one thing and then i'm\nlike well i can't go to the next one\nbecause yeah i wasn't at the last one\nand what if they asked me\nwhat happened at the last one i wasn't\nthere um so anyway yeah\nthe days turn into a week 10 months i go\nto the final exam\num and i throw up\nin the room and i get sent home\nand i failed the exam yeah\nwow yeah it's hard right like when when\nthe only\nway that you can show up the next day is\nto have been perfect the day the day\nbefore\nyes i hadn't thought of it like that\nyeah that's what do you think about that\ni don't know i like to be very like\nprepared\nbecause things have to go perfect yeah\nyeah otherwise i don't go back\nyep right so so like\nlike lou i think you're living life like\nthese speed runners\nor like a single mistake and you have to\nstart over\nyeah so you never make and like that's\ngreat\nwhen you're playing the same game with\nthe same levels\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain\nbut it's hard in life where like every\nday is a little bit different\nit's like you're trying to speed run a\ngame but you only get to play it once\nand tomorrow there's a new game\nyeah it's weird i think i understand\nthat\nyeah so chase and perfection\nwhy do you have to be prepared\num should prepare you know\nfor the worst i i've been told i uh\ncatastrophize a lot what is that so like\nlike i don't know how to describe like\nfor example i used to go to these like\nspin classes with my dad um\nand suddenly out of nowhere\num i would this thought would pop into\nmy head that like i'm gonna\nspin off the front of the bike and like\ndie\nand like the bike will like explode or\nsomething or something will explode in\nthe room above me\num and it happens like every time i go\noutside\nlike i'm trying to cross the road this\ncar is going to run me over\ni'm like i'm going to die yeah\nit's it's weird to have a mind that\ntells you that kind of stuff right\ndoes that make sense i don't i don't\ni don't know because it's because it is\nmy\nmind does everyone not have these\nthoughts sometimes or do you have those\nthoughts\ndo you not have those thoughts sometimes\num i suppose when i'm drunk\nah i don't catastrophize okay\nno okay interesting\num and how long have you been\ncatastrophizing\nlike forever okay so you've been doing\nit your entire life\noh it feels that way but\nmaybe not i think so yeah important\nrevelation right\nlet's just think about that so so you\njust said\nyeah i have been doing it and then you\npaused\nand then you said it feels like it's\nbeen my entire life\nyeah so has it been your entire life\nno so in the past few years\nso let's think about that right so\nsomething when i asked you the question\nthere's some kind of internal\ncalculation that says\nyes this has been going on forever like\nit gave you that answer\nyeah like but\nit turns out that that's not actually\nthe case\nso then if we're being very careful what\nwe have to recognize is that sometimes\nour mind\nproduces answers for us that are wrong\nyeah that's yeah all the time\ncan you tell us about that oh oh\nuh yeah\nlike uh oh like this this like just\nlike last week okay um last year there\nwas a\nstream i was quite uh like\na big fan of had been subbed to him for\na few months okay\nlike maybe six months i resubscribe and\nhe's like um\npooper noodle yikes and\nhe's just like a bit of a joker like\nthat's just saying whatever he farms\nthey'll w's\nbut um instantly i was like oh\nmy god he hates me i unsubscribed\ninstantly i unfollowed him everywhere\ni just i was mortified\num i avoided watching any videos about\nthis streamer because i couldn't stop\nthinking about this time that he was\nlike\npooper and it all yikes um and\nlike a month ago he said something\nreally nice about me\nand i realized that it was\njust all in my head yeah looked\ncompletely made up\nyeah how do you understand that what's\nup with that\ni i don't know it made me think of\nlike lots of other incidents where i've\njust in like instantly i'm like okay\nthis person wants nothing to do with me\ni'm just gonna remove myself completely\nokay from all of that so let's talk\nabout that for a second\nis that cool yeah yeah\nso this person wants\nnothing to do with me\nhold on can i think for a second yes\nhow much of your social anxiety can be\ncaptured by that phrase\nwhat phrase this person wants nothing to\ndo with me\num probably quite a lot of it\nokay how long have you felt\nhow long has your mind been sometimes\nrandomly telling you that this person\nwants nothing to do with me\num i i mean i've always been\nlike i've always been quite quiet like a\nchild growing up i my brother was very\nsocial media outgoing um and he would\nalways\nmake the friends and then i would like\nplay with like little toy cars or\nsomething um\none of us\noh yeah so that was that was\nthat was quite difficult as well because\nsometimes we would do things\nlike as a family and there would be\nlike maybe another family with like kids\nthere\nand then he would make their friends\nfirst and then\nhe'd be like you know you know don't\ntalk to her she's just quiet and weird\nand then they would like all go have fun\nthe night but like i\ni did i liked my own company so it\nwasn't it wasn't awful\num i just wasn't very outgoing and i\nhadn't been difficult to\nyou know just talk to to kids and stuff\num and then i had some pretty bad\nexperiences in in high school with like\nother girls so then\ni didn't know how to talk to girls\nanymore for i still don't i don't really\nhave any friends now that are girls many\nat all\num yeah\nokay so i asked you about\nyou know sort of like whether this\nperson wants nothing to do with me\nhas oh no oh you asked me something and\ni went on complete tangent oh i'm so\nsorry\nno no don't be sorry i think that's\nwhere we learn\nthat's wonderful okay i'm glad you went\non a tangent right because you gave us a\ncouple of really important pieces of\ninformation\none is that while you may have been\nsocially isolated\nthe reasons for your social isolation\nback then\nwere fundamentally different because i\ndidn't hear this person doesn't want to\nhang out with me i heard\ni was just kind of a quiet shy kid and i\nwas okay with my own company\nso if anything that tells us that like\nsomething happened that changed the way\nthat you\nperceived your interpersonal\ninteractions which is great\nlike it's great that you gave me that\npiece of information because then we\nactually know that you haven't always\nbeen like this\nokay does that make sense\nyes yes\nokay yeah so so yeah okay\nyeah go ahead i don't know i just\nthought that like\nsince i'd been quiet my you know whole\nlife that i'd\nalways had social anxiety but are you\ntelling me that that's not quite the\ncase i could just been quiet and then\nsomething happened along the way that\nmade me anxious\nabout social things\nthat's what i would hypothesize okay\nright because what what i'm hearing this\nperson wants nothing to do with me\nsays nothing about the person\nit says something about you\nright yeah it has to do with the way\nthat you perceive\nyour value whereas\nthe girl who's content to play with toy\ncars\nhas no problem with her value in fact as\nyou put it you used to think the\nopposite\ni'm a cool person to hang out with all\nby myself\ni'm very good company right if you think\nabout it that's actually the exact\nopposite you're like hey this person's\nawesome\ni don't need any of those [ __ ]\ni'm gonna hang out with me myself and\nlou\nwe're gonna play with our toy cars and\nit's gonna be great\nyeah and then somewhere somewhere along\nthe way you were like oh like\nlou's not worth hanging out with that's\ndifferent\nsomething's changed does that make sense\nthat those are\nthose feel very different to me yes\ni um like i had why i had this amazing\nfamily\nmy childhood was a bit difficult because\nwe were moving\na lot so i was i was born in thailand\nin phuket and we lived there for six\nseven years and then\nmy dad was a teacher and he got a job\nthen as a headmaster in chile in south\namerica\nso then we lived there for four years so\ni was learning different languages\nand then after that we we moved to to\nengland\nand while i did make friends i was\nalways\nvery different from them and there were\nthere were\ntimes where like if my friends wanted to\nexclude me\nthey would they would talk in their own\nlanguage\nso that i couldn't join in\num and i mean that happened in all the\ncountries apart from england because i\nspeak english then yeah\nwhat was it like to be excluded\nit wasn't fun um\nno that there was\nquite a um\npoignant moment in high school\nactually in england where i felt very\nexcluded\nthat i think i don't know how to\ndescribe it really shaped the way i\nfelt about myself i think um\nit's it sounds really materialistic\nbut i was in this group of like maybe\nseven girls seven or eight girls and we\nwere all like best friends\nuh but there was a pecking order and i\nwas\nthe bottom of the pecking order but it\nwas fine because like\ni it meant i didn't have to sit in the\ntoilet at lunchtime if i hung out with\nthem\num and basically\nevery every birthday because for our\n18th it was his 18th birthday so\nevery birthday everyone would pitch in\n20 pounds\nand then like the week before everyone\nwould would go\nout and choose a like a special charm\nbracelet with a charm for them and then\nlike a cake and then a little surprise\nparty and that sort of thing\nanyway uh you can probably tell where\nthis story is going but like\nfour birthdays happen everyone pitches\nin i pitch in\nit gets to my birthday uh nothing really\nhappens\non the day that's fine i'm people busy i\nwait a couple of weeks\num one of the girls invites me around to\nhers\n[Laughter]\nsorry um when i walked in\nthere was like half a box of donuts\nand some deodorant that they were like\nspraying around i don't know if that was\nlike a joke\nlike i smell bad or something that's\nprobably in my head as well um\nbut uh these yeah these don't episode\nalready started eating\num they sang happy birthday i was\nwaiting for this bracelet\num which yeah that makes me sound really\nspoiled but\nuh it didn't happen uh i found out\nafterwards\nthat between the sort of seven of them\nthey only managed to get together about\nfive ten pounds\num so\nwell that made me feel pretty [ __ ] um\nyeah what does that mean feel pretty\n[ __ ] what are you feeling\num i felt\nlike like these\nthese people were my friends and they\nlike even though i'd joined in all the\nother i joined in all the birthdays\nafterwards\nas well um even though i joined in all\nthis stuff they didn't\nthey didn't want to do the same for me\nand it i just made me feel quite uh\nexcluded\nlike they want nothing to do with you\nthat's the one yeah there it is\nso i want to point something else out to\nyou lou that's interesting because you\ncall yourself materialistic when you\ntell that story\nyeah why do you do that because it\nis it's quite quite expensive bracelet\neveryone pitches in 20 pounds\nbut to me it wasn't really about the\nbracelet it was about\ni don't think it's about to bracelet to\nanyone who's listening to that story\nokay right but i want you to notice what\nyour mind does\neven when you're sharing something that\nis\nauthentic vulnerable and that maybe you\ndeserve\ncompassion for what do you do to try to\nthe kind the what do you preemptively do\nto our compassionate response\num to try to like\nuh squash it yes yeah right interesting\nhuh\nyou see how you're doing that\nyou're actually devaluing yourself\nin the story\nyou're like look at me i'm a\nmaterialistic little [ __ ]\nand then you tell the story which is not\nabout i don't think anyone\nthinks that that's materialistic i think\nit's about\nfairness and\njustice sounds bizarre but like you know\ni think it's about value\nit's about being valued about being\nappreciated\nit's not a story about material things\nright yeah\nyeah i and yet your mind generates this\nthought which is like oh i'm so it\nsounds kind of materialistic thought we\nwere going to talk about like\nyou know everyone had a louis vuitton\nbag and like i didn't have one or\nsomething like that\neven then that's okay i guess but\nyou know that sounds to me like they\nthey really i mean you were\nyeah i mean i it doesn't sound to me\nlike they were your friends\noh yeah but i don't talk to them anymore\nit kept\nmore things kept happening and then i\nrealized this\njust making me sad actually um\nthey used to sort of say that i always\nmake myself a victim um\nwhich made well the rest of my life\nreally hard because whenever anything\nhappened to me uh i would be like\nuh i'm just making myself a victim here\nyou know\nam i overreacting there it is so so do\nyou see that if you're\nif you're just making yourself a victim\nwhat are you doing to yourself\nyou're devaluing yourself\nright you take the\noomph out of whatever complaint you have\nblaming the victim and calling someone a\nvictim\nis the last refuge of [ __ ]\nbecause because if if you're just being\na victim all the time then like\ni'm perfect the problem's you\nright it's a very very very easy way to\ndodge any kind of personal\nresponsibility\nto blame the victim or say that\nyou know lou what's wrong with you\nyou're a vic like you're so victim\ncomplex like\nwe got you deodorant and donuts\nand the rest of us got charm bracelets\nand cakes on our birthday by the way\nor near our birthday not as an\nafterthought\nlike why are you whining why are you\nmaking me feel bad for being an [ __ ]\nand treating you like [ __ ] it's your\nfault\nyeah that's that sounds like what they\nwould say yeah\nyeah and then you started adopting the\nvictim mentality which has\nto do with so like if we think about it\nlike if if you start blaming yourself\nfor being a victim\nyou devalue your own experience does\nthat make sense\nyes and so when you devalue yourself\nlike your worth is a human being and\nyour mind decreases\ndoes that make sense yeah\nand if your worth as a human being is\nreally low why would anyone want to hang\nout with you\nthat's true i don't know why anyone\nwould\nso so i i think i mean it's kind of\nweird but like this idea of this person\nwants nothing to do with me\nto me feels very connected to this\nah yeah\ni think the the value uh thing is\ninteresting because\ni don't know if this is related at all\nbut um\ni used to get my nails done um quite\nfrequently before\nlocked down um and they\nalways turned out okay but there was\nthis one lady one week who\njust felt like she just like got a saw\nand just chopping my fingers off like\nthey were just they were bleeding\nand i was sat there like tears streaming\nlike and she was like oh oh i'm sorry i\nhope it hurt\nbut i didn't want i didn't want her to\nfeel bad that she was doing a bad job so\ni was sat there like oh no\nthey're fine and then for the following\nfew weeks\nevery time i went to shower they would\nsting in the shower my nails snapped off\ni had to wear plasters on them and i was\ni was beating myself up over it like you\nknow\nyou're such a [ __ ] you should have just\nyou should have said you know mate can\nyou cool off my nails a bit\num but i didn't do that and\nyeah i just i kept yeah\ni get myself into these situations a lot\nso how do you think that's related you\nstarted that off with like i'm not sure\nif this is related but\nthis thing happened to me so you tell me\nhow it's related\nwhy does your mind go there because\nmy thing\nthe pain i was in was worth less\nthan whether or not she thought she was\ndoing a good job\nbeautifully put\nright and then what do you do to\nyourself so like that's true\nbut then what happens in the shower what\ndo you do to yourself\nevery time you're in pain what does your\nmind tell you what\nwhy you such a [ __ ] idiot like yeah\nyeah right so like this is kind of weird\nlou but like you're setting up\nyou're playing a rigged game\nand it's a game where lou doesn't get to\ncomplain\nand it's always lou's fault\nyeah how fun is that game to play\num a lot of fun though\nyeah sounds quite shitty\ni'm thinking but also giving you space\nto speak\nokay i\nokay i don't i don't quite know what to\nsay\ni don't know either so can i think for a\nsecond yeah\nyeah go ahead so now that we've\npotentially made this discovery\nnow i'm like okay great now what\nthat's what i'm thinking okay what do we\ndo with this\nright so let me let me just give you a\nsecond to try to figure out where we go\nfrom here\nokay okay that's fine what are you what\nare you thinking right now\num it's just a lot of painful memories\njust\njust came back about tell me about those\ngirls and tell me tell me something\num so\ni just there was it's the same group of\nsame group of girls there's one time it\nwas\nthe first time that i'd ever\nthis is really embarrassing to say it\nwas the first time i've ever been like\nnaked in front of someone\nwe went to get a spray tan together\num i i was 18\nand it was for it was for like the the\nprom at the\nat the end of like i guess that's what\nyou have called it was called the levers\nball or something\num but we went to get a spray tan\ntogether i didn't actually know you're\nsupposed to\nlike get get naked for a spray tan\nso uh that was a surprise um but i did\nshe had hers done and then i went to get\nmine done straight afterwards and then i\nwent back into the changing room\nto put my stuff back on my clothes back\non\nand she\nshe said to me um\nwhat the [ __ ] is wrong with your nipples\nthey look blue i don't\ni mean i don't think i have blue nipples\num but she said that and then she said\num\nwhen you have sex with a guy don't\ntake off your top because he's not going\nto want to [ __ ] you\num and at the time i was just\ntrying my hardest not to look upset by\nthis because i knew that she'd call me\nsensitive\nso i was i was just like okay laughs and\nlike\njoked along and and then when i got home\ni couldn't stop thinking about it and\nit meant that the rest of my\nrelationships i\ni used to just keep my shares on\ncrap\nwhat do you think about that story now\ni think that my nipples aren't [ __ ]\nblue\nso there's there's something important\nthere i mean there's a lot that's\nimportant there but i just want to point\nsomething out to you\nyeah you look like you're processing\nstill\nyeah i'm gonna give you a second you let\nme know when you're\nready okay\ni'm ready so\nif someone says something like that\nabout you yeah\nthere's a there's like if someone says\nsomething mean about you there's like\nthis counterpoint right there's like a\nno my nipples are normal or whatever\nbut the point is when someone puts you\ndown\nthere's a voice within you that says no\nthat isn't true\nand what did you do to that voice\nsquashed it yep and so then what becomes\ntrue for you\nwhat's left what they what they said to\nme\nyeah and so if we think about it like\nwhen we think about\nat the very beginning of this\nconversation i sort of mentioned to you\nthat like your mind\ngenerates these thoughts right\nand like where do those thoughts come\nfrom they come from like the mind\ngenerates thoughts that it thinks are\ntrue\nbut the truth like the the thought\ngenerating machines in your mind i think\nwere formed by experiences like this\nbecause they were allowed to become true\ncertain opinions\nabout you as a person stood unopposed\nin fact if anything and be careful\nbecause i'm not blaming you for this\nbecause but it could seem like an\nindictment i could make it sound like\nit's your fault so be careful okay\nbecause\nwatch out if the victim complex comes up\nbut you basically\nstabbed yourself in the back right\nbecause instead of fighting against that\nthought and i'm not\nsaying that this is your fault so be\ncareful victim complex don't derise\nor if it does arise you let me know but\nbasically what happened is for a long\ntime it sounded like you have some real\n[ __ ] people in your life\nthat were laying the foundation of the\nway that you viewed yourself\nand so like go ahead sorry\ni i will say quite\nnasty things about myself to other\npeople\nbecause then it hurts less hearing them\nyou own it right yeah\nwhy do you call yourself pooper noodle\nagain\ncause because i shot in a sink\nand if you call yourself pooper noodle\nwhat does that let you do\num i don't own it\nand then it hurts less yeah\nwe're gonna just sit quietly for a\nmoment okay\nif you need me to say something please\nlet me know\nokay i'm feeling emotions too\nokay i have tears welling up in my eyes\nthat's that's very nice\num okay\nyeah what are you feeling right now\num\ni don't i don't know i am\nthis there's something else that i do as\nwell as say nasty things about myself\nand i don't know how to explain this i\ndon't know why i do it\num but i will\nactively go out sometimes but\non a really good day sometimes i will\nactively go out online\nsearch my name and look for the really\nnasty comments about me and i would i\nwould do it to myself\nand i will look for the nasty things i\ndon't know if it's to like uh\nprepare myself or\ni don't i don't know uh\nbut yeah i do that quite often\nthat makes a lot of sense to me can i\nhave a moment to figure out how to\nexplain it\nyes you can\ni think it comes down to\nwell i'm just going to toss out a random\nkind of story is that okay\nyeah go ahead\nsometimes people torture themselves on\nsocial media before they go to bed\nit took me a while to like figure out\nwhy they do this but i don't know how\nelse to describe it but like\nyou know sometimes when it's like late\nat night and you may be feeling good\nabout yourself you may be feeling bad\nabout yourself\nbut then what you do is you hop on\nsocial media and you look at all\nof the wonderful things that other\npeople are doing\nand it just makes you feel like [ __ ] but\nyou just sign up for that torture\nlike you log on and you gravitate\ntowards\nseeing all of these happy people and\neach person that you see\nmakes you feel worse and worse but you\njust keep looking\nand you know you do it to yourself and\nyou do it to yourself\nand sometimes you're feeling good and\nsometimes you're feeling bad sometimes\nit's sort of like\nconfirming what you already suspect and\nsometimes it's like\nknocking you down a peg because you\ndon't deserve to feel good about\nyourself\nyeah and in your case\ni think hope is a dangerous thing\nbecause if hope yep\ni think hope is a dangerous thing\nbecause you've been\nat the bottom of the pecking quarter you\nknow you can survive that\nright like it's familiar territory you\nknow how to play this game\nyou've played this game before you're\nactually really good at speed running\nthis game\nwhen lose at the bottom of the totem\npole you spend you spend so much time\nknocking yourself down\nyou know exactly what it looks like you\ncan survive\nthat you're actually quite strong and\nyou know you're strong you know if\npeople think you're [ __ ]\nyou'll survive that because you've\nsurvived it for a long time i was about\nto say\nyour entire life but that's not true\nwhat's dangerous\nis if you're not at the bottom of the\ntone pole because being at the bottom\nyou're used to falling to the bottom\nthat hurts so much\nmore yeah\nit's the possibility that you may not be\nat the bottom which is absolutely\nterrifying\nwhat do you think about that\num i\nyeah that's very well put hadn't thought\nof it like that\num\nyeah i don't know if it's related but\ni've always been told i'm quite\npushover um as well\num so\nso so so when i am you know assertive\nit's a huge victory\nfor me just just a small thing\nlike telling a sexy driver that my seat\nbelt is stuck in the door\num but the the\ntotem pole thing i\num yeah i don't\ni yeah\nsorry i'm thinking and trying to speak\nat the same time it's not working\ni [ __ ] that up on the on a daily basis\ni should use your line\num it's a good one\num normally like yeah\nnormally before like uh doing something\nlike this\ni would i'll drink or like\nlike because in the past\nlike at a university and stuff i've\nalways been really\nboring sober and then when i drink\nthe next day people would be like oh you\nyou're so much fun\nwhen you drink you stream more often you\nshould you come out oh\nyou're so funny last night um so then\ni start to think that i'm like i can't\nbe\nfunny without without alcohol i don't\ndrink very often\nbecause i don't socialize very often\nmaybe like once a month\num but when i do i drink excessively\nbecause i feel like i have to catch up\nto everyone else's social level\nof of being you know\na social person um so\nyeah and then it always backfires\nbecause i can't tell you how many people\nthat i've tried to make friends with at\nuniversity\nbut um i [ __ ] it up the first night\nbecause they invited me out for drinks\nand then i drank too much\nand i they had to take me home from the\nclub and i threw up in the taxi and then\nthey never spoke to me again\num that's happened\nquite a lot i've ruined it for myself\nreally with the alcohol um\nyeah quite good at ruining things for\nyourself\nyeah yeah pro\nyou know one of the hardest things about\nsubstances so\ni don't know how many people know this\nbut in my day job i'm actually an\naddiction psychiatrist so i work\nprimarily with addictions\noh you know you know what the hardest\naddiction is to crack\nit's when people tell me that when i use\nthe substance\ni feel the way that other people look\ni feel normal yeah\nyeah because it's it's\neasy to give up something\nbut it's hard to give up that which\nmakes you normal\nit's a big ask\nyeah that's what it is right you get to\nbe\nnormal you get to be funny\nyou get to have people like you you get\nto not think those things about yourself\nthat sober you likes to think\nyeah but then the next day i do\nabsolutely right\nso here's the thing about drinking the\ngood point\nyou're not actually normal when you\ndrink you're just taking a loan\nyou're gonna have to pay that back right\nbecause all of the self-judgmental\nthoughts are gonna come\nroaring back and you're actually going\nto sabotage your relationships but man\nis it really sweet like it's just like a\nloan it's like\nwhen i get like a loan from a bank and\ni'm sitting on like ten thousand dollars\nof cash like\nthat's awesome i get to buy whatever the\n[ __ ] i want\nyeah pay it back\ni hadn't thought of it like that\nright so then and the thing is usually\nwhen it comes substances as i'm sure\nyou've learned\nyou pay it back with interest because\nthen those people\ndon't call you again in that situation i\nthink it's fair to say i mean so\ndon't get me wrong i want to be\ncompassionate and empathetic\nbut if you hang out with people for the\nfirst time and you vomit in a taxi\nlike i wouldn't expect those people to\ncall you again right you're kind of\n[ __ ] up there\nlike yeah\nthey had to pay flippy quid yeah\nlike don't get me wrong i i don't i mean\ni i blame you for it and i forgive you\nfor it because\nwe're allowed to make mistakes right\nthat's part of life\nbut let's like be clear and like it it's\na mistake\nyeah drinking too much vomiting in a\ntaxi and alienating people\ngenerally speaking in the grand scheme\nof life is a mistake\nyeah now when someone tells you that\nyour nipples look strange\nand you laughing it off and believing\nthat about yourself and being\nself-conscious\nthat's not a mistake\nthat really isn't fair for you to think\nabout yourself\nand and it's really mean that she said\nthat and i the\nsame part of me that you know\ni guess holds you to the standard of\nmaking a mistake for bombing the taxi\nalso says that you don't deserve that\nsure like you deserve the taxi vomit 50\nquid\nfine but like this the rest of the stuff\nthat you do to yourself you don't\ndeserve\nyou also don't deserve to believe and\ni'm not blaming you for believing this\nthat\nyou're not a delightful person without\nalcohol because you seem delightful to\nme\nare you drunk right now no okay no\nbecause that would really torpedo my\nargument real fast wouldn't it\nyeah i think uh\nit's interesting that you keep using the\nword deserve um\nsomething\nso\nsomething happened to me last year um\nand i wrote about it online\nand for the whole world to see\num and\na lot of people said\nuh you know how\nhow did she not see the red flags\nwhat [ __ ] idiot um\nlike you know she deserved this to\nhappen to her sort of thing\nand i i i do\ni do um sort of believe that\nyou do believe what\nthat um i just deserved this bad\nthing to happen to me because i was\n[ __ ] stupid\ni think about that for a second yes\ndo you mind if i um and i want you to\nthink about this question before you\nanswer it\nokay do you mind if i add some\nor ask you some just basic questions\nabout context remember we talked about\nthis\nyes are we going to offer more context\nare we going to skip past the context\nwhichever one you want to do um\ni\nlet's get past okay yeah\nokay yeah does that feel like the right\nmove to you\num uh\n[Music]\nyes okay okay you feeling good about\nthat\nwe good you're judging yourself again\nwhat's going on\nyour face is changing i see it what are\nyou doing what are you telling yourself\nuh the i'm gonna think about this a lot\nlater\nthat's okay you're allowed to think\nabout it what else you're doing that lip\nbiting thing that you do when you're\njudging yourself\nuh i i feel bad that i didn't want to\ngive context nope and\ni am worried that i made your show bad\nby not doing that\nthere it is okay so just notice what\nhappened right so there come the\nthoughts again\nand you believe them to be true they're\ntelling you they're true\nyou see that they feel true to you yeah\nare they true i don't know\nokay okay good i'll take and i don't\nknow but just acknowledge that they feel\ntrue that's totally cool\nthey feel true to you it turns out i\ndon't think you [ __ ] anything up\nthat's my opinion okay okay but i'm\nmaybe your mind sort of tells you oh\nhe's just saying that\nand he would be\nalmost like i do this for a living\nso lou it's it's totally fine man\ni think i think we can you don't have to\ngo into context you're not like a weak\nperson like oh my god\nshe'd be so much stronger if she spoke\nout because that's what you're supposed\nto do\nright it's it's you do you man\nso be careful because don't there you\nlike it it's there again too because\nyou have an impulse which is like this\nis what lou wants to do\nlou's nipples aren't weird and what do\nyou do to that impulse\nright so so now i want you to really\nnotice\nthat that's just your reflex of\ndevaluing the way that you feel\nyou're putting you're knocking lou down\nto the bottom of the totem pole\nfor the sake of the show\nif i don't give a [ __ ] about the show\nyou certainly shouldn't give a [ __ ]\nabout the show\noh all right something changed\nright so so how did we do that like how\nare you feeling right now\nuh uh\nexposed okay and how does it feel to\nfeel exposed\num i'm worrying about\nwhat's gonna happen later\nokay okay\ni think you're allowed to do that but\nbut what i'm hearing\nis something this so let's just track\nthrough what happened through your mind\nright so i asked you\nshould we ask more context or uh provide\nmore context or not\nand then yeah you didn't want to which\nis totally fine\nright because i think it's actually not\nthat important we can get a lot out of\nthis\nokay and and then you started to judge\nyourself\nand then you were thinking like this lou\nis bad in the moment she's [ __ ]\nthings up now\nand then we've sort of noticed that that\nyou're like beating yourself up again\nthat you're devaluing yourself remember\nthe show\nis more important than your feelings\nlike you did it again\nyeah that same program it's like a bot\nthat's just like\nauto run stuff for you and then we\nnoticed it and that and now you started\nworrying about the future which i think\nis a different bot\nbut it's not the same bot does that make\nsense yes\nyeah you weren't like devaluing yourself\nyou were like just maybe now you're\ncatastrophizing\nor something like that yeah yeah but\nbeating yourself up and devaluing\nyourself is not the same as\ncatastrophizing\nagreed yes\nno yeah oh no i forgot what's gonna say\nit's okay\nwhat i'm talking about is quite abstract\nand hard to hold on to\ni also get the sense that you're doing\nby the way you're doing really well\ni think it's hard for people to learn so\nmany different things that are new\nall at the same time and are able to\nkeep up\nyeah i feel like maybe like 20 of it is\ngoing in\nthat's why i'm yeah i think it's\nprobably closer to 80 but that's you\ndoing it again you see it\nbut you're gonna take 80 and you're\ngoing to turn it into 20 in your mind\nyes do you see how like it's automatic\nman\nhow do you notice it so well i don't\nnotice it at all\nyeah well i mean now we're gonna get to\nred flags\nso the reason i notice it well are two\nreasons one is i'm on the outside\nuh-huh right the second thing is\ni practice so you can learn to notice it\ntoo because you can notice it if i\npoint it out to you so all you have to\ndo is you have certain programming\nthat has taught you to take opinions\nabout yourself\nand knock them down in the same way you\ncan start to\nprogram being able to notice opinions\nabout yourself\nand recognize that these are not\nactually fair opinions this is just your\nprogramming\nyou have internalized the opinions of\nthat group of girls\ndoes that make sense\num yeah sorry i'm bouncing around a lot\nyou can also\ninternalize what i am telling you it\njust takes practice\nso you can learn how to know this too\nit's really cool you have to forgive me\ni'm an academic so\nwhen i sometimes i could say things\nsimply and then instead i make them\ncomplicated and hard to understand\nit's so it's all right um\nit's the way we feel good about\nourselves because then we feel smarter\nthan everyone else\nwhen we say something and the rest of\nthe world doesn't understand it just\nmeans we're brilliant and they're idiots\nand then we're like oh when actually\nwe're the ones who are stupid\nbecause if we're teachers our job is to\nhelp people understand\ndo you think i'm understanding i think\nyou're understanding a lot more than you\ngive yourself credit for\nokay i'm not making it easy on you by\nthe way\nno this is this is great this is\nvery uh informative\nshould we get back to it okay yeah go on\nhow are you feeling right now real quick\nuh oh what did i say\nthat i felt exposed yeah\nyeah yeah i'm worried about later\num what um\nokay um um\nno um you know what i'm i'm not gonna\nskip past it\num see look no she just did\nyeah last year\ni um i was uh i was assaulted\nby someone and um\ni wrote about my experience online\nand a lot of people\nreach out to me afterwards about it\nuh people that i hoped i\nwould never hear from again\nfor example there those those girls from\nhigh school\nread um [ __ ]\nnice my stuff and reached out to me\nbut exes that i hoped i'd never speak to\nagain\nreached out to me um it was\nit was it was weird it was really weird\nsome guy that i went to school with who\ni only spoke to like maybe two times\nsent me a message on facebook saying oh\nhey i read your twitter longer\num if you ever need someone to talk to\ni'm here like\ni don't i mean i know these people they\nmean well\num but i think that's why i feel exposed\nright now because i'm i'm\nthinking about later like what's\nhappening yeah like who's gonna reach\nout to me and be like hey\ni saw i saw your interview you know\noh hope you're doing okay if you need\nsomeone to talk\nlike but there's people that i don't\nwant to hear from that's yeah\nthat sounds really ungrateful um but\noh no i just did it again didn't i ah\nhow did you learn how to do that\nbecause you made a face\nyou had like well i've [ __ ] faced\nthis all the time\nokay just a random pile of faces\nyou really can't blame me for that or\ncredit me for that\ni think that's you learning that's what\nlearning is like\nbecause i make okay [ __ ] i'm making a\nface right now like\nwhat does this mean no one knows\nyeah i can't tell yes\nmy face is about as rng as you can get\nokay so let's let's try to put some i'm\ngonna try to\norganize our discussion a little bit is\nthat okay yes\ndo you want some time to think nope i'm\ngood do you want some time to think\nno i'm great okay yeah\nso i i see a fork in the road we can\neither talk about\nlike you know what you're experiencing\nnow about like what is it that makes you\nnot want to hear from people\nwhat is it that makes you worried about\nthe consequences of this conversation\nor we can go back to this idea of\nnot seeing the red flags feeling stupid\nfeeling like on some level you may have\ndeserved it\nwhich direction do you want to go down\num the\nthe the deserving one okay\nso let's start with red flags can i tell\nyou story\nyes one of my favorite stories so when i\nwas an intern i just finished medical\nschool\nand i was an intern so like when you're\nan intern i'm a psychiatrist but when\nyou're an intern\nyou do all kinds of like physical\nmedicine so i was working in the icu\nand things like that learning how to\ntreat heart attacks and strokes and\npneumonia and all that kind of stuff\nso i one time had this patient that was\nan elderly woman\nwho um had pneumonia and\nlike what happens is you start your\nshift at like seven in the morning\nand it ends at seven at night so you're\nin the hospital for 12 hours\nso you're in in the hospital 12 hours a\nday\nsix days a week so um\nyou know we're taking care of the woman\nand she starts to do a little bit worse\nher breathing gets a little bit worse\nlike you know she starts to have\nher white count which is like the her\ncells that fight infection kind of jump\nup a couple things are happening we're\nkind of monitoring very closely\nthroughout the day because she seems to\nbe moving in the wrong direction\nso then when shift change happens around\n7 pm my\nmy colleague shows up at 6 30 and then i\nstart telling\nmy colleague about all the patients that\nthey're gonna have to watch overnight\nincluding my patients so you kind of\ntell them about all the patients\nand so i tell her tell him about this\nwoman i said hey you know she's we've\nbeen watching her we're like\nshe may need to go to the icu at some\npoint she's not doing as well\nand then he kind of takes a look at her\nlike data and stuff and he's like\nlistening to the story and she's like\nand he starts freaking out he's like\ndude she needs to like she needed to be\nin the icu hours ago\nlike look at this man like she's not\nbreathing well her white count is up\nshe's like like like just look at her o2\nlevels her oxygen levels and he starts\nlike freaking out\nand then i start to feel like really\nreally bad because like as he's\nrepeating this stuff back to me\nlike it sort of like makes perfect sense\nbecause he's like listing the data that\neverything that i literally just told\nhim\nand when he like packages it and gives\nit back to me i'm like oh [ __ ] this lady\nneeds to be in the icu\nand then and then he starts like really\npanicking and then he kind of like riles\nme up and then i feel terrible because i\nand i kind of tell him that you know\nwhen you're an intern you have two\nsupervising doctors so i kind of tell\nthem\nhey like you know i talked it through\nwith like the two supervising doctors\nand like they felt like we just talked\nabout this lady like two hours ago we\nwent and saw her two hours ago\nwe decided that we didn't think icu\ntransfer was appropriate\nand he's like well that's just idiotic\nlike she absolutely needs to be in the\nicu\nshe starts paging a bunch of people and\nlike people show up and they like take\nher to the icu and stuff and like i feel\nlike a complete dumb ass\ncause i'm like how did i miss this it's\nso obvious\nand so then later i went to one of these\nlike older doctors in the hospital like\nthese\nsuper wise guy you with me by the way\nhave i lost you yeah okay\nno no and then i i kind of tell them\nlike one day after like we have this\nconference and then at the end of the\nconference i kind of tell them hey like\ni think i kind of screwed up\nand he's like this nice guy that you go\nto when you have problems\nand i said like i don't know how i\nmissed this it happened right in front\nof my eyes\nand what the the doctor said next blew\nmy mind and he says well that's why you\ndidn't see it\nhe's like the hardest things to see are\nthose that happen\nright in front of you right when you're\ninside something every step of the way\nyou don't see the big picture you just\nsee like one step at a time\nand you're stuck in it\nand that's how you you miss it like if\nyou think about things like abusive\nrelationships or grooming or stuff like\nthat\neach step of the way feels okay\nit's when you zoom out that everyone's\nlike how can this person be so stupid\nand like literally if you if i put this\nin front of my eyes like i can't see any\nright the closer you are to something\nthe harder it is to notice\neven if we think about your thought\nprocess\nwhen your thoughts when you're really\nfused in your mind\nthey feel true to you and they're not\nopinions they're facts\nthey're not thoughts they're not\nemotions they're not feelings they're\nfacts\nyou tell yourself lou just isn't that\ngood of a person it feels like a fact\nwhen you gain distance from it\nwhen you learn to see it from the\noutside is when it becomes a red flag\nwhen it becomes a problem when it's no\nlonger true\nyes so the first thing is that other\npeople can see red flags from the\noutside but like that's because they're\nfrom the outside\nthe hardest mistakes to see are the ones\nthat we make\nnot the ones that other people make i\nmean take any [ __ ] person on the\nstreet they can tell you a thousand\nthings that you're doing wrong\nask them what are they doing wrong\nthey've got no answers\nso the first thing is are you stupid\ni don't think so what do you think\nyou're allowed to say yes i think i'm\n[ __ ] stupid\nwhat makes you feel like you're [ __ ]\nstupid you're allowed to believe that\num\ni i i\nwell and i feel stupid like\nlike just your story i i i missed\na lot of seemingly quite obvious\nthings but i i didn't want to\nto believe that this person was\nbad i\ni wanted to believe that they were a\ngood person\nit was harder for me to believe that\nthey were capable of doing something bad\nokay so what i'm\nit's gonna sound silly lou that doesn't\nsound stupid to me\nlet's just listen to your words i wanted\nto believe that this person\nwas better than they were that doesn't\nsound like idiocy\nthat sounds like faith in humanity and\nmaybe you can say that faith in humanity\nis stupid\nbut like literally lou what makes me\ngood at my job is believing exactly what\nyou believe\nanytime someone walks into my office i\nwant to believe that they can be better\nthan what they're suggesting\nyeah i want to believe that you are\nworth\nmore than you tell me your worth\ndoes that make me stupid\nwhether i'm stupid or not i'm i choose\nto believe it anyway\npeople can call me stupid for having\nfaith that you have value as a human\nbeing i know it sounds\na weird sentence but you know like like\ni don't think\ni don't think you wanting to believe\nthat someone was better than what you\nwhat they could have been i don't think\nthat makes you stupid i just don't\nor if it does i think stupidity is a\ngood quality\nand i do think that like i mentioned\nearlier it's like you get lost and stuff\nbecause it's in front of your face\nyeah i mean generally speaking i haven't\nseen any\nevidence that suggests that like you\nknow victims of sexual violence\nlike it's not about iq\nit's about emotions power dynamics\nkind of like predatory behavior\nlike victims aren't stupid they're\nvictims\nyou know i it doesn't i just don't\naccept that\ni mean you may be stupid like maybe\nyou're stupid but that has nothing to do\nwith you being a victim it's just like\nthose are different things what do you\nthink\num i i\nfeel like i um\nuh i feel like i'm not allowed to be\nhappy because\ni i mean i've had i've had people\nmessage me or say things before like you\nknow this\ngirl looks way too happy here she's\nobviously lying\nabout about the whole thing so\ni feel like i'm not allowed to be happy\nbecause then\num people would um\nbelieve me and you want people to\nbelieve you\nmore than i want to be happy\nthat's interesting\nso let's think about that for a second\nright so i thought that was very\na very authentic representation so what\ndo you think about someone who wants to\nbe believed\nmore than they want to be happy\nthat they're stupid probably\ni can see why you would come to that\nconclusion i\ni i i think though so what that tells me\nlou is that\ni i don't think it's stupid at all i\nthink that\num i laughed because it's i sort of\nwalked into that one\nin terms of your response because like\nof course like\nwhy wouldn't people choose happiness but\ni think it tells us a lot about you\nright so i think this goes back to like\nyou being seen\nand accepted for what you are\nand and your entire life you've been\nsort of like trying to be you\nand people have been swatting you down\nand now with something so important\nyou want them you don't want to swat\nyourself down\nlike you want people to believe you like\nyou want to say like you know\ntake your pick like six donuts is not\nokay\nyou know my i was about to make a\ncomment about your nipples but that's\njust gonna get taken out of context\nbut like you know take whatever whatever\nuh\nyou know context like whatever story\nlike there have been lots of times where\nyou've taken what you are on the inside\nand you've said i defer to the rest of\nthe world\nwhat i am gets second place\ncompared to like what y'all think but\nwhat i'm hearing you do is like put your\nfoot down\ndraw your line in the sand and say when\nit comes to this\ni'm not going to compromise and i need\nto be believed\nand this did happen and if happiness is\nthe sacrifice that it takes to be like\nauthentic and accepted then so be it\nyeah that doesn't sound stupid to me at\nall\nwhat do you think\ni feel um\ni i put a lot of pressure on myself\nbecause i\ni worry that if\nthat if i if i\nheal and i am happy and someone is like\nshe looks way too happy to clout\nchase and [ __ ] clearly lies about the\nwhole thing then\nwhat if they discredit\nother people's stories as well because\nbecause it seems like i am lying\nand then suddenly i\ni think i'm catastrophizing sort of\nsure see there you did it again look at\nthat\nyeah what are you starting to do\nyou're gaining distance from your\nthoughts because you were like about to\nlike you were boarding that train\nand it was like the seat belt isn't on\nit's starting to chug away and you're\nlike hey hold on a second\ncan you pull over i need to put the seat\nbelt on that's what you just did yeah\nyou just did it\nyeah yeah\ni did yeah interesting\nwhat happened to that that train of\nthoughts once you're like oh i'm\ncatastrophizing again\ni can't remember what i was talking\nabout there you go\npull the plug on it so if anyone here is\nwatching this is the way you pull the\nplug on anxiety\nlike i can't even remember like just\nimagine if i could give you a pill\nthat would make you literally forget\nyour anxieties because that's what we\njust saw happen you literally forgot\nyour anxiety like that's what you can't\neven remember what you were talking\nabout now\nyeah oh no i just remembered\nsee it takes work though doesn't it yeah\nokay good because the more you remember\nthe more you can practice forgetting and\nwhen you get really good at forgetting\nwhen you get really good at noticing\nthen you'll be in control\nbut keep going you want to finish your\nthought\nno okay\nso if i if i notice\nthese things what happens like i notice\nit and then what\ndid it still happen yes\nexcept every time you notice it you gain\na little bit of control over it\nright so if i notice my facial\nexpressions\nif i pay attention to them i can\ncontrol them\nright and if i'm not aware of what i'm\ndoing\nthen i don't control it\nso awareness precedes control\nif you've ever had dental work done and\nyou've had your mouth numb\nyou can't control anything in there\nbecause you can't feel it you're not\naware of it\nyou don't even know where your tongue is\nand so once you become aware of\nsomething\nthen you can do something about it\nokay does that how do i\nhow do i do that with social anxiety\nsame way it's just it can be harder\nright so you're like so i'm helping you\ndo it and your mind is in a very\naware state right now and you're going\nto be exhausted after this i'm going to\nbe exhausted too\nyeah and\nand then what happens is like you're\ngoing to do it again and you're going to\ndo it again and you may have someone to\nhelp you like\ntherapists may be a good idea in your\ncase\nif you don't have one already and then\nyou're going to practice this\nand then what's going to happen is like\nmaybe when it comes to\n[Music]\nyou know but i think in social anxiety\nit's the same\nlike you're going to notice yourself\ncatastrophizing you're going to notice\nyourself like you're you're like\nsomeone's going to invite you over\nand then you're going to have that\nthought pop in your head oh they don't\nactually want to see you\nthey just want your 20 quid and then\nyou're going to notice that thought\nyou're going to be like no\nactually that's not true they do want to\nsee me\nyeah so it's the same thing\nsometimes the stakes can feel higher and\nso it can be harder to overcome there\ncertainly is like level one level two\nlevel three level four\nin terms of difficulty but it's the same\ni yeah so something happened like\na couple weeks ago where um\ni like um everyone at the moment\nplaying this game among us right and a\ncouple weeks ago\nuh i'm in all these lobbies and i tried\nto join this\nthis random one and there were the\nstreamers in there who i\ni thought i was friends with so i felt\ncomfortable going in there\ni was only in it for like like maybe\nthree\nthree games um but i just i had this\nreally\nembarrassing moment where i went into\nthis\nschool and like\nin my head this was a disaster but in\nthe call\nit i i couldn't imagine anyone in there\nprobably doesn't remember this at all\num but there was this one guy who was\ncalling everyone by their names\nand then he was calling me by my color\ninstead of my name\nkept calling me orange instead of poop\nnoodle and it really\nupset me and\num eventually i was like hey my name is\npooper noodle\nand then it's like it looks like a\nlittle bit of a lull it went a little\nbit quiet and then everyone just carried\non\num but after that i i couldn't say\nagain i just i closed closed the game\nleft core i didn't want to make a scene\ni was like i gotta go\nuh and and then i i just i spent like\nthe rest of the day just crying\nabout it about about just getting called\norange\nuh and it's it was pathetic\nokay so i i'm guessing that the reason\nyou brought that up\nis because we're gonna use this as a\ncase for understanding\nis that okay let's analyze it okay\nis that that's what i'm seeing\nis the clearest relevance to me is that\nokay\nyes i think it's a great example i think\nit's a beautiful example i think it ties\ntogether everything we've been talking\nabout today\nso what would you rather have than\nhappiness\nwe were talking about this right\nbecause you felt stupid because you\nwanted\ni wouldn't want it to be believed yeah\nright so this goes back to this idea\nthat there's like two kinds of blues\nthere's the real lou and then there's\nthe loo that everyone else sees\nthere's a part of you that yearns to be\nseen and accepted\nand you're willing to sacrifice that\npart for the most\nmost of the time but there are some\nthings that you're not willing to\ncompromise on\ndoes that make sense yeah this is like\nthis is like the real you that's like\nfighting to say i don't have blue\nnipples\ni am a good person i'm worth more than\nsix donuts\nand deodorant you know yeah i'm a cool\nperson like it's not about popularity or\nanything like that but like i'm a good\nperson and i deserve to be seen\ni deserve to be treated and judged for\nwho i am\nas opposed to who people think i am\nthat's why that person isn't gonna take\norange from anyone\nyou're not gonna you're not gonna be\norange\ndo you want them to see who you are\nyeah so i think it's that same part of\nyou\nand it speaks up it says damn you\ni'm pooper noodle and i would like you\nto address me as such\nright and then something really funny\nhappens like so when you do that and you\nstand up for yourself\nwhen you tell the driver to pull over\nbecause your seat belt isn't on\nthen it runs very contrary to all of\nthis programming\nwhich is like you've been telling\nyourself you've practiced really really\nhard you've leveled up a lot\nin terms of devaluing yourself but\nthere's this part of you that's like\nis trying to break through this like\nhard soil and like start to bloom\nwhich is like who you really are and\nthen sometimes it pops its head up and\nthen you enter this\nperiod of intense conflict because it\nruns\nagainst all of the programming that\nyou've been doing\nwhich is no no no they get to call you\nwhatever they want lou\nwhy are you inconveniencing them with\nyour name\nyeah yeah how dare you\nhow dare you inconvenience them\nand so it's like like there's a this\npart of you that wants to come up and\nthen there's this part of you and then\nthen you're crying all day because like\nthen it like then you're just kind of\nconflicted\nand that takes time to sort of work\nthrough right and that too comes with\ndistance\nwith sort of taking taking a step back\nand recognizing what's going on\nrecognizing that for a long time this\npart of you that\nknocked yourself down also i know this\nsounds really bizarre\nalso protected you\nbecause if you knock yourself down and\nyou hurt yourself\nno one can do can out do you\nand if you're the one knocking yourself\ndown at least you're in control\nand what you want more than anything\nelse is control\nyeah stacked up pillows against the door\nand listening what are you doing you're\ntrying to get control\nyou're trying to control the\ncircumstances\nso this is the hard thing about anxiety\nyou gotta let go of control\nyou gotta let people judge you and it's\nterrifying\nyeah i care a lot about other people's\nopinions like like way too much\nso let me ask you a crazy question\nwhat's harder\nknowing that everyone doesn't like you\nor not knowing if everyone doesn't like\nyou\nnot knowing right no it's weird\nyeah anxiety is a strange beast in that\nway\nyou're looking for certainty even you'll\ntake you'll take a certain\nbad thing over an uncertain bad thing\nyeah which is like then how the [ __ ]\nlike no wonder you feel the way that you\ndo\nbecause it's like i give you two choices\n100 chance of failure\n50 chance of failure which one do you\npick\nyou pick for 100 yeah\nand then it's like no wonder you're\nwhere you are\nyeah but it takes courage to take the\n50.\npeople look at that and they say you're\nstupid for picking 100 chance of failure\nno they just don't understand that's not\nhow psychology works you're not stupid\nit's that\nthe other way to think about it is\ncontrol versus not control\nand are you stupid for picking control\nright yeah\nyes i don't know what the answer was\nyeah i don't know sorry this this is\nwhere i get too abstract\nsome people follow me some people can't\nit's not a big deal it's more on me than\nit is on you\nokay but does that make sense where you\nyou sort of at least when you beat\nyourself up\nyou control the pain yeah and you can\nsurvive that you're used to that\nyes so i think the orange story is a\ngreat one\nbecause i think it's sort of like you\nknow you kind of fight against yourself\nand then like that thing comes\nroaring back and so the next time i\nwould say the next time you stand up for\nyourself\nbe aware that the part of you that\nhas made yourself a pushover so that\nother people will like you\nwill be very upset there's one part of\nyou that's like\ni'm going to let other people do\nwhatever the [ __ ] they want to me\nbecause then they'll like me\nand then there's another part of you\nthat's like nah\nbecause you were upset that everything\nwent quiet\nyeah oh my god\ni inconvenienced them i'm sorry lady\nwho's doing my nails that you're putting\nme into physical pain\ndid i inconvenience you by telling you\nthat you're physically hurting me and my\nnails are bleeding\ni'm so sorry\nyeah yeah um\nthat's exactly what goes on yep and if\nyou\nif you would have told her then what\nwould you do to yourself afterward\nwhat do you think would happen if you\ntold her to stop\ni had i'd been thinking about like\nhow awkward it was that i had to tell\nher just to stop and then i'd be like\nanalyzing her face like was she sad\nabout it was she upset that she was\ndoing her nails\nmy nails badly i'm terrified of like uh\nconfrontation\n[Music]\nand you'd be torturing yourself yeah\nyou see so anytime lou tries to break\nout of the surface\nthere comes anxiety it's like how dare\nyou\nhow dare you be a person lou how dare\nyou have feelings\nhow dare you have value\nthoughts questions okay\nno nothing's going on right now\nyep at all i think we're close to being\ndone for the day\nokay how does that feel to you\num\ni'm tired yep\ni can't already for bed yeah\nwait do i look tired there it is\nno i i can tell you that you're\ncognitively spent\nokay i'm cognitively spent too\nhow do you feel about me saying that\nbad yeah see\nthat's okay is that not a bad thing\ndo you normally get cognitively spent\nyes\nokay i'm out of mana\nyou're out of mana we've been casting\nspells for a while\nthat doesn't make us bad people it\ndoesn't make us weak it doesn't make us\nstupid it just means we're out of mana\nwe've been doing this [ __ ] for like an\nhour and a half now\noh wow yeah yeah\nstraining your wealth your cognitive\nstraining your brain for an hour and a\nhalf is gonna make you um\nyeah do you want to learn how to\nmeditate\num oh okay\nwell then what was that ooh\num\ni've tried to do it meditation before\num but two\nthings i'm very lazy and also\num i\ni find that it doesn't maybe i've not\nbeen doing it for long enough\nbut it doesn't it doesn't quite turn\ndown\nmy my thoughts i've i'm terrified of\nbeing alone\nwith them yeah\nokay i think that's\nreasonable can i think for a second\nyes\ni may need longer than a second i may\nneed a minute or two\noh okay do you\ndo you want to do if you don't want to\nlearn how to meditate we don't have to\ndo anything\nfirst okay okay\nwhat do you think what's the second\nthing\nis if you do want to learn something\nthen i'll try to teach you something\ni'm wondering if if you're going to take\nthe out for both of us because i'm not\nsure what to teach you\nbut i'll figure something i have an idea\ni oh\ni i i just i i\nfeel like i'm doing it wrong because\nit's supposed to help isn't it and it\njust\nmakes things worse is it\nam i doing it i've thought maybe\nno you're you're not doing it wrong\nyou're being taught the wrong kind of\nmeditation\nokay okay right it's kind of like if i\nwalk into the shoe store\nand i put on a pair of shoes that's my\nsize\nthe problem isn't that my feet are or\nlike let's say i\nput on a pair of shoes it's too big the\nproblem isn't that my feet are too small\nit's that the shoe isn't the right size\nright you have to do meditation that\nfits\nfor your mind so i'm just trying to\nthink about what have you tried\ndo you like what kind of meditation\ndoesn't help let's start there\num\nmindfulness yep mindfulness is going to\nbe terrible for you\noh like mindfully\neating and like looking at a little\ngrape\nso let me okay\num so so let's let's think about why\nmindfulness is not gonna i mean\nwe can do a mindfulness practice if you\nwant but mindfulness\ntends to be sitting back and observing\nthere are two kinds of meditation\nthere's a focusing meditation and an\nobserving meditation\none is where you watch what your mind\ndoes\nand then the second is when you tell\nyour mind to do something\nso in your case if you're feeling like\npretty anxious i think there are a\ncouple of breathing techniques that\ncould help you\nbut i sort of feel like breathing\ntechniques isn't the right fit bizarrely\ni want to teach you something like a\nmindfulness practice\nbut i want to teach you a very\nstructured one okay even though i\ndon't think it's really great for you\nbut we're going to try something because\ni think you actually have a talent for\nit in a particular\nway we try something a little bit\nunusual\nyeah okay um i reserve the right for\nthis to not work\nand then i want to be able to try to\nteach you something else\nokay that okay yeah i want you to close\nyour eyes\nokay okay so today lou we've been\ntalking about\nthe different programs in your mind\nright so like there's like the lou that\nwants to come forward and like wants to\nbe believed wants to be seen wants to be\nheard\nand there's the lou that tries to swap\nher down\nyeah so what i'm gonna do is i want you\nto watch carefully now\ni'm to make a statement and i want you\nto eyes\nnope okay how do i pay attention listen\ngood point like i said i deserve to [ __ ]\nthis one up\ni mean i i reserve the right to [ __ ]\nthis one up okay\num so i want you to listen carefully to\nwhat i say\nand i want you to watch your mind and\nwatch your mind's response\nokay and just notice for a second i'm\njust gonna speak\nwords but that those words they're just\nwords it's like\nyou know my name is red\ni like balloons words are words they\nhave no meaning\nbut i want you to see how the words that\ni speak\nare going to evoke responses in your\nmind\nokay and tell me what the responses are\nready\nyeah you are a wonderful person\ndo i do i tell you yeah tell me\nwhat happens in your mind when i say\nthat\num\njust trying to be nice that you are\ntrying to be nice what happens\neyes closed oh sorry okay\nuh whoever saying that just trying to be\nnice to me okay\nso so you notice how your mind responded\nto that right\nyeah you swatted it down\nyeah okay now number two\nyou are a terrible person\nwhat does your mind do in response to\nthat um\n[Music]\ntrue okay\nso that's kind of interesting right you\nsee how your mind responds\ndifferentially to those statements\nyeah so now what i want you to do is try\nto figure out\nwhere do those thoughts come from\nuh you're not going to be able to\nso just give me what you got when i tell\nyou to\nfigure out where they come from what\nhappens what how can you look for where\nthey come from\ni don't know they just come from from me\nokay so where from you good\num\ni i don't know okay good\nwould it okay so good so you're doing it\nright i know it sounds weird\nso now i want you to think about so when\ni say you're a wonderful person\ntry to find wonderfulness within you\nokay\ndo you have wonderfulness anywhere in\nyou um\nyeah where\num\n[Music]\ni really like dogs okay\nand now so so where do you feel that\nright is that a is it a thought or a\nfeeling first of all\nthat's a feeling and what does that feel\nlike\nwonderful and where does it where do you\nhow\nhow can you know that you're feeling\nwonderfulness\nwhat is your experience of wonderful\num\nis there a right answer sort of not\nreally\ni've i have no idea okay good\nokay now i'm going to tell you something\nelse are you starting to feel\nself-conscious\nyeah because my eyes are closed good\nnotice that self-consciousness\nwhere is that feeling where is that\nfeeling\neverywhere good what does it feel like\ntell me\num\nlike like i'm like i'm gonna fall off a\nbuilding or something\nyep so so there's a sensation right\nof like something terrible is about to\nhappen\nnotice the lack of safety with your eyes\nbeing closed\nyeah it's like what are people thinking\nwhat is he doing what's his face doing\noh my god what do they think i don't\neven know where the computer is\nam i sitting in the right place yeah so\nyou're so notice that the\nthough all of those thoughts actually\ncome from the feeling not the other way\naround\ni want you to notice the vulnerability\nis generating thoughts in your mind\ndoes that make sense it's almost like a\nfountain that's just generating all\nthese [ __ ] random thoughts like\nis my camera still on am i sitting in\nthe right place\nwhat are they thinking what are they\nsaying like you see how it's like it's\nlike a fountain it's just spewing out\nthese random ass thoughts\nyeah like but somewhere there's a\nfeeling within you\nnotice that vulnerability you may feel\nit somewhere in your body what do you\nfeel in your body\num\nbut what can can can you can you repeat\nthe question\nyeah what do you feel in your body right\nnow what does\nvulnerability feel like in your body\nuh i'm sweating okay good what else\num pay attention to your\nthroat your chest\nheart stomach\num\ni feel a bit dizzy\nokay so now i want you to in a moment\ni'm going to ask you to open your eyes\nbut before i do that i want you to take\na snapshot of the way\ntake a screenshot of the way that you\nfeel and then we're going to open your\neyes\nand we're going to see how you feel\nafterward open\nokay what's happening\noh my god that's so weird where am i\nwhat's weird tell me i can see\nuh everything's much\nsmaller than i imagined it okay\nso by smaller you mean your fears right\ni mean the room okay\ncool things are smaller\nokay yeah awesome that means you're\ndoing it right\nso okay what about your fears\nthat yeah that too so interesting\nso now we're gonna do it again i know\nwe're at both oom but\nraid boss is at 10 we're going to keep\ngoing you ready\nyeah close your eyes again okay\nwhat comes up\num\ni can't see again there we go good so\nnotice that you can't see again\nso things are getting bigger yeah your\nfears are magnifying\nthe room is getting bigger\njust notice that all of that stuff for a\nmoment\nright notice how bad it feels\nand now open your eyes\nand now what's happening\nit's gone away what's gone away the\nscariness okay\nso guess what you just learned how to do\nwas was that meditation\nnope yeah sure you just learned to make\nthe scariness go away in meditation\ntechnique\nthat's what we're going to call it okay\nbut\ni i want you to really pay attention so\nyou can try this i think this is\nactually a good technique for you\nso i want you to just this is going to\nbe your technique i don't know that's\ngoing to work for anyone else\nbut what i want you to notice and you\ngot to tell me if i'm wrong\nokay lou you can't please just don't\ntell me what i want to hear\nwhat i want you to notice is that the\nsize of your fears\ngrows and shrinks\ndepending on what your eyes being open\nor closed\nyeah how vulnerable i am [ __ ] dumb\nyour eyes being opened and closed has\nnothing to do with the fears in the\nworld\nhas to do with your feelings has to do\nwith your sense of vulnerability\nbut the fear is the fear the fear the\nactual probability that something bad\nhappens is not going to change\nit's not going to alter wildly in the\nspan of 90 seconds whether you're doing\nthis or doing this\ndoes that make sense yeah but\nhow does it feel\nit feels like the fears become bigger\neven the roof becomes bigger the\nmicrophone is like in your face right\nlike everything is like pressing in on\nyou\nwith your eyes closed and so what you're\ndoing is like the world is like\ncoming in and then you open them and it\nzooms out\neverything feels smaller bigger smaller\nbigger smaller\nand so if you do this practice so you\nstart by doing it by yourself\nand then if there's someone that you\ntrust do it with them in the room\nand it's going to make it way harder\nand then go and do it in the public\nplace\noh no right\nbut here's the here's the crazy thing\nblue like stay with me now okay\ntry really hard you with me do your best\nyay all you're doing is\nopening and closing your [ __ ] eyes\nthe world doesn't change that rapidly\ndo you see how your fears will literally\ngrow or shrink\ndepending whether on whether your eyes\nare open or closed\nbut what if i get hit by a car well i\nmean\nokay so let's work let's not worry about\nthe public place yet\nlet's just focus on in the room and with\none person you trust\nokay okay i mean what if you get hit by\na car\ni i'm not saying you do it while you're\ndriving okay\ni'm saying like like if you have a\nbalcony\nlike go out onto the balcony or\nsomething like that\nokay but what what i really i don't know\nif you're\ngetting this or not which is fine\nbecause i know you're um and i'm out of\num so i'm asking a lot of you\nbut what i want you to notice is that\nliterally your fears can\ngrow or shrink depending on what your\neyelids are doing\nand do you see how like that's just not\nliterally like how the world works\nlike my chances of getting hit by a car\ndon't inc well maybe they do increase or\ndecrease if my eyes are closed but\nbad example or a good example on your\npart real five-head player\nbut generally speaking you know the fear\nor your value as a human being or all of\nthese other things that you're worried\nabout shouldn't change over the\nspan of 60 seconds if you open or close\nyour eyes does that make sense\nyeah but the feeling changes rapidly\nand so if you do this practice literally\nwhat you're going to\ngain is control over your fear\nyou're gonna learn the process of\nshrinking your fears\nor growing them and you're gonna see how\nthe mind shrinks fears and grows them\nand as you learn that you're gonna get\nliterally you're gonna get control over\nyour fear\nbecause you'll learn cognitively how to\nshrink it\nit's like a shrink-a-matic for your\nfears\ni like that\nso and even if what i'm saying to you\nright now doesn't make sense that's okay\nit doesn't need to make sense right now\njust do the practice do it a couple\ntimes a week just like go and like close\nyour eyes and just\nnotice like it's like closing your eyes\nis like opening the doors to your fears\nand then opening them is like putting\nthem all away\nyeah and yet it's still you still have\nwithin\nyou the capacity of putting them all\naway\nyeah questions i really like that\nno that's that's that sounds much better\nthan\nwhat i was doing before\num yeah yeah\nyeah you i think i'm glad it worked i\ndon't i guess i don't have to come up\nwith a backup then\noh i'm sorry\nno because i just i didn't know because\nit's it's a it's it's actually like a\nhigh level meditation technique\nit's not like a novice meditation oh\nyeah does that make me an\nexpert in meditation\nwhat does that thought evoke in you\nif i were to tell you lou you were an\nexpert at meditation\nwhat happens um\ni don't know it'd be pretty cool yes so\nthe short answer is yes\nyeah let me explain it to you this way\nyou spend so much time\nin your head so you're actually going to\nbe pretty good at meditation\nyeah right because from a very young age\nwhen other people were\ninteracting with the outside world who\nwere you interacting with\nme so you started leveling up meditation\nvery young\nyou've leveled up a skill you just\nhaven't found the right gear until today\nokay oh and so practice it\nokay any closing thoughts or questions\nbefore we wrap up for the day\num um\nhow do i not care about\nwhat other people think of me you do\ncare about what other people think about\nyou\nyou don't not care you just let yourself\ncare\ncaring is fine what i want you to learn\nlou is not to not\ncare what other people think it's to\ngain distance from the caring\nokay right\nyou're allowed to care what other people\nthink\nbut it doesn't have to control who you\nare\nokay you're perfect the way you are\nyou don't need to change you just need\nperspective on who you are\nnow it's a weird concept\nokay do you feel like he's just saying\nthat\nuh\ni don't know just it was just quite nice\nand yeah now i'm crying i don't know why\nso that's pretty so you know what's cool\nabout that\nis i just called you perfect\nand your mind didn't respond with he's\njust saying that\nyou were able to feel it it was able to\nsink in\nand i'm not saying it to be nice i think\nit's genuinely true\ni think you're amazing exactly how you\nare\nand that your life has been a confluence\nof circumstances\nto make you into a perfect and unique\nhuman being\nand that just because you have flaws\ndoesn't mean that you aren't perfect\nand that's part of life it's part of the\njourney of growth\nand i wish you all the best thank you\nthank you very
