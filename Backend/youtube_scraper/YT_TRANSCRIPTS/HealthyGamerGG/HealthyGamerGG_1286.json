    "transcript": "and uh speaking of that so we've opened\nup some more coaching spots so i think\nthat a lot of coaching spots filled up\nvery very quickly so just a quick\nbackground about who are coaches so\nthey're like\nthey're y'all so we take people from the\nfrom our community the healthy gamer\ncommunity\nand then we put them through training\nand they're designed to be like\nadvocates support\nsort of your your personal healer or a\ngroup healer\num to help you kind of figure out what's\ngoing on in your life and how to help\nyou move forward\ni train them to kind of work on problems\nlike loneliness disconnection motivation\nself-esteem confidence relationships\nprocrastination and things like that so\nif you guys are feeling disconnected\nare stuck you guys can go ahead and uh\nsign up for the coaching program here\num thanks for coming everyone uh so\nlet's just start with\nintroductions so can you tell us um we\ncan stop with\nstart with uh bobby um why don't you\njust tell us a little bit about kind of\nwho you\nare and and what's your involvement in\nthe smash community\nyeah absolutely what's up dr k thanks\nfor having us here\nyeah man good to see you again yeah\nlikewise likewise\nuh i'm bobby scar i'm uh been a melee\nplayer since 2006\nuh and you know i switched into\nranked number 69 best player of all time\nuh i'm actually trying to get back into\nthe game i want to get good again\nso we'll see if i can get better than\n69th\nin 2020 i think that hugo what do you\nthink if i'm top 50\nin like a year you give me top 100 all\nthe time right\nyeah easy if you could hit tactics you\ncould do it but that's a big if because\nso the melee community's grown two times\nsince i was big 2013 there was a huge\nsurge\nand now it feels like more people are\ngetting in the game so uh\nit's an exciting time to play melee\nbecause of the competition but uh\nyeah uh the past couple years i've\nmostly been commentating so\nyeah coming back to the game it'll be\nhard but um yeah happy to be here and\ntalk about uh things that are i guess\noutside of the game but super important\nto\nuh being a player in the melee community\nthe smash community and\nyou know what it means i feel like we're\ntalking about what it means to be in a\ngaming community\nin general so it's a topic really\nimportant to me\ncool thanks man jisoo\nuh yeah so um i mean first and foremost\ni'm just like\ni guess like a community artist and i\ngot my start\nsuper early on like i've been in the\nscene since i was like literally a\nchild like 15 um which now now i'm 22\nand there's like it's crazy because\ngrowing up i was like one of like the\nyoungest people if not like\ni'm not probably not the youngest but\nyou know like i was like part of the\nyounger crowd and now there's like i\ni'm growing up like that i see like 15\n14 even like 12 year olds like playing\nthe game\nand they like quadruple like shine your\nshield and they can like\nlike perfect frame one wave shine out of\nit and it's like it's crazy but anyways\nanyways um yeah like i would i've been\nto like all the tournaments and stuff\nand i kind of started the whole like\nselling your art there kind of thing and\nit started off as a hobby\nbut as smash grew um like all these\ntournaments and stuff got bigger so\nthat's kind of how i established myself\ncool sparkly piggy\nand tell us what you guys want to be\ncalled i'm just reading your discord\nnames\nyou can call me piggy that's fine okay\nyeah so can you tell us a little bit\nabout yourself yeah sure\nso uh let's see my name is kyle i have\nbeen in the smash community for six or\nseven years\num chicago scene for the most part i\nstarted out\nas a commentator at my locals just that\nwas the way that i liked experiencing\nthe game\num and then when i entered grad school\nfor psychology cognitive neuroscience\ni started researching the expertise\nacquisition of smash\nso uh i have both um oh\nthank you community experience and\nresearch experience but i think the\nthing that's going to matter most today\nis that i've been working uh\ndirecting running the scenes um\nattempt at a grassroots code of conduct\nfor the last two years\nso there's a lot of\nthings i would love to say or\ncommunicate or discuss today because\ni've got a lot of opinions having been\non the front lines for the last two\nyears\nexperiencing harassment experiencing\nunpopular decisions experiencing lack of\nsupport so i'm really glad to have\neverybody\nelse here today uh to to talk about that\naspect\nbecause there's a lot of feels and a lot\nof thoughts uh\nthat we should address and are finally\nbecause of the events of july\nbeing given the attention they deserve\nawesome thank you very much piggy um\ntk is that hi uh\nyeah ck breezy or tk it doesn't matter\nuh i guess\ntk's probably easier but uh yeah i'm tk\nbreezy i commentate\nsmash i've been commentating for the\nlast like i don't know 10 years\num mostly mostly the not\nmelee game like so whatever is like\ngoing on the side of melee i'm pretty\nmuch doing that but i do commentate\nmelee as well because i mean\nit's just a fun game to talk about um\ni don't know i've grown up in the smash\ncommunity like since you know since i've\nbeen in it for so long\nand you know things it's nice to see\nchange\nuh from the way things were before you\nknow there's a lot of stuff that i feel\nlike\nwe look back on we're kind of like and\nit's uh it goes even further\npast like with everything going on with\nthe metoo movement it's just like in\ngeneral like how people spoke and how\npeople interacted\na lot of that has like changed uh and a\nlot of that i've been able to see since\ni've been around for so long\nand it's nice to see but obviously uh we\nhave a lot more to still work on and i'm\nglad to be part of\nthis conversation and talk about what we\ncan do to continue to move forward\num and make this place a safer place and\na\nand a more inviting place for everyone\ncool\nand uh people call you hugo is that\nright\noh muted hugo or bugs is okay\nyou tell me what do you prefer hugs uh\nyou call me hugs\nokay yeah um i get to call him hugo\nyeah cause i've melted your brain twice\nand mafia\nwhatever dude all right so my name is\nhugo i've been\ncompeting in smash uh since about 2004\nand\nunlike my friend bobby scar here i am\npart of the top 100 old-time\nuh true credit words do yeah uh no no so\ni've been playing for a long time and\ni've seen the\nscene grow up from it's super super\nearly stages\nup until all the way uh to where we're\nat now\nand i've seen a lot of progress i've\nseen a lot of change but then there\nare always things that we can work on um\nand so this conversation seemed like\nsomething i definitely wanted to be a\npart of\num just because i've seen so much and\nespecially after the events of july so\nyeah happy to be here and happy to\nactually hear all your voices again it's\nbeen a while\ncool thank you guys very much for coming\nso let's start with this what happened\nin july\nbecause the events of july\na lot damn i don't even know where to\nstart who's gonna be the storyteller\nbecause to be honest i've been on\ni've been uh not as embedded right so i\nmean i can tell the story from a more\noutside perspective\nyou know what what i heard but does\nanybody want to volunteer\ni think about it but i also feel like\nthere are\nlike jisoo your actions directly\nimpacted\nwhat unfolded so i i don't know if\nyou're comfortable telling me i mean\nokay so i'm not gonna i'm gonna first\nand foremost say that i don't know\nevery single story like i think we all\ncan\nlike confidently say that there was like\ni mean the kotaku article was like\nthere's 50 plus like different\nallegations i don't think all of us i\ndon't think any of us had time to go\nthrough\nall 50 plus of those and like do the\nwhole thing\ndo the whole like crazy wall like let's\npiece all the like\nstories together and like figure that\nstuff out i just know\nlike what i know and basically\nwhat happened was that like so i'm i was\nkind of on the sidelines too\nbecause i was actually like on a break\nfrom social media like i was taking a\nbreak from smash\ni was just focusing on school like\nartwork my career\num and like i would like loosely like\npeek back in\nyou know like sometimes my friends would\nshow me things and like it's not like i\nlike didn't care about the smash\ncommunity anymore but\ni saw that like you know\nand for those who don't know me i have\nmy own like uh story\nand kind of background that makes me\nvery familiar\nwith like you know like situations of\nlike harassment or like feeling like you\ncan't\ncome out with your story right so i\nalways felt like\neven though i did make my statement i\ndidn't make a full statement i didn't\nlike go into detail\ni didn't divulge publicly you know\nwhat exactly i went through and\nhow long ago was that that was a long\ntime ago right it was a long long time\nago i was\nlike i said um most of it happened when\ni was like\n15 to 17 and then i came out with it\nwhen i was like 18 19\num and then i just kind of held on to it\nfor years and\nit wasn't until i saw that\npeople like other people in the\ncommunity you know they were finally\nstarting to come forward with their\nstories and i think it's just because of\nlike\nthe whole you know the world right now\nit's like we're in a really tense place\nlike this whole pandemic\nlike we're all kind of like in a\nstandstill staying at home\nbeing able to like actually have the\ntime to self-reflect and it's not just\nthe smash community that this was\nafflicted with it was uh\nlike i mean obviously there's a bit\nthere's been a ton of big streamers like\nin league\ndota uh i think like the quake scene i\ndon't i don't know but\nbasically there's this whole movement\nnow for people to finally get like the\nretribution acknowledgement and justice\nand um that obviously spilled over into\nsmash\nand i saw that there are a bunch of\npeople finally\nstarting to speak out and it almost felt\nlike cathartic for me\nlike i always felt like i always knew\nlike especially as a woman\num and and a woman and a minor and just\nlike\nlike just a minority within the\ncommunity it doesn't you don't have to\nbe like a woman or a minor just\nif you're some kind of non-majority\ngroup there are like things that you\nface\nthat are hard to bring up just like in\nany other community because you're not\nthe front-facing personality\nyou're not you're not the the main\nexperience that everyone else has so\nit's hard to get people to empathize\nwith that so i think people stayed quiet\nbut finally you know people are getting\nthe strength to come out with their\nstories\nand that's kind of what prompted me to\ncome back and be like\nyou know i've been like waiting for this\nmoment for so long\nand i think like the way i came about it\non social media because this is how i've\nalways been but like i'm\ni come off kind of i don't know if this\nis the right word but i come off very\nlike confident or snarky and like people\nkind of took that\nthe wrong way they almost painted me\nlike a villain figure because they're\nlike\nthey're like what do you why like why\nare you painting why are you saying this\nin such a like\nlike vindictive way and it's just like i\ni feel like if you've\nlived with something like this for years\nyou know it's like\nit's like i said it's cathartic it's\nrelieving um\nbut yeah that's kind of what tumbled\nit's kind of what like started\neverything into this big like tumble\nand like i don't want to list any names\nbecause that's that's\nwe're just going to open up a big can of\nworms but like there are a ton of big\ncommentators\nplayers um and just like known community\nmembers who\nwere either like abused or you know the\nthe accused\nand later you know admitted to it and\ni i have to say because i am\ni knew in my position as one of the\nmore well-known like minorities within\nthe scene\ni felt like almost like a duty\nespecially because i know these\nstruggles i almost felt like a duty to\ndo whatever i can to push the movement\nas much as possible and like i said i\ntry to do with as much\ndue diligence as possible like i it's\nnot like i played\nevery single situation correctly which\nby the way i don't think you should ever\nexpect\nanybody who has that much burden or like\njust information to be able to play\nlike play like play-by-play handle such\na sensitive topic\nin a perfect way that if anything that'd\nbe that would be more suspicious to me\nbut anyways like\num you know especially with the whole\nlike cancel culture\nrhetoric you know i had this whole i had\nthis these waves of people coming abby\nbe like but you're doing this for clout\nor this or that it's just like no\nlike why would i take a year off\ncan i just jump in for a second so so\njisoo i get the impression that you're\ntalking\naround a lot of stuff so like people\nwill say like\nthe movement and then things started to\nhappen\nand you're kind of like you're kind of\ndipping just right along the surface so\nlike let's take a step because i\nactually don't\nknow i haven't followed much right so\nlet's just start like what\nstarted happening sexual assault\nallegations\nof major smash figureheads players\ncommentators\nthey ranged from um outright rape to\ndrug facilitated violence\nto soliciting nudes from minors to\nactually sexually assaulting minors\nthere are 90 cases right now\nthe i think the most shocking ones were\nthe sexually related\nuh accusations um and there there have\nbeen several careers that have been\nended just straight up ended\nbecause of the things that were revealed\non social media\nand do you guys have a sense of like\nwhat\nso jisoo had sort of mentioned that\nsometimes it's hard to speak\nwhich i i think is common when it comes\nto issues of like\nsexual assault or other kinds of\npredatory behavior\ndoes anyone have a sense of what caused\npeople to\nstart the movement or like what what\nhappened well like\nhow did these elevators i think it only\ntook i think it only took one person\nso like obviously there's a lot that is\nbehind the scenes that people weren't\nwilling to say because they weren't\nuh they weren't sure of the consequences\nand to be honest i mean like\nsome of those consequences were exactly\nwhat you thought they were like where\nyou would\nsomeone will come up with a story and\ninstead of people being like\noh man we believe you you know they want\nto be like oh we need proof\noh you're just trying to do this to ruin\nthis person's career when like\nyou know that's that's not the point you\nknow i mean it's it's just like\nthe point was basically to let you know\nthat you know your heroes basically\naren't\nthe people that you think they are you\nknow like it wasn't every person\nevery top player isn't like a good\nperson and every top commentator is a\ngood person\nand it didn't even have to be just top\nplayers top commentators some of those\npeople were like\nyou know o2 people people just go to\nyour local it just\nthough i think the point they were\ntrying to show was that like you know uh\nenough is enough and i don't know who\nexactly did the first\nfirst one but i know that it was\nbasically a chain reaction like one\nperson\nput out a big story and then after that\nit was like\njust dominoes i remember being up one of\nthose nights i can't remember which\nnight it was but i remember being at one\nof those nights until like 7 a.m because\nlike a new story came out like every\n30 minutes and uh i was sitting in this\ncall with tony big shout outs to tony\nand we just like every time i'll be like\nall right man i think i'm gonna go sleep\npeople like wait wait wait did you see\nthis and then we would have to like read\nanother one\nand um i i can't remember which night\nthat was but i know that\nthat same night i think that was\nprobably the same night that nairo got\nouted\nthat like seven war stories came out uh\nat the same time\nand um yeah just to me i don't really\nknow what like sparked the first person\nto do such but i do know that like it\nwas more\na lot it was probably like a lead by\nexample type deal with\neverybody else who decided to come out\nuh with their stories after\ni think the nairo thing was the first\nthing i saw like the first notable\ni don't like using the word notable but\nlike known player\non like a big pedestal that was also\ninvolved with\nanother really known player which i\nthink is another reason why people felt\nso encouraged and like\nreally that they could actually talk\nabout this stuff because it's not just\nlike it's not just randoms anymore\ncan you guys tell tell me who naira is\nand what happened with naira\nnairo is well nairo's pretty much the\nface of like the other side of the smash\ncommunity like he\nhe was any of the like the brawl the\nuh smash four and the ultimate like he\nwas pretty much at the forefront of that\nfor like a long time uh he was also\ni think he probably was the biggest\nstreamer uh for smash on twitch\num yeah if it was it was pretty him and\nmango well\nmango's probably bigger than him but as\nfar as like not melee he was\npretty much the biggest and uh he\num he had a\nsexual relationship with a minor um\nlike i guess three years two years ago\nor whatever and covered it up by paying\nsaid person with hush money\nand uh and i guess they both covered up\nthe story for a long time because that\nthat rumor had been around for a while\nand then um on this said night\nuh captain zack the uh other member\ndecided to\ntell the truth and the truth was that\nthat like you know they did have like a\nrelation\nuh ship of some sort um before it was\nlegal like captain zach's 18 now but you\nknow at the time i think he was 15 or 16\nwhen it when it happened\nso nairo and captain zach are both males\nyeah yes okay and and so\ni i guess so s captain zach sort of\nsaid that this did happen and then yeah\nsort of what\nwhat happened after that uh nairo\ndeleted his account\num and then came back to say i guess\nlike he apologized\nfor letting everybody down and then he\ndeleted his account again\nand his like i'm sure that i'm sure that\nhe lost the sponsor\nbecause i mean he was sponsored by\nenergy that's gone\num i think his twitch account just got\nbanned\nand uh yeah he's kind of he's been gone\never since like we have\never since that day like we have not\nheard anything from him uh i don't think\nhe has twitter accounts up or anything\nlike that\nokay and so there was a case involving a\nwell-known ultimate player named ally um\nin which the code of conduct gave him a\nlifetime ban for having a\nunderage relationship with zach as well\nso there's a lot\na lot of layers and\nuh complexities to that case as well to\nnara's case as well\num and i'd say that the other big name i\ngot\nbobby were you gonna say something i was\njust gonna ask would you all agree that\nlike\nwhen you get into the deed like some of\nthe details are kind of messed up in\nother words like that that's the way\nthat it went down but kind of like the\nway in which the hush money and the\num you know my my impression was that\ncaptain zach had a hell of a time\num you know was not it wasn't just uh\nlike there's details that make it worse\nyeah don't agree with that like most of\nthese stories it's like\nthere's a story and then you kind of\nit's like okay that sounds not good uh\nbut you don't know until you hear the\ndetails and then the details usually\nmake it worse\nlike considerably worse it's like it's\nhard to talk about people are not really\ntreating one another with respect and\npeople are forcing\ngenerally what i've heard is that people\nwith power and with the ped you know\npeople who have\ncalled clout which we should probably\ntalk about they've generally like\nabused their power um and people who do\nnot have power have really suffered\nand we heard a lot about it and the\nstories that came out were\nover i would have to say like a 10 year\nspan i mean i feel like we heard about\nstuff that happened in 2011 2012\nso the floodgates really opened up um\nwould you all agree that those are the\ngo ahead i was just going to say so so\nhugs kind of commented that it's\nit's hard to share the details why is\nthat\num well that month when all of that went\ndown i think that was\nprobably the roughest of the whole\npandemic and one of the roughest months\nthat i've ever gone through because\na lot of these people at one point were\nmy friends\nand um when you would read the details\nyou had to um acknowledge that\nthey weren't the people that you thought\nthey were they weren't uh good as you\nthought they were\nand um it was really a battle throughout\nthat time\nto cope with that and so to uh\ndiscuss details is to re-acknowledge\nwhat had happened\nand um that not that\nnot that you shouldn't right but it's\njust it's just a difficult thing to\nto to get into detail about and some of\nit is just uh straight up uh\nunpleasant to hear about period like\nwhether it was a friend or not\nso um yeah it's it was all\n[ __ ] up yeah yeah\nyeah for lack of a better term that's\nthat's really what it is i mean it's\nit's the language that you're just not\nused to using i don't think i've said\nsexual assault or rape in like this much\nany long time um or like just\nyou know like things of that nature and\nthen on top of that it's the people\nthat it is uh seeing that like you know\nwhen it comes to\nlike the commentators that i had got\num outed a lot of these people like you\nknow i sat next to you like i worked\nwith\ni considered them friends you know and\nuh\nand it's like you don't expect to\noh just to to feel those people kind of\nfade away\njust just to sit next to someone for to\nhave these people as friends and and\nkind of read about\nyou know what i'm almost hearing is like\nthere's some amount of like protection\nyou can offer yourself\nas long as you hear things in in broad\nstrokes\nbut once the details start to come out\nwhat i'm hearing from hugs is that\nthere's like\nthere's actually like a challenging\ninternal\nemotional experience yeah i mean\nit's like for\ninstance like me and senpai are like\nreally close you know i'm saying like we\nuh prefer\nfor uh contact senpai was one of the\nfirst people that outed\num she was a female commentator she had\na sexual relationship with a minor um\nthat rumor has been going on for years\nuh\nsometime i think it was like around 2015\n2016\num and that remember going on for years\nand then this person\nuh finally came out and said that that\nrumor is true and it had like\nexplicit detail all that good stuff so\nuh she has since\nnot said anything she has not uh she\ndidn't make like a tweet like a\napologize and no nothing she just\nliterally ghosted she hasn't streamed\nshe hasn't tweeted none of that um she\nand her really quote huh that one was a\n10-year age gap right\nyeah 14-24 yeah yes yes yes yes\nso um she has you know like we were\nreally close because like i\noriginally she approached me about how\nto get into like commentary and i was\nlike oh word like\nit would be nice to see some more you\nknow uh women faces on commentary like\nlet's\nwork on your craft or whatever so like i\nwould do a lot of locals with her\nwhatever whatever and thus we end up\ngetting close\num and then to for that to come out\nlike it was a shock to the point where i\nlike i had texted her like before and it\ngot big and i was like bro is this like\nis this like really fast and she never\ntexts me back so i just\nyou know it's like a a knee-jerk\nreaction you're like i want to\nbelieve that you're not this person but\nlike i have no reason\nto do that outside of like i don't know\nblind stupidity like all the facts are\nhere\nand i'm getting so now i'm getting like\nthis new mental image of you\nand it's hard to like balance it with\nthe current mental image i have of you\nand yeah that's like oh sorry no go\nahead\noh no i was gonna say that was the\nhardest part with that is that you have\nthis image that you've crafted of this\nperson through all the years that you've\nknown\nthese different people and then now you\nhave to\nuh you know match that with what you're\nseeing\nnow and this awful person that you're\nreading about and then um\nit's a challenge to to to know a person\none way and then discover them another\nand then having\nthat's that's what that whole month\nthat's what made that entire month so\ndifficult\nit's just that that idea of changing a\nperson that you knew\num for all those years and turning them\ninto what they\nwere actually doing um\ni've never had to do that in my life so\nit was what was that like difficult time\nbugs terrible um\nbecause um it kind of it shakes you\nbecause\nuh there are i i wouldn't say it makes\nyou mistrust people it's more that um\num you had these people that you made\nyourself vulnerable with\nuh to to allow them into your life to be\nyour friend\netc and to find out that they could be\nthis way towards other people\nit just um\ni i don't know it i'm sorry i can't\ndescribe it very well but it was just\n[ __ ] terrible\nsorry you feel me right i feel like the\ncommunity is like what i've seen is that\npeople feel betrayed\nby a lot of people betrayed um\nalso uh also you wonder if like if you\ncould have done something about it if um\nyou know if if you had any hand in\nin letting them get away with this even\nthough that's kind of silly\nright like no one could have done a lot\nabout\na lot of these things that happened but\num yeah you just kind of go through\nthose\nuh motions when you're hearing that kind\nof news\nso i'm hearing betrayal i'm hearing\nbizarrely and let's remember that\nsometimes\nfeelings aren't logical but\ni'm i'm almost almost wondering whether\nhugs sort of feels some amount of\nirrational responsibility\nyeah for sure but i mean that also comes\nwith the territory of these people being\na part of\nour community so you you feel like this\nis something that was happening under\nyour own roof\nand in that sense i think a lot of us\nhere have been\num have felt responsible for the\ncommunity in some kind of way like we've\ncontributed it\nuh to it a lot throughout the years\nevery single person here\nand so when this thing happens under\nyour own roof\nyou do take uh some kind of\nuh sense of responsibility or at least\nthinking what you could have done to\nprevented it uh to prevent it and um\nyeah and then yeah even uh then there\nare also even thoughts of\nself-reflection like how how\nyou might have been uh problematic at\nsome point\nfor different people not to the same\ndegree but you know\nit was just a whole lot of reflection\nfor all these different kinds of things\ninteresting yeah i think i think the\nself-reflection was a really big one to\nyou because\nlike you know you you um\n[Music]\nlike it's almost like the\nself-reflection plus also seeing like\ncertain patterns that you may have not\nrecognized uh before\nyou know like you you have you're you're\nlike one wild friend or whatever and\nlike you would write it off oh it's just\nwild you know whatever whatever but then\nlike\nafter everything started coming out you\nreally start to look at some of your\ninteractions with\nlike your friends and like man that\nactually wasn't okay and i should have\nsaid something\nand so now with this current new\nknowledge\nthat's like if we ever get back to\ntournaments you know going\nbarred uh or sent away that like we have\nthis new knowledge of you know what we\ncan do to help\num in the heat of the moment instead of\nlike waiting for\nmoments like this where everything has\nto come tumbling down we could just\nsay something in that moment uh\nthat like we'll get the point across hey\nbro like she said no a bro like\nyou know you're being a little too like\naggressive something like that you know\njust\nsimple stuff that could literally uh\nchange the whole narrative that night of\nthat outcome\njust by making someone aware that maybe\nthe way that they are\nacting or or the way that they are um\nlike you know appearing or whatever is\nnot uh\nit's not okay what i'm hearing from tk\nis that they're\nin hindsight there may have been a\ncouple of red flags\nyou know yeah and and so like what are\nsome of those red flags\ni see soon nodding emphatically\nlike i'll just tell you straight up as\nlike\ni think it's not to blame guys but\ni think it's hard when like you're not\nlike their main target\nright like if you're let's say you're a\ngirl you walk in the venue\nand like i think for some people it's\nreally hard to speak or hard to see\nespecially if you're new to the scene\nbut like\nyou know guy walks up to you is like hey\ndo you want to play some games or like\ndo you want to get food or like what's\nyour name and they just have this really\nvested interest in you for whatever\nreason total stranger\nand like you know when i came to my\nfirst tournament i\ni was just young and naive like i just\nthought these guys were really nice\nbut i quickly learned very quickly\ni was like you know i i immediately\nlearned i'm like\nokay this this is kind of weird because\nthey're very insistent and then\nthat's when it hit me i'm like oh\nthey're just i don't know what kind of\nlanguage you guys use but they're\njust thirsty as [ __ ] so like that's\nthat's that's like how did you learn\nthat jesus\ni mean they'll just like they'll they're\nthere's like the normal boundaries of\nlike wanting to get to know someone like\nso\nlike like you know i i consider myself a\npretty interesting person\nso i wouldn't i would give the best of\nthe doubt if some random person\nregardless of their identity wants to\nget to know me it's like hey we can just\nhave a conversation but like\nthat's that's organic that's natural you\nknow\num if it starts veering into territory\nwhere\nthey pursue you and i use the word\npursue very\nlike carefully because like like you\nknow things can develop naturally like\ni'm friends with a lot of these people\nin the scene and like things are totally\nplatonic and fine\nbut there are people who you can tell\nlike they'll they'll be flirty\num they'll try to like get you into\ntheir room they'll\nthey'll use really like slimy methods to\nlike\ninitiate some kind of like physical or\nlike sexual relation with you or maybe\nmaybe they'll start off emotionally you\nknow like they'll like try to like\nlike psychologically or emotionally like\nbring you into like being\ndependent or like them being dependent\non you and\num like okay like\nlike a really good example of this for\ninstance right uh\nlike the whole the whole d1 thing which\nby the way\nthat was horrible like he he's like he's\nsuch a big figure in the scene\num and i've like he just to give you\nguys\nsome context like he would i literally\ngrew up with him and like he would call\nme like his little sister\nand it's just like it's it's messed up\nbut anyways\num when i thought d1 who was d1 and what\nhappened\nhe's just um so he's like a super\nveteran in the scene and like like\nhugs hugs would know him all i mean all\nof us know him really well\nand he was just like a front-facing\ncommunity member like nintendo loved him\nhe was always at every big like public\nevent and he's like this big commentator\npersonality\nand like you can't go through like any\nmajor smash video without d1 in it like\nit's just\nthat's just like fact um and\num basically like you know there's\nthere's a story of him that came out\nduring july\nwhere um he basically like and\nthis this story told a lot like he he\nlured a girl\na new girl into his hotel room under the\nguise\nof like hey how as a woman\nyou know what's your experience in the\ncommunity but what it actually turned\nout to be\nwas him using that as a vehicle to try\nand take advantage of her um and like\nyou can you can like search these\nstories up like they're not\nthey're like all publicly out there but\nthe point being is that like you know\nhe knew that he knew using that topic as\nthe opener\nlike that that was him trying to\nemotionally like connect with her\nand make him seem like he's her friend\nbut his end goal was you know just take\nadvantage of her and\nthere's there's repeated this happens\nlike repeatedly from people like that\nlike from predators\nand you'll that's a pattern that you'll\nsee once like if you go over all these\nstories like you know\nyou can't just be friendly with a girl\nbut if you're doing it multiple times\nand\ndoing manipulative things like that you\nknow that's definitely a red flag\nso can i also say oh go ahead go for it\npeggy you haven't\nhad a chance to jump in a little while\nso\ni just wanted to return to this idea of\nemotional reactions to what has occurred\nbecause my reaction has been very\ndifferent than what um like\nhugo and tk are describing so when all\nthese allegations started coming out\num all these accusations and people\nfeeling shocked and betrayed\ni really just felt searing white rage\nbecause like risu i've experienced so\nmuch uh\npredatory behavior um sexual advances uh\nand harassment by the community\ndisbelief by the community you know your\naverage guy you tell them like oh that\nguy's creeping me out and they're like\nno he's a good guy\nso none of this surprised me i mean the\nfact that like zero made it as far as he\ndid without getting called out\nor nairo or d1 like that that's a little\nsurprising that shows\nan enormous systemic problem right but\nbut the fact that people do bad things\nto each other\nand people leverage a minority status\nfor example or\nor power imbalances whether it's because\nof fame and not fame\nall of those things are a given for me\nabout human behavior and especially\nbehavior within esports because we have\nno safety protocols\num that would otherwise discourage those\nkinds of things from happening\nso when we talk about the emotions of\nall these things are coming out\nmy first was like why didn't you listen\nto any of us before\nyou know when these things would come\nout every six weeks everyone would find\nan excuse to like oh well she\nactually did this but it took an entire\noutpouring of 90 stories for you\nto like look at your fellow friends and\nbe like maybe i need to hold this guy\naccountable\ni'm not saying anybody here like has\ndone anything wrong um\nwith all of you and you know i wouldn't\nwant to be talking with you if i didn't\nfeel comfortable\nyeah but like like it was messed up that\nlike\nwith all the credibility that i have\nbecause i've never most people don't\neven know what i look like\nlike online until pretty recently and\nlike i've had people think that i was a\nguy for years\nbut like i thought it was messed up when\nlike i was saying everything i was\nsaying\nand immediately because i'm trying to\ncancel one of their favorites they're\nlike oh there's like absolute zero\ncredence and it took it didn't take\nme fighting for myself it took me going\nto my friends who are guys who had\nbigger platforms\nto back me up and it took multiple of\nthem for them to believe me it's like\nwhat\nlike i'm never alive why would i lie\nabout this right now\npeggy what happened when so it sounds\nlike you had tried\nto speak up or things had happened to\nyou in the past and\ni'm sort of getting when you sort of say\nwhite hot rage\ni'm i'm sort of hearing that maybe\nyou've been\nlike this was expected and this has been\ngoing on and you knew it was a problem\nfor a long time\nand that people didn't listen so\ncan can you share with us like what you\ntried to say in the past\nor what your experiences of harassment\nwere\num so i wrote an article i'll send you\nthe link because it goes into the\nhistory a little bit more\nthan i can in the space of time we have\ntoday but some things\nwithin six months of entering smash the\nonly other girl that i hung out with at\nthe event at my locals was sexually\nassaulted she told rto\nhe's like you don't have any proof so\nuh nothing was done um so she started\ngoing to smash fests which are smaller\nparties that happened at people's houses\nrather than organized venues with\ntournament organizers\nand she was sexually assaulted there by\nanother guy\nwho said he was comforting her about her\nfirst sexuals\nand you know i'm like 21 and i'm like\nwow that's messed up\nwhat can we do so i talked to her we\ntalked about police reports but guess\nwhat police\nare not designed to handle sexual\nviolence because the kinds of proof\nthat emerge out of sexual violence cases\nare not um\nhave never been prioritized by the law\nso for example\nuh the people people like to talk about\nemotions versus logic hard versus soft\nproof\nbut in the end there are um for our\ncomplex phenomenon there are going to be\nmultiple different sources of\ninformation that are going to say okay\nthis is what most likely happened right\nbut because uh police and the law are\ntrying to actually limit someone's\nphysical freedoms\nthere's a higher standard of proof right\nbut we're in smash community here and\nuh there so if somebody says a guy raped\nme\nwhy isn't that enough um and of course\nyou have to\nyou have to get uh as much confirmation\nas you can\nright but like we're not locking\nsomebody away\nbut if when an accusation like that\ncomes out we're just saying i don't want\nto play this guy in bracket anymore\num so from the very first beginning of\nsmash\nthen to me trying to educate about\ngender differences for example in\na reaction time and stuff like that and\npeople are like oh testosterone\nand trying to make giant diff\nsorry trying to uh make the differences\nbetween like men and women\nuh justify their treatment their\ndifferent treatment of women right like\nthat's\ni've seen that harassment myself my work\nuh i've been tried to be fired\nuh since july because people said i knew\nabout the narrative situation\nand i didn't but what can you do you\ncan't you can't prove that\nbut someone on the internet can look up\nyour work address and decide to email\nyour whole department saying what a what\na pedo protector you are\num and i submitted one story\nuh in the july events i um described an\ninteraction\nwith um somebody that made me\nuncomfortable because it matched up with\nthe stories or several other people\nbut other than that i have not uh\naccused anyone of anything\num because i've walked through the smash\ncommunity my entire life in fear\ni've never left a drink alone i've never\ngone to a guy's hotel room without\nsomebody else knowing where i was\ni've always roomed with other women uh\ni've done\nso much i've been so hyper vigilant to\nprotect myself because i knew\nwhat people are capable of from the very\nfirst get-go\nso i i just i feel raged because\ni've seen dozens of these stories come\nout\nover the years and i just want to say so\np you and you've been working\nreally hard like on the front lines of\nthe code of conduct initiative so\npiggy's been like\nputting uh you put a lot of your own\ntime and energy in over a course of\nyears to try to make a difference in the\ncommunity and\nthat is a thankless job and there's very\ni mean if you try to make cultural\nchange it's a really slow uh\nand yeah it's like so it's a hard fight\nto fight so\nuh just wanted to make that known you\nknow the rage is super justified because\ni mean i've seen\npiggy struggle for a long time to make a\npositive impact and like\nhelp people feel safe at tournaments and\nyeah to feel\nthat a lot of people don't give a [ __ ]\nor you know are critical of the work\nthat\num that they've done like i don't know\nthat's kind of\ni understand the rage like that seems\nlike completely\nyeah that's what i would expect yeah and\ni would say that what i've been saying\nto you just now what i've been speaking\nabout is\nonly my personal experience i haven't\neven scratched the surface of like code\nof conduct systemic\nanswers to what exactly yeah i'm trying\nto say there's layers to your rage yeah\nyou're only talking about one slice of\nit\nso you want to sorry you were you wanted\nto say something is it risu or jisoo\nso i i get that there's there's another\ngirl her name is friso in the community\nand that happens all the time okay\num so you wanted to say something juicy\nyeah so\ni mean i think one of the main concerns\nbecause like i think\nlike like i i totally empathize like\nwith dr piggy's like with your\nperspective but i think just like\nlike since we're on such a large\nplatform right now like you know saying\nthings like\noh like if there's no proof we need to\nbelieve women like obviously\nthis is this is actually something that\ni addressed um because i had this other\nbig talk with a bunch of other community\nmembers like right after this all\nhappened like in july\num because i think it's hard for people\nto understand\nwhere a victim is coming from\num and like you know like logically\nspeaking\nyeah it sounds absurd to like not demand\nproof\num but like you know let's let's just\ntake like anecdotal\nevidence for instance right let's say\nyou're a girl you go to a tournament and\nthen some guy walks up and like\njust like touches you you like very\ninappropriately like he touches your\nboob or something it's like and you're\nnot you're not gonna have like a\ncamera on you at all times like that's\njust like that's insane\num and like you know there's a then you\nget into all the the\nwhat's the word the slippery slope\narguments like oh she was acting a\ncertain way oh she was dressed like this\nso she was\nyou know she was asking for and it's\njust like no no no one ever\nis you know nine times out of ten\nthey're really not um\nand i you know there are stories\nthat of people making stuff up obviously\num like we're not going to pretend like\nthere aren't self-interested\nlike by the way i think those people are\neven like not not to put on like a moral\nscale but like if you make [ __ ] up to\ncancel someone like actually\njust for like your 10 seconds of fame\nyou're a piece of [ __ ] so anyways\nlike if you you know there are people\nwho do that and that's totally\nacknowledged\nbut this problem the problem is still\nlike the systemic issues with the world\nat large because\nin my case i had years of proof i had\nyears of chat logs i had photos i had\nmessages i had me i had tons of\nanecdotal evidence a lot of people\nvolunteer coming up to me being being\nlike hey if you need a witness\ni'm i'm here for you and like even when\ni presented this to a lawyer\nand like you know i'm not i'm not i'm\nnot going to tiptoe bar on this anymore\nlike i was just straight up like\nstatutory raped like i was groomed for\nyears\num like they just\nthey just didn't care and even with all\nthis proof\nand keep in mind i'm already putting in\nthe time to go to this lawyer go to\nmultiple of them and it costs money to\ndo that\nyou know they cost like 50 an hour so\nthey they a lot of them the one that i\nstuck with\num he he actually said he would prefer\nto go about in a business direction\nbecause\nif you go about it the other way it gets\nreally messy and\ni'm like i don't know how it could be\nany i don't know how it could be any\nmore clean cut than what i have because\nthere's literally proof\nyou know from free years worth of proof\nbut they wanted to go about that way\nand even when i had you know when i was\nbeing threatened like oh i'm gonna\nleak these nudes and like they like sent\nit to me which by the way were taken\nwithout my\npermission like and so that that you\nknow those the first times i've seen i\nwas in shock\ni uh i called the police i was freaking\nout obviously\nand like i showed them everything and\nthey said they can't do anything\nit's like what the what do you mean you\ncan't do anything and like i think\nthere's cases even now where like\nstalkers or girls\ngirl streamers or people online they\nhave stalkers and like there's literally\nmounds of proof like everyone can tell\nthat this guy's a problem but like the\npolice won't do anything and it's\nbecause\npolice the law is designed to be\nreactive\nnot preventative and in cases of like\nsexual assault it's like that's\nthat's not that's not logical um and so\ni think like you know if\nlike i said if one one instance of a guy\nbeing friendly to a girl whatever\nokay multiple instances you know i'll\nuse a good example\nanti like he has a track record of like\nliterally all the women in the community\nhating him it's like okay maybe we\nshould actually like look into that\nlike maybe one or two of those women are\njust making [ __ ] up but like i don't\nthink\ni don't think all 200 of them would you\nknow and i'm sure i'm sure the number is\ngreater to be honest\nyeah wow\nthat's that's crazy um and and i\nappreciate you not tiptoeing around it\nbecause i think\nyou know you mentioned earlier that\nspeaking out is hard\nand it is really hard and so i i and you\nknow people are sort of talking about\nhow it's hard to face the details and\ni'm just trying to\nfigure out you know sure we have\nemotional reactions\nthat want us to stay silent\nbut my sense is that you know when we\nlet our emotions sort of dictate our\nbehavior without\ntrue awareness of like what's going on\nthat's really when we get into trouble\nit doesn't i mean i'm sure we're talking\nabout sexual and assault assault and\nstuff right now but i think that's true\nof\nall kinds of things that and so i'm i'm\nkind of curious\ncan you explain to me what the word and\nif if you don't want to talk about this\nthat's totally fine\num but can you explain\nyeah so let me just take a step back so\ni think part of the problem with not\ntalking about details is\nyou guys use this term like\npsychologically manipulative\nright so you're like oh some people in\nthe scene are psychologically\nmanipulative\ni'm imagining that there's a 16 year old\nkid out there\nwho like is walking down the street and\nthen it's like oh that's psychological\nmanipulation like no one knows what this\nlooks like no one knows what it feels\nlike\nright like if we listen to jesus it's\nsort of like oh like i think about\nmyself as an\ninherently interesting person and so\nwhen people come up to me\ni think part of the problem with\nglossing over details is that\nno one has known what this looks like\nand the more explicit we make things\nlike tk saying hey they're like actually\nred flags\nwhich no one knew were red flags and why\nis that i think it's\nprobably because some things are not\nexplicit\nand so can you tell us if you feel\ncomfortable\nwhat grooming looks like\nyeah i mean like i said my story is like\nall out on the table\num it's not it is always hard to talk\nabout it so\nlike again like if anybody if you're\never facing the situation where\nsomebody's like you can see it happening\nlike i would\ntry to be as understanding towards them\nas possible and that all being said like\nyou know in my case in a lot of these\ncases frankly it's\npretty obvious um and it starts with\nit starts with the power imbalances for\nsure\nuh like if you're to just isolate even\njust like the ages\nof a lot of things like with my dude\nhe's like 10 years older than me\num and like you know and puppet's case\ndoes the same thing\nand like in all in almost all these\ncases it starts off with like an age\ndifference and\nwith an age difference there comes like\na like a mentality difference too\nobviously like you know one person's an\nadult or should be\nand the other person is literally a\nchild and\nyou know in no case should you ever\nexpect\nthe child or the younger one to make the\nright decisions\nyou know they're they're they're\nimpressionable they're young that's\nthat's literally by definition what a\nchild\nis and you know people\nwith predatory mindsets they seek out\npeople who are easily manipulated\nand that that tends to be children um\nand like you know if you\nstart off with like just a really\nobvious fact like that and then you get\na bunch of other factors going into like\nlet's say\nlet's say two people are the same age in\nthe smash community okay but then one\nperson has\nlike a hundred thousand followers and\nthen the other one\nis like literally a newbie but the other\none's a girl\nand like you know the person with 100\n000 followers they\nthey're like oh i want to like i want to\nhave sex with her\nand it's just like like they'll they'll\ndo everything they\ncan to this is how you can tell\nsomeone's\nmanipulative they'll do everything they\ncan to write up to that certain line\nwhere everything's okay but as soon as\nthey realize they can't get what they\nwant\nthey just they skirt okay now some\npeople\nand these are usually the people who do\nget caught right they'll if they're not\nsmart about it they'll skirt that line\nthey'll trip and then they'll do\nsomething bad\nand then they'll get caught and they'll\nface the punishments logically right you\nknow that you would think that happened\nunfortunately\na lot of times it actually doesn't\nhappen but the smart manipulators\nthey'll always ride that line\nand again that's another reason why that\nit's been so\nhard for people to call these things out\neven like me from my position where i\nhave like literally heard so many rumors\ni think all of us have\nit's because we they've like they these\nbig people\nare smart enough to skirt that line\nwhere anything that they're doing\nthey choose victims who they know are\nnever going to speak out or don't have\nimpact or like we won't believe them\nright\nand they'll always choose to do their\nactions outside of the public eye\nor in a way where it's very ambiguous\nand\nthey could just feign ignorance and get\naway with it\nand i'll say in like the particular case\nof like grooming\nlike you know like if you're if you're a\nchild\nand like someone's taking advantage of\nyou um\nit's really hard for the child to know\nthat especially\nlike in my case i was a runaway like i\nliterally was like\ni had i almost had like no choice but to\ninteract with the people that i was with\num and it was hard for me to separate\nsomebody just caring for me versus like\nthem trying to take advantage of me\nbecause i didn't i couldn't really tell\nthe difference like in a lot of ways\nlike oh they are doing this nice thing\nfor me but then\nyou know is it really nice if they're\ntrying they're doing it to get something\nin return\num and i mean the obvious answer to that\nis no i i hope\ni hope you all know that so\nyeah i'm sorry i i just wanted to i\nwanted to ask you to be\nand let me know if this is not okay but\ni wanted you to i wanted to ask you to\nbe more specific because once again\nyou're talking about\nyou know you can't tell the difference\nbetween caring yeah go ahead\nokay screamed when i was 14 by an 18\nyear old guy and the way it started out\nwas a friend\nintroduced us and she was like hey you\nboth like video games so we\nchat on aim about video games and at\nsome point he's like do you have a crush\non anybody\nand so we would talk about crushes and a\ngirl he liked at school and then he\nshowed me a picture of the girl he liked\nat school\nand he's like uh do you think she's\npretty and i'm like yeah she's really\npretty\nuh she's also got really big boobs and\nhe's like oh i wondered if he would say\nsomething about that\nso then suddenly it was okay for us to\ntalk about boob and then\neventually it got to the point where it\nwas okay for us to talk about do we have\ndo we masturbate\ndo we have sex do we uh and then it got\nto the point where he's like well what\ndoes your body look like\nyou know are you comfortable in yourself\nand sometimes he would do it in very\nslimy ways so he would say\noh god i just hate the way my chest\nlooks like can you tell me if this is\nnormal and he'd send me a picture of his\nchest\nand it'd be like oh yeah you're fine\nlike\nand so now i'm used to seeing a guy's\nchest when i'm 14 years old\nin my am inbox right like these things\nhappen\nthe whole grooming itself is slow\neroding of boundaries\nso if you just walked up to a kid and\nyou like lift your shirt up and said\ndoes my chest look normal\nthey're gonna like have a fear response\nright but grooming specifically\nis the act of of taking that fear away\ntrying to make somebody safe\nand until their boundaries are gone and\nthen you can then you can have sex with\nthem if you want right because they\ndon't they think oh i'm special\nwe have a special relationship we've\ntalked about this for a long time\nthis person doesn't want to hurt me and\nthen they just fall for it\num and that that's not the fault of any\nchild that's the fault of the adult that\nthat does those manipulative things so\nif you're a kid 14 15 16 whatever and\nsomebody way more famous than you\nstarts taking an interest or just\nremember your boundaries\nyou have to remember um what does this\nperson stand to gain from b\num and of course you never want to think\nthat about somebody you're talking to\nyou want to think that they're good and\nthey like you right um\nbut we also should be aware that not\neverybody's good\nthanks a lot for sharing that um but\nyeah i think that's sort of exactly what\ni was kind of looking for because i\nthink that clearly\ndemonstrates i like the way that you\nsort of talk about\neroding the boundaries um\nand sort of in a gradual way we sort of\nheard that from g suit ii about\nyou know sort of like a gradual process\num\nalso like i mean i'm i'm hearing this\ntheme of power come up a lot like jesus\nwas saying that\nyou were saying that like you know you\nsort of literally didn't have anyone\nelse\nand so yeah\ni mean i i'm forgive me for like\nstepping around so much because\nin my case like the story is literally\nit's literally years long\nso like you know in the like like dr dr\npiggy described um it's like they get\nyou to trust them\nand for me that took years because like\nthis person\nthey they only ever wanted they only\nthey only they painted it like they only\never wanted to be friends but they were\nso\nfriendly to the point where it was like\nyou know clearly something else is going\non and it's weird like we would talk\nlike every day\nand it would just be about like\ninteresting normal stuff like at the\ntime like i was really into smash and\nlike i'd be like\nhey can you help me with the game and\nlike that's kind of how it started off\nand we would talk about like game\nmechanics we were both really into art\ni would like talk about art with them so\nit's like we're just\nfriends um but like slowly over the\nyears\nuh you know things would get weird we're\nlike you know they're like oh i have\nfeelings for you and i'm like\nokay well i i don't know what to do\nabout that and at this point like i'm\nalready like\ni i was already i already ran away um so\ni was like stuck living with them in\nlike the sky house\num and that was basically\num so you ran away and you were living\nwith this person\nyeah so like i started talking to them\nwhen i was 15\nand like at the time like i just i was\nlike\nsuper miserable at home um and i just\nlike needed a way out basically\nand they offered me a way out they're\nlike hey do you want to move in with me\nand my friends at this like big house\nand like just like pursue your dreams\nbecause all i want to do is art\nthat's like that's that's how i got to\nknow them right i got to get to know\nthem through games and art and we're\nlike yeah we can work on this big\nproject together it'll be great\ni'm like okay cool so i just like i\nstraight up like\ndropped out of high school um and i was\nlike i just ran away\nwith them um and like my\nuh like my\nmy family and stuff they they they\ntalked to my abuser and they were under\nthe guise that it was like some sort of\ninternship or something so that's that's\nhow my family stayed out of it but like\nmy family's so aloof\nwith me that like they like they really\ndon't give a [ __ ] about what i do\nso um like that's how i got away with it\nand so i'm living with this person and\nlike like i said it starts off\nwe start off very friendly uh but the\nfriendly interactions were so\nconsistent and like he had such like a\nvested like like\ninterest in just paying attention to me\nthat that in itself is strange right\num but again he would never do anything\nto cross the line\nso kind of how it evolved is that\nonce he like came forward to me that he\nhad feelings um\nand like i was younger and like i had\nfeelings for him too i was like very\nimpressionable and like this person's\npaying a lot of attention to me\nand they're like really good at this\ngame and the scene that like and they're\nall\nhe's friends with like all these higher\nup players and like they're all super\ngood and wow like\nyou know i thought it was really cool at\nthe time um\nlike that's that's kind of like how i\nlike felt like i got like really like\ninfatuated with it almost\nand um like\ni'm trying i'm trying to be specific but\nalso like i said there's just like so\nbe as vague as you want to don't worry\nabout it keep going i mean like\njust let's just let's just like\nbasically when he when he started to get\nlike sexual with it i was like\nat that point i was already reeled in\nlike i was already gonna say yes\nso like he had done his part to make\nsure i trusted him\nand before any of this actually happened\nto this is a really important thing\num he made sure that i was isolated from\neveryone else\nin my life like when we lived there he\nimmediately from the bat like when we\nlike once we moved in and got to know\neverybody he told me behind my\nbehind everyone's back he's like hey i\ndon't like these people\ndon't get close to them like he just\nstraight up said that\nand so you know me only knowing him i\nwas like i just\ni just trusted him so i mean i always\nthought that was suspicious but at the\nsame time i had like no one else there\nbecause\nyou know it's a sky house and like the\nother big guy who's in power there is\nalso\nvery sus and i also felt that\nimmediately after that very suspicious\num like i don't know if you've heard of\nall the sky stuff\nlike sky williams he's taken\nlong totaling over like two hundred\nthousand dollars i know\nskye is skye has come on the stream\nseveral times\nso i know skye williams well but he's\nfrom uh\nyou might want to do some digging you\ndon't have to dig far\nanyways like he\nhe just like i just had these two\nsuspicious figures to go to but i'm\ngonna trust the one that i've known way\nlonger obviously and i was really good\nfriends with\num and like he wanted to get sexual with\nit so i just like did whatever he wanted\npretty much\nand um like it\nit was only after like and i didn't know\nany better\nlike like i said i was a really\nmisguided youth\nwho like just really all i wanted to do\nwas draw so like as long as i got to do\nthat i\nreally didn't give a [ __ ] but as i got\nolder as an adult\nand when things were starting to go\nsouth between us\ni like realized you know this person\ndoesn't care about me\nthey only did all these things to take\nadvantage advantage of me\num and when i thought that you know they\nreally cared and i think this is kind of\nthe feeling we're all getting from\nhearing all these stories about these\npeople because they're almost like\nfamily members to us at this point it's\nlike hearing like your family\ndo something really shitty and you just\ncan't believe it like this person\nwhen we ran like this business together\nthat's another reason why i stayed with\nhim for so long like\nwhen it came down to it he refused to\nlike\nsplit anything evenly with me and that\neven included like all my artwork the\nmoney\nlike the the resources like the\ninventory all of that he\ninsisted that it was because of him that\ni was able to do everything\nthat we had done i was like that was the\nlast draw i was like okay this guy\nis a piece of [ __ ] like i can't believe\ni trusted him\nthat like you know he's finally showing\nhis true colors um\nand like after years and years of being\nlike quote-unquote best friends you know\nit's hard to erode that\nlike that that really was everything\nthat needed to be said\nand even worse came came all the\ntroubles when i would try to like\nbasically get him to admit to what he\ndid you know like he\nhe made sure that i was manipulated into\nnot\ntelling anybody about anything until i\nwas legal so that he wouldn't\nface any like actual legal repercussions\nwhich again like i want to say he like\nhe knows the line like he knows that if\nany of this got out if there's any proof\nof him doing anything while in the minor\nhe's [ __ ] so he does everything he can\nto get me to shut up and make sure that\nhe doesn't have anything\num on him you know just like how like\nnairo is giving captain zach two\nthousand dollars a month to have him not\nsaying anything you know because the\nall these guys these guys that's what\ni'm talking about manipulation and\ngrooming is like they know what they're\ndoing\nthey know the laws they know what the\nconsequences are\nand they're going to do everything in\ntheir power to make sure that they don't\nface them\nwow that's that's really helpful thank\nyou for sharing all that i\ni'm kind of noticing\nin a weird way i like i think it's\ninteresting what what i'm hearing here\nso\nyou know there's isolation i'm i'm just\ntrying to\nso let me just take a step back so part\nof the reason that i was really\num in a sense excited although it's a\nweird word to use in this context\nto have this conversation with you folks\nis because\ni don't know how things change\nand in my experience if you want\nsomething to change you have to\nunderstand it first you have to know\nwhat it looks like\nlike if i want to diagnose covid in\nsomeone i have to know what the symptoms\nof kovit are\nand the fact that that the metoo\nmovement is so widespread not just in\nthe gaming community it feels like the\ngaming community was lagging behind like\nthe rest of the world in some ways\nbut the fact that it's so widespread in\nsystemic\nmakes me think that like this is still\ngoing on\na bunch of people getting outed in like\none wave\nlike people will have calmed down but i\nthink like\nwithin a few months or a year or two\nlike this is gonna\ncome up again because i don't think\nthere's been a purge\nbut there hasn't been like any kind of\nsystemic\nchange that's happened yet maybe that's\nwhat piggy's been trying to do with the\ncode of conduct or something like that\nand so my approach is to try to like\nlike what we do on stream is try to\neducate people and help them understand\nlike what are they looking for or what\nare they looking\nat and and the reason that i was i\nreally appreciate what you guys shared\nis because i'm noticing like now a\npattern right so if i'm like a 17 year\nold kid\nwho is started streaming on twitch and\nthen a group of people like reach out to\nme\nand then like what are the things that i\nlike what are the check\nboxes right that that this person that\ntries to isolate you that they erode\nyour boundaries and like literally what\nis that\nwhat does that look like that looks that\nlooks like they never do anything wrong\nif they did a little bit more it would\nbe wrong but they never really do\nanything wrong yeah and that at least\nhuh at least at least they're really\nsmart ones\nyeah i think my situation took so long\nbecause\nhe literally played everything correctly\nlike like i said the law looked at the\nsituation\nand anybody who knows what happened they\nwe all kind of looked at it we're like\nwow\nyou really just got played and that's\nkind of how you feel\nafter all this yeah so so that i think\nbrings up\nanother really good point which is that\nfrom the\nperspective of the person who's getting\ngroomed\ni'm noticing that there's a lot of\nreally authentic\nfeeling of caring both ways this person\nreally cares about me\nand i really care about them we're\nimportant to each other right\nand even in retrospect it may\nfeel false but in that moment i can\nimagine that it feels like really really\ncaring i'm noticing there's also like a\ncertain amount of like unyieldingness\non the part of the person who's doing\nthe grooming\nright it's like subtle and it's covered\nin velvet but it's like\nmade of iron that there's some things\nthat they're very very like\nharsh or strict about don't become\nfriends with anyone else in the house\nyeah you know yeah um\nand then i think the other thing that\nyou know just in terms of a red flag is\nlike\nthings that are done in secret\nright and like like i'm just trying to\nenvision like if i were trying to\neducate i have two daughters and if i\nwas trying to educate them\nabout like what to look out for you know\nit's going to be someone who tries to\nisolate you that you care about\nthat you feel like cares about you and\nthat they ask you to do things in secret\nand it's your special secret it's not\njust it other people wouldn't understand\nexactly and and so if you find yourself\nhaving those kinds of thoughts\nlike oh i know that this looks bad but\nthis is different\nbecause they really care about\nlike there's a part where i think huh go\nahead\nbobby i was just gonna say the other\nthing is that a lot of these people were\npretty well respected and trusted in the\nscene\nso to an outside observer they looked\nlike trustworthy people\num and that that to me feels like it's\nparticular that makes it even harder\nuh yeah right yeah i also want to point\nout\num another sign to look out for\nis an unreasonable amount of investment\nin the person\nwhere uh you have to ask yourself why\nis all this investment going into me\ndon't you have other friends don't you\nhave other people that like they isolate\nthemselves\ntoo and uh to the point where it just\ndoesn't make sense how\nthis brand new relationship and they i\nguess they try to convince you that this\nis different\nfrom the outside world when really\nif you're just like a a nice caring\nperson you should have that relationship\nwith several people\nin my opinion in some abuse\nrelationship conversations you call it a\nlove bomb when they just\n100 focus on you and the relationship\nescalates super quick\num and you don't have time to think\nabout is this right\nam i comfortable yeah\nyeah that's really help\ni i i just wanted to kind of offer a\nperspective i've been thinking about a\nlot uh you know it has\nyour dr k you you're just asking about\nuh what you say to your daughters i mean\nyour\nyour duty your responsibility is to them\nfor us you know we feel i think all of\nus feel\nresponsibility towards the community\nmore broadly one of the things that i\nthought about a lot is just\nthe environment and in the past\nlike i remember we had a show at the\ntwitch office where people who were\nunder age were\noh maybe it wasn't at the twitch office\nmaybe it was somewhere else but\npeople were around booze and they were\nnot old enough and there\nwere people there who were old enough to\nknow that that was a problem but we\ndidn't say anything\num i feel that one of the things that\nhelped us change the culture for the\nbetter in the past is when\npeople felt comfortable saying that they\nfelt uncomfortable with something\nand one of the things that this is\nhighlighted for me is that\nthere could be yellow flags going on\nthat we don't that i don't it doesn't\ni don't have the awareness to say yet\nand then i'm developing that but the\nawareness to say\nhey who's in charge here because like\nwe're doing something messed up and like\ni want to know that whoever's in charge\nof this get-together is responsible for\nmaking sure that people who are minors\nuh are like not making bad decisions\ni feel that one of the things that we\ncould do to help\nis just get people better connected um\nbecause\nit feels hard to me to to feel like our\nsolution is to help educate minors you\nknow it's like\ni want to be able to talk to people who\nare like top players and be able to hear\nfrom them or i want them to have people\nthey can talk to when they're saying\nlike hey i'm feeling weird i'm doing\nsome [ __ ] you know what i mean like\na lot of this stuff i have to imagine\nhappened without people really talking\nabout\nwhat was going on at all you know\nthere's like so much secrecy and\ni've been thinking about the environment\nthat allows that kind of secrecy\nwhere things are just in sight but\nnobody knows quite what's behind\nthat story right we're talking about\nrumors that have been around\ngo ahead i'm just saying you bring up\nthe great\npoint that we want to find somebody\nthat our community is missing someone\nwho's responsible right who do you go to\nat the party that's\nthat's like we don't allow an 18 year\nold um is it the tournament organizer\nthey're probably pretty busy right now\ntrying to do pools and running things\nright\nyes um like who is responsible for\nlooking out for a minor who is\nresponsible for\nchecking ids or seeing who people go\nhome with\num and i think there's something\ninteresting about the history of smash\nthe fact that we've been grassroots\nmeans that we haven't had the kind of\ncompany funding\nor um uh adults who could come in and do\nthat\nthat job right there hasn't been anybody\nlooking out for anybody's safety\num and and that's led to a lot of what\nwe've seen\nuh a lot of people that's messed up in\nthe first place right that we have\nenvironments that people can come in\nwhere\nthere really isn't no one's thinking\nabout it like yeah that's you got a wild\nwild west going on there's going to be\nsome problems\nin the in the saloon i don't know if\nthat was the right word\nyeah so i mean what are you guys\nany other thoughts i mean we've been\ntalking for a little while we've focused\nuh i've noticed hugs and tk have been up\nyeah go ahead bobby\nthe the two things that shook me number\none i feel i was very naive\nabout power i think it that cloud thing\nlike i thought that was a meme and\npeople just talk about it whatever\num seriously i mean jesus do you\nremember we had a long conversation\nwhere i was like i don't\ni feel like i have no clout you were\nlike are you kidding me i don't i\ndon't understand cloud i have a blind\nspot towards it but\nthe ways that people who have it can\nthe the privileges that they have and\ntheir ability to manipulate\nthat has really uh impacted me and i've\nthought a lot about it\nthe second thing that's shaken me is\nthat\nsome people a lot of people in in this\nkind of you know this\nme too wave they have been predators\nright like i feel empathy for people who\nslip\nup and make a mistake i definitely do\nbecause\nsometimes [ __ ] happens and we make bad\ndecisions we're not proud of but\nbeing a predator is different than that\nbeing a predator implies intentionality\nit implies\na lot that's not a crime of passion sort\nof thing and\nuh at minimum i feel that if we can\nha if we can create an environment where\nat minimum we can catch\npredators people who are try right with\nintention who are doing things\nintentionally then that's\na lot better than where we are today\nyeah i think like i mean in general that\nactually that swings into that kind of\nties this together in a nice way because\nlike dr piggy you were saying like there\nneeds to be somebody that people can go\nto\nand just you know with the whole how\ngrassroots the scene is i'm not\ni i'm like reading the chat i think a\nlot of people are like kind of lost it's\nlike\nyou know the smash scene it's not\nregulated by any big\norganization like it's it's it's\nliterally\nus up here on the screen right now it's\npeople like us it's the players the\ncommentators the like content creators\num it's like we we are the people\nregulating it but we have\nregular lives nintendo isn't doing\nanything\nand they probably won't i mean i look at\nit\nso um like that all being said like\nyou know it obviously can't be perfect\nbut i think it'd be interesting\nit's one thing people do have to think\nabout is that before all this came to\nlight\npeople would go to people but it's the\npeople in power\nwere the ones with all the clout and\nyou know they're being all buddy buddy\nwith like other really nice people\nand you know there's this whole kind of\njust like oh they must be a good person\nkind of accepted truth\nand like so they'll go to them and\nthey'll go to people like d1 they'll go\nto people like\ni don't know like katar or like just\nsenpai and like they'll\nthey'll their beloved you know\nfront-facing community members and\nthat's kind of why\na lot of these people were also able to\nget away with it because when you have\nsuch power and you have so much like\nthere's such a like imbalance especially\nwithin a grassroots community where the\npeople in charge are literally just the\nmost popular people\num it's like\nyou know there's the only real good way\nto go about\nfixing that i i think and like you can\ndr pig or anyone else here you know\nyou guys have different perspectives on\nthis you can probably try to educate or\nilluminate more on it but\ni feel like spreading awareness in this\nway\nand kind of establishing it as like the\ncommunity tone\nlike hey none of us are gonna tolerate\nthis and\nyou know not not doesn't matter how like\nhow big of your\nyour following is like if all the big\nplayers like you know like luffin was on\nmy side a lot\num like ludwig backed me up and like you\nknow mango all these people they spoke\nout on it\ndo you know how much power that has and\nthat\nthat doesn't that that doesn't require\nlike nintendo that doesn't require like\nlike years worth of effort or just like\ngoing through the trouble of like trying\nto structurize some kind of\nlike convoluted like like legal system\nwithin smash like that\nalone has so much power and because\nthose people spoke up\neveryone else who's following them sees\nthose things\nand now they're aware of it so like i\nthink\ni think like that plus having like\npeople\nwho they can go to like at events like i\nwould hope that you know people\nif something was happening people can\ntrust me or like they could talk to us\nlike dr piggy or like maybe you guys\num i think that would that's a really\ngood starting point for like actual\nchange\nand i've got to say um\nso the code of conduct was created\nthrough the community leadership\nwe consulted lawyers did lots of\nresearch on it we have this\nsuper thorough system to process cases\nbut it turns out that the need\nis enormous that is with the amount of\nreports we get\nwe cannot process in a fair manner um we\never since the events of july we've got\nabout 250\nand in our entire two years of existence\nbecause we want to do every case right\nbecause we want to hear both sides of\nthe story because we want to confirm\nit takes about six weeks per case so do\nthe math there\nthat's like we've processed 20 out of\n250 cases\num completely unpaid completely uh\nno no protections legally um no\njust out of the goodness of volunteering\nand and caring about the community\num turns out it's not that sustainable\num and\nfirsthand i would say costs me an\nenormous\nemotional toll\nand it should never fall to just me or\nit should never fall to\neven a group of five you know um so i\nthink what jesus is saying\nis an important part of a cultural shift\ni do think we need\nstructure i do think we need some place\nwhere a victim can go and say\nlike this is what happened and we can\ndecide what's a fair ban but i don't\nknow how we can do that right now when\nthere's\nnot there's just not enough there's not\nenough money there's not enough\npeople that care i\ni'm laughing because you're kind of\nsaying there's not enough\nright and i sort of get that but\nnot enough has two sides of the equation\nit has\nnumber of predators on one side and\nnumber of like let's say code of conduct\npeople on the other\nand and so the the funny thing there is\nthat i think that the way that\nyou even those odds is by reducing the\nnumber of predators\nand so that that i think gets yeah even\n20\ncases run it's better than zero yeah but\nyou know i i still\ni'm with you i'm not i'm just saying\nthat like i think that if you think\nabout you know you're saying that\nthe number of cases we're getting is too\nhigh and that's because\nthere are too many offenders out there\nright so\none solution is to increase your\nresources which by all means if it's\npossible awesome\nbut the other thing and this is where\nsometimes i i kind of wonder because\nlike\nyou know i remember hearing uggs and\nkind of tk talk at the beginning about\nhow like it's strange because like you\nknew this person\nright and like you were close to them\nand then you have trouble reconciling\nthe person that they sort of turned out\nto be\nand this could just be my you know\nprofessional experience i've worked in\nlike prisons and stuff\nand and one of the things that i i've\ncome to appreciate is that like\nit's not that a person is good or bad\nwhich i know sounds bizarre i mean some\npeople really\ncan be predominantly bad i've certainly\nworked with those people\nbut but i think that even even like like\ni'm just trying to figure out like if\ni'm a predator\nwhat do i do right so i i think if we if\nwe talk to\nyou know like what do you do like let's\nsay that you're 25 years old\nyou're part of the smash community and\nin the rest of the world like this is\nwhat we see with the community that we\nwork with right so like why do we play\ngames it's because\nwe like who we are in the game i'm a\nsomeone\nand then outside of the smash community\nlike you guys are talking about all this\npower dynamic and clout\nand stuff like that outside of the smash\ncommunity who have a new one\nand i may have a certain amount of\nsocial anxiety because lo and behold\nlike\nyou know since the age of nine instead\nof developing social skills\ni developed smash skills and then\nalong comes a 16 year old boy or girl\nwho suddenly like they look up at me and\nmy social anxiety is less because\nthey clearly are into me and i know it's\nnot right\nto you know start a sexual relationship\ni wouldn't even know how to\nbut i express interest in them and they\nexpress interest in me and boy do they\nreally like me\nand then i really like them they're\nreally awesome i invest a lot of my time\nand i really do care about that i try to\nhelp them right\nbecause they have nowhere else to go so\ni want to be a nice guy\nand so i invite them to come stay with\nme and then something strange happens\ni've cared about them for so long i've\nsupported about them so long and then i\nstart to develop feelings\nthen what do i do with that\nright so i think that like this this\nkind of slippery slope\ni mean you guys are you're making it\nsound very intentional and i'm sure in\nsome cases it is\nbut the other thing that i don't know i\ndon't know like what someone in that\nsituation\ndoes like how do they learn how to stop\na lot of therapy with somebody that\nactually holds you accountable and\ndoesn't just tell you nice things about\nyourself\ni don't know that's my recommendation\nsure i wouldn't say\ni was gonna say like that's fine and all\nuntil like you know i kind of stand by\nthe idea that people reveal who they are\nwhen it really matters\nand like in the case of like zero for\ninstance\nthe guy took like three different twit\nlongers and like literally\ntried to manipulate other victims behind\ntheir backs because he knew what else\nwas coming like he tried to get them to\nshut up\nand like you're you know if you're\nreally sorry\ni'm sorry i don't care how many\ncharacters you type up or what kind of\ndeflections you make with your arguments\nlike if you're really sorry you own up\nto what happened you say\nwhat happened you own up to it and you\nsay you're sorry\nand in every single case\nwhere you know somebody came out with\nsomething\nthey deflected like you know d1 he\nstraight up said i don't remember\nyeah anti was just like yeah oh\nno these women are out to get me it's\nlike it's\nwhy are these women out to get you you\nknow or like or he'll straight up say\nlike oh yeah i did this thing and i'm\nnot sorry for it it's like what\nand like i think i think that's the\ndifference like there are\nlike like bobby said you can slip up you\ncan do something and make someone feel\nuncomfortable and that's\nthat is just a part of like growing up\nand like developing social skills or\nlike just getting to know someone but\nit what matters is when you're\nconfronted with that truth\nand how you handle it yeah\nat the end of the day i think with a lot\nof people they did not handle oh good go\nforward\ntk you haven't said okay i think i think\na lot of people\ndid not handle it in a way that\nlike there was no un discernible way\nwhere you would think that they're\ntrying to change\nother than i'm trying to save my career\nlike i think that\n90 of the people who did come out and\nput their apology statement\nwasn't really apology or an explanation\nor anything like that or like a\nyes like i've done these things when i\nwas um\nyou know younger or whatever mostly\npeople probably couldn't do that anyway\nbecause a lot of this stuff was recent\nbut like for those who may\nhave like stuff that like came out from\nfive years ago or whatever\nand they have since then like have\nlearned their ways and they are like\ni've changed the person that you can\nphysically physically you know visibly\nsee that change\nlike that should have been the way that\nuh at least someone\nsome of them should have addressed it\nbut instead it just seemed like almost\neverybody who\nwanted to uh like counter-argue\ntheir allegation only did it\nfor the fact of like either trying to\ndisprove the other person or\nto like save their career as jesus said\ni mean it really took zero like four\ntimes before he told the truth\num you know what i'm saying and then\nslippery [ __ ] when you think\nabout\nyeah yeah and when you think about uh\nnairo\nuh that that situation with him it was\nswept it was\nhe kept he i mean he paid hush money to\nkeep his career\nyou know what i mean and i think\nif you're going to address it like that\nthen you're obviously not going to\nlearn from your mistakes i think if\nyou're not like really\nuh trying to change for the better to be\nlike a better person\nregardless of your career then you know\nyou're not\nyou're not really learning you're just\nlearning how to hide your i guess\npredatory instincts better\nand that's that's not good i mean\nwe a lot of people been making this joke\nrecently about like how\num the smash community like you know two\nmonths ago\neveryone was like oh believe women you\nknow oh we need to\nkick out predators but now like no one's\nsaying that anymore because like it's\nnot the hot topic or whatever because\nlike people didn't actually care they\njust wanted to appear like they cared\nuh to look like they were the good guys\nwithout actually\nputting in any like good input um or\nactually changing their own ways to help\nout in the future um\ni won't say that like i vehemently talk\nabout this every day\nobviously but i still have my own\ncommands to talk about you know things\nyou can\nyou can educate yourself on uh on sexual\nassault rape and all that good stuff and\nhow you can help out and things like\nthat and on top of that i've just\nin the last five six years i've been\nmore like on more diligent about like\nhow i\ni present myself to uh\nwell one women or just to anybody who\nwould like would feel\ni guess some level of pressure for me\nbecause i don't want that like i don't\nwant to\ni don't want anyone to feel unsafe\naround me um for like any reason\nand i think that if more people were to\ntake\nthat like mindset we would at least be\nable to start the\ni guess the healing process of the smash\ncommunity so tkd someone says\nyeah go ahead piggy if someone says you\nhurt them\nyou stop and you listen and you say\neven if i didn't intend to did i is it\npossible\nyeah and that's how you grow i think a\nlot of people when they're hearing these\nkinds of conversations they\nthey have a way of trying to convince\nthe other person how\nwell that's not what i intended to do so\nyou shouldn't feel hurt by it\nrather than understanding it from their\nperspective like to truly put themselves\ninto their shoes\nto see how they feel about your actions\nand that's the only thing that should\nmatter it shouldn't matter what your\nintention was it's more about how you\nmade them feel with your actions that\ncould have been predatory it could have\nbeen\nyou know made them feel uncomfortable\nand even if you never intended to be\nthat kind of person as long as they feel\nthat way that's what you did that's the\ntruth of the matter\nso um when there are people that are\ntrying to grow and trying to understand\nhow they could be less problematic\nthat's\none of the best things you can do is to\nstop with the mentality of convincing\npeople that your intentions weren't what\nthey think they were\nand instead focus on you know how they\nactually felt about the situation\nand what you could have done differently\nto stop them from feeling that way it\ndoesn't matter what the hell your\nintention was\nif they felt that way impact instead of\nintent\nyeah tk you mentioned that you had\nyou had sort of changed a little bit\nabout the way that you think about your\ninteractions can you share that with us\nyeah i mean just when i was younger i\nwas like\ni was grow crazy you know you're like\ni'm not gonna a lot i was definitely\nlike very much into like i would go to\ntournaments and i was there for the game\nobviously but like i was\nlike also very much interested in the\nlike the females or the women that were\nthere at the tournament and like\ni wasn't it wasn't like i was like\noverstepping any boundaries but i was\nyou know\nlike i would be more like\num i don't know flirtatious than i need\nto be that than\nthan what uh i should have been too\nearly i guess before anything was\nestablished\nthings like that and as i started to\ngrow up you know you just kind of\nrealize that like\nwhat one like isn't that big of a deal\nand two like\nyeah this this favorite could be seen as\nlike\ncreepy so like as i started to grow up i\njust became less\nyou know for like a better term thirsty\nlike just you know\nlike you kind of just you just kind of\njust go about uh well once\nthat and also i just started like\nworking on my career a lot more so like\nthere's\nlike i put more time into like becoming\nlike a better commentator all that good\nstuff so like most of my time was filled\nup with\nthat stuff but then like to be\non this side now to be the person that\npeople trust\num when like things happen it's a lot\nmore fulfilling\nfor me than to like i don't know\npotentially hook up with someone\nuh like\ni i usually there's been situations\nwhere like\nmy uh like my women friends would\nlike come to me because someone was\nchasing them around the the bar someone\nwas\nspeaking to them like in a weird manner\nand like they wanted to feel safe so\nthey would come to me\ni like that a lot more than being\nthe person who is making them feel\nunsafe and half having to find\nuh a person that they can trust like\nthat um\nso yeah i just i don't know i grew up\nlike\nlike i think that's the easiest turn\njust like i just i grew up you know and\nuh\nunfortunately i feel like a lot of my\npeers did not as they were still\nyou know facing skirts you know in in in\na very malicious\nand i guess predatory way and\ni guess in in some ways i felt like\ni may have seen it but mostly more so\nlike\ndistance myself because like that's not\nwhat i wanted to do anymore when it\ni i should have trying to be a little\nmore like\nuh i guess let's say educational about\nit you know like i should have been like\nhey bro like you know we're getting old\nnow this is not like this ain't the way\nyou know what i'm saying but\nlike i don't know like in some ways i\nfeel like\nit's not my responsibility obviously but\nit also because they are my friends it\nis kind of my responsibility like i\nshould have said something\nbut you're your own human and i'm not\nsure if you're gonna listen to me anyway\nso i'm just gonna continue to do me\nand like become a better person myself\nsorry like i think i think so i've had a\nlot of people when this came out they\nwere like messaging me personally\nsaying like not because they did\nanything to me but they just felt so\nbad like you know like the whole\nself-reflection like they\nwere associated with a lot of these\npeople and like they might have seen\nsome signs or suspicious signs but like\nthey didn't do anything to stop it\nand like i have to say like i don't\nthink anyone should ever feel like\nthey did something wrong like they\nshouldn't feel like it was totally their\nsole responsibilities\nto stop something in every situation\nbecause the truth of it is\nis that the person doing the thing\nshould just not be doing in the first\nplace\nright like that that accountability\nshould be held with them\nnot with you but obviously like you know\nthat's the world\nthe world would be great if like things\nactually worked out the way that they\nshould\nbut you know that's not how things are\nso like\nobviously i just think like if people if\nthere's one thing to take away is like\nif you just do your best and\neducate yourself or try to educate\nyourself really and make that effort\num like that that alone i think\nactually stops a lot of people from like\ndoing things\nlike the fact that like for instance\nlike you know tk you're up here and\nyou're like talking about this like you\nknow\nanyone who's around you or any guy and\nlike with the with the\nstanding that you do have if they were\ngonna do something if you're there\nthey're not gonna do it anymore\nyou know and like i feel like that like\njust just\nthen like that you know like i said like\nyou're not being perfect but you're just\ndoing everything you can but like doing\nsomething is so much better than not\ndoing anything\nand like that goes first that goes for\nlike everybody in the scene right now\nthat is\nor has done something to speak up about\nit you know\nyeah so i i've discovered something kind\nof interesting since i've\nbeen engaging with the internet i've\nnoticed that you know if people are\ntrying to figure out\nis my behavior a problem there's an\ninteresting diagnostic test which is\ndo you refer to women as females if the\nanswer is yes\nthere's a decent chance i think it's\nmore likely that maybe some of your\nbehavior needs to be adjusted\nit's a good litmus test that's a yellow\nflag for me\nright it's funny i don't know if you\nguys caught but tk actually\nre reframed in the middle of the\nsentence\ndid you guys see that barely it's a\nit's a\ni grew up in the south in like a\npredominantly black area in the south\nand like that's just how that's how they\nlike\nsay no no i i i'm not trying to blame i\nget what you're i get what you're saying\nthough like i definitely catch myself\nbecause i know that like\nin the real world like that's not a good\nway to refer to women\nbut like it definitely is something that\nlike\nuh i've still had to learn not to say\nbecause like i don't mean it with\nmalicious intent but i know that like it\nto other people that like saying like\nusually\nwhen it's said it is in a way where it's\nlike man females be\nyou know like females would be shopping\nor whatever like people say it in ways\nthat like it's negative but i'm just\nsaying it because like\nit's i don't know like the word just\nhits easier for me however i definitely\nwill catch myself\nin in normal conversation where if i'm\nabout to say i'm like oh no no i don't\nwant\ni don't want to be perceived in a way so\nsay women say girls say anything\nbut that so yeah i also think to that\npoint\num because tk was mentioning this\nearlier uh when you're\nso we we have a lot of influence with\nour guy friends like men have influence\nover other men if they're like friends\nand things like that and a lot of these\nthings that go on i think are part of a\nculture that allows them to exist\nso uh one of those ways to address that\npart of the culture is that you check\nyour boys when they're using words like\nfemales or [ __ ] even\nand you stop them then and there because\neven though\nthey feel comfortable around it around\nby saying it around their friends\nbecause you know it's not a big deal\nwho's going to get offended\nit's uh the thing is it just creates\nthis culture of\nobjectifying women to the point where\nit's going to manifest itself into some\nactual action\nthat shows that disrespect so even if\nthey're not feeling disrespected because\nyou're not saying it in front of them\nthe fact that you're doing it regularly\nand you are you know among\na group that's just constantly\nencouraging it\neventually that lack of respect is going\nto come out in a different kind of way\nso even just\nchecking your friends on these little\nthings that go on constantly\nit's gonna hopefully make them\nvalue women as just another human that\nthey value\non the regular right um so yeah i mean\nthe the\ni think that the female thing is uh is\nan indicator i think\nsaying [ __ ] all the time instead of\nwomen is a huge [ __ ]\nindicator sorry but hugs on the stream\nhugs i\ni i've got a question for you so\nsometimes when i try to tell my friends\nnot to call\n[ __ ] [ __ ] and i say you should\ncall them women they call me a simp cuck\nwell when i when i've dealt with that\nsort of thing like there's always\nalways push back whenever i bring it up\nand i i just tell them\nlike they're they're like you know i\ndon't mean a man like why are you making\na big deal about it i'll always tell\nthem\nlike it's not there there's a way to\nexplain\nlike first you tell them that first of\nall like are you going to stay in front\nof them so why are you sitting in front\nof me\nand then uh then that's that's when they\nsay what are you a simp cuck\nyeah yeah well then i would say no it's\njust that they're they're\nhumans just like us and if you wouldn't\nsay it in front of them like would you\nwant someone saying that about your\nmother your sister like you\nyou find ways to relate it to them and\nthen you also say honestly i\ni put it into different perspectives\nwhere i say okay let's say like\nwith racism right if you're dropping the\nn bomb\nand and then and then you just hide it\nfrom everyone else do you think that's\ncool and then if i'm dealing with\nsomeone who's\nnot racist they'll be like no that's not\nokay at all\ni'm like right and then usually you have\npeople that are\nsaying it publicly it's because they do\nit all the time privately and then\nthey're actually losing respect for this\ngroup of people because they're\nconstantly\nengaging behavior that just devalues\nthem right\nso then why the hell are you okay with\ndoing this with women\nand they could call me as like at that\npoint their argument of of me just being\na simp and just doing it for this\npurpose kind of breaks down because\nyou you explain to them how this applies\nto so many other things\nand how if they actually want to value\npeople as people then they got to just\nstop this\nbehavior in general like even in private\neven with your boys etc\nand i have some experience yeah i have\nsome experience with this so back in the\nday we used to\nuse uh homophobic language to describe\nany play style that was like\nannoying and we used to use the word\nrape\nuh to talk about like domination if you\nwould really destroy somebody\nand that was really widespread you know\ni don't know 10 years ago\nand it took time to switch that and you\nknow my wife helped me understand why\nthose\nthings were not good so i literally\ndidn't know i was ignorant to it\nbut once i knew i had this very\nexperience of saying like hey don't say\nrape like that and people would be like\nyou know they would talk [ __ ] about me\nwhat i ended up doing was saying like\nyeah i am a simp cuck so\njust shut the [ __ ] up about it like\ndon't say that around me kind of thing i\nwould just say like yes that's me yes\ni'm a\n[ __ ] cuck um\nyeah i mean yes if that's what you want\nto call me then yes that's exactly what\ni am\num and eventually it got to a place\nwhere they were curious about why i was\nso pissed off about it\nand i found that that really helped you\nknow when when i had people\nasking me legitimately like okay fine so\nyou're a cuck like why do you care so\nmuch about this\nthen for whatever reason i felt like it\nwas way easier to explain\nthat new people come into this room and\nplay melee with us\nokay people who don't know us are in\nthis room playing and when we say [ __ ]\nlike that they don't know who we are\nthey sure [ __ ] don't know who i am\nand i don't want them to think that i'm\ncool with that because i don't know who\nthey are\ni have friends we all have friends who\nare who are gay who have played melee\nfor a long time where\nthey were so uh immersed in that kind of\nlanguage that they would say it\nthemselves but i didn't know if they had\na problem with it they hadn't even come\nout you know\nso learning later on that people who are\nnear and dear to me were in the room we\nwere talking about oh you're playing gay\nuh they just sat through that and didn't\nsay anything took that on the shoulder\nthat uh really bothered me after i\nlearned\nlike what we had been doing and so i\ndon't know to be honest i feel like\nwhat gives me strength is the idea that\ni think melee is\n[ __ ] dope and i think anybody who\nthinks that it's dope should be able to\nplay it without a problem\nright and so if anybody's creating a\nproblem for somebody who wants to play\nmelee then they i feel like they've got\na problem with me\nso that's what lets me feel strong and\nsaying like yeah i'm a cook i'm\nsimping for anybody who wants to play\nmelee also i want to say\nwomen love simcocks like\nno that's not why it's not part of my\nmotivation but\nthat's cool the term simp has gone so\nwarped\nthat like i like saw some [ __ ] on like\nokay\ni don't know i don't follow the\nmainstream internet that much but i saw\nlike idubbbz or whatever in his\ngirlfriend like they're calling him a\nsim for having a girlfriend it's like\nwhat\nhe has a girlfriend and you don't it's\nlike\nif being a sim card gets you the girl\nthen i don't know what the [ __ ] to say\nbut anyway it sounds like the sim card\nis the true chad\ni think so when everything flips at a\ncertain point everything goes full\ncircle\ncar was literally being in the chat he\nwas the dude that said like stop we got\nto not do this he went against the grain\nand like that's like\nto me that takes more balls than like\nand you know\nit definitely does and as soon as one\nthing i want to say is that i think the\nfirst follower is just\nas important as the leader here because\nuh the first person to say like hey\ndon't use that language around me\nthey're super vulnerable\nbut if you're in that situation and you\nfeel any kind of way and you can back\nthat person up who's on the right side\nthat goes so far i can't i really can't\nexpress\nhow that changes the culture more than\nany one person\nso there's some people who are going to\ntake the lead and who are going to tank\nbut then there's other people who are\nyou know the healers behind you got to\nlike keep their health up because they\nget hit\nyeah and i just want to mention that uh\nwhen\nwhen a lot of these accusations came out\nin july one of the things that\nyou know people were called out for\nbehavior from the past and then one of\nthe defenses were always uh well that's\njust how things were back then right\nand i think that as a community we\nalways need to be\nforward looking and thinking where um\nuh you should be uncomfortable with\nthings before it's cool to be\nuncomfortable with them right like\nlike the way like i always commend scar\nfor this because he was\ntalking about how we shouldn't say uh\nhomophobic slurs and\nand these uh and words like rape that\nmake people uncomfortable\nuh way before uh anyone was even\nthinking about that\nand he got a lot of [ __ ] for it but uh\nthings don't change unless you challenge\nwhat's going on\nnormally and he did so now we're at a\npoint where i could ask someone like do\nyou think it's okay\nto to use homophobic slurs and then\nthey'll just\nbe like obviously not and we're at that\npoint now and we're not going to be at\nthat point with\nlanguage and behavior that makes women\nuncomfortable unless we challenge it\nbefore it's cool to\nchallenge you yeah you have to be\nforward thinking you have to start\nchallenging it now so that\na year from now or hopefully sooner when\nwhen you say uh you know is it okay to\nuse the word [ __ ] to describe women\nthey're gonna be like\nthat makes no sense that's an awful\nthing to do right so like you you have\nto\nnot wait for things to be okay you have\nto\nmake them not okay like and honestly\njust like what\ntk said about like okay it's fun to hook\nup with somebody but it feels so much\nbetter\nright when people are coming to you and\nlike you're really able to help them\ni just feel like yes it's not fun in the\nbeginning to challenge the status quo\nbut\nwhen it changes it's really gratifying\nlike i'm proud of what we were able to\ndo i know that we've got a lot more work\nto do but like\nchanging the language is big and it took\na it took some time but\ni'm just proud that we did it i mean\ndamn dude i was also pretty happy that\nyou know we weren't like oh where's the\nproof with all the stuff coming out\nyeah because uh i could've gone that way\ni don't think our specific\nproblem is just uh strictly the\npredators that we've caught\ni think it's a cultural problem that we\nhave had in the scene\nand that's like you you presented the\nquestion earlier about\nminimizing the amount of predators that\nwe have i think changing the culture\nwhich includes you know\nuh people in power saying this [ __ ]\nain't cool and then\nalso the language that we used even\nbehind closed doors like you you address\nlike all these cultural things\num and i think that starts to help i\nthink that starts to change things you\nknow you at least minimize\njust like we minimize the amount of\npeople that are hateful towards\num people of of of different\nsexualities and things like that like we\nwe can do that with\nuh with the people that make women\nuncomfortable or assault them\nand are predators and things like that\nlike we could change the culture and\nstart minimizing that as well\ni i would hope yeah so and i do want to\nadd that one thing you can do besides\nyou know calling out your buds and like\npushing for this cultural shift it's\nimportant to amplify the voices of the\npeople that experienced it firsthand too\nso you know it's it's great to be able\nto explain but\nuh you know if somebody else makes if a\ngirl makes a tweet about how sexism\nmakes her feel you don't have to explain\nover her you can just retweet and that\nis\nyou know that is using your influence to\nto elevate and amplify something that\nsomeone personally experience reminds me\nof this phrase i don't know if you guys\never heard this\nbefore but no snowflake feels\nresponsible for the avalanche\ni've never heard that but i like it\num i i guess so let me ask you guys\ntwo questions i i guess the first is i'm\npersonally a little bit confused about\nhow to handle you know believe women\nversus\npeople who do uh fabricate\nallegations so do you guys have any\nthoughts about\nhow to manage that we should do\nmy uh my first instance\nis to like all like i'm gonna read\nwhatever comes out\nthen i'll like if i know this person i\nwill like\nput you know my i will put i would like\nthink about like\nthem as a person and then read this and\nbe like do these two things feel like\nthey match up\nif they do then you know we'll [ __ ] but\nif not\nthen i'm still going to wait i'm not\ngoing to like i never the first person\nto be like oh man\nthat's crazy i can't believe he did this\nbut i'm also not going to be the first\nperson to be like yo\nproof i need to it's just the\ninformation is out there\ni want to see what happens now so\nbasically like i'm just waiting to see\nwhat comes next so if this person goes\nsilent for four days\ni'm more inclined to believe that\nwhatever was written is true but if this\nperson comes out\nlike that day and says you know i have\nyou know i have evidence or whatever\nthat is not true then i'm gonna wait to\nmake my like final judgment you know i'm\nsaying like i'm not gonna call him i'm a\nliar i'm not gonna tell him uh\ntake anything and just immediately\nbelieve but i will at least try to do\nsome like\nuh i guess some rec some thinking on\nboth on all of the information that i\nhave\nuh before making a decision but whoever\ncame out first i'm\nmore unlikely like i'm more inclined to\nbelieve that like especially in this\nclimate that\nwhatever is being said is most likely\nthere's some truth behind it you know\nlike it may not\nbe 1000 correct but there is\na probably a some level some level\nbehavior that has made someone feel\nuncomfortable enough to come up\nto come out with this story so it is\neasier for me to believe\nthat whatever i'm reading is probably\ncloser to the truth than whatever is\ngoing to come out unless that person\ncomes out with like facts receipts and\nall that\nsaying that like yo this didn't happen\nand it does suck because obviously\ni think that the few people that may\nhave come out with a\nwith a fake story like\neven if the story is fake and you're\nable to disprove it like that's still\ngoing to follow you\nlike for a long long time you know and\nit may be like a one or two percent\nuh of stories that are it are fake\nbut those those people are still gonna\nbe hurting just because they've been\nlooped they're going to be lumped in\nwith everybody else because no one\na lot of people didn't go off and do\nresearch after to\nsee if this was fake or not you know\nwhat i'm saying so i think the phrase\nbelieve women doesn't mean whoever was\naccused\nis absolutely guilty and we should go\ndox them and we should condemn them and\nnever speak to them again\ni don't think that's what believe women\nmeans it means that when you read that\nstory for the first time you aren't\nthinking like\nwell maybe she just regrets it it means\nyou're not thinking you're not gonna ask\nlike\nwell did she like flirt with him a\nlittle bit and that's why you thought it\nwas okay\nno you're gonna be like man that sucks\nif that happened\nlike just give me that basic uh uh\nempathy that like if i came forward\nabout this story\nget benefit of the doubt that doesn't\nmean you don't confirm like tk is saying\nyou have to hear both sides because some\nweird [ __ ] does happen\nbut um believe women just means\ndon't try to invalidate what we're\nsaying\nso i it's interesting because what i i\nrealize what i practically do is i take\nthe\nallegations seriously but tend to not\npass\njudgment right away right\nyou know maybe it's not for us to pass\njudgment all the time right like yeah i\nthink every individual community member\ndoesn't need to know all of the gory\ndetails of everybody's lives\nbut again that's assuming that there is\nsomeone that will\nuh uh demand accountability or or have\nsome kind of judgment in the end which\nwho knows if that happens in any given\ncase\ni i will say as someone who's like\nfaced like the brunt of like a lot of\nlike cloud-chasing thought horror\naccusations which by the way\nagain i didn't make my platform off of a\nlot of those like\nconventional things that guys on the\ninternet always hate on\nit was only after i made my accusations\nthat men i only want to say men i don't\nknow who just people on the internet\nimmediately went to dig and try to find\nthe most\nthoughtiest or like most condemning\nthings about me and try to paint me in\nthis light\nand you know again there's not that much\nthere's not really anything on me to be\nhonest but like you'll go on youtube and\nthere's there's video thumbnails they'll\ndick up pictures of me that i posted of\nmyself\nfrom like three or four years ago and\nit's like and there's such a clear\nintent behind it which is\nyou know to paint me like a thought you\nknow like oh this person is just another\ngold digging thought\nlike haha let's all go [ __ ] on her\nbecause as men that's what we like to do\non the internet\nand i think what you know dr piggy and\nall these like the whole rhetoric right\nnow\nis you know people do make up stories\ni'm not going to pretend like that [ __ ]\ndoesn't exist but\nwhen someone comes out with something\nespecially like in my situation where i\nwas putting a lot on the line like when\ni called zero out\nyou know i i was like all right you know\ni know my story is true\ni hope people back me up on it but if\nthis [ __ ] tanks it's like well\nbuy smash community you know and like i\nmean thankfully it didn't but like\nwell maybe look at these situations\nwhere like somebody's not gonna come out\nwith a story like that for no reason\nespecially if they have nothing to gain\nfrom it really\nyou know like what do you get like 10\nminutes of fame especially if they come\nout anonymously like what like they're\nnot getting anything out of it\nand like two like you know\nwomen they don't like like dr piggy said\nwhen she said believe women that doesn't\nmean\noh let's just ignore critical thinking\nlike that's that's all\nthat's that's just as bad as the other\nthing you're doing the same thing just\nthe other way what we're asking for\nis the same credence and respect\nand open-mindedness that you always give\nto\nthe guys that's literally it and if you\ndo that\nthen in most situations like nine times\nout of ten you know you if you\ncritically think through it\nthen you'll arrive to the truth and\nlike i i will say like by default even\nwith how\nyou know i don't like using this word\nbut like not conventionally i've held\nmyself\nlike or presented myself on the internet\ni was i still\nfelt and got a huge like\nlike backlash from the default state of\nmind of men which is just to\nlike hate on the girl and it doesn't\nmatter what you do it's like it's the\nfact that you're a girl\nthey're gonna call you these things\nthey're gonna dig up these things about\nyou and then they're gonna be like here\nthis is what she does she's a thought\nthis is how she makes her living\nit's like that's not even true but like\nthey that's that's what they want to do\nthey just want to hate women\nso that's that is the first thing that\nneeds to be changed and it's still\nsomething that's being fought against\nthat's literally all that that's really\nall that all the good women mean\nand like even if you are a sex worker\nthat does not necessarily\nit doesn't lower your value as a human\nor as a smash community member\nright um i've been called like a social\njustice warrior infiltrator lizard\nperson\njust because they can't believe that a\nwoman would be in smash bros\nor whatever and it's yeah so\nthere are some people that the issue is\nthat you're a woman\nnot everybody but some people will find\nwhatever they can\nand make that the issue yeah\nyeah so what's next guys what do we what\ndo we do\nwhat happens well as of right now i\ndon't know because we're\nyou know with the quarantine stuff like\nit's just\nwe a lot happened in a short amount of\ntime\nuh within the smash community to make it\nfeel like\nyou know it's not that it's dead but\nit's definitely\nlike some type of hiatus now whenever we\ncome back i hope that\nuh these lessons don't get lost like i\nhope that\nafter after seeing that literally and\nlike to any\nto anyone watching or whatever to anyone\nwho plays to anyone who's planning a\ntournament after saying that literally\nanyone can go down\nthat you if you have uh problematic\nbehavior\nthat like it is something that you try\nto fix you know not only for just the\nsmash community but just in life you\nknow i mean like\nthese uh these are not just smash\ncommunity exclusive things these are\nlife lessons\nyou know don't make people feel\nuncomfortable anywhere if you\ncan if you can stop that like if you can\nuh if you have the power to\nto not do that then you know do that um\nso i feel like as far as being a\ncommunity leader\nuh not to say that i am but i know that\nthere\nare people out there that will look up\nto me you know they will look up to us\nthat will look up to anyone with status\nwith clout whatever\nthe best thing we can do is lead by\nexample in my opinion\num i think the best thing we can do is\ncontinue to\nmake those who feel who make other\npeople feel uncomfortable\nuncomfortable you know like if me\ntelling you that like your behavior is\nproblematic and that makes you\nuncomfortable because you are being\nproblematic then good you know what i'm\nsaying\nlike that's that's the reaction that i\nwant because then it's gonna make you\nuh think about you know what you're\ndoing and what you can be doing better\nand that's all i really\nwish to accomplish you know is to make\nsure that people\nare uh i guess consciously aware of\nthemselves\nand what they can do to hold themselves\nand other people accountable\nyeah i did hold i did have like this\nlike big panel\nand one of the people that i invited was\nactually the t.o of genesis\num he goes well like share dactyls like\nonline um\nbut like you know because i think one of\nthe biggest questions obviously like\nyou're asking it right now is like what\ndo we do now and\nit's more than just a matter of like the\nculture like there's a lot of logistics\nuh\num just like objective\npieces that need to move to like make\nthings happen\nand it's a matter it's a question of\nlike who's gonna do it and what exactly\ndoes that entail and like especially\nlike\nyeah whenever tournaments might happen\nyou know that's one of the biggest\nquestion marks\nand like um\nhe did tell us that a lot of the tos\nare in talks or have been in talks of\nmeasures that they can take\nto prevent things like this happening um\nand i think a big a big point though\nthat he wanted to emphasize\nlike i think needs to be emphasized too\nis like it's not going to be perfect\nlike you know\nonce things come back and like\ntournaments are a thing again like it's\nnot like\nyou know oh they're gonna have the\nperfect system figured out it's like the\nlike you know like literally the legal\npolice in our world\nwith all the funding and structure and\ninfrastructure they have like\nthey don't even have things figured out\nyou know and it's it's unreasonable to\nthink that\nit's not going to take a couple of tries\nbut like i said before it's the fact\nthat\npeople are even trying like that's the\ndifference\nand i think especially online too i've\nalready noticed like a difference\nwhere people have been taking a stand\nlike recently\nthere was um there was a really\nquestionable twit longer made about\nsomebody who was ousted\nuh and like it was\nlike people immediately came and like\nyou know what i'm talking about people\nimmediately came and they're just like\nthey're just like [ __ ] on it they're\nlike what are you talking about you know\nand like\nobviously we want to give credence to\nboth sides but it wasn't a case where\nthe accused\nalready admitted and like i said there's\na history of him being very\nlike predatory towards women in general\num which his\nthat person's twit longer just\ncompletely ignored uh\nso like you know that wasn't a thing\nbefore this whole happened like people\nif\nthat twit longer came out like before\nthe whole july\nstuff more people more people definitely\njust be on his side especially because\nhe does have a decent enough following\nso like um there is change that's\nhappening and i think like\njust like how somebody who's like\ncorrecting themselves\nlike they need to keep doing the same\nactions and like create a record of it\nto actually show true change it's the\nsame for the community like we as a\nwhole\nneed to work together to keep\nreinforcing\nthe promises that we that we've made to\nlike the victims of the past and like to\nprevent this for like victims of the\nfuture\nyou know i\nwanted to ask a question actually so you\nknow toph and i did a stream\nabout this i don't know a while ago and\nuh one of the ideas we come up\ncame up with or one of the things we\ntalked about is like how people can be\nisolated\nnot only victims but you know people who\nare\nstarting to who are close to making a\nbig mistake and the question was who can\nthey talk to\nand uh you know i was kind of thinking\nabout the recovery coach program that dr\nk and healthy gamer are putting together\nand like\ndoes anybody think it would be a good\nidea to have like a\nmelee or a smash community like recovery\ncoach\ntype deal where hey i'm i've got a\nproblem i'm a melee player like i don't\nknow who to talk to like\nhave a discord have a place dr k i don't\nknow how recovery coach program\nand the rollout's going but it just\nseems to me that having people more\nconnected to each other and being able\nto talk to somebody\nand it's not uh somebody who's a lawyer\nwho's gonna charge you money or\nyou know a psychiatrist who might not\nactually help in any meaningful way\nbut just somebody you could talk to\nyou know i didn't mean it that way i i\nthought it was funny\ni'm not i'm not offended okay\ni'm laughing because i just need\nsomebody in the community to\nhelp connect people so so that because\nfor me i never hear about this [ __ ] till\nit's way too late i don't know\nand i know that there's people who care\nwho feel that there's nothing they can\ndo because it's always too late\nand i've just been thinking about like\nhow do we get the information to flow\nthe information flow seems to be a big\nproblem in my mind that people could\nhave problems and they just can't get it\nout there\ngo ahead jisoo oh i was i was just\ni was just thinking about it like i want\nto think a little bit more\nbefore i say anything else but i feel\nlike i don't know i feel like dr piggy\nis already\nkind of working on that and along with\nsome other people\num i don't know if that's true or not\ngenerally speaking when when dr k\nasks like what do we do next um\nthat's really hard for me to answer\nbecause i've been the backbone of a lot\nof the code of conduct initiatives and\ni'm getting burnt out guys\ni spent too many nights crying in the\nshower getting\nmessages from abusers i can't i\nit takes a village and we need a village\num\nbut yes i mean that's real talk too\nbecause like i think\nthat was that low tier city you were\nlike you're about to get on commentary\nand you look a little rattled and i came\nup to you and asked you are you good you\nwere telling me a little bit about that\nstuff and i felt bad because like it\nreally\nit really does feel like you're\nshouldering at all when it really does\nit should be\non all of us and not just you so i mean\ni appreciate the work you're doing i\njust want you to know that\nbut i like you know if there's anything\nany way that we\ni could help you directly you know you\ncan always dm me like i'm always around\nyeah and i apologize if it sounds like\ni'm saying oh let's do something you've\nalready been working on\nthe thing i'm talking about is like the\nway to build the village and the\nrecovery coach program just sounds it\njust hit me when it\nyou know when when healthy gamer\nannounced it that like that could be\ncool you know it's like organic and it\ncan spread\nlike whoever wants to get involved can\ncan we help them get involved so that we\nhave a village\nyes if if anyone has any kind of if\nyou're trying to figure out a code of\nconduct initiative for your local scene\nif you're trying to\ncreate a resources page or document\nplease do it there is no monopoly on\nthis\nand and really i you know i talk about\nmy struggles but there have been so many\npeople along the way that have given\ntheir hours of time\nand love um to the code of conduct\nprojects i'm the one that's happened to\nbe here the longest right\nand done it most consistently i suppose\num but whether or not\ni end up continuing with the code of\nconduct work um the one\ngoal i have in the coming months is\ncreating resource\nuh pool right so resources for\ntournament organizers how uh\nhow can you implement your own codes\nwhat are the kind of rules and\ncommitments\nuh what kind of questions do you need to\nask when somebody comes to you with a\nreport\num creating resources for victims so\nlike how can i get\nhow can i see a therapist or like what's\nmy likelihood of being able to\nsue this person or like how can i talk\nto somebody having resources for accused\npeople like\nhow to write an apology or even things\nlike um\nyou know uh therapy for themselves like\nthere are so many\nthings that just weren't talked about in\nsmash community that if if that\ninformation and education were out there\ni think it would do a lot of good um so\ni you know i don't know where i'll be\nbut i do think one of the answer\nis creating consistent structural um\nemphasis and importance on\naccountability\nand how each person in each part of our\ncommunity whether you're a terminal\norganizer or\nor just a player or a top player\nwhatever what\nyou can do and then stick to it you know\nthroughout my work there's been a lot of\npeople that have\nideas they have big dreams and big ideas\nof what to do but the follow through\nis what really makes people it's\neffective\nand makes somebody an amazing person in\nmy eyes is when you follow through on\nthose things right like all this july\nstuff that happened\nthe people that are still out there\nworking god you're my heroes\nyou know you're the ones that that we\nthat\nthat should be elevated um not just\nbecause you're good at the game but\nbecause\nyou committed to protecting people and\nthen you did it like that's so powerful\nwait i have a question for like okay\nwait doesn't melee have like okay so i\ndon't fall ultimate that well i'm like\nmore like mailing\nbut like doesn't it have like that like\ntournament legalization\nlike squad like i remember\nlike when ucf and like you talk about\nlike the five and the 25.\nyeah yeah i'm talking about the five and\ni forget i forget what their name is\nthey're literally\nerased that stuff in my mind it was so\nridiculous\nokay like i was gonna i was gonna say\nlike there is some kind of structure\ngoing on whether it's just like\nliterally facebook messages or whatever\nbut like\nlike i think i feel like just a tangible\nsolution\nwould be like because okay because the\nscene they attack like tournament\nlegal issues so vehemently they'll be\nlike\nyo pokemon stadium and then everyone's\noh like the other pitchforks after like\ni'm so passionate about this you know\nand like i feel like\ninstead of like having like these like\nthe code of conduct or like the 525 i\ndon't know what it is nowadays\nit's always changing but like if if it\ncould all somehow just like come\ntogether\nbecause there is a panel of people who\ndo these things and make decisions\nit's just that it needs like these like\nsexual allegations and like social\nissues need to be brought up on the same\npedestal\nas like oh how many times can mewtwo can\ngrab the ledge\nlike that's just like it's like why why\nare we spending like\n20 [ __ ] years like discussing like\nthat [ __ ]\ninstead of like oh is it bad if we give\nalcohol to a 15 year old it's like\nthe conduct actually did come out of the\nfive\num emily's son emily waves she was like\nhey y'all uh why don't we\ndeal with this issue of harassment and\nthey're like we don't think we that's\nour specialty you should make a a group\nso that's when the harassment task force\nwas formed and then we changed our name\nto code of conduct\nso originally this was part of some like\nbigger initiative and i do\ni am in chats with like the five or\nwhatever but i think they kind of had\nthe same problem that i've been\ndescribing and that the consistency and\nthe follow-through\num of like creating a rule set or or\nyou know a ban recommendation or\nwhatever isn't always there\nso i'm going to take a stab at bobby's\nquestion\nso like does kim coaching help so like i\nthink that the\nthe interesting thing is that you know\nwith a lot of the metoo movement\nlet me just take a step back so i'm\ngoing to say some things that i think\ncould be a little bit controversial\num and so if you guys have any questions\nor you feel like\nit's out of line like please let me know\nso\nhonestly the way i think about this is\nlike lung cancer so if we start with\nsort of the idea like if we think about\nmedicine right so\nyou have a patient who has lung cancer\nlike that's really bad\nand then you have this entire branch of\noncology\nwhich is like okay like chemotherapy and\nradiation and all this kind of stuff\nlike a lot of intensive medicine\njust a really bad situation that's just\nlike ugly\nand when i think about these predators\nas you guys are describing them\ni sort of think about lung cancer um\nand that in and of itself is sort of\nlike a maybe a judgmental image\nmay be fair maybe unfair depending on\nwho you are what you believe whatever\nbut the real interesting thing is like\ndo you guys know\nhow we really\nimproved lung cancer outcomes at least\nin the united states\nuh i did not what are you guys like so\nlung cancer used to be a way worse\nproblem 60 years ago\nthan it is now smoking absolutely\nso here's the really really crazy\nthought which i think a lot of people\ndon't really think about and i think if\nwe really tunnel down\nhugs sort of mention this right it's\nlike we have this idea like there are\nthese people out there and we like\nlabel them as predators this person is a\npredator it's the way that we define\nthem\nit's kind of like this war against like\nthe good people and the bad people\nand hugs when he sort of like realized\noh my god like this is a person that i\nthought was in the good camp\nand now he's in the bad camp and in a\nbizarre way like tk\nactually kind of touched us on this too\nbecause he used to be thirsty\nand then something happened and he grew\nup as he calls it\nso i i here's the way that i think about\nit i think that there\nare a thousand or ten thousand or a\nhundred thousand\npeople who could grow up to be predators\nand for me it started with the question\nlike when was this predator born\nlike this guy who did whatever you did\nto jisoo or or did whatever they did to\nto you piggy like when did this person\nbecome a predator\nbecause like you guys said it's kind of\nlike there's this this long like not\ncrossing the line not crossing the line\nnot crossing the line and they cross the\nline\nright were they a predator at that point\nor were they like a predator before\nwas he a predator the first time he like\nwalked up to jisoo and said hey what's\ngoing on\nwhen is a predator born because i think\nit's okay first of all\nyeah can we i really want to vehemently\ndisagree with the idea that somebody's a\npredator are not a predator\nso somebody's what um that somebody is\nbinary a predator or not\nyeah i know that that's the point i'm\nmaking oh okay cause you're saying that\nlike\nyeah we put these people into buckets\nbut that's not it at all well that's how\nwe talk about them right\nso you guys have used the word predator\nthroughout this entire discussion\nyou've talked about people in a very\njudgmental manner because i mean like\nthat's what that's the language we call\nthese people\npredators but yeah but but so i'm i'm\nwith you\nyeah piggy so like that's sort of like\ncalling someone you know\nschizophrenic this person is a\nschizophrenic\nversus as schizophrenia so there are\nsome people who we define\ntheir personhood by a particular\nattribute of who they are so like\nhomophobic slurs is another good example\nthought is another good example where we\ndefine an entire person\nby one attribute of their being and one\nplace where i see\nvery few people everyone's against using\nyou know the word thought\nor [ __ ] or homophobic slur but when it\ncomes to defining a predator as a\npredator\neveryone's on board you're the in the\nminority piggy\nbecause most people are okay with\ntarring and feathering\nsexual predators which i'm not saying is\ni mean i think it's reasonable in a lot\nof ways\num but i i think the the the issue about\nhow to solve this and where the coaching\nprogram comes in is because i think that\nlike\nyou know i mean i\ncertainly had a lot of feelings that i\nthink like align with being an incel\nwhen i was growing up like\na lot of young male gamers do we were\nsocially awkward couldn't get\ngirlfriends\nsexually frustrated and then like some\nof us grow up and i think some of us\ndon't\nand so what i'm really curious about is\nlike that fork in the road like what's\nthe lung can\nwhat's the smoking in our society that\nleads to the lung cancer\nand so we talk about cultural change\nright but i think that like in my mind\nthere's like there's a 17 year old kid\nout there right now\nwho could one day turn into a sexual\npredator\nand whatever hey i don't want to\ninterrupt but like when i thought about\nthis hey man\nthe people who were doing like they got\ninto the community young so you've got\nyoung men who do not have a lot of\ninteraction with women where they are\n[ __ ] famous and there is booze around\nand like\nyou know what i mean this is a bad\nenvironment\ndo you know what i'm saying like the\nenvironment is going to bring that out\nof people who wouldn't i feel otherwise\ndo it if it wasn't so high risk\nyeah so i i think the the tricky thing\nsorry piggy go ahead\nthe way i think about this is it's i\nthink something similar to you\nimagine a normal distribution a\nbell-shaped curve right and there's\nright down the middle\nuh a line that we draw the average right\nand if you're above that line you're a\npredator if you're below that line\nyou're not right\nand maybe you have\nan entitlement issue where you think\npeople owe you and maybe that puts you\nten percent higher\nand or maybe your mom was sexually\nassaulted when she was young and that's\nwhy that puts you five percent lower\nright\nbut like what are the big like 20 chunks\nthat would put you over the edge right\nbecause we can say culture who our best\nfriend is maybe that's two percent\num personal responsibility should be\nlike a 30\nor something like that but like there\nare risk factors just like\njust like lung cancer that that\nadditively\nor subtractively end up with the binary\nresult\nof does something that hurts other\npeople or doesn't\nright and i think we can go even further\nand say like well if you're in the upper\neighty percent\nat that point that's when you're\nintending to hurt people not just on\naccident and so how does somebody get\nfrom\ndoing it and not realizing the hurt\nthey're causing to like knowing and\ndoing it anyway\nso there's so many underlying factors\nbut i think it is important for us to\nsay like okay so what are the biggest\nones\nyeah so so i think this is where kind of\nbobby's question was about the coaching\nprogram so in my experience so like so i\ni tend to work on an individual level\nright so that's what my day job is\nso i take someone with let's say an\naddiction and they have like all kinds\nof stuff like\nabuse growing up family history of\naddiction\nwhat are like you know struggling\nfinancially whatever\nand and so you all ultimately end up\nwith kind of a unit the short answer is\nthat i i do think bobby that the\ncoaching program can help\nand that's why we started it because i\nthink at the end of the day just like\npiggy is saying\nthere are a thousand different factors i\nthink you guys are we're talking about a\ncouple of them are like no-brainers to\nme so\none thing for example that i noticed\njust like the epidemiologist in me\nnoticed that like 90 of these stories\ninvolve drinking\nand usually a lot of them right so it\nlike\nlike a lot of it is like after parties\nwith like i\nand i think the smash community is in a\nsense a little bit\nof an outlier because i think there's\nway more underage people\nbut if you look at like the dota\ncommunity like i don't think they're a\nbunch of 15 year olds at after parties\nit's like mostly people over the age of\n18 but there's also just a lot about\nthere's a lot of alcohol and that kind\nof comes from the cultural conception\nthat an after party needs to have\nalcohol\nwhich is like a really deep rooted thing\nthe short answer is yeah sorry let me\njust finish up\nif that's okay yeah yeah um so the short\nanswer is that i\ni do think we can help and like this is\nwhat we see so what we see is that when\nwe sort of like\nopen our doors and try to be\nnon-judgmental\nwe do deal with a lot of people who are\nlike in cells\nso we just tossed around the idea\nrecently of starting like an incel group\nbecause i\nwe've tried to get what i call a true\nincel on stream because it's my\nhypothesis that\nan insult is like it's like a it's like\na\na mode that emerges when you're in a\nparticular environment and when you\nactually sit down and you talk to these\npeople\nyou find that they're they're like\nthey're like pretty normal people that\njust\nhave internal struggles that then they\nfind this echo chamber that kind of like\nfans a particular kind of flame\nand like changes the way they think and\nthen they sort of like turn into this\nlike weird wolf which is like a normal\nhuman by day\nlike if you can get them one-on-one and\nactually talk to them you can really\nstart to make a pretty big impact like\nrelatively\neasily and so i do think this is why we\nhave like group coaching we literally\njust this past week talked about\nlike offering particular groups for like\nin cells or other people who are\nstruggling with these things because i\ni think the really other the other thing\nthat we don't really like to think about\nwhen it comes to predators is we don't\ntalk to them right we almost never do\nthat\nbecause i suspect that a lot of these\npeople who get out of line\nactually do so not out of a predatory\ninstinct\nbut out of a positive emotion i think\nthat some of these people\nare so infatuated are so in love or so\nentitled\nthat they think it's okay like most\nhuman beings in my experience\nwhen they commit a sin they don't\ndo it knowing it's a sin they do it\nthinking that they're justified\nand they think that there's some like\nthere's something going on where they're\nlike\nyou know like someone who's unfaithful\nto their partner justifies it because\ntheir partner didn't pay enough\nattention to them it's very what we call\nego syntonic\nthey don't think that they don't view\nwhat they're doing is predatory behavior\nbecause they feel a particular way about\nit and this is where we kind of go back\nto what hugs was saying earlier about\nlike you have to learn how to step out\nof your own shoes and just because you\ndon't think it's a problem\ndoesn't mean it isn't a problem and my\nmy end sort of conclusion is that i\nthink we need to like start\nearly i think we need to work with a lot\nof people probably on an individual or\ngroup level\nand i think it's awesome that we have\nthese large-scale like code of conduct\nkind of measures\nbut i i do think that at some point what\nwe really need to do we're almost at a\nphase where we're like\nyou know 50 years ago addiction was\nconsidered a moral\nproblem and is is like now like more of\na disease\nand working with people like i'm an\naddiction psychiatrist in my day job i\nthink sometimes it is a moral problem\nlike sometimes human beings let like\nthey just act in a very like nasty way\nnot because\nof their addiction like you can be an\naddict and be an [ __ ] too\nand i think sometimes like now it's\ngotten over medicalized to the point\nwhere like people use their addiction as\nan excuse\nwhere i think sometimes like you know\nit's a medical problem absolutely but\nsometimes sort of like\npeople turn it like use that as an\nexcuse which is really bizarre\nand and i think what we've really got to\ndo is like dig into\nyou know why do people do these kinds of\nthings like how do we understand that\nand how do we alter that course\nhow do we get these people when they're\n16 17 18\nin terms of like role models right\nbecause if tk says hey man like don't\nuse that kind of language\nthey'll change like that's one way to do\nit but i do think that a lot of\nindividual work can go a very long way\nin terms of of like if you take this\nperson like an incel\nif you can help them find confidence the\nin-cell behavior just withers away\nin-cell behavior and in my experience a\nlot of toxic\nbehavior is nourished by like negative\nemotion\nit's nourished by feelings of like shame\nlike why do they call you\nthoughts why do they why do they have to\nrefer\nto women as [ __ ] it's because it like\nprotects them in some way because if i\ndehumanize this person\nthen like i don't have to feel like\njudged by that\nthere's a lot of like weird complicated\npsychology that goes into it but the\nshort answer is yes\nand i say that with caution because the\nlast thing that i want to do is is you\nknow bombard our coaches with a bunch of\nwould-be sexual predators um but at the\nsame time i think that you know you guys\ndo what y'all are gonna do healthy\ngamers gonna do what we're gonna do\nwhich is we're gonna try to get into the\nheart of it and talk to people who\nstruggle\nand try to help them see that there's a\ndifferent way to go about doing it\nright that the toxic feelings that you\nhave towards people are ultimately\nlike stem it's my experience that in\ncells for example it comes from heart\nlike they like got hurt by a woman and\nthen they like rage at them\nit's like you know and and and like\nonce you unpack that hurt then like the\ntoxicity will go away i'm not excusing\nthe toxicity in any way shape or form\ni'm just saying that they're you know\nyou can sort of do structural things and\nthen you can also get to the individual\nperson\nand try to help them understand hey man\nlike sure you're behaving like an\n[ __ ] and you should stop but i think\nit's also important to understand\nwhy are you behaving like an [ __ ] in\nthe first place like where does that\ncome from\nbecause once you understand where the\n[ __ ] inside you comes from\nthen you can really start to change it\nspoken like a true clinician\nwell okay i don't know what everyone\nelse is thinking but like\ni've actually thought about this a lot\num\nobviously having gone through it and\nlike\nyou know i i do want to empathize with\nthe other side as much as possible as\npossible because\nyou have to be objective like and i do\nlike to think about\nan individual and like where they came\nfrom like the psychology of like why\nthey do things\num and like i do agree that\nwe should all be approaching it from the\nperspective that like you know i'm not\ngoing to pretend like there aren't\nguys out there who are lonely and are\nhurt and\nthey're taking it out on women you know\nbecause they feel hurt by women i'm not\ngoing to pretend like women are\nperfect and have never done anything to\nhurt men\num that all being said though i feel\nlike\njust with like you coming back to the\nidea of how at least the internet or\njust like the world at large\nis predisposed to give more credence to\nmen like\nfor instance i think the fact that\nyou're even\nyou want to coach these men because you\nwere once in a position\nlike you're saying yourself like them\nand their mindset and mentality like\nthat that is great and like that that is\na measure that needs to be done and it's\nhard and\nlike the amount of thought that you're\nputting into it is like admirable\nbut where is the same side and\ni think that's where i felt so strongly\nabout like and i don't normally like to\ntalk about these things but i felt so\nstrongly i realized i almost have this\nduty to do this\nbecause the same kind of like\nobjective thought isn't put into why\nwomen do the things that they did like a\nlot of times when these stories come out\nlike\nokay so let's say some guy hurt a\ngirl or or some girl hurt a guy growing\nup and then the guy just like hates\nwomen\nokay so that's that's a relatable story\nfor a lot of guys on the internet and\nlike predominantly\nmost people like like on reddit for\ninstance are probably they're probably\nmale or i don't go on reddit that much\nbut like it sounds like they're all like\nmales\nand like they're all gonna agree with\neach other and empathize with that\nmindset right\nand just logistically speaking because\nthere are more males on there\nany mindset or perspective that's not\ntheir mindset\nis gonna get shunned and i think\nthat's kind of i don't have a problem\nwith like\ngiving credence the idea like oh it\nneeds to we need to\nspeak to predators or like i don't even\nlike using the word predators because\nagain i don't think it's binary either i\nthink that\npeople do things people grow up and turn\nout to be one way or another for a\nvariety of reasons\num and like i do agree that every person\nhas their story and the reason why they\ndo stuff\nbut that being said there is a disparity\nfor\nhow women are viewed and how their\noutlooks and perspectives\nare treated and like you can't say\nthat there's the same kind of like um\ni don't know yeah like there's just\nthere's not the same level of empathy\ngiven and i\nhave to say i think it just be it's\nbecause the internet is predisposed\nto mostly just be of like a male mindset\num and like i think at least in the case\nwhere like\nlike in the smash community and you'll\nsee this at the world at large too like\ndo you think\ndo you think epstein didn't know what he\nwas doing do you think\nthese people like you know you said that\noh this person\nmaybe they weren't aware i think that's\ntrue for the average person i think\nthat's true for most people\nlike the bell curve for like people who\ndo bad things is like the majority of\nthem like yeah they\nthey're not aware and as soon as you\ncoach them or really teach them\num like what what their actions mean\nthey'll get it\nbut there are there are the outliers and\nthese are typically the people who\nonce they get in power they abuse it you\nknow because they're they're waiting in\nsociety\nto finally have their chance to abuse\ntheir power and get away with it you\nknow and that's\nthat's kind of what we saw in smash\nbecause like i said once they were held\naccountable\nthey they ran away from it and like i\nthink\ni think setting the example is also so\nimportant because\nlike in the real world a lot of guys get\naway with stuff just because\nthey they're not they don't they're not\npenalized for it like who's that one guy\nthat brock dude who like literally like\nlike like turner yeah brock turner he\nliterally like drugged this girl and\nlike raped her and like\nlike he only faced like six months in\nprison or something crazy whereas\nthere's like people\nwho are like dealing weed or [ __ ] and\ngetting like years in jail it's like\nthat what the disparity is so bad\nand like that the precedent that that\nsets is like so\nhorrible and like if we're gonna go in\nhere and be like\nokay we need to give credence to the\nidea that like predators aren't\npredators it's like okay the same thing\nneeds to be said then for like the women\nand the disenfranchised like people and\nlike that\nyou know everything so i'm not trying to\ndiscredit anything that you just said i\njust think that\nit needs to be said that there are other\nperspectives out there and that\nthis disparity is real yeah absolutely\nlike the idea of a perfect victim the\nfact that the woman had to do x\ny and z for us to support or believe her\nlike that's what that's what i'm\ni wish people understood it's like there\nis no such thing as a perfect victim\nwe should we can empathize and try to\nchange predators but at the same time we\ncan empathize with women who didn't do\nexactly xyz when they were\nuh victimized like so so let me just\ni feel like i want to respond to that is\nthat okay jisoo\nyep so it's it's a great point right so\nthe first thing that i have to\nunderstand is that like when i speak i'm\ncoming from a male\nperspective which is gonna def by\ndefinition have some bias\nright the second thing\nis you know you know where i got this\nidea\nactually a panel of female gamers\nso like we started with women so we\nstarted actually by like talking to\nwomen about what's your experience\nlike being a woman in gaming what's your\nexperience like\ndealing with toxicity in video games and\nthen we had a second panel\nbefore we have yet to have a panel with\ninsults second panel about\nlike women sharing their experiences of\nlike rando dudes falling in love with\nthem over the internet\nfascinating panel right so i absolutely\nthink that this is a group of people\nlike\nit's a psychological burden\nthat the average by average i mean male\nlike person on the internet has no idea\nthat you guys just live in a different\nworld where you can't go into a game\nand just use [ __ ] voice chat because\npeople will send you pictures of their\npenis afterward\nit's just a completely different world\nand so like\nwe had these two panels of women which\nwere mind-blowing to me just to hear\nwhat the experiences of these people are\nlike that's what we're dedicated to\nto ex like like sort of leveling this\nplaying field\neducating the masses about what it's\nlike to be a minority in gaming\nand what you guys have to deal with and\ndoing so in a way that hopefully the\npeople aren't watching aren't like who\nthought you know it's it's like it's a\nreally genuine perspective\nit's no one's looking for clout or fame\nor anything you can't even make that\nargument it's just someone coming on and\nsharing their experience\nand the crazy thing is that through\nthose two conversations\ni was surprised because i asked the\nwomen i was like let me ask you\ni use guys so that also like tk i was i\ngrew up with a particular\nuh you know vocabulary that could be\noffensive\nbut i asked i was like what do you guys\nlike it sounds to me like\nyou know there's there's a lot that we\ndon't understand about like what's\nhappening on the other side\nand and i asked them i was like would\nyou would y'all like to see\na panel of the people who do the [ __ ] to\nyou\nthat like the people on the other side\nof the dm\nwould you guys like to understand what\ntheir perspective is i was stunned by\ntheir response which was like\noverwhelmingly yes\nbecause i think this this whole dynamic\nlike i think absolutely we just need to\nlook\nat the whole thing the perspectives and\nexperiences of women\nbeing not shared and unknown is half of\nwhat propagates the problem\nbecause like the people who send you dms\nthey don't conceptualize of you as a\nhuman being that's a huge [ __ ]\nproblem\nright and so like we absolutely need to\nand this kind of goes back to females\nversus women we just don't\nconceptualize y'all as as like humans\nand as long as that that's the first\nthing that needs to change\nis that we're all humans and my sense in\nmy experience has been the more that we\nstart\ntreating people like human beings in\ngeneral whether you've [ __ ] up or you\nhaven't [ __ ] up whether\nyou're a victim or you the better off\nwe're gonna be\nand i'm not trying to in any way shape\nor form excuse the behavior of sexual\npredators because like i said\nyou know cancer is cancer and like once\nyou get to that point\nyou know that needs to be excised but i\nthink if we really want to if we want to\nreduce the number of cases\nthat piggy is getting overwhelmed with\nfrom 250 to 25\nwe have to stop smoking\nthat's how you really beat cancer and i\ndon't know how much of that analogy\napplies to this situation i'm not sure\nright that's where like i i don't know\nbut like when i look at\nbig scale advances an ounce of\nprevention\nis worth a pound of cure\ni mean it sounds to me like what i was\npart of what i'm hearing is that we want\na better nuanced understanding\nof people who become born predators and\na more nuanced understanding of people\nwho are victims\nuh absolutely because here's starting\nthere because we don't know what it\nlooks like you don't know if you're\nsmoking a cigarette you know in this\ndimension and we don't know like you\nknow you can't see somebody and say oh\nthey're smoking but the better we\nunderstand what\na vic you know with nuance and empathy\nwhat it's like to be a victim early on\nand what it's like to become\nsomeone with the predatory behavior then\nthe better we can help\nbetter people can self-identify does\nthat sound like part of go ahead dr k\nyeah i mean i was just because i think\nwhat we need to understand is like how\ntk grew up\nlike we absolutely need to understand\nthe perspective of women and victims\ndon't get me wrong and that's why\nlike you know we've spent more time i\nmean i wasn't even saying any of this\nuntil bobby asked the question i think\nthe most important thing for me that\ncome out of this discussion\nis for young people to be aware of what\na predator looks like\nthat's what my emphasis was the one goal\nthat i wanted is like\nif you're a 16 year old gamer male\nfemale whatever\nwhat are the signs that you're being\nmanipulated because that's\nreally the most important thing and then\nin terms of how coaching fits in i think\nthat's sort of the separate issue of\nlike\nunderstanding you know how do you grow\nup\nlike that's what healthy gamer is about\nwe're trying to teach a generation of\npeople like how to grow up\nlike what are the chant what are the\nchallenges that we face\nand how do we overcome them grow up\nsounds good\nbut i think my only uh my only like\nobservation from all this has been like\nbasically um i feel the way that a lot\nof these people get into the position\nthey are the\nhow the predator is born the answer for\na lot of them is that like\nyou know in high school or wherever\ntheir early years were they weren't\npopular you know saying like they\nweren't\nthey didn't get you know uh women's\nattention\nthey didn't have girlfriends whatever so\nthen they end up getting popular\nin this realm and it's like a new start\nfor them you know i'm saying like\nthey they were never like those big\nstreamers who end up having like\nallegations with most women because like\nnow they're getting attention\nfrom women those you know the big um\nthe big name top players commentators\nwho\nare like you know also getting um\nissues against them from multiple women\nbecause i feel like in their earlier\ndays they're like\nthey were nothing they weren't [ __ ] you\nknow what i'm saying and now they're\ntrying to like make up for it\nand in this time or they don't know what\nto do with this\npower if you will uh and it gets to\ntheir head\nand i think like that's not an issue\nthat\nwe can fix after it's already happened\nthat's the issue that they have to\ngo about wanting to fix i've had this\nconversation with\num like i don't want to use names but i\nhad this conversation with a fellow\ncommentator\nwho i felt like you know as i started to\ngrow up and\nget less about chasing skirts and more\nabout like you know just\nbeing i guess an adult or whatever or\ntrying to like settle down or whatever\nhe didn't and he was older than me and i\nwas like do you not notice that like\nthis may be an issue\nbecause like i'm now 31 and you're\nyou know you're you're two three years\nolder than me and you're still like\nacting like we're 25 26\nor not even then more like 23\nuh so you know i think that that\none thing that changed comes from you\nbut\nuh if you're only changing because\nsomeone else is pointed out to you and\nyou're\nchanging because like oh i need to\nchange to appear like i'm better\nthen you're not really changing again\nlike that's more so just you know\na wolf of sheep's clothing type deal i\nthink genuinely wanting to change\nbecause you realizing\nthe error of your ways uh ends up coming\ndown to the person i\njust don't know how to get them to reach\nthat you know if they don't reach it on\nthem on themselves i don't know how to\nlike egg someone on to be like yo bro\nlike\nthis is an issue and i think this is\nsomething that you should address\nyeah i mean i think tk that's a great\npoint and i'll i'll give you guys the\nlast word in a second but i think that's\nexactly why\nlike when people come on and share their\nstories\nit's really easy to think that you're\nnot doing anything wrong if the person\non the other side of the table\nisn't a real human being\nright and like that's the toxicity of\nthe internet\nright it's like does it like\nthey're females that's the basicity of\nhuman\nsocial thought sure um we use heuristics\nto judge things\nbecause it's easier and it can protect\nus but in the end that those heuristics\ncan also\ncause enormous pain and harm and that's\nwhy i think like like\ni think it's awesome that women are\ncoming forward because like we need to\nhear your perspective like you need to\nstop like you know i think it's really\npowerful when\nwhen we when we see an individual as a\nperson\nit starts to break down\nlike the conceptions like when you start\nto see the shades of grey and stuff like\nthat and that's why i really appreciate\nlike\npiggy and juicy sharing their stories\nbecause i think in this moment\nyou know for people who are watching\nit's hard to just\ncall you like a female because like\nyou're a human being with a full array\nof like thoughts and emotions\nand feelings and experiences and and the\nmore\nhuman you are and the more you share\nthat experience i think that's\nultimately what causes people to learn\nso thank you guys all for coming on\nshare and share but i don't think it\nshould be a requirement for us to air\nour trauma\njust to be seen as people right\nyeah so so i don't think you have to\nshare your trauma\nbut i think when we any kind of\nauthentic sharing it just happens to be\nthat we're talking about a traumatic\nexperience today\nbut i think any time you're right i\ndon't think you should air your trauma\nto be seen as a human being\nbut i think part of part of what we do\nas an organization is we\ntake the parts that have not been shared\nin the past and we try to bring them to\nlife\nbecause i think personally that's where\na lot of growth is that's how we try to\nfight stigma\nthat it's okay like if you're a victim\nyou're not\na less normal human being you're a\nvaluable human being\nyou know you should be treated with\nrespect that your trauma and\nand this is where you're right that you\nshouldn't need to share trauma to become\na person\nin my experience part of the reason that\nwe try to share trauma is because some\npeople this is really sad but\nsome people who experience trauma don't\nfeel like a human being\nand and when when you share it when you\nbring it out into the open\nit like has less power over you\nand i think what we saw today like even\nlistening to hugs right like so\ni mean here's his experience of being\nbetrayed by a friend\nand like that's i think what gets people\nto like look at themselves\nand it comes back to tk's question of\nyou have to want to change from the\ninside\nin my experience when you show yourself\nwhen you authentically represent\nyourself\nto the rest of the world that's what\nprompts change\nbut yeah it's it's with you guys anyway\nclosing thoughts\num i've been you know i've been kind of\nmulling over what\nlike we can do because i mean this is\nthis is one of many issues i feel like\nthe smash community has that are now\ncoming up\nto light i think that uh\nit's a good one to start with but\nthere's so much we have to tackle that i\nfeel like it's it's\nalmost an impossible hill to climb you\nknow like there's\nit goes further than just like uh the\nsexual assault in\nrape and and sexual misconduct just in\ngeneral\nbut it goes as far as to just general\nlike bullying\nof people in in online in chats all the\ntime just\njust people uh dehumanizing i feel like\nthe people that they are supposed to\nlove uh\nbecause they're locked behind computer\nscreens and stuff like that there's like\nthere's so many\ninteresting uh dynamics that need to be\nfixed\nuh within the spanish community i don't\nknow like how we could do it but i know\nthat my first step\nis to believe that like we can promote\nchange by being\nsaid and changed by by following\nby practicing what we preach by\nfollowing our own set of uh\nyou know code of conducts i guess that\nare\nmorally sound and things like that the\ni feel like in in smash community like\nthe celebrity\nof things is like really like this is a\nvery like celebrity type community like\nwhere people are like\nhuge followers of top players top\ncommentators and things like that\ni don't really see that happen uh too\noften in other uh fighting games or just\nin games in general outside of like\nmaybe like league and like\noverwatch because they're like backed by\nthe big companies but for a grassroot\ngame\nto have a multiple people over 100 uh k\nfollowers and stuff\nis actually crazy to me so uh with\nthose big followings i feel like being\nlike showing\nleading by example and showing that like\nuh\nyou have changed behavior that you do\nnot accept in cell type behavior\nuh is a great thing and that's one big\navenue\nin a way that we can push for change in\nthe future in my opinion\nand for me if something i've been\nthinking about a lot is like what is\nwhat are we explicitly preaching\nyou know tk because like i want to\nbelieve too that we can model\nuh this good behavior and that that'll\ncatch fire and that things can get a lot\nbetter\nuh and the more i think about it the\nmore i think that\nfor me what i want to preach and what i\nwant to practice is that anybody who\ncares about the game\nis you know i'll define them as a member\nof the community in some capacity\nand for me i feel that people who like\ndon't hurt other people in the community\npeople who\ncare about other people having being\nsafe like that's kind of the bar\nwe need to uh hold ourselves each and\nevery one of us accountable to\nthat's like in my mind if we can all\nfeel accountable for\nother community members having like you\nknow not being in danger basically\nthen a lot can change but as long as we\ndon't feel responsible for that you know\nor that there's discussion about\nlike that's kind of what i would love to\npull out by the root kind of ask people\nif\nif they care about other people having\nuh being able to play melee safely\nbecause for me i've never heard anybody\nsay that they don't care about that\ni don't think anybody can say that with\na straight face that like oh no i don't\ngive a [ __ ] about other people playing\nthe game safely like that's not on me\nright i feel like\njust like i don't want to like\nderail things too hard but i'm like\nreading the chat and just like you know\neveryone\nbrings up really good points like oh\nthis is just a worldwide issue or this\nhas a lot to do with like\num you know just general sexism or like\nuh\nabuse in general and just other other\npsychological things\nand like i think all those points are\nreally true which is why it's really\nhard to have panels like these and talk\nabout it in a really\ndirect uh concise way because it is\nnuanced like i'm not\nlike you know like dr k said\nguys do grow up with a different\nperspective and especially if you\ngrow up being an outcast in a certain\nway that comes with its own problems\nthat like i\nprobably will never be able to\nunderstand but like i think\nreal change comes from you take when\npeople in like their smaller communities\ndo what they can in their smaller pools\nand attack issues one by one\nbecause you can't attack everything in\nthe world all at once like i can't\nattack how\ndisenfranchised people get like jailed\nfor unreasonable amounts of time like\nthat's not\nmy battle to fight probably and there\nare there already are people fighting\nfor it\nand like i know that what i can do is\nhelp other women or victims or people\nwho have gone through the things that i\nidentify with personally because\ni know what it's like to go through that\nand i can help them best with something\nthat i know\nand i think that goes for anybody else\nin the chat or people who are viewing\nlike if you're watching this you're like\nwhat can i do\nand like you know i know all these other\nfactors go into it but how do we like\nattack these things like one by one and\nit's like it is a one by one process and\nit just starts with like\none thing that you're passionate about\num and i think i think\nto me that's like the biggest giveaway\nor takeaway i'd want to\nspeak out to everybody\nyeah she finds you so some time ago we\nstarted a special section of our discord\nfor women\njust because you know they do have a\ndifferent experience and even on our\ndiscord they were getting\nharassed and stuff and then you know\nwe got a lot of criticism for that\nbecause a lot of people were like\nwhere's the men's space\nthere's a women's space where's the\nmen's space and and now\neverywhere and now now i have the answer\nwhich is sorry guys\ni'm a sipcock see ya\ni think it's a very powerful answer\nlet's chat\nanyways okay\nsorry bobby you were like saying\nsomething i i like don't know if i\ninterrupted that\nno no you didn't that was my last word\nwas just that like if we\nif we can believe that we want to create\na space where people can\nplay the game without being harassed\nthat's a low bar\nand then i think that i think we could\ndo a much better job if we\nsay that we want to hold it up because\ntk mentioned this earlier right\nyou can't take responsibility for\nchanging another person i can't go in\nanybody else's\nbeing and change them but we can't we\ncan do more than nothing\nand i think for each of us if we know\nwhere that line is which is\ni hope that we can like have real homie\ntalks with people who are\nlooking like they're in a bad spot and\nthat we can stop\nyou know bad things from being born into\nthe world in the first place and that\nwould be great but\nyeah i guess like having our eyes open\nand knowing that we're trying to help\nmake the space\nsafe for everybody that would be really\ngood\nthat was all that i had to say and also\nthanks dr k for having us here and\nthanks to everybody\nthank you guys for of course the\neverybody else here i guess\nmy last thought would be uh that i\nreally\ndo hope that the smash community bounces\nback\nand learns from everything that has\nhappened i think i'm i'm hopeful and i\nthink that we will\nat least be going in a much better\ndirection from here on out\nand also thanks to everyone here for\neverything that you do\nuh using your influence to\nforce change or help towards change\nespecially\nyou piggy we've talked about a lot of\nthis stuff and you\ndo a crazy amount of work that i think\ngoes under appreciated so i will always\nhave your back\nand i will make sure that people uh put\nsome respect on your name and all the\nwork that you do so\nreally appreciate what you're doing\ndon't make me cry on stream\nmy closing thoughts are please get\ninvolved with your local scenes\nplease um uh ask your tos about\nbands um or or help organize or\nsomething\num if you've lost hope i understand\nuh and you are not required to stay in\nsmash\nbut if you are please\nit matters what you do and say i think\nthat's another takeaway message of all\nthis\num and use what you've got whether it's\ncloud\nquote or or just energy and time or\npassion\nuh or or personal experience\noh also wait i i know okay people are\nviewing the smash community like we're\nlike\na bunch of like freaks after this\nunderstandably so\nall right there's a lot of cool people\nlike if you go to a tournament\nat least you know you can start with any\nof the like\nfive people here dr k if you roll\nthrough you know you can\ntalk to him too like we're not most of\nus aren't like this it's just\nlike literally like like the few\nthey just like all these articles aired\naround and now there's just like all\nthis [ __ ] but smash is a really dope\ngame\num and like the scene is super cool and\nlike there's a lot of good\ngood sides to it too so yeah just you're\ngonna throw that out\ni i think it's out there because we care\nwe are trying to change\nwhere um when when these things get\nblown up\nit's it's more because we're okay with\nrooting it out even if it makes\nthe community look especially\ncrazy but i i assure you that um\nit's just us working on a lot of things\npublicly\nand um yeah uh there are a lot of good\npeople in the scene so\nyeah i mean jesus just as someone who's\nnot a member of the community\ni think you guys sound awesome it sounds\nvery tight-knit\nvery caring very welcoming\nlike if you want to if you want to see\nreal [ __ ] communities like go check\nout dota or wall like ho\nyou know it's it's yeah i mean you all\nsound great\nit makes me want to like attend a smash\ntournament just to like check it out see\nlike\ncheck it out check it out i recommend it\nlike seriously\nno i think he's coming out soon i i\nthink there's a\ny'all are a ringing endorsement for the\ncommunity seriously i think it's awesome\nso thank you guys
