    "transcript": "when your thoughts are not reality\nthey're just thoughts\nand the way that you create that\nseparation is through observation\nnot trying to fix it because fixing it\nis getting into it\nnice is it's connor yes nice to meet you\nconnor i'm all locker or dr k\nwhatever you prefer right i've watched a\nlot of your stuff i know okay\num yeah so tell me man how how are you\ndoing today\ni'm doing good i'm doing good i was a\nlittle bit nervous\nfor a while i know i talked for a couple\nmonths about coming on okay but i wanted\nto wait until like i\nknew i could like talk about something i\nfeel like could help a lot of people\nawesome dude thank you very much\nyeah because i have a pretty complex\ncase and a lot of history of like\ngoing through different kinds of therapy\nand different kinds of help trying to\nfigure out what's going on\nokay um so i wanted to help provide some\ninsight on that for people hopefully\nokay awesome dude that's that's actually\nreally awesome of you and i i think very\nkind of you\num and to also think a little bit about\nyou know a lot of people feel like\nthey share problems with other people\nbut i think it's really thoughtful\nto spend some time until you're ready\nyou know to sort of talk about things in\na productive way which is really cool\nyeah i think something that i've learned\nis that like\nwith all that i've dealt with is like\nthe way i see mental health issues is\nit's really hard for me to put labels on\nspecific things like i might be\ndiagnosed with like depression\nanxiety ocd all this stuff over the\nyears um\nbut i feel it just manifests in\ndifferent ways in different people it's\nlike even put a label on something is so\nlike\nand then like be like for this issue you\nneed this medication or this kind of\ntreatment like\nover the years i've gone beyond that and\nthought like you know\nit can work different for different\npeople that's awesome man i i'd love to\nhear more about that\num do you want to just tell us a little\nbit about what your journey has been\nlike or\ni mean where where how do we start yeah\ni mean um\nso i mean i started streaming on twitch\nuh in high school\num but that was after all this had\nstarted so in like\nseventh or eighth grade i was doing\ngreat i was super social\nsuper happy it was never down i was\ni was always doing great and then around\nlike\nend of middle school early high school i\nhad\nbegan to develop really bad anxiety um\nand like a lack of motivation\nto go to school a lot of the time um\nand i couldn't really pinpoint whether\nthat wasn't like social anxiety whether\nthat was depression what it was\nbut it was uh really difficult the time\nto deal with um\nand my family was concerned because i\nwasn't going to class um\nand as a couple questions about that\nyeah what do you mean by anxiety\ni would wake up in the morning and just\nhave like a pit in my stomach\nabout even getting up and getting out of\nbed to go to school\nand i couldn't exactly pinpoint why\nthere were it was felt like a million\nreasons all at once\nlike my brain was moving so fast i\ncouldn't even uh\nunderstand why i didn't want to go i\njust knew i didn't okay\num that's something like as i've begun\nto understand anxiety it's\nuh i can pinpoint that feeling\nand get what it is because at the time i\ndidn't really know\ni could just kind of blame anything on\nanxiety okay um\nand then as i got through high school um\neverything got progressively worse\npretty much throughout the years and\nthat's when i started streaming was to\nkind of get an escape from it um when\nyou say\neverything got worse what does that mean\nwhat is that like i would\nnot be involved in as many social events\ni would\nbe kind of to myself a lot a lot of my\nfriends would be concerned but i'd be\nyou know i'm fine i'm fine i'm okay um\ndid you feel okay\nno not at all i felt terrible all the\ntime um i was very depressed\ni was very anxious all the time what\ndoes depressed mean\nno motivation and just a complete lack\nof feeling\nand then if i do feel something it\npretty much always finds a way to\nmanifest itself with sadness\num it sounds rough man\nno yeah it was it was really isolating\nyeah so then um as i kept going through\nhigh school um i did so many different\nkinds of therapy\nto try to get help different kinds of\nmedication i've probably been on 10\ndifferent\nkinds of medication being an ssri at one\npoint we thought it might be\nbecause of adhd so you know vivint stuff\nlike that or\nanything to like a stimulant um did that\ni did anxiety meds um\ni had all that then i did different\ntherapies so uh\ncbt which i still do i have a therapist\nthat i still work with here and there\nmainly because i'm really close to them\num\ni i don't really get too much out of it\nanymore i think but\ni still do enjoy it like that talking\ntime\num i did that i did exposure based\ntherapy last year\ni've done dbt which i think is like\nforget how to describe it that was like\nsome like clicking thing\nyou know what that is it's not my\nunderstanding of dbt but\nthere is wait which one is hold on i\nhave a couple there's\ni had a there was one oh emdr that's\nwhat it is\nyeah i did that and then dbt as well\num so i've gone through a couple\ndifferent things\njust to try to figure stuff out over the\nyears and nothing ever really seemed to\nclick too much\num uh once i started getting\nthrough high school um with\nrelationships specifically\ni would be extremely anxious and\nextremely overwhelmed with emotion\nand relationships be it friends and\nespecially like romantic relationships\nlike i would um\njust overthink everything it would\nconsume me every day\num i mean there was a time in high\nschool where like before i even could go\non a date\nlike i would have to like get there\nearly to throw up in the bathroom\nbefore even i'd be so nervous and\nanxious\num and a lot of that stems from a really\nnegative self-image i developed for\nmyself\nover the years dealing with that um\nthe negative self-image developed from\nthat\nor cause it's i it's kind of like what\ncame first the chicken or the egg i\nguess i guess like\nin um i remember like before i dealt\nwith all this i really was happy with\nmyself\nand i wasn't down about all the time but\nthen as things got worse it felt like\nany\nnegative situation in my life i would\nview myself so negatively\nand blame it on me um so especially with\nrelationships uh\nit became any time i was interested in\nsomebody it became like a case of\nlimerence\nso that is when um so there's like\nromantic love but then there's like\nlimerence which is romantic love but\nlike you require\nso much reassurance all the time because\ni'm constantly questioning myself\nand the relationship so i'm constantly\nneeding that reassurance for myself\nand it would just become so destructive\nin relationships\num because i just be like thinking\npeople hate me people are lying to me\nand all this stuff and\nit was very difficult um and so around\nthen that's when i got diagnosed with\nocd\nand looking back on like my childhood it\nmade a lot more sense because\nas a kid i would do a lot of ocd\ntendencies\num and my mom's friend is a\nis a what is it\nlike a children's behavioral therapist\nand when i was a kid she thought i had\nocd as well just because of\nhow i would tap things when i leave and\ni'd have freakout attacks over\nthe most mundane things connor how are\nyou feeling right now\nright now um i'm good i'm just trying to\nmake sure i cover everything\nokay so i want to pause for a second is\nthat okay\nso i'm noticing like a slight tremor in\nyour voice\num i don't know if it's discord but i\nkind of like notice you almost\num shaking a little bit are you oh i sh\nyeah i\nshake all the time regardless i don't\neven know if that's\nuh yeah i i've always been shaking for a\nlong time my chat will actually make fun\nof me\nand be like whenever i show my hands on\nstream they'll say like earthquake\nor something because like i'm just\nalways shaking\nokay um well i it was my discrete\nimpression that you were not doing that\nat the beginning of our call\nso i don't know if it just fluctuates\nwith time or it might just be because\ni'm really\nthinking deeply and trying to like dive\nback into things that i don't usually\nthink about okay um because i kind of\nsuppress a lot of this\ni think especially now i'm doing better\num okay\nyeah sorry i derailed you i just wanted\nto check no you're good you're good okay\ni was i'm just trying to remember\neverything and so you get the timeline\nthat someone close to your family uh\nthought that you had ocd growing up\nbecause you used to tap things\nyeah that and just other like uh\nbehaviors that i can't totally remember\nright now but it was when i was a kid\num so then uh after going through the\nproper\nchannels i got diagnosed officially with\nocd specifically rscd\nrelationship-based ocd where it was it\ndoesn't really\nit's not really as much physical as it\nis social and mental\num you know reassurance different things\nstuff like that\num that became a bit of an issue\nand so then it was like i had so much\ndiagnose for me that i was like i don't\neven know what to tackle like i was just\nlike sure\nlike what do i do like do i take a\nmedication for this do i tackle this\nis there i know you talk a lot about\nlike uh root causes and like looking\nback\nso i was like well was there like a\ntrauma or something and i couldn't\npinpoint anything\num so yeah i did a lot over the years\num the most helpful thing was last year\nwhen i did\nuh exposure-based therapy i went to a\nplace in florida\nfor the summer got an apartment and\nstayed over there\nand got help for that over the summer\nand that that was the most helpful thing\nbut it still didn't like fully\nfeel like fix my issues the way i wanted\nlike\nbecause my biggest thing was i always\nfelt like i wasn't i felt like i wasn't\nmyself a lot\nlike when i stream and i was like behind\nthe computer\ni felt like i was being me and i was\nlike this is\nlike i'm me again this was my escape and\nthen whenever i would go out\nand like my escape from the constant\nanxiety and the\nsocial issues that i was facing and then\nwhenever i'd\ngo off stream i'd instantly kind of go\ninto like a shell again\nand sort of fall back into anxiety or\ndepression or other things\num so that was originally why i started\nis it was the only way i could really\nget away from that\nit's interesting because you use the\nword escape but i'm not hearing\nactually that it was an escape i'm\nhearing that\nyour truest sense of reality is actually\nwhen you're streaming\nyeah yeah\nit's interesting because people will\nprobably look at streaming in like i i\ncan imagine that mental health\nprofessionals may call that an escape is\nsocietally we sort of\nyou know call gaming and and streaming\nand computers and all that kind of stuff\nlike escapes from real life but i think\nactually what's really bizarre is that\nsometimes we can be our truest selves\nthrough the internet yeah and that's\nwhen we don't have to worry about\njudgment from other people based on what\nwe look like or what our ethnicity is or\nwhat our sexuality is we can just be\nourselves\nkind of interested in that that was i\nhad such a negative view of myself\num that to have that kind of\nplatform where i felt like there was no\npreconceived notion of like what i\nlooked like\nor who i was it was a much easier way to\ntap into that side of myself\num so once i started doing that\nthat was always something i look forward\nto each day so i don't know how i would\nhave gone through stuff without it\num and then\ni guess the thing now is like\nover the past year like i mean i used to\nstream like maybe five to ten people\nand then in the past year and a half\nthat's gone up to like two thousand\nso it's it's just absolutely exploded\nand now like i've got a crew out of this\ni don't need\nlike i didn't know what i was gonna do\nin college and now i'm like\nfocused on this and i'm really happy um\nbut now it becomes kind of\nthe voice in the back of my head is well\nwhere would you be if that didn't happen\nlike i don't really know what i'd be\ndoing\num it almost is like well i'm feeling\nbetter but is that because of the\ncircumstances around me\nor is that because i'm actually better\nit's one of those things that i've\nstruggled with lately sure\ni can almost hear like some sense of\nlike fear there\nyeah there is there's there's like if\nall this\ncollapsed in a day like if suddenly i\ncouldn't strain anymore something\nhappened or\nwhatever like what would i do um\nand would i would i go right back to\nthat dark spot i was in in high school\nyeah it's kind of interesting because\nyou know when we start to feel better\nand if you're thinking about like\ncircumstances like if i'm better because\ni have more viewers the the really scary\npart about that is doesn't really mean\nyou're better at all\nit just means that you know there's some\ncircumstance in your life that's kind of\npropping you up\nand if someone takes that away they take\naway all your progress\nyeah i wouldn't say it was the viewer\naccount specifically it was more just\nlike\nhaving a career out of it sure where\nlike where i\nknew i didn't have to pursue college\nimmediately or stuff like that because i\nwent to college for\ntwo semesters um once i got out of high\nschool i\nthe only reason i enrolled was because i\nknew if i saw all my friends go off to\ncollege\nand i was doing nothing still and still\ndealing with what i was dealing with i\nwould just be even more depressed yep so\nit's like\nokay i'm going to enroll and at least do\nlike two or three classes just to be a\npart of something\nto get my brain out there but i mean i\nhated it like\nit was still school for me and i could\nnot find motivation to do any work um\nit just wasn't my my place conor can i\nthink for a second\nare there other things other parts of\nthe story that you want to tell\num or is that a pretty good summary it's\na pretty good summary for the most part\ni mean if something comes up later on i\ncan try to\nsure so that that's why because i\nthought it was a fantastic\nsummary um thank you and so i just want\nto\npause for a second and think about all\nthe different directions we could take\nthis\nall right\nokay so i've got a couple of\nuh options okay can you let me know what\nyou think would be helpful\nso one thing that we could talk about is\njust your experience\nof like what it's like to be in mental\nhealth treatment\nit sounds to me like you've tried a lot\nof stuff you've actually worked really\nhard you've been on medications you've\ntried all these different kinds of\ntherapy\nyou've gotten lots of different\ndiagnoses just what how can we sort of\nlike think about that and understand\nthat like\nwhat's going on like what's helpful what\nisn't helpful what's it been like to\nget labeled with all these different\nthings\nwhat's been useful about all this if\nanything\num so we could sort of talk a little bit\nmore about mental health in your journey\nthrough\ndiagnoses and things like that kind of\nrelated to that we could try to\nunderstand like what\nocd is and like sort of how it works and\nhow we understand ocd from a mental\nhealth perspective\nanother thing that we could try to do is\nsort of think a little bit about like\nthe root cause\nright so you've tried lots of different\ntherapies and things like that and you\nmentioned things like\nviewing yourself negatively and your\nmind sort of overthinking and\nyou're being consumed by your thoughts\num and we can try to really sort of\nfigure out like\nas you mentioned there's something that\ntranscends\ndiagnosis right there's some kind of\nlike basic\nsuffering i'm just going to call it\nsuffering\nbut it may be like a way that you view\nyourself or it may be uh\nthe way that your mind works which if\nyou talk to a half a dozen mental health\nprofessionals they're gonna call it\ndifferent things\nbut for you the experience has always\nbeen one thing\neven though your diagnosis may have\nchanged from year to year it's not like\nyou randomly got a different like\nyou started with anxiety then you\nrandomly got depression one year later\nand then randomly gone\nrocd it's always been that one thing\nso what is that thing and how can we\nunderstand it\nyeah another option yeah go ahead\ni was going to say i like that one so\nfar because i feel like okay that's\nsomething that would help me\nokay so the other thing to think about\nis that you know sometimes when we think\nabout fixing a problem\nwe can think about the root and we can\nalso think about\nwhat's above ground so how we can sort\nof think a little bit about how your\nmind\nfunctions in the present so what is the\nnature\nof your obsessional thoughts where do\nobsessional thoughts come from why do\nthey come\nwhy do they come when they do like sort\nof almost like a\nyou know if we were to like open up your\nmind in the here and now and look at\nits function you know yeah that's\nactually\nthat's something that i've been doing a\nlot more lately having watched you\nis uh think more presently yeah um\nand like look into like not like i like\nbecome a stoic but look into like\nstoicism kind of\nthoughts and uh philosophy and all that\nwhich helped me so i think a lot of\ntimes especially in\nin psychiatry we kind of focus on the\npast but i think from if you look at the\nmeditative approach which is a lot like\nstoicism\nyou know your thoughts there is a rhyme\nand reason to why\nyou have the thoughts that you do your\nmind ultimately like case in point\nyou used to need to go to dates early\nbecause you would need to vomit in the\nbathroom ahead of time\nand that certainly sounds awful but if\nwe stop and think about it there's\nactually like a science behind that\nthere's a predictive response like you\nknow what's going to happen\nand then you plan for it which tells us\nthat there's actually some\norder to like what's going on in your\nmind\neven though it like really sucks and\nthere may be value and forget about like\nwhere this comes from or if it's some\ndeep rooted problem or whatever\nbut just in that moment you can start to\ncome up with solutions for the here and\nnow without actually worrying about\nwhere this all comes from yeah\nso there's root cause there's in the\npresent and then the last thing that i\nwas kind of thinking about is like you\nmentioned this term limerence\nand and relationship rocd and so\ni think maybe we could just talk a\nlittle bit about what those terms mean\nwhat the experience of those things are\num yeah and and so what would you like\nto do\ni think like those last three things\nthat you mentioned um\nare all things that i'd like to tackle\nand think i could get into okay the\nlast three points yeah okay so the first\ntwo are things i feel like i\nunderstand pretty well okay sure so\nlet's um\nlet's actually start with the last one\nthen so you so we can\neveryone who's watching can also like\nget a backdrop of what we're talking\nabout so\ncan you tell us what limerence or rocd\nis\nyeah so i mean the main thing is rocd\nthat is\num ocd that manifests itself in a\nsocial context a lot of the time or at\nleast emotional\num like a lot of people that struggle\nwith ocd\nview it as like oh i need things to be\nin order or something\nwhich for most people i've spoken to\nthat that have like more physical\nuh issues with ocd they don't really\neven have that a lot of times it's more\num contamination based or other things\nuh like that but for me it's much more\non the i think it's kind of how ocd\ncombines with anxiety\num to create a\nsorry it's hard to word but especially\nwith such a strange subject it's hard to\nexplain to people but\nemotionally the reassurance that's\nneeded is\ni can't really control that like i can't\nact make my mind like think the way that\ni know i should\nyep that makes sense yep um\nand so i'll deal with with feelings and\nanxieties that i know for a fact are\nlike not\nlogical um but it doesn't change the\nfact that they are completely\nlegitimate in my head and i can't get\npast them okay\nthat's great that's a great uh\nexplanation\nso i'm gonna just touch on something for\na second so\num you know if we listen to conor connor\nsaying that like it\na lot of people's perception of ocd is\nactually what what we call\nocpd so there's obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder\nand then there's obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder\nso one is like when we think about a\npersonality disorder versus a\nnon-personality disorder i think about\nocd is something that affects you ocpd\nis something that you are so\npeople who have ocpd or people that i'd\ncall control freaks\nso they like want things highly\norganized they want things done a\nparticular way\nand if we listen to conor connor is\nsaying that i know the thoughts in my\nhat\nin my head are actually crazy but i\ncan't control them\nright so a big difference between ocpd\nand ocd\nis whether you yourself think that your\nthoughts are a problem\nso people who are ocpd and one thing\nthings highly organized and are\ncontrolled freaks\nthey don't think they have a problem\nthey think that everyone else has a\nproblem\nthat's something that we call ego\nsyntonic in psychiatry which means that\nit's completely it fits with like your\nperceptions\nocd is is very discreet because people\nwho have ocd\nknow that their thoughts are irrational\nthey just can't do anything about it\nlike you know factually that some of the\nthoughts in your head are sort of false\nand yet you are still controlled by your\nthoughts\ndoes that make sense and so the the\nfirst thing that i kind of want to point\nout\nis that it implies that you and your\nthoughts are different things\nthey're different entities does that\nmake sense\nyes are you saying that you agree with\nthat\nthat i'm are you are you saying that\nthat is the truth or\nyeah yeah i mean that's what i'm\nperceiving from you yeah\nis that an accurate perception right\nbecause yes absolutely 100\nso if we listen to conor connor saying\nmy thoughts i know they're factually\nincorrect\nand yet i can't do anything about them\nthey end up controlling me\ni have to seek the reassurance so if we\njust look at like\nsentence structure it implies that you\nare discreet from your thoughts\nright they're not you which that in and\nof itself i think is the first and most\nimportant thing to realize\nis that like you were separate from this\nand the more that we can help you\nhouse yourself in\nyour self the better your experience of\nocd will be\nyes absolutely it's funny i like how you\nordered that because that's something\nthat like\nthe past few months i've been really\nlike working on my own to like\nlook into different things i've been\nlooking at a lot of your talks and stuff\nand\nbeing really introspective and that's\nsomething that's really\nlike worked for me is kind of separating\nthose two things and realizing that i'm\nnot the thoughts\num it's helped more than most things\nthat i've learned over the years\ngreat i'm thrilled to hear that so like\nmaybe we can help you further along\nyeah um so\ni just want to make sure so like is\ndid i know you understood but let me\njust clarify like\nso you know the self is different from\nthe thoughts\nand it sounds like the more that you've\ncome to appreciate that\nin some ways maybe things have gotten a\nlittle bit better and we can talk more\nabout that\nis that fair is that true for everybody\nor is that something that only i deal\nwith okay\nnope that's true for everyone so i think\nthe the\nthe gift and the curse for you\nis that that separation a lot of people\nnever need to understand because their\nthoughts\nnever beat the [ __ ] out of them the way\nthat your thoughts beat the [ __ ] out of\nyou right\nand so a lot of people like our thoughts\nare more on the same team\nwith us whereas some people's thoughts\nif we think about people who are like\ndepressed and especially like really\nself-critical\nright so some people go around and they\nbeat themselves up like you mentioned\nthat you view yourself negatively in\nsocial situations\nso it's almost like your thoughts are\nattacking you\nright so then it becomes a circle of\nmy thoughts are attacking me i end up\nbehaving in a way that i'm not happy\nwith\nlike i'm more enclosed i'm not acting\nlike myself\nwhich then makes things actually worse\nand then i'm sad again\nand it's just a circle of yep anxiety in\nthat regard\nand and so so so let's just think\nthrough that circle okay so you're a\npiece of [ __ ]\nright right and then you close yourself\noff\nand then what happens is you start to\npanic\nbecause as you see yourself closing\nyourself off\nyou know that things are not going to go\nwell socially because you're doing\nit's not just your thoughts anymore it's\nlike you're not talking when you should\nbe talking\nyou know yes becomes like a blankness\nalmost like i'm not even\nlike i can't even think about what to\nsay i'm just blank\nyep and then but but the thing is the\nself in you\nrecognizes that you're blank\nand then as you recognize your blank you\nrealize like there's this horrible like\nself-fulfilling prophecy that starts to\narise in your mind\noh no it's happening again right\nabsolutely yeah oh no it's happening and\nthen what happens\nis it happens and then people ask you\nhey connor do you want to go grab\ndinner after we're done with class and\nthen your mind is blank\nand you kind of look at them like this\nand then they like okay man we'll catch\nyou later and then they leave\nthey can yeah something like that right\nand then what happens\nis you go back to i'm a piece of [ __ ]\nexcept this time\nit's not an irrational thought this\ntime it's true i am abusive\nright this time you have evidence\nlike this time like you actually know\nyou just screwed it up again\nand now we get to the cycle because now\nthat you're you're even more sure you're\na piece of crap\nit's going to make closing yourself off\neven worse\nit's going to make the self-fulfilling\nprophecy even worse\nyou're going to draw even more of a\nblank\nand then it happens again yeah\nand then then you're even worse yep it's\nthat same circle in\nso many different situations that same\nprocess can you tell us just give us an\nexample of one more\nlike with limerence as we were talking\nabout like with romantic relationships\nlike\nif things will be going fine and then\nthe next day like i'll wake up and be\nlike\ni don't think that she likes me anymore\nor something so then\nyou know i need to come up with some\nexcuse to text them something just so i\nget a response\nso then i feel even though i know it's\ncompletely irrational\ni'm just it's just something my ocd like\nrequires from me\nokay i need this reassurance and then\ni'll do that and then i maybe won't get\na response or something\nand then immediately overthinking\neverything like oh my god\nno response this is the worst thing in\nthe world um\nand i'll collapse on myself then the\nwhole day be completely depressed unable\nto do anything just\nshut down okay yeah\nokay so i i didn't mean to laugh but i i\nthink\nwe're gonna make some progress today and\nand my hope is that\nin a sense it'll be simpler but i think\nit's going to be tough so let's let's go\nthrough this play-by-play does that\nsound okay\nso now we're shifting to in the present\nokay so we talked maybe maybe we could\ntalk\nmore about our ocd but so you wake up in\nthe morning so let's start there\nyou wake up in the morning how do you\nfeel\num i'm not sure it depends on the day i\nguess but okay\ngood that's a good answer and then then\nat some point you have this thought she\ndoesn't like me\nyeah i mean i haven't really dealt with\nthis right now but it's something that i\nhave dealt with\nsure yeah so then what happens you have\nthe thought\nthe thought pops into your head she\ndoesn't like me right\nso then that becomes like i can't really\nescape that\nlike i can't i can't myself does not go\nwell that's not the case because of x y\nor z\nit's this is the case and no matter what\ni try to do to convince myself it feels\nlike that is the truth in my mind\nokay so that thought becomes a fact\ndoes that make sense yes so in that\nmoment\nthinking and reality become one\nyeah the other thing you say is that you\ncan't escape it but it sounds like you\ntry\ni do yeah so the first thing that\nhappens is that you\nyour some part of your mind starts to\nfight a war\nwith the other part of your mind there's\nthe\nshe doesn't like me and then tell me\nwhat that fight looks like\num what do you tell yourself trying to\nthink so it'll be like\ni'll feel i'll feel that urge or\nwhatever that\nneed for a reassurance and then i try to\nremind myself of like past situations\nwhere i've seeked\na kind of reassurance and it's made\nthings actually bad\ni guess because um so i try to convince\nmyself that way\nbut then it just doesn't compute\ni don't i just it's still somehow like i\nmight for a half a second almost it\nfeels like because my brain's moving so\nfast\nlike half a second i might feel like\nokay i'm good and then\nimmediately the intrusive thoughts are\nback in and eventually it feels like i\ngive in every time\nokay you give in yeah\nno my dude you get exhausted yeah\nthat is a better way to describe it\nright so it's not that you give in\nit's that you run out of gas like it's\nlike you try to fight so\nso the uh and once again conor i think\nthere's a lot of valuable stuff\nin your representation so you say that\nthere's an urge\nfor reassurance yes and then what fights\nthe urge for reassurance\nis logic so then your mind\nyour thoughts you conor the self\ndirects your mind and says mind we have\nthis urge for reassurance\ni know that that urge is false let us\ncome up with evidence\nand tell the urge that you don't need to\nbelong here\nyeah this is not true that she doesn't\nlike me is not a fact\nand then you have this little war\nbetween your logic and your urge\nand you fight that war for a while but\nthen like the urge seems to\nwhat happens to the urge as you try to\nlogic against it\num i try to like\nwell lately whenever i deal with\nsomething like that um\ni've been trying to like think of like\nroot causes or something\nfor why i need that so that's lately\nwhenever i do\n[ __ ] like that it that's what kind of\nbecomes and\nthe only thing that i really go back to\nis like a negative self-image\nand so i'm like well i feel like i need\nthis reassurance because i feel like i'm\nnot\ngood enough or i'm not like i'm i don't\nlike myself about anybody else like me\nsomething like that\nyeah um so that becomes the circle\nyou're you're doing good\nwith that i think that's a step forward\nlet's actually before you started doing\nthat\nwhat would happen um\nso let me think what was the step before\nso like when you try to argue with\nyourself\nlike there's a part of you that has you\nhave the urge for reassurance then you\nargue with yourself\nwhat would happen when you argue with\nyourself when i argued myself it would\nfeel like almost my thoughts would try\nto argue with that back\nyep so i'd be like i would search for\nreasons to prove myself wrong\nsearch for reasons to prove your logical\npart wrong\nyes to prove my logical self wrong so\nliterally like a fight in my brain\nit feels like between two sides to like\nprove each other wrong or right yep\nand which side wins always the\noverthinking\nocd the urge right so i'm going to ask\nyou kind of a weird question would you\nsay that the logical part of your brain\nin a bizarre way actually\nfuels the urge for reassurance\nyes yeah that that yeah that's it's\nweird right because\nin your mind you're trying to shut it\ndown but actually what you're causing it\nto do is grow\nyeah that's actually one thing that one\nof my doctors told me like a year ago\nwas like\nthe people that are like the most\nintrospective and she used the word\nsmart but like\njust understanding their mind and really\ntry to like solve this\nthey almost struggle more because they\ntrust themselves\nand understand themselves and so when\nthey have these distortions\nlike when i have these distortions it's\nvery tough for me to differentiate\nbetween\nwhat is fact and what is wrong because\nit feels like i should be able to trust\nmyself yeah\ni think that makes sense i would use\nslightly different language but i think\nthe general principle that the more that\nyou argue with let's call them\nocd thoughts for lack of a better term\nor the urge for reassurance\nthe stronger it gets\nand then your logic eventually gets\nspent and then you're left with the urge\nfor reassurance and then what do you do\nwhat happens when the urge for\nreassurance wins in a relationship\nthen i become like too clingy i'll be\ntoo like i just i just i'm not acting\nlike myself\num who are you acting like\nthe ocd anxiety whatever like this\nseparate piece of me that i\ndon't like i don't enjoy seeing but it\nmanifests itself\num and the strange thing is that like\nthe same like\nimage that like i get of that feeling i\nguess when i when i view that in\nretrospect\nis the same self-image that i put on\nmyself\nanytime that like anything negative\nhappens if that makes sense\nso like that view of myself doing that\nhow i view myself like that very often\neven when i shouldn't i guess which i\nthink\nthat's a whole nother issue of itself\nbut it's something i've never known\nit's not a whole other issue that's the\ncrux of it my dude\nokay so so let's just here let's just\nmake sure we understand what you said\nright\nso when you get too clingy so there are\na couple of important points here the\nfirst is that you say you're not\nyourself and\nand this goes back to the idea that like\nconor is his true self when he's\nstreaming\nright and that's when you're\nunencumbered by your thoughts\nyou just get to be you and then you see\nthe urge for reassurance\ntransform you into this like\nemotion sucking vampire like it's\nnot you you're like clingy and you're\nhungry and you like need something from\nsomeone else\nyou like suck the life like out of like\nsomething\nto sustain this part of you and then you\nlook at yourself there's some\npart of true connor stuck in the corner\nof your mind\nthat's like full of despair and rage\nbecause you see yourself like losing to\nthis thing\nand then you're not you're like this\nisn't me but i don't know how to stop\nright and when it first started like i i\ndidn't have that sense of self\nand logic i guess so it was just like a\ncomplete like roller coaster\nbut then ever since that like i have\nrealized that\nnow it is what you just described we're\nlike i'm just like\ni feel like i'm just a passenger\nwatching this happen and\nyou know it's it's stressful and so you\nsaid um\nyeah so we'll get get to that okay so\ni i don't know how i'm gonna not lose\nthat but um\nso and then you said that you actually\nnotice that you feel the same way that\nyou do when\nyou sort of equated it to feeling\nsomething else\nnegative so i don't have exactly to\ndescribe it but it's something i've\nthought about lately is that like\nthis same negative self-image of myself\nthat i'll get\nin situations where i really shouldn't\nbe down on myself\nis that same feeling i get looking at\nthat anxiety looking at that part of me\nalmost like i'm like i am be\ni think part of my negative self-image\nis\ni've kind of placed this anxiety ocd\nbeast as my identity\nin a lot of places um which i obviously\ndon't like\nyeah so so then you have a negative you\nbecome too clingy\nyou start to beat yourself up for being\nclingy\nsure and then the more that you beat\nyourself up\nthen we sort of complete the cycle and\nwe reinforce\nshe doesn't like me because i am not\nworth liking\nright right and then once we get back\nthere the urge for reassurance arises\nagain\nyou become clingy again you view\nyourself negatively\nyou view yourself as possibly pathetic\nbecause you're so clinky\nthat's not who you want to be it's not\nwho you know you are\nand then since you becoming something\nthat you know you're a\ngood person somewhere buried in there\nbut since as you move away from that\nit becomes more and more likely that she\ndoes not like you\nand then so the cycle just repeats so\nlike you're right yeah and that's\nthat's just how it manifests in romantic\nrelationships yeah like it's a\ncompletely different thing for each\nsituation in my life\nyes but it's the same circle exactly\nright so that's the\nso here's the cool thing connor if it's\nthe same circle\nif we can break the circle for one\ndimension of your life we can break it\nfor all dimensions of your life\nthis is also what i think gets diet gets\nyou a thousand different diagnosis\nbecause depending on the content of the\ncircle\nsomeone will diagnose you with anxiety\nyeah if the content of the\ncircle is different they'll diagnose you\nwith depression\nand if the content of the circle\ninvolves relationships\nyou get rocd right so what people are\ndoing is they're they're in this kind of\ngoes back to your earlier instinct that\nthere's something like at the root of\nthis\nand just depending on the flavor of it\nthey'll give you a different diagnosis\noh this guy is beating himself up he\nfeels guilty\nhe has no motivation depression oh he's\nworried about his future\nhe's worried that he won't have a career\nhe's worried worried worried\nanxiety yeah oh yeah that makes a lot of\nsense cause like i believe like i've had\nthose things it's just that i've through\ndifferent people it's been like\nthe things that they target it almost\nbecame\nwhen i would see different doctors like\ni would just be exhausted trying to\nexplain everything\nbecause i felt like i wasn't\nencompassing everything and that they\nweren't getting the full\nthe full picture yeah and and i think\nwhat you were giving them\nis what in a sense they're looking for\nbecause this is how we do psychiatrist\nwe get trained\nto like bucket people because that's how\nwestern medicine works okay you're ill\nis it a physical illness or medic mental\nillness okay we're gonna\nbucket you into physical illness oh is\nit a temporary illness or a chronic\nillness oh okay it's a temporary\nokay is it infectious or non-infectious\nokay it's infectious\nis it covid or not covid okay so we slot\npeople down that's how we're trained to\nthink\nit's it's you i mean i'm not saying it's\nbad it's just it has strengths and\nweaknesses\nfor some people who do have sort of a\nsimple depression it works really well\nbut then i think sometimes i you know we\nmeet people like you\nwho have a bunch of i'm sure your chart\nis filled with different diagnoses\noh yeah yeah and and so one of my\nteachers once taught me that if anyone\nhas three diagnoses they're all wrong\nyeah and and it's just different and\nthat's because we even know as\nclinicians that we tend to like\nlabel people with things but if you know\ni don't think you have\nthree discrete disease prospects\ndepression anxiety and ocd\nhappening in your mind it does sound to\nme like for what it's worth that maybe\nyou do have something like ocd that\nseems to be the\nthe best fit but um at the end of the\nday what we can see is that there is a\ncycle\nright and then the linchpin of the cycle\nis what do you have any idea\num maybe like intrusive thoughts\nsomething like that so uh okay so that's\ndefinitely a key feature of\nall of the cycles right the fact that\nwhen you use the word intrusive that\nmeans that you don't want to think about\nit\nand it rings your doorbell and is like\nhere i am\nright right so i asked you how do you\nfeel when you wake up in the morning\nyou're like it depends on the day and\nthen the thought jumps in\nshe doesn't like that's the intrusion\nit's the unwanted stranger showing up at\nyour door\nlike i'm having a good day and then\nyou're taking a piss and it's like oh\nshe doesn't like me\nit's like [ __ ] now we go off on this\nlike you board this roller coaster and\nthen here we go\nyou're strapped in there's nothing you\ncan do to get off\nso what what do you think let me just\nit's\nsort of a read my mind question what let\nme ask\nask it this way what do you think are\nthe comments so if this cycle can\nmanifest as depression or anxiety\nwhat is common about the cycle\num you go a little bit further with that\ni'm not sure exactly yeah so like if we\nthink about it\ni guess what i'm sort of hunting for\nthere are a couple of things one is that\ni think as you mentioned that there's\nthis idea of a negative self-image that\nseems to transcend\nall of these individual cycles what do\nyou think about that\nyes i yeah i agree i think that\nthat's something that i've come to\nrealize is that\nat the at the core of it in a lot of\nways\nit always comes back to how i view\nmyself okay\nso then we get now we get to the\ntheoretically the root of it how do you\nview yourself\n[Music]\num yeah not not very well a lot of the\ntime\ntell me about honor i'm really hard on\nmyself a lot\num anything that i do wrong or things\naround me\ni usually end up blaming myself or think\nabout what i could have done better\num physically i i cannot stand seeing\nmyself on camera or in the mirror or\nanything\ni just pretty much anything about me\nlike i'm\nit's i'm very hard on myself um when you\nsee yourself in the mirror\nwhat kind of thoughts do you have i\nimmediately get the same\nanxious down that's the exact feeling\nthat i get when i make that\nreassurance mistake is what i get when i\nsee myself in the mirror\nokay um it's just i just get super down\non myself it doesn't mean that like i\nhate myself or anything like that\nlike it's like i i like me the me that i\nreally know that i\nam like when i'm streaming and stuff or\nwhen i'm behaving how i\nreally feel and feel comfortable um\nbut otherwise i i don't otherwise i have\nthis super negative image of myself\nokay can you tell us like so i'm looking\nfor more\ncolor or flavor about super negative\nimage\ncan you tell me like literally what\nthoughts you have when you look at\nyourself in the mirror\nlike oh this guy is just\ndumb annoying um he\nlike he's ugly he isn't funny he tries\ntoo hard he's\njust all this stuff all these really\nintrusive negative thoughts about myself\nokay um so the interesting thing i want\nto point something out to you\nso when i look at myself in the mirror\nwhat i would expect is if i was going to\nhave negative images\nand negative thoughts about myself i\nwould expect them to be physical in\nnature does that make sense yeah and a\nlot of times they are\num yeah but here's so much things that\nlike um yeah yeah go ahead\nno you can keep going i was no i mean i\ni think it's interesting because you\nonly said\nthe first thing that you said is he's\ndumb\nright yeah and i think i might have just\nbeen beating around the bush i mean\nthere definitely is a physical element\nthere\nlike that i get really hard on myself\nfor i agree that there's a physical\nelement but what i think is really\nreally notable\nis that there's a lot more than a\nphysical album\nso the first thing that i i want to\npoint out to you is that\nyour criticisms of yourself do not\nstem fundamentally from the outside\nworld\nright because if they were purely\nphysical\nthen that would make sense in a weird\nway but the fact that you can look at\nyourself in the mirror and say this is a\nguy that tries too hard like\nhow the [ __ ] if i showed you a thousand\npictures of people's faces how\non earth does anyone know who's a\ntryhard and who isn't it just\ncompletely does not compute so the first\nthing that i want to point out to you is\na lot of what you believe about yourself\nliterally cannot come from outside you\nyeah yeah okay\nso then the question uh-huh no yeah i'm\ni'm processing that it make me make\nsense absolutely\nright because like if you just looked at\nyourself and you're like oh this guy's\nugly he's overweight\nyou know his hair is funny he's got a\nbig nose\nlike whatever needs to trim his eye a\nsideburns\nlike if those are the kinds of thoughts\nlike that would sort of make sense\nbecause it's coming from\nyour sense organs like it's you're\nyou're beating yourself up for your\nappearance but you're beating yourself\nup\nwhen you see yourself in the mirror\nbecause it evokes something about\nyou that is not\nbased on your appearance it's just like\nyou have this idea\nof yourself as being crappy in some way\nwhich i think you've started to realize\nright so the other thing uh\nokay so let me ask you this when did you\nstart to have that opinion\nabout yourself\ni think it was around when everything\nreally started to take off like\nprobably around early high school um\nwhat happened around early high school\ni don't think that i'm constantly trying\nto figure that out it doesn't really\nfeel like anything happened\nokay it just kind of felt like as i as\nthe world around me was like people were\ngrowing up becoming more mature and\nstuff\nlike i almost felt like thrust into\nposition to grow up as well maybe\nokay and didn't feel quite ready i don't\nknow\ni'm trying to feel like you're weren't\nas good as they were\nyeah in a lot of ways um i've always\nbeen\na little bit shorter than everybody so i\nwas like everybody else is going through\ngrowth spurts and i'm you know i'm 5'5\nand everybody is still growing and there\nwas stuff like that\nthere was a sense of\nwell all my friends are playing sports\nand doing all this cool stuff and you\nknow\nworking out every day and i like playing\nvideo games\num and i'm not really\ndoing much because this was before my\nstream and all that so i was\npretty uh i felt i felt different from a\nlot of people\nand then like the people that shared\ninterests with me like that were\nthat did like video games or stuff like\nthat was not really a crowd that i like\nto be around\nuh for a variety of reasons um whether\nit just didn't work together they didn't\nlike their humor\nlike i had a desire to be social and a\nlot of these people were no social\num so i fit in with a different crowd\nyeah so you know i think conor sometimes\nwhen i ask like where did that start a\nlot of times\npeople\nthink that it has to be something like\nbig and\ndramatic you know like oh\nlike for my eight eight my 13th birthday\nlike my dad didn't show up\nand he told me i was a piece of [ __ ] and\nthen like that shattered me like we try\nto think about something traumatic but\nin my experience\nwhat happens is like you see how this is\na cycle and with each iteration of the\ncycle\nit grows yeah\nso the really interesting thing is that\neveryone sort of looks for some dramatic\nsource\nmyself included for like the origin of\nyour problems where if we really think\nabout it\nif it grows with every cycle it can\nstart with a tiny seed\nthe most insignificant of experiences\nand then you run through the cycle and\nit levels up\nand you run through the cycle and it\nlevels up\nand then in high school it starts\nleveling up every day\nat the end of high school it's leveling\nup twice a day\nit paid for the xp buff and now it's\ngetting really good at grinding it's got\nend game gear\nyou know it's got its farm patterns down\nevery relationship it grows and it grows\nand it grows but it can start from a\ntiny little seed\nlike i see you're saying like make the\nvideo game analogy but that is actually\nthe case right for like any time i would\nmake progress like it would\nit would almost become stronger in a\ndifferent way like i would\nmay if i got past it at all in a day\nthen it would\ncome back in a different way yep and\ndefeat me again yeah so and i think that\ngoes back to the urge okay so now\ni'm gonna can i draw\nyes okay\nso we're gonna see if we can help you\nout how are we doing so far connor any\nquestions\ni'm good no i'm i'm i'm really getting\nsomewhere\nokay i'm i'm hoping other people can\nget help out of it too okay\nthis is definitely a new experience for\nme because i don't usually go on camera\nfor the most part most of my streams are\nno camera oh really so uh\ndoing that with talking about serious\nstuff is definitely\nnew for me how are you feeling about all\nthat i'm a little i've been nervous and\ni've been like\noff but i'm it's it's a good kind of\nnervous i guess because i did when i did\nexposure-based therapy this was the\nexact kind of thing that like\nthey encouraged okay hold on one second\nokay so here's what i we're gonna start\nwith the cycle okay and i apologize for\nmy abysmal handwriting\nall right\nno okay so the cycle is\nstop it she\ndoesn't like me\nokay so this is interesting because then\nyou said there's an\nurge for reassurance\ndo you want to place this under like\nthis specific um\nkind of situation or because like she\ndoesn't like me is just like\nan example right yeah that's okay yeah\nunless you have an issue with it i'm\njust using that because that's what i\ndon't have an issue i'm just trying to\nthink if there's like a better thing we\ncould call it so i could try to like\napply it to more things than just\nokay sure so let's call this the\nintrusive thought how's that\nyeah yeah yeah\nokay and then what happens is logic\narises\nand logic fights right\nand logic is like i'm\na cool guy\nyeah and then there's like a war\nand then like the more you fight the\nmore this increases\nand then eventually you run out of mana\nand then you end up clinky\nwe good does that make sense then what\nhappens\nis then there's um\nthink about how to do this\nso then what happens is that you start\nto become someone\nstart to become\nthat which\nyou loathe\nand this i'm gonna call your negative\nself-attitude\nright so this is the transcendent part\nright just like we're saying the\nintrusive thought is like the part that\nis not specific\nthis is also not specific this always\nhappens\nand then you notice changes to your\nbehavior change\nto behavior\nand then self-fulfilling prophecy\nand then we can go all the way back\nto she doesn't like me make sense yes\nyeah yeah and i'm i'm seeing how i can\napply that to\na different situation like different\nsituations as well absolutely\nso like like for example like at the top\nit could be like\nif i'm gonna go hang out with a bunch of\nmy friends from high school that like\nare here for thanksgiving\num then it would be like\nwell i don't want to not act i don't\nwant to\nbe quiet i don't want to not act like\nmyself i want to be me\nyep um and then that\nafter that it kind of becomes i'm\noverthinking trying to\nbe me almost yep and so then\nyeah yep so let's look at something else\nright so here's the other thing\nwhat is the self-fulfilling prophecy do\nto the negative self-attitude\nit justifies it it makes it seem makes\nit seem legitimate\nplus right and then what happens\nis so we're also going to call this\nyour ocd self and then there's your true\nself\nand what happens is like any time your\nself negative self attitude increases\nand the self-fulfilling prophecy\nincreases there's a fight between your\nocd self and your true self\nthis is you saying i'm not this way this\nis not who i\nam and the ocd self says [ __ ] you\nthis is exactly who i am and see right\nsee\nand here's here's the proof look at what\njust happened absolutely and then so\nthis\nconflict ends up leading to hopelessness\nwe haven't used the word hopeless yet\nbut what do you think about that\nyeah that's a great way to and how it's\nfelt over the years\nespecially at a lot of different moments\nbecause like here's\nhere's conor in the corner of your mind\nand he's fighting against this thing and\nhe's trying so\nhard conor you've tried so hard you've\nseen\nso many doctors and done so many\ndifferent therapies and so many\ndifferent medications\nyeah and this [ __ ] over here wins\nevery single time and so no wonder\nyou're hopeless\nright so then the question becomes okay\nso like what do we do about that\nyeah like that negative self attitude\nlike that\nlike my true self looking at the\nnegative self attitude\nlike that feeling of myself is what i\nsee in the mirror\nit's what i it's anything to do with me\nthat i feel i'm not in control over\nis is that feeling and then that leads\nthat hopelessness again\nin so many different situations yep so\nthis is the cool thing\nconnor i know it sounds weird that i\ncall it cool but like\nin so many different situations so this\nis what i want you to understand\nit is the very reason that you feel\nattacked on all sides\nand you're struggling in so many\ndifferent places\nit's all one thing which can feel\noverwhelming\nbut it's almost like you know like the\nthe\none opening of the death star\nbecause the cool thing is that since\nthis is all one complex in your mind\nif you can pull the plug on one you'll\npull the plug on everything\nso the very thing that makes you feel\noverwhelmed\nbecause it's happening in every single\nplace actually means that there's like\none\ncommon vulnerable spot and if you can\nmake progress this entire thing is going\nto come tumbling down around you\nthat makes me feel better if anything\nbecause over the years it's felt like\nit is so many different things that it's\nalmost impossible to tackle\nexactly but the the very thing is that\nfeeling the more impossible it is to\ntackle bizarrely the more possible it is\nto tackle\nbecause it's attacking you from so many\ndifferent things dude there may be\nsomething wrong with you conor i don't\nreally know but\ni i know there aren't that many things\nwrong with you\nthanks right it just doesn't make sense\nlike sure i'll give you this but it's\nit's about intrusive thoughts it's about\nurge for reassurance\nit's about negative self-attitude and\nself-fulfilling prophecies and cycles\nand if we just if we change this we'll\ngive you a different diagnosis\nthat's all and it can feel like all\nthese different dimensions when friends\ncome over from thanksgiving\nwhen i go on dates when i look at myself\nin the mirror any time i stream anytime\ni go to college any time i do this\nanytime i do this it's one\nthing and it comes down to this\nokay so now i'm going to teach you a\ncouple of tricks\nokay here's the first trick\nokay question so far no that's\nthat that's a really good connection\nbecause i'm just\nseeing the cycle and so many different\nthings yeah like be it when i when i\nwould wake up they go to school and i\njust wouldn't want to go\nand i wouldn't really know why but it\nwould just be a cycle if you need to go\nyou have to do your schoolwork it's\ngoing if you don't go to school you're\ngonna have more work to do when you get\nback and it's gonna be worse\nand then just the cycle of well i don't\ncare i give up\ni'm not going and then it piles on\nyeah so yeah so i want to just talk\nabout that for a second\none of the worst things that we do to\nourself is when we know we need to do\nsomething that's good for us\nthere's a whole special kind of\nshittiness that we put ourselves in\nwhen we don't do the thing that we know\nwe need to do\nyeah that strengthens this guy\nso much when you know every fiber of\nyour being\nknows that you just gotta go to school\neverything in your life would be better\nif you go to school\nand then when you don't do it the amount\nof self-hatred\nyou buy yourself is immense\nand this is the crazier thing we think\nthat the more important something is the\neasier it becomes to do\nbut bizarrely the more important the\nmore of a no-brainer\nit is to do something the more paralyzed\nwe feel\nbut we think it's the exact opposite and\nthen we judge ourselves for that\nwe're like there's no it's a no-brainer\ni have to go to school it'll be easier\nfor me tomorrow\ni like going to school i have fun once i\ngo there my friends are there\nall of these different reasons and we\nthink that each of those reasons should\ninspire us to action\nbut if we actually are scientific we\nfind that the more reasons there are for\nus to do something\nthe more paralyzed we are and the more\nreasons that we are to\nthat in order to do something the more\nthis negative self-attitude grows\nand the more this grows the more it\nholds us back in everything\nso do you think that a root not as\nspecific like\nnot that it's one thing but something\nthat might have built it up over the\nyears\nis that like i have no motivation to go\nto school and i would build up that\nnegative self-attitude which then made\nthat more of a factor in other areas of\nmy life absolutely\nyeah right and absolutely because now\nall it takes it used to be school\nthat would bring up your negative\nattitude now your negative self attitude\nall it needs\nis a [ __ ] mirror there's nothing in\nthe mirror\nthere's no consequence does that make\nsense\nright it's just a piece of glass\nand you walk by and if we really look at\nthe truthfulness of what\nthere's nothing there's no nothing and\nwhat you look in the mirror what you see\nhas nothing to do with the outside world\nit comes all from you\nthere was a point where it used to be\nwith the outside world\nlike in school or maybe your first\ngirlfriend or whatever\nbut now this thing has gotten reinforced\nso much it has a life of its own\nit's become a whole different person\nthat lives inside you\nand that's where the urge for\nreassurance comes from\nwhat do you think about that can you\nillustrate that again really quick\nyeah so the urge for reassurance is\nbecause\nyou have a fundamentally negative view\nof yourself\nso i try to reassure myself that's not\nthe case yep\nand then perfect right so true self is\nwhere this comes from\nurge for reassurance comes from here\nwhat do you think about that yeah no i\nmean that's that's a great way to\npicture it because\ni mean yeah here's the thing i've never\nreally been able to picture like i i do\nthis in my head like i'm a very\nvisual person like all my thoughts\nalmost like\nvisual if that makes sense so yeah when\ni try to analyze this in my brain like i\ncome up with this\nbut you're putting it down on paper\nmakes it a lot\neasier to comprehend and to digest good\nthat's what we're here for bro we're\njust getting started buddy\nokay so the other thing to let you know\nis that this is\nfalse fundamentally does that make sense\nto you\nit i believe you but\nto but to my how much i've dealt with it\nit doesn't because it feels like such a\nfundamental part of how i think\nyep yep so so it's a it's true in a\nsense and it's false in another sense\nbut what i'm saying it's the urge is\ntrue\nbut this attitude towards yourself\nbecause you know this because you say\nthere are times where i know who my true\nself is\nand if this is based\n[Music]\nif this is related\nand we know that this\nis false okay\nthen then we know that like this can't\nbe true\ndoes that make sense yes right because\nwe sort of know like you even said at\nthe very beginning if we talk about the\nnature of ocd\nit's being unable to\nnot believe things that you know are\nfalse\nyou know the thoughts in your head are\nwrong you just can't stop believing them\nyeah right it's weird we like you\nyou know you shouldn't believe it but\nyou can't help it\nyeah and then it gets to a point where\ni've dealt with it for so long\nthat part of my like true like part of\nme my\npart of my logic has almost given up to\na point where i'm like\nabsolutely maybe maybe it is right yeah\nlike that's what i've dealt with\nah see maybe it is right there it is\nwhat do we call that hopelessness\nbeautiful\nand just like dealing with it for so\nlong over and over and over hold on hold\non\nso now we're gonna tunnel down okay when\nyou say the word dealing with it\nthat's what this is\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i mean it is it's that fight yeah\nyep\nright so it's the fight that leads to\nthe hopelessness\nbecause you can't win against this\nso what do you do any ideas\nwell if it's the fight that leads to it\nthen i imagine it's something to do with\nnot fighting\nbeautiful\nright so this is in the east what we\ncall acceptance\ndid you ever try acceptance and\ncommitment therapy\nact um i\ni think it might have been part of my\nexposure-based therapy yeah maybe\nso this is going to sound kind of weird\nbut like imagine so what i want you to\ndo is like your ocd\nself needs reassurance right\nwho does it need reassurance from\nsome factor that isn't myself incorrect\nthat's what you've believed right that's\nwhat i mean yeah\nright and just think about it what you\nneed\nis for these two dudes to party up\nbecause here's the thing at the end of\nthe day\nthe reason your self-attitude increases\nis because you're beating yourself up\nthat's what this is\nyou say that again the reason that your\nnegative self-attitude is increasing is\nbecause\nyou're beating yourself up because\nthere's reverses here\nthe urge for reassurance the logic is\nlike no no no bro don't feel that way\nyou're wrong\nyeah this is the problem\nthis is the problem\nbecause if you can reassure yourself\nif instead of beating yourself up you\ncan reassure yourself if you can provide\ncomfort to yourself\nthen you don't need it from anyone else\nyeah and i think bizarrely that's what\nyou started to do whether you realize it\nor not\nand what i mean by comfort is when you\nstart to\njust notice things without reacting so i\ndon't know that you've gone as far as\nproviding comfort\nwhat i think you've started to do at the\nleast is just let this thing be\nwithout fighting it\nyeah because you started to notice okay\nmy true self is over here my false self\nis over here\nso be it i'm gonna win some i'm gonna\nlose some\nyeah but when you say that you're not\nfighting\nyeah so are you saying that that's right\nor wrong\nhow does it feel\num it kind of feels like i'm stuck in\nlimbo okay\nso that's that's good because\nstuck in limbo is the first step to\nchanging a downward spiral\nokay right you gotta be neutral for a\nwhile\nand i think that's what i said i don't\nthink you've learned how to comfort\nyourself\nyou've learned how to stop fighting\nwhich if we think about it fighting like\nwe said\nwhat does the logic do to the urge for\nreassurance\num it's it's allowed to do that\nit it gives me reassurance and like\ni try to give myself reassurance and\nwhat does it do\nit counters it with the negative\nself-attitude and\nand so the logic the answer that i'm\nlooking for is we kind of talked about\nthis earlier but like\nremember that the logic in a weird way\nfeeds your urge for reassurance\nthe more you fight against it the harder\nit pushes back\nso the fight between the negative\nself-attitude and the true self\nis almost the same as the urge\nreassurance against the logic\nyou're damn right it is and and that's\nwhy we have\nthese two arrows right\nyeah yeah yeah yeah\nand then what happens is then you go um\nafter fighting this for a while you're\nexhausted and then you just give in to\nall this crap down here\nyeah and so what i want you to think\nabout is like imagine like\nlike i don't know if you've ever\nexercised with a punching bag\nyeah but like you know the harder you\nhit a punching bag the harder it swings\nback\nthat's just the nature of it\nand that's how your mind works so the\nharder you push against\nyourself in your mind the harder your\nmind pushes back\nevery action has an equal and opposite\nreaction\nenergy is neither created nor destroyed\nif i take a neutron and i split\nit i wind up with a proton and an\nelectron\nthis is like a universal principle\nand so when people talk about acceptance\nlike if i hit\nlike a punching bag and the punching bag\nswings back and smacks me\nwhat can i do to like stop the punching\nbag from smacking me\nstop hitting it absolutely and even then\nif you want if it's swinging wildly back\nand forth because you've been hitting it\nfor a while\nwhat do you need to do step away from it\nstep away for it or hug it\nsure right when it hits you you wrap\nyour arms around it and go for the ride\nbaby\nand you stay with it you accept it\nyou embrace it okay so what does that\nmean in the context\nbecause i'm getting lost in a bit of the\nanalogy you're\ndamn right buddy okay so good so now we\nget to the practical\nokay so what does that mean so\npractically what that means is that\nyou're gonna have an urge so you're\ngonna have a thought you're gonna have\nan intrusive thought\nwe can't stop that yet agreed\nthat's the nature of intrusive thoughts\nyou can't control it\nall you can control uh conor is your\nreaction to what happens in your mind\nyou can't control your mind\ndoes that make sense yeah i agree with\nthat so we can't stop this\nwe can't stop this\nwe can stop this\nokay so what that means what i want you\nto practically do\nis like the next time you like look at\nyourself in the mirror can you see\nyourself on stream today\nyeah okay so we're gonna do this like\nmeditation i guess we're gonna do it now\nokay okay so hold on a second\ni'm gonna stop the screen share okay\nokay\nso we're going to try right now i want\nwe're going to teach you how to do this\nin this moment can't you see yourself\nyeah so i want all you guys to kind of\ntry to do this if you can\nbut if you load yourself then this is\nthe practice for you\nokay i want you to so what we're gonna\ndo is like i'm gonna ask you to look at\nyourself in a second\nand when you look at yourself i'm i want\nyou to notice\nthis like programming that starts up\nyou're gonna feel like all these\nnegative thoughts and then\nwhat's going to happen is that a voice\nautomatically is going to come to your\ndefense\nand that's going to be like no man that\nstuff isn't true like khan is a great\nguy\nokay and then they're going to start to\nwar and you're gonna try\nto suppress one don't do that\nsit with both of those things and i want\nyou to be like referee between those two\nthings\nand understand that conor is allowed and\nhas a good reason to feel the way that\nhe does\nwe don't want to teach you that we're\nwrong you're wrong we want to teach you\nthat\nyou're right and it doesn't mean what\nyou think it means\nright so like if i have a kid who like\nyou know they're\nlet's say they're like making a cupcake\nand they mess up the icing i don't tell\nthe kid\nyeah you messed up the ice you didn't\nmess up the icing no no the icing is\nfine\neverything's is is great i tell them\nyeah you screwed up the icing and it's\nnot the end of the world\nwhat you need conor is for your true\nself to reassure\nyour negative self it's not that your\nnegative self is wrong\nit's just that all of the thoughts and\nconclusions that your mind comes up with\nabout the premises which happen to be\ntrue\nthat's what we need to let go so\nwhat do you mean by that so the thoughts\nthat i'm\noh my my thoughts must feel like\nconclusions if that makes sense\nyeah so so that's what you need to tease\napart right so we'll see this in the\nmoment when i ask you to look at\nyourself\nbut like you're going to look at\nyourself and you're gonna say like okay\nlike my\nface is right\nwhatever and then then what's gonna\nhappen is your mind is gonna\njump to a conclusion therefore no one\nwill ever love me\nright and then what i want you to do is\nalmost be like an older brother to\nyourself\nand be like hey man like let's be honest\nyou're not the best looking guy on the\nplanet\nand just because you're not the best\nlooking guy doesn't mean that you're\ngoing to be alone for the rest of your\nlife\nbut i'm going to give you that you're\nnot the best looking guy on the planet\nthat's cool right we're not going to i'm\nnot going to argue with you against that\nyou can have that one i'll take the l\nbut can we just accept you anyway\ncan we say that i'm ugly and\nlike i'm actually a pretty cool guy can\nthe true self and negative self\nthat part of what you that you know you\nare the part of you that looks at the\nfalse self and says\nthat isn't me instead of the two y'all\nfighting can both y'all coexist\ni guess like part of me doesn't want to\nlike accept\nthat the negative thought is true yep\nthere's your problem because that's the\norigin of\nthat's the origin of the the\nfight because remember i don't want to i\ndon't want to look at myself in the\nmirror and just be every time be like\nyeah you're ugly\nno no we're not we're not accepting that\nyou're ugly\nper se so this is where remember when i\nasked you\nokay so i'm gonna switch back to this\nfor a second okay\nokay remember when i asked you\nis this false or true\ndo you remember that yes\nthe urge for reassurance is true\nit's not that you're actually ugly\nwhat's true\nis that you feel ugly\nokay and your true self can let your ocd\nself feel that they're ugly\nlike hey man i get that you think you're\nugly\ni'm not gonna try to convince you that\nyou're not but i understand that you\nfeel that way about yourself\nokay okay does that make sense that\nmakes more sense yeah when you did the\nbig brother analogy i was like\ni was viewing that as almost the the\nobjective truth i guess\nno it's not about it's not about the\nobjective truth because like\nthis is the thing it's the search for\nobjective truth that is the source of\nthe conflict\nbecause the ocd self says i'm\nobjectively true the true self says i'm\nobjectively true\nand then they fight about it forget\nabout objective truth\nwhat you're going to do is learn how to\naccept yourself\neven if you're wrong\nokay it's not about right or wrong it's\nabout accepting both sides\nyeah okay we're gonna try it and then\nwe'll see if this like works for you or\nnot okay so now can you see yourself can\nyou maximize your\ni'll definitely try it off stream as\nwell okay sure i imagine in my own\nlike environment it'll be easier than\nknowing i'm in front of people\nbut good so we want it we want it when\nit's harder not when it's easier yeah\nokay so just maximize your own image\nokay\ngive me a window into your mind conor\nwhat do you see so\nimmediately like i'm extremely critical\nabout like how my mouth moves how i see\nmyself\num i'm almost like looking at myself and\nlike seeing into my thoughts\nnegatively okay so close your eyes for a\nsecond\nand just watch all of that negativity\narise\nokay so like all that stuff could be\ntrue we're not here to find objective\ntruth\ndo you see your response to it\num it's kind of just there like i\nlike i'm like all those thoughts are\nthere and\nobserving them okay\nso just watch them what happens to you\ni just feel like uncomfortable i guess\nokay good tell me what that discomfort\nfeels like\nwhere do you it feels like it feels like\nthose thoughts\nare becoming true to me okay so watch\nthem become truer and truer to you\nwhat is it like for them to become true\num just kind of get more sad\nand down i guess good okay so notice\nthose feelings now\nthat you feel sad that there's a part of\nyou that feels sad because it believes\nthis thing to be true\nright and what do you want to do to the\npart of you that feels sad because it's\nlike\ndestined to whatever um\ni want to like fix it okay be happy\nright that's what you have to let go my\nfriend\ndo you see that's your reaction so\nthere's this whole channel\ni supposed and i'm looking there's this\nwhole channel of thoughts oh my mouth is\nmoving weird whatever\nand then like those thoughts gel into\ntruth\nand then they create a sense of sadness\nand then along comes the true self no no\nno\nconor we shall not be sad we shall\ntriumph\nand be victorious and live a life of\nhappiness\nand what you're doing in that moment is\nbullying\nthe negative self\nyou're telling it your feelings are\nwrong\nbad negative self that's not what we\nwant to believe\nbecause there's a part of you that's\nafraid that if you if you accept it and\nyou stop\nfighting then what's gonna happen\nthat everybody else will look at me\nweird and\nnobody will like me because i'm not\nmaking any effort to make myself\npresentable or good in any way\nokay so that too that's coming from the\nnegative self\ndo you see that those thoughts are\noriginal from the negative self so now\nwhat's happening\nwhen you want to make yourself be happy\nand not let yourself be sad you're doing\nokay\nokay so this is what happens is like\nimagine i'm hitting the punching bag\nand i hit the punching bag really hard\nand it swings back at me really hard\nwhat do i need to do\ni need to hit it again to make it go\naway right\nand so when you try to chase after\nhappiness and you don't want to accept\nthe possibility of sadness\nyou hit back further and then it swings\nback and you keep on doing that keep on\ndoing that until you run out of mana\nand then it smacks you in the face and\nthen you lose\nbecause it's your very own energy so you\ndon't want it okay so like\nso you could be sad how do you feel\nabout that\nsorry with my eyes closed my thoughts\nmove so fast it's hard to focus\nokay so go ahead and open them then okay\nso um yeah can you repeat that yeah\nso um so you may be sad what do you\nthink about that\num\n[Music]\nit doesn't feel good okay um and it's\nit's what it's what i said like there's\nthat instant desire to fix it\nyep so that too i want you to notice\nthat desire to fix it that desire to fix\nit actually doesn't come from the true\nself\nokay but notice that desire to fix it\nand just let it be there\nand now i want you to think about the\nperson that you are when you're\nstreaming who is that\ndoes that person try to fix anything\nnot in the same way absolutely\nright so it's not it's not self-critical\nit's more\nproblem-solving if that makes sense yeah\nhow to describe it yep\ni think it's very different there's a\ndifference between\ntrying to fix something and trying to\nbuild something\ni think your streaming self doesn't\nthink that anything is broken\nyou're just striving for more\nright it's about effort and growth not\nabout\nrepair and security\nit's offering the best of what you have\nright and so when i'm not doing that i'm\ni feel like i'm almost always in a state\nof\ntrying to reassure myself and make\nmyself\nfeel justified i guess yep absolutely\nright so now what you need to do is like\nnotice those two modes of operation\nin the instinct now you have to be\nreally careful the instinct is going to\nbe let me adopt the streamer mode of\noperation\nyeah let me do things this way instead\nof doing things that way\nwhich is falling into the same [ __ ]\ntrap right because i've tried that\nyep there we go it's the same trap\ngoing to work just\nlet yourself sit in the sadness and\nacknowledge for a moment that you're\nallowed to be sad\nyou're allowed to be hopeless that\nthere's a part of you that wants very\nhard\nto take this suffering away from you\nand it is when we try to protect\nourselves from the suffering that life\ngives us\nthat we trap ourselves the most\nright because like when i'm when i am\nfeeling good\nlike those thoughts aren't even a factor\nif that makes so like during my\nday-to-day my appearance and how other\npeople perceive me is a is a factor that\ni'm constantly\nat war with yup in this cycle but when\ni'm\nfeeling my best that's not even a second\nthought because i'm not on camera\nuh i'm not i feel like i'm i'm separated\nyep if that makes sense yeah from those\nfrom what feels like realities\nso that separation comes from\nobservation\nso you can't be separate from something\nany\nanything that i observe must be separate\nfrom me the seer in the scene\ncannot be the same thing when i look at\nmyself in the mirror\nwhat am i looking at am i looking at\nmyself\nno you're looking at a reflection of\nyourself beautiful\nif you want to create separation connor\njust\nsee it and the separation will be there\nyou have told me that for you to be free\nof this thing\nyou need to be separate from it you\nspecified me by separate again separate\nyou tell me because you're the [ __ ]\none who said it\nyou said i'm trying to remember what i\njust said it was good so go back and\nwatch the bot\nbut basically you were telling me that\nwhen you're off camera\nyou're separate from these things these\nthoughts don't even affect you they're\nnot a factor\nright yeah right and so there there are\nmoments of time\nwhere you have vairagya\ndetachment separation viagra for a\nsecond\nit's not viagra okay\nthat's the sanskrit word for detachment\nwhen your thoughts are not reality\nthey're just thoughts\nand the way that you create that\nseparation is through observation\nnot trying to fix it because fixing it\nis getting into it\njust watching it happen and when you\nwatch it because like\nthis is me and then like if i see it\nlike\nit has to have distance\nso when i ask you to stop and observe\nthe urge\nand observe how you want to fix it it'll\nnaturally dwindle over time\nokay and what you guys see what you're\nsaying what you found is a shortcut\nto that dwindling process which was\nstreaming\nand now we get to the idea of an escape\nbecause when you're streaming you're\nyour true self\nand how does that work that's because\nyou're free from all of these thoughts\ni'm three i'm free from the physicality\ni'm free from like the\nfear of like actual consequence i guess\nbecause it's easier to\nfeel separate when i'm in front of a\nscreen i guess even though there is\nobviously more consequence now that i'm\nit's my career\nbut like especially when i first started\nlike when i first started streaming like\nit\nfelt like a complete disconnect yeah\nand so now now here's the cool thing so\nyou i think that that's\ntrue and at the same time you've found a\nsolution to this problem\nthat is not actually controlled by you\nit's a circumstantial solution right and\nthat's right\nthat's why people call it an escape so\nnow what you need to do is\nlearn how to separate yourself in every\nmoment of every day\nand then all of those cycles will start\nto fall apart\nsame thing needs to happen for all of\nthem doesn't matter notice the intrusive\nthought ah [ __ ] here we go again\nit's like if you're terrified of a\nroller coaster and you hate being on it\nyou might as well throw your hands up in\nthe air and scream and try to enjoy the\nride\nthat's what you need the intrusive\nthought comes\nthe urge comes here i go trying to fix\nit again\ncan i hold back from trying to fix it no\ni can't\nokay here we go there's me fighting\nthere's me fighting there's me fighting\nran out of mana oh there's that\nclinginess oh man that clinginess comes\nup\nthe sadness comes up the fear comes up\nyeah and then oh here i go texting oh\n[ __ ]\nhere i am judging myself for texting\nsure\nhere i am seeing yeah the thing about\nthat is like even like\nthat cycle is so prevalent that like\neven if i text something that almost\nis like completely fair and like isn't\neven\ndoesn't even come from a place of like\nreassurance\nimmediately after i become self-critical\nand that cycle starts well what if it\nwas what if\nwhat if your thought what if you didn't\neven realize that that was\na negative like a negative uh\nreassurance seeking right so then what\nyou do is you\nbefore you send the text message true\nconnor says\nall right we're about to send this and\nconor prepare yourself\nyou want to send this in this moment\nbecause you think things are going to\nget better\nprepare yourself for the backlash\nprepare yourself for cycle 2\nyou hit the text button there's the\nintrusive thought\nthere we go again yeah\njust like you said and watch it happen\nto yourself\nyou know it's coming watch it happen let\nit happen\nif you feel like fighting fight but\nfight with awareness\nand i guarantee you conor whatever\nyou've been doing for the past couple of\nmonths that's helped a little bit\nyou continue doing this mindful practice\nthis will start to dwindle away what did\nyou mean by fight with awareness\nexactly because i thought i was trying\nto not fight if you can't help\nbutt fight at least acknowledge that\nyou're fighting and that it's the wrong\nthing to do\nand let yourself do it okay\nyeah because the more awareness you\ncreate i'm not aware of anything what's\non my forehead i can't see\nin order to see it needs to be over here\nthis is awareness\nthis is bringing something when you're\nnot awareness\nis watching something from the outside\nso the more that you become aware the\nmore separation you create\nand then you become something called\ndetached\nwhich is when when you when you say it\nisn't a factor anymore\nthat is why so people like ask me like\ndon't you have sadness and all this kind\nof [ __ ] do i have anxieties and all that\nsort of stuff\nsure i'm no different from any of you\nguys the only difference\nis that it's not a factor yeah\nevery time i yeah go ahead that's like a\nkind of like that's sort of where i've\nbeen\nlearning like where i've been at over\nthe past few months that i talked about\nfrom listening to stuff with you like\nin terms of like spiritual kind of\nconsciousness or\nself versus thoughts like that's pretty\nmuch what you're saying\nand yep and so here's the cool thing\nwhat has happened to your suffering\nthe more you have become aware that\nthere is a consciousness that is\nseparate from your thoughts\num it's become easier\ni i've been able to observe\nthat the negative isn't necessarily\nobjective\nexactly right it's become easier\nso what i'm telling you is every moment\nof awareness\nis leveling up your consciousness and\nthe more your consciousness\nlevels up i kid you not this [ __ ] is op\nconor\nthis is what buddha was talking about\nwhen he was talking about enlightenment\nit is when awareness becomes a hundred\npercent all the time\nand then suffering ceases to exist\nsadness exists pain exists emotion\nexists\nhurt exists suffering does not\nyeah um yeah that makes sense\nit really does make sense\nbecause i can i can see like areas where\nthat's just yeah absolutely\nthere we go man questions\num i can't really think of any questions\ni\ni think i'm just going to like re-watch\nre-listen and try to like\napply is the main thing absolutely man\nit's a slow road\nso let me tell you one or two other\nthings how old are you connor i'm 21.\nokay so not young\nyet yeah i turned 21 two weeks ago okay\nso let me tell you this journey is going\nto take you a couple of years\nit's going to get better over time\ni don't know if you're ever truly going\nto be quote unquote free for from this\nbut i do think you can get free on a\nlevel that\nwill blow your mind i think part of it\nis like here's what i've come to\nunderstand is\neven the search to get better\nis an attachment\nand that to accept that you won't be\nbetter is actually like\na really really important milestone\nto accept or like accepting that like\nlike that isn't the objective i guess i\nmean it certainly is a objective and you\nshould try to get better\nbut even the chase to become better is\nonce again your desire you said it so\nbeautifully\ni want to fix it yeah that was what if\nyou talk to my uh\ntherapist that i've had since i was like\n16 like i've\ntold her that so many times over the\nyears like when i i'm not even 16 like\nprobably\n13 14. like i remember i would go like\ni'd not be able to go to class and i'd\njust be crying in their office like i\njust want to fix it i just want to be\nbetter\nso i can't describe it but i want to fix\nthis\nso oddly conor here's the real thing\nthat i hadn't really pieced together\ni think the source of this is not\nthe negative self-attitude it's your\nobsession to fix it\nthe thing which you think has been\nhelping you and you've been\ndumping all your points into it level up\nis actually the thing that's trapping\nyou\nlet it be\naccept it for what it is because when\nyou let it be there\nit's not about fixing it it's about not\nletting it be a factor\nand when i ask you i mean if you said it\nso beautifully like it's still\nthere it's just not a factor you don't\neven need to fix it\nright it's the obsession to fix\nwhich ties us up the most\nyeah no that's\nthat everything that you said clicked\ntoday but like that was like really like\nit's almost like an easy way to\nencompass all of it\nthat makes sense like the entire\nillustration you're trying to make\nand the idea of separation\num the way you describe the fixing it\nthing kind of\nclicks on a more basic level i think\nmakes sense to me so now i'll ask you so\ni'll test you connor\nand now notice the anxiety rise because\noh my god you're gonna get tested\nis it there i'm kinda i'm\ni'm pretty confident that i'm\nunderstanding a good thing whether or\nnot i can put words to it\ni forgot my question\nokay here's something i want to\nunderstand so conor\nwhat is it that we're trying to fix\ntoday\num well i was trying to fix\nin the end i was trying to fix that i\nwas trying to fix stuff\nthat makes sense yeah so another way\nto say that i think is in a sense\nabsolutely nothing\nright right and that's hard to like it's\neasy to misconstrue that in my head and\nbe like well i'm does that mean i'm not\ntrying to get better but no it's just\nthat\nthat that entire drive\nof just constant overthinking constant\nwhat do i do\nwhat is this that why i do this is\nis causing the loop absolutely so so now\nwe can see now you said it they just\nconnected it for me right so if we think\nabout it\nwhat is your ocd always trying to do\nget reassurance and to\nget fix a problem absolutely that's why\nyou send the text\ngotta fix it gotta fix it gotta fix it\ngotta fix it gotta fix it\nyeah gotta make it better gotta take it\naway can't keep doing this\nthe very opposite of acceptance\nand so you get tied up worse and worse\nand worse and worse because your\nantidote is the poison\nyeah yeah\nyour antidote is the poison of your life\nwas that from is that that was from\nsomething\nit sounded like it was like that's why\nit's like\ni thought you were making a reference i\nwas like oh\nit's like it's this like zen wisdom kind\nof stuff that's full of pain what you're\nsaying yeah\ni was trolling myself because i deserve\nto be trolled\nwhen i speak like that\nokay so i sort of taught you a\nmeditative practice today do you feel\ncomfortable with that\num so what what is that\nwhat kind of meditative process does\nthat call it if i wanted to like look\nthat up and\ni mean that that in and of itself is not\nlike a particular practice it's just\nbecause i think you've already\ncultivated some awareness\nyeah so it's just creating that\nawareness of allowing the\nnegativity and yep observe like\nobserving isn't the right yeah so i\nthink the closest thing is actually\nmindfulness so i rarely teach\nmindfulness\non stream this is a mindfulness practice\nof what's traditionally known as\nmindfulness\nwhich is like in your case i think\nyou've actually you've spent so much\ntime in your head i don't need to teach\nyou how to be in your head\nyou've actually learned how to see those\nthings\nso all i'm telling you to do is like you\ncan use a particular\nobject to evoke that process in a\ncontrolled fashion\nit's almost like an exposure therapy in\nyour mind\nyeah right and and i'm not surprised\nthat exposure therapy worked well for\nyou because i think you have the\ntemperament\nfor mindfulness because like you're able\nto see things within yourself and i'd\nsay just like look in the mirror like\nyou got to be careful because you don't\nwant to let it\ngo too wild right so once again you\ndon't want to like\npush yourself to look in the mirror\nevery day like i'm gonna look in the\nmirror\ni'm gonna fix this\nthat's gonna be falling into the same\ntrack whenever you can just look in the\nmirror and like\ndo it for three or four minutes let\nthose thoughts come up\nand notice them take a deep breath and\nthen walk away\nthere's a chance that your day is\ntorpedoed for the rest torpedo possum\nand if it is let yourself be torpedoed\nno that makes sense yeah\ncool man this has helped this is this is\nhelpful\nother people too yeah yeah i i don't\nknow how much of it i wasn't really\nwatching but\num you know\ni mean hopefully i i don't know how far\nin the weeds we were and how applicable\nthat was to other people\nyeah i mean that was the big thing is\nlike i wanted to help myself but like i\ni really want to make sure that like\nothers like if anybody else can get\nsomething out of that\nand like not go down an eight year\nand maybe get a little bit you know get\nthere a little bit faster\nthan that that's what yeah that's good\nyeah cool man\nwell thanks a lot for coming on man\nand no problem i'm down again anytime\nokay\nyeah so so you know try this out for a\nlittle while and continue watching\nyourself\nif you want to learn a formal meditation\npractice you know you're welcome to do\nwhatever else we do on stream i think\nall that stuff will help\nit'll train your mind but i think in\nyour case\nreally as you can try to grapple with\nwith this beast inside you from time to\ntime\nand okay you know expose it to you\nyour non-judgmental self and then i\nthink you'll start to get i mean you'll\ncontinue to get better because you've\nstarted to get better\nand for what it's worth i think it's\nreally awesome that you have tried so\nhard and have been in treatment because\ni think that's certainly very helpful\ntoo\nyeah and like every time i talk about\nthe day like it's it's a lot\nand like i almost like feel myself after\nlike well i want to make sure i get it\nall and understand\nbut like that's part of what you're\ntalking about is kind of beautiful\nacting on that\nthat's exactly what i'm saying so now\ni'm confident you've understood\nyeah you want to fix it you want to make\nsure you got everything you needed to\nbecause then you'll fix it faster right\nbut see\nalready you're noticing oh like there it\nis again\nyou see how pervasive it is and since\nit's pervasive it affects all\navenues of your life\nyep good fantastic man awesome good luck\ndo you want to just tell us\na little bit about your stream and stuff\num oh i'm just\nuh i just play video games and i try to\nmake people laugh\num give you know that's all i really do\num\ni uh play with friends a lot of time i'm\nprobably friends i'm friends with a lot\nof the\nbigger streamers that have been on here\nbefore like pokey miz\nuh uh blair uh cutie um\neverybody like that so uh people\nprobably see me around but\ni just play video games that's my main\nthing\nand and it's conor eats pants yes\nthat was i made that name just so people\nwould remember it\nthere's no history there it's just yep\nall right man well best of luck to you\nconnor seriously i mean that\nand i i think i think you're on a good\njourney and i think in a couple of years\nyou'll be in a really good spot man\nthank you bye thank you bye\nokay chat"
