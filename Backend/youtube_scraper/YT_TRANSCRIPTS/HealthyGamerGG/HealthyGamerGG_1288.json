    "transcript": "yeah so a couple of things just a brief\nannouncements for before we hop in with\ntrain one is that our coaching program\nactually launched on friday\nand just a reminder that coaching is not\nmedical advice so it's not like\ntreatment or therapy it's actually like\nsupporting you and moving forward\nso issues like playing too many video\ngames um working on your motivation your\nrelationships laziness things like that\nfeeling socially isolated negative\nthought patterns\num these are the kinds of things that\nour coaches work with and\nspecifically what i wanted to talk to\nyou guys about because we haven't really\nshown this group coaching i think is\nreally really effective\ni think it's interesting because on\nstream you know we do a lot of\nindividual work\nbut i i don't know if you guys could\nkind of get this from friday's stream\nbut\nthe cool thing about a group is how can\ni say this so when i'm working with a\nperson individually\nit's hard to make them see their biases\nright what's actually really really\neffective and i think part of the reason\nthat group coaching is so effective\nis that when you see your problems\nin another person it is way easier to\nanalyze and figure them out so like when\nyou hear someone else talk about\nprocrastination\nin a bizarre way you're free from all of\nyour own issues so you\nsee how they struggle with\nprocrastination and then you\nlearn a lot more from it so group\ncoaching is sort of this idea that like\nyou know we get a group of y'all\ntogether and then you guys kind of go\nthrough this process\ntogether there's also um sort of this\nidea that like you know when we're\ntrying to figure out a problem\neach of y'all is gonna have one piece of\nthe puzzle so in a weird way it can\nactually be\nwhile it isn't quite as specific to you\nyou can actually learn a lot from your\ncolleagues\nand there's also an added advantage to\ngroup which is that you can actually\nhelp\nother people which i cannot\nunderestimate the value of there are\nthousands of people that need help\nand we think that group is kind of like\neffective because you know you can\nsupport your peers you can learn from\neach other we can help more people\nso if you guys are kind of curious i\nwould highly encourage you all check out\ngroup coaching\ngive me just there we go wow how you\ndoing train\ngood how are you good man\ni like the aesthetic of your place man\nvery black and white\nand clean thank you\nkobe's really uh pushed me back on the\ncleanness but like to me this is dirty\nreally dirty\nbut you know oh wow\nwhat have you been having been good\nhow are you good good you know just uh\nyou know uh yeah you know\njust uh just woke up and\nyeah you know yeah what part of the are\nyou in the u.s\nyeah i'm in uh texas oh you're in texas\nyeah we're in texas austin downtown\naustin cool i spent many a year in texas\nreally yeah i mean in austin i mean i'm\nfrom texas\nbut i i really like undergrad at ut\noh that's so cool yeah i'm from arizona\nso\nthat that's where i live my whole life\nyeah scottsdale\nyeah okay yeah cool\num so yeah there's something in\nparticular you want to er are we\ni'm calling you tyler or train whatever\nyou like\nif anything goes anything works um so\nanything in particular you wanted to\ntalk about today\ni think no i think we just do a\ncontinuation you know\nlike a part one part two part three part\nfour part five you know\ndiving deep you know you know each\nsession we go deeper down\nor whatever you call this you know\ndeeper down into what\nthe abyss it's like where are we going\nman\ni'm gonna grab my coffee okay\nwe're we're diving deep chat\ndeeper down deeper deeper\nall right i'm back all right man wow wow\nwhat\nyou know since since i just woke up i\nstill have burning sensation in my eyes\ndoes that make sense\nsort of you have tried i'm not awake yet\nno maybe i'm not sure but it's it's as\nif\ni'm still tired my body's awake\nmy mind's awake my eyes are not does\nthat make sense\nlet me think about that\nburning yeah it's like\nwell hmm it's not burning it's like\nlet me think about this so let's see i\nwake up oh\nyou know my eyes are indicating that i\nneed to go i need to close them and\nsleep\nbut my body and mind are awake i think\nit's nyquil i took that i took\ni took nyquil last night ah i think it's\nnyquil does that make sense\ni'm a little drowsy still yeah right\nyeah yeah yeah\nnyquil will lead to dry eyes actually\nreally\nyeah oh wow\nthat explains a lot if i remember\ncorrectly nyquil has something called\nanticholinergic effects\nwhich dry you out so they cause\nconstipation sometimes urinary retention\ndry eyes dry mouth dry nose\nright that's sometimes why it helps so\nthat would\nif you took nyquil may have something to\ndo with it\nyeah damn yeah well how have you been\nhow are you going coven good so i\nactually was thinking\nuh yeah i mean things are good i think\nuh\nyou know things are sort of like we i\nmoved to texas during covet actually\nso yeah so at first i just came down\nhere temporarily but then\ncovet never ended so now i'm just here\nwell you're in texas right now\nyeah are you in austin houston houston\noh\nnice very good so i i i was\nyeah good i was like born grew up in\ntexas so\nback home to texas boy yeah man\nabsolutely\ncool is houston more like cowboy hat\ncowboy boot spurs\ncause well i mean austin austin is well\nyou can have cowboy hats in order texas\nlet me tell you what but\naustin is really it's like it's like all\nthe liberals are down there you know\nwhat i mean\nit's true it's like a tiny amount of the\nnortheast or the west coast\nright in the heart of texas yeah yeah\nit's it's\nit's a little piece of california in\ntexas yeah\nyeah a lot of hippies and you know just\npeople experimenting with\ndifferent things and yeah living freely\nand\nyeah yeah you know all those all those\nthings man\nyeah yeah i would even say maybe like\nyou know i watch some vampire movies\ntv series you know like vampire diaries\nright or like the originals\nand and these things take place in like\nnew orleans right\ni would say what's that one district\ncalled the new orleans where there's\nlike mardi gras and stuff\nthe french quarter the french quarter\nyeah i would say there's a little bit of\nfrench quarter\nin austin right i feel like i could walk\ndown the street get my fortune told\nwhile there was like a witch\nperforming a ritual vampire\ntalking about yeah you could certainly\nget your fortune told in austin for sure\noh for sure yeah um i i've heard it's\nchanged a lot but back when i was you\nknow\ni mean yeah i don't know if the keep\naustin weird is still a thing\noh it's yes very much so yeah that was\nyou know that was before a bunch of\npeople moved in but i'm glad it's still\na thing\nso train yeah um one question that i had\nkind of\nlast time is is you know you'd mentioned\nyour parents a couple of times\nand and i just i was looking at some of\nthe notes that i had taken from our\nlast talk and it seemed like we hadn't\num you know we talked a lot about sort\nof the effects of their upbringing but\nwe hadn't really talked much about\nthem or what it was like to grow up um\nyou'd kind of mentioned to me that you\nknow you studied biochem\nand your of iranian descent yeah\nand and so there were kind of i sort of\nfelt like you had mentioned a couple\nthings and we could make assumptions\nabout what those sorts of things meant\nlike in terms of the value system that\nyou were brought up with and things like\nthat but i was\nactually kind of curious if if you could\ntell us more\nyeah so um\nyeah um hmm\nsorry i have to okay so before we get to\nthat\nsure we gotta do a\nhmm what can i i gotta warm the juice so\nmy brain is like right now here's where\ni'm at mentally\nokay okay so you buy a new computer\nokay turns on instantly right\neverything's ready to go\nright and then after\nabout five years of doing various things\nin that computer you know\nit could be anything right it starts\nslowing down you start turning it on you\nhave three different startup processes\nyou know and things are just taking\nforever right you end up blue screening\ngoing back to the restart\nthat's where i'm at right now okay so i\ngotta i gotta get i gotta get the juices\nflowing before we get into that you know\nso okay so\nyeah um\nlet me think about this where can we\nstart that i'll get my\nyou know brain where it needs to be hmm\ngreat question one that i think you'll\nhave the answer to\nyeah have you played among us have you\ntried that game\nno it's a really good game what's it\nwhat kind of game is it\nso there's like there's 10 players\nand you load into a map\nand the map has various tasks that you\ndo and the objective of the game\nis there's two imposters but they don't\ntell you who the impostors are they're\nrandomly selected at the start of the\nmap\nno one can talk and you go around the\nmap\nand you have to like study people's\nbehavior study people's\nyou know you know have a good sense of\ndeception\nand you know be able to perceive when\npeople are lying or not\ni don't perceive the right word there\nbut anyways it's really really fun\nreally good\num but yeah i suggest you play with\npeople that don't take it personally\nbecause you know if you end up lying to\nthem or you end up calling them out\nonline\nhow do you lie if there's i think you\nsaid there's no communication\nso there's communication um in between\neach round so if i if i'm imposter and i\nkill somebody and let's say an innocent\nperson finds the body they can call it\nand then we all tell our locations they\nask questions and we all play it off as\nif we didn't kill it\nand then people have to figure out\nthrough the clues and consistencies\nand and and like contradictions and\nstories of who the killer is does that\nmake sense\nyeah yeah yeah sounds so it's really fun\nit's a really good game yeah if no if no\none cheats but you know i've\nyou know me and xbc have caught some\npeople uh\nso since the different since everyone\nhas a chat and different chats can go\ninto each person's stream\nthey can see on the screen who the\nimposter is and\nright so a lot of people i don't know\nwhy but they read their chat while\nthey're\ninnocent crew members so they're told\nthat they're you know it's\nit's terrible but it that's a very low\npercentage of blood do it but\nyou know hacks yeah it's like yeah\nyeah are you pretty good at being\ndeceptive\nyou know\nit was actually one of my worries of\nstarting the game so\nwith where i'm at so i'm a very paranoid\nperson\nvery paranoid okay so like i'm talking\nparanoid to the point where\nyou know other students can tell you you\nknow i had slicker and john zurka here\nin austin\nand i took them to dinner and before i\nhad any conversation at all\ni made them put their phones in the\nmiddle airplane mode\nthen i had them stand up in the middle\nof the restaurant this is a nice\nrestaurant i took them to\nstand up i patted them down for a\nsecondary device\nand then we sat down and talked so i'm\nvery paranoid as is\nlike some cia type stuff now\ni was worried about starting the game\nbecause everyone's been asking me to\nplay the game for so long i've been kind\nof just\nignoring it not wanting to play just\navoiding it because i knew that this\ngame is going to lead me down one of two\nroads\nit's either gonna lead me down the road\nwhere i'm very bad at it\nand it fits every narrative that i'm\nterrible at games\nor i'm very good at it and it's going to\nbe used as a\nas a credibility against the negative\nimperative of i'm a manipulating\nterrible evil person right so\nsince i'm like that character in each of\nthese narratives i was scared\nthere it was a lose-lose for me to play\nthe game but fortunately\ni've been pretty good at it and no one's\ngone that down that road but that was\ndefinitely something me and my community\nwere laughing about along with my other\nstreamers that are friends\num so yeah it was definitely a fun time\nthough\nso yeah i mean i don't know if i'm good\nat being deceptive but it's it's\ni like puzzles i like puzzles so i'm\ngonna i'm gonna puzzle games i think\ni don't know i could be wrong okay\ndoes that make sense sure i mean it's so\ninteresting so i asked you\na question and then you gave me a lot of\nstuff\nyeah and and interestingly enough i i\ndon't even know if i got an answer to\nthe question\nbut boy did you give me some juicy\nmorsels\nlike what's up with the paranoia who is\nslicker\nslicker and john are two streamers on\ntwitch\nand i met them on oh go ahead\nare you bad at games\nand what's up with with feeding into the\nnarrative that you're\nevil are you where does that you seem\nlike a decent guy to me man\nreally authentic yeah\nbut i think i think you can see through\na lens\nof like wisdom and maturity and like\nmore like you know\njust a more i don't want to call it an\nobjective lens because i don't think\ngood or bad is\nnecessarily the subjective thing i mean\nit is but it's not i don't know what it\nis but it seems like you can see me\nnot for i mean i'm sure\ninitially from first impr the point is\nhere's what i've so [ __ ] um excuse my\nlanguage by the way um\nokay so how do we do this so it starts\nall the way back\nin middle school high school okay this\nis when i first learned about this\ni was totally oblivious and ignorant to\nthis because i didn't know it existed\nokay so in middle school in high school\ni was\nbullied a lot not physically though it\nwas psychologically\nand in my time you know i'm a 1990 baby\npsychologically\nwas never taken seriously\npsychologically was i come from the time\nof sticks and stones and hurt your bones\nbut words cannot hurt you they'd laugh\nat that if someone called you dumb or\nwhatever\nor worse things you're like who cares\nright\nso we'll skip middle school for now\nin high school i moved schools i moved\ncities we moved\nand i walked into school and from day\none\ni was like just heavily mentally like\npsychologically bullied heavily by\neverybody and i didn't know why\nand i'll spare you the entire story\nlet's get to the end\nsenior year high school\ni confront my bully okay i'm at a point\nin my life where\ni've gotten to a you know\ni'm in english class with him and\nhe punches me in the back the english\nteacher is this football coach that and\nhe's on the football team\nand basically he gets away with it i get\nkicked out because the teachers\ni think reliving his high school\nexperience that he wanted to have back\nwhen he was in high school\nthrough being a football coach now so\nthis weird thing where they're teaming\nup and\nyou know smiling at each other like got\nsome deal together weird stuff\nso anyways i'm pissed off i just had to\nconfront him\nand the truth comes out apparently the\nreason\nhe and the football team bullied me so\nmuch is because they\nthought they needed to bring me down a\nnotch they said when i\nfirst walked into the school as the new\nkid\nthat they thought that i thought\ni ran the place because of my demeanor\nbecause of how i looked because of how i\ntalked and because of the aggressive\nlook i have\nso they felt they needed to bring me\ndown right\nand when i heard this it started\nclicking in so many different like\nfriend groups and spots i started\nbringing this up and asking if this was\nthe case\nand it ended up being the case almost 99\nof the time there's always\nso my case is is that you\nyour physical presence makes you come\nacross as\nit's it's confidence or arrogant i don't\nknow if it's the physical presence i\nthink it's a mixture of like my face\nlike i have like very protruding\nstructure like you know it's where the\nnickname ape comes from like my whole my\nentire thing ape gang or you know\nuh the gorilla it comes from people say\ni have these like protruding bone\nstructures you know i have a\nmy side view you know i have like a\nbuilt-in umbrella when it rains i don't\nneed an umbrella\nyou know my forehead is the umbrella\nright\nand then i have these like dark black\neyes that like stare you know\npeople describe my eyes in my stream as\nsomeone that's been through six\ndifferent wars\nand is like going through an active\nepisode of ptsd\nand thinking of all the kills and deaths\ni went through like that that's like\ndescribe my eyes right\nand then i have a deep voice that\ndoesn't help at all\nand doesn't right help with what is it\nwhat does it not help with the view that\nyou're\nlike this i don't know i think upon i\nmean\ni've talked to like my friends about\nthis too like my friends that like i'm\nactually cool and stuff\nand they said like initially they felt\nthe same and even every day they do\nthey feel like it doesn't it doesn't\nhelp with\nso i'm a very passionate person so i\nhave to and\nmy mom's always told me i have to be\nvery very careful when i get excited\nbecause it's not like a normal person's\nexcited where you can tell they're just\nhaving fun\ni sound like i'm about to go to war\nright so when i jump at someone and say\noh i don't believe this no you're wrong\nit sounds like we're about to go to into\nlike a viking\nyou know versus gladiator russell crowe\nwar right\nwe're talking like you know heads\nchopped off type of war right so\nall these different things go into this\nbut on the inside\nyou know i just love you know just love\nbut on the outside people see\nwar but the inside it's not the case\nright so\ni don't know what's it like to be\nperceived like that\nto be viewed as a viking when inside\nyou're a poet\nwell\ni don't know i think the biggest\nthe biggest challenge of it all\nis i think\nmost the time where others will get the\nbenefit of the doubt\ni have to work uphill because i won't\nget the benefit of the doubt\nright so i have to like work uphill and\noh that's why i'm paranoid all the time\ni feel like i need to always be ahead\none step ahead\ni feel like i have to always watch my\nback and be one step ahead of people\ntrying to like do whatever\nbecause i know when something happens\nright the only person that's going to be\nthere i don't know\ndoes that make any sense like i feel\nlike i need to be ahead of it because\nthe benefit of the doubt won't be the\nonly person the only person that's gonna\nbe there is who well me\nhow long have you felt that way\nprobably since like the bullying started\nmiddle\ni would i think that actually i you know\nthis this is going to sound really weird\nbut this is going to sound very weird\nbut i\nalmost i'm almost kind of\nhappy that i went through what i went\nthrough in middle school in high school\nno matter you know when i think back to\nit if i told you the story i'd probably\ntear up\nbut i'm kind of happy it wasn't the\nother way around i think it was the\nother way around if\ni just either lived a normal one or i\nwas accepted\ni wouldn't be who i am today and i\nwouldn't have the confidence as i do\nright because i don't know\ndoes that make any sense yeah i i think\nsort of\ni i think it makes a lot of sense that\ni think a lot of people myself included\nfeel like our challenges and our\ndifficulties\nare what make us who we are today which\ni think it's really hard for people to\nunderstand while you're in the middle of\nit\nright like i remember when i was 18 or\n19\nand trying really hard to get a\ngirlfriend and all i wanted\nmore than anything else in the world\na girlfriend and at the same time i\nthink that that was a really\ntransformative and important period for\nme that allowed me to then engage\nin you know healthier relationships down\nthe road\nbecause i had to learn a lot about\nmyself and like what\njust just how bad i was with women\nand that's how you learn right oh 100\nbelieve me\nand and so that's that's just part of it\num and so i can understand where you're\ncoming from at the same time it's it's\nhard to really\nfully understand because what i'm\nhearing from you is that there are some\nvery formative and important experiences\nthat you're actually kind of skipping\nover\nright so you'll give us a lot of\nconclusions but i i don't really know\nthe story so you kind of said you\nconfronted your bully\nand then what came out dot dot dot was\nthat essentially it sounds like they\nwere intimidated by you\nand and so so that i mean you you keep\non referencing middle school and you\nkind of\njump to the end of the story like but\nit's hard to really\nfully understand what you mean because\nyou're kind of glossing over like the\nbeginning in the middle well\nit's because i i wanted to save you the\ni\num okay so by no means do i\nso what i'm going to say next by no\nmeans am i meaning to\nsay since everyone now has a story that\nall of them don't mean much anymore or\nyou know i'll just say i just wanted to\nskip through because i feel like\nthese days\nsee these these are the takes that i say\nthat i think also attribute\nthey attribute to it so like it's not\nentirely this passive thing that\ni'm that that isn't my fault\nsome like takes they\ntake so like my perspective\nyeah my perspective on so okay the\nreason the reason i wanted to skip and\nget to the conclusion is because\nokay this is gonna be a hot take and\nthis is exactly\nwhat gets me in trouble so i will take\nresponsibility for this completely\nbut i wanted to skip through it\nbecause i feel like every story nowadays\nstarts with uh i was bullied\nright and\nfrom my experience in my school now i\nknow there's millions of schools\neverywhere but for my husband's school\nthe bullied was a very small percentage\nand we all knew each other all from\ndifferent groups but we all had\na spot it was almost like a movie like\nan action superhero movie where\nwe came together in a bathroom and we\nin public we weren't friends but in\nprivate we had like consoling each other\nwhat's the word is a consolidated consul\nwhatever right\nso i know that statistically based on\nwhat i see\nwhen i talk to other people that share\nthe same experiences that\nevery single individual that's saying\nthat now it can't be the case so now i\njust feel like it's like\nthis cheap thing to say where i was\nbullied so instead of going through the\nentire story\ni just wanted to skip i just want to\nstart with you know that and then skip\nto the conclusion to what i learned from\nit and what i gained from it and that's\nit\ni don't want to like waste people's time\nand telling a story that they've heard a\nmillion times from it\nit just seems like the same i don't know\ndoes that make any sense i think it just\nmake sense i just\ndisagree so i i think i think the\nconclusion\ni mean someone can hear the conclusion\nbut i don't think that's what really\nhelps someone understand\nokay i think understanding comes from\nthe story and you say like oh\nlike just because everyone else is\nbullied like i think that's kind of\nimportant right everyone has\ntheir story to tell you're right\ncompletely\num okay then i'll say i just did i just\nokay there's a certain there's like\ncertain things i try\nto stay away from why\nokay so for example i'll give you an\nexample to what i mean by this because i\ncan't get it into words and it sounds\nreally bad\nso for example um\nwith like my with my bipolar stuff right\nit's it's a very new thing like some\nsome individuals in my community knew\nabout this five six years ago\nbut it's a very like new thing that a\nlot of people don't know about\nbecause i was raised in an era where\neven though you have this and even\nthough it may be responsible for\nsome of the ways you may treat people\nyou still have to take responsibility\nfor it and never should you\nnever should it come out of your mouth\nthat oh i oh you did this terrible thing\noh well i bipolar that's why so either\naccept it\ntake it or don't talk to me like i i've\nbeen taught\nnot to do that take responsibility right\nlook inside and\nfind a better way to manage it instead\nof crutching on this excuse that i have\nthis\nso since i'm brought up that way i never\nbring that up i try not to i feel like\nblaming it on it\nis isn't something for others if i want\nto if i know it's that then i have to\nwork that much harder\naround people to make that work it's not\nthat they have to work harder to make it\nwork i need to work harder\nknowing that i have that so i always\nraise them this way whereas i feel like\nmost people these days are raising the\nother way where others if they want to\nbe in the presence of greatness tyler\nthey need to work around my\nbipolar and they need to do better right\ni'm i was i was\nborn i was raised the opposite yeah i\nneed to do better don't crush on it\ndon't use it as excuse right\nso because of these things i don't have\nthis\nlike i feel like when i talk about a\nbullied experience or i bring up a\nmental\ndisorder i'm now pitying myself\nand it's this very shameless cheap thing\nto do and it's like this\nweek no i don't want to say week weeks\nnot i wasn't really use the words man\nbut i i just\nyou understand what i'm saying tyler\ni'll say the words\nso some people use mental illness as an\nexcuse for being [ __ ]\nyes i'll say it\nokay great so yeah i think it's a huge i\nwas raised to take responsibility\nso i think people need to take\nresponsibility for their mental illness\ni'll i'll say i'm a [ __ ] psychiatrist\nmy job is to help people take\nresponsibility for the things that like\nhold them back\nthat's why i feel bad telling a bull so\ni bring that example up because\nwhen i give the story i feel like people\naren't\ngiving it the bully story they're not\ngiving the story of oh i was bullied\nas a way to explain i've been through\nthat i understand you because i\nunderstand me it shaped\nme in this way i went through this i get\nit people bring that story up\nas a ticket out as a pity\nso i i try to skip that story because\nthat's the way it's perceived by mostly\nbut let me explain something to tyler\nthis is exactly why you need to tell a\nstory\nbecause there's a there's a narrative\nwhich i agree with by the way\nof absolving people of individual\nresponsibility because of certain things\nthat happened to them\nand i think some of that is fair like\ndon't get me wrong so like i have a\npolicy where like\nyou know if i'm seeing a patient i need\na 24-hour notice for a cancellation\notherwise like they get billed for it\nyou know\nand and so but there are some exceptions\nthat i make for that right so if you're\nlike\nactively in a depressive episode that\nwas not there\na day or two ago and you miss your\nappointment for reasons for your health\ni won't bill you for it so i certainly\nmake allowances\nbut what i try really hard not to do\nis to let people use their illness as an\nexcuse to not grow\nas a person because i don't think that\nactually helps them i'm here to help\nthem\nnot to cater to a narrative that keeps\nthem\nin place and sometimes that means giving\npeople allowances\nand sometimes it doesn't you know so\nbasically what i do when a patient\ndoesn't show up for an appointment\ni'll ask them the next week like hey\nwhat happened\ndo you have a good excuse and then if\nthey say yes\nwon't bill them so be it i trust you if\nthe depression got too much\nand you couldn't even email me no big\ndeal\ni'm glad you showed up this week but\nit's also like\ndid you just stay up too late playing\nvideo games\nand not wake up on time\nif so then you don't get to use your\ndepression as a as a pass\nand i do see this i mean i hate to say\nit but i see it a lot where\nyou know there's even there's even a\nterm for it in in the medical field\nwhich is something called\nsecondary gain so it's when someone uses\ntheir\nillness to like get something and we\nknow that people people\nhave been doing this since the beginning\nof psychiatry as a field\nand i mean the really tricky thing is\nfor some people they use it as an excuse\nand for some people it's actually an\nimpairment and to be honest for\npeople who use it as an excuse there's a\nreally fascinating\nstatistic so there's this thing called a\npseudo-seizure\nwhich is a fake seizure it's not really\na fake it's just a non-epileptic seer\nso it's like when someone acts like\nthey're sort of having a seizure but\nthey're not\nactually like there's nothing going on\nin their brain in terms of like\nelectrical activity that would cause a\nseizure\nthe really interesting thing is that\npeople who it's almost like a it's\ncalled a psychogenic seizure\nsome people think about it like a fake\nseizure although i think that's a little\nbit\nunfair but it's not a seizure resulting\nfrom like\nrampant electrical activity in your\nbrain\ncan you guess what percentage of people\nwho have psychogenic seizures\nalso have real seizures\nthis is the simplest question ever and\ni'm overthinking it like usual sure\njust toss out a number what percentage\nof people who have quote unquote fake\nseizures also have real seizures\nzero nope it's about fifty percent\nokay i was gonna say fifty first then a\nhundred that then i cheated off chat\nyeah don't listen to chat don't listen\nto chat\nso it's interesting because people who\nactually exhibit\ndisplays of psychogenic seizures half of\nthem have real seizures too\nso something goes on in the mind where\nlike we sort of\nrecognize like like citing mental\nillness has now become\nwhat sometimes is viewed as an excuse\nbut i think really what that is\nis it's like it's a way of people\nit's a way of signaling like hey i need\nhelp\nor like i don't want you to judge me for\nthis\ni feel bad about it but i don't want you\nto judge me because i'm already judging\nmyself\nthat's what i really see a lot is that\npeople will cite mental illness when\nthey\ncan't it's almost a protective shield\nfor them against themselves because if\ni'm a [ __ ] up\nthat's hard to deal with but if i cite\nmy mental illness then that's easier for\nme to deal with\nbecause then it's not my fault but i do\nthink sometimes people absolve\nthemselves of responsibility and i'm not\nsaying like i'm trying to be insensitive\nto people with mental illness i mean i\nlike i just i think it genuinely holds\nthem back which is why like\nyou don't want to just you know say like\nyeah man it's okay like you don't you\nknow you know\ni trust them i tell them hey do you have\na good reason\nis it really illness why you didn't show\nup and if you say yes\ni'm gonna choose to believe you but if\nyou just [ __ ] up like because if you\nhave mental illness you can [ __ ] up too\nit doesn't make you imperfect it's not\nlike\nwhen you get to [ __ ] up just like\neveryone else does\nnot everything has to be because of your\ndepression\nyou can be a lazy [ __ ] and be\ndepressed and a lazy [ __ ] and not be\ndepressed\ndo i think the people with depression\ndeserve more compassion\nno do they do i think they deserve more\nallowance\nsure\nyeah i agree with that completely what\ni'm saying\nand i agree with everything you said i\nthink it applies to what i'm saying as\nwell and i i think to\ntake it one step further what i'm saying\nis so\nif something is a result of my bipolar\nright i know it\nis i was like\ni will take the l for that right that's\nwhat i'm trying to say so i'm not trying\nto say like\nyes and no yeah so so like just just a\nthing about that so like train i\ni respect where you're coming from and i\nthink that like you know just to be\nclear\ni think that if you have bipolar it's\nyour responsibility to manage it\nand at this same time what i tend to do\nis if you do everything that you can to\nmanage it\nand it still doesn't sometimes get\nmanaged that's not your fault\nright so what i judge people for is not\nwhat happens\ni judge them for what they do\nso if if someone shows up to my office\nlike every week and they're in treatment\nthey're taking medication like they're\nsupposed to or whatever\nand then one week they don't show up\nbecause they get depressed and they\ncan't get out of bed like that's not\ntheir fault\ni don't judge them for that i give them\nan allowance for that\ni like that and at the same time\nif they're not showing up and doing\ntheir work like i don't care whether\nthey\nlike you know they're allowed to miss\nappointments the question is like are\nthey doing what they're they're supposed\nto and they\ndo do they do it for the right reason if\nthe illness got the better of you that's\nthe way illness works you deserve a\nbreak\nright like we don't blame people for\ngetting the flu it's like [ __ ] you\nyou got the flu [ __ ] you you got\nhospitalized for covid for a month\nand you stood me up on our second date\nit's like\nf you know cut people some slack i will\ni will say if you get the flu\nhey stay at home yeah these guys keep\ngoing they keep going in the gym\ntouching everything you know terrible no\nbut i completely agree with you\nthat that's actually very good that's a\ngood take a good example yeah and i i\nthink you know sometimes\nthere's also this interesting thing\ntrain i don't know exactly what's going\non here but like you you seem to be\njudged a lot\nright so you're like you're trying not\nto say these things which i think are\nlike important to say because i\ngenuinely think when people use mental\nillness\nis an excuse it doesn't\nhelp them move forward is it a debuff\nabsolutely does it sometimes [ __ ] with\nyour life absolutely do you need more\nsupport\ndo you deserve more support absolutely\nand at the same time don't use it as an\nexcuse because it doesn't help\nyeah i agree i completely agree with\nthat\nalso i think uh i i think\nso in a perfect world everything you're\nsaying is completely right\nthe problem is\nwe live in a time right now not even now\nalways i think\ni think it's just it's become more aware\nand connected\nbecause of technology in the internet\nwhere we know what's going on\nfinally we now never aware it's not just\ngoing on in my town it's going on\neverywhere and it's this thing where\nthere's this impenetrable wall\nright metaphorically speaking so that\nwall\nit used to be within each of us and what\nthat wall does is\nlet's say i'm late to your meeting i\nknow i can use that secondary bipolar\nadvantage and say oh it's my bipolar dr\nk sorry i didn't mean to\nbe late it's the bipolar i'm so psyched\nto reschedule right\nnow if you call me and say i don't think\nit's the bipolar i think you're making\nan excuse in using it\nyou know normally oh you know i'll\nprobably hang up on you say screw you\nyou're not my doctor anymore then i'll\ngo into bed and depending on how i'm\nraised depending on\nmy morals values and how well i know\nmyself\neventually after two or three days of\npouting i'll realize holy [ __ ] he knows\nme better than\ni do i need to talk to him again call\nyou i apologize we see each other again\nnow in today's society with everything\nbeing connected\nthat wall has fortified itself stronger\nso now instead of having the time to sit\nin your thoughts\nknowing that that doctor that's called\nyou out on that is right\nnow you can find solace or whatever the\nword is\nin thousands of accounts that share the\nsimilar experience that cannot handle\nthe truth that you gave them\nand instead of facing it through\nself-reflection\nthey find comfort in others that further\nfuel their delusion that you are\nwrong and you're an [ __ ] and you\ndon't respect mental illness and it is\ntheir mental illness\nthat gets them away from everything and\nit further pushes people down this\ndelusion this\nwhole and no one gets better and\neveryone believes they have some\ndoes this make any sense this is what\ni've noticed in today's time\nso everyone thinks they seek the truth\nbut what they really seek\nis someone to tell them what they want\nto hear and label it the truth\nand that is why i think these truthful\nscenarios that we're talking about sure\nthey're\nthey work in a perfect world but it's\nnot this world people\ndoes that make any sense yeah so it\nmakes a lot of sense so here's what i\nheard you say\nthat like when when you get called out\nfor your behavior\nyou go into what i would call the\nwaiting arms of the internet\nyou go and you pry to your mommy in\ngeneral right you're\nyou as general yeah yeah so yeah like\nyou go\nthese people me included\ngo into the waiting arms of the internet\nwhere i post something on\nreddit and then i post the story from my\nperspective which is one perspective\nand then it gets upvoted because it's\njust one perspective\nand you'll see this like a lot in and\nyou know these\nthese subreddits that are like they're\nthey're not they're very transparent\nabout it they're like this is what we're\nabout\nyou you tell the story from one way and\nthen you get upvoted and it makes you\nfeel like you're right\nno one critically looks at your thoughts\nno one critically asks what happened on\nthe other side\nand so then you get vindication because\n10 000 strangers on the internet agree\nwith you\nthe interesting thing train is that i\nthink the solution there\nis so what people do is they look at the\ninternet and they look at the person\nand they blame them and they say this is\nbad that the internet should not be an\necho\nchamber and that's fair the interesting\nthing i think that that really i found\nis is in a subtle point which is\nsomething that i almost never do\nso in the scenario you described you\nsaid at some point dr k says\nhey i think you're lying i think you\nactually [ __ ] up and it's not your\nyour bipolar well like\nyeah i cut to the chase yeah yeah i i\nknow but i i think i think it's\nit's a good it's a good point because i\nthink this is really important\nyeah so i think the key thing here is\nthat it is\nnot for the person outside to\njudge whether something is an excuse or\nnot\nit is for it so if my patient\nsays hey yeah sorry it's my bipolar\ni choose to trust them because if i\ndon't trust them\nwhat happens is exactly what you\ndescribed\nso if i kind of attack them for their\nmental illness they're going to go and\nfind some way to like mentally deal with\nthat so i think the interesting thing\ni think this is this is where a lot of\npeople get i think stumble\nis that i don't think mental illness\nshould be an excuse but at the same time\ni do think there are far too many people\nwho\njudge people with mental illness\nas using as an excuse\ni think it has to be the person\nthemselves like you're the one who has\nto decide\nwhether your bipolar got the best of you\nor you got the best of your bipolar\nit can't be me it can't be other people\nbut\nbut here's the problem so\nthat only happens in my experience\nwith dealing with other people that have\nissues in myself\nin one of two ways one\neither you're raised by a\nyou know intel emotionally intelligent\nand you know\nuh uh you know whatever the other one is\nor\nwhat is the eq iq what's iq either\nyou're raised by a good\na good set of parents that will teach\nyou this as you grow up\nwill what will help you self-reflect\nwill you know talk to you and open you\nup and help you realize these things or\nyou learn it from experience because\nof the way your parents raised you\nbecause of the good set of morals they\ninstilled within you\nwhatever the case might be right i feel\nlike today\nthat's missing so what happens is\nwe're giving this benefit of doubt to\npeople\nthat i don't know if they were like it's\nnot and it's not their fault\nit feels like there's a responsibility i\nmean i guess i guess i'm kind of\ni'm talking way too general i guess i\ndon't have enough sample size but\nit seems like the methodology of\nraising has like changed it feels like\nthings are bulldozed more so than uh\nlike parents are bulldozing for their\nchildren more so than like\nyou know occasionally scooping with a\nshovel you know some [ __ ] out of the way\nit seems like it's a bulldoze miles and\nmiles ahead\nright and what this causes is this lack\nof accountability and responsibility\nwhich comes from that self-reflection so\ninstead of self-reflecting instead of\nlaying in bed and feeling guilty\nthat guilt is not there so when you find\ncomfort in finding others on the\ninternet that have gone through what\nyou've gone through\nit's that's the problem you you don't\nyou're not\nseeing it ever at any point as wrong and\nlearning from it so when you're giving\nthe benefit of the doubt it's not\nactually teaching them anything\nit's it's does this make any sense this\nis what i've noticed yeah\nuh just from observing does this make\nany sense yeah i i think it makes a lot\nof sense training and i find myself\nwondering i think that interestingly\nenough i think the most illustrative\nquestion then is how were you raised\nso instead of making general talking\nabout generalities and commenting on\nwhat you\nsee true show us\nright so you have a unique opportunity\nhere that you have an\nopportunity so you see something\nwe see something so show us\nshow us something different how were you\nraised\nokay so should we start excuse me i'm so\nsorry should we start with\nhow i was raised or we go back to the\nbully story and finish that fully\nfirst let's start i mean we're talking\nabout how people get raised so how did\nyou get raised\nokay before we start that can i use the\nrestroom sure real quick two seconds\ni'll be like i'll be like\n35 to 45 maybe 50 seconds\nmaybe even less actually 20 seconds i\ndon't know i'll run okay\ni'll be quick and i'll wash my hands\ni'll be right back okay\nhector the [ __ ] is this conversation\neither he's got urinary tension from the\nnyquil or he's washing his hands real\ngood\nor a number one turned into a number two\ncan you hear me train are you listening\nhey man yeah i was listening but anyways\nsorry i was juicing up but anyways um so\nyeah last time no yeah i think i think i\ndeviated septum they meant\nuh the breathing technique you taught me\nbro do you have a deviated septum\ni don't know okay my nose my nose is\nhuge like\nthere's no way i get a deviated system\nseptum i mean look at these things\ni'm telling you these things so in high\nschool you know i played soccer and\ni was one of the fastest and i truly\nbelieve this sounds like a memeing or\nmaking into a joke i\ni honest to god believe that these these\nhuge nostrils\nwhich by the way my my dad's friend\nwhich i love used to\njoke and say that my nostrils are so big\nthe shape of my finger\nbecause i he he made this joke oh do you\npick your nose in private and your nose\nshaped around your finger\nblah blah but i think my nostrils\nactually\ngive me the oxygen intake while i'm\nrunning to perform the speeds that i do\ndoes that make any sense\nyeah yeah i mean breathing through your\nnose when you're running\ni don't know actually yeah\ni breathe through the nose and i breathe\nout of mouth i think okay\ni think holy [ __ ] that's a good question\nwow\ni should think about that next time i do\nthat i haven't ran for like two years\num so\nanyway so you're so yeah tell me about\nyour parents\nso here's the crazy part\nmy parents they're happily married\nand for a long time i don't know how\nlong 40 years 20 30 years something like\nthat\nbut and they're that they're total\nopposites\nbut they find like a strong connection\nthrough that so my mom is\nvery my mom is very like conservative\nnot politically just like as far as like\nnot politically conservative she's\nshe's a democrat and she's like she\nloves bernie and stuff but\nmy mom is conservative when it comes to\nlike you know\ncrazy stuff right so she's like\nhow do i explain conservative like more\nsocially right like so like she doesn't\nshe's\nlike so my mom is more like she's like\nproper\nclassy you know any\nany talk of like like i don't even feel\nawkward saying that mixing two words\ntogether sex\nyou know because like that stuff it's\nlike you know\nyou know right yeah just she's just\nproper proper but she's not proper in\nlike that\nin that way that you see in movies where\nlike you know you know\nthe house and the prairie where the\nwoman walks you know it's not like that\nshe's very like\nloose and cool and she's very social and\nbut for her it's very\nit's go with the flow you know it's go\nwhere the wind takes you\nand you know she's a chemical engineer\nand\nshe's very smart and she's very just\neasy going and very cool\nand she's creative and very loving and\num sounds like you respect her a lot\ni do i do and so that's my mom\nmy dad same thing but the opposite\ni'll tell you the opposite is so the\nopposite isn't like perspective and view\nof life\nmy dad very outgoing like pretty much\nmy outgoing side where i can just joke\nand talk about\nanything and everything the moment we\nmeet comes from my dad my dad's very\nsocial always making jokes\nyou know um very cool but my dad\nhe has a different clock he has a\ndifferent set of values right\neverything for him is very objective\nit's very precise\nthere's a routine you know he comes from\nlike a military\nfamily so like you know he wakes up at\nthe same exact time\nsleeps the same exact time you know beds\nthe bed is like perfectly like you know\ncorner tucked\neverything down like everything is\nthere's a clock there's a time\nnever be late if you're late it gets\nvery upset there's no being late with\nhim\nbut my mom it's always being late right\nmy mom's always late my dad's never late\nso in respect to how like it's lived my\ndad's very like mathematical very\nprecise\nstrategical my mom is the exact opposite\nof that\nso i i i i\ni like that that's why i have this very\nso people can't understand when i tell\nthem i have two degrees and they watch\nmy stream\nthey can't understand how the train\nwreck they watch\ncan possibly sit down in school and\nfinish two degrees but the way i was\nraised is that there's a time and place\nif you're streaming that's the time to\nbring your social side\nout have fun do whatever you want now if\nstreaming was school work\nthen that's where people would probably\nunderstand how i got my degrees because\nthey would see a much more serious side\nof me\nthat can sit down organize things\nproperly get things does that make sense\nsure so when you say how are you you\nwere raised can you paint us a picture\nso like what was it\nlike in your house like how did these\nthings manifest these differences\nbetween your mom and your dad\ndamn it's like we need like seven\nsessions to talk about that\num did you give any que like direct\ni've never really talked about them like\nthat i don't know like questions\njust ignite yeah sure so like his like\ndoes anything come up\nwhen you kind of think about when your\nmom was your mom and your dad was your\ndad and and you were kind of caught in\nthe middle\nor you know how you responded to like\ntheir differential views on time or\nstudying or whatever\nor how were you taught that like there's\na time to study\num\nyou know uh\ni'm i'm pretty sure the same way that\nyou were\ntaught this way to i you know i was told\nto\nyou know i was told to study you know\ni'd say you know i would say i\ni finished my homework you know my dad\nwould look at me he's like\nyou know you give me that little eye you\nknow everyone knows the eye right\nand at that point i have that feeling\ncoming to my stomach of aw\n[ __ ] right which\npretty much you know insert the larry\ndavid\nand then maybe skip five minutes and i'm\nsitting at the table doing my homework\nwhile the modem's in their room\nright it's gone the router's gone right\nno more internet\nso you know um\npretty much rinse repeat of that sure um\nyou know i was very you know i was very\nblessed\nbecause my parents put a lot of time\ninto me you know my dad\nso you know my parents came from iran\nuh during the revolution or whatever the\nhell it's called right they came\nwith having nothing at all and my dad\nhad\nuh four other siblings so five all\ntogether including himself\nand he's not the oldest i think he's the\nsecond oldest\nbut his role was he took care of\neverybody so when they came they had no\nmoney he had to work two jobs\nwhile going to school and he ended up\nfinishing school in three years instead\nof four\nuniversity while working two jobs and\nsupporting his two sisters and brother\num he came out of school um got his\nmasters\nand he started working and\nthat's when travel started that's when\nyou know my parents had me\nthen i lived in korea for three years\nbecause my dad's the company i worked\nfor was in korea\nand um\nhe pretty much he puts everyone ahead of\nhimself\nright and everyone everyone\nand you know that put a lot of stress to\nmy mom because she was always worried\nabout him\nand then that put a stress on me because\nif i misbehave that put stress into him\nand my mom would cry because she thought\nthat he would\nyou know you know he would ex\npass or you know whatever because of the\nstress\nso i tried my best to do you know what i\nwas told but you know i was a kid and i\nwas stupid so\nuh no no like no no he's alive i don't\nknow what i'm saying is like yeah she\nthought the stress would eventually like\nyou know the stress of doing misbehaving\nwould do him in you know the stress of\neverything going on and i was a kid i\nwas dumb i didn't want to do homework i\ndidn't want to learn i don't want to do\nthis right i was a typical kid right i\njust wanted to play games\nand not do any work and not do this\ndon't do that so\nyou know um so my dad so\ni'll get to the part to what stressed\nhim out so my dad really care he loves\nme cares about me and every night\nso he would go to work you know from\nlike he'd leave 5 a.m come home you know\n8 p.m you know and right there he'd\nyou know dr get dressed for the home\nattire\nand then from right that point that\npoint wouldn't even eat that point he\nwould sit down with me and he would\nteach me math\nright he would teach me from math from\nscratch and we'd sit there until like 2\n3 a.m and then he sleeps like two three\nhours go to work rinse with every day\nhe was hands-on with me every day\nteaching me he was just so good at these\nthings\nand i you know in the beginning stages i\ndidn't want to sit down and put time in\nright i didn't want to apply myself i\nwas kind of everywhere\nso he put a lot of time with me and i\nlove him for that to this day i'm very\nthankful he always put himself ahead\nyou know um if there was something he\ncould you know\neventually got to a point through his\nhard work that we were above average as\nfar as income goes and things were\nyou know i'm very blessed but you know\nin the beginning stage when i was\nyounger we weren't\nso like if i wanted something i remember\nlike he would sacrifice you know a lot\nof his own or like you know\nif i was hungry but there wasn't any\nfood he would give me his and\nall these different things like taught\nme to you know\ngive you know take care of others before\ni take care of myself\ntype of thing right and unfortunately in\namerica that's not the way it works in\namerica you take care of yourself and\nthen if you have a little extra maybe\nyou give a little extra to others if you\ncan you take care of yourself right so\nthis really i got taken advantage a lot\nfor this but i still haven't changed\ni'm still that person i still do that\nbut\nwhat i'm trying to say is\ni don't know what i'm trying to say what\ni'm trying to say is they're very good\nparents and i love them\nso [ __ ] much yeah they're very like\nvery very\nvery good parents they taught me\neverything i know it was two different\nperspectives i'd go to i'd get two\ndifferent responses\nyou know on some things like you know uh\nsocial things my dad would give me\nleeway he would understand and my mom\nwouldn't she'd be pissed\nbecause she was more proper so an\nexample if i were to go to a party with\nmy friends\nyou know and i wouldn't come home that\nnight and my parents are\nsick worried about me maybe on the phone\nwith the cops i'd like oh it's all good\ni know\nyou know my man good stuff i know what\nyou're doing right my mom's like wow why\nare you there right\nnow let's say i get a c on my paper\ni was like oh it's okay just study my\ndad's like\nah right so when it came to like\nacademics when it came to\nschool when it comes to like [ __ ] that\nlike you you need to get done because\nthe 40 year old me is going to regret\nthe 15 year old me not doing it\nmy dad's gonna be upset you know when it\ncomes to\ngetting into the wrong crowd of friends\nyou know partying\ndrinking hanging out the wrong girl that\nseems like she's kind of you know\nyou know maybe i'm out there yeah my\nmom's gonna be upset right\nso it was these different perspectives\nwere it was just crazy so\ni got yeah so yeah it sounds like your\nparents made a lot of sacrifices for you\nthey did they a lot a lot and still do a\nlot\njust everything everything that it was\nyeah they made a lot of sacrifices and\na yeah yeah they're very good parents\nvery very very good parents\nyeah so it's kind of scary like\ni mean did you guys actually grow up in\na household where sometimes there wasn't\nenough food to go around\nno it wasn't it wasn't like that\nbut like it wasn't like that\nright but like if there was none that\nnight\nbecause like there was just nothing that\nnight there was like one food made\nthen like he would give me his but then\ni would like cry and well\nyou know i wouldn't want it but then he\nwould say he's not eating anymore then\ni'd end up eating it but i ended up\ncrying and then\nso i didn't i wanted him to eat but he\njust like go ahead and he would just\npretty much my dad was like you know he\nwould just\npretend he didn't want it or and this\nthis applies to everything\nright so like he did i i don't know does\nthat make sense now it wasn't like that\nit wasn't like we were dirt broke coin\nhouse house like we were good my dad\nsacrificed a lot he was very successful\nyeah\nyou know i was blessed in that way right\nbut\ndo you remember why you cried\nwell\nokay let's see here\ni think\nhmm\ni don't let me think about this\nhow do we start here how do we start\nhere okay\nlet's go to birthdays okay\nso\nthere is a reason why i try my best and\ni'm sure\neveryone can vouch for this like all my\nall my friends\nduring all my friends birthdays on\ntwitch i try to get them all presents\nso i will go around on each of the\nbirthdays and i'll whether it's just\nmoney subs or something i always need to\nget them a present\nand as far as like gifting subs you know\ni'm like i'm number two gifter on twitch\nfor subs and\nall these other things this like stems\nfrom one\nthing from my childhood one thing and\neverything\nfrom that stems from this\nso i need to breathe here because this\nis\ni've told a story twice and i've cried\nboth times so give me a sec here\nso\nso during birthdays or christmas\nor any holiday or event where i would\nget a present\nor presents for my parents i would\nalways cry\nand here's why so there's two two things\nfirst\nsince i was never really the popular kid\nand i was never really the cool kid that\nyou know had\na lot of friends which i think leads to\nanother thing where i feel like i need\neveryone to like me now but anyways\nyou know birthdays wouldn't be what you\nsee in like tv series and movies for\neverybody\nit was birthdays would be like me and\nmaybe like a couple cousins\nand like that's it right and my parents\nwould always try to like you know\npretend like you know\ni you know i had these friends and so\nthey would like get presents and like\nyou know uh uh you know you know\ngive them to me on behalf of them or\nwhatever you know blah blah blah now\nhold on\nwhen you say blah blah does it it sounds\nto me like your\nparents attributed gifts\nto friends that you didn't have yeah\nso so\npretty much\nso there's two parts of this the first\npart is\nokay so hmm the second part to the first\npart\nlet me think about this\nwhy does this require so much thought\nbecause i i just need to collect my uh\nmy motions for a sec\nso\nthere is a distinct feeling that i\nremember\nvery clearly and very vividly and\nit's the feeling\nof knowing that my parents are going\nabove their means to fulfill\nthings that i wanted\nand knowing they made the sacrifice\nand there's a feeling of not of of\nnot having the friends at the parties\nand not\nhaving a lot of people\nthere is a there's this feeling i\nremember\na deep deep pain loneliness a breaking\nof like the heart as they would call it\nand i guess i do what i do today\nwhen i try to give so no one ever has to\nfeel that because i felt it because of a\ncause and effect\nof that so i don't want anyone to think\ni've forgotten their birthday\nright so i try to be there and give them\nwhat i think i don't know does that make\nany sense\nyeah let me see if i understood you so\nit sounds to me like you sort of\nremember feeling lonely and also\nin that same moment felt deeply loved\nand appreciated\nwhile you were feeling under appreciated\nthat your parents went above and beyond\nto take away something\nfrom you or protect you from something\nand you sort of knew that they were\ndoing that that they got you all these\npresents that maybe even they couldn't\nquite afford\nto protect you from feeling the way that\nyou did\nand they didn't want you to feel that\nway so they went out of their way\nto try to protect you from those\nfeelings\nmake up for them kind of but i i hate\npresents and i always hated presents\nbecause i feel like so i so here's the\nweird part for me it wasn't about the\npresence i just\ni just wanted people to be there to have\nfun with\npres i never so i hate presents i hate\nreceiving stuff because i feel like i'm\nnot worthy of it\nright i feel like i feel like i need to\ndo something good to receive a present\nright so\nwhen i get the prep so when i know my\nparents are working very hard and they\ngive me a present\ni i hate getting it like so i don't it's\nnot that i wanted presents it's that\ni just wanted the friends but\nsince we're over the internet there's no\nother way to sh uh i don't know i don't\nyeah yes i guess but it's something so i\ni i i've always hated\nyeah go ahead so okay\nthanks for sharing tyler so let's see if\nwe can unpack this a little bit does\nthat does that sound okay\ndo you mind if uh while you talk i i get\nup real quick\ni can hear my wireless headphones okay\nunpack it so i can walk i just need to\ncollect my\ncollection i need to blow my nose in the\nbathroom okay go\ntalk or do you need to see me it helps\nif i see you it's awkward to talk to\nand that's okay okay i'll be very fast i\njust have one nose otherwise yeah take\nyour time man\ni don't wanna start sniffling in the\ncamera and then it just becomes\ndisgusting trust me\ntrain you seem very concerned it's\ninteresting right so on the one hand you\ndon't care about how you're perceived\nbut i think you own up to a lot of the\nway that you're perceived\nyou kind of joke about your forehead and\nat the same time\nit also seems like you're very concerned\nabout how you're perceived\nso no i'm actually talking to y'all\ntwitch chat i'm thinking out loud but i\nknow he can hear\ni feel comfortable talking to you guys\nit's just weird talking to train if he's\nnot there\nso i do care i'm perceived 100 i do care\nit's not that i don't care i do care i\nthink that says they don't care\nyeah i do care\nit's that since i've\ntaken a lot of criticism on how i'm\npursuing since i've taken a lot of\ncareers my whole life\ni can handle it well so it seems like i\ndon't care or seems like i'm trying to\nsay i don't care i do care\nright i can see that does that make\nsense so yeah it makes sense yeah\nso i do somewhere just when someone\ndescribes their\nforehead as an umbrella that protects\nthem from the rain\nit implies that they're comfortable with\nthe way that they're perceived and the\nway that people talk about them\nright that's what it suggests and at the\nsame time i'm noticing that\nit actually matters to you a lot i think\nthat there's\nthere's a lot of interesting\nstuff for lack of a better term about\nyeah so let's go back to the gift giving\nfor a second we'll go back\ngo ahead so so i mean what i'm hearing\nyou kind of say is that\nyou sort of don't feel sometimes like\nyou're worthy\nof the gift and that too sort of makes\nsense because\nwhat i'm getting is that your parents\nmade a lot of sacrifices\nto get you gifts to me\nthe gift was their sacrifice but i don't\nthink they thought that i understood at\nthat age that their sacrifice\nwas worth anything because i was young\nand i thought gifts and toys were\neverything i think they thought that but\ni\nat that age i saw their sacrifice and\nevery night their sacrifice would make\nme cry every night\nbecause i i wouldn't i would\nfor for how much they sacrifice why\nwould you die every night\nbecause i saw what it was doing to like\ntheir health i saw like i could\nsee my dad aging i could see my dad was\nalready doing so much\nand i was not\ni don't know that's why i would cry does\nthat make any sense\ni'll try for many reasons but that's one\nof them yeah yeah so\ni so i them being my parents was gift\nenough\nbut they didn't know that so when i'd\nget a gift\ni would always cry and i wouldn't want\nto accept it but they couldn't\nunderstand because they thought\ni didn't know does that make any sense\nso well they didn't know that i was\naware of the sacrifices they'd make\nthey didn't know that like i could like\noverhear conversations of like things\nthey had like\nyou know if they were behind on things\nbut they would sacrifice that and put it\ntoward me and act like everything was\nokay\ni knew these things were going on but\nthey'd still do them\nand they'd take the weight of the world\njust to make me believe that everything\nwas okay but i knew everything was not\nso it's that feeling that's what makes\nme want\ni i don't want people to feel that so\nthat's why like so for example i have\nthese like advice streams and i try to\nlike\ni try to like you know i'll pay for like\npsychiatric or psychology\nlike sessions i don't want them to feel\nwhat i felt of\nwhy do you think your parents did that\nfor you because they loved me\ni don't know right i mean i think that's\na that's a good answer i think it's\ncertainly true\nbut i i wonder has it ever occurred to\nyou that the same thing that motivates\nyou to help other people\nis what motivated your parents to do\nthat for you\nyeah well it did because it wasn't only\nme they did it for\ni remember uh he would do it for a lot\nof people like\nso he coached my soccer team as well and\nyeah\nthere was like yeah i'm actually that's\na tangent but yeah i mean so\nso on a very simple sense it sounds like\nyou're trying to protect people from\nthe hurt that you experienced\nyeah but the hurt is in a lot of places\nwe're just talking about one of them and\nthe other one i couldn't fully\nembody into like i couldn't fully put\ninto words for the birthdays and the\nholidays and like the friends i couldn't\nthat one wasn't coming out clearly but\nyeah for this\none instance this is one of the many\nthat we can talk about but yeah\ni guess yeah the second one was\nsomething around loneliness\naround loneliness that was tied to my\nyeah yeah my parents would try to\nyeah make me feel not and i just\nwouldn't feel yeah\nit ties into this they would sacrifice\nmore and more just to make me feel\nyou know i don't know it wasn't just all\ngifts it was love and affection too but\ni i don't know yeah yeah yes we'll just\nsay yes\nit sounds like that they made a lot of\nthey tried to really\nhelp you feel better and they\nthey did a lot of things behind the\nscenes to create a particular kind of\nexperience for you\nyeah what was it like to be able to see\nbackstage\nit gave me a lot of perspective a lot of\ncharacter um\nit it taught me to you know\nit taught me that time and like quality\ntime is more important than\nthan money and that family is more\nimportant than money and that\nyou know take just that kind of like\nyeah i don't know it just top yeah i\nguess\nyeah i guess just\ni don't know\ni feel like i sk i feel like i couldn't\nfully put into words what i wanted to\nsay and like we're like\nsix chapters in but chapters one two and\nthree i couldn't fill\nfully for you i don't know does that\nmake any sense i think it does but i\nthink that's okay\ni think sometimes you know there\nsometimes you\nyou know much like a good book you\nreally figure out what was happening in\nchapters one two and three\nin chapter 25. true right a plot twist\nputs everything into perspective so i\nthink that's okay okay\nthat makes me makes me feel better yeah\ni mean i i think it's clear that your\nfeelings are com\ncomplex and that there are many\ndifferent nuances to them\nthat there's a sense of appreciation\nand also what sounds like some something\nlike a shade of guilt to be honest\nthat you know you recognize that they\nwere making a sacrifice and you\nappreciate them for that\nand there's also a certain sadness of\nlike\nyou know when your dad chooses to give\nyou his share of like\nwhatever has been made and like you end\nup eating it like that's gotta\nit's hard to receive the kindness\nof another person who has to give\nsomething up to give it\nyes yes it can make you feel\nnot worthy yes\nright because who is truly worthy of\nthat like i mean\nyour dad doesn't there's something about\nthat that's just horribly\nunfair and you're kind of the recipient\nof kindness which on the one hand is\ngood but like\nnot at such a cost\nyes you know i mean that makes a lot of\nsense to me\nsaid it does no it does yes 100 does\nyeah sometimes i think it's it's hard i\nthink the interesting thing tyler is\nthat\ni'm not sure if that still carries over\nto today\ndo you still feel like sometimes you're\nnot worthy of the kindness that you\nreceive\nhmm\nfrom my parents i would say\nit's\nfor my parents yes it's not that\nfrom my parents\ni don't know if it's right now at this\nstage in my life i don't know i don't\nknow if it's a worthiness it's more so\nabout\ni don't know i mean i know my parents\nare proud of me\ntyler let me ask you something okay go\nahead\nwhat could your dad have done\nto\nso so you understood that they made the\nsacrifice you appreciated their\nsacrifice\nand at the same time you experienced\nsome degree of pain from that\ndoes that make sense\nto answer your question before the next\nthing right here\ni don't think there was anything that\nthey could have done differently i think\nthat the pain that i felt\nwas because i knew that that\nis pure good and in and because\nit's good what i felt\nhas made me do what he does unto me\nonto others right like\nso the best way i can explain this is\nthere's no way i can explain it but i\ndon't think there's anything different\nyou can do i think he did\nexactly what any good person would do\nthat loves somebody that's why i don't\nthink there is any\nthere is no perfect in this world that\nyou know it\neverything comes with its opposite it\ncomes with its\nright that's what gives you the\nperspective the duality of it right\nlike i'm i don't know does that make any\nsense i don't think there's anything\nmakes sense\nand and i'd encourage you to to think\nabout it slightly differently\nso that your dad taught you pure\ngoodness\nright is that right he taught me\nappearance\nit's not yeah sure it is okay\nyeah okay go ahead what else do we call\nnot eating to feed your child pure\ngoodness\nand so so i i also see that you have\nyou have taken what he taught you you've\nmade it a part of who you are\nand you try to do it for others right\nyou said that your dad puts everyone\nelse first\nand you don't it is you still have some\nstrange feelings around receiving gifts\nbut you're very particular about giving\ngifts\nand yet receiving them is still hard for\nyou\nso like let's try to like try to\nunderstand that for a second\nso i think the crazy thing here is that\ncan i tell you a story yes please\nokay maybe this story will uh because i\ni i'm going to make a couple of\nassumptions about how iranian culture\nand indian culture\nare away similar yeah so when i was\nuh first um kind of like not first but\nlike\nyou know after i'd been dating my wife\nfor a while or maybe we were engaged i\nwould probably like engaged um and uh\nyou know one day i went home\nand she came with me so i was at my you\nknow my parents house and my grandmother\nwas there\nthe first thing that that happens when i\ncome home is is you know my mom and my\ngrandmother ask me\nwhat do i want to eat and i don't want\nto burden them\nright so i say like whatever's easiest\nand what do you think their responses\nany idea so you asked your parents\nwhat you could do to not burden them no\nno no so yeah so i\nno i said they're like what do you want\nto eat like when you go home like you\nknow i don't know if your mom tries to\nlike cook your favorite dish\noh go ahead right and and so so so\nthey're like oh look what do you want to\neat and i say like whatever is easy like\nyou know don't\ninconvenience yourself for my sake right\nmakes sense right so and then what what\nyou think that like\ncalms them down or riles them up\nriles them up why\nbecause you're damn right why\nthat's a question i still have yet to\nanswer because for me it goes back and\nforth\nyeah yeah so so like the interesting\nthing is like you know sometimes like\nwhat happens like\nyou know is that people want to take\ncare of you\nyeah and and if you\ntell people like yeah like so they would\nand then what what happened is they like\nask me a thousand questions so like do\nyou want this\ndo you want this do you want this and\ni'd be like whatever's fine like\neverything's fine\nlike really like whatever's easy like\nplease don't and then get like more and\nmore riled up\nyes because they wouldn't know like here\nis their\nyou know son home from whatever like\nback from boston\nand i i'm in medical school and so\nthey're like oh you're home\nand like we wanna you know they wanna\nthey wanna show their affection they\nwanna show their love\nso they ask me like what do i wanna eat\nand i'd say like whatever\nmy wife is like you're driving i'm\n[ __ ] insane just it doesn't matter\nwhat you want to eat just pick something\nbecause they you you owe them\na simple answer so that they haven't\nseen you in two months\nthey get joy out of watching you eat you\ncome home and you say you just pick\nsomething\ntell them i want to eat this and then\nwhen they make it\nyou s shove your face full of it\nand then you tell them it's delicious it\ndoesn't matter what you want\nit doesn't matter what they want you\njust say something\nand then you accept what they give you\nand you appreciate it\ndoes that make sense completely makes\nsense yes\nright on point yes and so when it comes\nto the gift giving\ni i get where you're coming from that\nyou want to protect like you want to be\nlike your dad said something did\nsomething so awesome for you\nand if everyone in the world was like\nyour dad the world would be\nfor the most part an awesome place maybe\npeople would be\nfreaking out about beds not being made\nbut you know people would put others\nahead of themselves\nand so in a weird way i think one of the\nsimplest things just think about what it\nwould have done\nfor you as a kid\nif like he knows like you know he's\nhungry he knows he's hungry\nhe doesn't want to accept or doesn't\nknow\nthat you know and while you eat it\nthere's a part of you that feels like\nhurt because like\nyou know he's sacrificing and sure it's\na beautiful sacrifice\nbut it brings pain with it and sure\nthere's something about duality and\nsomething there\ni'm curious you know how do you think it\nwould have affected you if your dad said\nlike let's say there's one\nyou know piece of bread left or\nsomething like that and you guys went\nhalfsies\nhow would you have felt if he had taken\nhalf of his portion\ni think giving me half or giving me full\nit would have the same exact effect\nbecause it's not for me it's not so for\nme it's not the\nit's not the actual food that's being\ngiven or the amount of it\nit's the intention of of the of the\nit's the inception of the thought\nthat is there instantly instinctually\nit's it's there\nto give it to be willing to ready at any\ncall\nany chance at any second to give it\nright it's it's the thought\nit's not the actual action of it it's\nit's that it's there like\nthat's why for me when people reach out\nto me like what's\non my birthday right it's just\nthe little reach out that isn't for me\nthat's enough right\nand for a lot of people i think that's\nenough it's just it's it's the fact that\nit's there\nyeah so tyler yeah so i i i make okay\ni'm with you in terms of the portion so\nlet me put it this way\nsometimes a kindness that you can the\nbiggest kindness you can do for someone\nelse\nis to let them do a kindness for you\nwhat do you think about that i think\nit's completely accurate that was gonna\nbe my next point\nright so and i think when it comes to\nlike gift receiving\nyeah so sure you feel guilty on some\nlevel\nbut remember that like something about\nyour feeling of guilt is depriving them\nof their intention to make you feel a\ncertain way\ni think here's how i actually think it\nis\nnow tell me if you feel me on this okay\nokay\ni think the guilt that i felt\nand that i feel\nis the very response that is most\nappropriate\nfor their action because if i learn from\ntheir action\nand if i were to be good and understand\nwhat good is in putting others before\nyourself\ni would have to feel that way if i'm\nactually learning from them and\ni was gonna do that one day if i didn't\nfeel that guilt and i just took\nthat's when you become shameless that's\nwhen you're no longer aware of the\nother's emotions\nyou're no longer aware of the other\nperson's experience that they're\nuh going through and what they're losing\nby giving you the peace so i think i\nneed to feel that way in order to\nreciprocate\nso let me need it when you give someone\nelse a gift\ndo you want them to feel guilty\ni think guilty is the wrong word it's\nnot it's not\nguilty that i felt it's it was\nit was it's not the\nguilt isn't the right word the word i\nfelt\nwas it softened my heart it made me\nache for a moment to know that this\nexisted that this was the closest thing\nto a superhero right we all see our\nparents as\nyou know this or that us fortunate ones\nat least i don't want to assume everyone\nhas a good relationship\nbut you know especially in our cultures\nright like i would say like\nit's\nthe feeling shapes me\nit's the good and the i felt the good in\nthe world right\nthat's what i felt so that feeling\nnaturally\nif i myself i'm not some crazy\nsociopathic serial killer\nnaturally no matter i mean listen this\nis why i wouldn't say it out loud\ni accepted the gift to make him feel\ngood he had no idea that i was\nsad in his decision so i allowed him to\nfeel good by giving me the gift i held\nthat inside\nknowing that so that\nknowing is what allows me to\nlearn from that grow from that and it's\nit allows me to shape\ninto that to do it myself so doing it my\ndoes that make any sense makes perfect\nsense right so but\nnow you guys are playing this little\ngame\nof i'm gonna sacrifice more i'm gonna\ntake the pain from you\ni'm gonna eat this thing because i know\nit makes my dad\nfeel comforted that there isn't enough\nfood for both of us\nso what you do is you you receive his\ngoodness\nand you sacrifice because of it\nright yes yeah and so\nwhat what i'm hearing from you is that\nthe world is a place where pure goodness\nis represented by sacrifice\nyou want to feel guilt\nit's how you know you're doing it right\nyou're becoming your father\nyou're putting other people first and\nyou can't put someone else first\nwithout someone taking a loss\nsometimes yes right for serious\noccasions like\nfine yeah yeah i guess maybe yeah tyler\nso like like the interesting thing i\nthink it's beautiful don't get me wrong\nand i come from the same culture of\nsacrifice\nyeah right so i i'm with you that i\nthink the world is sort of changing\nlike we're real boomers now because we\ntalk about kids nowadays\nbut i i do think that you made a good\npoint that in america\nit's help yourself first and help\nyourself second\nit's a very you know like like\nanyway so it's different right so in in\na lot of like the\nlike middle eastern south asian east\nasian\ni'm not sure about other parts of the\nworld because i just don't know those\ncultures as well but like\nthere's a very community aspect the\ncommunity actually comes ahead of the\nindividual\nit's just a different value system yeah\ni invited uh did\nyou know who lacari is le carr is a\nstreamer so i invited him over and\nwhen he came over i gave him\nmy master bedroom and my master bathroom\nand i\nslept in the guest room on like this\nvery like shitty bed\nand he couldn't understand why the hell\nwould this guy invite me to his house\nand give me the master bedroom after\nbathroom master bathroom everything good\nand sleep in a\ncreaky old bed in the guest room this is\njust this is my culture this is how i\nwas raised right\nnow it's not everybody in our culture\nbecause i'll tell you what my cousins\nif they had one last fruit roll up that\n[ __ ] you know they hounded me they would\nargue hit me pull my hair it's theirs\nwhen i had one last\nfruit roll up my dad taught me listen we\ncan get more another time\nlet your cousins have it that's the way\ni was raised right give it to them\ndon't worry you know take care of\nyourself last make sure they're good\nthey're your guests\nright yeah so no one understands this\nand i think lucario was confused which\nled to another story but\nthat's true yeah so so let me kind of\nlike ask so so i'm with you that that\noftentimes\nsacrifice that\ngoodness so goodness to you feels\nright when it comes with a sense of\nguilt unworthiness or sacrifice\nright now i know i'm not perfectly\ncapturing this because i think that\nthere's\nbut but so so here's here's the the\nthing right so in the\nin in the same way that\nyou decided to eat the food so your dad\ncould have the feeling of like\nokay like i did the good thing and my\nson is eating\nbecause like he feels the same way right\nlike you're helping him feel good\nthrough sacrifice\nyes and then and then the big thing that\nmy my wife\ntaught me is that like that's something\nyou know sometimes the best way that you\ncan feel is sort of like what you said\nyou just\nyou take one you just take it you take\nwhat other people have to offer and\nthat's actually the best gift you can\ngive them\nand i think it's it runs contrary to our\ncultures of like taking is bad\nbut at the same time it's really like a\nnext level play\nand i have never seen my family be\nhappier than when i\nsometimes become a taker you know i'm\ncareful about it\nbut now i have this thing where like\nwhen i visit my in-laws\nlike i just ask for one thing\nevery time i go pick one thing and\n[ __ ] ask for it\nand then like my my mother-in-law is\nawesome and she feels just so much\nlike then she gives me the thing i enjoy\nit fully and then she's a happy camper\ni'm a happy camper and all i had to do\nwas be a little bit of an [ __ ] and\nask for something\nand so in a weird way tyler what i what\ni'd encourage you to do is like the next\ntime you receive a gift\ngive someone the opportunity of just\nreceiving it and give someone the\nopportunity\nof doing of accepting it\njust like you did for your dad and that\nyou don't have to feel\nlike you can you accepted something from\nyour dad and it came with guilt and so i\nthink your mind is somewhat conditioned\nfor like when someone gives something to\nyou like you feel guilt fine\nlike you can see how those two\nexperiences are connected and at the\nsame time\nlet go of that guilt\nas best as you can try to just accept\nwhat people have to give\nand that understand that on some level\nsometimes\nthe the best the the best sacrifice\nthe purest goodness that you can\nhave is one of sacrifice which is\nsomething that i think is like very well\nrepresented and explained in\nchristianity\nright so that's like it's like an\nage-old kind of thing that like the\nthe bigger the sacrifice the better the\ngood\nbut i think that there's also like a\ndifferent perspective which is that\nsometimes\nyou can just accept other sacrifices and\nyou don't have to feel guilty\nwhich i know sounds bizarre to you and\nthat's why i encourage you to just\naccept what gifts people have to give\nand and acknowledge that\nwhen they're giving that gift the last\nthing they want you to feel is guilty\nthey're giving it for the same reason i\nmean just imagine if other people feel\nguilty when\nyou give them a gift and sure there's a\ncertain amount of like paying it forward\nthat you want to do you're demonstrating\nto them sacrifice\ni just feel like i feel like i i feel\nlike it's my responsibility\nto to know when they're sacrificing\nand to feel that i'll accept it i'll\nmake them feel good and\nand let them do the heroic deed but i\nfeel like i need to\nsee that and reciprocate the favor and\nget them back\nout of there does that make sense which\ni think is completely natural it's how\npeople should feel does that make sure\nso yeah get them out of there in terms\nof what\nso let's say i'm in a tough spot right\nand you know\nsomeone reaches out gives me a gift\nhelps me out right\ni so if they've sacrificed something\ngiving me that because they you know\nthey can maybe take a couple days\nwithout eating so i can eat that one day\nthen i feel like i need to come back and\nhe he gave me a plate of food i need to\ngive him a restaurant\nsure does that make any sense like i was\ntalking about old school mob type stuff\nyeah i'm saying like yep you you feel me\nyeah yeah\nyeah no but yeah i feel understand what\nyou're saying\nyeah so i just wanna make sure we have\ntime for the bully thing but i don't\nknow if we do do we have to\ngo for that not so much but i mean is\nthere something\nwe can because i i think you know we\ntend to get\ntalk about things somewhat deeply so i\nthink we kind of cover less ground\nbut if there's something you want to say\nabout my only concern about the bully\nthing is that\nwe wouldn't have enough time to do it\njustice what do you think\nyeah you're probably right i mean i i\ncan never get to any of my points and i\nfeel like today\nyeah so yeah how do you feel about today\num i i feel like\nevery time i have a camera i've how i\nfeel today is how i feel\nevery time i have a conversation with\nsomeone that i\nenjoy their which is there's just never\nenough time\nthat's how i feel i like you i like you\nit's\ni like it's fun talking to you it's fun\nyeah i just enjoyed talking to you you\nknow just\nhey it could be anything we could\n[ __ ] we could talk about\na horse and i'll have a good time let me\ntalk 45 minutes about horus believe me\ni can stretch that out i'll start with\nthe tail we'll go to the hooves\nwe'll go up the you know ankles we'll\ntalk about the bony structures we'll\ntalk about the muscles\ni'll stretch out for two hours and i'm a\npro at this but\ni just it's just fun it's just it's it's\nit's nice to\ntalk to someone that's it's why i enjoy\namong us a lot\nit forces it forces interactions that i\nfeel like this generation is completely\nlost it forces 10 people to get into a\ncall\nit forces us to\nbe in situations that build stronger\nrelationships\nright nowadays friendships over the\ninternet they have no challenges and\nwhen one challenge happens everyone's\nready to just run and\ndisappear because it attacks\nwhat they've hidden deep inside their\nmind that no one can have\nbut anyways yeah i really enjoy these\nconversations so how i feel today is how\ni feel when i have a conversation with\nanyone that's\nfun to talk to what i'm hearing is\nincomplete\nno no it was very complete it's just\nthat i just want to talk about you know\ni wish we had 15 hours straight you know\ni feel like i wish we both could just go\nsix coffees each\ntalk for 15 hours straight you know and\njust\n[ __ ] around just have fun together\nyou know can i\noffer um my perspective\nyeah of course so uh\ntrain i i want to talk more too i think\none of the things that i found is that\num the longer a conversation\ngoes like i feel like i have a certain\namount of hard drive space\nand that hard drive space is about 90\nminutes and that what i find is that\nif i keep going there's a lot of\nfruitful stuff but i tend to start\noverriding the stuff at the beginning\ninteresting\nso for you to know here's how i work\nokay\nso that 90 minute period you have where\nyou start recording or writing onto your\nhard drive\nfor me booting up\nyeah for me so the last 15 minutes\nis the information is real information\nthat can get us somewhere\nand the other you know uh uh 75 minutes\nall of that was just me booting up just\njust complete like\nan utter just just [ __ ] right so\nmaybe i need to just wake up and\nlook and talk in the mirror for like 45\nminutes to myself and get all the\n[ __ ] out\nso when you when you and i start i can\nstart right at the good stuff\nyou know what i'm saying well yeah but i\njust to play devil's advocate there for\na second i think there was a lot of good\nstuff\nso so just as an example so i have a\nhypothesis that you're very concerned\nabout\nyou know your perception and how people\ntreat you that you're very\nconfident in yourself and at the same\ntime there's this weird [ __ ] about the\nparent oil like\nwhy those phones need to be in in\nairplane mode like\nit sounds like you were concerned about\nsomething getting out\nin which case then no it's because okay\nso the way i talk\nand the generation i came from with the\nfriends i had the way i talk it's very\nloose\nand it's from a generation where\neveryone gave each other the benefit of\nthe doubt\nso when you come from a generation where\neveryone gives you the benefit of the\ndoubt\neverything you say it's taken in a\ncontext that is the least harmful\nin the sense of like you don't mean it\nin a way where you're this terrible\nperson\nright he was just kidding he meant it in\nthis context relaxed nowadays we live in\nthe total opposite\nnowadays the worst possible scenario is\nfound the worst possible context is\napplied\nand that's the way it's written so\nnowadays with the way i talk\ni i speak very crazily right um\ni've i type the same way right whether\nit's\nuh males females anyone you know i've\ntold\ntyler juan and other streamers that they\nhave you know sexy eyes and i went a\nlittle deeper into sexual stuff with you\nknow these guys\ni i just i talk very loosely and\nthe problem is here's the problem the\nway that\nit's represented by whoever represents\nit if they introduce it first\nthey get to dictate what the context is\nand i know\nanyone that does not like me will always\ndictate the context\nin a different way and the things that i\nsay are very important\nwith context they're very important you\nremove the context they could be very\nserious and very bad\nso i think the same way yeah so when i'm\nhaving\ndinner with two friends off stream and\ni'm talking freely i might make a joke\nthat i know me and my friends there\nunderstand the context of and we know\nit's not harmful\nthe problem is if that were to be\nrecorded\nand someone were to introduce it with a\ndifferent narrative line\nthere is nothing i can say or do that\nwill\never prove that it is the way i meant it\nit is always forever going to be taken\naway by the general public because\nthere's no way they can understand\nwhat i meant and since we of what we\ntalked about before of how i'm perceived\nkind of this like terrible\nevil like villain that's the way it it\nmakes it even harder for me to\nbattle that so i just take precautions\nbecause i know does that make any sense\nyeah i mean i think that makes a lot of\nsense i'm\ni i find myself being curious but i i\nthink you know there's a lot of\nquestions from that like you know why\nare you perceived as a villain and where\ndoes that come from\nbut i think that sounds like it's a\nwhole other conversation it is i'll i'll\nkeep this one very short but\nsure we'll talk about that we'll talk\nabout a little later so there's this\nweird like\ndouble side to this half of it\nhalf of it i i have my opinions i have\nmy theories\nand it sucks and i don't like it\nthe other half of me feels like it's\nnecessary to be seen this way\nit's a very weird conflicting uh two uh\ndifferent sides that i have in my head\nright now\nthat i i've always had so\nbecause of my experiences through the\nbullying in middle school\nhigh school beca and and\na little bit of college because of that\nit fueled me to\ndo whatever i needed to do it was my\nfuel i learned how to take\npeople's hate doubt and turn it into\nfuel\nright and that's why even\ni mean even if people don't like me here\nthey can they can\nthey have to admit to themselves when\ni've had hordes of people hating me way\noutnumbering me i've still kept going\nright where others take months breaks\nbecause of one hate thread\nyou know there's been hundreds that i\njust use as fuel\nnow here's the reason why up half of me\nwhich is unhealthy thinks it needs to be\nthere\ni've learned no other way to move\nforward\nbesides using the doubt and hate as fuel\nthere was there was a week where i went\nremember i was cherished and praised i\nthink it was during the australia\nwildfires\nwhere we did this big community event\nand i was\ni was like cherished and praised it was\nall love and good\nand for that entire week i actually\ni almost felt like purposeless i felt\nlike i\ni was i i had nothing fueling me\nto prove people wrong and uh do\nsomething\nand i i actually had no i had no\nmotivation at all\nand then as soon as the first hate\nthread came back of train wrecks being\nan\n[ __ ] or a hate piece of [ __ ] when\nthat came and i saw that\nit invigorated me it it it refueled this\nflame in my eye where i wanted to go to\nthe next step just to\nyou know does that make sense so it's\nthis weird thing where i hate it because\ni'm not this person\nthat i look like i am but on the other\nhand\nas soon as people start seeing it from\nthe inside i lose the mode of it right\nbecause\nmy primary feel was that it's just wrong\ni don't know i think it makes sense\nit makes a lot of sense uh tyler i think\na big thing that i've noticed is that\nwe tend to stick with the patterns that\nare adaptive at one point\nand then sometimes they become\nmaladaptive\nand and they no longer are ideal for us\nbut it's what we know\nand it's what works so like substance\nuse i think is a really good example of\nthis where\nyou know people can have bad feelings\nand then what they find is that there's\nsomething that\nhelps those bad feelings go away and\nand so and it can work you know for a\ntime\nand in your case it sounds like it's\nstill working pretty well but i think\nthat sometimes it's bizarre that\nyou know we propagate things that seem\nlike they're bad\nbut the reason we propagate them is\nbecause they work\nand that's it you know it's\nit it's not that uncommon but i think i\nthink we can dig into it do you how do\nyou feel about meditation today\nwe can try it oh that's that's what\nwe're going to talk about remember last\ntime we ended on substance use i was\ngoing to tell you about my\nmy long yeah next time i guess we'll do\nthat next time\nyou know i've had i've dabbled in uh\nand i hate talking about it in this mood\nbecause it sounds like i'm bragging as\nit's some sort of experience that\neveryone no you know\nagain you see that like so much of what\nyou say like your mind automatically\ngoes to\ni hate to send you say what you want to\nsay\ni just want to take it the wrong way but\nyeah you know i [ __ ] like\nyou know i went through four years uh\ni've done a lot of you know i've i've\nyou know um\nyeah i did i wasn't like heroin for like\nthree four years\nyou know i tried meth once um\ni've done a lot of drugs i was quite\ndangerous i was young\nyeah i was like 18 to 12 18 like 23 20\n18\n23. i think i tried these things and\ni've never been to i've never been to\none rehab but i i i\ns this is this the dangerous part be\ncareful about i like i self-taught how\nto like quit\nand that's what we're going to talk\nabout into this one since you're an\naddiction\npsychiatrist but we'll do that next time\nokay some crazy i'm telling some i got\ni i ended up one of these nights\ni ended up in a neighborhood\nand my friend takes me to this party\nokay so i'm gonna leave i'm like this on\na cliffhanger here i'm not gonna end the\nstory so\ni do drugs with these kids and i end up\nat this party\nin the avenues of arizona right avenues\nare not a good place in arizona so i\nhave any avenues\ni'm in a neighborhood i walk in this\nparty\nsupposed to be this cool party fun i\nwalk in\nand the first thing i remember i saw was\nblack duct tape\ngoing straight from the double door of\nthe front of the house\nthrough the middle of the double door\nzigzagging perfectly\nsplitting the house i'm like what the\n[ __ ]\nlike is he taping down an ethernet cable\ni didn't see anything which is the flat\nduct tape what's going on\nso i look back up i walk in i make it to\nthe main portion\non the right side there was a bunch of\npeople\nin blue shirts and attire\non the left side red i was at a\nneighborhood\npeace party between gangs\nand this story was so [ __ ]\ninsane i've told it once on my stream\nbut these are the things i went through\nduring that phase the three to four year\nphase of like the usages the things that\ni\nlucky i made it out alive i mean let\nalone the drug itself but\nthe situations and the people are\nbrought around [ __ ] that that's a story\nfor later that that was\ncrazy stuff happened later that night\nyou know there's helicopters choppers i\nwas in a car with random three people it\nwas bad\nbut we'll tell that next time it was\nsome insane [ __ ]\nokay so trade that does sound like quite\nthe cliffhanger man\num i need to pee so i'm going to leave\nyou too\noh okay okay i'll entertain stream\nyou go p and then right when i see you\ncoming back alt p and then we'll wrap it\nup in like 15\nminutes\noh no socks yo dr k got some socks on my\nman\nwhat's up guys you know i feel like\ni wish i wish i can\npick and choose when to come on within\nthe like\nhour of having the show but it's like so\nselfish and irresponsible of me to like\nexpect that or want that\nthere's days where i can speak\neloquently which is very rare but\nthere's days that that's there\nthose are the days i want to come talk\nto them so i can freely express\neverything i'm feeling like uh or in an\norganized way today is not one of those\ndays as you guys can tell\nyou just need more time training\nyeah maybe i don't know yeah maybe but\nat the end of the day i mean listen he's\nalready doing amazing work you know\nthe you know plus hey\nwe'll come back and we'll talk about the\njuicy stuff\ncan i touch up on one thing before we go\nto meditation and wrap up yeah sure\noh it's the birthday it's the birthday\nthing i want to clean that up cause i\nthink i didn't properly get it out\nand there's no response needed i just\nwant to clear i i just think i didn't\nexplain that properly\nthen again i feel like it's awkward now\nre-explaining it\nyou know because i was like a soft\nmoment and now i'm not in a soft mood\ndoes that make any sense\nbut anyways sure so\nactually i i i guess we can revisit that\nlater\nokay but but in that time i was gonna\nuse to answer your other question before\ni\nuh kind of just jumped away and went\ninto different different direction\nyou asked why i was why i feel like i'm\nseen\nas the villain so i want to be honest\nwith you okay\nwhen you look at me okay look at me\ndo i come off initially now i know\nyou're wise\nyou know i'm not calling you old\nkind of you're not old but you know\nyou're older than me i think then again\nwait maybe not\nanyways so\ndamn i just called you old i'm so sorry\nbut anyway no no no i'm\ni'm just i i didn't get perceived as you\ncalling me old\noh great you look great by the way\namazing skin amazing hair\nwhat i'm what i'm what made me laugh\ntrain is just how\ntuned in you are to how people perceive\nyou and how you affect other people\nright so like you're it there seems to\nbe like a constant program in your mind\nabout how are my work it's\nkind of good right so it means that\nyou're like very empathic\nyou're kind of constantly tuned in to\nlike how how am i being perceived or my\nwords being understood\nyou know you're always asking does that\nmake sense\nit's like it's sort of like there's a\nsecond monitor in your mind that has\nthis program about\nhow are my words being you could call me\nold i wouldn't mind\ni was laughing because you called me\nwise and i think i'm not\nthat's why i was laughing like if if you\nonly\nknew i mean i get i'm wise oh no no\nbelieve me\ni've already in my mind at the very\nleast this is gonna sound very\npretentious of me but\nthat right there what you just said if\nyou only knew i've already\nbelieve me i'm already assuming\nokay how can i say this psychiatry and\nlike\nso obviously psychiatry go to medical\nstuff psychology you know it's a little\ndifferent\nbut in order to have in my opinion\na decently high social experience which\nyou sorry social intelligence which i\nthink you do\nyou have to have quite a bit of trial\nand error\nquite a bit of different experiences and\nyou have to\nbe able to think\nthink into a situation that you mean the\npoint is i believe me i've already\ncalculated things\ni'm not putting you in as this holy\ngrail of a god and your you know god's\nleft nut\nand your you know this pure thing that\ntouches water turns into wine\nby no means but that's exactly why i\nthink you're wise and i think you\nadmitting that you're not wise is\nexactly why you are wise right but\nanyways the point i'm trying to make is\nwhen you look at me\nokay i have black hair black eyebrows i\nhave\nblack eyes i have very a very deep voice\ni'm very passionate\nso i my voice my voice raises very\nquickly which to others\nit would be a slight raise but since my\nvoice is deeper it sounds like i'm\nyelling and ready to\nyou know call the trumpets of war or the\nhorn of war\nright so when you look at me initially\nnow that you've talked to me\nyou can you probably have a good idea of\nwhat i'm like but but when you initially\nlook at me okay imagine before you talk\nto me at all when i just look at you\nlike this\nwould you say that i'm a that that i\nlook like an approachable person that's\ngonna be very nice to you or do you\nthink i look like someone that's gonna\nbe a total [ __ ] to you\nmost people answer that as the [ __ ] i\nwouldn't describe you as approachable\nbut i think that there's like\nit's not either or what do you look\napproachable\nno but i don't think you look like an\nass\nbecause let me tell you [ __ ]\n[ __ ] come in all colors shapes and\nsizes\noh i know that i know that but so but\ni i would agree i don't think i i think\nyou can be intimidating\ni think you can look intimidating for\nsure\ncertainly i think a deep voice\na certain confidence\nand i i think you also\nyeah i i think intimidating is a word i\nwould use to describe\nyou i think so i wouldn't i wouldn't\ndescribe you as looking\nnice when i think about like people who\nlook nice i think about like\nyou know babysitters that i hire for my\nkids\nlike that's what i perceive as nice\nthey're like little old ladies\nyeah so like in my opinion and i'll wrap\nthis up where i'm so sorry i'm talking\nyour head off but\nso that in that intimating aspect for a\nlot of people\nit causes a fear right and here's what\nhappens right\nthis is the same thing i talk this in my\nstream a lot so i have this thing where\ni talk about certain things where people\nthink i'm gay\nokay now it's it's their very\nunderstanding and misunderstanding that\nmakes them think this it makes them\nthink that if i look at another man\nand i think that they're good looking\nthat has to mean i'm gay if i smack\ntheir ass or they smack mine out on an\nissue with it i must be gay but this\nisn't what\nthis isn't what defines whether you're\nstraight gay bisexual or whatever right\nso my point is it's the fear it's the\nnot knowing\nthat causes these ignorant beliefs of\nwhat\nmakes you what right so that was very\nquick with that example i know it sounds\nit was very sloppy i'm trying to be fast\nhere so what i'm trying to get to is\nthat intimidation that others see it\ncauses a\nfear and an ignorance so when you see\nthat\nyou want to either get away from it\ncompletely shut it out get it out of the\nscreen get it out of a position or you\nwant to bring it down\nand that that's what i feel like almost\nevery single encounter i have initially\nstarts as until there's an opportunity\nwhere we can just talk and hang out\nindividually right i'm always starting\nat a position\nwhere i need to work uphill or does that\nmake any sense\nit makes a lot of sense i think it goes\nalong with this theme of like\nyou're judged tyler and people have\nperceptions of you\nand you're very careful about how you\nmanage those because\nit sounds like when you haven't been\nyou've been burned\nthat's what i would hypothesize but\nmaybe a conversation for a different day\nbut i i think you're very careful about\nhow you're perceived\nyou're very in tune with what people\nthink of you\ni i don't know why that is or where it\ncomes from but i certainly see it and i\nthink it makes sense\nso recently last thing i swear last\nthing so recently\ni'll give you an example of why i'm like\nthis and why i'm like hyperactive this\narea i'm very paranoid\nrecently there was a situation where\ni did something right and it was a very\nit was a very like big something like\nmonetarily\nand when someone looked at it and then\nlooked at me and thought of me\nthe immediate reaction was i need to\nfind why he did this\nit can't be good it's too bad so\nnarrative was created is i did it\nfor free advertisement right and then\nyou have someone else\nthat does a fraction of a fraction of a\nfraction of it\nand they did it for the advertisement\nbut the way they're perceived because\nthey have a more humble look\nis wow even though you know even though\nthis\nright like others are given the benefit\nof the doubt whereas for me\nanything is found that matches the way i\nmake them\nfeel does that make any sense so because\nof this i'm very\ni'm very paranoid and i'm constantly\nlike trying to\nmake sure it's not i'm not taking the\nwrong way and i'm i feel like\ndoes that make any sense yeah\ni mean i don't know but anyway i'm sorry\ni i i can go for hours yeah just\ni think the rains wrap it up i apologize\nno that's okay i i think it's\nno not bad you know i i mean everything\nyou say train i think triggers things\nthan me\nand everything i say triggers things and\nyou i don't mean trigger in a bad way\num like for example hearing that and you\nknow we'll see if i can\nman should i restrain i don't want to\nrestrain asking the question so i feel\nlike i want to ask a question\nmore just to solidify it in my mind as\nopposed to get an answer from you but\nhow does it feel to constantly be judged\nlike that\nto not be given the benefit of the doubt\nto have all of your actions scrutinized\nyour words scrutinized to be\nmisinterpreted\nanyway but you can tell me whether\nyou know because you say your parent\nwhat's it like to be paranoid what's it\nlike to need to be paranoid\ni i think is the deeper question there\nare a lot of questions left i'm i'm with\nyou there\num so maybe something to think about\nyou tell me i i can't i'll tell you okay\ni'll tell you now so here's the way i\nsee it\nif you remember we talked about my\nfeeling the need to take an l\nor to take a sec to sacrifice to make\nothers feel good so\ni see so it it's not that i feel sad for\nbeing judged\nyou know i mean when we get deeper into\nit i'll explain it obviously\ni do have my moments where i'll just you\nknow\nyou know be in bed and i'll just you\nknow that never mind but the the point\nis\nit's not that i feel sad i see it as\nthat's the sacrifice i take and it\ndoesn't matter if\nothers i mean i'll fight it still don't\nget me wrong so it does matter i don't\nwant to say it doesn't matter but\nthat's the sacrifice that's the l i take\nknowing that there are people's lives\nthat are changing from what i'm doing\nand knowing that in order to continue to\nchange lives i need to keep taking this\nl\ndoing what i'm doing now on the other\nhand\non the other hand what unmotivates me\nis i'm cool with making that sacrifice\nbut what\nmakes me what chips away at me\nis the people\nthat are the true villains\nare praised as the heroes and given the\ncredibility of the heroes\nwhich in line creates a system that's\nnever going to fix itself\nbecause the very trickery that got us\ninto the problems of the system in the\nfirst place\nare continuously happening just evolving\nto be more advanced\nand then the people who actually are\nputting\nwords into action and not just speaking\nin this idealistic way but actually\nputting the actions behind it\nare seen as the villains and since the\nvillains\nthat are labeled as villains are the\nones that are actually proving with\naction\nand the heroes are only talking no\nchange\never happens and we're stuck in this\nperpetuating\nendless circle of\ncorruption [ __ ] and trash\nand no one can understand why this is\nhappening but what's that's happening\nbecause no one can actually look into\nthemselves and realize\nso does that make any sense so this time\ni'm gonna say no i completely lost you\nbro\nwhen you started talking about\ncorruption and the real heroes\nare being perceived as villains and the\nvillains are being perceived as heroes\nand and like like i i could follow like\npieces of that but i feel like there's\njust so much to that story\nwhich you started to toss in which i i\nhonestly i don't i don't know like\nwhat like who you're like i just don't\nhave the context\nwe talking about your english teacher\nare we talking about\npeople on twitch are we talking about\npeople like talking\nso i'm talking about the very thing that\nthat being so getting to a point of\nself-awareness and getting a point of\nknowing yourself\nwould bring this out in people i'm\ntalking so what i'm talking about\nis\nso what i'm saying is\ntrain i gotta jump in for a second sorry\nokay i'm sorry i i don't mean to leave\nlet's wrap it up\ni'm sorry but but i just need clarity\nfor you i'm happy if you want to finish\nthat thought but i do have i\nactually have a client this coming yeah\nyou're good i'm sorry yeah yeah\nso do you do you want to learn how to\nmeditate or do you want to finish your\nthoughts whichever okay let's meditate\nand often i'll\ni'll think more clearly and i'll come\nback and next time more clear\nokay yeah so i i didn't mean yes you\nknow i just i do no you're sort of\neliminated\nactually you let me know four different\ntimes i should have that was that was\nshameless of me that's my fault nope\ni mean i played ball right you would say\nsomething and then i would get curious\nbecause what you say is really\ninteresting\nand i do feel like we could talk for 15\nhours i i don't doubt that for a second\ni think it'd be fun to like go camping\nyou know and just just hang out in the\nwilderness for a while and and talk and\ni get stuck in a rant because i\nwhen i talk i see it yep so i\nyeah so i just get stuck in a rant yeah\nthe reason i was i was jumping in there\nis because i i\nliterally this is the first time i think\nyou've been really clear but i just\ndon't have the context to understand\nwhat you were saying earlier yeah it\nwould take so yeah so let me ask you\num i kind of feel like doing a\nparticular practice today that's a\nlittle bit different\ndo you want to repeat the do you think\nit would be helpful to do the same\npractice we did last time or try\nsomething else\nhonestly i think\nhey you know you take the reins and i'll\ni'll ride with i'll write on you\ni won't write on you that's a little\nweird i'm so sorry i'll write\nyou lead i'll follow go ahead okay um\nso let's so what i want you to sit up\nstraight\ni'm gonna teach you a practice we\nhaven't done a little while for a little\nwhile on stream but\nit it's called charging the laser beam\nand that's something that\nthat someone in chat came up with so\num the actual so this is a technique\nthat's uh\nsort of an introductory practice to\nthird eye meditations\nand third eye meditations are about\ncultivating like insight\nintuition and understanding that's\nbizarre\nbut basically uh last time you know we\ntaught you a breath meditation so now\ni'm going to teach you a meditation that\ninvolves\nfocusing essentially just focusing on\nyour third eye so what i want you to do\nis\num you know it's going to sound kind of\nlook weird but i want you to take\none finger i usually actually use the\nmiddle finger which i know is\nweird but there's a reason for that so\nwhat we want to do is\nis take your middle finger and actually\nhover it\njust sort of right between your eyebrows\ndon't touch yeah close your eyes\njust hold it there for a second\nand try to get close maybe like a\ncentimeter away\nand focus just a little bit above your\neyebrows\nsit up straight\ni want you to just focus on any\nsensations\nin your forehead and tell me do you feel\nanything\ni feel my middle finger tickling the\nlittle hairs of my forehead\nokay so try to pull a little bit away\nto where they can't touch\nand focus on those sensations so if it's\nactually\ntouch on hairs on your head you want to\npull a little bit further out\nand just focus on that part of your\nforehead\nyou can go ahead and relax your hand now\nand let your\nlet your focus maintain on that point\nokay and try to drive your attention\ninto it\nokay\njust keep pushing we'll practice for\nabout 60 or 90 seconds you can focus on\nsensations\non of your forehead or just\nmoving into that spot\nfor lack of a better term oh i'm on that\nspot right now\ngood keep your attention there\nwe'll go for about two minutes huh i\nleaned back and i lost it give me a sec\nhere we go\nokay all right let's go\nnow i want you to take your finger and\nmove it back to the spot\nfocus on your forehead\nnow relax your hand\nwe'll continue for about another minute\nnow i want you to take a deep breath in\nthrough your nose\nbreathe out slowly\nagain\nand out\nand then in for a third time and super\nslow\nout of your nose super super slow\nwhen you're ready open your eyes\nwhat was that like free\ncalming soothing peaceful\ni feel like i want to uh\ni feel like i want to go get a haircut\nbut skip the haircut and just get the uh\nshampoo part where i get the head\nmassaged you feel me on that yeah\nyeah yeah
