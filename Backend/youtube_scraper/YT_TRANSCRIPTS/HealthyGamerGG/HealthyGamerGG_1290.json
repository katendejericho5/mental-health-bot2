    "transcript": "so just a couple of announcements before\nwe jump in today with moist critical\ncritical with a k on september 4th we're\ngoing to be\nuh releasing coaching we're going to\nhave a bunch of spots kind of opening up\nfor more coaches\num so for those of you who don't know\ncoaches are\nbasically people from our community who\num i've trained personally to sort of\nhelp people in our community\nand attempt to duplicate dr k and\nyou know they're not they're not me but\nthey are actually pretty effective at\nhelping people so\npart of the cool thing about our\ncoaching program is i don't know if you\nguys are aware of this but i am a\nharvard andy\nso i'm a big believer in evidence-based\nmedicine and scientific methodology\num and so what we do is collect outcomes\nso we sort of\nmeasure the the effectiveness of our\ncoaches and they seem to be like pretty\ngood\num so the coaches are actually like\npeople from our community who are\npassionate committed intelligent\ntrained for a while um i work with all\nthe coaches on an ongoing basis in terms\nof supervising and continuing education\num so if they run into an issue with a\nclient like if you guys are stuck\nsomewhere in a session i'll sort of give\nthem advice or help them\nfigure out how to help you move forward\nso our coaches\nare really helped are there to help\npeople overcome issues like what we talk\nabout\nin streams so help you understand\nrelationships help you understand\nyourself better help you understand\nprocrastination things like that\nit's not a medical treatment so the\ncoaches are not there to diagnose or\ntreat your depression or your anxiety\nthey can certainly help you kind of\nthink about those things and understand\nthose things so it's not like\nyou can't talk about being anxious but\nit's really not a\ndiagnosis or treatment so if you guys\nwant to you can\nuh join the wait list\nyeah coaches get paid absolutely\nwho knows my notebook hey\noh good morning man\nholy [ __ ] your voice critical\nno you cut out what did you say i said\nholy [ __ ] you're moist critical\noh yeah yeah do you want an autograph i\ncan like sign you no no no i\ni didn't i didn't realize that was you\ndude dude\ni have actually recently discovered your\ncontent\nand i think it's awesome i appreciate\nthat man thank you\ni didn't i didn't realize who you were\nyou're penguins\nyeah yes sir yep yep yeah and you know i\nknow it's crazy because like\ni swear to god so just so you remember\nwe were on that podcast together\nand they introduced you as charlie right\nso i was like okay there's a dude here\nnamed charlie\nand i was like damn that charlie dude\nasks like really good questions\noh and is like like really like\nthoughtful about his questions i was\nlike that's a cool guy\nand then i didn't realize like and i was\nlike oh like it'd be cool if you know we\ncould hang out sometime\ntalk more because i really wanted i know\nyou'd ask questions but there are a lot\nof people who are asking questions\nabout mental health um and i thought\nthat was like really cool\nand then recently i saw a couple of your\nvideos about\num like leafy getting banned\nand then something today about like uh\nanimal videos on youtube and i was like\nhey it's that charlie guy\nand then i saw that your name was\npenguins\nand and i was like okay so his i guess\nhis name is penguins\nand then i i i [ __ ] you not man like let\nme show you that anyway\ni was just gonna dude you don't need to\nprove it\ni was taking a dump this morning and i\nwas watching your video about\num animal videos on youtube\num yeah that's a that's a scary rabbit\nhole right there that'll ruin your\n[ __ ] experience\nso and i didn't realize you were you\nwere known as moist critical\nso i apologize i have like i have this\nterrible habit of just making\nrandom [ __ ] names on every platform\nit's it's awful but\nit is what it is twitch is now asking me\nto show the dump\ncan you prove that yeah did you watch it\nyeah i it's too late for that\nbut it's it's funny i actually we talk a\nlot about poop in my household\num because then in traditional indian\nmedicine a good sign of proper\ndigestion and diet is your poop and\nso that sounds about right yeah that's\nthat's how they used to tell\nwhether uh you know whether your bowels\nare functioning properly or and what not\nbut they used to use a a long time ago\nthe vikings used to use onion soup and\nif they could smell it through your\nwounds it meant you were gonna die\nbecause the infection spread or\nsomething right\nfascinating i didn't know that but i\nguess that makes sense\num interesting yeah\nin ancient india speaking of you know\nexcretory material a good way that they\nwould test whether you had diabetes or\nnot is they would have you piss near an\nant mound\nand if the ants came in and actually\nlike drank up the piss\nit meant that you had sugar in your\nurine and that got diabetes\nthat's huge yeah it was really great um\nbut theoretically people also maybe were\num just drinking urine which is\npossible but i i like the ant test\nbetter\nyeah i think the ant test seems a little\nmore sound yeah\ninvolves consuming less urine so we're\nbig fans of that\nabsolutely so uh and what do you want me\nto call you do\nlike charlie or oh yeah yeah just\ncharlie you don't have to use any like\nyou know titles or anything man just\ncasual\num and and so tell me a little bit is\nthere something in particular i i\nnoticed that some uh my producers have\nlike put a list of questions but um\nis there something that you want to talk\nabout today or something that can be\nhelpful\ni'm game to just talk about whatever the\nthe way your producers talked about it\nsounds like we just talked about what\nwas prevalent what's going on\nokay kind of you know shoot the [ __ ]\nthere's no boys\nokay that that sounds great to me so\njust to clarify sometimes i have\npersonal conversations with people about\ntheir life\nand sometimes i talk with people about\nstuff\ndo you have a preference of are we\nshooting the [ __ ] about other things are\nwe talking about\nyou well your chat actually brought up\nsomething interesting\nwe can talk about addiction that's kind\nof become pretty prevalent in my\ncommunity recently because\nokay i'm sure you would understand i've\nbeen very big into buying yu-gi-oh boxes\nand opening them on stream\nokay some simpletons would refer to this\nas a form of gambling\nyeah it's because you know not too\ndifferent from like ea loot boxes you're\nyou're buying\na mystery i consider it mystery\ninvesting in the yu-gi-oh cards\nbut there's a lot of people that think\nthat perhaps i have a susceptibility to\ngambling\nbecause of this what do you think\ni think it's simply for the for the fun\nof opening some yu-gi-oh cards the the\nunexpected\nthrill when we pull that starlight that\nthat rush of dopamine i think\nall of that sounds like a gambling\naddiction but i think what it actually\nis gonna say\nyou get a pretty good case for an\naddiction the thrill was that it's fun\nyeah you know just that that fun with\nthe chat you know you get to shoot\nyou know shoot the [ __ ] in the chat make\nsome jokes get very disappointed when we\ndon't\npull a star light we get to feel the\nhighs and lows\nand so maybe you know maybe i do have a\ngambling addiction what do you think\ni i wouldn't know i mean so far i know\nall i know is that you're a guy who\nopens yu-gi-oh cards\nthat's right so let me ask you do you uh\nso my understanding is that yu-gi-oh is\na card game right\nyeah yeah yeah um do you play the game\nno no i just collect the cards okay\nright so so so that's like a let's let's\nthink about a spectrum of addiction\nso you've just shifted towards addiction\nright if you don't\nif you but at the same time people\ncollect all kinds of stuff so it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that you're addicted\nlike\npeople collect stamps right so that's\nuseless\nand are yu-gi-oh cards useful if you\ndon't play a game with them\nit's the implication i could battle if i\nneeded to i could make some monster\ndecks\nand i think that's what makes me scary\nto the community\nthat you could unleash your monster deck\nof you go cards\non some unsuspecting new noob if you\nif the if it if this reason arose\nyeah you can't do that with stamps like\nwhat are you going to do with stamps\njust throw them at someone that's\nworthless\nyou're going to send mail with them oh\nyeah who cares right yeah like a ballot\nor something like that a bill a letter\nyou know okay so i mean\nso are you serious that your your\ncommunity kind of jokes about maybe\nyou having like an addiction to\nyeah so i don't know if it's i know at\nleast a couple people earnestly think i\nhave an addiction\ni i i don't but maybe like they grew up\nin a household they're an environment\nwhere they were around people that\nmaybe had like a real gambling addiction\nyou know maybe went to the casino more\ntimes than they should\nstuff like that and i i don't see the\nsame qualities here because i make it\npretty clear that it's just for like the\nstream content and the fun\nand highlight the videos for youtube\nbecause i think a lot of the fun\ncomes from just like the unexpected\npolls\nand like the you know the jokes you can\nmake when a bad card comes up\njust i think it's more about the journey\ninstead of the destination\ni don't really think it's more like i'm\nthere to make money or i'm gonna be\nreally [ __ ] disappointed if i don't\nget this one thing\nand i don't think a lot of people can\nrecognize the difference between\njust that kind of stuff for some content\nversus a real\nyou know gambling problem or a real\naddictive personality disorder\nokay so is it okay if we talk about that\nfor a second\nso maybe what we can do charlie and i'm\nthrilled that we're having this\nconversation because i would love to\nhave this conversation with you it's\nlike we can talk about what addiction is\nright so what do you think makes an\naddiction\nhow do we know whether someone is\naddicted to something like\ndo i love do i just enjoy gambling or\nam i addicted how do you what do you\nthink\nso i guess uh in my voice correct in my\nperspective\ni think it becomes an addiction when it\nbecomes like the forefront of your\nmind where you're thinking like i've\nmade this amount of money which means i\nhave this amount of gambling money to\nset aside or\nyou know it becomes something that\nyou're constantly thinking about as a\nmeans of\nmaking money or as a way of staying\nhappy like i have to gamble\nand this will make me happy but if i\ndon't get this i'm gonna be real sad\nso i think it just more becomes to me an\naddiction\nwhen it's something you're constantly\nharping on something that's always on\nyour\nlike on your mind you know what i mean\nsure so there's a certain constancy of\nmind i want to\ntunnel down into actually i think a\ncouple of words which\ni you didn't seem to emphasize but i\nthink are really important\nyou use the word have to right so you\nsaid i\nhave to to make me happy to make money\nwhatever\nso i think that there's a certain\ncompulsion which i think is actually\nreally important it's not so much about\nwhat's on what's after the have to or\nwhat's before the have to\nit's the phrase have to there's a\ncertain amount of constancy\nin your mind so like let's say that\nand and so i'm just trying to think\nabout\nsituations where let's say i have to go\nto work\nand i'm constantly thinking about work\nlet's say i'm an investment banker\nso this is common right so they they\nspend a lot of time\ngoing to work they feel like they have\nto\num it occupies their mind they get to\nsleep for like four hours a night\ndo we call that an addiction yeah\nright i wouldn't call that an addiction\nthat would be more of a profession\nthat is that is actually what they do\nfor a living it is an entire career\nbuilt around it\ni think i guess maybe for me the\ndistinction would be if it's not a\ncareer\njust this hobby that has become this\nabsolute\nfocal point of your life where it's\ntaking over other parts of it\nokay taking over other parts i think\nthat's really important too\nso we're we're getting to a really sort\nof classical\nmedical definition of of addiction step\nby step\ntaking over other parts of your life so\nlet's think about something\num else so let's say that i play league\nof legends for 12 or 14\n12 hours a day um i\nam failing out of college\ni'm master's league or master's level or\nwhatever\nand i want to go pro what do we call\nthat\nis that a career or an addiction what do\nyou think\nthat's tough to me that would be a\npassion but i think it would be a little\nmisplaced\nthere has to be a balance i think\nobsession in any of its forms such as\nthat like being obsessed with this drive\nto make it to the next level in league\ni don't think anything positive ever\ncomes from that\nso for me i'd call that another\nunhealthy addiction\nto a certain degree but for that person\ni guess\nmaybe passion would be more the right\nterm for them because they're clearly\nvery into the game they clearly see a\ncareer and a future in it\nbut they're letting other parts of their\nlives slip and fall down the [ __ ] for\nit\nwhich is what most programmers do right\nbefore they make it pro they tend to\nmake these sacrifices\nand they devote themselves fully to an\nideal so i'm hearing you kind of say\nyou'd put that ultimately in the passion\nbucket\nyeah more so than a like yeah\nthat'd definitely say passion okay um\nso then let let me just kind of\nhighlight a couple of thoughts one is\nyou mentioned have to so i think\ncompulsion is a part of addiction right\nsort of a sense of a lack of control\nover your actions the second thing is a\ncertain constancy in your mind which you\nsort of alluded to that it's at the\nforefront of your mind is what you said\nyou're kind of thinking about it all the\ntime um i think that's also a feature of\naddiction so a preoccupation with the\nthing\nso when if you think about if you talk\nwith alcoholics like a lot of them will\nbe thinking about\nokay like if they're going on vacation\nin their mind their mind will be sort of\nfiguring out okay when can i drink how\ncan i drink\num when am i going to get my next drink\nand then i think a big part and this is\nultimately what sort of determines\naddiction for me i think it's really\nimportant is when you talked about\ntaking over\nother parts of your life so i would call\nthat like sort of the medical term is\nimpairment of function\nso if it interferes with your personal\nprofessional academic\nlife or your physical or mental health\nit's more likely to be an addiction\nthat sounds about right to me so i know\nwe don't diagnose or treat\nthings on stream you're aware of that\nright\nright so but now let's just think about\nyu-gi-oh sort of as an academic example\nwould you say you hit those bullets so\ndo you feel like some degree of\ncompulsion to buy yu-gi-oh cards\nthat i will absolutely concede on that\nit was like\neven just four nights or two nights ago\nwhenever i opened the last\n[ __ ] 34 boxes of rise of the duelist\nthat night i was like i need to get more\ni need to find this card which doesn't\nhelp my case\nlike i realize that makes me look like\nan addict but sure in my\nmy defense like i've got to find that\n[ __ ] card you know what i mean like\nthe stream's not complete without\nfinding it okay\nso what i'm hearing is that you do sort\nof have a sense of compulsion but it\nalso sounds like\nin in your sense you're sort of making a\nit sounds to me like it's almost like a\ncareer kind of thing for you\nwhere you've decided that the stream is\nabout\nfinding the card well yeah not the whole\nstream i'm not like a yu-gi-oh streamer\nthese days or anything it's just a fun\nlittle side quest we've been going on\nhere\ni guess more so it's a compulsion with a\ngoal\nit's like really aggressively chasing a\ngoal which is finding you know that\nthat white whale that starlight rare\nwe've been looking for\nyou know what i mean okay okay so\nthere's a particular goal do you find\nthat you're thinking about it relatively\nconstantly\nno no no the only time i really think\nabout it is when the the boxes come at\nthe door and i'm like [ __ ] this is the\none and then when it's not i'm like [ __ ]\ni'm thinking about it again\nwait so i'm confused so you're thinking\nabout it when the box arrives at the\ndoor and then when you\nopen the boxes and you're done then\nyou're thinking about it again\nyeah those are really like the only two\ntimes i'm ever really thinking about\ngetting more cards or thinking about\ncards in general really\nhow many hours a day would you send you\nyou say you spend thinking about\nyu-gi-oh\noh man it sounds it makes me sound like\na child\nuh not much i'd say it's a the only\ntimes i'm thinking about it\nlike i said is when i actually have the\nboxes and i'm excited to open them on\nstream\nand when we just finished doing it and\nwe didn't and we didn't get what we were\ngoing for\ni'm sorry sorry for making it sound like\nyou were a child do you feel like a\nchild\noh you know what a little bit yeah you\nknow when i'm opening yugioh you know\nmakes me feel like a little boy again\nyou know it's\nthat's a feeling you can't emulate these\ndays it's one of those things you crack\nopen that nice pack you get that nice\nbeautiful aroma of some fresh cards you\nknow back like on christmas day 2006\nit's lovely\nit's a blast of nostalgia so yeah it\nmakes me feel like a kid a little bit\nis that a bad thing not at all\nokay so it sounds like you don't think\nabout it constantly\nyeah and would you say that it impairs\nyour function or takes over other parts\nof your life\nno i i definitely wouldn't say so i\ndon't think i'm losing my life to\nyu-gi-oh or anything i haven't been like\nneglecting my\ndogs or anything for yukio kart yeah i\nmean so i think that's a pretty good\nlike you know i i i mean i've never\nheard of a yu-gi-oh addiction before but\ni think if you're\nyou know if people are are watching and\nare kind of thinking a little bit about\nis this an addiction i think those are\nthe important questions to ask\nexactly and if the answer to all three\nof those\nor you know even two out of three is yes\nlike you may want to consider like\ngetting that checked out or getting\nevaluated\nor and i think really impairment to\nfunction is the most important one\nso if it's interfering with other parts\nof your life then\ni mean it sounds to me like you're\nreally interested in yugioh it sounds\nlike you have a nostalgic connection to\nit\nit sounds like it makes you feel like a\nkid which is kind of fun\nand alluring in a world where you know\neverything is going to [ __ ]\num yeah and it's also like something\nthat you're doing with your audience\nwhich sounds kind of like fun and\nengaging\nsort of like a bit of career a bit of\nnostalgia\nand at the end of the day is not causing\nyou to neglect your dogs\nthat's right i'm not hearing that you go\n14 hours a day without eating or\ndrinking or using the bathroom because\nyou're opening yu-gi-oh cards\nnot yet but maybe i just haven't got\nenough boxes who knows\nyeah i guess one other thing to just\nthink a little bit about is whether from\na financial perspective you can afford\nto\npurchase and open all the yu-gi-oh packs\nthat you're buying\nmake sure to be very careful with that\nkind of stuff i i very rarely spend\nmoney so when i do i feel like real\nguilty so i\nmake sure to look over it very\nthoroughly why do you feel guilty when\nyou spend money\nit's just how i grew up i never really\npurchased anything\ni just kind of always saved and hoarded\nmoney\nand either gave it away or you know\noccasionally spent it on something every\nnow and then\nso with the yu-gi-oh it's been very\ndifferent because the only thing i would\never buy is movie tickets and food\nand then i bought those yu-gi-oh boxes\nfor stream once and i was like damn this\nwas fun in the chat really enjoyed it\nso then i spent more money on it and\nlike damn i'm kind of feeling a little\nslimy about this\nokay i don't know just to something uh\nyou know just something a little\ndifferent\ncharlie i noticed that you crossed your\narms are you feeling comfortable talking\nabout this stuff\nyeah i just don't know what to do with\nmy hands because typically i have them\non the keyboard here\nsince i'm facing the camera i don't know\nwhat to do with them no problem i i just\num do you mind if i ask a little bit\nabout you kind of feeling guilty about\nspending money growing up and\nboarding shows yeah it's an open book\nhelp help me understand\num you know a little bit about how you\ngrew up\nand and how you viewed spending money\nuh so yeah my parents were they made\nsure to instill in me the value of a\ndollar\nright uh i if i was begging for\nsomething at toys r us\ni wouldn't get it my dad and mom be like\nnope\nyou can't have that you you know that's\nthat's that\nwe'll give you this toy but you can't\nhave two toys that kind of thing\nso is the idea of not being spoiled and\ni just kind of\nmade me feel as i grew up and started\nhaving more money just more frugal with\nit i didn't want to just\nbuy all of these materialistic things\nbecause i just didn't need them you know\nwhat i mean it was just one of those\nthings where i don't need it i'll save\nthis money\nuse it for something better as opposed\nto something\nyou know just for me so\nthe way i view money is like making fun\ncontent out of it spending money for\ncontent is always when i'm happiest when\nit comes to money\nas opposed to buying something like a\nyugioh box that i open in private while\ni'm scratching at my neck having an\nepisode or something you know what i\nmean\nokay what do you mean by having an\nepisode was that a joke\noh yeah no i'm just kidding that\nhappened okay hold on a second\ni thought it was a joke i was like i was\nlike i was envisioning like an episode\nof like yu-gi-oh withdrawal where you're\nlike\nferal in the closet like opening up\npacks and kind of scratching yourself\nsort of thing okay i said just i thought\nthat was\na funny image just kidding um\nyeah so that's kind of interesting um\nand and do you have a sense of why your\nparents felt it was so important to\ninstill in you the value of a dollar\nuh yeah i grew up in an area that had a\nlot of spoiled kids like a lot of real\n[ __ ] you know parents that would\njust ignore them and give their kids\nwhatever they want it's not too\ndifferent from parents these days\njust give their kids an ipad and tell\nthem to go do whatever so\nmy parents didn't like that and they\nwanted to make sure i didn't turn out to\nbe one of those spoiled kids that just\nhad everything handed to them and just\nyou know\nlive life with this silver spoon where\neverything they wanted they got\nyou know what i mean and i think that\nwas just a really valuable lesson\nbecause i've\ni've definitely i feel like it's a lot\nbetter to spend\nmy money on things that other people can\nenjoy like you know fun content or stuff\nlike that\nor giving it to people that could use it\nmore use it\nfor something in their life you know\nwhat i mean sure so so just for me\nversus something better\nyeah and do you remember how you felt as\na kid when your parents\nyou know sort of said like hey i mean\nwhat was it like to grow up surrounded\nby\nkids who got two toys instead of one and\nyou only getting one toy\nit never really bothered me i never\nreally had too much of a problem with it\ni\nfrom a young age i was like you know\nwhat that's totally fine i can\nunderstand why my parents are\nwanting me to learn this my parents i\nthink have been just incredible role\nmodels they\nit always treated everyone with so much\nrespect and did everything they could\nfor\neveryone around them and i always\nrecognized that as a really good thing\nso the fact that they were telling me\nlook it's better if you just\nlearn that you can't always have\neverything you want at a young age\nand you'll benefit from it so it never\nreally bothered me that you know my\nfriends would have all this crazy [ __ ]\nit wasn't really a big deal to me okay\nbecause i realized i didn't need it you\nknow what i mean\nokay um that's really impressive man so\nit sounds like\nnot only did they sort of uh teach you\nthe value of a dollar but i'm also\nhearing that they spent the time and\nenergy\nto try to explain to you what they were\ndoing and why they were doing it\nso they they would explain everything to\nme man i don't know if you remember this\nbut there was a nascar\nracer called dale earnhardt yeah and my\nmy\nparents loved nascar one of their\nbiggest weaknesses i don't know why they\nlike nascar but they loved it and i was\nwatching nascar\nand that accident happened where he\ncrashed into the wall and died\nand my parents immediately like without\nmissing a beat it's like they had\n[ __ ] scripted his death they're like\ncharlie this is death\nand you need to understand what this\nmeans like i was always be getting\nlessons and\ni think that that really just kind of\nhelped me understand things at a younger\nage\nas opposed to like you know having to\nlearn it the harder way\nor you know later on what's the harder\nway\nyeah i said as far as death i don't know\nbut as for not getting everything you\nwant\nyou know realizing that you can't always\nhave everything\nyou know what i think is the harder way\nby yourself because what i'm merely\nhearing from you is that\nyou know what you you learned a lot of\nthings not alone\nlike you had parents who took the time\nto really try to explain to you things\nhelp you understand things\nit's interesting i think it makes a lot\nof sense because you seem to me to be\nlike i mentioned you at the beginning\nwhen i was fanboying a little bit\num that you know i think you ask really\ngood questions and you're an insightful\ndude\nand it's kind of interesting to to see\nthat from a young age your parents\ntaught you how to think or encourage you\nto think\nor find reasons or try to understand\nthings\nyeah well i appreciate that man yeah i\nreally can't thank my parents enough for\nthe upbringing i think the\na lot of the the reason that i am the\nway i am today is because of everything\nthey taught me\nsure i really appreciate that if you're\nin the chat mom and dad keep up the\ngreat work\nlove you um so\nso charlie if i can just kind of point\nsomething out to you that i think is a\nlittle bit strange so\ni think you know you kind of say i don't\nneed it\nwhich sort of makes sense and but that\nseems to me like a little bit\ndifferent or maybe related to feeling\nguilty when you do\nindulge what do you think about that\nyeah i guess that might be a little part\nof it because at the end of the day i\ndon't need\nyu-gi-oh cards right like my stream's\nnot gonna you know go to the [ __ ] if\ni'm not opening yu-gi-oh cards like some\nkind of crazy feral animal\nit's not something i need and when i buy\nit it does make me feel a little guilty\nbecause again\nit is big purchases right like 34 boxes\nof yu-gi-oh cards that was like\nseventeen hundred dollars like that's\nthat's not like a small purchase it's\nsomething i feel guilty about\nspending that much on something like\nthat which is\nagain just this this thing just for some\nfun on the stream\nand no i think the fact yeah i just\nthink the fact that i don't need it and\nyou know it just makes me feel a little\nslimy\nyeah so so oddly enough i think the fact\nthat you do it for a stream\nis what makes it okay for you so i think\nstream is a good reason that protects\nyou from the guilt\nbecause you strike me as someone who\nwouldn't buy 34 boxes of yu-gi-oh cards\nunless you had\na quote-unquote good reason right\nand i i think now i'm gonna say\nsomething a little bit provocative okay\nso i think the interesting thing that\ni'm hearing from you is a good reason as\nanything except for yourself\nthat's fair i mean that's that's\nprobably fair yeah\nwhat do you think about that ah\ni think there's a lot of truth to it the\nmore i think about it the the more i\nrealize i don't buy anything really for\nmyself all my purchases are either food\nfor me and my girlfriend or movie\ntickets for me and my girlfriend\ni guess like the last thing i bought\nsimply for me to enjoy was a dance dance\nrevolution machine\nand now that i'm talking about this out\nloud it seems like everything i buy is\nsomething that a nine-year-old would\nthink is cool\nbut uh yeah i don't really buy a whole\nlot solely for me to enjoy\nbut that's because i like to share\neverything with everybody like if i have\nsomething i put it on stream or i make a\nyoutube video out of it\nyeah so once again everything that you\nhave is for other people\nyeah i guess so huh right\nyeah and not to be a little bit um\nfurther provocative but like let's just\nthink it's just\ni'm thinking about some of my\nsupervisors who would just really love\nto make some kind of bizarre conclusion\nlike\nyou know it sounds like your parents\ntaught you about very mature things at a\nvery young age\nthat you weren't able to indulge in\ngetting two toys and sort of live\nlife freely and openly which is why as\nan adult you're chasing the feelings of\na child\ni'm not chasing any children don't you\nput those words feelings feelings\nright so so you you kind of keep\ncommenting that\nit makes me sound like i'm a kid and so\nso some of my\nlike analytic supervisors would be like\noh he is trying to rediscover his\nchildhood in adulthood because he was\nrobbed of it\nbecause his parents taught him about\ndeath at a young age instead of letting\nhim indulge\nand be a child can you believe that\nunbelievable\nunbelievable what do you think about\nthat i\ni definitely wouldn't agree with that i\ndon't think i'm trying to chase the\nfeeling of anything i missed as a kid i\nfeel like i had a great childhood\nyeah and it's not like i was you know in\nthe streets selling lemonade\nyou know it's a war-torn area for money\nso i could buy something for myself\nlike my parents obviously got me things\nbut it was this idea of there's no need\nto have\neverything you always want at every\ngiven moment\nyeah of course definitely just the\nbalancing act of making sure i wasn't\nspoiled\nbut also making sure that i wasn't you\nknow going hungry and\nnot having things to have fun with yeah\ni mean because because like like you\nsaid you know just to be clear\nwe're not talking about zero toys versus\ntwo toys we're talking about one toy\nso you go to toys r us and you get one\ntoy\nyou know and so sort of makes sense\num at the same time i am a little bit\nyou know i do wonder a little bit\ncharlie about sort of putting yourself\nlast or not being able to put yourself\nfirst\nand how you feel about that um\ni never really look at it that way\nbecause in general not my happiest when\ni'm making\nlike cool content or i'm making bigger\nprojects like\nthe music video i did earlier this year\nthat was like the biggest undertaking\ni've done it was a year-long\nproject a full animation and it was\nexpensive but i liked it doing it\nbecause i like\nputting that kind of stuff out there and\ni would say like that's\nfor me as well as for sharing it with\nother people i would say making\nsomething like that was putting myself\nfirst but it's also something that i got\nto share with everybody\nwhich is what i really enjoy yeah so i\ndon't i really don't view it as a like\nme putting myself\nlast where you know i'm i you know not\nspending anything on myself making sure\nthat i'm taken care of or anything like\nthat\nit's just more so i enjoy doing things\nthat i can share with everybody else\nwhat do you enjoy about that\nall right i was wondering what that was\nmy doorbell doesn't work so it just it\njust says install cover there's someone\nat the door\num what was the question sorry i just\nuh i forgot um\nyeah i forgot give me a second all right\nno worries\noh yeah what what do you enjoy about\nsharing things with other people\num i don't know just always been a\nreally fulfilling thing i've just always\nenjoyed\nmaking things for the fun of making them\nand then putting them out there for the\nworld to enjoy or [ __ ] on really\nyou don't have to love everything i do i\ndon't expect everyone to love everything\ni do like i\ni don't do it for that kind of that kind\nof reason it's just i have a lot of fun\ndoing it\nand since i had fun hopefully other\npeople have fun watching it or\ninteracting with it in some way and i\njust really enjoy that\njust being able to you know help\nentertain somebody maybe\nwhat is what is that feeling when you\nkeep on using the word enjoy what what\ndo you feel when\nsomeone when you share something with\nsomeone and they're able to appreciate\nit\num\njubilation i'll use a hard word there i\ni'd say like i\nreally feel great when someone's like\nlook charlie that video\nwas really [ __ ] cool skynet i'd never\neven thought about robots being powered\nby semen that was\nwild that makes me feel like really good\noh yes the the music videos about robots\npowered by semen\nit's you have to read them yeah like\nit's\ns e a m e n or\ni'll break down the storyline as a\nlittle lore recap in skynet\nit's basically terminator if the\nmachines were powered by\nnut as opposed to technology electricity\nyeah it's it's deep there's there's a\nlot of moving parts to that i\ndon't even want to get into it the fan\nisn't wild is something that\nyou made or is something okay\nyeah so uh i have a band with a buddy of\nmine named troy and we made this song\nthat's all about that\nand then we hired an animation studio to\nanimate all of it\nand that was by far the biggest project\ni've done and putting that out there and\nseeing people\nreally enjoy it or you know really\nrelate to it in some strange ways just\nreally cool\nit just made me feel very happy charlie\nit sounds like the world is lucky to\nhave you\nthat was sweet thanks man i'm\nwhat are you right\nyou're just being sweet man i don't know\nit was just very nice\ni wasn't trying to be nice\ncan i explain myself a little bit i'm\ncurious how how it sounded when\nhow you felt when i said that all right\nsure man\nwell let me just because like look so\nyou're you're like one of these content\ncreators right\nand and it sounds like i imagine you\nmake a fair amount of money\nand it sounds like what you really try\nto do is you strike like a really good\nbalance of\nbeing sort of authentic and not catering\nto the masses or giving them the kind of\ncontent that they want but really that\nyour goal is to\ndo something that you find like\ninteresting and fulfilling and\ni think you use a really interesting\nword which is subtle and has a lot of\nconnotation which is share\nso you share something without\nexpectation\nright you give it to people and you say\nhey i hope you enjoy this i enjoyed it\nyou don't say i need you to enjoy it\nwhich is what happens with a lot of\ncontent creators\nyou know i want you to enjoy it how can\ni make something so that you enjoy it\nthe most\nthat's not what i'm hearing from you\nwhat i'm hearing is that\nyou know you have some resources and you\ninvest those resources to a certain\ndegree\nin personal satisfaction but also that\nlike you really try to align personal\nsatisfaction with things that other\npeople can make\nthe world a slightly brighter place or\nmake someone stay better\nman that was yeah that i think you hit\nthe nail on the head man i really\nappreciate that\nit means a lot to even like hear someone\nexplain it that way because that's\ndefinitely how i feel like i don't make\nthese things trying to cater to some\nkind of you know\npopular take or popular opinion like you\nknow no one's talking about\nnut-powered machines you know it's just\ni enjoyed it\ni like putting it out there and it\nalways means a lot when people like it\nand if they don't that's fine too like\nmaybe they could make fun of it and they\ncould have fun that way really\nit's just you know just the the cycle of\nhow i like to\nto create things and just the way i kind\nof live my life thinking of\nwell here's something i could do that\nmaybe other people would enjoy yeah\nand so what what was it like to hear me\nsay that\nah man it felt like five different\nangels all tickling my nut sack like it\nwas just soothing like you just\nmade me feel so at ease and like\nfulfilled it was\nwonderful okay\ndo do you feel i mean hey\ni don't put this back is that an unusual\nfeeling\nangel's tickling your nut sack well it's\nyou know it doesn't happen as often as\ni'd like\nyou know what i mean but it's just a\nnice feeling i don't know man\ni've always watched it like i watch your\nshow obviously and i always appreciate\nwhat you're able to do for the community\naround here not just the people you\nbring on stream but also the chat as\nwell i think you do a lot of good work\neven making people in the chat\nfeel like they're learning something\nabout themselves and feeling good about\nthemselves so\ni mean i'll make a bold claim here i\nthink you're tickling a lot of nut sacks\nand making people feel\na lot better yeah that's that's\ngenerally speaking what my fbi file is\nfilled with\nyes\nthey call me aka nut sacticler\noh i believe it man you're notorious out\nhere\num yeah so\ncharlie i i think uh you know i wasn't\ntrying to tickle the nut sack but i\nthink you genuinely offered um\nyou know something that i heard which is\nthat i think you do kind of go\nout of your way really i think that's\nactually what's pretty cool about it is\nthat you don't go out of your way to\nmake people feel better what i really\nhear you doing is\noffering the most authentic parts of\nyourself with the hope that other people\ncan benefit from them\nand there's just something really like\npure about that and i just wanted to\nacknowledge it\nbecause i think it's cool man well thank\nyou man i'm glad you i'm glad you think\nit's cool\nit really does mean a lot to me and\nyeah so i i i do i do think there's\nsomething here charlie which i think\nnot necessarily that we need to explore\nfurther but sometimes when people you\nsaid something like\nuh you know you do it you do some things\njust for yourself\nas opposed to like having a better\nreason to do them\num and and i i i know we\ni sort of mentioned that you kind of put\nother people ahead of yourself which i\nthink is a really noble and awesome\nthing i think it's part of what\nresults in what we just talked about\nright that you really do authentically\ntry to create things kind of for\nyourself but then do your best\nto try to share them with other people\ni do wonder a little bit um about\ncan i just think for a second and try to\nfigure out how to say this hey by all\nmeans man\nso sometimes people are taught\nthat other people are more important\nthan they are\nand there's a very subtle so if you put\nsomeone ahead of yourself\nthere can be a couple of reasons for\nthat\none is that you just value other people\nright so like\nthe person besides you can have a lot of\nvalue\nthe other reason that you can put people\nahead of yourself is that you can value\nyourself\nvery low does that make sense it's kind\nof like a comparison\nno i totally i'm not saying that you\nvalue yourself\nlowly but i can envision a world in\nwhich a kid is surrounded by\na bunch of rich kids um and\ni'm not saying this is you by the way\ni'm just sort of sketching this out okay\nand it's\nyour your you have to tell me whether\nthis fits or doesn't fit or whether you\nwant to explore it further or not\ni'm envisioning if you take a hundred\nkids that are surrounded by\na hundred kids with lots of toys\nand they're the one that doesn't get as\nmany toys\nthat out of those hundred kids some of\nthem will think\nor feel like they are worth less than\ntheir peers\ndoes that make sense yeah i could\ndefinitely envision that too but for me\npersonally i don't think it goes like\nthat deep when it comes to putting other\npeople ahead of myself\ni wouldn't say i value those other\npeople more than i value myself\ni'd still say at the end of the day i\ncare more about myself\nthan somebody that i have never met\nbefore\nand what's going on there i i just\nreally like to be able to\nmaybe produce something for them that\nthey can enjoy as well\nit's not because i'm thinking like you\nknow what they deserve\nsomething here and i don't deserve any\nof this i don't think i've ever really\nfelt that way\nas far as like uh you know that kind of\nfeeling maybe in high school i felt like\nreally low\non myself and maybe put others far\nhigher than me\nbut sure i've grown a lot since then in\nhigh school i mean that's just rough for\neveryone you know i'd like [ __ ]\npimply face i took accutane twice\ni was beating my dick every night it was\nmiserable right like it's a high school\nexperience\nbut since then i don't think i've ever\nreally had like this really low\nself-image or self-worth or anything\nlike that where\neveryone around me is more important and\ni'm trash\nyeah yeah so i'm not getting that sense\nfrom you i i'm getting a sense that\nyou're\nconfident you recognize your own worth\nand at the same time\nyou sort of acknowledge in a simple sort\nof like human way that\nother people are super important to and\nthat the really cool thing is that it\nseems like you can hit both of those\nyou know birds with one stone in terms\nof you can do something for yourself\nand do something for other people and\nthat the two aren't actually like\none doesn't have to come at the cost of\nthe other that's what i think is\nactually really cool about a lot of what\nyou spend your time on\nis that sure you can enjoy opening\nyu-gi-oh cards but your stream enjoys it\ntoo\nright and it's it's fun for all of you\nguys together\nyeah there's some real enablers in there\nthough i'll tell you what they'll tell\nme i don't have enough\ncards and i feel like i have to [ __ ]\nprove them wrong about to flip my desk\nover and just order 34 more\nhow many how many packs are in a box\n24 packs in a box wow\nand why do you order 34 boxes\nwhy 34. well you see it's simple\nmathematics the more boxes the more\nchances of pulling that one starlight\nwe've been hunting for\nbut why not 36 or 40 or 42 why\njesus you're sounding like my chat\nyou're going to make me order 100 boxes\nby the end of this stream\n[Music]\nthat's what the seller had i just\nordered out a full seller oh\ngot it okay yes you know this is gonna\ntake a a kind of a a dark turn but\nsometimes when i deal with people who\nhave had a suicide attempt with taking\ntoo many pills\nthey'll say like i took 27 pills and\nthen i'll be like\nwhy 27 like why not 24 or 30.\nand and often the the common answer is\nbecause that's\neverything that was in the bottle\num so it sounds like you know they were\nemptying out their supply too\nwhich is a little bit morbid but that's\ni like to think that buying out the\nyugioh boxes wouldn't be as\nhardcore as swallowing a bottle of pills\nbut maybe i just haven't bought enough\nboxes yet\nyou drown in the youtube cards or\nsomething so\ncharlie i do wonder a little bit about\nyou know why you\nfeel guilty right where does that mean\nthe wrong word maybe it's just uh maybe\nthat you know kind of little\nicky feeling you get sometimes where you\ndid something and it's like well\nyeah but i could have done this this\nwould have probably\nbeen a better use of this time or this\nresource\nmaybe guilty's just a little too hard of\na word for what i feel because it's not\nlike i'm\nwaking up in a cold sweat like charlie\nyou have sinned and now we can't sleep\nbecause of it\nit's just when i make that decision it's\nlike ah that's you know\nthat's a little that's a little icky\nright what's icky\n[Music]\nit's just like that that nagging\nsensation where\ni'm trying to think of a good way of\nputting it because it's not like\nterrible i don't feel\nabsolutely destroyed if i buy yu-gi-oh\nboxes\ni'm not inconsolable i'm not in the\ncorner crying about it it's just like\nthere's other people that want to buy\nthese things and i just bought this\nentire seller's supply for the sake of\nopening it on stream\ndid i need to buy all of them no\nprobably not this stream probably would\nhave been just as fun with\nhalf of those boxes okay\nso just a little bit like you know\ndidn't need to do that i went a little\nhard there and now i feel a little gross\nfor doing that because now maybe\nsomebody\nthat wanted those or maybe someone's\nparents were going to order from that\nseller for their kid or something\nnow they can't because well now the\ngrease king's sitting on all 34 boxes\nsee so so it sounds like once again in\nthe in the ickiness what we're thinking\nabout is\nin a weird way your mind is kind of\nthinking about the possibility that\nthrough your indulgence you've deprived\nsomeone else of\nan opportunity that's definitely fair\nbecause there's there's only so many\nboxes right and i just took a huge\nchunk of them off the market so for the\nfans of the game that actually play the\ngame and keep in mind i don't actually\ngo out and battle they can't get those\ncards now now i have them\nand i will not sell them by the way you\n[ __ ] they're mine\nyeah so i once again i'm noticing a\nslight tension in terms of like the way\nthat your mind\nmeasures you against others right that\nthat doing something\nindulgence towards yourself and i'm not\nsaying it's big or bad or like this is a\nsmoking gun or anything but i think\nthe interesting thing is as we develop\nas human beings\nthe problems with our mind become more\nand more sudden\nthey become smaller and and there's\nstill sort of this tension where if i\nget something someone else\ndoesn't it's a tiny tiny one tiny tiny\nnone\none and and you know small one\nnano nano babu means nano means small\nbabu means baby and it's something that\nmy kids say from time to time\na tiny tiny baby so my younger kid talks\nabout\ntiny tiny baby canora viruses which is\nwhy we can't go to the playground\noh that's a good way of putting it yeah\num but you know i i'd encourage you\ncharlie to just keep\ntrack of that and just notice you know\nthat\nin your mind for some reason when you\nbuy something your mind\nhas a script that turns on which starts\nthinking about\nhow someone else could be deprived by\nwhat you've done\nwhereas i doubt i mean when you say\nyou've you know bought out a significant\nshare of the supply of yugioh boxes i\ndoubt that well at least on one website\ni can tell you you could probably find\nlike a measurable\ngraph somewhere that shows before i\nstarted streaming it and then after for\nrise of the duelist\nokay i think in total we've had like\n[ __ ] 60 boxes worth of that that\nwe've opened on stream\ni wouldn't be surprised if konami just\nstops giving it to vendors and starts\nsending it right to me or something\nto make more money that way um\ndo you see what i'm saying though about\njust sort of the automaticity of your\nthought process in terms of like\ndoing something maybe indulging because\nyou're you're not\nyou know that's a sort of a situation\nwhere there's one toy there's two toys\nthere's no toys and then you're like\ngoing into toys r us and\nyou have the perception that you're kind\nof buying out like an entire shelf of\nsomething\nand then your mind sort of thing starts\nthinking about other people because you\ndo seem like you care about other people\nand and there's just this little script\ni'd encourage you to just keep an eye on\nthat\num there may be something more to that\ncan i tell you\ni'll go into a little bit more detail\napologies if i'm kind of losing you am i\nlosing you\nno absolutely not man absolutely so wild\nso\nthe the other just thought that i have\nis that i think\nteaching indulgence to your kids is also\npretty important i don't know if you're\nthinking about having kids you're\nplanning on having kids or want kids or\nwhatever\nbut you know i think teaching temperance\nand restriction to your kids is\nimportant but also\nthat sometimes they do get to come first\nis like something that\ni try to teach my kids is that sometimes\nthey get to come first and i'm wondering\nyou know i think part of what how can i\nsay this\ni think you deserve more than you give\nyourself charlie\nhmm that's sweet i think\nyeah i mean i from everything i said i\ntotally get where you'd come from here\nbut\ni don't think that i deprive myself of\nanything for the sake of\ngiving someone else anything i still\nthink you know if there is something\nthat i want and it is something just for\nme i don't really like hesitate to get\nit i don't think there's really been too\nmany cases of where like\nyou know i felt so guilty for giving\nmyself something that someone else might\nnot have it\ni don't think i've really suffered too\nmuch from that and even as a kid it's\nnot like i felt that way either\nbut from everything i've said i could\ntotally get why maybe you'd feel that\nway i just don't\nsee it personally yeah maybe i'm a\nlittle biased in it maybe my girlfriend\nwould feel differently where she's like\ncharlie you know you never really\ndo this for yourself but for me i just\ndon't get that feeling\nyeah so charlie i'm not so let me be a\nlittle bit even clearer so what i'm\ntalking about is that i think you give\nyourself 99\nof what you deserve what i'm talking\nabout is a one percent here\nand the reason that i think that's\nimportant has nothing to do with like\nyou depriving yourself\nit actually has to do it i realize i'm\nsort of stepping outside of my bounds\nhere but\ni think it actually has to do with your\nspiritual growth\nso i i think that being able to\nacknowledge and give yourself like\nto be free from those thoughts those\nautomatic thoughts that you're depriving\nsomeone\ni think is actually like a step forward\nfor you\nand that doesn't have to do with\nactually buying more yu-gi-oh cards or\nbuying less yu-gi-oh cards\ni'm not actually talking i'm not saying\nthat you should\ngive yourself more than you do what i'm\ntalking about is your sense of deserving\nright that you should be comfortable and\nacknowledge that\nit's okay for you to indulge in that\nother people aren't\nthat's what i'm talking about something\nthat's very very subtle i don't think\nit's like an issue\ni don't think it impairs your function i\ndon't think it's a problem\ndoes that make sense it's just the\nbarrier of where you are\nbased on our conversation no i totally\nget where you're coming from yeah that\nmakes sense\num yeah what do you how are we doing is\nthis conversation okay to you\nyeah absolutely man i always enjoy these\nthings like i said i watch your show i\nalways like to hear these conversations\nso to take part in one i mean i think\nthat's great\nyeah uh i find myself being curious\nabout your girlfriend but also like\nhave a bunch of questions about um\ni don't know how comfortable\nbut then they're also kind of questions\nabout like community and\nand thinking about like different kinds\nof community\num thinking about like hate and toxicity\num what do you think would be a better\nuse of our time\nreally i'm um this is your ship you're\none i'm willing to go wherever you want\nto steer us i'm fine to talk about\nany of that if you want to talk about\nthe toxic communities or something i\nmean that's been pretty prevalent these\ndays so\ni'm fine with whatever okay i mean\nuh i need some kind of direction\nall right then uh i think it'd be\nbeneficial if we talked about toxic\ncommunities then i think that's a\nsomething that's big right now something\nthat's been big for a little while that\nwhy not talk about it absolutely so uh\ncan you tell me a little bit about\ntoxic communities and when you say it's\nbeen big for a while what do you mean by\nthat\nokay so for uh we'll just use the the\none everyone targets and i'm no\nexception i also talk about it live\nstream fails i know a lot of people\nlike to target them for everything wrong\nwith their stream and everything wrong\nwith\nanything that when it comes to twitch in\nparticular and i've definitely made that\nmistake before too where it's like\nlivestream fails has done this this and\nthis to these people\nand i just think that's probably the\nwrong approach to take it's a\ncommunity full of a bunch of different\npeople and i don't really think it's as\ntoxic as a lot of people have made it\nout to be\nmyself included it's just there's a very\nvocal minority of people that hijack\nsomething like that it's the same thing\nwith chats like i don't think xqc's chat\nis the most\ntoxic annoying place in the world it's\njust there are some people\nthat take over and make that become the\npublic perception\nwhat would your thoughts be on that do\nyou really think that there is this\noverwhelmingly\nlarge number of people that say these\nbad things or feel this terrible way\nabout people\nor is it just a small group that make it\nseem that way\ni think both are true so let me start by\nsaying i didn't realize that live stream\nfails had a\nreputation for uh harboring toxicity i\nmean so when i browse lsf i tend to find\nit\nsomewhat enjoyable and i thought\neveryone sort of knew that the point of\nlsf is that you take things out of\ncontext\nyeah well especially with yeah\nespecially with your show that's become\nlike a real big meme there is to take\nsome clips out yeah\nso so so i mean i i actually i mean i\nthink it's\nkind of funny i don't i don't feel like\npersonally lsf or the people on lsf\nbreed negativity i try to steer clear of\nmy clips but i think it's just\nit's it's just funny right it's like\nit's clips\nfirst of all so you're not getting\nreally a fair representation it's like\nit's like a meme generator\nand meme generators i don't think are\ngoing to be able to capture the truth\num i do know that lsf has been i think a\nlot more mindful recently that\ndespite you know when you generate memes\nsometimes you can go a little bit too\nfar\nand that and and so it seems to me like\nthe the community has been like the lsf\nmodding community\num you know i think has been making a\nlot of active changes which sound\nawesome to me in terms of\nuh i don't know like all the details but\ni i think they're becoming more mindful\nof what they create and what kind of\neffects that they have and they've been\nthinking about it more which seems to be\nlike a step in the right direction\num so that's what i'd say about lsf but\ni'm relatively new to twitch and also\nrelatively new to lsf so i don't know if\nthey've been worse in the past or\nyou know what's been going on yeah i\nthink the reputation\ni'm not like a frequent browser i'm only\nan occasional one i don't know what new\nmodding things are implemented but i\nthink the reason why lsf gets that\nreputation is because for a long time i\ndon't know if this is still the case but\nthe most popular posts were like\nhere's salinity being [ __ ] terrible\nand then here's a clip of valenti from a\nyear ago still being terrible and you'll\nhave all these like old clips piled on\ntop of\none another targeting one person in\nparticular showing their worst moments\nand then everyone in the comments is dog\npiling it\nand then maybe like five months down the\nline the perception changes and then\neveryone acts like\nwell this is terrible you know no one\nshould have ever said these things we\nnever did this\nand then i wish people would stop\ngeneralizing lsf based on its top posts\nand stuff like that so they get this\nreputation for\nbeing toxic and then pretending they\nweren't\nand then they use that same line where\nit's like it's a 900 000 person\ncommunity\nyou can't target us based on a couple\npeople even though it's their top post\nwhich means it's most representative of\nwhat people wanted\nwhat people were vibing with so i do\nthink that that\nuh so going to like you know the vocal\nminority i think that\nit's very common that a community can be\ninfluenced by a vocal minority like in\nchat you'll get a couple of real trolls\nwho\nyou know speak more so i think that\ngenerally speaking majorities tend to be\nsilent\num and that minorities can oftentimes be\nvocal\nand so that is true but i i do think\njust like you said though charlie like i\nthink that\nwe can't hide behind that anymore\nbecause of things like when you upvote\nright like when when a when a post makes\nit to the top of live stream fails\nthat's not a vocal minority that's the\nsilent majority that is the action of\nthe silent majority\nand so when that gets upvoted that\nactually is representative of your\ncommunity\num and i i think especially with some of\nthese other you know\ntoxic communities which i've recently\nlearned about right so they're like i\nrecently discovered that they're like\num just kind of a funny meme story about\nthis but like someone mentioned keemstar\nand i didn't know that that was a person\nwhen i first heard it\nlike i thought because you know it's\nlike a term right so like like if you\nsay sky nut for example like i'm\nassuming that that's just something that\nsomeone made up\nright like it's not like a per because\nlike you just can't [ __ ] tell\nlike is moist critical a person or like\nit's just confusing\nanyway so i think that there are like\ncommunities right where\nwhere people create content that is\ngeared towards attacking other people\nand to be fair those communities are\ngigantic\nand they get tons of viewership which\nsays to me that this is not an\nissue of a vocal minority that there is\nactually a silent majority of people\nthere\nand oddly enough you know i know this is\ngoing to sound weird i think we have to\nbe careful about judging them because i\nstill don't know\nwhy these people upvote what they do\nso so there's just sort of this sense\nthat we call all of these people toxic\nand i'm sure that that's fair but you\nknow i tend to\ndo my best to not\njudge an entire person based on a\nparticular action\nso i'm sure there are toxic people out\nthere but if you have\nyou know like a like an attack video\nyoutube or whatever that has like five\nmillion subscribers like that's not\na vocal minority right that that\nperson's channel is successful because\nthere's actually a lot of people out\nthere who are experiencing\na lot of something and i personally am\ncurious like\nwhat they're experiencing like i don't\nknow why these people\nupvote this stuff\nyeah i guess to bring it back into terms\nwith livestream fails i\ni guess it would more be the sense of\ncommunity right that would be my take\nwhere everyone's mad at this person so\nmaybe somebody feels like well if\nthey're mad\nthere's a reason for it i should be mad\neven if maybe they don't feel that\nstrongly they'll still chime and be like\nyo\ni don't like this yuck what the [ __ ] is\nthat oh jesus upvote you know\ni don't really think it's a whole bunch\nof people that genuinely hate the person\nor anything\nlike that they probably don't even know\nwho it is they just see that this is\npopular\ni'm in this community pretty often which\nmeans i should feel the same way so i'm\ngoing to\nyou know take on the same mindset you\nknow what i mean i don't think it's\nnecessarily always malicious where this\nperson is trying to you know\nruin the person that's being targeted\nthey just feel like they're missing out\nby not\nbeing in the same line as everyone else\nin the community that they frequent\ni've i'm quite skeptical of that so let\nme ask you this charlie when you upvote\nsomething on reddit\nwhat's in your mind when you upvote it\nwell this is you're not going to believe\nthis but i've never\nupvoted anything on reddit in my life\nokay so\nthat actually makes a lot of sense to me\nbecause i i think that your hypothesis\nabout what is in someone's mind\ni wouldn't agree with that they're doing\nit just because other people are doing\nit\nyeah that's totally fair maybe i'm just\nout right wrong because i don't know\nlike maybe they are really feeling this\nyeah so so as someone who upvotes a lot\non reddit and comments\nrarely i upvote things that resonate\nwith me in some way\nthat i agree with and i downvote things\nthat i don't agree with\nand don't resonate with the exception\nbeing\ni can resonate with something that i\ndisagree with if the guise\nof the\ngiven the premise of the post so for\nexample sometimes there are posts that\nare\ncriticizing me that'll actually upvote\nbecause i think they bring up good\ncriticisms\nso i can disagree with what they're\nsaying but i i resonate with the post in\nsome way and i think generally speaking\nwhen you think about upvote and downvote\ni never think about oh my god a bunch of\npeople are upvoting this\ni better upvote it too i've never\nexperienced that now that could be\nhappening subconsciously\nbut usually i tend to upvote things that\ni find\nlike resonate with me in some way if i\nfind it funny i'm gonna upvote it i\ndon't care that other people find it\nfunny\ni think it it it connects with you and\nthat's what happens with social media\nand like likes and dislikes is\nsure i'm sure there's a peer pressure\nelement to it but i think the\ninteresting thing about social media is\nthat\nthey've given us a chance like what\nrises to the top\ncertainly has issues of popularity but i\nthink that there's like some content\nthat people\nresonate with right like let's think\nabout yugioh like some there's something\nthat when people watch you open yu-gi-oh\nfacts something about them like when\nthey see your nostalgia\nwhen they see your excitement your hope\nit resonates with them\nand it's like man i remember opening\nyu-gi-oh packs hell yeah i'll put this\n[ __ ]\nyou know like let's see if he does it\ncause i i know what\nstarlight rare starlight something\nwhat's that yeah\nwhat's it called starlight starlight\nrare starlight rare\nso like a starlight like they remember\nhunting for the starlight rare\nand so it connects with them and i i\nthink the internet is\nis about actually i know this sounds\nbizarre but i think it's actually about\nconnection i think what social media\ntwitch\ni mean twitch is about connection it's\nabout connecting with the person that\nyou're watching the person that you're\nwatching resonating with you\nif we think about our stream that's also\nabout connection\nso we've grown because the people who\ncome on here say and do things that\npeople\nfeel connected to\nyeah i can totally agree with that so i\nguess mainly the reason why i was\nfeeling that way when it comes to\nsomething like lsf and things rising to\nthe top and maybe not being\nyou know maliciously upvoting something\nbad is because you can see it a lot in a\nchat right where if somebody posts\nsome kind of copy pasta or you know some\nassy art picture of titties or the hydra\ndick\nyou'll immediately see you haven't seen\nthe\nwell i don't even want to attempt it\nbecause i hate that kind of [ __ ] i don't\nlike spam but\nwhen somebody does like a copy pasta or\na hydro dick or three titty\nspam thing you'll see 50 people\nimmediately\nstart posting the same thing so i would\ni would imagine that that extends to\nother platforms so when you see\nsomething on reddit where it rises\npretty quickly\nyou'll typically would at least in my\nperspective you'd see other people just\nhop on it like well they're doing it i'm\ngoing to do it i'll upload this as well\nand i don't necessarily care too much\nabout what this person did\nbut everyone else is doing it so i'm\nprobably just gonna upload it too\nyeah so i think there's certainly a mob\nmentality\nyeah but but i don't think the mob\nmentality is the same as peer pressure i\nthink it's like more\ninstinctual right so like reddit becomes\nlike a school of fish\nthat certainly like one fish freaks out\nand goes this way and then they're like\none bird\nyou know if you see a bunch of birds\nroosting and then one bird jumps out and\nstarts flying all the other birds jump\nout and start flying\nso certainly is i think a group think\naspect to it but i i think by the way is\nit a\nhydro dick or hydra dick hydra\nand i want to apologize to your mods i\njust made their job so much [ __ ]\nharder by even mentioning that sorry\nhydra dick yeah like oh like the greek\nmonster yeah it's like just a bunch of\nbunch of dicks\nyeah okay i mean\nthey're dicks in all shapes and sizes on\nthe internet\nyou'd be surprised um anyway\nyeah so so i i do think though that\nthat i'm not so sure that it's a vocal\nminority\ncharlie because i think that you know\nyou do have entire communities that are\nvery successful\nthat are built on attacking other people\nwhat do you think about that you i mean\nthat definitely exists i mean\nyeah if you can see that especially\nthere's entire channels based around it\non youtube i mean\nfor better for worse sometimes it's\nlegitimate criticism or sometimes it's\npointing out something someone did to\nmake jokes about it and just have fun\nabout it i think there's definitely\ndifferent\nlevels of it different tiers where\nthere's someone that's hateful\nabout it like they hate this person and\nthey're just gonna keep\ninsulting them maybe there's nothing\nconstructive and maybe there's nothing\nentertaining about it\nand i think that's the worst level where\nit's there for hate to fuel this hate\nmachine where\ni think in today's landscape of social\nmedia people like to be angry more than\nthey like to be happy\ni think in general scheme of things\npeople like to feel like there's a\ncommon enemy that they can all unite\nagainst and hate against\nand channels that simply aim to fuel\nthat to give them someone to hate\nwithout anything constructive or\nentertaining\ni think that's probably the worst level\nof it i don't necessarily feel that\nabout live stream fails in particular i\nfeel that's more\nhere's just some drama we can all rally\nbehind and maybe just mindlessly upvote\nbut i definitely think on other\nplatforms and on youtube there's\ndefinitely channels that do that but\non twitch i don't see too much of just\nhate for the sake of hate i\ni feel it's more just here's drama let's\njust treat it like a you know\nreality tv show okay so can you tell me\na little bit about like how\nyoutube and twitch and their communities\nand the level of toxicity is different\nyeah so i i actually think leafy made a\ngood point with this\nwhen before he got banned the on twitch\neveryone's really kind of looking out\nfor each streamer\nyou know if a streamer is being attacked\nnine times out of ten you'll see other\nstreamers come to their aid\non youtube if someone's being attacked\nit's the trendy thing to immediately hop\non and attack that person as well\ni mean you saw it with james charles you\nsaw it with pretty much everyone and i'm\nguilty with the james charles thing in\nparticular\nbut in youtube it's people eating each\nother right\nand i'm not saying guilty with the james\ncharles thing like i did anything bad i\njust meant like\ni talked about it but on youtube when\nsomeone's james charles\nhe's a big makeup youtuber he had like a\nbig scandal and stuff\nand everyone was talking about it but it\nturned out it's all just a bunch of\n[ __ ] but\non youtube it's it's best for a lot of\nthese channels to immediately hop\non when someone's getting attacked when\nthey're vulnerable because that's where\nall the views are for those people\nlike you saw it with pokeman every\nyoutuber was making five videos about\npokeman because leafy made a video about\npokemane\nthat's how it's treated there that's the\nnormal culture of youtube\non twitch if that happens from what i've\nseen for my two years on here\nwhen someone's getting attacked like\nthat other streamers aren't super quick\nto immediately start attacking that\nperson\nthey'll typically wait a lot of times\nthey'll defend the streamer\nit's it's a very different perspective a\nvery different approach\nwhen someone's getting attacked on the\nplatforms youtube it'll be like a dog\npile like everyone's trying to\ndesperately recover\nrecover a fumble in football but on\ntwitch it's people feel more connected\nas like a community\nthat's the biggest difference has that\naffected you how long have you been on\nyoutube\n14 years okay so like like have you\nhave have the platform sort of affected\nyou differently\nno i wouldn't say so i not not me\npersonally but just i can definitely see\nthe differences\nit's not something that i've been uh\nvictim to or something that i've really\nbeen like in the [ __ ] mix of or\nanything but it's something since i've\nbeen on both\never since i've been on that for so long\nand then coming over here i can\nimmediately recognize\nthe big difference between the two when\nit comes to that\nand and do you have to deal with like\nhate\noh i mean everyone does right i mean\nthat's that comes with putting yourself\nout there everyone has to deal with some\nlevel people not liking you or lying\nabout you or something like that\nthat unfortunately does come with the\nterritory and it's something that i've\naccepted a long time ago\nso it's not something that bothers me\nit's not anything that i you know\nhow do you how do you let it not bother\nyou how do you do that\ni think that's people yeah it's gonna be\ndifferent for everyone uh\nit's just a matter of just being there\nfor so long i think at the end of the\nday\nit's important to recognize that when\nsomebody's saying these things\nyou know it's not the worst thing in the\nworld it's somebody you don't know it's\na stranger you don't know their\nsituation\nit's just you know it is what it is they\nfelt this strongly and there's nothing\nyou can do to change their mind\nat the end of the day it's out of your\nhands and what makes me\nfeel better about it is like you know\nwhat i don't know that person\nthey don't really know me they didn't\nlike this about me and that's fine\ni just let sleeping dogs lie in chat if\nsomeone's talking some [ __ ] i'll\nobviously joke around and start talking\n[ __ ] back at them that's totally\ndifferent\nthat's just more banter between two\npeople or sometimes it gets a little\nmore hostile just\nbut that's just for the sake of having a\nlittle fun conversation or a little\ndebate\nbut when it comes to like actually\ngetting under my skin it doesn't really\nanymore\nand for people that are new to the\ninternet i can absolutely see it really\ngetting them\nbecause it gets vicious especially with\nthe way twitter is right now\nit's like they need everyone to be this\nperfect robot\nand i think the sooner you accept that\nyou know\nyou're never going to be perfect not\neveryone's going to like you the better\noff you're going to be\nand getting thicker skin when it comes\nto people that are either just being\nmean for the sake of being mean or just\nlying for the sake of lying for drama\nit's just a matter of being there going\nthrough it and recognizing that it's not\nthe worst thing in the world\nwhen we say where the way twitter is\nnowadays what do you mean by that\nwell you'll see it all the time i don't\nknow how often you engage with that\nplatform the less the better so if\nyou're not on there often\nbig congratulations that [ __ ] is [ __ ]\nmiserable figure it out\nyeah it's terrible like when i say with\nthe way twitter is\nif a youtuber so much is like had a wet\nfart on a camera\n11 years ago it's gonna get dug up and\nit's going to be a controversy\nif you've made an edgy tweet at any\npoint over the last decade it's going to\nbe found\nand you're going to get [ __ ] for it and\nthat's\njust kind of the way it is because like\ni said i think people really just want\nto find\nthings to be mad about when it comes to\ninternet people or just in general\nso the easiest target is content\ncreators because everything they do is\npublic\npeople will constantly tweet everything\nthey're feeling\nshow everything that they're feeling\npost everything\nso they can easily find something that\ngets upset about\nand at some point you have to accept\nlook someone's gonna be mad about\nsomething i've done\nand i can't change that i i know what\nkind of person i am\nit's not what they're saying it is it's\nreally just not\nanything to this level and i just need\nto be okay with that going forward\nat least that's kind of the mentality\ni've adopted i i don't view it as the\nworst thing there is when it's\none or two people on twitter that are\nlike charlie made this tweet 11 years\nago where he said\n[ __ ] i don't even know i don't tweet\nthat much but he said the chupacabra is\nreal because it [ __ ] his grandfather\nbut\ncharlie's grandfather has been dead for\nfour years he lied to us the chupacabra\ndidn't have sex with his grandfather\nyou know i'm not gonna be like wow [ __ ]\nnow they're mad at me for lying i'm not\na liar\nyou know yeah\nbad example but you get what i'm saying\ni couldn't think of any\nyeah no i think chupacabra necrophilia\nis a great example of something to dig\nup\nwell to be fair i did lie about that\ni'll set the record straight the\nchupacabra is most likely still a lie he\nnever had sex with my grandfather\ni'll just say it now so charlie like\nwhat do we do about this\nthat's a great [ __ ] question man\nbecause it's it's like just the general\nmindset right you can't change\nwhat people want you can't change what\npeople have fun engaging with right\npeople love to be mad and they love to\nhave someone to be mad at\nso what like how do you really fix that\nyou you can't\nit's what people have decided they\npersonally like\nand i don't really know what you do\nabout it maybe you have a better\nsuggestion but for me\ni just don't really know what you'd do\nfor it\nyeah so i i i don't know i i think\nthere's a lot we can do\nto be honest um i i think uh\nand and this could probably i mean this\nactually probably due to my\nrelative naivete it's actually one of my\narguably strengths and weaknesses\num i remember when i was in training\nsort of\nhaving a couple of patients that were\nsort of like lost causes\nkind of thing and i i sort of take on\nlost causes\num because i'm in a sense arguably just\ntoo stupid to realize that if a dozen\npeople have worked with this person\nbefore and they haven't made any\nprogress\ni i don't know why i think i would be\ndifferent i don't think it's really\narrogant but i tend to take on\nchallenges that many of my colleagues\nsometimes\nwouldn't or you know would kind of say\nlike hey you're not going to get\nanywhere with this person people have\ntried\num and so the first thing is that there\ncould be like sort of a bias there where\nyou know you kind of say how do you\nchange someone's\nnatural predisposition to want to hate\nmore than be happy\nfeels like an unsolvable problem right\nyeah absolutely and and so but but in my\nexperience\noftentimes the things that keep us stuck\nin life are the things that keep us\nfrom moving forward is because our\ndiagnosis makes it unsolvable\nso the first issue is like if you change\nthe diagnosis\nyou may have a treatment sometimes the\nreason that actually in fact\nif you look at in medicine you know why\ndon't treatments work\nthe most common reason that a treatment\ndoesn't work is because the diagnosis is\nwrong\nit's like a no-brainer if someone comes\nin and\num you know gets diagnosed with\ndepression\nand it turns out that they like their\nthe reason they have trouble getting out\nof bed all the time\nis because they have cancer\nlike that's like it's like night and day\ncan look like something like it's\nyou can ask someone hey do you have\ntrouble getting out of bed do you feel\nlike doing anything\ndo you you've lost weight um you know\nyou don't enjoy the things that you\nusually used to enjoy\nyou feel guilty because you're not able\nto work and you're not able to like\nbe there for your kids like you can\ncheck all the boxes for depression the\nactual diagnosis is cancer\nthen you'd start that person on an\nantidepressant medication and then like\nthe antidepressant medication doesn't\nwork then they go see another\npsychiatrist they go see another\npsychiatrist\nand at the end of the day like the\nproblem as you framed it\nis the problem itself so if your\nquestion is how do you get people to\nstop\npreferring hate over happiness that's\ntough to answer but even then have we\nreally tried\nright which is kind of interesting have\nyou tried to take a single person and\ntry to understand\nyou know why do you hate instead of\nbeing happy\nwhen people post yeah you want to say\nsomething\ni was gonna say yeah that's a really\ninteresting perspective like maybe\nbecause there is people that'll just\nwatch someone to hate\nwatch them right like i know it's become\nkind of a meme because train will be\nlike you know all these hate watchers\ndude and [ __ ] like that\nbut you have there are people that do\nthat right a hundred percent\nso i guess understanding what the\npurpose is and what they get out of that\nwould be kind of interesting to hear\nyeah i've ever tried or i know anyone\nthat has so so i think one of the\nfailures we've made as a community is\nwhat we do is we call those people toxic\nand for understandable reasons we just\nban them\nbut what we're actually doing is like\njudging an\nentire world of people as toxic without\never trying to understand like where\ndoes this come from\nand and recently you know it's kind of\ninteresting so\nthis may be a little bit of a hot button\ntopic but\nwith a lot of the me too stuff that's\ncome out we've really tried very hard to\nsupport people who are victims of\nof inappropriate behavior or sexual\nassault\nor things like that but there's a\nthere's a part of me\nthat actually like wonders sometimes\nlike\ni you know i've worked in a prison and\nstuff before and and so i remember when\ni was working in a prison sort of asking\nmyself the question\nwhen did this person become a predator\nand when did this person become a\ncriminal\nand what i find myself thinking is that\nfor some people honestly like they're\nstraight up like sociopaths\nand they were sort of like born that way\nand they had like behaviors at the age\nof seven or eight that were\nwas like very very problematic but i\nfound that for most people you know i\nhave trouble accepting that like a nine\nyear old kid or 11 year old kid\nor 13 year old kid as a predator and\nthen something happens in our community\nright they grow up in a particular way\nlike\nin some point they become insults and\nthen they become predators or whatever\nbut there's still like i i don't i\nhaven't given up on altering the course\nof those people because i've i've worked\nwith people whose courses have been\naltered like i\nwork with some pro gamers and it's been\ninteresting to talk to them about when\nthey were 15 and they were like big\nright like so some of these pro gamers\nget really good at a really young age\nand like\nhow other people in the scene went out\nof their way to like teach them that\nsome of the things that they were doing\nor saying were like not okay\nand you know there were like 15 year\nolds that were you know saying really\ninappropriate racial slurs and like\nhomophobic slurs or whatever like in\nchat because\nthat's what you do and then i remember\ntalking to one of these guys and he was\nsaying that yeah like someone sat me\ndown\nand said like hey you can't be doing\nthat anymore and his initial response is\nwhy it's just\nwords and i get the sense that there's\nlike there's a lack of\nunderstanding and then there's like a\nlack of trying to explain to people\nthat this is a problem and when we label\nsomething as toxic\ni mean it makes sense in terms of like\nbanning people because like you said\nthere's sort of a contagion effect\nof memeing and toxicity right it's like\nit's contagious\nso you gotta ban the people from the\nchat but at the same time i think part\nof the reason that we haven't been able\nto figure out a solution is because\nwe've never tried to we've never\ndiagnosed anything it's like\nthat person is sick let's like shove\nthem off to the side and keep them in a\nhut\nand never use a stethoscope never listen\nto their lungs\nnever look at their eyes look in their\nmouth let's not try to diagnose anything\nso my sense is that you know we still\nhave i mean there's some actually like\nbig things in theory i don't know how we\ngo about doing that\nbut sort of exploring toxicity i also\nthink that\nwhat we've also seen on twitch i think\nthis is a good example is that\nthere are toxic communities and they're\nalso wholesome communities\nand that there are people who actually\nare members of both\nso we see that a lot on our discord\nwhere like we ban people from our\ndiscord for being toxic\nand then we actually recently did\nsomething where we like\ngot them on stream and we tried to get\ntheir perspective like what's your\nunderstanding of why you were banned\nwhat did you do why did you do it and\nit's really cool because when you take\nthese people that have been banned and\nare viewed as quote unquote toxic\nthat once again twitch chat loves to\nhate hate on\nwhen you expose their human side i think\nfive out of the six people on our band\nappeal stream\nwe just we actually left it up to twitch\nand we said chat you guys decide\nwhether we unban them or not and five\nfive out of six\nuh five out of six of the people\ngot forgiveness and we're allowed back\non the server gotta be\nit's gotta be [ __ ] terrible being\nthat one guy that didn't yeah x-man\nfour-man\nyeah i know so i i feel for that dude\nright so i i think though\nat the same time like you know five out\nof six like i was expecting because you\nknow twitch loves i mean this is our\nperception so i was about to say\nsomething which i think\nis a false statement i was about to say\ntwitch loves pitchforks\nyoutube loves pitchforks we love\npitchforks lsf loves pitchforks\nbut i think that statement in and of\nitself is like\nnot expecting more\nand i think one of the biggest things\nthat i've seen is when you expect very\nlittle from another human being\nyour expectations are met\nand when you expect a lot surprisingly\nyour expectations can often be met\nand so i choose to have a little bit\nmore faith in humanity and\nand not to say that you don't have faith\nin human i think you have a lot of faith\nin humanity\num but i i'm not willing to kind of give\nup and i don't think we should because i\ndon't think we've really like really\nhonestly tried like i don't know\ni mean we have tried a lot of people\nhave tried you know the\nthe the victims of the hate have tried\nto speak against it in some way\nand generally speaking it doesn't work\nbut i i think we got to figure out\nyou know some for some of these people\nlike who do you think or\nreprese and i i don't mean to be putting\na target on your back so don't answer\nthis question if you feel like it is\nputting a target on your back but who do\nyou think has like toxic communities\nlike\nwho should we be talking to who should\nwe try to understand presuming that\nthey're worth understanding\nthat's a tough question to answer i\ncan't really off the top of my head\nthink of like\na toxic community but i can think of a\nreally good community that i think most\npeople would agree we\nwould agree with me on which is moon\nmoon's community\nmoon moon has a really really good\ncommunity like i think most people could\nprobably agree with that\nwhen it comes to a toxic one i can't\nreally think of like\na toxic community on twitch i mean if\nyou want to like broaden the definition\nsomeone in the chat mentions the smash\ncommunity and that's\nfair you know with everything that's\ngone on there a lot of terrible stuff\nbut i don't think as a whole everyone\nthat plays smash is a toxic\npredator [ __ ] or anything you know\nwhat i mean so for me it's hard to like\npinpoint a\ntoxic community one that exists just to\ninsult everyone else and [ __ ] on\neveryone else's fun or anything\nwhat about youtube\num that's a little tougher to answer\nbecause there's just is\nso many communities out there but if you\ndon't mind real quick do you mind if i\nrun to the bathroom then\nno no okay i'll be right back\nwalls so that's how we that's how we\npropagate some of this\nthis hydratic toxicity right so as when\ni call it out\nit increases it no but seriously like\nwhat do you guys think i mean do you\nthink it's okay to call out a community\nfor being toxic or\nnaming them that way so\nhow do you guys think that the how do\nyou think that the members of those\ncommunities perceive themselves\ni mean so people are talking about yeah\ndo it to them let them defend themselves\ni i don't think that's the right\napproach right so i think that's what\ncreates this problem is that\nit's an issue of like attack and defense\nas opposed to like understanding and and\nlike you know trying to foster some\namount of cooperation\nall right i'm back in it yeah so uh\ncharlie i i was asking chat in the\nmeantime like what do you think the\npeople who are\nmembers of what we describe as toxic\ncommunities quote unquote\nwhat do you think they feel do they view\nthemselves as toxic or how do they view\nthemselves\nokay i think that's a good question so\nin my perspective i think\na hundred percent well okay i can't say\n100 but i think an overwhelmingly major\nmajority would probably say that yeah\ni'm being toxic i don't think anyone has\nthis delusion where it's like\nno no this isn't toxic this is actually\nconstructive i actually think a lot of\npeople embrace it\ni think that's gonna become a trendy\nthing to do for some people be like oh\ni'm an [ __ ] but\nit's just who i am you know you'll see\nthat in a twitter bio just an [ __ ]\nyou know\nthat for some reason that's become\nnormalized to just kind of be\nan [ __ ] yep so i don't think anyone's\ngonna try and hide that\nbut yeah so i it's interesting so i saw\na lot of people say like righteous\nwhat do you think about that oh there's\na hundred oh man you'll see that all\nover reddit there's some people that are\nlike\ni am the hero i am the protagonist of\nthis anime i'm fighting this evil\nstreamer\nor this evil twitter post look at me uh\nplease\nsend me your thank yous and the dms and\nstuff a hundred percent\nthere are people that have this delusion\nbut i don't think the majority would\ni think most people recognize yeah i\njust don't like i just don't like this\nperson i'm being [ __ ] about it\ni don't think there's so many people out\nthere believing that there's some\nmedieval hero riding in on horseback to\nsave everyone from this evil post\ninteresting okay i i would have had it\nas\nflipped really yeah so i think most\nhuman beings tend to do things that\nthat what i would call or ego syntonic\nso ego syntonic versus ego dystonic\nmeans\naligned with who you think you are\nversus\nnot aligned with who you think you are\nso a good example of this in psychiatry\nis like a lot of people talk about\npeople who are quote-unquote ocd\nthat's not ocd so there are two things\none is\nocd which is obsessive compulsive\ndisorder another thing is\nobsessive-compulsive personality\ndisorder or ocpd\npeople who are ocpd are control freaks\nthey really get they love to be in\ncontrol they love to like organize\nthings they get bent out of shape\nwhen things don't go their way but\nthat's a very ego syntonic thing they\ndon't think that they're wrong\nthey don't view themselves as control\nfreaks they think that everyone else\nis like should like you should put the\ndishes where they go\nnot over here they go over there so\nthat's very ego-syntonic it's aligned\nwith their identity as a person the\ninteresting thing is people with true\nocd\nit's very egotistic they know that it's\nridiculous that they have to turn on the\nlight\nseven switch the light switch seven\ntimes every time they walk into the room\nthey know it's idiotic they know there's\nno reason to do it\nand yet they can't help themselves it\nactually causes them to stress\nbut they have to engage in the\ncompulsions or the obsessions anyway\nso in one hand like ocd is actually very\nego dystonic where people don't like\nthat they have to do these things\nand ocpd or like what we think of as\nyeah i'm super ocd that's just who i am\nthat's very ego syntonic right so i'm\njust an [ __ ] that's who i am is a\nvery ego syntonic way of thinking it's\nlike\nit actually causes that person no\ndistress that they're an [ __ ]\nso my sense is that generally speaking\npeople don't behave in a way that is\nfirst of all ego-dystonic so they\nbelieve in a way that feels aligned with\nwho they are as a person\nand that righteousness is very ghost and\ntonic\nand i think is very very common um\nespecially on the internet where you\nhave people like putting other people in\ntheir place\nyeah maybe just maybe my perspective is\na little distorted because of twitter in\nparticular because on there it is so\ncommon for people\nfor people to just outright be like yup\ni'm an [ __ ]\ni made this account just to be an\n[ __ ] and\ni'm just just going to keep you know\ndoing these things you know being an\n[ __ ]\nso maybe it's not as common as i think\nit is maybe it's just a confirmation\nbias where i'm just seeing it more often\nbecause of that\nso maybe you're absolutely right i have\nno idea well interestingly enough what\nyou said actually makes me\nmore inclined to take your viewpoint not\nless because what you're saying is if\nit's based on twitter\nthat sounds to me like you actually you\nhave real data whereas i have hypotheses\nwell i mean it's all anecdotal right\nlike i don't have actual data it's just\nwhat i see when i go on twitter and i\nsee these people\nlike when you see something bad happen\nyou'll have a bunch of people making all\nthese edgy remarks or making all these\nlike terrible things they say about the\nperson\nand then you go on their their profile\nand that's all they do that's their\nentire online identity and they embrace\nit\nthey wear it like a badge of honor like\na little boy scout badge or something so\ni just see it a lot on there and i think\nmaybe that's just kind of\ndistorted the way i view how common it\nis\nyeah so the interesting thing is i\nwonder if i talk to one of those people\nwho describe themselves as an [ __ ]\ni don't think they feel like an [ __ ]\ni think they feel righteous\nand they recognize disagree okay yeah i\nreally feel like\nif let's say you brought someone on your\nshow that you know recently made some\nkind of terrible remark about chadwick\nboseman or something\ni think if you brought them on their\nshow on your show they would still keep\nthis persona up maybe they might not\nactually be a genuine degenerate [ __ ]\nbut i feel like\ngiven any internet attention or any\nanonymity they're going to continue to\nbe that way\ni don't think they try and hide it i\nthink they'd embrace it they'd feel like\nthe joker from the batman series i\ncompletely agree with you but now let's\nlet's so i\nagree with you i think they'd maintain\nthe persona but the persona that you\nmaintain in the feelings that you have\nare oftentimes in fact usually\nin harsh conflict a persona\neven if we think about the word persona\na persona\nis a false self that we think about just\nthe definition\nright it's a false self\nso if a persona is a false self and\nyou're saying\nthis person would maintain the persona\nthat implies that what they are on the\ninside\nis not what they're portraying ergo\nthey would not actually feel like\n[ __ ] the [ __ ] is the front\nthat they put on because there's\nsomething else underneath\nyeah and that's entirely possible a\nhundred percent it's just hard to know\nif it even is a persona right like i say\nthat\nhaving the belief that maybe they're not\nthis piece of [ __ ]\nbut maybe they just are maybe yes\ni mean i i think i i tend to be curious\ni think we've had actually a lot of\nreally interesting\num explorations with people that i think\nare generally viewed as toxic\nso we had a couple of interesting\nstreams with women like female gamers\nand then also like women who get hit on\nby men online\num and the really interesting thing at\nthe end of both of those streams is the\nwomen were like yeah we'd love to see\nyou do this with a group of\nthe people on the other side of the\ntable like\nfind a group of toxic male gamers and\njust ask them like why are you guys\ntoxic in games or people who\nyou know will send like inappropriate\nmessages to women online\nor i mean a lot of times what they were\ncomplaining about is not even like\ninappropriate messages it's sort of like\npersistence and kind of like\nguilt-tripping and [ __ ] like that that\nthat people do\nthey're like oh you're not yeah yeah\nthat's become super common right like\nyou see that on twitch all the time like\ni've been subbed for this long and you\ndon't even remember my name\nit's like you don't care why you know\ndon't you know i'm lonely and i'm here\nfor this and that like that's something\nsuper common these days\ninteresting i'd love to know why people\ndo that because you know where do they\nget the expectation from right\nand then that makes that puts all the\nonus on the streamer to be like feeling\nbad\nfor not knowing all these things about\nthis person and i think that's a\nterrible thing as well\nit's not like your traditional toxic\nmale to female streamer thing like show\nme your tits [ __ ] you know i've been\nsubbed\nbut it's just as you know it's just as\nannoying and just as frustrating right\nto have this person that's been there\nfor so long start blaming you for not\nknowing everything about their life\nwhat's frustrating about that it\nshouldn't be a\nstreamer's responsibility to kind of be\nlike the mom and dad or the girlfriend\nto someone that's been subbed for a long\ntime\nif you know if they don't have an\ninterest in doing that at the end of the\nday\nthe streamers there to put on a show and\nbe entertaining and just be there for\nsomebody\nnot necessarily to be this pillar in\ntheir life\nand to make them feel bad for not doing\nthat i think is just as toxic\ndoes that happen to you no not really i\nmake it pretty clear with my community\nlike this kind of parasocial\nrelationship isn't a healthy thing\nso i don't really encourage it and i\nthink people understand that like i know\na lot of my chats names because i'm good\nwith names and i make an effort to at\nleast\nknow what's going on with some of the\nregulars because i treat chat like\nfriends\ni think that's you know i think that's\ngood to have a community that you can\njoke around with know a little bit about\nbut at the end of the day\ni'm not their mom i'm not their dad i'm\nnot their either babysitter or anything\ni'm just there to have some fun with\nthem talk about some [ __ ]\njoke around and i no one's ever made me\nfeel bad for not knowing certain things\nabout their life or forgetting something\nbut i know it does happen in other\nstreams you see it on twitter all the\ntime where a streamer will post\nsomething\nfrom someone that's been subbed for 21\nmonths who's now you know threatening to\nkill themselves because the streamer\nhasn't acknowledged them in the last two\nresubs or some crazy [ __ ]\nyeah i think that too is something that\nis worth understanding because i think\nwe sort of get\nyeah i i don't know exactly what to do\nabout that but i i think it's kind of\ninteresting because you sort of say you\nshow up and you treat them like friends\nand at the same time you're pretty clear\nabout the boundaries of the parasocial\nrelationship\nand i think one of the the interesting\nactually one of the advantages of twitch\ni think part of what makes twitch an\nawesome platform is that people do feel\nconnected\nyou know they yeah there's no yeah i\nwant to make it clear like there's\nnothing wrong with like connecting with\na streamer that's a lot of times how you\nfind the community\nlike i mentioned moon moon i guarantee\nmost of the people in moon moon's chat\nfeel a connection with him\nbut i don't think it's to this level\nwhere they're going to be aggressive or\nangry if moon moon doesn't acknowledge\ntheir sub or maybe forgets their name or\nsomething like that or doesn't see every\nmessage\nbut that does happen and that's an\nequally toxic thing\nwhat do we do about that oh i have no\nidea that's just such an individual\nlevel i don't know how you teach that i\nthink it's just people\nnot understanding you know social\nrelationships right\nit's people that don't have a real world\nexperience to know what's acceptable and\nwhat's not acceptable when it comes to a\nstranger and\nat the end of the day it really is still\na stranger you don't know the streamer\npersonally\nyou don't know everything about them so\nit's just someone you're familiar with\nand\nit's all about knowing when is the right\ntime to\ntry and connect if you want to and\nknowing when you probably shouldn't do\nthat\nand i think a lot of people don't have\nthat because people grow up with so much\naccess to the internet that they just\nlose that ability to find these things\nyeah i i do wonder if there's something\nso it's interesting we've done\nactually like a couple of trainings for\ncontent creators before\num where we sort of teach them actually\nhow to set boundaries because i i wonder\nif some of this stuff is actually just\nso it sounds like you set a pretty firm\nlimit with your community and your\ncommunity knows what to expect\nin terms of their you're there to hang\nout you're there to you know provide\nentertainment\nand that you're not their mom or dad\ni i i was really surprised and in some\nsense heartened to find that\na lot of streamers do actually\ngo out of their way to try to like\nsupport\nand connect with their community\nactually especially some of the smaller\nstreams\num yeah and and that\nit's interesting because i can see how\nthat could create the feelings that\nwe're talking about but also i think is\nlike not\nnot in and of itself a bad thing i think\nit's just about limit setting\nand boundaries but in and of itself is\nnot like a\nbad thing that streamers and communities\nare connected\nyeah i don't think it's like evil i\ndon't think streamers that try and form\nthis bond between community and\nthemselves or\nyou know dumb or bad people for doing\nthat it's just\nwhen that when it becomes this level of\nunhealthiness you have to understand\nsome individuals aren't going\nto understand where's too far where that\nline is\nand you'll have them having their entire\n[ __ ] week ruined\nif you miss their resub or something and\nit's not the streamer's fault right\nit's just this person doesn't really\nunderstand it\nso it's just knowing the boundaries and\nmaking it pretty clear on\nyou know the expectation i guess yeah\nhaving a hard\ntime phrasing that in a way that sounds\ncohesive no i\nthought she did great i think it's you\nknow you\nlike you said i think it's about\nexpectation you use that word several\ntimes\nand where people get that expectation\ni'm also hearing from your\nwords or sort of your statements that\nlike somewhere along the way like\ninteractions on the internet sometimes\npeople\naren't don't understand like they just\nhaven't been taught like what\nis appropriate or not appropriate which\nalso sort of makes sense because no one\nteaches you internet etiquette\nright you get taught actually like by\nyour parents and other people how to\nbehave around other human beings\nno one teaches you that on the internet\nyeah\nand if you don't have that experience\naround human beings like you're kind of\n[ __ ] right yeah you're just out here\nblind with your\nin your hand like you don't know how to\nact and i feel bad for those people you\nreally do\nand i think that kind of goes back to\nlike toxic communities because i think\nin\na lot of situations like we don't\nunderstand or maybe they don't\nunderstand\ni think it's a little bit arrogant to\nassume that these people aren't educated\nand we are more educated and more\nenlightened\num but at the same time i do wonder i\nthink a lot of this me too stuff is like\nfrankly a lot of it sounds like you know\ndudes who just don't know how to\ninteract with women\nfor the most part some of it is like\nmalicious and predatory but i think a\nlot of it it's just\nyou know like dudes just don't know how\nto act\nlike they don't know how to talk they\ndon't know how to interpret signals they\ndon't\nthey just don't know i don't know\nwhat you think about that but i what i\nonly know the smash stuff and as far as\nsmash goes like that's\nthat's more than just not knowing how to\nact that's some terrible like degenerate\n[ __ ]\nuh so i i'm not familiar with the smash\nstuff what\noh man you might want to save yourself a\nheadache like every\nbad [ __ ] thing you can imagine was\nhappening in the smash community\ni know there definitely is sometimes\nsomeone's just like post this twit\nlonger about maybe a bad date they had\nwith somebody online\nand i could totally see why that would\nbe uncomfortable but it's not like the\nperson was evil just because\nyou know they don't know how to talk in\na first date i definitely get that\nbut then there's also of course the\nreally malicious predators that do\nterrible [ __ ] [ __ ]\noh wow i didn't realize things were that\nbad but okay\nyeah it was the smash community is it's\nit's in shambles right now dr k\nit's it's uh it's it's rough\nokay maybe\nmaybe we'll look into that and see if\nthere's some way we can help\nyeah i mean maybe that'd be a good\ncommunity to look into right now i mean\nthey've gone through a lot of what we've\nalready talked about right like they've\nhad a lot of those things pop\nup and they've had a lot of cases where\na lot of people that looked up to these\nstreamers\nturns out the streamers were doing\nterrible things so maybe like getting\ninvolved in that community to see\nwhere to go from there what to what to\nfix going forward\nbecause they could use some [ __ ]\nguidance they had the worst ideas\nthey so a lot of it had to do with like\nyou know\nchild predators that a lot of the people\nin the smash community were kids\nand one of their suggestions was to mark\nkids with a colored band and an\nx on their hands at all in-person events\nso that way older people would know not\nto try and [ __ ] them\nlike they have the worst ideas on how to\nhandle this [ __ ] it's terrible\nyeah so they could use some guidance and\nit's a it's rough\ni mean yeah i don't even know what to\nthink about that i\ni guess like because we do have like you\nknow we do have like you know you a\nwristband or whatever for like\nalcohol at parties or whatever right so\ni mean it's not\nit's not that crazy of an idea i think\nthe way that you frame it though is\nspeaks that oh no no no it wasn't that\nit was like we are going to give\nchildren a rape whistle and if their\nparents aren't holding their hands\nthey're not allowed in here because we\ncan't trust our adults in this community\nyeah right so i think that's that's\nawful because it's sort of\nyou know the solution there is not to do\nsomething with the kid i think it's to\ndo something with the adult\n100 yeah i think that would be the\nrational approach so charlie i'm\nnoticing we've kind of meandered around\na little bit is there something else\nthat you want to talk about or\ni mean we sort of talked about toxicity\ntalked a little bit about\nhow you're a warm and fuzzy human being\nnothing in particular man i just want to\ncompliment you on the good work you do\nif you don't mind me sucking your dick a\nlittle bit like i think you do a\ngreat job i think it's really important\nwork you do before\ni maybe i'm wrong but before you came\nalong on twitch i don't think anyone was\never even really talking about\na lot of the subjects that you like to\ncover and i think that's an important\nthing to do\nto both help improve the community\naround and just get people thinking\nabout\nthemselves and the platform they engage\non so just great work man\nyeah man thank you very much i you know\ni appreciate the the appreciation\num i that actually means a lot charlie\nbecause i respect you a lot i respect\nyour thoughts\ni think you're a good thinker like\ncomment on things like that's what i was\nsaying i recently discovered your\ncontent i really like the way that you\nthink and you break apart problems\nactually\num the way that you go through and\nanalyze things so to have\nto get your seal of approval actually\nmeans a lot to me\num and yeah\nthank you very much man well hey anytime\nman i appreciate the kind words i think\nthis has all been a really great\nconversation and\nwho knows maybe we'll see something\ngreat come from it you know maybe down\nthe line you do talk to some of these\ncommunities and these people and we get\na little better understanding of exactly\nwhat goes on and why some of these\nbehaviors like\nhate watching and just generally feeling\nbetter being mad as opposed to happy\npersists yeah like i think that'd be\nvery interesting to learn about\ncharlie can i ask you one last question\nand then we can talk about meditation\nfor a second\nabsolutely so my question is um so\nwhat can i do what should i do\nand you don't have to answer it now um\nbut\nbut i i you know so i like i said i\nappreciate your ability to look at\nproblems and analyze them and i think if\nyou've watched some of our content\nand and the positive feedback you've\ngiven to me so you know these people you\nknow the youtube community better than i\ndo you know the twitch community\nbetter than i know you know the twitter\ncommunity better than i do\nif you were to think about me as a\nresource to deploy\nwhich is really what i'm asking like\nwhat what should i do\nman that is that is a tough one um\ni guess what i would start with if i if\ni was to\nlaunch the icbm known as dr k yes i\nwould immediately start on twitter\nthat would be the first place i'd target\nbecause i think a lot of the general\nlike mindset the mind frame of a lot of\nthese people\nis born from twitter twitter i think is\njust that the past time a lot of people\ntake where when they're not doing\nsomething twitter's just so easily\naccessible\neasily digestible that they will just\nfind these things and get locked in this\necho chamber and these psycho fans\nand they'll just start to adopt these\nbeliefs and these mindsets where\ni'm happier when i'm mad i like to be\nmad and i just want to stay mad\nand i think getting to the root of where\nthat kind of comes from\nin maybe a group i don't know what group\nyou'd start with but maybe like a\nprominent group where this seems to be\ncommon\nand figure out why they prefer that as\nopposed to some\nbetter content where they're not [ __ ]\nfuming nine hours a day\nbecause i mean people treat twitter like\nit's a job they'll be on twitter for\nnine hours\nspamming all kinds of [ __ ] replying back\nand forth you'll it's not uncommon to\nsee an account have 200 000 tweets right\nlike why waste their time doing that\nwhat do they personally get out of it\ndo they feel fulfilled are they even\nhappy doing it what's the point\nthat would be where i'd start i wouldn't\nknow where to start but\nthe target would be twitter for me okay\nso you feel like twitter\nis is where you know the\nthe nexus of the tumor is oh\ni i would say that is the genesis of a\nlot of the\nthe the things we're seeing and talking\nabout when it comes to like toxicity and\nlike\ngeneral [ __ ] weird loser mentalities\nnot to call everyone a loser but you\nknow what i'm saying\ni think that's where it kind of stems\nfrom is they see\nthese posts have so many likes and so\nmuch engagement\nthat are really negative and so they'll\nstart doing it maybe to get the same\nfulfillment i don't know\ni can only speculate interesting that's\nnot what i was expecting\num you know i had thought that that\nmaybe what i should focus on is people\nwho dedicate\nthemselves to making negative content\nso the content as opposed to the\naudience\nyeah so like thinking about what\nmotivates someone to make\nuh a certain kind of content but which i\nguess sort of qualifies as twitter right\nbecause\nin twitter what happens is you have the\naudience making masses of content\nso the the content creator and the\naudience become one\nin twitter so now that i'm thinking\nabout it actually sort of makes sense\nbecause twitter is the place where\neveryone makes content right\nyeah like i mean the content is every\npost right so yeah\nso so it's one where the audience eats\nand you get to see the audience in a way\nthat oftentimes you don't on other\nplatforms\num interesting\ncool man thank you very much yeah of\ncourse and\nmy apologies in advance if you do choose\ntwitter you're gonna have a [ __ ]\nheadache man like that is\nthat is rough yeah we'll see right\num yeah and and are you interested in in\nthe deal talking about meditation for a\nminute or like learning how to meditate\nif you don't already\nsure yeah i'd love to hear more about it\ni've never done it myself i tried it\nwhen i was in college once or twice but\nthat's a that's a\nvery hard field to kind of master and\nfigure out\nsure so um\ncan i think for a second yeah by all\nmeans man no rush\nactually if you don't mind give me just\none more second sure i'll be right back\nokay chat we're gonna do something a\nlittle bit more\nadvanced today okay all right i'm sorry\nabout that\nno problem man how is that you did you\nget your starlight rare\ni wish i wish i just pulled it out over\nthere believe it or not i actually have\nthree of the second most valuable\nstarlight rare there is\nthere's more than one starlight rare oh\nyeah there's like five per\nevery three sets or something like that\noh interesting\ni thought so um\ncharlie what's your understanding of\nwhat meditation is\nthe way i understand meditation is it's\na short period of time where you clear\nevery single thought and problem\nfor pretty much as long as you can and\njust kind of\nbe right you just kind of sit on your\nown\nwithout any kind of thoughts or anything\nweighing you down more or less it's\nbasically just a clean slate for x\namount of time\nsort of that's how i understood it okay\nthat's that's actually like a pretty\ngood starting point\nso one of the goals of meditation\nis to shut off your mind so in the east\nthey believe that\nyou as a person as a being are not\nyour mind in the same way that we're not\nour body\nright so like if i like this is my hand\ni even describe it with the word\nmy which presumes for a moment that it's\nan\nobject that is not me so my pen\nmy hand my finger my fingernail\nso you don't right so use the possessive\nthe interesting thing is we also\nso people generally speaking know that\nthey're not their body like in theory if\ni were to have an accident\nand lose a finger i wouldn't be like\nchanged as a person\nthe like i may change in some ways like\nit i may sort of suffer some sense of\nidentity problem or something like that\ni may mourn i may feel like i'm deformed\nor all kinds of things can happen\nbut at the end of the day like me still\nexists\nand so the interesting thing is that\nmost of us sort of understand that\nour body is just our body and that we're\nnot necessarily our body somewhat\nconnected of course\nrelated interconnected it becomes more\ndifficult when it when it comes to the\nmind because we tend to think that our\nmind is\nus so our sense of like self-worth our\nsense of identity\num you know sort of being a neat or you\nknow being\nsuccessful or not successful being a\nstreamer being a gamer being a doctor\ncall it whatever you want to we\nthese are all the identifications of the\nmind we tend to think that that's who we\nare\nso meditation is actually the systematic\nprocess of trying to discover the true\nself\nwhich is actually outside of body and\noutside of mind\nand as a result of that we sort of get\nto practices that do what you kind of\ndescribe which is to shut off your mind\nor to exist with awareness outside of\nmind\nwith me so far okay i'm feeling you\nso what i'm going to teach you today is\nactually like a practice that i think is\npretty useful for\naddiction i don't think you're addicted\nto anything but it's just something that\ni've been\ni've been sort of teaching a couple of\nthe same things and i actually think\nthat\ni know this is going to sound bizarre\ncharlie but i think you're spiritually a\nlittle bit you're not actually a noob\nwhen it comes to spirituality so i'm\ngoing to teach you a slightly more\nrigorous practice if that's okay\ntrue so what i'm going to tell you is is\nfirst of all\nthe first step of meditation is the\nconcentration of awareness\nit is letting your awareness or your\nattention go\nwhere you want it to and if there is\none basic weakness that we have as a\nsociety it is not being able to control\nour attention so a lot of people say\nthat i'm not\ndisciplined right so what discipline\nreally is is it's the focus of attention\nit's not it's really not anything else\nit's just putting your attention where\nyou want it to go so if i sit down in\nfront of a book and i say\nit's time to study and then i point my\nattention at this book and then i say\ni'm going to read these words\nand then what happens is our mind\nwanders all over the place right and so\nthen i'm not able to study\nand what we perceive is discipline is\nsomeone who can actually control their\nattention\ni'm going to think about and focus the\nattention of my mind or being where i\nwant it when i want it\nand it's that basic skill which\nseparates like\npeople who are successful from people\nwho aren't\nso the next thing to think about is what\ndoes pull our attention in different\nplaces\nso the most common thing that pulls our\nattention in different places\nare the sense organs or the indriyas so\ncase in point we were talking about\nearlier like if we use the word hydra\ndick\nthen a lot of people see that word they\nhear that word\nin their mind pay attention right so i'm\ntempting them so i want you to notice\nbecause i'm trying to evoke it at them\nnow everyone is thinking about that and\nwanting to type that so already what\ni've done is i've used a sensory\ninput and their mind's attention is\nautomatically going in that direction\nso notice that right so all it takes is\nthe senses to control the attention of\nyour mind\nso we can think about that in terms of\nlike oh if you see a yu-gi-oh pack\nor i talk to you about a yu-gi-oh pack\nthis is something you're hearing\nsomething you're seeing and then your\nmind's attention\ngoes to the yu-gi-oh pack i smell\nalcohol i see people drinking i smell\nlike a burger cooking or like a hot dog\nvendor and then my attention goes there\nand then my behavior follows my\nattention\nwith me yeah makes sense so what i'm\ngoing to teach you today\nis the practice of separating your\nindriyas or your sense organs from your\nattention\ni'm going to teach you a practice so\nthat you can literally\nlearn how to control your mind and what\nwe're going to do\nis separate the indirect from the sense\norgan in a very very simple sense\nso what i'm going to do is show you\nsomething called\nthe sri yantra okay so this is a little\nbit it has a religious background but\nyou guys don't have to worry about the\nreligious part of it it really doesn't\nmatter\num this is uh so let me just think about\nhow to do this\nokay so y'all aren't going to be able to\nsee moist's face because i can't figure\nout how to do that\nand you can't see anything yet right\nme i see the the screen the the red\nokay so this is the sri yantra okay so\nthis is what i want you to do i'm going\nto zoom in a little bit\nokay so can you see the dot\nin the middle yes okay so what i want\nyou to do\nand so that i want all you guys to do\nthis okay so i want you to look at the\ndot\nand just stare directly at the dot\nand then what i want you to do is don't\nlook anywhere else and it's okay to\nblink if you want to okay so just take a\nmoment to stare at the dot\nlooking at it yeah i feel like i'm about\nto be like mind controlled or something\nto rob a bank for you\nuh close you're about to send me your\nentire yu-gi-oh collection\ni'm out all right this is not this okay\nso what i want you to do is\nnotice uh uh charlie as you as you look\nat the dot like what your mind is doing\nis your mind focused on the dot along\nwith your eyes\nor does your mind kind of fluctuate\nbetween the dot and other things\nfluctuate okay so now what i want you to\ndo\nis look at the dot and put your\nattention\ndon't look elsewhere but put your\nattention on the\nthe red outside the blue box\nyou see there's like a red square\noutside the blue box\nyeah so look at the dot but put your\nattention on the red\ndoes that make sense yeah and now i want\nyou to move to the blue square\nwith your attention but don't stop\nlooking at the dot\ncan you move your attention to the blue\nyeah i think so i think okay\nand now i want you to notice that there\nare circles\ninside the blue square\nand continue looking at the dot but then\ntell me what c\nwhat color or the circles inside the\nblue square\nyellow okay are there others\ni think yellow red yellow okay\nso now move further in what's inside the\nthree\ncircles the blue circle\nokay and then what's inside the blue\ncircle\nred okay\nand what's inside red what what does it\nlook like\nlike uh like rose petals it looks like\nokay\nokay and then move further inside so\nkeep staring at the dot\nit's okay to blink but let your\nattention\nmove closer so what's inside the pink\nrose petals red rose petals\nlooks like another another little ring\nof what color\nit's like a darker yellow okay and then\nkeep on moving inward so let your\nattention\nmove to the next layer in what's next\nit's another yellow circle okay and then\ngreen triangles k\nred triangles k blue triangles\nokay red triangles okay\ndot okay\nso what did you notice about how easy it\nwas to\nattend to things as they came closer to\nyour site\noh yeah it was a lot easier the outside\nwas a real struggle\nyep right so so yeah\ngo ahead i just couldn't figure out what\ni what i was seeing over there\ngetting pictures of bigfoot or something\nfor all i could tell so what we can see\nwhat we can notice first of all is that\nawareness loves being close to our\nsenses\nyou see that it's just a relief it\nrequires so much\nstrain to pull your awareness away from\nyour senses\nwould you agree with that agreed so now\nwe are first of all understand why\nstudying is hard\nbecause in studying like our attention\nwants to wander somewhere else and it's\nlike\nour injuries and our mind is going\nsomewhere else it's hard to focus it to\nwhere you want to go\nso now what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to do this practice again so we're\ngoing to do it for about two minutes\ni want you to just close your eyes for a\nsecond okay\nand just go ahead and recalibrate so\nchat did you guys understand that\nokay so now what we're gonna do uh\ncharlie is we're gonna start again and i\nwant you to open your eyes and look at\nthe red dot\nokay and what i want you to do is just\nfluctuate your attention so you can\ndecide you can move from the outside in\nor the inside out\nbut i want you to move your attention to\ndifferent layers\nof the picture okay and just practice\nmoving it\nin and out and focusing on something\nfocusing on another thing\nif you want to you are noticing um\nyou know the colors of the triangles but\nbetween the triangles there are also\nshapes so there are shapes created by\nthe negative space\nokay so you can even notice those\nbut we're going to practice for two\nminutes and just if you want to the\nsimplest way is just start from the\nfurthest outside and go in and then go\nback out but you can also just bounce\naround play with it\nokay then uh we'll try and freestyle\nthis here\nokay okay so i'm gonna start inside\nand just kind of go out so okay red dot\nred triangles and there's like\nin the negative space it's like a little\nyellow\ni don't know what they called the\nfour-sided shape not the square but the\none that's on its side like a rhomboid\nyep it's blue triangles\nyellow skinnier rhomboids\ni sound like a [ __ ] psychopath red\ntriangle okay so so pause for a second\nnotice how\nyou judge yourself for not coming up\nwith the right word right you see how\nthat thought popped up\nyeah so so for a moment your attention\nactually deviated completely away from\nthe practice and entered a judgment\nyeah damn so so that's okay so and then\nonce again you judge yourself\nfor judging yourself so return your\nattention to the dot okay start in the\ndot and don't tell me what you see\nso let's take that off your plate so be\nsilent\nand just fluctuate your attention play\naround with it do whatever you want to\nwe're gonna ask everyone to be silent\nfor like\nlet's say about two minutes\nand just move your attention between the\nlayers\nkeep going we're halfway there\nyou\nand now go ahead and close your eyes\nand notice that in the space in front of\nyour mind\nyou may see an image\nwhat do you see anything yeah i see the\nblue square\nthe yellow ring red a red ring inside\nthe yellow ring and then the yellow ring\nagain\nbeautiful so just focus don't stop\nfocusing so continue\nlooking at the image and continue the\npractice with your eyes closed\nso focus on the center\nor keep your mental eye on the center\nand let your attention fluctuate between\nthe layers and just\nsee with your eyes closed\ni don't know if this makes sense but do\nyour best not to lose it\ndoes that make sense yeah it's weird huh\ndon't lose it\nhold on i'm trying it's like a tug of\nwar right now\nyes this is meditation\nwhen you win this war you will control\nyourself\ni'm gonna open my eyes and it turns out\ni'm like levitating above my chair or\nsomething\nokay so your attention has wandered so\ngo ahead and stop\nwhen you're ready open your eyes yeah\ni had it for quite a while i'll say a\nlot longer than i thought i would\ngood so questions\nyeah how so this exercise right here i\nimagine this is one you've done\na lot of times sort of\nsomething similar yeah how long did it\ntake you of doing these exercises before\nyou finally like got the hang of it\nthat's a hard question\nso here's what my experience with\nmeditation is you think you get the hang\nof it\nand then the cool thing is like you\nstart to get the hang of other things\ni'm still getting the hang of it and i'm\nalso really good at it\nso i'll give you just an example so i do\na particular mantra so this is something\ncalled a yantra which is like a physical\nsymbol\nthat's actually like it's actually like\nmagic so if you really look at the\ntradition of\nof yantra which is part of the tantric\nor tantra\nbranch of meditation if you really\ndescribe it it's kind of like magic\nbut anyway i don't really put a whole\nlot of stock into that but i do a mantra\nso mantra is the chanting of a\nparticular syllab\nsyllable to cultivate a particular kind\nof energy\nnot really very actually there's some\nscience to it if we're being fair but\nnot not really scientific at all so it\ntook me some amount of time let's say a\nperiod of about\ntwo weeks to be able to sit and\nconcentrate on the montreal fully\nbut when you say get the hang of it i'd\nsay after a\ncouple of years it's hard to say\num it's hard to describe but i started\nseeing my mantra\nin other things so i\nheard when you close your eyes yeah\nthat's a yantra so mantra is a sound\nso i started to hear the sound of my\nmantra in\nthe rhythm of life is the best way i can\ndescribe it\nand it's kind of the best indicator i\ncan give you is like close your eyes\nand listen to the sound of your breath\ncan you hear it no i don't hear a\n[ __ ] thing\nokay that's like deep breath so deep\nbreath\ngood so go ahead breathe good\nso the anyway so i know this is going to\nsound kind of weird but have you heard\nthat sound anywhere else\nit is the only time i would have ever\nreally heard that sound that i can think\nof is maybe during like some big\nphysical exertion where i'm like\nyou know panting or on the verge of\ncollapsing like what pops to mind is\nwhen i used to play basketball right\nokay how close are you to uh the ocean\noh not not close okay so one day if you\nget the chance\nand you're at the ocean i would listen\nto the sound of the ocean\nand then listen to the sound of your\nbreath\nand see if they sound similar they sound\ndifferent\nso this is kind of a leading exercise\nright so what i discovered it was it's\nhard to describe but what i found is\nthat my mantra is like\na very fundamental sound that can be\nheard in many many many many places\nand so in a sense i felt like that's\nwhen i really started getting the hang\nof it\nand so the goal of meditation is you\nstart to discover things and like learn\nthings about yourself about\na universe we're talking really culty\nbut honestly that's what it's\nlike hard to describe but it's like it's\nsort of like you know when i ask you the\nexperience of is it\nyou know you learn something fundamental\ntoday when you look at that thing and\nyou're like\nit's so difficult to see the outside and\nit's so easy to see the inside\nand what you're literally doing is doing\npush-ups for your mind where you're\ntraining your attention to go where you\ndecide\ninstead of it following your indriyas or\nyour sense organs\nif you become free of your indriyas\nin terms of where your attention goes\nyour life will be completely different\nif we think about someone who's\ndisciplined they smell a burger and they\norder a salad\nwhat is that it's separation from\nattention from the indira\nseparation from the attention to the\nindriya is one of the most crucial\nskills and we don't teach it to people\nand you can start with this practice\nbecause literally all it is there's\nnothing to there's no\nsignificance it's just a sterile\nenvironment it's a sandbox\nwhere you put your indoria in one place\nand you put your attention somewhere\nelse\nand it's [ __ ] hard and then what\nhappens is you close your eyes and you\nsee that after image\nand then i tell you charlie hold\non and you're like it's a war you're\ndamn right it's a war\nand when you start winning that war when\nyou wake up one day and you say on\njanuary 1st i'm gonna go to the gym\nevery day\nthere's that thought and it's really\neasy and you're highly motivated on\njanuary 2nd\nthat start thought starts to pull away\nbecause you haven't learned how to hold\non\nyou don't know how to hold on to\nsomething that's slipping away from your\nmind\nthis is a practice that literally you do\npush-ups\nto hold on to what you choose to hold on\nto\nand you get better at it\nand then you'll be able to go upstairs\nyeah it's that simple\nbut it's very difficult so practice i'll\nsend you a link for the sri yantra if\nyou\nare interested it's good if you want to\ni i would get\ni would get a physical picture so you're\nnot looking at a screen though\nbut it's a good yantra to start with um\nand\nit you know it also sent me all your\nyugioh card\ndon't you ever say we don't even joke\nabout that in this holy sanctuary\nthey have a lasting home they don't need\nto go anywhere any other questions\nno man i've just really enjoyed this i\nreally appreciate you having me on\nyeah it's been fun for me too charlie i\nreally appreciate the work you do man\noh thank you and i appreciate your work\nas well all right man\ntake care you too have a great are you\ngoing to keep streaming\nnope are you streaming no no no i was\njust going to say have a great rest of\nthe stream but if you're\nheading out yeah if you were streaming\ni'd rate you but\nokay that's sweet all right take care\nman bye thanks here\nokay that was cool"
