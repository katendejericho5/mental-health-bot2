that you\ncan understand yourself better and the\ncool thing and like this is what i\nreally like about our community is like\na lot of people like the boomer\ngeneration thinks that we're lazy or\nundisciplined or whatever but\nin my experience actually when you when\nyou really give\num you know a gamer or someone from\ntwitch or like a millennial or gen z or\nlike when you actually\ngive them a game that's not rigged\nagainst them and you like say like hey\nman time to like play this game\num you guys knock it out of the park and\nit's just\nequipping you to help you do what you\nwere on this earth to do\nwhich is to knock it out of the park\nthat's what coaching is\nso on september 4th we're going to have\na lot of spots opening up\nfor people who are interested uh you can\nsign up on the links that i submitted\nso today we're going to be talking with\na guy who's spent eight thousand dollars\non dating coaching\nand so i don't know what's up with this\num so we're gonna try to find out\nso we're gonna hop in with atomic\nwelcome buddy and and what am i what am\ni calling you\nfriend i'm alex\nalex okay um yeah so i was just gonna\ntell can you tell us a little bit about\nuh you know i know there's sort of a\nclick-baity title which is that you\nspent eight grand on dating coaching\nand so um is there something in\nparticular that you want to talk about\ntoday alex\num yes um i guess probably a good\ndirection would be like in line of like\ni can say like what would be like a\nbetter way for me to learn how to like\nget better at like\nuh connecting with people or i was like\nwhat's kind of like blocking me in\nparticular\nlike when i say a thousand grand dating\ncoaching like a lot of people might\nthink it's not like one big company was\nactually on\ni spent eight thousand dollars on seven\nuh personal dating coaches so i had uh\nseven different dating coaches like\nbasically how it was ran they were like\num\nthey're like weekly uh skype training\nlike if you wanted me to go more into\ndetail into that\nlike there's definitely a huge variety\nof like i kind of like how i did things\nsure i mean but the but the issue here\nis that like despite like\nyou know having like seven different uh\ndating coaches i\nstill pretty much got rejected by\nliterally every single girl ever\napproached\nit's like they um never even like gave\nme a chance pretty much\nokay like and i was actually like um\nlike pretty clear on what my intentions\nwere like when i define approach like i\nwould um\ni go up to them in person like um the\nplaces where i would approach would be\nlike uh on campus for example i would\napproach in\nuh stores uh sometimes in bars but\nright now i'm 20 years old so i'm under\n21 so\nit kind of it cost me extra money to get\ninside of bars\nbut yeah so basically like like on the\nstreets like on campus\nin stores and\nokay yeah like i'm i'm struck by the\nword approach\nlike it's like you're going in for a\nbombing run\nyou know we're we're like on the\napproach\ndoes that it sounds kind of like oh yeah\nanother name for it is like sargeant\nanother name for it is what\na sergeant what does that mean\ni might be wrong but it might be like a\nlike a military term\nor something like you're approaching\nwomen i'm not that aggressive with\num yeah i mean okay\nso so a couple of things atomic so so\nalex thank\nthank you so much actually for coming on\nstream today and sharing some of these\nthoughts\num twitch hat feels and i wouldn't\nrecommend reading to a chat but twitch\nchat feels like this is way too real\nso i think it's something that a lot of\nour you know a lot of\npeople on twitch struggle with so thank\nyou very much for sharing your\nperspective\num and all offering yourself up on the\naltar of sacrifice\nfor the the knowledge growth and\nentertainment and lulls\nof twitch um yeah so can you tell me a\nlittle bit about\nyou know how you decided to get a dating\ncoach or\nor kind of how does that happen\nokay so basically like what made me get\na dating coach yeah so basically\nthe first time i uh uh\nmy first dating coach was like in my\nsenior year in high school like\nlike basically i was like you know\nextremely lonely like\ni also just like struggled with\nsocializing in general and i was like\neven before that also like i watched a\nbunch of video programs as well\ni like talking to them and i was like\nvideo programs about what\nlike um basically like pua but there's\nalso like\nthis weird nlp stuff where you're like\nusing language patterns\nto like attract women what is\np-u-a and nlp uh so p-o-a\nis basically like pick-up artists okay\nand nlp\nstands for neuro-linguistic uh\nprogramming\nso it's kind of like it's it's very\nrelated to hypnosis but you're like\nimplementing it into like your language\nto\num i guess hypnotize women but that's i\nguess like more the\ncreepier side of uh sure\ndoing things yeah so i mean i understand\nthat it comes across as creepy alex but\ni i like that you're\nsort of representing it i think the way\nthat it's advertised right\nthat's sort of what they that's what\nthey set out\nto do um and so you said that you'd\nwatched a bunch of videos so even before\nwe get to the dating coach when did you\nstart getting videos or start getting\ninterested in this stuff\ni mean i'd say uh like my motivation was\njust like\ni completely like uh dissatisfied like\nwhere i am right now\nand when did you start to become\ndissatisfied\nand i guess with uh women with women in\ngeneral it was um\ni think it started like just as early as\nmy freshman year in high school\nokay and how old were you then\nlike when i was a freshman in high\nschool yeah maybe like\n13 or something okay\nso you were 13 years old and can you\ntell me what\nfeeling dissatisfied felt like\nuh i meant china i mean i was definitely\nlike um\nlike pretty lonely i mean i also kind of\nfelt like\nlike alienated because i felt like um\nlike i was being\nlike i didn't think of myself as like a\nweird person but\neven like let's say if it was just like\na normal group setting\nlike people ask me like um hey alex are\nyou doing like\nnow like say stuff and then like okay\nthey just\nthey would what\ni mean it's like everyone else like\ntalks to each other very normally but\nwhen people\ntalk to me it's just like normal like\nhow high is how was your day and like\nyeah it's very good and\ni kind of like have trouble with like\ngoing beyond\nlike small talk sure so i guess i felt\ninadequate\nuh like with my ability to socialize\nsure it was a great part of it yeah so\nso you know you speaking of\nneuro-linguistic programming\nso you know let's how are you feeling\nright now by the way alex\num i feel fine okay so you know it's\ninteresting because you kind of talked\nabout being in a normal group\nand you also use the word like feeling\npretty\nlonely and alienated so i'm wondering if\nyou sort of felt like an\noutsider among normal people yeah\nright very much and and everyone else is\nsort of like doing this thing and it\nsort of seems so like effortless they're\njust like talking to each other\nand and you don't it seems to me like\nyou felt like you were\ninadequate at sort of being able to\nengage with like other human beings on\nkind of like\nan authentic level\nyeah pretty much and so what\nthat sounds\nhow did you understand that how did you\nthink about that like what did you\nlike because when we were faced with a\nsituation right like our mind tries to\nmake sense of it\nhow did you make sense of that\num\nand then like and i kind of like felt\nlike there was like nothing in\nparticular\nthat seemed like like there was anything\nwrong with me except that\nlike i just really like sucked at\nconnection with people how to socialize\nlike\nlike it felt like there was like some\nthing that i'm like unaware of\nand um\ni've also i've always also been like\nlike treated very mainly\nlike um ever since i was a kid as well\nso i'm kind of curious about that but\nlet me see if i\nkind of understand you here so i'm kind\nof trying to put myself in your shoes\nand and maybe i was to a certain degree\nat some point in my life and i i can\nimagine that maybe you felt like\nyou couldn't see anything wrong with you\nand it didn't feel like there was\nanything wrong with you but\nwhen you looked from the outside like\nclearly there's something\nlike wrong with you you just don't know\nwhat it is\nlike you can't see it you can't feel it\nbut when you look at the results of your\ninteractions\nsomething's not adding up\num yeah that sounds exactly\nright and and so that's got to be kind\nof confusing because\nyou know you have evidence that\nsomething's wrong but you have no\nvision you can't detect what's wrong\num yeah and and what happens\nin your mind when when you kind of come\nto that conclusion\nit's a hard question by the way because\ni'm asking you to boil down a lot of i\nthink what has taken\nyears to kind of understand how do you\nsee yourself what's the conclusion that\nyou come to\noh so basically like what's my opinion\nlike on myself\nsure\ni mean i guess like if we're talking\nabout like\num yeah like when i was a freshman like\nyeah i definitely uh\ni used to like hate myself a lot i guess\nlike nowadays um\ni'm to be honest i don't really like\nkind of like have a relationship with\nmyself anymore although if i do look in\nthe mirror\nlike i'll have this reaction where i\nkind of like just cringe so\non a very uh subconscious level i do\nthink\nlike i'm kind of like cringy and what is\ncringy like\nyeah basically it's like socially like\nlike inadequate okay\ndo you feel inadequate\num yeah i'd say yeah okay\nthat's some powerful stuff you just\nshared man\num to hate yourself as a freshman to\nlook in the mirror and like at yourself\ncringing\nbecause i almost get the sense that you\ncatch yourself it's not something that\nyou actively do\nbut it's just like right yeah\nyeah literally like a subconscious\nreaction\nyeah so some i may use the word visceral\nthere\nso it's like because it sounds like\nyou're aware of it on some level right\nit's like something inside you is like\noh like look at that [ __ ]\nand then it kind of and then you like\nyour it sounds like you learned how to\npush that way\nand not let that be active\ndoes that make sense um yeah that\ndefinitely uh makes sense because if i\nlet me just try to put together what i\nheard so you used to hate yourself\nand now you said that you don't have a\nrelationship with yourself\nand so but at this at the same time\nsometimes you\ncatch those feelings of hate when you\nlook at yourself in the mirror\nso that really feels to me like\nsuppression does that make sense\nthat it used to be conscious oh yeah\nthat makes sense and now it's become\nsubconscious but it's still there\nand sometimes it pokes its head out\nyeah totally yeah so what did you hate\nyourself for as a freshman\nyeah i think it was um definitely\nbecause i\nyou know struggled with um things like\nmaking friends and uh\nit's like socialize in general\nand like i felt like that was like the\none the one part of my life that i was\nlike very bad at\nlike i remember like when i was a kid\nlike my person was telling me i used to\nbe like extremely shy\nbut nowadays that actually doesn't apply\nto me at all like i can\nlike go up to and approach women very\neasily like even out in public\napproach and like you know state my yeah\nyeah and also i state my premise\nand um what does that mean\nso um in the pickup artists uh community\nit's basically like letting her know\nlike what the whole conversation is like\nall about like state your premise\nlike an example could be like\nlike if you're using a direct opener for\nexample you could be like\nlike while i thought you were very\nbeautiful wanted to come and talk to you\nat that point she may realize that\nyou're trying to like seduce her but\nalso it could be like\nlike me asking her out or or i guess\nlike kind of\nlike trying to like pull her from like\nthe certain venue like\nif she says like she wants to go to like\na free bird's brito place and i'm like\nat the targets i'd be like oh i mean can\ni come with your friends\nor yeah basically like asking her the\none i did the most was just like\nasking her for a number like to go on on\na date with her\nokay and how does that work\nwhat do you mean i mean does how does\nthat work out for you\nyeah i mean basically um\nthe longest i have ever\ni mean the okay yeah the farthest i've\never been to\nand with getting a woman was basically\nshe gave me her number and then she\nliterally like\ngoes with me so like i haven't really\neven done like a\ndate before okay how does it feel to say\nthat\ni guess i'm not sure like\nbelieving i guess\nwhat's relieving about it\nand i kind of like\ni'm not sure yeah so i'm asking you hard\nquestions alex you're doing a fantastic\njob\nand i think we're talking hard questions\nyeah dude the simplest ones are usually\nthe hardest\nthe ones that have to do with\nunderstanding ourselves it's really easy\nto understand women right like the\npua folks have them all figured out far\nharder to understand yourself\num i i didn't mean that as a dig\ni hope you didn't take it that way but\nit occurred to me that that came across\nas a little bit condescending\ndid it feel that way to you\nuh not really okay so you know it's\ninteresting\nalex because i i can imagine saying i've\nnever really been on a date with someone\nif you're you know live streaming on the\ninternet in front of thousands of people\nwhat i would expect is that you would\nfeel shame\ndid you feel shame\nhonestly not at all yeah so there's\nsomething really cool\nwith that right like that like there's\nsomething very special and i think\nsomething really important\nabout because if you ask i'm sure if you\nask people hey\nwhat would you guys say about like going\non the internet\nand live streaming your your you know\nthat you've never been on a date\nand you feel relief and i think that's\nsomething that's really really important\npowerful and worth understanding\nalthough i don't know we're gonna quite\nget to it right the second\ndo you have any idea why you would feel\nrelief instead of shame\nif not we can cover it at the end i'm\njust kind of curious it's a hard\nquestion\ni mean i\ni mean for one i guess i don't really um\nfeel shameful about you know wanting to\nget better with women\ngood for you like i know like a lot of\npeople think that makes you a creep and\na lot of people you know call me a creep\nbutts\ni know that i'm not really you know i'm\nnot doing anything\nthat's bad like i'm not like i'm not\nharassing anyone like\nlike\nso yeah okay\nman alex sorry if i'm bouncing around a\nlittle bit but there's like a lot of\nwhat you're saying that i think has\nimmense value and there's a lot to\nunderstand\num is it if is it okay if we kind of go\nback to like\nearlier and then sort of maybe do a\nlittle bit of a timeline\nso you said that you used to hate so you\nused to hate yourself as a freshman\nand and that was because you had trouble\ntalking to people\nyeah i definitely what did you hate\nabout yourself\nwhat did you hate about yourself i mean\noh yeah i heard the question i was just\nlike okay kind of thinking yeah\nand i guess because like\ni just it's like very socially awkward\npretty much okay\nokay so that's so and then you said\nearlier that you were treated meanly\ncan you tell us about that\ni treated badly um yeah i definitely um\ni was um when i went to like this\nother school in elementary yeah i\nbasically\ni used to live in a different state from\nlike you know uh\nk through eighth grade then i i moved to\nanother states\nyou know you know for high school yeah\nbasically\nyeah they keep the kids would like treat\nme like very bad like\nlike especially like during a recess\nlike i was always\ni guess like like all by myself\nand other guys were like you know\nplaying basketball and\nyou know uh playing flag football and i\nwas like the only one like\nnot joining in\nand what what can i mean it's not just\nthat but i mean they're also like\nyou know call me names and stuff what\nwould they call you\nyeah i don't really want to talk about\nthat to be honest but okay\nthanks for letting me know can i ask you\num i'm not going to ask you any more\nquestions about that\nsort of but what i would like to\nunderstand\nis what makes you uncomfortable talking\nabout it is it okay if i ask that\num i mean i suppose\nyou're also allowed to say no\ni want to respect your space man but i\nthink it's important\nand if you want me to i'm happy to\nexplain why i think it's important\ni mean it's kind of hard for like me to\ndescribe like why it feels uncomfortable\nlike about talking talking about it yeah\ncan i tell you why i think you feel\nuncomfortable\num yeah please so you know how early we\nwere talking about\nhow do you protect yourself alex from\nthe hate that you feel towards yourself\nso how do i protect myself from like the\nhate i feel for myself\nwhat do you do you used to hate yourself\nyou don't\nhave a relationship with yourself\nanymore right how do you protect\nyourself from that\nyou push it away yeah yeah right so\nthis oppression you talked about perfect\nso now i think the reason\nthat you're uncomfortable is because i'm\nasking you to not suppress\ni'm asking you to do the very opposite i\ndon't think any of this [ __ ] has\nanything to do with women\nso if we think about this so you ready\nfor the answer\ni know we're only like 20 minutes in but\ni've got an answer for you\ndo you want i mean it could be wrong so\nmore likely to be wrong because i'm\nmaking a big judgment right\nso i have a hypothesis so it's not an\nanswer that's actually arrogant\ni have a hypothesis and i'm going to run\nit by you and then i want to know what\nyou think and then if you're okay with\nit we can explore it\ni know everyone here is is being\nvoyeuristic because they want to hear\nabout this noob who spent eight thousand\ndollars on dating coach et cetera et\ncetera\nwe're not going to give them what\nthey're looking for we're actually going\nto try to help you and help them instead\nand get to the pickup artist stuff later\nawesome so i want you to just\ni have one question for you how do we\nlearn how to see ourselves\nlike you see yourself a particular way i\nsee myself a particular way\nhow did i learn how to see myself\ni mean i suppose a lot of it can come\nfrom like\nyour environments like yeah and you're\nlike\nthe stuff that like happens to you yep\nright so so what were you taught\nabout yourself from k to eight\nyeah basically like a bunch of negative\nstuff like that\nyep just like wouldn't fit in yep and so\nhow did you feel\nat 13 you went to a new high school but\nwhat did you know about yourself before\nyou even stepped into the door\nwhat did you know about yourself alex is\na guy who doesn't\nyeah i basically carried over the same\nstuff yeah alex is a guy who\nyou know like isn't normal absolutely\nand then you open yourself up to a\nreally dangerous thing\nwhich is something called a confirmation\nbias\nso you start with the get-go before you\neven step in the door\nalex is a guy who doesn't fit in\neverything else that you've tried to fix\nthat so you've tried to fix\nthat right like you've spent a lot of\ntime\nand effort and and i don't think you're\nlike a creep i think\ni think it's quite noble if you see a\nweakness in yourself to try to get\nbetter at it\ni actually salute you for doing it but\nlet me ask you\nanother weird question alex\nwhy don't if we try to fix something\nand it doesn't get fixed what are the\nreasons that it doesn't get fixed\nso let me actually ask in a different\nway sorry that's a too abstract of a\nquestion so i'm a doctor right\nsometimes as a doctor i use treatments\nright and i use treatments to fix\nproblems with me\ni know it's super simple\nso if a treatment doesn't work what are\nthe reasons that the treatment may not\nwork\ni mean it could be like you're trying to\ntreat like the wrong thing or something\nabso [ __ ] lutely so now let me ask\nyou scientifically\nif you're a guy who watches a bunch of\nvideos and spends eight thousand dollars\non dating coaching\nand it doesn't work what are the reasons\nfor that\ni wasn't i was like trying to focus on\nthe wrong thing\nabsolutely and that's like just logical\nright because\nthis is a very well-developed system\nyou're clearly a smart guy\nyou've been trying hard you're not an\nidiot\nand it doesn't seem to be a work\nand it doesn't seem to be working and so\nmy\nsense actually is that this has nothing\nyou're not socially incompetent\ni mean you may be on some level but you\nknow it sounds like you've actually\nworked on those skills like\nyou used to be shy you even tell us\nyou've made progress and it's still not\nworking\nwhich makes us kind of scratch our heads\noh you're uh\nthe mic is sometimes transmitting\nso so like i just want you to think\nabout that because like you've overcome\nyour shyness you've learned how to\napproach women those were things that\nyou used to struggle with\nyou've actually improved in the ways\nthat you perceived as your weakness and\nit's still not working\nwhich then suggests to me in a very\nsimple logical level that you're trying\nto treat the wrong thing\nand i think the thing that is broken\nwithin you is not\nand your diagnosis of yourself is based\nupon something that is based on an\nassumption or an experience that you now\ntry to actively ignore which is why like\nnothing's gonna work\nright doesn't mean that you can't get\nbetter doesn't mean that you can't go on\na date doesn't mean you can't find love\nand get married or\nyou know sleep with a bunch of women if\nthat's what you want to do like whatever\nfloats your vote\nwhat i'm saying is that like something\nabout what doesn't seem to be working\nand i think that's because you're like\nsolving the wrong problem\nbecause all of this is laid on the\nfoundation that alex\nisn't good at what\nalex isn't good with people socializing\nyep here's the crazy thing i don't\nactually accept that as true\ni don't accept that as true for a minute\nbecause i think\nthat is not something that\nin a sense is true it's not about you\nit's about the way that people\ntreated you you had like\nsecond graders telling you that you\ndon't fit in\nand you may not have fit in it's not\nuntrue right because you didn't fit in\nand they did believe\nso it's like sort of true like you're\nnot an idiot but like i don't accept\nthat conclusion\nthat you formed before you turned 13.\nand my sense is that if we can change\nthat conclusion if you can look at\nyourself in the mirror\nand not cringe at what you see because\nlike that's the [ __ ] problem like\nwhatever that thing is within you\nlike any time you approach or sarge a\ngirl\nyou can come up with all these [ __ ]\ntechniques but as long as that\nrot is inside you i don't think\nthis is gonna work\nwhat do you think about that yeah i\nthink\nyou know that definitely makes sense\nlike trying to work on like the um\nat deeper levels yep good\ni i think so so alex i i respect you\nimmensely\nwhat do you think about that\num yeah thanks do you have any idea\nfirst of all do you believe me\ni mean i believe you why would i respect\nyou\ni mean like i'm just like being like\nopen and like honest\nyep that's certainly a part of it what\nelse\noh what could be\ni'm sorry you said you don't know what\nit could be\nlike what could it be yeah that's a\nquestion right so now we get to another\nimportant question i'm going to tell you\nin a second but like\ni want to notice i'm not sure if this is\njust awkward and i'm putting you in a\nweird situation but like\ni'm trying to get a sense of whether you\ncan gauge\nsomeone when someone looks at you what\ndo they see\nwhat do you think\num and it's kind of like cartoon like\ni like a hard question like what do you\nmean yeah so so it's a very hard\nquestion\nso i i i wonder if on some level\nwhen other people look at you what you\nassume\nis what they see is what you see when\nyou look in the mirror\nwhich is someone who's like on the\nsurface doing a good job but underneath\nis kind of cringy\nis that how people see you\ni mean it's a possibility that they\ncould see that yep it is a possibility\nwhat do you think they see\ndo you know\ni might and i kind of feel like at first\nthey like\njust seemed like no real guy but they\nlike try talking to me like\nyeah they yeah like once they start\ntalking to me like they might see\nsomeone's just like cringy yep right so\nso i'm gonna say what i said earlier\nand try to map it on to what you said on\nthe surface\nthey see a normal guy and underneath\nis cringy so you can pass for a normal\ndude\nuntil you start interacting right and\nthen what i do is i\ni have this gold statue and i scratch\nthe gold a little bit and hold on a\nsecond that's not gold underneath\nlooks like gold on the outside looks\nnormal\nbut underneath scratch it a little bit\nengage with a little bit\nand inside is alex cringy\nand so that's not what i see\ni can see because i i don't think that's\nactually what\nthey see i think that's what you think\nthey see\nand you think you're cringy and\ntherefore\nthey see cringy\ni see a guy who tries i see a guy who's\nsmart\ni see a guy who's dedicated and who's\ntrying to make himself a better person\nand i tend to judge the pua scene so\napologies for that that may not\nbe fair of me but at the end of the day\ni see a dude who [ __ ] gives a [ __ ]\nand tries to make his life a little bit\nbetter than it is\ni see a dude who says hey this is a\nproblem that i have and i'm not willing\nto accept it i want to change it\nand mad respect man i can get behind you\na hundred percent for that\nopen and honest and all that [ __ ] like\nyou know balls of steel for coming on\nstream and all that stuff is there too\nbut at the end of the day alex i'm in\nyour corner because i think you're\ntrying to become better than what you\nare\nand you're not taking it taking it\nlaying down\nyou're not like saying oh woe is me\nyou're saying like i'm going to try to\ndo something about it\nbut i don't know if you see that in\nyourself do you\ni mean i mean maybe like i mean to the\nto a degree yeah but i also like kind of\nlike see someone like\nlike who's like basically like a hard\ncase\ni guess that makes any sense yep\nmakes a lot of sense\nnot quite hopeless but damn near close\ndoes that make sense\ni'm good yeah so i'm going to say it in\na different way\nyou're a guy who's not willing to give\nup despite the fact that you're hopeless\ndoes that make sense\num yeah it does yep so let's be honest\nbecause i think you think you're\nhopeless\nbut you're not willing to accept it\nhard truth to face yeah that's\nhow does it feel to hear that that's\ntrue\nand feels good it's\n[ __ ] [ __ ] weird though right here\ni\nam telling you alex you're a guy who has\nno hope\nand you're like that feels like\ni think that how does it work man\ni don't know it's weird\nwhat are you feeling right now\ni feel pretty good okay what does that\nmean pretty good\num\nkind of like uh pretty happy like pretty\nrelieved i guess\nyeah right so so can i toss out a word\ndo you feel\nunburdened\nless heavy i'm not trying to put words\nin your mouth but it seems like\nyeah less time yeah yeah yeah less\nheavier\ndefinitely a good one yep okay so\nalex on the one hand i don't want to\nlead you and on the other hand sometimes\nyou know i've been doing this a little\nbit for a little while now so sometimes\ni can\nguess based on how people are feeling is\nit okay if i sometimes\nprompt you with words if you can't find\nthe right one until we find what you're\nfeeling\nthat's all right okay so now alex we\ncome to a really\ndifficult fork in the road\nso the question is so i i said earlier\nthat i'm going to respect your choice\nnot to talk about your upbringing but it\nis my belief that that's\nthe foundation of all this [ __ ]\nso i'm going to give you a choice i\nthink it would be productive to talk\nabout and at the same time i want to\nrespect you it doesn't have to be now it\ndoesn't\ncould be different place different\nperson whatever but i think that's where\nthe money is\nand i wanted to explain to you you know\nwhy i was asking about that\nor we can talk about you know the\nexperience of dating coaching\npickup artists nlp\nyou know what it's like to work with\nseven coaches what kind of stuff you\nwanted to talk about i think both of\nthose\nwould be very educational i think one\nis going to be for twitch and one is\ngoing to be for you\nand so i leave that to you\nwell which one do you uh i think i\nshould do like\nif you want me to talk about the\nupbringing stuff i could try to\nlike do a little bit more if that's what\nyou want\nif not then i can also talk about your\nstuff that like either way is good\nyeah so so i i do think we should talk\nabout k through eight because what i\nwant is to help you so every time when i\nstream with someone\ni try to help the person that i'm\ntalking to the most and that's\nmy true north and at the same time\nyou know i want to respect your\nboundaries but like i really think that\nlike because like you said\nthe day you walked in to ninth grade\nyou already knew there was a\nself-fulfilling prophecy\nand everything that you've built on that\nassumption\nis like your strategy for life and when\nevery you've built this\nbeautiful skyscraper on a false\nfoundation\nand so anything that you try to do to\nfix anything\nin that skyscraper is just based on a\nfundamentally flawed\nfoundation and i think that if you can\nokay okay i'll talk about it\nokay so what is up it's very like um\nlike like one of the things that they\ncall me is like um like a [ __ ]\nokay\nand and what what what would make them\nsay that\ni mean i was i mean to be fair like\na k through like seventh grade\ni mean i wasn't the best student but by\nstarting like the eighth grade\nthen into high school like i actually\nbecame like uh\nlike a straight a student and actually i\ndon't think it has anything\nto even do with grades like they just i\nthink it was basically like\nand i just like felt very shy and stuff\nand\nand like i'd say the best word to do is\nlike maybe like social incomes like\nmaybe\nsure and like maybe they perceived that\nas being like less intelligent\nsure like even though i wasn't really\nleft intelligent i was actually you know\na very good student\nyeah and so they just saw something\nabout you and they they chose to pick on\nyou\nand then how did you feel about yourself\nwhen they would call you these things\ndo you remember\ni mean definitely like very a terrible\nlike\ni also felt like very alienated like\nback then like we had like\nlike back then it was actually very\nsmall school\nlike one time i decided not to like sit\nwith them\nand yeah that felt very awkward because\nsitting by myself so then i had to go\nback to scene with him\njust so i could like be seen with other\npeople yeah\nlike does that like kind of like answer\nthe question beautifully\nalex beautifully\ni think you share you share a lot\nwith a very small story what i see is a\nkid who's stuck\n[ __ ] either way right\neither you like sit with the abuse\nand you're alienated with them or you're\nalienated by yourself\nbut what i see is a child who is\nhas an inescapable truth that either way\nyou're alienated\ndoes that make sense\num yeah it makes uh perfect sense and so\nthen you learned\nhow to act right so i'm also hearing\nsomething really important there which\nis that like\nwhen you were hanging out when you went\nback the next day and sat at the table\nwhat was that like can you tell us\ntell us a story alex you're a very good\nstoryteller\ncan you just tell us a story about you\nknow being in elementary school\njust something that jumps out about like\nmaybe feeling alienated or feeling fake\nwell basically um it was like 15\ndifferent guys versus one\nso in that regards i was like a little\nbit like\nintimidated because like are they gonna\nlike mess with my food and stuff\nlike it wasn't that like i wasn't tough\nor anything\nbut i feel like one guy against like 15\npeople like obviously\ni'm not going to lose no matter what\nyeah and what did you do because you\nwere going to lose no matter what\nyeah basically not even like try\ninteresting what would trying look like\num what do i look like exactly i mean\ni mean kind of hard to say but\nand i just like didn't know what to do\nlike\nokay\nso i respectfully disagree with\nsomething you said a little earlier\nso 15 versus one what's the point in\ntrying\nfeels hopeless right\nit's impossible feel familiar\nwe talked about that before oh yeah\nand here's the crazy thing i don't think\nyou you gave up on trying\ni think you tried anyway\nbecause like that's what sitting back at\nthe table is the second day\ngiving up is moving by yourself\nand then going back and sitting with\nthem even though they bully you\nthat's not giving up that's\ntrying in the face of hopelessness\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah i think that makes perfect sense so\nthis is who you are and this is what i\nrespect about you\nbecause you're a guy who says [ __ ] it\nright even though it's painful and i\nmake it sound glorious and the movies\nmake it sound glorious\nthe truth is that it's horribly painful\nand is scarring and traumatic\nbut you tried anyway\nand then you said i didn't know what to\ndo\nnow let me ask you something alex when\nit comes to approaching women\nwould you that feeling of like being\ndifferent\nand being hopeless and not knowing what\nto do\ndo you carry that with you when you\napproach a woman\num yeah precisely it's also part of the\nreason\nalso part of the reason why i have to\nstick to these like\ndumb routines yeah but the dumb routines\ndon't seem like they're working right so\nwe'll get to those in a second\nbut here's the problem like i i don't\nknow how else to say this alex but\nthe things that hold you back today and\nthat you carry with you\nare your words precisely\nwhat you felt years ago and so here's\nthe really cool thing\nif you deal with those feelings this\nentire skyscraper\nis going to come tumbling down\nyour problems with women i know this\nsounds [ __ ]\nin a sense will vanish\nbecause they're not problems with women\nthey're problems with you the reason\nthat i think women reject you is because\nwhen they scratch beneath the surface\nwhat they see is what you are and as\nlong as you believe that that's what you\nare\nthat's what they're going to see\nand so occasionally you may find someone\nwho has like a lot of compassion\nand who may pity you but that's not\ngoing to be a healthy relationship\nand it's just not gonna and those women\nget turned off by the pickup artist kind\nof approach like the chad approach\nsarge like they got turned off by that\nkind of stuff\nyou know like you know i mean i think so\nmuch of what you say about like what you\nfeel today\ni think was born a long time ago and now\ni'm gonna tell you why i think it's\nbizarre that you feel\nrelief when basically if you take\nwhat i say to you out of context i sound\nlike a complete [ __ ]\ni'm saying no man you don't have a\nlittle bit of hope you're [ __ ]\nhopeless\nright like and then and then it's like\nhow do you feel when i say that\nbecause that's a mean thing to say right\nand and yet you feel really because\nhere's the thing\ni think what we're doing is we're\nsitting with that feeling and i'm not\nrejecting you\nbecause what happened is you used to be\nawkward and people used to punish you\nfor it\nand what feels relieving what feels\nheavy is like you know like there's a\npart of you that has been\nbeaten over and over and over again and\nso\nflinches whenever you face these\nfeelings or these thoughts\nand it can feel very relieving when you\nsay something that you used to get\nbeat for and someone doesn't beat you\nlike oh [ __ ]\nhuh\nwhat do you think about that\nthat makes uh perfect sense okay\ncan i think for a second sure\nnow i don't know where to go i feel like\ni blew my load way too early\nbecause usually this happens at the end\nand someone pries oh my god\nokay so it makes perfect sense so i\nthink we've figured something out\nanother question is what we do about it\ndo you have questions by the way\nuh not at all actually like\nyeah definitely\ni hope helps a lot how does it help\nyeah well now i know like basically like\nlet's do a\nfocus on i definitely\ni fix all the inner stuff yep\nhow do you do that\nhow do i do that i mean\nyeah yeah so basically like yeah like\nrebuilt like the foundation on like how\ni\nlike see myself like the stuff like i\ngot taught like back then\ni basically like declutter that yep\nso this is the first thing that i wrote\ni don't know if you can see this can you\nread that\nexternal solution plus internal\nproblems yeah so external solutions to\ninternal problems\nthis is the first thing that i wrote\nthis is your problem\nyou look to dating coaches and websites\nand videos and things like that\nto fix what's inside\nand that's why it doesn't [ __ ] work\nbecause it's just like you're putting\nall of your energy in the opposite\ndirection\nhere's the crazy thing alex i don't\nthink you have a problem talking to\nwomen\nthe even crazier thing is that you agree\ndo you say i used to be shy but i'm not\nanymore i can actually go up and talk to\nwomen\nthe problem is what you show them\nand what you show them is what you are\nand on the surface you can maintain a\nfront for some amount of time but\neventually the scratch beneath the\nsurface\nand they see something rotten on the\ninside\nand this is like this is what the entire\nanyway yeah i think the whole pickup\nartist like approach is like\nbased on this fundamental misnomer and\nthe thing is it works for some people\nright like\nyou get some kinds of outcomes and if\nyou roll the dice enough you're gonna\nget people to like\nhook up with you but my overwhelming\nexperience talking to people who have\ndone all this pickup artist stuff\nis that like one in ten seems to do like\nway better\nbut nine out of ten don't seem to get\nmuch out of it\ni don't know if you would agree or\ndisagree with that\ni think it definitely makes sense yeah\nso like i i think i think this comes\nthis starts alex with like\nif you believe\nthat you're an alien\nwhen you interact with another human\nbeing they're gonna be able to sense\nthat\nespecially women and by especially\nthere's\nactually data that suggests that their\nbrains are somewhat different and don't\noverread into this crap\nby all means but human beings are\nempathic\nand oftentimes men are conditioned to be\nless empathic\nand women are not conditioned in the\nsame way i think a lot of it is\nconditioning\nand so on some level they pick up what\nyou have underneath the surface\nand then something about this entire\nthing sounds super artificial to me\nthe approach\n[Music]\nand it's like you're like it's like a\nbombing one it's like\nyou know and then the girl gives you the\nnumber and then ghosts you it's like\nlike i'd say that what you got to do\nis like have a conversation with someone\ndon't try to get laid just like\ngo out and meet people don't try to pick\nup women\njust meet people and that's what\nterrifies you because like that's what\nyou did when you were in kindergarten\nit's like you tried to just have friends\nand boy did you get burned and so it's\nway\neasier when you stop thinking about them\nas people and start thinking\nabout them as what term do they use\ni can't say that again what term well\nwhat how do they refer to women\nin the circles that you like the target\nlike um yeah that's definitely one of\nthem like sometimes we call them like hb\neight or nine which stands for like hot\nbabe nine\nyeah right so like like here's the thing\nlike you dehumanize them\nbecause then alex the molding\nso you your brain has this idea that\nlike when i interact with humans\nthey treat me like [ __ ]\nand if i don't treat them like humans\nthen that previous programming doesn't\napply here\nit's a whole new ball game does that\nmake sense at all or not so much\nthat definitely makes sense right so\nthen you're playing a game\nit's a game it's not about like me being\na human and them being human\nit's like i'm an avatar of a chad and\nthey are the hp\n8 or 9. and so it's like a story it's\nlike a role play\nand like the cool thing about stories is\nwe get to be\npeople that we're not\nand so it's very appealing what i would\nlove though is if you could just be\nyourself and be okay with that because i\ndon't think you're a [ __ ] up man\nyou're 20 years old you've got plenty of\ntime bro trust me\nokay questions other questions\num not really that yeah definitely uh\ncleared a ton a ton of things up for me\nthanks\nyeah you're very welcome um i'm torn a\nlittle bit between so i've got a couple\nwe've got a couple options one is we\nstill have some time do you want to\ncontinue talking\nyeah definitely okay so here's here are\ntwo or three options one is we can talk\na little bit about practicalities so how\ndoes one go about the process of\ncluttering\nbut i do find myself i kind of like\nderailed you from you know talking about\nthe videos and the pickup artists and\nthe dating coaches\nwhich i think people are curious about\ni'm still curious about those\nso i i mean can we still talk about that\nand that that philosophy and approach\nokay\nso um you said you started talking about\noh you said you started watching lots\nand lots of videos\nso can you tell us about those videos\num yes um i have like a\nton of those programs probably like a\nterabyte\nto be honest like that much um\nif i had to go back to the very first\nprogram i watched\nyeah i was basically like a guy\ninterviewing like a\nbunch of women and then like telling us\nlike how to like\nlike get like that specific grown stuff\nand like there are also like other um\nprograms\nlike when i watched last year it was a\ni guess i focused on mindsets and that\nthey're like these other\ni mean there are a lot of different\nprograms like uh nlp\nprograms are\nyeah those are those are those ones are\nprobably like\nthe creepier ones because they rely on\nyou\nbasically like spitting up these\nso-called language patterns\num which relies on using your like\nhypnotic language like like one of the\nexamples like they used\nlike it like if a girl had like some\nsort of pendant\nlike you go up to her and the guy was\nreally talking for like three minutes\nstraight\nlike like as the opener and it doesn't\nmake any sense like\nlike if i just went up to a random one\nstart talking to her about about like\nher pendant for like three\nconsecutive minutes like she would just\nleave\ni don't know if so they're also like\nwe're also\ni told you i'm saying what did i think\nthat's gonna do\num it's basically you're trying to like\nuse these so-called triggers\nlike these psychological triggers like\nlike use like methods such as like the\num fractionation and stuff\ni just can you explain that to me please\na fractionation\noh man i i forgot like the best\ndefinition for it\nbut i'd say more than like the\nimplementation\nof using in in language it's like\nit's like kind of like a roller coaster\nlanguage like you're saying something\nthat kind of like evokes\nlike negative feelings at first but then\nyou like say something that invokes like\npositive feelings and then\nlike it's it's like not just a straight\nline because\nbecause women supposedly find just the\nsame emotion repeatedly like being\na boring thing but if you have like\nthese mixed feelings it makes you sound\nmore interesting\nthat's so i mean those were i mean those\nare the most technical ones but they're\nalso like books\num i'm just like trying to just give you\nlike a quick summary of like\nyeah i appreciate that like i think it's\nit's pretty it's really helpful alex\nthank you\nso are you mentioned books\num yeah there are like a ton of books as\nwell\nany any kind of takeaways from the book\ncan you help me understand what kind of\nstuff they talk about or what they cover\ni mean the books\ni mean like a book in a program can like\nkind of\nteach the same thing mindset wise i\nguess\ni feel like a pro the advantage with\nlike video programs that can\nlike you know hear people like like\ngiving examples like\nthey're like saying the actual things we\nalso have this thing called like\ninfield like video footage where like\nyou're seeing\nbasically the mentor like like applying\nto the\nso-called uh principles like\nlike into real life basically who's we\nsaid we have this thing called infield\nvideo footage who's we\noh yeah that pick up yeah community\nokay can you tell me about that\ncommunity\ni mean i mean i mean obviously the good\nthing is about that we're like just here\nto improve ourselves like really\ni mean the only for the most part the\nmost negative thing is\nobviously bad advice like what the most\ncommon\none the most common advice i see that's\nlike pretty bad is just\nat least i realize that even more right\nnow is definitely they always say oh no\nyou just have to approach\nlike just have to like keep approaching\nlike thousands\nof women like there's like there's this\none a giant company that advocates like\nlike you have to approach like at least\na thousand girls in order to like get\ndecent\nokay i mean that that makes sense no\npractice makes perfect\ni mean it does but it didn't really work\nfor me\nyou've approached a thousand women\ni've i've approached uh 300\nholy [ __ ] dude that's a lot\nthat's got to be yeah tough\nto get rejected 300 times\nsomething i mean yeah i mean i was\nespecially like\ni mean i was definitely uh pretty\nnervous like doing it at first\nbut then you kind of like just get used\nto it\nlike you get desensitized basically yeah\nyou seem like a desensitized kind of\ndude\nwhat do you think about that\ncan i share with you why i think you're\ngetting\nwhy i think you're doing that it's\nactually kind of wondering that\nyep um so i think a lot of times\nyou can't describe what you're feeling\nbut when i put words to it you can say\nyeah that's it\nright so that suggests to me that like\nyou've\nyou just don't quite know like you sort\nof can face the feeling but you don't\nreally have like\nyou're it's almost like you're\ncolorblind when it comes to looking\nwithin yourself\nwhich is what i think gov is someone\nwho's desensitized but with\na little bit of help you can learn what\nit is that you're feeling\nand the interesting thing is that so\nthat then that begs the question how do\ni know what you're feeling\nif you don't know what you're feeling\nhow do i know what you're feeling and\nthat turns out that just like women\nyou actually signal a lot more stuff\nthan you realize\nand if you've got a good receiver on the\nother end i see the color inside you\nyou just don't skin but you're still\ngiving it off because it's not like i'm\npsychic or something right\nyou're actually giving it off quite\nstrongly so like you tell a story\nlike that story about the cafeteria was\nbeautiful i mean it's a terrible story\nlike awful to listen to but it was\nbeautiful in terms of like there's\nso much color and meaning and feeling\nin that story\ni'm sorry did you want to jump in i\nwasn't quite sure\ni know i was just listening to you but\nyeah that i feel like\nmakes a perfect sense yeah\num okay so so there there are\nvideos coaches the pickup artist\ncommunity and so when did you start\ncoaching when i started coaching\nthat was and my first coach was um\nsenior year in high school okay and how\ndid you decide to\nseek out a coach\ni definitely dissatisfaction with where\ni currently have meds\ndissatisfaction meaning what\nwhat were you dissatisfied with i was\njust satisfied that\nyou know i wasn't like i couldn't\nsocialize i\nwas also like also dissatisfied with the\nfact that i\ncouldn't get any women or they're\nparticular so you know\noh yeah definitely were you in love\ni know i definitely had a uh huge\ncase of uh like one nitis with this girl\nfor like\nlike at least four years but what\nconstitutes being in love like\ni'm not really sure what that means what\nis\nalso kind of like\nit's basically where yeah there's like\nthis one girl like\ni mean i guess in your terms like you\ncould call like being in love but i\ndon't know it's like\nbasically you're only focused on like\none woman pretty much\nwhen you say your terms who is the you\ni just meant like like you said like was\ni in love\nlike i don't really know what kazu was\nbeing loved like maybe i\njust had a huge crush on her but one\nnidus\nit basically plays like you're\noverthinking about this\none girl for like way too long i think\nthat's probably like\nlike the better definition for it do you\nknow what the\nthe suffix itis means\nitis means like inflammation yeah\nits interesting right so what we\ncall love you call a disease\noh that's right\nso like uveitis is like\ninflammation of the uvea rhinitis\nallergic rhinitis do you know what\nallergic rhinitis means\ninflammation of\nlike like an allergic reaction yep it\nmeans allergies\nit's the colloquial problem right\nso rhinitis means nose so when you have\nlike seasonal allergies as your nose is\nstopped up\nwe develop our own terminology to\nseparate ourselves from the rest of\nsociety and we call it allergic rhinitis\nand we feel smarter than everyone else\nby doing so\nbut i think i never appreciated until\nthis moment that\nwhat some society calls love it sounds\nlike the pickup artist\ncommunity treats like a disease\nso what is so what i just sounds like a\nbad thing\nlike in the pickup artist community how\ndo they describe one itis what do they\nsay about it\nand i'm not saying like the pickup bars\ncommunity is bad or anything like\nlike like it's like we're going to sense\nthat we are like out here to improve\nourselves but yeah yeah but when idiots\nin particular\nowen itis\ni guess like we have like these red uh\npillish like views like on women like we\num like if we focus on one girl\ni guess another things could be bad like\nnumber one\num yeah we should number one like we\nshould have in a\nwe should have like an abundance of\nwomen\nto talk about like there's like always a\nlot more women\nand number two like i guess at least in\nmy perspective if you're like\nlike always focus on one woman if you're\nlike extremely nervous\nlike maybe you'd be like less likely to\nget her or something\nokay i mean i guess like one night is\nbasically like limits\nlike you're\nlike it basically limits you because\nthere's like\na ton of other women in the sea so i'd\nsay that's basically why the reason why\nit's a bad thing because\nlike you should have abundance and you\nshould\ni know your options like if a girl\ndoesn't you know like you then\ni mean you should learn to deal with\nthat and\nhaving one nightis i guess could be like\nlike you're not like you're still too\nattached to her basically like\njust don't become attached to one person\nbut what if i\ni really like her though\ni feel like\ni mean if you really like her yeah\nbasically\ni try to like interact with her but if\nit doesn't work out though\ni mean bad thing with keeping the one\nnice like\nit's gonna be too attached it's gonna\nlike prevent you from seeing the other\noptions\ni i think that attachment leading to\nsuffering is not something that\nis new right so there's\npotentially the original if we say that\nthat's a hallmark of the red pill\ncommunity\nyou know who is the founder of the red\npill community\nwho also preached that attachment leads\nto suffering\nyou should let go of attachment\nany idea\nthere's this guy named buddha\nbuddha he agrees for what that's worth i\ndon't know if he'd like agree with the\nrest of it but\nthe general principle that being overly\nattached to something\nis what causes suffering is like\nsomething that he's been saying for a\ncouple thousand years\num okay so so it sounds like you\nhad one itis for a girl how do you what\ndo you think about that now\nhonestly i feel like i was a little\ncreepy for\nliking her because i barely even\ninteracted her\nlike i like i did\ni mean like technically i did but\ni don't know it it just is what feels\ncreepy about that\nlike i i know it's like like usually\nyou're supposed to like someone if\nyou've like talked to them\nlike for quite a bit i mean obviously\ndoctor i mean like at least a little bit\nbut\nyeah yeah so\num alex i think that's actually a really\nimportant point do you mind if i ask you\na few more questions about that just to\nillustrate a couple of things\nsure so help me understand like\nyou know if you haven't interacted with\nher much and and\nyou know what did you think about her\nand where did those thoughts come from\nbecause your situation is not unique\nright\nlike i myself caught one itis for\nsomeone when i was\n16 years old and saw this person\nonce and like i still remember the\nmoment that i saw her which was that i\nwas walking by a picnic table\nand she was walking in the opposite\ndirection with one of our friends\nand i remember feeling like i got\npunched in the chest by like an elephant\nand i still remember that moment i\ncaught some really bad one-itis\nthat's the best way i can describe it\nand so how how does that happen\nwhat happens like what did you think\nabout her and what is that one night is\nbased on\ni mean i mean i guess i like\nkind of like notice like things about\nher\ni mean i mean that like personality wise\ni mean i also thought she was very\nbeautiful but yeah\nlike you know she just like kind of\nseemed\nlike she'd be like my type or something\nwhat was it about\ni mean i guess there's like one thing\nabout personality can't really\ni mean kind of hard to describe to be\nhonest\nwhich i mean she was also like very\nsweet\nhow did you know she was sweet\nit's just like something to pick up on\nyou know\nexplain that to me how do you pick up on\nit\num and it's like\nkinda hard to describe\nwhat does it feel like thinking about\nher and talking about her\ni guess it feels kind of what feels good\nabout it\ni'm not sure okay\ni i wonder if it can just feel good to\nacknowledge what you have on the inside\ndoes that make sense like just calling\nit what it is\nnot saying it's good not saying it's bad\nbut i i notice you know your face is\nchanging a little bit like you like when\nyou talk about her like you start to\ngrin\nthis yeah it is\nyeah um do you feel the what is coming\nback\nas we talk about her\ni mean maybe like a tiny bit but\nbecause you did say that you had it for\nfour years so it sounds like you're over\nit now\ni mean yeah i'd say so yeah\nand so you said red pill can you tell us\nwhat that means\ni mean i mean i guess it's\ni wish i'd use like red pillow described\ngod use it to like describe what it is\ni mean i kind of think that's where it\ncomes from like just like a\nway of thinking i'm i'm not really\nthat much identified with like different\npills\nokay and\nbut can you explain the general concept\nbehind red pill\ni think i think blue pill is just like\nis it blue pose just like what everyone\nelse is\num a red pill would probably come like a\nsimp or something\ni guess okay a red pill\ncould be identified with the guys\nlike or you know like actively trying\nnot to get women\nand then the black pill are just the\nguys like completely given up\nokay so so red pillars don't try to get\nwomen\ni said they i said they do oh they do\nand blue pills\ndo try to get women or don't try to get\nwomen\ni mean okay blue pill i say\num believing like this uh like courting\nlike courting stuff like you have to\nlike quote a woman like\ntake her out on like three dates before\nlike you can even\nyou know do stuff with her\nyeah okay so so if you're in love you're\na blue pillar\nand if you have one itis you're a red\npillar\ni mean probably okay thanks for\nclarifying i'm not i'm not i'm not the\nmost familiar with it\nwith the pills but i think that's very\ngeneral concepts\nokay so it sounds like you're more\nfamiliar with the pickup artist\nscene\num yeah definitely okay so how did you\nfind\na coach\nyeah definitely um that first one\ndefinitely uh online\nepis i taught me to go like coach by\ncoach\nlike i had seven like different coaches\nyep so let's talk about the first one\nwhat was how did you find them and what\ndid they teach you\nokay well the first one uh believe it or\nnot\num that one was a girl\na girl dating coach uh the other six\nweren't but\nit's what she taught me like i mean\ndon't get me wrong like she was very\nnice like she tried to help\noh yeah how i found i found her like\nthis kind of websites\nit's like you submit your form and then\nlike don't get you wrong she was trying\nto help what does that\nmean i mean she was trying to help with\nstuff she taught was like\nlike you know this is what a question is\nthis is what a statement is like\nlike stuff that's like everyone like\nalready knows\nokay\ntrying to teach like like basically\ncommon sense\nlike okay so it sounds like it wasn't\nthat helpful\ni don't a second one\nthat basically um found the same way but\nit was uh\nbasically like how's it\nokay so the last one like it was like a\nsmall company that had like different\ndating coach they just assigned me to\none\ndating coach the second one it was just\nthe guy owned his own website so it's\nbasically like justin\nand what he did was that he made me keep\nlike this um\na journal to like record my interactions\nthen i would basically discuss it with\nhim\nlike on skype and actually take me\nsome pretty interesting advice to be\nhonest\ncan you give us an example of\ninteresting advice\ni can recall one of them like uh\nrecalling like uh telling stories\nlike he gave me like this metaphor\nof like a newspaper you've got like the\narticle the headline\nlike i like i basically um when i'm\ntalking to the girl like i you know i\nsay like\nlike the interesting line to like kind\nof spark or interest i go into explain\nit and the problem i just did\nwas i would just say oh hey i did this\nand i did this\nand basically i would only it would only\nlast like like two or three senses but\nbasically did it like you know we got\nthe\nart article um you know to grab your\nattention they got\nyou know actually telling like a real\nstory basically\nokay okay the third one the third one\noh my god that one was the most\nuh expensive one yeah\nit was uh three thousand dollars for\nthat one it was a basically\na uh three month coaching program\nand they did it like i did get\nindividual\nindividualized coaching uh by the main\ncoach\nbut it was also like in a group-like\nsetting\nwhere like we interacted on this\nplatform with\nactually all these other students like\ndoing the coaching program\nand another interesting thing was that\nwe had these missions\nwhere an example of mission would be it\ncould be related to getting women like\nget a phone number from a girl or\num ask a girl to help\npick clothes for you or something uh go\non an incident with a girl is another\none\nwe also had like more confidence-based\nones such as\nlike breakdance in public\nyes i was so i basically like asked\nsomeone to record me like\nbreak dancing in the mall i mean dude\nyeah that's cool man\nyeah i mean i mean it definitely did\nhelp with confidence\ni literally it was just like all of\nthese\ni was really like that's [ __ ] awesome\nbro you know how to break\nit yeah\nthat's really cool anyway keep going so\nthis is the 30 000 of them\nto help some with confidence yeah that\nyeah that program cost me three thousand\ndollars that was the most expensive one\ni mean a lot of other things like advice\nwould just give out was honestly\nstuff i already knew from youtube like\ntake cold showers\nand stuff how does that help and\num i mean i guess it could like\nstrengthen your will a little\nwhen i say well i don't mean like low\npower but\njust like enduring i guess it could be\nlike\nsimilar to approaching like like it\ncould compare to like jumping in the\npool but also you have this\na thing where like we um\nlike you did like individualized\nsessions but i also kind of had like\ngroup online sessions like um like we\ndid a video chat on skype where\nlike there was a segment where like the\nmain coach actually brought his girl out\nto interact with her\nand yeah i would basically get like one\nor two minutes on the timer to\nlike try to start a conversation with\nher like talk to her\nyeah basically more like observational\notherwise but what made me\nlike very mad though was that i was\nliterally on my last group session\nand i i could barely even like hold a\nconversation for like\n10 seconds and the guy was like oh my\ngod\nlike you dude so awesome alex like did\nso well and that was like literally\nafter like three months\nlike like i know it's i know\nlike i know he was like trying to be\nnice to me and stuff but like he also\nit just wasn't very honest you know\nlike i was still obviously struggling a\nlot\nand i know and the biggest thing i got\nfrom that program is i\nof course i gained a lot of confidence\nbut i kind of you know expected a lot\nmore\nand then hold on a second what made you\ni know that\ni mean like feels like kind of\ni mean like i literally it was like\nmy last my very last session like after\nthree months\nlike i like skill wise i didn't really\nimprove that much\nand he and like he saw that like i could\nlike i was doing so pathetic like trying\nto talk to\nyou know this girl on the video tracks\nand\nkiss girl\nyeah to simulate the approach but like\nhe was it was like kind of like\nlike being fake you know like and and\nafter that's\nlike after the chat he was like trying\nto like get me on a sale to pay\nthousands of more dollars to continuous\ncoach and i was like no\nhow did that make you feel\nyeah very mad what were you mad at\ni kind of like i kind of like expecting\nmore you know\ni think it's more than that\ni think you felt like maybe you got\ntaken advantage of\nit's interesting so if i can point\nsomething out to you\nthis is the first time in an hour and\n25 minutes or so that you've used\na word that describes an emotion\nis that's true i maybe i missed one\nearlier\nbut usually when i when i ask you about\nemotions or when we talk about emotions\nyour answer is i don't know and then if\ni help you out some you can you'll say\nyeah that's what it feels like\nbut man like you i like go back and\nwatch the vod dude like you can see it\nin your face\nlike something he said the next one\nthree thousand dollars like we knew\nsomething was wrong and what you it\nsounds like you\nlike he was trying to squeeze you for\nmore money is that what it felt like\nlike he's giving you all this false\npraise and then be like oh yeah like\nyou're doing great like all you need\nis three more months of coaching just a\nfew thousand dollars more and you're\ngoing to get to where you want to go bro\nyou're on the right path\nnow alex you mind if i ask like so so\nlike when you worked with let's say the\nfourth coach or the fifth\ncoach or the sixth coach or the seventh\ncoach did you ever tell them by the way\ni've\nworked with four coaches before and i\nhaven't really gotten anywhere\ni i did and what how did they respond to\nthat\nthe one after the third coach he was\nlike yeah man i\nam the real dude and and the guy after\nthat\nit was like it was like okay yeah\num well that oh that's okay let's\nand i guess they weren't like too\nso as many of them weren't like too\nsurprised really to be honest\nsorry i don't mean to laugh but if\nthey're not too surprised does that mean\nthat like\nthat happens a lot where like clients\ncome to them and say hey i've worked\nwith a bunch of coaches\nand nothing has worked and they're like\nno big deal man\ni'm the real dude\ni mean yeah yeah the next guy had a\nreally had an extremely big ego\nokay sorry do you feel am i do you feel\nlike ashamed or anything if i laugh\ndude no no not at all okay i'm just i'm\nsurprised by the absurdity of this whole\nsystem which thank you very much by the\nway for explaining some of the stuff and\nshedding some light on it but i'm just\ncurious because it's like you know what\ndoes the fifth dude say when you're like\nhey i worked with four people\nand he's like yeah give me that money\ni'm different anyway sorry\nokay so you were saying like so what was\nyeah\ni mean that was how all of them\nresponded like like some of them were\nobviously a lot nicer than that\nbut that but but that reaction\ndefinitely applied to the next one like\nhe was\nlike very awful how so what does that\nmean\nyeah you yeah dude that he was like very\nlike verbally\nabusive and he would like get mad at you\nlike like over like the dumbest\nlike stuff like stuff that like doesn't\neven matter and also\nlike i literally had like like three\nsessions left and\nand he was like we're done coaching and\nhe literally\njust canceled our coaching without a\nrefund and why did he cancel our\ncoaching like he literally\nlike accused me of um interacting with\nlike a third party like i was like some\nsort of\nsecret agent and um i actually i had a\ncoach who did\ni had a coach later who did a coaching\nstrategy with him\nhe also like i did this product with him\nso like he's known him\nlike he used to be best friends with him\nbut he was like yeah dude like\nthat guy is probably like that dude is\nschizophrenic\nlike like he was like extremely the\nfourth coach was just like extremely\ninsecure and paranoid and\ni wonder what the qualifications to\nbecome a dating co-chart\ninteresting okay yeah i'm sorry that\nhappened to you i mean\ni really i mean yeah like really\nobsessed me like to this day\nwhat upsets you about it\nwell part of it is that he actually does\nhave a few like very good testimonials\nand like i'd listen to them and\nlike it could like hear from the way\nthey come across like they've\nlike actually become like very good and\ncharismatic\nand i've actually found out like months\nafter taking the coach\nthat there were other guys who had like\nplenty of other guys there like\nhad the exact same experience as me\nthe gulf of reddit but yeah i just\nlike i just didn't know how to like like\ndeal like deal with it\nto deal with him it doesn't sound like\nmany people do\nsounds like a hard guy to deal with\nmaybe another one of those situations\nwhere maybe he's got internal problems\nthat he's dealing with externally\nby yelling at people who give him money\nfor coaching\nso that was he was coach number five\nford\nfour what about five six and seven any\nanything stand out there\nnumber five i mean it was actually\ngenerally a nice guy\ni mean he wasn't surprised but not in\nlike my cocky way like yeah i am the\nreal dude\nlike um that guy\nlike i did like he did a coaching pay by\nmy month\nso it wasn't like an entire like three\nmonth package\nand like like his style was like a lot\nmore um\ntechnical stuff like he made me do like\na lot of writing\npretty nice dude but uh by the time the\nsummer hits\nand i just um i couldn't afford it\nanymore\nand some time has passed i have found\nthis\nother coach who uh yeah he was the one\nwho\nactually did the coaching our tradex\nwith the other guy we did a program with\nhim it was like best friends with\nthe fourth guy and yeah he was\na pretty good dude\nand i've also um another one like after\nthat\nuh his main focus was on mindsets\nand stuff it's also more um\nit does individualize sessions but it\nalso kind of like doesn't like a group\nbased\nuh cyanozole but without learning\nso so alex let me ask you something if\nsomeone is like\nstruggling to find so let's\nyou you have a fair amount of experience\nhow you feel\nyou okay i feel pretty good\nokay okay i've been holding this i've\nbeen holding this stapler\nto the to the do you want to switch\nhands\ndon't know i feel i think i feel okay\ntalk about willpower\nhold the stapler in your headphone jack\nfor like an hour and a half\num so let me ask you a couple questions\nso let's say like so you've been through\nthis stuff for a while so let's say that\ni'm a 17 year old guy in high school\nwho feels like an alien amongst my peers\nand doesn't know how to talk to girls\nwhat would you recommend to me\nyeah definitely uh focus on the inner\nissues\nlike especially good place to look like\nlike in my situation was like what\nhappened to me in my\nchildhood like um\ni'm confused so you're telling me that\nthat what we talked about like an\nhour ago is like what you're gonna share\nwith them you're not gonna share with\nthem anything that you've learned from\nlike\nseven dating coaches\nare you just playing nice or do you\nactually think that\ni say that again so i'm confused because\nlike you you seem to be talking about\nin my perception what we talked about\nbut do you actually think that that's\nthe answer i was expecting you to say\nsomething relating to like\nwhat you learned from like seven dating\ncoaches\nbut that's not the answer that i'm\nhearing unless you learn that from them\nas well\ni was trying to like tell you like the\nanswer like what i learned from you\nbut do you think that that's the best\nadvice for the 17 year old not what\nyou've learned from the dating coaches\nor your advice don't worry i mean i'm\ndon't pick the thing just because i said\nit i'm genuinely curious like what would\nyou offer them\nand if it is look at yourself then\nthat's cool\ni mean it's not just look at yourself\nlike i just\nyeah okay so what i learned from the\nseven gaming coaches\nis like yeah definitely like be very\ncareful for like what you pay for\nlike i'd say um like a few stuff out\nthere is honestly pretty valuable\nlike one of them uh was like free\nassociation like it had\nhelps you like practice your verbal\nskills and stuff\ni'm just saying like don't yeah i get\ndefinitely like what you taught me\nlike an hour ago like definitely do that\nfirst\nbut yeah you can also like yeah do the\nother things i learned from day coach\nlike\nyeah the free association stuff\ni mean yeah they're i mean few obvious\nthings like they taught like you know\ndress well\nyeah so so it seems like there are there\nare some practical things that you'd\nshare with them\nyeah yeah definitely like there's yeah\ndefinitely\nsome practical things but also like\nobviously the mental stuff\nyeah cool man\num anything that we sort of didn't\ncover today that you wanted to talk\nabout or\nany questions for me\nany questions for you\ni don't know well i got like\nit's yeah i mean i'm not trying to\nartificially shut things down i just\nwant to make sure that\nwe do have time because i i know i've\nkind of been steering\nand i want to give you a chance if you\ndo want to share anything\ni'm getting the sense that's sort of\nlike talking about the remainders of the\ndetails of the dating coaches feels kind\nof redundant to me\nis there something from those that you\nwant to share\nlike i mean like can you like be more\nspecific though\nyeah so so um you know i'm\ni'm let me put it this way like it\nsounds like there are a couple of\nimportant experiences but i felt like we\nsort of got those from you\nin terms of dating coaching is there\nsomething else that you feel like is\nimportant to share or lessons that you\nlearn from dating coaching\nokay let me think oh yeah oh yeah\ndefinitely\none of them is uh know what you want\nokay like it could be like a bunch of\nthings like\nyou want a relationship do you\nthroughout the month\njust want to um\nlike gain some experience at first and\nuh don't be afraid to uh communicate\nthat\nand another thing i guess about mindset\nis um\nlike do not uh seek for your approval\nand um\nit's pretty good stuff don't be uh also\ndon't be outcome dependents agree with\nall three of those things\nbut but i have a slightly different\ntwist on them can i share that with you\nalex\nall right so like the first thing is if\nwe're talking about not being outcome\ndependent\nthat sort of clashes with the idea of\nlike getting laid in the approach\nright because it's all about outcomes\nyou're targeting you're not sitting with\nanother human being and just seeing like\nwhere this goes\nit's like i'mma try to get laid that's\nan outcome\ndoes that make sense it is so so i i\nthink there's some\ni hear that's okay um\nthere's something really i think uh\ni think you're closing yourself off by\nlike\napproaching 300 women instead of just\nlike\nbeing you and i think that that's scary\nto you because like\nyou learned a long time ago that being\nyou is not something that's\nthat people like you can switch hands\nyou can let go of the stapler and just\nmute yourself if you want is that easier\nand take a break i want you to hand\ncramp\nokay i'm doing a different way now feels\ngood okay okay\nbut i i mean if if i had to give you\nsome kind of advice alex which i try to\navoid\nat all costs um it would say just like\njust\nbe with people like don't worry so much\nabout like the dating and stuff like\nthat\nunless you have one itis in which case\ni'd say go for it bro\nand honestly like like i\ni know i mean i i know that one is can\nget you into trouble and i do think that\nthere's a lot to be said for sort of\nbecause you said that you didn't\ninteract with this girl much but we can\nsort of form\nfantasies of people in our mind\nand i do think that that's a problem\nright\nthat's not actually who the person is\nit's just the fantasy that you build in\nyour mind\nand i think it's really interesting how\nquickly that happens and how hard it is\nto realize that this is not a real\nperson that i'm falling in love with\nthis is my idea of a person she would be\nlike this and it would be like this\nand it would be like this but at the\nsame time bro\ndon't give up on love because like\ni mean you know i think if you look at\nstories throughout the history of\nhumanity\nlike one itis is pretty [ __ ] epic man\ndo i think it's damaging do i think\npeople get obsessive is it problematic\ndoes it help you not grow absolutely\ni don't think that you should sacrifice\nyourself\nfor the sake of someone that you have\none itis for\nand at the same time like don't give up\nman\ni'd say with this particular girl if you\nrun across her again and like\ntry to have a conversation with her and\nlike maybe ask her out\ni'm not trying to like throw you back\ninto the throes of juanitas but\nyou know if if life gives you a chance\ni'd say take a shot man\nand in the meantime just try to be human\ni don't think\ni i i recognize that you have a feeling\ninside you that\nyou are an alien amongst humans i don't\nthink you're as much of an alien as you\nyou feel you are deep down inside i know\nyou\nknow you're not but that feeling is\nthere and recognize that that's just a\nfeeling\nit's like a hold over it's a scar\nfrom what happened to you when you were\nyounger and we have scars from the past\nbut they're not\nactually like the same wounds right they\nheal and they leave a mark but like\nyou're actually a pretty cool guy\nand it's like i mean you're just kind of\na chat if you know how to break dance\nand you've got eight thousand dollars\nlying around for dating coaching like i\nthink you're actually in a pretty good\nspot\nyou know and so the last thing that i'd\nsay alex is like like\ngive people the gift of who you are\nlet them get to know you and\nand if they don't like what they see\nthat's that's up to them\nbut right now what i see is that you try\nto be someone that you're not\nyou try to advertise yourself as is\nsomeone that you're not\nyou try to advertise yourself based on\nwhat a lot of other people have told you\nhey here's how you advertise yourself\nbut here's the thing about this whole\nlike pickup artist methodology\nwhen you try something on 300 women it\ndoesn't work\ni'm really confused as a scientist how\nyou think that's an effective method\nright and if all of these people are\nsaying hey you got to do this with a\nthousand women before you get the hang\nof it like what\nmaybe you're doing it wrong you know\nit's like\nhey man like you gotta cook like a\nthousand\nbowls of pasta before it's out of it's\nlike hold on a second man\nmaybe you should try cooking it in water\ninstead of sticking gets straight into a\ndry pot like maybe you're doing\nsomething wrong\nand what i found works alex\nand and maybe this is arrogant for me to\nsay is just be yourself\nand then like let them decide right like\nbecause\nwomen are the deciders in the sexual\nmarketplace\nso advertise your wares and let them\npick don't be someone that you're not\nand don't try to be something that\nyou think you should be\nlike if you want to grow as a human\nbeing grow as a human being and and like\nthe\nwomen who are interested in that will\nshow up and those are probably the ones\nthat you want you don't want a relation\nuh\nthis also presumes that you want a\nrelationship but i think relationships\nbuilt on false pretenses don't end up\nwell\nyou've shown me enough that that makes\nme think that there's something there\nthat's like\nworth you know something within you\nthat's worth something i think there's\ngold\nthere's like gold on the outside\nlead in the middle and then gold\nunderneath\nand so just get to that part like just\nbe who you are man because you seem like\na resilient\ndriven you know like thoughtful guy\nwho knows how to break dance and has a\npretty sweet place\nyour place looks pretty cool man oh\nthanks man\nany last thoughts or questions before we\nwrap up or switch to meditation\num no questions but yeah i definitely\nwould like to thank you uh for the help\nsure when do i get my chat yeah i\ncovered\nhow much how much should i charge for my\nthis service\ni'm trolling media yeah i'm glad you\nfound it useful\num do you do you feel like meditating\num sure okay do you have any experience\nwith meditation\ni mean i do it like like an hour over an\nhour a day\noh wow do you want to tell us what you\ndo\nlook at this chad thundercock right here\nlike what i do with a meditation yeah\nyou want to teach us\nyeah basically what i do is i like um\nfirst i uh\nobserve my thoughts for like uh 40\nminutes and then i go into like\na uh like a visualization related\npractice\nand also some days like like after i do\nthat meditation\ni go um do this other\nlike hypnosis related thing\nright before bed okay\nlet me think about what i want to teach\nyou so basically what my focus is is i\ni really just do it to like help gain\nmore reports like\nmy subconscious mind\nwould okay what does that mean rapport\nwith your subconscious mind\n[Music]\nand i don't really meditate like just\nlike stop thinking just like\njust like become more aware of like\nfewer parts of yourself like you get a\nthought like like you just watch it like\ni've also\nalso like listened to a lot of like uh\neckhart tolle\nthat cartel was good yep so yeah\nstuff like that okay so let me think\nabout what do we want to teach you\nokay let me ask you a question so i see\nthat you have a mirror\nin by your bed do you have a portable\nmirror\nokay so i i've got a good idea so for\nthose of y'all at home if you guys have\na phone a camera or a mirror\nso you you see my face\nright uh\nalex you see my face oh yeah yeah okay\nso this is what i want you to do okay so\ni want you guys to get your phone ready\nwhat we're gonna do is just look at\nourselves\nand just watch what happens when you see\nyourself\nokay so i want you to look for i'm going\nto ask you\nin a second do you see a big version of\nyourself don't do it yet\nso what i want you to notice alex is\nthat there's going to be\na reaction and just try to find it\nso now make yourself bigger can you do\nthat can you see yourself\ni can like see my face yeah so so like\nmake like maximize it\nor like you know look in a cell phone\ncamera or something like yeah right\nand maximize the screen yeah so can you\nsee like a big version of your face\nyeah speaker okay so just look at it\nand tell me what you see\nyou don't have to tell me just just\nnotice what you see\ni try to find that cringe when you look\nat yourself\nand notice okay so just notice that\nwhere does that come from\nyou don't have to answer just notice\nwithin yourself where does this arise\nso what literally you're doing is your\neyes are just seeing a picture of a\nperson\nthat's all that it is there's no cringe\nso now what i want you to do is notice\nthe physical form\nand try to separate the physical form\nfrom\nyour judgment\nthere's eyes there's a nose there's\nheadphones\nthere's a blue shirt a hoodie\nthat's what you see but your mind\nadds something on to that there's a\nreaction\nto the physical form that you see does\nthat make sense\nwhere does that reaction come from\ndo you have any idea you can answer if\nyou have a sense\nwhere does the feeling of cringe come\nfrom\nand i kind of like feel it's um like\nbubbling up from like\nsomewhere else yep that makes any sense\nit makes a lot of sense\nso try to track it to its source where\ndo you feel it bubbling up from\nclose your eyes\nwhere is that sense coming from\nall right you said all right\nwhat did you notice\nlike i like kind of like became the\nobserver then\nlike i like i noticed like the uh\nthought\nform or like the feeling just like\nappearing there i like watch it\nso where does it appear from\ni'm not sure like answer that like just\nlike i don't know where\ngood does it come from somewhere\ni'm not sure okay good\nokay alex open your\neyes take away number one\ncan you see me come back\nokay so take away number one\nfirst thing that you've got to\nunderstand the feeling of cringe\ndoes not come from your appearance it\ndoesn't come\nfrom the thing that you see does that\nmake sense\nyes ergo this is something i want you to\nunderstand because i don't think you\nreally get this yet you have to feel it\nin the moment\nwhen someone sees you they don't get\nsomething that bubbles up\nthe bubbling up is coming from you it's\nnot coming from your face\nit's not an objective fact it's a\nsubjective feeling\nonce you understand this it's going to\ntransform your interactions with women\nand other people they can't see\nthey can't feel the cringe\nbecause it bubbles up from somewhere\nelse that they can't they literally\ncannot see\nit does not come from your indriyas or\nyour sense organs\nit doesn't come from your eyes\nit comes from somewhere within you\nso like what you show them\nis what they'll react to and then the\nsecond thing is does it come from\nanywhere at all does it truly have a\nfoundation\nthat's the second question that you need\nto answer\nif you can find a foundation then you\ncan work on it\nmore bizarrely if it comes from nowhere\nand is sort of completely random and is\nbasically an\necho in your mind\nof a time long past why do you let it\ninform\nyour identity of who you are today\nso either it comes from somewhere or it\ndoesn't these are the questions that you\nneed to answer\nand if you do i think i think your luck\nwith women will change\noh definitely okay\ngood luck man thanks for thanks for\nholding the uh\nthe staple for so long\noh yeah thanks thank you for uh like all\nthe advice\nyeah man good luck seriously man i wish\nyou all the best\nall right bye bye\nyou"
