    "transcript": "cool cool man so\ni see you have a shirt that says your\nname on i mean sorry uh\na hat yeah simple my mom made it i got a\ni went bald recently for content and um\nit was not a very good look so i'm a hat\nguy now\nyou went bald for content what does that\nmean\ni was doing uh marbles do you know what\nmarbles is\nnope it's like this thing where you can\nhave\nsome random marble win it's just\ncompletely luck based\nand one of the marbles was give myself a\nhaircut it was getting out of hand\nquarantine and um i tried to do a\nhaircut\ni did but it was going really bad so i\nwas like i'm gonna just cut it all off\nso i ended up going bald it wasn't good\nso it wasn't molding no i wasn't malden\ni was probably kind of mauled in by the\nend of it because then i was bald\nbut cool it wasn't yeah and do you\nnormally do your speed runs without a\nshirt on\nah yeah people were asking if you were\ngoing to have a shirt and i\ni got a little bit scared\nbecause i don't really know what i'm\ngetting myself into before i interview\nsomeone\nyeah but uh it just kind of became a\nmeme\ni had like this reward i might on my\nchannel where you could have me take my\nshirt off and then another reward where\nyou can have me put it back on people\nwould always just take it off so i was\njust off a lot\nand yeah it just happened while i had\nworld record and now everyone thinks i'm\njust never wear a shirt\ncool well i'm i mean i i feel a little\nbit more comfortable with you wearing\nyour shirt today\ni'm glad you're also wearing a shirt yep\nand uh\nyou know i don't know about you but i'm\nnaked from the from below the waist\nyeah because that's always that's the\nadvantage of\ncoving and you gotta let them breathe\ngot a lot of breathing\num and so you're uh you're a speed\nrunner for mario 64.\nyeah one of my favorite games of all\ntime\nit's a good game they they knocked it\nout of the park\nyeah they really did any um and so\nhow i mean help me understand like when\nyou're a speed runner for a game like\nis that something that you do on a daily\nbasis or yeah\nyeah so it's basically a grind like for\nmonths at a time i mean i\nstarted playing you take a lot of breaks\nlike i've gotten a lot of burnout but i\nstarted playing the game in 2012\non and off since then so for the past\neight years and\nfor the past it's been about nine months\nnow\nnine ten months i've been pretty much\nplaying it almost every day\nand just trying to lower my time and\nlike a typical stream is just\nrestarting over and over for like\nupwards of six eight hours and just\ntrying to beat your best run\ninteresting and what is the record\ni currently hold the record with 138 28\nof doing\nall the stars but there's different\ncategories there's like beat the game\nwith no stars beat the game with like 16\nstars\nso there's different categories some of\nthem are like memes that people don't\nreally care that much about and then\nsome of them are like\nvery competitive a lot of people run\nthem and are trying to get the record\ncool so you hold the record for 120\nstars and\nand mario 64. yeah shortest amount wow\nyeah one hour and 38 minutes\nand 28 seconds wow that's crazy\nit's pretty fast yeah i mean i can't\neven imagine\ni've seen some speed runs of of mario 64\nwhere they like bug the game out\nis that like common or\nyeah that's more common for the shorter\ncategories but for 120 star there's\nactually not that much\nlike glitching that you do there's a\ncouple things here and there but most of\nit's just\nmoving really fast like the mechanics of\nthe game are really good\nso it's mostly just legit just moving\nquick\ncool and and when do you decide when\nyou're done\nhow do you figure that out when you're\ndone as in like when to restart\nno like when you're done with this\nendeavor in your life\nthat's i mean that's kind of where i'm\nat right now because like the goal for\nthe past eight years was\nget the world record it was like it was\nkind of haunted me for a while\ni was like because i got very close to\ngetting the record multiple times in the\npast i\ni was like number three or number four\nand i was able to get the record but i'd\nnever sealed the deal\nand it was only until recently that i\ngot it for the first time and that was\nlike my that felt like my i guess\ndharma i don't know it felt like my\ngrand goal like i had to do it\nand and if i couldn't do it then i was\nlike a failure or something like i\nwouldn't be able to\ndo anything else if i put my mind to it\ni would fail like i did with this but\nnow i have it and now i'm like i do want\nto keep playing and push the time lower\nbut i'm struggling to find\nthat same meaning or that same passion\nthat i had\nbefore getting the record makes sense\nand\nis that what we're talking about today\nuh yeah that's part of what i want to\ntalk about today like dharma\nthat kind of thing yeah what else do you\nwant to talk about when you say it's\npart\nwhat else uh changing\nundesirable traits through meditation\nlike what that process looks like okay\nand\num probably flow state i'd like to talk\nabout that a bit\nokay we can do all of those things\nanything else i think that'll probably\ncover\nyeah i'll probably cover most of it and\num am i calling you simply\nor would you like me to call you\nsomething else you can call me ryan\nryan okay is that a randomly generated\nname from\none of the little marbles or is that\nryan yeah yeah\nokay so what do you want to start with\ndharma changing undesirable\nstates i mean traits are flow states\nuh i think we should start with dharma\nthat's kind of what we're on right now\nokay\ntell me what what's your understanding\nof dharma\nmy understanding of dharma is it's your\nit's like\nwhat will give you life or like what\nyour passion is like what you want to do\nwhat you feel like you should be doing\njust kind of your duty like\nyour natural thing you'll gravitate\ntowards what feels the best to do\nlike most pure kind of thing\nso yeah like your meaning what gives you\na lot of meaning like feeling connected\nokay so the first thing that i want to\npoint out is that you tossed out a bunch\nof things that are all very different\nokay right so what you should do\nand what you want to do\nare very different yeah so i i think\ni think you have an understanding of\ndharma i don't mean to say that you\ndon't understand it\nwhat i'm pointing out is that when we\ndefine the term the first thing is like\nwhat you want to do what feels the best\nto do what you gravitate towards\nwhat makes you feel connected and what\nyou should do can actually all be\ndifferent things\nthat's true and so this is the first\nthing that's tricky about dharma is like\nwhich one of these\nis it i think you're close to it\nso okay so i just want to point that out\nright so those are all different things\nand\nand it sounds like to me like you have a\ngood sense of what it truly means\nbecause\nyou're kind of approaching dharma from a\nlot of different\nangles what i want to do what feels good\num and so what do you believe\nyour tatarma is\nwell about like the nine months ago when\ni started grinding once again\nuh about a month into the grind i was in\nmasters i was at getting my master's\ndegree going\nfor computer science and then i just had\nlike a very deep\nfeeling inside that i had never had\nbefore in my life that was like\nbasically\ntelling me okay you have to you have to\nlike drop out and just go full time with\nmario\nand i was like wow it just felt it it\njust felt right i was like\nthis is what i have to do and then i\ntalked to my parents about that they\nwere like whatever you know they're not\nnot the happiest about it but they're\npretty supportive parents\nwow and so that at that moment it felt\nlike my dharma was like full-time\nstreaming and doing speed running to get\nthe record that's kind of\nwhere i was at and yeah\nthat's pretty much it and and how did\nyou feel\ngrinding grinding it out\nuh there's a lot of days where i felt\nreally good like some full days of just\nabsolute joy feeling like really really\nconnected\nuh with my with my chat with my\ncommunity and just with myself like i\nfelt very\nin tune i guess might be the word just\nvery good\nand then there was weeks where\ni was playing really bad like getting\nnothing going at all\nand i felt really down and i felt like i\nwas in a really weird spot because i\ndropped out\nto pursue this you know kind of dream\nand it wasn't going well\nand i was like it felt almost like my\ndharma got corrupted because\ni i feel like i lost sight like normally\nit was like playing because i liked the\ngame\nand then it turned into okay i need to\nplay good\nso i can get like my viewers so i can\nstill have the stream running because\nlike if you're playing really bad\nand you're just not in the best mood\nobviously people don't really care to\nwatch you know\nlike part of being a speedrunner is\nyou're gonna get viewers based off like\nhow good you're playing are you on a run\nbecause people like to come in when\nsomebody's on a run and there's like\nfull days where you don't get anywhere\nyou're just resetting\nin the beginning okay\nand so how did your dharma get corrupted\ni think it's a good way to put it\nwhat it was just\nthings that i ran into while like going\nfor\nthe dharma i guess yeah i was i noticed\ni started caring a lot more about\nviewers and like watching that\nand yeah that kind of thing because i\nknew you know\nthis is only sustainable as long as i\ncan like keep\nviewers or keep getting money because i\nneed to pay rent or whatever\nand so i started worrying more about\nthose things and it kind of\ndidn't allow me to feel like comfortable\nlike i just always had that fear in the\nback of my head so i was unable to\ni felt like i couldn't hit a flow state\nat all because i was always thinking\nabout those kind of things\nyep and i know that's when i would play\nthe best it's like when i'm actually\nhaving fun i just like stopped having\nfun\nso what's your understanding of how\nthinking about viewership corrupts your\ndharma\nuh what do you mean so how does that\nwork\nlike so you're you're suggesting to us a\ncouple of observations one is that\nyou had this you know calling deep\nwithin your chest that was like drop out\nof your master's play\nprogram and play super mario 64. yeah\nall day every day\nand you did that for a little while and\nyou felt fulfilled you were entering\nflow states it felt like it was the\nright thing to do\num you were you were in tune as you put\nit which is such a great way to put it\nand then things started to not go well\ni'm not entirely clear what's we know\nwhat came first but then your dharma\nbecame corrupted\nand what it feels like it got corrupted\nby is you started thinking about viewers\nyou started thinking about making your\nrent\nyou started thinking about things being\nsustainable or unsustainable\nyeah and then you were in a dark place\nso how does\nhow do those thoughts corrupt your\ndharma like what is the mechanism there\num i'm not really sure\nokay so we're we'll explain that okay\nokay so\nthe first question before that happened\nwhat was your mind focused on\njust mario like extreme was doing fine\nso i was like okay i'm just\nfocusing on mario like i don't know it\nfeels kind of momentum based a lot i\nthink\nlife in general just momentum is a word\ni find myself using a lot to describe\nhow things go on\nfor and i feel like it can destroy a lot\nof things well and\nin speed running like you can have a\ngood week\nwhere like you're playing good bad above\nflow state whatever you're just\npopping off and then i think there's\nlike some weird thing that happens where\nyou start to expect that\nand then maybe you have one bad day and\nthen that's the beginning of the ball\nand then the momentum just picks up and\nthen it's not just a bad day it's like\ntwo bad days and it's like oh my god i'm\nnot i'm not good anymore i can't play\nanymore like people don't want to watch\nso i don't know if it if it's like a\nswitch to viewers right away i think\nit's like a gradual thing\nokay so it's almost like there's a\nmomentum with the badness and the\nmomentum with the goodness\nyeah so ryan let me ask you a couple\nquestions first\nso are you i i'm finding\nthe desire to teach do you are you\nlooking more\nfor me to explore things with you or to\nteach you\nthings um\ni'm down for either one okay so i think\nwhat i would like to do is i think your\nyour the description of your experience\nis wonderful so i think you've stumbled\nupon a couple of really really key\nconcepts and when i ask you\nhow does dharma get corrupted so here's\nwhat you're giving me\ni had dharma this is what it felt like\nit came from somewhere i dropped out of\nmy master's program then my dharma got\ncorrupted and i noticed these thoughts\nand then i ask you how does dharma get\ncorrupted i ask you to tell me the\nprinciple\nbehind your observation and you're not\nquite able to describe it\nwhich is perfectly fine so then what i\nfeel like i should do is i should take\nyour observations which are\nspot on and try to give you the equation\nthat\ngoverns your observations\nokay does that make sense yeah so i'd\nlike to teach you\nhow dharma gets corrupted okay how\nmomentum works\nbecause wouldn't it be cool if you\nunderstood how to make\nmomentum that would be pretty dope yeah\nso we're going to talk about that\nand also to understand that momentum\ngoes both ways right you can have a\nnegative momentum and you can have a\npositive momentum\nand so what we understand is people\nbecause no one teaches this stuff is\nlike we observe that there's momentum\nbut we like don't understand if i asked\nyou\nryan where does momentum come from\nit's like i mean little by little like a\nlittle thing\nyou do laundry and then that's building\nup a little bit of momentum and then\nyou're like okay\ni can i can take care of a chore maybe i\ncan do like\nsomething okay just mario yeah so so\nwe'll talk about that\nso the first thing that i i want to\npoint out to people is that\nyou know when when ryan when you talk\nabout mario and being living your dharma\nyou're not how much are you thinking\nabout the world\nrecord when you feel in tune with your\ndharma\nnot at all explain that to us\ni mean when like when i'm actually\nplaying like\nyeah i'm playing well or whatever like\ni'm in the middle of a run\ni i guess you just get stung so much as\na runner where you make a mistake and\nlose the run that you learn that you\ncan't really get attached and you can't\nthink about oh this is the one this will\nbe the one this is the record\nbecause i mean that'll probably mess you\nup you'll get psyched out and then\nit's just inefficient because if you do\nreset then you're going to be like hurt\nand then playing when you're hurt sucks\nyou're just not so so what\nwhat causes the hurt where is the heart\nborn\nexpectation beautiful right so i want\nyou guys to really listen to what ryan\nis saying\nthis is a guy who quit his master's\ndegree to beat the world record\nand my question to him is how much do\nyou think about the world record when\nyou play and he says\nnot at all which sounds huh\nideally you're not thinking about it at\nall yeah right so like which sounds\nbizarre like that sounds contradictory\nbut i think\nthe reason that ryan has beat the world\nrecord is because he understands this\nstuff pretty well and to understand that\nlike\nso here's how i'll explain it\nso when you're doing your dharma you're\nnot actually thinking about an\noutcome you're focused on the task so\nwhat what ryan fell in love with is\nmario\nand like he had set sort of the world\nrecord is almost like an arbitrary goal\nbecause your mind needs something to\nmove towards\nbut generally speaking when you wake up\nand you stream you're trying your best\nnot to think about viewers not to think\nabout your time you're just devoting\nyourself to the task at hand\nso an analogy that i oftentimes use is\nlike one from\nmedicine right so like in medicine like\nyou train a lot and you work a lot\nbut at the end of the day like you can't\nsave a life\nit's just not something you can do so\nwhenever you're you're a doctor and\nlet's say you go to the hospital to do\nyour job you've prepared\nto be in the moment and you have a\ndharma to you have a duty to save lives\nbut you actually can't do it which\nsounds bizarre\nand and you know the best doctors are\nthe ones who just give it their all and\nthat's really the most that you can do\nand it's the ones who create\nexpectations\nthat first of all tend to do a worse job\nand also\nactually i don't know if that's true\nthey suffer more for sure\nbut i think it's it's interesting\nbecause if you really like listen to\nryan it's like very bizarre to hear the\nguys\nwho holds the world record for 120 stars\nin mario 64 to say when you think when\nyou play the game what do you\ndo you think about the record and he's\nlike i try not to but that is what what\ni've heard\ntime and time and time again for people\nwho pursue their dharma\nright if we you know you can take your\npick of\nwhoever so when i think about my dharma\nlike i just show up\nand whether the dude has a shirt or\ndoesn't have a shirt or whatever\nright i can't like be expecting certain\nthings and when i expect certain things\nit tends to get worse so what i really\ntry to do is i show up and i tell myself\nevery day that i stream that\nyou know i hope people watch it's great\nif people watch i'm here for people to\nwatch but at the end of the day\ni'm going to talk to you ryan for like\nan hour and a half and\ni'm going to try to help you and that's\nwhat i devote myself to\nso i want to use this word which we we\nwhich we don't really use very much in\nthe west nowadays because it has\nreligious connotations\nbut devotion so when we think about\ndevotion we think about like religion\nbut what i hear from you ryan is that\nyou devoted yourself\nto the task of mario does that make\nsense\nyeah and so there's something subtly\nlacking\nego there it's actually not about you\nit's about the purity of mario\ndoes that make sense so you're smiling\nso what what\nfeels like that's resonating with you\ncan you tell us about that\nthe game is good and it's just like it's\ndone so much for me\nas a person and so that's definitely\nwhat it is about is like just for mario\nto be able to push it further and like\nsee where the game can go\nyeah right so i want you guys to pay\nattention so\nare you talking in first person second\nperson or third person\num that third person\ni think absolutely which is strange\nright so we we'd expect\na speed runner to talk in the first\nperson\nabout mario i really enjoy the game i\nwant to do the best i want to hold the\nworld record\nbut the interesting thing is that i\nwould venture that your dharma gets\ncorrupted\nwhen you start thinking in the first\nperson yeah\ndefinitely so when you say yeah\ndefinitely can you give us an example\ni mean and this this will link to\nsomething else like changing\nundesirable traits but for a long time i\nwas in like the shadow\nit felt like of the other runners that\nheld the record\nand when i was in those modes of\noperation like\nseeing them get good runs or seeing them\nlike get more viewers or like do better\nthan me\nwould just make things worse because i\nwould like compare myself\nand kind of feel guilty and feel like\njealous and then\ntrying to play with that on your\nshoulders is just like really tough like\ni had\ni've you have to learn how to like\ntranscend it into\nadmiration or like turn it into them\nmaking you more competitive\nhow do you do that find an inspiration\nuh i think it was just like dealing with\nthe jealousy for too long and just\nfeeling like\nit i mean i still i still have like\nchelsea i don't think that's gone\num i think just now that i'm on top it's\nlike harder to be jealous because i'm\nlike i have\ni finally did it but it's just\nfinally being able to get good runs and\nlike feel like you can do it and\nyeah how do you do that though right so\ni'm imagining like i'm watching other\npeople's\nrecords and i get number three and i\nlook at them and i say\n[ __ ] those guys and\nand i find myself wanting to be like\nthem why can't i be like them\nwhy can't i be better why can't i focus\non the game why do i have to have these\nkinds of thoughts\ni know i shouldn't worry about them i\nshould just worry about mario\nyeah how do you actually get out of that\nframe of mind\nprobably looking at it more objectively\nlike not even looking at the run as\ntheir run\njust looking at their run as the run\nlike this is the run to beat\nand looking at their strategies and\nseeing okay what am i not doing because\nnot everybody's doing the same strats\nwe're\nlike some people are doing faster stuff\nhere faster stuff there\nand so i basically just kept working on\nmy own strats until i felt like i\nuntil it just felt like i can definitely\nget record no problem\nlike just practicing a lot off stream\nlearning new stuff\nand then getting to the point where i'm\ndoing the same stuff as them\ni'm i am fast enough etc and then\nfinally being able to see the results\nfrom how do you how do you go from why\ncan't i be\nlike them to because this is important\nright the person who is jealous of the\nnumber one who's sitting at number three\nis lacking confidence they have jealousy\nthey have envy\nhow do you move from there to i can't do\nthis\ni am fast enough you finally have a run\nthat's like really good pace you you\nfinally like\nyou don't beat it like you don't finish\nit but you get close like you're getting\nto the end of the run\nand that's after just practicing and\nfinally like hitting the stuff that i've\nbeen practicing\nin a run because like practice versus\nruns there's two completely different\nworlds like you can hit something in\npractice but then when you're actually\ntrying to go\nand doing that straight on a run it's\nlike it's going to be a lot different\nokay so what i'm hear you say is that\nyou practice\nand when you practice i think what\nyou're doing is you're devoting yourself\nonce again to the task\nand then the ego steps aside so i want\nto point out a couple things\none is that so what are the things that\ncorrupt dharma\nso ego is one when you start to compare\nand if we listen to to ryan twitch what\nyou guys will also see is he says that\nthe jealousy is still there\nright i think a big mistake that people\nmake is they assume that once they\nconquer something it's gone even the\nword conquer\nimplies like victory forever\nbut that's not how it works and dharma\nis not something you\nfind that is like finite and then you've\ndone it\nit's something that i want you guys to\nunderstand that ryan has been struggling\nto find his dharma\nlike every single day for the last nine\nmonths\nbecause it gets corrupted and you feel\nit slip away\nright and then you have to like try to\nget it again and then you've got it for\na little while and then it like slips\naway\nand then you have to like get it again\nyeah and so it's a practice so the\nbiggest thing that people i think\nmisunderstand is that when we talk about\ndharma it's sort of like oh i found my\ndharma period\neven i struggle every day with like\nfinding my dharma\nit's something that is like kind of an\nongoing task so ego so what are the\nsigns of ego you find yourself comparing\nwhat is the solution to comparison you\npractice\nand what practice means is that you\nfocus on the task because then it's not\nabout\nthem or you or their time or your time\nit's about i'm gonna try to do this\nthing in the game\ndoes that make sense yeah okay\nand then what happens is like when you\nstart to do the thing and you stop\nworrying about other people then what\nhappens is\nyour mind is free of the bias of other\npeople and then you're like oh when i\nactually look at\nwhat i'm able to produce it's actually\npretty good it still needs work but it's\npretty good\nand even if it's crappy you can still\nwork on it and then eventually you'll\nget to pretty good\nbut the key thing is to focus on the\ntask at hand\nand and this is where people talk about\nbeing in the present\num but ego corrupts the dharma that's\nnumber one\nnext thing that corrupts dharma is\nexpectation\nand you know ryan you said something\nabout this can you say something a\nlittle bit more about\nyou know how expectation creeps in\nit's very subtle um like for me at least\nin speedrunning it'll be\nit'll be like okay this level that i'm\ngoing into\nis pretty easy you know like from an\nobjective standpoint\nwhat we do in this level isn't that hard\nand what's funny is that when you have\nthose thoughts\nlike those levels will slap you the\nhardest like i'll get through the\nhardest part\nobjectively the hardest part of the run\nslam it be like oh that was so good\nnow i just need to make it through this\nlevel and i'm and once i do that thought\ni think that's already the expectation\nit's like this is an easy level\nand like classifying it as easy now it's\nlike okay if i mess it up\ni'm a big failure like i just messed\nthat up so bad i lost my time and now i\nfeel terrible\nand if it's a reset i feel like a huge\n[ __ ] because i'm just like wow i\ncan't believe\ni messed up on the easy level and now\nthe next runs are gonna hurt\nbecause i'm like in that hurt mindset\nyeah so you know it's interesting so i\nwork with some esports professionals\nand one of the interesting things that\nwe uncover like you know what causes\ntilt\nis it expectation yes\nand and what kind of expectation so\ni was talking to someone are you feeling\nthe mobas\nyep so that's why league is actually\nwhat got me into mario\nfunny enough how does that work so\nyou play league and then you're like\n[ __ ] this [ __ ] on everyone\nleague not a lot of good experiences\nwith that game but i\nit brought me to twitch and twitch is\nwhere i found mario like in 2012 one of\nthe biggest streamers on twitch\nwas siglemek and he was a mario\nspeedrunner and that\nthat's what gave me inspiration to try\nit out cool so\nhere's an interesting thing so you're\nright it's expectation so\nlet me ask you something if you're\nplaying a game\nand let's say you go 0 and 2 in mid\nthere's a chance you get tilted right\nyeah\nso do you think you're more likely to\nget tilted\nby the end of the game are you more\nlikely to be tilted if you start 0 and 2\nor you start 2-0\ntuna for sure why interesting right\nvery interesting pay attention folks\nso if you're starting 2-0 you're like oh\nman i'm popping off i got this\ni'm in a good spot like you're probably\na little bit\nfed you know you feel like you can\ninfluence the game a lot\nand then if anything goes wrong or you\nstart to fall apart you're going to be\nway more upset\nbut a comeback is way more hype like o2\nyou're like\nwell this game's already in the [ __ ]\nand now you're just kind of\ngrinding away and then if you can bring\nit back it's like\nit's you didn't expect it at all you\ndon't expect nothing when you're o2\nyou're like all right\ni'm expecting a loss so anything's\nbetter than a loss yep\nabsolutely right so it's bizarre so like\nthis is something that i think really\nholds back a lot of good players\nis this idea that when you're 2-0 you're\nexpecting a win\nand when they're like jungler or\nwhatever ganks you twice\nyou're way more tilted because you were\nsupposed to win that game\nyou dumpstered all over that shitty\nand then your jungler is [ __ ] afk\nwhile theirs is ganking you\nwhereas like bizarrely if you're 0-2\nbecause their jungler ganked you twice\nyou can still be a little bit tilted\nthere but it's completely different\nyeah you can go 0-2 because they're\njungler gank twice and then you can get\none solo kill or their jungler your\njungler finally shows up and ganks them\nonce and then you're one and two\ncompletely different game from if you're\ntwo and oh and their jungler ganks you\ntwice\nor even once and then you're two in one\nand you're still more tilted\nyeah for sure crazy right expectation\nexpectation is the enemy\nmeditation and spiritual training is\nlike so this is the thing no one teaches\nus this stuff\nbut literally you can train yourself to\nexpect less\nit's a cognitive process and we'll talk\nabout changing undesirable traits and\nmeditation and stuff like that\nyou can literally rewire your brain to\nexpect\nless when you rewire your brain to\nexpect less\nyou'll be less likely to tilt and\ntherefore you'll win more games\nbecause the crazy thing is that when\nyou're 2-0 and you get\nget ganked twice by their jungler and\nyou start tilting\nthe funny thing is like you're probably\nstill even\nor maybe you're a little bit behind\nbecause later kills are worth more than\nearly kills\nbut you're not as far behind as your\ntilt itself would think\nyeah it distorts your perspective it\nabsolutely distorts it and then you end\nup losing more games than you really\nshould\nand the reason that you lose the game\nthat you should win is because you\nthought you should have won it already\nwhich is bizarre yeah so freeing\nyourself\nexpectation and the thoughts are subtle\nright and this is also where meditation\ncomes in because like you see\nand if you train yourself to catch the\nsubtlety so meditation is about actually\nincreasing the subtlety of your mind\nthat's one of the definitions of the\npractice\nit's your ability to notice things that\nare smaller and smaller and smaller\nabout yourself\num and so when you\nit's like you're watching like you're\nplaying the game and then you look over\nand you happen to see your viewer\naccount yeah\nand if you glance over and your viewer\ncount is lower than it was yesterday\nwhat happens you start to feel worse\nwhy what are the thoughts you have\nit's like why am i why am i lower than\nusual am i not being as entertaining\nsometimes it's obvious like you just\nknow that you're i mean\nespecially back when i was like months\nago when i was grinding\nif you're doing bad runs you're gonna\nexpect it to be lower\nbecause you're just like playing bad\nit's like people aren't going to be\nthere\nbut it still hurts you're like wow\npeople just want to see like good runs\nand that's fair that's how it is\nit's kind of how speedrunning works yep\nwell so the interesting thing is that i\nthink that when you say that's\nfair that's not expectation\nmy sense is that when you when you look\nat the lower view account you say that's\nfair you're actually moving towards\ndharma\ni think looking back on these moments i\ncan say that it's fair but in those\nmoments when it actually is happening i\nprobably don't\nfeel that same way because if it's\nhurting then i'm probably not thinking\nit's fair i'm like\nyeah yeah right so but that too you can\nsee the difference\nthe way that you respond to that moves\nyou further away from dharma or closer\nif you say yeah these guys are you know\nmy my viewer count is lower\nbecause i'm not performing as well let\nme focus on performing\nand if the viewers are going to come\nthey're going to come but it has to do\nultimately do with the way that i play\nthe game\nand if you start thinking about oh the\nviewers are not coming and then you\nstart thinking if ego arises\nand this too if you start to feel bad\nthen ego is more likely to arise\nwhat do you think about that when you\nfeel bad is when you compare more\nthat's definitely pretty accurate\num\nif you feel bad you start to compare\nmore yeah\nbecause i mean you'll be lower and\nyou'll be like well yesterday i had\nmore viewers or these other players get\nmore viewers\nwhen they play worse than me or\nsomething like that you just start going\non weird tangents that don't even make\nsense anymore it's like\nthe momentum yeah yeah so so this is\nwhat happens so\nbad emotion leads to ego ego leads to\ncomparison\ncomparison is a function of the ego\nso if you're comparing are you always in\nan ego state\ngenerally speaking i'm gonna say yes\nyou can make comparisons without ego but\nfor the most part\nego is what triggers the most comparison\nso so you know this because you can look\nat a different speed runner and you can\nanalyze how they do things and how you\ndo things and there doesn't have to be\nego there\nyeah but comparison\nis usually ego you can look at their\nthing as their own thing\nand you can look at your thing as your\nown thing and you can acknowledge the\ndifference between those two\nbut that isn't comparison right\ncomparison is when you set the two side\nby side and you say like\nthis does that make sense yeah\nand so you can you can look at a\ngazelle and you can say wow a gazelle is\nfast and you can look at a cheetah and\nyou can say wow\ncheetah's fast and then the second you\nsay like oh like look at that cheetah\nthat cheetah so much faster than the\ngazelle\nthat becomes a comparison although that\ndoesn't sound like it's ego at all but\nyeah you know generally speaking i'd say\nthat for our population and our\ncommunity\nmost of the comparisons they make are\nnot dispassionate\nand that most of them are dependent on\nego\nokay so um\nhow do you protect yourself from that\ndo you have any ideas from getting\ncaught in like an ego state\nyep just staying as focused as you can\non the task\nlike i like the flow state or whatever\nyou kind of hit that if you can just\nwhat i do is just like listen to sounds\nin the game and if i can listen to those\nfor a prolonged amount of time\nlike deeply then all of a sudden i'm\nlike it's like i built that momentum up\nlike\ni was able to put one minute or two\nminutes of pure focus in and now i'm\nlike\nin the zone okay i think beautiful so\nthat is a tar now\nthat you're doing so i want you guys to\nnotice means a focusing technique\nyour camera's broke yeah thank you\nso adharana is a focusing technique it's\nessentially a meditative practice\nand what i want you guys to notice is\nthat when he focuses his mind\non sounds what he does is doesn't give\nfuel to the negative thoughts and the\nnegative thoughts\nbreed additional thoughts right when you\ngive in to an expectation what happens\nyou've basically opened pandora's box\nlike that's the beginning of the\nnegative momentum yep so tell me what\npandora's box looks like can you give us\nan actual example\num i mean one that i'm dealing with a\nlot recently is like\nso i have the decision like i want to\nkeep my sleep schedule good right so\nit's like 2 a.m\nand i'm like okay i can either go to bed\nor i can go like\nmy one of my big vices is eating and\njust like staying up late\nuh so it's like either i go to bed or i\njust make like a plate of chips watch a\nquick video then i go to bed\nand then if i go make that food come\nback down then before i know it i'm like\nit's like two hours later i ate like\nmultiple\nbags of chips or like i'll just make\nsnacks like we have so much\njunk food in this house i'll just be\nlike deep in the dumpster\nall of a sudden and it feels like i got\nthere like i don't even remember\nhow i got here you know it's just like\nall of a sudden you're\nin the gutter yep right so so\nso pandora's box one thing leads to\nanother there's a so i want you guys to\nnotice that the\ndeviation from dharma starts with a\nsubtle thought it's a tiny tiny thought\ni can go to bed or it's not even a\ndecision it's just a possibility at that\npoint\nyeah and then you give in to that\npossibility and then that thought\nbreeds another thought which breeds\nanother thought which breeds another\nthought\nand then you get stuck in a cycle of\nshame\nor a stop like a panic attack or stuck\nin anxiety paralyzed by fear\nand all of those big big thoughts that\ntwo hours later\nyou're covered in crumbs and your\nstomach is upset\nand there's like grease on your face and\nyou said make a plate of chips which\nsounds delicious usually i eat them out\nof the bag but it sounds like you take\nit to the next level\nyeah i've never heard of anyone making a\nplate of chips maybe nachos\nnachos yeah i make nachos i'll just like\nget tortilla chips and put cheese on\nthem and then if we have meat i'll put\nsome meat on them\ndamn straight little my dude i didn't\nthat didn't slip by me i can tell\nmake a plate i know what that's like\nall right put some black beans on there\nif you want to be if you want to\nalleviate your\nguilt you can even chop up like fresh\ntomatoes are good bell pepper is good\noh that's dangerous no but i mean like\nat least if you're gonna\neat the plate of nachos like chop some\n[ __ ] in there and then\nget some veggies you know what i'm\nsaying true\nyou know black beans also potentially\nhealthier alternative to\nto like taco meat i i get you though\nnot as tasty sometimes you want it to\njust be greasy you just\nwant to be yeah but the chips and the\ncheese is going to do that trust me\nif you try putting some black beans on\nthere and you season them you got to\nseason them well\nokay i'll give it a shot if you're\nhungry enough at 2 30 in the morning\nit's going to taste delicious man\nyou don't really need the taco beet try\nit get back to me\nme know i'll let you know dm me\nlet me know for sure um\nbut the the key thing here is that\nthere's a subtle thought and then it\nleads to this pandora's boxes you put it\nyeah and so the key thing is if you can\ncatch that subtle thought\nat its inception and kind of\ncatch it and not let it grow and the way\nthat you not let it grow is you can\nrefocus your mind so i think you do a\ngood job of like you're the hotter in a\npractice\nwhich is you listen to the sounds so\nliterally what you're doing with your\nconcentration and your attention\nis you're focusing on a sound and if\nyou're focusing on a sound you literally\ncannot think at the same time\nyou may have distracting thoughts so\nlike your mind is focused on the sound\nand then it like deviates this way and\nthen you bring it back to the sound\nthen it deviates this way and you bring\nit back to the sound if it deviates a\nthird time and each time it deviates it\ngets a little bit weaker a little bit\nweaker a little bit weaker\nand then ultimately it'll stop and then\nyou'll be in the zone\nso that's literally the practice of\nmeditation\nyeah um and it starts with a subtle\nthought we talked about expectation\nwe talked about ego so now we're going\nto talk about\nmomentum any questions so far\nno okay so quick question we're gonna\nwe're gonna\ni'm gonna just check in with twitch chat\nfor a second i usually don't look at\ntwitch chat but\ntwitch chat do you guys have any\nquestions so far or is this making sense\ni see you got some new emotes in the\nchat i was looking earlier you got the\nthe fish fish bog do you see those on\nyour screen\ni don't know what that is it's like the\nfish that's just\ngoing crazy oh that's what that is i've\nbeen seeing that thing a lot\ni didn't realize it was a fish\nokay so so i'm asking them if they have\nquestions and all i'm seeing is the fish\ni should have missed anything about that\nno no i mean it's fine it's just\nthey're going crazy okay okay so i'm\ngonna assume that this is good\nbecause we're just seeing fish what does\nthe fish mean does the fish mean people\nare happy or unhappy yeah it's just like\nexcitement it's\nit's just like intensity like you just\namplify whatever you're saying if you\nput the fish next to it i feel like\nit's just high intensity okay\nokay so so they seem to be they feel\nlike this is a super high intensity\nconversation\nabout this no they're just saying it\nbecause i said\nfish fog okay yeah okay so let's talk\nabout momentum\nso i want you to reframe so momentum is\nlike something that they obs you observe\nafter the fact\nfirst thing right you're like yeah like\nmomentum is happening you don't know how\nexactly how you create it but you\nobserve it\nas an after effect\nyeah i mean at least in the negative\nsenses i think when i'm doing like\npositive things i can kind of feel it in\nthe moment but when it's like negative\nor\nbad it's like i go and start to go like\nout of touch\nand just sort of unconscious and then i\nlook back and i'm like wow that\nthat escalated quickly so i'm gonna\nreframe momentum\nwith a different word i'm gonna call it\nkarma\nor karma okay what do you think about\nthat does that\nring any bells for you yeah i've heard\nyou talk a lot about karma\nit's it's like the cause and effect yep\nand it's rawest form you call it like\ncause effect\nyep so if we think about momentum what i\nthink this means is that you are sowing\na seed\nthat reaps a fruit\nwhich in turn gives you many more seeds\nthat you can plant\nand that it like exponentially amplifies\nyep so sowing positive karma leads to\npositive karma and then if you continue\nto sow positive karma\nyou're gonna reap positive karma and the\nsame is true of negativity\nright if you give in to that first\nsubtle negative thought\nyou will reap 10 more negative thoughts\nyeah and that becomes even harder\nand then if you indulge those 10\nthoughts you will reap\na hundred negative thoughts and even\nwomen\nand then you find yourself being 25\nyears old living at home\nnot sure what to do with your life\nbecause you are\nswimming in a half decade\nof negative karma that you've sowed for\nyourself\nand whether it be nachos at 2 a.m\nor you know indulging in certain kinds\nof like\ncontent on the internet that sort of\ntraps you or makes you thumb sick which\nyou can explain what that is\nbut like there's a lot of like negative\nkarma like using substances i think is a\ngood example\nof something that alleviates feelings in\nthe present\nbut opens you up for negative karma down\nthe road\nyeah you're more likely to turn to that\nagain absolutely because it doesn't\nactually solve anything right it just\nmakes you feel better\nyeah and even in some cases like if you\nlook at substances like marijuana\nmarijuana actually decreases your\nmotivate it doesn't make people stupider\nbut what it does is\nis hamper with your motivational drives\nand so the classic idea of a pothead is\nsomeone who sits around and doesn't do\nanything all day that's because\nyou know that's sort of somewhat true so\nthere are productive people who use\nmarijuana on a regular basis but if you\ntake 100 people\nand they use marijuana and you take 100\npeople who don't use marijuana\nthe people who don't use marijuana are\nmore likely to be more productive\non average and so a lot of what what\nhappens in terms of like being stuck in\nlife\nis essentially you're reaping all of\nthese bad fruit\nfruits i mean the seeds that you sow\nso you're reaping negative fruit from\nsowing bad seeds\nand in momentum it works both ways\nright like like if you maintain a good\nsleep schedule like why do you care\nabout maintaining a good sleep schedule\nbecause then i everything else will be\nbetter like i cannot focus\nhow the [ __ ] does that what do you mean\neverything else will be better how does\nthat work\nwhat do you mean everything will be\nbetter what is it like just a flat out\nbuff 20\nyeah yes you're damn right it is\nand that's exactly how it works this is\nsewing positive karma\nright like literally your cognitions are\nbetter\nyour brain clears out this waste product\ncalled adenosine\nwhich is like a waste product from your\nbrain and adenosine when your brain\nuses energy for cognition it takes this\nthing called\natp and turns it into adenosine\nand then when you sleep you clear out\nthat adenosine and you turn it back into\natp\nand it literally means that your brain\nhas more energy when you have restful\nsleep\nand people who do not have good restful\nsleep cycles\nwhich doesn't just mean the hours that\nyou sleep it also means the kind of\nsubstances that are in your brain when\nyou fall asleep\nit also means the ratio of like\nrem sleep to non-rem sleep so generally\nspeaking this\nyour sleep cycle changes over the\nduration of your sleep\nso it starts out with longer i think\nphase one and phase two sleep\nand over time as you go through multiple\nsleep cycles the phase one and phase two\nshrink\nand i think you have more non-rem sleep\ni'm a little bit rusty on the details\nbut literally your fifth hour and sixth\nhour of sleep\nare not the same as your first or second\nhour from\nof sleep from a physiologic and\nneuroscientific sense\nand then furthermore that that shift\nin your sleep cycle is reinforced by a\ncircadian rhythm do you know what that\nmeans\nthat's just like your general sleep\nschedule i don't know too much yep\nso circadian rhythm is your body clock\nso if you're used to sleeping at the\nsame time every day and it also is like\nyour bodily clock\nit'll enhance the quality of your sleep\nso i think a big problem in terms of\nnegative karma that our community faces\nis that they're like\nthey have crappy sleep which in turn\nmeans that they're like\nwhen they you know when you rest you\nplay rpgs\non occasion so when you rest in an end\nwhat happens to your mana bar\nrefill everything refills you're back\nabsolutely\nand our community when they when they go\nto sleep their mental\nbar only fills up 60 and then they're\nconfused as\nlike why they suck at life right so it's\nnuts\nbut like this kind of physiology\nphysiology stuff is is important\nand then the other thing ryan i just\nwant to say explicitly is you are the\nguy who holds the world record\nfor 120 stars in super mario\nand you are also saying that sleep is\nvitally important\nyeah and so if you guys don't believe me\nlisten to the world champion\num it's tough though now cause like i\nfeel like since i got it\nit's hard to care as much about that you\nknow like the hunger\nyeah like the thirst to play well isn't\nas\nin front of my mind like i feel like\nthat i was able to keep a more\nconsistent sleep schedule before the\nworld record than after\nyep so that's just like whatever now\nwe're going to talk about that and we're\ngoing to explore a little bit further i\njust want to tie up one last thing about\nkarma so what i want you to think about\nfor all of you guys is what are you\nsewing for tomorrow\nand and just like you said earlier if i\ncan do the laundry maybe i can play\nsuper mario\nright so every action you take you're\nsewing you're sewing a seed that's going\nto bear fruit\nand so when you eat those nachos that's\ncool like if you can even deviate a\nlittle bit and throw a little bit of\ntomato or bell pepper or cilantro on\nthere\nthat's actually going to help you out\nthe next day\nthat makes sense right so it's going to\nhelp with your fiber\nit's going to keep you regular it's\ngoing to promote bacteria that are\nanti-anxiety and anti-depression\nin your gut when you have fresh fruits\nand vegetables literally\nnot kidding there are studies that show\nthat you can take depressed mice\nand do a stool transplant into healthy\nmice and once you transplant their stool\nfrom the depressed mouse to the healthy\nmouse\nthe healthy mouse becomes depressed wild\nbut even something as simple as eating\nfresh fruits and vegetables can actually\naffect your mood\nso think about good sleep good\nabsolutely\nso but think about those things as\npositive karmas and tell yourself that\nlike every time you you do an\naction you're setting yourself up for a\nman a buff\nor a man a debuff three days from now\nand the more that you can focus on\nbuffing up your mana bar like three four\nfive six seven days down the road the\nbetter off you're gonna be\nokay any questions about that or we you\nwanna move to the hunger\nthat's no long that's now been satisfied\nand no longer keeps you on track\num i guess one question about that is\nlike how\nwhy is it so hard like even if you know\nfully well like oh yeah if i go to sleep\nthat's definitely the better move\nit's still really difficult to just\ngood like it's so easy to just stay up\nand just make\nmake that play to nachos just why do you\nthink it's hard\nprobably because it's like an immediate\nthing like you get an immediate\nimmediate satisfaction versus the\ndelayed\ni'd go even further i'd say that what\nyou're get\nwhat so this is the struggle it's not\neven about immediate versus delayed\nit's about real versus unreal\nbecause what is that if you don't eat\nthe plate of nachos\nwhat does tomorrow look like\nit's the same and if you do eat the\nnachos what does tomorrow look like\nhopefully the same like you want to\nbelieve there's no\nthere's no difference in your mind just\nthink about that for a second\nand that's like the subtle thing yeah\nyou like if you you\nthink you can just do one but then once\nyou do one that's where it starts to\neverything starts to like get distorted\nbecause like like really when you're\nsitting there and you're looking at the\nplate of nachos and you say if i don't\neat this like what's gonna happen like\nyou're not\nreally sure it's just better for you\nbut what does that practically mean it\nmeans nothing yeah\nthere's no tangible cost in your mind\nso the reason that it's hard is not\nbecause you're dumb or you're lazy\nit's because your mind has a tangible\nbenefit\nversus nothing\nif you really stop and think about like\nwhat you're gonna eat some you're gonna\nchop up some bell pepper on your nachos\nso\nwhat happens nothing\nnothing is gonna happen\nif you eat the bell pepper you don't eat\nthe bell pepper how are you gonna ever\nnotice a difference you're not going to\nnotice a difference\nyeah so this is where what you guys need\nto learn how to do\nis to act for no reason\nthe problem is that all of our actions\nare driven by reasons\nthis is what paralyzes us\nbecause we know what happens when you\nplay the game for reasons because we\ntalked about this right\nwhat happens when you play the game for\nreasons ryan\nyou start to get lost in the sauce\nbizarre and crazy right yeah we're\ntaught our we're conditioned our entire\nlife to do something\nbecause of something that's what [ __ ]\nus\nbecause what happened in our\ngeneration's case is we were taught you\ndo this\nand then this will happen and in our\ncase what happened\nis like we were told go to college and\nthen you'll be\nbuy a house and then like that was a\nscam\nyeah and so we were taught yep we were\ntaught to do things for reasons and then\nthose reasons turned out to be false\nso now you have a generation of people\nwho don't know how to act because every\ntime they've acted it's for a reason\nand so bizarrely the way that you you\nstop doing it\nis that like you let go of the reason\nyou say to yourself\ni'm not doing this because\nstool transplants and rats alleviate\ndepression like that's a stretch\nyeah right i'm doing this because i\nchoose to\ni'm doing this because like as a human\nbeing i want the capacity to control my\nown life\nand i want you guys to understand that\nif you're doing something for a reason\nyou're not in control\nbecause if you take the reason away you\nwouldn't do it\nbut there's like a great reason and that\nwould that be dharma yes\nthat reason is internal though what i'm\ntalking about is a particular outcome\nokay in terms of a reason right like if\ni tell you why\nwhy would you eat bell pepper like\nthere's an\nexternal reason that you're weighing\nagainst the immediate satisfaction of\neating the food\ndoes that make sense or did i lose you\nuh it's getting abstract okay\nyeah let me try again so\nyou know there's a good outcome to\neating the plate of nachos\nwhereas not eating the nachos has an\nunclear vague i'll be healthy\nlike that's not a real thing right\nyou have to like zoom out zoom out and\nthen and then also just do something for\nthe sake of doing it just like you said\nwhen you play the game of mario\nyou're not thinking about an outcome\nyou're just doing it for the sake of\ndoing it\nso what you need to train yourself to do\nand it starts and then people say how do\nyou do this it starts small\nright so the next time that you're\neating you prepare some food for\nyourself\nwhat you need to do is like do a tiny\nlike get a little bit of xp\nthe way that you get a little bit of xp\nis you spend a little bit more effort\nputting something on there that you\nnormally wouldn't put that's supposed to\nbe good for you\nand you recognize that you are never\ngoing to notice the difference\nbut you are doing it for the sake of\ndoing it you're playing the game for\nmario you're not doing it for the world\nrecord\nso to act in that moment for the sake of\nthe thing\nas opposed to some other thing you're\nnot doing it for viewership count you're\nnot doing it\nfor world record you're not doing it to\nrefill your mana bar\nyou're not doing it to be to live longer\nyou're not doing it to prevent\nhemorrhoids you're just gonna do it\nbecause that's what you've decided to do\njust do it yes\nbut just do it is not easy that's not\nhow it works\njust doing it is a god-awful struggle\nagainst yourself\nyou recognize that within yourself there\nare going to be a thousand reasons\nwhich tell you don't do this thing\nand then you tell them to go [ __ ]\nthemselves and you do it anyway\njust do it is not easy it's in spite of\nyourself\ndid you like force yourself yeah\nnot force overcome\nokay and you're gonna lose that battle a\nlot\nand that's okay okay just gotta keep\nresetting just like in mario 64 man\njust got to keep going yep yep push\nthrough it\nokay other questions does that make\nsense\nokay so let's talk about the hunger so\nyou used to have this hunger\nthat aligned all of your actions yes\nnow what i don't know man now i'm just\nlike i got it\nand you know before it was like this is\na challenge worth going for i've never\ndone it like if i can do it and conquer\nthe nerves that's huge\nand now i did it once and i'm like and\nand usually when people have gotten\nworld record in the past they keep going\nand keep pushing and like push it lower\nbut every time it gets pushed lower it\ndoes get harder to do\nand so i'm just i'm really struggling to\nto find\nfind that hunger yeah yeah so it sounds\nto me like you've in a sense\ncompleted this chapter of your life yeah\nthat's kind of where i'm at like i feel\nsort of in limbo in that sense\nyeah so then the question so that's okay\nso let's start by just thinking\nacknowledging that that just because\nsome people\ncontinue to try to push it lower doesn't\nmean you have to\nhow do you feel about yourself ryan\npretty good okay in general how did you\nfeel about yourself 10 months ago\num\n10 months ago that's when i started\nplaying i felt really good\nso i was like at the beginning of the\njourney it felt like very fulfilled\nokay 12 months ago really bad\ntell me about that so at that time i was\ndealing with like\ncarpal tunnel and tendonitis and that\nwas something that's why i had taken a\nbreak from mario in the first place\nand i was like really lost because i\nwasn't doing anything like anything that\ni liked doing\nhurt because i had like this chronic\npain\nand so like i like to make music i like\nto um\nwhat else coding obviously computer\nscience like i'd like to code stuff and\nall that would just hurt and so i was\njust kind of in pain and that was not\nfun and so i didn't want to do anything\ni couldn't play mario\nand yeah i felt very very unfulfilled\nthat was probably like the worst part\nprobably like one of the darkest moments\nof my life at least it felt like\njust like very numb very unconscious\nvery robotic\nand then um a viewer recommended a book\nto me that\ni was able to like conquer the\ntendonitis and carpal tunnel with\nand then i came back what's the book\nthe mind body prescription interesting\ncan you tell us about that it's this\nidea that your repressed emotions are\ncausing\nyour pain like your tendonitis or carpal\ntunnel\nand so you have to like journal\nand try to reflect and figure out what\nare you not addressing\nin your life that might be pressuring\nyou that you have no idea about\nlike yeah and did you find some that you\nwere\nrepressing something yeah it was mostly\nstuff related to my family just like\nworrying about\nparts of my family was like a big one\nand\nmyself like my pressure with school and\nlike doing the master's program\ni think was causing a fair amount how do\nyou feel about the master's program\nat the moment yeah like now um\ni feel like it was a waste of time like\ni\ni did it mostly because my parents\nwanted me to do it and it was like a\nfree ride\nlike i was able to get in and do\nteachers assistantship so i was a ta\nand then it was all paid for which\nsounded like a great deal and i was like\nokay i should do this\nbut then when i was actually doing it\nlike it felt very mundane and it felt\nlike\nif i wanted to keep doing it i could\njust do it on my own at this point like\ni knew enough that i could just figure\nout what i wanted to figure out if i\nwanted to code something\nor whatever do you want to code yeah\nso are you learning how to code\nthat's something that is like it feels\nlike one of those side things that i\nwant to do that kind of fulfills\nlike i don't know soul i guess like it\nfeels very good to code\ni've had some side projects in the past\nand at the moment i'm like\nwaiting to get into the next one like i\nhave an idea i haven't sat down and\nstarted it\nwhat keeps you from sitting down and\nstarting it\ni'm not really sure so i think that's\nwhat we have to explore\nso here's what i think um ryan\nso i think that your karma and your\ndharma\nso karma triggers your dharma this is\nthe first thing to understand\nso the example that i use is let's say\ni'm a doctor\nand i'm working in the emergency room\nand what is my dharma\nit depends on who comes in\nright so if like no one comes in then my\ntime was to sleep well\nif someone does come in overnight it's\nto wake up and help those people\nso in your case i think that your karma\ncalled you to do certain things right so\nif you think about it your circumstances\ngave you the opportunity to do a\nmaster's degree for free\nand that sounds like a wonderful\nwonderful thing you were so lucky ryan\nso privileged yeah and then then you\nwere given that opportunity and then in\nthat opportunity you had this little\nvoice that said this is not for me\nand then you embarked on this journey\nyour camera's blurry again by the way\noh no you embarked on this journey\nand then you became a different person\nover the course of the last year\nand it is my belief that the person that\nyou are today\nis necessary for the next thing that you\nhave to do\nokay and that if you had not dropped out\nof your master's program\nyou would still have to conquer that\nlevel before you moved on to the next\none\nbut think about the person that you've\nbecome over the last year it's a\ncompletely different person\nyeah and i don't think it's like it's\nkind of bizarre but like you know in\nvideo games we don't like go to the last\nboss at level two\nwe go to the first boss at level two\nyeah and then you get stronger and then\nyou do the next thing so now you have a\ngood understanding of like\nto a certain degree expectation your\nmind\nhow to do dharuna how to focus how to\nlet go of expectation how to let go of\ncomparison\nthat those are going to be important\nskills for the next phase of your life\nbecause the next phase of your life\nsounds\nlike it's going to be directionless and\nwhat you're going to happen\nis as as you're directionless and you're\nworking on this little project\nwhich is going to be your dharma you're\ngoing to look at\na dozen other people who finish their\nmaster's degrees and got jobs\nand you're going to need a certain\namount of fortitude to stick with your\nthing\nyeah instead of deviating and the way\nthat you leveled that up\nis through mario speedruns yeah\nand so recognize that whatever force it\nis that\nhas brought you this far is also\nsupporting you now\nand now the next thing it's trying to\nteach you is like\nwhy aren't you doing that coding project\nthat's the next phase i i suspect it may\nbe something else\nbut i think that you know what you want\nto do and your\nyour next phase isn't just figuring out\nlike the motivation and studying\nyourself and looking at yourself and\nstarting to do those things\nand remembering that like you can get\ncaught up about what you should do and\nstuff like that but\nonce you pick up the controller and you\nstart playing the game the rest is going\nto take care of itself\nyeah starting is the hardest part yep\nand so now you need to learn how to do\nthat\nbecause now you've got 10 percent to 90\ntaken care of\n[Music]\nit's zero to ten you've been training on\n10 to 90 for the last year\nand even to a certain degree you've also\ntrained about getting zero to ten\nbut i i mean to me it feels like you\nshould code what do you think about that\ni mean while i'm still streaming like\nthat's my main thing i'm still doing\nfull-time streaming\nso i obviously want to keep doing that\nbut yeah i think\nwhen i think about like when i felt the\nbest it's like i'm feeding myself\ni feel like there's two pillars of my\nwell-being it's like health is like\nsleeping\neating meditating exercising and then\nthere's like soul\nand that's like the hobbies like mario\ncode in music\nwhatever and so i just need to\nactually do it like yep but but once\nagain\nnotice that you know actually doing it\nis not just doing it\nit's the opposite that every day you\nwake up\nand because remember like the reason you\ncan't do it is because you don't know\nwhy you're doing it there's no goal\ndoes that make sense yeah and so what's\nthe solution\nto that do you have a sense\ngoing in without any expectations yep\nwhat that means is to have no reason to\ndo it\nremember that right so like the the key\nhere is like why is it hard to eat the\nplated i mean\nwhy is it easy to eat the plate of\nnachos it's because you do something\nfor a reason or no reason and it's hard\nto pick no reason over a reason\nyeah for sure and so you're going to\nwake up tomorrow\nand you're going to have no reason to\ncode and you've got to do it anyway\nacknowledge that notice that\nsay that there's a part of me that wants\nto sow the seed of karma\nthat will bear fruit three months from\nnow\nbut the effort of digging and planting\nand planting and sticking the seed in\nis like you're not going to see any\nyield from that maybe the seed will\nnever grow\njust do it is not easy it's actually\nvery hard you have to do it in spite\nof all the things that hold you back\ni like that right it's like you have to\ncontinue playing\nin spite of the fact that you're number\nthree\nmoving forward in life is about\nabandoning reasons\nnot finding them yeah\ni think i realized that when i actually\nlike finally made that final push to\nrecord like i\ni was like i know i can't do anything\nabout viewership or anything i just like\ncompletely surrendered\nand i was like i'm just gonna play i'm\nnot looking anymore and then that's when\neverything just got way better\nyep so so these are concepts that\nunfortunately have gotten tangled up\nwith re\nreligion but devotion and surrender are\nkey\nyeah this concept of like that's\nliterally what happened with me too like\ni showed up on twitch one day and i was\nlike i'm gonna do this thing\nand i thought that if in one year if i\nhad 200 concurrent viewers that would be\na success\nit turns out that yes slightly more than\nthat\nyeah right and i i think it's about\ndevoting yourself to the action and not\nworrying about the viewership count\nrecently too we had a little bit of a\nyou know an interesting conversation at\nhealthygamer about like\nwho we interview on stream and what kind\nof content we do\nbecause we noticed that the more bigger\nstreamers we have the bigger our\nviewership is and so it's like do we\nwant to cater to that do we want to\ncontinue growing\nwe said actually no that's not what we\nshowed up here to do\nwe showed up here to help people and if\nour viewership tanks our viewership\ntanks\nso be it right it's about having\nconversations oh you're not like because\nhere's the thing ryan you're not gonna\nhave some kind of emotional catharsis at\nthe end of this conversation\nyeah which is gonna impact our\nviewership\nbut instead what we're going to try to\ndo is help you\nand if the viewership goes down the\nviewership goes down\nright you do the thing for the sake of\nthe thing\nyeah and in your case\ni don't know exactly what it looks like\nbut i i think i'm not too worried about\nyou finding your dog\nbecause i think it's just you've got\nthat voice like you know you want to\ncode or make music or whatever\nso you start planting those seeds and\nthen something will take\nroot and then karma will show up and\nwill tell you what to do\nbut garma waits until you're ready and\nwhat that mean do you want what kind of\ncoding do you want to do if you don't\nmind me asking\nmaking games obviously right so like\nthis is where i think bizarrely if you\nwant to\nmake a particular kind of game or you\nwant to work for a studio\ndo you have a resume no\ni mean yeah but it's outdated kind of so\nlike i i think that\nyou know as crazy as this sounds i think\nif you say i was in a master's program\nso you're gonna have a cover letter\nand you say i love games i love to code\nyou've got to code a couple of things\nso that you have like some kind of\nresume then i would put on your cover\nletter i draw i had a full ride master's\nprogram that i dropped out of\nto become a streamer and i hold the\nrecord for super mario 64. now i'm ready\nto get back into coding\ni understand games i understand them in\nand out\ni'm also a good coder and i don't need a\ndegree for that\nwill you give me a job here's what i can\ndo\nand if i was a game developer i would\n[ __ ] hire you internet stuff\nit's good right it's bizarre\nthere are a thousand kids out there who\nhave masters in computer science\nvery few hold the world record in\nanything\nit speaks to me of dedication of focus\nof a love of video games and if you can\ncode on top of that\n[ __ ] a\nokay what do you think about that\ni think you're right i think\ni just gotta like just doing it but not\ndoing it for any reason\nyep right and i would suspect\nthat you thought that certain things\nneeded to happen\nbefore you could get a job where you\nwant a job\ni guess i mean i'm not um not really at\nthe moment thinking about like getting a\njob though like i kind of want to do it\nsolo\nstuff with streaming but yeah yeah so i\nmean i think if you want to do stuff\nsolo you do\nyou don't have to get a job but i think\nif you want to make games you should\n[ __ ] wake up tomorrow and you should\nstart making games\nor today right or today beautiful\nit's a trick question saw through the\ntrap\nright so i pay attention to a chat this\nguy understands what he's talking about\ntomorrow is it's easy\nit's hard yeah but so the last thing\nthat i'll leave you with ryan is that\nthere is a game inside you\nand that one day maybe a year from now\nmaybe five years from now or 10 years\nfrom now\nthere's a bit going to be a kid who is\nlost and directionless\nand in order to help him you have to\nmake the game that he's going to play\nto inspire him\ni like that so that is your title\nthat like you have to understand that\nsomewhere just think about the person\nwho made super mario 64. what kind of\nstruggles do you think they had\nhow did the game get made\ni mean consoles coming out pressure to\nbring out like the first 3d game and\nlike you want it to be good you want it\nto be memorable\nyou want it to be like a crazy\nexperience\non all of those accounts those are all\nexpectations\nyou see that that is not it's meeting\nexpectations that gets the kind of\naaa trash that we see it's formulaic\nvideo gaming\nthat we see a lot of\ni don't believe for a second that the\nperson who made super mario 64\nthe team that made super mario 64 was\ntrying to live up to expectations\ni think what happened if i if i had to\nbet money what i would say is there was\na group of people who loved mario\nand said we now have the technology to\nhave mario move\nin more than two directions\nwhat kind of mate game can we make\nand it's that desire it's the desire to\nlike create something that\nin the frontier of video gaming nothing\nhad ever been made before\ni want to make a mario game where i can\nhide a star\nin a place that has never been hidden\nbefore even the concept of stars\njust think about that non-linearity of\nlevels\nnecessitated the concept of stars to\nbegin with\nbecause where is the point there's a\nthere's a linear trajectory in a 2d game\nright in a 3d game like how do you\ndesign a linear trajectory they had to\nbreak out of the idea of a start and a\nfinish to a level\nhow do you guide a player when there's\nno end of the level\ngotta have the objectives exact\ncollectibles the moons the stars\nbut see the moons and the stars are all\nobjectives that's not what the first\nperson thought\nthat's what the duplicators thought does\nthat make sense\nyeah they'd seen it done before yep\nso that's what i think it happens to\nmario now is they're like repeating a\nformula\nand they innovate a little bit but i\nthink the person who made super mario 64\nwas true like the team was truly\nrevolutionary\nthey tried to make the best game that\nthey could with like this entire new\ndimension of technology it's like\ni've played the flute my whole life and\nsuddenly you're giving me a set of drums\nit's like what can i make with this\nentire other instrument and i think\nthat's what you've got to do\nyou've got to think about the game that\nhasn't been made before\nthat you have to make because you're a\n[ __ ] gamer man and you're one of us\nso we need good [ __ ] to play\nhow does that sound for the thunder that\nsounds pretty good\nthat does sound pretty good hesitations\ni mean a little bit i still\nlike i think that is definitely part of\nit but i feel like i still have\nlike streaming is like my main thing\nthat i'm doing like with most of my time\nand so i guess i mean the game does\ninvolve streaming so\nthat would that would make sense so i\ndon't think it's like exclusive\ni think the the big problem that i see\nwith you is like a hump to get started\nso i'd say get started\nand maybe you won't end up making a game\nmaybe it won't work out whatever\nbut devote yourself to the task and see\nif that amount of inspiration is enough\nto get you started\nand then your karma will determine the\nrest\nyou'll wake up one day and then just\nlike you said with super mario 64\nyou'll wake up one day and you'll say i\ncan do this\nand i can't do this exactly and so all\nyou have to do is sew the karma\nto give yourself a chance\nall right\nsounds good i will give it a chance okay\ngive it a shot\nwhat about undesirable traits\num something that has come up and has\nalways kind of been around is like\njealousy\nlike i said before like that was with\nmario and now it's getting blurry man i\ndon't know why just\nit's everything you should pour it in\nthe chair like when you do that is when\nit gets bored all right that's okay all\nright\nand now it's like i have seen some\ngrowth from\nstreaming um and now i i'm\nbefore i wasn't really comparing or\nsorry before i was comparing\nand then i saw some growth you know from\nworld record\nand now it's like i thought that i\nsolved it because i wasn't doing it\nanymore but now i'm finding like\nnew things to compare to other streamers\nthat are bigger you know it's always\nlike the climb\nand it's just it feels awful and that\nthat's part of the thing that pushes the\nmomentum sometimes like\nit's it's not even about like should i\nget a plate of chips\nit's like i'm comparing and then the\nnext thing i know i'm like eating and\nthen i'm up late\nif that makes sense at all yeah explain\nthat to us a little bit\nso\nlike up late at night and i'm looking at\nmy stats\nand then i'm thinking about other\nstreamers who are around my size who are\nbigger than me or who have like grown\nfaster than me and just looking at their\nsize just like literally just looking at\nthe stats looking back and forth and\nbeing like okay\ni i'm not as i'm not growing as fast or\nlike\ni'm not seeing like growth that i want\nand then\ni mean it seems so obvious like looking\nback on it now but in the moment it\nfeels like\nit just makes perfect sense like i'm not\nit's not like egotistical\nbut or it's not like negative but that's\nlike the subtle thoughts\nyep so let me ask you a question why do\nyou look at the stats late at night\nit's like when i end stream i finish\nstream and then i'll like look at my\nstats\nand then be like okay what frame of mind\nare you in when you finish stream\num kind of tired like\nfeeling like i'd accomplish that so now\ni can like turn my brain off kind of\nthing and be lazy\nyep and then when you when your brain is\nin a lazy place\nand you look at stats what happens\ni start comparing myself\nit's just like it's so easy to do it's\nlike automatic like\nand and twitch will do it for you\nthey'll be like oh this stream compared\nto your last stream like it'll say right\nin front like\nless followers or more viewers you know\nand you either feel good or bad but like\ni don't i don't want to have that at all\ni don't want to be like\nhave those good feelings or have those\nbad feelings so we can talk about you\nknow\nthe nature of your confidence and\njealousy and all that kind of crap\nbut today i want to focus on the process\nand mechanism of mind\nso first thing that i want to point out\nis that when you're feeling lazy\nand you're out of mana and you look at\nyour stats\nyeah when you're exhausted\nhow able are you to catch the subtle\nthoughts and steer them in a different\ndirection\nnot at all right and so then they start\nto feed\nand they start to grow it's just as\nsimple as when you look at your twitch\nstats\ni would once again i would once again\nbet money that if you looked at twitch\nstats\nif you dedicated a time of your day to\nwork\non your stream not just look at it like\na report card\nbut say like okay how can i grow my\nstream let's do some analysis\nbut you did so with a full mana bar your\nexperience will be completely different\nso maybe don't do it late at night after\ni'm burnt out when i'm not really in a\ngreat place to\nbe doing it exactly right so if you're\nnot in a great place\nyour mind is gonna be exhausted and then\nyou're gonna latch on\nto things that you normally wouldn't\nlatch onto with a clean head\ndefinitely and so as bizarre as that is\nlike it's it's strange but like just the\nfact that you're looking\nand it's hard because i don't know why\nour mind does this but\nour mind feeds us the worst kind of\ninformation when we are the most\nvulnerable\nwhen you're feeling bad about yourself\nis when you go and like you look at like\nthe social media profile of your\nex-girlfriend who cheated on you\nand saw how awesome her life is yeah you\njust wanna\nit's weird i have no idea but it's like\nyou want it to get worse\nyep in a way like a part of you you just\nwant to make it the worst it can be\nabsolutely it's weird right that our\nmind doesn't\nand you let it yeah\nbecause there's like i mean that happens\nlike with friends too like good friends\nlike\nfriends that i really like hanging out\nwith and like talking with you know\nwhen good things happen to them like\nthere is always that side that's like\nman i want i want that to happen to me\nlike i\nlike envy or jealousy and trying to find\na way to like\nyou know sometimes i'm like i'm so happy\nfor you but like i'm really\nlike the way i'm feeling is not exactly\nthat but i don't want to say that\nbecause it's like\nyou're just a bad bad friend if you're\njust like jealous of someone\nyep so i i think uh ryan you have some\nwork left to do my friend\nright so there's something about you and\nand maybe this is a conversation for a\ndifferent day\nbecause i don't know we have if we have\nthe time for it today but to think a\nlittle bit about why can't you be happy\nfor someone else\nbecause something within you is\nunsatisfied\nthat makes sense right it's like when i\nsit down to dinner\nand i eat my meal and then someone else\nis eating their meal and they say wow\nthis is really delicious\nand i can be like oh wow that's awesome\nman i'm glad you really enjoyed it\nbut if i don't have any food and i'm\nbroke and homeless and someone else is\ntalking about how\ntheir food is so delicious it's really\nhard for me to be genuinely happy with\nthat\nfor them all right so what's missing\nyou got to have a good meal you got to\nbe enjoying what you're eating then you\ndon't care\nlike yeah i think i've the jealousy has\ndefinitely been worse\nafter the world record than before for\nsure because i felt like way more\nfulfilled\nduring the grind that makes sense\nand so there's something left where like\nyou had to conquer some demons\nto be able to walk away from on paper\nwhat seemed like a wonderful opportunity\nfor a master's degree\nand live your life and you've achieved\nand it sounds also like you had to do\nsome emotional work\naround conquering your tendonitis in\nyour carpal tunnel\nyeah but i think there's definitely a\nconversation that needs to be had about\nlike\nwhy are you unsatisfied with the life\nthat you have\nand i think you know the answer yeah\nyeah got a code gotta feed my soul\na little bit more i don't i don't think\nthat that's the entirety of it\ni think that something happened to you\nthat left you very unsatisfied you felt\nlike you got a bad beat\ni think that there's there's some\nexpectation in your life that has been\ndashed\nyeah think about that it's probably the\nworld record like i had this big\ngoal and then i finally achieved it and\nthen like nothing really changed\ni got surprised how little i felt after\ngetting it\nfelt like a void kind of\ninteresting i would suspect that\nsomething happened even earlier in your\nlife and that it's not related to the\nworld record at all\nbut definitely you know you're saying\nthat the world record felt\nkind of like a let yeah i mean in the\nmoment it felt amazing but like the\nfollowing days it's like\nokay now what yeah so then now what is\nalso\nsome part of your being telling you now\nwhat let's do something else\nwhich is okay i have a question\nabout like when is there any like\nquestion i can ask\nmyself when i to to check\nlike if i'm in the state of am i sewing\nlike negative or positive karma is there\na way\nto check or do you just have is it just\ndepend on the thought like\nbetter ways to tell okay is this going\nto be bad or good\nyes i think it's not so much a question\nbut a state of mind\nso i'd say that the two things to look\nat is am i experiencing negative emotion\nand is ego present here\nright so it's about looking at\nexpectation it's about looking at ego\nit's about looking at your internal\nstate of self\nand if you're behaving from a tranquil\ncenter\nthen you'll sow positive karma\nand if you're behaving from a\nnon-tranquil center then you'll sow\nnegative karma\nand i would really like so i think a\ngood example is like really look at\nyourself when you finish stream\nwhy do you want to look at stream stats\nthen\nit's just like it's become a habit over\ntime i guess i don't doubt it but why\ndid you start\ni'm not sure i mean i think it's just\nlike a natural thing you want to see if\nyou're growing or not you want to see if\nyou're doing good\nsee there's reasons there\nyou want to see if you're growing or not\nthat's expectation it's about benchmarks\nyou know and i do think it's important\nto do as a streamer like you've got to\nlook at your stats\nbut like you want to do so like i would\ncheck your stats like once a week\nthat's a good idea and also compile it\nwith like okay what are strategies like\ndon't just look at other people and be\nlike driven by jealousy in a sense of\nwhether you're falling behind or not\nrecognize that as a streamer you need to\ndo some things to grow your stream\nand sit down i mean this is in a sense\ni'm lucky because\nlike i don't worry about growing my\nstream like someone is kind enough to\nhelp me do that\nso they worry about all that [ __ ] and\nfor them like so it's it's nice because\ni like literally in my life i've been\nlucky enough to separate out the stream\ngrowth from the actual streaming\nis nice and and not everyone has that\nprivilege\nand so i'm grateful for it and at the\nsame time you've got to do that\ncognitively\nyeah be your own like stream producer\nfor some hours of the day and i'd even\ngo as far as to say like\ni don't know if you adhere to a schedule\nor a calendar but i'd block off time and\nbe like okay i'm gonna look at three\nother streamers and try to figure out\nwhat are they doing that i want to do\njust the same way that you did it with\nwith super mario 64.\nwhich is not to compare yourself but\nlike be like okay what are the tricks\nthat they're using that i could think\nabout implementing\nwhat do i want to go with what do i not\nwant to go with sit down look at all\nyour stream stats\nokay because one of the most dangerous\nthings we see this in our coaching\nprogram is like we collect a lot of\nfeedback\nbut we don't share it with our coaches\nright away can you imagine why\ncollect a lot of feedback but you don't\nshare it with the coaches\nright away\nno so if we share bad feedback too\nquickly\nit's going to bias them the next session\nsure right so what we want to do is\naggregate feedback\nand look at trends not\nnot let people get biased because anyone\ncan have a bad day\nbut if i share a bad feedback what kind\nof karma am i sewing for them for the\nnext week\nmore like they'll they'll be in their\nhead more they won't be able to just do\nthe task they're going to be like\ni want to keep i want to be with coach\nyep\ni want to do good and then that will\ninevitably be bad\nyep right so we actually are careful\nwith how\nhow we share our data so we amalgamate\nit and we look for trends\nbut anyone can have an off day and any\nclient can be\nupset on a particular day or not feel\nlike they were helped\nthat's good i got to get the big sample\nsize example\nand the problem is that when you're out\nof mana at the end of the day\nand you look at your stats your mind has\na cognitive bias towards the negative\nand then over time it creates the\nimpression that you're doing a bad job\nokay because not only is there\ninsufficient sample size there's\nselectivity of the data that you collect\nand we do this to ourselves all the time\nright like there are people like in our\ncommunity who have\na lot of evidence that they're going to\ndie alone\nand sure like that evidence is there\nit's just incomplete or it's selective\nsure biased yep and it's because they\nlook for it at that time when they're\nlike they're feeling bad about\nthemselves so let me go hit myself in\nthe nuts\nand look at how my best friend is now\ndoing awesome\nand i'm a piece of [ __ ] and then it\nconfirms for them right oh i'm a piece\nof [ __ ]\nsee here's data right here let me go\nlook at that other guy who's also\nsuccessful oh see\nthey're doing better you never compare\nyourself to the\nthe streamers that stopped streaming six\nmonths ago do you\nno\nwhy not\nbecause they're not streaming you wanna\njust compare with whoever's around\nwhoever you can see\nwhoever you hear about yeah but you're\nnot it's not a fair sample size because\nwhen you started streaming let's say 10\nmonths ago\nsome people washed out yeah and so\nyou're\nalways comparing yourself to people\nabove you and it gives you a really\nreally bad sense of where you truly are\nthat's true you gotta watch out for all\nthese biases man they're a lot\ni'm biased so really simply what i would\nsay you should do is is really pay\nattention to the way that you\nfeel when you're looking at data\nespecially at the end of streams\nokay because i think your jealousy\ndrives your data collection\ndefinitely and that is not good\ncollection\nskewed skewing it okay\nright and then if you skew data\ncollection driven by jealousy\nwhat is it going to do to the feelings\nof jealousy\namplify them and then what's going to\nhappen to the kind of data you collect\nit's going to be bad and eventually will\nspiral\nsmall karma big fruit\n10 more karmas more jealousy more data\nskewing\nmore jealousy data skewing\ngot it and now we get to watch any of\nour streams with\npopular streamers and you'll see that\nall of them have [ __ ] impostor\nsyndrome\nyeah it's like why is that it's because\nthese mechanisms are happening in your\nmind\nany other undesirable traits you want to\ntalk about\num i mean that's probably the biggest\none is\njust like the jealousy thing so\nconcretely for jealousy the two things\ni'd say to you one is be careful about\nthe way that you reinforce it\nright so we just talked about that\nsecond is i would do whatever that mind\nbody prescription\nbook told you to do i would consider\ndoing that again but\nfocusing on jealousy if you want to come\nback on stream we can dig into that\ntogether\nokay or you can kind of do it on your\nown but i think that that jealousy is a\nsome squad i don't know how much how\nmany of our streams that you watch\nbut we've talked about um you can check\nout our youtube channel on the vedic\npsychology\nor like the vedic model of the mind but\ni think you have\ndo you have like a specific video on\nthat like i've heard you say subscribe\nyep so let me see if i can find it\nactually\nlet's see if any of our mods are around\ni can do some digging afterwards okay\naround actually actually what you should\ndo is go\nto our wiki because i think there's a\nlink in information on our wiki\nokay okay yeah here's the link\ni'm going to post in a twitch chat okay\nokay\num and then just look at some scar and\nthen yeah let's see if we can\nyep yeah there's there's a link in there\nso the wiki's had to do it\nright sweet i'll check that out\num yeah so any other questions\nuh how much time do you have uh about\n10 15 minutes what's up i think the last\nthing something i forgot to mention is\nlike going deeper with\nmeditation or like meditating on\nthose undesirable traits like obviously\noutside of meditation is one thing but\nam i able to like tackle the jealousy\nlike inside of meditation like\nabsolutely\nyeah so you want to tackle jealousy yeah\nwhat kind of meditation do you do for a\nwhile i was doing zen and then\ni saw you do third eye and that that was\nlike a really good\nsession for me and so i've started doing\nthat since so that's okay\nall i've done third eye meditation is\nvery well suited for you\nright so i would encourage you to do it\nagain i can teach you another third eye\npractice today if you want\nsure so i'm gonna combine two things\nokay the first\nis so i would feel the\nthe you can dissolve you can both\nuse meditation to dissolve and to\nunderstand the jealousy\nthird eye is not going to be about\ndissolving third eye is going to be\nabout understanding\nokay so what i would do is put yourself\ninto a particular meditative state\nthat is cultivated by a third eye\npractice and then\ngenerally direct your intent i don't\nknow if that makes sense to you or not\nbut you know when you get into a\nmeditative state\nyou're kind of there but not there\nokay and then just let the jealousy come\nand from that state experience the\njealousy\ni know it's kind of hard to describe but\nit's like this is hard to you just have\nto do it\nand then you'll kind of get a sense of\nit so if you've been doing you've been\ndoing this\ncharging the laser beam practice yeah\nokay can you breathe in and out through\nyour nose\nyes can you tell which of your nostrils\nis more open than the other\ni think my left nostril okay go ahead\nand check with a finger\nor you write\nyeah okay so i want you to sit up\nstraight\nokay so when you do the charging the\nlaser beam practice\nwhat do you feel\nlike once i'm there where i'm kind of\nfeeling the sensation in my forehead\nyeah what does the sensation feel like\nit's like a tingling\npretty much just like a tingling in my\nforehead feels like very exaggerated\nfeeling like almost a bump or something\nlike there's just\nyeah a lot of okay so that's good\nso you're awakening your third eye which\nis great\nbrought it out there so now what i'm\ngoing to teach you to do is just clean\nout\nthat area so that it it'll facilitate\nthe growing okay okay\nso it's not going to directly help but\nit'll help you a little bit\nand then as your third eye as you grow\nin your third eye practice\nyou'll understand your jealousy it'll\nsort it out\ndon't worry about it okay so i want you\nto close your eyes\nit's actually a pretty simple practice\nand i want you to feel that\ncool air in your open nostril\ncan you feel the coldness of the air hmm\nyeah and where do you feel it\nit's like right at the base of the\nnostrils okay so eyes closed\nand now i want you to focus sort of on\nthe middle of your nose\nsort of the bridge of your nose and try\nto feel the coldness there\ncan you feel it\nand now i want you to follow that\ncoldness all the way up\nto your third eye the center of your\nforehead\ncan you feel the coolness there\nyeah so what i want you to do is just\nsort of imagine\nthat you're cleaning out that area\nwith that breath so that cool air\ntravels\nup\nand then out\nand we'll do this for about 30 to 60\nseconds\njust follow each breath as it travels\nup into your the middle of your forehead\nif you get distracted just return to\nthat sensation of coolness in your\nforehead\nthat fresh air kind of traveling in\ncleaning it out\nand now we're gonna go to uh our\ncharging the laser beam practice\nso take your right hand your middle\nfinger\nand hover it above the point\nand just focus on the sensation you want\nto be about\na quarter inch to half an inch away from\nyour skin\nyou can move closer and just focus on\nthe sensation of your forehead\nwe'll do this for about a minute or two\ngo ahead and let your hand rest and\ncontinue focusing on the sensation\nyou feeling it yeah\nnow we're going to go to the third phase\nof the practice\nso what i want you to do is take your\neyes\nand with your lids closed look towards\nthat point on your forehead where you\nfeel the sensation\nso you're almost going to be looking up\nand cross side\ndrive your attention towards your third\neye\nyou may feel a strain or a dizziness\nso you need to relax your eyes\nand then return again\ndon't hold it too long\ndrive your attention towards that point\nwith your vision\nyou can hold the gaze for about five to\nten seconds at a time and then relax\nnow let yourself relax\ngood\nbask in the person that you are\nand now notice how foreign\njealousy may feel\nand if it arises for you let it arise\nwhen you're ready go ahead and open your\neyes\nhello hey man how you feeling\ni feel very good what was it like when\nyou\nwere looking cross-eyed at\nthe third eye i'd never done that part\nit felt it didn't really feel dizzying\nit just felt like i was focusing extra\nhard\nand i found that that tranquil spot\njust like pure joy\nyes great fantastic\npure joy and connected is ultimately you\nknow you can't be doing it wrong if\nthat's how you feel\nbut um yeah so so focusing extra hard\nis the point so another thing that you\nguys should understand is you all should\nnot do that third part\nunless you've been doing the other parts\nfirst\nso in your case uh it doesn't surprise\nme\nryan that you've been doing third eye\nmeditation and now you can\nyou can push harder towards it\nso should i be doing that that eye thing\nlike you do it in phases like first\nget like the sensation and then start\nlooking up there yep\nyou can do it in that sequence so you\ncan do the should be practice first\nwhich is breathing into it and then out\nand then\nusing the charging of the laser beam and\nthen then\nyou can i mean the charging laser beam\nyou actually you may not even need to do\nthat anymore at all\nyeah um and and then you can direct your\nattention with your gaze\nbut that too you want to be careful you\ndon't want to strain your eyes or\nanything like that\nit's just i don't know how to describe\nit but for me it feels like\nyou know i'm turning the hose on high\nand then i turn it down to low\ndoes that make sense uh not entirely\nokay\ni mean yeah don't worry about it\nokay it's just different different\nexplanations for\ni mean someone in chat came up with\ncharging the laser beam\nwhich i think is actually a pretty good\ndescription of what it feels like\nthat's how it feels yeah and so you know\ndifferent words for these strange\nsensations that we don't know how to\ndescribe\nbut overall\num thanks for coming on man thank you\nfor having me\nyeah of course i've been following since\num i saw reckful's video first and\nyour videos have done a lot for me and\ni'm sure you're helping a lot of people\nso thank you very much for having me on\nand you definitely helped me\ncool good luck to you man and thank you\nand you know i i i'm\nhopeful about this next phase i think\nyou can handle it but i don't think it's\ngoing to be easy it's going to be hard\nin a subtle way\nyeah that makes sense definitely yeah so\ngood luck to you dude\nthank you and congrats on the world\nrecord that blows my mind\nthank you very much take care man have a\ngood one\nbye-bye okay\nso this is a little bit different"
