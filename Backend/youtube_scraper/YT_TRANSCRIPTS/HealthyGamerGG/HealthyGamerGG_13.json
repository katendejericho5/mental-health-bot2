    "transcript": "human beings I guess since the dawn of\ntime procrastinated on going to bed and\nthis procrastination was somewhere\nbetween 30 and 75 minutes and since the\nAdvent of things like cell phones and\neasy access to devices what we've\ndiscovered is that there is a second\nlevel of procrastination so you\nprocrastinate getting into bed by about\n30 to 75 minutes that's fair enough but\nthen once you are in bed there is within\nbed procrastination which is another 30\nto 75 minutes and the key thing about\nadding this second layer of\nprocrastination is it puts us outside of\nthat fatigue and impulse control window\nthat really nice sweet spot which then\nmeans that we can't really control what\nwe're doing and we stay up way too long\nso the first thing to do if you want to\nfix your sleep schedule is really try to\nTarget that window and recognize that if\nyou pick up your cell phone you\nshouldn't take your cell phone to bed\nthat's a very practical tip which we'll\nget to at the end but if you miss that\nwindow it's not just I'm going to stay\non the phone for an additional 15\nminutes or 30 minutes it's not 15 or 30\nminutes it's actually going to cost you\nway more"
