    "transcript": "thank you he's very sweet he uh\nhas some bad anxiety himself but he's\ngood\nyeah i i recently heard that um that you\nknow people will give\nuh dogs like anti-anxiety medication\nyeah he could use some\ni think um i've tried like cbd treats\nfor him but it just puts him to sleep so\nyeah that does no good so he's fine he's\njust a stress case\ni i once tried to play a joke on my boss\nwhen i was in training\nthat i wanted to do pet therapy\n[Laughter]\nand and so people think that pet therapy\nis like when you have like a therapy\nsupport animal right\nand so like it's like you know i want to\nyou know work with animals to help\npeople with mental health\nbut then i tried to explain her no no i\ndon't want to i don't want to do pet\ni don't want to do therapy with pet i\nwant to be a pet therapist\nso i want to i want a dog so if we're\ngiving them medication\nwe should also do psychotherapy with\nthem and so have a dog come to my house\nit could be it could be his stream\nhe's not happy about it yeah he seems a\nlittle bit\nanxious or something yeah\num so and and how do i refer to you\num you can call me blair blair okay\nand um blair i'm all oak or people call\nme dr k\nyou can call me either one okay um\nand so tell me a little bit thank you\nvery much for coming on on stream\nof course and tell tell me a little bit\nabout what we're talking about today\nor if there's something um goodness\nthat is so hard yes um\nno what yeah sorry yeah\num i uh i don't know\ni don't know i i think i like talked in\nthe dms\num about like some different things we\ncould touch on i don't\ni just like my biggest as stupid as this\nis and i know i shouldn't be worried\nabout this\ni'm just like so worried about like\nlike i talk about mental health on my\nstream all the time because like uh\nso i have i've had uh like generalized\nanxiety\num it used to be really severe for\nlike probably around six years at this\npoint um but i've gotten much better at\nit\num but so i talk about anxiety a lot\nplus i went through\nuh i have like a really bad hypochondria\nthat is backed up by like really cool\nocd tendencies so i get like i can\nspiral out of kind of like control\nessentially and just get\nwrapped up in a bunch of irrational\nthoughts and so i had like\na big episode of that like a year ago\nand so i like talked my stream a lot\nabout\nmental health and so it's like i talk\nabout mental health a lot um\nbut i i the interesting thing is since\ni'm on twitch\nwhenever i do talk about mental health i\ndelete um\nlike i delete my vods afterwards because\ni don't want to be harassed over it does\nthat make sense\nsure so it's weird to like it's not\nweird but it's like\nit's different to like come on here\nand be like okay we're talking about it\nand there's you know like\nnot no going back but like we're gonna\nbe productive about it\nwell i mean so first let me start by\nsaying we can go back\nright so if if anything happens that\nyou're not comfortable with or things\nlike that we can\nstop uh him down\nthat's okay um so so\nyou know we can we can always pull the\nplug\nokay right that's that's fair\num i don't want you to feel i mean i\nimagine you're gonna feel pressured but\ni don't want you to\ngive in to the pressure and if we talk\nabout something that's uncomfortable or\nmaking you uncomfortable\nthat's totally cool like we can stop or\nwhat may\nactually be useful is for us to\nunderstand what makes you uncomfortable\nand where that comes from\nyeah okay um so what i'm set like have\nyou been harassed over it before\num the my biggest thing\nis i think i think\ni'm kind of like a perfectionist and so\nbeing on the internet\nis just hard in general because the\nthings that they can harass you over\nis like so minuscule and\nto try to not get wrapped up in that is\nexhausting i guess um to try to like\ndehumanize yourself\nbecause you want to be a streamer and\nyou want to be successful\num like it\nso it's like i've gotten harassed over\nthe weirdest things like i\ni have the word bald band in my chat\nbecause like people would come in and\nthey'd be like oh cutie cinderella you\nlook like you're balding or\nare you going bald and so then like i\nwas so\ndistraught by this like i went to\nmultiple doctors i like\nwent to a plastic surgeon i had multiple\npeople i've like looked into rogaine\nlike i'm so concerned about going\nbald and it's like the craziest things\nthat can just like trigger this\nthis train of thoughts that it's just\nit's like it's so\nannoying because it's like uh you want\nto be a human on the internet but it\nseems impossible sometimes\nwow that sounds so you you seem like you\nhave\nsomewhat of a\nyou gotta let me know so if i say\nsomething out of line you gotta let me\nknow and i okay\ni don't mean to be mean but it sounds\nlike you've got a couple of like things\nthat are really like\ncoalescing and and feel pretty bad like\nit sounds awful like if you've got\nsome amount of hypoch chondriasis or ocd\nand then like that sounds like a\nterrible combination\nwith people picking random [ __ ] and\nmaking memes out of it because it sounds\nquite like it like one feeds the other\ndoes that make sense\nno it does it's it's it's like it's\nexhausting\nin a way um especially like uh\ni uh it's weird because like to grow on\nthis platform\nand i kind of talked about this on my\nstream last night to grow on this\nplatform\nit's like you have to have so many\nrealms of like social media like you\nhave to post on instagram you have to\npost on twitter you have to\ndo all these things and to do that with\nconfidence\nis so scary i guess is the word like\ni uh i can't like i i just can't take\npictures of myself because if i post it\npeople are going to call me names and if\nthey don't call me names and they think\nthat i'm full of myself because i'm\nposting pictures of myself it's like\nthere's always two\nthoughts going into everything and so it\nfeels like there's never any right\nanswer\nyou seem really really conflicted yeah\nlike you want to talk about mental\nhealth and then you pull off the bond\nyeah like you need to be human and\nauthentic but being human and authentic\nscrews you yeah that sounds tough\ni i don't know how you navigate the\nworld without a right answer\nyeah and it's like in everything i do i\nfeel like i never\ni feel like i'm never confident in\nwhat i should be saying what i should be\ndoing\nin myself like sometimes\nsometimes i'll be streaming and\ni'll feel fine i'll feel fine and then\nit's like i i don't think i don't think\nchat realizes because i\ni don't know if you've heard this from\nother streamers before but it's like\nyou get that like people are like oh\njust don't read the don't read chat\nforehead right like\njust don't read it and you're like oh\nokay but like\nhow i've always explained it is like\ni'll be sitting there playing\nmario and someone will say\nuh like someone will just come in and be\nlike who's this ugly [ __ ]\nlike literally that's all they'll say\nand you're like okay cool band whatever\nyou know like let's just move on i'm\nplaying a\nvideo game like why are why are my looks\npart of this conversation and then\na few minutes later somebody else comes\nin and like oh she looks stupid or like\nand it's just like a constant like\nbanging over the head to the point that\ni'm like well i need to end stream\nlike i just i can't do it anymore and so\nit's like\ni guess my question is like what do you\nlike how do you how do you like how can\nyou be successful\nwhen it gets so hard to even\nstay live or stay in front of people um\nin that capacity it's a great question\ncan i think for a second yeah for sure\ni mean so the first thought that i have\nis like when people say just don't read\nchat\nthat defeats the purpose of twitch yeah\nright without chat you're just playing\nvideo games by yourself\nthat's not what twitch is about twitch\nis about chat\nchat is like chat is like what twitch is\nabout right\nyeah kinda weird um\nbecause without twitch chat it's just\nplaying video games\nso and then the other thing that i'm\nhearing from you is\nhow do you continue to stream when\npeople say things\nto you i mean what i'm hearing from you\nis that like you have a health bar\nand that sometimes when people say\ncertain things\nyou like lose some hp and then\neventually you run out of hp and then\nyou can't stream anymore\nis that fair to say yeah and i think\nit's like\nthere's a big part that i feel like\npeople don't\ni feel like people don't even know and\nmaybe i'm just too sensitive of a person\nbut it's like i don't think people know\nall the time what they're saying and why\nit's hurtful like\ni am i'm friends with other streamers so\npeople will come in my chat and they'll\nsay hey what is\nso and so doing and it's like i'm like\ndon't use me as your way to get to\nsomebody else like you know what i'm\nsaying like\nit makes me feel so inhuman like just go\nto\nlike go to their chat like you don't\nhave to ask me or\nor like uh i don't know just say like\nthere's just like this game of comparing\ntoo so it's like\nlike again i'm friends with lots of\nstreamers so people will come in and\nthey'll be like oh you have less viewers\nthan\nthan so and so you know and it's just\nlike it's this never-ending game of like\ncomparing yourself\nto people and maybe that's my fault like\nmaybe i shouldn't think of it that way\num but that how it that's how it like\nfeels a lot is that i'm constantly\nlike in order to be successful i have to\nbe this and why am i not\nat a thousand viewers is it because of x\ny and like\nand so then i look at the people that\nare at a thousand viewers and what are\nthey doing that i'm not doing and it's\njust like this\nconstant train of like\nnever-ending thoughts if that makes\nsense yeah so if i were to\nto he\nif i were to recap what i heard so what\ni'm hearing is what i would call a lot\nof should thoughts\nso like you should be doing this there's\na lot of comparison\nyeah you should be streaming more you\nshould be on instagram you should be\nthis you should be this you should be\nthis\nwhat do you think about that um\ni think i think\ni think i just like i've always been a\nvery hard worker um\nand so like twitch has never been my\nfull-time job until recently\nso i just actually put in my two weeks\ndue to covid\ni've been like working and not getting\npaid for the past two months so finally\ni was like okay i'm gonna put in my two\nweeks i'm gonna do this twitch thing\nhere we go i haven't like my two weeks\nisn't up yet but\ni've always said to myself that i\ncouldn't handle twitch mentally\num as a full-time job so i'm like i'm\nvery scared\nand it's also like i've always been\nsuccessful at anything i've ever done\nlike i was\ntop in my company i was in an interior\ndesign firm and it's like\ngoing into twitch knowing that i'll\nnever be the top is kind of like\nvery daunting because i guess i think i\nlike\ni find and i've said this to a lot of\npeople because i felt very defeated like\nquitting my job because i find my\nself-worth\n100 in oh she is successful and now i'm\nnot that\nand so it's like well now who am i\nthat seems weird to say out loud but\nyeah\nwhat are you feeling disappointed\nin yourself yeah\nand what is disappointing about you\ni don't know um i just feel like\nthis sounds dumb um\ni just feel like\ni i feel like\ni'm like trying to climb a mountain that\nlike there isn't\nnecessarily like a top to and i don't\nknow how i'm gonna do it\nand i don't know why i'm putting myself\nin that situation if i like\nlike i'm a planner and what gives me\nlike with ocd you probably know this\nwhat like gives me\ncomfort is knowing that there is a plan\nand if i know there's not a plan\nthen i can get very wrapped up in just\nthese horrible trains of thoughts and\nlike\nthen that's where like my ocd tendencies\ncome in like okay well if i drink a\ncoffee\nbefore i go live every day my stream's\ngonna be better and then that turns into\nif i drink a coffee with this amount of\ncreamer in it then my stream is gonna be\nbetter and then it's like if i use this\ncup\nthen it slowly compounds all these\npatterns that i just start using as a\nway of comfort\nbecause that's the only way that i have\ncontrol in the situation because in\nreality i have so much limited control\nof what i can do it\nlike it it drives me crazy\nokay excellent\nblair you're doing great\nand i'm hopeful for you i feel weird\nyes i can imagine so what feels weird\nright now um\ni don't know i'm worried that this is\nlike i'm worried that this is stupid i'm\nworried that\npeople don't like i'm worried that\npeople like\nas stupid as like i've worn that people\nthink it's boring i worry that people\nare like this is dumb why are we talking\nabout this like\ni don't know okay let me tell you why\nwe're talking about it i think this is\ngreat\nokay there's so much to say i just\nokay here's the issue so you lack\nconfidence okay so let's just think\nabout\nwhat that does to someone so\nhere's why you try to control so there\nare a lot of things going on first is\nthat you try to control things you're\nperfectionistic you have anxiety\nhow does all that [ __ ] fit together and\nwhat does that have to do with\nconfidence\nwhat does that have to do with your\nfeelings of disappointment i'm going to\ntry to lay it out usually i lay things\nout at the end\nbut now i'm gonna try to lay things out\nat the beginning because you've done\nsuch an awesome job\nof showing us what's in your mind so\nlet's try to piece it together\nso the first thing is\nlet's say that like i'm good at like\nhunting and foraging\nand taking care of myself and i'm\nconfident that i can survive in the\nwilderness\nhow much preparation do i have if i go\ncamping\nhow much preparation do i need let me\nask ask that\num i mean a lot\nis sort of writing yeah\nmaybe it's a bad example um so so i\ni guess what i mean to say is generally\nspeaking\nif i'm confident in myself i don't have\nto control a whole lot of variables\nokay does that make sense yes\nhow so um\ni think of it like uh one thing i'm okay\nat\nis like baking and so it's like if i\nbake\ni don't need like i can just i can just\nstart doing it\nbecause i've done it for years so i\nnever like yeah\nexactly right so so like like how bad is\nyour ocd or your anxiety when it comes\nto baking\nnot bad okay so this is important\nbecause if you're confident in yourself\nthen you know that you can handle the\nchallenges that come\nand if you're not confident in yourself\nthat leads to let's call it anxiety and\nocd although i don't really know if it's\nocd\nbut uh what that means is that you have\nto control\neverything because you're not assured of\nthe result like you have to have your\ncoffee with x amount of creamer\nand that removes a little bit of\nuncertainty from the equation so you're\nyou fight a war against uncertainty\nevery day\nand the reason that you have to fight\nthat war is because\nif we think about like what is how how\ndo we define confidence\nconfidence is like literally the ability\nto face uncertainty\nif i go out fishing and i know that i\nknow how to fish\ni don't have to control a whole lot i'm\nlike i'm going to grab my fishing rod\ni'm going to grab some bait\nand i'm going to figure it out you have\nfaith in yourself that you're gonna\nfigure it out\nyou don't need the world to give you\ncertainty because you\nhave faith that you can handle it\nwhatever comes\nso the first thing is that you know\ni think you try to exert a lot of\ncontrol because if we think\nabout it like control is an antidote to\nanxiety\nwhat is anxiety it's like i worry this\nis going to happen i worry this is going\nto happen i worry this is going to\nhappen\nand so how do we deal with those worries\nwhat we do is we control those things\nright if i if i have a hat on people may\nnot comment\nabout me being bald yeah right\nso yeah so we control all kinds of\nlittle variables\nto remove those anxieties out of the\nequation\nthe funny thing is that every time we\ncontrol a variable\nto get rid of a little bit of anxiety\nwas that hurtful when i said no you're\nokay\nyou're okay uh\nis that why you wear a hat uh\na lot of the time yeah right so see like\nso so we can see that what\nso here's the problem though i'm sorry i\ndidn't i didn't mean to make you feel\nself-conscious\nno you're okay um so\ni mean i i did mean that i used it\ni used that as an example because i i\nthink i think it's a perfect example\nyeah okay and they're your camera okay\nthere we go so so the\nthe reason that we do that look look at\nme don't look at chat\nminimize chat you know what's great chat\nno i was looking over at my twitter i'll\nminimize that okay um so\nhere's the thing so you have this beast\nof anxiety which is based on confidence\nbut if you control the variables and\nremove those from the equation what\nhappens to your sense of confidence when\nyou do something\nwhen i do anything so so let's say that\nyou\nstream and you're concerned about having\na bad stream so you drink your cup of\ncoffee\nand then you have a good stream how\nconfident are you the next time\ni'm not absolutely now this is an\ninteresting question why not\num because i never know who's gonna come\nand chat i never know who's gonna be\nrude to me today i never know\nwhat they're gonna be offended by i\nnever know if they're gonna be mad that\ni'm wearing too much makeup or not\nenough makeup or they're gonna tell me\nagain like\nhow [ __ ] small my tits are because\nthey're smaller than the other girls on\nthis platform like it's exhausting\nokay so that is that is the\nmanifestation the all of those thoughts\nare the manifestation of your lack of\nconfidence\nthat's what lack of confidence grows\ninto\nright but here's my question if you have\na good stream\nand people don't say those kinds of\nthings why does that not lead to\nconfidence\nbecause one would think that a success\nshould lead to confidence\nbut in your case it doesn't um why i\ndon't know people ask me that like\ni think my mom my mods ask me that all\nthe time they'll be like cutie there's a\nhundred nice comments in chat\nwhy does one make you stop stream you\nknow what i'm saying like\nit's just like it's so it's frustrating\nlike i don't know\nlike i don't know but it's like i guess\ni i\ni think it's like for example when\npeople say like oh\nlike cutie you're not funny that one\ndoesn't hurt me because i'm like\nno i'm funny you know like i know i'm a\nfunny person but like\nwhen people come in and they're like\ncutie\nlooks like you've gained weight or\nlike all these superficial things it's\nlike well i can't control that as much\nas i try like i've always looked this\nway\nokay i'm gonna try to i'm gonna try to\ndraw\nall right so this could end poorly um\nso give me a second because i think this\nis important\nall right so let me start can i uh\n[Music]\nwhat do i need\nsorry sorry about this you're okay i'm\nexcited\ni think i'm gonna try to teach you\nsomething\nso the question is okay so there are\nsome things so let's like try to\nunderstand\nthe the nature of confidence okay\nand where confidence comes from okay\nso here's the thing so there's some\nthings that you're confident about like\nbaking\nand being funny so what i want to point\nout to you is that when your confidence\nlevel let's let's say you have low\nconfidence\nand then this leads to anxiety\nor ocd and then this leads to\ncontrolling things actually let me put\nthis here\nso let's say that your anxieties are\nwhere at actually that's wrong\nsorry i'm trying to figure this out as i\ngo okay you're okay so\nbalding wait\nand then what's something else that\nyou're\nyou said a couple of things uh just like\nmy face in general\npeople will say i look like a horse um\nthe [ __ ] okay so these these are the\nanxieties\nthese are the manifestations of anxiety\ndo you understand what i mean by\nmanifestation of anxiety\num like where they live yeah so like\nyou're\nyou have anxiety and then it like\nit bears fruit like a particular thought\ndoes that make sense like so you're\nanxious about balding your weight\ncomparison\nhorse face whatever yeah then what\nhappens is in order to reduce so this is\nhigh anxiety\nin order to reduce the anxiety\nwhat you do is you exert control yeah\nright so wear hat\num you know uh careful\nabout shapeliness\nyeah i'll usually throw on a hoodie or\nlike\nbeautiful right so we can call that we\nknow that's gonna happen\nokay so then what happens is that your\nanxiety kind of goes down\nright yeah so then something weird\nhappens so so we have all of our control\nfactors\nso now what we're going to do is this\nand then so you control for all of these\nthings\nright so let's move that down here and\nthen let's say that this results in\nhaving a good stream see i'm even i'm\nscared to like say these things like\neven on the internet like i'm scared to\nbe like oh i hate when you guys\nsay that i'm balding i hate when you\nguys say that i'm fat i hate when you\nguys say that i'm ugly because i feel\nlike it just encourages people\nto like do it for a 10 you know so i\nfeel like my my chat is going to be\na disaster when i stream again like i\ni'm\nvery nervous about that yeah so so i\nunderstand that you're nervous\nand i think unfortunately some of that\nanxiety is warranted\nyeah okay and and so i'm not going to\ntell you not to feel nervous because\nsometimes people are [ __ ] on the\ninternet and that's just how it is\nyeah and i'm sorry that you feel that\nway what i am\nhoping is that\nwhat we're doing right now is we're\nwe're rolling the dice\nand my hope honestly blair my hope is\nthat by\nexposing yourself you have the\nopportunity to learn about yourself\nin a way that will help you more than\nthe [ __ ] on the internet can heart\nharm you i see okay how do you feel\nabout that\nuh sounds great\nright so blair my hope is to like\nstart you on the journey today to free\nyourself of this\ngeneral problem yeah i see okay\nso now the question is like if you have\na good stream\ndoes that lead to increase in confidence\nor decrease incompetence\num increase\nincorrect okay that's what it should do\nright\nthis is what we think is gonna happen\nbut what does that actually do to you\nlike this is you just said i asked you\nwhen you have a good stream do you feel\nbetter about yourself and what did you\nsay\ni said i think because it just makes me\nmore nervous that the next one won't be\nas good as the last one\nexactly so this is the first really\nreally important thing to understand\nokay\nis that we think confidence comes\nfrom like if we think confidence comes\nfrom successes\nright but the truth is that somehow this\ndecreases your confidence now that's\nkind of weird because like now like\nlet's just look at the situation that\nwe're doing so like\nhow like this is weird right so then\nwhat happens is like\nbecause here's the thing this\ngoes here right yeah and then anxiety\nincreases\nand then this increases this increases\nthis increases\nthen you control things more and then\nyou have a good stream\nand then your confidence decreases you\nsee how it's a cycle\nuh-huh and this is why you're screwed\nright it's weird\nyeah no it's true it's like like i\ntalked\ni i've given this example before but\nlike i used to\nlike on my personal instagram which has\nlike maybe a hundred followers\nthat i used to use years ago it's like\nif i was feeling very unconfident about\nthe way i looked it was like\ni would i would dress up and i'd put\nmakeup on and i'd take a cute selfie and\nthis was years ago\nlike literally six seven years ago i'd\ntake a selfie and post it and it'd get\nlike 30 likes and i'd be like oh like\npeople think i'm pretty like i'd feel so\ngood about myself\nbut then um there was a guy i was seeing\nat the time and it was like\nnew and he like showed me to his sister\nand his sister like instagram stalked me\nand he said\nwow she must be full of herself because\nshe has lots of selfies\nand so like ever since then now i can't\ntake pictures because it's like this\nbattle of like\nwell i want to be confident but i don't\nwant people to think that i'm a shitty\nperson because i'm trying to be\nconfident so it's it's weird like\nthere's like\nthere's always like a battle between\nlike\nlike trying to be like like happy with\nyourself and then also like\nthe way you present yourself i don't\nknow like it doesn't make sense yes it\nmakes perfect sense and we'll get there\nand this so blair this comes down to the\nbasic issue here\nis that your sense of self-worth is\ndetermined by other people\ni see okay right so like you're taking\nit like so if i'm taking a selfie\nbecause i want to take a selfie\nand and then people say like oh dr k is\nfull of himself because he's taking\nselfies\nlike they're allowed to think that but\nthat's not why i'm doing it\nokay and so like why does the\nwhy do you value the reasons that they\nthink you do it over why you actually do\nit\num right so they think that you do it\nbecause you're a narcissistic [ __ ]\nyeah you do it because you like to take\nselfies\nand so like but what happens is that\nanytime there's like there's a conflict\nbetween you and them\nyou default to their position there are\na hundred people who say nice things to\nyou\nthere's one person who calls you\nmaulding and then\nyou like default to that person yeah\nso that's that's because literally what\nyou're doing is you have an opinion of\nyourself\nand then they have an opinion of you\nuh let's\ntheir opinion and what you do\nis this yes\nright so this is because so this is\nbecause of a lack of confidence so we're\ngoing to get there in a second we'll\ntalk more about that okay\nokay so the first thing that that that i\nmean does that make sense because you\ndon't have faith in yourself\nyou don't have a sense of your intrinsic\nworth i also like i also just like\ni just like as stupid as it is it's like\ni just want\nthem to be happy does that make sense\nlike i said like yeah\nlike right yeah i don't know that you\nwant them to be happier do you want them\nto like you\ni think yeah maybe maybe like me i mean\nbut if you\nlike me then they're happy right\nso now we get to the root of it\nthat's the problem\nthen though\nman blair you're giving me too much i'm\nsorry\nno it's great it's actually really good\nso now the question is\nwhen did you start believing that\npeople liking you made them happy\num that you have to be a particular way\nto make\nother people happy probably like\nhigh school okay so like that's where we\nneed to dig into this belief\nyeah because their happiness does not\ndepend on them liking you\nbut like i understand that you have a\npart of your mind that believes that\nyeah\nright so like this is something that's a\nbig problem in our community which is\nthat\nwe believe first of all that we have the\ncapacity to make\nother people like us and also that we\nhave the capacity to make other people\nhappy\nyeah and the more that you try to get\nthem to like you\nand the more that\nyou try to make them happy the more\nthis increases because you're valuing\nthem\nover yourself and then the question\nbecomes\nwhy do you val does that make sense you\nwith me then the question becomes why do\nyou value yourself\nless than them and that essentially\ncomes back\nto confidence or in this case i would\nput it slightly differently\nworth so blair\nwhat are you worth\nuh i don't know how to answer that\nthat's a hard question right so let me\nput it to you this way\nwhat are you worth when you're the top\nseller at your interior design place\num i am worth\nmillions of dollars absolutely so we're\ngonna call that a lot\nyeah and then what are you worth if you\nno longer have that job\nzero dollars so we're going to call that\nvery little worth\nyeah and now we get to the core of your\nfear which is that your worth as a human\nbeing is not\nintrinsic it's based on external stuff\nyeah and as long as that's true\nas long as like so now i'm gonna turn\nthis off for a second okay\nokay and we're gonna go back to\nthis and we're gonna see your face for a\nmoment maybe we can go back to the ipad\nso here's the thing\nas long as you\ni just see why do i see two of me\nthere we go boom or dr kale catch up at\nsome point\nthank you thank you for letting me know\nthough so here's the thing like like\nas long as your worth is determined by\nexternal things like\nthat that that's the very definition\nof lack of confidence right because like\nconfidence is about\nworth that comes from within okay\nand then the question becomes well how\ndo you get that\nyes you do because because\nwhat is your worth when it comes to\nbaking\n[Music]\nare you good at baking but it's like\nnobody needs that\nnobody needs a cupcake what where the\n[ __ ] do you get that idea i think the\nworld would be\na way better place just think think\nabout what you just said\nyeah because i think the exact opposite\nis true\ni think sometimes\nthe only thing that people need is a\ncupcake\nuh yeah i don't i don't know\ni mean it's like it's so frivolous like\nit's so\nit's not though okay so let me let me\nask you a question so let's say\nhypothetically so i work at an inpatient\npsychiatric hospital\nthere are lots of people there who are\ndepressed suicidal\naddicted with drawing and i go to i go\nto work every day and we talk about\nall of their problems and we adjust\ntheir medications and stuff like that\nhow fun do you think their life is\nnot fun okay what do you think happens\nto their life if i bring in a dozen\ncupcakes and give one to each of my\npatients\ni think they're excited about cupcakes\nabsolutely do i'm telling you do not\nunderestimate the value of a cupcake\ni i have always said that like the\nreason\nthat i'm in to baking is it it it's\nalways been that that way for me to like\nhave an easy way to fit in if that makes\nsense like if i go to a party it's like\ni bring\ncookies and then it's like people are\nlike oh it's the girl that brought\ncookies and so they're like nicer to me\nyeah so i think that's that's tricky\nright because it's feeding into your\ninsecurity so\nhere's kind of the punch line around\nconfidence\nis so if i actually let me ask you this\nso let's say like i'm trying to teach my\nkid to ride a bike\nand she's got training wheels right so\nif i want\nso when she rides a bike the reason that\nshe falls over\nis because she has uh sorry she the\nreason she doesn't fall over\nis because she has training wheels or\nbecause she knows how to ride a bike\num probably because she has training\nwheels\nabsolutely right so if she's anxious\nabout her ability to ride a bike and i\nadd training wheels her anxiety goes\ndown and what happens to her confidence\nshe it's lower because she's relying on\nthe training oils right like she's\nthere we go right okay okay okay so now\nwe're gonna go we're gonna go back\nmy cookies are my training wheels\nabsolutely my friend\nbeautifully beautifully put hold on okay\nnow i gotta try to share this now we're\ngonna go back\nokay can you see this yes\nokay all right so now we're gonna go\nback here oh\nso here's the problem\nwhat happens if you don't wear a hat\n[Music]\nmy forehead looks big okay and then you\nand then you stream yeah and then if you\nhave a good stream then what happens\nif i stream and i'm not wearing a hat\nyep i mean it doesn't matter because\nit's always\nyou know a new person's gonna come in\ntomorrow sure\nwhat happens at the end oh hold on a\nsecond\nhello hey\nhuh\noh sweet okay\ncome on okay\nthere we go fixed thank you\nwhoa\ndamn my producers and tech people are\nlegit\nthat's great okay so here here's the\nthing all right\nso if you um\nso if you don't wear the hat your\nanxiety increases\nbut then what happens is you're taking\nthe training wheels off\nall right yeah okay and here's the\nproblem is that you could have a good\nstream or you could have a bad stream\nyeah but the funny thing is i think\neither way\nyour confidence is going to increase\ninteresting right because like if i if i\nhave my kid and i take the training\nwheels off\nshe could fall yeah it's gonna happen\nyeah but she's not always gonna fall\nand the more she falls or not falls\nthe more she's able to tolerate her\nanxiety because like here's the\ni mean i don't know if you can imagine\nthis but literally like if i talk to her\nabout taking the training wheels off\nshe panics because she's afraid\nyeah she's anxious yes and so\nhere's the thing if you're talking about\novercoming anxiety\nwearing a hat is not overcoming anxiety\nit's feeding into it\nyeah it's making it go away artificially\nyou know if you use drugs or other forms\nof things to like make your art like\nyour anxiety like\nartificially decrease instead of\ngrappling with it\nyour confidence is never going to grow\nall that's going to happen is you're\ngoing to fall into the cycle\nover and over and over again\nand what you need to do unfortunately is\nface\nyour anxiety right and we kind of talk\nabout that and like with with my\ndaughter like what we do is we we\ntake the training wheels off and then we\nexplain to her that hey like you could\nfall but you may not i have faith in you\nif you do fall i'm going to be here and\ni'm going to help you get back up\nand we're going to try again and the\nmore that we do that the more confident\nshe's going to be\ninteresting okay so here's the other\nthing\nwhen it comes to baking and it when it\ncomes to you being funny\ni think somewhere along the way\nyou let yourself crack a junk in spite\nof your anxiety yes\nand when you crack jokes in spite of\nyour anxiety\nthen what happens to your confidence uh\nit goes down\nconfidence goes down or up i think down\ndoesn't it because isn't that just like\na bad coping mechanism\ni don't think so so so here's my thought\nokay so like\ni have a joke\nokay and so then you have low confidence\nright so if you give in to your low\nconfidence stay silent\ntherefore um\ni'm not funny\ndoes that make sense yeah okay so let's\nsay yeah okay\ni am funny this is what you believe\nright like you know you're funny\nyeah so if this route leads to i'm not\nfunny\nhow do we get here so how do you know\nyou're funny\nby making a joke and having people laugh\nat it\nmake a joke but like\nhow did you make a joke if you're not\nconfident\nokay i see now right so the funny thing\nis this is possible too this is\ninaction coping\ngiving in to\ninsecurity\nthis is is insecurity and\nconfidence like this like is being\nsecure and being confident the same\nthing\ni think so okay well sort of\nso so insecure confidence so so let me\njust finish this like\ndo you get how like here either you\ncontrol for factors and don't open\nyourself up to hurt\nwhich is giving in into insecurity or\nyou [ __ ] roll the dice\nyeah and then sometimes you make a joke\ni'm not funny yeah right\nyes but here's the crazy thing is when i\nask you about that blair this is the\nonly time that we've talked about you\nnot doing a good job and what are you\ndoing right now\nlaughing how do you feel right now\nuh how do i feel in this moment\ni don't know i feel okay why because i\njust talked about all the jokes that you\nmade that aren't funny\nand when you remember all the times you\nweren't funny\nhow the [ __ ] are you laughing instead of\nlike falling into your anxiety\nbecause even when they're not funny\nthey're kind of funny\nthat's confidence my friend that's\nit okay\neven when i'm not funny i'm funny that's\nthe [ __ ] nature of confidence\neven when i have a bad stream it's a\ngood stream\neven when people call me balding i'm\ni'm a beautiful person okay\ndo you see how like literally what\nyou're doing right now is something\nthat's very very important and very\nbeautiful to see\nwhich is that you were accepting that\nyou were flawed and you're [ __ ]\nlaughing in its face\nand you're okay with it yeah but that's\neasy like i don't know being funny like\nsaying like accepting your sense of\nhumor is so much easier than like\naccepting the way you look\ndoes that mean is that fair i think it's\nfair\nfor you okay\nright so i'm sure you can imagine that\nthere are people out there\nwho are who\nbeg to differ right there are people out\nthere who are anxious about how funny\nthey are\nokay yeah and maybe don't care so much\nabout their looks\nbut i generally speaking i agree that\nit's easier to be anxious about your\nlooks than it is\nto be about you know being funny i see\ntwo of me again\noh [ __ ] sorry thank you okay\nall right okay so\nbut i i think like so here's the thing\nis i i think you've done it right so\nyou've learned how to gain confidence\nand the key thing is that you got to\nroll the dice at some point\nand the more that you give in to your\nanxiety and this is true of ocd as well\nlike i've worked with some people who\nhave ocd\nand the more they feed their ocd like\nthe stronger it grows\nyeah so the most extreme case of ocd\nthat i've ever heard of\ni'm not a personal person like i don't\neven know if it's real\nso one of my ocd instructors once\ntold me that like someone had such a\nphobia of bugs\nthat they like they like dug\ninto the ground around their bed\nand they dug a trench and they put like\ntoxic chemicals\nthey encircled their bed they moved it\nto the middle of the room they encircled\ntheir bed\nin a moat of toxic chemicals so that\nbugs couldn't fall inside\nthat's kind of hype it's crazy\ni think well i i i'm that way with like\nflying like flying on airplanes is that\nway\nuh like i'll drive 18 hours before i'll\nfly for the sake of avoiding a flight\nyeah and so the interesting thing is\nthat when you do that\nit makes that person feel less anxious\nbecause they feel protected\nyeah but it doesn't actually like it\nmakes your experience of anxiety\nless and it makes the size of the\nanxiety beast in your mind\nbigger yeah yeah\ni understand that i think i think the\nhardest thing is like\num with the confidence is like i i i\nlike\nafter like years of like not\nbeing confident speaking of i think i\njust like picked a zit so that's\nembarrassing um\nyears of not being confident like how i\ndon't i just don't know like it seems it\nseems like such a daunting task to try\nto like figure out how to be confident\nyou know what i'm saying like\nabsolutely so so that's awesome it is\nexhausting\nso this is where i think it starts with\nlike little things right\nso it starts with like uh honestly\nyou've got to roll the dice and you've\ngot to take a chance\nbecause i think the other big big\nconfusing thing is that people assume\nconfidence comes from success\nbut actually confidence comes from\nfailure\ni see what do you see like\nare you saying like if you fail then you\ncan like like reflect on it in a way and\nknow that you like at least you tried\nlike i\nor no it survived it that\nokay right because here's the thing like\nyou're afraid of something coming to\npass\ni'm afraid of failing a class yeah\nand then once i actually fail a class\nand then it's like oh [ __ ]\ni'm actually still around and i\nrecovered from that\nlike you're down in the pits for a\nlittle while and then you come out of it\nand that's where you have faith in\nyourself that's where faith in yourself\ncomes from\nit comes from overcoming challenges not\nstacking the deck in your favor so that\nyou don't have to face them\nwhat about like what about like just\nlike fitting in in general you know what\ni'm saying like how do you like\nlike is that something you even spend\nyour time worrying about or\nyeah so absolutely right so at some\npoint and when it comes to fitting in\nyou have to take a chance so you're not\ngoing to feel confident\nuntil you give people the chance to\nreject you\nand they don't\ncool that sounds not fun\nyep but you've done it before when it\ncomes to jokes\nyeah i see right yeah how concerned are\nyou about the zit or whatever\nit's like it's eating me up a lot in the\ninside yeah yeah okay so that's fine\nno no it's not fine okay so close your\neyes blair\nwe're gonna meditate now bleeding\nokay people can see my zits bleeding\nokay i mean that's\ni know it doesn't feel all right well\nnow your camera's blurry so i think\nwe're fine\nokay so blair can you put put the tissue\ndown\nokay no licking all right so you feel it\nyou\nokay never mind you can leave it there\nyou want to leave it there do it\nyeah okay just leave it there close your\neyes\nokay so tell me what you feel\nanxious huh i said anxious\nokay what are you anxious about uh\nuh my zit is bleeding and it's gross\nokay and people are gonna think i'm\ngross\nokay so look at my face uh-huh\nwait i can't see your face wait why\ncan't you see my face\ni don't know [ __ ]\n[ __ ] there it is okay look at your\nface i'm so sorry\nokay so so look at my face is this the\nface\nof someone who's grossed out\nno i don't know maybe you're pretending\nnot to be grossed out maybe you are\ngrossed out okay there it is\nright so so now what's your mind doing\nmaybe i'm pretending yeah but but\nthe sensory input that you're receiving\nnow look at my face let's not we'll get\nto whether i'm pretending in a second\nis this the face of someone who is\ngrossed out\nno okay so when you see the sensory\ninput\nwhat does your mind do\nit continues to assume that you're\nexactly yeah\nexactly right i've always said this is\nlike a weird thing and maybe this is\nlike totally\noff base but like i've always said like\nit as weird as it is like\nso my mom used to uh she used to text me\nevery single day and be like\ni hope you're having a good day remember\nthat you're beautiful or just like stuff\nlike that like just constantly telling\nme like\npositive things about myself sorry this\nis super dumb\num but then when she died it was like\ni lost that and so it's like\nsomething as little as like being told\nsomething positive about yourself every\nsingle day to like not having that i\nthink like\n[ __ ] me up yeah\nbecause it's like with and i'd always\nsay like oh your mom has to say that\nlike your mom has to be nice to you and\nthat was my way of like oh it doesn't\nmean anything\nbut now that i don't have someone who\nhas to be nice to me it's like\n[ __ ] what is that feeling of [ __ ]\nsad yeah\nwhen did she pass away uh four years ago\nsounds like she was actually really\nsupportive yeah she was awesome\nwell i grew up so i grew up mormon um\nand the rest of my family is very very\nlds um and even my mom was lds\nbut she was still supportive of me in\nlike like even though like\neven though i don't know if that makes\nsense like even though i wasn't\nexactly holy or i wasn't perfect or i\nwasn't\nfollowing the words of wisdom or all\nthat mormon stuff\num i'm like like my dad has said to me\nlike oh like\ni'll never pay for your wedding if you\ndon't get married at a mormon temple\nwhich is fine like it's like i don't\nneed my dad to pay for my wedding but\nit's stuff\nit's stuff like that where it's just\nlike\nwell [ __ ] i'll never be good enough to\nhim but i was good enough to my mom but\nno she's not\nhere to tell me that i'm good enough i\ndon't know is that weird\nno not at all i don't know so\nhere's what i'm i i think everything\njust clicked for me\nbecause here's what i'm hearing i'm\nhearing that\nin order to be valued you were taught\nbecause we asked you this question\nearlier right when did you learn that\nyou had to like\nbe a certain way and get people to like\nyou to make them happy\nwhen you like my whole life right i\nthink it happened earlier than high\nschool i didn't say that\nbut now we kind of see because you've\nbeen taught your entire life that your\nvalue as a human being has nothing to do\nwith who you are\nit has to do with what you do on the\noutside\nyeah and you had one person in your life\nwho said\nactually whether you wear a hat or you\nwear makeup or this\nor any of that [ __ ] does not matter i\ncare about you\nfor you the person who you are\nnot the person that you pretend to be\nnot the top seller at the interior\ndesign\nnot the person who streams but the\nperson the core\nof who you are as a person is someone\nthat i like and value and appreciate\nand she she was the one beacon that gave\nyou value in a world\nthat judged you for all kinds of [ __ ]\nyeah like stupid stuff like i like if i\nwore a tank top my dad would\nlike always be like oh you're like you\nknow showing yourself off and it's like\ni don't like you know like just silly\nstuff like that like it's not silly\nthough right\nit's about as silly as giving someone a\ncupcake is meaningless\nyeah seriously i'm not kidding i mean\nit's not a joke\nyeah right because you you do this thing\nwhere you invalidate a lot and you\ndownplay a lot of like what your\nexperience\nis you call to yourself i is this dumb\nam i dumb you keep on saying that about\nyourself no\nblair you're not dumb it's not dumb it's\nnot insignificant\nit's the very opposite you undervalue so\nmuch of your experience and so much of\nyour contribution which is like that's\nnot fair\nbecause you're worth more than that\nwhich is the whole reason we're having\nthis conversation because i don't think\nyou understand that\nyeah i don't know i don't i don't know i\njust like and it's one of those things\nwhere it's like i feel like i've always\nstruggled with like figuring out even\nthe right route to go\nbecause like for example and this is\nanother big jump in things\nit's like so in high school\ni uh i went to like rehab for two weeks\nfor like uh\nlike depression and an eating disorder\nand\nthen when i came back from rehab\neveryone in high school called me crazy\nthey called me like\noh that girl that went to rehab so it's\nlike even though i went to\nlive and get help for these things it\nwas like well i was harassed for that so\nit feels like no matter what i do\nthere's a negative outcome\nso that just sucks like like my you know\nlike\nif i if i feel like i don't fit in at\nschool because\nmy sister is there and she's very mormon\nand she would\nyell at me if i wore a certain thing to\nschool but then my friends wouldn't hang\nout with me if i was dressed a certain\nway it was just like\nit was a never-ending paths of like\nthere's\nno way to go to please everyone and if i\neven try to make myself happy it makes\nmy family unhappy or it makes my friends\nunhappy or it does like\nyou know it's just like it's exhausting\nsounds like you're [ __ ]\nyeah there's no right choice ever like\never\nyeah and i don't know if you remember\nbut at the beginning we talked about\nconflict\nyeah right how you're conflicted do you\nshare mental health stuff because it\nburns you\nand and like now blair like it sort of\nmakes sense right like you're concerned\nabout your appearance because it sounds\nlike\nyour entire life you've been judged\nbased on your appearance\nand and in such it's it they didn't just\njudge you like they didn't\njudge your appearance there's a\ndifference between judging your\nappearance\nand judging you based on your appearance\nbecause like you were literally taught\nthere was like 10 year old blair\nwho is taught that your value as a human\nbeing depends on whether you dress like\na hussy\nyeah you know like there's certain\nthings and if you wear\nthose things your worth as a person\ndecreases yeah\nwhich is kind of crazy\nyeah right yeah\nno it is yeah and so here's the\nthe unfortunate thing which is that that\nstuff like carries with you right like\nyour your brain has been programmed it's\nnot that you're\ni mean sure i'm sure you can get\ndiagnosed with all kinds of fit but i\ndon't think that you're sick\ni think what you are is conditioned yeah\nyou're conditioned to feel worse about\nyourself\nwhen it comes to your appearance\nand somehow you've managed to undo some\nof that conditioning\nwhen it comes to things like baking or\nhumor\nyeah because i'm not hearing your dad\never say\nyou're not a good human being because\nyou attacked a joke what i'm hearing him\nsay\nis like you're not a good human being if\nyou wear a tank top\nwhat do you think how how let's just\npause for a second\ni'm just seeing you process yeah no i'm\njust yeah\nthat's all i'm doing is that's yeah\nthat's what i'm doing it's just\nprocessing it just\njust i don't know i don't know how i\ndon't know how to get better at it like\ni'd love to get better at it i just\ndon't know how\nyeah great that's an excellent question\nso i think the first thing\nso here's how you get better okay so the\nfirst thing is that it sounds like\nyou may actually i don't know if you\nhave mental health treatment providers\nbut i think this is\nabsolutely the kind of [ __ ] that you\ntalk about in therapy this may be\ntherapy level stop\nand what i mean by that is like it\nsounds like at one point you had an\neating disorder\nthere may be some kind of i mean i think\ni know i think everything gets called\nanxiety in your case i really think\nabout it more like trauma to be honest\nand not to say that you have ptsd but\nlike this is the other problem with\nmental health is that\nyou know trauma can have effects on your\npsychology that are not ptsd\nyeah and so i think understanding those\nlike this is the whole problem is that\neveryone equates in psychiatry they\nequate\ntrauma with ptsd but ptsd is a specific\ncondition but i i think you've been you\nknow taught\nlots of things about how your value is\nas a person\ni think you've got to explore those that\n[ __ ] sounds dramatic\ni also think it you know unfortunately i\ndon't know\nif you can do this alone or maybe you\ncan do it alone but\ni don't think it's worth it to try so i\nthink you should get help from some kind\nand the therapy may be a good idea but\nit's not just therapy right because i\nthink the other thing that we're hearing\nis that like you had a very positive\ninfluence in your life that you haven't\nhad for four years\nand while there's no replacement for\nyour mom there should absolutely be\npeople in your life\nwho treat you the same way that she\ntreated you because you deserve that\ndo you have other people like that\nyeah but i think uh\nit's a lot of pressure to put on\nsomebody right like\nlike nobody should have to like i don't\nknow like i don't expect anyone to be\nnice to me\nyeah so that thought needs to change\nwhen you say it's\nit's it's a lot of pressure to put on\nsomeone what are you putting on them\num i don't know them to be\nlike you know like that's a lot like i\ndon't know it's a lot to like\nsure so you know like and i don't want\nto ask people to care about me\nlike i don't know why not\nuh because it's selfish\nso just because it's selfish doesn't\nmean that you don't deserve\nit\ni don't think and this might be totally\noff-base but i don't think anybody like\ndeserves\nanything i don't know like i don't think\ni deserve anything\ni think i have to like work hard to earn\nit\nlike i don't deserve anyone\nto care about me i don't does that make\nsense\nit does make sense i just disagree\nokay i think that\nyou are worth people caring about you\nwhat do you think about that\nand maybe i don't know maybe\ni'll i'll take a maybe that's good\nenough yeah and it's okay for you to say\nno because i think this is a foreign\nconcept to you\nyeah so i think you've got to think\nabout it and i agree that you should\nwork for what you get in life and also\nlike let me put it to you this way\nlet's say i show up at the hospital with\nmy dozen cupcakes\ndo those people deserve cupcakes\nno i guess not\nthey i mean they do in a way of like you\ncan make them happier and\nyeah so that's the really tricky thing\nright so like i would actually say even\nthough i know this doesn't make any\nsense\nand maybe this is a problem with the\nlanguage that we're using i'd say yes\nyeah i'd say they do deserve a cupcake\ni'd say that if your life is in the\n[ __ ]\nit's okay for other for you to feel\nand for other feel people to feel\nbeholden to making your life better\ni think it's okay to ask someone to care\nabout you\neven though in a sense it's not fair you\ndon't owe them anything\nand that's the problem with i think the\nword deserve is it's not like they owe\nyou anything but you absolutely deserve\nit\nyou deserve to have people in your life\nwho care about you as a person\nbecause that's something that all human\nbeings deserve yeah\nand and the simplest way that i think\nabout it is is sure your mom has to care\nabout you but like that's just the start\nit doesn't mean that other people don't\nlike that's actually the [ __ ] problem\nis that we live in a society where we\ngenerally don't as human beings we don't\nthink that we\nowe other human beings caring and\nlike also that we don't acknowledge that\nwe\nourselves deserve to be cared for\nyou know like i deserve to be loved like\nabsolutely [ __ ] literally\nso do my kids and so do you so does\ntwitch chat\ni don't know where along the way we like\ndecided that\nindependent like i don't know what's\nhappening but like it sounds\nmind-boggling to me that i think they do\ndeserve cupcakes\nyeah okay i think you have the capacity\nto make other human beings happy and\nthat that's a responsibility that you\nhave\nand similarly like that's not a one-way\nstreet like you deserve to be on the\nreceiving end of cupcakes you deserve\npeople to be baking for you too why not\nit's weird yeah no it all makes sense it\nmakes a lot of sense i mean if anything\nlike i am\nlike i feel like i am always that person\nthat's like okay like\nyou know like even though i say like oh\nthey don't deserve cupcakes i'm still\nthe one that's like\neven if they don't deserve them like i\nwant other people to be happy so here\nyou go like here's this like i feel like\ni'm\ni feel like my happiness like i get like\nmaking other people happy even if i give\nthem 100\nhappiness at least it gives me like a\nfeeling of one percent because i did\nthat like i helped them be happy so that\nmakes\nme happier but at the end of the day i\nfeel like\nsometimes maybe that's not enough like\nyou know what i'm saying yeah it's not\nenough because you know what what needs\nto happen is that needs to be a two-way\nstreet player\nright so like you should be doing that\nfor them and they should be doing that\nfor you\nand i think what's what's happened is i\ndon't know if you have people\nin your life like your mom because like\nyou know it's kind of your mom's job but\nshe goes out of her way to make your\nlife better on a daily basis\nyeah there's no one like that ever but\nyou know what i'm saying like i don't\nthink\ni don't think they're my my mother was\ninsane like in that way\nlike and she juggled it like she every\nsingle one of her kids felt that way\nevery single one of her friends felt\nthat way it's like\nit's insane it's crazy like\ni don't i don't even know how to be like\nthat and i witnessed it for\nyears you know and so it's just like i\nwas just really [ __ ] lucky\nuh and so it sucks to lose that\nit does absolutely\nand i think you may be closer to your\nmom than you think you are\nin terms of being able to do that she\nhad a little bit more practice than you\ndo\nyeah she uh was insane yeah but yeah\ni don't know sounds like you miss her a\nlot\ni don't really know what to say now it's\nokay\ni'm just going to be quiet for a second\nwhile my brain tries to figure out what\ni should do\nwe've done it we've broken\ni'm confused are we\n[Music]\ntalking about today who knows\ni don't know how to be happy i think is\nthat what we're doing\nsure so what do you think how do you be\nhappy\ni think good side i think\ni think it's like the forehead answer\nwhere it's like oh just accept yourself\nor head but\nthat's a journey and how does one go\nabout accepting themselves\nwhat are a couple steps along that\njourney\ni don't i don't know yet um based on\nwhat we talked about i feel like\nmaybe stop like uh using my anxiety as a\ncrutch essentially\num and hopefully that'll help\nboost some confidence no matter how\nstressful that sounds uh yep\noh it's absolutely it's gonna be\nstressful so and\nlet me just clarify so i don't think\nit's stop using your anxiety i'd say\npick a tiny tiny training wheel you've\ngot big training wheels and you have\ntiny tiny ones\nyeah so notice you know when you're\ndoing something to alleviate your\nanxiety and recognize that like\nultimately for your anxiety to be gone\nyou can't be alleviating it all the time\nyeah i'm curious what your thought is on\nlike\nso for example like social anxiety right\nso if i like\ngo into a room and this is just based on\nsomething\na therapist in the past has told me and\ni'm curious if it works because at the\nsame time i can see it\nalso hindering like being a crutch in\nsome way\nor kind of doing the opposite of what\nyou've said like so\nessentially what she told me to do is\nlike if i go into a room\nyou know and i'm anxious that i'm like\noh that person hates me like everybody\nhates me here everybody hates me here or\nlet's say\nsam some guy named sam sam hates me sam\ncan't understand me sam thinks i'm dumb\nsam blah blah blah blah all these\nnegative things\nwhat she said to do was then go back and\nwrite down the thoughts so\nsam hates me and then write down the\nreality\nwhich is sam has not said that he hates\nme and then write down\nlike the like what the act the new\nthought should be which is\nsam has not said anything that signifies\nthat he hates me so he does not hate me\ndoes that is that still valuable or is\nthat just a\ncrutch in that way what do you think\ni don't know i i i'm scared it's a\ncrutch\ni don't think it's a crutch but i think\nthat it doesn't work for everyone that's\nwhat i would say okay\nso let's understand like what that\npractice actually does\nso the problem with anxiety is that we\nassume\nthat thoughts are facts yeah\nright so what this this is a practice\nthat encourages you to recognize\nthat your thoughts are not truth that\nare just thoughts\nyeah and in your case i think this is a\nvery important thing to learn\nbecause you have a lot of thoughts that\ncome from your conditioning\nbut just because you are conditioned to\nbelieve a certain thing doesn't make\nthat thing true\nlike wearing a tank top does not mean\nanything about you it just means you're\nwearing a tank top\nyeah right but like like people in the\nmormon church\nmay believe like is is in a factual way\nthat wearing a tank top means that you\nwere a bad person\nyeah and like they're it it's not\nit's not that absurd of a belief right\nso like\nwe can judge we judge people based on\nwhat they wear all the time like if i\nwalk around like if i go to like\nuh like a kindergarten and i'm wearing\nnothing but a speedo\nlike that's not acceptable right so like\nit's\nlike human beings all the time judge\npeople for the articles of clothing that\nthey wear and that's not necessarily a\nbad thing\nalso if i like you know go to the\nhospital in a speedo like that's not\nhonestly anywhere in a speedo anywhere\nso so like you know it's not it's not\nnecessarily that they're wrong it's just\nthat\nyou know thoughts are not facts and so\nwhat that practice does is it helps you\nrecognize that your thoughts are not\nfacts\nit's not the only way what i seem to try\nto do\nis instead of like doing that practice i\nlike i just like have become very\nconfrontational over the years and so\nnow it's just like i'll just approach\nthe person be like\nare you mad at me do you not like me as\nlike trying to get a\nan answer and then it's like great i\nwalk away from that conversation\nthinking\nokay they said that they are not mad at\nme and that they do like me\nbut they lied like it's like\nyep so so we can see that the root of\nthe thought is not\nfixed by the reassurance all the\nreassurance does\nis alleviates the anxiety in the short\nterm that's a training wheel\nokay right because like all you're doing\nit's the equivalent of putting on a\nbaseball hat\nto manage your anxiety of of you know\nwhatever\nyeah so it's just it's covering it up\nand that can be exhausting for other\npeople i'm not trying to scare you but\nsometimes what happens of it is some\npeople need a lot of reassurance and the\nproblem is that when you reassure\nsomeone and relate sort of\nwhen you reassure someone in a\nrelationship sometimes it can feed their\nneed for reassurance\nand it's kind of tricky because like\nsometimes you just they deserve to be\nyou know you deserve some degree of\nreassurance like it's healthy yeah\nso but it also is too much like i know\nit's too much personally like i know i\nneed reassurance way too much and i\ndon't\ni want to know how to stop that because\nit's so obnoxious\nhere's how you stop it where do you get\nthe idea in the first place that they\nhate you\nanxiety yeah where does that come from\nso like when did he not liking myself\nis that like a canned answer that's\nactually what you believe no i\ni think i think it's like it's like oh\nsince i don't like myself why would\nanybody else like me\ngood so why don't you like yourself\ni don't know okay so so now this\ncomes back to confidence right\nright so like you're you're right blair\nthat like in order to\nrip this anxiety out root and stem\nand it makes sense like if you don't see\nany value in yourself how on earth\nwould other people see value in you like\nit's not illogical it's not dumb in fact\nit's the exact opposite\nright it makes perfect sense but then\nthe question becomes it comes\nback to like why don't you see value in\nyourself like blair are you a good\nperson\nyes do you believe that\nyeah yes i've never done like yeah i'm\nnot a bad person\nokay i've done lots of good things\ndo you have value as a human being\nyou know like i feel like anything i do\nanybody else could do\nokay so see there we go so are you a\ngood person yes\nare you a valuable person so there you\ngo again devaluing yourself\nyeah because i don't think anything that\nanything you could do could be done by\nanyone else i don't believe that it\nsounds to me\nlike you're a specific i think you are\nprobably one of the best people in the\nworld\nto bake a cake\nand put a joke on top\nokay right so like i think that some\npeople can't do what you do\nbut there you go devaluing yourself and\nnow we get to the most difficult\nquestion\nare you attractive no\nright so like that's kind of interesting\nso like are you a good person sure\nare you do you have value no and are you\ni mean maybe\nand then are you attractive and you say\nno\nnow somewhere in there\nyou have certain perceptions about who\nyou are as a person\nand i don't know where those were born\nbut i think you've got to figure those\nout\nright so like how long have you been\nyou know what when were you taught\nthat your value yeah so i actually i i\nmean i can even answer this for you so i\nthink like we know in terms of like your\nvalue as another person\nthe only things that you value about\nyourself or when you have clear\noverwhelming evidence that you're\nsuperior to others\nand that's why you compare that's why\nyou're perfectionistic\nright so like the reason you're\nperfectionistic it's not because you're\nlike messed up in some way it's because\nthe only way that you can convince\nyourself\nthat you have value is if you're if if\nyou're at the top of your class\nand so in a weird way that's a training\nwheel for your lack of self-worth\nbecause if you can prove to everyone\nelse and yourself\nyou're like look at this medal i have\nsee how gold it is\nthen i'm a good person yeah so\nwhere did you get like when did this\nthis idea that you have to be a gold\nmedalist\nto have value like where did you learn\nthat like who taught you that\ni don't it's what's weird because like i\nsaid like my my mother was very like\nsupportive no matter what so i don't\nknow where it came from i think it might\nhave\ncome like internally maybe because like\nlike for example like my brother was\nlike varsity basketball played\nbasketball in college my other brother\nwas varsity basketball played basketball\ncollege my sister was varsity volleyball\nplayed volleyball in college i got cut\nfrom the volleyball team\nthere it is i was bad at everything like\nand what did your dad say when you got\ncut from the volleyball team\nhe was nice like he you know he like he\ntook me and got ice cream but it's like\nit\ni think it was just like a\nself-comparison thing like always trying\nto catch up with everyone else\ncause i was just i'm just i'm just bad\nat [ __ ] like i'm just not\ngood at those things so it's just like i\nthink\ni i don't know where it came from\nexactly because my dad was even\nsupportive if i\nif i didn't i think it was more just\nlike i put it on myself\nbecause i just wanted to fit in with my\nown family because it's like i didn't\nfit in\nlike they're all very religious and i\ndidn't fit in that way so it's my way to\nfit in was trying to be good at sports\nbut i was awful at sports\nand so maybe it's that like no one put\npressure on me besides myself\ni think in that context\nso that makes sense and yet i'm gonna\ndisagree because i think\ni think if you feel like you don't fit\nin in your family\nlike that's not just something that the\ndefault is that kids feel like they fit\nin\noh right okay i think i know why\ni think i know i it's very it's very\nheavy chat i don't want you to get like\nyou know\ni don't want anyone to feel a certain\nway but\ni actually think i know why and i've\nnever like tied this together until\nliterally this moment um but\nand i've said this on my chat before so\nit's like it's fine as it\nas a kid i was um\nsexually molested by a neighbor and\num and it made me feel like\ni would never fit in because as a mormon\nyou have to be perfect and you have to\nbe pure and i was taken advantage of and\nwhat was i supposed to do\nso maybe it's that like because that i\nremember just never\nlike you know like oh now i have this\nbig secret that i can't tell anyone my\nfamily because i don't want anyone to\nget in trouble because he told me that i\ncouldn't tell anybody or i'd get in\ntrouble\nand so it could just be that maybe um\nand so yeah so i was imperfect from like\nage\nseven and so like how am i supposed to\nfit in with everyone else\nright so like let me ask you something\nblaire\nare you imperfect yeah but i think\neveryone is\nare you more imperfect than other people\nno you sure\nyes so that's confusing to me\nbecause this whole time what you've been\ntelling us is the opposite\nyeah well no because i think i think\nperfection and value are different is\nthat weird\nsure yeah so so so no no it's not weird\nso i think this is good\nso like so now let's let me just tell\nyou a couple of other things okay so\nfirst of all\nin a sense not surprising so like just\nstatistically right so if you look at\nwomen or just people who tend to have a\nlow sense of self-worth\nhave eating disorders and anxiety\nand we kind of talked about trauma right\na little while ago\noftentimes there is something like\nsexual physical or emotional abuse at a\nvery young age\nyeah and that happens so like eating\ndisorders as well or about\ncontrolling things that are out of your\ncontrol\nyeah and and what i'm hearing from you\nlike is like basically the threat of\nthis entire conversation\nis that you on the inside are not good\nenough\nyeah but i also i feel like it's a it's\na consistent problem and so that's why\nit's like i feel like it just requires\nlike\nit requires a lot of self-reflection\nslash i feel like that's why i've\naccepted it\nbecause like no matter what i do it's\nlike a reoccurring theme\nin my life like i i dated someone who\nwas\nphysically violent with me and i\ni did another person that constantly\ntold me i wasn't good enough for them so\nit's just like it's just like this\nthis never-ending cycle it seems and i\ndon't i don't\nknow if i like put myself in those\nsituations or how\nlike why it always seems to happen\nyeah so we can talk about that too so\nhere's the crazy thing\ni think that i know this is i'm not\nblaming you for this but i've seen this\npattern over and over again it's\nsomething that's actually well described\nas something called the repetition\ncompulsion\nso something about so i think we should\nlook at how you\nselect people that you\ngo out with and my guess\nmaybe this is a conversation for a\ndifferent day because there's a whole\nother can of worms\nthere are some people who treat you with\nmore value than you believe you deserve\nand that you actually pull away from\nthem\nand you gravitate towards people that\nmake you feel the way that you feel\nabout yourself\nbecause that [ __ ] makes sense\nright and like when you walk in and\neveryone's like oh hey\nlike blair's here awesome blair and\nand then you're like i'm confused i\nforgot my cupcakes and they're like\nthat's no problem\nand that's [ __ ] confusing for you\nyeah and then like what makes more sense\nto you is like the group of people and\nthat makes you uncomfortable\nand then the next day you go to a party\nand then they're like oh hey blair's\nhere and you're like i forgot my\ncupcakes and they're like well\n[ __ ] go get it go back home and get them\nand then you're like oh\nokay fine and oddly enough you're more\ncomfortable with the second group than\nthe with the first group\nbecause they treat you the way that you\nbelieve\nyou deserve to be treated yeah i don't\ni don't know it's it's it's so strange\nbecause i feel like every single person\nthat i've ever dated has been so\ndrastically different like the first guy\nit was kind of like\nhe was he was crazy he was very insane\nand that one makes sense but then like\nand that was the that was like the\nphysically abusive guy and then the next\nguy\nwas very very sweet but would constantly\nlike when i would say like you know like\nwhat are your thoughts on me they'd be\nlike oh well you don't check all my\nboxes\nlike you're like uh you know you're\nyou're yeah\nthey don't sound that different to me\nthat's so weird because they're like\nvery different people but like\nbut it is true i get confused when\npeople are nice to me like\ni'll be like well why did you do this\nyeah so here's here's the here's the\ntricky thing\nso when there is someone who you could\nprospectively date\nand they're nice to you do you pull away\nfrom them\nor yes i guess i guess for like many\nmonths but now i'm in a situation where\ni feel like\nwell like i'm with someone that is very\nnice to me good\nnow be careful because do they so like\nlike that's the weird thing right it's\nlike\nlike it's strange but you do pull away\nfrom them because that's what you were\ntaught it's kind of like you know if i\ni can't come up with a good analogy but\nlike you know i'm i'm gonna\ngravitate towards people who share my\nview because it can be really confusing\nyou know if i walk down the street and\neveryone thinks that like i'm a dog\nlike i'm not it's hard for me to relate\nto those people because i don't think\ni'm a dog\nbut i'm going to relate to the people\nit's easy it's more comfortable for me\nto be with what i know\nyeah i guess it does make me more\nanxious because it's like well then what\nwhy would you be with me if you're so\nnice like exactly right\nand so then that those kinds of thoughts\nwhen they get out of hand can actually\ntorpedo the relationship\nyes very much so because and there we\nhave it\nso we can dig into this in more detail\nif you want but\ni think maybe enough for today what do\nyou think\n[Laughter]\nhow are you feeling uh i feel fine\ni feel like\nyou know there's there's no abrupt\nanswer\num but i feel like so i mean my biggest\nthing\nmy biggest question i guess is what\nwhat do i do instead of looking for that\nreassurance like what do i do instead of\nsaying oh do you like me\nare you do you hate me are you sure you\ndon't hate me like what do i do to\nstop that so the first thing you've got\nto do is stop feeding it\nokay so like this is where like you're\ngonna have an impulse\nright and and like there are times where\nyou're gonna give in to the impulse\nand they're gonna be times where you\nresist the impulse just do so with\nawareness\njust say like oh hey i'm feeling like\nthis person really dislikes me right now\nand it would really make me feel better\nif i asked them and got some reassurance\nand then decide\ncan i tolerate this feeling of anxiety\nright now\nor is it too much if i it can i if it's\nalmost like\nlike i call it urge surfing so urges\ncan be like surfed they don't last\nforever\nand over time like it'll like so here's\nlike the anxiety like\ngoes up and then it peaks and then even\nif you do nothing about it it's gonna go\ndown\nyou're not gonna be anxious for the rest\nof your life which is not how yes\nthey come and they go so you figure out\nwhat you can serve\nlike what can you manage what can you\nwait until like the tide rolls out again\nand then you're like in a good space and\nthen the other thing that you do is you\nwatch\nas as you go and you reassure yourself i\nwant you to hold on to a small\npart of blair who's watching and saying\nokay here's my anxiety\nmy anxiety is an 80 out of 100. i'm\ngoing to walk up to him i'm going to ask\nhim a question\nand i'm going to listen to the words and\ni'm going to watch don't even pay\nattention to the words\nwatch what happens in your anxiety and\nhe says yeah\nno you're you're awesome i like you a\nlot and then you're like that's [ __ ]\nweird it went from an 80 to a 90.\nbecause it doesn't go down right you\nhave to ask again you have to ask again\nand then the fourth time you asked are\nyou sure and then after four or five\ntimes then it's like oh it went from a\n95 like back down to 70 and you're like\nhold on\ni'm still feeling kind of anxious and\nnot even that much better than before\nand as you start to like reflect and\nunderstand like how to play this game\nthat is blair's life you'll start to get\ncontrol over it\nokay and like literally like here's\nanother just very simple example\nso you want to meditate\nyeah we can meditate do you meditate you\nknow how to meditate i used to a lot\ni do a lot okay so i don't much anymore\ni'm gonna be can i be a little bit\ncan i challenge you yes okay\nso sit up straight back straight\nnext straight okay\nall right eyes closed okay\nso it's gonna be hard okay you gotta let\nme know if it's too much okay i'm gonna\ntroll you just a tiny amount\nokay so think about taking off your hat\nokay how do you feel right there it is\ngood i'm not actually gonna ask you to\ntake off your hats and okay cool\nbut i i want you to feel that feeling\nright so like all it takes is a thought\nand then what do you feel\nuh uncomfortable okay what does that\nfeel like\num\nuh it feels like like\nyou know like it's hard to describe it\nfeels like uh\ni instantly like i can't my like i can't\nthink straight\num like my chest is tight good so like\nwatch that so\nhold on to a tiny piece of blair and\nrecognize that like\nyou're in danger mode right because like\nuntil i told you i'm not gonna ask you\nto take it off\ni can imagine you're like oh [ __ ] is he\ngonna ask me to take it off yeah\nright so like there's all of that\nanxiety so sit with that for a second\nthat chest tightness\nand now breathe into it so tilt your\nhead up a little bit\ngood there we go now breathe in\nfeel that expansion in your chest and\nthen\nlet the tightness pull your chest back\nin now just breathe out\nlet your chest recoil\nnow notice what's happening to the\nanxiety it's probably there\nyou still feel it is your mind stopping\nto function\nit's more in my mind that makes sense\nmore in your mind as opposed to that's\nlike my like my obsessive thinking like\nit just\ngoes and goes and goes okay good so i\nwant you to notice that it's going\nand now return to your breath so breathe\nin\nand then exhale very slowly\nso continue to breathe keep one eye on\nthe mind\nand with the other eye the analogy is\ngoing to fall apart\ni want you to listen to the sound of\nyour exhalation\nokay i got it\nare you able to hear it\nokay deep breath in\nand now what i want you to do\ntry to increase the sound of the\nexhalation by contracting your throat i\nknow it sounds weird\nso just do whatever you can to make the\nsound of exhalation larger\nare you able to adjust it at all\nlike an ujjayi breath is that it oh [ __ ]\nnext level [ __ ]\nyeah that's where we're going how the\n[ __ ] do you know that\ntherapy and yoga for years yes\nwe're moving towards so do you know how\nto do ujjayi pranayam\nyeah okay so do with jay pranayama\nis that ujjayi wrath [ __ ]\nslow playing your yoga expertise\nso what's happening in your mind as you\ndo ujjayi breath\nit's more focused on the breath than it\nis the thoughts\nso what's happening to the thoughts is\nthe result they're quieting\nokay what happened to that anxiety about\nyou taking your hat off\nit went quiet\nyeah i know it's still in my brain but\nit was\nit's went back in its box for right now\nright so\nclose your eyes and now we're going to\nbring it out\nno absolutely nope\nsorry you you screwed yourself okay\nblair when you mentioned ujjayi that's\nwhen i decided to push you even\nfurther okay okay so think about taking\noff your hat again\ntell it open up the box and say come on\nout buddy\nit's it's there yeah good there it is\nthe second like that's the thing is no\nmatter how much i\nseem to quiet it or comment it takes\nlike a snap of a second or a snap of a\ncomment or a snap of a thing to\nbring it all back out there there you go\nokay\nso now yeah see the discomfort is there\nnow return to a j\nright so for those of you who don't know\nso like oj breath is\ncontracting your throat so constricting\nyour throat so that\nthe sound of the breath increases and\nalmost sounds like a whistling\nyou can also raise your soft mallet if\nyou know what that sounds like or what\nthat\nis it dwindling at all\nyeah okay so now we're gonna do the\nthird version okay\nso now we're gonna let it out again and\nthis time we're gonna do something\nreally tricky\nwe're gonna let it be there and just\nwatch it\nnow we know that we can put it back in\nthe box\nso once we learn how to put it back in\nthe box i know i can see it's hard for\nyou\ngood yeah so we're not going to put it\nback in the box\nokay because now have faith in yourself\nthat you can make it go away\nyou can control it but let it out now\nlet it go\nall of those thoughts are going to come\nroaring back\nright all of these ideas of you being\nugly and pure\nand all of this [ __ ] like see it it's so\nhuge\nit's a tornado of negativity\nand it's there and it's awful\nand blair is there too\nyou're still there the funny person who\nmakes cupcakes\nand can both of them exist at the same\ntime\nwhat's that like\nfeels like normal i guess okay\nit is so if it feels normal does that\nmean that this is what you're usually\nlike\nthis is your default state which is that\nyour anxieties are present okay\ngood yeah it always feels like have like\nhalf of me is perpetually stressed about\nsomething always\ngood so so so just notice that and and\nrecognize that you can coexist there\nin a sense it sounds like it's normal\nfor you which sounds awful\nbut at the same time i know this sounds\nbizarre\nblair but i think that you started the\nprocess of rewiring your neurons\nand have changed some of the\nautomaticity of your thoughts\neven over the last five minutes\nbecause it's weird like you can do this\nright so the first thing is that you\nlearn how to put it back in the box\nand secondly you don't even need to put\nit back in the box\nyeah but how do i get rid of it you\ndon't\ni mean you can but the way that you get\nrid of it is by not trying to get rid of\nit\nso all you have to do is stop feeding it\nand it'll wither away\noh it's like the wolf the the wolf thing\nyeah\nexactly okay right so at some point you\nknow i don't know when you put on your\nhat\nbut i would say in private\nyou know consider taking off your hat\nconsider not wearing a hat with\nparticular people and notices those\nthoughts come up\nand recognize that that's the wolf\nscratching at the door wanting to be fed\nyeah\nand the more you feed it the bigger it\ngrows in the hungrier it gets\nso you can reverse that cycle in tiny\ntiny tiny ways\nright also work with a therapist right\nright and there's a lot of stuff about\npurity and relationships and stuff and\nwe're just getting started but\nyeah okay how do you feel\ngood it feels like a good refresher\nlike a good reminder a good um\na good like reminder of like which\npath i should be taking versus how i\nhave been dealing with it even though i\nknow better like i know i know better\ni know i know these things that you just\ntold me\nyes but i have gotten lazy\ni think yeah so that too you've got to\nbe a little bit forgiving towards\nyourself\nyeah right so knowing what to do is not\nthe hard part\nlike the other thing is you're smart so\nyou're gonna know what to do pretty\neasily\nit's the actually like you know like i i\nmean so my wife\nhas a joke that i can i collect exercise\nequipment\nuh-huh and and what is a collection it's\na bunch of [ __ ] that you never use right\nlike a stamp collection like you never\nuse the stamps\nso i collect exercise like i know that i\nshould exercise actually exercising is\nthe hard part\nyeah so cut yourself some slack and and\ndo what you can\nand i i think i think you can be free of\nthis splitter i really do it'll take\nsome time\nand we'll probably talk in years okay to\nbe honest\nyeah in your case but you can be free of\nit absolutely\nand good luck with the full-time\nstreaming yeah\nyeah yeah that's it we'll see what\nhappens\nokay any questions before we wrap up\nno thank you so much you're very welcome\nthank you\nthis is awesome i i think you're it was\nfun\nfor you know so much which actually\nmakes it\nreally fun for me because i feel like\ni'm not teaching you the basics i'm\nteaching you more stuff\nyeah no it's helpful yeah yeah okay good\nluck\nokay take care adios bye bye\nokay chat"
