masturbation is bad\nso we'll get into that kind of stuff so\nlet's let's hop in\nwelcome friends hey um\nso let's just do a quick uh we'll do\nlike a volume\ncheck as we do introductions um\nso welcome guys so i think this is this\nis another stream talking about\ni guess nofap and porn addiction\nso first of all huge props see all for\ncoming on and talking about something\nthat\nis a community we usually don't talk\nabout pretty openly\num and so we had a porn addiction stream\na couple of\nmonths ago now and i think it was\nactually\nthe most positive youtube comment\nsection i've ever seen on youtube which\nis just really really bizarre\nbecause it's something that normally\ncomes with a lot of shame so props to\nyou guys\nfor coming on and talking about this uh\nso if you guys are on twitch i highly\nrecommend minimizing it\nbecause i think it's only going to be\ndistracting\nand let's go ahead and start with\nintroductions and and why don't y'all\nyou know tell us what you want to be\ncalled over the course of the stream\num and tell us a little bit about your\nexperience with nofap or porn addiction\nso i think i'll start um i'm going by\nbob today\nokay um i first\nsaw porn when i was about 12 years old\num\nand there was a lot of like i had a lot\nof like family\nconflict and stuff at the time um and\nthat was my first introduction into it\nand\nuh it got a little bit better when i was\naround 18.\ni got a girlfriend and then um\nlost said girlfriend and i started\nlooking at porn again\nuh when i was around 19 and\nit got gradually worse and worse along\nwith uh\nyou know issues of social anxiety and\nisolation\nalong with the internet addiction and\nthen around\n23 my dad got cancer and died\nand that exacerbated it and it got worse\num and i had a series of\npanic attacks and like pretty severe\nissues um and it seemed to dovetail with\nthat\nuh internet addiction video game\naddiction and pornography addiction\num and there was a long period of using\nfor\nhours on end losing sleep that sort of\nthing\num intensification of just weirdness\nin general in that department um\nand i only started getting control of it\nwhen i got to be around\n26 or 27 and started thinking about it\nas a problem\nand tried to do what's\nyou know a streak for three days a week\na month and\ni noticed that a lot of the time when i\nwould get on a long streak\na lot of these issues would come up\nagain\nmy life would improve in some ways or it\nwould get more difficult in other ways\num and whenever i got\non the the brahmacharya channel with all\nthese other people and i started talking\nto them\nwe really we really had um\nit was a great support group and it\nreally has helped me a lot to\nfigure out how to manage this why it's\nhappening\nhow i can sort of use this discipline to\nimprove my self-understanding in my life\nand that is where i'm at now\nlook at the introduction bob thanks for\nsharing man\nthanks for having me anyone else want to\ngo\nyeah i'll go next uh you can call me\nmoon um\nso i first started watching porn\nwhenever i was you know probably about\n12 as well\nand it wasn't really a problem when i\nwas a kid but it kind of ramped up to\na way i would bury my emotions and kind\nof\nescape reality i'd say and\num i kind of built up to a really bad\nproblem you know in the past few years\nand uh currently i'm on my longest\nstreak probably\nin like five six years right now i have\n50 days\nwithout it of like porn or masturbation\nso i'm pretty\nhappy with that but um yeah definitely\nwas a way that i would numb\nmy emotions okay\nthanks for sharing moon we'll definitely\nget into\nyou know what that what the nofap\nstreak is like and things like that so\ncool sounds good\nthanks for coming on man yeah then i go\nnext\nyou can call me atsai i\nwatched porn the first time when i was\n10 years old\nand it was usually i would say normal\nlike once a day and i had no\nseemingly no problems outside of it but\nthen i became a christian on my own and\ndiscovered\nit's a sin and i need to stop and\ni really had a hard time stopping and i\ncould only go for like\nthree days and then at some point i\ngoogled porn addiction and then i found\noh it's not just\nreligious talk that it's harmful but\nit's there also\na lot of there's also a lot of\nscientific evidence and\nmany reports from people and seeing all\nthese reports\nand describing their problems they had i\nand\nthese were exactly the problems also i\nhad at the time\nlike social anxiety i was very shy and i\ndidn't\nwanted to interact with people a lot and\nonce i got into it um i got my\nlongest streak back then it was around\nit was in 2016\nand i had a 70 day long streak\nand in that time my life improved\ndrastically\nin areas especially in like\nsocial anxiety talking with girls and\njust being in general i wasn't depressed\nanymore i had more motivation and stuff\nlike that\nbut ever since then it got slightly\nworse and i'm now\nat a place where i'm struggling to get\nover one week\nand i started also to binge a lot which\ndidn't happen\nwhich means like five times in a row\nwhich is like extremely unhealthy hence\nyeah that's\nwhere i am right now wow sounds like\nquite the journey\nit's outside yeah exactly\nthanks for sharing man\ni think i'ma go next um you can call me\nflo\n[Music]\ni started watching porn when i was 12\nand it was like\nat the same time as i was entering high\nschool and\nthat time a few friends that i had\nbeen with on like primary school kind of\nlike turned on me and started bullying\nme\nin high school and um\nyeah it was like pretty good timing to\ndiscover pawn because i would like use\nit to numb\nlike the pain i felt at that time um\naround the same time i started like\ngetting like suicidal thoughts\nand um yeah i'm not sure if i had like a\ndepression but i'm yeah i'm pretty\ncertain\nand um then i\num just like went with it until i was 18\nand traveling around in australia for a\nyear\nand being there i had like no social\nanxiety and like a lot of good friends\nthat\nwere there for me and i discovered that\ni was\naddicted to pornography because i was\njust\num using it less and emotions were\ncoming up\nand i was like feeling a lot of\ndifferent\nemotions and um i started to\ndo like nofap and wasn't really able to\nstop\nand when i was back at home after\ntraveling\nit got worse because i moved back in\nwith my parents\nand i had like\nlots of family issues with them\nbeforehand\nand i felt really helpless\nand so i went to a psychiatrist\nand started therapy basically\nwith somebody like doing like behavioral\naddictions and um\nyeah i've been trying to quit since then\nand\nyeah i still feel pretty helpless with\nthis topic\nsorry you feel that way hopefully we'll\ni don't know if we can\nmake you feel less helpless but we're\nhopefully we'll try to understand it a\nlittle bit\nsounds like you put in a lot of effort\nto trying to get a control like get it\nget a handle on it\nhas it been yeah all of us i think are\nlike\npretty um like trying their best\nyeah is that good enough\nwell um\nwe all relapse at some point\nbut um i think it has improved\ndefinitely also being with these guys\nand\nchatting about it cool\nwelcome club thanks for sharing thank\nyou\nokay and uh i'll go next so on the\ndiscord my name is azalea\nbayes but i'll go by zz uh shout out to\nez moon\nfrom drama chariot discord and my friend\ntyler\nso everybody else forgot but um so i\nfirst watched porn when\ni was 11 um and i got like a lot of\nviruses\non my mom's computer so i mean everybody\ni think everybody remembers that from\nthe old days of the internet it wasn't\nexactly safe\nto watch porn but now uh if i do\nuse i uh use it on my mobile phone which\ni think is probably one of the hardest\nthings because now we have mobile phones\nand ipads and that sort of thing the\nlongest streak i ever had was when i was\nin a dual diagnosis\nrehab so i have a i have like a mental\ndisability as well as like traditional\naddiction um so 30 days without the\ninternet means\n30 days without porn so\nyeah and recently i found it very hard\nto really start a streak a lot of\ntraumatic events have happened recently\ni got into a car accident\ni recently overdosed got into mental\nhospitals i've been in mental hospitals\nin and out\ndue to my disability but otherwise i'm\nhappy to be on the stream\nand uh hopefully this helps other people\nas well as myself\noh man wow it sounds like you've been\nhad some challenges\nyou all have\ni guess that leaves me yeah sorry if i\nramble\num you guys can call me annie\nuh i'm 20 years old and uh\ni think i fur and tell me if my mic is\ntoo loud um\nfirst a time i got i saw porn\ni think it was in my early teens and it\nwas mainly out of curiosity\num but now that i look back i think i\nwas kind of using it to\nkind of escape my bullying and my very\ntoxic relationship with my parents\nand um\nsorry give me a sec\num and uh\ni didn't think much about it and uh i\nmoved to america when i was 15.\nand uh as my life started getting worse\num\ni started using porn more as an escaping\ntool\nand uh to escape my insecurities mainly\nbecause of my bad relationship\nespecially with my parents\nand um\ni started using it as a stress tool and\nas a sleeping tool\nas a stress relief tool and as a\nsleeping tool and\num my depression my anxiety and my\ntrauma got\nchildhood trauma i got very bad over\ntime and the more and more\ni got i felt deeper into depression the\nmore and more i started using porn\nand uh eventually i kind of had like uh\ni fell down very low i did stuff i\ndidn't want to do\nlike partying and being with people i\ndon't want to be and\ni kind of lost it mentally and\ni started a self-help journey after that\nand i've been doing really good\nand like doing good in school and\nexercising and\nbreathing and meditating and uh i real\nthe more and more i started helping\nmyself the more and more started\nrealizing that\ni'm addicted to porn uh i didn't want to\nadmit it\nbut um starting january i started really\ntaking care of myself\nand uh i took it as a challenge to start\nnofap\nto prove to myself that i'm not addicted\nto porn and the exact opposite happened\ni um i couldn't last for more than a few\ndays\nand when i came back i was binging\nall day it consumed me i would do it\nfive six times in a row um very\nunhealthy and\nmy whole day was just porn and and\nfapping\nand for months now i haven't been able\nto keep a\nstreak longer than a week and actually\ntoday will make my longest streak\nof seven days and um\nit's uh porn addiction i think is just\npart of the puzzle\nand um for me it kind of\nfits with depression and anxiety and um\nwhat i'm trying to learn from this\nstream is mainly uh i guess the only\nthing always holding me back from\nkeeping a very long streak\nis um i kind of asked myself why am i\nuh defying my urges like i feel great\nwhen i'm on nofap uh\ni feel very good i feel normal as you\nwould say and then when i binge i feel\nhorrible but\nthe urges feel great like the pleasure\nso i don't know if i'm doing something\nwrong by\ndefying my pleasures or defying the\nurges\nfor like feeling normal on no fap\nand sorry if i was speaking for too long\nbut i guess that's it no that that's\ngreat man\nit's bonnie yeah any\nany okay\nso that that was awesome in productions\neveryone i think um if it's okay with\nyou guys i'm gonna just\ntry to outline like kind of a thread for\nour discussions today\ni'm gonna point out a couple of themes\nand then propose sort of a\norder to tackle them so\nthe first thing i think we should talk a\nlittle bit about is\num you know how do you understand if\nyou're addicted to porn so i'm hearing\nfrom many people\nthat they had kind of this journey where\nthey like sort of figured out at some\npoint\ni'm addicted to porn and that this is\nnot okay\ni think related to that a lot of people\nhave mentioned that they find\ntheir addiction to be harmful um\nand you know some people have mentioned\nscience or consequences or things like\nthat\nso maybe we can talk first of all about\nhow you know you're addicted to porn\nsecondly about what's harmful or\nunhealthy about it\nthird is kind of exploring so everyone\nseems like they\nadd some difficulties or challenges and\nthat they use porn as an escape\nso i think we should sort of think a\nlittle bit about that idea of porn as an\nescape\nthe other interesting uh thing that that\npeople have mentioned is that as they\nstart to do nofap\nthings come up for them right so i think\nthat's something that is very very\nuh that's something that is very poorly\nunderstood\nso like even if we define and people\nhave a sense of like\nyou know this is what porn addiction is\ni think one of the challenges that\nhappens is like as you start doing nofap\nor something else\nas you take away the coping mechanism\neverything that it's been\nbalancing is going to come back up\nso what's that experience been like for\nyou guys so um\nand then yeah so like numb things coming\nup\nstuff like that and then um i think one\nperson said\ni think it was bob who said you use the\nphrase intensification of weirdness i'm\nnot sure exactly what he was referring\nto\nbut you know it sounds like that the\njourney has certain challenges that are\nunexpected\nand hopefully as we understand like what\nwe're dealing with we can get\nbetter at dealing with it um then what\ni'd like to kind of\nthink a little bit about is how you guys\ngot to nofap\nlike what nofap is what's been y'all's\nexperience of nofap and maybe that has\nsomething to do with the coping\nmechanisms as well and what comes up\nuh and then we can think a little bit\nabout\num brahmacharya and what that means\nbecause i imagine a lot of people\ndon't know what y'all are talking about\num what\nwhat your experience with our community\nhas been\nuh and then the last thing that we'll\nkind of explore\nis sort of like how to move forward so\nthis will be a discussion\num you know some people have mentioned\nthat they've tried behavioral treatment\nuh things about defying the urge how can\nwe understand\nurges how can can we understand what's\nhealthy what our body is doing what our\nmind is doing\nand and sort of maybe try to think a\nlittle bit about like how to take\nanother step forward for those of you\nwho have done\nlonger streets maybe you can share with\nus\nyou know what you've been able to do or\nhow you were able to do it\nand we can talk a little bit about\nstreaks and you know how long they last\nand what makes them easy what makes them\nhard\ndoes that sound okay this all sounds\ngreat sounds good yeah\nokay nice so let's start with how do you\nknow you're addicted to porn\num can i prefer something because it\ngoes like\nhand in hand with what nofap is and how\nwe\nlike how we realized um\n[Music]\nso like nofap started off by like one\nguy\num on the internet i don't know his name\nbut he started like a community where he\nwas trying to build awareness for porn\naddiction\nand he introduced it as like a challenge\ni think of 30 days to just try and\nstop consuming pornography and\nlike pmo so like pawn masturbation and\norgasm\nand he basically built like\na pretty big community around him\nthere's a popular subreddit that's\ncalled nofap\nand basically i think all of us\nrealized because we tried to quit and\npersonally i looked at the nofap website\nand i saw that there were like some\nphysical symptoms that people with\nlike abuse of masturbation had like for\nexample\num issues with\nerections or um performing\num in bed with actual people in\ncontrast to master bedding on your own\nor something like\na a fog in your mind that you can't\nreally think clearly from times to times\nand i\nbasically checked like every single mark\nor every box on that list and\nyeah i thought it was um um\ntime to try and quit okay\nwhen you say fog is that\nduring like is that like pretty constant\nor is does that\nchange with fapping or not fapping\num before quitting i wasn't really sure\nwhat it meant\nbut um basically when you\nabstain from it like a longer time you\nsee that\nfor like a really long constant time\nyou've been thinking differently\nand maybe you didn't have as much focus\nin that time when you were like\nrelapsing every day or like a couple\ntimes a day\nso it was like a constant thing okay\ngreat thanks for sharing\nanybody else wanna chime in about how\nthey\nfigured out they were addicted sure um\nto me i think like of porn as a escaping\ntool\nright and uh when thinking of any\nescaping tool in my eyes\num you you see that you're using it\nlike if it helps you escape you you\nunderstand if you're\nspending hours like on twitch or youtube\nor video games right\nonce you've done it for for a while\nyou're like okay\nwell i've been using this for a long\ntime i must be escaping right\nand then it also comes to understanding\nwhy you're using everything\nso to me at least with porn it was like\ni realized that i'm it's just a habit\nanytime i\nfeel sad or stressed out i would use it\ni would try to escape it\nso once i realized that there was a\nthere was a\nsystem right i guess stress i get\nanxious i get sad i use\nporn that's what i realized that like oh\ni need it every time i i i get those\nfeelings\nthat's what i thought was addicting and\ni try to deny it and then what also\nproved it to me was\nonce i started nofap i couldn't deny it\ni\ni needed it when i felt those feelings\nlike when those feelings came back like\nanxiety depression whatever right\nwhatever insecurities i had\nand i didn't have that tool i felt i\nfelt horrible\ni felt like i needed to escape and porn\nis\neasily the most instant gratification\nfor the least amount of work uh and it\nalso helps with relationships\nlike like um when you're insecure with\nrelationships and stuff\nso it's a very common very common\nescaping tool\nbob i saw thanks a lot uh andy\nthank you bob i i saw you nodding\nemphatically at one point\nyeah so uh i i\ni was thinking that like when there's a\npoint where you can tell\nthat that your behavior and your life is\nrevolving around this thing and\nyou know that there's some component in\nit that makes you feel better you're\nhitting that\ndopamine button over and over and over\nagain and\nyour for me it got bad to the point\nwhere\na lot of lack of sleep watching it\nconsume my time and behavior\nit got obvious to me but the only point\nwhere i realized it was\nthat bad of an addiction is whenever the\nidea was put in my mind that you could\ntry to quit\nand that maybe this isn't good for you\nyou know\nand like he said whenever you can't stop\nyou just know that this thing has\ncontrol over your your desire and your\nbehavior and it's\nthe effects are not you know just um\nyou know but trivial they're they're\nthey're pretty they've been pretty\nserious\nthanks for sharing that if i can add to\nthat for a second\num yeah it seems like um\nwhen you relapse at least for me i don't\nknow if this is for anyone else\nit feels like every like you're kind of\ncontrolled by as as bob said it\nkind of controls your like actions and\nemotions and\nyou become someone else when for me i\nbecome someone else\nwhen i relapse my whole for me i mean\nat best it's my whole day sometimes my\nwhole week\nright like when i relapse because i\nbecome it it like it controls me i feel\nlike i'm not myself that's why\ni feel no fap is so great when you're on\nit because i feel normal i guess is what\nyou say but\nyeah i just want to add to that okay we\ncan talk about some of that\nyeah the thing is for me when it started\nwhen i discovered nofap it was just\ni didn't have this realization that for\nexample\ni how would you put it\nit wasn't like i was in a deep mess it\nwas just like\npurely for the religious purpose and so\num it just it was basically just this\nand\nhaving like a very big spiritual aspect\nwas for me a bit really big um helping\npoints\nfor trying to quit because i knew now i\ni'm just i'm distancing myself from the\nsin and i can be\ni no longer have to be too much ashamed\nof it\nand really feeling like some\nkind of spiritual or like big\nmeaning behind it and like some\nconnection to\ngods and maybe nature\nwait did he crash or is it just me yeah\ni think\nhe lied out i gotta get scared\nokay well we'll we'll come to back to\noutside when\nhe's he's back with us um\nanybody else kind of want to add how\nthey kind of\nyeah go for it yeah so i'd say the way\nthat i found out that i was addicted was\nit became routine\ni would do it every day i would think\nlike do i even want to watch porn\ntonight or like right now\ni would think no and i would still do it\nand i'd say an easy way for someone\nwatching to figure out\nif they're addicted to porn is to try to\ngo let's say one week\ntwo weeks without it and see if there's\nany kind of like\nyou know want for it or desire and\nlike i have a friend who i bet 20 bucks\nand he's pretty broke i bet 20 bucks\nthat he couldn't go two weeks without\nyou know watching porn\nand he went like i think it was like six\nor seven days so\ni mean most people can't really go that\nlong without it so in my opinion that\nmeans they're probably addicted\num what's what also plays like a role is\nthat it's not\nit doesn't mean you don't have sexual\ndesires like for most of us\nit it isn't even like a sexual thing\nanymore\nbecause um like\nabstaining from porn doesn't mean you\ncan't like touch yourself\nor have sexual thoughts or anything\nbut it's let's say purely the the pawn\nthat you're addicted to\nsome people try nofap which includes not\nmasturbating\nbut um like you can check if you're\naddicted to pawn by just quitting pawn\nand you can still have all the desires\nthat's like not\ninteresting yeah that that's a really\nimportant point\ni think so so it's it's not just the\nmasturbation\ncomponent or the orgasm component there\ncan be just a pure porn addiction where\nyou can still\nhave other kinds of sexual activity i\ncompletely agree\num it it really seems like a dopamine\nhijack\nlike the other stuff video game\naddiction internet addiction\nall that stuff it's just a different\nflavor i think\ngreat that's how i i think you uh cut\nout there you were talking a little bit\nyeah\nyeah i'm sorry for that no problem\nwhen did it cut out i think you were\ntalking a little bit about\nsort of the the advantage of having sort\nof a spiritual\ncomponent um something about a lack of\nshame\nthat that helped you kind of overcome\nshame yeah because it was\num at that time really like for me\na shameful thing and something in\ngeneral i didn't really\nidentify with even before like when all\nthe other\nguys in my class would talk about porn\nit was something i didn't like talking\nabout\nand then when the religious aspect came\nand said this is wrong and i need to\nstop that was\nsomething i could really identify with\nand\nas soon as i got over the first hurdles\nlike i always relapsed at day three\nand then when i got over that hurdle it\njust\nflowed from there naturally and i just\nfelt\na real sense of pride of controlling\nmyself\nand not engaging in this behavior i\ndon't want to be associated with\nand so also the spiritual\naspect really helped me because i felt\nlike\nit could be something because now i'm\natheist so things have changed since\nthen but\ni would say i associated with nofap\nsomething with a greater purpose like\nbeing a\ngodly man and just having pride in\nmyself that i can\nlike i can take control over myself\nwhich felt really good at that time\nyour religious journey sounds\nfascinating outside\nit's actually kinda um\n[ __ ] up because it wasn't\ni got into end time stuff and it was\nactually kind of traumatizing because\nat that time it shattered my whole world\nview\nand i was engaged in a lot of\nconspiracies and\nit's i'm in the i'm now really glad i'm\nout of it because\nit has gotten to a point where i cut\nsocial ties with friends\ni had but i kept\nthe nofap stuff because i know that it\nisn't just\nreligious bogus there's actually science\nbehind it and\nyeah cool sounds like a fascinating\nstory maybe for another day\num so do y'all wanna talk a little bit\nabout the harmful\neffects of of being addicted to\npornography\num i've got an idea about like uh\naddiction i just was the\nlast person to talk about go forward um\nso\nbased on what otsa said um essentially i\nview addiction in general as a spiritual\nmalady i was talking about this with bob\nand a couple others uh last night and\nwhat i view addiction is is it's a\nspiritual malady in the sense that\nthere's a so this is a very catholic\ninterpretation of things but everybody\nhas a god-shaped hole in their heart and\neverybody tries to fill it with\nsomething else whether it be porn\nor drugs or alcohol everybody has\nsomething\nwhich they need and what religion\nand spirituality tells us is what we\nneed is the divine so\nbrahmacarya uh with saud guru said is\nthat it's one\non the path to the divine and it is the\npursuit of joy\ninstead of the pursuit of pleasure and\njust add on what everybody else was\nsaying\num i'd say that if you\nif you my biggest definition of\naddiction is if you try to stop\nbut you find that you cannot that's\naddiction\nlike the the harmful effects and\neverything else comes later\nit might not be there right now but if\nyou try to stop and you can't so try to\ngo a week\nwithout uh fapping and if you can't you\nmight be an addict\nokay yeah that i think that's go ahead\nannie yep i think uh\nfor me addiction is\ni just had a brain fart i'm sorry um\ni think you were about to say something\nabout what your understanding of\naddiction was or how you define it\nyeah i just forgot what my point was\ngonna be no problem i'm sure it'll come\nback up um\ni'll let you know so um let's think a\nlittle bit about\nso we can talk about addiction as a\nspiritual malady maybe towards the end\nand just how we understand\nyeah uh i figured out um why i think\nporn addiction is so\nbad is because it's a instant\ngratification tool\nyou're doing pretty much minimal work\nin seconds or minutes or whatever and\nyou're getting\nthe one of the biggest dopamine effects\nas you can\nfrom from uh you know pleasure like\nsexual pleasure\num and i think that's very toxic to\nbecause it kind of sucks you into like\nnot put any work\nand uh get instant gratification for it\nunlike with like going out and searching\nfor\nfor like a partner and uh having a\nrelationship with them an intimate\nrelationship and\nhaving sex as a connection rather than\njust\nan instant gratification tool i think\nthat's what's horrible about porn\naddiction\nor even you know even trying attempting\nto\nyou know deal with those thoughts and\nemotions about how to relate to other\npeople\nto connect with other people you know\nit's just much easier to just\nhave this compulsion and desire and then\nthat goes away\nyeah we'll definitely get to that\num i i think in terms of how to move\nforward i'm going to kind of table some\nof those ideas about\nwhat addiction is and and how we\nunderstand it\nwhat would you guys say are the harmful\neffects\nof uh porn addiction\num there's one thing i i'm still like\nreally worried about which is\num over sexualization which means that\num whenever i'm at like a bus stop\nand i see like attractive\nwomen um my\nhead goes right into like sexual\nfantasies\nand stuff like that um and i don't\nlike i don't have sexual desires at that\npoint\nbasically like i'm not horny but um\ni fantasize instantly and\num like\nthat can even mess with friendships\nfor example that you just can't see\na person that like likes you for who you\nare\nother than as like this object\nand it sucks because i know that\num it's not right and i'm\nkind of being addicted to that person\nbut i have no\nway of um like it's not like uh\nthere's no off switch to that it's just\nlike a like a mode my mind goes into\nwhen i see attractive people\nso i wanted there was also yeah if i\ncould just say one\nyeah okay go ahead real quick outside so\ni want to just\nhighlight something that we'll get back\nto so i want you guys to notice for a\nsecond that\nwhat flow is saying is that he says he's\nbeing a dick\nbut i don't think that that's accurate\nso what's happening is that flow's mind\nis automatically doing like so he's like\nhe laid it out pretty well right so\nhis mind automatically turns on a\nparticular program\nwhenever he gets it gets exposed to\ncertain stimuli\nand flow himself doesn't want to think\nthose thoughts and he's not even horny\nso if we think about like horniness\nhorniness is sort of like a\num you know it's sort of like a whole\nbeing kind of thing\nright and and what we can notice in flow\nis that his mind has a certain kind of\nlike automaticity to it\nthat he himself is not happy about but\nthat's not flow\nthat's just the way his mind has been\nprogrammed\nand we'll kind of get to that more but\noutside go ahead sorry\nyeah concerning the it's like the\nobjectification of women is definitely a\nbig part of\nporn and i saw that with a lot of my\nfriends at the time\nand it was also something which i wasn't\nreally\nlike usually it's it would be considered\nnormal but it was\nsometimes with my friends they would\ntalk just too much about how\nlike the body of a girl looks and how\nnice it is but they would never talk\nabout\nlike the human aspect of a girl and when\ni got\ninto my long streaks that definitely\nstarted for me when i could really go\nthere was the first time i really\nstarted to have friendships\nwith girls and not just have a\nsexual interest in them it's like there\nbut\nit's you start to develop more a\nholistic view of\na woman of girls you see more the\npersonality because at some point\nfor me it was like every girl looked\nthat good that the\nonly thing that would like\nis now differentiating them would be the\npersonality\nand it feels kind of nicer to not just\nlook at the body but also start seeing\nwomen as humans more which was for me\nnot the case before all of that how do\nthe rest of you all feel about what atai\nis saying\ni totally agree yeah um yes i feel like\nporn makes you objectify women a lot and\nonce you're on nofap\nfor me at least it felt like i could\nhave like just a normal conversation\nwith a girl without\nthinking anything or you know just\nviewing them as a human you know\nso what i think it is is a um a kind of\nperceptual distortion\nbecause there's that connection with the\ndopamine\nthing it's like um it's almost like it\nit primes for that\nand whenever you're taking that away\nyeah and pouring conditions you for that\ni mean no one\nno one ever just goes on the porn site\nand looks for\npersonality traits or something it's\njust um\nlike it's just like body parts\nand not a whole human that's the\ncategory makes you feel at home\nyeah and it's also the problem that has\ngotten really\nspecific and it is also\ntied to the desensitization with porn\naddiction\nwith you needing more and more extreme\nstuff\nlike i think for any one of us the stuff\nyou view at the beginning\ndoesn't stay the same and for some\npeople it gets\nreally extreme and i think that's why\nthere are these\nlike categories of stuff which you would\nnever\ndo in real life because\nlike the porn industry is just out for\nprofit\nand if people are desensitized to the\nstuff that is already there they need to\nproduce\nmore extreme stuff and that is also\na site of porn addiction which can be\nreally harmful that you are\ntraining your brain to only become like\nattracted to certain things which are\nreally\nfar from normality fantastical even\ni i think that's a great point um i do\nthink that porn\num kind of builds a lie\non what sex is supposed to be and\ni feel like it's kind of porn has kind\nof been integrated in the culture\nmore where we kind of kind of view sex\nmore as a transaction\nrather than a connection and i think\nthat's a big\nbig problem that porn builds and um\nyeah i guess that's my point so can i\nask a little bit like of an off-topic\nquestion that may be a\na touch controversial sure\nsure so there are communities on the\ninternet\nthat actually actively try\nto do the opposite of what you guys are\ndescribing which is to view women\nto view relationships with women as\ntransactional\num to think about women actively\nteach and advocate for a view that does\nnot\nview women as people but as like so i'm\nthinking predominantly of communities\nlike red pill\nare you all familiar with red pill yeah\nyeah yeah\nuh so does somebody want to explain what\nred pill is\nas far as i know it's just basically\nthere's a lot of they have the i think\nthey have the thoughts from\nevolution and they think that there are\njust certain evolutionary aspects that\nmake a man attractive\nlike status money and\nall that stuff and they are really into\ngaming\nor daytime game where they try to figure\nout the perfect way to approach women\nand to get just the they try to figure\nout the perfect way to\nconvince women to have sex with them but\nalso\nnot in the long term because they also\nthink that women have the\npolygamous nature and they also are\njust out for resources\nand not very like relationship on the\nhuman to human level\nit's just very animalistic thinking i\nwould say it sounds like an online\nfraternity\nyeah that's a great way to describe it\nso so like\nnegative yeah so what do you guys think\nabout that\nit's [ __ ] up why\num you're making the woman literally\nobjects in their eyes\nand they're not only doing it for\nthemselves but they're actually teaching\nit to others\nand spreading that toxic mindset\nbut what's what's wrong with that i know\nit sounds like a weird question\nbut um kind of like they were saying\nearlier i mean\nwomen are people too it sounds funny to\nsay it like that but they're people as\nwell like they're not\nyou know they're not like a you know\njust a way to have sex or you know an\nemotional like\ni don't know like island or whatever but\nthey're actual people who have feelings\nand you know it can hurt somebody to\njust take advantage of somebody\njust to have sex like the idea with the\nred red pill a lot of times is\nuh i see a girl you know i have sex you\nknow i\npretend that i really like her and want\nto be with her and then i have sex and\nthen i dump her\nand that idea is absolutely [ __ ] up\nthat's just using somebody as a means to\nan\nend and not an end of itself\ni think there's a lot of uh resentment\nand fear of loss\nin there that you know i can't be loved\nfor just being me\nlike it has to be status or money or\nwhatever\nyeah it's just a very simple way of\nlooking at you know it's easy\noh um yeah as that was actually exactly\nwhat i was about to say it's a very\nsimplistic view\nof human relations um and using\nlike evolutionary psychology is still a\nburgeoning field and we still don't know\neverything\nbut the thing about the red pill is that\nthey say that they are an authority on\nthis so\nas you were saying earlier uh the actual\nideology\nis men are polygamous which means they\ntry to find as many women as possible\nand\nessentially spread the seed and have as\nmany as have as many men or have so\nsorry\nhave as many women as possible um and\nimpregnate as many women as possible and\nwomen are hypergamous\nwhich means they try to find the\ntop-tier man\nin their lives um and try to get\nimpregnated by that\nperson but it really and completely\nsidelines\nthe entire emotional process behind\nrelationships\nand it's all about tricks and it seems\nlike devious and\nit by itself is part of the seduction\ncommunity and\nit's it in itself is basically like\nsaying you\nare a beta and we are chads\nso we know what's best um so in order to\nhave sex\nyou need to listen to what chad said\nthat's essentially what it is and it's\nvery intoxicating how they recruit\nwhat do you guys think that that people\nwho are a fan of red pill philosophy\nwould say about y'all\nthat we're weak yeah that we are blue\npills\nyeah or beta so for what it actually is\ni think also are you all simps is that\nan\nanother no it could be a symbol\nit's a little bit different i would say\ni i'm\nso what do you guys think about that are\nyou weak i'm just kind of\ni'm just kind of annoyed by all of the\nlanguage period\nlike it suffuses the internet like\nhonestly i it annoys me and i don't\ncare really because i try to treat\npeople on an individual basis\nbut it's still there nonetheless\nand you can turn it around i would say\nlike most of the time with these red\npill guys they don't invest\nemotions into the relationships and they\ntry to stay\naway from that and i don't want to get\nhurt i would say\nin these short-term pleasures because\nyou you can\nyou can keep like a fantasy alive and\njust have the\nnot the thought of like a\nwoman that is not a human but more like\na\nstatus symbol and a number you can say\nlike how\nmany girls you have slept with and\ni would say there's a lot of emotional\ndetachment from these guys because\ni think many of them have been hurt in\nthe past and they just just don't want\nthat to happen again\nyeah i agree our problem was that we\ndidn't want to\nface our emotions so we use porn as an\nescape\nand with the red pill the idea is\nthere's no emotional aspect to\ntalking to women so there's no reason to\nhave to worry about facing emotions it's\nkind of like exactly what we're trying\nto avoid it's like it's very like\nstimulus response\nit's like not emotional at all it's like\ni'm trying to get\nthese inputs if i were to i mean i'm\ngoing to draw kind of uh\nyeah go for it uh i was gonna i was\ngonna say for me personally\num i'm still trying to think like\nis it wrong to be overly sexual because\nbecause i've had a sexual relationship\nbefore right\nsexual transactions i would say and the\ngirls\nin those relationships they didn't mind\nthey wanted to be a transaction\nbut at the end of it i felt emo\nemotionally not completed\nlike i didn't feel fulfilled emotionally\nand that's what\nreally strayed me away from just having\ntransactions as i was calling with girls\nbut they didn't mind so i'm like well if\nthey don't mind\nwhy is this so wrong so i think i'm kind\nof neutral on the topic\num i do think the internet has made it\nvery\neasy to over sexualize and\nyou know build kind of societies or\nwhatever like red pill\num i think it's a i think it's a side\neffect of the internet but i might be\nwrong\nand how kind of culture and porn since\nit's so accessible how it's integrated\nin the culture\nso if i'm hearing you guys it's\ninteresting because i think moon was\nsort of suggesting that\nemotional hurt and the avoidance of\nemotional hurt basically has like a\ncouple of strategies one is that you can\nbecome addicted to porn and that allows\nyou to have an escape\nthe other is that you can actively and\nintentionally sort of objectify women\nremove emotional emotional stuff\nfrom uh relationships and it kind of\nbecoming transactional\nit almost sounds to me like like you\nknow there's a fork in the road\nand and you know a common like a 13 year\nold kid on the internet could\nwind up like start in one place and\ncould wind up\nin any number of communities that share\na common route\nwhat do you guys think about that\nabsolutely absolutely\ni think i agree interesting so\nonce again maybe a conversation for a\ndifferent day because we have\num you know a couple of other things so\nlike\nyeah may i add two two little things\nfirst of all\num i know we are all guys here but\ni've read online that girls have similar\nissues\nsome girls so if you are like a girl\nwatching this stream\nit's not only guys that have been\naddicted to pornography masturbation\nand the other thing is i don't think we\nare really\ni mean i think we are weak like\non like the emotional aspect because we\nstill like\nneed that numbing effect but when\ni see chats i would suspect\nuh use red bull i always think like at\nleast we\nare conscious of it and we are actively\ntrying to\nfight against it and we are like one\nstep ahead of them\nso what i've heard too is let's say i\nwas 16 years old when i first started\nwatching porn all the time\nand let's say for the last you know\nlet's say six years let's say i'm 22 now\ni've watched porn every day i'm pretty\nmuch like\nemotionally i'm still 16 years old\nbecause i\nnever really faced any emotions since i\nwas 16.\nso i never really grew up in that sense\nthat's kind of a common problem i've\nseen with some people\nyeah i want to talk a lot i mean this is\nsomething that i've been writing a lot\nabout about how like\num is a community like we're stunted\ndevelopmentally like we get stuck\nsometimes in terms of our growth and\nit's it's almost like we stall\nand i've been thinking a lot about how\nto help people like get unstuck\ni don't think i get that could you\nelaborate that a bit\nyeah so it's a half form thought um\nannie first of all\nbut basically like you know moon was\nsaying that\nhe feels like he like when he started\nwatching porn every day like he didn't\ncontinue to develop as a human being\nlike even at the age of 22 he sort of\nstill has the emotional\nlike his his you know emotional skill\nlevel hasn't leveled up at all so he's\nlike stuck\nat like level five or whatever he wasn't\nso he hasn't been gaining any xp\nand just as a community i think we tend\nto get developmentally stuck in a lot of\nways like\nin terms of the development of our\nsocial skills in terms of our ability to\nunderstand and manage our emotions\nin terms of expectations that we have\nfor ourselves in terms of like really\nreally simple stuff like\nhow to plan and execute tasks\ni i think as a community we're sort of\ndevelopmentally stunted like i think we\ndon't have good role models\nso um you know recently we had a we had\na couple weeks ago we had a group of\nfemale gamers who came on and i think\nthat like the the men that they interact\nwith online like\ndon't know how else to act\ncan i say something because i actually\nwrote an\nexam on it today in developmental\npsychology\nand i read something from\n1973 and\nit was like psychoanalytic stuff but it\nbasically talked about that\nthe adolescence phase like between 12\nand 20 is the time where the sexuality\nreally develops\nand because like today\nin the text he says that in this time\nyou seek\nfor like sexual like\nsexuality in your peer group and girls\nin school and stuff like that\nbut at that time no one has the\nidea of internet porn and in\npsychonautic theory the\nreality principle is really important\nwhere you have to adapt to\nyour reality and i think with\nonline stuff and especially porn and\nvideo games you can really escape into\nanother world and i think your\nthe human brain doesn't grasp the idea\nof virtual reality and so\nbecause there are when you go out and\nwant to\nlike get a girlfriend there are so much\nmore\nchallenges you have to overcome and you\nhave to go through\ndifficult feelings like feeling\nsometimes worthless or unlovable and you\ndon't\nexperience these things with porn and\nyou don't go through these little\ncrises and so i think that is something\nreally important on the developmental\nside that\nthere are so many more ways to just\nescape the\nusual normal um developmental\ntasks a human has to go through\nyeah absolutely that's a great point i\nthink we're\nwe're developmentally stunted for sure\nis a community\num so let's kind of\nshift gears a little bit so like you\nguys were kind of\na common theme that's come up and and\neven in terms of like the red pillars\nin their emotional detachment we've\ntalked about escapism\nwe've talked about numbness and numbing\nfeelings\nand we've also talked a little bit about\num how nofap\ntends to bring out feelings\nso can you guys explain to us a little\nbit about like\nyou know what is it that you that porn\nhelped you escape from\nhow did it help you escape and then\nwe'll kind of cover\nwhat happens when you stop escaping\num i think it's uh i think it's all\nright uh\ni think it's a a good point to kind of\nbase off from flo what he said\ni think porn gives a a one-sided\nrelationship\nso for me i try and escape my horrible\nrelationship with my parents\nwhich was not obviously sexual but um\nit was it was a very toxic uh horrible\nrelationship\num very abusive and uh porn kind of\ndoesn't have the other person to talk to\njust kind of\nyou get what you want you you get\nexactly what you want in seconds and\nyeah in regards to\nnumbing um like one of the first things\ni told my psychologist\num the way i feel when i\nwatch porn i have no idea what time it\nis\ni don't even know how much time i spend\non the computer\nat that point i um\ni have like tunnel vision into my pc\nlike i don't even notice anything around\nme\nwhich\nbasically shows itself when i um when my\nplace is like really\num\nlike dirty and i didn't like make my bed\nor something like that\num because i would just like\nwatch my pc only and nothing else\nand um while i'm watching porn i\nhave no worries i don't think about any\nstressful thing\ni have no anxiety like it was pretty\nhard not to\nwatch porn today because i was so\nnervous to be\nhere and um\nit just like helps with like every\nfeeling you want to numb basically\nit's got you it's like you have like\nthis little bubble like this little safe\nlittle safe bubble of pleasure that like\neverything outside of it is just not\nthere\ni had a circuit oh okay\num i did this was i just needed to get\nthis off my mind because i'd say that a\nlot of what\nuh buddhism talks about is the\nrenunciation of the ego\nand pornography is essentially\nthat uh heightening of the ego and a lot\nof\nuh drugs and psychic uh you know\nthings can also heighten the ego in this\nway i would say that porn is a\nmaladaptive\ncoping mechanism first of all and it is\nalso\nin a sense the worship of the self with\na harem of imaginary woman\nand your brain really does not know the\ndifference so every time you masturbate\nto a fantasy\num uh it can cause and i mean there are\nsymptoms\nlike low brain performance brain fog\nmemory issues\nwhen you masturbate because of that like\nrefraction period\nwhere it says your brain is telling you\nor your body is telling you you have\norgasm\nyou can now just relax and do nothing\nand i would say\nlast point that my emotional issues\nkind of stem from like not really ever\nhaving like a good sexual relationship\ni'm 22 right now i've never been in a\nsexual relationship\nlet alone a relationship with with a\ngirl and i'm courting this girl right\nnow and every time she doesn't respond i\nknow she works a lot\ni'm just like oh she's not responding uh\nmy brain is just like go find another\nwoman to talk to and for me it was just\nalways\nporn and that numbed my feelings for the\nlongest time\ni would say i'm emotionally stunted um\nlike moon was saying\ni'm still stuck in the mind of basically\nlike an 11 year old because that's when\ni started using\num every time you masturbate to escape\na feeling i would say it's a maladaptive\ncoping mechanism\nand it can cause serious harm to your\nbrain and\ngoing on nofap and stopping fapping\nallows your brain to return to normal\nthat symptomology\nslowly but surely disappears\nmoon i saw you nodding and smiling at\nsome point too\nyeah um going off of what you said\nearlier too is easy is\nuh almost like you know we have the hole\nin our heart like a god shaped hole as\nyou described it\nand filling that with porn is an easy\nway to like\nit's almost like a band-aid you know you\ndon't heal that hole or you don't fill\nit with anything\nyou know worth while but you cover it up\nand kind of ignore it for a while\nand it builds up and um for me\nwhat [ __ ] kind of comes up whenever uh\nwhenever i like\nyou know get into a streak is kind of\nlike usually what i would use it to uh\nlike numb was like feeling lonely or uh\ndepressed\nand you know i wouldn't feel alone\nwhenever my brain thought i had a\npartner on a screen\nso you know i could go to bed and i'd\nyou know fall asleep just fine because\ni'd be like you know\nmy brain thinks i have a partner and i\nkind of just [ __ ] with the entire\nwiring of my head and how\nmy brain thinks of things and [ __ ] like\nthat\nso let me ask you guys a question why is\nit so\nhard to have a hole\nin you right like i don't know how else\nto ask question but like\nwe're using this kind of terminology\nthat you have you have this like hole in\nyour heart that\nis in the shape of god so like what\nmakes\nlike why is that a bad situation like\nwhy does some\nlike you know what about your life has\nis intolerable\nso that you read this in the first place\nyeah i've heard describe also like being\nlike a shell of a person\nand like you almost feel empty inside\nit's kind of like a similar idea to that\ni mean you don't want to feel empty\ninside or a shell of a person you want\nto be\nyour whole true self and so what what\nmakes like what is that feeling of being\na shell of a person i like that\nterminology a lot\num it's almost like just living life on\nautopilot you just kind of like you know\nyou wake up\nyou do your your [ __ ] you kind of don't\nreally think about things you're kind of\nlike in a constant state of like being\nalmost like\ni guess sedated in a way not really\nsedated but like you're not really\nchecked into\nreality you're kind of like living it's\nlike the brain fog like we were saying\nearlier\nyou're not really like seeing clarity\nand you're not like trying to improve\nyourself\nyou're kind of like it's like\nsurrendering and being okay with being\nless than normal\nand like you know i'm not happy with\nwhere i'm at\nbut because i use porn every day i can\nignore that and\ni i'm okay even though on the inside i'm\n[ __ ] up on the outside i can be okay\ni um i feel like while you're\num relapsing like oh well you\naddicted you don't really notice that\nwhole like at all\nlike um you think it's\nlike you're fine and your emotional\nstate is like really fine but once you\nquit\nyou just realize that there is a hole\nand um\nbecause you have been like numbing your\nemotions for\nsuch a long time it is even harder to\ndeal with that hole than it would have\nbeen if you\njust learned how to deal with things\nthat don't work out\nas well or something like that so let's\ntalk about that for a second\nso how did you guys come to\nnofap and how did y'all make a decision\nto\nto try to stop masturbating\num probably uh your brain on porn\num i don't know how many people here\nhave\nlike heard about that a website right\nit's a website\nwell it was a video by this guy um gary\nwilson and he has like a whole\npresentation on it and everything\nand it just really got in my head that\nyou know i noticed\nthe emotional and physical and\nperceptual distortions but i didn't\nthink about it in terms of\nlike an actual addiction and after that\ni went to the subreddit and\ni mean really it had been five to six\nyears of\ntrying to stop relapsing rationalizing\ntrying to stop again that sort of\npattern\num for me a friend recommended to me for\nmy depression\nit really helped him and uh\ni didn't think much of it at first i\nthought it was kind of just more of a\nchallenge\nuh but um i realized for me in my\njourney\nthat uh escapism is the worst thing for\nme\nbecause i'm just avoiding all my\nproblems that i need to be facing in my\nlife\nand porn is easily one of the easiest\nways to escape\nso i made it i wanted to i'm trying to\nget rid of all of my escapism like in\nvideo game\nescaping mechanisms like video games\ntwitch and or limit them\nand um porn is just one of them and i\nthought\nwell what can i do to ask to not use\nporn as an escaping tone\nnofap is what came to mind since a\nfriend recommended to me a while ago\nand what has been y'all's experience of\nnofap\nwell i'm sorry yeah for me yeah for me\num at first i didn't really feel\nanything i felt like i'm just doing a\nsuper challenge\nbut over time i uh of like a week of\nrelapsing and\na week of not being of being on nofap um\nwhile i'm doing nofap i felt very\nenergetic and i felt very um i felt\nmore alive and i felt like i'm starting\nto take action more\num and uh when i'm relapsing uh i just\nfelt horrible i felt like i'm being\nconsumed\nso while on nofap for me in my\nexperience i felt more\nfree i feel like i'm not being\ncontrolled my i'm taking my own actions\ni'm myself right uh and it's\nit's the same with any other escapism i\nthink yeah\nthis one to me seems especially strong\nbecause it's so\nlike um it's so carnal\nand it's so obsessive um\ni think the first week usually i notice\nfor most people the first three days of\nthe first week\ntends to be the hardest um and it'll\nusually fall in that pattern\nuh they'll feel like a boost of energy\ni'm starting to feel normal again\nand then from a week to two weeks\nthat that you know that that dopamine\nthing starts to go down and there starts\nto be that withdrawal feeling again and\nthat seems to be whenever all the\nnegative feelings start coming up again\nand this will go in waves so um once it\ncomes to like\ntwo weeks to four weeks to six weeks\nthat's when\num you'll start to feel\nand see some some perceptual healing\nlike\nuh motivation to be around friends uh\nnot sexualizing people like a lot of\nthose things get better\num the farthest i've gotten so far has\nbeen like 45 days\nmoon 45 days at sci-70\num flow believe it or not like a year\nright yeah\num it was one year\nbasically um one last day so\n364 days um\nbecause i thought like why celebrate a\nyear if you can just [ __ ] it up on the\nlast day\nbut um um\nthat's when i realized that like\nbasically masturbation wasn't\nthe issue for me because i um i didn't\nmake a year without pornography but i\nmade a year without masturbation so\ni realized that that wasn't\nlike the fight i had to go through\nand um go ahead\nfinish first um like the effects\n[Music]\num like the main effects were that i\ngot very emotional um\nit was like the first time that i cried\nin a few years that\ni was able to even experience good days\nand bad days\nbecause beforehand i had just like the\nsame\n[ __ ] every day and it really didn't\ndidn't feel any different\nso i had some ups and some downs\nwhich was really exciting\nand i would cry to like\ni don't know i think like stranger\nthings\num like series finales and stuff like\nthat\nbecause it was just like overwhelming\nseeing like emotion\nin in like a series or something and um\nat that time i got together with my\ngirlfriend right when i stopped\nand i think i still like owe\nthat time to her because like\nmy whole like a part of my whole is not\nlike feeling\nlike loved and respected and i got that\nfrom her and\nso it went really well like for the\nfirst few months because i\ni didn't really need to\ndeal with those issues because i\nfelt loved and i felt respected yeah\ndefinitely for me\nthere are two things first of all i\nwanted to say most people assume when\nthey try\nto quit and that's what i heard from\nmany friends that it just\nbuilds up builds up it's up and i don't\nreally feel\nthe benefits of feeling more confident\nthey just feel\nreally really horny extremely and it's\nreally\nuncomfortable for them and i felt the\nsame but at some point\nyour brain realizes that it doesn't get\nany more porn\nand just starts to focus on other things\nand for me also that was the time when\ni've\nreally felt like connected to my\nemotions\nand could i could really show my\nemotions because i always wanted to\ntalk to people and laugh and\num like show yeah basically show my\nemotions to people\nand that was possible in that time and\nalso\ni think you can't just quit porn and\nthen\nlike if you are addicted it has already\ntaken\nlike a seat in your brain and you need\nto fill that seat with\nsomething because i know from that time\nit was\nthe feeling of god and like like you\nsaid flow\nlike the feeling of love like with god\nit was just like an\ninfinite source no matter where i go and\ni was bike riding a lot in nature\nand just seeing a tree was for me like a\nsymbol\nof the creative power\nand love of gods and so i really had\na good replacement for the porn\naddiction\ni can agree with that um i've i mean as\nfar as like if we're going to separate\nthis from\nlike like psychology and trauma and just\ntalk about the spiritual side of it\nit's like if you're doing it along with\ndifferent practices it's\nfantastic it's beautiful it's a very\nvery wonderful thing\num go ahead go ahead okay um\nyeah i think there must be a reason why\nyou should be doing nofap like i don't\nthink\nyou're gonna succeed if you just say oh\ni'm just gonna try it\ni think you gotta have like a like a\npassion i guess almost like\nto for me it's to better myself in\ngeneral right to to battle my depression\nmy anxiety\nso for me i find more success when i\nthink about like\nwhat i'm how i'm trying to help myself\nso let me ask you guys a question what\nwhen you guys start to do nofap what\ncomes\nup um\ni i felt like a huge loss of identity\nwhen i stopped like um\ni remember that i was like sitting on my\nbed crying with my girlfriend next to me\nbecause\num i had like no idea\nwhat my dharma was like i had like no\nsense\num in life and i didn't know who i was\nbecause\num i just\nlike there were like these emotions that\ni couldn't figure out\nand they overwhelmed me and i um\ni actually feel like at that point i\nstuck to\nlike the um\nsense that overcoming the addiction is\nnow like the plan\ni'm gonna go with like my identity and\num i feel like that makes\nlike the relapse especially hard and the\nshame that comes with it\nbecause i'm basically um\ndoing something against my personality\nif i relapse\nyeah kind of like uh saying is like\nuh i'm currently on like day 50 of nofap\nand\ni felt like some more like energy and\nmotivation and like search for dharma\nlike search for purpose\nto like you know you know i'm like young\n20s so i'm kind of like finding where\ni'm going to go with my life\nand i have more energy in life just like\ni've been doing all these things that\ni've been putting out for years like\nmeditating working out um things like\nthat\nand i'm also like looking for like a\nfuture life goal\nand life purpose and not just like\nsitting in the same spot\nand you know in my own self you know\nhate or self sadness\ni'm actually moving forward in life but\ni mean i thought like negatives\nlike you guys are you guys are sounding\nso positive yeah\nyeah i'm gonna find my purpose in life\nlike right\nbro but you know does it sound like it's\na fun ride\nyeah can i play something which happened\nto me very recently it's\nyes long but very recently for me at the\nmoment my hurdle is like seven days\nand recently i got to 13 days but at\nstarting at day 7 i just cried\nevery single day for around 30 minutes\nto like an hour\nand it was just i felt like it was just\nall the stuff\ni've been pushing away and for me that\nwould be\nlike a lack of connection to another\nhuman because for me also like\nthese i've never been in a relationship\nand it was something that\nis like constantly on my mind and i've\nalways pushed that away\nespecially in that time where\ni had this long streak even beginning\nlike the longest week broke for me\nbecause\nalso that time started to like in my\nmind i was just saying\noh you know you need to get a partner\nyou need to get a girlfriend\nand i had some bad stuff\nhappening and that area and so\nit has been always something that i\npushed away all the time\nand also like with mgtow like that was\nlike oh yeah\ni'm just a perfect independent man i\ndon't need a woman i\ni just stay away from that but i know\nfor myself\ni feel like that for me is escapism like\ni know in my heart there's the\ndesire for a relationship but i've just\nignored that\nall my life and i feel like now it is\njust all\nhitting me in the face\ni will say the the very hard thing about\nnofap is\num it takes you out of the it takes you\nout of the loop right um\ntakes you out of what you're escaping so\nuh first few days or\nweeks you you will have to face your\nproblems\nand it's very very hard and it takes a\nlot of willpower\nand um also when i relapse\nfor me i i get devastated it it's\nhorrible it's one of the worst feelings\ni've ever had in my life\nevery time every seven days or whenever\ni relapse i i can't it's it's horrible\nit makes me feel very depressed i feel\nlike i'm not taking action i'm i don't i\ndon't have any willpower i'm not\ncapable it is very devastating\nbob did you want to say something\nwe were talking about negative emotions\non a streak right yeah\nyeah so like i\ni agree with everything that they've\nsaid um it's the feeling is like\nthere's that emptiness but there's also\num\nlike grief from my dad came up like\num frustration uh\nyou know loneliness like outside was\ntalking about\nyou know like all these things that were\num that were pushed away or not\nprocessed\nand definitely the more you do it and\nthe longer\nit goes like the deeper you can\nget in there you know and kind of pull\nsome of that stuff out\nso uh yeah it's easy oh um i would say\nthat a lot of what the negative emotions\nare like it's kind of like when you\nbottle something up like\na carbonated drink like this it's like\nevery time you well i mean that's\nliterally fattening but\num like every time you like shake it up\nit like bottles them up even more so\nthat when you do\nrelease like if i were to take the cap\noff of this after shaking it\nit explodes and you feel all these\nemotions come to you at once and you're\nlike\nso this is what anger and grief and\nsadness feel like\nand some people call that the flatline\nsome people call that there's a lot of\ndifferent things to call it flatline is\nnormally like a depression or something\nbut it\ndoes refer to um the like negative\nemotions that you can experience but\ni do find that if you're able to\novercome those negative emotions that\ni become a lot more productive and happy\nfor the most part it's just that every\nnow and then\ni have to feel i think i think flatline\nis a different thing i think\nwhat i heard from experiences from other\npeople flatline is a state where\nyour brain basically shuts off the\nsexual area or something like that and\nyou have people report that they have no\nlibido\nand they feel like after they have they\nhave the feeling when they\nlike after they have just relapsed for a\ncertain period of time\nand people say that is the time where\nthe brain just shuts everything down\nand you have like this sort of numbness\nagain but it's just that the brain can\nreally\nheal itself and\ni never had that personally but it's\njust like\njust worth the wording because that is\nsomething also people record\nso how do you guys so zizi is saying\nyou know if you can overcome the\nemotions\nhow do you do that how does that\nactually happen\nall this like you guys are opening up\nyou know\nall this past trauma feelings of sadness\nloneliness\nthis goes back to like friday's stream\nbut a lot of it is like finding a\ntherapist can really help i know i\nactually have a therapist and\ntalking with her helps me deal with a\nlot of my emotional [ __ ]\num as far as like by myself what i can\ndo is\nsit with the emotion and understand it\neither like you know meditate be mindful\nbe with\nit and try to resolve it or realize if\nit's not really an emotion that\ni'm actually feeling it's just a thought\nthat i think is an emotion just let it\ngo\nhow do you sit with an emotion\num i guess normally my instinct is to go\nlike\nwatch twitch youtube you know watch porn\nand avoid it but instead what i can do\nis uh\njust do nothing just sit there and like\nyou know observe like either my mind or\nmy body or how i\nuh react to it and almost just like\nunderstand what it really is\nand not just instinctually avoid it\nyeah learning to meditate has really\nhelped me with that\num for meditating for like two years now\nand just um being able to\nsee the emotion arise is like\nso powerful already um\nsometimes um when you don't have any\noption to numb yourself\num yeah you basically just sit there\nlike i was sitting with my girlfriend in\nthe\nin the car and something came up and i\nwas just\nlike really trying to feel\nwhat it felt like to be sad um\nand yeah just started crying and didn't\ndidn't\nstop myself basically but just waited\nand\num saw what it was\nwhat helps me at the moment is just\ngiving my\npast or just seeing myself and all the\nthings that have happened to me as sort\nof like a story\nand so because i was always very afraid\nof\nlike talking to girls and approaching\nthem is it has been a really big problem\nbut when you actually try to fix\nsuch the problem of yourself it feels\nextremely good and extremely meaningful\nand i think that is also like it gives\nthe whole\nlet's say it's called a journey a lot\nmore spirits\nand it's there's something definitely\nthat has helped me\num for me i feel like i'm still in a\njourney trying to understand my emotions\nand i\ni have tried seeking therapy but it's\nkind of very hard because of like trust\nissues and\num but what has helped me is taking\naction\nso um i've been doing cold showers and\ni've been\nexercising and running and um\nit really helps with willpower and um\nthat's what's helped me kind of like\nunderstand your emotions i'm trying to\nunderstand my emotions and then take\naction to\nsolve them or face them or you know\nunder\nat least kind of embrace them in a way\nrather than avoid them with porn\ndoes that hurt to face your emotions\nthough\nthis is something i was about to say um\ni think of it like like when you're\nsitting with like a really negative\nfeeling\ni think there's something courageous\nabout it because you\nhave to have it dwell inside of you like\nif it's grief\nor if it's pain or if it's anxiety you\nknow um\nthere's there also seems to be like an\nelement of um\nlike self-forgiveness is really useful\njust like\nunderstanding that like this is not\nwrong necessarily it's just\nit is what it is it's part of you\nand so speaking of self-forgiveness\nwhat's it like to relapse\nhow does that happen\nhow does it happen or how does it feel\nboth\nwha what leads to a relapse and then how\ndo you feel afterward\ni'm going to run off real quick and come\nback i drink too much water sorry\nfor me personally i would say it is when\ni lose focus because\ncurrently i have i would say i have a\ndharma\nand i have a clear reason why i want to\nstop this\nand it happens in times of boredom\nwhen i just lose focus on what i do want\nto do with my life and i just\nsort of and most of the times i am just\nlike mindlessly\nbrowsing on youtube videos or watching\nyoutube videos\nand that is the time\nlike when relapses happen the most for\nme is this in times where i lose\na side of the big picture i would say\num yeah i agree with losing focus i\nthink it's for me\nis uh i'll find myself always relapsing\non a day where i don't kind of do the\nhabits that i said i would do\nso if i said i'm going to wake up early\nand take a cold shower and go for a run\nand if i wake up at 2 p.m instead of 8\na.m\nand don't take a cold shower i'll take a\nhot shower i'll find myself\nsaying oh i'm okay i won't relapse today\nbut then eventually i will\nuh so taking action and staying\nconsistent not being consistent and\nlosing focus\nreally uh goes into makes me relapse a\nlot\nfor me it's uh different because even if\ni have like the greatest day\nand i did everything that i wanted\nthere's still like the same chance that\ni will relapse\num it's\nvery much like automatic there are\nthings that\ntrigger me for example like seeing like\nthumbnails on youtube\nor something like that um it often\ncomes with being tired being exhausted\nbeing stressed\n[Music]\nexperience experiencing feelings that\ni want to numb basically like feeling\nsad or feeling lonely\nand the relapse itself\nonce i've like\ndone a certain step for me probably if i\ntype in something in like my url bar\nit's already too late\nlike i still have thoughts like i need\nto quit now\ni don't want to do this but there's no\npoint because\nit's like one step too late already\nand like while\ni'm relapsing feel great don't feel\nanything\ndon't need to worry about anything and\nthen right afterwards\nlike it's lots of shame\nlots of um feeling like\ni um\ni've just it's a it's like pure failure\nbasically\nbecause um yeah disappointment\num i've disappointed myself i've\ndisappointed\nmy girlfriend like everyone basically\nand it really um yeah messes with your\nday\nbut for example the last time\nthat i relapsed i was able to call\npeople from this chat\nand was able to have a really great\nafternoon because\ni was able to share those emotions with\nthem and all of them\nknow exactly what i'm talking about\nhow do you feel about yourself when you\nrelapse\nplease can you tell them i was just\ngoing to say how do you feel about\nyourself when you relapse like what are\nthe thoughts that you have or\nyeah since uh for me personally since\nwhen it's\nwhen i feel like i'm not taking action\nwhen i relapse\ni just blame myself very very much for\nnot being responsible not taking\nresponsibility and uh\nnot taking action it's a horrible\nfeeling um\ni feel like uh i'm the only one that\ncould have prevented it and i did\nnothing about it\nso um my parents described me as a\ngenerally shameless individual i don't\nknow why i'm like that\nor maybe i just found that shame isn't\nreally useful to prevent\nrelapse so some people will feel very\nashamed and that's okay\nbut i'd say that sitting in that feeling\ncan\ncause you to relapse more often\nso really there's a there's a rocky\nquote where he says like\nit's not about um how hard you get hit\nit's about\nif you can get hit and keep moving\nforward so really and truly it's all\nabout\nevery time you relapse there's this\nthing called like a relapse autopsy\nand there are stages of a relapse i\nthink bob can expand on that more\num like the desire the trigger or\nsomething like that\nand um you can look at it like what what\ncaused me to relapse well what normally\ncauses me to relapse is i use a system\ncalled blast which is\nbored like bored lonely angry\nsad or tired and sometimes tired is\nthirsty and there's also another one\nwhich includes\nhungry um and i'm always i'm normally\ntired angry or lonely like oh the girl i\nlike didn't text me back well she works\nlike 72 hours a week dude like\nof course she doesn't have all this time\nshe can't like you know give all this\ntime to you\nbut even then like my the irrational\npart of my brain is like\noh you gotta it's just like well\nwhatever like\nshe's she's whatever just go you need to\nfind some other form of\ndigital companionship and that's what\ncauses me to relapse\nyeah a relapse is a long chain i would\nsay it's not just\nlike you type it's it's not just typing\nin the url\nit's for me it starts even before that\nsometimes\nwhen i come home from work and i\nsometimes start to eat foods i shouldn't\nbe eating\nthat is when i feel like\ni crumble a bit and then i just\ncan't keep the discipline up and then\nmost of the time it starts like this\nokay so let me ask you guys a question\num\nare you going to relapse\nyeah no i say no i believe in you men\nso if you know you're going to relapse\nhow do how does that correlate with\nshame or control\nright because up here we have annie\nsaying i'm the only one that can do\nsomething if he's like i'm definitely\ngoing to relapse\nhow do we sit with those two thoughts\num i would say that uh relapse is\npart of recovery relapse is a part of\nmost people's recovery\nand um like as i was saying earlier do\nthe relapse autopsy figure out\nwhy like um and the thing is\nmy friend in the addiction community he\nsaid put up a defense\nyou need defenses and uh as flo was\nsaying earlier\na good defense is a community because i\nwould say um\nthere was one video i watched which said\nthe opposite of\naddiction is connection so find a group\nfind\num if you like 12-step programs find a\nsponsor there's stuff like sla\nthat can that can help uh or just find\nan accountability partner\num find like things that help you set\nyour streaks like i use\ndone um that's an app on on the app\nstore\nand it helps me a lot to like keep\npressing that button each day it's kind\nof like the replacement like\nevery time i press that button and it\nsays oh you've made it two days you made\nit three days you made it four days\nit's really all about defense and\ntrying to find ways to root out the\ncauses that make you relapse well i'm\ngonna add to that\nand say that in my experience in that\nchannel\nuh it never seems like shame helps very\nmuch\nbut i i try to reorient it towards\nyou should learn about the process\nwhat you're feeling why it happens\nduring the time\nit's it's it's not\nentirely your fault because it's part of\nyour being and\npart of the culture that you're inside\nyou do have some control over it but\nyou can forgive yourself but i was like\nthat too\nlike i was there was a period in which\ni went from a great deal of shame to\nfeeling neutral about it like it was\ngoing to happen and i just needed to\nwatch it to\nnot really feeling that much shame\nanymore and\nthis is a point where i have the most\ncontrol over it\ni think it's important to know to\nunderstand that relapsing is part of the\nprocess\nand for me i found myself that the more\nand more\nrelapse the more more i understand why i\nshouldn't be\nlike i'm facing my emotions more and\nmore and\ni i know i i and and i feel like every\ntime there's less shame\nlast time that i relapsed there was less\nshame than the time before\nbecause i i i understood i took more\ntime to understand why\ni'm relapsing and uh last time it was\nbecause of emotions the emotion became\ntoo much\nand i understood that okay well\ni'm doing what i can i'm starting to\nface my emotions more so okay i\nunderstand that\nif i start facing my emotions more next\ntime i won't relapse as much and i won't\nbe\nas shameful because i know i did i tried\nright\num yeah yeah it's not the end of the\nworld\nso i'm gonna try to just shift a couple\ntopics because we're\nactually almost out of time so we've got\nmaybe about 15 minutes left\num so let me ask you guys what is what\nis your understanding of like what's\nbrahmacharya\num sad guru is on the path to the divine\nit's like the first stage of life i\nthink\nfrom like it ends at the ages of 20 to\n25. i just read the wikipedia article\nbut my understanding is is\none on the path to the divine is that is\nwhat a brahmacharya is and for me it\nmeans\num avoi it's like abstinence from from\nthings that are pleasurable and the\npursuit of joy\nyou described it as big chillin in the\nlast time\nlast stream i think yeah\nwhat does that mean you said it\nokay um at the end of like i think the\nsecond porn stream\nokay yeah so so\nokay i'll i'll explain what i mean by\nthat is somebody else want to offer a\ndefinition or their understanding\num i think about it as sort of like a\nuniversal\ndiscipline um of\nall sensory desires and apparatus trying\nto pull\naway from being pulled outside of\nyourself\nand trying to cultivate\ninner strength and um\ni guess uh\nnature okay i have a more\nsecular view of it but for me it's just\nlike\nlike the age around 2025 is just\nthe time where you give up your\nchildhood pleasures and need to start to\nface\nreality and live in reality and start to\nbecome\na member of the society\ni would say and giving up the pleasures\nto fulfill some duty in the society is\nlike my current understanding of it\num for me it's uh\nkind of like not being a slave to\npleasure\nor pleasurable desires and kind of more\nlike seeking gratification and\nfulfillment\nfrom like long-term goals so like um\nporn is like i'll just do it for a few\nminutes and i'll get like an instant\npleasure whereas\nit's like reading a book it might not be\npleasurable at the moment but\nyou get more more of a fulfillment over\ntime or gratification over time\nokay those are all good definitions so i\ni have some\nthoughts to share but before we get to\nthose or if you guys want me to go first\ni'm happy to\ni guess the last general question that i\nthink we should explore is like where do\nyou go from here\nnow if if you guys have thoughts about\nthat i'd love to hear them otherwise\ni can try to sum up some stuff but\ni want to give you guys kind of a\nplatform like what's next yeah\nhello um can i can i ask you a question\nabout that because\nlike i know that all of us have\nlike some kind of trauma and\num i'm not even sure if\nwe are able to deal with our emotions\nwithout like getting therapy and\nlike figuring out what our hole in the\nheart is\nand dealing with that because sometimes\nit feels like a fight that i can't win\nright now\nand that's really frustrating and i\num yeah i just want to know if if we can\neven\ndo it because um i would rather know\nthat\nit's something that i can face after\nhaving like 20 years of therapy then\nlike um fighting every day and\nnot being yeah not knowing if we can\nhandle it\nyeah so what i'm hearing from flow is is\nthere hope\nfor victory\nyeah anybody else have uh\ni would say this is something which is a\nhuge cliche\nin the uh 12-step programs that i've\nbeen in\nbut just one last thing basically is\ndon't give up until the miracle happens\nand\nwhat is the miracle who knows what it is\nyour life has changed completely\nafter the first week you might find that\nthings\nreally and truly have changed and a lot\nof the things you might perceive\nas negative at first will become\nwell slowly and surely it's it's not\nabout superpowers it's about\nreturning to baseline it's about\nremoving the symptoms of your\naddiction because uh the thing is you\ndon't know\nwhat water is until you're out of it so\nyou don't know what brain fog is\nuntil you don't until you feel what\nbrain fog\nlike what it feels like not to have it\nso does anybody else have questions\nabout like where to go\nor thoughts about where we go from here\notherwise i'll collect my thoughts and\nthen try to answer a closed question\nbob you can go first thank you um\ni was going to say that that is a\nprocess you know this is all\nnot these aren't discreet things i don't\nthink of it as\nlike there's a specific end point um\nevery day has potential for analyzing\nyour emotions\nfor trying to grow and be in the present\nmoment\nit just takes work and you should be\nhonest with yourself that it may take a\nlot of work but you can get there\nyou can feel better\nyeah for me the whole story thing is a\nbig\nis helping me in a big way because\ni know the things that have happened in\nthe past and i can't change them\nbut i want to make sure that\ni can overcome it because it's\nreally is beneficial to my dharma\nand i want to be an example of\nthat it is possible to overcome the\nproblems you had in the past\nand many great people had big issues\nin their childhood and they didn't have\na perfect childhood and it's\nand i think in a way overcoming\nhardships gives you meaning it gives you\nthe feeling of power\nand moving forward and i would say\nthat focusing on the future and building\na future\nis something that i want to do and i\nwould even go so far\nas to say that it's something anyone\nshould do\nwith regards to that because\nit takes time to accept the past and\nsometimes\nyou have to battle with traumas for the\nrest of your life\nbut i think giving it some kind of\nplace where it has some meaning and\nwhere it feels\nlike very personal and where you can\nmaybe even even help people\nwith that that it is something that is\nlike\nvery holistic and\ngood in a sense\nany go ahead yep i think so you asked\nwhat's next and i think for a lot of\npeople it should just be therapy\ni feel like there's a lot of people in\nchat right now that need it and are not\ntaking action to\nto take any therapy and that's me that's\nme i'm not doing it and i've been\navoiding it\nand i think it's also finding a dharma\nin my opinion\nit's really it really helps the journey\nit makes it much easier if you have a\npurpose\nand you have a reason to keep going um\nand i just want to make that clear to\nchat uh you get uh\nif you guys need help you know i think\nit's important to\nokay so i'm gonna just think for a\nlittle bit okay\ntry to collect my thoughts because i\nwant to highlight a lot of stuff\nso overall this has been incredibly\nhelpful this is my\nthis is my notes from the page session\nso there's\nthere's a lot to say\nso give me just a minute\nokay so the first thing that i want to\npoint out to people that are watching is\ni i want you guys to pay attention and\nmaybe go back and watch the vod\ni want you guys to pay attention to the\nlanguage that\npeople here use right so like the first\nthing is that if we think about porn\naddiction\nwhat i'm hearing from you guys is like\nalmost like y'all are zombies\nit's like like there's no like\nawareness right it's like you guys use\nthese phrases like\nautopilot my life is revolving around\nthis like you guys\nreally sound like zombies like from\nmovies where they just want\none thing and and it's interesting\nbecause there's a certain like\nneutrality like is a zombie unhappy like\nit's a little bit unclear\nare they unsatisfied are they hungry\nabsolutely\nthey're always hungry but it's not like\nthey're sad they're just hungry\nand what we hear from you all about sort\nof like you know pieces that are like\nmissing within us like that's what you\ntry to fill\nwith like porn or other addictions\nbecause there's that hunger\nand even in buddhism there's this idea\nof like between\nearth and hell there's like this middle\nlayer which is the realm of hungry\nghosts which isn't quite hell\nbut it's just for souls who are always\nhungry and they never get filled up so\nthey seek pleasure they seek pleasure\nthey seek pleasure\nand they never become satisfied\nand so if you listen to like what these\npeople are saying if you guys like\nreally listen to\nyou guys i'm talking to twitch chat now\na lot of the questions\nthat we get asked like how do i\ndot dot dot how do i find internal\nmotivation\nhow do i be less depressed how do i get\nin touch with my emotions\nlike these are the questions that people\nfrom our community ask and the\ninteresting thing is you guys should\nlisten to what they're saying because\nthey've actually y'all have done all\nthat\nright you guys have found actually\nbizarre you all have found the answers\nbecause what we hear from you guys is\nyou know um like annie's talking about\nyou know taking cold showers every day\npeople are talking about like\nyou know finding relationships talking\nto girls sitting with your emotions\nlearning how to deal with your emotions\nfinding purpose in life like grappling\nwith finding purpose in life getting\nconnected to other human beings like\nthis is what our community is missing\nthey don't know how to feel their\nemotions they don't know what they're\nfeeling and you guys are like\ni feel shame i feel like i [ __ ] up\ni can understand flo earlier was saying\nsometimes you think it's an emotion but\nit's actually just a thought\nright like that's that's what the people\nin our community need to understand that\nunderstanding\nthe other thing is that you guys talk a\nlot about understanding\nright so so like you guys aren't solving\nany problems which is one of the really\nconfusing things for our community is\nlike they're like what do i do and my\nanswer is you don't do anything\nwhat you do is you notice and notice\ncreates change\nand it's kind of like what what's easy\nwas saying that there's a relapse\nautopsy like what's the value of that\nwhat do you do\nthe value is not about like figuring out\nwhat the value is not about\ndoing the thing it's about figuring\nout what to do that's where the change\nhappens\nwhen your mind studies yourself and you\nunderstand yourself\nthat's what gives you the power to do\nbecause the problem with our community\nisn't that they don't know what to do\neverybody knows what to do they just\ncan't do it\nright and he's saying like we all need\nto see a therapist i'm included\nlike he knows he needs to see a\ntherapist why isn't he doing it\nit's not a lack of what to do it's a\nlack of like\nunderstanding how you work so that you\ncan't do the things that you should do\nand so how do you guys how have you all\nsucceeded because i actually think of\ny'all\nlargely as success stories which may\nsound weird because i hear you guys i\nhear it in your language and it's\ninteresting because what you say is like\nwhy do you relapse it's a loss of focus\nwhich is bizarre right that's not what\nwe would expect it's not just a trigger\nbut it's a loss of focus and if we think\nabout you know how do you move forward\nin life how do you find internal\nmotivation\nhow do you do things every day like this\nis what our community needs\nit's a loss of focus it's not a\nit's actually not a lack of motivation\nthis is something that's subtle but like\nneeds to be understood\nyou know on january 1st when you make a\nnew year's resolution that you're going\nto lose 10 pounds and you're going to\neat healthy and you go to the grocery\nstore\nand you buy like all this healthy food\nthat's not\nthat's not a lack of motivation you have\nplenty of motivation\nthe problem is that your mind wavers you\nlose\nfocus on your motivation the\nmotivation's there it's just your mind\nstarts thinking about other things\nand as you start to think about other\nthings then\nbad behaviors start to arise again so\nthe key here is about the focus of the\nmind because when y'all's mind is in the\nright place\nthen you can control the behavior and\nwhen your mind wanders then the behavior\ncontrols you\nwhich gets to this other idea of like\nwho are you and what is the behavior\nbecause you guys are talking about this\nthing\nright like you use the phrase like\npeople were talking about this thing you\nguys are like almost like you become\nporn elementals and this is my favorite\nlike thing that i've stumbled upon in\nstream recently\nthat you become one with the thing and\nand and even if we if we like listen to\nlike flow flow saying that like\ni've lost the battle before i even type\nin the url\nright so you become like one with this\nthing and then you lose control and then\nthe scary thing is that there's actually\ni don't know if you guys like this make\nsense\nbut flo is actually trapped and he's\nwatching it happen\nthere's a part of his mind that is doing\nsomething but flow's true his self is\nwatching it and he's screaming he's like\ndon't do it\ndon't do it but his mind is like [ __ ]\nyou flo\nwe're doing it right you know it's\nhappening and you know that you don't\nwant it to\nand and the real flow is there and he's\nwatching\nand he can't stop it and that that boat\nof sale\nso now this like gets to an important\nthing about like okay how do you control\nthis thing so the first thing to\nunderstand is that there's like\nthere's a brain but that's not\nnecessarily you\nright so there are issues of like\ndopamine and stuff like that which we'll\nlet's just talk about that for just a\nsecond\nso like y'all said so human beings have\nevolved\nto procreate that's why orgasm is so\npleasurable\nright like it's it's pleasurable because\nlike if we didn't have a drive\nto orgasm we like wouldn't procreate\nso it's evolutionary that like\nprocreation and orgasm is like the most\nlike the highest goal of like a being\nand so it's really really dangerous when\nyou guys have a shortcut to that feeling\nbecause that's the end goal and if you\nguys\ncan watch porn on your on your computer\nscreen or a mobile phone or\nyou know whatever and like why do you\nneed to do anything so if you guys are\nthinking about like it's interesting\nbecause a community\na question that we get from our\ncommunity is like how do we get\nmotivated\nand now we can kind of see because it's\nalmost i i think it was andy who was\nkind of saying that like\nwhen you like you don't feel like doing\nanything after you masturbate\nand when you do it a ton you get this\nbrain fog\nand what does that even mean it's like\nit's sort of like this\ncomplete lack of motivation like i\nalmost kind of think of you guys as sort\nof like\npothead zombies right that's what brain\nfog is\nit's like you're just jerking off all\nthe time and like you're not really\ndoing anything and you're sort of like\nyou're not really even alive you're like\nsome sort of weird half-life\nkind of creature and\nand so you know it's tricky because\nthere certainly is dopamine and then\nlike it you know as you as you orgasm so\nthis is like just now talking a little\nbit about spirituality\nso the interesting thing is that a\nblissful state is actually a no mind\nstate and one of the\nquickest ways to get to a blissful state\nwith awareness is orgasm\nso that's why tantric sex is actually\nsuch a powerful technique\nit's because it's a meditative practice\nthat brings you to like\na point of no mind so you're aware but\nyou have like no\nthoughts you have no emotions you have\nno feelings you just\nexist purely in that moment which is\nwhat orgasm is which is why it's so\naddicting\nand so meditation is actually the\nprocess\nof cultivating the mental state of\norgasm at all times\nand when you have that state that's what\nmoksha is moksha is liberation or\nenlightenment\nit's essentially a state of perpetual\norgasm\nand and not to say that it's actually\nperpetual orgasm but it's the state of\nconsciousness\nthat orgasm creates for a few moments\nthat's what mork does and that's why\npeople use so satguru uses this word joy\nso the word is anand it's bliss\nand and now we get to something kind of\ninteresting which is like when you\nmeditate you start to do this stuff\nas you start to feel feelings like how\nis that good like isn't that bad\nisn't that what you want to escape from\nand someone said something about like\nthere are ups and downs but those feel\nit feels good to feel them and now we\nget to a really really important point\nabout spirituality which is that the\nenlightened person\nis not free of pain they have a certain\ntranquility\nwith respect to the ups and downs that\nallows them to somehow appreciate the\nbad things in life\nand that [ __ ] is op so that's your\nultimate salvation\nimagine for a moment that a good thing\nin your life and a bad thing in your\nlife\nis something that you can deal with in\nthe same way\nthat you don't have to retreat from\nbadness\nthat is the most op buff you can ever\nget\nbecause suddenly things that are boring\nor shaming are not things that\nrestrict your behavior they don't\ncontrol you anymore\nand ultimately what i see you guys doing\nis is a journey of control\nthat's what this is it's understanding\nand control it's a journey of\nhow to control the self so now we get to\nbrahmacarya\nso brahmacarya means to dwell in god\nbrahman really which is cosmic\nconsciousness or universal consciousness\nand it means to have your mind focus on\nthings\non the divine as opposed to get lost in\ndesires\nso brahmacari is sometimes translated as\ncelibacy\nbecause it but really what it is is\nnon-lawfulness you can still actually\nhave sex\nand be a brahmacari it's just you're not\nallowed to be horny\nso it it's it's control over it's it's\nabout\nnot losing your mind in the desire\nright so like even even when we think\nabout like i'm kind of envisioning like\nthis the scenario where flo is like\nhe's opening up his browser and he's\nlike typing something into his url bar\nand in that moment his mind is lost in\nthat\ndesire even though flow's aware of it\nbut like that the mind is kind of like\non autopilot at that point there's\nlike autopilot autopilot autopilot\nthat's what we've heard from you guys\nover and over and over again so the\nvalue of brahmacharya is that\nyou know as you guys grapple with this\nand i want everyone who's watching to\nreally like understand this\nthese guys have grown immensely like\nthey understand this [ __ ] in a way that\nvery few people in our community do\nand bizarrely like that's because\nthey've been grappling with themselves\nfor a long time\nthis is what happens this is what\nspiritual growth actually looks like\nit's grappling with yourself right and\nit's like sort of saying like okay like\nthis is what my mind is doing\nand then we see all these kinds of\neffects like an appreciation for\nnegative emotions\nwhich is bizarre the ability to sit with\nit the ability to like feel better\nafterward the ability to like process\nand be somewhat past it\num\nyeah like there's just so much stuff\nabout like being on autopilot like\nthe same [ __ ] every day like that's the\nproblem of our community\nand what i'm hearing from you guys is\nwhen you all know fat for a while\nyou don't it doesn't feel like life is\nthe same [ __ ] every day\nand that's what living a life with\nawareness is\nand so bizarrely i think that nofap is a\nwonderful spiritual tool because\nyou guys are constantly looking at\nyourself because that's the only way\nthat you can\nsucceed with no fat you have to be\nwatching your desires\nlike you have to be aware of your\nboredom\nyour not laziness what was it boredom\nanyway whatever the blast actually is\nangry angry yeah\nyeah blast right right so like you guys\nare watching yourself and all you have\nto do is watch yourself\nand then you'll start to gain control\nand then as you gain control like\nsuddenly you get these buffs which is\nlike\nsadness does not impact your action\nthat is one of the most op buffs shame\ndoes not\nimpact your action you're able to sit\nwith it and that too even when we use\nthe phrase\nsit with it you're no longer an\nelemental at that point\nbecause you can't when you're when you\nare it that's when you're an elemental\nthe literally the process of sitting\nwith it is for flow to be there\nand then the emotion or the desire or\nthe urge to be here and you're just\nchilling with it and it's there with you\nbut that means that you are not\nit it creates separation and over time\nyou'll control it\nthat's what happens\nso when when zizi said that addiction is\na spiritual malady like i completely\nagree\nit's also a biological melody it's also\nan energetic\nmalady but it's absolutely a spiritual\nmalady this is what i think is basically\nlost in western understanding of the\nmind\nis that we think of it as exclusively\npsychiatry\nwhich are is there dopamine stuff is\nthere addiction stuff is there escapism\ndoes therapy help\nis there trauma like absolutely all of\nthose things\nand that doesn't explain all of it\nbecause there's also this level of like\nhungry ghosts where there's something\nwithin you\nthat just wants to like eat and eat and\neat and it never gets filled\nright the more you masturbate like it\ndoesn't work\num yeah so like\nwhere do you like is there hope for you\nguys absolutely\nyou guys are way further along the path\nthan you realize\ni mean flow's here asking the question\nis there a hope for me and like the dude\nhas gone\n364 days\nwithout relapsing and relapse i agree is\npart of the process like\nyou know so is there a hope for you\nabsolutely i think you guys are further\nalong than you realize\nand at the end of the day because like\nyou said it's not\nyou know it's it the this this thought\npattern that arises in your mind is porn\naddiction\nis separate from actual like sexuality\nand connection with another human being\nand over time if you stop feeding it\nit'll die\nout the problem is that like it's grown\ninto a pretty big tree because you guys\nhave been\nfertilizing it and watering it and\nfeeding it since the age of 10 to 12.\nright so it's going to take a couple\nyears for it to completely die out but\nyou don't have to wait a couple years to\nstart making significant progress\nwhat i'm hearing from you guys is that\nyou all are looking for your dharma\nyou're finding motivation\nyou're learning how to relate to women\nlike even when zizi says\ni see my insecurities like that's what\nthis community is about\nand like he sees his insecurity and once\nhe sees it then he can start to like\ndeal with it right he's like oh she\nworks 72 hours a week it has nothing to\ndo with me and that's how you start to\nbe like comfortable in a relationship\nwhen they don't like text you back\nit's because you acknowledge that your\ninsecurity doesn't prey\non a normal occurrence in the outside\nworld because this is what our mind does\nit find something completely normal and\nit preys on it\noh they didn't invite me to the party\ni'm the only person who didn't get\ninvited\noh [ __ ] i changed my cell phone number\nno one had a way of getting\na hold of me but we don't care our mind\ndoesn't care\nbecause the insecurity is what we\nbelieve when we become the insecure\nelemental everything around us\nfeeds our insecurity and we just can't\nsee it\nso overall i think you guys are doing\nfantastic\num you know i think\ni think just keep at it and the last\nthing is i mean as you guys have already\nsaid it sounds like the community has\nbeen helpful\nand so like keep engaging the community\nand like\nyou know it sounds like you guys hang\nout on our discord which is cool i\ndidn't know that [ __ ] like this happened\ni mean i've always wondered whether\nwe're actually helping people or not\nand and after hearing you guys i\nactually feel pretty good about the work\nthat we're doing because you all have\ngrown immensely it's crazy\ni never thought i would be able to talk\nabout this kind of stuff on\nlike in like these are higher level\ndiscussions about like\nbrahmacharya like what it means and sort\nof building awareness\nand how like that's gonna happen like\neveryone's wondering\nhow do you process your emotions you\nguys are processing your emotions y'all\nare doing it\neveryone's like how like i don't know\nexactly how but y'all are doing it\nwhen when flo is sitting there in a bad\ncrying next to his girlfriend\nand he's being the ultimate beta cuck\nlike that's\nthat's that's processing your emotions\nyeah and then like over time those\nemotions will burden you less\nand they like won't weigh on you and\nonce they stop weighing on you\nthen you guys will be able to like move\nforward without that [ __ ] on your back\nand people were talking about you know\ngreat people suffered from\nlike some of them suffered from great\nthings i think that's the reason they're\ngreat\nthat's where greatness comes from it\ncomes from overcoming\nchallenges and triumphing and\nunderstanding yourself\nand the last point that i'll say is like\ndharma so everyone's asking like how do\ni find my dharma you guys\ni've really done a bad job of explaining\nthis you don't find you're talking about\nyour dharma finds you\nright so like healthy gamer like i\ndidn't i didn't like wake up\nat the age of 20 and say like i'm gonna\ntry to help gamers\nunderstand nofap that's absurd\nit's dumb even six months ago\nit was like we're gonna help gamers with\nno that was it's absurd\nso the boat best thing that you can do\nis exactly what you all are doing\nwhich is that you're you're not ready\nfor your\nyour karma will give you your dharma\nwhen you're ready\nand if you guys continue living like a\nzombie on autopilot your\ntarget will never present itself\nit's kind of like saying like where's\nthe final boss like the final boss is in\nthe final boss room\nbut if you just hang around in like the\nstarting zone\nafk then you're never going to find the\nfinal boss\nso your first dharma is to yourself this\nis what the brahmacharya the stage of\nlife\nthat zizi was talking about the first\nstage of life is brahmacharya\nwhich is weird because it's kind of got\na double definition but what this means\nis like it's kind of the student phase\nthat you should prepare yourself\nand once you guys are ready for a\nrelationship a relationship will happen\nonce you guys are ready to save the\nworld the world will need saving\nbut y'all aren't ready yet so continue\ndoing the work that you're doing\ncontinue working on yourself\ncontinue leveling up and then eventually\nthe final boss will show up\nand when it shows up you all will either\nbe ready or you won't be ready\nright now life is giving you guys a\nlittle bit of a pass because it's not\nlike you don't have aggro yet\nwhich is good because you're not ready\nand as someone i can tell you guys you\ndon't find dharma it just dumps itself\nin your lap like\nwhen you guys are ready thousands of\npeople on the internet will start asking\nyou for help\nand right now there are people asking\nyou for help\nit's crazy right\nbecause like y'all have had struggles\nand y'all have been there for each other\nso that's your dharma\nhow did you find that\nthrough your streams actually i would\nsay\nthrough all the through all the pain and\nnegativity and suffering\nit led to that understanding yeah\nso our streams are karma right flo so so\nyou were ready to help someone\nand when you were ready the stream\nshowed up and and sent you to our\ncommunity\nbut ultimately it's you who decided to\njoin the discord it's you who decided to\nhang out in the brahmacharya\nsection and it's you who decided to both\nshare and support other people\nso that's exactly what i'm saying like\ndr k arose because\nyou were ready for that next phase of\nyour growth\nand so when you guys are ready someone\nwill show up and this is the whole point\nthat we've been talking about is like\nit's not it doesn't have to be me\nyou guys are doing the work and just\nkeep doing it and there's like\ndude so much hope\nso much hope you guys have no idea like\nhow far\nlike y'all are killing it that's that's\nthe greatest thing i've heard\never yeah seriously i i i don't think\nyou're saying that\ni don't think you guys understand how\nyou actually sound like you should go\nback and watch the vod\nbecause you guys have behind you what\nhalf of our community thinks is the end\ngoal\nand so like yeah like i know fap for 364\ndays and i felt motivated and\nstarted to get in touch with my emotions\nand like you know had my girlfriend and\nlike\ncried in front of her and maybe she\ndumped you we don't know but sounds like\nshe didn't\nshe's still there right so like what the\n[ __ ]\nyou know and and it's like people are\nlike you guys have a history of trauma\nand then we have like\nyou know odd size like roller coaster of\nlike atheism spirituality religion and\nself-growth like\nthat's what people want right it's like\ni want to wake up and be able to take a\ncold shower every day like and\nand go running like that's you guys are\nliving representations of the goals of\nmost of our community\nand you ask me is there hope the [ __ ]\n[Music]\nthat's what the shame really does to you\nlike it really leaves you helpless\nyep so good so so\nflo that's why there's hope for you\nbecause now you're able to see\nthat your lack of hope is not a truth\nit's your mind and it's the shame and\nit's not\nactually that you don't have hope like\nthat's it right there that's the\nunderstanding i don't know if you guys\nsaw that\nthat's the shift he just did it\nthat's what the shame does to me right\nhis earlier question was do i have hope\nand now he says that's what the shame\ndid to me he's now separate from the\nshame\nhe's separate from the hopelessness and\nit's in that space\nthat growth happens and that's the space\nin which you get control over your life\nfantastic all right we meditating\nyes please yeah let's do it okay so um\nall right so we're gonna this may be\nsomething that you guys are actually\ngood at we're gonna do something that's\na little bit more open today\nwhich is just how to sit with yourself\nokay so like this is what i want you\nguys to do i want you to sit up straight\nnot gonna even do any like breathing or\nanything like that actually yeah let's\ndo this one\num okay so\nwhat i want everybody to do we're gonna\nplay a fun game so everyone asks a\nquestion\nyou know how do i change on the inside\nand then what i always say is like all\nyou have to do is be aware\nand notice and that's sufficient for\nchange and then everyone scratches their\nhead and is super confused\nso we're going to teach you that right\nnow so i want you guys to close your\neyes\ni want you to put your palms face up on\nyour knees\nand focus on the sensation of your palms\nand now notice that you have a certain\npattern of breath\nand i want you to focus on your\nbreathing\nbut don't change it\ndon't control it just observe it\nso what's happening to your breath as\nyou begin to observe it\nnow i guess that if you guys are trying\nthis practice that your breath\nchanges as you observe it\nstop changing it let it go back to\nnormal\nand try as you might the breath will\nlikely change if you observe it\nso now what we're going to do is\nfocus on any sensation your body will be\nsending you signals\nlearn to sit with them\nthe signal may be a thought\nit may be an itch\nit may be a tension\nthere may be a demand a desire to change\nposition\nwatch that impulse\nnow let yourself come back\nso is anybody able to\nobserve the breath without changing it\nso i'm seeing some people shake their\nhead no some people are saying yes\nit's very it's like a razor's edge\nyou can feel you can feel get to a point\nwhen it's when you're doing okay and\nthen it'll snap back again\nand try to control it and you can feel\nthat\nmovement of the mind or the will\nor whatever it is it's very subtle\ni i feel like i started noticing my\nbreath and i started controlling it\nbut the more and more i kept noticing my\nbreath i kind of like\nstopped focusing on it and i kind of\nlike started calming down\nand then the moment like i started\nhaving a thought about my breath that's\nwhen it started changing again\nso by itself like when i just by trying\nnot to control it\ni stopped controlling like thinking\nabout controlling it\nit started like kind of taking me in and\nwhen i thought about it started\ncontrolling again\nwhat was the thing yeah flow going\ni think what bob said was basically like\nmeditation summarized that you like\nyou notice this um\nline that you can that you are able to\ncross and you do like reps\nlike you notice that you get lost that's\nbasically\nlike meditation and you do it again and\nagain and again and again\nyeah so my natural breath was pretty\nshallow\nand whenever i gave it awareness i\nstarted actually breathing deeper and\nlonger\nbreaths\nsame with me so i mean\ni i think that the main point here is\nthat like first of all\nwhat was uh where you\n[Music]\nhow did you guys feel when you were\nmeditating when your mind was focused on\nthe breath\ni'd say uh content is how i felt in that\nmoment there wasn't really like a worry\non my mind i was kind of just\nokay very peaceful yeah\nright so it's interesting because\nsometimes in order to get that focus\nyou have to have a task that's difficult\nand so to retain your focus very quickly\nto observe the breath but don't change\nit because that requires effort\nand then the other interesting thing\nis you know uh annie was kind of talking\nabout how like\nthe more he focused on it the more it\nchanged but the more that he let go\nfocusing on it\nthe more natural it became and then but\nat the same time like\nlike it sounds like letting go focusing\non it was\nshattered by the presence of a thought\nand then he tries to control it again\nand so now i'm gonna turn\nthat's a very important principle that\nvery few people understand\nso now i'm gonna go back to flow do you\nhave hope absolutely\nall you need to do to keep on\nprogressing is stop worrying about\nprogressing\nthat's steep right it's exactly what\nannie said which is like when you're\ntrying you're like am i doing it am i\ndoing it am i doing it and then your\nshame is gonna say no\nbut how did you go 364 days\nby focusing in the present and not\ntrying to go 364 days\nif you say to yourself i'm going to be\nsober for a year you're [ __ ]\ni feel like with meditation though\nthere's like this\nway you can have not enough focus\nlike there's like that you can be too\nrelaxed\nand you can have too much focus and you\nneed to realize both of them\nin order to get at like the point that\nyou need to be to meditate\nso that point is best translated\ninto english is transcendence\nthere's an axis of focus on focus\nand when you move beyond that axis\nthat's what transcendence is\nso it's not that there are good days and\nbad days we prefer good days over bad\ndays\nbut sometimes we can we can actually\nappreciate both of them for what they\nare\nso we move beyond the axis into\ntranscendence and that's where\ntranquility comes from\nright because that's your money state\nthing yeah\num i've spoken to the other guys about\nit but\num i'll be attending a retreat\nmy first retreat and um i'm really\nlooking forward to it i think it's going\nto be a lot of pain of a personal\nretreat\num and as we've already been talking\nabout meditation is there anything like\nyou want to\ngive me for the retreat like any advice\nor something\nno okay\nif you're yeah i mean if you're doing a\nvibration treat you're doing a\npassionate retreat there's nothing that\ni say now that is going to influence\nyour experience of the retreat trust me\nwhat do you think of like uh double mean\ndetoxing so i was actually thinking i\nwas finding myself like\nbeing more uh like not relapsing by\ncontrolling my environment more\nand i was thinking maybe taking a week\nof uh\nremoving all my electronic devices maybe\nthat's a bit too much\ni'm thinking but uh maybe just like a\ncall and text phone and\njust that so i can just communicate with\npeople if i need to but\ni don't know what's your thoughts on\nthat i mean i think a dopamine detox\nis a really good idea but it's hard to\ndo and should be set up properly\nso i think the hardest thing about a\ndopamine detox is people just sort of\nlike start doing it\nbut like i think that your environment\nis very very important\nso just for people to understand so\nyou're dope like just like any other\nreceptor in your brain you have a\ncertain amount of like dopamine\ntolerance and so like if you think about\nif you haven't played games for a while\nand you sit down and you play a game\nit's like a ton of fun\nand the more you play the less fun it\nbecomes but then you don't even know why\nyou're playing it\nyou can't stop but it's not actually fun\nthat's when your dopamine tolerance sort\nof builds up\nright and it's just like caffeine\ntolerance or nicotine tolerance or\nalcohol tolerance\nwhere you can get a certain amount of\ndose and it doesn't create the\nparticular\neffect and then you can grow dependent\non a minimum dose\nso if you're addicted to caffeine if\nyou're dependent on caffeine\nyou know it's not that caffeine actually\nlike wakes you up it's just you become\ndependent on it to function normally\nso dopamine detoxing is the idea of like\nresetting your dopamine circuitry which\nactually takes like honestly\naround two weeks three weeks and so i\nthink the biggest thing is that you have\nto set up\nactivities that you can do like you\ncan't just\nlike replacement works way better than\nabstinence\nyeah so i was kind of thinking of for\nthe week to kind of focus more on\nreading books like i was going to buy a\nbo i bought a book\nand uh i was going to kind of read the\nbook in the week and run focus on just\nrunning\nand reading the book yeah so like how\nmany hours are you going to run\na day anywhere from about uh\ni'm like an endurance runner so i like\nto run like anywhere from six to\neight miles in a day and uh probably i\ndon't know anywhere from two to four\nhours with a bunch of breaks in\nyeah okay and what how many hours are\nyou planning on reading\num hopefully anywhere from two to four\nhours maybe i mean i don't read at all\nso i think\nreading like the first few days was\nprobably gonna be something like\ni'm just gonna sit on my bed all day and\nstare at the ceiling because i have\nnothing else yeah that sounds like\nthat's not gonna work well\nright so so like if you're gonna run for\ntwo hours and you're gonna read a book\nfor two hours\nthen i think it's optimistic to think\nabout what you're gonna do for the other\n12.\nso so like this is where like i think\ngood dopamine detoxes involve a bunch of\nstuff\nright so like sometimes people will do\nmeal prep to learn how to cook\ncooking and cleaning can take a long\ntime like i think about a couple of\nprojects\nlike are the things that you want to\nwork on\ni was going to work on some music as\nwell yeah okay so like like i\nyou know the last thing about a dopamine\ndetox is it it's good if you do it with\nsomeone\nso you can check in with like i\nrecommend checking in with someone like\nyou know find two or three people\ncheck in with people like for 15 minutes\na day and say like hey how's it going\nlike\nwhat's your plan for the day things like\nthat\nand then and then i mean i think\ndopamine detoxes are like sort of\nsemi-naturally done like when you go\nsometimes on like vacation and stuff\nlike if you go hiking\nor something like that like i you know i\nknow cobit is tricky and depending on\nwhere you are and stuff but i i really\nthink about like packing your day\nbecause your your enemy's gonna be bored\nright so meal prep cooking\nreading is great and then think about\nother things that are also like somewhat\nstimulating\nand the last thing about a dopamine\ndetox is understand that reading is\ngoing to be hard\nright it's not going to be fun at the\nbeginning\ni think about an audio book too that's\nsomething that you can kind of do that's\na little\nbesides reading\nsound good yeah yeah i i kind of thought\nthat it's a bit too extreme to just\nyou know read a book and just run i i i\nthink i would succeed\nanyway that's why i wanted to get it i\nmean i think it's fine to try\nright like so so you don't have to\nsucceed to learn\nand grow and then like you can i mean at\nthe least maybe\nin three days you'll relapse but at\nleast for three days like you'll be\nbetter at reading books\ni'm just trying to change like um\nthe hap like i feel like i have such a\ndopamine fix that i need every day on\nyoutube\non twitch or whatever so i'm kind of\ntrying to transition slowly to like\nbecause i don't like if you're going to\nplay video games all day and then you're\ntrying to read a book\nin my case the book is unreadable i can\nread a paragraph\nbecause it doesn't give you as much\ndopamine so i'm trying to kind of train\nmyself to\ngo enjoy the simpler things right so\nguys\nmore gratification absolutely dude so\nwe're we're a little bit past time guys\nso we gotta\ncall it but thank you all so much for\ncoming and sharing your stories and\ncontinuing so much strong work that you\nwant to thank you\nyeah thanks again thank you that was\nawesome take care\nand good luck to you all thank you thank\nyou bye chat\nokay\num so we're gonna thank you guys
