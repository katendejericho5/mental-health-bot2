    "transcript": "I know okay backseat haircutting\nquestions time alright dr. kay how do we\ndecompress after a heavy work day after\ntalking to main depressed people in a\nrow yeah that's a question like how do\nyou decompress after a heavy work day um\nthat's a good question so you know I do\na couple of standard things so I try to\nlike stay fed throughout the day which\nis actually really really important so\nmy wife does a good job\nbooty does an awesome job like so she\ngave me a smoothie this morning I will\noftentimes wine per smoothie\nsoon after I wake up until I get one so\nI think that you know decompressing\nafter a long day is just as much about\nmanaging yourself throughout the day is\nit is about like fixing things afterward\nso I think like eating at regular\nintervals and like not being super\nhungry because if you're not like if\nyou're super hungry at the end of the\nday and you eat a lot then you're gonna\nlike get into a food coma so I try to\nspend some time with my kids usually\nafter I'm done working we've tried to\nspend like an hour - together as a\nfamily everyday which is like pretty\nimportant I spent some time outdoors\nthat's huge so thankfully now I'm in\nTexas and it's like kind of it's\ngenerally speaking hot in Texas but it's\nbeen nice this year actually so I'll\nspend some time outdoors literally\nyesterday I just laid down in the grass\nso like because you're my birth dates\nare 15 minutes and just looked at the\nsky like that's good stuff and then I\nalso do play games so like after a long\nday if I can't like play games to watch\na little bit of TV you know I think a\nlot of people think that you should do\nlike self care like after a long day\nlike I should do yoga or meditate but I\nactually find like I think self-care\nrequires mana right like it's it's\neffortful to meditate exercise or do\nyoga and so I don't I try to make that\npart of my workday kind of basically\nlike treat it like a dog\nyeah and sometimes I'll just be like\nsilent by myself so after streams\nusually I go from like like a short\ndrive somewhere for no particular cue if\nI have an errand to run or something\nlike that but I think it's important to\nlet your mind just decompress and\nprocess one of the biggest problems I\nthink we run into is that we move from\ndistraction - distraction in the mind so\nlike it's always like TV or gaming or\naudio book or podcast or music or like\nand we're never just sitting with\nourselves like it's like browsing things\nreading things listening to things our\nmind is always occupied and I think one\nof the best things that you can do is\nactually just give your mind some time\nto just process which peels boring at\nfirst like you think you're gonna be\nbored but you'd be amazed like how good\nit can be yeah when you're talking about\nlike stuff to decompress was that stuff\nyou figure out on your own just through\nexperimentation or how did that like\ncome about yeah so I think basically\nthrough experimentation so like the\nthing is you have to understand how you\nwork and no one's gonna be able to tell\nyou how you work as a person so what you\nwant to do is like spend some time\npaying attention to yourself\nspend some time like kind of being with\nyourself so one of our our coaching\nclients came up with an awesome exercise\nwhich was like halfway through his his\ncoaching run he decided to spend an hour\nsitting on a honest like a couch or\nsomething like staring at fall and he\nwas like I just wanted to see what would\nhappen if I just like don't have any\ndistractions and just see what would\nhappen to my mind and I think that was\nlike that's a brilliant exercise it's\nreally hard to do but a lot of stuff can\ncome up and so you know I think a lot of\nit is through like reflection and like\nobserving yourself so what works for you\nand what doesn't work for you\nand I found that like basically I'm kind\nof an introvert so when I need to\nrecharge I try to do things by myself\nis there any like advice you give to\nsomeone who's trying to figure out like\nor understand themselves\nyeah so I think kind of what I said is\nlike first start by being with yourself\nso we spend so much of our time with\nother things in people right so like\nReddit twitch gaming books music like\nthere's a reason why shower thoughts are\nso profound and so wonderful it's\nbecause like when you're in the shower\nlike you don't you're with yourself and\nthat can actually be pretty cool so just\nI would say go on walks be in nature on\nyour own that's a really good way to get\nto know yourself sorry\nso was I like high neuroticism I\nconscientiousness and if so if not how\nwas I not like that is basically what\nI'm hearing yeah yeah so many of my\ncolleagues so what high neuroticism and\nI conscientious means is that there's a\nsystem of personality analysis which is\nlike scientifically like pretty\nvalidated which is called the big five\nor the five factor model and it\nbasically divides personality into five\ndimensions and different people sort of\nare on like different levels on each\ndimension and two of the levels or\nneuroticism so neuroticism is like the\ntendency to worry on the inside so just\nhow like concern you get about stuff and\nhigh conscientiousness which is the\nability to kind of focus on a task over\ntime and medical students tend to be\nhigh in neuroticism and high in\nconscientiousness so they can sit down\nand like focus hard for four years in\norder to get into medical school and\nfurthermore since they like or anxious\nabout how well they do on tests they're\nworried and their anxiety actually\npropels them to study more which makes\nit adaptive in terms of like gives them\nan advantage so most medical students\nare highly conscientious and very\nneurotic or anxious so I wasn't like\nthat\nreally at all\nI think the reason is because I failed\nso miserably four years before I got\ninto medical school so like I was a very\ndifferent person from many of my\ncolleagues so the first thing is I was\nlike years I was like 4 to 5 years older\nthan most of the class because it took\nme that long to get into med school\nthat's number one but I think during\nthose years like the big difference was\nthat like these are you know I think\nabout him as kids but you know these are\npeople or kids that like basically\nalways did well in life so they're like\nyou know they like had you know they\nwere in top ten in their high school\nclass like had three point eight plus\nGPAs in college and so they've always\nlike done really well so they don't\nreally like for them like a failure is\nlike a B or C and it's like they didn't\nreally understand like what real failure\nis whereas I had understood what real\nfear is it's like being 25 unemployed\nyou know being rejected from 80 medical\nschools with really no hope of getting\nin anywhere really not having any money\nnot having any much of anything at all\nand so the things that would terrify\nthem or freak them out would like not\nfeel like much to me so a good example\nis you know you get yelled at when\nyou're in the operating room by like\nsurgeons like that just think it's like\nbecause surgeons sometimes aren't the\nnicest people it's like a little bit of\na toxic culture in general and it's also\nsort of a high-stakes thing so sometimes\nmedical students will you know they'll\nget yelled at by a surgeon in the\noperating room and so when they get yell\nthat's like that's not something that\nhas happened to them before right\nbecause these are the kids that have\ngotten over words and and done well and\ngotten A's like they don't get yelled at\nfor being the stupidest person in the\nroom which isn't really fair because\nthat's you know they're the least\nknowledgeable but that's what happens\nand so then like they they've run out of\nthe operating room tears and all this\nkind of stuff the\nthey're more terrifying thing for\nmedical students as they ask people like\nhey how am i doing and they say like\nyeah you're doing a great job you're\ndoing a great job you're doing a great\njob and then they get like an average\ngrade they don't get like the best grade\nand then they're devastated because at\nthat point bridge is a great job um so\nyou know I think that for me like the\nreason that med school was actually kind\nof like chill and easy was because I had\nreally failed and so I understood like\nyou know getting yelled at by a surgeon\nlike that's because he's an [ __ ] it\nhas nothing to do with me it's like the\ndude is having a bad day like what do\nyou expect from me I'm a third-year\nmedical student who's been in the\noperating room for two weeks so like\nwhat can they reasonably expect and so I\nstudied and I recognized that I could\nlike learn as much as I could but I'm\nnot gonna know everything yet like\nthat's why I'm in med school whereas not\nknowing everything felt very very\ndevastating to many of my colleagues and\nso it's like okay I mean you can yell at\nme for not knowing things but that has\nnothing to do with me bro it's like I've\nbeen doing this for two weeks like so I\nthink really understanding failure and\nhaving failed is like one of the biggest\nsources of my strength and like what\nmakes life like sort of easy to manage\nright because it gives you perspective\nyeah so I think I gained confidence and\nwhen I think about confidence what I\nmean is I had a sense of my internal\nvalue and Worth and a lot of times\nmedical students will or they're just\npeople in general will have a sense of\nvalue that's based on like external\nthings so like how good I am if I'm if I\nget good grades then I'm a good person\nif I graduate from college then I'm a\ngood person\nthe converse is also true that a lot of\nour community will judge themselves\nbased on based on their lack of a\ncompetence so their value as a human\nbeing is determined by how much money\nthey make or whether they have jobs or\nwhether\nthey have you know romantic partners or\nwhatever whereas like when you really\nfail you begin to realize like that's\nnot where value comes from it's just\nvalue comes from like within and so I\nthink that was really different from me\nand my colleagues so I you're right\nZack I'd I don't have much I mean I'm\nnot very neurotic gotcha okay and that\nmakes sense like someone was asking how\ndo you find that enter a person yeah you\nspend time with yourself this is gonna\nbe a theme for today right so like I\nspent time like when you're like when\nyou fail you miss it so you know we\ndon't sew like this this is getting like\nso I think this is one of the reasons\nwhy like mental health is getting worse\nis because we spend more and more time\nwith our mind focus on external things\nbecause there's way better external\nstuff to focus on now\nlike you don't have to be with yourself\nat all during the day like I have a\nportable bluetooth speaker that'll\nsometimes take like carry into the\nbathroom when I take a shower so that I\ncan like listen to an audio book even\nwhen I'm in the shower\nyou know you can have headphones\nportable speakers you have a phone that\ngoes with you wherever you go that you\ncan like browse on like there's screens\nand podcasts around you 24/7 if you want\nso it's becoming like easier and easier\nto not spend time with yourself and it's\nbecoming more entertaining to like not\nbe bored by yourself and that's what we\ncall bored right like we call bored like\na mind that is unoccupied\nthat's what boredom is but I think that\nas we've become less and less bored it's\nactually hurting us because we don't get\nto know who we are because you're\nspending your time with like things out\nbesides yourself so practically how do\nyou do that I think sitting and staring\nat a wall is a good place to start you\nknow I think it's nice to like so I you\nknow I like tea\nlike I think it's nice to sit outdoors\nif you can and and like you know grab a\ncup of tea or even like a glass of like\nwater with lemon and then just chill out\nthere for like fifteen and thirty\nminutes like don't take your phone take\nlike a piece of paper and like something\nto write with and if you feel like\njotting things down jot things down\nI think hikes are fantastic or like\ngoing for a walk is fantastic because\nit's like hard to get distracted when\nyou're hiking and you just kind of get\nto spend time with yourself and sort of\nexist with yourself and then you'll get\nto know who you are and like the more\nyou get to know that person the more\nyou'll realize that like you know\nwhether you're a medical student failing\nto get into medical school a doctor or\nfaculty at Harvard Medical School it's\nlike the same person who takes a hike\nlike I'm still the same dude like\nnothing has changed like those are all\nexternal trappings but like the person\non the inside is the same and so then\nonce you realize that there's a constant\nwithin you that is irrespective of what\nyour bank account says then you begin to\nrealize that like no one can take that\naway from you and like then it's kind of\ncool because then you kind of know who\nyou are then it's like cool yeah so\nDominican love on Twitter ass\nat some point in the future I guess like\nnow can you talk about self-love self\nluck yeah I I don't is that something\nthat you learned because I don't\nactually know what he means here a\nlittle bit more I noticed a lot of\npeople reclaiming recoiling from\ncompliments and cop constantly putting\nthemselves down in an ultra negative way\nand it would be cool to get some helpful\nperspective to pass on to them\nso I guess like his yeah so this is this\nis something actually we talk about with\nour coaches it's they're kind of two\nperspectives and I I think like the\ncommon element is why what makes it ours\nlike when you when someone complements\nyou like the first thing to do is notice\nyourself so like when someone\ncomplements you like it's almost almost\nlike this serpent on coils in your mind\nand like swats away the compliment like\nyou feel deeply uncomfortable for like a\nfraction of a second and then you want\nto knock it away because something about\nthat like makes you feel something I the\nfirst thing you've got to do is like\nunderstand like why are you responding\nlike that like look at that and and see\nthat when someone is trying to express\nappreciation something exists in you\nthat doesn't can't sit with that so\nthat's the first thing you've got to\nfigure out is like see that thing\nbecause it's like it's like a reflex\nlike you're like no I can't I can't have\npeople saying that and so we ask our\ncoaches is then the question becomes\nwhere where was that thing born right so\nwhere does that come from why is it hard\nfor you to accept compliments and it may\nnot be any compliment for a lot of\npeople it's like particular things so if\nyou tell someone like on twitch that\nthey're a good-looking person they're\nmore likely to recoil than they are if\nyou tell them that you think they're\nsmart all right so there's some aspects\nof your personality that you're okay\nwith being like Obama average and there\nare other aspects that might deeply run\nagainst your perception of self then\nwhat we kind of ask our coaches is like\nlike once again like where does that\ncome from so you know when did they\nstart to feel like they're unattractive\nand that you kind of go back to like the\norigin of that feeling and then kind of\nwork through it for people I think the\nother thing is is that\nso like I think what you should try to\ndo is like acknowledge for a moment that\nthese people are seeing something within\nyou all right so even if you may\ndisagree or they don't fully understand\nor maybe they're trying to be nice you\nknow they're basing it on something and\nso as best as you can try to see like\nwhat is this person able to see that I'm\nnot able to see and acknowledge for a\nsecond that like other people may know\nthings about you that you don't know\nabout yourself and so it's not like you\nknow everything right which is the\nearlier discussion about the scissors\nlike I know my hair but maybe she knows\nmy hair but she but you don't know about\ncutting and I'm telling you what people\nhave used those scissors\nhow many haircuts have you given none to\ndogs or people things that have hair\nsimilar to yours the answer neither case\nis zero actually so there's someone else\non Twitter I forgot to write their user\nname said it feels like a lot of\npeople's phones come from not being able\nto connect with others how can I\npractice being less socially awkward how\ncan you get less socially awkward yeah\nhow how can I practice being less\nsocially awkward\nit's a great question so there's a\nsubtle there's a subtlety in the\nquestion how can I practice being less\nsocially awkward you can't practice\nbeing a socially awkward all you can\npractice is being socially awkward and\nif you practice being socially awkward\nfor long enough over time you will\nbecome less real right does that make\nsense like you can't get past the fact\nin the socially awkward phase it's like\nit's just a it's a part it's a part of\nthe process right so you're gonna be\nsocially awkward or you're gonna it that\nthat too but you may not be socially\nawkward you may just feel socially\nawkward so like you know if you talk to\npeople who have social anxiety their\nperception of how they're doing socially\nis far worse than like how other people\nthink they're doing so you can't\npractice being socially awkward what\nunity just practices being social and\nover time the awkwardness will decrease\nnow I'm not saying stop feeling awkward\nI'm saying you're gonna continue to feel\nawkward\nuntil you practice being subtle and then\nthe feelings of awkwardness will fade\naway I feel like one thing that's\nhelpful is like learning how to smooth\nover socially awkward moments so like\nknowing that it's not like the end of\nthe conversation like not freezing here\nright here I could clean that up clean\nit up for weeks that's why we're here\nthat's why we're doing this\nyou\nmy chops seriously wrecked okay I don't\nknow what to do with these if you won't\nlet me use clippers yeah yeah don't just\nwait why he's cut huh why can't she just\ncut the sideburns oh
