    "transcript": "so what we're gonna do is um have a\nconversation with\nand what's your name dude zach zack and\nthen we're talking with dad\nyou've only met me before i noticed\ni i'm actually remembering now okay um\nand\nzach what's your dad's name uh my dad's\nname is dave my mom's just here to say\nhi\nokay hello mom and what's your name um\njim okay would it be inappropriate if i\nwinked at you\nnot at all\nokay so what we're gonna do is um we're\ngonna talk with zach\nright first yes and then dave\nand then y'all aren't allowed to watch\nokay when we're talking with zach\nand then when we're talking with dave\nzach you're not allowed to watch\nokay because presumption of privacy so\neveryone on the internet can watch\nbut you all can't watch and then we're\ngoing to talk with the two of you\ntogether\ndoes that sound good yep any questions\nokay cool let's get started so zack\nlet's get started with you man so i'll\nask your parents to step out of the room\nget\nyeah so zach didn't we talk about um\nyour family dynamics when you came on\nstream like back in march\na little bit not a whole lot but okay\nbriefly\nokay yeah so tell me what's um oh\nyeah there we go so tell me uh your\nphd student uh dropped out\ndropped out that's right so that's what\nwe talked about right\nyeah i remember how are you doing man uh\ndoing okay i took your advice and went\nand got a therapist and have been\ntalking with her for a couple months\nuh i joined the group coaching\num awesome still some like\nstuff mentally that i have to work out\nwith myself but i'm kind of making a\nlittle bit of progress\nokay great so you say you're making a\nlittle bit of progress\nyeah so i'm starting to find that\nthere's a lot of\nthings right yeah it gets more\ncomplicated than i thought it was\nso zach the first thing i'm going to say\nis that i i think\nthis is very common where people\ni think you pro my guess or my hope is\nthat you've made a lot of progress but\nit's hard to see that right now\nif you are if you have been working with\na therapist and if you're beginning to\nsee\nwhat the road ahead is then chances are\nyou've actually gained a lot of insight\num but you'll i mean hopefully that'll\nbecome clear in a year or two\nwhen you see how far you've come you\nknow it's sometimes hard to see like\nyour progress like day to day but you\nlook back at yourself like two or three\nyears ago and you'll be like wow i was\nin a really bad spot and i'm like\nactually okay now\nthat's my hope for you okay cool so tell\nme a little bit about what's\num what's going on with uh your dad\nor you and i'm gonna just grab my\nnotebook hold on\nokay um so\nthis is it's kind of hard to like\nspecifically say it's with my dad right\nbecause this is\nsort of my whole family we have a\ncomplicated stuff going on\nokay so tell us about that so i'll start\nwith\nabout a week ago on like thursday or\nfriday my mom came into my room\nlike hey we need to talk about some\nstuff and she just sort of like spilled\nout to me\num her thoughts of how our family was\ndoing and i agreed\num which is that\noh man it's so complicated okay\nwhat did you say to you\nthis is like a couple hour long\nconversation but she was telling me that\nshe started with with it's difficult\nwith my brother\nso my brother my younger brother has\nautism he's like four years younger than\nme\nand because of kovid and other things\nthat has caused complications for him\nand has caused him to get a little bit\nmore crazy than he usually is\nokay and it's been getting worse and\nworse and worse to the point that\nuh his therapist has told my mom this\nneeds to be fixed soon because he's\nbordering on manic\nwhich is like pretty serious\nthat's very terrifying um\nso there's how does it how does it feel\nwhen\nwhen a therapist tells you this needs to\nbe fixed\nsoon oh that's that's really bad right\nlike that feels it's scary it's\num anxiety inducing like\ni've always known that he's got his\nissues\nand that we want to fix them but it's\nreally terrifying to hear that like\nhe could be put in a mental hospital if\nwe don't get this dealt with\nokay that's just scary yeah and who's\nwho takes\nlike who who is responsible for dealing\nwith it\nkind of my mom i mean my parents\ntogether but i feel like a lot of the\npressure's on my mom\nokay that's kind of interesting because\nyou know i\nand i'm not blaming anyone but i kind of\nthink about you know\nif someone is bordering on manic and\nyou're their provider\nif you're the therapist like i don't\nknow exactly what the situation is and i\nknow a lot especially with autism has to\ndo with the home environment but like\ngenerally speaking i i would think that\nthat's you know if i had a patient who\nwas bordering on manic\nlike i think i'm kind of responsible for\nthat no\nis the doctor yeah it's\nmy personal take on this is kind of all\nover the place i\nthink that he doesn't have the best\ntherapists um\nokay but then so this is where i sort of\nlink a little bit back to\nmy dad's is i think\nhe's part of the problem okay i don't\nthink the only part\ni think there's a lot of elements again\nkobe but i think that he's part of it\nbecause\nhe's a very type a personality he's\nabout rules\nhe's about um strictness and schedules\nand hitting things to the letter and\nautism does not fit well\ninto that structure and so\nif you know we plan something and\nwe don't warn my brother adequately\nenough he'll freak out about it\nthat's just what he does and then my dad\nwill get mad at him\nand try to force rules on him and try to\nforce the structure onto him and say we\nhave to do this you can't follow your\npatterns you have to go do this\nand like\ni can see kind of where he's coming from\nthat it's very hard to work with a child\nlike this\nwho will like half the time not care\nwhat you say and not do what you say and\nthey like to fight a lot\num but as the parent it's on you\nto work around that you have child\nyou're supposed to raise them\nif they're gonna be troublesome then you\nhave to be accepting of that\nnot fight with them and yell at them and\nmake it worse\nokay\nokay so zach can i just share some\nlike thoughts i know i should ask you\nmore questions\num but the first thing is that like all\nthat\nlike i agree with you 100 but bluntly\nall that [ __ ] goes out the window when\nyou have a kid with autism\nbecause it's just so hard yeah and\nand it's just like\nyeah so so i i don't disagree with what\nyou say\nand at the same time having worked with\nparents who have\nautistic kids it's tough\nlike they it tests yeah it i mean it's\nit's just hard\ni lived with him for 18 years so yeah\nso you know what's it like to live with\nhim\nuh it's been different at different\npoints\nuh so when i was younger so like before\ni left for college and everything\num it was it was really hard because\nhe was going through puberty and so\nhormones start to mess with him\nand he just gets like kind of all over\nthe place and like\nunpredictable as heck um\ni mostly just like tried to not interact\nwith them because it was really hard to\nknow when it would be a positive or when\nit would be a negative interaction and\nusually it was a negative interaction\num what does that mean\nit would it would usually lead to\nfighting\nof some kind like it was really hard to\nbe able to relate to him in any way to\nhave a conversation and\nagain he has autism so like he doesn't\nthink normally and so like having a\nconversation\nhe's just like following formulas he's\nnot like trying to communicate with you\num and so like it wasn't really there\nwasn't really much of a point to it\nand it would mostly just always devolve\nto him saying something\ni don't i don't even know why this has\nbeen so many years i've lost jack what\nit was like but\nit would just like result in fighting of\nsome kind so you like rolled your eyes\nthere\ndo you know what do you know what the\nemotion there is\nno how'd you feel as you were\nas you were thinking about what it was\nlike to try to communicate with your\nbrother\num\ni don't know it was just really hard and\nlike can i toss out a couple of words\nyeah exhausted yeah\ndefeated yes it's\ndefeated yes that's if you guys were\nwatching\nthat facial expression that's acted that\nis the facial expression of defeat\nit's it's and and we can kind of see\nthat i'm sorry back if i'm kind of\ndiving right in but like you know i can\ni can see kind of where you're coming\nfrom because what we're hearing from you\nis that like you tried to interact with\nyour brother\nbut part of the problem with autism is\nthat he like literally doesn't\nknow how to communicate yeah\nand so like you can try but like\nit's just gonna kind of bounce off and\nin a sense it can feel like no matter\nhow hard you try you end up fighting\nanyway\nand then you're kind of defeated yeah\nso sorry for kind of going down all\nthese different roads but\nit sounds tough dude like it sounds\nactually really really hard\nyeah so it was it was really hard uh at\nthat age i mean there was some like made\nlike big specific most like remember\nthere was one point where i don't\nremember what\nhappened but somehow he got really angry\nat me and he grabbed\none of the kitchen knives and started\nchasing me around the house i was like\n12 years old being chased by an\neight-year-old with the knife i was\nfreaking out\nuh there was one time we got an argument\nand he shoved me and i fell through a\nglass table\nand got caught up on my arms and\neverything i mean\nthis is like there was there was crazy\nthings that happened\nbut i went to college i got away from\nthe family for\nhowever many years four five six years\num\nand then when i came back and i was\nwatching your streams and stuff i\ndecided to like try and interact with\nhim as if he's a human\nrather than as if he's this disabled\nperson\nand it went from before i was the person\nthat absolutely couldn't interact with\nhim\nand he like pretty much hated me and i\npretty much hated him to where now\ni'm the only person in the family who\ncan like pretty much talk to him\nnormally and he will kind of do what i\nsay he doesn't\ncare at all what my parents say anymore\nso it's almost like the rules have been\nreversed\nhold on\nso much confusion there okay so yeah\nfirst thing\nis how the [ __ ] is that a little bit of\nprogress\non your part\nnumber one okay so we don't have to go\ndown that road but like can we just\nappreciate for a moment that\nalso like what the [ __ ] does that have\nto do with watching our streams\nbecause i don't anyway that's another\nquestion which we can answer on a\ndifferent day i don't know if that's\nrelevant\num i mean i'm happy in the mindset and\nit was\nand and the third thing and this is i\nthink what is important\nis like how do you feel about that\nthere's some mixed emotions to that part\nof it is\nhappiness that like i was able to\nconnect with him um\nand and it's like it's like i was being\nan [ __ ] to him before\nnow i'm not right like he really\nstruggles to communicate and i'm able to\nlike at least to\na small degree help him with that\nso this is important zach why do you\nthink i'm not judging you for it because\nthis is important\nwhy do you think you were an [ __ ] to\nhim before\nwhere does assholery come from i was\njust i was really\nimpatient with a lot i was like trying\nto do as high school kids do and\ndeal with high school dumb stupid things\nand i didn't\nat least in my mind i didn't have the\ntime to deal with this\ncrazy child who was being a nuisance and\nbothered all the time\nand so i would just be very rude to him\nand put off things\num i don't know i just\nit's really hard to like give specific\ndetails but in general just kind of a\nday\nyeah so i think that's an important\ndiscussion also one that we don't have\nto dig into today\nbut i think a lot of people who are are\n[ __ ] kind of behavior there's some\nreason like that you don't even\nunderstand\nabout why you treated him that way but\nsomething has changed in you where\nyou're treating him a different way\nand and i don't know what that is it\nsounds like that's awesome and it sounds\nlike he's lucky\nto have a brother who is thoughtful\nabout the way that like you choose to\ninteract with him and that you make\neffort to treat him not\nas a disabled person but also not as\na normal human being but you treat him\nas him\nand and your brother is incredibly lucky\nto have someone like that in their\nin their life i cannot impress that upon\nyou enough\num but let's keep going am i jumping in\ntoo much\nuh no okay so you were mean to him so\nnow he communicates only with you\nyou have happiness because you used to\nbe an [ __ ] to him and\nwhat other emotions do you have um\ni also feel a little bit upset because\nyeah i feel a little bit upset about\nlike how\nmy parents can't do the same thing at\nleast not right now\nokay so let's unpack that a little bit\nwhat does upset mean\nfrustrated uh angry\nangry at what\nthose are all umbrella emotions which\nmeans they're hiding other emotions\ni'm disappointed i guess there we go\ndisappointed in what\nthat i'm some stupid kid\nhe was able to come to this realization\nthat i was making mistakes and i was\nable to adjust that and fix that\nand that happens despite the fact that\nthey're supposed to be like\nthe knowledgeable parents there we go\nthere's a key word there they're\nsupposed to\nokay i'm a stupid kid okay zach there's\na ton there can we analyze as we go\nor do you want like you want me to hear\nyour story first\num think about that\ni guess i'm kind of curious how we'll be\nable to get through everything if we're\nanalyzing along\nthat's that's the concern so\nthen let's just okay i'm gonna do one\nmore\nanalytical piece and then we'll get\nthrough everything okay so the first\nthing is that\nyour disappointment so i think you blame\nyour parents what do you think\nyeah right so there's disappointment and\nthat also is like a little bit more\npolitically correct than blame\nbut what i'm hearing from you is that\nyou blame your parents for\nnot figuring out what you figured out\nso there's there's something also there\nwhere you say i'm a stupid kid\ni don't think you're a stupid kid i\nthink you grossly underestimate\nthe value of what you've accomplished\nbecause some autistic people go their\nentire life\nwithout having someone in their life who\ndoes what you did\nbecause what you did is not easy it's\n[ __ ] hard\num and\nyeah and i think that you have to be\ncareful because\nas long as you see what you do is easy\nyou're going to resent your parents more\nokay what do you think about that\nthat's interesting because you were\nsaying that it's really hard and i was\nthinking to myself\nit doesn't feel that hard it feels\npretty easy but if you when you\nreframe it that way that's interesting\nyep so we can continue thinking about\nthat and and i would just really ask you\nto\ni know it feels easy to you but\njust stop and think for a second about\nhow easy it is to\neffectively communicate with an autistic\nadult\nyeah right\nso so don't confuse you being really\ngood at something\nwith the fact that it's easy okay\num but we'll we'll get to that anyway i\npromise i'll shut up now and and\ni'll hear the rest of your story uh okay\nso you feel blame\nyou feel happiness what else\num those are kind of the main things i\nwould think\ni i also kind of feel bad for him right\nbecause\ni almost imagine having autism i don't\nknow i mean we don't know a whole lot\nabout it right so it's difficult to\nsay but i must imagine as you are a\nnormal person trapped\nin this strange mind that you can't\ncontrol\num and so he's trying to find\noutlets and trying to help himself in\nthat way i think\nyeah i don't really know but i think um\nand he's just trying to i mean he's just\ntrying to be normal right\nshe wants to experience what other\npeople experience and\ni mean for one it's really it's\nfrustrating to not be able to do that\nbecause of your own limitations but i\nalso feel it's very frustrating to not\nbe able to do that because of other\npeople around you not understanding\nlike one of the things that i hate the\nmost is when someone misunderstands me\nand to have that\nalways happening constantly like that'd\nbe awful\nyeah so you feel kind of sad for him\nyeah um\ndo you feel burdened at all that like\nyou kind of become\nthe last best hope\nfor him i don't know\ni mean a little bit because i'm actually\nplanning to\ngo to leave once covet goes down i want\nto like move to japan\nand so i'll be like see ya okay right\nlike i feel a little bad about it but\ni don't know i i also kind of don't\nreally\nfeel that burdened by it it's just like\ni'm being here for him while i can be\nand hopefully i can get my parents to\nrealize the same thing\nand then realize what well sir like\nrealize the same things that i have\nabout okay about how to enter yeah how\nto interact with them i guess\nhow do your parents feel about you\npeacing out after\ni haven't told them okay because i came\nto this realization like a week or two\nago\nand it's so sort of like a plan in my\nhead that i haven't really\nlike done anything about yet but the\nmore and more i sit on it the more and\nmore i'm like\nset on it and i really want to do it so\nokay\nsounds like you've made a lot of\nprogress man i know right\ni i feel like now i was exaggerating\nwhen i said a little but\nyep so that has something to do with\nyour your perception of your own\nconfidence but\noh yeah yes when i was saying earlier\nabout there's a lot of things that you'd\nfocus on so that's sort of what i mean\nokay so now we sort of get your\nperspective so what's going on in the\nfamily\nor what was the conversation when\nyeah so fill me in a little bit about\nthe conversation that you and your mom\nhad\ntell me about your dad or tell me about\nthe therapist\nsaying he's bordering on manic whichever\none you think is better\num i just can try and continue this\nconversation i can remember\na lot of the conversation was her\nexplaining to me\nher perspective on a situation that had\nhappened earlier\nso we had some my parents had hired\nwindow cleaners to come to our house and\nclean the windows\num my they were\nburdened with whatever was going on they\nwere thinking about some crazy stuff so\nthey didn't get to tell me or my brother\nuntil the night before that hey the\nwindow\nactually they told me but they didn't\ntell my brother i think\nand so i had i knew that i was gonna\nwake up in the morning and there's gonna\nbe windows cleaners there\nthere could be some crazy stuff going on\nin the house my brother didn't\num and so i'm sleeping in until like 11\nor whatever as i usually do\nthe window cleaners are here my mom was\ntelling me that\nmy dad since he's about like timing and\nrules and all this stuff starting to get\nanxious because we need to move stuff\naway from the windows\nso that they could clean it okay just\nbeing nice to them\nthey were going to probably move things\nanyways but he wanted to make sure that\neverything was out of the way for them\nso he was getting anxious about that\nand he was putting that anxiety on her\nbecause she tends to be receptive to\nother people's feelings and he tends to\nput his feelings on to other people\nokay um and so she was getting anxiety\nfrom him\nso she came into my room to wake me up\nto move some stuff around to get me to\nhelp\nand then she went to tell my brother who\ndidn't know and\nas an autistic person that's gonna upset\nhim and so she started moving things in\nhis room he started freaking out and\nthen he started to mount them\nwhich eventually later in the day\nresulted him screaming [ __ ] you to the\npainters and my parents were worried\nthat he was actually going to go out and\npush one of them off the ladder or\nsomething\nbecause like he was going crazy um\nand in all of this my dad was again\ntrying to enforce rules on him so we\nhave this\nscreaming 20 year old 300 pound guy who\nhas autism\nyou have my dad's trying to say you\ncan't do that\nyou just need to calm down and let them\nclean your windows you have\nmy mom in the middle like freaking out\nnot knowing to do trying to get everyone\nto calm down and then you have me\ndownstairs in the basement playing video\ngames trying to shout out all the noise\nuh and so she was conveying all this to\nme from her perspective\num and that was like a lot of what she\nwas talking about and then she\nstarted laying more of her other stuff\nproblems on about how like her parents\nwere coming over\nthe next day um and her parents are\nalcoholics and she struggles with that\nand then we\nsounds like she depends on you for a lot\ni i don't know because this was like\nshe doesn't usually talk to me about\nthese kind of things i see\nyeah she this was like the first time\nthat i had had any sort of conversation\nlike this with her and\nsince i had depression like she came out\nto visit me while i was in utah and that\nwas the last time we had a conversation\nlike this\nso actually then then i would i mean do\nyou think she\nhm okay so that's not a regular\noccurrence so it sounds like she doesn't\ndepend on you much\ni don't think she does well i mean it's\nkind of weird right because\nwe talk to each other very familiarly\nfamiliarly and we will have\nconversations where we try not to like\nlet my dad or my brother over here\ni don't have those kind of conversations\nwith my dad or my brother i only have\nthose conversations with my mom\njust like the very close interpersonal\nstuff\nso like what makes her\nto a degree i think she kind of does\ndepend on me for that connection but i\nwouldn't say that she\ndon't like spilling everything sure it's\nreally so it sounds like you guys are\njust\nlike just close family yeah yeah\num and and what makes it hard for you to\nhave those kinds of conversations with\nyour dad\nhe is like virtually impossible to talk\nto about any of that\nbecause again type like very hyper type\na personality\nhe's an engineer to his core\num so feelings do not compute\nright okay um and\npart of what came up in like this\nconversation my mom is she was talking\nabout how\nhe's sort of always been this way he was\nraised this way\ni don't know i actually know very little\nabout him or what happened in his\nchildhood but the way that she conveyed\nto me is\nthat his family was like this they\nweren't very connected to each other\num it was the difficult households and\nthen\ni mean once he hit college he joined\nrotc so he was military for like 30\nyears which again instills this like you\nfollow the rules of the leader\nyou don't disobey who's in command and\nnow he's in command\nand so he's very much in this way of\nyeah would you say that your dad is\noppressive\nin ways yeah it's that's it's really\nhard to say because it's very\ncomplicated right but\nsure i'm just asking if that's how it\nfeels\nwhat i'm basically getting is not really\nyes and no again it's i it's hard to say\nhow it feels\nbecause on i guess i'll give you an\nexample so\nlast night i was scrolling through\ndiscord and saw\nsomebody type the command for when does\nthe live stream go up\nand it was midnight and i saw 11 hours\nand i thought i thought it was at one\no'clock\nand then i realized no i got the time\nconversion wrong it was at 11 o'clock\nand so i had to go\ninto my parents room to tell them as\nthey were trying to go to sleep\nthat i messed it up and it was actually\nat the wrong time\nand i felt anxious about having to\nexplain that to my dad\ni felt like he was either going to be\nupset or he was going to try to cancel\nor something like that\nnot at all what happened he took it\ntotally fine and everything was okay but\ni felt like that\nso if that helps communicate to you how\ni feel around him\nin any way it it i mean that scenario\nsounds to me\nlike it's almost like the same way that\nyou interact with your brother which is\nlike\nlike you you've learned the lesson that\ntelling your dad that things are\nchanging\nleads to madness\nyeah so i think oppressive isn't the\nright word i mean it sounds like\nit sounds like you're playing with fire\nsorry what\nit's not it feels to me like you're\nplaying with fire\nyou know like you don't know when it's\ngonna blow\nthe way my mom has described it is like\nwalking on eggshells\nyour dad gets angry yes\nwhat do what does he do when he gets\nangry\nuh he does this like very cold\nnot talk to anybody um he has this like\nangry look at his face as he just like\ndoes whatever he does and he's usually\nlike kind of so aggressive with it so\nlike if he's\neating food he'll like aggressively cut\nwith the knife or whatever\num and then if anybody like talks too\nloudly\nor addresses him incorrectly then he'll\nlike\ninstead of responding i don't know in a\nnice way he responds in an angry way\nwhether that's like\nvery agitated or yelling or anything\nlike that when he\nyeah what's it like to live with someone\nlike that\nyeah it's really hard dude um\nfor a while there was it was like every\nother day when we would eat dinner my\nbrother would say something or have a\npattern or something my dad would get\nmad at him he would get mad at my dad\nand then they would yell at each other\nand i'm just trying to sit there and eat\nfood like\nzach do you think of yourself as\nresilient\nno okay\ni understand that that makes perfect\nsense to me\nand yet i'm gonna ask you\nhow would you describe someone who sits\nthere and tries to eat their food\nis on a daily basis two members of their\nfamily are constantly exploding\nat each other\nit probably is resilient right it's\nweird\nit's [ __ ] weird\nand okay\nyeah that sounds that sounds like i mean\nreally hard is like the understatement\nof the year\nhonestly it feels to me i would feel\nlike i it would be impossible\nfor me to do what you do\nlike it feels impossible to me\nyeah i mean it's kind of hard because i\ndon't know what\nto do right like if i don't like okay\nif i don't want to do it if i don't want\nto be resilient what do i do like\ni don't have any option because i kind\nof have to deal with it yeah\nbut yeah i can kind of see where you're\ncoming from yeah i like i don't know\nwhat you\nlike it sounds it sounds like an\nimpossible situation\nfeels like an impossible situation yeah\nwhat do you do about that i have no\n[ __ ] idea sit downstairs and play\nvideo games that's fun\nright on that's the right answer\num yeah man\nby the way the examples that you offer\nare really really helpful\nreally okay good yeah i think i think\nthey capture\na lot you know you're like painting a\npicture\nand like sort of a picture's worth a\nthousand words so a lot of these\ndynamics i think are very helpful\num do you feel like you've given us kind\nof like a sufficient picture\nare there other things that you want to\nadd i\nthere's nothing that i can like\nspecifically add i don't think it\nreally encompasses everything but it\nwould be really hard to because it's a\nwhole lot of you know\nmore examples of similar situations that\ni just can't remember\nor like small things here and there that\nagain are just like\nit's it's too difficult to like really\nexplain the whole the whole of it but\nthat's about as good of a picture as i\ncan give\nokay um can i\ntry to sum up what i heard and then\nmaybe we can fill in gaps okay sure um\nand then maybe we can talk about your\ndad a little bit more but\nokay so your parents have two sons\nyou're the older son you're\ni understand that you don't view\nyourself as very competent\nbut we know that there's con there's\nevidence to the contrary let's put it\nthat way\nright so like you were in a pretty\ncompetitive phd program\nyou ended up dropping out slash getting\nkicked out\nat a toxic advisor things like that you\nthought that your toxic advisor and for\npeople who\ni guess i'm surprised i remember but you\nknow you thought\nthat everything that your advisor was\ndoing to you\ni think towards the end you really\nrealize that it's not really your fault\nthat your advisor was actually pretty\nbad\nbut i can imagine that that would be a\npretty severe blow to your confidence\nso you kind of come home you have a\nyounger brother who's autistic\num it sounds like early on maybe things\nwere sort of okay\nbut then as he start started to grow and\nyou started to grow it became very very\ndifficult to interact with him\num it sounds to me like your parents\nsort of did the best that they could but\nwhen your dad kind of is in crisis mode\nhe goes back to what he knows\nwhich is control structure right when\nthere's a problem like you you rely on\nsystems\nresources and rules to kind of deal with\nit\nthere's not a whole lot of fluidity so\nit also sounds like he gets\nanxious actually pretty easily\nand the way that he responds to his own\nanxiety is control\nso when he gets anxious he tries to\ncontrol [ __ ] yes\nand it sounds like he also\nrecruits your mom to be one of his tools\nto leverage control\nin the household yes and because\nshe is somewhat conflict avoidant\nshe kind of gives in\nbecause she's walking on eggshells and\ndoesn't want to you know doesn't want to\nstep on any eggs and\nwant to end up with yolk on the floor so\neveryone sort of listens to your dad\nbecause he kind of like he sort of runs\nthe show is pretty controlling if you\ndon't listen to\nyour dad maybe there's not a whole lot\nof like dialogue there's not a whole lot\nof like opinions or like\nhey dad they can move the stuff\nthemselves like he's not really in the\nspace to sort of hear that kind of thing\nyeah um and then we kind of come to your\nso it sounds like you and your mom are\nclose\nright so you guys can connect with each\nother because both y'all are sort of\nlike\ntalkers or feelers and it\nit it seems like your dad and your\nbrother have difficulty engaging\non that wavelength yeah so i'm not\nreally detecting\nany amount of kind of like reverse\nparenting\nso sometimes we get into situations\nwhere parents\nbecome the children and children become\nthe parents\nyeah that's i'm not getting any of that\nso it doesn't sound like your mom\nleans on you for her emotional needs it\nsounds like you guys like you're an\nadult and she's an adult\nand you all are close family members you\nall understand each other you all love\neach other and you all just have a\nstrong relationship\nwhere there's pretty even flow of\ncommunication yeah\num then we come to your brother so your\nbrother is autistic\nit's unclear to me exactly where he is\nin terms of function but it sounds like\nhe's like kind of functional but\nhas a lot of difficulty managing his own\nemotions\nand and can kind of be okay if he's got\na routine\nbut i'm not hearing that he's like\nnon-verbal\nor or things like that that like you\nknow his emotions escalate\npretty easily he doesn't respond well to\nroutine but you can communicate with him\nhe does to a certain degree appreciate\ncommunication\nyeah i mean we used to joke because the\nwhen\nhe was first diagnosed they said that he\nwould be non-verbal and now we joke that\nhe's overly verbal\nyeah that's great i mean that's actually\na huge\nthat's a huge win whether y'all realize\nit or not which i think it's hard for\nyou guys to realize but um\nyou know having a autistic kid who\nbecomes verbal\nis like really amazing\nand it's a testament to what your family\nhas accomplished which it may not seem\nlike that right now but\nyou know i've seen other cases where\nnon-verbal kids end up non-verbal\nand that also doesn't mean that their\nfamilies didn't try hard enough which is\nwhat's really hard about autism\nbut i think you guys really deserve a\npat on the back for\num you know what y'all have done for him\nso then the other thing that i'm going\nto kind of hypothesize a little bit is\nis you know it sounds like your\nbrother's autism\nand your dad's desire for control are\nsort of like\noil and water like that just sounds bad\nyeah\ni i sort of liken it to\ntwo autistic people with very different\npatterns trying to mesh those patterns\ntogether\nlike that just will not happen at all so\ntell me a little bit about\nyou know how they don't measure why they\ndon't mesh and i'm guessing\ni can phrase the question slightly\ndifferently what's the cycle\nbecause it sounds like there's a cycle\nin there but\ntell me about their interactions so my\nbrother has\nlike eight billion different little\npatterns he goes through on a regular\nbasis\num and my dad will come up with\nsomething\nwhether it's dinner time or we'd go\nsomewhere or there's work that needs to\nbe done\nor someone's coming to fix the house in\nsome way whatever something needs to\nhappen\nand then that does not agree with the\npattern of my brother\nso like often what happens is my dad\nwill get frustrated that it's dinner\ntime but my brother has to go walk the\ndog right now because that's his pattern\nand so there's conflict there um\nand so my dad will say like well why\ndidn't you do it earlier or why don't\nyou do\nafter and my brother would say because i\nwant to do it now\nand then my dad will um either roll his\neyes and go\nand then be like whatever or he'll fight\nwith him\num and he'll say like no you have to do\nx now you need to do it now\nthis needs to happen and then my brother\nwill yell and scream and then start\nfighting and then\nat that point communication breaks down\nand it's just and\narguing people not even like aiming at\neach other it's just like\ncraziness yeah so the cycle is like\nthe my brother is always in his constant\nstate of like existing in his patterns\nand if my dad has something that\nneeds to happen they both have this\nthing that needs to happen but they\ncan't happen together like they just\ncan't\ncoexist and so then disagreement comes\nfrom there okay\nand so so is would it be fair for me to\nassume that the more\nconflict arises the more your dad\ndoubles down on control\nand the more he doubles down on control\nthe more conflict arises\nyes do so if your dad your dad sometimes\ngives up and accepts defeat\ndoes your brother do that does your dad\never win no no he doesn't\nokay\nokay so i mean do you feel like we have\na pretty good picture\nof what these dynamics are like yeah uh\nwhen you were laying it out it was\ni felt like it was better than the way i\ntried to lay it out like you really hit\nthe nail\nno buddy you laid it out i'm just\ntelling you what i heard\nokay um i think you like i said you gave\na lot of very very\nillustrated illustrative actual examples\nthat captured a lot of that essence\nvery well um so\nwhat helped me understand a little bit\nabout like you know why are\nwe here today so like what's what's the\ngoal of like having you and your dad\ncome on\nbecause i'm not hearing any\ncommunication issues between you and\nyour dad\nyeah uh i'm not fully sure uh\nto be honest because okay so my mom came\nin and had this conversation with me\nthat's when i\nremembered that you guys were looking\nfor families to come on and that's when\ni\nmessaged french hey i got a family that\nneeds to come on\nokay and after going back and forth he\nsaid that you wanted to have\nonly like two people come on to more\ndirect\nlet's have you and your dad tomorrow's\nlike all right cool\nokay um so\nso what do you what what do you what\nwould you like to change about your\nfamily dynamic\noh that's a good question ah\ni mean there's a couple things for one i\nwould like\nmy parents to have a better\nunderstanding of\nmy brother and be\nhow do i put this\ni want them to be less likely to\nconflict with him right like i this\nwhole thing with my dad dumbling down of\ncontrol and him getting more angry and\nmy dad doubling down again and then him\ngetting more angry like\nthat's obvious to me i want that to be\nobvious to him\nso that he doesn't do that anymore a's\nfor me\nbecause i can't have constant yelling in\nmy life\nb for my mom because she also needs\npeace\nc for my brother so that he doesn't have\nthis conflict and d for my dad because\ni mean like i said my dad was raised in\nthis very like rules way and i don't\nthink that's good for him\nor for anybody in the family okay\num and i think that's actually i think\nthat'd be such a\nto somehow find a way to slowly break\nhim out of that because that would solve\nso many different things\nbreaking bad this this\nuh rules-based very strict style that he\nhas always been\nokay so what we want to do is change him\nas a human being\nwell yeah like no no but hey i asked you\ni asked you what do you want to change\nthat's cool\nbecause it's real like i have\nno connection with my dad whatsoever i\ndon't know if i've ever really like\nwanted one because i\nhave never really like experienced that\nin any way we just have never connected\nwith each other really hardly at all\num whereas i have been able to connect\nand\nbe pretty friendly with my mom and i\nlike that connection so if there were\nsome way to have that with my dad i\ndon't know if that's practical or\npossible or if that's even something\nthat i really want but\nokay um has your dad ever seen a\ntherapist\nno nope he has always looked at it his\npsychological mumbo-jumbo ignored that\ncrap\nit was hard to get him into this\nwell hey so like strong work with\ngetting him here right like that's\nthat's\nhe deserves he deserves some props for\nshowing up\nyeah oh i forgot to mention when i was\ntalking to my mom in here\num she had mentioned to me that she\nbrought up family counseling with my dad\nand it was the first time that he had\nagreed that this is maybe\nsomething we should do so he's like kind\nof starting to go a little bit in that\ndirection\nokay any questions for me zach\ni don't know i don't have anything come\nto mind right now i mean i feel like we\ngot to talk to your dad bro\nyeah like i think you've laid out a\npretty good picture\nuh thankfully since we've talked before\ni know a little bit about you\noh are we lagging okay um but i think a\nlot of this has to come\nfrom your dad's perspective and then\nwe'll get both you all in together does\nthat sound good to you\nyeah let's swap and no watching okay\nokay let me find them\nall right\nall right twitch how you guys is this\nsound like a good use of our time\non stream\nokay\nhey dr gay hey dave how are you good are\nyou\nuh i'm doing well man um how do you feel\nabout doing this\num i've never done it before uh\na little uncomfortable just a little\nokay quite a bit i can imagine right\nlet's\nlet's just call it what it is you know\nyeah i won't hide it yeah\num you know i've i've had experiences\nand standing up and briefing\nuh small and large groups of people\nso it's kind of in the same realm i\nhaven't done that for a long time\nbut it's one of those things uh the more\nyou do it\nthe more you become comfortable with it\nparticularly if you fully understand the\nsubject\nmatter and here i don't because i don't\nknow where you're coming from\nsure so so maybe i can help you there\nwould you like\nto hear where i'm coming from sure okay\nso i'm gonna kind of zoom\nout a little bit okay and tell you a\nlittle bit about what we do here\nso i'm uh we tend to just talk to people\non the internet because it's been my\nexperience that like\npeople share a lot of the same\nchallenges in life\nand that by talking to one person like i\nbasically have the same conversations\nwith a lot of different people\nand so what we do here is we have\nconversations with people that other\npeople watch\nbecause i can imagine that you have\nor y'all's family has some amount of\nconflict\nor maybe some kind of difficulty\ncommunication in communicating\nand that is also true of every other\nfamily in the history of human existence\nand so the reason that we're here today\nis to see if that there's something we\ncan help\nyou guys do to maybe communicate a\nlittle bit better\nmaybe to be to understand each other a\nlittle bit better\num understand how the the dynamics of\nthe family unit\nworks right so like it's a big i have a\nbig belief that\nin order to change something you have to\nunderstand how it works\nso what we're really here to do today is\nto try to understand a little bit about\nwhat's going\non um in you in your family\nand in the interface between those two\nthings\nhow does that sound good sounds good so\ncan you tell me a little bit about\num so zach had mentioned that there's\nbeen like you know tensions have been\nrunning high in the house\nrecently um would you agree with that\nyes can you help me understand a little\nbit about what your perception of that\nis\num part of it i'll say there's been a\nchange in the family dynamics\nin the recent months partially due\nto covid absolutely in the fact that\num in a normal day pre-coveted\ni was at work my wife works from home\nand our son was in school\nand he would normally get home about 2\n30.\nsince covid um\ni'm working from home for the past four\nmonths\nuh our other child\nthe one that zach had mentioned was\nautistic\nuh he's home now full-time and\nand zach's been home full-time so\neverybody's home 24-7\nand it's been a drastic change for the\nautistic\nson and that his normal\ndaily routine has been disturbed\nand he's trying to find himself with new\nroutines\nand he really he's he's a little unique\nautistic kid in the way that he is\nsocial\nwhere most are not social and he misses\nthat social interaction that he gets\nriding the bus\nand with his teachers and peers in his\nschool he's in a\ntransition program he graduated from\nhigh school but they hold the diploma\nuntil he completes a two-year transition\nprogram to help set him up\nfor employment or some other opportunity\nokay so offers that and it's a real good\nprogram so he will come to uh\nto the end of that program here in\ndecember but any case\nhis normal routine and social\ninteraction\nis has not been happening the last four\nmonths\nand so that's caused a drastic behavior\nchange in him\nokay that's added added stress yeah so i\nwas just going to say that sounds like a\npretty hefty stressor\non the system of your family yes\nhow does that stress manifest\nuh with the\nthe autistic center his name is carson\nhe uh\nhas become had more meltdowns become\nmore\ndifficult to manage his behavior\nhe's very obsessed with patterns\nand if he can't do his patterns the way\nhe wants to\nfor various reasons whether the weather\ninterferes with him going outside and\nwalking the dog\nor some other\ninterference as a result of family\nactivities perhaps\nhe'll have a meltdown and that disturbs\nthe family\nit can evolve into shouting\nand yelling and it takes us 30 to 40\nminutes to calm him down\nto where he can reason through the\nsituation at hand\nokay so tell me what a meltdown you kind\nof mention this a little bit\nwhen you say he has more meltdowns like\ntell us tell me or\nus what a meltdown looks like it becomes\nuh\nuncontrollable verbally and emotionally\nhe'll start yelling he\nwill make statements that are\nunclear and don't make any sense and\nhe can become very physical\nand um he is 6'3 240\nso he's bigger than mom and dad so that\nbecomes a\nturn and so the key here is\nde-escalation\nand to talk him down and to get him calm\nthat you can reason through the\nsituation\nand um it can be very very challenging\nand draining\nfor both mom and dad and and obviously\nzach as well too\nhow do you de-escalate him\ntalking continually\ntalking and talk him down\nhelp me understand what that looked like\num patience we have to stay\ncalm even though we may be exhausted and\nstressed\nsounds like it's an exhausting situation\nit is mentally\nand it can't be physically because uh\nthis can happen late at night\nyou know when we're ready to go to bed\nhe can have a meltdown 11 30 at night\nand it'll take us\nyou know an hour and a half to get him\nsituated and ready for bed for example\nand um it's it's uh\nbeing patient and us remaining calm\nand talking him down in\nfrom the situation and trying to reason\nthrough it what are the words that you\nuse\nto talk him down or reason through the\nsituation can you give us an example\none is breathing get him\nto take deep breaths and try to calm\nhimself down\nphysically and hopefully and then\neventually\nmentally as well so he can think\nrationally and uh you know the\nadrenaline kicks in\nand um he can get spun up\nphysically in in mentally pretty rapid\nand what do you say\nis that we have uh you know he has\ncounselors and therapists\nit we're uh wanting to get family\ntraining to know how to work with him\nand\nunderstand what his triggers are that\nsounds like a great idea\num so what what do you say when when he\ngets wound up\nwhatever the situation is\nis is to talk through that situation\nand very elementary terms\nand let him try to understand there's\nnot any consequence\nin not doing one of his patterns\nand for example it may be\nhe has patterns that he does during the\nday and it delays him to take the dog\nout for a walk that's one of his\nuh things he loves to do it's one of his\npatterns\nand if the weather rolls in and it\nstarts raining\nthen he's in conflict that he can't do\nhis pattern he\nhe wants to do it but he can't because\nit's raining and so he's in a do loop\nand he can't get out of it and so we try\nto come up with alternatives to say\nlet's wait till the rain passes or two\ntomorrow knowing that a storm is coming\nin the afternoon let's change your\npattern and walk the dog in the morning\nand so we try to reason through\nalternatives\nto permit him to complete his pattern\nokay okay and\nand how does it how do you manage\nall of this stress or\nyeah how how do you manage that i mean\nit sounds\nso sort of deep i mean just\nsure decompress but also like how do you\nmanage things in the moment\nyou know how do you feel when it's 11 30\nat night\nand\nthat that scenario is very difficult at\nnight because uh\ni i get it you know about nine o'clock\ni'm starting to get tired\nand if we're watching something on tv\nand uh\nhe starts to have a meltdown you know 10\n11 o'clock at night\num you have to regain your composure\nin uh what does that mean regain your\ncomposure what is\nwhat is losing computer look and feel\nregaining\nit should say regain some strength you\nget some endurance that you may be out\nof gas\nby the end of the day but need to\n[Music]\ndig deep and and get the strength\nto get you through the period it takes\nto get\nto calm him down from from a potential\nmeltdown\nokay what happens if you dig deep and\nthere's nothing there\nnothing left then\nat some point i've lost it\nas well as my wife and there's you know\nthere's a threshold that we all have\nabsolutely and we've learned that\nuh both parents or one parent\nand and and carson um\nshouting and yelling and and getting\ninto an escalation\nis of no value to anybody we've learned\nthat so\nagain the key is is you gotta gain\ncomposure get your mind together and\nrealize we got to de-escalate\nand think through quickly how you can\nprovide alternatives and rationalize\nwith them to calm them down\ncan i think for a second dave sure\nit's gonna take me a minute okay sure\ni'm just gonna i'm trying to process\neverything that you've said really kind\nof pay attention to it\nreally try to understand you know the\ninputs that you're offering us\nand integrating it a little bit with\nsome of what your son has said\nso the first thing that i want to point\nout is that a lot of what you're saying\nlike you use a lot of like language of\nnecessity\nso you say you gotta you need to you\nhave to\nyou gotta dig deep you gotta find\nstrength\ndoes that make sense\nyeah and\nand i know this may sound kind of weird\nbut like\nwhat needs to be done is like quite\ndifferent from\nhow it feels in the moment right it's\nsort of like looking forward\ndoes that make sense the end state\nyes so you're focusing on the end state\nyou're focusing on the goal\nright do you think there's value\nto focusing on things besides the goal\nlike how you feel in the moment\nsure what's the value in that\nshort-term results what does that mean\nsmall steps to get to your goal take one\nstep at a time\nand it could be calm yourself down first\nbefore you can help someone else okay so\nit seems like the value\nof like your emotions understanding your\nemotions\nis so that you can master them so that\nyou can get to your end goal\nyes so the only value that i'm really\nhearing from you about\nunderstanding let's say the way that you\nfeel in the moment\nis because that's going to help you get\nto your end goal is that fair\nyeah okay\nso i don't know how exactly to explain\nthis so i'm going to\nthink about it for a little while and\ni'm going to ask you some more questions\nbut in my experience there's value to\nknowing what you feel\nindependent of it getting you to your\ngoal\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah that\nhow you feeling what how you feel in the\nmoment is important\nand that can\ninfluence i guess the outcome sure\nyour goal so\nso what i'm wondering is is there\nimportance if it doesn't influence your\noutcome\nno no i haven't thought about that\nwhat do you think\nso explain that a little bit more so let\nme think about that\nlet me just try to come up with an\nexample\nso i'm going to use a slightly dire\nexample\nso and and maybe there's i'm sure\nthere's an outcome somewhere here so\nlet's say that i have someone who\nhas cancer and that the cancer is\nterminal\nlike understanding that the cancer is\nterminal changes nothing about the fact\nthat the person is going to die\nand yet just understanding that you have\nterminal cancer can change something\nwithin you\nlike it has value\nright and so you could say that there's\nan outcome there too which is that you\nspend your the rest of your life in a\nslightly different way\nso i'm sort of always seeing an outcome\nbut oddly enough\nas someone who's worked with terminal\ncancer patients\ni've observed that even if it doesn't\nchange something about their life or it\ndoesn't lead to a goal\nthat understanding how you feel and\nunderstanding what the situation is\nin and of itself has value\ndoes that make sense yes here you go\nso another example is like when i think\nabout a flower\nlike and i look at a flower and i think\noh that flower is beautiful\nthere's no goal there\nthere's no like there's no outcome\nand understanding that i appreciate\nflowers and like just watching a flower\nand appreciating it for what it is\ncan have value but there's not really a\ngoal does that make sense\nyeah as you're saying and so\nwhen you say you see what i'm saying\nwhat what do you think i'm saying\nwhat do you see because i i don't even\nknow what i'm saying\nso help us out not everything has to\ncontribute to a goal\nand you can enjoy the moment for\nwhatever value it provides you\nokay if it's entertainment\nfulfillment happiness\nsure so uh so that's that's a really um\ngreat way to put it dave so let me ask\nyou actually another question\nit sounds like appreciating the moment\nwithout a goal\nis important if it has a positive\ndirection\nso happiness joy beauty\nwhat about negative things\ni guess just be undesirable unless\nunless there is some value in it i can't\nthink of an example now where\nokay a negative negative uh outcome in\nthe in a moment\nlike that would have value except that\nif it was negative\nmaybe you learn from it sure yeah okay\nthe learning experience\nyeah so um\nthe best thing that i can kind of think\nof is in terms of a negative thing is\nlike what i think of is like the\ngrieving process right so like grieving\nis sort of this weird thing where sure\nyou can also see outcomes because after\ngrieving you're not maybe\nless sad or no longer sad or something\nlike that but i i think that there's\njust\nvalue in people like grieving together\nand just acknowledging that there's been\nsome kind of loss\nand sure that leads to like peace down\nthe road so you could say that's an\noutcome\nbut sitting with grief i think sometimes\nis not always a bad thing\nwhat do you think i agree grieving is\npart of the healing process\nokay how are you feeling right now by\nthe way\na little more comfortable than when it\nstarted okay or do you feel like we're\nwalking on shaky ice\nno um i'm\nstruggling for the words to try to\narticulate our son's behavior\nuh in in answering your question on how\nwe de-escalate\nand it's it's kind of one of those\nthings it's a little difficult\nto describe but\num it's it's a tactic or technique\nin trying to de-escalate and it's a\nlittle difficult to describe\nand it is and it depends on the\nsituation at hand because\nhis meltdowns quite often aren't\nconsistent they're they're different\nthings that would uh\nbring on a meltdown sometimes they're\nunpredictable\nsometimes we can predict them okay\num okay that makes sense because it it\nsounds like\nyou know you're doing a lot of stuff up\nhere you're making a lot of calculations\nand that's like a pretty complex\nequation and then like\nwords come out of your mouth but it's\nhard to really explain to us\nhow that process works right\nthat makes a lot of sense i mean i can\nimagine it would be hard to to explain\nit you know to amplify on that our\nfriends\nand family who see him occasionally\nthink he's the sweetest kid but they\ndon't\nknow what he's like at home\nso how does that feel\nfor them to see him as the sweetest kid\nbut not know what he's like at home\nit's it's difficult because they\nthey don't understand how he could\nbehave and have meltdowns\nlike we described and\nuntil they witness it themselves\nwhat's difficult about that\nsome people don't believe us\nso what is it like to be not believed by\nsome people\nwhat is it like to have them not\nunderstand\num it is difficult to relate\nokay so\ni think dave that there's an emotion\nthere\ndifficult to relate is what we see on\nthe outside\nright that's a result like it's hard for\nthese two people to relate\nhow do do you have a sense of if there's\nlike an emotion that you feel\nwhen other people don't understand what\nyou're saying\nno it's just um\nit's just one of those things you can\ntry to articulate it and ex\nand describe what a meltdown is what\ncauses it\nbut until they they witness it firsthand\ni don't think they they have a full\nunderstanding of it right so what's it\nlike for you\nto talk to someone who doesn't have a\nfull understanding and sort of like\nthinks that he's just this\nhappy-go-lucky kid\nit it's um\nit doesn't bother me or it isn't um\nany in difficult at all it's just you\ntry to articulate it and if they don't\nunderstand or comprehend it that's okay\nit doesn't affect me at all\nsure but\nthey don't know what our life is really\nlike\nat home so what do you think it's like\nfor a human being\nto interact with other human beings who\ndon't know\nwhat their life is like\nuh misunderstanding don't understand\nwhat makes him tick so i'm going to toss\nout a word which is what i'm digging for\nokay but i think that this is a\nvocabulary that\nthat you may be unfamiliar with we're\nplaying with a system\nthat you may be kind of unfamiliar with\nso when i\nwhen i hear that what i imagine you may\nbe feeling on some level\nis actually kind of like isolated\nwhen i think about human connection i\nthink about people who can relate to\neach other\nand relationships are based on like\nshared experiences\nand when i think about someone who\ndoesn't share like who has an experience\nof child\nrearing and and has a sun that other\npeople haven't seen what that sun is\nlike\ni can imagine that it's difficult for\nyou all to have\na shared experience of what it's like\nwhat what carson is like\nand when i think about a lack of shared\nexperience then i think about isolation\nbecause shared is experience is what\nconnects us\nwhat do you think yeah i see what you're\nsaying\num i guess to expand on that is you're\nright uh we we don't have a common\nexperience with other\nfamily friends in in that relationship\nof a child\nwith special needs um\nbut yet on the other hand those family\nfriends that we do have\nwe do have a lot of other things in\ncommon sure\nand uh socialize together of course\nuh weekend ski trips together for\nexample in which carson participates\nbut on that one realm of\nspecial needs here or a child behavior\nthey can't fully relate to it\nand how do you feel if they\ndo understand if they see it\nit's a good feeling that there is a\ncommon understanding\nand they can appreciate what we go\nthrough\nyeah what is that feeling\nwell satisfying comforting\nyeah i see you smiling a little bit\nyeah do you know what you're feeling\nright now like as we started talking\nabout it i noticed that that feeling\nalmost came up for you\nyes it's trying to get to uh describing\nwhere where you're leading me to trying\nto help find the words to\ndescribe it yeah what so what what are\nyou feeling\ndo you know it's the\nunderstanding and the relationship\nbetween people\nyeah so can i toss out a word\nconnect it right you feel connected\nand how how does it feel like because\nlike that feels good right so\nso what what i'm hearing from you it's\nstrange right because you would\nthink for a moment let's be\nnon-judgmental okay dave so you would\nthink for a moment that\nyour family friends seeing one of\ncarson's meltdowns would be like a bad\nthing\non paper it looks like a bad thing and\nin a sense it is a bad thing\nbut i think there's something really\nimportant here which is that\ni get the sense that you and your family\nare sort of like\nfighting this like very isolated war\nand every day is a struggle and and\ncarson's fighting with you guys too like\ni don't think he's the enemy i think\nhe's on your team\nand what you guys are fighting against\nis carson's autism\nand covet and and i think your brother\ni mean your son put it beautifully that\nhe kind of thinks about carson as a\nnormal person\nwho's trapped in an autistic mind\nwhat do you think about that i agree\nand and sometimes it can feel\nvery very tiring and exhausting and\nstressful\nto fight what i imagine may sometimes\nfeel like you to be an\nendless battle like do you think this is\na battle that you got a war that you\nguys win\nno i i don't look at it in that realm\nit is something we have to learn\nabout him because we can't fix him\nyet we have to\nunderstand him and connect with him\nand the way his mind processes\nand how he deals\nwith his frustrations and challenges\nand communications with us and it's a\ndaily\ndaily challenge and a daily lesson\nlearned\nand it's it's trying\nbut that's the way my wife and i are is\nwe face challenges and we i see that on\nand keep keep chugging away day at a\ntime\nyeah you know he uh zach mentioned\nsomething else to me was that which is\nthat carson\num when he was first diagnosed with\nautism\nyou guys had been sort of given the\ndiagnosis that he's going to be\nnon-verbal\nright and that he's apparently\noverly verbal now which which i think is\nactually like a huge testament to the\nattitude that you and your wife take\nwhich is that you know you face\nchallenges head on and and i'm telling\nyou i've seen\nnon-verbally diagnosed autistic people\nwho end up\nnon-verbal and i've also seen\nfamilies who do heroic things and and\ndefy all the odds and i've also seen\nfamilies who do heroic things and the\nodds don't get divided\nright we've been fortunate and\ni do give credit to my wife because she\nand\nhas endured it more than me because i've\nbeen at work you know 18 hours a day and\nshe's been home\nraising him but\nwe have treated him like a normal kid\nwith no disability\nand inclusion is very important and i\nthink\nbecause of that we we've had the\nsuccesses we've had\nyeah how do you feel talking about this\nstuff\nit's it's great to talk about it it's a\ngreat feeling uh\nthe um\neven though we have the daily challenges\nwe have to reflect back on the progress\nthat we've made and how far he's come\nand that for example like you mentioned\nhe's non-verbal and he's using sign\nlanguage we\ntaught sign language to him when he was\nthree years old\nand uh wow cherry is now\nfully verbal he's graduated from high\nschool\nand um we've made great progress\nhe plays the piano he's a awesome skier\nhe's on\nwe're a coach in special olympics and so\nhe's made\ngreat progress physically emotionally\nand\nintellectually as well but a lot of\ncredit goes to my wife\nbecause she helped him get through high\nschool by tutoring at home\nand building study sheets for him on the\nvery subject matters that he was taken\nin high school\nand uh it's it's been a team effort\na lot of investment and\nwe're reaping some of those rewards but\nwe still have a long ways to go though\nindependence independence is where we're\nwe're striving for that he can live on\nhis own\nand hold uh hold down a job and um\nbe able to interact socially yeah we got\na ways to go\nbut that has come at a sacrifice too\nwith uh i think with what have you\nsacrificed uh i think with zach it's\nit sacrificed time with him because of\nthe interruptions and disturbances\nuh due to carson's behavior and and uh\nthe challenges with him\nuh and certainly other sacrifices you\nknow in the family as well\nbut um you know we're dealt our deck of\ncards and we play our hand\nand uh except we look back and look at\nthe great progress he's made\nbut it's been a lot of work getting\nthere\nnot complaining would it be okay if you\ndid\ni think it'd be selfish you know um\nthis is our family what's selfish about\ncomplaining\nwell complaining that my life pity on me\nbecause of my family life with an\nautistic son\nbut uh there's other great rewards that\nothers don't\ndon't experience and that's seeing a\nchild\nthat's disabled grow and become mature\nand striving towards independence and\nseeing the progress there's great\nrewards and satisfaction in that\nokay so dave i'm gonna toss something\nout for you to think about okay\ni understand where you're coming from in\nterms of\nnot complaining and you know not\nthrowing yourself a pity party\nand at the same time i think we're\nrunning up against\nsome lost value and there's a difference\nbetween\naccepting that you have some negative\nemotion\nand throwing yourself a pity party\nas bizarre as the sounds i think that\nyou\n[Music]\nare entitled if you feel like it to\ncomplain\nwhat do you think about that\ni can understand that and i'll be honest\nmy wife and i\nhave complained to each other good and\nit's good and healthy to talk about that\nand\nmyself i'm more independent\nprefer to do my own problem solving\nand resolve things myself\nand not have to rely on others where did\nyou find that\ngood question i don't know if i think\nit's just i'm wired that way\nhow do people get wired dna\ngenetics probably from my parents\ncan you tell us my wife and i again\nwe're kind of\nwired in the same fashion is we hunker\ndown and get her done\nand uh yeah we can um\ntalk about it ourselves console each\nother\nand and if you want to say complain\nbut yet we look back and we see uh\nhow grateful we are in the gratitude and\nhow rewarding has been working with our\nson but yet it's been very difficult at\nthe same time\nyeah i think that complain is a tricky\nword because it implies\ni can't imagine complaining and\ngratitude coexisting\nbut the way that you're kind of talking\nabout it i i do think that there's been\nsorrow and joy triumph and failure\nyou know when i really hear about it i\nthink that there's been negative and\npositive\num and i i do i would encourage you to\nyou know i'm actually happy that you you\ncomplained to your wife i think that's\nhealthy for you i think it's healthy to\nacknowledge that\nthings are hard for us sometimes and it\ndoesn't make us weak\nwhat do you think yeah i agree it's\nhealthy\nit's uh it's been consoling\nit's therapeutic\neven talking with friends we've we've\ntalked with friends before too that did\ndo understand carson and\nthey sympathize with this encourage us\nand then they're also\nvery very encouraging as well\nso can you tell us a little bit about\nyour upbringing\nsure i uh\ngrew up in southern california was uh\ninvolved in high school sports and in\nband\nuh went to college in southern\ncalifornia\nand then i was on a rotc scholarship\nwow and so graduating from college then\ni went right into the air force\ni was commissioned within the air force\ni had a variety of space operations\njobs and system acquisition for space\nsystems\nand then uh spent 27 years in the air\nforce retired\n13 years ago been working for a defense\ncontractor\never since uh married my wife when i was\na little more senior\n36 year old 36 years old and\num she had uh one son\nfrom a prior marriage and then we had\nzach and carson\nand we've been married 27 years wow\nso hey can i ask you a couple questions\nthey may be a little bit personal you're\nallowed to not answer them\nsure um i i appreciate the hesitation\nwith your answer there\nbut so let me ask you something like uh\nyou know\nwhat about her what like so i think\nabout a 36 year old guy\nwho's unmarried and so i i sometimes\nthink that it takes a special kind of\nwoman\nto you know get you to settle down\ncan you tell us a little bit about what\nyour experience with meeting your wife\nwas like and how you guys decided to get\nmarried\nsure um you're right she's a special\nwoman\ni married up\nand uh we had\ni think a lot in common in uh\nthe career field we were in i was in the\nair force she was a civilian\ndefense contract or excuse me a defense\nemployee\nuh we had the same ambitions for his\nfamily\nuh same likes and dislikes in the way of\nhobbies and sports and we kind of had\nthe same drive\ntoo i think we're kind of wired similar\nas i mentioned before we\nwe face challenges head on and we like\nworking challenges\nand uh and being fulfilled with\nsuccess and the outcome of uh of\nchallenges\nand uh we had just a lot in common\nand uh we can communicate we could talk\nshe was\nshe's was my best friend then and she\nstill is\nyou say you're wired similarly um\nyou mean like in what way what about\ny'all is similar in terms of your wiring\nor drive um\nfollow through to completion\ni'll say service\nserving others so that they are\nsatisfied which\nis sometimes challenging obviously but\num\nconcerned about always meeting the needs\nof others\nin our in our careers even what she does\nnow\nshe's an interior designer uh always uh\nwanting to satisfy the customer the\nclient\nsounds like she really puts other people\nahead of herself\nyes definitely you sound like you value\nher a lot\noh yeah\nyeah like that she's she's my best\nfriend so i can lean on her with\nanything\ndoes she lean on you yes\num emotionally and she can come talk to\nme\nuh physically she's out helping me with\nprojects working on the house\num essentially any other project\nwe do things together and uh we're a\ngood team\nand uh she has talents like in\ncommunication she's better at\ncommunicating than i am you know i'm\ni'm an engineer engineers typically\ndon't know how to communicate very well\nand i'm a good example of that\nand she's uh very complimentary in that\nrealm when\nif i have to write something or have to\nuh articulate something she's very good\nat helping in crafting\nthe right choices of words\nyou know oddly enough dave i don't know\nthat i would agree with you that\nengineers are not good at communicating\nnor would i call you a not good\ncommunicator\num can i tell you what i see\nsure i don't see a problem with\ncommunication i see\na lack of vocabulary\nfair fair assessment i i don't think\nit's an issue of talent i think it's an\nissue of\nexperience you know i think you're i\nthink if we gave you the words\nyou'd be able to use them very very well\ni think you're just somewhat unfamiliar\nwith the words\nbecause i think you're somewhat\nunfamiliar with your internal\nenvironment\nwhich is a little bit judgmental to say\nbut i'm just you know you've been very\nauthentic with me and i hope it's okay\nthat i'd be transparent with you\nand i'll explain what i mean by that\nwhat do you think about that\nyou're right uh english and\ncommunication has not been my strong\nsuit\nnor a big interest\nwhen it came to academics or school and\nit has been\none of the weaker talents of mine\nor skill sets i preferred more the math\ntechnical side sure that's where that's\nwhat i enjoy\nuh never have been one that really\nenjoys writing novels or\nstories or or anything like that so my\nwife is a little more talented in that\nthat realm and then so we balance each\nother out\nyeah so so if i can offer something kind\nof relating to that so i think it's\ninteresting because\nunderstanding the self in the west\nhas become related to like poetry\nright it's like understanding the self\nand understanding emotions is like\ntherapy and poetry and it's all these\nlike nebulous\nlike not really based in any real system\nkind of things does that make sense\ni mean i i say this as a psychiatrist\nlike i've just noticed this\nso there's an interesting study that was\ndone that if you look at couples\ncounseling\nmen actually are reluctant to engage in\ncouples counseling\nbecause they feel disadvantaged because\nit's a territory that they don't know\nhow to play that game\nwhat do you think about that\ni don't know hadn't thought of that\nbefore\nyeah it's kind of interesting didn't\nknow it was studying like that\nyeah it would you feel\nuncomfortable doing something like\nfamily counseling or couples counseling\nno why not\nbecause there's value in it\nin making the family life better\nokay so i completely agree that you\nwould be willing to do it and that you\nwould be gung-ho\nwhat i'm asking you is would you feel\nuncomfortable\nsure right so like this is i think\nsomething dave that i would really\nencourage you to tunnel down and and\nbecause i noticed that\nyou can feel a particular way and you're\nvery good at actually mastering your\nfeelings\nbut just because you can control your\ndiscomfort or compensate for it\ndoesn't mean that the discomfort isn't\nthere\ndoes that make sense yeah do you think\nthere's\nvalue in understanding that the\ndiscomfort is there and where it comes\nfrom\nyes why\nin order to you have to understand the\nroot\nof that discomfort before you can do any\nsort of\ncorrection okay\nso can we play with live ammo\nwith that principle can i ask you a\nquestion that may be a little bit\nevoke some emotion\nsure are you feeling uncomfortable\nas i already up what are the questions\ngonna be\ni know right so so let's so we're\nalready playing with live ammo that was\nthe question\nthat was it there's another one but so\nlike when i asked that question now how\ndo you feel close your eyes\nwhat do you feel in your body now that i\nput you on the spot\na little discomfort where\num you're getting personal\nyeah there's viewers online here yep so\nwhen someone\nengages you personally what do you feel\nprotective and what are you protecting\nuh i guess weaknesses\nokay and which weaknesses are you\nprotecting\nparticular ones\ni think it's that i tend to be more\nprivate so now i'm opening the door and\nrevealing\nmore so of who i am\nin inside versus what is the appearance\non the outside\nokay so\nwe can talk about that's a topic i think\nfor a different day about\nyou know thinking about i would\nencourage you to think about you know is\nit okay for other people to see what's\non the inside\nbecause i imagine that you were taught\nthat the answer to that question is no\ni think you have your own independent\nanswers\nbut i would hypothesize that you were\nconditioned to not\nshow people and i would also hypothesize\nthat that has something to do with the\nway that your parents were\nwhat do you think about that i think\nit's a little both\nmy parents i think\nwere um between this themselves\nwere open\noutside of the household they'll say not\nso much they're more\nprivate um myself\nsome of that some of myself\nis acquired from my upbringing\nand some of it is by on personal\nexperience\nin that if i have uh\nopened up um\n[Music]\ni've been burned so\nagain going back to protection\nand um it's\nit's a protection i guess on how much\nyou reveal\nor what you review okay\nokay and i'll say there's value in doing\nthat\npersonally for me being able to trust\nsomeone and to communicate\nuh what's what's going on inside but\nthen also\ni think there's value if somebody can\nbenefit from that or benefit from my\nexperience\nmaybe however private it might be\nthere's value in that to help someone\nelse out\nsure so um dave i\ni want to maybe ask you just a couple\nmore questions and then we can get you\nand zach\non together is that okay sure so\num you mentioned earlier uh and i\nnoticed a little bit of negative emotion\naround this that you know you you guys\nhave come really a long way with carson\nbut that sometimes at the cost\nof zach you use the word sacrifice\ncan you help me understand that a little\nbit better\nwhen carson would have his meltdowns\nwhen he was young and\neven now um obviously it's a major\ndistraction\nan interruption\nand especially if there's already\nsome sort of interaction with zach\nand there's a rhythm going and out of\nthe blue you get a\ninterruption from carson it\nunfortunately takes time away from zach\nand i think that has been the case\nat with him growing up that carson is\nalways\ndistracted and uh\ninterfered with the relationship\ndevelopment with zach\nit's just my observation how do you feel\nabout that\num it's lost time\nit's lost time that can never get back\nand those uh\nthose younger years that i i think\nof from 4 to 10 somewhere there where\nthey start to become independent\nstart to develop their own character and\nwho they're going to be those are\nprecious years\nthey go so stinking fast\nand can't get back the lost time\nand uh\nit hurts\nwhat hurts about it\nthat i think that could have\nuh jeopardize the relationship that we\nmaybe have today\nand um\nif he was in need for any kind of\nemotional support he couldn't get it\nbecause\nthere's a distraction going on with\ncarson\nand there is some guilt there\nand\nyou know missed out on that opportunity\nto really bond\nin those early years like that because\nthey're precious moments and you realize\nthat obviously as you get older\nand you look back those are just\nprecious years\nthat you and you can't get those any\nother way\nonly only with a a parent-child\nrelationship like that you can't get\nthat kind of uh\nfulfillment any other way\nand are you talking about fulfillment\nfor you or fulfillment for zach\nboth\nhave you guys ever talked about this\nvery lightly that i recall\nonce okay\nand um\ni think it's possible that\neither of us really didn't know how to\nintroduce it or how to even\nstart that discussion\num thank you for sharing that i can see\nthat it was emotional for you it was\nemotional for me too\num how do you feel about\nyou know do you feel okay right now can\nwe keep talking\nsure i'm good um\nso how's your relationship with zach now\nsounds like a good idea i think i'm\ngoing to hydrate too yeah\num\nnon non-combative not confrontational\nand pretty much we only see each other\nsince kovid that i've been working at\nhome might see him in the morning\nin the kitchen when i take a break and\nthen see them at dinner\nand we converse and talk pretty much\nwhatever's going on in the news\nand it's very brief and that's it\nand most of this time is in the basement\nuh in his room uh assuming\nuh gaming um\nand that's really the extent of it okay\nhow do you feel about that\nagain it goes back to the relationship\nuh i don't\nthink that's healthy\nwe're both missing out on time\ntime is ticking away and it's a valuable\nopportunity\nthat we're all in the same household\nand he's back from school that we could\nattempt to bond\nestablish a friendship\nand help even as\na him part of the team helping with\ncarson as well\ndo you feel like he doesn't help with\ncarson\nhe's attempted he's tried i think\num it's a it's a bit difficult for him i\nthink\nuh emotionally i think also he may not\nfully have the tool set the skill set of\nhow to\nwork with carson because he has been\naway at school\nessentially for five years\nand uh it's a long time yeah\nand the only time you saw him was when\nhe came home with you know holidays and\nstuff like that and so it's very brief\nand\nhe may not fully understand how carson\nworks or how he ticks now and\num how do you\nhow do you help him and i think one way\nis\ntry to become a friend with carson try\nto\nunderstand um\nwhat's going on in his mind what his\nfrustrations are\nsure so dave i'm gonna\nwe're gonna get zach back in here in a\nminute um because we've been talking for\na little while and i think this kind of\nstuff can be kind of\nenergy intensive and i don't know that\nyou've got a whole lot of excess fuel to\nburn\nwell i'm good okay\nuh but my you know is it okay if i share\na couple of thoughts with you\nsure so first thing is that i i don't\nthink that like\nthis is about carson yet so i know that\ncarson is a huge part of y'all's life\nand\nand you know dominates a lot of what\ny'all spend your time\nworking on thinking on enjoying\num and my first thought is that\nthat at least between you and zach the\nfirst thing that needs to happen is that\nlike you all need to form a relationship\nindependent of anyone else in your\nfamily\nright like like if i had to sum it up\nyou have to make up for lost time\nright and so what do you think about\nthat\nfully agree um\nit's it's a little difficult right now\nbecause\nwe're not communicating\nto understand where he is right now\nafter returning from school\num obviously he's\nfunding relief through gaming\num there's certainly everybody has their\nown way of dealing with stress and\nand relief some you know maybe physical\nexercise or whatever\nbut uh that tends to be his relief\nand um i think\nwe we just want to make sure that we\ndon't\npush him too hard because we\nwe don't fully understand what he's\ngoing through emotionally\nand mentally and uh so it's\nkind of kid gloves and trying to\nunderstand\nwould like to understand the emotions\nwhat he's going through\nand what he is thinking about for the\nway ahead\nokay so\ndave a couple of thoughts the first\nthing is\nyou know i want to respect your privacy\nespecially as you've gotten burned\nbefore so we have an option\na couple of options one is that you know\nwe can just get zach back in here\nwe can sort of kind of sum up it'll be\nkind of\nkid gloves i'll hear a couple of general\nthoughts\nand then leave the two of you to start\nthat discussion\nor whatever kind of on your own in\nprivate\nokay um upsides of that it's safe\ndownsides of that you may quickly fall\ninto a pattern where it's hard to get\nover that activation energy of having\nthose kinds of conversations\noption two is that we can think about\nstarting that conversation like now\num and problems with that is that\nsometimes it could get emotional\nit could feel voyeuristic because people\nare\nwatching and i don't want to pressure\nyou into you know anything that you\ndon't feel comfortable with\nupside is that i think that you've\nyou've said a couple of things to me\ntoday that while they're hot and fresh\nin your mind would be very valuable for\nzach to hear\nso i leave it up to you we're gonna go\nyou want to have the conversation with\nhim now\nor do you want to just have a general\nkind of sum up\ni would like to get his input but\nuh i think option one the general sum up\nand then he and i embark on\na private conversation okay can i share\nwith you one or two things that i think\nit's important for\nyou to say to him sure\num at the top of the list is i think\nlike you shared about\nlost time i think that's something that\nzach needs to hear from you\ngood um does that make sense to you\nyes what makes sense about that\nhe understands where i'm coming from and\nand sort of the reason to try to\nreestablish that relationship\ni think it's even more it's run simpler\nthan that\ni think he needs to understand that the\nfact that y'all lost\ntime hurts you\nwhat do you think about that\nyes he he needs to understand that\nand and i think this is the tricky thing\nright is like i don't think\nanyone would say that you did anything\nwrong\nand that's important for you to\nunderstand and that's important for him\nto understand\nand yet this kind of goes back to like\nwhat is the value of negativity if it\nleads to like you know\nit's just i think he needs to see\nthat you recognize that y'all were dealt\na bad hand\nbecause eight-year-old zach\nnine-year-old zack and ten-year-old zach\ndidn't couldn't understand that\nbut now he's a grown he's a grown man\nand i think that he also feels the lack\nof y'all's relationship\nand i think the the way to really start\nbridging that gap is like\nto talk about what you know what what it\nwas like\nand and i i don't know and here's the\nother last thing that i'll tell you dave\nis that i think you\nuh do an excellent job of trying to\nunderstand\neverything outside of yourself so even\nwhen you talk about zach and you think\nabout your interactions with him you say\ni need to understand him better the\nother thing that i would encourage you\nto do\nis let other people understand you\nyou don't always have to be the\nunderstander\nand let zach let him see who you are\nbecause it i i it seems to me like\nyou've raised\ntwo amazing sons and you can start to\nlean on them\ntoo i know it sounds weird\nbut you know i i think the conversation\nisn't just about understanding him in a\nweird way like you almost have to model\nopening up because he's more likely to\nopen up if you open up\nif somebody's got the first move\nand i i don't i don't know\nand here's why i think i don't know that\nit should be you\nbut the reason that i am defaulting to\nyou making the first move\nis because out of all of the\nconversations i've had with him and you\nyou're the one\nwho i think has said the words that are\nthe most important to say\nand that's why i think you should say\nthem it's not about first it's just\nyou have the most important thing to say\nyeah thoughts questions\nso the first one you mentioned was lost\ntime\nwas there a second nope that i missed\nokay\ni mean i think that's that's a great\nplace to start right and thinking about\ny'all's relationship\nand and what that kind of looks like and\nfeels like to you guys now\ni think the second point for you is that\ni think understanding what you're\nfeeling\nand also communicating that to zach\ncould be healthy for both of you\nand i think will pave the way for him to\ndo the same\nthird thing is anyway the rest we can\ntalk about together you feel\nokay grabbing him yeah okay we'll go get\nyep i know everybody wants them to talk\non stream\nbut that's for us right that's not for\nthem\nso i don't doubt that that would get\nclipped and shipped\nbut that's not what we're here for\noh all right\nright can we get both the perfect okay\nso zack yeah i talked to your dad for a\nlittle bit longer than i talked to you\ndid you i think so not sure\num what were you concerned at all about\nwhat we were talking about or were you\nthinking about it at all\nwell i was talking to my mom about it\nbut we ended up getting sidetracked from\nother discussions\nokay um zach do you want to summarize\nuh kind of our conversation for your dad\nand then we'll have your dad kind of\nsummarize\nwhat we talked about how does that sound\nstart\nsure so go for it\noh yeah i thought you said you're okay\nnope you're gonna have to\njust let me think here um\nuh we kind of all over the place aren't\nwe\nwe started by talking about the a\nconversation that i had with mom\nearlier was this was like a half a week\nago um\nwhich was about uh like the situation\nwith carson\num and his autism and\nhow they're infecting um\nstuff like a lot of times spent on\nthe situation with the window cleaners\nand so like\nhow she convey to me her perspective of\nthat situation\nand what my perspective that situation\nwas as well\nand how like there was a whole bunch of\ncrazy stuff going on\nyou know and how carson\n[Music]\nwas obviously difficult and whatnot but\nthen also how you\nplay into that and how mom plays into\nthat and how um\neveryone just sort of like beats on each\nother right\nlike carson will have his pattern and\nthen\nyou will have your set rules or whatever\nthat you have to follow and then mom\nwill try to enforce those but then\ncarson will fight get back against that\nand then other people fight each other\nand that i'm just trying to like sit on\nthe sidelines and not get involved and\nlike hype myself right\nbecause i don't want to be part of any\nof that um\nwhat else did we talk about\ni don't remember i can i can kind of\njump in\num thanks thanks for sharing that zach\nso a couple of other things\nuh dave that we talked about are a\nlittle bit about y'all's\ninterpersonal interactions and um\nzach has the impression that you're\nquite organized and quite structured\nand i'd actually hypothesized to zach\nthat maybe if you\nfeel uncomfortable or anxious or\nstressed\nthat the way that you resp the way that\nyou manage that stress\nis by import imposing order around you\nbecause that may help you you know like\nthe more chaotic things become the more\nyou kind of double down on imposing\norder and structure\num we\nuh also talked a little bit about\ny'all's relationship\nand and zach mentioned to me that you\nknow he feels a little bit closer\nto your wife and that they're able to\ntalk a little bit more freely\num and that he does want to be able to\nkind of talk to you maybe\nsomewhat in the same way i mean i think\nhe acknowledges that you all are\ndifferent and that you\ndon't have to have the same relationship\num but that\ncommunicating and better understanding\nbetween the two of you is actually\nreally important\nwe spent a fair amount of time talking\nabout carson\num you know y'all's family situation uh\nthe challenges that y'all face\num and and kind of gave me a lot of\nbackground\nshared a couple of stories but i think\nthat basically oh the other thing\ninteresting thing that he said is that\nhe actually knows very little about like\nwhat your life growing up was like and\nand he actually doesn't know too much\nabout\nyou um and maybe he was a little bit\ncurious about that\nsometimes uh it it seems like um\neither he or your wife may feel like\nthey they're kind of walking on\neggshells around you\nthat they're afraid that they may upset\nyou if they say or do the wrong thing\num and i'm just sharing this stuff with\nyou not to kind of put you on the spot\nor try to get you to defend yourself or\nanything like that\ni don't think it's like either or i\ndon't think someone is right or someone\nis wrong\ni'm just sharing with you what their\npers what his perception is\nand how he feels\nany thoughts questions responses\noh i understand uh i've heard\nthose comments before\nand um i do remember\nzach one time expressing that he didn't\nknow much about me or my childhood\nthat's fair um\nyet on the other hand\nfor example i think the time that\nactually occurred was we were sitting\naround a campfire\nand that would have been an opportune\ntime\nto ask questions\ntry to understand what was your\nchildhood like\ndid i do growing up and the\nthe fun times the challenging times\nand experiences sure sure so\nuh it's a little bit of both i didn't\ndivulge to him\nnor did he inquire sure so what i'm\nhearing from you is that it's a two-way\nstreet\nyes absolutely that's fair\nall right sure um\nuh dave do you want to sum up uh or or\nkind of\nshare what we talked about with zach\nyeah it seemed to pretty quickly\nhead down to carson\nin the center of the discussion pretty\nmuch\nand the family dynamics and uh his uh\nimpact on the family and\nhow that i think\nimpacted our relationship when you were\nyounger\nsomewhere around that four to ten year\nperiod\nwhere uh to me those are very precious\nyears\nas you start to develop your character\nand and your identity and who you're\ngoing to be\nand uh those are very precious years\nin my view of establishing the\nrelationship\nand bonding and\ni sensed that carson was a distraction\nduring that time\nwhere we could not\nestablish that relationship and do\nthings together\ndo the the boy stuff the manly stuff\nand uh as a result that's\nuh i think contributed to sort of the\nrelationship we have today where it's\nnot as\nclose as it should be\ni saw you reacting\ndave i thought that was going to be a\nprivate conversation\noh the details\nokay so if that's option two if we've\nalready opened the door\nif you want to continue i mean i didn't\nopen any doors bro\ni i was okay\nno i didn't cut off i just stopped\ntalking okay\ni just couldn't okay\nso now i'm a little bit confused because\ni don't know what to do um\nso okay i guess we're talking about it\nnow\nso zack um what did you hear from your\ndad\ni'm already blind okay\nso think for a second what what did he\nsay sorry for derailing both y'all i was\ncaught off guard\nyeah now i'm caught off guard um\nso like first of all two-way street i\nremember that\nthen he said that you guys started\ntalking about cars oh yeah\nhow like the the early years\nare important or whatever for like\ndeveloping your identity and stuff which\nis actually something that i kind of\ndisagree with\ni think that even still now i'm kind of\nstruggling with my identity and whatnot\nand that's something that you got your\nwhole life but that's a different\nconversation\num yeah carson i don't know if he was\nnecessarily a distraction per se\num i just think that as a family we\nstruggled to\nhandle him we didn't know what we were\ndoing there was no guidebook how to have\nan autistic child in your family and\nnot screw up family-week relationships\nbecause of it right\nit's gonna cause strains and it's hard\nto know how to handle that and so i\nthink that\nit wasn't it was it was just really hard\nfor us all to handle that we were all\nspending so much time on him\nthat we couldn't spend time on each\nother because we didn't know what we\nwere doing\nyeah and then like i now remember when i\nwas talking to you how\ni say that it was difficult for me to\nconnect with carson because\ni mean again i didn't know what i was\ndoing um\ni felt like i was just in general being\nan [ __ ] to him because\nso zach i'm gonna just interrupt you\nyeah i apologize\nso dave so i think zach\nwhat did you hear how would you describe\nwhat zach heard\num\n[Music]\nmaybe missed the mark that it was lost\ntime\nyep and he didn't miss the mark i think\nyou guys did what y'all do\nwhich is you guys talk about situations\nright so he understood that you were\nsaying that like\nyou know there's character development\nbecause you don't say\nyou leave out y'all\ny'all eat brisket oh yeah\nso like you know when you slice into\nbrisket\nand that juice is in the middle and it's\nlike when you get a well-cooked brisket\nand it falls apart but it's like moist\nand juicy\nyeah you left out the juice dave\nright you talk you gave him the\nstructure\nbut what you said just now is very\ndifferent from what you conveyed to me\ndoes that make sense to you\nthe words are the same\nright i guess i miss i understand okay\nsorry\nso like you talked about lost time but\nwhen we were talking about it\nwhat were you feeling\nwhen you and i talked about it it was\nemotional\nyep and when you were telling it to zach\nwhat were you feeling\nit was emotional and\nnot to the extent when i was talking to\nyou yep\nright so like zach did you get any\nemotion from him\nwhen he said that uh a little bit at the\nstart but knows about it\nyep and i think this is what what you\nall do which is normal by the way\nis that like you know you're conveying\nthe words but i i think\num if if you're okay dave i'm gonna push\nyou is that okay because i mean you open\nthe door but we can just stop\nsure so how do you feel\nso first of all let's be explicit like\nwhat do you what does lost time mean to\nyou\nin relation to zach\nthose are years of\nchildhood that are valuable as i\nmentioned\nand you can never get them back and\nthose years\nthose those precious years of four to\nten roughly\nwhen when you're a child like that\nand everything's happy go lucky\num no no worries in the world\nno stresses or your mind is not polluted\nyet\nfrom the environment those\nyears of dad and child\ndevelopment can never get\nget those back again okay so you talk\nabout dad and child\nso what i'm hearing you say is that\nthere\nare times of zack's life that because\nof carson's needs you were not able to\ngive him\nwhat you really wanted to yes\nis that fair yeah and i'll also add in\nthere too\nthat it isn't a blame or\nall on carson i was still\npursuing a career at the same time\nand very demanding and so\nagain trying to stay balanced personally\nand with the family was extremely\nchallenging\nand uh carson was a heavy weight\non that scale and who paid the price of\nthat weight\nwe all did but uh certainly zach\ni think payday price\nokay zach what's it like to hear that\ni don't know it's\nit's so weird because like i can't\nremember that much\nof that period of my life right and i've\nbeen spending so much of my time\nrecently speaking thinking about like\nrecent times and trying to like help\nmyself right now with the future and\nwhatnot\num\nso it's like it's hard to wrap my head\naround the perspective honestly\nyeah i don't know i don't really yeah\ni don't really know what i'm doing so\ni'm gonna try to translate for dave\nokay dave is that okay i'm gonna take\nthe spotlight off of you is that cool\nsure so zach i think what i understood\nand this is the advantage of streaming\nthis to the internet is now\nyou can go back and watch it um but\ni think what i heard from your dad uh\nand what i felt very palpably is that\nlike\nlike we have to be careful because it's\nnot about blame\nbut what i really felt from him was that\nhe actually mourns\nthe lack of time that\nhe's been he he mourns the amount of\ntime that he hasn't been able to give\nyou\nand we're not saying that he acted\nwrongly\nwe're not saying that he's to blame\nwe're not saying that carson's to blame\nit's just the reality of y'all's\nhousehold and that's\ntough right no one's to blame\nand yet he really wishes that he could\nhave had\nand i know you don't remember those\nyears but i have i have an almost\nfive-year-old so i kind of know a little\nbit about what dave's talking about\nand and there is something incredibly\nprecious and valuable\nabout bonding and forming a relationship\nand that time just doesn't come back\nand um what i i think what really\nmaybe what dave is trying to say is that\nyou know just that\nthat he feels hurt by not being able to\ngive you\nin a sense what he feels like you\ndeserve\nhow's that dave good summary\nhard for dave to say how does it make\nyou feel to hear that from me\ncan can you try tell it'd probably be\nbetter if you actually do you feel\ncomfortable saying\nsomething like that directly to zach\noh yeah sure i feel comfortable doing\nthat can you all look at each other\nbecause it's [ __ ] i feel\ni don't know what it's [ __ ] weird\napologies for the language\nwhen i was interested\nin having the family i was really\ninterested in bonding with a young\ninnocent child and growing up with that\nchild\nand doing cool stuff together and we we\ndid have some moments\nwhere we've been camping and fishing and\nskied like crazy\nbut there were always\ndistractions distractions of carson is\none\nand certainly a distraction to the\nstress of my my job and\nwhat i was pursuing in a career and\nit was a distraction to me mentally and\nit didn't allow us i think to fully\ndevelop\na relationship when you're younger that\ncould continue on\nin your adult life and particularly now\nwhen you like you mentioned trying to\nunderstand your identity now\nthat i could be there along with your\nmom\nand uh help you through the the trial\nyou're going through now\nis you can't explain it you can only\nexperience it but being a parent\nit's a real tough balancing act\nwhen you're trying to be a provider\nemotionally\nfinancially um and to provide for your\nfamily\npursue a career have time to spend with\nyour wife\nand spend time with your kids and yet\nhave\nsome alone time to do things you like to\ndo if you want to go to the gym or go\nrun or whatever but try to balance\nall these demands in life and then\nyou have a special needs child thrown\ninto the equation\nmakes it even more difficult there's no\nmanual there's no training\nto help young parents\nmanage a family like that and uh\nthat's one thing i think lacking in our\nsociety and our school system\nis how do you have\na functional family\nhow do you teach kids to raise kids\nbecome parents and how to balance\ntheir life and to be\nsuccessful with a parent parenting\nwe don't teach that in school and\nthere's no manual that comes with each\nkid because every kid is unique\nwired completely different and\nwe learned by the seat of our pants or\nby our parents or by our\nfriends\nzach what was that like to listen to\nuh i don't know\nit was emotional parts right um\nso your dad did something where he went\nunderwater\nfelt those emotions and then suddenly\nnow we're talking about\nhow people need a manual for child race\nrearing\nyeah and so dave i think your mind does\nsomething where\nwhen you feel emotions the engineering\nbrain turns on and you start talking\nabout abstract problem-solving kinds of\nthings because it's hard for you to just\nhit the pause button when you're\nconveying\nto zach how you feel which is okay\nright so that's a skill that you'll need\nto learn it may be\nsort of an excuse is in that\num i did the best i could yep there's no\ndaniel to tell me\nyou know how to raise him or how to\nspend time with\nenjoying them and so uh\nit's just trying to articulate that\nevery kid is unique and how you raise\nthem or how you\nestablish relationships is they're all\ndifferent\nokay yeah i think it's everything you\nsaid is spot on man\num zach you look like you're kind of\nprocessing\nanything that you want to share with\nyour dad i mean you don't have to share\nanything by the way\nand dave you were supposed to have this\nconversation in private but i'm sort of\nglad you had it in public because i\ndon't i don't know if\nyou would have come across the right way\nyeah\nyou don't have to say anything if you\nwant to just process\ni mean the only thought that's coming to\nmind is that like\nyeah it\nyou generally do not get emotional\npractice\nand a lot of like\nthat's an observation not a blame dave\nyeah\nyeah a lot of communication becomes\neasier when you're able to\nconvey those things like when i was able\nto\nconnect with mom really well when she\nwas able to explain how she felt\nto me and i think that part of why\ni've been able to get close to her is\nmore so is because of that right like\nour relationship has always been about\ni don't know how to explain it like\nthings right like it's\nit's been we're gonna go skiing and\nwe're gonna go ride atvs or\nwe're gonna work on this thing together\nor teaching it's been\nso much more like\ni guess literal i don't know how to\nexplain it or if there's words for that\nbut\nyeah i understand that emotional\nconnection has\nnever really been there um it's yeah\nand i i don't even yeah i'm just sort of\nlike spilling thoughts right i'm not\ngoing somewhere i'm gonna jump in so\ndave\ni think you've got to be careful because\nyou can feel blame\nwhen he says something like that do you\nfeel blame\nit i'll say yes but i understand\nwhere he's coming from because yeah so\nthis once again is about\nyou can feel blame but not be at fault\nyeah right that's that's a big lesson\nhere is that what you feel on the inside\nso so here's what i'm gonna say to y'all\nokay and now we're gonna kind of wrap up\nif that's okay with you guys any\nquestions so okay so the first thing\nis that um zach\nso dave when you think about those\nformative years of four to ten\ni think you lucked out because what zack\nis telling you is that his formative\nyears aren't over yet\nand he still needs your help so i think\nsure you miss four to ten but he's as\nold as he is now and he's asking for you\nto help him figure that out\nand he's saying that you know it's not\ntoo late and that it's important that\neven if you guys have had trouble\nyou guys have always focused on things\nthat like now is your chance\num is that fair zach\nyeah let's see that's here the last\nthing\nthat i'll just say is covet is a can i\nare you all okay with bad language\nokay so then i'll avoid it sorry um\nyou know i'm i grew up in a culture of\nmoral decay dave\nso my my language is loose but\nbut covet is a mess and and it really\nputs a lot of pressures on on families\nand i i really hope that um\nyou know i think family counseling is is\ngonna be important for you guys but the\nmost important thing that i would say is\nthat both of you guys want the same\nthing\nwhich is a deeper relationship and a\nbetter understanding with each other\nand it's going to be hard and it's going\nto be confusing and all kinds of stuff\nis going to come up\nas you guys walk this journey but as\nlong as you guys walk it together\nand you all lean on each other y'all are\ngoing to be fine\nany last thoughts or questions\ni'll say one thing is\nand we need to understand zach\nbetter yep and that's one thing\nas he matured and entered adulthood\nhis interests became different than\nthan mine so\nthat was one area where we started to\nor he became more um isolated i guess\nfrom the family and his interests were\ndifferent for example gaming\nyou know yeah i've done some xbox games\na few times big deal\nuh i don't understand his perspective on\ngaming\nand the attraction with it and\nsatisfaction fulfillment with it\nand that's just one example of our\ndifferences\nunderstanding those and appreciating\nthose and respecting each other\nwith those different interests but yet\nhow can we find something in common\nand have that relationship with those\ndifferences\nsure so i i think these are ongoing\nconversations\nand i think at the end of the day\ndavid's you know my\nmy first instinct in response to that\nwould be that you know it is important\nfor you to understand gaming i think\nthat's a really important discussion\num for actually i think it's the most\nimportant discussion for our particular\ncommunity\nbecause parents don't understand and we\ndon't do a good job as kids\nexplaining it to our parents and it's a\ntwo-way street\nyeah i i would say at the end of the day\nthough understanding\ni think zach wants to understand you\nbetter as well\nand it's not so much about interest and\nstuff i i think sharing some of what you\ndid today and i i know zack has been\nworking through a lot of stuff and and\nzach hopefully you know you can you feel\ncomfortable enough to convey some of the\nthings that you're thinking through with\nyour parents and\nand what your motivations and thoughts\nare around some of that stuff\num but i think just keep communicating\nand hopefully all will get there\nthoughts on family counseling thing i\nthink you all should do family\ncounseling\nokay i i think it's nice to have someone\nto facilitate communication because it's\nhard\nright like like it's hard because i\nthink your dad had something really\nreally important to say\nand it took him a couple of tries to be\nable to say it in a way that you could\nhear\nso it's not just like he has to say it\nthe right way it's like\nabout the way that you're you're you\nhear things too\nand so sometimes you'll need a little\nbit of a nudge until you learn how to do\nit on your own\nsound good take care\nthank you you do strong work really\nstrong work today\nadios\nokay damn"
