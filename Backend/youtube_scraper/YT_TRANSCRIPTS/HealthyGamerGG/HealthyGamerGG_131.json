    "transcript": "so generally speaking we have this idea\nthat explanations justifications and\nreasons will allow other people to think\nthe better of us this is all driven by\nour insecurity so since I don't want to\nbe disliked I'm going to let this\ninsecurity create verbal diarrhea let's\nsay that I work for you and you're my\nboss and I come in and I'm late and I\nsay hey I'm sorry I was late today you\nacknowledge that you're late versus oh\nmy God I'm so sorry that late today my\ncar had this problem and then I had a\nflat tire and then my cat got sick and\nthen this person did this and then I got\na text message and then all this stuff\nfell apart and I'm so sorry I'm late\nwhich person do you think you will like\nmore and which one do you like less\ngenerally speaking when someone provides\na thousand different rationalizations or\njustifications it does not get received\nwell"
