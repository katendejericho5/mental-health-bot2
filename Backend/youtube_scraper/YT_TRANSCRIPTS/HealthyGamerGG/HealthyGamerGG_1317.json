    "transcript": "can you imagine if you couldn't even\ndecide which video game like you didn't\neven know like you've got some weird\nnebulous\nyou pay 2 000 a month\nand it's determined by your employer who\nthat money goes to\nand like the video game company can do\nlike like can you just imagine like i\ncan't even\nfigure out how to frame this if\nelectronic arts\ncould enter into an agreement with your\nemployer to determine\nhow much video games cost\nin which video games you play can you\nimagine how bad that system would be\nlike it would be a complete train wreck\noh my god this is gonna be so painful\nokay so do you guys know like how\namerican healthcare works like does\nanybody have any idea like what happens\nlike let's start with the basics okay\ninsurance great that's a great place to\nstart so we're going to start here okay\nso this is what happens so here's a\nperson\nokay here is their doctor\nand i can't really draw a stethoscope\nbut\nthat is a stethoscope okay and it seems\nto be\non top of their head so you know good\nluck with that to a chat\nbecause my drawing is terrible\nall right and then here's the insurance\ncompany\nso here's the first thing to understand\nso you know generally speaking what\nhappens\nis um you know\nwhen i want a good or a service i pay\nmoney\nand then i receive the good or service\nright like let's say that i walk into\nthe grocery store and i say i want to\nbuy an apple like i pick up an apple off\nthe shelf i go to the checkout counter\nand i say\ni would like to purchase this apple and\nthen the other person says\nokay the apple will cost you one dollar\nand i give them the dollar\nand then i receive the apple and then i\ntake a bite of the apple and i said the\napple is bad and then i go back and i\nsay hey this apple is mealy and it has a\nworm in it i would like my money back\nand then the person at the cash register\nsays i'm sorry all\nsales are final and we can't accept an\napple that has been bitten into\ngo screw yourself and then i feel\nfrustrated and i walk out and i decide\ni'm never going to purchase an apple\nfrom them again\nso that's good because there's like\nfeedback between\nlike my purchasing power can be\ncontrolled based on my preferences and\nexperiences\nso here's what happens in\nour health care system okay so\nwhat i purchased\ni give money to the insurance company\nokay and then i go and i get a service\nlet's call the service yellow from the\ndoctor\nand then what happens is the insurance\ncompany\npays the doctor for my service\nso the first thing is that this is like\na messed up system from feedback because\ni don't actually control like there's no\nlike generally speaking what we would\nwant in a perfect world\nis the money and the service to be\ndirectly related so i can like have\nfeedback\nbased on you know if i don't like the\ndoctor then i can go to a different one\nbut like that's not how it works\nso like here's practically what happens\nright so i go see my doctor\nyou guys have to understand that i'm\nbiased about this okay because i'm a\ndoctor so i\ni have a bias perspective so i go to my\ndoc\nlet's say i don't know if i'm the doctor\ni'm the whatever but so let's say that\nlike you know patient goes to their\ndoctor and the doctor says we think that\nyou need this medicine\nbecause i think this is what you need\nand then\nthe the patient then tries to get the\nmedicine\nbut their insurance company says we're\nnot going to pay for that medicine\nbecause this one is cheaper\nso it's kind of like if if you go to a\nstore and then you ask someone\nhey i want to barbecue tonight what do\nyou think i should get\nand then like the grill master at the\nstore or the butcher says we have a\nreally great this like i think this\nwould be really good and it will really\nbe what you need\nand then you kind of like say okay i\nwant to get like a a rack of baby wreck\nribs and then some other guy comes in\nand says\nyeah we're not gonna pay for the baby\nback ribs because\nyou know pig feet are cheaper and then\nyou're like\nbut the expert told me that i should get\nbaby rack ribs and then the\nthis other dude is like yeah man sorry\nlike we're not gonna pay for that\nbecause the pig feet we've done studies\nor we believe that like people who eat\npig feet are just as like healthy as\npeople eat baby back ribs it's all [ __ ]\nanyway it's all pork\nit's all unhealthy so we're not gonna\npay for the baby jack grips\nand that's really frustrating for me as\na physician because what the insurance\ncompany does is they're like basically\nlike\nthey're the ones with the money so it's\nkind of like it's kind of like you go to\nthe store with your mom\nand your mom is like you're like hey can\ni get this thing mom and you gave her\nyour allowance and she's hanging onto\nyour allowance\nand she's like no man like you can't get\nthat thing because i don't think it's a\ngood idea\nand it's expensive but you're like but\nit's my money and then your mom's like\nno but i'm like holding it for you so\ni'm gonna say no\nso the first thing that i find\nfrustrating about the the health care\nsystem is that\nyou know the insurance company actually\nhas a vested interest\nin taking as much money as they can from\nthe\nthe patient and then providing the least\namount of care possible because that's\nlike\ntheir incentive is not actually in\nhelping patients their incentive is in\ncharging\nas much as they can and then like\ndelivering as little health care as\npossible\nright so it's kind of like i mean a\nsimpler analogy is like you know\ni want to go and like i said i tell my\npatient hey i think you should like eat\nan apple every day\nand then they're like okay so can i have\nthe apple and the insurance company is\nlike nah man\nwe're gonna get you a sack of potatoes\nand then you're like but dude i want an\napple and they're like no we think like\npotatoes like if you look at the calorie\nnutrition information apples are 100\ncalories of potatoes 100 calories so\nwe're going to give you potatoes\nand then as a physician what i have to\ndo because what happens is because\npotatoes are cheaper right\nso like even though the apple is better\nfor the person than a potato because\npotatoes have no vitamin c and they have\nscurvy so i'm like you should really eat\nan apple\nthen what i have to do as a physician is\ni have to send a form the insurance\ncompany says oh you can get an apple\nabsolutely we wouldn't want to deny you\nan apple all you have to do is send us a\nform\nyou have to fill out this one two-page\nform about why the patient needs an\napple\nand then we'll give them the app and so\nessentially what they do is they they\ncreate an administrative burden\nfor like doctors to give medicine to\ntheir patients that their patients need\nand so then what happens is like doctors\nlike it's very frustrating to fill out\nforms and i have to fill out forms for\nall of my patients\nand so then what happens is like they\nbasically have they hire someone\nso instead of paying for the apple what\nthey do is they hire someone\nto review all these applications and\nthen make judgments about whether\nthey're going to pay for it or not\ndepending on the clinical information so\nit makes sense but then what happens\nis like there's they hire someone to\nessentially like block\nthe apple and basically pay less money\nand they make it really hard for\npatients to get care and then what\nhappens\nby healthcare providers is we realize as\ndoctors like i don't have two hours a\nday just\nto fill out forms and fax them to the\ninsurance company so i\ni hire someone to do that process for me\nso essentially what's happened\nis that like the patient is still\ngetting the medicine at the end of the\nday they're still getting the apple\nbut what's happened is we've increased\ncosts on the insurance side\nbecause they have someone who's blocking\nthe apple and we've increased\ncosts on this side because i've hired\nsomeone to make sure that that\nthat they don't block it so we both\nhired an additional person to get the\nperson the apple\nso now we've just increased\ncost just across the board we've\nincreased costs\nso the patient actually has to increase\ntheir premium\nright so now i have to build a patient\nmore\nso this number goes up this number\ngoes up because of this and this\nwith no improvement in care\nso one person says creating jobs fine\nso that's the first thing okay so then\nso like this is just super messed up\nbecause like it you know the insurance\ncom\nlike and actually there are some good\nreasons for this so the counterpoint to\nthis is that oftentimes doctors will do\nthings\nso doctors have a financial incentive to\ndeliver the most expensive care to\npatients\num and this actually gets worsened by\nthe insurance company because\nwhat then everyone thinks is like if i'm\nnot billing the patient directly if the\ninsurance company is paying for it\ni might as well do the most expensive\n[ __ ] so like if i can get away with ct\nso let's say a ct costs about\n200 let's say an mri costs about 900\nand if i'm billing insurance for it and\ni get paid 900\nor like let's say that my profit here is\n300\nand my profit here is 100 if i'm a\nphysician\nit's my incentive to order as many mris\nas i can as opposed to ct scans\nbecause i make money more money with\nmris\nright so a ct scan is a cat scan and an\nmri is a\nmagnetic resonance imaging there are two\nkinds of imaging\ntechniques now the interesting thing is\nthat if i was billing the patient\ndirectly\ni would actually like consider that\nright so doctors do do that because like\nif i have a patient who's broke i'm not\ngoing to charge him like 900\nto go bankrupt because that's just not\ngenerally speaking how the people in my\nprofession work like if you've got a\ncustomer\nand they can't afford something you're\ngoing to try to like keep that customer\nhappy by doing like whatever you can get\naway with\nright so i i very much consider my my\npatients financial needs\nin terms of trying to come up with like\nprescription plans and stuff like that\nwe try to\nyou know help people out with that and\nthat sort of makes sense like if you go\nto a store\nand you have like a relationship with\nthat business and the business is gonna\ntry to sometimes sell you the platinum\nthing but if they can't sell you the\nplatinum thing they're going to like\ntry to at least sell you silver\nso i don't know if people can agree or\ndisagree with that but you know\ndoctors definitely have or health care\nsystems definitely have a financial\nincentive to order more tests\nand the problem is that like with the\ninsurance premium\nthis guy's money essentially stays the\nsame\nright like whether i uh do an mri or ct\nscan\nthey just pay a co-pay and the cost that\nactually gets increased here\nis the insurance companies\nso that actually goes up if i choose an\nmri over ct\nso then what happens is doctors are like\nokay like the patient is paying the\npremium anyway\nthe premium is fixed so we might as well\norder as much [ __ ] as we can because\nlike\nthey're not paying for it i'm not going\nto screw the patient it'll be good for\nthem\ni don't have to worry about costs\nbecause the insurance company greedy ass\ninsurance companies are taking the money\nanyway so we might as well like order\nthe most expensive ship\nand that sort of makes sense right but\nat the same time it actually still\nincreases costs for the whole system and\nthen this\ncost gets passed back to him in terms of\nincreased premium\nbecause the insurance company ain't\ngoing to go out of business so they're\nlike okay if the the doctor's billing\nall this crap\none thing that we can do is we can go\nback to the prior auth\nso if you want an mri instead of a ct\nscan\nyou have to send us additional paperwork\nand then i'm like okay that's fine\ni'm gonna hire another person to make\nsure that all the prior authors go\nthrough\nso now we've sort of increased\nyes screwed up incentives all around\nokay\nso yeah i mean the mri can be in the\nthird party that's fine\nbut the point is that the doctor if the\npatient isn't gonna have to pay for it\nthe doctor is gonna uh\nuh actually a doctor can't order an mri\ni mean they can't profit from an mri\ntechnically\num so like when i order tests for my\npatients i don't\ni don't make any money off of them so\nbut i i still really don't give a [ __ ]\nbecause the insurance company is going\nto pay for it so i'm like you guys are\npaying the premiums anyway so like you\nmight as well get the best healthcare\nyou can\nmy point is that like all the costs like\nend up so i don't know if you guys get\nthis but all the costs are like landing\non this dude\npoor guy okay so i mean this is even\ngetting worse\nit's gonna get worse okay so\nthen the problem is that like health\ninsurance is so expensive\nthat do you guys know who pays for most\nhealth insurance in this country who\ndecides\nhow do humans get how do people in their\nhow does the average american get their\nhealth insurance\nemployers right so now oh man things are\nabout to get wild\nokay so now we see a third problem this\nis just gonna\nget worse because the the patient\ndoesn't even have control over which\ninsurance company they use\nthat's determined by this guy\nright so it's like if if the patient\nsays i don't\nlike how much you charge me for my\npremium or i don't like\nthat you're not paying for this\ntreatment that my doctor recommends\nthe patient can't even switch insurance\ncompanies\nthey have no recourse there's no sense\nof feedback\nin terms of choice within the health\ncare market\nso i don't know if you guys get this but\nwhen you don't have a choice\nin a market then you're screwed\nright so like like right now i mean\npeople talk about how predatory video\ngame\nproviders are and i think that video\ngame providers are like\nthey're like kindergarten compared to\nlike the nba when it comes to like\nhealth insurance companies\nbecause at the end of the day you still\nget to decide which video games you\npurchase\nand that choice about how much you spend\non skins or microtransactions or games\nempowers you a lot and keeps costs low\ncan you imagine if you couldn't even\ndecide which video game like you didn't\neven know\nlike you've got some weird nebulous you\npay two thousand dollars a month\nand it's determined by your employer who\nthat money goes to\nand like the video game company can do\nlike like can you just imagine like i\ncan't even\nfigure out how to frame this if\nelectronic arts\ncould enter into an agreement with your\nemployer to determine\nhow much video games cost\nin which video games you play can you\nimagine how bad that system would be\nlike it would be a complete train wreck\nand so now now let's think about the\nemployer's incentives okay\nso what are the employers incentives\nthere is no tldr the whole reason this\nis a dlc\nor the tl dr is the system is [ __ ]\nbut no no so their their incentive is\nnot to hire healthy people\nright so the insurance company wants as\nmany healthy people as it can get\nfor as high of a premium it can get\nso yeah absolutely so people are saying\nworst cheapest plan possible so the\nworst\ncheapest plan possible to get the\nemployees that they want\nright so now what they're doing is they\nkind of like\nthey figure out like okay so we're gonna\ntry to\ngive the insurance company\na tiny dollar sign and we don't want to\ngive them a big dollar sign we want to\npay them as little as possible\nbut there's something that's really\nbizarre which is that since the employer\nhas\n500 customers\nright because they have 500 employees\nthey actually get a better rate from the\ninsurance company because they're buying\nin bulk\nso that actually keeps costs down the\nproblem\nis that when if you try to buy insurance\ndirectly from it\nfrom an insurance company you get no\nbulk discount\nso what this means is that you have to\nget insurance through your employer\nbecause it's going to cost twice as much\nso i'll give you guys an actual number\nokay\ni pay about 2 800 a month for my\nfamily's health insurance\nfor the same plan that is not through my\nemployer i can't even get the same plan\nfor a plan that is worse than the plan\nthat i have right now\nif i buy it directly from the insurance\ncompany\nit cost me four thousand five hundred\ndollars\nyeah i'm buying family health insurance\nso family health insurance is\nexpensive four thousand five hundred\ndollars a month\nright absolutely 50k\nin insurance premiums so then what\nhappens is they're all these kinds of\nweird like things because the employer\nsort of\nkind of doesn't give a [ __ ] right so\nthey come up with all these weird like\nplans and i don't know if you guys\nunderstand this but the more complicated\na financial instrument is\nthe more you're getting screwed so like\ninsurance plans\nhave different ways of screwing you okay\nso let's just think about a premium\na deductible\na copay like do you guys see like\nthey're gonna [ __ ] you with each of\nthese the premium is\namount okay so this is\n[Music]\ndollars you pay per month\nthis is dollars you pay\nbefore they\npay anything\nthis is dollars you pay\nno matter what\nand then you have maximum\ndollars okay\nthis is max\ndollars they pay\nafter which\nyou pay everything\nokay this doesn't even\nthis doesn't include pre-existing\nconditions so like you guys see how\ncomplicated this is like\nthis isn't an apple okay so like let's\nlet's use this in the grocery store\nanalogy\nso in order to shop at our grocery store\nyou need to pay us a hundred bucks a\nmonth\nthe thing is if you shop at our grocery\nstore we'll pay for your fruit\nyou have to pay us 100 monthly fee okay\ngreat\nbut there's a deductible how much is the\ndeductible it's 500\nso we're gonna pay for all of your fruit\nafter you spend five hundred dollars\nhere\nand you have to pay us a hundred dollars\na month anyway\nokay fine even then when you when you\ncome in\nafter spending the first five hundred\ndollars of fruit and you're paying us a\nhundred bucks\nuh you have to pay up you're paying me a\nhundred dollars\nand then you still have to pay the\ngrocery store five hundred dollars\nbefore we'll pay the grocery store\nanything\nafter you pay the grocery store five\nhundred when you go buy an apple you\nhave to pay a copay\nso we're gonna when you buy an apple\nwe're gonna pay 80 cents and you're\ngoing to pay 20 cents but the first 500\nbucks you have to pay all of it yourself\nand then if you buy a thousand dollars\nworth of fruit above that we're not\ngoing to pay anything\nso like that's just\nlike bizarre like there's so many\nvariables in that equation\nand then what happens is like it's\nconfusing like because people don't even\nknow what they're paying for\nlike it's bizarre so i don't know if you\nguys like know anything about financial\ninstruments but like\nyou know the more complex the financial\ninstrument like the worse it is for you\nso annuities are a good example where\nthey're like you know they'll\nbe some weird like life insurance\ninstruments that they'll like pay you\nsome amount after some amount of years\nand if you die you get this\nif this happens you get this and if this\nhappens you get this the more\nifs there are in the system chances are\nthe more you're getting screwed\nchances are because sometimes you need\nifs in the system\nbut then what happens is like this is\nthe decision-making process\nand then like like what is a good health\ninsurance plan so then like your\nemployer is like okay well\nthen they like move all they adjust all\nthe levers right and then your employer\nis like yeah we have great health\ninsurance\nthey'll cover five million dollars worth\nof care but the question is\nso they say that we have a five million\ndollar policy\ngreat but what's the deductible fifty\nthousand dollars\noh [ __ ] what's the premium five thousand\ndollars oh [ __ ]\nwhat's the copay hundred bucks\noh [ __ ] right so there are all these\ndifferent levers and it's just like\nconfusing because if you're not happy\nwith something like i don't even know\nwho you go to like the basic problem\nwith this is that\nyou know this person should be empowered\nto make the most decisions right this is\nwhat everything is about it's not about\nthis guy\nit's not about this guy it's not even\nabout me like i should like\nthese three people should have the least\npower in the relationship\nthis person should have the most power\ngenerally speaking you want to give if\nyou want like a healthy\nmarket you want to empower the consumer\nright like you want the consumer like\nyou know good video games happen because\ngamers\nlike generally speaking i mean some\ngamers buy [ __ ] games but\nlike part of the reason that i think we\nhave so many good games now and you guys\nare welcome to disagree with me\nbut i think that like part of the reason\nwe have so many indie games is because\npeople are out there like\nbuying games that they want to play and\nit supports indie developers\nit's not like nhl 2015\nthen nhl 2016 nhl 2017 nhl 2018.\nit's like we've got cool games like like\nwe've got you know\nwhat are a couple of like i've been\nplaying northgard recently in drg and\nlike\nyou know they're like all these cool\nlike indie games\nright that i mean i really like because\nand we also have like big budget games\nthat are awesome like breath of the wild\nlike that's an awesome game like there\nare a lot of great games out there god\nof war on ps4 is awesome\njedi knight fall in order which is an ea\ngame oh my god ea\nthey're so evil but jedi knight is a\nfantastic game\nand so as long as your consumer like as\na as a video game consumer\nyeah dark souls hollow knight larian\nawesome\ncyberpunk 2070 27 7\n2077 whatever\nright like all these games are cool we\nalso have like starcraft brood war\nlike that game is pretty awesome people\nsay good things about diablo 3 i never\nreally had a chance to play it love\ndiablo 2.\num yes of t5\nso this is how the healthcare system\nworks\nright and it's a mess because i think\nthe consumer doesn't actually have\nchoice\nyou have to pick you have to get health\ninsurance through your employer because\nyour employer\ngets a significant discount and then the\nlast thing is like\nyou know like costs just get passed down\ncosts\njust get passed down passed down passed\ndown to the\nthe the patient\nbecause here's the thing i don't know if\nyou guys know this but health insurance\ncompanies are not going out of business\ndoctors are not going out of business\nemployers are not going out of business\nand so no matter like what\nhow you squeeze like if the doctor\nstarts prescribing expensive medicine\nto the insurance company the insurance\ncompany is going to increase their\npremium\nor sorry if you prescribe expensive\nmedicine to the patient and the\ninsurance company has to pay for it\nthey're going to jack up their premium\nand then employers are going to kind of\njockey to sort of provide the worst\nhealth insurance they can\nto keep people employed and oftentimes\nthat they do their best to\nprovide like no insurance or just\nabsolute crap insurance there are a lot\nof good employers out there who like try\nto provide good insurance\num and and it's just the costs are\nastronomical it's like it's not\nyou know it's like really kind of crazy\nlike so you know my\nmy health insurance my employer paid a\nportion of\nso when i say it's like 2.5 k that's\nsomething that i'm paying out of pocket\nthrough the nose\nbecause i'm on cobra now don't even get\nme started there\nbut before that i used to pay like half\nand my employer would pay half\nand i just decided i wanted good health\ninsurance because i had like you know a\nwife who's having kids and [ __ ] like\nthat so\num and i'm lucky because i can afford\nthat and it's like absolutely\nastronomical\nand so this is how it works here's the\nhealthcare dlc\nquestions\nyeah cobra is ridiculous\nyeah so i didn't even get started on all\nkinds other stuff like ppo\nhmo all that stuff i mean that stuff is\neven worse\nlike i i don't even know like this whole\nokay so like one more rant okay so like\nthe idea that\nso i try not to talk about politics and\ni really don't think this is politics\nbut it's become a political issue\nso should everyone in this country have\nhealth insurance ideally the perfect\nenvironment would be\none where the consumer in the health\ncare provider\nhave a direct relationship where it's\nlike\nperson\ndoctor and then you just it's just\ntwo-way right because then you have the\nmost so\nmoney service\nthe second that you add a third person\nthings get really messed up\nyou guys see that it's like\nthat's weird right so you pay this guy\nthis guy pays your doctor and it's like\nwhat\nlike this is increasing costs by like 30\nor more 40 right so there have been\nstudies that show that like\nif you look at the cost of health care\nfor like every one dollar\nin insurance the insurance industry is\nlike 30 to 40 percent of that dollar\nand the thing that boggles my mind is\nbasically the only thing they're\nproviding\nis like risk hedging\nright that's the main value of an\ninsurance company\nis that you may not have the money to\npay for cancer treatment\nso essentially what insurance companies\ndo is they say we're going to charge you\na thousand dollars\na month and then if you get cancer we'll\npay like 50 grand for your cancer\ntreatment\nand they do that with 20 people and so\nthey hedge risk so that\nif something catastrophic happens to you\nit's like it's insurance right so it's\nabout\nhedging risk and what they really\nprovide is hedging risk\nand that's a valuable service don't get\nme wrong but it seems like they cost 30\nto 40 percent of like\nevery dollar that gets spent like\nhedging risk and spending 30 to 40\npercent of your money\non like hedging risk is ridiculous\nokay so what was i going to rent oh yeah\nso uninsured\nokay so then the other interesting thing\nis people say like oh like you know\nuniversal health care is good or\nuniversal health care is bad like this\nis the other thing that i think a lot of\npeople don't realize\nso when someone without insurance\nso let's say this person with insurance\nyou guys want me to keep going because\nthis is is this interesting to you\nshould i stop\nokay all right so now this is this is\ngonna blow y'all's mind okay\nso let's say there's a hospital\nokay\nso let's say someone with insurance goes\nto the hospital\nokay and receives a service\nhow does their service get paid for\nokay\ninsurance plus copay great so now here's\nour insurance person right\nso this is what happens so this hospital\ngets paid\nso let's follow the money guys remember\nalways follow the money\nso money goes there right so we're\npaying\nthis and then this person is paying this\nso who pays at the end of the day who\npays\nfor the health care that's provided\nthe patient absolutely okay great so\nlet's say a person without insurance\ngoes to the emergency room because\nthey're having a heart attack we're not\neven going to get into the whole\npart about preventive care and saving\nmoney and all that kind of crap\nokay we're going to just avoid all that\nfor a second so let's say\nthe\nso who pays for the health care that the\nperson without insurance\nso who pays for that service\ntaxpayers okay how talk to me\nmy tax money how how does your tax money\npay for his health care\nnope doesn't have medicaid\nokay hospital takes a loss okay\nso that's actually sort of\ntrue so the hospital takes a loss\nbut you guys are right you guys are\nright so now\nlet's this is the part of the story that\nmost people don't know so then the\nhospital\ngoes to the u.s government\nand says u.s government\nwe are taking a loss by caring for these\npeople\nand we're gonna go out of business and\nwe're gonna have to shut down the\nhospital\nunless you guys pay us to stay in\nbusiness because\ntwenty percent of these people are\nuninsured and each time they come to the\nhospital it costs fifty thousand dollars\nwe're gonna have to close our doors\nunless you give us money\nand then what happens to a chat\nright the government says okay we don't\nwant you to close your doors because\nthen they're gonna be people dying in\nthe streets so we're going to pay you\nmoney\nand now wait for it twitch chat where\ndoes this money come from\ntaxes right\nand so this is the crazy thing so there\nare a lot of people\nin this country who don't want universal\nhealth care\nwhat they don't realize is\nthey're paying for everyone's health\ncare anyway\nbecause hospitals are not going to take\na loss the other thing oh there's one\nother piece of the puzzle that y'all\nwe forgot so there are two ways in which\nthis person gets\nso questionable because like maybe\nthey're printing money\nright so maybe the the you're\nit's not coming through your taxes maybe\nthe u.s is just spending money\nbut when when the hospital takes a loss\nwhere do they make up the loss\nwhere do they make up their loss\ncharging who more absolutely the\ninsurance company\nthey make it up over here so they\nincrease the amount that they charge the\ninsurance company\nwhich in turn increases the amount they\ncharge you\nso like i don't know if you guys get\nthis but the problem with our health\ncare system is that this guy's getting\nscrewed all the time like all the time\nno matter what happens\nthis is the guy that gets food so to\nsubside to stay in business because the\ngovernment doesn't give\nhospitals that much money right so like\nmedicaid pays like\n30 percent or like 60 or like some\nridiculous\namount of costs so in order\nfor the the hospital to break even what\nthey do is charge the insurance\ncompanies more\nso like i'll just give you guys an\nexample okay so\nfor a particular health care system that\ni was studying\nthey charge they collect 250\non average for a 30 minute 20 minute\nfor a 20-minute psycho farm appointment\nfor a psychiatrist\nfrom blue cross blue shield okay\nso when you go see your psychiatrist for\n20 minutes and they give you a pill\nthey collect about 250 from blue cross\nblue shield\nfor that same visit for someone with\nmedicaid\nthey collect about seventy dollars\nlike why is there such a big difference\nit's because\nthe providers make up for this loss\nby jacking up prices to insurance\ncompanies which then pass along those\npremiums\nto patients and then everyone saying 2.5\nk\nper month 4.5 k per month\nin insurance premiums how the hell does\nthat happen\nthat's how it happens folks this is how\nthese at ridiculous premiums get\nthis is how it happens this is our\nhealth care system\nso being uninsured is better no being\nuninsured is worse\nbecause then the only care you get is\nthe emergency room\nso like the whole point of insurance is\nthat insurance provides preventive care\nso you never wind up in the emergency\nroom this is the thing that people don't\nget\nis that like the guy who never takes his\ncholesterol medication or blood pressure\nmedication\nwe're all playing for him anyway so we\nhave a choice either we pay for his\nheart attack or we pay\nfive bucks a month for his blood\npressure pills\nor we pay like a hundred thousand\ndollars for his heart attack\nright no just don't buy health care is a\nterrible situation\nwhat if you're rich without insurance\nyou get screwed\nthat's what's happening in this country\npeople are getting screwed like even if\nyou're rich and you pay for health\ninsurance\nyou're getting screwed anyway everyone's\ngetting screwed like this is the dude\nwho pays for everything\nthis guy\nright it's like anyway what if you feel\nlike\nthat's what happens to people right so\nthere's like so\nwith with obamacare which you know i'm\nreally don't care about people's\npolitical affiliations like the\nthe obamacare was like sort of a step\ninto i think it was a necessary evil is\nthe way i'd\ndescribe it but so what happened is that\nlike they made insurance mandatory\nwhich is kind of interesting because\nwhat they did is they forced all the\npeople\nwho don't need health insurance like\nyoung 23 year olds to buy health\ninsurance\nto subsidize the cost of the people who\nare like old and sick and need health\ninsurance\nyeah the system really is [ __ ]\num yeah so like it's interesting i saw\nan article a couple months or about a\nyear ago about like\na nobel prize like a nobel laureate\nauctioned off his nobel prize to pay for\nhis healthcare\nbecause he was broke and he couldn't\nafford it so he literally he literally\nsold his nobel prize\nto pay for his health care like it's\nbizarre\nhow do you change the system oh man okay\nso like i said\nthe first thing to do the\na better system would be this\nthis is the first thing so people talk\nabout you know socialized medicine and\nobamacare and stuff like that\nthe real solution is to create a\nscenario in which\nthe consumer has power over their dollar\nbecause then when they're the ones like\nthe reason that everyone is screwing\nthis guy is because\nthis guy doesn't have control over his\nown calling\nlike so the guy who doesn't have power\nin the equation is the one that's going\nto get financially screwed\nright like\nso what you've got to do is give the\nconsumer power\nto choose you try to make it\nas like that's the real solution what\nthat looks like i'm not entirely sure\nbut i think the first thing is to not\nhave an um\nan insurance based system so not have\nsomething where your insurance pays for\nyour health care but you pay for your\nhealth care\nso a couple of good examples of this so\nsingapore\nrequires all of its\ni'm a little bit dated on this but\nsingapore requires\nall of its people to save a certain\npercentage of their\nincome into a health care savings\naccount\nthe interesting thing is that when you\nso you can pay 30 grand in premiums\nokay you can disagree with this however\nyou want to but i'm just going to offer\nan alternative okay\n30k in premiums\nto insurance or you can have 30k\nin an account\nso the big difference here is that when\nyou are in control of the thirty\nthousand dollars\nyou're going to be way more careful\nabout how you spend them\nwhen your insurance is has your thirty\nthousand dollars\nthey're not going to give a [ __ ] they're\njust going to try to pay for as little\ncare as possible because they've already\ngotten the money\nit's like an hsa absolutely right so\nlike\ni think the core idea so singapore also\nhas a couple of other things like they\nhave a safety net\nand other kinds of like insurance-based\nthings but i think it's kind of an\ninteresting idea i think\nat the end of the day so i'll give you\nguys just another random example\nokay so this is what i really think is\nmessed up\nso in ancient china and this could be\nwrong so i was taught this by a chinese\nmedical doctor but\ni don't really know if it's true or not\nin ancient china\nthis is the way that healthcare\nreimbursement worked\nyou pay a monthly fee to your doctor\nany month in which someone in your\nfamily gets sick\nyour doctor does not get paid\nfascinating huh completely different\ncompletely changes perspectives and\nincentives\nthe incentive becomes keeping you\nhealthy\nas opposed to paying for care when\nyou're sick\nyeah get sick just to [ __ ] with them\nyeah i'm sure there are all kinds of\nproblems honestly there's got to be all\nkinds of problems with that because like\nwhat if your doctor tells you to do\nsomething and you don't do it do you\ndoes he still not get paid i don't know\nmaybe he fires you then i don't know but\nlike\nlike our whole our whole health care\nsystem it's not health care it's sick\ncare\nit's just like the incentives are\ncompletely perverse\nthey're just like they're just all\nmessed up\nso that's my health care rent like this\nthis is just ridiculous guys\nthis is even more ridiculous it's just\nall ridiculous\nso i i mean like i think that having a\nsingle-payer system\nis good in some ways because\nat least uh because you know the\ngovernment and\nthey're going to be political statements\nabout this too so it's not really my\nplace but\nso we do know oh so here's actually data\nso let's do data okay so\nso the administrative cost of insurance\nis about 30 cents on the dollar\nso the cost of having a private\ninsurance company in the system is about\n30 cents on the dollar can anybody guess\nwhat\nmedicare and medicaid's it\nadministrative overhead\nis compared to 30 cents on the dollar\ncompared to private efficient insurance\ncompanies\ngreat i love it three to four cents\non the dollar\nthree to four cents their administrative\noverhead\nfor administering health insurance is 10\nof what a private insurance company is\nand do you guys know what administrative\noverhead includes\nso here's the beautiful thing corporate\nsalaries are administrative overhead\nright so like it's not my place to say\nwhether the government is corrupt or not\ncorrupt like i really don't know about\nthat but like i can give you guys some\nstatistics\nand if you guys want references i have\nreferences\nlet me see if i can find them that's\ngoing to protect it\noh [ __ ]\nlet's just google it see\nso\ni'm not sure what i i mean i'm seeing\narticles from the new york times\nand other things but here\ni'll show you\noh [ __ ] hey wall\nso i i don't know if this is i mean\nthese aren't cited well\nbut medicare has an overhead of about\nthree percent private insurance has 25\nto 30 percent that's wasted i don't know\nit's washington post so it's not a\nprimary study i i think i've got the\nprimary\nanalysis somewhere um\ni just have to get up but\nyeah yeah so i i\nthat's what i'm saying i don't think\nthose are good sources so i'd have to\nfind the primary\ni've seen i mean i've seen the primary\nstudies that are done in\nlike health affairs\ncare\nso there's like new england\nnew england journal of medicine and\nhealth affairs i think or where i've\ni've read this stuff before and those i\nthink are pretty reputable sources\nbut y'all are also welcome to disagree i\nyou know\ncommon media i i just don't trust as\nmuch as like primary like\nliterature um\nhere we go so this is also a blog\num but health affairs is a pretty good\nsource\nyeah so of course oh so so for common\nyeah so this is like cms.gov so\nthis is a good resource right so\nmedicare spending rose by an average of\n4.3 percent\nprivate insurance so this is a good\nsource\nthis so now twitch chat like if you guys\nwant good sources\nthis is the good stuff man cms.gov baby\nlike not new york times not washington\npost you go straight to cms.gov\nit's like that's where the good [ __ ] is\num national academy for social insurance\ni don't know what that is spending\nokay so kaiser family foundation that\ntoo is\nthis kaiser\nsays two percent of operating\nexpenditures administrative costs are\ncloser to 17\n[Music]\num\nyeah interesting anyway if you guys want\ngood data like this is where you gotta\ngo\nlike you gotta go to cms.gov right go to\nthe primary source\num\nso\nthose are the dlcs my friends a couple\nof other\nuh closing thoughts one is um\nso just in terms of all the stuff that's\ngoing on with like sexual assault and\nand misbehavior uh we do have like a\na safe space for women on our discord\nwhich i\nrecognize some people have issues with\nand if we have it for women why don't we\nhave it for other communities and all\nthat good stuff like that's an important\ndiscussion\num the short answer is that it seems\nlike women feel\nget a lot of you know bad responses from\npeople\nand so we do have a space for women to\nfeel free to like you know talk about\nissues and\nfeel safe um you guys can check it out\non our discord i think go to the\nannouncement section and there's a way\nto join\nand uh yeah i mean so\num you know if you guys are are\nstruggling with with\nany of that stuff and and you need a\nplace to go like that's one place that\nyou can go\ni still sort of um so we recognize the\nimportance of that and\nat the same time i think a big part of\nour mission at healthy gamer is that\nyou know i personally believe that our\nshared experiences at human being\nas human beings trump at the end of the\nday\nany kind of gender or identity based\nexperience i think that\nat the end of the day what brings us\ntogether as human beings\nis like greater than what separates us\nis another way to put it\nand at the same time i fully admit and\nacknowledge that\nyou know depending on your race your\ngender\nor ethnicity or any number of other\nfactors\nyour experience of life is going to be\nfundamentally different\num and so like you know balancing that\nis tricky\nand i think at the end of the day though\nwe're all just people and i'm\nyou know healthy gamer is here to\nsupport people and sometimes some people\nneed more support than other people\nso that's kind of how we work um thank\nyou guys very much for coming\num we've got a lot of exciting stuff\nkind of coming out so\na couple of closing announcements so\nwe're going to have\num someone\nyvonne from offline tv on wednesday\nwe have um austin who has like some\ndating shows and stuff\non twitch on friday uh we're our\ncoaching program is live and is going\nwell\nthankfully so i think people are getting\nhelped and stuff like that we're going\nto be opening up\nnew spots um i think today\nand then some more spots maybe one more\nweek from now where we may be\nkind of full after that but go ahead and\nsign up for the waiting list\nwe also started training our next batch\nof coaches actually today so we had our\nfirst coach training a couple hours ago\nand so we're going to try to train them\nover the next couple of months it does\ntake time because we want to make sure\nthat you know they're\nable to do their good job a good job and\nwe have sort of\na pretty hectic training schedule where\nthey work with people\nand we sort of supervise their coaching\nand make sure that they can do a good\njob so it takes a couple of months to\ntrain them\nabout three months four months um\nand yeah and i think the last thing that\nuh is that we're working on\nsort of you know more different kinds of\ncontent\nkind of stuff like this but we probably\nwon't necessarily stream at all but like\nwe want to do like kind of more\ncomprehensive content\nso we're kind of working on all that\nstuff and we appreciate all the support\num last couple of thoughts is you know\nwe i get a lot of requests from parents\nand um give me just one\nyou"
