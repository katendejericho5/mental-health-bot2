    "transcript": "so here's here's what we mean by the\nstudy DLC so we've asked people so\npeople have asked for like more in-depth\ncontent and so I'm gonna try to break\ndown how to study so in order to break\ndown how to study we first have to start\nwith understanding how the mind works so\nI want you guys to start with this very\nsimple example okay so let's say that I\nwant to study like a text book so I open\nup the text book I read what's on the\npage and what happens after I read\nwhat's on the page do I learn it right\nso like some people are saying yes some\npeople are saying no some people are\nsaying you forget right so like let's\njust pause there okay so let's start by\nunderstanding that when I read something\non the page what can we learn from that\nbecause we're getting a thousand\ndifferent answers the first thing to\nunderstand is that there are variable\nresponses or outcomes to reading\nsomething on a page that in and of\nitself is a very important data point\nright that like when you read a page\nessentially you're rolling the dice and\nsometimes you learn what's on the page\nsometimes you don't learn that's on the\npage that in and of itself is like\nreally weird so that happens is like why\nis it that sometimes you read something\nin a textbook and you understand it and\nother times you don't right so we're\ngonna dig into that so second thing to\nthink about is you know we have this\nperception like if I read something if I\nread a page of a textbook and then I\ndon't understand what's on it what\nhappens next like what do I do next\nright so yeah so once again a lot of\ndifferent answers so one is you just\nkeep reading like you just move on right\nso you're just like okay like I'm just\ngonna read the next page like why does\nyou reread that the other thing is you\npanic you get distracted whatever fine\nso like all those things are also very\nimportant answers so then the\ninteresting thing is that you know when\nyou read something and then you read it\nagain and you read it again and you read\nit again like so people sometimes think\nabout you know learning is like a linear\nprocess where like were the first time I\nread it I get 20% the second time I read\nit I'm up to 40% the third time 60% 80%\nand then I have to read it five times\nbefore I understand it and that's the\nway that we approach studying right like\nwe sit down and we say like I just need\nto read this over and over\nover again until I understand it but\nthat's like a really bad way to study\nbecause the main thing that I want to\ndig into you dig into today with you\nguys is like how is it that sometimes\nyou can read a like a page of a textbook\nand you can understand it and other\ntimes you don't like you guys have to\nunderstand that there's a roll of the\ndice and I think the best way to to\nstudy is to recognize what influences\nthe outcome of that diary\nyou know what influences whether you\nactually digest the material or don't\ndigest the material and that's the\ninteresting thing is like the\ninformation is not really it's not just\nin the textbook there's a process of\ndigestion of material which can be\nworked on and no one ever teaches you\nthat in the main thing about the study\nDLC that I want to teach you guys today\nis about like how to digest material\nefficient ok so this is what I want you\nall to think about for a second so when\nI read a piece of page what influences\nwhether I understand the material or I\ndon't understand the material so let me\nask you guys this way if I'm studying\nand I'm studying in a building that's\nburning down how likely do you think I\nam how likely am I to understand in the\nmaterial not likely\nright so I want you guys to think about\nit this way so when when the mind so the\nmind has different levels of activity ok\nso let's say here's an act of mind and\nhere's a calm mind and so the more\nactive your mind is the harder it is for\ninformation to sink in so this like\nactually is not going to happen\nwhereas when the mind is calm it's easy\nfor information to sink in\nok so the first thing to understand\nabout studying is that like the more\ncalm or tranquil your mind the more\nreceptive is it it is to information and\nso you really have to think a little bit\nabout what are the circumstances that\nlead to a calm mind because if you have\na calm mind you're much more likely to\nlearn so the big backdrop to this is\nthat when I was in med school I\nbasically only studied for two hours a\nday and I had many colleagues who\nstudied for like six\nor eight hours or like you know just\ntons and tons of studying a day and what\nI really found is that like studying\nmore was not as good as studying better\nand that if my mind was in the right\nstate of mind that when I read something\nit would kind of sink in and I realize\nthe same thing that you guys did which\nis that like sometimes when I read a\npiece like some sometimes when I read\nsomething I understand it and sometimes\nwhen I don't read something I don't\nunderstand it I mean I sometimes when I\nread something I understand and\nsometimes when I read something I don't\nunderstand it which is like a weird\nobservation and then the first thing\nthat I thought is oh it must have to do\nwith the difficulty of the material and\nthe harder the material is to understand\nthe more I have to read it which is sort\nof true but that I also realize that\nsometimes there can be easy material\nthat I still don't absorb right like\nthat's kind of weird because if you\nreally stop and you think about you know\nwhat you're doing there are many times\nwhere you can read the simplest thing\nand it still doesn't sink in and the\nmain thing that I discover was actually\nlike this this kind of principle here\nthat there's you know there's a calm\nmind and there is a not calm mind so\nthen the question becomes what are the\nways in which to calm your mind so the\nsimplest thing to do if you want to\nstudy efficiently is the first thing I'd\nsay is you study first thing in the\nmorning and there's a reason for that\nokay so number one study first thing in\na.m. okay so so they're they're gonna be\ncounter points to this which we'll get\nto so the reason is because like when\nyou when you start your day you tend to\nbe like this right and then if you think\nabout it like the more that your day\ngoes on like you're gonna get like this\nso as your mind has various experiences\nas you have conversations with people as\nyou start playing games as you like open\nup Twitter your mind like is gonna\nbecome more and more active and it's\ngonna be like less tranquil as you start\nthinking about stuff and the more that\nyou think about stuff like the harder it\nis to come back to this mindset and so\nsome people say oh I study well in the\nevening or whatever like that's that's\nfine I mean that we're gonna\ntalk about that later but generally\nspeaking the mind gets wound up through\nthe day and this is why for most people\nsleep is refreshing right so like why\ndoes sleep help us what asleep do so as\nour brain you know thinks throughout the\nday\nwe accumulate a chemical in our brain\ncalled adenosine an adenosine is a\nbyproduct or sort of the and like the\nthe end product of ATP which is like\nenergy so essentially what happens is we\nlike go through our day is our day our\nbrain starts out with the day with like\na high amount of ATP and a low amount of\nadenosine and as our brain is active\nthroughout the day our adenosine builds\nup in our ATP decreases and if any of\nyou guys have like any sort of\nunderstanding of biology or cellular\nbiology you know what ATP is and so the\ninteresting thing is what asleep do what\nsleep does is it it turns adenosine back\ninto ATP clears out adenosine of the\nfrom the brain and what we know is that\nlike one of the ways in which sleep\nrefreshes us is by like refreshing or\nATP so what sort of does is fills up our\nmana bar and so that what you want to do\nis to study most efficiently you want to\nstudy with a brain full of ATP not a\nbrain full of adenosine and so study\nfirst thing in the morning there are a\ncouple of other reasons for that so\nnumber one is ATP versus adenosine\nokay number two is circadian rhythm so\nthis is gonna be challenging because a\nlot of us don't have regular schedules\nand some people feel like they're their\nnight owls or whatever and they don't\nlike really function that well in the\nmorning so our body has an\nevolutionarily conserved circadian\nrhythm that is like common across\nmammals so if you look at mammals\nanywhere we're not I mean not anywhere\nbut most places most mammals tend to be\nmost active at dawn and dusk and it's\nkind of interesting because like part of\nthe reason that sunset and sunrise are\nso beautiful is because our eyes are\nactually evolved to have the highest\ndegree of visual acuity during sunrise\nand sunset\nthat's why color seems so vivid it's not\nlike colors are magically more vivid\nduring that time of the day it's because\nour organs of perception are designed\nfor maximum acuity in our maximum\nreceptivity of the environment during\nthose times and that's not that's not\njust with our visual system our bodies\nare designed to be active or our minds\nare most designed to be active during\nlike dawn and dusk and so you see that\nkind of conserved across mammals if you\nlook at like lions if you look at\nmonkeys if you look at like all the apes\nthey tend to be like the most active\naround dawn and dusk so if you think\nabout like you know biologically most\npeople most humans have evolved to be\nactive during dawn and dusk so any kind\nof mental activity that you do around\ndawn and dusk are going to be on average\nfor most human beings in the population\nthere are caveats to this which we're\ngonna get to is gonna be most efficient\nduring that time so what I would do is\nis wake up at 4:30 I'd study I do like\nyoga for like half an hour and meditate\nand then I'd study from 5 to 7 a.m. and\nthen what I would do is like I you know\nget ready and then I'd like go to class\naround 8:00 class starts around 9:00 you\nknow get ready and then something cool\nwould happen which is like at 9:00 a.m.\nI would go to class but I would have\nyeah you guys say you're out just stay\nwith me okay\nso you know at 9:00 a.m. like I would\nhave already read everything and I would\nlike understood it I would\nunderstood things I sat down I kind of\nstudied it it was like super high\nquality study and so you guys know how\nlike you wish you would have like\nrevised things or reviewed more like my\nclass would actually be the review so I\nwould it was like I did my review like\nthe first time i sat in class because\nI'm kind of reviewing the material and\nthen when I actually studied for the\ntest that would be like the third review\nright so it's like the third time I'm\ngoing over the material so study first\nthing in the morning for reasons of ATP\nbecause your your mind is kind of fresh\nfor reasons of circadian rhythm now\nlet's talk about the caveat to this\nright so but not a ton so some people\nsay I'm not a morning person I'm a night\nperson or it's hard for me to wake up\nfine so I think that you know when\npeople say that they're not a morning\nperson a couple of caveats to this one\nis that if you're a teenager your\ncircadian rhythm is not geared to start\nat 4:30 in the morning it's actually\ngeared to start somewhat later\nso teenagers especially there's good\nevidence that suggests that you guys\nlike mentally become active around like\nmaybe 9:00 a.m. or 10:00 a.m. so that's\nan important caveat to consider so I\ndon't know if that means you know you\nshould wake up at 9:00 a.m. and then\nlike study from 9:00 to 11:00 that could\nbe hard because of school and stuff like\nthat\nbut there are biological counter points\nto the argument that I'm making so let's\nrun over those the first is that if\nyou're a teenager you need more sleep\nand that your mental faculties may be\nprimed later in the day then 4/32 caveat\nis I'm a night person like there are\nnight owls and there are morning larks\nor whatever so in my experience most\nnight owls have become night owls and\nhave adapted to being a night owl but\nare not intrinsically that way\nso if you look at like the way that most\nnight owls are born it usually starts\nsometime in teen years where people stay\nup really late like doing things that\nthey find kind of engaging or fun or\ndopaminergic like they text people they\nplay video games they like spend time on\nYouTube or whatever and so spend time on\nTwitch and so essentially like don't\nconfuse your brain and body's ability to\nadapt circadian rhythm to evolutionarily\nwhat a human being is designed for so\nhumans are also evolutionarily\nvery very adaptable so when you're like\na physician and you work nights your\nbody kind of gets into the rhythm of\nbeing active and awake and functioning\nat night okay that's fine but don't\nconfuse your ability to adapt with like\nbiologically what you're geared for so\nin my experience a lot of the people who\nclaim to be night owls when I actually\nwork with them for some amount of time\nand recalibrate they're they're like\nnight alamos they actually do better\nduring the day than they did at night so\nthat's kind of an interesting caveat if\nyou think you're a night owl so the\nthird reason to study first thing in the\nmorning is sort of psychological stuff\nand what I mean by that is you know so I\nasked you guys can you study well if you\nare in a burning building no so if we\nthink about it like what are the other\nthings that are gonna take a mind like\nthis and turn it into this so these are\nthis is gonna be like psychological\ninsults for lack of a better term right\nso if you're walking down the street\nlike let's say at noon you go out with a\nfriend of yours in the end like your\nfriend says you're you're a dumbass I\nhate you you suck at life or let's say\nthat you play a video game and you like\ntilt because you lost and these guys are\nnoobs or whatever like if you wake up\nfirst thing in the morning like most\npeople don't wake up tilted although\nwe'll talk about that in a second right\nbut like you know as you tilt and as is\nstressful stuff happens to you\nthroughout the day it becomes harder to\nstudy because you're moving from here to\nhere this is what tilt does so tilt\ndisturbs the tranquility of your mind\nand makes it hard to study so the more\nexperiences you have throughout the day\nthe more psychological crap builds up\nand the harder it's gonna be for you to\nstudy because you're studying is gonna\nbe less efficient and then what you have\nto do is essentially spend willpower or\nmana let's just call it willpower mana\nright so you have to expand willpower or\nmana\nto go to this right so if you're tilted\nand you sit down to study you guys can\nsee this like where you have to like it\ntakes like effort to just sit there\nbecause your mind doesn't want to\nconcentrate on that because you're like\ntilted and then what happens is like\nlike a chunk of your ATP right so 50% of\nyour ATP gets reduced in going from this\nstate to this state so you're starting\nout like you're starting out with like\nhalf of your mana bar already spent if\nyou play games before you study your\nmind is gonna be thinking about the game\nit's gonna be thinking about tilt it's\ngonna be thinking about this strategy oh\nyou want to do this let me do this let\nme do this and then you actively have to\nrestrain it to kind of come back to\nsquare one whereas if you start in the\nmorning you're at like 100% mana right\nhere right and then the other\ninteresting thing is that like when you\nactually tilt even this state actually\ncosts you like 50% of your mana bar and\nthen going back from your like this\nstate to this state cost you the other\n50% and then you're left with like\nnothing you're like out of mana before\nyou even start to study and you're here\nthis is like your own with no Sun and so\nit's hard like it sucks and then what\nhappens is you're trying to like read\nthis stuff right and then it kind of\ngoes here and then\nsometimes it sinks in and sometimes it\nbounces off right that's what happens\nand you're you're kind of you're kind of\nscrewed like it's just gonna be super\ninefficient so clarity of mind leads to\ngood studying and specifically the\nthings that you want to avoid or like\nany kinds of emotional experiences any\nkind of conflicts any kind of tilting\nany kind of distraction so the earlier\nyou start like the fewer experiences you\nhave before you pack the book the better\noff you're gonna be ideally you can also\ntake advantage of a couple of things\nlike circadian rhythm and stuff like\nthat so your because your mind is primed\nthe other interesting thing is that if\nyou look at religious traditions they\nhave things like Matins or Brahma muta\nright so in Islam you have like the five\ntimes prayers and like why do they start\nso like these these are three triggered\nreligious traditions so you have Islam\nCatholicism and Hinduism or Buddhism and\nall three of them basically say that\nlike meditation or prayer is like a\nreally good time for meditation or\nprayer is it like five a.m. and that's\nkind of interesting right so like you\ncould argue that because Islam and\nCatholicism share a common root they\nshare a common ancestor therefore there\nshould be similarities between those two\nreligions but Hinduism and Buddhism were\nsort of centrally independently\ndeveloped as religions and they all came\nto the same conclusion which is like\nthis is the best time to pray or this\ntime is conducive to mental activity and\nthat's the time around 5:00 a.m. so if\nyou guys ever go to like a yoga or\nmeditation retreat like they start early\nand like why do they start early it's\nbecause it's actually like it's easy to\nmeditate first thing in the morning it's\nhard to meditate at noon so there's\nactually you know some evidence of this\nin in other ways too whether you call\nthat evidence or not is you know that's\nquestionable but it's kind of\ninteresting right so it's an interesting\nobservation at least so study first\nthing in the morning and a tranquil mind\nleads to more efficient studying think\nabout how you spend your mana okay so\nnow the next thing to think about okay\nso now let's talk a little bit about how\nknowledge works so this is gonna be hard\nyou\nokay so I want to teach you guys how the\nmind works okay so this is how your mind\nworks so this is the conscious mind\nokay this is unconscious so what I want\nyou guys to think about is like so I\nhave a thought right so someone someone\nin Chad said I wake up thinking about\nvideo games great so let like let's\nunderstand like how does that work\nso where do your thoughts come from\nright so like you have thoughts in your\nconscious mind so where do they come\nfrom\nyou\nit's like that's kind of weird right\nlike so if I have a thought about a\nvideo game like like so here's like so\nwhat's like let's think about just a\nvalent so I want to play this character\nin okay where does that thought come\nfrom\nokay whatever siesta whatever see mood\ninstinct memory stimulus desire\nexperience like like so the first thing\nlike I want you guys to just think about\nlike what twitch had the same so do you\nguys get that like no one has a clue\nlike everyone sort of thinks they have\nan answer but like let's just pause and\nappreciate for a moment that as a\npopulation\nwe don't know where thoughts come from\nright like we're living life not knowing\nwhere the thoughts in your head come\nfrom and like no wonder life is hard\nbecause we don't know where this kind of\ncrap comes from like imagine if you\ncould have a thought I really want to\nlearn geometry man rhomboids are opie\nright like imagine if you woke up every\nday and you had thoughts like this\ninstead of thoughts like this right like\nlike imagine how much easier your life\nwould be right so like this is what I\nwant you all to understand so what we\nstruggle with is that we fight against\nour own thoughts right so when you wake\nup and you think about fine cs:go is\nbetter than balint or whatever you pick\nyour game animal crossing' right so can\nanybody truly hate on Animal Crossing\nmaybe we'll see but so like like you\nwake up in your mind starts thinking\nabout that about like animal crossing\nand then the problem is like this\nprocess of moving from this talk to this\nthought thought requires manna\nright because Manas would and so like\nwitnesses thought come from and is there\nany way for this column to be our\nnatural thought instead of this column\nso imagine how easy your life would be\nif this if if this was the default\nbecause that's what you guys want right\nlike like in the problem is that we\nspend too much time thinking about video\ngames and and like we want to be\nthinking about like like you want to be\nable to study like you don't want to\nfight to be able to study okay so where\ndoes that come from right so people are\ngenerally right so the thought sort of\nbubbles up from here okay and then it\nsort of forms above the thought bubble\nand what I want you all to understand is\nthat when you learn something it's kind\nof the conscious mind so let's say like\nyou know pi equals sorry 3.14 let's say\nlike other random thoughts like you know\nPI R squared is like the area of a\ncircle right so in our conscious mind\nwhen we're studying what we're trying to\ndo is essentially implant these thoughts\nright so here's the border of conscious\n- unconscious and it bounced off bounced\noff and so depending on whether our mind\nis pomf or not like it'll actually sink\nin and this is what learning is so\nlearning is when this thought that is\nconscious which is actively in your mind\ngets planted into your unconscious and\nthen can be called up and so once PI R\nsquared lives down here\nthen it can bubble up on its own\nyou guys see that\nbut the weird thing is that like we\ndon't know how to plant thoughts into\nour unconscious so now we get to some of\nthe mental health stuff right so okay\nsure so show hands who thinks that\nthey're a piece of [ __ ] and they suck at\nlife right\nokay so like think about this where does\nthat live\nand then it bubbles up across the border\nand then it's feels bad man all day\nit's weird right like this thing lives\nin your subconscious like the\nperceptions that you have about yourself\nlive in your subconscious and they\nbubble up and they tell you that you're\na bad person so let's say you're gonna\nsay like okay I just really study for\nthis test and then like this thought\nbubbles up that's like yeah but like you\nwaited too long and you're not gonna get\nan A so you might you might as well not\nstudy because if you can't get an A\nthere's no point like that's kinda weird\nright so let's forget let's just assume\nthat that's true for a second but what I\nwant you guys to appreciate is like when\nyou try to do something in life these\nweird thoughts bubble up in your head\nfrom we don't even know where it's like\nhow does that even work like when you're\ntrying to do something good for yourself\nand there's a there's an interesting\ninterview that we did with this guy\nnamed crucify when we were like a tiny\nstream that I encourage you guys to\nwatch but I want you guys to realize\nthat like these thoughts bubble up and\nlike they're not they're not necessarily\nreal they just kind of bubble up they're\nlike a formula that you learned that was\nsort of wrong and it sort of just\nbubbles up and then as we have\nexperiences so these are some scars\nright so like let's say you get bullied\nor like let's think about it this way so\nlet's say that you procrastinate it and\nyou didn't study well enough then what\nhappens is I'm lazy is a conscious\nthought to begin with and then what do\nyou do with the conscious thought it\nyou're lazy you plant it down here and\nthen it lives down here and then what it\nstarts to do is bubble up right so there\nare times in your life where you have\nlearned or concluded that you're lazy\nand then that thought that get gets\nplanted into your subconscious and then\nit's like this laziness generating\nmachine that bubbles up it's like this\nbubble generating machine that's selling\nyou like oh you're lazy you're lazy like\noh like you need to get a job but you're\nlazy Oh like you do this but like but\nI'm lazy\nlike I can't exercise because I'm lazy\nand so it's kind of weird but like\nyou know at some point your mind starts\nworking against you because the\nunconscious starts to bubble up all\nkinds of weird things and learning is\nthe process of taking what's in the\nconscious and putting into the\nunconscious right that's what\nunderstanding is you don't have to hold\nit in your head you can be triggered\nautomatically that's what learning is\nand the thoughts that we have come from\nwhere so let me put it to you guys this\nway I'll ask again\nokay conscious where do our unconscious\nthoughts come from\nwhere are they born\nyou\nexactly they're born from the conscious\nokay so this is what happens right so\nlike thought starts here and then gets\nmoved down here right so it went in this\nway and then it starts to bubble out\nthis is the process of learning learning\nis this arrow right here\nso if we think about what when I study\nsomething right like I have to hold it\nin my head just think about the prospect\nof studying when you're learning\nsomething you're literally holding\nsomething in your conscious mind and if\nit unless it gets until it gets planted\ninto your unconscious you can lose it\nand you won't learn it right like you\ncan hold a thought in your conscious\nmind like if I tell you to remember a\nstring of numbers 7 to 15\nhave you learned that string of numbers\nyou're holding them in your conscious\n725 nine seven two five nine seven two\nfive nine and what you're doing is\nessentially as you repeat it you're you\nknow the seven twenty five nine is being\nbounced in bounced in or bounced out\nsorry and then at one point finally it\nsinks in seven two five nine oh god my\nhandwriting so bad\nand at some point oh okay and then it\nlives there and now you can recall right\nso now the 7 2015 can come out but in\norder to get it in there it takes some\ntime or and the other interesting thing\nis that if I ask you to remember\nsomething and you're paying attention\nthen you can learn it more easily and\nwhat paying attention is is you know\nthis whole back to this thing this is\nnot paying attention this is paying\nattention this is complete attention it\nhas to do with the calmness of your mind\nso now we're gonna try to tie things\ntogether so do you guys understand like\nlike this is what learning is learning\nis the process of taking conscious\nthoughts which you can only hold on to\nfor a limited amount of time before they\ndisappear and you lose them because\nthat's what happens in the conscious\nmind right the conscious mind actually\nloses things and that's why like you can\nthink about valor and order like\nwhatever you're like animal crossing or\nlike breath of the wild or whatever you\ncan think about it for a little while\nand then the thought like trail trickles\noff and trails away and it's gone if it\ngets planted in your unconscious then it\nbecomes learned and once its lives in\nyour unconscious it starts to bubble up\nso then the question becomes how can you\ncontrol what goes into your unconscious\nyou\nso I'm talking about okay I'm you guys\nare answering my question but I\ninstantly know so if I wanted a\nparticular thing to be in my unconscious\nwhat is my strategy for putting it into\nmy unconscious\nokay so people are talking about\nrepetition and reinforcement so let's\nthink about that right so I you guys are\nright but I think there's a very\nimportant implication there which I'm\nnot sure that you all have grasped maybe\nyou guys do okay so one way is for\nrepetition so seven to five nine seven\ntwo five nine seven two five nine okay\nso that's repetition so like each one is\nlet's say a 30% chance to bounce in so\nnow let's think about this the other way\nthat I want you guys to think about it\nis so some person says let it take over\nright so I want you guys said let me ask\nyou a question in a different way if I\nspend most of my day thinking about a\nparticular thing what is the likelihood\nthat that thing will sink into my\nunconscious\nokay so now let me ask you guys\nsomething what do you spend most of your\nday thinking about so just think about\nwhat thoughts are in your mind\nthroughout the day\nand therein lies your problem and your\nsolution right because what bubbles up\nfor you is gonna be what you spend time\nthinking about so you think about what\nthis is and that's gonna be what\nautomatically bubbles up so everyone's\nasking about motivation right but if you\nspend most of your time thinking about\ngames your mind is gonna give you\nthoughts about games and then if you try\nto study it's gonna be hard because this\nis what's being generated I want you\nguys to think about each thought that\nyou have in your mind is like a little\nFactory in your subconscious and what\nhappens is all these factories are gonna\nbe producing thoughts for you which are\ngoing to steer you in a particular\ndirection and so if we look at issues of\nlike low self-worth or self-confidence\nright those people spend time if you\nactually ask them how do you spend your\nday they spend time thinking thoughts\nthat they're bad people and the the\nhere's the real damnedest thing right so\nthe more time I spend time thinking\nabout games this is creating more\nfactories and then each of these\nfactories is gonna think thoughts about\ngames and this is what addiction stuck\nno purpose I don't do anything useful in\nmy life this is why because you have a\ngame producing Factory in your\nunconscious that thinks thoughts about\ngames you reinforce that thought by\nplaying a video game by talking to your\nfriends about video games and the more\ntime that your mind spends occupied on\nthis just like if we were to spend 24\nhours a day thinking about 7:25 9 that's\nall that would be in our mind and if you\nthink negative thoughts about yourself\nthat too is reinforcing though that's\nwhat's occupied in your mind in your\nunconscious is learning how to generate\nnegative thoughts about yourself you\nguys get that this is the problem in a\nnutshell is each thought that you think\nplants a seed in your mind and that seed\nis going to turn into a tree and so if\nyou control your thoughts\nand you're careful about how you plant\nyour thoughts then you'll be able to\nchange what you automatically think and\nthis is what all of you guys want right\nso now I'm going to ask you guys what is\nlazy\nwhat is lazy what does that word mean\nabsolutely so some people are getting it\nit's wrong thoughts right so this is\nwhat you guys want lazy\nthoughts so these are the thoughts of a\nlazy person and they live down here and\nfor you guys they Belov\nright these are the like call them\nwhatever you want to oh I don't feel\nlike doing this oh it's not gonna be\ngood enough people won't like it there's\nno point in trying unless I'm sure it's\ngonna work\nthere's no point in studying unless I\ncan get an A I'll apply to college when\nI can get a 4.0 and show everyone how\nsmart I am all of those thoughts and\nwhat you guys want cuz you look at other\npeople right you look at other people\nand those are the people let's say that\nhave thoughts like I'm gonna try my best\nthese are the not lazy people right they\nhave these kinds of thoughts which you\nguys just don't have you can try to\nforce yourself into thinking that but\nyou just can't think it they're the ones\nthat say it's about the journey not\ndestination they have all these kinds of\nthoughts like these positive thoughts\nthat try hards have right and you're\nlike I wish and and the thing is that\nyou recognize like and you guys know\nthis right because you say I'm lazy and\nthey're not you're not saying it's\nsomething that they do differently\nyou're saying that that person is\nfundamentally different from the way\nthat I am and that's why I can't change\nand the weird thing is you're right and\nwhat you guys are picking up on is that\nthey have not lazy down here so here's\nthe crazy thing okay I mean\nabout how to say this it is actually way\nharder for you to do the same thing than\na not lazy person a not lazy person to\nclean their room is easy for you to\nclean your room is actually harder for a\nnot lazy person to clean their room\nrequires 10% of their mana bar for a\nlazy person to clean their room requires\na 90% of their mana bar and you guys are\nactually right about that you're not\nwrong that you guys are at a\ndisadvantage and the reason that you're\nat a disadvantage is because of your\nthought generating machines this is what\nmotivation is\nmotivation is the capacity to engage in\na behavior intrinsically right you say\nI'm just not motivated those people are\nmotivated where does internal motivation\ncome from it comes from within where\nwithin it comes from your unconscious it\ncomes from the thoughts that\nautomatically bubble up into your head\nand what's completely opie is to have\npositive thoughts down here instead of\nnegative thoughts your life becomes so\nmuch easier when you have positive\nthings like just think about when you\ntry to do something right like when I\napply for a job and I don't get an\ninterview there are two thoughts that\ncan come up in my mind one thought is\nyou see you suck at life no one's ever\ngonna give you an interview\nthat's one thought that you can natural\nyou got to see how that just that [ __ ]\njust appears in your head it doesn't\ncome from anywhere it's just like you're\nwalking or you open there you open the\nladder you see the rejection we're sorry\nwe're gonna go with someone else and\nthat thought pops in you see there's no\npoint in trying do you guys see how that\nthoughts just like completely automatic\njust comes from nowhere and then there's\nthe other people right that's the you\nthat's the us then there's the other\npeople they open the rejection they're\nlike oh man things didn't work out I\nshould probably apply again that's the\nother people that thought to just pops\nup it just pops up it's not like they\nsit and they think about it you guys see\nthis there's a certain automaticity of\nthoughts they don't like sit and they\nponder you can sit and ponder and\npondering allows you to go from the\nfirst thought to the second thought that\nrequires mana right for them\nokay so job rejection thought number one\nI shouldn't have bothered\nthought number two I should try again\nthis both of these are automatic\nokay and so this moving from here to\nhere requires mana\nand what's okie about not being a lazy\nperson is that without spending any mana\njust think about how our penises\nsome people get to be here without\nspending any minute like how broken is\nthat that's cheating right and so then\nthe question is like how do you it's not\nabout this it's about moving from here\nto here right so that you go down this\narrow in the first place\nso broken it's about having a mind and\nthis is what y'all want right\nyou want a mind that actually instead of\nkeeping you from doing things that you\nshould do prompts you to do things that\nyou should do helps you to do things\nthat you should do motivates you to do\nthe things that you should do you know\nit's good for you you even enjoy it but\nyou still don't do it why not it's\nbecause you run down this track\nso now the question is absolutely what\ndo you do about it\nright so now I'm gonna ask you guys what\ndo you do about it where does this\nautomatic thought versus this automatic\nthought where do the thoughts and our\nunconscious mind come from you already\nknow the answer\nsay mana just kill ourselves brute-force\nit look force it is using mana mana pots\nsure we can talk about mana pots the act\nof mind yeah right so once again we get\na bunch of answers some people I think\nhave the right answer and it's hard but\nthis is where the thoughts in our\nunconscious come from right where does 7\nto 15 I know how do you guys remember\nseven to five nine because you\nconsciously spend time thinking about it\nyou\nright so the the and like this is not\nrocket science because here's the thing\nlike you guys so think about whatever\ngame you're thinking about now right\nlike what if you wake up to the dude who\nsaid I woke up and wake up and I think\nabout games how does your mind know\nwhich game to think about when it wakes\nup in the morning what are you thinking\nabout the same game 10 years ago of\ncourse not maybe you were maybe if it's\ndota you've been thinking about do it\nevery morning class decade right so\nwhere does where does the thoughts about\na particular game where does that come\nfrom\nit comes from your conscious mind\nbecause your mind spent conscious time\nthinking about that game and then since\nit spends conscious time thinking about\nthat game thoughts about that game dig\ninto your subconscious and then they\nstart generating thought that's a\nthought generating machine about that\ngame and they start bubbling up that's\nhow it works\nso literally if you control or influence\nthe kinds of thoughts that you spend\nyour time thinking then you will change\nthe person that you are and you will\nchange what your your mind generates so\nmany people say okay but the problem\nwith that is just think different\nthoughts that [ __ ] doesn't work right\nsoon so let's think about how do you\njust think different thoughts so I'll\ngive you guys an example so therapy is a\ngood example so what happens in therapy\nokay so what what happens in therapy is\nyou come to a therapist with a\nparticular pile of thoughts right let's\njust call them negative self-worth okay\nthis is the pile this is the bundle of\nthoughts that you have that's supposed\nto be a bowtie or some [ __ ] and then\nwhat the therapist does is you guys sit\nwith those thoughts and then you like\nreexamine them and then literally in\nyour mind you consciously reframe so if\nyou look at something like CBT cognitive\nbehavioral therapy it involves like\ncognitively reframing the way that you\nlook at things\nand then what happens is you end up with\nless negative self-worth and what I mean\nby end up with less negative software\nyou start to think about yourself in a\nslightly different way and that's why\nCBT works because it changes what's in\nthe unconscious by re-examining it\nthrough the conference this is what our\ncoaches try to do with you - we don't do\nCBT but we help you think about things\nin a different way right and then the\nother things so like how else could you\nchange like the person that like if you\nhave low self-worth like what are the\nother ways one is to consciously\nre-examine the second is like\nenvironment for lack of a better term\nright like if you hang around with\npeople that's sort of like so if you\nthink about you know where does negative\nself-worth come from it comes from let's\nsay like abusive parents or like bullies\nat school or take your pick so let's say\nyou get bullied at school and that's why\nlike so just think about how does\nbullying at school make you feel like\nyou have low self-worth it's because\nwhen you get bullied in your conscious\nmind there are low thought thoughts that\nyou're a piece of crap\nand then since like you get bullied\nevery day and we kind of can see this -\nright so here's the conscious\nunconscious mind you suck and if a bully\ntells you that once\nNBD but when a bully tells you that\nMonday Tuesday and Wednesday Thursday\nyou fight it Friday it goes in Saturday\nit goes in and then it's the weekend and\nit's social media and you ignore Twitter\nand then oh look at all those low\nself-worth generating thought machines\nyou\nright complex PTSD\nso then how do you combat that by\nchanging your environment right\nhey Opie you are great at breath of the\nwild\nhey Opie I Love You Man\nabout softer\nright no no so people are saying do I\nhave to quit games no this is just think\nabout this the reason that you guys play\ngames is because on your friends list\nare the people that give you positivity\nwhy would you quit that [ __ ] man\nbut positivity comes from your gaming\nbuds right like when you school those\nnoobs when you carry those [ __ ] ease in\nyour MOBA game of choice like wall or\ndota or whatever like when you carry\nthose [ __ ] ease and you like 5 you one\nthem like yeah man\nyou're awesome bro\nthat's great\nyou guys get it so your environment is\nreally important because the people that\nyou hang around with it like think about\nwhy do you think about a particular game\nit's because that's the game that you've\nbeen playing or the people that you've\nbeen hanging out with all talk about\nthat game so you start playing that game\nand then like your your minds become\nthought generating machines when they\nlike about that particular game so\nanything that you spend time thinking\nabout is gonna become a thought\ngenerating machine so then the question\nis like how should you structure your\ntime so that you start generating the\nright kind of thoughts so now we come\nback to study\ngot my headaches so bad chat soon okay\nso what is studying studying is spending\ntime conscious time with particular\nthoughts right so like e equals\nmc-squared y equals MX plus B FG equals\nG M over R squared\nright if you spend time with those\nthoughts that are gonna sink in and\nyou'll learn right studying so other\nthings that you can think about is like\nmeditations\nby marcus aurelius\nright there's the healthy gamer discord\nand if you just spend time in places\nwhere you're like thinking about this\nstuff and thinking about this stuff like\njust let's look at this for a second\nlike people watch this stream and it\nhelps them in life like how does that\nwork I'm not disputing that it does or\nyou can question how much it helps or\nhow much it doesn't work what I'm asking\nyou guys is there are people aren't our\ndiscord and there are people who like\npost on our subreddit and stuff and\nthere are people who are like in our\ncommunity who say that this helps like\nnow what is the mechanism through which\nwatching a youtube video helps you\nright what how it might am I like is so\nsomeone saying cult power sure let's\nconsider that there's a differential\ndiagnosis or a series of possibilities\nthrough which our content helps people\none is my cult like charisma travels\nthrough the internet across space and\ntime literally this sounds pretty cool\nand then you know changes you as a human\nbeing like that doesn't make any [ __ ]\nsense man that's not how it works like\nthat does it\ncalled charisma doesn't travel through\nspace time to affect human beings in\nEurope when I'm sitting here in Texas\nit's just not how it works\nthe reason it helps is because when\npeople literally watch our YouTube\nvideos they're conscious mind is\nthinking new [ __ ] and the more that they\nthink about this kind of stuff like the\nbig advantage is not what I'm teaching\nyou guys but just the fact that you guys\nare thinking about all you function as a\nhuman being\nnow it's gonna happen is how do I work\nthis is how our stream helps because\nthis thought gets implanted and then it\nlevels up and then when you have to do\nthe dishes when you have to shower when\nyou need to work or study instead of the\ngaming bubbling thoughts now this is\nbubbling thoughts and there's a war and\nnow you have to spend a little bit less\nmana to do this thing\nright so just think about that\nokay so that is so let's go back to\nsunny so the last thing to kind of\nunderstand about studying they're all\nkind of sum up right is the first thing\nis that you should study first thing in\nthe morning if at all possible and\nsometimes even people who study super\nlate at night like they actually cross\nover into that more dean's morning\ncircadian rhythm so if you can't wake up\nin the morning that's fine I would still\nsay you should study first thing while\nyour mind is calm or clear a couple of\nother things to think about is that you\nknow generally speaking as you go\nthroughout your day you're gonna\naccumulate experiences that are gonna\nlead to a disturbed or non tranquil mind\nso you know as you you know this is how\nyou start out so this is how you start\nout and this is how you'll end you know\nthe day so the earlier you do it the\nbetter off its gonna be you can also you\nknow reference things like ATP and\ncircadian rhythm and psychological\ninsults stuff like that you guys sort of\nunderstand I think everyone is sort of\nunderstands if you play video games and\nyou tell it's like really hard to be\nfocused on studying if you play video\ngames and you have fun it's really hard\nto be focused on studying because your\nmind is just getting more wound up with\npositive and negative energy and it's\njust not gonna be like calm or tranquil\nso study first thing in the morning\nmorning is better than whenever you no\nother type times of the day but study\nfirst thing when you wake up or with a\nminimum of mentally stimulating activity\nso like reddit Twitter whatever like\nfirst thing in the morning before you\nstudy is death so just stay away from\nall of that social media stuff you need\nto eat something shower and use the\nbathroom brush your teeth whatever if\nyou want to meditate or exercise that's\nfine but don't mentally engage like just\nimagine that you have this beautiful\nmana bar and you also have a buff that\nif you're above 80% mana whatever you\nspend your mind on gets 20% better so\nthe first 20 points of mana actually\nhave the highest yield in terms of what\nyou learn so first thing you should do\nis study\nsecond thing is recognize that you're\nstudying is a process like this right\nit's\nthis is how studying actually works that\nwhat you should do is is it it's like a\nroll of the dice with like certain\nthoughts sinking and other thoughts\nthoughts not sinking and the more\nemotionally activated you are the harder\nit's gonna be to study and so there are\na couple of other things like if you're\nin the right environment someone talked\nabout a library absolutely so like in a\nlibrary the whole point behind a library\nis that or studying sometimes in groups\nright it depends on the person\nor the group that you're in but like you\nknow if you have a mind that's like this\nso what a library is going to do is turn\nit into this\nright and then if you study with a group\nhopefully that'll even become like this\nand then if you meditate you'll end up\nlike this hopefully so sure its\nconcentration its attention but your\nconcentration and attention are\ninfluenced by your emotions in your\nenvironment so like like I study in the\nsame place every single time so when I\nwas in med school I literally I had two\ndesks side by side I only had one\ncomputer which is a laptop like\nliterally what I would do is I take my\nlaptop and I move it from my playing\ndesk where I would play games - like I'd\npick up my laptop and I I mean the power\ncord was between them so I like pick up\nmy laptop and I'd move it to my studying\ndesk and I'd open it up\nI'd grab my books I'd study there and\nthen when I was ready to goof off I'd\nmove my laptop to the other desk\nI'd move it like three feet away even\nnow this see me kind of weird right so\nlook you guys ready even today so here's\nmy setup so here's setup number one look\nat that it's a second computer right\nnext to my first computer so here's my\nfirst computer right so like I've got\nsome books over there some junk but like\nI said I used to just have one and now\nlike that computers old but I do\ndifferent things have different\ncomputers\nokay\nso control your environment control your\ncircumstances control your thoughts the\nthoughts that go in are the thoughts\nthat are going to come out and so set\nyourself up for the right kind of\nthoughts and set yourself up for the\nright kind of thoughts to go in when\nyou're ready to go in and then studying\nis gonna be way easier right so you\ndon't need two computers like you can so\none dude says I made a second PC profile\nperfect for years I just had one\ncomputer but you know have the right\nkind of setup for the right sort of\nthing and don't play where you work and\ndon't work where you play and don't\nsheet where you eat and don't think\nwhere your [ __ ] so like separate those\nthings in your mind and studying will\nget better okay\nokay so let's take a quick break\nhopefully that was just have\nself-control no that is for the person\nwho says just have self-control that's\nI'm saying the exact opposite remember\nself-control is expending Manning what\nI'm trying to tell you guys because I\ndon't believe like I don't think\nself-control is a good idea I don't know\nif you guys got this or not the lazy\nperson doesn't actually have more\nself-control\nthey've got thought generating machines\nthat are working for them this is this\nis not more self-control if you think\nthat my answer is just to have more\nself-control you're missing the entire\npoint of this lecture my point is that\nwhat you plant down here reduces the\nneed for self-control remember this\ndiagram says this is self-control right\nhere this is willpower its mana the goal\nis not to do this the goal is to go down\nthis track automatically it's about\nautomatically thinking in the right way\ndoes that make sense it's not just to\nhave self-control dude it's the entire\n[ __ ] opposite so there are times\nwhere you can spend mana to create a\npositive thought environment for\nyourself but like that's fine like you\ncan use self-control to transform a\nnegative thought into a positive thought\nin the moment and spend a large amount\nof mana doing that and that can be good\nbecause then the positive thought will\nalso become a thought generating machine\nin your unconscious but that's not like\na sustainable way to do it that's why\ntherapy is good right that's why\nspending time with other people who\nuplift you is good that's why spending\ntime literally thinking about things\nthat are not the things that keep you\nstuck is good if you literally so I tell\npeople so people ask how do you build\nself-confidence and my best answer is\nyou spend time to nature because when\nyou spend time with nature all of the\nthings that reinforce your lack of\nconfidence or further away it's just you\nlike people don't judge you like the\nreason that nature helps with\nself-confidence is because when you are\naround other people if you have social\nanxiety your mind is going to be\nswimming in self judgmental and socially\nanxious thoughts the more it swims into\nsocially anxious thoughts the further\nthey get planted down to more thoughts\nthey generate this is why I like people\nwith social anxiety feel stuck because\nif they spend time with people it gets\nworse if they don't spend time with\npeople it doesn't get better like I\ndon't even know what to do they're just\nscrewed anyway you try it\nspend time with nature cuz Nature\ndoesn't care who you are nature can't\ncare who you are and for a while you'll\nhave those thought generating machines\nthat generate the negative thoughts\nabout you but unless you have the\nreinforcement of other people generating\nthose thoughts and fueling them it's not\nthat the people even reinforce what you\nbelieve they can tell you the opposite\nbut just even their presence causes you\nto generate the thoughts it's not about\nwhat they say it's about the thoughts\nthat get generated in your mind you just\ncan't generate thoughts about how you're\nwearing the wrong clothing when you're\nsurrounded by trees like you can do it\nfor a little while you can be like man I\nlook like an idiot wearing this you know\nhiking gear and you're gonna think that\nfor a few days but if there are people\naround\nyou just can't keep on thinking that\nlike you literally just can't keep on\nthinking it it just doesn't make sense\nyou just can't do it so structure your\nenvironment so that it propagates the\nright kind of thoughts play it would\nabsolutely become what's true\nit always amazes me how good you guys\nare twisting anything that I try to say\ninto something absolutely ridiculous\nyeah man I'm gonna switch classes from\nyou know being like an IT professional\nto homeless druid because that's what\ndr. K told me to do I'm gonna be a\nhomeless druid cuz that's what he said\nyeah man okay so we're gonna take a\nquick break I'll answer one quick\nquestion about Vata Pitta and kapha it's\na cool question someone asked what are\nthe best studying methods for about the\npathetic offer so it has to do with the\nnumber of breaks that you take so\nbartha's need have intense periods of\nstudy with frequent breaks Fitness can\nstudy for like longer amounts of time\nand gafas probably need to study for\nlonger at a stretch because it takes\nthem a little while to get going so\nduring my two hours of studying I would\nlike you know study four or five\ndifferent subjects I'd spend like 30\nminutes on you know each and I'd switch\nfrequently and so you know four-bit does\nyou you may need to study more than two\nhours guffaws you may want to study more\nto stretch it just kind of depends\nyou"
