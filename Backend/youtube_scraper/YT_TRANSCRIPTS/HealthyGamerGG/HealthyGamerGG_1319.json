    "transcript": "all right so what's your name buddy\nmy name is very impossible to pronounce\nin English okay it's it's what a chili a\nchili yeah it's very hard if you wanna\njust call me Cory I think that might be\nbetter cordless for the screen\ncall you what fine Corky Corky it's how\nI'm usually for an evening game and\nwhatnot yeah okay cool man\nand and so help and so tell me about\nwhat we're kind of talking about today I\nthink we had mentioned something about\nsociopathy so you think that sort of\nfits with who you are yeah when I did\nthe forms I fit in I had like a couple\noptions that I could talk about most of\nthem I think I already worked on okay\nmultiple streams so I thought I would go\nwith the most important one I think\nabout me and also too when I least\nworrying about or like talk to anyone\nabout like of all of them okay so tell\nme tell me tell me what you so what are\nyou concerned about or what what are we\ntalking about here what why do you feel\nlike you're a sociopath what does that\nmean to you to me means like more\nmanipulative oh no wait and also that I\ndon't really have it's not that that\nsounds wrong it's not like I don't have\nemotions but I don't show them as easily\nand usually just don't you kind of mimic\nin a way other people's emotions so like\nif I am with people that are sad I'm\ngonna feel sad in a way\nand if I'm with people that are happy\nI'm gonna be more happy or just in\ngeneral I'm just gonna be like what\never well okay I had peanuts Tech just\nleavin okay so can you help me\nunderstand what you mean so yeah so I\nthink that's that's all you know I think\nreally appropriate stuff for us to talk\nabout let me just kind of repeat back\nwhat I heard so it sounds like you do\nfeel emotions but that you mirror a lot\nof the emotions that you see around you\nmm-hmm and that you feel like you're\nkind of manipulative yeah okay so we can\ntalk a little bit about so we can talk a\nlittle bit about you know what you feel\nand why you mirror and things like that\nso we can talk about emotions and let's\nwe can also talk about manipulation do\nyou have a preference about what you\nwant to talk about first I guess can\nstart the potions\nokay so tell me more yeah can you tell\nme yeah can you tell me a little bit\nmore about that like how I feel yeah\nsure yeah I think like I don't know how\nother people feel exactly but I think I\nhave like this standing see off just\ndefault to not feeling I guess the way I\ncould put it so like in general when I\nam you know day-to-day basis I'm just\nlike fine right I'm not feeling happy\nenough and said I'm just your\nemotionally neutral yeah I guess so\nokay but then it kind of changes\ndepending on who I'm with so like for\nexample if I'm with my sister who has\nlike a tendency of being more towards\nthe sad side I'm gonna be more like said\nI'm gonna be more down I'm gonna eat\nglass him why not and when I'm like\nhaving an argument with someone for\nexample like if I discuss something with\nmy girlfriend have a fight or whatever\nand she's very sad by it I'm gonna ease\nthat about it you like the same way she\nis\ndo you even if I'm not really sad so do\nyou feel sad or do you act sad yeah\nthat's that's kind of like the issue I\ncan't really tell I feel like sometimes\nI'm just acting and sometimes I think\nI'm actually just you know like coughing\nit you're just acting it I it's very\nhard for me truth so this is something\nthat's very important okay cuz like let\nme explain this so if you feel things\nthat other people feel you're actually\nnot a sociopath at all you're the\nopposite so if you're if you are\nempathic so if we think about sociopathy\nthe way that I understand it is that\nyour capacity to feel what other people\nare feeling is actually low so I'm I'm a\npsychiatrist and sometimes I can sit\nwith people that are suicidal and they\nwant to kill themselves and if I was\nvery very empathic or if I was if my\nempathy was uncontrolled I would feel\nreally suicidal too\ndoes that make sense like empathy is\nfeeling what someone else is feeling so\nwhen you say when my sister is sad I\nfeel sad too if I'm around her so in\norder for me to do my job I have to be\nable to not feel what other people are\nfeeling does that make sense now the\ntricky thing I did god no I think it's\nactually more like acting in the sister\nexample was kind of about one okay I\ndidn't see when my sister said is\nactually just like acting in a different\nway than usual cuz I'm I'm usually very\nreserved like I'm I'm working myself\nmore like doing my own things minding my\nown business so when she calls and she\nsaid it since she wants to talk to me or\nshe's just getting down in general and I\nwant to help her which is actually kind\nof rare but what's kind of real I feel\nlike if like me wanting to help her I\nusually just venture ignore it because\nshe has because uh it's very hard to\ndeal with her so I can't you just avoid\nit basically so when I I want you help\nher\nI can't you like a more fun extrovert\njust like more of a funny person in a\nway right so why would a chameleon is oh\nI know\nthe animal is yes yeah are you a\nchameleon do you change your colors\nbased on what other people around you\nlook like I guess no way yeah right so\nlike the thing about a chameleon is you\ncan stick it on a you know a green plant\nand it'll turn green and you can stick\nit on a gray or brown plant and it'll\nturn brown is that what you do you\nchange your colors to match the people\naround you yeah pretty much yes so\nalways like sometimes I have I feel like\nmore self-conscious about it anything\nlike am i just acting all the time like\nam I just basically making characters\nfor each situation and all like I'm with\nmy friends I'm this kind of person when\nI girlfriend them this kind family this\nyeah sometimes step that's thing that\nbothers me\nwhat bothers you is that it's like what\nif I am just acting you know like in my\nwho am I in a way right because if I'm\njust a bunch of character to different\npeople which one of those characters is\nme right because it can be three\ndifferent people I I need to be one who\ndo you think what is it I don't know\nwhat's it like to not level you are yeah\nit's it's weird\nI wouldn't say it's necessarily bad\nbecause being like adaptive in a way is\ngood and kind of\ndealing with the whole manipulation\nthing it's usually good for me you like\nthat\ntell me what you mean by manipulative\nyeah so like I think a good example\nwould be how I am like in college and\nwhy not like I don't care about people\nor like whoever's in my class I don't\nmake friends with in or anything I just\ndidn't you move towards then been you\nknow act like I care about him and I\nlike them and we're not when it's useful\nto me like if I know there's a an\nassignment any to do like some homework\nright English like if there's some\nhomework that I need to do and it's in\ngroups I know I need some more people so\nI go looking for our people and act like\nno hey what's up i doing i like\nconnecting with them just for the moment\nbasic just to make a groove get rid of\nthe homework and then I'm done I don't\ncare about them don't talk [ __ ] in so\nthat's like that one of the ways how do\nyou feel about that naughty I just\nreally don't mind it it's just useful so\nyeah yeah so it sounds like when when\nyou when someone can when you need\nsomething from someone you can be really\nnice to them and when you're done\nneeding people your don't really\nmaintain much of a relationship yeah and\nthat's the way I am with my family as\nwell yeah like I don't really send\nmessages true because I'd only ever my\ndad my parents anymore\nI live with like my my grandma's house\nso basically I just talk to them when I\nneed money or something like it sounds\nawful\nyeah and I know like probably saying\nlike wow how selfish and whatever I\ndon't know I just can't control it I\njust think I just think you do that you\nknow just watch people get what I need\noff them and then just like research I'm\nnot caring about anything okay\nso so I know this is gonna sound kind of\nweird but let's just acknowledge that it\ndoes sound awful it doesn't mean that it\nis awful right and let's remember that\nwe're not here to judge you\nwe're not here to say that you're a bad\nperson and I think it actually requires\na lot of courage to share what you've\nshared and it does kind of sound like\nyou're sort of like associate that you\nknow and and and so let's try to\nunderstand what that means and let's try\nto understand where that comes from\nbecause you you may not be right so I\nthink that we think about the term\nsociopath is like black or white right\nlike like you are or you aren't but\nthat's not the way that I see it so just\nto share a little bit I'm gonna try to\ntake the pressure off of you for a\nsecond and talk about myself just so you\ncan kind of you know cuz I know you've\nshared a couple of things that can make\npeople feel very judgmental or maybe you\nfeel vulnerable so I'm gonna just talk\nabout myself for a second is that okay\nso they can judge me too all right so\nthe first thing is that like you know I\nI think that empathy so I just want to\ngo back to this idea of empathy okay so\nempathy is the capacity to feel what\nother people feel and they're a couple\nof really interesting sorry I'm tired\nbut you know there are a couple of\ninteresting things that you can look at\nwith empathy where so when you like\nwatch a youtube video let's say and you\nsee someone get kicked in the nuts a lot\nof people have like an empathic reaction\nto that and what they do is you know\nthey'll feel something in themselves why\nare you smiling because like the first\nthing when you say about that I remember\nseeing like videos off just with my\nfriends up like people getting karma in\na way right so try to do something\nbetter someone they just okay until it's\nas you said or something and just like I\nalways just laugh at it and\nyeah mine yeah I think it's just so-so\nempathy is like so people who have high\namounts of empathy feel the pain of\nother people and so you know when you\nwatch a YouTube video where someone\ngetting kicked in the nuts sometimes\nlike you kind of cringe and you're like\noh it's gonna hurt and then then so\nthat's what empathy is it's being able\nto feel what someone else feels now the\ninteresting thing is that you were\nsaying that you know when your sister is\naround and she is feeling sad then you\nkind of feel sad too but that means one\nof two things if you're actually feeling\nsad that make that lowers you on the\nsociopathy scale but if you're acting\nsad that elevates yong-seok sociopathy\nscales so on the outside you know you\ncould be act the question is you\nactually feel sad when she feel sad\nbecause that means you're really not\nsociopathic we're very sociopathic at\nall but if you genuinely do feel so I\nmean if you do feel sad that means that\nyou're empathic and if you don't feel\nsad and you act sad that is a little bit\nmore on the socio sociopathic side does\nthat make sense yeah and and what I\nfound in myself is that like I used to\nbe more like you but then through\nbecause it sounds like you really do act\nsad instead of feeling sad and and let's\njust also acknowledge for a moment that\nyou know not having empathy does not\nmake you a good or a bad person so you\nknow a lot of times if you kind of think\nabout it in a weird way if people feel\nempathic then it's easier for them to be\ngood people because they have a force in\ntheir body that is pushing them to make\nlike you know help other people so that\nif the other person is less sad then I\nfeel less sad so my helping them is in a\nweird way driven by my own sadness does\nthat make sense it's actually in a weird\nway far more difficult or even far more\nmoral to be moral and not feel those\nfeelings so then you're helping someone\nreally because it's a good thing to help\nthem and not because you have an\ninternal compass that's pushing you to\nhelp them does that make sense\nyeah so in a weird way I'd say if you\ntry to help your sister and you don't\nfeel any empathy for her I actually\nthink you deserve more credit than\nsomeone who feels empathy because the\nempathy is pushing that person and it\nmay not be pushing you so I don't think\nthat good and evil has anything to do\nwith sociopathy does that make sense\nhmm okay so anyway in my case what I\nsort of have have learned how to do is\nopen up my emotions and close them off\nso I can kind of turn on and off my\nempathy which is like required for my\njob so there are times where I let\nmyself feel things with people which is\nsomething that I had to learn how to do\nbecause I didn't feel I mean I had a lot\nof emotions like I had anger and\nresentment and shame do you feel those\nthings no really I mean at least like\nI'm I'm always very neutral okay I don't\nreally feel angry or do you have trouble\nby going to sleep\nno okay yeah I have my habits like just\nleave like leave a video clean your son\nyes okay dad okay is it okay if I ask\nyou a couple more questions to get sort\nof a better sense of your relationships\nwith various people yeah okay so I just\nwanted to explain a couple things now\nwe'll kind of go back to collecting some\nmore information okay so can you tell me\na little bit about your sister yeah she\nhas I don't think it's diagnosed yet but\nshe's more than likely has borderline\npersonality yeah okay yeah so she more\nthan likely has it and it's very hard\nshe treated as I'm sure yep and what may\n- isn't that she has borderline\npersonality disorder\nthough a she acts in general and how\nlike she doesn't\nshe takes a lot lots of medicine she\nkind of help her and it doesn't work as\nhe wouldn't what is the medicine\ndesigned to help her with do you know I\nthink it's for depression mania as well\nand she takes when she sleep\nbecause she has another issue I don't\nknow the name in English at all but it's\nbasically when she sleeps her legs\nrestless leg syndrome yeah she has that\nshoe so she has taken myself and thing\nshe takes like three antidepressants I\nthink she thinks Leitrim okay right yeah\ntakes that you and yeah she's very\nimpulsive by she'll do things without\neven okay what kind of like what's it\nlike being her brother uh it's mostly\nwhatever because I don't live right so\nshe wasn't like that when I was back\nhome cuz I moved to another city my\ngrandma's house to the college so you\nknow was back home she wasn't like that\nso it was fine like she would get angry\nsometimes but that would be a you know\nbecause she was younger as well\nnow she's 15 I think now she's what yeah\nfifteen she'll be 15 this year actually\nOh boys so she's young how old are you\nyeah I am 22 okay\n21 actually 21 wait no I'm Twitter I\nalways get lost my age I don't know I\nkind of stopped counting after 20 okay\nso I'm actually pretty sure yeah so\nshe's 15 and no yeah because of the\nissues she has she already like tried\nsuicide 19 three times maybe I was like\nwith medicine take a lot of Medicine she\nhurts herself now\nshe's doing it last because she kind of\nreplaced it with cigarettes\nit's your addiction right so yeah and\nbasically we you know I say we because\nI'm not thinking about me and my parents\ncuz I try to like help them it wasn't\ntry to help them because it it's like\ntroublesome if you have someone like\nthat right someone who can like you can\ncount with no way watch my parents need\nhelp she's not doing she she's probably\ndo the opposite and just knowing that\nthey actually keep worrying about her\nlike and how much time and money they\nhave to like waste on her basically I'm\nusing some terms without thinking a lot\nabout them no I think it's good that\nyou're doing that so so let's think\nabout that for a second right so it\nseems like you feel like to a certain\ndegree a lot of the effort that people\nmake to help her isn't gonna help and\nlet's be clear I mean that's not that\ndoesn't make you an [ __ ] it sounds\nlike many people have tried to prescribe\nher different kinds of medication that\nyou guys have tried a lot of stuff so\nit's not illogical for it to sort of for\nyou to recognize that a lot of this\nstuff isn't really helping but why do\nyou try to help yeah as I said it's\nbecause like hey I just don't want to\nhave someone like that in the family\nlike someone so I'm reliable and\nuncontrollable and someone who is like\nalways so down you know way and also\nsomeone who just like keeps making my\nparents worry and everything why does it\nmatter if your parents worry well\nI don't know just upsets me that they\nhave to like keep worrying about that\nthat they can have like East\nwhat what's upsetting be you know that\nthey can't have peace what does that\nbother you I don't know I feel like\neveryone should like have times should\njust be with themselves and not worrying\nabout something but they basically in\nand it's also I guess because of how\nmuch he actually cuz the they worried\nabout her but not just about her now\nthey also worried aloud about her future\nright because she doesn't go to school\nbasically because of the Lexx of lack of\nsleep not like I said she sleeps a lot\nactually\nso she yeah this is cool yeah and yeah\nthat's can you tell me a little bit I'm\nsorry no that's like putting her behind\nyou know it right so she won't go to\ncollege the time she should be going\nsister I I guess I used to care more\nbefore like before I realized how much\nof her how much I can't help her because\nI feel like you know no matter what I\nsay to her what I do or whatever\nshe just reset he sets actually you know\nmmm and suicidal he just I think they\nlike cigarettes or whatever it is she's\nbecomes like caring about her is futile\nthere's there's not point to it\nbasically can you use\nlike that something like my parents\nactually sadly kind of went through a\nlittle bit an out there trying hard\nagain I guess Chile you know find\nsomething to make her stop blink those\nthings yeah\nthey also made sure like a little bit of\na phase off oh I don't we don't think we\ncan do anything to help her let's just\nyou know keep her let her smoke\ncigarettes and why not let her skip\nschool\nwe can do anything we can wake her out\nokay and make her to go to school so you\nknow and if you if we like actually when\nI tried to try to reduce at least a\ncigarette she was looking every day like\nit wouldn't work for like a little bit\nand then she would be just like hey give\nme more you know it would be like no I\nalready have had enough you know you\nshouldn't have anymore\nand she would just be like no give me\nmore or you know what I'm gonna do\nanything she would coach the bathroom\nand cut herself right so I there there's\nnothing I can do\nin a way sure is if I don't take the\ncigarettes off she cut yourself it's\nlike worse yeah at least and she's\nalways saying things like oh and I'm 18\nI'm gonna kill myself and I'm like just\nlike why like I don't I can't really get\nher point of view I'm gonna just\nsecond is that okay\ndo you feel hurt or any no really\nokay I'm gonna say two words I'm not\nquite sure if they'll make sense\ncaregiver burnout do you know what\nburnout is yeah I'm still gonna be about\nit\nokay and and what I'm detecting is to a\ncertain degree I think like caregiver\nburnout so this happens with people who\nhave BPD where the people who love them\neventually just burn out because they\ntry to help and they try to help and\nthey try to help and then you know they\njust kind of become numb and they kind\nof throw their hands up and they sort of\nstop trying and then especially with\nparents they can sort of like you know\nthey're kind of like neutral for a while\nthey're kind of burnt out and then their\nenergy starts to build back up and then\nthey start caring again and they start\ntrying again and things like that so you\nknow as as much as you know I know\nyou're saying a lot of things that are\ngonna make people think that you're an\n[ __ ]\nwhat I'm really detecting from you in a\ncertain way is actually that your\nempathic numbness is to a certain degree\nprotective because you've sort of\nlearned that caring doesn't help what do\nyou think about that\nI don't know because like I never really\nlike work myself up where like I never\neven do I say like yeah of course trench\nhelper and that was very tiring delayed\nright cuz I I tried to make her stop and\nthen didn't work but that was most more\nuh best month and of thing or what kind\nof any like couple best marks okay\nthat's true bones you know that's when I\nwas trying to help for and even before\nthen I already felt like this Betty this\nas you say okay so I'm not sure maybe\nokay meaning more self-conscious to\nbeard so it sounds like you felt you\nfelt pretty numb but before tried to\nhelp her yeah yeah and I think that that\nmakes sense right because you know I\ndon't think that your your patterns in\ncollege around like group homework and\nthings like that\nthen that's obviously not caregiver\nburnout right and and so I I'm not\nsaying that it's all caregiver burnout\nit's just I was exploring that because\nit seems like I mean you said that you\nused to care more or that you used to\ntry more and it sounds like you know a\nlot of the reason that you try is\nbecause you're concerned about your\nparents and that they shouldn't have to\ntry this alone and at the same time what\nI'm kind of hearing you say is push back\na little against the idea of burnout\nmaybe that's what happened to your\nparents but you didn't really burn out\nyou just realized it was kind of a waste\nof time is that a better characteristic\nokay a better way to put it yeah okay\nokay so sounds like maybe not so much\nburnout on your end and and maybe just\nrealized it was futile yeah so can you\ntell me a little bit about your parents\nyes my mom as bipolar disorder okay\nshe makes I don't know\nmedicine she should be taking medicine\nshe goes to a psychologist yeah yeah but\nit never really worked out what does\nthat mean like she never got better\nshe's always do this kind of she's a lot\nlike my sister anyway like my family\nit's me my dad my mom and my sister and\nbasically they away our family works is\nlike I'm like my dad no way I'm calm\nmore often tonight and my mom is more\nunstable my sister is just like her\nright so if she gets angry she's gonna\nact on it she's gonna break things like\nher wardrobe is broken down basically\nshe's like no doors\nOh true that about the work do you think\nyour mom may have have BPD I don't think\nso okay well because when I think of a\nPD I think it's much more extreme right\nit's more just do your mom have periods\nof like for like weeks to months where\nshe's basically normal don't be okay so\nI'm gonna educate a little bit okay so\nonce again this isn't like medical\nadvice but I'm just gonna explain sort\nof the differences in Diagnostics\nbetween borderline personality disorder\nand and bipolar disorder okay so this is\nsomething that's very poorly understood\nso a lot of times people with with\nborderline personality get diagnosed as\nbipolar so what people think bipolar\nmeans like I'll get a lot of people will\ncome to me and say I'm bipolar and I'll\nask you what do you mean by that and\nthey're like I'm happy one minute and\nI'm [ __ ] pissed off the next minute\nand the next day I'm super depressed and\nthe next day I'm super happy that's not\nactually bipolar disorder so bipolar\ndisorder is a mood disorder that is\ncharacterized by weak\nof month or months of an episode of\nfeeling a particular way so people who\nhave sorry my kid is screaming outside\nso uh sorry it's distracting can I have\na second okay I think we should be good\nsorry about that guys so what I was\ngonna say is that bipolar disorder and\nmood disorders are episodic which means\nthat it's it's a mood that lasts for\nweeks at a time so in bipolar disorder\nfor example people will have manic or\nhypomanic episodes which is days two\nweeks of having like a very high mood or\nbeing like super active not sleeping you\nknow it'll last weeks followed by\nusually a crash of like weeks two months\nof depression it's not like super happy\none day super sad the next day it's like\nthree weeks of happiness followed by\nthree months of sadness\nso it's an episode with borderline\npersonality disorder what we get is\nsomething called\nemotional instability or mood\ninstability so their mood fluctuates a\nlot more over the course of a day or is\nunstable like over the course of hours\nso a lot of you know when people come to\nme and they say I'm bipolar and then\nthis is the unfortunate thing is that\nyou know a lot of these people end up\ngetting medication but the medications\nlike lithium mood stabilizers can help\nin terms of emotional instability but\ngenerally speaking you know medications\nlike lithium prevent or reduce the long\nepisodes so if someone is depressed for\nlike let's say six months and I start\nthem on lithium my hope would be that\nthey like you know over the next couple\nof weeks they come out of that\ndepression and they don't get depressed\nfor months again it doesn't actually\nchange how you know quickly their mood\nshifts over the course of an hour it\nprevents whatever neuro chemistry\nchanges\nkeep people depressed for months does\nthat make sense so when thinking about\nthat do you have a sense of whether your\nmom's moods shift like over the course\nof days I mean sorry like minutes 2\nhours 2 days are we talking like weeks\ntwo months yeah I think it would be more\ndays it's just that like when I think of\nborderline I think more about like\naddiction to drugs or alcohol yep\nmultiple relationships thing yeah yeah\nso so you know it I'm not saying that\nyour mom isn't bipolar\nMinoo cuz obviously she's working with\nthe clinician and the clinician is gonna\nknow way much more than I do in terms of\nwhat her actual statuses like and\nsometimes people have BPD and bipolar\nthey can be borderline and bipolar like\nthose two things can exist together my\npoint though is that you know it's not\nuncommon for me to hear stories of mom\nwith bipolar daughter who's bipolar but\nit turns out that daughter is actually\nborderline or son is borderline her mom\nis borderline and really it's all\npersonality pathology it's not like a\ndiscrete neurochemical imbalance that\nthen corrects itself over time which is\nthe way that I think about a mood\ndisorder so I think about borderline\npersonality disorder or sociopathy or\nantisocial personality disorder is the\nway that your brain is wired it's like\nthe way that your brain is whereas a\nmood disorder I think about a change in\nfunction so it's the way that that your\nbrain operates for a particular period\nof time does that make sense yeah so one\nis like the foundation it's the\nstructure and one is an operation so\nmood disorder is the way that your brain\nfunctions for a period of time then it\ngoes back to functioning normally and a\npersonality disorder and that's why we\ncall it personality because it's part of\nwho you are right Korky when we listen\nto you you're kind of saying I don't\nknow who I am\nthat's not an episode\nthat doesn't like come and go that's\nlike who you are you don't have a clear\nsense of your identity and it sounds\nlike what you end up doing is it since\nyou don't have a clear sense of your\nidentity you adopt the identities of\npeople around\nthat's the chameleon right so people are\nsad you're gonna be sad if people are\nhappy you're gonna play the part you're\ngonna fit in because you don't know so\nwhat color is a chameleon really I think\nit's great see no one close right like\nthat's the whole problem it's like you\ndon't know like I don't know what color\nI really am and like how can you yeah\nyou know who knows right so what kind of\nget to that does that make sense about\nlike BPD and and bipolar and borderline\nand all that kind of stuff yeah okay I\nthink I should just add my dad actually\nkind recently got diagnosed with bipolar\n- he had like was almost it was actually\na psychotic episode okay right where he\nwas hearing things that weren't there he\nwas seeing things that weren't there\nbecause traumatic experience he had and\nthen he went actually took clinic for\ntwo weeks I think was like journalized\nyeah like hospitalized actually he\nstayed yeah yeah that sounds weak side\ncharacter yep that yeah he's taking me\nto my sister okay that sounds like\nbipolar to me so usually people like\nhaving so that too is if we think about\nthat it's a discrete episode right so it\nsounds like your dad isn't usually like\nthat and something happened to him and\nthen he changed the way that his he was\nfunctioning the way his mind was\nfunctioning the way his brain was\nfunctioning and he started acting a\ndifferent way it sounds like he needed\nintense treatment for a certain amount\nof time and then hopefully he's back to\nnormal and and by the way dude it sounds\nlike I mean that's rough bro\nlike it sounds like you\na lot of people in your family who\nreally struggle and and that can't be\neasy\nyeah it's kinda funny I think I like all\nof them have like something like some\nkind of mental disorder in Stewart and I\njust kind of don't at least not\ndiagnosed or never had any like issues\nthat made me like actively look for like\nmm-hmm how do you feel about that\nstruggling in college I I think it's\njust funny like honest it's the same way\nlike not necessarily physically not in\nappearance not different like I'm a\ndoctor or something okay it's like all\nof them have Nietzsche wear glasses\nyeah like t-shirts right and I never did\nmy vision was always like perfect since\nforever\nmm-hmm even with me like always being on\nthe computer and always playing games\nand whatnot I never thought worse hmm\nso I think it's very just interesting to\nme like how even though I'm part of the\nfamily I'm kind of completely different\nof them yeah okay kind of makes sense\nright I mean I can imagine how it would\nbe difficult to form connections with\npeople like that if you feel different\ndoes that make sense\nlike you just don't you feel like you're\nkind of an outsider can you tell me so\nyou said that your mom and your sister\nis similar in some ways are you and your\ndad similar did I did I catch that right\nyeah\nin what way he's very like his preserved\nand quiet and true himself and you know\nalso likes green beans like like I got\nthat from him I guess what right now he\njust please FIFA okay\nand what do you play just Oh I currently\nam playing you either flashings alight\nfriendship yeah you're an awfully have\nabsolutely [ __ ] sociopath man I tell\nyou what like that's that's all the\ndiagnostic information acne but\nseriously I don't diagnose or treat\nmental illnesses on stream yeah that was\na joke so so tell me in what way so you\nyou get your reserved you guys both play\ngames what and what other ways do you\nthink you're similar to your dad are you\nguys touch basically mm-hm can you tell\nme what growing up was like for you I\nmean it was easy I guess like I never\nhad any issues in school or anything\nkinda like in high school I had oh like\nthe three years of high school that me\nsorry like that was like from 2012 to\n2014 I was very lazy in school I guess\nit's kind of normal for teenagers that\nage like I'm rarely ever did any\nhomework mm-hmm as I was to explain I\nkind of thought my priorities on like\nyou know having fun playing games over\nanything school related right on because\nI didn't like oh I didn't like to call\nit the course that I was thinking like\nit was just very not what I wanted to do\nsure so to kind of avoid that or escape\nfrom that just bleep me alright so I\nfailed some classes that I had to retake\nnext year but I still completed it in\ntime okay fine then what are you\nstudying in college psychology actually\nnot surprised yeah last year now yeah\nand and what do you want to do with that\nlike when I started it I felt like I was\nfor sure gonna go for like cleaning\nstuff just like people win absolutely\nyeah psychoanalysis we saw that one cuts\nmy fourth then like less two years I\nthink I've been kind of changing my mind\nlike I want to work we like eSports\nmaybe or like marketing somehow like I\nwanna like different things don't really\nsee myself in a clinic all day every day\nlike I don't think it really fits me\nanymore so we don't usually give career\nadvice on stream but one thing that I\nwould say so a lot of people want to\nwork in eSports and just a little bit of\ncareer advice it helps to actually have\na concrete skill right so I I work in\neSports but the reason that I work in\neSports is because I have something\nconcrete to offer and believe me eSports\nfolks definitely need mental health\nsupport it's a very high-stress\nprofession and so I don't know that you\nknow I think that if you don't want to\nwork in a clinic that's fine but I think\nit definitely helps to have a concrete\nlike skill if you want to work in\neSports and I work with a lot of stress\nmanagement kind of stuff so I work with\nprofessional physical athletes as well\nand and you know I wouldn't I wouldn't\nif you really like you know if you like\nthe mind and you like to understand this\nstuff and things like that I don't think\nthat that precludes you so you know if\nyou think about it like physical sports\nthey have like physical trainers right\nthey have coaches I think one of the\nbiggest things that's missing in eSports\nis that they don't have like mental\nhealth coaches that's what they need\nbecause they're stresses are like mental\nand obtaining flow state staying in flow\nStates understanding team dynamics and\nteam friction and managing egos and\nunderstanding feelings and you know if\nsomebody feels like they're gonna get\nkicked how does that affect their\nperformance how does that affect the way\nthat they interact with their team and\nthen the sad thing is they're afraid\nthey're going to\nkicked they have anxiety about getting\nkicked and then their performance drops\nit causes friction in the team and then\nwhat happens Courtney yeah okay\nabsolutely right and it's a\nself-fulfilling prophecy and if they if\nthere's one thing that's missing in\neSports in the video game industry in\ngeneral it's like people with\npsychological training because they have\na bunch of marketing people right like\nthey're pretty good at that stuff what\nthey don't have is is actually so some\nsome teams actually do have team\npsychologists and those teams actually\nthere's some interesting anecdotal\nevidence that those teams far outperform\nteams that don't have that so they're\nthey're a couple of teams and you guys\ncan do your research or I can talk about\nit later if you all really want that\nthat work with psychologists and their\ntheir performance is very good so I\nwouldn't I wouldn't toss the\npsychological stuff out the window if\nyou're interested in these words yeah I\nintend on like at least for the next\ncouple years working in clinics like you\nI get the right specializations yep I'm\nstruggling English I think you're doing\nyeah I kind of want to seek out like the\nright areas of study before I try to\ndive in with sounds good can I ask you a\ncouple more questions about kind of\nupbringing in some of your relationships\nand how you kind of relate to people so\nwhat was it like when you say it was\neasy like do you remember what your\ninteractions with your parents were like\nI mean always good what does that mean\nwell it's because I kind of compare\nmyself like my sister now because she's\ndoing like I saw her growing up and it\ncould compare it like her growing up to\nmy brother and so she's much more like a\nrebel she asks my spared my parents for\nsomething they say no she's gonna annoy\nthem she's gonna like call them names\nshe's gonna be rude to them hurt herself\nto try\nyeah what she wants that's like things I\nnever did which I asked my parents for\nsomething they said no I would just be\nlike yeah that's fine I can just wait\nfor another moment or whatever and like\nso I never had any confrontations with\nthem I was always very behaved do your\nparents love you I guess do you feel\nloved by your parents\nah it's kinda like weird because my dad\nwas always more reserved as I said like\njust like I am like Marcin himself so it\nwas never hugs and kisses and whatnot\nyep\nbut my mom always like showed her how\nmuch she cared about me now I guess like\nwhen you get older it kind of changes a\nlot yes physical it smart you can feel\nit easier did you know that your mom\ngrowing up did you kind of know that you\nweren't sure what kind of mom you were\ndealing with look was there like a nice\nmom and an angry mom yeah I was always\nvery self-aware yeah and so did it feel\nto you like sometimes that love was sort\nof like a switch that could be turned on\nand off I I guess you know wait but the\nsame time like even when she wasn't\nready I knew she still like cared about\nme how did you know that because like\nevery time like if she was very angry at\nme for some reason\nwhich was very rare okay always good\nthings I guess uh like after she got\nshe's [ __ ] by God not firing me or\nanything she would just ten minutes\nlater she would come and apologize and\nsay how much she felt bad for it how\nmuch she loved me and yeah\nhow do i spawn to that yeah we just be\nlike yeah it's okay I know you didn't\nmean it\nI and do you have any idea what would\nhave happened if you if you didn't say\nit was okay I don't know I mean I guess\ncould make her like me again or I\nwouldn't make sense for a mission like\nsay it's not fine cuz he really was just\nlike stupid things never like me big\nnever got hit like something impactful I\nguess I was just like raise your voice\nnot really okay I guess like only\nrealize seven or something like some\nsnaps into play that's about it\nI don't remember okay so it sounds like\nyou you know got along well with your\nparents can you tell me a little bit\nabout your girlfriend my household uh\nshe's great\nlike she cares a lot about me I can tell\nlike how can you tell she's always\nsaying it and she always shows like how\nshe acts that I like I'm very important\nto her you know is she important to uh\nyeah yeah how do you know so I miss her\na lot like if I I stay like long times\naway from her liked her a lot\nyeah I can't really go a day or two we\nare speaking to her something how do you\nfeel like Isis beautiful how do you feel\nwhen when a day or two passes without\nspeaking to her\nnever happened back I've been dating her\nfor two years\nhey like we had a little bit of\ninterruption because I was very I guess\nit was like one of those moments where I\ngot self-aware like I said like you know\nin my acting you like Who am I so I kind\nof thought that was me very bad like for\nher right there you know I mean I'm not\nsure who I am so how can I say for sure\nthat I love her so like I told her that\nyou know we should just take some time\nbasically and we spend I think two weeks\nthat I just put in touch her whatever\nand I was very like wasn't good for me\nto like realize that I misheard that I\nneeded that that I need her her fight\nfor me and like it was very bad for her\nshe got like very sad wouldn't like do\nanything basically got very depressed\nbenefit hmm no but I feel bad\nabout it even now because I know even\nthough we're back together and\neverything's back to normal I know that\nI still hurt her right I think that what\nfeels wrong about the interstate\nuh I don't know just like she didn't\ndeserve to be hurt and you said you\nbecame self-aware what did you become at\nur of of how I was from the different\ndifferent scenarios\nlike we saw her I'm someone compelled\nbecome someone else help me understand\nwhy that would lead you to take a break\nfrom your relationship to kind of\nexplore that why would you do that what\ndifference does it take to her or to\nyour relationship if you don't know who\nyou are\nstinking face good think yeah I don't\nknow I guess it really didn't make a\ndifference for her but in my like in my\nmind I was thinking what if this really\nships just like butyl ice right cuz\nwhat's wrong with that what isn't wrong\nwith that a relationship building lies\nthat's great so I don't know I just I\nwouldn't want to be in a relationship\nwith someone who is like blind to me\nit's not the person sure but she's not\nlying to you\nwould you want to be a relationship\nwhere you lied or I other oh why not\nit's not good\nlies are not good when I mean right like\nlying tricky that Santa Claus is real is\nokay but lies in general or not so corgi\ndo you think people still think you're\nan [ __ ] right now how do you sound I\ndon't think so right so so can I share a\ncouple of thoughts with you yep\nso for some reason I feel like maybe\ntaking a little bit more of an\neducational approach to help you\nunderstand maybe why you are the way you\nare and what could be going on with you\nand and also kind of try to tie things\ntogether a little bit is that okay I I\nbasically have a hypothesis at this\npoint that I'd like to share and you\nknow I don't maybe the reason that I\nwant to share my hypothesis is because I\nhave enough information to form one so I\ndon't know I mean I would love to\ncontinue talking to you more we could\ntalk more but I think I basically gotten\na an idea of what I think is going on is\nthat is it okay to share that okay\nso the first thing to understand is that\nI don't think you're a sociopath I think\nyou have so I don't really buy into that\nterm to begin with but I think that the\nway that you relate to other people in\nthe way that you feel about yourself\ndeveloped in an environment that really\ndidn't give you a sense of identity or\nhow to relate to other people and I\nthink what we see from your girlfriend\nis actually strong evidence that you're\nnot a sociopath but you still don't\nquite understand like what the [ __ ] is\ngoing on there like you don't understand\nyour feelings because you've never had\nyou haven't had many situations like\nthis before because it sounds like you\nvery genuinely care about her it sounds\nlike you feel guilty for hurting her and\nyou feel bad about that those are not\nthings that we think about sociopaths\ndoing so I think that essentially what\nhappened is you were raised in a\nparticular way and I'll state I'll say\nwhat that is and so your parents didn't\ndo anything wrong by the way it's just\nyou grew up in a particular environment\nwhere literally your brain learned how\nto relate to people in a particular way\nand it didn't learn how to be empathic\nfor good reasons and now you're like new\nempathy and you don't quite know what it\nis but you definitely are like growing\nup in terms of your empathy with your\ngirlfriend does that make sense so let's\ntry to understand why that happens so\nlet's start by understanding like how do\nhuman beings learn empathy if you\nlearned about any of this stuff in your\npsychology class\nI think so okay any-any and the ideas\nare you want me to just launch into\nlecture mode go ahead okay\nso let's just start by understanding how\nto human beings how do like children\nlearn how they feel so you know if a kid\nlike falls down and they scrape their\nknee how does everyone react to the kid\nyeah I'll get all wet sorry\nworried yeah okay but like is the kid\nreally in any danger then why do they\nthey're all like oh my goodness\nOh baby fell down oh my goodness why\ndon't we do that there's no danger to\nthe kid right if you fall in scrape your\nknee this need is everyone around you\ndrop whatever they're doing rushed to\nyou and said oh my god Corgi fell down\nyou scraped your knee oh my god Corgi is\nso hurt why don't why do we do that with\nchildren but we don't do that with it\nweird right so this is what's happening\nin it little baby's brain so little baby\nfalls down and feel certain things and\nthey literally do not understand what\nthey feel right does that make sense\nlike a two-year-old does not understand\nwhat it feels they don't have that\ncapacity so how do Thanks\nso how do children understand what they\nfeel is looking at the emotions of\npeople on the outside and this is why\nadults have exaggerated emotions so that\nthe child if you have a subtle emotion\nthe child can't tell what you're doing\nbut if you have an exaggerated emotion\nliterally what happens in a child's\nbrain is it looks at the worry on your\nface and it correlates that worry with\nwhat it's feeling on the inside and then\nthe child says ah okay this is fear\nthis is worry oh this is happiness\nbecause when a child goes poopoo on the\npotty\neveryone's like good job Corgi you went\na poopoo on the potty in such a big\npoopoo you're such a good boy it's\nexaggerated happiness right and so then\nthe child knows okay this is what pride\nfeels like because they look in someone\nelse's face and they're like okay that's\npride and that's how you express pride\nthis is how you feel pride what I feel\ngets determined by what I see from other\npeople with me it's almost like the\nfacial expressions and emotional\nresponses of adults are like the gold\nstandard or the answer key or the facts\nabout their feelings on the inside with\nme do you understand what like gold\nstandard means yeah okay\nso what do you think happens to a child\nwho has a parent who is completely\nneutral what do you think happens to\ntheir capacity to understand their\nemotions it's not there\nwhy not because you didn't have like an\nexample to follow exactly so we see this\nin in parents so now the interesting\nthing is that so this is this is\nsomething called attachment theory I\ndon't know if you've studied attachment\ntheory but you can kind of look at this\nstuff and basically what what people\nrealized is that like you know the way\nthat emotions are mirrored by parents is\nthe way that children learn their\nemotional self and the way that they\nlearn empathy it's all about mirroring\nso if you want to terrify a child all\nyou have to do is look at a child with a\ncompletely neutral expression and\nthey're gonna start to cry because they\ndon't understand what's going on and\nthen they get confused\nchildren get reassured by seeing\nemotions in their parents so if we think\nabout it you know in a child's falls and\nscrapes their knee and the the parent is\nvery very worried then the child starts\nto you know like they're like okay like\nthe parent is worried and then when the\nparent calms down what does the child do\narms down absolutely right and so like\nyou may have seen this where sometimes\nif a child falls and adults are quick\nenough you can do something when a child\nFalls if you laugh and you make it seem\nfine\nthen the child is happy - they laugh -\nand if you're worried then they start to\ncry you see that their emotions\ninternally to a certain degree or\ndetermined by what happens on the\noutside does that make sense because\nthat's their gold standard so now let's\nthink about you right so your basic\nproblem is that you don't have empathy\nyou don't understand the feelings of\nothers so what one thing that we know\nfrom attachment theory and if you look\nat data children who grow up with\nparents with personality disorders tend\nto have difficulty with empathy and the\nreason is because you have a pretty\nconsistent experience on the inside but\ndepending on how your mom's mood is she\ncan either mirror your experience as\nwell or mirror them poorly does that\nmake sense like if she's having a bad\nday and she's feeling impulsive and\nangry then like you can be feeling bad\nabout yourself and she's not gonna like\nbe able to mirror that or you can be\nfeeling good about yourself and she's\ngonna get pissed at you and I think you\nlearned very very very early on how to\nalmost be manipulative with her what do\nyou think about that does that resonate\nwith you at all like you became the\nmanager of her emotions not the other\nway around and it's weird because when\nshe feels bad about herself who made her\nfeel better\nthat was weird\nI used to think like like especially\nwhen was I'm like 16 onwards I always\nfelt like my mom was more of a teenager\nthan I was absolutely like all things\nstabilities and yeah everything was\nteenager yep absolutely so so adults\nwith BPD feel like teenagers\nto their children and it's it's a really\nstrange thing that happened to you right\nbecause like when you're seven years old\nand your mom has done something mean to\nyou what you basically did is like you\nthink about like you know when a parent\nis mean to a seven year old a seven year\nold should feel very very very hurt\nright and then mom comes to you and\napologizes and then you're hurt kind of\nlike disappears and instead what you are\nis like caring towards her and so what\nhappens is like you lose a connection\nwith yourself what you are becomes less\nimportant than what you need to be for\nher does that make sense\nyeah and that's when the chameleon is\nborn\nthat's when is a seven year old you\nchanged your colors on the outside\nbecause of what your mom needed and you\nbecame what she needed and then you\nlearned this strategy this adaptation\nand I think you use the word adaptive\nwhich i think is a great word you\nadapted to ignoring what's in here and\nbeing what they need out there and then\nwhat happened is you discovered\nsomething very very cool it worked so\nnow you say that you had a good\nupbringing this is the crazy thing you\ndidn't have a good upbringing because of\nyour parents you had a good upbringing\nbecause of you because you learned how\nyou need to essentially manipulate them\nbut it's not really like manipulation\nit's just you recognize that if you do a\nthey're gonna do B and if you do C\nthey're gonna do D and you started\nrelating to other human beings by\nrecognizing that like what you feel is\nnot as important is the way that you act\ntowards them because if you act a\ncertain way you're gonna set your mom\noff and if you don't act a certain way\nyou're not gonna set your mama and then\nwhat we see is your sister doesn't have\nthat capability which is why there's\ntension and sparks always between them\nand it's also kind of interesting\nbecause now this is where where things\nget kind of like interesting because if\nyou look at the system of like western\npsychiatry what they say is that\nnarcissism sociopathy and borderline\npersonality disorder are all linked\nthey all have actually a common root and\nin one person it manifests in this\ndirection it's like a tree can grow\nstraight up it can grow straight to you\ncan grow to the right or it can grow to\nthe left but the root is all the same\nand these are things that are called\ncluster B personality disorders so what\npeople in Western psychiatry have done\nis they've looked at the different kinds\nof personality disorders and they've\nsaid that okay these seem to be kind of\nlike bucketed altogether and then\nthere's cluster a disorders there's\ncluster C disorders but these are all\ncluster B and and so it doesn't surprise\nme at all that you essentially grew up\nyou know in a household where it sounds\nlike your mom has something on the\nborderline personality spectrum your\nsister has something on the borderline\npersonality spectrum and you have\nsomething on the antisocial or\nsociopathic spectrum I don't think it's\nlike just genetics like there may be a\ngenetic component - I don't think you're\na bad person at all I just think that\nthe reason that you feel like you're a\nsociopath is because your emotional\ncircuitry is underdeveloped because very\nearly on you learned that like your\ninternal emotional circuitry it got\nconfused because you didn't get\nappropriate mirroring from your parents\nand we can kind of see that because your\ndad is reserved so you've got neutrality\nfrom him like he may not have been\nexaggerated when you bumped your head\nand then from your mom depending on like\nwhich mom she was you got like an\nappropriate response or an inappropriate\nresponse and this is the crazy thing if\nwe think about like kids or teenagers\nwho have strong identities of self what\nare their parents like but do you know\nsomeone who you think has a strong\nidentity of like who they are that's\nlike someone that you know\nso I'll asked like people who are\nwatching to also just think about who\nyou know who you would describe as\nhaving like a good sense of identity and\nconfident about who they are as a person\nand and think about that person for a\nsecond if you could come up with someone\nyou know great if you can't that's okay\ntoo because I don't know that people\nwatching are gonna be able to really\nthey're not gonna understand what's in\nyour head but then the next thing that I\nwant you to do is think about okay who\ndo you know who has a strong sense of\npersonal identity and then what are\ntheir parents like right so and I think\nthe short answer is that those parents\nare gonna be very good at being like\nreflective and supportive for that\nperson's identity and what that means is\nthat like they let that person be who\nthey are but the basic problem corgi is\nthat I don't think I think there were a\ncouple of times in your life or maybe\nyou know everyday to a certain degree\nthat you couldn't who you were being who\nyou were was less important than being\nwho you needed to be for your mom and so\nyou started to wither away and now\nyou're you're sitting at 22 and you're\nlike I don't know who I am and yeah\nbecause what the way that you learn who\nyou are is through the mirroring of your\nparents right and this goes back to the\nidea when a kid hurts himself how does\nhe know what he feels it's because of\nthe facial expressions he sees on the\noutside\nparental mirroring is what helps you\ndetermine your identity because then you\nget data from the outside about who you\nare on the inside\nparental mirroring is also supportive\nparent like parents who are supportive\nand we see this with like you know to\nTiger parent is so Tiger parents or\nparents that want their kids to be like\nsuper super successful and don't give a\n[ __ ] about their feelings does that make\nsense to you like so a lot of like you\nknow a lot of people have Tiger parents\nand like what happens is the child has\ncertain beliefs about like they have\ncertain things that they feel on the\ninside and the parent basically doesn't\ngive a [ __ ] and the parent says I don't\ncare what you feel on the inside I want\nyou two just do what I want you to do\nand then those kids grow up to be like\nnot confident and don't know who they\nare because their parents never gave\nthem an opportunity to like discover who\nthey are because any time that child\ntries to express their identity what\nthey got from the parent did not connect\nwith what they feel on the inside does\nthat make sense so I think now what's\ngoing on is you're starting to find a\nrelationship where someone is kind of\nmirroring you or you're starting to form\nan emotional connection and you're\nscared because you don't really know\nlike how to do this but you're hungry\nfrom your for your girlfriend like\nthat's the best thing that I'd describe\nlike you know it sounds like you really\ndo love her and care about her and you\ndo feel things like guilt so you're not\nlike a sociopathic [ __ ] but I think\nwhat's what's new to you is like this\nsort of empathic connection you don't\nquite know how to do it and and what I'm\ngetting from you is that like you know\nyou're hungry from her for her does that\nmake sense that word help me understand\nin what way that word makes sense to you\nwell when I started like dating her it\nwas it was basically I decided that I\nwas gonna find someone you know was good\nfor me you know would find a girlfriend\na year and it was like a very fast\nfound her and didn't notice that you\nknow she was a good person and she cared\nabout me\nso I guess I really under for him the\nway of attention and love and like\nreally well and expressed love you know\nthey died even though I mean I had that\na little bit when I was a child really\nlater stages yep so so like that's\ninteresting right because you said that\nshe makes it abundantly clear how she\nfeels about you\nso she does the equivalent of oh my god\nOh Corgi cuz she says she shows and\ntells you how much she loves you and you\nhave to talk to her every day so she's\ndoing for you what your parents should\nhave done right right she's providing\nthat like amplified emotional response\nbecause your capacity to feel emotion is\nlike you know your volume is turned way\ndown so she has to send you big signals\nand once you get big signals then you\nstart to form a connection and I think\nyou're gonna be okay man I think you're\ngonna be okay\nand I don't think you have to end up\nlike your parents and most importantly\nif you're thinking about having kids one\nday I think your kids can be normal and\nhealthy right this is not a curse that\nhas to get passed on yeah actually I\nwanted to ask you yeah because it's not\nlike it doesn't have biological roots\nright right it's not purely a biological\nthing well there's a difference between\nnot having biological roots and purely\nbeing a biological thing does it have\nbiological roots absolutely is it purely\na biological thing absolutely not\nyeah cuz I was wondering if it was\nsomehow really did you like how children\nare raised\nbecause I can see a lot of things that\nwent wrong like the way my parents\nraised yeah so so let's remember that\nhow you were raised\ndoesn't mean it wasn't biological right\nso like like let's like if I lose a hand\nin an accident when I'm growing up\nbiologically I'm missing a hand does\nthat make sense like so so what happens\nwhen you're growing up is your brain\nwires a certain way and once it wires\nthat way it's absolutely neuroscientific\nit's like neurological and it's\nbiological like it in your brain your\nempathic and emotional circuitry is\nwired in a way that is like different\nfrom other people's brains\nso is it biological for you absolutely\nbut was it is it genetic or pretty\ndetermined absolutely not because our\nbrain responds biologically to\ninfluences if I'm a chef and I I learn\nhow to taste things the biology of my\ntongue in my gustatory cortex which is\nthe part of my brain that can taste\nthings is going to be biologically\nsuperior to someone who is not a chef\nwith me so here's what we understand\nabout BPD okay the first thing is that\nthere does seem to be a genetic\ncomponent to it but the tricky thing\nthere is that I think that the genetic\ncomponent could have to do with\nupbringing in the way that you're raised\nby parents who may have a similar\npersonality disorder does that make\nsense so even then it's not necessarily\npurely genetic the other thing that we\nknow that supports that it isn't\nnecessarily biological or genetic in\norigin is that one of the biggest risk\nfactors for BPD you can just yawn it's\nokay man the the one of the biggest risk\nfactors for BPD is actually trauma at an\nearly age so even if someone wins the\ngenetic lottery and they get traumatized\nin a bad way there's a decent chance\nthat they'll develop BPD later on in\nlife so that's not genetic but what\nhappens\ntrauma trauma changes our brain right so\nis that biological like absolutely like\nthe two are connected but it's not\npredetermined does that answer your\nquestion yeah yeah so I think your brain\nis different and we know that so we've\ndone brain scans on people with BPD and\nwe see that their brain is different\nfrom normal people and here's just one\nexample of this so people with BPD if\nyou take an emotional insult the amount\nof blood flow that goes to the emotional\nparts of the brain and a BPD person is\nlike twice as much is what goes to a\nnormal person so their brain activates\nfar more rapidly compared to a normal\nperson after an emotional insult the\nother thing that's really interesting is\nthat it maintains blood flow to that\npart of the brain for like days longer\ncompared to hours for a normal person so\ntheir emotional circuitry turns on way\nfaster and this is what's really\ndifferent the biggest difference is how\nlong it stays active so for a normal\nperson will feel better after a couple\nof hours for someone to BPD they'll be\nthey can be upset for days and there's\nabsolutely a biological correlate to\nthat but was it biologically or\ngenetically predetermined no because the\nbrain wired a certain way as a child to\nbe emotionally sensitive and if you want\nme to keep going I can even explain\nfurther and the reason that their brain\nwires that way is so oftentimes people\nwith BPD grow up in in households with\nabusive parents and so what they have to\ndo is a survival mechanism is be able to\ndetect a tiny tiny signal from a parent\nis my parent gonna slap me across the\nface and they have to know that the\nsecond that the parent walks in the door\nand we had an interview a couple months\nago with a guy named iris I started out\ndyrus Coco B and and you if you guys\nwatch that that interview you'll you'll\nsee I talk about that a lot in depth\nwhere like you know kids who grew up in\nabusive households are very very attuned\nto the emotional state\nof their parents and if they're not\nattuned they get beat so they have to\ntake a tiny tiny signal and amplify it\nand once they take that tiny single Oh\ndad's not in a good mood today I better\nact I better be super super nice and\nthat's absolutely adaptive and then\ntheir brain wires to like to jerk up and\nturn up the volume on all of the\nemotional stimuli and then they enter a\nnormal relationship and they get [ __ ]\nbecause their partner is not trying to\ntell them that they're a terrible person\nbut they have the volume terms so high\nthat a tiny thing makes them feel\nterrible and it's absolutely happening\nin their brain sorry if I kind of went\noff on a tangent there but thoughts or\nquestions for me Gordy or did I explain\nenough about BPD any other questions or\nanything else you want to share\ndon't think so okay cool man can you can\nyou share with me a little bit about\nwhat his what you've taken away from\nthis or if this has been helpful and and\nhow yeah I guess it's very helpful I\nunderstand a bit more about like what I\nknew no way yeah and why that I'm not\nexactly a bad person because of it yes\ngood you know yeah and what are you what\ndo you think you are help me understand\nwhat what you learned about yourself\ntoday I am just a very adaptive person\nmm-hmm didn't get uh the right amount of\nemotion from France yeah yeah and I'd\nsay when it comes to you being\nmanipulative it's just that you're kind\nof you know I was talking about a chef\nearlier who has a very fine-tuned palate\nin your case your emotional palette is\nvery inexperienced so you don't know how\nto taste different things so when you\ninteract with other people those parts\nof your brain that normally feet like\nmake people feel bad are not active but\nthey're definitely there right because\nyou feel bad when it comes towards your\ngirlfriend and as you continue to have a\nhealthy relationship and these parts of\nyour brain are gonna start to turn on\nslowly you may find changes with your\ninterpersonal interactions with other\npeople so over time and I think\nespecially if you have kids your brain\nundergoes a lot of changes when you have\nchildren because it has to so like you\nhave to learn your emotional circuitry\nhas to be like up like jacked up because\nyou have to be able to relate to a child\nwho can't communicate so you have to\nlearn how to be more empathic because\nthey can't tell you\nthank so you have to be able to read\nthem way better so for me I noticed a\nbig change like the simplest way that I\ncan put it as ice never cry like I\ndidn't cry for like 15 years or some\n[ __ ]\nactually I mean I cried yeah I didn't\ntry it for a while and then I used to\nnever cry watching movies and then after\nI had kids like I watched the Lion King\nand I was like crying and I was like\nwhat is like I was just confused I was\nlike what is happening\nI don't know crying the same movie like\nI never cry about anything\nyep unless like it's me Mickey yeah\nright Samia yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nyeah I understand I know exactly what\nyou mean because I literally used to be\nthe same way and then like suddenly I\nhad children and like literally what\nhappens is your brain changes when you\nhave kids because it has to learn and\nthen I was like I'm watching blank and\nI'm like well no one else is crying my\nkids don't even really understand they\njust like the animals so I'm sitting\nthere I'm crying it's like 3 p.m. on a\nSaturday afternoon and my kids are\nwatching a Disney movie and I start\ncrying it's like what I was so confused\nand so your your circuitry will turn\nback on and and you know I think you'll\nbe okay man and you're not a bad person\nyou're really not cool do you want to\nlearn how to meditate because sometimes\nwe do that yeah yes what meditation to\nteach someone who oh it never really\nworked out I couldn't really we are my\nmind yep no we're not gonna do any\nmeditation involving your mind we're\ngonna do meditation involving your body\nokay so I want you to sit up straight\nokay so you know you know how you can't\ncry yep okay so close your eyes and what\nI want you to do I'm gonna ask you some\nquestions and what I want you to do is\npay attention to what happens in your\nbody as I ask you\nand if you feel something in your body\nlet me know okay so first what's your\ngirlfriend's name if you feel\ncomfortable sharing it it's Sabrina okay\nso I want you to think about Sabrina\nwhat do you feel\nall right what does that feel like in\nyour body it's like I'm you know like\ntingling here take the muscles which is\nmild and yeah okay I smile unconscious\nokay and now think about the first time\nwe met\ncan you tell us a little bit about it\nyeah we were we used to talk like online\nbecause a mutual friend group and the\nfirst time we met we were pinched a\nmovie with a bunch of friends and it was\nvery like funny cuz I was already in the\nmall that we were gonna watch with my\nfriends and I saw Hurley call me and\njust going straight up like she didn't\nnotice us because at the time she was\nvery fat like social anxiety uh-huh so\nshe didn't look around at all and just\ndidn't see us and I was like oh there\nshe goes and uh I went to find her with\nmy friends in the I just came like\nbehind her and I was like okay yeah one\nof those need to tell her we are here\nand no one wanted to go so I just sent a\nmessage like hey look behind you and\nlike it was so it's very like nice to\nremember cuz it was still cute though if\nyou turn around and you looks now pay\nattention to your body what do you feel\nyeah I am\nyou know okay tell me what you feel hey\nwhat does that feel like\nin your body tell me the sensations in\nyour body\nI just know like I can't stand still I\nmean energy in there yeah right\nso sit with nachos there you are\nyeah sit with that just bask in it\npretend like you're you're laying out in\nthe Sun and let that warmth fill you up\nand if you feel like if tears want to\ncome out they can come out a big deal\ndon't try to hold anything back\nand how are you what are you feeling in\nyour body or how are you feeling good my\neyes are kind of shaky oh all right so\nthese are these this is this is feeling\nand your brain is trying to process it\nhasn't tasted things before right\neverything has been bland and now your\nbrain is trying to understand what are\nthese feelings what is this not quite\nsure it's okay so now we're gonna go to\na different place so now I want you to\nthink a little bit about the moment that\nyou realize that you're an actor and\nthat maybe you don't really love her\nright think about where that thought\ncame from you tell us a little bit about\nhow you came to that realization it was\njust that I was just doing things with\nmy sister that day that she was here\nbutter down squeezing those gonna go\ntalk person and\nand basically the whole time I just\ndidn't set a message for her and I was\njust thinking like how weird it was that\nI didn't think about sending her a\nmessage or when I thought about sitting\nhere a message I would just think on how\nshould i what should I say and [ __ ]\nshould I act when talking to her you're\ntalking about Sabrina or your sister\nyeah Sabrina and comparing that to how\nlike I act towards my sister so it's\nkind of cool\nmm-hmm so what I'm hearing is you you\nwere a chameleon that didn't know what\ncolor it was supposed to be and you were\none color with your sister and you\nweren't sure what color to be with\nSabrina and then yeah and then what I\nwant you to think about when you told\nher what did you say to her when you\nended up telling her hey I'm not sure if\nI I love you or what do you remember\nwhat he said fracturing\nso now what are you feeling in your body\nit was comfortable gues comfortable or\nuncomfortable and okay what is the where\nin your body do you feel uncomfortable\nsit up straight\nit's like like hope bar here generally\nchest and belly good so what would you\ndescribe it as tightness or heaviness or\nsome people feel like their throat is\nconstricting it's kind of empty okay so\nnow what we're gonna do is I want you to\njust sit with that feeling for a second\nokay so you may feel guilt or hurt or\nwhatever those are the words that we use\nand I want you to breathe into your\nbelly now now sit up straight\nand take a deep breath in through your\nnose and let it come all the way down\ninto your belly slowly breathe out and\nagain in through the nose and out\nthrough the nose okay so nice slow deep\nbreath into the belly and then out and\nnow do it\nthird time and this time as you exhale I\nwant you to see if there's warmth in\nyour chest then it's kind of coming from\nthe outside as you exhale and kind of\ngoing into that emptiness\nbut it's it's kind of I felt like it was\nharder for me to like think back off\nthat moment versus the moment at first I\nheard that oh that one is so much longer\nago yep\nyeah so you're so overall I know it\nsounds kind of weird but that's\nbasically the practice so what I what I\nwant you to do so let me ask you\nsomething when you were breathing in and\nout what was happening to the sensations\nin your chest quite an experience how\nyou doing okay I promise we're almost\ndone so let me just ask you one or two\nlast questions what what was happening\nto the sensation in your middle part as\nyou were breathing I felt like you got\nkind of worse than I was Brittany right\nand you've got better when I was\nexhaling good yeah yeah so so that so so\nwhat I recommend to people if they don't\nknow cuz you know at the beginning of\nthis you were like yeah I don't know\nwhat I feel but if you're wondering who\nthe real you is corgi it's that person\nthat you just were for like 90 seconds\nor two minutes or three minutes that's\nthe real you do you see that it's not\nlike an act like that's coming from in\nhere you're not trying to be unless\nyou're really [ __ ] manipulative and\nyou're fooling all of us which is a\npossibility maybe this is the part of\nthe chameleon where you pry because\nyou're supposed to cry but I don't\nreally I don't think so but I would say\nthat that is the real right ensure\nyou've been a chameleon your entire life\nbut you're in there man and there's good\n[ __ ] in there and there's bad [ __ ] in\nthere and that's what that's what the\nreal you is it's all of it\nand all you have to do to get to know\nthat person is to just stop and close\nyour eyes and think back through things\nor think back through your day and it\ndoesn't have to be big emotions it can\nbe all kinds of things it can be little\nthings again\nall things it can be fun things it can\nbe ice-cream it can be a plant it can be\na sunset and and just let yourself feel\nwhat's in there and if things come up as\nyou think about your sister\nor think about your dad or think about\nyour girlfriend as you think about not\ntexting her for a day or two how do you\nfeel what feelings come up and then\nbreathe into it and then breathe it out\nand then do that for a while and you'll\nknow who you are be good all right yeah\nall right man strong work thank you very\nmuch for coming on any last questions or\nthoughts before we wrap up for the day\nokay guys that's it thanks a lot man\ntake care so that was good that's fun\nweird huh cuz like he really sounded\nlike a sociopathic [ __ ] at the\nbeginning of that and and that's what\nI'm saying like you guys got a you know\nwe have to be careful about the way that\nwe judge ourselves and I don't want you\nguys so this is the this is the problem\nis that like you know he looks at\nhimself and he judges himself because he\ndoesn't see the full self you guys judge\nthe person that you are today without\ngiving enough credit to what made you\nthat way\nright and and you know you can notice\nthings about yourself and just be honest\nit doesn't mean that you're like a bad\nperson he's not a bad person he's just\nhe's he's emotionally his brain\ncircuitry wasn't given an ideal\nenvironment to develop\nyeah anyway\nand yeah right so he's\nokay um would a true sociopath even know\nor admit that he was yeah so that so\nthis is an interesting question because\nit implies a true sociopath is a binary\nthing right it's like a true sociopath\nis like a hundred percent likes\nsociopathy is is a personality trait\nthat has a scale there are some people\nat one end of the scale and another\nother people at the other end of the\nscale and I don't think that I mean\nmaybe as a true sociopath exists but in\nmy overwhelming experience it's a scale\nand even if you think about like\nneuropsychological testing it's a scale\nand you get a score it's not binary it's\nnot like yes or no right and and I think\nthat most people know most people who\nare like test hilum on sociopathy scale\nhave an inkling like he knows right like\nhe knows that he's a chameleon and like\nhe knows he's manipulative and he knows\nthat that's the way that he functions so\nI I wouldn't be surprised I mean if he\ngot psychological testing and was\nthoroughly evaluated and things like\nthat there's a decent chance that\nsomeone would diagnose him with\nsociopathy but I I mean I think that\nthat that doesn't mean he's a bad person\nso that's the other thing that's\nhappened is that in our society\nsociopathy which is a personality\ncharacteristic which roughly correlates\nwith like you know super we have empaths\non one end of the spectrum and we have\nsociopaths on the other end of the\nspectrum and it's kind of a spectrum of\nlike where where your empathic you know\nhow empathic you are in and oftentimes\nwhat happens is we have like moral\njudgments that we place on a certain\npersonality characteristic but I'll say\nagain that surgeons and psychiatrists\ntest highly on sociopathy scale and\nthat's because it's like an adaptive\npart of our job if I was super empathic\nand kind of fell apart every time I was\nwith a suicidal person I have colleagues\nwho are very empathic and their job is\nlike hard they suffer a lot\nso you know it's it's it's not like a\ngood or a bad thing and I think if you\nguys really stop and and listen to him\nhe's actually incredibly more right and\neven so more moral than someone who\nmaybe\nyou know more moral than someone who may\nbe empathic because without those\nfeelings he tries to do right by people\nright so he it's like it's not like he's\nlike emotionally drawn he makes choices\nout of like a genuine sense of choice\nare you allowed to say what mental\nillness he thinks someone may have on\nstreams sort of so I don't diagnose\nsurfeit mental illnesses so I don't make\ndiagnoses but I think it's fair to say I\nmean I think I have sort of an ethical\nresponsibility to say like hey man you\nmay want to get that checked out right\nso if someone that struggles with\nanxiety sometimes I'll say to people\nlike hey you should really think about\nseeing a therapist and see if you've\nreally got that I think that that's fair\nit's not me making a diagnosis it's just\nme suggesting that it it's worth looking\ninto it's sort of like you know if I see\nsomeone on the street who's got like a\nlump that I think could be cancerous I'm\nnot gonna make a diagnosis but I'm gonna\nsay like hey man maybe you want to get\nthat [ __ ] biopsy right that that I think\nis a duty that comes with knowledge yeah\nso I thought that was really fantastic I\nhope you guys enjoyed it you know a lot\nof people have been asking about\nsociopathy and and so hopefully that was\nhelpful and I think that's actually a\nreally good example of what I think real\nsociopathic tendencies sort of looked\nlike and it's conflict it's like\ncomplicated and oftentimes it has to do\nwith like the way that this person was\nraised and then the way that they were\ntalking about emotions and things like\nthat so you know thank you guys very\nmuch for watching thank you guys for\nsupporting us and you know supporting us\nduring Mental Health Awareness Month I\nthink sociopathy is one of these things\nthat's poorly understood and if you guys\nfeel like y'all are sociopaths then like\nthat doesn't mean that you're bad people\nand chances are you know you are that\nway for a reason and it's like you can\nstill change like you don't have to be\nthat way that's the cool thing about\npersonality quote-unquote disorders is\nthat even though that your brain is\nwired a certain way it's not like you\ncan change like people people with BPD\ncan no longer be criteria\nor even be cured of BPD it I mean it\nhappens right people who are like\ncodependent which is another personality\ndisorder or people who are narcissistic\nthey can no longer be narcissistic or no\nlonger meet criteria for the disorder\nwhich this is a tricky thing about\npsychiatry as we like draw a line and we\nsay you either have it or you don't have\nit but it's all a spectrum and people\ncan get better right like I used to be a\nnarcissistic [ __ ] too and I got\nbetter can alexithymia be treated\nabsolutely so he's also Alexa thymic in\nthe way that you treat alexithymia is\nexactly what we did right he's a guy and\nhe's like yeah I don't cry and then like\nwithin 30 seconds he's like tearing up\nthinking about his girlfriend that's how\nyou treat alexithymia it's like you just\nteach people how to engage with their\nemotions and you teach them how to taste\nthings and it's gonna start with big\nsignals right if I started to ask him\nabout his sister he's probably got\nemotions there that are buried too but\nwe start with the girlfriend he learns\nhow to taste taste those those emotions\namplified responses from girlfriend as\nhe becomes more sensitive or more in\ntune he can tap into other emotions tap\ninto other emotions tap into other\nemotions so what about internet trolls I\nlove talking to internet trolls and none\nof them seem to want to come on though\nso what's the difference between\nalexithymia and sociopathy so\nalexithymia is is a symptom right it's a\nparticular slice of thing and its\ninability to determine your internal\nemotional state sociopathy is people who\ndon't feel empathy so sociopathy is is I\nmean there are more complicated\ndefinitions or better definitions that\nwhen I'm giving I'm giving a simplistic\nterm but the way that I think about\nsociopathy is I think about it as a\nspectrum on like the empathic scale and\nso its inability to like feel of the\nemotions of other people and alexithymia\nis an inability to determine your own\nemotions so it's an issue of direction\ngood question though yeah so one person\nsays how about if I feel too emotional\nlike sometimes I get emotional watching\nthings that are not emotional at all\nyeah that that signals to me that you've\ngot pent up emotions that are buried\ndown there\nthat come up at random times so you got\nto process that stuff too that's more\nabout cleaning apps and processing old\nemotions that have built up do you talk\nwith viewers absolutely that's what we\ndo so we usually do yeah okay there's no\none a truly bad person no I think there\ncan be people who can be bad people\nabsolutely\nyeah people can do bad things\nsure so"
