    "transcript": "it takes me about twice as long they get\neverything set up whenever I do it just\ngood call it's completely fine okay\nand so what's your name friend Zach or\nasmin gold\nwhichever what what do you prefer uh\nlet's go what's good about that okay\ncool\nnice to meet you Zach I'm I'm although\nfor some people call me dr. kay I guess\nmost people don't see doctors who but\nyou can call me all look or whatever you\nprefer\nit's not all maple it's all oak all oak\nokay perfect just like the original Sun\nscript okay awesome man\nso Zach I don't everyone is super\nexcited that we're talking and I'm not\nsure exactly why but they seem to be\nsuper excited do you have any idea I've\nhad a very interesting history I mean I\nthink that I don't know if you've looked\nat any of my previous stuff at all but I\nthink that one of the most I guess\nfamous or I guess infamous things about\nme is my room has always been very dirty\nand so a lot of people correlate that\nwith something being wrong with you or\nsomething like that and sure they did\nthey probably think that something like\nthat has to do with it I do have to\ndisappoint people though my room\nactually is pretty clean right now\nthough I apologize okay so I mean but\nwhat do you think it what conclusions do\npeople draw about the dirtiness of your\nroom in you ah basically that I don't\nhave my life together it's a complete\nmess I'm depressed I I think so don't\nnot having my life together my life\nbeing a complete mess for most of my\nlife that's probably true but okay the\npart where yeah yeah I mean let's be\nreal\nbut depressed mmm hard to say III don't\nreally think depressed is the right word\nwhat would you use to describe it there\noh I mean like there I I think it's just\nlazy\nobviously like yeah yeah lazy I think\nthat's really the main thing like there\nhave been times that I have been\ndepressed about certain things sure had\nmedical problems with my parents I've\nhad you know ups and downs in my stream\nthings have made me depressed like\nsituationally but not gone I believe\nlike a mental level sure so help me\nunderstand what what what do you mean by\nlazy so there is one time that my alarm\nwent off in my in my room I was like\ntired to wake up and die instead of\nturning off the alarm\nI let the alarm go for two hours maybe\nthree hours until the arm died okay can\nyou hold on just one second yeah my\nBoomer ass needs to make a phone call\nbecause I may be doing something wrong\nthanks for being with me and I\nappreciate it it's no problem then\nusually trendex it's okay it's okay five\nminutes okay cool we fix it all right so\nyou're saying sorry I think we're good\nnow so you you said that you were you're\nlazy because there was a yes I think\nthat was just it's more or less a\nmetaphor of how lazy I am why am i lazy\nbecause it's easier to not do anything\nthan do something that's fundamentally\nwhat it is and I'm I'm very good at\nadapting the things whenever they go\nwrong I grew up very poor so if a light\ngoes out I just stopped using that room\nyep that's that's how that's pretty much\nit and sorry this is the last\ninterruption I promise I just got a tea\ndelivery how convenient that's great yes\nit's actually really awesome um so tell\nme you said that you learned how to\nadapt by like you know something breaks\nlike you just learn how to live without\nit yeah like I've had a box fan duct\ntape to the side of my PC whenever I my\nfan on my graphics card broke because I\ncouldn't afford a new one I literally\nhad a bike with one pedal whenever I was\na kid I I mean there's plenty of other\nexamples but yeah I mean I grew up\npretty poor so I'm just used to you know\nif things don't go the way that I want\nthem to that's okay and I just do\nwhatever I can\nand\nwhen you so where did you grow up if you\ndon't mind me asking Austin Texas okay\nwe're in Austin whereabouts uh I don't\nlike to say okay cuz like oh yeah yeah I\ndon't but I I grew up in a poor part of\nAustin not not forget very poor I don't\nwant it make sound like this is a rags\nto riches story it's just a thrift store\nclothes to riches story or maybe not\nquite riches but slightly more\nsuccessful than I was sure and are you\nstill yeah I know I'm not supposed to\nask people kind of where they live but I\nI get excited about people who are in\nTexas because I grew up in Texas East\nTexas went to school in Austin I'm back\nin Texas now really happy to be back\nhere awesome\nyep yeah before I before I stopped\nbefore I started streaming I actually\nwas planning on going to to UT law or\nmaybe Baylor good thing on which one I\nwould get accepted to cool it then I\ndecided to uh play World of Warcraft\ninstead can you tell me a little bit\nmore about what and growing up was like\nsure I actually to be to be honest with\nyou I actually really enjoyed my my\nexperience growing up trend I had a lot\nof like really great memories and uh in\na way I'm almost sad that I can't just\nrelive it now honestly like I had I was\nsurrounded by all my friends my family\nmy parents were well in general I was\nvery happy oh yeah\nyeah I mean like there were negatives of\ncourse there were negatives but if I\nlook back on it I I can't say that I\nregret a thing sure yeah I think one of\nthe most confusing things for people is\nthat they assume that being poor means\nthat you're you will grew up unhappy and\nalso that being rich means that you grew\nup happy or that you are happy and one\nday we weirdest things that I remember\nthere was used to work in jail and I was\njust really surprised because I had one\npatient so I would work in to jail like\nbasically one day a week and you know I\nhad like a clinic outside of the jail so\nI had like regular quote unquote regular\npatients and then I would see people in\njail and one of the things that really\nstruck me is that I had a guy who was an\ninvest\nbanker and like he was suffering just\nabout the same as the dude who was in\njail and it was like a really weird\nthing to like realize but if you really\njust asked me like how much is this\nperson suffering on a scale of one to\nten both of them were suffering the same\namount and also the Burghley huh\nsuccesses of prison I you know it's\nfunny you say that but I think that I've\nbeen working a lot with people with\nimpostor syndrome recently and I think\nin a sense that really can be which I\nknow is bizarre I think there's a lot of\ngatekeeping around suffering and who's\nallowed to suffer and also gatekeeping\naround happiness because like who are\nyou like if you grew up and you were\npoor like how can you possibly be happy\nlike how does that work I completely\nagree with you I know that um so this\nhappened I've taken a number of breaks\nfrom streaming about like three\ntechnically but two like more popular\nones and or more known once and before\nthat I was streaming a games a classic\nWow and I my stream was seeing success\nthat had never seen before like I was\ngetting up to like a hundred thousand\nviewers and I had like thirty thousand\nsubscribers it was very very very\nsuccessful but I was actually enjoying\nmyself a lot less and I was whenever I\nhad you know comparatively only like\ntwenty five or thirty thousand viewers\nplaying before classic Wow it came out\nand I I realized at that point that\nthere were a number of times that I had\nwanted to go after and like meet a\ncertain goal so I think my main goal\nthat I'd always wanted to hit was 10,000\nlike average viewers are hitting 10,000\nviewers period and then once I hit that\ngoal I didn't really feel anything it\ndidn't feel good and it's always been a\npursuit of doing more and more and more\nand I think that after I did classic Wow\nand I had that experience with which is\nwhat you're saying with the investment\nbanker and I was doing so well and I was\nso unhappy and I was stressed out and\nnot enjoying myself I realized that you\nknow there might be a little bit more to\nthis and what do you think is what what\nis that more I would say like\nsince a purpose internal fulfillment\nmaybe something like that uh uh you know\nfor me personally I I always felt like\nin a way that I kind of embody something\nthat's in a way like kind of meaningful\nto a lot of people and they want to\nwatch a stream and see that kind of\nexists and for many people I might\nrepresent you know remind them of an old\nfriend or you know maybe an opportunity\nthat they didn't have of being Who I am\nyou know I'm a guy I'm you know almost\n30 now and I play video games all day I\nlive with my mom and I would say that in\nmany regards I'm quite content not all\nbut many regards I'm quite content and I\nthink they don't number people like kind\nof resonate with that because for many\nof them it's a road not taken' and I I\nfeel like I kind of had this\nresponsibility as being a creator of\nbeing that person for other people out\nthere who didn't really have the\nopportunity to do that and more so also\nfor younger people because video games\nwere very transformative and whenever I\ngrew up and I think that the experience\nthat I had playing World War Craft\nwhoever I was 16 17 you know around that\nage you don't really have the same\nexperiences and abilities to you know\nprove yourself as an individual you know\nyou're a 16 year old loser 17 year old\nloser who cares what you think\nbut the moment that I got put on even\nplaying field with everybody else you\nknow like kids there were 12 and guys\nthat were as old as my teachers and I\nwas able to succeed in that I think that\nbuilt up a lot of self-esteem and\nconfidence with me and because of that I\nfeel like I've always tried to promote\nthat type of environment for other\npeople because it was so impactful and\nmeaningful for me and it's oh oh go\nahead no go for it\noh well so whenever I was doing what I\nwas doing in classic Wow and playing it\nthe way that I was and having the type\nof stream atmosphere I felt like\nfundamentally I had moved away from that\nand I think that was a big problem yeah\ndo you think about this stuff a lot oh\nyeah I make videos about it constantly\nIII think about it a lot I I lay in bed\nI I think all the time oftentimes I'll\nlay in bed and instead of like watching\na movie I'll just sit there and think\nyeah I really appreciate I appreciate\nyou as a thinker\nI I try to be I mean I feel like it's\nsomething that's not as common nowadays\nand I feel like people feel like they\nneed to have like an external type of\nvalidation or external type of mike-mike\nreinforcement\nuh well a viewer account is like a very\nguess yes like of your account basically\nbut it goes with everything it's like\npeople that feel like oh they're not\ndoing enough in their real life or\nthey're not meeting these standards\naccording to what celebrities are doing\non on Instagram they're not making\nenough money compared to their friends I\nthink this is you know it's prevalent\nthroughout everyone yeah sounds like a\nvery comparative world here describing\noh yeah I mean I think everybody is\nbeing compared especially with social\nmedia you know you have so many\nquantitative measurements of a person's\nperceived value mm-hmm that it's very\nunhealthy so I would love to hear you\ntalk more and at the same time I'm I'm\nkind of trying to remember or hold on to\nthe idea that sometimes people hear you\nknow a lot of our audience I think\nbenefits from people sort of sharing\ntheir personal stories as opposed to\nintellectualizing or philosophizing\nwhich i think is certainly valuable and\nI'm curious is there something in\nparticular that you'd want to talk about\ntoday that you maybe want to work on or\nwant help with or want to better\nunderstand sure um I think that if I was\ngonna go with anything I would say the\nfailure to commit to things and the\nfailure to actually execute on plans\nthat I have okay I've had a number of\nplans and I think I'm probably a victim\nof my own laziness more so than a lot of\nother things and like there are a number\nof like ideas I've had for streams that\nI just haven't really done for example\nI've had like technical difficulties\nwith my stream that have just existed\nfor months now and I just ignore them\nand they diminish the quality of the\nstream and the weird thing about it is\nthat whenever I actually go through and\nI clear out all my message\nor I do something like that I don't\nreally like you know I'm not really a\nagoraphobic or anything like that but I\nalso like to be alone and so you know in\nsome ways I don't really like going and\nuh talking to people and I just want to\nbe left alone basically and I I do that\nfor a while and then I think a lot of\npeople can probably relate to this is\nthat I won't respond to somebody for a\nwhile\nand then I won't respond to them after\nthat because I feel like it's outside of\nthe normal societal expectation or you\nknow later yeah it's too late now\noh man too bad you know I guess I'm just\ngonna ignore it again and so I've I've\ndone that a lot and it's been a problem\nI think with a lot of like kind of\nfriendships I've had and everything like\nthat and also like kind of focusing on\nmy stream a little bit too much I think\nreally burned me out before and I used\nlike kind of the metaphor of and this is\nin my 2017 or 18 of I metaphorically\nkilled myself Zach and I became asmin\ngold right and I focused entirely on my\nstream and I stopped dealing with you\nknow the people and and everything like\nthat and coming back I've wanted to be\nmore of who I am really and I think\nthat's been something I've been working\non but it's hard to do that whenever\nscreaming can be very stressful it's a\nvery emotionally draining job sometimes\nand it's sometimes I do feel like kind\nof after I finished my stream I just\nwant to sit there by myself even though\nthat's not necessarily what I should do\nI think that twice sure to delete why\nshould you do that well because I feel\nlike it's kind of like what I was saying\na minute ago\nwhenever I was talking about how\nwhenever I would see someone or talk to\nsomeone and do the thing that I was like\nkind of putting off doing and I would\nactually do it I would feel better at\nthe end but the anticipation and like\nkind of the the wanting to do it or not\nwanting to do it overwhelmed that and so\nyou I was basically prolonging a\nnegative feeling and preventing a\npositive feeling sure that's always been\nlike a big problem that I've had like\nwith schoolwork\nwith everything yes oh yeah let me just\nsee if I kind of cuz I think there's you\nknow Zack there's a lot every time you\nspeak there's actually a lot there and\nso let me try to unpack a little bit\nabout what I heard and maybe how we can\nfocus things are you feeling okay I'm\nfeeling great okay so the first is that\nyou said something around a failure to\ncommit and what I'm gonna kind of zero\nthat in on is like how can we understand\nwhat is laziness like what is laziness\nwhere does it come from\nanother thing is sort of this idea of\nlike failure to respond so that you have\ncertain duties or things that you should\ndo right so let's talk a talk about it\nas the problem of should right yeah and\nit's kind of like I should do this and\nlike you know that something is good for\nyou but you can't seem to do it and so\nhow the [ __ ] does that like you know\nit's gonna be good for you you know\nyou're gonna feel better and then you\nhave like you have two options in your\nmind right you can prolong negativity or\nwe can let go of negativity and become\npositive and it's like why on earth\nwould you never pick prolonging\nnegativity well the problem with me is I\ngo for a third option where I ignore the\nnegativity I pretend the problem isn't\nreal and I just go on my day and I'm\nlike hey this is great I'm happy and\nI'll might do it tomorrow or the next\nday or you know I'll do it at some point\nin the future and this never really\nhappens since that you know I put things\noff for like a year yeah so like like\nit's almost like a willful distraction\noh you're not really interacting myself\nyeah so how does that work and then the\nthird sort of theme that I'm hearing is\nsomething around burnout in the war\nbetween Zack and asmin gold which like\nthat that topic I'm happy to talk about\nbut we like literally talked about that\non Wednesday with this guy named Jake\nand baked and we talked about the war\nbetween Jake and Jake and bake oh I I\nthink that you'll have that conversation\nwith every streamer I have had that\nCongress with every streamer so so I\nfeel like that one is sort of I'm happy\nto have it again because I\nthink it's fascinating and we can sort\nof you know zero in on different nuances\nand and try to understand what's unique\nto someone and what's common but I think\nthat maybe there's a little bit more\nmileage to be gained over this idea of\nlaziness in this like failure to respond\nwillful distraction like those are the\ntwo buckets that I think could be you\nknow I could try to tackle with you\nlet's do something different\nokay so what do you want to what you\nwant to talk about laziness or you want\nto talk about the willful distraction ah\nI think that they're kind of both things\noh yeah I get that they're connected so\nlike let's pick a direction\num I think probably just laziness\nbecause London as I said I'm I'm\ngenerally a Content person it's very\neasy for me to be content with things\nwhether they're great or bad and I am\nyou know I am what I am and so I don't I\nI don't really worry about doing a lot\nof things I guess it's kind of weird I\ncan I'm very good at just forgetting\nproblems and just not thinking about\nthem sure so you you sound you seem to\nme to be happy Zack are you happy yes\nsometimes I'm not always happy there are\na lot of things that make me very sad\nbut there are yeah I'd say overall I\nwake up in the morning and yeah so let\nme rephrase so I think happiness and\nsadness are emotions\nyeah I guess what I'm talking about is\nlike so happiness can sometimes be\nreferred to is like an existential thing\nor an emotional thing\nI get the sense just listening to you\nthat your eggs essentially healthy even\nthough you may not be emotionally happy\nat times I am until I think about dying\nthen yes I would be the only thing oh\nyeah I think about it a lot what do you\nthink about dying oh that's that's it's\na bad time what's bad about\nwell there are two things that can\neither happen\nyou can either exist forever in eternity\nor you cannot exist forever\nand I think both of them are equally\nterrifying what's terrifying about them\nthe human mind cannot process infinity\nyou can't understand what infinity is or\nat least I can't and the uncertainty of\nit because I've thought about this a lot\nand I've thought to myself I used to be\nvery very afraid of this and it doesn't\nmatter what happens it doesn't matter\nwhat you do it doesn't matter what you\ncan do you can be mother Teresa Adolf\nHitler or you still end up in the ground\nand there's no running from it or hiding\nfrom it or anything and I don't know\nexactly how I never really knew exactly\nhow to understand that and I thought to\nmyself I was like well if God would come\ndown and tell me you know hey I'm real\nall this [ __ ] that you read in that book\nthat's a hundred percent true and you're\ngonna be you're gonna be just fine\nwould that make me feel good well I\nthought about that for a long time and I\nthought yeah it would and then after a\nfew years about thinking about that\nmaybe five or ten years thinking about\nthat I thought wouldn't that also be\nkind of scary because that means that\nyour entire existence is premeditated do\nyou really exist if you're a construct\nof somebody else's goals they said I'm\nsaying yeah I see what you're saying\njust give me a second okay\nso what's scary about not existing for\neternity I don't know it's a weird thing\nbecause every once in a while I'll I'll\nget to the point of you know I don't\nknow I can lighten meant where I'm not\nbothered by that but also there are\ntimes where I'll lay in bed and be\nterrified and the only thing that I can\never do to really reassure myself is to\nremind myself that I am a hyper\nintelligent monkey that doesn't really\nknow what's going on with the world\nthat's the only way I can ever ever make\nmyself feel good about it okay remind\nmyself I don't know I'm gonna toss out a\nthird bucket and I think this bucket is\nprobably the lowest yield bucket but\nmaybe you know maybe somewhat\ninteresting and that's like what's the\ndeal with death so you know I think this\nis tricky because like generally\nspeaking I I have a particular so I\nthink about it as a Padma a duty so I\nthink about having like a duty to the\nperson that I speak to and I just try to\nthink about you know every time I stream\nso there's also all oak and dr. K right\nlike so I have that struggle too and I\nthe way the simple way that I get rid of\nthat struggle is I think a little bit\nabout like I just think about okay what\nis all oak doing what does dr. K do dr.\nK streams to like you know thousands of\npeople and tries to do a Oh a healing\nand all that kind of good stuff which is\nfine and great and Noble and fantastic\nand all that kind of stuff but all it\njust tries to help like just random\npeople that he talks to and anytime I\ntalk to someone I just think about what\ncan I do for this person mm-hmm now I'm\nI'm running into a little bit of a\nproblem because all oak and dr. K are\nfighting right now and what all oak says\nis that I would love to talk to you\nabout death in the nature of existence\nand and what happens after we die and to\ngive you a sense of give you a road or a\nroad map to finding peace around this\nissue and then dr. K says that I don't\nknow how applicable this is going to be\na lot of the people watching or probably\nstruggling with laziness and having a\nmultidisciplinary understanding of\nlaziness in terms of spirituality the\nfunction of the mind yoga meditation\npsychology neuroscience and like sort of\nbe like the science of behavior is\nprobably gonna help more people because\nlike that's people are lazy I here's how\nI look at it go for I'm a very pragmatic\nperson uh-huh and there have been many\nphilosophers over the thousands of years\nJesus Buddha Confucius Nietzsche and you\nknow all these people who tried to\nexplain and you know philosophize about\ndeath I don't think we're gonna get any\nfarther in this call well yes I mean I\ncompletely agree with you but I think\nthe reason that we're not gonna you\nhaven't you don't think we're gonna get\nanywhere in this call is because you\nthink what does a philosopher I think\nthe reason that you don't have answers\nis because you're looking for them in\nthe wrong places\nreally where do you think I should look\nso let's think about this for a second\nwhere does knowledge come from\nexperience okay so how many\nconversations can you have how many\npeople do I have to talk to about having\nsex before I understand what it's like\nto have sex it depends on what they tell\nyou so like let's okay so like you know\nwhat could they tell me that wouldn't\nhelp me understand what having sex is\nlike like how many people could I talk\nto uh well I mean I I think that I I\ndon't know I mean I think that you're\nimplying that you have to see it\nyourself is that right no I mean so\nyou're the one who said that that I\nasked you where does knowledge come from\nand you said experience and so then my\nresponse was like okay how many people\ndo I have to talk to to understand what\nsex is\nuh well I mean I think it depends right\nI mean you're gonna have first-hand\nexperience of actually doing it yourself\nand that's very direct knowledge and\nthen you'll have second hand experience\nwhat a second experience mean there's\nsomebody telling you like a man I hooked\nup with this girl and it was great you\nknow and this is what happened is that\nexperience uh yeah I mean I guess yeah\nis it not do you think that it's not no\nI wouldn't call it experience I'd call\nit words\nright so Sanskrit has two words for\nknowledge one is Vidya Vidya is\nobjective transmissible and also like\ninformation another word for knowledge\nis neon which is subjective experience\nall and non transmissible yeah okay yeah\nthat makes a lot of sense so first-hand\nexperiences neon secondhand experiences\nyou call it is Vidya it's something that\ncan be exchanged between two human\nbeings do you feel like the two of those\none of them is more visceral than the\nother absolutely because one of them is\nsubjective and one of them is subjective\none of them is completely visceral and\nthe other one is not visceral at all\nyeah right I understand that so so\nyou've been grappling with the problem\nof death for a long time and have you\nbeen approaching it from video from Jung\nI've tried to do both okay so tell us\nabout that um well I've I've considered\nlike reading different like you know\nwhat do you call it like different like\nholy books right I've thought about I've\nalways been that ready yeah\ndo you need a refresher on the\ndefinitions well I mean I guess you\ncan't I mean I've never died yeah I\nthink sleeping is the closest thing that\nyou have today sure and I've always kind\nof used that is a little bit of a you\nknow a smaller metaphor of that and in a\nway I guess you could say that I have\nhad experience because before 1990 I did\nnot exist okay yeah yeah hey so yeah so\nokay so let's think about this for a\nsecond do you do you fear what you were\nbefore 1990 I've done this one myself no\nnot really no I don't then why do I hear\nwhat happens after you die because what\nhappened after 1990 didn't happen before\nI never had the experience that I had I\nnever had the the friends I had I never\nhad the emotions I had I never had the\nthe yeah experiences and okay then yeah\neverything so so so then then we can see\nso that's a subtle but important point\nright because then what we're talking\nabout is that your attachment or your\navoidance of death is out of an\nattachment of life that you're really\nyou're really your only complaint with\nbefore 1990 is that you didn't have the\n[ __ ] that you have now ergo what you\nwhat you want to avoid is you don't want\nto lose what you have net no I don't so\nthat's so if we think about so then it's\nsort of like it's sort of immaterial and\nnow it sort of makes sense right because\nyou kind of said if there's life after\ndeath and there's eternity of\nconsciousness then that's scary and if\nthere isn't consciousness that's equally\nscary therefore we can conclude that\nlike what you're afraid of has nothing\nto do with whether you exist or not\nafter you've done what you're afraid of\ngood right because the bumps that those\noptions create the same reaction to you\nit's all the same whether your life ever\nafter I've decided which one is more\nterrifying yet yeah but they're both\nterrifying\nso like therefore we can conclude\nlogically that like the terror doesn't\ncome from either of those things because\nthat doesn't make any sense\nmm-hmm so then then and we hear and what\nyou said it's just consistent with your\nearlier feeling right which is that what\nyou're afraid of is the loss of what you\nhave it's an attachment it's not about\nlike what happens to you after you die\nit's not like about your consciousness\nit's the lack of the experiences that\nyou have today that you're afraid of\nyeah and I I did a thought experiment\nwith this and I thought about this a lot\nwhat would happen you know how would I\nfeel if basically whenever you died your\nsoul was effectively recycled and all of\nyour experiences were wiped and you just\ndid it all over again and I still don't\nreally know how I feel about that yeah\nbecause your what is a thought\nexperiment is it been the early on I\nthink it's\non attempting to be Vidya its Vidya\nattempting to manana\noh I must have gotten them yes I forgot\nI'm confused right so so it's it's like\nit's thinking your way it's like it's\nlike a thought experiment about sex is\nnot an orgasm so like like you can think\nyou're wet and this is why I think you\ndon't think that the conversation is\ngoing to be productive because you're\nthinking that the answers are gonna come\nfrom the conversation the answers aren't\ncan come from the conversation all the\nconversation is gonna do hopefully is\ngive you a roadmap to experience because\nI don't think you know how to do that um\nno maybe not yeah so then I guess this\nis what we're talking about you want to\ngo back to laziness we wanted to do this\nuh I think that we can do this maybe a\ncouple more minutes and then we can go\nback to laziness I'm okay so let me a\ncouple more minutes oh okay yeah let's\nsee what we can do so so let me let's\nstart by sort of saying that like do you\ndo you follow me that I think that your\nyour fear of death is is not a fear of\nwhat's beyond it's a fear of loss of\nwhat you have now it's a fear of the\nloss of life so much so that I actually\nI I whenever I was very young I began\nrecording a lot of the things that I did\nwhenever I was a kid and I want a video\ncamera whenever I was 11 years old\nbecause I had the foresight then I\nrealized that you know I thought to\nmyself I can't really remember what\nhappened whenever I was 6 but I always\nwant to be able to preserve and keep the\nmemories that I had and I've always done\nthat so I would never forget yes so\nyou're holding on to life absolutely\nright and so then if you want to conquer\nyour fear of death I notice it sounds\n[ __ ] like a meditation calendar but\nwhat you really have to do is let go of\nyour attachment of life that's no saying\nabout the moments of enlightenment yeah\nso so now let's talk about that like\nwhat does that even mean a moment of\nenlightenment what does that mean when\nyou confront things that you're\ncompletely afraid of but for whatever\nreason you're not afraid of them you you\nlook at\nthe you look at death in the face you\nlook it for me a dentists or wasps these\nare two things I'm very afraid of and\nyou know you look at that and you just\ndo it and you you approach it and you I\ndon't know like really what the best\nword is for it but yeah I don't think\ninternalize is it but you let it become\npart of you and you accept it as a\nreality that's okay to be the best way I\ncould verbalize it yeah so so then let\nme ask you let's ask some questions\nabout the quality of moments of\nenlightenment so you say they're moments\nergo it's not permanent right yeah so\nwhat fluctuates between a moment of\nenlightenment in a moment of not\nenlightened uh I I don't really know\nbecause the weird thing about the\nmoments of enlightenment is that\nsometimes I'll feel that way whenever\nthings are going very well and I'm happy\nand other times I'll feel that way where\nI don't care about dying or anything\nlike that whenever things are going very\nnot well and I think that's really kind\nof interesting because both ends you\nknow the both ends of the horse-shoe\nmeet at the same place nearly and I\nthink that's what happens okay excellent\nso that's a very important observation\nthat the current state of emotions does\nnot affect the moment of enlightenment\nand in fact the beauty of the moment of\nenlightenment is that allows you to\nexperience both of those extremes with a\ncertain tranquility yes right so like\nthat's pretty cool so now we can think\nabout a couple of things so the first\nthing that we figured out about moments\nof enlightenment is that they fluctuate\nit's not a permanent state it's not like\nyou know when you're leveling up and Wow\nlike once you hit level 14 you're no\nlonger Bumble 14 right you're never\ngonna be level 13 again we think about\nlife is sort of a linear progression is\nit not well there are moments of\nenlightenment linear progression a\nit's more or less an acceptance and a\njust a complete acceptance of the linear\nprogression III think more so\nokay so I'll unpack what that means in a\nsecond but like like let me just point\nout to you that like even in your words\nright you call it a moment of\nenlightenment it doesn't imply a linear\nprogression it implies temporary because\nit's a moment oh yeah right so so the\nfirst thing that we can understand about\nmoments of enlightenment is that they\nfluctuate so it's not like you level up\nand then you're more enlightened than\nyou were the day before it's not a\npermanent game it's a fluctuates of\nconsciousness I do feel like learning\nmore things and having more experiences\nand thinking more does help me have them\nmore often them but there's a very\nimportant subtlety there right okay you\ncan level up your capacity to some of\nthem more often but they in themselves\nare not permanent that's a big\ndifference you can level up your ability\nyou can level up your odds to have a\nmoment of enlightenment but the moment\nof enlightenment is not something that\nyou can level up no it's it's it's\nperfect yeah and then it goes right so\nlike like what we're talking about is\nincreasing the odds but we're not\ntalking like there's a big difference\nbetween you know it's like how can I say\nthis okay so like in wow we've got\ndifferent colors of loot right yeah and\nand so like at the end of the day like a\ntreasure chest has a certain like loot\ntable and so we can level up the quality\nof our treasure chest just because we\nare getting a high quality loot doesn't\nmean that we're gonna get a high quality\nloot next time it's like each treasure\nchest is its own roll of the dice each\nmoment of enlightenment is a temporary\nthing that has a one-time result you\nhave that moment of enlightenment or you\ndon't have that moment\nright so I'm just pointing out that\nthere's a fluctuant there that's not\nlinear a flexion so it's not linear\nright so it's not like a moment of\nenlightenment it's not like you left up\nand then you're enlightened more you can\nlevel up to increase the quality of\nchests that you get but at the end of\nthe day whether you get the moment of\nenlightenment or not is still like a\nvariable like it's not yeah you don't\nyou well you don't have it all the time\nyeah I think this is something that I\nremember I think that it was like yeah I\nthink somebody has like Mother Teresa or\nsomebody like that what they what they\npray for and they said prayed for faith\nand it was kind of a weird answer to me\nbecause you'd assume that somebody who\nis such a devoted you know servant of\nGod would not need to worry about that\nno but even the most desert devoted\nservants still also pray for faith yeah\nis that kind of what you're saying\nabsolutely right so because I think of\nfaith what they talk about so here's\nwhat I think a moment of enlightenment\nand then is I'll sort of give you and\nnow I'm gonna give you a paradigm\ninstead of asking questions you're\nwelcome to attack or poke holes in it\nokay so movements of enlightenment or\nfluctuations of consciousness and\nconsciousness fluctuates right like we\nknow that consciousness you have\nsleeping and you have waking and then\neven in waking consciousness you have\ndifferent modes you have lazy\nconsciousness and you have non lazy\nconsciousness and the frustrating for a\nlot of lazy people is that they're able\nto do the right thing sometimes but then\nwe have the perception of linearly\nlevelling up and then they wake up the\nnext day and they're not able to clean\ntheir room the way they were the day\nbefore and they're like how the [ __ ]\ndoes that woman because I could do it\nyesterday I should be able to do it\ntoday but no that's not how it works\nbecause it's not linear it's just the\nstate of your consciousness at a\nparticular time allows you to do things\nor not do things like sometimes if you\nrun away from the dentist and sometimes\nyou face the dentist and the interesting\nthing is that you would assume logically\nthat like they're in the moments that\nyou face your dentists your fear is\nlower and because your fears\nthat's why you're able to face them we\nactually look at the data that's not\ntrue your fear is always the same\nsometimes you're able to conquer your\nfear in other times you're not right\nokay and so what's happening is that the\nstate like it's like now like it's not\nthat we level up our character it's that\nlike the controller that we're using\nsometimes works really well and has\nreally tight controls and does what you\nwant it to and sometimes the controller\nyou're using is unplugged and when the\ncontroller unplug is functional\ncontrollers it's a really dysfunctional\ncontrol your character is the same but\nlike sometimes you can activate your\ncharacter and sometimes you can't\nactivate your character yeah sometimes\nyou can be you can overcome things and\nsometimes you can I think that dichotomy\nof instead of trying to lower your fear\nyou're effectively making your\ncontroller better is that kind of what\nyou're saying yes right so what I'm\nsaying so like I'm just I'm trying to\npoint out to you that you say that you\nhave these moments of enlightenment and\nlike it's weird right because you're\nsaying they can happy happen when I'm\nsad and when I'm gonna be and that's\nlike an odd thing odd observation but\nlet's not let our preconceptions shape\nthe data let's accept our data for what\nit is and change our notion of how the\nworld works so moments of enlightenment\nare independent of happiness and sadness\nmoments of enlightenment or temporary\nthere are things that you can do to\ncultivate the occurrence or moments of\nenlightenment which you can't ever make\nthem\nyou can't ever guarantee them I am all\ntoo familiar with that getting loot in\nWorld of Warcraft yep absolutely right\nfundamental understanding come on yes\nyes so you can set yourself up to get\nwhatever you know illidan's war glaives\nor whatever that that first orange loot\nwas before weeks but there's nothing you\ncan do to like like you can set yourself\nup to get that drunk don't like at the\nend of the day there's a certain amount\nof rnjesus involved and that's how\nmoments of enlightenment work right at\nthe end of the day you can't ever\n8:1 so now the question becomes okay\nhold on let me think about this so now\nwhere do we go from here okay we were\ntalking about death you with me so far\noh absolutely okay so now I'm gonna hold\non let me just think\nOh huh hello okay don't yell okay all\nright all right all right\napparently I'm destroying people to here\ndrive I guess I decided to yeah\napologize guys for you know destroying\nyour eardrums okay let me think about\nthis okay so now we figured out a couple\nof moment actually beat some moments of\nenlightenment right okay so then we were\nalso talking about laziness we were\ntalking about the fear of death do you\nwant to know what's weird is that I\nthink the moments of enlightenment and\nenable the laziness tell me about that\nwell I mean I think that fundamentally\nthe understanding of you know kind of\neternity and infinity makes the current\nproblems that you have seem less\nimportant\nI think that really matter anyway you\nknow what I mean yes I think that the\nmoments of enlightenment this is subtle\nI don't think the moments of\nenlightenment actually encourage\nlaziness I think the moments of\nenlightenment are hijacked by the part\nof you that is lazy to justify its own\nends because during the moment of\nenlightenment your laziness actually\ndecreases drastically what happens is\nwhen the the laziness returns to your\nmind it takes the experience of the\nmoment of enlightenment and it uses it\nfor its own ends I progressed\nso it's a subtle difference but it's\nvery important so when you actually are\nin a moment of enlightenment you're the\nvery opposite of wasy\nyeah you're not controlled by your\nemotions you don't seek distraction and\nthen what happens is the lazy [ __ ]\nslides back in and he's like hey you\nremember how you were enlightened\nearlier if you were enlightened earlier\nlike we don't need to worry about\nanything bro yeah yeah everything's\ngonna be fine dude just don't just don't\nworry about it it is what it is exactly\nso but now let's think about it don't\nworry about it bro\nis that a thought that comes from the\nmoment of enlightenment or something\nthat it isn't the moment of\nenlightenment I don't know that's a\nreally interesting question do you think\nthat it doesn't yes so I think that the\nmoment of enlightenment has a very\nsimilar thought but in a completely\nopposite direction so there's a huge\ndifference between apathy and detachment\nso the moment in the moment of\nenlightenment you can acknowledge that\nthings are as they are and you cannot\ncontrol them and that's okay and yet let\nus and let us not be concerned about the\nfuture let us do the thing that we need\nto do now and there's a very very smooth\nthere's just a Razors Edge between\ndetachment which is letting go of the\nconsequences of your actions\nnot concerning yourself or being\ncontrolled by the future and accepting\nfully what is in the present there's a\nthere's\njust a razor judge between them and\napathy which is the future doesn't mean\nyeah the nihilism of good yep right so\nit's it's a very subtle difference but\nit's like it's soft but it's gigantic\nit's the difference between what I would\ncall detachment which is Vairagya in\nsanskrit and apathy III actually I\nreally like I like that a lot I I agree\nI think that growing up I was just very\nused to just detaching myself from\nthings and you know accepting things for\nhow they are and because of that I don't\nreally it's hard for me really to\nmotivate myself to do something because\nI can just very easily not care about it\nso there is a difference so I think\nyou're doing both I think growing up you\ndid both so there's a difference between\nnot caring right so like just think\nabout this so there's a difference\nbetween not caring and and appreciating\nwhat you need so I think when you were\ngrowing up I do think you had moments of\nenlightenment that's why I think you\ngrew you were a hippie despite being\npoor because at the end of the day that\nyou know the end of the day what I did\nfor both the guy in jail and the\ninvestment banker is teaching them\ndetachment and both of them got happier\nhas nothing to do with your external\ncircumstance yes oh I think what you\nwere able to do growing up is like wreck\nlike appreciate your life for what it\nwas even though it may not have been\ngood right there's a difference between\nappreciating it for what it is and not\ncaring about it okay I think your not\ncaring is laziness appreciation and\nacknowledging it for what it is is the\nmoment of enlightenment yeah I I I think\nthat is definitely a razor's edge and\nit's like enlightenment versus nihilism\nand oftentimes it's you know it's really\njust making those moments of\nenlightenment and everything making them\nfundamentally more healthy in a moment\nenlightenment is is perfectly healthy\nyou can't make it more healthy but you\ncan make more healthy is the\nlaziness that uses the moment of\nenlightenment as ammo for its own ends\nall right yeah right so that's the\ncomplex that you need to work on which\nis like what is that type of mind that\ntakes your moments of enlightenment and\nuses them in the opposite direction from\nwhat your moment of enlightenment\nactually does yeah I don't really know\nwhat that is\nyeah right yeah I don't really know I'm\nnot sure okay so let's talk about it so\nnow we get to laziness okay okay so\nwe've sort of navigated moments of\nenlightenment I feel tempted to ask\npeople a poll because I have no idea if\npeople are following what we're saying\num but anyway we can just keep going\nokay okay can I think most will be able\nto relate to laziness yeah so let's talk\nabout laziness so now now I want okay so\nokay people are saying yes okay fix mic\nokay all right so now let's talk about\nlaziness okay so let's talk about so\nZack what I'd like to do is help you\nunderstand that your mind is not a\nmonolith that your mind is actually like\na 40 man raid and each part of your ray\ndoes like different things and sometimes\nyou're gonna get a Leroy Jenkins in\nthere the laziness is like the Leroy\nJenkins when it takes all the other 39\nparts of your mind that are functioning\nwell and it says [ __ ] you guys we're\ngonna go and then it puts your mind in a\nsituation where like you'll and that's\nwhen you that's like Leroy Jenkins is\nthe reason that you can't get out of bed\nand listen to your alarm clock for three\nhours because there are all these other\nparts of your mind Leroy Jenkins is also\nthe reason why you know that there's\nsomething that you should do which is\ngonna make you feel better but then you\nchoose not to do it and continue\nexisting in the negativity there's a\nthousand voices in your mind that are\nsaying the sangguk get the [ __ ] out of\nbed and there's Leroy Jenkins going then\nhe just charges right in and there's\nlike [ __ ] rusty you guys right that's\nwhat your mind is that makes sense yeah\nokay no that's that's true I mean I\nthink that yeah there's always an\ninternal struggle and the worst part\nabout it is that you know you're\ndoing it when you're doing it like you\nknow you're [ __ ] yourself up you're\nsitting there on your computer not doing\nthe [ __ ] that you need to do not doing\nthe work that you need to do and you\nknow you're doing it and you keep doing\nit yes so how the [ __ ] does that work\nhonestly the best way that I've ever\nfound to understand it is because it's\njust simply easier not to do it I can\nsit there and I am in as you know the\nIsaac Newton you know yes so so that's\nthat's hmm and also a really\ninsufficient understanding right so like\nlet me put it I'm going to rephrase it\nwhen you say it's easier to not do it\nI'm gonna recalibrate that as your mind\nhas like a behavior equation and it has\nreasons to engage in the behavior and\nreasons to not engage in the behavior\nand they're a bunch of variables for\nthat equation and when you say it's just\neasier not to do it what I'm translating\nas is at the end of the day the behavior\nequation is tipping into the negative\nand not doing there's like a really\ncomplex calculation and we can think\nabout like using the Benham right so we\nhave like when do we engage in the\nbehavior of using the meter like when do\nyou go to the bathroom I mean like what\nI need to write but are there times that\nyou need to go that you don't go uh-huh\nyeah I mean like if I'm in the middle of\nsomething I'll put it off until then\nexactly right so we can see that using\nthe bathroom has two variables how how\navailable was the bathroom and how much\ndo I need to go and there may be times\nwhere you go because even though you\ndon't need to go it's highly available\nand there are other times where you\nreally need to go and it has low\navailability so you don't go to the\nbathroom you know over time if you think\nabout like even using the bathroom\nthere's like a little counter in your\nmind that is slowly ticking up and as\nthis as your bladder fills up with urine\nlike it's kind of interesting right like\nyou don't how much you need to go to the\nbathroom it's not like zero to a hundred\npercent it's linear your bladder fills\nup to the to a certain point and the\nand it starts to stretch that's like I\nneed to pee I did the same thing with\nfilling up my car with gas like I'll\nliterally wait for the the light to come\non and then it's like that'll be the one\ntime that I have to be somewhere in\neight minutes and I'll have to get gas\nso like now I'm gonna be late and it's\nlike I think to myself I'm like bro like\nyou could have done this like while you\nwere driving the wind ease yesterday\nafternoon when you had nothing better to\ndo\nyeah but one time I need to do that and\nI it's not doing it I keep doing it and\nit's just it's just like why don't you\npee every hour it's because your your\nbody is not signaling it's like once we\ncrossed the bladder stretch threshold\nthen it's time to be and what you\nperceive is laziness is that your mental\nbloom is not being stretched until it's\nready to stretch and this is sort of\nlike well we kind of operate between and\nlet me know if I lose you okay so like\ngenerally speaking gamers operate on an\naxis of desperation and complacency and\nthere's like you're complacent and then\nyou get desperate and then you're\nprompted to action and then once your\ndesperation goes away like you look back\nat yourself and you're like wow I\nstudied like 18 hours in 16 hours and\nthat was amazing and like I can't\nbelieve my didn't and then you go back\nto being lazy you're like back into the\ncomplacency and then now I don't have to\ndo it anymore\nexactly so then you're back to\ncomplacent so then complacent complacent\ncomplacent complacent complacent bladder\nis filling up filling up filling up\nfilling up filling up stretch and then\nit's like oh [ __ ] I got to do all this\n[ __ ] now I could have done it all that\nduring during that time but that's not\nhow we work so we have this really\ncomplicated behavioral mechanism in our\nmind that prompts us to do things and\nnot do things and it is my belief that\nis the it is the lack of understanding\nof that behavioral mechanism which we\ninterpret is lateness I I like that a\nlot I think that that's a very good\nmetaphor yes I think that's very good\nnow let's think a little bit let's dig\nin right so tell me about laziness\nwhat do you mean by that I mean having a\nthing that I'm supposed to do and then\nokay let's stop I okay what do you mean\nby supposed to do something that needs\nto happen so like for example does it\nneed to happen well that's the\nconversation I have in my head and it's\nlike actually ah you know we'll see what\nhappens\nright because I've had the worst part\nabout is I've had times where I just put\nsomething off for so long it actually\nwent away like this has happened before\nand so it's it's bad to have that happen\nbecause it really it's bad to have that\nso now now that's just right because\nlike I think the first thing you've got\nto do is recognize that your perception\nof the problem is not actually what your\nbrain sees is the problem and we didn't\neven get to the problem said there are\nthings that I'm supposed to do hold on\nstop for a second what do you mean I\nsupposed because your brain is like bro\nwhy the [ __ ] do you need to clean your\nroom it doesn't make a difference like\nyour brain is not gonna let you walk\nfive miles for a glass of water when you\ncan get it from your sink right like\nyour brain is fundamentally like this\nthe other thing is we're not lazy we're\nefficient we're designed to be efficient\nlike kids do you know do you know why\nkids skip wife gives skip school know\nwhy they skip like you know what\nskipping is like physically oh oh it's\nkind of weird I like kids skip they\nstart skipping at some point in their\nlife and then they stop skipping like\nwhat the [ __ ] is up with that then it\nhappens like what what age of kids skip\nseven yeah it's [ __ ] weird what's\nwith that the reason that they skip is\nbecause due to their height their muscle\nand their beanies skipping is the most\nefficient way to move there's a certain\nlike magical ratio when they're a\ncertain age where skipping is actually\nlike more efficient than like walking or\nrunning and it's a very brief window and\nonce they like cross that certain\nthreshold they don't do it anymore and\nhere's the other thing that I weird\nquestion you ever seen\nkid skip no cuz they don't hit that body\nmass ratio that's why fat kids don't\nskip\nit's like bizarre like our brain is\nconstantly iterating to make things as\nefficiently as possible\nI okay so do you feel like is obviously\nthere are certain people you know with\nthe the wide spectrum of people's like\nsizes and muscle masses and everything\nin adulthood do you feel like the reason\nwhy people don't do it as much in\nadulthood is because of the social norm\nso skipping naturally disappears like by\nthe time you're like 12 right like you\ndon't see me major skipping okay\nand that's just because it becomes\ninefficient it's just an efficient way\nof movement so it's it's completely\ninefficient for an adult no matter what\nyou have adult are yep absolutely\nit's like it and that's why they start\nat 7 it's inefficient for a\nfive-year-old efficient for a\nseven-year-old and like by the time you\nhit 12 or 13 it becomes inefficient well\nwhenever you see people skipping usually\nafter like a really happy event happens\nin their life you know I like you see us\nin movies all the time how does that fit\ninto it is that just kind of because at\nthat point it's an emotional expression\nit's good it's not a mode of movement\nbut like words will skip when they're\nnot happy they'll just skip like they'll\njust yeah transit from one place to\nanother through skipping and it's just\nlike a weird phenomenon right like as\nthey just start doing it around the age\nof seven and then they sort of like to\nstop and some some fat kids do skip by\nthe way but yeah I'm sorry for asking so\nmany questions about this no idea yeah\nokay I think that you're right about\nbeing efficient I'm I've always been I\nmean I'm so efficient now that you know\nI found a way to have people pay me to\nsit at home and play video games\nyeah like I consider that this is the\npinnacle of my efficiency no absolutely\nright and so it's also the pinnacle of\nyour laziness yes so like let's start by\nsort of so you say it's things that I'm\nsupposed to and then then you say I need\nright and then you use this word need\nand where do you get the idea that you\nneed to because your brain is like hey\nbro like in the past you've thought that\nwe've needed to do things and you turned\nout to be [ __ ] wrong so why am i\ngoing to invest all of this time and\nenergy to do something that is\nunnecessary I'll give you a pretty a\npretty strong need and my teeth see that\nmissing teeth I'm also missing other\nteeth that are easier to see or sorry\nharder to see they're not gonna grow\nback and it gets worse every day\nwhy do I not fix it well I'm lazy and\nI'm afraid of doing it that's\nfundamentally what it is okay and like I\nand and this is how lazy I I really am\nthese teeth are fake but I only fix this\nside because I always look at this\nmonitor to stream with and I never\nreally look this direction on stream so\nnobody really ever sees that one okay so\nlet's let's unpack a beautiful example\nokay so let's think about this like so\nwhat is your brain I'm gonna read I'm\ngonna read I'm gonna re brain that out\nof laziness okay you ready for it so the\nfirst thing is like why do you fix one\nside because your brain is like hey bro\nwe only really need one side because\nthis is the way that in streams so like\nwhy would we fix both sides if we only\nneed one side it's pretty [ __ ]\nridiculous when you verbalize it isn't\nit no it's not ridiculous at all what\nI'm telling you is it's the exact\nopposite of ridiculous it makes perfect\nsense you even know why you fix the one\nside because you only need to fix one\nside well here's the problem though is\nlike I believe this is true too but then\nI tell other people that and they think\nthat I'm crazy yeah so I want you and\neveryone else at home to start with the\ndefault of you're not crazy because very\nfew people in the world are crazy just\nbecause you don't understand how you\nwork does not mean that you're\nmalfunctioning this is the biggest\nproblem with our entire generation agree\nwith you entirely by a hundred percent\nagree they assume that ignorance be\nhums malfunction when it has been my\noverwhelming experience that like the\nworld makes sense and that human beings\noperate like not randomly like we're not\nrandom right we have all these organ\nsystems we have a brain our brain is a\nsuper complicated organ it's not a super\ncomplicated organ it hasn't grown itself\nevolved to be this malfunctioning organ\nit's in fact the exact opposite our\nbrain is a hyper functional organ which\nhas allowed us to dominate the earth and\nlike Hubble into space and we think that\nthe thing is fundamentally busted\nbecause it doesn't want to fix a one\nside of your mouth like no man like your\nbrain has a damn good reason and you\neven know what that is so now let's work\ngood I'm very good at intellectualizing\nthings for me not to do because well it\nis a good reason in that context but if\nyou only eat with one side of your mouth\nlet me tell you there are problems that\nthat causes sure and yeah and ultimately\nI just don't think about those problems\nand that that's it and so even though I\nknow it will become more and more of a\nproblem as time goes on I just kind of\nlet it happen\nyep yeah I think that's really okay just\nstop talking for a second sorry they're\njust just once I I don't want to lose\nbecause you're saying so much good [ __ ]\nI literally have to write it down\nbecause I need to respond to it so once\nI wore it no problem\nI know sometimes this comes across as\nbeing an [ __ ] I really don't mean\nthat but like you were just talking\nabout pure gold and the answer is right\nthere so I really want to capture this\nokay I'm used to dealing with [ __ ]\nall day this is not actually being an\n[ __ ] trust me okay\nyeah okay okay I'm pulling it closer to\nme and the gain is down okay thank you\nokay okay feet oh [ __ ] I lost damn it\ndon't me say what I said before\nnope\nyou\nokay okay yeah keep going now okay so\nyeah I think that's kind of what happens\nis I will do something and even though I\nI know that it will have a bad long-term\neffect I will just do it because the\nshort-term effect is worth it to me and\nyou know for for some degree I don't\nreally like I don't like going to the\ndentist it'll make me take time off of\nstreaming so it would just be easier for\nme to just simply put it off and\nintellectualizing these problems and\nthinking them through and rationalizing\nwell I can I'm really good at this I'm\nreally good at that it's the same as I\ncan video games you know you have like\none person that's really good at doing\nyou know spell that you know casting\nmagic spells and another person who's\nreally good at you know shooting a bow\nand arrow and I always intellectualize\nthis is I'm very good at doing certain\nthings and very bad at doing other\nthings okay\nI completely agree yeah so this is what\nwe're gonna do okay hold on a second\nokay I'm gonna do a little bit of a\nscreen show okay I'm gonna actually try\nto draw out an equation for you okay do\nthis I'm gonna switch and then I also\nhave to screen show you a screen not do\nthat\nyou can't see this can you not right now\nno you right-click the transcript yeah\nthere we go now okay can you see me okay\nyes and you guys okay so now we're gonna\nwe're gonna unpack the behave we're\ngonna call this laziness right so tell\nus that this problem is gonna be\nwhy doesn't Jack get his teeth fixed\nright so your answer is because I'm lazy\nand scared oh well no no no no no no no\nno okay we'll get there because you're\nlazy right this is the conception that\nyou have okay so let's think about let's\nthink about I'm gonna put an equal sign\nhere I don't know exactly how this is\ngonna work cuz I'm working this out okay\nso like let's say that oh actually let's\nlet's do it this way let's do a plus\nfallin and a minus call\nokay so reasons to see see the dentists\nand reasons to not see the cons okay so\nlike in so what we want to do is like\neither this is gonna be this way or it's\ngonna be this way\nright it's gonna be either more so and\nthen basically as long as you're winning\nthis it's gonna be a complete mess okay\nso as long as it's this way this means\nyou don't see that that de stright yeah\nand and as long as this is what you're\ndoing we call this lazy do you see that\nOh conclude like if you're gonna let\nthis you call it lazy right yeah okay\nso so let's think about reasons to not\nsee the dentist you're afraid okay\nreasons to see the dentist your teeth is\nbroke yes\nokay so that\nlet's think about this for a second so\nyou have the capacity to not think about\nthings and distract yourself right yep\nso what do you think if I were to I'm\njust kind of run with me for a second\nright so like what distraction does is\nessentially decreases the value of this\nvariable yeah pretty much do you see\nthat okay so the better you are at\ndistracting yourself what happens to\nyour laziness or it goes up absolutely\nright so like yeah\nfor us gamers like here's the problem\nthere's like boomer distractions which\nis like one downward arrow and then\nthere's video games which are designed\nto make you forget so what video games\nactually do is they shot off the parts\nof your brain that experience negative\nemotion so there's huh if you ever had a\nday where like your internet didn't work\nand it was like the most productive day\nof your whole month\nI think that's yeah I actually haven't\nsorry but I can totally get behind what\nyou're saying yeah because I remember\ndays where my internet didn't work and I\njust painfully tried to distract myself\nin tons of unsatisfying ways but still\nended up procrastinating that's honestly\nmy recollection of days when entire that\ndidn't work I didn't have a computer I\ndidn't become productive\nI just distracted myself and enjoyed\nmyself less yeah I sometimes I'll\nactually have a very productive day if I\nmy computer stops working or my internet\nstops working because there'll be\nnothing else for me to do yeah that's\nreally awesome I'm glad you can have\nthat experience I think unfortunately\nmany people don't have even that\nexperience so let's let me ask you this\nokay so now let's think about it's more\nand more of a problem so there's more\nand more of the problem go on the plus\nside or the minus side whoa I mean like\nit'd go on the plus side absolutely yeah\nwhy is it doing this thing\n[ __ ]\nyou\nthere we go okay so now we're gonna\nlearn something really important about\nthe brain okay when it comes to the\nbrains behavior thing how does it rank\nfuture rewards versus presents I mean to\nask mobile game developers this you know\nthe instant gratification is king yeah\nso I want you to understand that that\nlike there's something funny going on\nright like you say it's more and more of\na problem in that it's gonna be a\ncatastrophic it's gonna be catastrophic\nin the future so you wouldn't think that\na catastrophic result in the future is\ngoing to bias you towards action today\nyeah but here's the funny thing is like\nthe further off in the future it is the\nless important it becomes because that's\njust how our brain works right like the\nanimals that survive are the ones that\nlike sort of bias themselves towards the\npresident like when when there were\nprimitive human beings who are being\nfaced by tigers and if they thought a\nlittle bit like if they thought in that\nmoment about okay like if the tiger\nattacks me and I lose a limb I won't be\nable to harvest or so my fields so like\nthat's gonna be a real problem like no\nlike that's dumb like the the human\nbeings who survived were the ones who\nfaced the immediate problems right and\nso like the the issue here is that sure\nit's gonna be more of a more of a\nproblem in the future but like today\nwhat do you do instead play video games\nabsolutely right\nso so just because it's gonna get worse\nand worse every day that's not actually\na reason for you to like do something\nabout it today it just means that you\ndon't have to do something about it\ntoday because you can do something about\nit tomorrow\nand then tomorrow rolls around and you\ncan do something about it tomorrow so in\na weird way yeah right\nright yeah so let's think about a couple\nof other things\noh yeah so let's like think about this\nright so like so let's think about one\nside of the mouth okay so if we change\nthis to one side of the mouth like if\nwe're thinking about one side yeah the\nmouth how does that change your equation\nbecause like then is there an immediate\nbenefit of getting your teeth on one\nside of your face fixed yes there is is\nthat way right yeah it would help this\nstream I I don't there I'm fine\nportraying myself as a degenerate but I\ndo draw the line that missing teeth\nright so it's like what the interesting\nthing is that then what happens is like\ntoday moves over here\nyeah and then once today moves over here\nwhat do you do just forget about know\nwhat whenever you get it fixed right cuz\nyou by that's oh yeah yeah right yes so\nthat's that's why guys like there's an\nimmediate benefit to it which is that\nwhen you stream you're not gonna look\nlike a complete degenerate in life and\nlike this this isn't gonna make you look\nlike a complete degenerate for a long\ntime but like you don't want to look\nlike it you're okay with looking like a\ncomplete degenerate a year from now your\nbrain is even though it terrifies you\nright and this is the other interesting\nthing is that the more emotions that you\npack in based on your future failures\nhow does that affect our diagram as you\nthink about being a degenerate in the\nfuture what do you think that does to\nyour laziness uh well it depends I mean\nlike it could make you want to be less\nlazy because you wouldn't want to be a\ndigital right in the future or you could\njust put more of it off into the future\nand think I you know what you know\nthat's not happening me right now I'll\ndeal with that then okay so let me ask\nyou a question great answer where -\nwhich column does shame going less lazy\nor more lazy both okay\nexcellent so let's think about how can\nit be both well I mean you go to the\ndentist and they're like you know they\ntell me about other stories about other\npeople who have had the same problem and\nit's like yeah this person was addicted\nto crack this person was homeless or\nwhatever and then it's me yeah this\nperson was just lazy I mean you kind of\nfeel like a jackass okay so how does\nthat prompt you does that tip the\nbalance towards doing something or away\nfrom doing something away from because I\nyou know self.cards even confronting it\nyep so shame goes over here right\nthe funny thing is that like the more\nand more of a problem is it is that\nincreases your sense of shame and as\nyour shame increases you you become more\nlazy does that make sense um yes it does\nI think there's there's another like\nweird kind of circumstantial variable\nwith this which is they told me that\nthey were gonna have to pull out all of\nmy teeth and then now they're telling me\nthat they're not cuz I'm seeing a new\ndentist so before the reason I didn't\nget it fixed as I just said [ __ ] it\nthey're gonna pull them all out anyway\nI'll deal with it later and you now yeah\nI have more of like a immediacy of\nfixing it okay yes so so now now we can\nsee like so you see how today puts it in\nthis column and future puts it in this\ncolumn so you're even saying I have more\nurgency because like you can't yes\nbecome less future-oriented it's become\nmore present oriented yes\nokay well because I thought before the\ndamage was already done and so it was a\nguy you know what who cares right now\nthere's no alteration there's no\nalteration over your trajectory if the\ndamage is done so why would you rent it\nyeah\nthat's it's lazy eats but yeah okay sure\nit's annoying to eat so so now now I'm\ngonna ask you so like now the question\nZack is like okay so all this stuff is\nis great all ocher dr. kay\nwhat the [ __ ] do I do about it right so\nlet's think about this for a second okay\nyou know how can I adjust these\nvariables to tip the balance in the\nother way if I want to do this like this\nif I want this to happen what do i what\ncan I do to this equation to like make\nthe arrow tip this way lose the shame\nabsolutely right so now that's why\nthat's why I showed people on my stream\nso that's who one is Shane okay when I\nstep you chain okay sure except one uh\nIII think be less afraid okay you know\nin my kind of the in the same is like\nthere's a moment of enlightenment\nthere's also moments of courage okay\nokay take aim and your thumbs so we're\nactually gonna put moment of\nenlightenment over here right so let me\nask you when you have a moment of\nenlightenment what is it due to your\nlaziness well we were talking before\nabout how it kind of hi Jackson laziness\nso I Jackson after work not during them\nor during it um yeah III think I I\nusually just I do what I need to do\nright\nexactly good way to San yeah so moment\nof enlightenment goes over here so the\nlaziness paradigm we'll talk about in a\nsecond but then what else can you do to\nanything else that you can see in this\nequation that we could adjust to\ndecrease your laziness\na lot of ways that you could say it but\nmake that the future the future is more\nfinite and so because it's more finite\nthen this is not the way I'm going to\nrepresent Oh perfect\nright yes and now now you said there's a\nlot of ways that you can say this is the\nfirst thing that I want to point out to\nyou is doing this logically doesn't help\nright telling yourself that you\nshouldn't be ashamed or that you\nshouldn't have fear and logically trying\nto overcome your fear or play around\nwith this philosophizing laying in your\nbed how does that affect your laziness\nit really doesn't very thinking about\nyour emotions does not actually change\nthem okay so thinking and telling\nyourself I need to be focused in the\npresent does not change it right like\nnow we get to Vidya and yawn Vidya\ndoesn't change behavior or very rarely\nbut it's not a good predictor of\nbehavioral change\nyawn is a changes through experience\nright so like like this is where there's\na shift in mindset to be present focus\nversus future focus and this is like\nwhat all the Buddhists are talking about\nlike what there wasn't a philosopher\nit's become a philosophy it's become\nsomething that's posted on Instagram\nit's become something that's tweeted but\nBuddha wasn't teaching philosophy he's\nnot a philosopher Buddha was like a\npersonal trainer for the mind he was\nsaying there is a systematic process to\ntake your mind from here and move it\nhere there's a systematic process of\nchanging your mindset to be present\nfocused as opposed to future focused you\ncan literally train your mind huh okay\nyou're looking at it more functionally\nabsolutely it's all functional and then\nwe have so on the opposite side of\nfunctional is something that the\npsychotherapist stumbled upon and they\nsaid that if we actually sit with a\ntherapist and talk about your fear and\nshame something magical happens people\nstart putting their lives together it's\n[ __ ] weird like\nI can talk to someone like I it's weird\nI can talk to someone about you know how\nthey were bullied in high school and\nthen they start eating out I mean eating\nhealthy and working out and the reason\nit's like not connected at all it's not\nlike they're coming in and talking to me\nabout like because sometimes they do\nthat people will come in and they'll say\nlike how do I start working out and then\nI give them a plane right I say like\nokay you need to wake up every day\nhere's your personal trainer you got to\ngo to the gym eat these kinds of\ncalories and then what happens act when\nI give them a plan for being healthy\nthey stop on January 2nd absolutely\nright because that's not a workout plan\nis like maybe a little bit over here but\nit's very small it's tiny\nwell it's it's an emotional you have to\novercome and emotionally I agree with\nthat I know that like so one way that I\novercame this with like keeping my house\nclean is that I live with my mom and I\nremember I was showing it was like\nsomething that I had done for her\nrecently and someone said that you know\nwell you should be doing this all the\ntime because you're letting your mom\nlive in a [ __ ]\nwhich is like for me this is the norm\nbut I thought to myself it's like I am\ndoing that and I should be doing that\nand that emotional webberley\nrevelation it wasn't like logical the\nemotional revelation of knowing that I\nwas allowing this to happen to her has\ncaused me to be much more proactive and\nkeeping the house clean and making\nthings like you know I there were like\nholes in the wall where rats were coming\nthrough and I cover all those up and I\nkept it clean because I realized that\nwhat I was doing and the laziness that I\nwas exhibiting were it was something\nthat was hurting somebody else okay it\nwas selfish\nso now we're gonna understand three\nthings me is over here yeah other people\nhe's over here what do you think about\nthat\nyeah I'd say that's right\nso the first thing is you said that you\nhad to overcome emotion so now when\nyou're kind of saying like you know at\nthe beginning of this conversation you\nwere like talking about death I don't\nthink is gonna be productive and I\ncompletely agree with you because\novercoming emotions is not thinking\nabout emotions you use the word and it\nis AK I think you understand this stuff\nreally well because of your language use\nthe word emotional revelation a\nrevelation is not a logical conclusion\ndo you see that it's like like\nrevelation doesn't imply a logical\nthought process it implies a white hole\nin them it literally of Revelation is\nrevealed and revealed is something that\nyou are the recipient of not something\nthat you take action you are\nfundamentally not control when it comes\nto emotional revelation it is the loot\nbox all over again\nit is the chest it is the moment of\nenlightenment I think I've had that\nhappen a few sorry guys good okay yeah\nsorry okay working on it yeah that\nhappened a few times with like different\nsituations and the point where you know\nthings that used to bother me just for\nwhatever reason stopped bothering me\nyeah like that's weird right like how do\nwe even deal with that like what's up\nwith that oh I think it depends on the\nthing I used to be very self-conscious\nabout the way that I looked and then I\nthink that as time went on I just\naccepted it and it was who I got you\nknow I am Who I am okay so that's so so\nnow like like okay so now like you're\nreally starting to sound like a\nmeditation catalog is that bad or good\nno I mean it's great like this is why\nthis is what would that was saying but\nit's not philosophy and it's not stuff\nthat you retweet retweeting it doesn't\nmatter but acceptance goes over here\nright well it it's fundamental\nacceptance right like I'm very very\nskinny and I used to like not want to\ntake my shirt off in the pool or\nwhatever and I think that this might\nsound bad boy people making fun of me\nabout it all the time on on Twitch and\nlike just constantly like giving it to\nme and just [ __ ] with me about it\nlike I just eventually got it sounds\nlike whatever you know like I'm not\ngonna apologize to these people so Who I\nam yeah so so that that is do you see\nhow you used to have shame and then you\nmove towards acceptance somehow but it\nwasn't logical it wasn't like you woke\nup one day and you said hey this is\ngonna I'm gonna they're gonna keep on\nmaking fun of me until I get used to it\nand then my thick my skin will get thick\nand then I will accept that I'm skinny\nthat's not how it works it's a\nrevelation it's something that happens\nto you it's not something that you do\nokay right and now we get to the root of\nlazy because what we're talking about\nhere is that you cannot actually do\nanything\nit's about stuff that happens to you\nit's not about logically working through\nyour fear and your shame it's not about\nit's about Revelation right it's about\nmindset these are things that happen to\nyou they're not things that you do and\nnow we get to this idea of like the\nreason that you believe you're lazy is\nbecause you believe you're in control\nbut you're not in control you can't\nactually get your teeth fixed what you\ncan do is potentially see a therapist\nand roll the dice to see if you can\ncleanse the fear deep off in the shame\ndebuff you can roll the dice or you can\ntrain yourself to be present focused\ninstead of future focused and each of\nthese things that you do like look at\nthis equation what do you think is gonna\nhappen with lazy oh I think it'll go\ndown if I lose those two things\nabsolutely and then you'll start acting\nso it's not that you're lazy it's that\nyour behavioral equation calculates you\nto inaction\nand the problem is that you don't\nunderstand any of this stuff because\nlike here's the biggest problem is that\nlike this is all a black box right this\nis what we see yeah and so then we just\ncall it lazy and so it's no surprise\nthat our entire like you note which is\nlike super lazy why are they super lazy\nit's because they have a ton of fear and\nshame they don't understand they think\nin the future like just think about this\nfor a second they're always thinking\nabout the future one day right they're\nthinking about the future and this is\nthe other thing so past it's back here\nto they think about the future and they\nthink about the past they have a case of\nthe shirt of what it could is and the if\nonlys if only this or only this I should\ndo this I'm supposed to do this I need\nto do this all of those should is not in\nthe present it's in the future if only\nis in the past it's not in the present\nthe other problem that they have and I\nknow you want to jump in but I'm feeling\nthat right now so I'm gonna keep talking\ndo it\nkeep Duffy the other thing is that\nthey're always focused on me and that\ndoesn't mean that they're selfish it\nmeans that if I were to literally\ncatalog the number of thoughts in their\nmind the number of thoughts about\nthemselves far outweighs the number of\nthoughts about other people\ndoesn't mean that they're good thoughts\nthey're just egocentric it's I'm a piece\nof [ __ ] I'm lazy I should do this I\nshould do that that person is so awesome\nand even when you say that person is so\nawesome if it's an appreciation of that\nperson it's not about you even when they\nthink about another person it's in\nreference to themselves it's actually a\nthought about themselves it's a thought\nabout themselves even whenever they're\nthinking about somebody else because\nit's a comparison there are two ways to\nthink about other people\none way is it is a comparison like oh\nthat person is so awesome the other one\nis appreciation an appreciation makes\nthem feel good in comparison makes them\nfeel bad so even when they think they're\nthinking about other people they're\nalways making comparisons to themselves\nand so literally the percentage of time\nthat they\nspend over here is 90% and they only\nspent 10% of time thinking about other\npeople and that's what I was saying\nabout the selfishness exactly and now we\nthink about da da mo which is due to\nyour responsibility because you aren't\nworth it right especially like if you\nhave fear and shame your value as a\nhuman being is pretty low therefore\nyou're not even worth investing in the\nthing that gets you to to clean up your\nplace is a sense of duty for your mom\nand you're like I can visit my it's ok\nif I live in a [ __ ] because I'm me\nbut it's not ok for my mom to live in a\n[ __ ]\nyeah and that thought is not like a\nlogical thought it's also like a\nrevelation well I thought about this I\nactually you know I have no regrets\nI don't even regret letting my teeth rot\nout because the reason why I started\nstreaming and what motivated me to try\nso hard with streaming is that I knew\nthat if I didn't do that and I wasn't\nsuccessful I wouldn't have any teeth I\ndon't regret a single thing yeah so and\nI I don't really regret any of these\nthings happening and III don't I do\nthink that it should be more about like\nother people too though and and I feel\nlike that's kind of what's ended up\nhappening is that I've tried to focus\nmore on being like being not really a\nservant to other people but being a [ __ ]\nwhat's the word for this\nto fulfill the purpose that way yeah you\nhaven't since are much your street\nscreamer's yeah what you're describing\nis done right like you stream because\nlike you are the thing you streamed for\nthem because you're trying to send them\na signal that you can be a [ __ ] in\nlife and still have a life worth living\nthat's the tournament that's why you\nstream that's a reason to be proud of it\nand happy yeah absolutely\nso like you need to show them that yeah\nand and that's what I was so upset about\nwhenever I had taken two breaks and in\nmy stream I had felt like I had lost\nthem yes I no longer had that that thing\nthat just motivated me you know whether\nyou have a good day or a bad day you are\ngone the next day because there is a\npurpose and the goal that's greater than\nyourself it's not just about you it's\nabout what you represent who you are and\nthe idea so if we look at the equation\nof that there's something very important\nthere which is that generally speaking\nwe operate when it comes to ourselves we\nmove away from pain and we move towards\npleasure we try to avoid pain and we try\nto seek pleasure but the cool thing\nabout Dharma is is like Dharma is what\nallows you to say whether I have a good\nday or I have a bad day I have to keep\nstreaming it's not about whether it\nhurts or not I need to do it for that\nyes right and so like that's the\nbeautiful thing is like Dharma is in in\nmy sense a pretty good answer to\nembracing the negative or embracing the\nthings that are hardened and the biggest\nproblem that people have nowadays is\nthat like they tend to retreat from\nthings that are hard or painful yeah and\nand so in your case like your fear of\nthe dentist like the reason that you're\nnot going to the dentist we can look at\nanything in that equation right so one\nis you can talk about your fear of the\ndentist and if you talk about your fear\nof the dentist and you process it it'll\nstart to wither away and then you'll be\nable to go if you think about okay for\nWho am I getting my teeth replaced\nbecause if I'm getting them replaced for\nme\nit's not worth like like what I would\nencourage you to really think about zach\nis like right now there are what sounds\nlike tens of thousands if not like over\na hundred thousand people that watch you\nand there is something in their life\nwhich is their equivalent of not getting\ntheir teeth replaced and what you owe\nthem is for you to get your teeth\nreplaced and then share with them\nsomething about your perspective of like\neven if it's like like you desert like I\ndon't know exactly what that is but I\nthink this is what you must contemplate\nthis isn't logic this is consolation\nscroll journey huh Joseph Campbell's\nheroic journey what does that mean the\nhero that leaves the village and brings\nthe Boone back from the adventure and\nthen he brings it back to the village\nand empowers the entire village yeah and\nmake them all stronger together so you\nneed to get your [ __ ] teeth fixed\nyeah because you were giving them an\nexcuse to not fix their marks mm-hmm\nthat's not something you can continue\ndoing anymore\nthat makes a lot of sense yeah that does\nmake Watterson's\nyeah\nyes I do\nI I think that's really what it comes\ndown to is making sure that I can be\nthat that representative and I can be\nthat person it's a mantle that they have\ngiven you with their viewership in their\ntime and it's not something that you can\nafford to disappoint them in and it's\nnot just that it's you know like little\nbits and pieces of [ __ ] in my stream\nthat I don't have happen in the right\nway and events that I have just like\nfallen through and I haven't planned out\nproperly many things like that sure but\nyeah each of those things be careful\nbecause you call it [ __ ] I don't\nthink it's [ __ ] there's another\nequation there with things that keep you\nfrom acting when you say I have trouble\nfully committing I make plans yeah\nthat's because it's not because you're\nlazier that you're a [ __ ] it's because\nthere's some complicated process going\non there and the general variables are\ngonna be you versus someone else future\nand past versus present and negative\nemotion there are also all kinds of\nother things but those are the three\nthings that I think like or like I would\nreally encourage you to think about and\nas you unburden yourself those are the D\npops it's like you're you know you're\nrazz debuff like having shame about your\nlife is like having a resurrection\ndebuff and you're just not going to be\nfunctioning only yeah right and then\nthere are some things that you can do\nlike eat healthy which is like just like\nwow like there's like food and potions\nand stuff that you need to use to\nprepare for a raid and if you meditate\nevery day occasionally you'll get\nmoments of enlightenment which will give\nyou like an understanding which will\njust wipe away something that holds you\nback occasionally yeah but from a\nneuroscience perspective we can't count\non that happening because we haven't\nfigured out how to make that happen yet\nwell we do understand is that even from\na neuroscience perspective it's like\ngetting a Stoneskin potent like it's\ngonna protect you a little bit eating\nhealthy or good circadian rhythm\nexercise meditation hanging out with\nother human beings\nsunlight an absence of substances all of\nthese things are going to be buffs can\nyou explain why whenever I was not stree\nI would wake up at 10 p.m. and I would\nplay video games all night long into the\nmorning eating fast food and I was\ncompletely euphoric\nyeah so I what do you mean by euphoric I\nwas incredibly happy there's nothing\nwrong I knew exactly what was gonna\nhappen the day was gonna be great and\nthe only thing that really pulled me out\nof that was the like external variables\nlike you know knowing that I like it\ncan't last forever I guess in a way so\nwas euphoria existential or emotional\nboth I think I was doing what I wanted\nto do so that sounds hedonistic is\nopposed to existential to me so that\nsounds like a pleasurable life but yeah\novertime would have led to an empty one\nand that's what I always you know like I\nhad and I completely agree with you\nbecause you know like I've told people a\nlot of times I never really want to grow\nup etc and people told to me they're\nlike yeah well you don't have to you\nknow you can just do what you always\nhave done and it's like that's true but\nyeah I know exactly what you're saying\nis it will lead to emptiness in a long\nrun so here's what I think I think for\nmost people they think about it how long\nwas that time period oh wait three\nmonths and before that I mean like there\nwere time periods like that for years\nbut we were happy every day for years\nevery day no not every day but most of\nno I'm not talking about emotionally I\nmean like heggs essentially it in what\nway like can you were you fulfilled\nduring the years that you were doing\nthat fulfilled um yes and no in some\nways yes in some ways oh I feel like I\nwasn't making enough like videos or\ncontent I wasn't creating enough yeah so\nthat's yeah so that's where fulfillment\ncomes from so like I want you to\nunderstand this there's a different axis\nand this is what I call spiritual so\nthere's a spiritual happiness with which\nthe Buddha calls Duke which means\nsuffering so he uses the word suffering\nbecause suffering is not an emotion\nright so there's like contentment and\nsuffering which is on one axis and those\nare above the axis of\nindividual emotions like you can be sad\nand content and you can be suffering and\njoyous yeah right there's a laying poor\nand not be right so so those are\ndifferent axes so here's what I think\nabout your three months temped I think\nthat most people think about vacations\nis something that you do for a couple of\nweeks I think some people take vacations\nfor months and what I'm hearing from\nyour three months in is you are\nbasically on vacation and vacations been\nfour years yeah so you may you may be\nsomeone who has a four year vacation\nright like that's okay like I think it's\nfine to be hedonistic for a time and\nenjoy yourself and also to be favored in\nthe will huh not according to my death\nyeah so I don't think that you were\nquite as fulfilled as you think you are\nbut I think that it's fine to be\nhedonist they can fulfilled at the same\nlike I mean that's okay for periods of\ntime like I love it like sometimes I\nwill just let myself go man yeah you\nknow sometimes it's it's an amazing\nfeeling like I'll be like yeah I'm gonna\nget like I'm gonna eat [ __ ] Taco Bell\nand I'm gonna play games until like 1:00\nin the morning\nand it's awesome because my you know I'd\nlove to do that for weeks at a time but\nI tend to get a day every now and then\nbut I think it's fine to be hedonistic\nhedonistic isn't bad like hedonistic and\nfulfillment is possible but I think it\ntends to be temporary because I think\nover time like there's gonna thats gonna\ndecay and then you'll start to feel\nempty well it's like if you have a day\noff that's really exciting but if you're\nunemployed it's not exactly beautiful\nand yeah right so I think I and so I\nthink I think if we really dig into your\nfour-year period I would be very\nsurprised because I think you also were\ngood at distraction right so you're\nprobably like pretty good at suppressing\nthings so there may have been discomfort\nor existential dread or look basically\nsuffering yeah that you were distracting\nyourself from and and you know you kind\nof it's easy to get confused with like\nyou know eating fast food and playing\nvideo games and the dopamine\nlike dopamine is like separate from\nfulfillment mm-hmm\nso that's my take on it yeah I think\nthat's probably true I I feel good about\nit sometimes I think that there's also\nlike a degree where it's like you do\nthat for years and I felt really good\ndoing it like 19 and 20 and then it was\nkind of weird whenever I was like 23\nthere's something and still doing it and\nlike I had had like jobs like off and on\nbut for the most part I pretty much did\nnothing and I went to college and I have\na college degree but I mean I didn't\nreally ever give a [ __ ] about that I\nmainly did that just to get my dad not\nto get mad at me and I guess yeah I feel\nya it would be something that I kind of\njust would do in order to like forget\nabout things and then every once in a\nwhile would take a peek in like the real\nworld we're like I was in like my time\ncapsule of existence yeah it's like yeah\nmy friends are now like they have a\nhouse or that you know back then they\nhad like you know now you're graduating\ncollege and for me I'm not really or at\nthat time and you know I'm just kind of\nclowning around and I'd feel like other\npeople were moving forward with their\nlives and doing things that you know\nwe're meaningful and meanwhile I was\njust stuck there playing video games and\neven though I had chosen that there's a\nthere's like a certain I don't know like\nsadness yeah so I think that it's right\nat the edges right it's there but right\nat the edges so I would I wouldn't be\nsurprised if it wasn't at the edges when\nyou do two or three month vacation I\nthink it like you can still feel\nfulfilled but I know I was the same way\nlike I wouldn't trade it for anything\nlike I remember my third or fourth year\nof college I was there for five years\ncuz I failed a bunch of classes but my\nthird or fourth year I remember my\nfriends had a had a house and I I stayed\nat the frat I mean I lived in a frat\nhouse but like they were used to game\ntogether and I would basically like go\nthere everyday like I would get up in\nthe morning like I was gonna go to class\nbut I only had classes like three days a\nweek but I would get up at the same time\nand I was somewhat functional then and I\nwould go to their house at 8:00 in the\nmorning\nI brought my PC over there\nI still remember I had never had coffee\nfrom a coffee pot like a like a drip\ncoffee machine yeah for whatever reason\nlike I you know I just you know I didn't\ngrow up drinking it or anything and so\nthen like I still remember how delicious\ntheir coffee was I would like go to\ntheir house at eight in the morning I\nwould make myself a cup of coffee and it\nwas awesome and then I would start\nplaying video games at like 8 a.m.\ninstead of going class on Tuesdays and\nThursdays I would go there and I'd play\nvideo games and then a Mazda Monday\nWednesday Friday I would like wake up\nand I would go to class and as soon as I\nwas done I would like finish it like\nnoon or something I'd pick up some kind\nof food and then I'd go to their house\nand I'd play video games and I just like\nlived this amazingly hedonistic\nlifestyle that was just so much fun we\nwould hang out and ha\nwhy'd you stop um and it sounds great\nyeah I mean I I think I stopped because\nI couldn't keep doing it because you\njust knew like eternally yeah so like 50\nyear old around I think I was in fourth\nyear and fifth year old around and then\nI realized that I basically had when I\nstarted my fifth year of college I had\ntwo years left I started I I finished my\nsorry I started my fifth year as a\njunior and then I was like I just cannot\nstand like I've been ignoring this for a\nlong time but I can't be a sixth year\nsenior I just can't like fifth five\nyears of colleges of croquet yeah but\nsix years is just [ __ ] pathetic it is\nI remember I had a friend of mine and he\nlogged on one day in the world of\nwarcraft and he said to us he was like\nguys I'm quitting and I've been in\ncollege for five years I need to get my\nlife together this is ridiculous and I\ncan't keep doing this goodbye and he\nwould before this brag about how he\nwould keep he would retake English one\nor the psychology when I forgot which\none the freshman class so he could hook\nup with freshmen girls every single\nsemester and like apparently his friend\nwatches my stream and the guys getting\nmarried now yeah so in my case it was a\ngirl involved too so I was dating a girl\nwho I was really really into and and and\nalso like she didn't\nknow that like she thought I was gonna\nbe graduating at the end of year five\nand so like I just couldn't face the\nshame of like telling her that I'm still\nnot done so I just I mean when it came\nto that my fifth year I just completely\nbusted my ass and and basically did one\nyear of college each semester so I took\nlike twice a normal course load and just\nso gained actually yeah but you know\njust I was like that's enough like I\ncan't I mean even in the depths of my\nshame it's just like I can't I can't do\nthat to myself enough is enough\nyeah yeah I've had kind of the same\nthing happen before whenever I was in\nhigh school I think I graduated with the\n2.5 GPA and I would actually I would not\ndo certain assignments like I like I\nwould get my like the progress report\nand it would tell me like how much each\ndifferent assignment would be and like\nwhat the grading would be for it and I\nwould math out how to get like an 81 or\nsomething like that and I would just\nplan out which assignments would take\nthe most time and I could put the least\namount of effort into and I would like\nto figure out an equilibrium for that\nand just not do I've ever didn't as\nlittle work as possible\nthere's your laziness yeah it's not\nlaziness its efficiency that was very\nefficient right didn't do a [ __ ]\nthing yep yeah and so I don't know like\nI I think that's the problem is like I\ndo get rewarded for the laziness Sherman\npretty regularly why is that\nwell I mean Bill Gates did say if he\nwanted a problem done he'd hire a lazy\nperson to do it because they'd come up\nwith an easy solution so here's here's\nwhat I think Zac I don't think laziness\nis a problem I think laziness of the\nkind that we described in terms of\nunpacking it and if there are emotional\nthings that are holding back those are\nproblems but I think gamers are [ __ ]\nbrilliant\nso when I work with videogame addicts\nwhat I do is hook them up with\ninternships at MIT I take this guy who\nhas been out like hasn't graduated\ncollege and I dumped him in an AI\nstartup at MIT and then I say go for it\nbro and then like the turnaround is\namazing\nand it's like like we're not like\nlaziness is not a thing and and like I\ndon't think it's a problem that you're\nlazy and in the truest form of laziness\nbecause I think laziness is an umbrella\nterm that covers a lot of these\nemotional things in future thinking and\nlike fantasy and all this other kind of\ncrap\nbut there is part of it that is just the\nlaziness of efficiency yeah and and I\nthink even in terms of healthy game or\nlike the people like basically everyone\nwho works for us or people better form\nour community and what happens is like\nyou take these guys who are like rejects\nand then you you like give them like\nsomething to do that challenges them and\nmakes the world a better place and it's\namazing what they've accomplished and so\nI don't know I don't accept you know I\nthink laziness is fantastic like\nlaziness we we are such a lean and mean\nstartup because we're all lazy and we\nhave no resources and it really is\namazing like we would have lost so much\nmoney if we went the VC route because we\nwould have done stupid things well I'm\nglad that somebody can see the light you\nknow what's the time like I tell people\nthat and I think that I'm crazy and yeah\nI I'm very good at being lazy I've\ngotten I've had 29 years of experience\nyeah so I yeah so there's a dark side I\nthink to it which is what I'm really\ntrying to temper absolutely so I agree\nthat you don't want to you want to be\nefficient lazy but you don't want to be\numbrella lazy right so like it's not an\nexcuse for not getting your teeth taken\ncare of you know and and it's not an\nexcuse for some things but I think at\nthe end of the day if you want to like\neat fast food for a couple months and\ngame for a couple months and like that\nworks out you're not really letting\nanyone down then by all means do that\ntake a break yeah I think that helps me\na lot to just all I kind of mentally\nreset I I'm not really I'm probably more\nintroverted than I am extroverted and I\nthink my stream kind of fulfills that\nextroverted need sure and an app that I\nwant to be the introverted\nyou know troll that just lives in this\ncave and that's about it\nwell yeah anyway so I'm gonna have to\nwrap up in a little bit like any other\nquestions like I mean I'd love to shoot\nthe [ __ ] with you it's fun but I just\nwant to make sure that we kind of got to\nthe things that you want to do I think\nthat we pretty much covered everything I\ndonate this is like it it's it's like\nthe roots of a problem it's like a\nmassive tree and there's all the\nbranches one changes to the other\nbranches you know my camera not working\non stream etc yeah you know that kind of\nstuff and so I I think that's actually a\ngreat way to conceptualize it because I\nI don't want anyone to think so this is\nthe big problem that people have is they\nwatch stream and then you know they see\nlike asmin gold was had all of his\nquestions answered and they think that\nyou're fixed they think that what we do\non stream is we fix people we're not fix\nit like we haven't fixed you we're just\nall we've given you is a road map and\nyou've taken one step and each of those\nbranches needs to be dealt with like\nthat's when you're fixed yeah I I think\nthat's true I mean there's no it's more\nor less giving somebody a tool but they\nhave to do the job absolutely\nso speaking of tools sometimes I teach\npeople how to meditate on stream are you\ninterested in that sure what's doing let\nme just think about if there's a death\noriented meditation we can do I\nI really love I've gained some of my\nmost understanding that I have from the\ntechniques around death and you know\nearlier when I was saying like when we\nwere talking about death and like where\nknowledge comes from I've had some\nreally amazing experiences around white\nlife and death when it comes to\nmeditating I'm just trying to think\nabout you know what can I teach you that\nwill prepare you for learning a death\noriented technique\nokay so I'm gonna teach you something do\nyou meditate uh not not consciously no\nokay I mean what-what do you mean by not\nconsciously then what what do you do\nsometimes I just sit there and I think\nabout things and I kind of let my mind\nwander and you know you you just you\nthink about so many it's kind of like\ncascading uh I guess like series of\nimportances and your wife and you're\nlike thinking about less and less and\nless important things until you're just\nnot thinking about anything okay that\nsounds pretty good\nokay so I'm going to teach you something\nthat we've taught oh let me think about\nthis\nyou\nso we're gonna do just a quick\ndiagnostic test why are you laughing\nlisten AFK of your brain go afk um so\nyeah I'm gonna I'm gonna do a quick\ndiagnostic test and then based on that\nI'm gonna teach you one of two\ntechniques okay all right so one eye so\nclose your eyes and I want you to notice\nthe breath in your nostrils and can you\ntell if one nostril is more open than\nthe other miraculously they seem to be\nthe same but if I had to guess I'd say\nthe left one is more open yeah okay so\npay attention to it for a second and\ncheck yeah yeah it's more of a left one\nthat's one of them okay now what I want\nyou to do is imagine your left nostril\nlike a circle okay\nand\nand what I want you to do is see if the\nbreath has a certain direction within\nyour left nostril like it's all going to\nbe pointing out but is it stronger at\nthe tip versus kind of where your\nnostril hits you're like meets your face\ntowards the middle of your nose or the\noutside of your nose does that leave me\nyeah the the towards the face and middle\nface and middle okay so like if we were\nto think about your nostril as a clock\nface with 12 o'clock being the tip does\nthat make sense to you does that analogy\nmake sense or mmm 7:00 p.m. okay perfect\nso this is a good mystery medication\nright so yeah just sit up straight okay\nso oh man okay so just notice that for a\nsecond could just keep noticing while I\ntry to figure out what to teach you next\nso this is a good diagnosis okay so this\ndoes work right so my instincts were\nspot-on but now what do I do\nyou\nokay so now what I want you to do just\nkeep keep your eyes closed I'm gonna\ndescribe a couple of things I don't know\nif you're gonna be able to do it today\nokay I'm gonna give you sort of a lot to\nwork on okay so the first thing that I\nwant you to think about for a moment is\nthat there's a difference between lazy\nZac and moment of enlightenment Zac that\nthe lazier you are the more Zac you are\nthe more asmin gold you are and in\nmoment of enlightenment you're not\nreally that same person does that make\nsense yeah okay so now what I want you\nto do is pay attention to the person\nthat you are when your breath is at a\nparticular o'clock position okay and and\nwhat I want you to do is throughout the\nday notice which of your nostrils is\nopen and then notice which o'clock\nposition you're at and see if you can\ndiscover any differences in the person\nthat you are depending or correlating\nwith which which o'clock position and\nwhich nostril is open okay okay so it's\nnot something we can do today because\nyou're gonna have to collect a lot buddy\nyes it's very longitude and then I want\nyou to the first axis that I'll give you\nbut by all means explore other things\nlike you can explore your emotional\nstate and things like that but the main\naxis that I think I want you to really\npay attention to is is the axis of like\nmoment of enlightenment versus like\napathy it's like detachment versus\napathy it's like laziness versus being\nable to do or whatever you want to\nfuture versus present like any kind of\naxes that you want to just try to pick\nan axis and I think the most important\none is is the one that's like moment of\nenlightenment versus like lazy Zach\nand then the last thing that I want you\nto do which will give you it can kind of\nanchor your practice is do you live can\nyou see the Sun can you see the sunset\nor sunrise where you live hmm almost\nyeah okay so if you can try to figure\nout when sunrise and sunset are and like\nfor 10 minutes before sunrise in ten\nminutes before sunset no let's say five\nminutes before I want you to try to go\noutside and do this practice and just\nnotice what happens and then the last\npiece of the practice that I'll give you\nI'm giving you normally these things are\ndone sequentially last piece of the\npractice that I'll give you is try to\nfigure out so I'll just leave you with\nthis is as you start to understand what\nis constant and what is changing about\nyou I think you'll start to understand\nmore about death but that okay okay all\nright could take a while so that things\nare to notice you know which nostril is\nopen in which part of the clock your\nbreath is going in you can do that\nseveral times a day I would even\nencourage you to like use a journal or\nsomething to take notes and try to feel\nwho you are in those moments and then\nfive minutes before sunrise in five\nminutes before sunset whenever you can\nmanage it go outside and then just pay\nattention to who you are\nand what I'll kind of leave you with is\nthat there will be some parts of you\nthat would fluctuate in some parts of\nyou that may stay the same and try to\njust try to understand that what about\nyou fluctuates and what about you stays\nthe same okay that makes sense so now\nlet's check in for a second and notice\nthe breath again are we still working\nwith left area we see the left gang yes\nwe were still left again\nare we still seven o'clock yeah okay so\njust see when that changes try to check\nin an hour okay okay right sounds good I\ncan do that yeah all right that's an\ninteresting way to look at it you know\nit's a level of awareness that I'm not\nused to having yeah I'll say that sure\nyeah good yeah I probably I'm gonna use\nthat almost to try to sleep anyway I\nthink that's a good idea focused on very\nsmall things that you know are kind of\nrelevant I feel like helps me you know\nsleep sure yeah okay well is that is\nthat how is that the meditation that I\nshould do yep okay yeah I will try and\ndo that all right yeah cool man\nany um go ahead sorry no you can I'm\njust gonna say like any last thoughts or\nquestions or any I'm curious too I mean\nwhat did you think about our time\ntogether I thought it was really helpful\nI think the breaking down like all the\ndifferent components to how you know\nlaziness manifests itself and what the\ndifferent tricks your mind plays on you\nand you know the you know the kind of\nlike laziness and efficiency being two\nsides of the same coin\nabsolutely and that that metaphor I\nthink was really helpful and I do really\nthink that you do good work here on\nTwitch and that's why I was I was very\neager to come on and and and help be a\npart of it I think this is something\nthat's really important and I think\neverybody here is very thankful for that\nincluding myself thank you yeah well I\nappreciate I really appreciate you\ncoming on and it's a minute you're just\na really like thoughtful guy and and\nit's it's it's a pleasure to speak with\nyou and kind of you know work with you I\nI think I've given you maybe you know if\nyou need some help around the meditation\ntechnique let me know because I kind of\ndumped a lot on your plate usually I\nteach something a little bit more\ndiscreet and just tell them you know\nfocus on this thing but I think you'll\nbe able I think you'll like this\ntechnique a lot yeah thank you very much\nand yeah good luck to you and and I\nreally do hope or uoq are you okay with\ncan I put a burden or expectation on you\nand can we recognize that that could add\nto the plus or it could add to the mine\nside of the column sure go ahead and and\nthat's that I think you need to get your\nteeth fixed yes I this I have a\ntemporary tooth and honestly like I need\nto get that fixed and I've been kind of\nhoping that after the quarantine is over\nI would do that and so I think that now\nit's it's getting pretty close to that\ntime and III need to fix some of them\nbecause I'm worried that they'll fall\ninto the category of needing to be\npulled or whatever very soon yeah so\nthis is uh this is something that weighs\ndefinitely on my mind and and one last\nthought that I have is that if you're\nyou know time passes and over there's an\nacceptable amount of time that can pass\nand if if there's an unacceptable time\nthat passes before you get it fixed\nthen maybe we should have another\nconversation yeah I can see that okay so\nlike today we've talked about the route\nmaybe one day we'll talk about one of\nthe branches yeah\nall right that makes sense okay yeah\nthank you very much thank you Anna\nyeah I look forward to that if it\nhappens but I hopefully in Korea yeah\nhopefully I'll be able to fix it\nthank you very much I really take care\nof I talk to other piece alrighty okay\nso that was fun\nyeah I understand like you know so\npeople used to call it hasn't been gold\nthe raid boss my god I don't I don't see\nit what do y'all think he's a good guy\nman all these guys are good guys\neveryone's saying Mitt Jones and it\nshows this great dude\nlike I saw it\nEllis is fantastic too I'm like I know\nthat these people have had trouble but\nlike I mean we all have struggles but\nlike there's such solid people dude I\ndon't know I don't know what you know I\nI don't know I just don't see it okay so\nlisten guys thank you guys very much for\ncoming on thank you guys hopefully that\nwas helpful um it's interesting we've\nbeen doing a lot of you know I feel like\nI've been doing a lot of like teaching\nmode recently in terms of pulling out\nthe iPad and drawing out diagrams and\nstuff I apologize for my handwriting but\nhopefully it's helpful and I think\nsometimes it's useful to you know see\nthings on paper and yeah and I want I\nwould you know really ask you guys to\nthink a little bit about what we\nunpacked with laziness and like don't\njust judge yourself for being lazy like\ncuz that's gonna contribute to the shame\nwhich in turn is gonna increase your\nperception of laziness it's gonna move\nyou towards inaction\nright that's what laziness that when we\nsay oh I'm lazy what that means is that\nyou don't act and inaction is not like\nit's not a personality trait it's like a\nbehavioral equation and understand what\nthe components of your behavioral\nequation are and work on them because\nsomething magical will happen like\nthat's how people like you know it's\nweird to say like someone turned their\nlife around like how the [ __ ] does that\nwork what's how does that work like\nthere's some system behind turning your\nlife around it's not randomness right\nthere's science and laws of at least\nneuroscience and physics and and\nwhatever like maybe psychology maybe\nsociology but there's an order like\nwe're human beings and there's like a\nway that we work we have a controller\nand if we learn how to use the buttons\nthen we can do what we want without a\ncharacter and I think what laziness is\nis an inability to understand what your\nbuttons do like you don't know how you\nwork and so like no wonder you can't do\nthe things that you want to be able to\ndo but like I need to do it yeah but\nwhat are the reasons that you're not\ndoing it right because there are good\nreasons and the problem is that people\nask the question Oh what are the reasons\nthat I'm not doing it and then they say\nI don't have any good reasons but that's\nincorrect if you're not doing it\nthat's a data point that signifies that\nyou have a good reason to not do it\nyou just have to find what that reason\nis and then you can dismantle it\nit's the invalidation of your reasons to\nnot do something that prevents you from\nactually doing it because you say oh I'm\ndone\nlike I'm just lazy like I don't have a\ngood reason like if someone asks you\nlike why don't you get your teeth fixed\nlike Zach's answer is gonna be because\nI'm lazy that's not a good answer\nthere's like a really good reason why he\ndoesn't get his teeth fixed and you have\nto really respect what holds you back\nand just really think about that like\nyou have to respect that which holds you\nin place because otherwise you're never\ngonna be able to overcome it it's such a\npowerful opponent right and you guys\nstart by like disrespecting your\nopponent and then you doom yourself to\nfailure respect what holds you back\nrespect that if you're going nowhere in\nlife there's a damn good reason for it\nand then once you like treat it with the\nrespect that it deserves then you're\ngonna be way better at dealing with it\nrespect your problems and respect\nyourselves and thank you guys very much\nwe're gonna take next week off from\nstreaming and then we're gonna do a\nbunch of DLCs on on Monday the 22nd we\nhave Yvonne from offline TV on Wednesday"
