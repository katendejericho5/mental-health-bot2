    "transcript": "do I call you Jake and Baker Jake Earth\nJake spot Jake you survived\nokay so Jake can you tell me a little\nbit about yourself and what we're\ntalking about today\nI sure wait what is that one question or\ntwo questions oh yeah we're gonna tell\nyou okay yeah my name's Jake and I'm\nfrom LA okay and I am a stream on Twitch\nI'm known primarily for like IRL\nstreaming or outdoor streaming I lived\nin Japan for almost three years and\nstarted doing IRL streaming out there\nand then okay it kind of turned into\nwhat I do now which is kind of crazy\num also fast and yeah a lot of people\nknow me for being out in Japan but I\nrecently moved back home to LA just to\nkind of make a home base again okay in\nthe midst of kind of weird times but\nyeah so I'm back home cool and yeah what\nwe talked about today I think is I\nactually have I'm not I think it's just\ngeneral like anxiety stuff I struggled\nit with it once when I was like 19 or so\nand I kind of did some stuff myself and\nI actually had totally got over it and I\nwas I'm good and then in the past couple\nyears outside maybe your and a half or\ntwo years after streaming I definitely\nit kind of came back and taken hold and\nI I can like feel it and I kind of know\nthe duh I know what it feels like when\nit happens I had before so that's kind\nof like hearing lingering and I don't\nknow just okay I think or yeah I think\nit's we're going to be talking about\nI've never talked to anybody about it\nlike actually ever so I've no no idea or\nexpectation you know yeah that's it let\nme see if I can I had a feeling\nsomething like this might happen let me\nsee if I um so that's really cool Jake\nso you said that you struggled with\nanxiety for a little bit when you were\n19 and then it got better and then maybe\nit's it's gotten good or it's it started\nto come back a little bit since you\nstarted streaming is that fair to say uh\nyeah I guess yeah sure okay\nand can you tell me just a little bit\nabout how you decided to go to Japan\nsure I went to university in LA and then\nafter university I had an opportunity to\nstudy Chinese in China for two years\nso I went there for two years then I\ncame back to LA and actually started\nworking at a start-up for a year and\nafter a year I was like I just felt like\nI was the most alive when I was kind of\na broad and uncomfortable and learning\nsomething and I just I me decided to\nsave up some money quit my job and go to\nJapan for one year to study Japanese in\nwhich case I just started streaming when\nI went there and then that one year of\nJapanese learning turned into me\nstreaming now for you know however many\nyears and everything kind of like 118\nbased on you know 118 118 from what I\nthought you know what would happen so\nwhat did you think would happen I mean I\noriginal plan was go for years study\nJapanese come back home and just\ncontinue working with hopefully like\nit's just a more built up or improved\nversion of myself you know with another\nlanguage ability or something and just\ncontinue working you know but yeah I've\nbeen just kind of accepted can I tell\nthat can you tell me what what IRL\nstreaming or like like outdoor streaming\nor what is that and what were you\nstreaming in Japan yeah sounds like one\nI mean I was yeah it's crazy fun IRL\nstreaming is some people say in your\nlife I call it incorporating real life\nbut it's just you know streaming\noutdoors whether it be and isn't it to\nbe outdoors I'm sorry but something that\nis could be I guess like a real life\nexperience that's my idea is like\nstreaming a real life experience so for\nme I wanted to base it around like okay\nI wanted the kind of stream my life as\nit developed in Japan because I went out\nby myself I didn't have any friends and\nI wanted to kind of stream that\nexperience for everyone which I think\npeople started to like cool yeah and and\nso are you still streaming in LA yeah so\nI moved back I mean the idea was to move\nback because everything kind of changed\nmore to like traveling and exploring on\nmore of a like\na bit more planned content type of stuff\nsome ideas just to have a home base and\ntravel from here quite often actually\nbut ever still streaming I mean doing a\nlot more computer streams now but just\nfor the time being while the world kind\nof settles down I think and yeah yeah so\neverything's still this uh they are\nstill streaming yeah just formats a\nlittle bit different yeah and can you\ntell me a little bit about when you said\nthat you had anxiety when you were 19\nlike that's quite specific can you tell\nme what yeah what was going on or what\nyou mean by them sure\nI'm a yeah I've always kind of\nreferenced this on my stream I guess but\nI think I was like 18 or 19 and I had\nreally bad anxiety which I didn't know\nat the time what it was when it first\nstarted feeling how I felt um and how\ndid you what did you feel can you tell\nus that yeah so at that time it was it\nwas a very like it was it was\nit was a feeling of like constant like\nnervousness and I don't like fear but I\nwas just very very worried person at the\ntime and I mean I don't know if I want\nto talk about there I mean there I guess\nthe root of the warrior what I really\nfelt that time was I got you know I\ndidn't go outside a lot of stuff I\nwouldn't go outside to like a big public\nevents I wouldn't like I wouldn't I\nalways worry about weird things like\nlike what oh no oh gosh uh it's okay\nthat I'm irrational thoughts yeah sure I\nmean I was worried about things like if\nI went out to a public event and uh\nbecause I always have like stomach aches\nand like nervous stomach I'm like oh\nwhat if I can't find a bathroom or like\nwhere's the exit at a at a movie theater\nlike it would be weird like I would go\nto a movie theater and I'd have to know\nwhere the I could start where the\nbathroom is I guess I'd to go to the\nbathroom\nmhm it sounds really weird but it's not\nthat weird but we'll get yeah ii yeah\nsure yeah it those were like the outside\nthe surface feelings I would have about\nokay exactly that time and it was kind\nof like Oliver is like deep debility is\nthat the word debilitating\nsure so exact yeah definitely affect\nlike my normal life and what's crazy\nabout that is that growing up I was\nalways like happy-go-lucky and like when\npeople mention exactly in high school\nI'd be like like what's that like we'd\nbe talking about dude like just don't\nworry so much but like it just hit me\nlike kind of randomly and I was like\nwell at first I thought it was a\nphysical problems I went to the doctor\nand I got you're fine I was like and I\nwas like - and then I had to kind of\nfigure it out and it took a little bit\nof steps and a lot of like\nself-realization and like mindset\nchanges actually and I think I really\ngrew a lot out of that when I came out\nof that and can you tell us about steps\nwhat were the steps sure um at the time\nI kind of slowly realized after like\ndoing my little research and talking to\nmy friends like okay I think I just am\nstruggling from anxiety like this word\nand I never talked to anybody really\nabout it except for my best friend's and\nbasically after I realized what it was I\njust would look up different what swords\nSolutions but like different MEC like\ndifferent things that people would do to\nkind of get over their anxiety and I\nwould just tried the little ones like\nmeditating or just what else did you try\nor what seemed to work uh for meals kind\nof just trying to find what the root of\nit was and just like like a little weed\nthat was in there and I'd dig it out\nlike just attack it head first and\nfigure out what is their root cause and\nfigure that out and then like I have a\ntotal mindset change that actually so\nMike got me what of it what do you think\nwas the root so what I think the root\nwas at that time was I was fearing the\nfuture I was fearing things like death\nlike that not specific oh my god I'm\nframing to die tomorrow like I wasn't\nlike that but it was definitely some\nweird fear and I think those because I\nwas actually brought up like very\nreligious and for some reason after high\nschool a lot of things hearted changing\nand you know what I was doing and my\nreally finding my own path I think a lot\nof fears for like adding up of like you\nknow like after I started feeling a\nlittle bit weird I'd be like oh man what\nif I'm sick like homie I would have you\nknow what if I was into like die and I\nwas like fear these things and I think\nit honestly was because I don't know I\nthink goes I think someone had to do is\nthe religion poured of my life can you\ntell us already yeah I just brought up\nsuper Christian I guess I go into church\nall the time and I stopped going and I\nwas like 17 or 18 just because I just\ndidn't feel like it was for me and then\nso you know I hear people say this\nactually a fair amount super Christian\nit's not just Christian it's like super\nyeah super Christians like Forks super\nChristians like your mom like Mesa coach\nevery Sunday if you don't go to church\nthen you're like ground like you're in\ntrouble and like it's and you know you I\ncan't I can't play games with any blood\nin it and I can't watch The Simpsons and\nthat's super what's wrong with The\nSimpsons I don't know it probably has\nlike you know like anti-semitic or an\nTyson would submit not somatic somatic\nand just anti-christian like jokes or\nsomething anima yeah I've never heard\nanything religious on the Simpsons but\nyou know I haven't hey that's that's why\nit's super Christian is because I mean\nbaking people can find something out of\nnothing so interesting and so what was\nit like growing up in in that kind of\nhouse so it sounds like your mom was was\nquite religious what about your dad uh\nno my dad really wasn't that really just\nhe's my mom's like typically very\nconservative and super Christian not\nthat's a bad thing I mean that's just a\nmom and then my dad is just more\naggressive just more like I don't know\nif the word liberal it's not like a\npolitical word all the time is it more\nlike very like maybe Ella I guess just\nyou know purpose I think I'm open minded\nin it sounds like it may be less rigid\nand a little bit more flexible maybe\nthat's deaf definitely he's I don't\nalways talk to him whenever there's like\nanything going on in high school or some\nserious hanger you know do you have\nsiblings one Brenda and is is your\nbrother religious no he's kind of the\nsame as me I think around you know you\nalways go to church growing up in high\nschool I think he just found his own\nkind of path as well so me and my\nbrother and my dad had a very kind of\nvarious than that and then my mom is yep\nso I and your brothers will do a younger\nhold it by eight years oh wow that's a\nlittle bit older and and what was\ny'all's relationship like when you were\ngrowing up I mean it's he's quite a bit\nolder than you right so yeah it was uh\nit was pretty I think standard like you\nknow pick on me come the younger kid but\nlike as we got older we as I got to be\nlike 20 I think and out of high school\nwe definitely started getting cool more\nclothes and now we're actually very\nclose we actually live in like the same\napartment complex when I moved back and\nlike we hang out almost every day but I\nwould say it was very typical there's an\nyeah just sibling eight years older and\nyou know just the normal pick on you\nyounger kids you're younger check our\nyounger brother kind of stuff it sure\nand and so you said that you felt like\nsome of your kind of fear of a few\nor death and it's okay to like yeah how\ncan I say this it's perfectly fine to\nsay things that sound like they don't\nmake sense or are like super\npsychoanalytic and yeah I'm also\nprobably more hesitant saying it because\nlike I know people are watching so like\nI'm trying not to make that effect\nanything I'm not looking at anything but\nlike definitely eyes like a sure what my\nbrain is trained do what what effect\ndoes that have let's talk about that\nwhat effect does that have on you that\npeople are watching uh I don't know I've\nalways been someone doesn't I try not to\nreally care about people think about me\nI've always kind of been that way in my\nlife but I think over years of streaming\nit's just knowing it's not like I'm\ntrying to appeal to anybody play it's\njust maybe you do have a little bit of\nfeeling of what people are thinking like\nwhat they're saying about what you're\nsaying like and and and so it sounds\nlike it occupies it how can I say this\nso it sounds like knowing that people\nare watching even if you try to not let\nit affect you\noccupies a little bit of space in your\nmind and there's really no way of\ngetting at around that yes\nyeah out it's pretty hard I didn't I\nhaven't really I mean I would assume\nmost streamers have that little\noccupancy yeah so you know this is one\nof the advantages of being a boomer is\nthat I tend to be oblivious to most\nthings so it's easy for me to forget\nyou'll get there one day man you just\nneed you know it sounds like you're\ncrossing 30 and just give it a couple of\nyears and once once you don't recognize\nwhat kids say like once you don't\nunderstand terminology on Twitch or\ndon't understand the games that people\nare playing or this is a big one do you\nhave a younger person who helps you with\nsetup your technology no I mean see\nthat's not a boomer then see you to\nbecome a real boomer you have to have\nsomeone who helps you set up your\ntechnology which you thought I knew how\nto set up okay and so that's when you're\ngonna be a real boomer and that's when\nyou'll become impervious to the opinions\nof people on the Internet\nbut not really impervious\nno one's impervious but looking forward\nto it you'll get some damage resistance\nokay good so tell me a little bit about\nlike when you were saying you know you\nfelt like some of the your fears of\ndeath which I know sounds like so\ngrandiose but you know some of your\nfears were rooted in your religious\nupbringing can you help us understand a\nlittle bit about like how those two\nthings are tied together and even if\nit's not like a you know like a\none-to-one sure uh yeah again I don't\nthink back the full root of that you\nholding teddy was just like oh I'm\nafraid to die it's like yeah what I'm\ntrying to say but there's just so some\naspects of like all of you worried about\nlike going like just things I couldn't I\ndon't know just stupid stuff but okay as\nfar as that specific question cuz like\nyou know in church you're taught like\nokay if you don't believe in the perfect\nway to believe and believe in in this\nscenario Jesus in blah blah like you go\nto hell mm-hmm sounds like oh damn like\nif I if I was in the die I'm gonna go to\nhell like in about that was a little\ntiny fear at the time right now I mean\nthat doesn't occupy or it's definitely\nnot an issue right now but at that time\nthat was I think I was in it and like I\nwas like you know looking up on the\ninternet like conspiracy theories and\nlike just like end of the world stuff at\nthe time and those it was like so stupid\nnot looking back but that was a huge\nthat's what cost a lot of stuff a lot of\nmy problems I think was I like this\nconstant bombarding of worrying about\nwhat's going to be in the future in sure\nyeah so so yeah what are you worried\nabout particular aspects of the future\nsounds like yeah I mean a definite\nafterlife is one of them but like were\nthere particular things like sometimes\npeople worry about being alone or they\nworry about you know not being respected\nor able to support themselves or living\nup to their potential I honestly I think\nI was just fearful of like I think the\nroot of it was the death thing and that\neffort like after I'd be more and more\nlike if your fraud always just continue\nlooking up things about like how bad the\nworld like what's happening to the world\nright now in ohm mine like into they say\nhonestly into the world stuff like it\nwas kind of weird like 2012 weird like\njust stuff that I it's I don't know I\nkind of giggle at it now what yeah does\nit sound kind of embarrassing to say\nthat stuff it definitely it's definitely\nembarrassing but I don't know I think a\nlot of people kind of did that I was an\nInternet person I was always on there\nand being you know in putting so much\nand trying to zip through it and yeah\nyeah so Jake let me offer if it's okay I\nwant to offer like one or two thoughts\nabout your feeling of embarrassment\nis that cool yep which is the first\nthing is that like everyone feels like\ntheir anxiety doesn't make sense\neveryone like but it's not you know\nanxiety is not designed to sort of make\nsense it's not it's just not how it\nworks like our mind is a thinking\nmachine and sometimes it generates\nthoughts that don't make sense and\nthat's actually perfectly okay like like\nvoicing thoughts that feel irrational to\nyou doesn't make you a stupid person\nit's just your mind just comes up with\nthat [ __ ] yeah\nand and when you look up stuff how did\nit affect your anxiety I mean it was\njust add to it like I think about more\nthings like pile on more [ __ ] yeah so so\nthen let's think about that for a second\nso what you know what what did you gain\nand I and I want to acknowledge that you\ndid get something right so let me maybe\nput it another way\nhow are you satisfied by looking up\nsomething on the internet because it\nsounds like it fueled your anxiety but\nwhat did you like you know because I'm\nguessing getting a sense that you were\nhungry for something you would do a\nGoogle search and then you would read\nsomething and then you'd feel satisfied\neven though your anxiety would increase\ndoes that make sense yeah yeah there's\nlike\nI might have been getting a feeling of\nsatisfaction by by thinking that I was\nlike obtaining some knowledge that I\nwish everyone else knew like you guys\nneed to know this like come on like this\nis happening like yeah that's probably\ncuz I'd like to talk to my friends about\nit Meg I wasn't like I don't know yeah\nI'm gonna give you that at that from if\nI think about it I'd be my answer I\nthink that would make sense like okay\nyou've been thinking back I think that's\na feeling that I would get sure so so so\nyou were learning something that other\npeople didn't know did you feel like\ndoing research helped you prepare I mean\nI didn't really prepare cuz nothing\nhappened but I feel yeah yeah sure right\nso like there's an unknown there's a\nproblem out there that like maybe the\nworld could end and like what are you\ngonna do about because your anxieties\nlike what are you gonna do about that\nyeah\ndoes that question make sense it's like\nwe got to do something right so like\nanxiety drives you to do something great\nso let mean you have to plan you have to\nknow where the exits are you have to\nknow where the bathrooms are you have to\nknow when the world is gonna end\nyeah yeah I mean it's almost like a sigh\nthis is a cycle like it's fueling itself\nI guess yeah is that how it felt to you\nI mean until I stopped doing that yeah\nso how did you okay so you said\nsomething about a change in mindset so\nwhat what changed for you how are you\nable to stop indulging sure I've always\nthought that I'm like a pretty like like\nstrong-willed person and what when I\nwhen I like realized okay like Jake\nyou're doing something wrong you need to\nrealize what's going on here\nI actually just really thought about the\nroute like the deepest route of what\ncould cause this and for me the deepest\nroute was like I was like if you go down\nthe trail it's like okay if the world\nended what's the worst that can happen\nyou're gonna die and then I took that\nout as like that's the deep history of\nwhat's causing this\nso I just literally like thought to\nmyself this is like it sounds so stupid\nin like it's some don'ts gotta just\nspeak okay sorry sorry\nI do evil I do have a lot of what's that\nhumor called me just appreciate about\nyourself\nself-deprecating yeah it's like anyway\nso it's good in bed but anyway okay so I\nI just created a mindset and I pulled\nmyself like this and I told myself this\nover and over again at this time was all\nright well don't worry about all this\nother [ __ ] and basically creative\nmindset where if you were to die\ntomorrow you want to be happy for the\nlife that you live today and everything\nbefore so with that mindset it like\nactually like completely it's not like\none idea welcome to next day a thank you\nMatt and was fine but they had\ncompletely changed everything okay after\nI created that mindset for myself I\nstarted like every day working on myself\nlike physically like not crazy Jim Chad\nbut like I would I would like you know\nmake conscious decisions to wick a\nlittle earlier go on a little jog start\nworking out I would start eating\nhealthier I would like basically use all\nof my time that I had to be very\nproductive and with the mindset that if\nI was at that tomorrow I'd be happy for\neverything I did and that's what\nactually caused me to go to like China\nand stuff like that was like I just\nthought I would basically try to take\nrisks and make decisions that would make\nme like proud of the life that I was\nliving and it sounds great man that was\nlike actually yeah I was in honesty I\nwas in like bliss like after I came out\nof it I gave you I was 20 and I came out\nof like a longer they ship to but that\nthe relationship was not a she like\nactually like a big thing in my head at\nthe time but anyway after that I came\nafter relation if you go you weren't\nworking out but after that I was in like\nbliss I was in probably the happiest\ntime yeah there's a very just I don't\nknow very positive and fury yeah time\nyeah so let me ask you something like\nthat what do you what do you think would\nhave happened Jake if you never got that\nanxiety at the age of 19 what do you\nthink you'd be right now honestly I\nmight have just gone normal route and\nlike just went to college so I working a\nmarketing firm and not really done what\nI did\nyeah I mean yeah so think about that no\nyeah totally when I I've always looked\nback at that and been like and and it's\nmade me realize a lot of things like\nwhen there are you know you have to have\ndowns to know the ups you have to kind\nof see a little darkness to appreciate\nthe light and like things like that\nalways thought but yeah I mean well I\nmean that's that sounds like a little\nbit of an understatement to me to be\nhonest it sounds like a generalization\nlike you there have to be downs to be\nups sounds like a safe and logical thing\nto say but what I'm hearing from you is\nthat you know your anxiety altered the\ncourse of your life in a drastic way you\nknow is that what do you think is up\nwith that like do you think that that's\nhow do you understand that or do you not\nreally think about it much or um well no\nI uh\nmaybe I don't think about it now it's\nkinda just become normal for me but I\ncan definitely say that it made me learn\na lot about myself at that time because\nI was someone who's like oh I can never\nget anxiety I always thought like what\nis this I can I'm fine I'm happy I'm a\nhat like hmm but but I got it like I\ndidn't know what it was and it was kind\nof scary and then they made me realize a\nlot about myself and kind of how I\nwanted to live after you know like yep\nyeah hmm and so you went to China\nsounds like you use the word bliss yeah\nyeah I don't know if that's the right\nword but uh sure this yeah\njust speak your truth man it doesn't\nhave to be right yeah okay and and then\nyou went to Japan and and when did the\nanxiety start to creep in yes\nso I mean started maybe I would say\nlet's just say a year and a half ago or\nmore like around a year and a half ago\nyeah I would say I specifically remember\nlike the first day I like I remember\nactually the first day I felt the\nfeeling of anxiety and like right away I\nwas like holy [ __ ] cuz like there's some\ntimes in life like in kissing sure I do\nwant to say though that there are some\ntimes in life or\nthroughout this blissful time that it\nwas like I'd catch myself back oh my god\nyou're a little nervous Jake breathe\nlike I would catch myself out breathe\nout relax and like I'd be fine\nbut anyways about let's say two years\nago or a year and a half ago in Japan I\nhad the feeling of like [ __ ] Jake yellow\nanxiety or now calm down and it didn't\nreally go away like it usually does it\nwas actually on New Year's Day of 2019\nYear's Day 2019 okay do you remember I\njust came back from seeing my family in\nLA and I did a crazy New Year's Eve\nstream in Japan like they're like the\ncraziest streams like just out partying\nall night and just having a really\ninsane stream and then I was supposed to\nstream the next day on New Year's Day\nand I just I was like mentally just not\nfeeling like I was like dude like I just\ndon't want to go outside or now I just I\nwas kind of like first time you know in\never since being in Japan or being\nstreaming that I felt that way and I\nremember talking about all my discord a\nlittle bit with Mike my viewers and\nstuff and uh it was weird because I was\nlike it's a big day\nfirst you know but yeah I mean that's\nthe first day that I had it and it\nslowly would be more and more and then\nit's been kind of since that last\nyear-and-a-half been kind of just up and\ndown I can feel the exact same symptoms\nI had before you know a little mental\nand physical stuff that's being\neffectively yeah that's it that's about\na year and half ago I guess yeah so and\nwhat are you when you're what are the\nwhat kind of thoughts do you have good\nbreathing by the way oh thanks I did a\nlittle yoga this morning good for you\nthat's a very that's a very open-ended\nquestion and I know it's supposed to be\nlike that so I'm trying not to think too\nmuch about it before I answer I\ntimer right now at that time um at that\ntime I just thought like alright you're\njust going through a little like maybe a\ncouple days they're just feeling a\nlittle nervous anxiety maybe a little\nbit too much going on maybe just need to\nrelax and chill if you don't you know\ndon't drink so much because and when I\nwent to Japan socially you do drink a\nlot when you meet people and I was like\nthe majority of my stream is going out\nand exploring and meeting meeting people\nand you know they just don't drink and\nchill and you'll be fine I wasn't yeah\nis your anxiety continued to grow do you\nremember what kind of thoughts you had\nlike let's say like end of 2019 or like\nfall of 2019 would what we were so in\nthe past it was you know your anxiety\nused to tell you you have to find the\nexits maybe who had some fear of death\nyeah what kind of thoughts do you have\nnow now my thoughts and I don't think\nthese thoughts are triggers for the\nanxiety I think that they are a cycle of\nadding to what I have but now I'm sure\nwhat thinking damn Jake you have these\nsame symptoms like I feel very like\nfuzzy thoughts like I'm just I feel very\nlike my mental is not as sharp and when\nI first started mentioning as mushrooms\nlike are you just getting old like it's\nso normal and maybe maybe that is part\nof it and maybe I'm just overthinking\nthat I'm just becoming a little more\nslow but it's like recognized\nit's like recognizable to me um my\nvision is like become super blurry in\nthe past year and a half like like it's\ninsane I was always like 20/20 and then\nlike I don't know it's just there's like\nphysical things okay any chance you've\nseen an optometrist recently I went\nweeks ago yeah here actually and\ngoodrich gave me clip glasses that are\ncoming soon but you know it was nice I\nmean it's a relief it's a relief to go\nand like just to rule out that there's\nany physical problem it's very nice but\num what I know to be honest I'm I'm Oh\nam I afraid of shoot okay well my first\nanswer is I'm afraid that there is\nsomething like a little physical problem\nlike with me that I don't know that sure\nwhich is actually really bad because\nthat leads back to my you know good time\nwithout always fear what's the you know\nfear okay and what would it mean if you\nhad a physical problem that you'd be I\nmean that would be I don't know what\nthat mean yeah I mean I don't underst\nquestion what's the significance if you\ndid have a physical problem let's assume\nit was true then I guess that would just\nI don't know I mean it would suck or\nwould talk about it that it could\nanswer that okay that's okay um do you\nfeel okay not knowing how to answer some\nquestions it's not like there's a right\nanswer it's just you know sometimes I\ncan ask a bad question frequently are\nyou okay well I don't know I know it's\nfinally I ask away I just don't know\nlike how to answer oh it's like about I\nmean I guess I just not gonna fall back\nto what I was already talking about what\nI've got over is like okay what's the\nfirst could happen like okay you're\nsaying you could just die so he's\nthinking yeah so so okay let's point out\nwhat just happened Jake okay so you're\ndoing good buddy\nstay with me okay nice pink train uh-huh\nbig bad I knew whose Binx who's doing\nthis for not being spanked no not that\nwell don't speak but you know I smell\nlike um you know I I understand I think\nit's fair for you to feel like you're\nbeing spanked but who's doing the\nspanking that makes sense you know right\nnow I'm kind of spanking myself because\nI'm yet realizing that there that this\nisn't a majority I really don't think\nthis is a dirty of what started the\ncause of this right now but it\ndefinitely has become now a part of what\nyeah well mines ideas right now it\nDerick Andreea and yeah let me let me\nunderstand so I think you were I think\nyou had answers for my questions I just\ndon't think you liked them or weren't\ncomfortable saying them because you gave\nus a little clue there so I think what\nthe silence was was actually like\nconflict within you is that fair or were\nyou just drawing a blank\nno it's not I mean I had like answers\ninside me I just like thinking is that\nyou don't want to say them yeah yeah so\nso thanks for giving us a glimpse cuz I\nthink that that's enough to get us\nstarted and and you know it's okay to\nnot give us a glimpse but I'll tell you\na little bit more about glimpses in a\nsecond so the first thing is that what I\nkind of heard from you is like let me\nknow if this is right okay so you didn't\nprecisely say this but it's kind of like\nwell if I do have something wrong with\nme then like maybe I could die but oh\n[ __ ] like we already dealt with that\nthat was like back when we were 19 so\nlike I don't want it to be that again\nlike I thought that that was taken care\nof yeah\nwhat do you think about that that fair\nyeah no that's that that's totally fair\nthat's why I was kind of like weird\nanswering that way but I but these are\njust these are thoughts I've had after\nthe after what I feel like was my like\nwhen I started getting anxiety again\nwhich I really at the time I'm just like\nI thought it was there was no thoughts\nof that in my head at that like when it\nfirst year first day and and that's so\nlike the anxiety has definitely kind of\nnuts nope snow balled maybe into like\nadding on extra little things now which\nis like [ __ ] not to start like pruning\nmore [ __ ] off before I can get to that\nroot again and ah yeah yeah so so here's\nhere's what I'm hearing from you is that\nyou don't want to say that answer\nbecause temporarily your anxiety it's\nsure it's become maybe a fear of death\nagain but that happened later after the\nsnowball started forming so that's not\nyou're telling yourself that that's not\nthe right answer because you started\nexperiencing anxiety before you started\nthinking about death maybe yeah so\nyou're kind of discounting that even\nthough that's the answer that pops into\nyour head yeah yeah have you started\nfeeling old recently uh no I think okay\nyeah I don't think that's ever been like\na thought yep I mean you know this chat\nsays you're boomer and it's laugh at it\nlike yeah I'm joke haha I'm going bald\nbut like I don't what about your mental\nnot being as sharp how long have you\nbeen feeling that way um honestly just\nlike says the exact since I started\nfeeling anxiety which which was this was\nlike the key thing of when I was like 19\nor so I was the same I was very foggy\nlike I remember like I remember like\nspecifically when I was young like when\nanxiety I remember like when I turn my\nhead and I try to look I couldn't focus\non things like right away I was like a\nphysical thing that caught that would\nthat was like one physical thing that I\nhad to Aniyah anxiety\nmm-hm and I noticed that right away\nyou're gonna have to go I was like holy\ncrap like I'm getting anxiety again like\nI realized I was like [ __ ]\nyou gotta figure this out okay yeah\nthat's it one thing I think yeah Jake\nI'm gonna offer a couple of thoughts\nokay the first is that I get the sense\nthat you're trying to give us a the\nright answer so I don't want the right\nanswer there isn't the right answer\nI just want whatever's in your head is\nirrational and as stupid as it is\nbecause I don't think it's irrational or\nstupid and even if you feel it's\nirrational or stupid like I'm even happy\nwith you sharing with me what your\nstruggle to speak is so even if you\ncan't give me an answer if you can share\nwith me why you can't give me an answer\nthat would be awesome okay so what we\nwant is a window into your mind because\nlike basically we're gonna look under\nthe hood of the car\nyeah please and and and so like for\nexample this whole process of like you\nkind of saying I don't know how to\nanswer that I think you had answers but\nsomething kept you from sharing those\nanswers because you were judging what\nyour answers were there was judgment\nthere that kept you from speaking does\nthat make sense yeah yeah EE I mean yeah\nyeah I'm gonna overthink way too much\nright so so even there so like like what\nwas that was that bad that no what was\nthat how do we describe that I overthink\nway too much if I admitting something am\ni real it was it a UH it's a judgment oh\nokay right so this kind of also goes\nback to self deprecating like it's true\nyeah I'm very very self-deprecating and\nI don't I hope that hasn't affected me\nlike made it worse yeah so I think that\nthere's a certain amount of humor to\nthat which is completely fine but do you\njudge yourself frequently\ndo you mean like just like I just did\nwhen I said yeah I mean yeah yeah oh\nyeah I guess all the time yeah so I\nusually do it very light-hearted they\nusually say typically it's very\nlight-hearted sure I I'm with that cuz I\ndon't think you you strike me so some\npeople like weigh themselves down with\nheavy judgement you're in you know these\nare people who like tell themselves that\nthey're ugly or pieces of [ __ ] or things\nlike that you strike me as someone who's\nquite confident and and has generally\nspeaking like a positive outlook so I\ndon't think you judge yourself in the\nsame way is like the heavy judgments\nokay yeah yeah that's fair but I still\nthink that you have a very a relatively\ncommon subtle judgement going on that\nbecause you're a relatively resilient\nguy you can use humor as a defense\nmechanism and kind of like laugh it off\nbut you still judge yourself in ways\nthat you can handle but you're still\ndoing it does that make sense yes it\ndoes make sense and you've been doing\nthat your whole life for I actually\nprobably I guess yeah I mean I've always\nbeen like the class clown that developed\ninto probably that kind of weird using\njokes or something to always have a\nfallback there it is that rears it like\na bad no no it's just it makes me want\nto ask a fall but like a like a fallback\nfrom what like what are you falling back\nfrom oh I don't know like that's not I\ncould I'm just I don't know like I would\njust say things mmm oh man I don't know\nwhat do you feeling I'm trying\nwhat I fall back from I don't know if\nthere's anything specific yeah yeah I\nknow what are you feeling right now\nOh is you think about what to fall back\nfrom like something happened like you\nstarted smiling a lot but I don't think\nit was I think it was like a deflecting\nsmile that's it a very I smile a lot and\na lot a lot is deflecting and I see it\nmade fun of her smiling actually sorry\nrandom mm-hm\nso so what happened if you didn't make a\njoke what do you think would have\nhappened when you were for lack of a\nbetter term and I realize I'm asking you\nreally a broad question when you were\nyeah is there some weird-ass random\nthought that pops into your head if I\nask a broad question yeah what would\nhappen if you didn't make a joke growing\nup what were you afraid of I don't know\nmaybe I just liked people laugh like I\njust liked I mean I like to I like to\nreactions definitely that's maybe that's\nokay reactions and that's definitely\nyeah that's been a good and bad thing in\nmy life I think I like reactions okay\nthat's maybe a yeah maybe I fished too\nmuch for reactions do you yeah\ndefinitely I mean yeah yep why not like\nwhat do reactions do for you they tell\nme about people what do they tell you\nabout people hmm this is good weird\nokay sorry I thought we\nlike I gotta watch how I say things no\nno no it is it no Jake that's a great\nthing to say man cuz it's I was about to\nsay that's what we [ __ ] do here man\nokay it gets weird that means we're\ndoing it right like if I said something\nlike kind of weird or obscure and then I\nuse a joke like a laugh or a joke as a\nfallback after I say the weird and\nobscure thing you can see how someone\nreacts and then like kind of get a\nfeeling of like what they think about\nthat and if it's a bad feeling they get\nthen you can fall back on the laughs and\nit's like a knot it's like normal then\nyou can like wow it's okay yeah so let's\nthink about that it was there a\nparticular that feeling of saying\nsomething weird in getting that reaction\ndo you remember a time in your life\nwhere like you said something and you\ngot that reaction really really\npowerfully and you were like nope never\ngonna do that again\nspecific I can think okay I can't think\nI can think about that I'm you've been\ndoing in in this Paul with you I'm\ndefinitely the unpacking yeah I'm like\nsaying I'm saying that's weird I'm\nactually kind of curious like I'm not\nlike weirdly curious but in back when\nI'm like kind of curious like this you\nthink that's weird like yep and Molly\nand that's that's so can I put words to\nthat yes yes yeah how you doing Jake\nthat's not honestly I'm a little nervous\nI have no expectations Billy I've never\ntalked to anybody like that's you know\nthat knows you know how are these has\nsome professional background into things\nso this is kind of cool for me okay so\nwhat I'm hearing is a fear of judgment\nright\nyou're gauging how we're gonna judge you\nand and and if we don't judge you in the\nright way then you've got to fall back\nright and then you can alter our\njudgment by making a joke correct and\nthen and then so we're gonna we're gonna\ntry okay we're gonna play a little game\nso say something to me anything [ __ ] I\ngot to do this problem I'm gonna try to\nkeep a face okay so what I'm gonna do so\nyou're gonna say something I'm gonna do\nmy best to be neutral or negative okay\nand then I want you to notice how you\nfeel and then see yourself want to crack\na joke okay okay but I got out okay okay\nwow you're in Patagonia I think only a\nbunch of Chad's were Patagonia now\ngood on you you feel it just wait what\ndo you do are you trying to like no why\ndon't you what when I didn't say\nanything what did you do like what how\ndid you feel did it work I'm not I can't\ntell not then I was scared that you\nthought I was serious and that you that\nyou're actually upset that I don't like\nyour Patagonia Jackie which I like and\nthen and then what do you do I just\njoked about it I said Nadia is cool so\nwhen you thought I was serious for a\nsecond like did you get that feeling I\nmean I was also trying to roleplay like\nyou break too broke it down but yeah I\ndid a little bit yeah right and if it\nwas a real-life scenario definitely have\nthat yep\nright so that's so like and then and\nthen like what is that feeling what does\nit feel like feels like pressure of\nworrying about like damn they might not\nlike me because they thought I was or\nbecause of what I said sounded stupid or\nmean or something\nyeah or dumb is it okay to not be liked\nyeah that's fine\nI mean easy to say but yeah I mean it is\nokay to not be liked do you believe that\num maybe maybe not\nI Wow\nit's a good question dr. kay I think\nthat I don't worry about if people like\nme but I don't like when people is this\nreally weird no stop it's not weird\nI don't care good you're like I'm not\ntrying to be everyone's best friend\nmaybe but I do care about if people\ndislike me mm-hmm\nbecause I always feel like I don't I'm\nnot I I I feel like keep going buddy\nI figure there's a way to not that\nthere's a way where you don't need to\ndislike someone whether it's just\nknowing them more or figuring out what a\nproblem was or something I don't know\nso let me ask you a different question\nis it okay for you to be disciplined\nyeah yes you sure yes yeah I don't know\nmaybe yeah maybe I'm just being weird\nnow no I'm not should I stop saying that\nthat's a bad hat by the way you can even\nask my like viewers here I'm a lot like\nI always say I'm so like I say I'm weird\na lot and that's really bad probably\nokay anyways uh even you're judging the\nweirdness and you're calling it bad you\nknow it's gonna it's recursive it'll go\nback until the end of time which is okay\njust notice it it's just how you are\nit's not good or bad it's just how you\nare there are good things about it\nthey're bad things about it we can talk\nabout that in a second but let's stick\nwith this are you are you okay being\ndisliked\nyeah I I think yeah even looking what I\njust said son oh yeah I'll say like just\nthe simple answer is yes yeah definitely\nokay being disliked yeah okay so I know\nthat this is gonna sound weird but that\nmakes perfect I think both statements\nare true so I think that like so we tend\nto think about our mind is like a\nmonolith it's like one thing whereas\nreally what we are is like our mind is\nactually like it's like a party of NPCs\nwho each do kind of whatever they want\nto and our goal is to sort of get the\nNPC's to move in the same direction and\nwe want to like Zone into this raid and\nlike do the raid and sometimes they will\nto work after something huh does you\nknow I play World of Warcraft wrestling\nI sorry I heard you make these things\nlike okay they're good I mean I just use\ngaming analogies and like most of it\ntends to be MOBAs in RPGs because that's\nwhat I play by oh yeah all right keep it\ngoing yeah so like it's like you know\nyou're you're with this group of people\nand like so I think that it's it's weird\nJake because there's a part of you who I\nthink is genuinely confident mature and\nresilient and then there are also like\nnights at your round table that are\nconcerned about dislike are concerned\nabout getting old and are concerned\nabout dying mm-hmm right in that Spectre\nwhich you judge yourself or you judge\nyourself for like oh [ __ ] I thought we\ndealt with that it's like it's like\nzombie it's like you killed it once and\nit's back again yeah and so you've got\nto be careful because I think like\nyou're doing a very subtle thing where\nyou're even though that's the answer\nthat pops up in your mind your\nreluctance for that answer to be true\nallows you to ignore it can you say that\nwas less yes more time so like like even\nthough something pops up in your mind\nmm-hmm your reluctance for it to be true\npushes you to just ignore it feel like I\ndon't want it to be true I don't want to\nbe afraid of death again\nyeah whereas I would be surprised are\nyou still living every day and every day\nI don't mean most days I mean\nare there days where you live where\nyou're no longer thinking about if I die\ntomorrow would I be happy are you\nstarting to think about the future um\nyeah I don't live like that every day\nanymore\ndefinitely yep and is there a\ncorrelation between not living that way\nin the resurgence of your anxiety yeah I\nmean I was I think so but yeah yeah I\nalso I also want to like just say that\nsomething that I think has been a key\nthat I've just realized in the timing of\nall this is I think streaming has\nchanged a lot of how I live it's\nactually changed out of it completely\ntell us about mom well when I first went\nto Japan I went there to live for a year\nand come back right and I just started\ndistri I happened to stream it was like\na I did it everyday but it wasn't I\nwasn't there to stream I just had the\nstream following me and after you know\nsix or eight months of like damn this\nstream has blown up and I need to really\nfocus on this it turned into you just\nthis is like realization I've thought of\nthat I think is a lot but it's turned it\nturned into me living my life in the\nstream seeing what my life was to me\nliving the stream and my life was just\nfollowing mm-hmm and I think that is for\nme the biggest trigger for this anxiety\nrecently and I might be wrong but I\nreally do think I know myself and I know\nthe changes I like what changes in my\nlife and this was the craziest change\nI've ever had and I'm not\nI mean I'll just voice I'm always\nworried about saying that because I'm a\nlittle worried about the judgement from\nthe viewers who are like oh did you just\nstream like you just make a bunch of\nmoney and all you do is go around and\nget drunk with like I understand that\nargument but I always I'll just say that\nit's definitely somehow he's why don't\ntalk about it a lot but it still was um\ndefinitely a big change in my life and\nonce I I realized that more so recently\nof you know it change from the stream\nfall in my life to my life just being\nthe stream and my life kind of just\ntrailing behind me yeah and uh you know\nI try to take slow steps and to try and\nbalance that back out to kind of live my\nlife again and that's like LA was one\nmove all the timing kind of sucks with\neverything going on you know being\naround and trying to start my little\nhealthy habits a little again um but\nyeah a lot of my middle space is most of\nmy mental space in the past couple years\nis just purely dedicated to you stream\nlike everything around being online and\neverything which it was always like that\nso yeah so I think that makes a lot of\nsense Jake so can I have a moment to\ncollect my thoughts\nyeah please are you playing an ad right\nnow no okay sorry I didn't know if I was\nlike an ad thing or something I don't\nknow\nI mean sometimes people run ads and I\njust um but I'm not I'm working with pen\nand paper bro like everything anybody's\nokay I'm gonna need a minute\n[Music]\nall right either this is gonna either\nI'm going to lose you guys completely\norder this is going to be helpful almost\nthere\nokay\nboy it's gonna be hard to find the words\nto say this okay so I'm just gonna start\ntalking oh okay I'm sorry you're scared\nright now but I'm ready no no it's a\nmean the reason I'm you know I\nunderstand you're afraid but what I'm\nsaying is like it's just like I'm trying\nto I feel like I've wrapped my head\naround something but I don't know how to\nexplain what I've wrapped my head around\nsounds like me everyday I'm ready so the\nfirst thing that we're gonna kind of\nstart in the present right so there's\nthere is Jake and bake and then there is\nJake and these are two different people\nand it used to be that Jake was the one\nwho is living life and Jake and bake was\nfollowing along and now it started to\nhappen is like you started to become\nmore Jake and bake in less Jake and\novertime you know so there's like the\ncharacter and there's you and and I\nthink you described it really well that\nlike you used to just live your life and\nthat was like Jake was the guy who woke\nup and said I want to be able to die\ntomorrow with no regrets\nthat was never Jake and bake in fact the\nanxiety was the idea of you dying a\nthousand days in the future and like\nregretting that thousand days which is\ndifferent about there's a difference\nbetween like dying tomorrow and living a\nlife that isn't good enough because\nyou're gonna go to hell\nit's like a summation of your entire\nlife it becomes greater than today\nmm-hmm okay so Jake and bake I think\nthen starts to like the more you eat the\nmore the steam grows then you're like oh\nthis is a thing which is like but\nremember that Jake grew out of a\ncompletely different thought process\nthan like this is a real thing now he\ndidn't care if it was a real thing he\njust did today and once the stream\nbecomes real then you end up with New\nYear's night where it's huge and it's\ngreat and the next day Jake didn't want\nto go out and stream and Jake and bake\nsaid you got a stream bro because it's a\nreal thing and so like on that day Jake\nand bake took over\nand he said like hey man like it's not\nabout you anymore it's about me and and\nso this right so and it was hard because\nwhen Jacob Baek takes over like Jake's\nnot ready for it and then you kind of\nstay at home and and whatnot so fun so\nnow like we get into it another problem\nwhich is that once Jake and Baek takes\nover there's a particular vulnerability\nthat you have which is that you've\nalways been someone who is watching the\nreactions of other people mm-hmm and so\nif you have a mind that watches the\nreactions of other people and can be\nself-deprecating and can cause them to\nsmile that is like that is just lighter\nfuel for Jake and Baek right because\nlike you take a guy who's very tuned in\nto like not wanting to be disliked and\nnow we see the struggle because like at\ntimes Jake and Baek speaks and Jake and\nBaek says yeah I really don't want to be\ndisliked it's not okay for me to be\ndisliked it makes me deeply\nuncomfortable when I look at someone and\nI can't make this file but the funny\nthing is that Jake is there too and Jake\nis like I embrace discomfort and I\nchallenged myself and I took the road\nless traveled and I survived and I can\nbe confident in Who I am and there\nreally are people that have disliked me\nin the past and I can be completely fine\nwith that mm-hmm but Jake and Baek there\nis also there and he's kind of like\nlooking at the judgments of oh he's like\nwatching the faces of other people like\nyou see that like you're confident you\nbut then Jake and Baek is in the back\nand he's like watching the faces of\nother people in psycho [ __ ] that guy\ndoesn't like me better attack a joke\nhmm so that's how you are and then like\nJake and Baek sort of [ __ ] feeds on\nthat is its fertile soil mm-hmm and then\nit starts to get worse right so like the\nJake and Baek sort of takes over on\nJanuary 1st 2019 and he takes over for\njust one day and then in on a given day\nit's like Jake is piloting or Jake in\nVegas piloting and depending on who's\npiloting you feel anxiety or you don't\nfeel anxiety and then what happens is\nthis is just the way that your brain\nworks you doing okay good so then what\nhappens is like your anxiety programming\nturns on because\nthat's just how our mind works it's like\nwhen you see you know when you see a\ntoilet you have a certain automatic\nprogramming that kicks in based on the\nstimulus your mind is like your brain is\nlike okay we're in this situation again\nlet's turn on all the switches that\napply to this situation okay and once\nanxiety starts it's like oh [ __ ] we know\nthis we've done this before\nfear of death here we go right and then\nit arises and then your fear of death\nlike sort of starts to come back and\nit's like what the [ __ ] I dealt with\nthis and it's it's like yeah you dealt\nwith it but your brain is like oh this\napplies that's how it works so our brain\nscans our environment looks into the\npast and says what have we learned about\nthis situation let's access it again and\nI know it sounds really simple but like\nthat's the way that you know how to\nfunction like you can't you know when\nyou get a toothbrush your brain doesn't\nsay like what is this strange device you\ndon't treat it as brand-new your brain\nrecalls what have I done with this thing\nbefore what is everything that I know\nabout a toothbrush and let's like turn\non that circuitry again and then you\nbrush your teeth and you don't pay\nattention so it's almost like your brain\nis reactivating your anxiety right and\nthen you got like okay and then like\nmaybe there's some stuff in here I mean\nmaybe if you want to say a therapist you\ncan talk about it's kind of [ __ ] but you\nknow maybe there's some fear that you\nare getting older and that like that's\nsort of giving you like if you know if\nwe want to get super like if you want to\ntalk if it's like the Sigmund Freud sin\npeople say is that your your decrease in\nvision is giving you a sense of your own\nmortality and you are facing mortality\nonce again and the fear of death is\nreturning right so you can say all that\n[ __ ] I don't know if it's true or not\nyeah and then and then the other thing\nis that once the anxiety starts then you\nstart becoming future-oriented again\nright then it then it comes back to like\nwhat if something's wrong what if\nsomething is a little bit wrong with me\nhmm\nand then I ask you well what's the\nproblem with that you say like well like\nthe problem with that is that if\nsomething will live it is wrong with me\nlike let's be honest Jake you didn't say\nit but we all know it is that that\nlittle something could be something\nbigger down the road that's the fear\nright is that it could be cancer like\nmaybe you've got a brain tumor like\nthat's what you're afraid of in the\ncompletely irrational way and if you go\nsearch on WebMD it gets worse yeah it's\nexactly what I thought\nby the way I do want to like to say it\nmaybe I might have said fear death I\nthink the overall thing was I had really\nbeen hypochondria which led to the fear\nof death yeah same same thing same yeah\nsame conclusion yeah that's when you\nthink you have cancer that's type of\ncommunity right yeah so good right so\nlike that's what you've been thinking\nand then if we think about it like once\nyou start thinking that this comes to\nthe crux of it and this is how I think\nyou conquered your anxiety yep\nanxiety is concerned about what point in\ntime like when is anxiety concerned like\nwhat is it worried about the past the\npresent of the future future and when\nyou start living your life in a way that\nyou can die tomorrow when are you\nconcerned\nwhat do you concil it absolutely yeah\nyeah it's that simple yeah right so when\nyou start living in the today like\nliterally as we talked about earlier\nthat there are some things that satisfy\nyour anxiety and feed it right it's just\nlike hunger like what happens when I\nlike if I take a three-year-old and the\nthree-year-old is hungry and I give it\nfood does the three-year-old feel\nsatisfied it's not sure questioner I\nthink yes yes and then what happens to\nthe three-year-old that I feed what does\nit become full absolutely and then over\ntime they grow right because if you feed\nsomething yeah it grows and then what\nhappens to the three-year-olds hunger a\nyear later it gets more eats a little\nmore absolutely right so like then what\nhappens is the more that you start\nliving in the future if you search WebMD\nor if you do other things like if you\nlet yourself look at the reactions of\nothers in cave to the reactions of\nothers then what happens is all you're\ndoing is like feeding that thing which\nthen grows and grows and grows and then\nyou did something really really amazing\nwhich is that like you stopped feeding\nit right because you felt those\nanxieties when you woke up every day and\nyou shifted your mindset you can't\nconvince me that you didn't feel that\nanxiety you just turned away from it you\ndidn't satisfy it and it probably felt\nvery very discomforting\nas you turned away from it and you were\nlike okay I'm gonna start to live in the\npresent yeah and then you started to\nfeel bliss and you're like wow that\nsounds super grandiose no Ben but that's\nhow it works like that's what Yogi's in\nsaying for thousands of years is that\nfocusing on the present and freeing\nyourself from the attachment of the\nfuture yeah and because that's what\nyou're doing right you're saying like I\ncould die tomorrow you are letting go of\nanything that could happen in the future\nit could all be for naught but you're\ngonna do today the way that you want to\ndo today and that leads to bliss that's\nthe right word actually it's not a\ngrandiose term yeah that's exactly how I\nfelt and then what happens is as you\nstart living in the future who lives in\nthe future Jake or Jake and baked\nprobably Jake and Pigman here's the\nreigns right now absolutely right and so\nthen like the more that you live in the\nfuture the more it becomes Jake and bake\nthe more it becomes is my stream going\nuphill or is it going downhill do people\nlike it or do people not like it then\nyou start to think these thoughts and\nthen the opinions of others and all that\n[ __ ] starts to roll in and then your\nbrain is like oh [ __ ] this is anxiety\nlike let's start being afraid of death\nagain let's oh we're thinking about the\nfuture let's throw in a little bit of\nhypochondria because that's what we do\nwhen we think about the future and you\nmove further and further and further\naway from Jake yep yes I mean damn\nthat's cool that's very uh yeah I still\ngoing I'm listening it's good this is\nvery OnPoint right now yeah I think\nthat's like kind of the end of the cycle\nright so yeah I mean yeah that's it's\nit's it's cool to see how you kind of\nmapped it all out this is something that\nthe way you mapped it out I mean it's\nreally well put into words I've kind of\nhad the feeling of like this exact\nexactly we just said of like I'm just\nnot even like so I live with my\ngirlfriend now and my best friend since\nI was like nine years old like he's like\nmy brother like we talked through the\nyear like he helped me out when I'm out\nstruggling at that time in 19 I helped\nout through some stuff and hid like\nwe've been very back and forth I'm like\nempowering each other but um even my\ntalking to him I think the biggest thing\nI realize is like I've just lost my say\nI'm lost in the sauce like I want to\njoke around with him like I'm kind of\nlost in the sauce like I'm just I am\nI've just become a little bit away from\nwho I really am because we're streaming\nso I've been trying to take these like I\nsay these little steps to get back but I\nreally think and that maybe this is\nwhere the problem is like I can't seem\nto like 100% come in I really think it's\nhard to do while maintaining a live\nstream like I don't want it goat so I\ndon't know how deep we can go in a live\nstreaming but like it's just it's such a\noh man\nI'm thinking now about the judgment of\nthat people we need to when streamers\ntalk about their jobs it's always like I\nknow what chat thinks cuz I used to be\nchat but like many jobs across the board\nare always demanding all the time\nstreaming is one of those that is like\n24/7 mental demand and I think that it's\nhard to find Jake while I stream as I do\nbecause it's like if I free Verbeck and\nI don't know like or maybe it's a good\nthing maybe if I went fully back to Jake\nAnsari maybe my she would be cool I\ndon't know like ah yeah anyways I just\nthink it's very hard to pivot and make\nhuge life changes while you are alive\nstreamer because there's just like so so\nJake that's the problem just listen to\nthe statement you're making okay this\nthat statement is the problem your\nsalvation never came through pivoting\nand making huge life changes you never\ntried to pivot\nyou never said I'm gonna turn around 180\ndegrees what did you say to yourself how\ndid you turn around 180 degrees I just\nchange our mindset anyway why it's not\nyes you're not carrying just like not\nnot carrying but to just living for\nright now absolutely right you said\nabout what I don't care about 180\ndegrees and even now you're saying I\ndon't know how to turn things around\noh right you see it you're saying I\ndon't know how to go back 180 degrees to\nwhat I used to be but that's not how you\ngot to where you used to be you started\nby moving one degree that's what you\nshould focus on\nand even though you say oh if I become\nJake again I don't know if my stream\nwill explode there it is again\nstill Jake and bake that's Jake and bake\nhijacking Jake and he says yeah Jake\nlike bu bu buddy like I'm still gonna\ntake the reins but let's let's pretend\nthat you're gonna be in charge it's\nstill Jake ensign I'm still looking I'm\nlooking at Messiah and I'm about to\n[ __ ] knee it in half\ndo you see this thing sorry it's like\nyeah there's a site above my head yeah\nthis is a weird it's hovering always\nhovering oh my god okay Amy's sorry good\nno it's good it's a very minute we're\ngonna break it it's very memorable it's\ncool yeah right so so that's Jake Jake\nis the one who can recognize that that\nsign is your curse and is something to\nbe appreciated that your streaming\ncareer is awesome in in like great and\nthat you enjoy it and it's a lot of fun\nand it's like like you're lucky and it's\na burden it's like having a kid it's\nlike yeah it's an enjoyable and\nfulfilling and awesome you have kids no\nokay not a true boomer not actually\nlearn okay\npseudo boomer okay mr. Shido very good\nand and so like the thing about kids is\nlike sure it's awesome and fulfilling\nbut it's lots of [ __ ] exhausting and\nsucks sometimes yep Yeah right it's like\nsometimes I wanted likes it out like\nsometimes I want to play video games\nuntil 4:00 in the morning and then like\nsleep until noon but the thing is your\nkid wakes up when they wake up and like\nthey don't even you can't hit a snooze\nbutton and they like literally what\nhappened today was actually like super\ncute and I loved her but she like came\nand like I wanted to sleep because our\nalong went off at 5:00 in the morning\nand then and then she like picked up my\nhat like I was like sleeping and then\nshe was like trying to wake me up and\nthen she like picked up my head and like\nlooked it in the face and then she\nkissed me on the face and then she laid\ndown on my pillow so that I couldn't\neven lay down on the pillow and then I\nput my head I was really actually really\ncute it's like very nice but it was also\nlike I'm still tired today you know and\nthat's what Jake and bake live is Jake\nand bake like demands your attention and\nneeds it's like a hungry hungry child\nand you can appreciate it but also be\nlike man you know gotta like lay off\nfrom time to time and you need a break\nyeah but so let me ask you a question so\nlike where do you think you go from here\nlike how do we how do we help you you\nhelp yourself yeah I mean I've like I\nsaid I've been I've been like trying to\nwork towards little things I know that I\nreally enjoyed doing that really made me\nfeel like I was kind of her production\nby feel like I was just purpose every\nday had purpose like you know so little\nthings I used to work like just little\nwork out or a little yoga every morning\njust like I've been trying to take a\nlittle bit more personal time from\nstream and like off time I think like\nall little baby steps and I think what's\nimportant is that I've kind of like\nrecognized and it's the way you're\nputting two words is great because it's\nlike even easier to kind of see but I've\nkind of recognized these things and I\njust I kind of know how to fix them it's\njust I've been taking baby steps and\nlike I'm not seeing results fast enough\nand then like you know not seeing\nyourself a step is that jqj can bake\nthat might be that might actually just\nbe a Jake thing of me just thinking like\nwow you did this before you know exactly\nwhat it feels like and what it feels\nlike when you have good days we're like\nthere's some days where like if I don't\nsee him for two days I'm actually with\nmy friends we went on a hike the day\nbefore and I didn't go on the computer\nactually like I'll wake up and I'll feel\nlike crisp and I'm like holy [ __ ] like\nI've had a few those days where I'm just\nwake up I'm like dude like and those are\nthose are reassuring days it's like dude\nand that you can it's just gonna take a\nlittle time some effort you can do this\nlike those are my reassuring days but um\nanyways sorry good inside you yeah so so\nI want to just point that out right so\nlike just just pay attention to this\nthought look at this thought okay I'm\nnot getting better fast enough and it's\ngonna take some time okay\nthose are like contrary to me I think\none is Jake and bacon one is Jake and\nyou say that the days that you're crisp\nyou say it's gonna take it's gonna take\nsome time and on other days you say it's\nnot happening\nhmm those are two different people\nholding the reins I really don't think\nthat that's the same person nobody\npulled her in no you're not this is\nnormal buddy this is how everyone is\nokay so like just just let's think about\nthe scientific me for a second so first\nof all I think I do think that you know\na lot of this stuff I can't put the\npeace thing you give me the pieces of\nthe puzzle I just put them together like\nyou you're the one who's giving me this\nso you know this on some level second\nthing oh yeah\nsecond thing is that you're not weird\nlike the reason that I'm able to do this\nis because you're like other people\nright like that's the only way that I\ncould do this it's not like I'm\ndiscovering something brand-new for the\nfirst time it's like this is how people\nwork like the design of the ID works\nanxiety literally cannot exist in the\npast and cannot exist in the present it\nmust exist in the future and if your\nmind is in the present you cannot be\nexperiencing anxiety this is why video\ngames are so [ __ ] addictive because\nwhen you're raging at your teammate in\nlaw you're not thinking about how sorry\nyeah at least for kids by the way I\ndon't live you know that hey don't get\nme started bro\na lot of people on my stream like League\nand I I'm I'm a donum I'm a big fan of\ndude oh oh yeah man i culture alright\nsorry let's go boomers boomers of the\nworld unite yeah kids because I played\nthe actually like for the first time a\ncouple weeks ago it's actually kind of\nfun\nhey it's just a different game it's like\napples and oranges I think it's like one\nof these everyone can get kind of\nhoity-toity about what their own\npersonal preferences are right you can\nthink that your personal preferences\nmake you greater than another human\nbeing but it's it's more like apples and\npre-sliced packaged apples that's the\ndifference so you played oh yeah\ninteresting\nwe're not see I'm I don't play a lot but\nI'll right now play a lot of Valor in so\nI totally got sidetracked sorry you're\nreally making profound statements no no\nthat's good as well just get triggered\nby legal guards great I mean I like see\nus for a long time so it's fun just like\ncounter-strike with a little cherry on\ntop with all the abilities but you get\ncool\nyeah anyway so just thinking so so I\nthink you're not you're not like that\nweird or anything Jake don't don't worry\nabout it man you're like it's completely\nlike I think a lot of what your thoughts\nare actually quite logical even though\nif they don't feel the only reason they\nseem illogical is because we don't\nunderstand like where they're coming\nfrom like even your fear of death\nreturning it's like actually kind of\nmakes sense like it doesn't make sense\nfrom within the mind but once you\nunderstand how the mind works it's just\nyour mind is like oh we've been here\nbefore let's turn on our programming yep\nand and you know yeah so small doses of\nliving in the present like any other\nthoughts about how you move forward from\nhere I have a couple of suggestions but\nI'm curious like what you think umm well\nI don't know I honestly I really thought\nand I still think that my move back to\nLA was huge being around friends and\nfamily and kind of like being able to at\nleast have some what sometimes don't\nlike than just normal life stuff going\non however just like like timing and I\nwas just really bad like I you know just\nunable to cause I'm like hard to see\nit's just it's just out of my control I\ndon't I just not gonna worry about that\nI'm just letting the time go on and like\nuntil things kind of stabilize but that\nwas one thing I thought was a huge step\nwas kind of being back home true and\ngood little life little lifestyle things\nthat I I mean sounds kind of weird but I\nrecently bought a car I like driving I\nhaven't drove in years so I lived abroad\nand just driving my car on the highway\nmakes me feel like human again sounds\nkind of weird but I like I love that\nfeeling and like I didn't get four years\nand little things like that I think are\nreally good actually\nyeah so so I think those are awesome a\ncouple of other things to just think\nabout and and if that's sufficient I\nmean that may work alright I think it\nreally will work just a couple cherries\non top let's call them okay so the first\nthing is I think a lot of people have\nthis idea that doing something the\nsecond time should be easier than doing\nit the first time in my experience\nthat's actually not true like getting up\nand working out one day is easier than\ngetting up and working out the\nnext day hmm right so like don't judge\nyourself for being quote-unquote back to\nsquare one because I actually think that\nyou know because you're kind of saying\nlike okay this is the formula that\nworked for the first time therefore let\nme implement it again and it should work\nfor the second time I think what you're\ndealing with is actually different the\nresurgence of the problem is a different\nthing\nthe third time is easier than the second\ntime but like I don't know how to say\nthis it's just like you know overcoming\nsomething once is different from\novercoming it the second time or Rio\nwe're coming yet\nbut third time is also Rio ver coming\nyet I don't know if that makes sense\nyou mean like the first if you did it\nthe first time the second time is might\nbe difficult and more difficult but the\nthird time because these you've done it\nyou've done it this way and even it this\nway maybe now you understand I think\nthose are actually different skills sure\nokay and but the thing is doing\nsomething again is its own skill so\ntherefore third fourth fifth sixth\nseventh eighth ninth tenth times are\ndoing something again so I'll give you\njust an example okay I got it so like\nlike actually I should have started with\nthis so I in my day job I'm an addiction\npsychiatrist okay so like let me put it\nthis way when someone gets sober for the\nfirst time it's awesome if they relapse\ngetting sober again is actually harder\nokay because they you know they got\nsober first and then they were like yeah\nman I did it and then there's this whole\nother layer of shame and difficulty if\nthey come crashing down got it right\nbecause like building something for the\nfirst time is different from like\ncleaning out the rubble of like failing\nand then trying to do it again hmm\nbut then the third fourth fifth time\nthat they relapse they actually start to\nget better at it but that first relapse\nis a whole different ball game from like\nthe first time you become sober does\nthat make sense yes yes right so like\ngetting so\nthe first time in relapsing relapsing is\na whole different ballgame than like\ndoing something first so so I would give\nyourself a little bit of slack and like\ncut yourself a break if it does take\nlonger than it's supposed to because\nit's not the same thing yeah right like\nlike overcoming something when you were\n19 was different from being a streamer\nand having this artificial pressure of\nthe stream taking advantage of your your\npersonality of being very tuned in to\nwhat people think and becoming disco\nuncomfortable with their dislike like do\nyou see how like that's the way you've\nalways been but being a stream or just\n[ __ ] puts that [ __ ] on steroids yeah\nyeah yeah right so it's it's not like\nyou're not 19 anymore man and like I\ndon't mean that in a good way I like you\nknow it's like it's like it's a whole\ndifferent ballgame that you're in you're\nin the big leagues now so your anxiety\nis gonna have different things to feed\non and so it's not it's gonna take it\nmay take longer the next thing is that I\nwould I think it would really help you\nto be present in the tension so in the\npast you used to be present in your\nprogress but the question is can you be\npresent in not progressing and like I\ndon't even know if that makes sense but\nlike if you can just even acknowledge\nthat like okay today is a day that I\ncan't move one degree and if you can sit\nwith that and then like because if the\nthing is when you don't move a single\ndegree what our mind tends to do is move\ninto the future and you think about the\nconsequences of failure today right but\nthere's a funny way that you can\nactually disarm all of this [ __ ] is if\nyou can sit with your failure today and\nnot projected into the future mm-hmm and\nit's kind of saying that's kind of like\nwhat I'm doing with the fact that\nthere's a virus going on and like I'm in\nLA like I can't control I'm just kind of\nletting it great perfect I think that's\nthat's because you're kind of saying\nlike oh I'm stuck and I'm not like I\ncame here to do this and it's not\nhappening is that what you mean\nyeah but I'm very real about it like I'm\njust like it's out of my control like I\ngot\nthat kind of play out and then I can\nbeautiful those steps right so I have to\nlet that play out is not like you trying\nto plan for the exits right so if your\nanxiety was active if jake and make was\nactive what you would be doing is\nlooking for the exits and looking for\nthe bathrooms planning for eventualities\nbut what's happening Jake is like\nnothing I can do bro yeah just gotta let\nit play out\nand then when things calm down I'll\nfigure out what I'm gonna do and Jake\nand I don't say pro but yeah yeah yeah\nyeah\nsi bro um do you yeah I my biggest\nconcern is that it's not inclusive to\ncertain portions of our audience but I\nsort of use them in gender-neutral way\nwhich may mean misogynistic oh yeah well\nit's the internet so you're everything I\ndon't know yeah so I like you know I I'd\nsay that even if you can sit with the\ntension of not moving forward and be in\nthe present of not advancing that in a\nweird way can pull the plug out from\nyour anxiety does that make sense like\nyou don't have to be progressing to be\nin the present the key thing is to be in\nthe present you don't have to be taking\nthose baby steps even if you sit with\nthe failure of not being able to take a\nbaby step today it'll actually still do\nthe same thing okay\nand the last thing is sometimes I teach\npeople how to meditate so I can teach do\nyou meditate um no when I was night one\nof things I tried and I actually got to\na point where I tell Sharon a time\nstream so I there's like one song that\ntriggers my favorite song I'll expect my\nfor relaxation song and there's a point\nroute like I'll just practice meditation\nYouTube techniques and that one fit I\nwas like super spiritually meditating it\nwas jr. and he kind of like taught me a\nlittle bit and there's one point I could\nmeditate so if you if that I hadn't\nheadphones in with music and I could\ntune out the music was gone and like it\nwas really cool actually but I know I do\nnot meditate but I thought sure you can\nthink that you do you meditate I think\nfor see one's dreams no yeah yes I'm\nsorry you do meditate yeah sure yeah so\nI wanted to share that with you cuz I\nthought that was super but that was\nactually really cool at that and that's\nlike yeah a lot of people don't believe\nin meditation but I thought it was\nreally cool that it's real\nyeah\nyeah no I do not do you want to learn\ntoday I mean maybe yeah I'm open for\neverything I'm hope I'm an open-minded\nperson and I'm ready for anything I\nthink except for okay things so okay I\nwas gonna say a joke but go for anything\nBilly I don't need to do that I'll say\nI'm up for anything except for but stuff\nlike that's the joke I was gonna say but\nlike it's I don't know if this is the\nright context streaming is like just in\nthere it's just taking fake talking okay\njust trying to make a joke and Havok you\nso that's what I'm saying it's like\nletting him talk but just be aware who's\ntalking right so like let him out from\ntime to time all right\nI think Jake's Jake's been operating\nlong enough Jake and Baker\nshake it bake it deserves it a run on\nthe on the track you know I gotta let\nthem exercise and come out there from\ntime to time but yeah yeah so you said\nmaybe and you said you're up for\nanything so I'm not quite sure yes okay\nyes I would all right so I'll teach you\na meditation technique and and you know\nwhat I would tell you is that the goal\nof is you people ask me how often should\nI meditate and then I say you know three\nto five minutes to start out with three\nto five times a week but in your case\nthe answer is gonna be today okay right\nso like be careful about setting a\nschedule for yourself in terms of\nmeditation we do yoga that's really good\nso you have yes so the last thing is\nthat you you know may be worth your\nwhile to see a therapist or mental\nhealth professional if this stuff\ncontinues or starts to impair your\nfunction okay right so like I'm sure\nthat someone somewhere could diagnose\nyou with an anxiety disorder because\npeople like diagnosing people with\nthings but that's not something you I'm\nnot I'm not telling you you have this\nit's just like you need a more thorough\nevaluation and they'll ask you a lot of\nquestions that I didn't ask you like for\nexample you know does anyone in your\nfamily have anxiety and like you know\nhow long did it last and all this kind\nof good stuff\nso you know having to find the exits by\nthe way is something called agoraphobia\nso that that sense of of like needing to\nescape and needing\nsafety and being assured of like safety\nis like oftentimes or is one\nmanifestation of something called\nagoraphobia which sometimes also people\ncall his like fear of going outside so\nthey stay at home because they're afraid\nof like what could happen if they leave\nthe house yeah yeah so you know I I'd\nsay that if it really starts to affect\nyou I'd really strongly consider seeing\na mental health professional and see if\nyou actually you know do fit criteria\nfor an anxiety disorder and there are\ntreatments for that treatments for\nanxiety disorders include like\npsychotherapy like talk therapy exposure\ntherapy which is when you kind of like\nexpose yourself to whatever you know\ninduces the anxiety in medication yeah\nyeah so let's meditate let me just think\nI don't want to say anything else any\nquestions for me uh no okay I'm not\nreally I mean yeah so something else for\nyou to just chew on so you know\nsometimes I talk about Karma garma hmm\nand and you know you don't have to\nbelieve this it's just I find it\nfascinating that like you know I think\nthat your initial bout of anxiety was\npart of your the way I see that I'm not\nsaying it's true it's just the way that\nI conceptualize people I think I look\nthrough them through the lens of karma\nand the really interesting thing is that\nwithout your fear of death I don't think\nyou would have become the person that\nyou are today so I see a strong karmic\ninfluence there that essentially like\nyou know that was a pretty big event\nthat altered the course of your life and\nif you feel so inclined to indulge in\nthis kind of irrational thinking and\nthen I would encourage you to think a\nlittle bit about your current challenge\nand whether that's also life signaling\nyou to like take take stock of where you\nare right now and don't just act on Auto\nbecause that's essentially what your\nfear of death did for you back then is\nit like kind of woke you up and helped\nyou recalibrate and put you on a path\nthat it sounds like has been very\nenriching for you as well as like people\nwho watched you yeah so just something\nto toss out and think about if you if\nyou want\nappreciate ya okay so any thoughts about\nthat I\nI mean I've I get I think I've thought\nsomething similar just like is\neverything I'm doing right now\nthe not the word isn't right but it's\nlike is there something that is like I\ndon't know like deeper that is just not\nnot correct right now like is they yeah\nI thought yeah yeah yeah so I encourage\nyou to continue thinking about it you\nknow I I don't know so being sort of a\nscientist by background like it's kind\nof interesting because I don't know if\nthat's true but if you look at things\nfrom a data perspective just because\nit's true doesn't mean that it doesn't\nhave utility right so like\ngood evidence that we rethinking your\nlife through like a broader perspective\nhas utility and positive outcomes even\nif it's not true hmm anyway so so I'm\nglad you're thinking about it and\nencourage you to continue thinking about\nit maybe meditating on it exploring it\ntalking with your friends and and your\nbrother and girlfriend and stuff like\nthat going for long drives and mulling\nit over it's a good one yeah going for\nhikes things like that yeah\nokay so let's meditate so sit up\nstraight and I'm gonna teach you the\npractice that we do relatively often on\nthe stream but I'll just you know do it\nagain because we haven't taught it in a\nlittle while and it's actually a really\nreally good practice for anxiety and\npart of the reason it's a good practice\nfor anxiety is because when your mind\nbecomes anxious you actually activate\nlike your adrenaline system and you're\nlike danger neurocircuitry so you start\nto feel like you're in danger and your\nheart starts beating fast you start\ngetting sweaty your stomach feels a lot\nto me yep so this this technique in some\nso it's a weird amount of scientific\nsupport so has some very basic\nscientific support and has clinical\nsupport but the middle part we don't\nreally know to be true which is weird\nbut basically what this technique does\nis shuts off your sympathetic nervous\nsystem and reactivates your\nparasympathetic nervous system so it\nshuts off your adrenaline and like kind\nof like calms you down and like\nactivates your vagus nerve vagus nerve\nis what slows down your heart adrenaline\npumps up your heart there's a vagus\nnerve here I hit it you knock you out I\ndidn't like that one okay vagus nerve\nactually runs what kind of along your\nthroat but I'm okay anyway second people\nget yeah I mean it's it is over there\nbut it's like deeper it's not like near\nthe surface of your neck okay well I am\nfeeling a little nervous for now so I'm\nreally curious then great\nso is your nose clogged just one nostril\nbut it's fine I can breathe with my nose\nokay\nso low it let me see yeah okay so one of\nyour nostrils is gonna be more close\nthan the other do you have a deviated\nseptum\nyou don't know ever been to the doctor\nfor that I know that is never been to\nthe doctor for it\nokay is is the same nostril always\nclosed for you no but I should keep an\neye on that I've never kept tonight all\nright wait yeah it's my left one so okay\ngood someone remember that okay so if\nyou're curious about that we can have a\nanother conversation about so I'm sort\nas the rhythm of your nostrils opening\nand closing but can you do this just\nfall down yep great so I want you to\ntake your thumb and block your right\nnostril\nyep and then breathe in through your\nleft and then block this switch and\nbreathe out breathe in through the right\nnostril again and when you have a full\nbreath of air switch and breathe out\nbreathe in through the same switch and\nbreathe out in switch out\nI'll keep talking but go ahead close\nyour eyes B then switch out in switch\nout it's okay yo\nit's okay to yawn if you need to in\nswitch out and now continue at your own\npace remember to switch on a full breath\ngood so that in in switch on a full\nbreath we'll practice for about 60 to 90\nseconds\nyou\ngo ahead and finish the round that\nyou're on Laker eyes remain closed let\nyour hands relax when you're done with\naround and just sit and enjoy\noh hi here meditate no d1d I know I was\ntelling the story about you earlier it's\nokay I'll bring her a minute okay come\nhere okay\nOh am I still meditating huh am I still\nmeditating I don't know are you\nhe told me what was that like film is\nokay I could feel my heart and I was and\nactually when I felt my heart I was\ngonna stop and say am I supposed to hear\nmy heart beating but then I turned that\npotential negative thought into a\npositive thought and instead I embraced\nmy heartbeat and I wanted to feel the\nrhythm and think about what it's beating\nand where all the Bloods going that's\nwhy I did actually in my head right now\nwell sounds great I hope so how was it\nwas it a pleasant experience yeah it was\nI mean so I gave flu or something but it\nwas for me the biggest thing about\nmeditating was always that you have a\nsense of control over your body that\nusually don't have a night\nyeah that's maybe that like you can kind\nof feel yourself and I don't really do\nthat really but yeah there's definitely\nthat was positive so as you were paying\nattention to your heart were you\nthinking thoughts or were you just\nfeeling things there was a lot of fun\nbut then I started to just to try to at\nthe very end there try to just focus on\nthe beat and I tried to just envision it\nkind of reading the right so as as you\nand whatever your vision does great yep\nyeah as you envision it and you focus on\nit what happens to your thoughts they\nweren't there anymore\nyeah it wasn't yeah it was yeah they\nweren't there yeah so I think that's the\npoint right is to free yourself from the\nthoughts be quiet so that Daddy can\nteach no you want attention this is what\nwe call attention seeking behavior any\nany so Jake you know I'd hey hey she\nwants to be a streamer I guess she's\nperforming for someone okay so Jake one\nany questions for me before you wrap up\nbecause I think I'm gonna have to go cuz\nshe's hey you want to get out of here\nyou wanna stay uh I don't I don't know\nif I have any questions right now I mean\nI was it was kind of it's nice to hear\nyou know how you kind of portrayed\nthings and it's things that I kind of\nknew but it maybe I just kind of was\nlooking through like it was a little\nfuzzy still looking at my picture what I\nthink is going on yeah I think you help\npaint the picture a little bit better\num for me I think I'm always someone\nthat like I said before is very\nstrong-willed and I'd it's not it's not\ngonna be the same but I really think\nthat the knowledge under say of what's\ncausing things is is the first is like\nfor me like a huge step in and after\nthat it's really just not not worrying\nabout it taking a short a long time it\nlike it did the first time and comparing\nit but just kind of just you know using\nthat knowledge to I don't know float I\nflow out of things as it's supposed to\nhappen\nday by day instead of yeah bring about\nyeah when beautifully put man but I\nthink you know I I agree with you that\nlike understanding what's going on is\nthe first step and and one of the things\nthat I say on stream pretty often is\ngood diagnosis perceives good treatment\nand until you know what's going on you\ncan't really fix any things true alright\nso thank you very much man it was
