    "transcript": "okay hey hi how are you I'm good and you\nI'm doing well so what should i what do\nyou go by what should I call you uh Jade\nis fine jade estate yeah how can I call\nyou dr. cake yeah I'll look or dr. K\nwhatever feels more comfortable to you\nno it's fine well I'm never I'm so\nnervous\nyeah me too mmm what are you what what\nwhat are you nervous about um I don't\nknow like I often talk about like house\nlike topics that we might talk about\ntoday but I never talk with someone on\nstream about them does it make sense\nyeah sure thanks oh and one of the\ntopics that we might talk about today Oh\ncould be anything from mental health to\nanxiety to traumas to I don't I don't\nknow like I've seen clips of yours and\nusually those are like the topics so I'm\nexpecting those what do you want to talk\nabout um what do I want to talk about\nwell okay can you maybe talk about what\nyou usually do in stream like how the\nprocess of it okay sure okay the process\nof so okay so stream usually starts I\ntry to start on time mm-hmm like at 12\nor 12:01 or 1202 and then usually the\nfirst 5 to 10 minutes involves me trying\nto fix a technical difficulty because\nI'm a Boomer and I tell you what Jade I\nliterally do not understand this like I\nswear to god there's some kind of curse\nlike I'm not that incompetent because\nthe thing that I don't understand so I\nhave a computer you know I have a\nmicrophone and every time I turn on the\ncomputer like the desktop is the same\nevery time I load a video game it's not\nlike my mouth stops working so my\nunderstanding is that if I open stream\nlabs and it's configured and I haven't\ntouched anything it should work the\nexact same way as it did the day before\nall right\nlike I have this microphone and this\nmicrophone is the same [ __ ]\nmicrophone that I've been using for like\ntwo months and then today I log on and\nit's like staticky and I do not\nunderstand how that works so I spend the\nfirst 10 minutes trying to figure out\nwhy the [ __ ] I'm so incompetent and\ntwitch at usually you know enjoys that\nand or we have some fun with it and then\nI give a little disclaimer I have some\nkind of spiel where I usually like so\nI'm an academic mm-hmm and so I tend to\nlike to hear myself talk\nso I usually talk at my audience for\nabout 15 to 20 minutes about what's on\nmy mind and then we have an interview\nwith a human being and then I ask the\nhuman being if there's some way that I\ncan be helpful and I have a background\nin you know so I studied for a monk to\nbecome a monk for about seven years a\nmonk yeah oh that's interesting yeah\nthat's cool and then I met my wife and\nso things got confusing I mean I met her\nso so you know I met her actually three\nmonths three months in of the seven\nyears I met my wife and then was\nthinking was planning on becoming a monk\nand so studied a lot of like yoga and\nmeditation and spirituality and stuff\nand then she is a wonderful person but\nalso wanted to be married to a doctor so\nI decided to go to medical school and\nthen no way yeah kind of\nand so then you know I I did\nneuroscience research for a couple of\nyears and then studied like basically\nthe brain psychology and medicine for\nanother eight years and then now I show\nup on stream and I talked to a human and\nthen I try to use anything from that 15\nyears that I've learned to try to help\nthem with any kind of problem that\nthey're having okay that's cool like\nsuper interesting like everything\ntogether sounds like you should write a\nbook\nmaybe one day I'll make someone write a\nbook for you I mean it's worth it yeah I\nget it\noh yeah sure I try to write I'm trying\nto write like five books no that's great\na biographical but yeah I'm glad you\nfound my story interesting can you tell\nme about yourself mmm okay I'm Jay's I\ngrew up in Germany\nBona raised him lived for two years in\nThailand but now I'm back\ndue to Corona I wanted to be with my\nfamily and I started streaming on Twitch\naround two years ago okay but I really\ngot like into the community since\nDecember before that I just did my own\nthing I wasn't really associated with\nany other streamers and what I stream is\nbasically mainly just chatting if I have\na PC like right now I try to game and\nyeah I just do just chatting and and\nwhen you say you you weren't really a\npart of the community and until December\nwhat is that how does one become a part\nof the community what does that mean oh\nI would say like not community but like\nassociated with other streamers like\nbefore that I didn't know any other\nstreamers I didn't extra filly any\nstreamers and in December around that\ntime period\nI got to know other streamers and that's\nhow I slowly got into the hole and I'm\nstuck the lifestream fail hole yeah tell\nme about the livestream fail hole oh it\nstarts usually like with one two clips\nthat are like really funny and then\npeople want to see more and then there's\nmore clips out of context that are not\nas funny that are just really drama\ncreating clips and then you kind of\nstuck there because all your clips keep\nbeing posted there you can't do anything\nagainst it really so and how does that\nfeel I feel helpless because I contacted\nthe mods of the reddit the subreddit but\nthey don't care obviously cuz clips and\nuse and abuse clips of use I mean\nupwards downwards like that's all the\nmatters not how the people actually feel\nwhy do you always post it there mmm\nguess there's\npeople eventually end up on my stream\nand it's hard to like stream and then\nseeing all the negativity in the other I\nmust say from reddit specifically I got\na bunch of viewers who are really nice\njust though they're of you individuals\nwho make it hard for me too mmm and this\nis what we do by the way yeah I noticed\nI see you what you do it's like the\nthings they write in chat I really heard\nfull cuz I mean I can't blamed and they\nsee one thing about me they don't know\nanything about me and then they'll\ndirect accordingly to what I say okay so\nyeah and what what are they what is the\nslice of you or the thing that's taken\nout of context that they react to it's\nmostly and only very sexual the things I\nsay thank you really random sexual\nthings\nlike I don't say random the sexual\nthings that are taken out of yeah yes\nyes you say random sexual things that\nare taken out of context and I mean it's\naltogether like something sexual but\nthey did take like one part of it I see\nand like which looks they're really\nreally bad and I can't like I mean it\ndoes but yeah I can't really defend\nmyself here what it is sorry about that\nno okay so and and so is theirs so it\nsounds like it's pretty stressful for\npeople to you know for people to take\nthings that you say out of context it\ndoes sound like you talk about sex or\nsexuality in some form on your stream\nmm-hmm okay\nand that gets taken out of context and\nthen it's kind of stressful because\nyou're trying to fight against a false\nperception of yourself right I mean I\ndon't want to fight against the fact\nthat I am like always horny or like\nsomewhat perverted it's just to make it\nthe way they make it always seem like is\nthat I say they made me say those things\num okay maybe I should throw in\nsomething I'm hyper sexual which is\nsomething that I've been since 2016 what\ndoes that mean dude Edie I had a sexual\ntrauma like sexual violence against me\nand since then in order to cope with\nthat I started to become sexual in order\nto normalize what happened to me back\nthen and now it became like a\nunfortunately became of a trade of mine\nlike being always sexual I'm talking to\nLube do I make sense yeah you make\nperfect sense I'm just trying to okay\nalthough what you're saying is good I'm\nnot sure if I follow what I say no Jayde\nlet me just tell you another thing that\nI do sometimes I like I will just not\nsay anything because I'm processing and\nthen I may actually ask you for time to\nthink about what I say and that is also\na meme mm-hmm we're all just people like\ncan I just think for a second okay come\nbut but you can keep going so you were\nsaying that you had a sexual trauma that\nhappened when in 2016\ndo you mind if I ask I know generally\nspeaking it's an impolite question to\nask so you don't have to answer it but\ncan you tell me like ballpark how it\nwill do you are I was 16\nyou were 16 so you're 20 now yes okay\nthat's very young too okay okay\nhmm so what is happening okay\nokay sorry someone is remote desktop\nagain maybe they need to fix something\nthat I'm not aware of but okay sorry\nabout that so you were saying you are\nyou were so you're hyper sexual as a\nresult of sexual trauma mm-hmm yes and\nso what do you mean by what is hyper\nsexual mean and oh god okay so basically\nto simplify it it's just my thoughts and\nfantasies my thoughts and sexual\nfantasies hold me back in life like I\nsabotage myself because I act\nimpulsively on my sexual needs and my\nthoughts are usually most of time to\nalways on sex and well what comes with\nit and it's something I tried to get rid\nof really because sometimes I have it at\nthe most inappropriate moments like at\nthe funeral which is really bad it's\njust I can't get rid of it's like my\nmind is stuck and I really try because\nI've noticed that me being like that\nmakes people uncomfortable and yeah I'm\nreally working on that too\nokay so let me ask you have you seen a\nmental health professional like a\npsychiatrist or therapist\nyeah I've seen six seven with I was\nactually meant at the mental asylum\nmental asylum mental hospital the roof\nthat is seven because it was but it was\nmore than one specialist but I'd taken\none category so seven okay and so you've\nseen seven while you were in the\nhospital or like you're talking about\nbefore now no no like six altogether and\nlike when I was in the hospital like\nthat time I take us number seven in\nthere was more than one yeah and so six\ntherapists have they been helpful have\nany of them been helpful one one was\nhelpful there are they made it worse\nthat one person was helpful I don't know\nlike them way they put them a lot of\nthings in my mind I didn't think about\nbeforehand wish\nme worry more and more okay like but the\none that helped me was the one who was\nto say straightforward he was like an\n[ __ ]\nhe was straightforward he didn't care\nabout my Felix and that's exactly what I\nneeded and he said basically if you\nforget back then I was a I I was in the\nasylum because I tried to take my life\nnot assign imma keep saying asylum\nmental hospital and he basically said so\nyou don't want to be here anymore and me\nback then super dramatic no and he said\nthen\nso how would she like the idea of you\nbeing buried and your siblings would be\naround your grave and that like that\nimage made me realize that I don't want\nto die yeah it was tough I was there\nseventeen my arms were open and I was\njust really blank and I had only one\nthought which was I want I don't want to\nbe here anymore\nand then after he said that I just I\nrealized I can't do this I can't leave\nthem behind so do you remember why you\ndidn't want to be alive yeah yes I do\nit's yeah that's why I'm here like I am\nin general I'm always comfortable about\ntalking anything and everything because\nI hope by me being open about it that\nsomeone will see it and eventually open\nup\nI had a depression since I've been 8 and\nI always had like this constant sadness\nlike like this in order to how I says\nevery time I was sad I thought it would\nbetter to hurt myself because the pain\nwould be better than the feelings I feel\nand I was always the sadness wherever I\nwould be and then bad fix it happened\nlike in 2016 or when I was younger like\nall together those felt so heavy and I\nfelt like a burden because I could see\nmy parents always worried they always\nhad this worry in their eyes like when\nthey asked me somethings how are they\nthey say how are they like how are you\nbut in my case every time I felt like\nwhen they asked me how I am\nit was more like checking like am i\nstable am i mentally ok and I just\nreally felt like a burden constantly so\nsome point I felt like let's just get it\nover with and do you just feel like a\nburden\nnot as much sometimes\nemotionally I feel like a burden to them\nbut not like like me I earn my own money\nI am in that way I'm independent but\nlike emotionally I do you think that I\nweighed them down sometimes and yeah\nit's I don't know it's like when parents\nhide from their children that they cry\nbecause I don't want them to feel\nworried that's how I feel like now I\ndon't want the emotion around them\nanymore cause I'm afraid that they will\nworry again Jim I think for a second\nturn off my marker because someone is\nit's distracting so they're trying to I\nthink fix something but let me just\nthink the the therapist who was helpful\nwas the one that you saw when you were\nin the hospital no that was the one\nafter the hospital and why did you stop\nseeing them because I felt I don't want\na long-term thing I want someone who\nhelps me like for a couple of months and\nthen I'm done\nlike I back then I was just really edgy\nlike oh I just want to party like what's\nthe point of going every Wednesday there\nand after you said I felt like okay I\ndon't need him anymore I don't want to\ndie anymore\nso I was like okay I'm done but that was\njust what do you think wish me what I\nneed yeah fundamentally there is nothing\nreally I need it's just always like in\nmoments like where you once like someone\nto cry on her shoulder like a hug like\nsimple things like this in moments what\nI needed but like right now no I don't\nneed anything maybe if I do\nbut right now I wouldn't know what to\nsay to be honest because there's nothing\nreally right now my mind I need that\nyeah so I think that's a problem it is\nyes so I'm gonna just toss this out so I\nthink what I'm hearing from you is that\nyour perception of your needs depend on\nindividual states of mind hmm but I I\nthink you need something how can I say\nthis I think you need something right\nnow because I I don't get the sense that\nyou're well mm-hmm right so you may be\nfunctional and you may actually be like\n80 percent healthy or 90 percent healthy\nbut it still sounds like you have a\nparticular function of your mind which\nis out of your control and what what it\nsounds like when you try to fix\nsomething is when you perceive that\nsomething is broken does that make sense\nyeah and I think that's a problem\nbecause just because you don't perceive\nit's broken\ndoesn't mean that it isn't broken and\nthat it can't be worked on hold on my my\nmind is so let me put it this way I get\nthe sense that what so like you deal\nwith fires whenever they start so like\nyour house starts burning like it\ncatches on fire then you take a bucket\nof water and you're like I don't then\nyou put out the fire right make sense\nbut what I'm getting the sense of is\nthat your your house maybe catches fire\npretty frequently and so even though you\nonly need water when it catches fire\nthere may be some value to working on\nyourself in between the times that your\nhouse is burning so that it doesn't\ncatch fire is often all right what do\nyou think about that and sorry because I\ndidn't explain it very well but I mean I\ndon't understand somewhat but I'd never\nput I didn't really see you like that\nlike at all like I didn't feel like I\ndidn't think that I give off the\npresence that I am NOT okay and when I'm\nnot okay that I fix a meal ages and then\nokay again this makes sense yeah so so\nbut is that what you like you basically\nyou try to become okay when you're not\nokay\num that I wouldn't even say okay that's\nit what it but means okay like\nemotionally okay or together like what\nbut do you understand under being okay\nyeah so let me even take a step back\nokay so are you happy with who you are\nright now and the way that your life is\noh no I think I can improve okay what do\nyou what do you wish was different about\nyour life\num above my life specifically maybe my\nliving situation cuz I had like I again\nlike I mentioned I left at Thailand now\nI'm back in Germany but I currently\nliving at my grandparents was just\nawesome I love them but I want my own\nlife kind of like that's like a one part\nthat I would like to change here are you\nhappy as a person um sometimes like I do\nhave my moments like yeah I'm good okay\nmm-hmm\nI think I'm I'm rubbing up against the\nsame thing but I just don't know exactly\nhow to\nhold on sorry this is great confusing if\nsomeone's on my desktop again so ok let\nme just think about this for a second\nhmm okay let's keep talking I'm gonna\ntry to piece this together in my mind as\nwe talk so you say you're happy\nsometimes yeah but I think it's normal\nno like yes you bad times you good times\nyeah yeah so some people have a sense of\noverall contentment or happiness that is\nnot an emotion here here we go okay so\nthey're there too when I say the word\nhappy there are two things that I'm\nreferring to one is an emotion and an\nemotion is something that you experience\nin the present and the second is like an\noverall sense of like contentment with\nyour life okay okay so my answer to this\nI don't think so I think so is I agree\nso the old state the overt state of man\nlike yeah heavy and and and so then when\nI ask you and some of this could be a\nlanguage barrier but when I ask you you\nknow what do you feel like you need and\nwhen you say nothing I feel like you\nneed something because I don't think\nthat your overall sense of contentment\nis there and that something needs to be\nworked on or changed for you to feel\noverall happy and content with your life\nokay no I understand okay then let's go\nback to the question what do I need I\nfeel like what I mostly need is a sense\nof progress cuz I feel like the past\nweeks I haven't had any progress\nwhatsoever as a matter of fact I feel\nlike I'm took a huge step back in life\nwhen if something happened over the past\nfew weeks uh know it well months in that\ncase it's actually been quite a while\nbut again I have to go back to the thing\nwhere I lived in Thailand and I kept it\nmy life there for two years and then\nsomething happened and like having my\nown life and just going back to my old\nlife\nthat really took a toll on me okay and\nyeah so need to progress in life that's\nbut it's a little bit difficult because\nI actually planned on taking it step by\nperhaps staying away in America but now\nI can't obviously sound like a little\nbit like that's my issue it made like a\ngoal like oh and free months are going\nto America and then I'm gonna do this\ninjustice but not because of do to covet\nand the well the other issues that are\ngoing on right now I can't do that so I\nhad to again do step back and now I feel\nlike I'm stuck in my old life can you\ntell me about what your old life is like\nwell living in my city which is a\nbeautiful city\nmy family's here I'm happy to have\nacross with my family but I left the\ncity my home for a reason was I because\nI connect with this place sadness I am\nsad in living in my city living and\nJeremy maybe all together\nbut maybe the the people the memories\nthe a lot of okay I don't want to do the\nvictim card cuz I have done things in\nlife that are not okay\nbut no I'm just saying what I've said\nnow things like Oh betrayal and like\npain like sounds like I always got pain\nbut I also did things that were not okay\nbut I mean yeah but I connect whole\nthings I asked you what makes you sad\nyes but I wanted to say like the that\nthe pain I got by living here and the\namount of times I've been betrayed and\nlied to and like like in general it's\nmore negative feelings that I have\nconnected to my home than positive yeah\nbut but I thought why did you feel the\nneed to say I don't want to play the\nvictim card because it's like right now\nthe way I talk it sounds like I'm really\nlike I'm being a victim but I don't want\nto be a victim I don't want to make it\nsound like that it's just I can't say it\nany differently because that's how I\nfeel\nso why do you feel like this is being\nmade why do you think you sound like a\nvictim okay I guess all I do right now\nis like complain and complain and only\nlike if I've only talked about negative\nthings right now I don't know\nyou mean right now is in over the course\nof this conversation yeah it makes you\nfeel like really like Oh pity me like\nand I want to do you think I'm hitting\nyou know like that's how I feel about\nmyself and hear myself talk I agree\nthat's yeah so so let's just look at\nthat for a second yeah so you have a\nperception hold on sorry\nthere's I'm trying to give birth to a\nthought and I'm trying to make it so I\nwant you to notice that when you start\nto talk about your pain there is a part\nof your mind that invalidates or D\nvalues your experience hmm do you see\nthat yeah I do I feel like that's\nsignificant but I'm not quite sure how\nor why do you have any idea how that\ncould be significant no okay maybe you\nneed another fought baby I do need\nanother thought baby would it be okay if\nyou are you a victim no I don't see\nmyself as a victim what do you see\nyourself as I wouldn't I don't know if I\ncan label myself to be honest well you\nsee yourself as something because it's\nnot a victim no not even I just know I'm\nnot an another victim I don't know\nexactly\nwell light I don't know exactly what I\nam but to that question I'm no I'm not\nso so so okay no no no no it's it's\ngreat\nno so Jade I think I get it right so let\nme put it this way your sense of\nidentity is built on the idea that you\nare not a victim that's what your\nidentity is yeah right so like that\nseems weird to me in some way I'm not\nquite sure why I'm not saying you're ill\nor anything so let me let me let me say\na couple you want to say you look like\neveryone sees no it's just maybe I have\nthis mind like saying that I'm not a\nvictims because when I look at other\npeople's when they talk the way I talk\nabout what I just mentioned and\neverything people always label them as\nvictims or like survivors and so I just\nwhen I don't know that that's how it's\nlike online like first time they meet\nyou movement and they're people call\nthem survivors and victims and so on and\nthat's why I said like I am NOT that\nafter mentioning everything I mentioned\nwhat's wrong with being that there's\nabsolutely nothing wrong with that it's\njust that's not how I see myself\nso what's wrong with you seeing yourself\nthat way dad I don't know it's just it\ndoesn't sit with me\nright what doesn't sit with you so if I\nwere to say you Jade I think you are a\nvictim\nso it sounds weak to me not that being a\nvictim is weakness it's just again no no\nno no no it is hold on let's be clear\nabout what you're saying okay how do you\nfeel right now you feel okay I've been\ncornered I see that I'm sorry by you and\na son that's one good the son is alive\nI've recruited the Sun to shine in your\nface okay so so I I get that you feel\ncornered so let's just talk about that\nfor a second yes what are we doing\nthat's making you feel cornered mmm\nmaybe it's because for Safari Kevin\ncomes not that I want to conclusions\njust usually you talk about something\nthen you come to in conclusion but we\nkeep jumping and jumping and I feel like\noverwhelmed\nthe range of topics we've been already\ntalking about so I apologize for that\nno it's that's that's not it's not a bad\nthing it's like it came from me as well\nlike I jumped all so so sure but can I\napologize for it no I don't think that\nit's just of course yes of course you\ncan apologize okay do you forgive me\nyeah we do\nthank you so I'll try to jump around a\nlittle bit less and I wonder if you're\nfeeling cornered because I'm looking at\nsomething that you makes you\nuncomfortable like all this talk I've\ngotten the sense that you felt cornered\nsince we started talking about your\nidentity as a victim or not a victim yes\nbecause I never thought about that topic\nlike the other things we talked about\ncame up to my mind but that's\nspecifically I'm I'm prepared you could\nsay so I really wanted to yeah so let's\ntalk about that for a second so I think\nusually the way in which I try to help\npeople is by not talking about what they\nunderstand but talking about what they\ndon't understand and I do think that it\nmakes sense to me like for example I\nhaven't asked you a whole lot about your\nsexual perversions and stuff like that\nbecause I think you get that stuff and\nit's the cool thing is that your that\nlooks really uncomfortable this one is\nalmost good so so in a sense Jade\nbecause you have thought about that and\ntalked about all that stuff you're able\nto actually explain it to me very like\nsuccinctly and then like I feel\ncomfortable moving on because like you\nactually understand all that stuff yes\nand and I I do think that what we're\nrunning up against is okay so while we\nwait for the Sun I'm gonna compose my\nthoughts okay okay\nokay give me just give me a minute\nokay I'm ready so either this is gonna\nmake sense it's not gonna make any sense\nat all then we have to go back to the\ndrawing board okay okay okay so\nsomething happened to you when you were\n16\nright yes and then you say that you're\nnot a victim right yeah okay so like so\nwhen I asked you like who are you you're\nlike I don't know but I'm not a victim\nso I think your sense of identity is\nbuilt around the fact that you are not a\nvictim like that's who you are it's like\nit's it's a sense of identity that's\nbuilt around negative space it's not\nlike I am this it's what I am is not\nthis and then when I ask you like okay\nwhat's wrong with being a victim and\nthen you say well like being a victim is\nweak and then you do something very\nsimple like very tricky and then you say\nother victims aren't weak but I'm if I'm\na victim you don't blame other people\nfor like being victims if they're\nsexually assaulted but you don't get to\nblame yourself if you were sexually\nassaulted you see how you do that\nbecause you don't think other people are\nweak but you think yourself is weak if\nyou are a victim yeah right and then\nwhat happens is like there's something\nweird because if you were sexually\nassaulted and Europe if there's a victim\nthere's a perpetrator right there's a\ncriminal and for that relationship to\nexist if someone is a victim it's not\ntheir fault it's the other person's\nfault right and so then the question\nbecomes if you're not a victim then\nwhose fault is it I may be but on who is\nresponsible for what happened to you\nwhen you were 16 I think both parties me\nand the person did it to me okay how do\nyou feel like you're responsible\nthere there were rules like that I\ndidn't like them there were rules you\nshouldn't be out that long and I went\nout longer than that order longer than\nthe curfew and I drank so I was drunk\nand I broke the rules\nthat's how I got into your situation so\nthat's why I feel like I definitely am\nto blame here okay as well can I think\nabout that for a second yeah\nactually first let me take a step back\nwhat did you think about what I shared\nearlier about like what happened to you\nand like sort of the identity of being a\nnon victim and it may be sound like a\nhypocrite kind of like the way yeah they\nKathy got it I definitely see how what i\nhiccup hypocrite I am being well so I so\nI'd be careful so I wouldn't use the\nword hypocrite but I understand what you\nmean so this is what I would say I think\nyou hold yourself to a different\nstandard than you hold other people what\ndo you think about right sure\nis that what you mean by hypocrite like\nyou judge yourself differently from the\nway that you judge other people I mean\nyeah but I mean that's true\nI do a lot myself different than other\npeople that's true I have a different\nopinion they say it's someone who has\nthe same experience as I do I would\nstill judge differently denied judge\nmyself yeah and so the reason I wouldn't\nquite call it a hypocrite is because I\nthink a hypocrite tends to judge\nthemselves unfairly in like a positive\nway mm-hmm whereas I think you actually\nare the office of America which is that\nsure you have a double standard but\nyou're harder on yourself than you are\non other people hmm what do you think\nabout that\nI never really noticed till now I mean\nwhat would you say though so let's think\nabout it now I mean yeah just judging by\nthe example that we just have with me\nsaying I'm weak and daughters aren't it\ndoes sound like I'm harder myself I'm\nlike I'm my biggest critic but I like to\nbe that I like to be my biggest critic\nmy biggest hater so others can't be\ndoesn't make sense yeah there we go\nthere it is okay what it sounded like\nthey came and fought to some like\neverything up like there it is like oh\nI'm sorry didn't I felt like that was a\nvery significant statement what okay I I\nreally am not sure about anything I say\nright now okay that's okay maybe I'm\nrelying too much on your thoughts right\nnow - in order to understand mine that's\njust maybe that's my thing I think\nthat's probably true yeah okay that's\nalso a good observation how are you\nfeeling right now Jade I can imagine\nyou're feeling quite uncomfortable no\nnot uncomfortable it's of course as we\ntalked about things I've never really\nconsidered or came up to my mind like\nit's it's it's new that's all yeah good\nyeah so it's foreign okay so what did\nyou say you say you like to blame\nyourself more than what why are you so\nharsh on yourself oh okay this is a\nstupid but do you know the movie pitch\nperfect no there's this girl called fat\nAmy and she just calls her name she\ncalls us her fat Amy so other people's\ncan call her fat and after watch a movie\nsomething in my mind was like that makes\nsense so I became like that as well I\nthink I judge myself harder I'm in\ngeneral like always see like the\nnegative things first\nand then perhaps a positive mm-hmm say\nyeah so so I think you said something in\nit I think you said it beautifully that\nyou you liked to you know put yourself\ndown or blame yourself so that other\npeople can't hurt you more than you can\nhurt yourself yes what do you think\nabout that that's toxic and yeah and\nalso it is not stupid okay so I know I\nagree with you that it's toxic but\nthere's something very very adaptive\nso here's here are the two scenarios\nokay so here I I think it's very\nimportant for you to do that for\nyourself right now and I and let me\nexplain to you why okay so I'm gonna\nneed a second to collect my thoughts\nagain so I'm gonna lay out two scenarios\nfor you okay there's one world in which\nyou don't know if you're a good person\nor a bad person and maybe people will\ntreat you with love and maybe people\nwill treat you with hate and that's a\nscary world that go to live in because\nyou don't know what's gonna happen when\nyou step outside your door you could get\nhugged and you could get punched and\nthat's [ __ ] terrifying there's\nanother world in which I wake up every\nmorning and I punch myself in the face\nand I survive that and then I know that\nwhen I step outside no one out there can\nhurt me in a way that I won't be able to\nsurvive because I've already hit myself\nand I can survive so nothing that the\nworld can send me is gonna knock me down\nhmm because I've already done it to\nmyself which world do you think is safer\nthe second\nabsolutely why because there's nothing\nunexpected I already know absolutely so\nthe thing is Jade what you need is\ncourage hmm you need courage to\nentertain the possibility that you could\nlive in the first world right because\nit's scary because you don't know how\npeople are gonna treat you and so if you\nbeat yourself up and you know you can\nsurvive that then you have nothing to\nfear from the rest of the world does\nthat make sense\nit's like fear becomes a non-issue\nbecause you're already doing the worst\nto yourself that can possibly be done\nand so it's like no big deal no big deal\nyou have nothing to worry about you can\ngo out you can be happy some days you\ncan be sad some days but as long as\nyou're beating the [ __ ] out of yourself\nevery day you can enjoy a wonderful\nsandwich or be disappointed but as long\nas you're beating the crap out of\nyourself people can hate you on Twitch\npeople can love you on Twitch you can\ndeal with their criticism because at the\nend of the day nothing they can do is\nworse than what you do to yourself and\nif you can survive what you do to\nyourself you can survive what they're\ngonna do to you mmm what do you think\nabout that Oh sounds like I really have\nto step out of my comfort zone okay so\nso be careful Jade so you took one step\nahead you said what you need to do about\nit I'm not asking what you need to do\nabout it\nno you wouldn't think that's what that I\nneed to do that sort of think about it\nthat yeah I know I know that you think\nof mine that this state is safe but not\ngood necessarily what what do you mean\ndo you think that the why not both are\nreally optimal but say like this but\nmaybe I should that say it like gonna\nfun ways switch it up a little bit sure\nso I think that that makes sense but I\ndon't even want you to talk about what\nyou should do okay so I'm asking so I\npresented to you a possibility of what\ncould be true about your life in the way\nthat you look at yourself\nbefore we figure out whether how to fix\nit what I'd first like to understand\nbecause sometimes I'm wrong about this\n[ __ ] so like does that resonate with you\nlike we can talk about how to fix it\nlater but is that right or like off-base\nsir\nI mean and I don't really say it's right\nor wrong it's just it's good to know\ndoesn't make sense like do you think it\napplies happen mind um I'm the first\nscenario where you're like they doesn't\nagree I hit myself every morning and I\ngo out and there'd everyone sure the\nother one I'm not kind of present sure\nwhat's the other one punching the\npunching and the hugging okay yeah so I\ndon't think you do that the first one I\nthink you do the second one yes I think\nthe second one describes how you view\nyourself and why yeah like it's like it\ngoes back like you you're incredibly\ninvalidating towards yourself yeah no\nit's just the courage part got me that I\nneed to just be more courageous adjust\nlike elite courageous like in general\nlike that's stuck with me for at the\nwhole topic we just had the what courage\nyou just threw out that okay so that\nbothers me a little bit so I'm gonna run\nsomething by Jade I'm really gonna need\nyour help and I'm sorry because this is\nsuper weird hypothetical abstract stuff\nso okay so try to run with me let me see\nif I see if you can follow me and if you\ncan't I apologize because it's it's\ngonna be hard to explain I'm wondering\nif you latched on to the only part that\nis where you're lacking like so I\nbasically said there's one thing that is\nwrong with Jade and that's she needs\nmore courage and that's the one thing\nthat you ran towards does that make\nsense\nyes are you just piggybacking on the\nidea that I picked the one flaw and\nyou're saying yes I can get behind the\nflaw because Jade needs to be better\ndo you see that am i no I see that I see\nthat absolutely right it's weird right\nbecause you're like you're kind of\npiling on to like oh yeah like oh sure\nthere's something wrong with me\nabsolutely I can get behind that that's\nwhat I'm hearing from you in a weird way\nyeah so I don't think that that's\nactually helpful because that's you\nthat's you that's you hitting yourself\nagain because you're saying oh I'm not\ncourageous enough yeah I'm weak\nsometimes I see did are you familiar\nwith like games and like skill trees\nwhere you have like abilities and yes\nyeah and I just saw right now that I\nleveled up of you skill trees and the\ncourage one I didn't it level up enough\nso maybe I went the I tried to level up\nthat one as quick as possible even\nthough I there might be out of school\ntrees I need to level up first that's\nhow I just thought maybe right now like\noh dad my dad needs level up yeah so so\nmy point is that your mind is going to\nlook at whichever skill tree you're the\nworst at in falling into the trap of\nlike me not being so the other way we\ncan think about it is I need courage I'm\ngonna translate that as I'm not good\nenough\ndoes that make sense and so like I think\nthe core part of your identity is the\nbelief that you're not good enough that\nother people deserve to be victims but\nyou don't that other people can afford\nto take a day off if they've been\nsexually assaulted at the age of sixteen\nbut if you do that you're weak hmm so I\nthink you're very quick to pile on to\nany deficiency which I point out to you\nbut I want to be really careful because\nI don't want you to I don't want to let\nyou get away with that\nand that's also why I don't care about\nwhat you want to do to fix it because\nyou're always looking about I don't\nthink you need to fix anything what do\nyou think about that I mean in general I\ndon't think I need necessarily fixing\neither it's more like I'm up improvement\nthat I want like I don't know I feel\nlike I can improve myself what do you\nthink that's wrong with yourself\nanything mmm yeah there are a few things\nbut of course you can\nso this fro randomly out what I can\nimprove or sure procrastinating\nprocrastinating yeah that's okay\nso I was asking like are you sure I can\nthrow it like anything no no I'm glad\nbecause I'm glad you threw that out\nbecause I was trying to get a sense of\nthat whether that's I think that that's\nI agree with you that all that stuff you\ncan improve I don't think that that's\nwhat we're talking about\nwhat are you mean like emotional\nimprovement uh sure I let me just think\ncan I think for a second yes do you have\nquestions for me I mean I always every\ntime you ask me something I want to ask\nit back but I don't know if it's like\nyeah yeah not right now but like in the\nfuture I ask okay I'm glad I'm good\nbecause I wasn't sure if I will touch\nlike you emotional boundaries or I don't\nknow ask away like I don't know good in\nthe future you touch my emotional\nboundaries meaning if you want to ask me\nlike personal questions about myself\nwell when you ask if it personal\nsometimes I feel like what do you feel\nabout like how do you feel about it or\ndo you can you did you ever experience\nif like that that's like why don't when\nI ask back but then I remember that I\ndon't know like ask go for it's it's a\ndifferent go for home hmm I'm trying to\nfigure out whether this is helping you\nor not what do you think this our talk\nyeah um okay helping is a big word I\nthink is a big word it's me somewhat\nclarification about like things I didn't\nknow I needed to focus on like it's\ninteresting to talk about things that\nnever came up to my mind so it's just\nvery educational all of this but yeah\nyeah how do you don't like the ideation\nyou're okay you're completely fine\nfocusing on something but you're really\nnot okay fixing something are you\nuh fixing and I I mean I didn't come\nhere to fix something good maybe that's\nwhy maybe that's why I'm not focus on\nthat right now do you think do you think\nit's okay to need to be fixed yeah it's\nokay\nI don't know necessarily like all\ntogether is okay to fix absolutely but\ndo you think you're allowed to be broken\nyes good I guess I was afraid for a\nmoment that like you were moving away\nfor like it was like the same thing\nwhere you won't let yourself be a victim\nno I think it's okay okay good that\nmakes me think that you aren't broken\nhmm really\nWow so I think the capacity to accept\nthat you could be broken and that it's\nokay to be broken is a sign that you're\nnot broken that's that's actually\ninteresting what's interesting about\nthat that that's when you're broken and\nyou realize you're broken that\ntechnically doesn't mean you that broken\nyep\nthat is good to know really really free\nso what I don't know why it's it's a\ngood feeling\nyeah of course I was are your words\nsomeone else might say something\ncompletely different but like hearing it\nfrom someone else's yeah cool I think we\ncall that acceptance yeah so when I\nthink about someone who's like\nnarcissistic you can sue poor\negotistical like they're broken on the\ninside but they don't let themselves be\nbroken they're like no I'm fine\neverything's okay I'm the best even\nthough they don't feel that way and then\nonce they start to acknowledge oh maybe\nI am a little bit broken and it's okay\nto be broken they can forgive themselves\nfor not being perfect you know they can\nthey can blame themselves a little bit\nless for being weak and therein lies\ntheir strength\nmy brain is taking so much information\nright now I'm sorry I just had like a\nshort AFK moment just thinking yeah I\ntake afk I I the only difference between\nme and you is I tell you I'm going FK\nyeah I should do that too like by the\nway I'm afk yeah let me know when you\nneed to go afk okay alright yeah this\nhow do you feel right now\nlike I feel like I want to know a little\nbit how you feel right now at a moment\nlike talking to me do you like are you\nfeeling neutral or is there like some\nkind of emotion you face I'm glad you\nasked because I was just about to share\nmy feelings good so I was just saying\nthat I feel like the conversation is\nlike we're circling around something and\nwe keep on like touching and moving away\nfrom it like we can't just get our hands\non it that's how I feel okay what do you\nthink yeah that's what I said pretty\nmuch early new conversation that we jump\nand jump and don't come to conclusion so\nyeah yeah come a sating I'm trying to\nI'm trying to grab it but I don't know\nhow to grab it I grabbed what exactly\nlike yeah so that's the problem is I\ndon't know what it is until we grab\ninside but really I tend to share with\nyou what I've what I've understood so\nlike let me let me try to summarize and\nthen you let me know like what you think\nis a worthwhile thing to further explore\nand maybe we can talk more about what\nhypersexuality is or how that works or\nyou know some other simple topic that\nyou're well-versed in so so Jade I I do\nthink that there's something toxic about\nthe way that you look at yourself and I\nthink that that toxicity is protective\nand it kind of goes back to this thing\nthat like I I do think that at the end\nof the day where there are things that\nyou did to put yourself in a bad\nsituation yes sure where did you do\nthings that are stupid sure but I don't\nthink that getting sexually assaulted is\nreally your fault mm-hmm and this is\nsomething I'll just be blunt I don't\nknow if your therapists have told you\nthis before but usually victims of\nsexual\nself sexual-assault blame themselves\nlike that's really common like victims\nof abuse blame themselves like I've\nworked with you know victims of domestic\nviolence who will say like yeah he hit\nme because I didn't like like the food\nthat I served him was burnt it was my\nfault\nright and it's like if you really try to\nargue with them about that like they're\nnot gonna understand but it's [ __ ]\nweird right they're like I did this\ntherefore he did this I am and I think\nwhat it comes down to is control because\nif it's their fault then they're still\nin control and that can feel good but if\nyou are a victim you let go of control\nin your life and you acknowledge that\nthere are people out there that can do\nthings to you that are not your fault\nand that's actually terrifying yeah\nbecause most people would rather live in\na world where like if bad things happen\nto them it's my fault because that's\nlike way more easier to live with it's\nreally hard to live with the idea that\nI'm walking down the street and I get\nhit by a meteor like that's [ __ ] a\nscary world live in so it bothers me a\nlittle bit that you have difficulty\nviewing yourself as a victim and that\nalso if you view yourself as a victim\nyou view yourself as weak like I don't\nthink that that's healthy I don't think\nthat that's fair I think you should\nallow be allowed to be a victim and I\ndon't think that being a victim makes\nyou weak and the crazy thing and now we\nget to like what I really don't like\nabout what you're doing to yourself is\nthis double standard which is you say\nthat it's okay for other people to be\nvictims and it's okay for them to be\nweak but it's not okay for me to be a\nvictim it's not okay for me to be weak I\njust don't think that that's fair to you\nwell it isn't I guess FK just bring it\nout they're good yeah not once did I\nfeel that I actually have a double\nstandard like at all\nthis is completing used to me so I'm a\nlittle bit overwhelmed with that Fahd\nyeah well you can let me know when\nyou're back at the keyboard yeah I'm\nhere I'm trying I'm trying\nyou could take more time KPD sure it's\nmore like I think you should keep the\ncoalition maybe a little bit flowing ok\nsure how I'd sure so then let me ask you\nthis are you kind to yourself before I\nanswer what kind like kind by treating\nmyself nice way going shopping or kind\nlike to me as a person trying to use a\nperson kind to myself no I mean the\nthing is I'm saying no because I'm not\nnot that I do the opposite I just don't\nknow if I ever try to yep it's like it's\ncool it's like I know I'm sorry I I\ndon't mean to I like it I like it thank\nyou so so I sometimes I say that's\nbecause you know our conversation is\nsuper ambiguous so I say that's the\nright answer because it makes it less\nambiguous but I I do think that that's\nimportant to think about right is I\ndon't think you really know how to do\nthat no and and I think this doesn't\neven have to do the sexual trauma I\nthink this started at 8 apparently hmm\nwhat do you think about that\nno I did it before that I mean I don't\nremember for that I wasn't really sad\ndo you remember is so okay now I'm gonna\ntry to teach you something so I'm gonna\nask you a question and I suspect that\nyou may have an answer but that there's\ngonna be a part of your mind that says\nthat that is the wrong answer and\ntherefore you're not gonna want to share\nit mm-hmm okay so prepare yourself did\nsomething happen to you when you were\neight or before you were eight that you\nremember that made you feel sad yeah at\nseven I think No seven no yes okay was\nseven and I was at a verge of turning\neight\nand it happened like the first unkind\ninteraction with humans\nbasically like before that I didn't ever\nhave any negative interaction with\nanyone and that one really got me like\nbadly what happened\nuh I I got beaten up by a bunch of guys\nlike I mean they were like a little bit\nolder than me\nManoj differ children but that was like\nthe first and tough one like I don't\nknow like it usually starts like maybe\npeople who calling you names I didn't\neven start like I would like straight on\nlike beating up and I just remember like\nthat not only dad not only day\nunkindness like it was a not public area\npeople would pass that's like where I\nfirst realized that humans are really\nreally awful and it took quite some time\ntill someone actually stopped them from\nkicking me and beating me and I don't\nknow like that really had a toll on me\nlike changed completely after that what\ndid you learn I learned not to trust\nI learned not to keep my waltz down ever\nalways up I learned that you can only\ncount on yourself because if you count\non others it might never happen or\nhappens too late um so now let me ask\nyou something Jade the person who\nbelieved who counts only on themselves\nif that person gets sexually assaulted\nwhose fault is it\nwell that scenario that person how do\nyou feel yeah hey I do so now I'm gonna\nask you a question when you say you're\npartly to blame and they're partly to\nblame\ndo you really believe that or do you\nbelieve that you're all to blame okay go\nahead\nI I think I feel that both not but I\nmean I'll in my scenario I still think I\nhave some Fault in it in your scenario\ndo you think you have some fault\nmost of the faults are all not\noh there's to be feel like you have all\nthe fault and use the same time that you\nhave some of the fault there's a\ndifference between thinking and feel I I\nthink I do I do like again like I\nmentioned I there were rules and I broke\nthem and I deal with the consequences in\nthe worst possible way that bores\npossibly there's worse but yeah i yeah i\ndid that and i would like to say no\nthank you it's enough yeah good yeah\nit's good that you're honest have\nyourself right yeah so I think it's\ntricky because a part of what we're\ndoing here is\nso I think you're doing really good Jade\nthanks you doing really well as well\nthank you because I think it's hard to\nsay things that we feel to be true even\nwhen we know it doesn't make any sense\nhmm and and everything that I hear from\nyou makes me feel or think let me think\nabout that yeah makes me think that you\nfeel like yeah you feel like everything\nis your fault like you feel in a sense\ncontrol and you feel responsible and I\nthink it's scary to live in your life\nwhere human beings cannot be trusted\nhmm and can't be counted on and so in a\nsense it doesn't surprise me at all that\nyour mind thinks about sexual [ __ ] all\nthe time with people because like that's\nsuch a safe way to think safe in what\nway cuz like sex is just sex there's no\nneed for trust there's no need for\nconnection you know it's like like you\ndon't have to in the basement of your\nmind there's all of this [ __ ] and you\nnever have to go down there if you're\nthinking about sex and I really wanted\nto say something more graphic but then I\nthought that that could be true so I\ndidn't say that I feel you\nright but like you see when like I don't\nI don't think you're hyper sexual\nthinking is gonna go away unless you\nhave other ways of thinking about people\nall right and as long as you in like you\ncan't think about people without\ngrappling with these ideas that like you\nare fundamentally alone in this world\nlike you love your parents and I know\nwhat you know what love means and it's\nclear to me that those connections are\nimportant to you but I do believe that\nthere is a parse part of you there's a\nseven-year-old girl in there\nis still alive and well and feels\nfundamentally alone Oh are we jump you\nto conclusion or is this just like\nstatements I don't know what do you\nthink it is I mean it there's a lot of\nto me it sounds like facts it probably\nis faxed no hypotheses maybe I did okay\nbetter um I didn't know two words in\nEnglish yeah yeah no it's not you gotta\nremember I don't know I met you like an\nhour ago so yes I don't know what I'm\ntalking about\nYeah right no I mean I see truth the\nthings you say not all of it\nI don't like they're a few parts where\nI'm feel like I don't know if that's\nreally good um but I do see yeah yeah\nyou want me to tell you or sure if you\nwant to but let me let me be clear I\ndon't tell you truth you tell us truth\nright you're the one who determines\nwhat's right and what's wrong\nmy job is to generate for you hypotheses\nwhich then you tell us what's right and\nwhat's wrong\nyeah tell Ric as a guide I don't see you\nas a savior but yeah it's you guided\nwell so far okay there's things you said\nthat will stick with me for quite some\ntime which is good we have time we have\nquarantine I have a lot of time to work\non those yeah\noh and general talked about them but\nyeah sous-vide honest my mind I wouldn't\nsay it's blank it's just right now\nthere's too much you think about I\nwouldn't I don't really know what to say\nnow to you yeah good okay so you know\nmaybe this is bad but you know the\nsession doesn't have to have a climax\nokay all right we can just sort of can I\ncan I make sexual jokes or is that\ninappropriate\ngo ahead that's my whole my whole life's\njust you know Jade we can just go limp\nand that's good yeah they got me off\nguard even though I asked for it yeah\nyeah yeah um that's usually how I roll\nwhat what is on your agenda a pod for me\ntoday like am I like the only thing\nyou're gonna stream today or say like\nsomething coming afterwards yeah so I\nactually spend most of my day doing\ndoctoring so I I saw three patients in\nthe morning before stream mm-hmm and\nthen this is all I do like I can't do\nthis for more than two hours because I\nfind it mentally exhausting like it's\ngood but I feel spent at the end you\nknow I I think kind of like yourself\nlike you know I get the sense you have a\nlot in your head and I have lot in my\nhead too so I can't do anything else\nI mean sometimes we'll do things\nafterward but I basically do the\ninterview I scream for about two hours\nand then and then I've got a little bit\nof a break\nso I usually after I scream I try to\nwalk around for a little bit or I'll\nDrive or and I'll just like sort of sit\nand not do anything and just let my\nthoughts do whatever they want to do and\nthen I think today I have two meetings\nafterward I have a meeting with the\nhealthy gamer team about we launched our\ncoaching program yesterday and so\nexciting yeah so we're just gonna check\nin and see how that's going and then I\nhave another meeting about research\nbecause we're trying to study this and\nwe're collaborating we're in the process\nof talking with a couple of universities\nabout collaborating to study what we do\nand see if it like you know get real\nresearchers in here because I'm not a\nreal researcher so we do some research\non our programs to like sort of because\nI'm a scientist sort of but I'm not\nreally a super competent researcher I\ntend to be a better clinician so I'm\nbetter at talking to people than looking\nat statistics and so we have a research\nmeeting because I really want to know I\nwant to collect data and make\nsure that what we're trying to do for\nthe community is actually helping them\nthat's great\nyeah so I've got two meetings and then\nat 5:00 p.m.\neither I'll play with my kids or I'll\nplay video games for about half an hour\nto an hour yes yes\nand then from 6 p.m. on word its family\ntime so you're like all together your\nmind never really stops apart from when\nyou take a walk and maybe play games\nlike apart from those you're like always\nlike when you play a few kids you put or\nare you like blank when you play a few\nkids\nno I I'd say is where I usually get\nabout half an hour of and sometimes\ntired at 8:00 and stuff but yeah good\nokay because right now you just taught\nme so many things they can feel like\nwhen do you rest but it's good that you\nmeditate also you're very good at caring\nfor other people oh thanks um yeah right\nI got you how long have you been talking\nI've lost like it's been all dynamic in\nour yeah how it feels in eternity not\ngood at I like the topics were heavy yep\num but welcome none of them make me\nfundamentally uncomfortable so just a\nFroude out there we'll try better next\ntime no all good I mean I think so far\nfor session yeah yeah I'm glad you feel\nthat way I too feel like it's been heavy\nlike we've been so I called this work\nyes it's like work\nit's like exhausting yeah take a smell a\nmental brainpower but how did you even\nstart like with twitch like was it\nsomething you felt like because of\ngaming you're like hey I could do that\nas well or did someone recommend you\nknow so what happened was like I was\nworking with gamers like so I've been\nworking with gamers for about five or\nsix years and I realized that like I'm\nhaving the same conversations with\npeople like over and over and over again\nthen maybe there are like 35 or 40\nthings that I talk about with gamers and\nso I wonder\nand like what happened is I started to\nget like more popular I started getting\nmore requests for help than I can manage\nmm-hmm and so then I had this crazy idea\nand I was like I wonder if someone\nbecause since I'm having the same 35 or\n40 like core issues with gamers that we\nwork on I wonder if someone if I worked\nwith someone and people could watch it\ncould they benefit from it hmm and\nthat's why we started streaming that's\ngreat that's really nice of you\nI think everyone appreciates your\ncontent cuz I keep to hearing from\npeople on my desk or that they watch you\nand it actually helps hearing and like\nrelating to the issues each streamer has\nor even you have so yeah that's great\nyeah thank you\nit's nice to be appreciated I feel very\nsupported by like us\nI don't know how yes like our people\nyeah so I feel like I'm not doing it\nalone anymore which for what for many\nyears I felt like I was doing it alone\ninstead it bother you not really it I\njust felt like it was insufficient\nbecause what would happen is I get you\nknow calls from like Singapore and Iran\nand you know Palestine and like yeah\nlike Thailand and you're like lots of\nplaces in Europe obviously lots of\nplaces in the US and Canada and people\nwould ask me for help and I was like I\njust can't do that because I would also\nyou know I also have like a job where I\nhave to make money and support my family\nand stuff like that so I was working on\nthat stuff and then I was pretty\nacademically involved at the institution\nthat I trained and things like that so\nyou know I had like all these like like\nI sort of felt like I had my real life\nwhich is like job and family and also\nprofessional ambitions I was pretty\nambitious and worked pretty hard and you\nknow so it was like having a career and\nthen like the gaming stuff was sort of\non the side it was something that I felt\nyou know like I wanted to help these\npeople because I had suffered in the\nsame way you suffered\nyeah oh yeah so you know\nso I started playing video games when I\nwas a kid and then basically failed out\nof college or almost failed out of\ncollege after two years I don't know if\nyou know what a GPA is but like from\nzero to four like for being all A's and\nzero being all laughs I had less than a\n2.0 which means I had less than a C\naverage\nso I basically you know got C's D's and\nF's it took me five years to graduate\nbecause I failed a bunch of classes and\nso it was really struggling and that's\nthe reason I sort of started going\ntowards the monk thing because I was\nfailing out of school and I went to\nIndia and I stayed there for a few\nmonths at an ashram or a monastery and I\ndiscovered yoga and it was amazing and I\nloved it and I decided I was gonna\nbecome a monk\nand I didn't care about school and\nschool was beneath me and all those\npeople who want jobs and careers and\nfamilies like I'm gonna be better than\nthem I'm gonna be deeply spiritual and\nI'm going to rise above all these\nmaterial things and pursue this higher\ngoal which made me better than all the\npeople who lived life better than I did\nbecause I sucked at life and they were\ngood at life and I needed some way to\nfeel better than them hmm\nso that's why I wanted to become a monk\nso bad so fundamentally became a monk\nfor the wrong reasons\nyes I didn't actually become a monk but\nyeah I was trained because right your\nwife and children yes it's not really a\nmonk lifestyle no that's really\ninterested any others video games right\nyou can't own anything that's all I know\nlike yeah well too bad you have like\neverything yeah it's yeah sex to be you\nknow oh yeah that's interesting\nreally really interesting I could listen\nto your story actually [ __ ] what so till\nyou don't have anything to say anymore\nbecause it's really how does it feel to\nask me questions I mean I like it I like\nto get to know at the other side\nit's like an exchange I gave you a lot\nof my information I might as well take a\nview of yours\nyep oh that's good let me can I ask you\njust you know one question about that\nwouldn't be okay so I understand it in\nexchange and I'm with that a hundred\npercent mm-hmm would you feel okay if I\nhelped you and you didn't give me\nanything in return\nyes okay good I'm happy to it's just no\nright now I guess iteration I'd like to\nget to know more about uterus so we've\ngot so I've got about 15 minutes right\nand so one thing is sometimes I teach\npeople to meditate and if you're\ninterested I can teach you how to\nmeditate or if you prefer you can ask\nquestions and I love to talk about\nmyself cuz I'm I used to do a lot of she\ngone okay good Nick she going sorry good\nfits yeah I might get back to that I\njust stopped doing it since I came back\nto Germany but now hearing that again\nmakes me really want to go back see dad\nyeah don't you feel like the chi-gong\nhelped you um I think the reason that\nstopped me was my Shifu for it not\nhelping me I think if it's just me and\nmy thoughts and let's say well that I\nhad a Shifu amah Master Shifu and I\nthink sometimes his words he said well\nwe would do the chi gong stop me from\nrelaxing cuz he would see it say things\nthat didn't sit well with me so I wasn't\nreally in my space it wasn't peace but\nnow that I'm alone I want to try that\nagain what would he say that wouldn't\nsit well he would say things like this\nis sip example like you should stop\nlistening to music you should take the\nworld and realize what's going around\nyou and I was like but I like being in\nmy music space I mean I understand what\nhe means but the demo was like hmm I\ndon't want to hear that no oh oh dude I\nmean I kind of want to know what do you\nmean oh here's the problem with Shi Fu's\nokay yes and gurus is so like every now\nand then there's like an enlightened\nmaster and they really understand\nsomething and then they teach their\ndisciples and then the problem is that\ntheir disciples because\nthe master knows what the disciple needs\nthey tailor their teachings to a\nparticular disciple the problem is that\nonce the disciple grows up and then sort\nof becomes a master may not be a truly\nenlightened master but in the tradition\nhe like gets promoted and then he starts\nteaching the problem is that the\nteachings that he offers other people\nare the teachings that his master gave\nhim which he believes are the true\nteachings because they worked for him\nbut they're not true they just worked\nfor him and then they try to tell people\nto like not listen to music yeah that's\nso that was his path but it's not your\npath hmm and and that's I see this a lot\nso I have strong feelings about it\nbecause I think that you know a good\nteacher doesn't teaches you in the way\nthat you need to here not in the way\nthat they were taught mm-hmm yeah I\nagree that's like so I thought she would\nbut stop me from fully submitting good\nyeah thank God yes I am to me as I was a\nlittle bit biased because he's like the\nhe did the choreographs for eight months\nmovies and was like oh my god that's so\nawesome I want to be with him I wouldn't\nbe close to him so it could be close to\nthat pop culture yes I was a little bit\nof a groupie to be honest yeah so that's\nalso you know the wrong reason and if\nyou're not careful there's a lot of\nsexual misconduct and those kinds of\nrelationships - uh-huh\nI don't think about that ya know I mean\nit's I know a lot of people don't but\nit's like it's a big problem all right\nyeah okay huh yeah well the more you\nknow but it's you can't see so you said\nwe have like 10 minutes left do you need\nto use that do you need to say something\nor no no we can also go a little bit\nover if you want to I don't mean to like\njust you know that's what I was kind of\nthinking about doing but if you have\nquestions I'm happy to answer no no I\njust I'm just just in case I wanted to\ncheck if there's something that someone\nyou mind that you really want to throw\nit now so no it's very good no\nmain things so it sounds like you have a\nmeditative practice so I think that\nthat's great you want to just tell\npeople what Qigong is do because people\nmight not now oh I don't really know\nmyself to be honest sounds really oh\nright now\nsure like I actually have to sit on the\nfloor and like that's not it's like a\nreally personal space I don't think I\ncould I mean I could try to do it on\nstreem some one day know if it's like\nvery no don't don't share it if it's a\npersonal practice okay sorry but you can\ngoogle Qigong you can listen tell us\nabout it\nokay it's again it's basically a type of\nmeditation which is connected to might\nnot be connected to again my Shifu set\nthose swings but I actually never\nresearched them so if I say something\nplease say stop that's not true so\nbasically he did Wing Chun and he\nconnected Qigong tubing Chun Wing Chun\nis a martial art right yes and we would\ndo it every time before we would start\nclass we would do that to free our minds\nand we do it afterwards for free our\nminds especially it just to be one of\nyourself and to be one with the one next\nto you because it was like a group and\nit's just about like being usually with\ndo it outdoors and it's like about being\nconnected to nature and just let you\nmind flow it which is a little bit hard\nwhen you're Shifu keeps talking so I\nsuggest just to listen to music or no\nmusic at all just the nature sounds and\nyeah so my understanding of Qi Gong is\nthat like so there are two practices\nthat are rooted in Indian and Chinese\nculture so I I tend to focus on\nTai Chi or Tai Chi yeah and and so Tai\nChi is like kind of equivalent to what\nis what common people think of as yoga\nright which is Foster's so there's a\nphysical practice which is a mind-body\npractice which in according to\nscientific studies outperforms exercise\nin terms of it's like healing capability\nand its effect on depression and anxiety\nand stuff like that so yoga and Tai Chi\nare sort of equivalent and then yoga and\nTai Chi or or\nyoung have paired practices that are\nusually focused around the breath which\nare brown I am and Qi Gong\nso Branagh and Qi both mean the same\nthing they mean life energy so what\ntheir their practices that are actually\naimed at cultivating strengthening in\nfacilitating the flow of your life\nenergy or Qi yeah so yoga and Tai Chi\nare like more physical practices Qi Gong\nis a more energetic practice so I think\nabout it almost like in the realm of\nenergy healing and then our brawn I am\nand then\nmeditation is actually even different\nbeyond that but that's that's how I sort\nof conceptualize it what is meditation\nlike you said it's beyond that like what\nso the first thing is that meditation\ngets translated with two words that are\ninto English and one is a verb and one\nis a state of mind so that oftentimes\nconfuses people\nso meditation is something the state of\nmind a meditation is something that\nhappens to you it's not something that\nyou do you can't meditate so Dionne is a\nstate of mind that happens to a person\nwhen they are in a particular like\ncircumstance so you can cultivate it and\nthen da da na is a focusing practice\nthat's a verb so when I say I sit down\nand I meditate on let's say you know\nlike a candle that's a verb I can sit\nand I can stare at a candle for like 20\nminutes and then if I'm lucky I enter a\nparticular state of mind while I'm\nstaring at the candle so the the realist\nthe truest form of meditation is not\neven a verb it's not something that you\ncan do it's something that happens to\nyou it's a state it's not an action and\nso in Qi Gong you may enter states of\nmind of meditation I don't know let me\nthink if I know what the Chinese word\nfor that is I think they actually used\nthis they use the Sun script or Pali I\nnever really got into meditation\nI always connect a method\nmaybe so Google was translating it as\nSean's own but I don't I'm not familiar\nwith that but I like how your voice\nchanged as soon as you said it cuz it's\na foreign awards it kind of went a\nlittle bit different that's because I\nused the my tone a pretty exaggerated\nbut that's his best decision although\nit's been a while since you know I'm\nrusty my Chinese is rusty but oh you\nused to speak Chinese or yeah just sort\nof how many Legos do you speak I mean at\nvarious times of my life up to six let\nme think about that\noh yeah but like not too well Donald's\nokay but still impressive\nso wait you're native English or yeah so\nI'm not bilingual and then studied\nSpanish through high school in college\nand there's actually really hilarious\nclip of me miss speaking Spanish oh and\nthen I also studied Mandarin and\nJapanese because I was a weeb yeah and\nthen learned Hindi which is another\nIndian language sort of along the way\nright and I say all of them poorly now\nwhat would do you speak of language or\nwhat guys who speak German or yeah to be\nhonest I didn't really grow up bilingual\nbecause my dad who's Asian Vietnamese he\ngrew up German so the country would help\nme like I'd never learned it\nunfortunately it's just English and\nGerman and way aboot Japanese and\ndoesn't go beyond that we do is that is\nthat what how it's pronounced that's how\nI print out like weep weeaboo it's like\nway past the short-form has no family\nis we boys we both always say weeaboo\nmaybe I am bronze no I know we abou\nsounds far more cultured and far more\nJapanese than Weibo which sounds like\nTexan did y'all see those we bows down\nthere\nyou've got to be really careful there's\na we boys in the backyard they've got\ntheir wife who's with him oh you got\nthat excellent of course oh yeah you\ngrew up there right I heard a little bit\nabout your black lives matter talk\nbefore the stream that you said you grew\nup there and you got a lot of negative\ntreatment due to you\nI love Texas though I don't want to give\npeople the wrong impression\nno I mean oh with racism and there was\nactually I mean it's terrible but that\nwhen I was growing up there was actually\na black man who was lynched in a in the\ntown next to where I lived it was\nterrible and it was lynched yeah like I\ndon't think people have understood so\nyou know I think a lot of people talk\nabout I mean obviously people talk about\nblack lives matter but I don't think the\ncommon American understands how bad\nracism has been for how long of a time\nmm-hmm like there were there were\nliterally like when I was growing up I\nmay have been like seven or eight years\nold there were a group of people that\ntook a black man and tied him behind a\ntruck and drove until he died in that\n[ __ ] happening back in like the late 80s\nand 90s and it's cold are you I'm 37 huh\noh wow I mean yeah I can make sense I\nmean all the experience you talked about\nyeah okay cuz I figured like super first\nlaw agrees I said like as I said I\nforget like beginning of Ferdie but that\nis no okay I'm just my maturity is\naround 30 um I'm a few years behind no\nit's that's fine I think I mean yeah\nwow that that's actually that's that's\ntough because in Germany let's say like\nthis I only had like one racist\nexperience and the rest wrote my life\nthat was pretty good but I've never\nreally seen actively racism in Germany\nlike you did mm-hmm that's a I mean they\nI'm pretty sure we have racism in\nGermany 100% it's just I I haven't seen\nit Nick that yeah I think\nyou know the other interesting thing is\nthat like I think people underestimate\nhow much racism there is in the rest of\nthe world\nAsians are awful yeah like so in India\nlike so I think America gets a bad rap\nfor being a super racist country I think\nand in a sense we are but like I think\nthe big difference between you know part\nsome of my experiences in India and and\nexperiences here in the u.s. is that\nlike at least in the u.s. in the u.s.\nlike there's a fair number of people who\nacknowledge that racism is a problem and\nsure there are plenty of people who\ndon't think it's a big deal but in India\nit's just so commonplace that it's like\ncompletely accepted no one thinks that\nit's a problem there hmm and it's like I\nhad so I was visiting a family member of\nmine back in 2006 and then she was\nasking me just you know about like you\nknow what was i up to and I was living\nin a frat house in college at that time\nas I told them yeah you know I've these\nroommates just like all like tell me\nabout your friends and I was like yeah\nyou know I have a friend and he's a he's\nlike a 7-foot tall black dude and we\nwatch anime together and she was like\nshocked and she was like aren't you\nafraid he's gonna steal your stuff I was\nlike no she's like oh my god he's black\nand she was like and like the thing is\nlike in India like people haven't seen a\nblack person it's just like in Asia it's\nlike still how strong the black and\nwhite difference it's like when they see\nwhite people like oh my god yes white\npeople when I see black people they're\nlike looking very judgy instead it's\nawful\nI see like the gazes people of color get\nyeah in Asia it's even they own people\nlike if you're an Asian person and\nyou're like in the darker than the rest\nyou being discriminated for that as well\neven though you're Asian yeah so this is\nkind of cool I mean and no we're talking\nabout but so we do this with our our\nproducer so he's this guy named Moses\nand Moses is going to do what wait is it\nthe mclovin guy yes\nso so Moses so we're gonna do something\ncalled put together a bio-data mm-hmm\nwhat I'm confused about what anyway okay\njust gonna wait wait I was confused\nabout your reaction oh and I saw a clip\nof yours and I'm not sure if it's him\nbut it was someone of here who was on\nthe stream looks like mclovin from super\nbed yeah hi girly so Moses what we're\ngonna do is this is one of our stretch\ngoals for our fundraiser but we were\ngonna get Moses to go on a virtual date\nand then we're gonna we're gonna comment\nin the background and and we Moses and I\nwere talking about I've actually done\nthis before where you know I used to be\npretty good at talking to women so like\nwhat I would do like back when I was in\ncollege is I would take my friends who\nare like you know text chatting on AOL\nInstant Messenger with girls and I would\nflirt with the girls for them so that\nthey can go on a date and and so we were\nMoses and I were talking about you know\nwhether I actually want to be like\ncoaching during the day you tell them\nwhat to say or if we should just comment\nwith twitch chat no do it\ndo you like the excellent commentating\nthat's that's fun commentating or\ntelling him what to say think that both\nlike I think the comment is also fun but\nI think actually telling me what to say\nwhen he's like looking lost it's kind of\nfun no but I mean I I think it anyway so\nwe were just joking about that the\nreason I brought up Moses is because\nactually so what we're gonna do so the\nway we got to this is that in Indian\nculture we have like arranged marriages\nin the way that you find a candidate for\nan arranged marriage is something called\na bio-data so it's like a resume but\nabout like like it actually so bio-datas\nhave existed long before online dating\nprofiles and it's basically an online\ndating profile that people in India have\nbeen doing for thousands of years so\nthey like create a profile for a person\nit used to be like physical pieces of\npaper that would get faxed across the\nworld and and part of the what they\nwould put on the bio-data is how dark or\nlight your skin is right and so it was\nlike they would ask you you know\nslurring my sister that's okay okay so\nplease continue\nhow old is she she is dank free this\nyeah oh that's so cool\nI happen to Emma was three year old out\nthere then there's another one actually\nwell how is how old is she\nand the older one yeah she is seven okay\nhi ever I have an almost three year old\nand an almost five-year-old weight both\nboth boys girls girls oh my god I\nwouldn't exhausting now I think in my\ncase I still could be up a ceramic\nexhaust of girls I want boys like that's\nmy goal like being a mom and having like\nboys and maybe one girl I think cuz I\nhave follows sister so it's that's why I\nsay it's exhausting maybe if it's just -\nI don't know\nI think Parenthood in general is\nexhausting but I find that user\nI mean so like I took my two year old\nGod they are the oldest is five the real\ntrouble starts at the age of ten eleven\nthat's what I mean\nyes right now they are really nice like\nthat ace you have read that ODEs it's\ngreat so I took my to do you know wall\nMarta's mm-hmm okay so I like what my\ntwo-year-old was like to maybe like two\nin half so she needed a new pair of\nshoes and I don't really know anything\nabout fashion or clothing or art or\ndecoration or any of that stuff and I\nmean you can see my room and this is how\nI would leave but if it was my choice my\nlipstick yeah and so I took my two year\nold to Walmart one day because she\nneeded a new pair of shoes and like we\nwere in Texas so we went to Walmart\nbecause that's what you do when you're\nin Texas and then you know we like\nlooked at a wall of shoes and then like\nI tried to get her I tried a couple on\nand she didn't like them and then I was\nlike because she's - right so two year\nold it's like like stuff and so then I\nended up asking I was like which one do\nyou want again she's like I don't want\nto me I was like you don't want shoes\nand she's like no and then left\nempty-handed and then my wife was like\nwhat\nyou know why don't you she needs shoes\nand I was like she didn't want any of\nthem I thought it was great\nshe's 2 years old and she already like\nknows what she wants and does I don't\nhave to learn that [ __ ] she kind of\ntakes care of ourselves it's pretty cool\nyeah that's what I mean like at that age\nthey're pretty straightforward what they\nwant in their life and what they don't\nthat's why I said like the age of 10\nturn 10 periods maybe depending on hold\nor like in general puberty hits\ndefinitely 11 L 11 12 I think even 10\nmost girls and that's a really difficult\ntime like my oldest sister she's not 14\njust one year ago she was they went for\nthree years which was unbearable to be\nhonest like it was tough I was even when\nI was really really bad at that age I\nwas like you considered an angel before\nit had turned like the time and then it\njust went downhill\nbut yeah yes I've heard of saying girls\nyeah I just meant that yours unsink\nyeah yeah about that I don't know if\nthat's like scientifically true or not\nno but girls like to say like oh we\ndon't sing that's why we're both in the\nbad mood we always say things like then\nyeah that's you know we'll see I'll get\nI'll get back to you but walk again in\nten years five to six years if I need\nadvice you can I got you I got enough to\nokay yeah so you're so you've got your\nfour four sisters yeah I'm the oldest of\nmyth me five Oh with you five yeah I'll\ngo all girls cool the men we're not\nstrong enough in my family I guess not\nyeah it's weird my my wife also so my\nwife has two sisters mm-hmm so it's\nthree girls and then so far she and her\nsister one of her sisters has kids so so\nfar their generation has produced three\ngirls uh-huh so like it's her and two\nsisters no boys and then so far all of\ntheir kids have been girl\noh thank you genetic like predisposition\ntowards breeding tourism that's\ninteresting cuz my my dad it's like okay\nof course he's a boy so it doesn't come\nbut he's like one of the only ones and\nthe rest are all sisters and they\nchildren are all girls except for one\nboy so it's like just my dad one boy and\nthe rest all girls there may be some\nkind of genetics like something about\nthe way that the egg develops or even\nthe spirit like there may be some kind\nof I mean it could just be coincidence\nbecause you know across the world there\ngonna be millions of people who only\nhave girls right millions of people\nwhose girls only have girls just\nstatistically but sometimes it makes me\nwonder now the more interesting thing is\nthat both my wife and her younger sister\nare married to psychiatrists no way\nthere's a there's an interesting\nquestion about whether her youngest\nsister will also marry a psychiatrist\noh yeah that's actually whoa what I mean\nat this point it's a really a\ncoincidence or it's just like a mistake\nin them this is a bug query unclear oh\nthat's interesting\nholy crap yeah I hope I have boys I hope\nI break the circuit and for out some\nboys yeah cool well you know yeah very\ncool good luck with that you know I\nwould imagine that it's gonna be a\ncouple of years before you go down that\nroad but I mean in my family we all have\nfor every early children mmm and I've\nalready said to myself if everything\ngoes well like financially and like my\nme bit because I always said like I\nwon't have children till I know I can\nfeed myself feeds to human beings and\njust in case if something goes wrong\nhelp my siblings it's like I need to\nhave that amount in order to say okay\nnow I can have children and I hope it's\nlike in the next 10 years yeah and yeah\nthat'd be great\nwell thanks cat yeah really don't ya\nknow yeah I think I think it can be good\nto talk about light things and laugh\nafter we talk about heavy things\nagreed yeah yeah it's like\nafter a night of drinking just having a\nnice soup in the cup of tea that's how I\nsee it yeah yeah absolutely I haven't\ndone an item actually I had the most\nalcohol I've had in a long time after\nduring one of our in one of our streams\nin May I feel you\nit streams and alcohol is just it's it's\ndangerous what's funny\nIvan yeah yeah I definitely find us why\nit's dangerous because I want to do it\nall the time and yeah yeah it's hope so\nJane this has been fun great yeah I was\nI think I unfortunately do have to kind\nof get going but yep I know if there's\nanything else that we can do to help you\nor support you I'd love I'd love to hear\nwhat you think about we've talked about\ntoday and and you know you know down the\nroad like like think about it and see\nwhat works for you and concretely one\nthing I would suggest is that you really\ndo pay attention to the way that you\ntreat yourself mm-hmm and and really\nthink about whether you can cut yourself\na little bit of slack and whether it's\nokay for you to not be perfect and\neventually for you to trust other human\nbeings I try yes they don't make it easy\nthey really don't this has been great I\nam pleasantly surprised because I really\nwas the freight as I think so far we\nalso said things right nothing could be\nclipped they could have been like out of\ncontext like so I think we say from that\nside as well maybe though we'll limp\nlimp joke don't underestimate what\ntwitch chat is capable of all right I\nthink I think one of the worst things\nthat you could possibly say is that we\ndidn't say anything that could be\nclipped because now well god damn it yes\ncareful don't tempt them\nsorry chats they're like temperamental\nJohn's it's like as long as I respect\nthem they'll respect you but if you you\nknow if you say that Zeus doesn't can't\ndo [ __ ] to you then he's gonna strike\nyou as a lightning bolt and teach you\notherwise\nwell can we rewind is there like no but\nyeah this has been fun yeah thank you\nfor having\nme thank you thank you for coming and\nthank you for you know sharing and being\nhonest and authentic and and funny and\nentertaining and all that good stuff\nmy Beckett's you and you know good luck\nseriously I mean that and if there's\nsome way we can support you down the\nroad or if you want to come back on\nstream at some point let us know\nstay safe obviously and and we I really\ndo hope you can start progressing again\nyeah that would be it would be great I\njust let first think and everything we\ntalked about and then we see further\nyeah take care of Jake all right you too\nbye okay\nall righty guys so thank you guys very\nmuch for coming and yeah so Jane is fun\nyeah it's a lot of fun she's awesome and\nI don't know if you guys saw what I was\nseeing like I try to point it out to her\nmy hope is that y'all were able to catch\nmore of what I was trying to say then\nmaybe I could explain which I think\ngenerally speaking twitches good at like\nI think you guys I don't know if you\nguys caught the subtlety of her self\njudgment the subtlety of her like how\nshe's an island right so I think that's\nthe tricky thing is that like she views\nherself as an island which is\nunderstandable because when you view\nyourself as an island you don't connect\nto other human beings it's safe and and\nyou don't have to be hurt and yeah let\nme just think about what else want to\nsay about that yeah you know I think at\nsome point we could talk about this sort\nof hyper sexual thinking and try to\nunderstand that a little bit better if\nalmost from a meditative aspect like\nwhat's going on in terms of your mind\nand how does it function and all that\nkind of good stuff\nWow thanks for the you know bazillion\nsubs Paxton Lancaster dodged easy dodged\nthanks man\nthanks for the support bro I assume\nyou're a dude because your name is\nPaxton but you never know so yeah you\nknow we can definitely explore that more\nand try to understand the nature of the\norigin of the sexual thoughts and dig\ninto the trauma and stuff like that but\nmy my my initial instinct is that like I\ntold her is that I think that you know\nthoughts in your mind tend to serve a\nparticular purpose even if it's not a\nhealthy one like they're there for a\nreason and I wonder if just the sexual\nhyper sexual thinking gives her a way to\nthink about other people where she\ndoesn't have to think about them in\nanother way like it frees her from like\nconnecting and relating and like having\nto trust people and oddly enough I think\nwhat's incredibly traumatic about her\nbeing beat up by a bunch of like when\nshe was seven years old\nit's it's subtle but it's it's not just\nthat she was attacked by kids\nit's that adult stood by and did nothing\nand if you think about like feeling\nisolated and hopeless and losing faith\nin humanity it's being a child and\nhaving adults watch as you get hurt and\nand that's really devastating and I see\nthis a lot in terms of it's it's weird I\ndon't know how to say this but when I\nwork with people who grew up with\npatients who like you know have PTSD\nfrom like abusive households\noddly enough it's not the abusive parent\nthat causes them to lose faith in\nhumanity it's the parent who couldn't\nstop or didn't try to stop the abusive\nparent that's what really [ __ ] them in\nterms of like you know damaging and and\nto have a parent watch violet because\nyou know that your abusive parent is\nsort of a bad parent but it's like the\nother parent who loves you and like\nliterally will you know wipe the blood\noff of your forehead and put a bandage\non\nit's that parent standing by while you\nget beat that can be like incredibly\ndevastating and I mean that overall you\nknow all that [ __ ] is sad but you know\nso we can we can think a little bit I\nreally do hope that Jade starts to treat\nherself better and I'm sure she maybe\nshe's gonna watch this but then I I\nthink the the reason that that really\nbecomes important is because you know if\nyou it sounds like she wants to be a mom\none day and I'm sure she's gonna be a\nfantastic mom but one of the best gifts\nshe can give to her children is knowing\nhow to love herself because they're\ngoing to learn they're gonna learn from\nthe way that she treats them but they're\nalso gonna learn from the way that she\ntreats herself so I really hope she gets\nthere because I think she's gonna be an\nawesome mom and yeah so don't forget\nthat\ndon't forget that you deserve or you\nshould even if you care about other\npeople more than yourself that don't\nunderestimate the power of an impact of\nthe impact that you can make by being\nhealthy and caring about yourself\nbecause you can help so much people by\njust doing that you know yeah it's it's\nit's really amazing what how you can\ninfluence someone's life without without\nreally realizing it and I've seen all\nkinds of profound impacts in my own life\nand in other people's lives from you\nknow is something as simple as holding\nthe door or helping someone you know\nlike who's moving on the street like if\nyou just help them take a box up it's\nlike night and day and so and so you\nreally do deserve to treat yourself\nbetter and and think about yourself in a\nhealthy way and don't underestimate the\nimpact that you'll have on other people\nwhen you start loving yourself yeah so\nthank you guys very much for supporting\nwhat we do here I'm all up Kanodia I'm a\npsychiatrist but really here I'm just\nhere as a person and our coaching\nprogram launched yesterday and hopefully\nit's working well I'll find out in about\nan hour whether people are able to sign\nup and actually like get connected and\nall that kind of stuff because if we\nvote those stuff with like just a lot of\nbrilliant people from our community with\nvery limited resources and thank you\nguys for all of the support because now\nwe have more resources and we want to do\nbetter for you guys because the system\nright now doesn't do enough and so you\nknow that we can rage at the system all\nwe want to but it's been always been my\nbelief that you know Mahatma Gandhi sort\nof used these words and that's be the\nchange that you want to see in the world\nand so that's what we're here to do\nwe're here to you know tackle what we\ncan as individuals and I guess as a\ngroup but really I just show up and I\ntry to do the best that I can and don't\nunderestimate the power of what you're\ncapable of if you just show up and try\nto do the best that you can and no\namount of shame or being a piece of [ __ ]\nor a fan\nin life will ever take away the power\nthat you bring to the table when you\nshow up and you do the best that you can\nand I think a lot of people across\nAmerica are doing that right now and I\nthink that that counts for a lot\nso yeah Gandhi wasn't perfect\nyeah I know Gandhi's flaws so I'll say\none last thing about Gandhi I think that\njust because a person wasn't good\ndoesn't mean that you can't learn from\nthem and I try to look for knowledge\nwherever I can find it and yeah\nit's a pet oh I don't think he was a pet\nof dad I haven't heard he was incredibly\nracist\nso that pet you know but anyway oh yeah\nare studying DLC do we have time for\nthat"
