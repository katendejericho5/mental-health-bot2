    "transcript": "so the first thing that we've got to\nfigure out is like why do people lie and\nif we want to understand when people are\nlying we have to start by figuring out\nwhy do people lie so what is lying about\nso sometimes you know people say lying\nis about protection because you're you\nknow you're trying to protect yourself\nfrom a particular consequence and that's\nfair I think but in my opinion lying is\nreally about one thing and that's about\ncontrol so what any time someone tells a\nlie they're actually trying to control\nthe behavior of another human being\nright so let's just think about this if\nI if someone asks me oh did you steal\ncandy from the candy jar and then like I\ncan say yes and then the human being\nwill react a certain way or I can say no\nand they'll react a different way so if\nwe think about why do I lie it's to\nchange the reaction of another human\nbeing and literally what it is it's\nabout controlling\nanother human being okay this is why\npeople lie it's all about control and\neven when we lie to ourselves that too\nis about control because we're trying to\nprotect ourselves or control a\nparticular opinion that we have about\nourselves and we can maybe get into that\nlater if you guys want to but the first\nthing that you guys have to understand\nis that lying is about control and what\nwe're trying to do is control the\nactions of another human being so then\nwe have to think a little bit about you\nknow how do we know if someone is going\nto lie and so that a couple of things\nthat we have to think about one is you\nknow what's at stake so\nconsequences\nyou\nand then secondly what is this person's\nthreshold for dealing with consequences\nis\nyou\nyou\nand this is for consequences okay so\nthese are actually I think the most\nimportant things right here because if\nyou can understand these two pieces why\nisn't this capturing\nyou guys see this we'll see if we can\nget this running again but I can just\ntell you guys so basically well let's\njust think about lying right so people\nlie to control consequences and if you\nthink about it like you know you're\nlying to create a particular outcome\nso the questions that you need to ask\nyourself when you're trying to tell if\nsomebody is lying is first of all what's\nthe consequence if they lie and the\nhigher the consequences the more that\nthey're they need to control your\nbehavior because that's really what it's\nabout right it's about them saying words\nthat control your reaction and so you\nneed to stop thinking about you know\ndoes this person is you know what's the\npercentage chances of telling the truth\nis a true untrue forget all about all\nthat the question that you need to ask\nyourself is does this person have a\nvested interest in controlling my\nbehavior and if they have a vested\ninterest in controlling your behavior\nthey are far more likely apply the\nsecond thing to understand about the\nperson is how comfortable are they with\nthe consequences of their actions so\nsome people and we can kind of think\nabout this a little bit like integrity\nbut you know some people are comfortable\nwith the consequences of their actions\nlike if they you know if they [ __ ] up\nand they're okay with standing being\n[ __ ] up like they're okay like telling\nother people like you know yeah I made a\nmistake if you want to fire me go ahead\nand fire me it's not that big of a deal\nlike I understand I deserve to be fired\ngo ahead and fire me and then other\npeople are paranoid about getting fired\nso some people are more comfortable\naccepting the consequences of their\nactions and other people are like less\ncomfortable accepting the consequences\nof their actions and so if someone if\nsomeone is demonstrated to you that\nthey're comfortable accepting the\nconsequences of their actions and we can\ncall that integrity but I think like\nintegrity is like hard to measure so\nit's like literally what does this\nperson when they make mistakes do they\nactually own up to them and do they\naccept the consequences of their\nmistakes or do they not and so if\nsomeone accepts the consequences of\ntheir actions\nthen you know they're less likely to lie\nbecause in a sense they've got thicker\nskin so if I'm willing to get hit or get\nhurt or get you know yelled at by\nsomeone else I don't need to control\nthem because the consequence of them\nyelling at me is something that I can\nwithstand so in a sense like the more\npeople can withstand the consequences of\nactions the less likely they are to lie\nand the less likely that they are to\ncontrol you because they don't need to\ncontrol you because it doesn't you know\nthey can survive if you get mad at them\nand so there's nothing about like so I\nthink these are really basically the two\nthings which is you know what it does\ndoes this person need to control me with\ntheir words like that's the question\nthat you need to ask yourself right so\nI'll give you guys a couple of examples\nso I work with people who have addiction\nproblems right so they've frequently\nlied and even though they're good people\nand they try to live honest lives and\nall that kind of stuff like they're not\nliars there aren't like liars and not\nLiars right that's kind of a big problem\nis that people think about people like\nsome people have integrity and other\npeople don't have integrity and some\npeople are liars and and not liars\nso the issue is all about consequences\nso like if I have someone who you know\nis addicted to opiates and has ADHD we\njust have to think a little bit about\nlike okay like does this person need to\nlie to me about what they're using in\norder to continue to get adderall out of\nme and if the answer is yes then oddly\nenough I sort of presume that they're\nlying until I get concrete evidence that\nthey're not right so it's like they're\ngonna lie to get what they need out me\nso then the issue is how do you work\nwith someone who has an opiate problem\nand needs at all so I can try to like\ncontrol them in return but really what I\nwant to do is create a safe space right\nand this is why I really need to be able\nto draw this [ __ ] because this is hard\nto explain\nyou\nokay try this again\nokay work say so now I want to show you\nguys something okay\nokay oh god I miss painted so much worse\nso\nso people lie because the consequence is\nhigh right so high consequence\nis going to increase the chance of lying\nright and then low consequence\nis going to decrease once I saved yo\nwhat's up what's going on III thought ID\nchange change changed saved this is\nright right yeah this is good meet\nyourself meet yourself kid\nokay alright so this is working right\nsay it okay so so the question is if we\nwant to control like if we want to catch\npeople in lying if they have a high\nconsequence then they're going to lie\nand if they have a low consequence then\nthey're going to tell the truth\nokay so the question is like then the\nother thing here is that you know the\nmore the more tough or more resilient\nthey are against consequences the less\nlikely they are to lie so the question\nis if you're dealing with someone who\nmay be lying how do you move from here\nto here right so how can you is the\nperson who someone may be lying to go\nfrom a high consequence place to a low\nconsequence place and this is safety\nokay so if you're trying to get someone\nto not lie to you what you have to do is\nmake it safe for them to tell you the\ntruth and this is really really tricky\nright because when you make it safe for\nthem to tell the truth you're lowering\nthe consequence of their line which in\nturn means that they don't need to lie\nto you anymore so I'll tell I'll give\nyou guys an example so I'll tell someone\nI'll be like hey man so like I know that\nyou need adderall for me and you know\nI'm concerned that you're using opiates\nagain because you know you've been like\ncanceling appointments and things like\nthat and like I know that a lot of times\npeople who slip up with their opiates\nprescribers sort of say like I'm not\ngonna prescribe you any controlled\nsubstances but that's not true I mean\nyou have a diagnosis of ADHD and if you\nneed your adderall that's okay but we\ngot to figure out like you got to\nunderstand just think about this for a\nsecond it's not like I'm never gonna\nprescribe you at all again it's just I\ndon't want to keep on prescribing you\nadderall\nif you're using opiates because the\nwhole purpose of the adderall is so that\nyou can work well right like that's why\nwe give you the medication so that you\ncan do a good job and if you're using\nagain like you're not going to be doing\na good job so it's kind of like you're\nmissing the point man I'm like they're\nnot interested in punishing you and\ntaking away you're at all what I'm\ninterested in doing is like the Averell\nis there for a particular goal and I'm\nafraid that you're not meeting that goal\nthat has nothing duty at all it's\nbecause you're [ __ ] using again so\nlike we got to fix that man and when you\nsay something like that and you kind of\nlet them know you know like it's not\nlike I'm just just gonna take away your\nat all I may stop prescribing it and\nsometimes I'll even tell them I'll be\nlike I'm not comfortable prescribing you\na dural you know unless I'm like assured\nthat you're kind of doing okay with the\nOh pious and the interesting thing is\nthat when I say something like that I'm\nactually creating the consequence that\nthey don't want without them even saying\nanything like I'm taking I'm like\nthreatening to sort of take the outer\nall away and so oddly enough it's sort\nof like you know if using\nadderall okay and if not using so I'm\ngoing to just change colors here inside\nright so basically what I'm doing is I'm\nsaying that it doesn't matter what\nyou're doing because the consequences\ncan be the same if I'm worried about you\nI'm going to stop prescribing alcohol so\nthe point here is that we're not\nchanging which we're changing we're\ndecreasing our consequences because if\nI'm not gonna prescribe adderall anyway\nthen like he doesn't need the light\nright where she does this make sense\nI need a kind of check in with chat for\na second you guys following this okay so\nlike this is exactly what I'm saying is\nthat if you want to understand lying\nyou've just got to think about\nconsequences and think about like under\nwhat circumstances would this person lie\ndoes this person need to control me and\nif you want to get the truth out of\nsomeone you've got to just think about\nokay how can I create a safe space for\nthem to tell me the truth or how do i\nimpose the consequence even without them\nlike lying and the funny thing this is\nthe cool thing is that when you do that\nthen people just tell you the truth\nbecause they're like you know [ __ ] it if\nyou're not gonna prescribe the adderall\nlike like I'm using opiates like please\ndon't stop prescribing at all I really\nam using opiates like that's actually\nwhat they say like they come clean then\nin there when you're like yeah man I\ndon't know what's going on it just seems\nlike you're not able to keep your [ __ ]\ntogether\nI'm not sure like I know you say you're\nnot using anymore but I just don't feel\ncomfortable prescribing at all and\nthey're like I am using opiates and when\nyou say it like that it sort of switches\nit around right and then it's like then\nit's like okay man like well let's work\non that and then then then what you do\nif you want to work with people who are\nlying is that you reward good behavior\nright so then I say okay let's let's get\nChico sober like why don't you go into\nrehab for a while and then like once\nyou're done with rehab like if you can\nstay clean for two weeks I'll prescribe\nyou're at all again and and then they're\nlike okay great so like this is also\nthis comes so do you guys see when\nsomeone comes clean to you and you don't\npunish them for it what you're doing is\ngoing back to creating safety so this is\nthe\nkey thing so I guess you know I guess\nthis talk was supposed to be how to\ndetect someone's line but I guess really\nwhat it's turning into is how to get\npeople to stop lying to you and the way\nthat you get people to stop lying to you\nis you create unlike an area of safety\nwhere you kind of say look you know\nlet's use another example where you know\nyou're afraid that someone is cheating\non you so that's a very common and then\nyou once again you got to think through\nlike what are the consequences if this\nperson is cheating on me like are they\nfinancially dependent on me do they live\nwith me do I support them if all of\nthose things are true then the\nlikelihood for them to lie is way higher\nand then you know because the\nconsequences of like them coming clean\nif they're afraid that you're gonna\nbreak up with them or something like\nthat and then like those consequences\nare really really high so then you have\nto be like extra careful because they\nhave a big big incentive the cost to\nthem being caught in their lie is very\nvery high so they're going to do\neverything that they can to keep you to\ncontrol your behavior to not break up\nwith them and so oddly enough if you're\nin that situation you know then the next\nquestion that you have to ask yourself\nis like is this person you know what's\ntheir threshold right so what's their\ndamage resistance\nright like how much how much can they\ntank damage so when they screw up are\nthey people that have pretty high damage\nresistance and they can like withstand\nit like is this someone who even if they\nyou know are financially dependent on me\nlike you know they're the kind of person\nthat if I kicked him out the door like\nthey recognize that that's fair and that\nthey can handle it and they'll be okay\nbecause if they're damaged resistance is\nhigh then they're less likely to lie and\nthen kind of the the third kind of thing\nto think about is how can you create a\nsafe space right so like if so if you're\nconcerned that your partner is cheating\non you you can just sort of say like\nlook so and now what we're gonna do is\ntrust not so I'll show you guys like the\nKeating example okay so let's talk about\ncheating so the issue with cheating is\nthat if cheating\nrust right if not cheating so then what\nwe do so like normally the way that we\nlook at it is this right if cheating no\ntrust and if not cheating trust so what\ndo we do if you want to talk to this\nperson and get them to come clean I\nguess what this is really turning into\nis how to manipulate Liars this is what\nyou have to do so how do you do that so\nwhat you say is look I'm concerned that\nyou're cheating on me and there are a\ncouple of things like I saw some\ndisturbing text messages on your phone\nand and like basically I find myself\nlike not trusting you and I I know that\nyou say you're not doing anything but\nlike I'm really really having difficulty\ntrusting you and even if you are\ncheating like what would feel better to\nme is like what I want from you is\nhonest like I don't really care about\nwhether you're cheating or not but what\nI really want is honesty and because if\nyou are cheating like I value our\nrelationship and if you're you know if\nyou regret it then like I think we\nshould try to move past it and we can\ntry to work past it but I need to know\none way or the other right like I just\ndon't want to be lied to and we can\nthink about how to move forward because\neveryone makes mistakes and then just\ntell me if it's going on because like\nI'm worried about it and I find it like\nit's hard for me to trust you right now\nand so what you're trying to do there is\nlike you're creating even though you're\nknocking off trust you're increasing the\nsafety of the space\nright you're giving them a chance you're\nkind of saying like I want you to come\nclean and even if you come clean it\ndoesn't mean that things are over\nbetween us\nand so what often times what people say\nis they'll say like Oh like you know if\nyou're cheating on me [ __ ] you your mom\n[ __ ] done with you I'm done with you\nfor the rest of your life this and this\nand this and people say that [ __ ] but\nwhat they don't realize is all you're\ndoing is incentivizing that person to\nlie to your face like sure it feels good\nto say that and then what happens is\nthey say yeah I really am cheating on\nyou and then you stay calm for a little\nwhile and you say like okay how long has\nit been going on and you kind of try to\ncontrol your emotions a little bit and\nthen like you know you talk about it for\nlike a day or two and then you decide\nwhere you are with that can you forgive\nthem if you can't forget because you\ndon't need to forget them then what you\ndo is you kick their ass to the curb\nyou're like yeah I want you to move out\nby the end of the week I don't think I\ncan like like I don't know if I can come\nback from this or not I really\nappreciate your honesty and then your\n[ __ ] kick them to the curb right you\ncreate a safe space then you stab them\nin the back because they [ __ ] you and\nthat's not fair but and sometimes I'll\nyou know I think you should give it a\nfair shot and I got to see chance\nreaction when I say that because I'm\njust trying to figure out you know but\nseriously like that that's how it is\nright like let's be honest like you you\nwant to be honest with them and then you\ngot to kind of let them know like you\ngive it a fair shot and then if you\ncan't be aunt like if you can't forgive\nthem then you can't forgive them and\nthen yeah you send them out the door and\nis it that manipulative absolutely it's\nabsolutely human if you live it because\nit [ __ ] line to you doesn't like what\nwhat you're just going to take it laying\nthat and and and so like you know I\nthink like if someone does you wrong\nthen you know you could like I don't\nknow\nright it's not it's not gender dependent\nby the way guys like I said kick them to\nthe curb right so a lot of deadbeat\ndudes that that cheat on their\ngirlfriends and deadbeat dudes that\ncheat on their boyfriends and deadbeat\ngirls that cheat on their girlfriends\nit's like there's the whole spectrum\nit's really not gender dependent but I\nthink the key thing here is is you know\nyou have to figure out like you have to\nthink about like who's being controlled\nand how you're being controlled and\nthink about how to create a safe space\nand I genuinely do think that you know\nif you want a relationship to work and\nthere's been cheating that has gone on\nyou have to have honesty because the\nwhole point is if Trust is gone then the\nrelationship is dead from the inside\nlike that's not solvent I mean it's not\nfixable if the trust is dying - trust is\ndying and then you've got to kind of you\nknow you got to work from there like\nit's not I don't think that that's\nmanipulative at all so I'm not saying\nthat you know if someone confesses to\nyou that they're cheating I think you\nshould really give that fair\nconsideration and think about what's\ngoing on with your relationship no I\ndon't I don't think it's eye for an eye\nat all like I don't think that helps\nanything and the issue is like how do\nyou cuz think about for a second if\nsomeone cheats on you that trust is dead\nalready so you have to build that trust\non and if you want to build that trust\noff like you can't do it without honesty\nright so I mean this is kind of tricky\nbut but that's kind of where it starts\nand then if you can't build that trust\nor you do need your space then I think\nit's fine to break up with them like\nwhen you when you're creating a safe\nspace you're not promising that you're\ngonna be with them forever I think you\nshould be honest and what you're saying\nis like I need a chance to move past\nthis and in order to do that what I need\nfrom you is honesty which is absolutely\ntrue and then you know be careful\nbecause like if you don't really believe\nthat then I wouldn't recommend that you\nlie to them but I think you should give\nit a fair shot and kind of say like it's\ninteresting I had a conversation with my\nwife about this and maybe you know it's\nblending into relationship advice but we\ntalked a little bit about like you know\nwhat of us had one an affair like what\nwould we do about it how would we handle\nit and and she was a little bit\nsurprised by my answer and I was like I\nwould absolutely tell you if she was\nlike why I was like because I think it's\nyou have the right to decide whether you\nstay in this relationship or not like\nit's not my place to decide for you\nwhether you stay in this relationship\nit's your choice anyway that's kind of\nneither here nor there and so that's why\nI think even if you have had an affair\nlike you should tell your partner if you\nreally care about them because if you\nreally care about them they deserve to\nbe with someone who hasn't had an affair\nwith them right and that may not be you\nand so like just because it doesn't\nserve like I just don't think like that\nand yeah it's it's weird like I know\nit's weird because like like it comes\ndown to like self-interest and control\nthen like I don't think it's my place to\ncontrol her decision about who she dates\nit's her choice right and it's like my\njob to try to make the relationship as\nlike positive for her as she can't as I\ncan and it's her job to make the\nrelationship is positive as she can for\nme and that's that's how like the\nrelationship works okay but we kind of\ngot astray\nso just to recap a little bit okay we're\ngonna go back to this okay so just to\nkind of recap how do you you know\nhow do you think about whether someone\nis lying or not lying so the first thing\nis that you've got to think about you\nthink about it as control and think\nabout does this person have a vested\ninterest to control me and if they have\na vested interest to control you your\nantenna should be raised the second\nthing is what is this person's damage\nresistance how likely are they to face\ntheir consequences this is the best way\nto put it\nare they no are they consequence\navoidant\nokay and the more consequence avoidant\nthey are the more likely they are to lie\nright and if we think about it like\ngamers are really big liars and if we\nthink about like you know I remember\nwhen you know my parents would call me\nup when I was like 21 or 20 and they\nwould ask me how did class go today and\nI said fine and that was a [ __ ] lie\ncuz I didn't go to class but I was so\ndamn consequence avoidant like I was so\navoidant that there's no way I'm ever\ngonna tell the truth because if I tell\nthem yeah it didn't go well then they\nask me why and then I have to answer and\nthen I have to tell them that I'm\nplaying games all day and I'm a piece of\n[ __ ] and then I have to say those words\nout loud and like all I want to do is\nlike not think about anything that I\njust want to go back to like playing\nDiablo and like not worry about any of\nthat [ __ ] so I'm very consequence\navoided\nright and we see this in our population\nwhere everyone makes these big bold\nclaims about how awesome they are at\nlife and how much they get laid and how\nbig their dick is and all this kind of\ncrap and that's all because their\nconsequence avoided so the equation is\nkind of you know what's the consequence\nhow consequence avoided are they and\nthen that sort of gives you the general\nidea of how likely they are to lie okay\nso then you know high likelihood\nthe hood hello likelihood right so then\nyou kind of like in your mind you you\nsplit people into two camps which camper\nland high likelihood a little acre and\nthen there are a couple of clues that\nyou can kind of use but these are sort\nof notorious so the first thing is like\nyou can't you know people talk about\nlike oh if someone looks up to the left\nand looks up to the right like I think\nall that crap is so imprecise that I\nwould not bet any amount of money on\nlike making that you know you can't make\na relationship decision based on whether\nwhere someone's eyes go he's just a bad\nway to navigate a relationship okay so\nhere's the first thing that you guys\nneed to look for is a fact now here's\nnow we talk about detection okay so so\nwe talked about effect we talked about a\nhum gar\nthink about us so we're gonna talk about\nfirst and then a hum car so effect is\nthe display of emotion so I do this a\nlot on stream where you know I'll point\nout to people that they're like smiling\nand then like who was it who's a Dyer\nwas a dyrus I think you know a week ago\nwe had a stream with tires which was\nreally fantastic and he told this story\nnews laughing he was like yeah I was\nplaying baseball and I was scared of the\nball and my dad threw the ball at me and\nit hit me in the eye and he's like oh so\nfunny I got hit too like my dad threw a\nbaseball and it hit me in the eye and he\nwas laughing you know like that's and I\nwas like dude that's weird man like why\nare you laughing like that's not funny\nman so someone so a fact is the emotion\nthat you see in someone's face and\nsometimes it's diskin groom n't okay\nand what I mean by dis congruent is it's\nnot like it's it doesn't match with like\nwhat they're saying so a dis congruent\neffect is a sign that there's something\nweird going on in someone's like head so\nif they're like laughing about something\nthat that really terrible happened to\nthem or another good example is like you\nknow when we talked to xqc or polka mein\nabout like you know what it feels like\nto be successful and we asked them in\nlike they don't feel successful at all\nthey feel like failures that's another\nexample of a dis congruent effect\nbecause you would expect that someone\nwho is accomplished so much should feel\ngood about themselves but they don't\nfeel good about themselves they like\nbeat themselves up further and they like\ndon't let themselves sit with that idea\nand all that kind of good stuff\nso you can have a disc and ruin effect\nwhere someone should be happy and\nthey're not happy or you could have a\ndisc including effect where someone\nshould be crying and instead what\nthey're doing is laughing because humor\nis a defense mechanism\noh so that's just explaining what effect\nis does that make sense I got to check\nin with chat again\nthat make sense\nyeah okay No so there there's my point\nis that the expressions on someone's\nface give you a clue as to what's going\non on the inside and sometimes what they\nshow in their face doesn't match up with\nwhat they should they should be showing\nand that's what a diss congruent effect\nis\nokay I know I need to get a second\nmonitor I just don't probably doing that\ntime to settle I know I don't know\nsecond monitor Kovan okay so let's talk\nlet's go back to Lyme so how do we use\neffect in terms of lines so the main\nthing here to watch out for is like if\nyou say something look for an effective\nchange so ignore the words that come out\nof their mouth because like Liars like\nthe instrument that they use to control\nyou is words right that's literally what\nlying is it is speaking words that are\nfalse so the way to detect someone is\nlying is not to pay attention to their\nwords and in fact it's to completely\nignore their words and pay attention to\ntheir face right so like look at what\nhappens like if I say hey wait where\nwere you today oh I was nowhere no what\nwhat no I was nowhere and like that\nshould not elicit an effective response\nright like that doesn't that shouldn't\nelicit any kind of effect it's like\nwe're like where were you what were you\nup to and then if they have an effective\nresponse to that that's kind of like a\nclue\nand then as you talk to them you know\ntry to think a little bit about like if\nyou're talking to them like notice\nwhat's going on with their affic like\nthere may be times where they should be\ndisplaying more effect like they should\nfeel offended or whatever and like\nthey're like stone-cold even or like\nthey should be like you're asking an\ninnocent question and they have an\neffective response hi come back okay hi\nlet's go eat\ngo eat Milos no okay hi darlings okay\nokay okay so all right so the\ninteresting thing this one doesn't know\nhow to lie the other one is a very good\nliar dude she's like so good at lying\nokay did you have fun today we're\ntalking about lying do you know lying is\nwhat's lying\nyou\nI perfect say that way forever okay so\nlet's keep going so the the second thing\nis like don't pay attention to their\nwords pay attention to their their\neffects so what they display on their\nface and especially like dis congruent\nan effect and this can be tough because\nif you you know if you're concerned that\nsomeone is lying it's completely\nreasonable for them to be trying to calm\nwith it because they're like trying to\nremain calm and it's perfectly\nreasonable for them to be angry so it's\nnot like you know wandered one or either\nof those things is gonna be sufficient\nOh sounds like someone's crying okay\nlet's go let's go drop you off can I go\ndrop you up let's go see why your event\nis chronic and then daddy will finish\nthis lecture okay okay can you guys hear\nthat the crying in the background\nall right so back to the lecture so pay\nattention to their face and pay\nattention to their emotional response\nand you can't you know it's not like a\nsmoking gun but it's gonna sort of like\nclue you in it's not gonna like you\ndon't want to get diverted by their\nwords and then you know the second thing\nto think about is their ego so a hump\ncar is the son script word for ego and\noftentimes ego can be a sign of it's a\nprotective mechanism and it can be like\na sign of you know kind of impending\ndanger and so if someone's ego becomes\nlike pretty active and how can I explain\nhow what that looks like yeah that's\nactually so like if you see kind of like\nif they go on the attack if you express\nconcerns like that's a sign of the ego\nso like if they start to attack you in\nsome way if they start to like ask like\nI don't ask you this kind of stuff like\nwhy are you asking me\nthey make comparisons and they go on the\nattack so those are the two things that\nyou want to look out for in terms of\nactivity of ego\nokay so they go on the offensive\nor they make comparisons\nand and so you have to watch out for\nthese two things I mean the really\ntricky thing about this is that this\ndoesn't necessarily mean that they're\nlying like they could just be hurt so\nthe tricky thing about this is like if\nthey're hurt like if you say something\nand they feel hurt that can that can\nactivate the ego or they can feel like\nfear that you're gonna catch them and\nthat can activate the ego so neither of\nthese is a smoking gun okay\nand then the last thing to kind of think\nabout is actually your gut okay so I\nthink at the end of the day most human\nbeings are pretty good so you do all\nthis stuff right like see you figure out\nwho they like high likelihood low\nlikelihood you pay a tech to their pay\nattention to their affect and especially\nabout whether it's congruent or diss\ncongruent you kind of watch out for the\nego and at the end of the day like you\ncan't know whether someone is lying\nright there's no way of knowing for sure\nwhether someone is lying and so what it\nkind of comes down to is your gut and\nwhat I ultimately the first thing that\nyou've got to figure out is like figure\nout is my gut pretty good\nright so like are you someone that\ngenerally is accurate are you filled\nwith social anxiety and insecurity\nbecause if you're filled with social\nanxiety and insecurity like don't trust\nyour gut it's hard to not do that but\nlike stop and think about that or are\nyou like pretty good at judging people\nand like like are you you know good like\nis your gut like tuned well or is it\nlike out of out of tune and so\nultimately I mean I I think you should\nyou know go with your gut it doesn't\nmean that you should you know break up\nwith someone because you think they're\ncheating on you or something like that\nor fire someone because you think\nthey're stealing I think you should use\nyour gut to kind of guide you and then\ncollect evidence because that's\nultimately what it comes down to so I'm\nworking with people who you know have\nsubstance use disorders at the end of\nthe day I sort of have an internal sense\nof whether I think this person is lying\nor not lying but that's not what I base\nany of my actions on right and this is\nthe last thing about lying that's really\nreally important to understand is it the\nway that you should deal with lying\nshouldn't be based on your feelings it\nshould be based on data or kind of\nthinking through things so just because\nI think someone is cheating on me is not\na sufficient reason to to break up with\nthem but if my God is pretty good in\ntheir being kind of shady and then I\nthink it's reasonable to like for me to\nactually try to collect evidence to see\nif my gut is right or Islam or is like\nworth it to have a conversation with\nthem about why I feel the way that I\nfeel and see if they can help me figure\nout you know what's going on here like\nwhy do I feel this way and and\nultimately like let your gut be the\nguide for whether you collect evidence\nor don't collect evidence think about\nwhether this person has a high\nlikelihood or low likelihood of Lyme to\nyou and then like use you know effect\nand a hump garlotte pay attention to\ntheir ego and pay attention to their\nface to try to deduce like what you\nthink is going on and then once your gut\nsort of once you calculate all those\nkind of variables and you have like okay\nthis like either I'm going to be assured\nor I'm not going to be assured then if\nyour so let me write this out okay okay\nso here's here's the final thing okay\nalright so\nokay so high consequence\nversus low consequence\nand then let's call it concept\navoided\nsays consequence\nembracing okay\nso a combination of this\nthese two gives you their two likelihood\nright so that plus dis congruent effect\nso what disk and ruin effect means or\ncongruent effect\nplus I ego response or low ego response\nokay and that ends up with your god\nthat has a high suspicion\nmissed all that forward or low suspicion\nokay and then what happens is you've got\ntwo choices so you can investigate which\nI think is reasonable okay or you can\nconverse and this is what you do right\nso if if I don't cost that someone is is\nbeing honest with me I'm going to drug\ntest them\nright or initiative paranoid you can\nhire a private investigator if you're\nconcerned that someone's cheating on you\nright you can you know talk to other\npeople I guess but that's not really a\ngreat way or you can converse and then\nlike you have you know you kind of talk\nabout and what you do when you converse\nis like create a safe space\nright you kind of talk about trust and\nthen we kind of go back to like this\nstop over here so this is the point of\nconversing it's to handle this\nand then hopefully at the end of it what\nyou're going to end up with is as being\nyou know the goal here is to like do all\nthis crap and then end up being\nreassured or to have honesty\nand that's really the goal and this is\nthis is how you deal with liars or\npeople hurt and this is how you deal\nwith concerns that people are aligned\nokay questions thoughts okay so look\nokay so now we have a question here I've\nbeen a pathological liar my whole life\nand I realize that I'm all alone and\ndon't have anyone I can call real\nfriends or family this causes me a lot\nof distress I've lied to anyone that\nI've crossed paths with even those who\nare close to me telling the truth now\nwould be devastating as it would end my\nrelationships with everyone I know what\nadvice do you have for pathological\nliars who want to change so I want you\nguys to pay attention to this okay so\nwe're gonna do this this thing so now we\nsee why this person lies so we're gonna\ndo this we're gonna do this this we're\ngonna do this and we're gonna do this\nthis do this do this so I want you\njust look at this hey I've been a\npathological liar my whole life and I\nrealized oh Sh\nI can't read this\n[ __ ] around\ngood call copy\nyou\nmerge formatting keep text only yeah\nit's it's still keeping it whatever okay\nso I think this is the thing so I've\nbeen a pathological liar my whole life\nI've lied a blah blah blah this is the\nproblem sentence you guys ready for it\nso now we see why this person lives\nright Oh God\nokay telling the truth now would be\ndevastating as it would end my\nrelationships with it everyone I know so\nthis is the reason this person lives\nbecause this is a high consequence and\nthe person is consequence avoidant and\nthis is how a pathological liar is born\nyou guys see that like does that make\nsense\nthis is exactly what a pathological liar\nis it's someone who has to control the\nopinions of other people around him or\nher and if we think a little bit about\nlike how does this person move forward\nso it starts with those two things right\nit starts with being less conflict I\nmean consequence avoiding it comes with\nbeing consequence embracing and for you\nto recognize that you've got two options\nin life one is that you can continue\nliving a lie and at some point it's\ngoing to come crumbling down because it\ncomes crumbling down and secondly you\nmay not be as good of a liar as you\nthink you are most people may know that\nyou're kind of full of [ __ ] and they\njust don't give a [ __ ] because they're\nliving their own lives and they don't\nhave time to waste on you and like\ncatching you out to be a liar or you can\nstart to build relationships and meet\nnew people with whom you're honest and\nthis is where now we get to some\ninteresting stuff okay so like let's\ntalk about lying about yourself so if\nyou want to conquer lying if you're\nalive and just think about this because\nlying is about control right it's about\ncontrolling your it's about controlling\nother people's responses to you and\nthat's why pathological liar lies he\nprobably lies about his job he lies\nabout I'm assuming it's a dude but he\nlies about his job he lies about his\nrelationships lies about all kinds of\nthings and it also becomes like random\nlike sometimes they just start lying\nbecause they don't know what else to do\nso if you want to conquer lying you have\nto start by understanding what are you\nlying to control right that's where you\nstart to overcome lying in your life and\nin yourself like what are you trying to\ncontrol by telling this lie what is the\nresponse you're hoping to create what is\nthe outcome that you're hoping to avoid\nbecause lying is about avoidance of an\noutcome and then when you dig into that\nyou're gonna find out what is it that I\ncare about why is it important that\npeople view me in this\nway and if you're lying about it you\ncare about it in some way so most gamers\nlie out of fear of a particular\nconsequence and they strive to control\nother people's reactions to them right\nso like parents taking my games away\ncontinuing to get financial support by\nlying about your school performance\nthat's something that I did to my\nparents lying to an essay at significant\nother about like how much you play games\nto keep them in the relationship and\neventually what you're gonna figure out\nis that like you're trying to prevent a\nparticular outcome and that particular\noutcome is a fear right you have a fear\nthat your your significant other is\ngonna leave you you have a fear that\nyou're gonna drop out of college you\nhave a fear that you're going to like\nyou know be laughed at by your friends\nor never invited to another another\nparty and chances are for most of you\nguys if it's if you're like me it's the\nfear of being like a [ __ ] up and a be\nlike being behind in like it's like\nbeing nowhere in life but the thing is\nif you're a pathological liar and you're\nlying to everyone you actually are\nbehind in life you are a [ __ ] you're\nalready a [ __ ] but what you're afraid\nof is everyone knowing that you're a\n[ __ ] but it's already true and so if\nyou want to stop lying what you have to\ndo is like face the fear that you're\ntrying to control that's what it comes\ndown to and like the really this is this\nis where it gets kind of really sad is\nbecause you believe that about yourself\nright like it's not even a fear in your\nmind you're afraid that other people are\ngonna know it but you believe that if\nyou show them the honest version of\nyourself they're going to reject just\nthink about that for a second what when\nwhen someone's a pathological liar the\nthing that they actually fear the most\nis already true in their mind because\nthey think that they're a [ __ ] you've\naccepted that in your life you are a\n[ __ ] and you're never going to amount\nto anything and then you just have to\nlie to keep people from realizing it and\nthat's a really really really really\nproblematic way to look at yourself\nbecause you just can't win there right\nlike there's no amount of lying that's\ngonna cover up for the fact that you're\na [ __ ] and and this is vital because\nwhat you're afraid of is already\nhappening and you're just trying to hide\nit your worst fear is actually true and\nthis is the really important thing\nbecause hiding it doesn't actually help\nbecause the problem is already there\nright so like all hiding does is\nactually propagate the problem and so\nwhat you need to do is change that\nbelief about yourself that you are\nmessed up that you are behind and that\nyou need to be ashamed of yourself and\nthe really really sad thing is that the\npeople who you're afraid that they're\ngoing to abandon you when you tell them\nthe truth those are actually the people\nthat are the most likely to help you\nactually make a change if I feel like\nI'm worthless in life and I don't want\nanyone to know look let's say I don't\nwant my older brother to know where I\ndon't want my parents to know I don't\nwant my friends to know and then what\nhappens is I propagate this lie and I\ndon't actually like get any better right\nbut what instead what I need to do if I\nactually want to change on the inside I\nneed those people's help\nand so when you lie to other people and\nyou don't tell them what's going on with\nyou you're propagating a fantasy while\nmaintaining a reality that is like the\nvery thing that you fear and you're also\ncutting out the people who can actually\nhelp you make a change in your life just\nthink about this if you think that\nyou're a nothing in life and you go to\nsomeone like let's say you go to your\nbest friend and you say hey man I've\nbeen lying to you for years I remember a\nfriend of mine did this came to me one\nday and he said I actually like lie and\nI never gradual like we were in college\ntogether and he came to me a couple\nyears later and he's like I lied I never\ngraduated like I just dropped out of\nschool and I pretended to go to school\nand in that moment he was looking for\nrejection right he was like man [ __ ] you\nbut like I'm gonna say that I'm like man\ndude that sucks\nwhy I barely passed you know like how\nare you doing with that man like it\nsounds like you like those are the\npeople that you actually need to accept\nand then once those people accept you\nlike once you once they see you for all\nthe piece of crap that you are worthless\nand all this kind of stuff and then they\ndon't run away then this part inside it\nstarts to change right this part starts\nto change and you're like oh wait a\nminute like maybe I'm not messed up\nbecause these people are accepting me\nfor who I am maybe I like maybe I'm\nactually an okay person and so you have\nto face your fear in order to overcome\nit and you have to acknowledge where you\nare in order to go where you want so\nwhen you\nlie to other people you deny where you\nare and this is why you're stuck because\nit's like you're like you're it's like\nyou're trying to navigate on a map and\nand like you're not telling the GPS like\nwhere your real location it's like how\nthe [ __ ] are you gonna go anywhere if\nthe GPS doesn't know where you are like\nyou have to start by like with from\nwhere you are and it's like it's a\nreally sad scenario like why is everyone\nsaying all before I'm confused okay\nanyway so that's what I think is going\non so like at the end of the day anyway\nI was ranting for a while that expense\nokay what if they were then they reject\nman and like this is the cool thing if\nthey reject right if they reject you\nthen then what then you wake up the next\nday and you like take a dump and you\nmake yourself a cup of coffee and like\nlife goes on right like this is the\nthing is like people's rejection like I\nknow it hurts but your life doesn't come\nto a grinding halt like I think the\nworld would be a far better place and\nand like the people like our audience\nwould be so much better off if they\nrealize that rejection does not destroy\nlike this is the big thing that I\nlearned right like this is why I'm such\na big fan of failure like when you know\ngetting 8090 hundred rejections from med\nschools and plastering up on my like I\nwish I I wish I'd kept those and then\nlike when I got into med school I\nremember there's this one day okay story\ntime you guys want story time okay so\nyou know I had been rejected what a lot\na lot a lot and then like I realized\nokay I got into med school and I was\nhappy and I realized like like I looked\ninto the chasm of absolute failure and\nthen I had jumped in and I had wall\naround in the dark for a little while\nand then I'd crawled out and then I\nremember there was this one day where\nwhere's we were on surgery and sometimes\npeople you know surgeons can be mean to\nmedical students happens so we were I\nwas doing vascular surgery and we were\ndoing something called a carotid and our\ndirect\nme and what a carotid endarterectomy is\nyou have two carotid arteries that you\nknow basically carry blood from your\nheart to your brain there are the two\nbiggest forms of circulation you also\nhave them for t-bone artery in the back\nbut so a carotid endarterectomy is\nsometimes these get clogged with like\nplaque and like you know from eating\nunhealthy and stuff like that and then\nthey narrow and then you don't have\nenough blood flow going to the brain and\nif they get super super small once they\nget around 70% clogged then you have to\nactually go in and like take them out\nlike you have to take out all that crud\nand you have to reopen the artery okay\nso we were doing this operation on\nsomeone we were like you know so there's\nlike a vascular surgeon who's like you\nknow we've got the dude's neck opened up\nand he's like trying to repair it or on\nan artery or whatever and then you know\nthe field of view for a carotid artery\nwhich means like the actual space that\nyou're operating in is like tiny like\nyou have this part of the neck opened up\nright so it's maybe like like two inches\nacross it and maximum and okay I don't\nknow what's okay I don't know what\npeople are talking about here I'm just\ngonna keep telling my story so the\nsurgeons operating there and I'm not\nreally doing a whole lot because I'm a\nmedical student you can't you know it's\nlike you have to really be precise and\nif I Nick the wrong thing the dude could\nhave a stroke and die so I'm not doing\nany of that so I'm just kind of there\nand I'm watching he's on one side of the\ntable and I'm on the other side of the\ntable I'm basically holding something\ncalled a retractor which is like I'm\nholding the skin open so that he can\noperate and then he Nick's something\nokay this is the blood starts working\nand then it fills up because it's a tiny\nspace right so it only takes like maybe\nfive millimeters of blood to like fill\nup the space that you can't see the\nartery in and he's like looking for\nwhere he nicked it and then so it's a\nstressful situation and like he's on one\nside of the table and I'm on the other\nside of the table so we get a suction\nand we suction out the blood and for a\nflash of a second before it fills up\nagain we have a clearer view and what do\nI see on my side I see a spurting\nfountain blood like I see exactly where\nthe Nick is and he can't see it he's\nlooking for it he suctions again he like\nlooks again and he's suctions but he's\non the wrong [ __ ] side of the table\nbecause I like I can see cuz I'm on my\nestate so B being dumb\nyou know I say excuse me dr. so-and-so I\nthink I done the the Nick is here it's\non this side and then what does he say\nhe says the med student when I want your\nopinion I will ask for it and I was like\ndude are you [ __ ] kidding me and like\nI'm like the guy's gonna have a stroke\nand you can't find where the nicked\nartery is and it's like literally cuz\nI'm on the other side of the table it's\nnot an opinion man the guy's blood is\nspurting and he's like he's gonna die\nyou're not gonna die\ngonna have a stroke and then so there\nare two fellows with me and one of them\nstarted cracking up a little bit but and\nthen so anyway the artery got repaired\ncuz at the end of the day the surgeon\nlisten to what I had to say and and you\nknow like that kind of [ __ ] happens all\nthe time and usually like med students\nget like hurt by it right they're like\noh I tried to help in the surgeon yelled\nat me and he like I didn't know the\nanswer to the question then they yelled\nat me and they hurt my feelings oh my\ngod that's like dude it doesn't matter\nlike I don't think you guys understand\nlike this is the the main thing med\nstudents have never failed anything in\nlife so they don't understand like\nfailure doesn't destroy you in fact you\njust wake up the next day and then it's\nlike bog dump time and then you take a\ndump and you move on with your life and\nyou're still there and you survived and\nthen like you know someone rejects you\nand then you're like okay so I guess\nthey're not my friends anymore and then\nyou're like okay well maybe next time\nwhat I should do is try to lie a little\nbit less and then you meet another\nperson and then you know you play games\nwith them for a while and you ask them\nto hang out and they say what do you do\nin life and then you say okay I'm a you\nusually lie about being a you know\nprofessional poker player or trader or\nwhatever you're like yeah I'm just\ntrying to figure it out you just say\nthose words and then something magical\nhappens so anyway I'm gonna go back so\nlike anyway I saw the Nick right and I\nsaw where it wasn't the dude ended up\nfine and so like this is the thing and\nlike a lot of medical students get bent\nout of shape over that sort of thing\nwhen they get yelled at in the or\nbecause they don't know the answer the\nquestion or whatever like it's just to\nthe surgeons an [ __ ] it's like you're\nnot doing anything wrong and even if you\nare doing something wrong with you\nmedic-2 student like you're here to do\nthings wrong I don't think people get\nthat right students are expected to make\nmistakes and if you're like living life\nif you're a gamer like you're expected\nto make mistakes man like the real world\nis not like your video game so you're\ngonna make mistakes like that's okay bro\nlike just learn and get rejected by\nsomeone and then on mobile with seven\nokay I'm gonna keep going I'm just gonna\nkeep talking okay so like this is the\nthing when you get rejected like the\nnext time around you meet someone and\nthen like you're a little bit more\nhonest with them and when you tell them\nwhen they're like hey what are you doing\ninstead of saying yeah I'm an attorney\nat so-and-so law firm which is a\ncomplete lie you're just like yeah man\nI'm trying to figure it out and then\nsomething magical is gonna happen\nbecause then they're gonna say yeah man\nme too\nand then you guys are gonna like you\nknow y'all are gonna like be like yeah\nthere's gonna be like a virtual fist\nbump where where you're meeting them\nhalfway and you guys are both trying to\nfigure in huh and then it's like cool\nand then one day you guys can actually\nhave a conversation about it right\nbecause if you're the attorney in your\nmind and he thinks you're the attorney\nand then he like asks you for advice and\nthen you feel good about yourself\nbecause you're giving him false advice\nbecause you don't know what the [ __ ]\nyou're talking about instead what\nhappens is you guys can be like\nauthentic about it you can be like hey\nman like I'm trying to figure this stuff\nout like what are you doing put your\nlife together he's like dude I'm playing\na lot of video games and he's like\nyou're like yeah I'm and me too like\nwhat do you think man should we do\nsomething about that look let's try to\nfigure that out like how about I work on\nmy resume you work on your resume and we\nsend it to each other in a week and I'm\nlike after we send each other resumes we\nlike queue up for valor and and dota or\nwhatever and we play some games and like\nthat's that's how you move forward but\nas long as you're lying you're not like\nmoving forward like you can't do that\nright\nanyway questions thoughts that enough\nabout lying in storytime and all that\ngood stuff and playing some dota what\nare we doing"
