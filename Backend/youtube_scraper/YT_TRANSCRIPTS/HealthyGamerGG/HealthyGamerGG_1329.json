    "transcript": "like not like any chat open and just\nkind of like go through that go\nsometimes you know I don't want to get\nlike affected by what people think or\nsay or sometimes like I feel like when\nI'm shooting I get this like a loop or\nlike you zone right gotta get into this\nflow of things yeah I don't like not\nhave that right now no sense just so I\nyou you want to be in a flow no I don't\nlike no I mean like um okay so I don't\nbe like um affected by like the mood or\nlike oh um what's chat saying it's like\nI mean is that made me like act\ndifferent like you know just chill it\nwas chat bro I never looked exactly\nexactly exactly so as I was saying that\nusually when I'm talking to someone I\nmean they require a hundred percent of\nmy attention or I try to give them a\nhundred percent of my attention and and\nyeah I mean I couldn't do what I do if I\nwas having a conversation with like ten\nthousand people I'm having conversation\nwith one person there just happen to be\nlike 10,000 people watching or more it's\ngood in your case so yeah I mean yeah I\nget it\nyeah so tell me what what what do you\nwant to talk about today so you have\nchat clothes or chat is open on those go\nokay so we just a noun you should we\nturn off the stream and troll them and\ntalk for an hour in private\nremind you like it I'm so glad we did\nthis\ngood got then yeah um can't control us\nbut we control them too yeah yeah yeah\nwe did way harder to like I remember\nsoda one time however he just turned a\nstream on it and it was like the opening\nscreen like this starting soon screening\nand he just never went on that it was\nthere for like I don't know like a\ncouple hours and it just turned it off\nyeah so what do you want I think that\nsounds great by the way and what am i\ncalling you bro Felix\nokay Felix Felix um wait what does feel\nis that a name oh no I thought you said\nfeel I've misheard you\non the off Felix or ecstasy either okay\nthere's good Felix okay yeah so Felix\nwhat what do you want I'm completely in\nfavor of what you said earlier about\njust like having a conversation between\ntwo people\noh yeah exactly um well I want to have\nlike it's an approach with it would\ntopics more like uh you know she's like\nopen or just like a like talk if you\nlike safe like some hoop leaves it\nsomewheres go through it you know\nabsolutely man it's awesome I mean\nthere's like a couple things that that I\nhave that I had it that I like I've seen\non the show some but I don't want like\nto redo things that you already like\ntalked about too much you know make it\nlike I don't know the intent yeah you\nmean you don't want to talk about\nsomething that someone else has talked\nabout um not not like directly like that\njust like I've listened some of the\nadvice throughout that topic is that\nmake sense sure but so I I don't think\nwe can redo anything by the way cuz\nyou're a different person\nokay right so true so I think that if\nI've learned one thing like so you know\nlet's say I work with a hundred people\nwith depression it's not a script right\neach person's unique each person's\nchallenge even though there's something\nthat we share there's like something\nthat's unique and different about who we\nare as people and that's why like you\ncan't watch a conversation with another\nhuman being and then that doesn't apply\na hundred percent to you so I get what\nyou're saying but I would also say like\ndon't how can i I almost get a sense of\nservice in the way that you're talking\nright now it's almost like saying like\nwe shouldn't like cuz you've already\ntalked about this before so like we we\ndon't need to talk about it with me but\nI'm saying okay if that's important to\nyou we should absolutely talk about it\nand who they all cares about what we've\nsaid in the past with other people\nmmm-hmm so what you want to talk about\nFelix um well I had thinking knows like\nover the\npossible months or whatever like stuff\nlike um just like generic like issues\nthat I think most simmers like have not\nlike issues but you know like a mental\nreligious yeah you know stuff like\nimpostor syndrome stuff like\nself-sabotage or whatever okay which is\nI I think sometimes like we'll probably\none of my um not favorite but like\nwhat's something that I nice see more\noften than myself so right tell me in\nwhat ways do you sabotage yourself you\nknow the the analogy always give is kind\nof like when you play a game and you get\na certain rank right that's like really\ngood and you're really proud of yourself\nhuh a lot of times even if I have it I'm\nhappy with it I'll feel like if I play a\ngame or two and I'm not good and I'm\ndoing good\nI'll feel like I want to lose that rank\nright just so I could get it back just\nlike you feel like I deserve it does it\nmake sense yeah I go ahead no go ahead I\nfeel like I do that\na lot of things almost everything I did\nthat that exact same thing or I'll\npurposely like destroy a part of\nsomething just like it again it so I\ncould feel like I deserve it\nyeah I think that makes a lot of sense\nso it's almost as if you it's almost as\nif you need to gain that rank to show\nyourself that you deserve to be there\nyeah and and getting there once isn't\nenough that's never enough so let's\nthink about that why do you think that\nis\nsounds tiring by the way to constantly\nneed to prove your worth um yeah it's\nsuper tiny yeah I setup where you get\ntwo different internets right and you\nget it installed to where like they're\nboth going in and if one fails the other\none kicks in Oh interesting I've never\nI've never heard of that yeah see if I\ncould there we go\nall right sorry about that so yeah\nactually you know what in terms of in\nterms of mindset with you I think\nshimmers I've talked to like crows most\nrumors about this and I have not found\none person who disagrees that dropped\nframes lag server problems internet\nproblems loss trimmings one the most\ndiscouraging thing ever I don't think\nanything comes close to that yeah so it\nwas interesting you know as the internet\nwent on again because this happened on\nFriday when we were talking to polka\nmain and and like it was so interesting\nto feel my reactions cuz at first I was\nlike super super angry because that's\nlike what what the fudge yeah you know\ncuz I so after Friday I like made sure\neverything is okay like tested our\nrouter like everything's fine we called\nour ISP and they were actually doing\nmaintenance in the middle of the\nafternoon on Friday which is why\neveryone out and so then I was like okay\nfine so it looks like we're done\nlike no more maintenance then sure\nenough and I can you know I can play\ngames for like eight hours and our\ninternet doesn't go out at all it's like\nyeah exactly and and no problem if I'm\njust hanging out with my friends but\nwhen you're you know streaming with one\nof the biggest people on Twitch then\nsuddenly your internet is like get\n[ __ ] kid yeah that's so annoying about\nit and so I was thinking a little bit\nabout okay I can't really do a whole lot\nabout it so let's just I decided to get\nmyself some water and and yeah you had\nmy kid\negg okay and you have a kid or like a\nlot of them\nI have something between a and a lot\nI've got two oh yes I've like think\nabout this I don't know why but yeah\nokay but I can I see your um your face\nyeah you can't see my face on discord no\n[ __ ] this is happening again okay hold\non come on we fixed this hold on hold on\nhow do we do this oh yeah yeah hit hit\nhit the gridview oh wait yeah you're\nright wait I can see your face okay okay\nnot always my fault okay yeah do you\nlike to like see yourself while you're\nshowing it because do I sort of person\nyeah\ndo you have any way on your screen that\nyou can see yourself while you're\nstreaming you I think your antenna I\nused to not have that now I do okay so\nno so now they changed my layout to\nwhere I can see my face on the screen\nwhy do you do you like that what do you\nask\nI don't like it I don't like it what do\nyou tell if I get about it\nit feels disingenuous to what I want to\ndo why what to do I want to chill be\nlike more like organic stuff and I feel\nlike sometimes see myself what kind of\nreminds me oh man this is like this is\ncamera this is film this is whatever I\nfeel like it's a it's a constant like it\nbring back all the time kind of realism\nback like a like a fishing rod you know\nyeah so if I'm if I'm hearing you what\nI'd say is that what you're really going\nfor is like immersion for almost like a\nflow state where you're a hundred\npercent with what you're doing yeah and\nand when you see yourself on camera it's\nsort of like reminds you that Felix like\nthis is like we're streaming there are\npeople watching there's all this other\nthing and then you're not you're not\npresent at the task that you're doing\nyeah okay that sounds that sounds bad\nI do a lot of small things in there and\nlike my my I did my setup in my daily\nlife I feel like to maintain that state\nyou know sometimes I like I try too hard\nto keep that state I still do it I don't\nknow why but I still do it what when you\nsay that state you mean the flow state\nlike the state of being present just\nlike stuff with like the way I arrange\nmy things or the way that I go that\ngoing go on with my day like I have\nproblems doing stuff before stream or\ndoing stuff that no that was good doing\nstuff before stream is really hard I\nlike to like tunnel vision and then wake\nup and have one mindset one need one\nwant and I just go into that and I just\nfollow it along\ndoes that make sense and whenever I do\nsomething before stream I feel like I'm\nI'm somewhere and then I go to what at\nwhat to what I want to do right and\nthere's a big like I'm just\nin an odd state and I can always it\nalways happens you know yeah it's very\nprincipled and I always get upset at\nthat I think it's a bad effect when you\nsay you get upset you get upset by not\nbeing as clear-headed as if you start\nright away yeah I'm like I feel\ndisconnected and that's not what I want\nto put out stuff what I want to be and I\nfeel like uh I don't know it as you\ndon't feel like I'm you know worth my\nown stage or whatever does that make\nsense\nno like yes it's like yeah there are two\nthings there okay so Felix you let me\nknow which one you want to talk about\none is cognitively in neuro\nscientifically why it is easier to\nproduce better work when you start first\nthing after you wake up so this is a\nconcept that's been understood by Yogi's\nin India for thousands of years and\nthere's a Sun script phrase Brahma\nmirtha which sort of encapsulates the\nidea of like starting your day off right\nwe can talk about that the second thing\nand that's gonna be like a little bit\nmore like teaching the second thing is\nactually a little bit more subtle and I\nthink maybe a little bit more personal\nand helpful which is somewhere along the\nway so you said I don't deserve my own\nstage right and and this kind of reminds\nme of what you said earlier about like\nif you get to a certain rank and then\nyou'd play one or two bad games you feel\nlike you don't deserve that rank so you\nwant to get knocked down so you can\nreaffirm yourself that you deserve to be\nwhere you are and then you want to climb\nup again because when you climb up then\nlike no you don't take anything for\ngranted\nright like you started at the bottom and\nthen you climbed up so you're like okay\nyeah Felix deserves this because I just\nrose through the ranks yeah and then\nlike coasting is is like well maybe I\ndon't really deserve to be here but if\nyou just rise then you're like\nabsolutely because if I didn't deserve\nto be here then I wouldn't have been\nable to climb if I really deserve to be\none rank lower than I wouldn't have just\nwon ten games in a row right yeah so the\nsubtle thing there yeah go ahead\nno you're good the subtle thing there\nthat like really blows my\nmine felix is like where do you like so\nif we think about it your sense of\nintrinsic value is not there you need to\nclimb ranks to assure yourself that you\ndeserve something so why on earth don't\nyou have an intrinsic sense of like what\nyou deserve and I don't know that\nnecessarily that you need to even answer\nthat or that's the second topic right\nlike yeah because if we think about it\nyou know if I move through the world and\nI walk down the street there's a sense\nof value that I have that comes from\nwithin and there's a sense of value that\ncomes from outside and what I'm noticing\nin you when you save phrases like\nimposter syndrome or or you you say\nthings like I don't deserve the stage or\nyou say things like self-sabotage that\nin my mind tells me that your sense of\nvalue internally got like kind of\ntampered with at some point okay and we\ncan try to figure out why because like\nall those things are the same does that\nmake sense yeah I think they interact\nwith each other I feel like yeah so so\nand that just has to get come down to\nlike why don't you think you have value\nas a person like why don't you think you\ndeserve what you have interesting you\nknow where does that where does that\ncome from because I I don't think people\nare born that way I think people are\nborn with generally a sense of\nentitlement right but they deserve what\nyeah and they're kids and they're kind\nof narcissistic and then somewhere along\nthe ways things happen to us and then we\nstart to like lose value and who we are\nas people okay well I would guess that\num that I mean it it has to be somewhere\ncuz I feel I feel like that sense as\nlike almost develops or something into\nsomething that is more than just like\nlike simple like that like I said\nearlier it like almost like a\nrelationship\nwhat do that like Otto\nneed it now almost like a almost like I\nwant it almost like I emulated sometimes\nit's almost like a something I'm\nfamiliar with yeah Gramps so I can't\ntell you a story about a patient of mine\nsure so I had a patient who had been in\nin three abusive relationships in a row\nyep and and what what she needed from\nher her current partner was just like\nand so the reason so she had had the\nthree abusive relationships and then had\ndated a couple of people and essentially\nkind of drove them away and the reason\nshe kind of drove them away and so she\nblamed herself for this which is sort of\nfair is that like you know the\nrelationships weren't abusive and it was\nkind of confusing to her and so she kind\nof needed like constant reassurance that\nlike they weren't gonna leave her and\nthen like the more she needed\nreassurance like the more kind of clingy\nshe became and the more that her\nprospective boyfriends couldn't handle\nit and so they ended up like the\nrelationship kind of fell apart and then\nwhat happened like it's kind of subtle\nright so like if I'm let's say that I\nneed reassurance from you and then I ask\nyou for that reassurance and then you\ngive it and the next day I ask and you\ngive it and the next day that I ask and\nyou give it and then eventually you kind\nof get fed up and you leave what do you\nthink happens to the next person I date\nhow does that relationship look okay I\nthink I understand okay this is I was\nlistening it I was paying too much\nattention to like the details or I I\nfelt a big picture make sense yeah sure\nthere's a victory of the story and lost\nit because I understand the specifics\nyep I see that okay so if I have a\nrelationship where I need a lot of\nreassurance from someone oh can I Drive\nit uh-huh\nand then you stop getting it in the next\none or whatever well no so it's not even\nthat I stopped getting it what do you\nthink happens in the next one so like my\nneed for your love once you leave me\nwhat happens to how much love I need\num no idea actually tell me okay so so\nwhat happened with her is that she kind\nof felt like so that person left right\nand so the second relationship it's even\nworse because now someone has abandoned\nher again and so she needs more and more\nreassurance and then she drives the\nsecond person away and then two people\nleave and then she's like oh my god I\nneed more and more reassurance\nshe loses value in herself with each\nrelationship and she needs more and more\nvalidation from each person and it's a\nvicious cycle because she can never get\nenough validation my sense does that\nmake sense and so so but the reason that\nshe can never get enough validation is\nbecause she doesn't feel good about\nherself she doesn't feel like she's\nunlovable or she feels like she's on\nmuffled she doesn't feel like she is\nlovable and therefore she needs more\nvalidation from alcohol and it's kind of\nlike a vicious cycle because the more\nvalidation she gets she doesn't develop\nconfidence in herself okay so her like\nself reward isn't enough that she needs\nmore from others that becomes unusable\nlike it became and give her it's that\nit's exactly so she becomes dependent on\nvalidation from other people to the\npoint where that validation is almost\nunattainable because it's too much from\na normal relationship yep okay\nsound familiar\nyes how so yeah\nI stood I usually did it I used to do\nthis thing\nI play overwatch right and I would care\nlot about just the game and how what I\nwould do\nhow loud perform right so I want you to\ncan I just jump in and pause sorry if\nI'm derailing you but I don't love what\nyou said\nI used to Carol I think that's gonna be\nthe answer so please continue okay I'll\ntell a lot about the actual gameplay and\nhow good I was I would perform at any\ngiven time and if I if I felt like I was\nplaying like really bad and I was doing\nreally bad and then I noticed I had a\nlot of viewers it made me like upset\nmaybe upset that people would tune in\nand watch such trash gameplay so I would\nlike shave off viewers on purpose like\nit happened very often what I do things\nto lose viewers so that I'd be like I\nlost something I need to get this back\nI'm gonna play well and then when they\ncut one of the viewers come back or when\nit arises again I feel like I deserve it\nyou know I deserve their their eyes and\nher presence does look good\nI worked there you know I didn't just so\nyou know so Felix why do you have to\nshave off viewers this is important why\ndo you settle that's like this is real\nsabotage why do you have to get rid of\nthem um what how do you feel if they\nstayed and you play like [ __ ]\nwell I think I'm most the time yeah\nright how does that feel to you to waste\nother people's time it feels really\nbetter and how does it feel when they\nleave um\nI think you'll feel good I'm gonna do it\nit feels weird but somewhat good yep but\nI give me a bit any gives me a goal yeah\nso that's weird right look let's just\nlook at that for a second mm-hmm okay\nlet's look at that okay so when you play\nbad and people stick around look why do\nyou think they stick around because you\nhave to push them out the door right you\nhave to actively try to get them to like\nleave why do they stick around I mean\nthe people that sit around I mean for\nfor game play I would that would think\nthat they would stay because of how good\nthey think I am or how better the thing\nI can do no no no they stay because they\nthey like you they value you okay okay\nthat's good\nbut when I when I give up performance\nand gameplay that I don't like I\nunderstand you don't like that okay\nright so you think your value is\ndetermined by your gameplay so yeah but\nwell what I'm telling I mean they're got\nthey have to be people I mean I don't\nreally know but there have to be people\nwho are better at overwatch than you are\nright yeah yeah how do they watch you\nlike this is the thing that you don't\nget and it's so [ __ ] confusing to you\nthat you have value outside of your\nperformance because the other guys\ndidn't scream fine whatever you can\ndevalue yourself however but do you get\nthat like they're sticky because they\nlike you okay and then and then what do\nyou do like that feels weird like if I\ntell you if I tell you the things that\npeople like you because of you and not\nbecause you're playing perfect every\nmatch how does that make you feel must\nfeel a bit weird yeah what is that weird\nlet's understand that\ndon't think that I'm like interesting\nenough for that like a level of\nattention or something yep right so so\nthere's a disconnect between the way\nthat you value yourself as a person and\nthe way that twitch values you and this\nis why twitch is beautiful because they\ncare about you as a person and that's\n[ __ ] confusing to you and then what\nyou do is you have to repeat this drama\nright or that's what you do is you push\nthem out the door\nso like let me just let me think about\nthis I have to just write this out okay\nmmm-hmm I'm gonna need a minute okay\nnow that I can listen and and and and\ntype this in time\nprobably not but let me hear what you\ngood no no go for it not no it was I was\nadding some precision please um now this\nguy like develop into something\ndifferent now that it's not exactly like\nthat anymore because I'm not really like\na competitor anymore so if I if I if I\nplay like trash it's like whatever\nI don't really hold my own game look\nthey're like a high standard I only care\nwhen I care or I only care but the\ngameplay or my performance when I want\nto care about it doesn't I sense okay if\nI'm gonna stay well I'd what I don't\nchaired that much if I played poorly oh\nI can laugh it off and chitchat whatever\nbut I'm gonna stay where I Duke about\nthe gameplay and I want to show them\nthat I'm good to myself and others\nand sure that that passion for getting\nbetter if I don't do well then I then I\nget like that right okay so and I think\nyou've learned two modes is what I'm\nhere yeah yeah okay so we'll we'll dig\ninto that further that's very helpful\nthank you for sharing that\nokay\nokay so this is what I'm gonna say okay\nso I there's this idea of intrinsic\nvalue which is value about like who you\nare and then there's extrinsic value\nthere's like the value that the world\nshows you okay and and so somewhere\nalong the way you started like needing\nthat at like you felt like you don't\nhave intrinsic value like your sense of\nlike what you bring to the table is\ndependent on your performance so this is\nlike like you know so I'm a doctor so\nit's kind of like a doctor saying you\nknow whether I'm a good doctor or bad\ndoctor sort of depends on how many lives\nI save or don't save which makes sense\nright like if I'm I mean if you think\nabout it like a good doctor is someone\nwho saves a lot of lives but it's subtle\nmakes sense I'm not saying it's\nillogical at all yes and I think there's\nsomething weird that happens so when you\nplay so when you rise and you have a\ncertain level of value and then you play\npoorly and twitch hat doesn't leave you\nsomething funny happens you feel\nuncomfortable yeah because they are not\nsending you signals that are consistent\nwith the way that you you see yourself\nyou're like why are these why are these\n[ __ ] people watching this show they\ndon't know they don't like this is\nshitty like I'm performing terribly and\nthen what you have to do is you have to\ncreate the reality that you feel which\nis that you have to since they're like\nso imagine you're on stage and there are\na lot of people watching and you're\nbombing on stage right like you're doing\na terrible job but like no one's leaving\nthe theater and then what happens is\nlike put them yes put the big amount of\nit I just blow in the mic yep no and and\nthen you take like it you go backstage\nand you take a sack of like rotten fruit\nand then you start throwing at people\nyeah and then and then they start\nleaving and then you feel good about\nyourself because at least then they are\ndoing what they're supposed to do it's\nexactly they're supposed to leave\nbecause I'm shitty like why aren't they\nleaving and then what you do then it's a\nsystem you understand right because then\neveryone has left and then there's one\ndude in the theatre and then you're like\nokay I can\nI'm back and then Feliz arises from the\natrás you pick up the microphone you\nstart making jokes you start performing\nagain and then people start coming back\nand you're like okay okay this is okay\nthis is okay because then you know what\nyou're what you're offering them is good\nbecause they're coming in the door yeah\nright yeah it's so like let's just think\nabout that like what do you think about\nthat man um I think it's a route to\nfailure but it's also a road success\nabsolutely so success and failure is one\nthing okay we're not talking about\nsuccess in failure\nI mean we can but what I'm talking about\nis value I'm not talking about the\nexternal world what I'm saying the weird\nthing here is that when you're on stage\nand you feel like you're bombing those\npeople want to stay yeah what do you\nthink about that it it's it's almost\ndiscomforting it's it's odd it's very\ndiscomforting what is that discomfort\nwhat are you feeling like I said I think\nI'm I'm telling them like I'm wasting\ntheir time I feel like I've gotta sign\nfor something and they're not getting it\nand you're sticking around to like the\npotential Idid love it it will happen\nyeah so sure I understand like because\nbecause once again if you think they're\nsticking around for the potential it\ncould happen but that's because you\nbelieve they're sticking around because\nof your performance right like it's like\nyou think that your value is based on\nyour performance which makes a lot of\nsense because your life has been one\nwhere I imagine I mean I think you're\npretty good at overwatch right yeah I'm\nsomebody yeah so if you're really good\nat overwatch then you've been taught\nthat your success is correlated with\nyour performance\nabsolutely and but here's the thing\nright like so here's the funny thing\nabout twitch is that there are a lot of\npeople here who are very very good and\nand also like but I don't think that\nthat's that it's not just skill that\nmakes you good I mean successful on\ntwitch right there's something there's\nsomething that streamers have which\nconnect with like this is the really\ncool thing for as a psychiatrist I see\nthis it's like really fascinating if\nthere's something about you there's\nsomething intrinsic about who you are\nthat like resonates with people in your\naudience like they connect to you in\nsome way and that's not just because\nyou're good because they're all like\nwhat if you just think about it you know\nthere are lots of good overwatch players\nout there and maybe some of them scream\nmaybe some of them don't but there are a\nlot of good people who stream but I\nthink the crazy thing here is somewhere\nalong the way you lost like you can't\nfathom that someone would stay on the\nstage if you're playing back I mean\nsomeone would stay in the audience and\nsay in their seats if you're playing bad\non stage and I think that if you want to\nstop self sabotaging like first of all\nlike because that's what you're doing\nright when you when you start going and\nyou just you know you push them out and\nthen the problem is that it reinforces\neven though it shouldn't because like it\nreinforces this idea that your value\ncomes from bringing people in the door\nbut the real thing is if you really look\nat it scientifically clearly that's not\nwhere your value comes from because when\nyou play bad people don't leave but\nyou're just ignoring that data point\nyeah because\nI feel like in that mystery moment like\nI care about being good I care about\nbeing a competitor I care about\noutperforming I care about like rolling\nin my game like in that state of mind\nlike I don't it seems kind of like an\nodd to say I don't care that much about\nabout twitch I don't care that much\nabout about your numbers I care about\nbeing good yes so I think that makes\nperfect sense but then the question is\nthere's a part of you so I think that's\nexactly what you should care about right\nlike you should care about going on\nstage and just giving the best of what\nyou can get the problem is that clearly\nthere is a part of your mind that cares\nabout more than that okay because if\nthat's all you cared about like let's\nsay you're on stage and you're juggling\nand you drop a ball or something right\nif all you care about is being better\nyou're just gonna pick up the ball and\nkeep juggling and whether people say or\npeople go you don't care because you're\nfocused on the juggling in fact I think\nthat there is something in you that\nisn't it can because but that's not what\nhappens is you put it you shave off\nyours so clearly there's a part of you\nthat cares about something else there's\na part of you that cares about being a\ngood juggler and there's a part of you\nthat cares about being seen is a good\njuggler you don't want people to see\nyour failure that's that's accurate\nthat's good that's true that that was a\ngood mental development I didn't think\nabout anything about the way I always\nsee it like I said one sided thing yeah\nright and that's not wrong because I\nthink you're you're a smart guy Felix\nand you know that part of yourself but\nif we look at your behavior there's\nsomething else it's not that you're\nwrong it's that it's incomplete and now\nwe get to the idea of like when did you\nso now I want to thoughts questions can\nI keep going no that's all good\nso so so let's think about this when did\nyou start caring about because you're\nnot a guy who usually cares about\nappearances right no really\nso when can you remember a time where\nthat changed when did you start caring\nlike this could it could be like a small\nand insignificant thing like maybe you\nwere growing up or something like that\noh well say never appearances I don't I\ncertainly I cared that much appearances\nas in what because I was always like I\ndon't know go ahead\nlike was there a time that you remember\nkind of feeling but not necessarily\nphysical appearances but that like you\nkind of feel I mean this is such a\ngeneric question everyone's gonna have\nthis but you know we're a time where you\nkind of felt like super ashamed of the\nway that you were perceived that you\nfelt like other people saw you as a\nfailure\nmmm I look back at it I mean that's\ngonna be true of everyone my question is\ndoes anything jump to your mind so let\nme put it this way so you know when when\nyou're when you're playing poorly and\npeople are sticking around and you feel\ndiscomfort can you remember feeling that\ndiscomfort in other scenarios outside of\nstreaming and gaming yeah there was this\nwhere people should be leaving and they\nshould be calling you a piece of [ __ ]\nbut they didn't and I had this um had\nthis thing a long time ago where I had\nto I would I was good at doing\ntrampoline right and the people at my\ngym saw it and they wanted me to compete\nright mm-hmm because I could do tricks\nthat other people couldn't so I started\ntraining and refining the moves whatever\nand then I had to compete in like some\nsome weird suit I didn't like any of it\nI didn't like it the weirdness of\ncompeting I like more the organic action\nof it yeah so the present that I'm just\ndoing the trick for the sake of doing\nthe trick right not trying to win yeah\nexactly yeah or make it perfect make it\nlook perfect whatever like that that\nprofession of the craft wasn't really oh\nnow it's a like ninja\nline unbelievable where my my dad won on\nlike a date and I this competition or\nwhatever and you were like oh you know\nwe're gonna go watch you I was like dude\nhell yeah man I'm gonna I'm gonna roll\nyou know cuz I'm better than all these\nkids so I show up there and my moves are\nlike way better\nI'm objectively if I just do whatever\nI'm doing all the time my normal like\nroutine I I witness and I show up and I\nbombed super harder but first Rick lens\nI onto the side and then I jump sideways\nlike Ivan fall and then the second\nattempt rolls around and it's even worse\nright\nand it's like everybody didn't say just\nquiet right or like I stop with it's\nover or like when she thought it's over\nand it's just completely quiet anybody's\nlooking I'm like oh my god like I I\ncan't believe and my dad's on a date\nright and I know he's out there and I'm\nlike this is unbelievable and that was\nlike really really bad and I ended up\nquitting I'm done with competing like\nI'm just never gonna fit again yeah that\nwas one of those moments\nand what did your dad say um he always\nlike pushing to compete and everything\nso a lot of times like you know in in in\nother scenarios when I was young about\nmore than I would compete you'd be like\nyou know it's okay man good job good job\nbut that was so embarrassing that it was\nkind of like it's a scam and like you\nknow there it is hold on a second\nso when you perform badly and he says\ngood job that's people not leaving the\naudience yeah great so when your dad\nwould say good job I want you to think\nback and really remember how did you\nfeel when he said good job after you\nknow you did a bad job that's very\nimportant for me what in what way when\nyou [ __ ] up and your dad said good job\nthen he saw the value in me trying it\nmatters that um you know I I fell once\nand used to buy me and I'll have to fall\nagain so sense like almost like failing\ntwice else so you felt very supported by\nhim yeah by saying you did a good job\nyeah did you feel ashamed um kinda like\non the fence you got like a in the gray\narea where you like you failed once and\nyou feel like if if you have feedback\nthat you failed them then you failed\ntwice right so being like in on edge\nabout like how much of a failure this is\nand then singing like support you and\nthey go good job can I make sure okay\nyou know it's not it's not that bad yeah\nso I'm actually so that's interesting\nthat wasn't the answer I was expecting\nfrom that story but well let's let me\njust think for okay so the interesting\nthing is that so it sounds like he was\nsupportive but it also\nsounds like it doubles the pressure on\nyou yeah to win the second time yeah and\nthe interesting thing is that in a weird\nway that actually sounds like winning\npeople back right so like let me just\nlet me just give you man this is so hard\nto wrap my head around but I'm gonna try\nto say it and it may not make sense so\nso I'm just trying to think about okay\nlike when you it's like it's almost like\nyour dad giving you feedback and then\nyou winning after that is like you\ngetting your rank back after losing rank\nyeah does that make sense\nyeah or getting at least a part of it\nthat getting a part of it back right\nit's like it's not that fail like you\nhave no problem dropping ranks what\nbothers you is like dropping a rank and\nnot getting it back yeah but also losing\neven more because of my projected rank\nin his mind or something yeah that's\nexactly what we need to talk about okay\nright so where do you get the idea of\nlike what his projected like I mean I\nhate to be so [ __ ] generic isn't it\nyou know use the psychiatry term but\nlike it is your dad proud of you um yeah\nmaybe I don't know in what times though\nlike when he what\nproud proud I can tell when he when he\nwhen he's proud to be nice I can also\ntell right and I feel like like as you\nkind of grow older I feel like yeah I\ndon't know I know how to put this I feel\nlike when I was young I needed him more\nto be proud than today I thought now I\nfeel like more more like places where I\nget like validation or that more like\nwhy I get way did you do it can you tell\nme what I just need a second I'm sorry\nkeep going\nuh-oh I'm saying wrong or like uh\nsomething over I don't know no I think\nit's I think it's like exactly what\nwe're looking for it's just it's taken\naback by your answer right because what\nI'm hearing from you is sometimes that's\nwhat I'm hearing but there's well yeah\nthere's a lot there because I mean you\njust said that you needed like the time\nthat you needed him to be proud of you\nwas when you were younger which is also\nlike that implies that he wasn't yeah\nthat's a powerful statement to make and\nthen the last thing is that like you\nknow generally speaking like as a parent\nyou know I mean a complicated answer to\nthe question is your dad proud of you is\nsort of like a no right so that means\nthat on some level like it's complicated\nin your mind it's still muddy it hasn't\nbeen resolved and it's certainly not a\nyes yeah and if we think a little bit\nabout it I mean I think that that's like\nthat's what we have to look into I mean\nI feel like okay so let's just take a\nstep back and let me walk you through my\nreasoning okay sure so we talked about\nimposter syndrome we talked about\nself-sabotage we talked about not living\nup to expectations there's this idea\nthat like you let people down and make\ntheir capacity to have intrinsic pride\nand you is a person when they do that it\nconfuses the [ __ ] out and then what you\ndo is you create a\nsituation where they're proud of you but\ntheir pride in you makes sense because\nyou are proud in yourself as well yeah\nthe problem arises when you feel ashamed\nof yourself and they don't connect with\nyou there they're like not calling you a\npiece of [ __ ] when they should be\ncalling you a piece of [ __ ] but instead\nwhat they do is they send you love and\nsupport and that's just really odd and\nconfusing to you so then you change the\nsystem up to where you feel comfortable\nwith in it and the way that you feel\ncomfortable is by winning again like\nwhat makes you uncomfortable is when\npeople care about you and you're losing\nso you just like you're like okay I'm\ngonna lose and then I'm gonna push them\nout the door and then I'm gonna win and\nthen they've loved you all along the\nonly difference is that like sometimes\nyou love yourself and you create systems\nwhere you can love yourself and then\ntheir love for you which is constant\nmakes more [ __ ] sense does that make\nsense\nmm-hmm the next question becomes where\nthe [ __ ] does this come from\nlike what like why is it so damn\ncomplicated right why can't you just be\nloved by twitch at like that's kind of\nthe end of it yeah and and one that it's\nso then like usually that's learned okay\nso it's not like you're busted in some\nway it's just like like we learned that\nright and so then the issue is I mean\nthen the issue is like you know who in\nyour life taught you that you don't have\nintrinsic value because kids start out\nkind of like narcissistic and\negotistical and they think they're the\nwonderful most wonderful people in the\nworld and then someone comes along and\nsort of tells them that you know your\nvalue too so like you were taught\nsomething which is that your value as a\nhuman being depends on performance yeah\nyeah sure I was there on whatever set\nyeah so who taught you that my dad\ntaught me that okay okay\nright so there we go right so so I don't\neven that was too easy\nhold on oh yeah I mean I can pinpoint it\nit's not like it's like a logical tell\nme tell me tell me about that just tell\nme about your dad\nyou know teaching you that lesson I mean\nthat was\nyou always want me to compete and I was\nlooking better I was Lilly's a very\ncompetitive when I was young with my\nwith my brother or like I kinda knew\nthat fire and he wanted me to compete in\nthings that I didn't really care about\nbut since you know when we were young\nlike I don't really have like passions\nfor like a crazy amount of things so if\nyou if you wants that oh maybe it's cool\njust do it right I did it it's not like\nhe forced me to I mean if he did that it\nwouldn't be much of his defense for me\nso let's let's think for a second if you\ndidn't like it and he wanted you to\ncompete why did you do it if he didn't\nforce you Oh we'll take your animals\nlearn like like skiing I used to do like\ncompetitive skiing right and I didn't\neven like it that much\nIII thought was gonna boring the way you\nlook like this and I thought was trash\nbut he cared about a lot and all his\nfriends like all had kids that that\nwould that would compete and I just kind\nof had to show up and I would roll them\nbut I didn't really care about it why\ndid you do it\num because about that long meet you so\nwhat were you looking for when you roll\nthem what would your dad how would you\nlook at you what would he say I mean\nhe'd be super proud when I would win and\nI would I know I read a lot so to be\nproud all the time right\nand how did that make you feel I'm gonna\nfeel good like I'm when I on both ends\nwhatare to ends well\nwhen add at the computing so I get like\nthe Val vision like oh you're ranked 1\nor whatever and then did you care about\nthat yeah of course\nok even if I don't care about what it is\nif I win it still matters ok sometimes\neven more than what the action is itself\nok\nright sure but like if that doesn't mean\nnobody cares about like like Dora and\nlike the rank 1 speedrunner it's still\nstill feels good\nsure I'm reg Warren okay and what was\nwinning on the other side he said\nactually winning isn't I mean it and\nthen and then he he's proud of me then\nIII since he he's like a like a\ncompetent mind sets like I know that he\ncares that I win so I win and for myself\nand I went for him too\nthat's gonna double win hmm both ends\nyeah so what I'm hearing didn't did your\ndad how would he treat you if you lost\num I guess it depends in what field but\nI guess he still he still feel pretty\ngood I suppose yeah I I I think I think\nyou still gave me that validation even\nwhen I didn't do well and did you know\nhe was do you think he was being genuine\nat those times or you think he was\ndisappointed in you I think so\nno I don't I don't I really feel like\nyou feel disappointed in my competing he\ndid or did not did not I don't think he\nI don't think he ever felt like that and\nhave that it's not even like that like\nit it just happened a lot like um like\ncompeting like for myself but for him\nalso like if there's a bunch of times I\ncompeted in like a skiing biking some\nsome other [ __ ] like like it would\nhappen by commonly you know how old were\nyou when you were competing and skiing\nand biking I guess I'd be like 10 and\nthen maybe like 13 12 and in that\nsounded like you didn't really like\nthose sports right no I didn't like him\nthat much especially especially biking\nbecause my bike sucked it was just trash\nright ask vegans kids dad like like\nmulti-thousand dollar bikes or whatever\nand then that's like a long story but my\nchain like I could be close to winning\nand it might change elevate would would\nfall off and had to physically get up\nand and put it back on both on both ends\nright and then go back again and I just\nfelt cheated all the time when I lost I\ngot at the end and I lost like did I\ndidn't have a chance he oh this this\n[ __ ] sucks like [ __ ] these guys you\nguys you guys are balls you're not even\ngood at the sport man she might I can't\ngive me a get a working by deal yeah\nyeah and what happened at the end of the\nrace what did your dad say\ncrowd but I I would never like hold it\nagainst them like they don't have a good\nbut I couldn't airily I mean like that\nfor me there was no other tool that I\ncould have like that was my tool and it\nwas trash you know just make it work\nright yeah but he was proud anyway like\nyou'd still I give me that that that\nvalidation of like and then he still it\nis it a pretty good like I'm like I'm\nglad you did it or something or\nyeah champion is your dad proud of you\nodd I don't throw the ball on stream but\nyeah I don't think so yeah I don't think\nso either\nso the notion is why why do you feel\nthat way I think because he he has\nthings that he wants me to do well in\nand and those things I don't do well or\nnever cared enough to do well and he is\nsort of interested it doesn't shift just\nguys stayed there how does that make you\nfeel\nit makes me see that values and vision\nelsewhere and find and build systems\nwhere I get it there did you understand\nthat before this conversation not really\nokay because that's absolutely the\nanswer very well said\nokay right so like the fuel for your\nsystem brilliant actually Felix could\nthat's the point that I'm moving towards\nbut that only is true if your dad is not\nproud right and like that's where like\nit's a hard thing like how do you feel\nsaying the words out loud that you're\nafraid that your dad may not be proud of\nyou because I'm not sorry that he's not\nproud of you for the record but like how\ndoes it feel to say that I feels kind of\nodd because I feel like um your parents\nare kind of like a big part like you\nknow you got this big puzzle whatever\nand you know it has like a thousand\npieces\nor all the pieces that are like you're\nyour parents are like that like huge\nones in the middle that the ones that\nyou should care about the ones that are\nthat matter the most step right yeah but\nlike what makes you think you don't\nmatter about but what will you care do\nyou don't care about them or they don't\nmatter how are you getting that boy so I\nsaid that again so you just said those\nare the puzzle pieces that should matter\nthe most\nyeah when you say should matter the most\nit implies that they don't matter the\nmost so why do you think that your\nparents don't matter well now they\nmatter but now the since I've build\nthose systems they're their input and\ndivision is kind of irrelevant yes and\nabsolutely not so you're you're a\nhundred percent correct that you have\ncreated systems that will satisfy the\nhunger that your parents left you with\nmm-hmm but the goal here at least in my\nmind is to like is to be free of those\nsystems because those systems [ __ ]\ntorture you okay right so like there's a\npart there's a there's a there's a world\nI want you to imagine Felix where you\nplay because you want to be the best not\nbecause you need validation and I know\nyou know\nbut you play for the purpose of\nschooling those noobs but yeah that's\nenough but then what you have is this\nwhole other layer on it where like you\nneed the validation like it's not about\nlike cuz this goes back to like you know\nyou there's a moment where you want to\njuggle just for the sake of juggling but\nyou do care so my whole point is that if\nyou want to live the life that you\nreally want to live which is to focus on\njuggling in schooling news for the sake\nof schooling news you've got to let go\nof caring about other people and I know\nthat you do that like 90% of the time\nand they're like 10 percent of the time\nthis weird [ __ ] happens in your mind\nyou're not even sure what's happening\nand you're looking for validation and\nthen you use these phrases\nyou know you're discouraged impostor\nsyndrome self-sabotage like that's not a\nlife that you need to be living man it's\nnot a life I want you to live I want you\nto all the life yeah go ahead\nokay I want that life to like whatever\nyou're gonna say like I would probably\nhundred say it would by omegan lessons\ncuz your logical and but at the same\ntime sometimes I convinced myself of\nlike bad mental loops whatever and I'm\nlike hey man this thing is maybe not\nlike a like I had like a healthy mindset\nbut it just kind of works I'm just gonna\ndestroying that some way if I lose that\nand it's trash been away so this is a\nconch problem okay so like there's this\nidea that caring and I mean like I feel\nlike I'm talking to Pokemon so like like\nif you watch the video from her she she\nactually calls it a whip\nso she whips herself and she's a friend\nlike to be the best and and she\noptimizes a lot of stuff in in her like\nshe's always an optimizer and she always\nstrives to be the best and then she's\nalso really confused cuz all you guys\nare confused and then like I work with a\nlot of executives and things like that\nall those guys are confused too how can\nyou continue to perform if you abandon\nyour current system and the answer is\nyou absolutely can it it's and and that\nbecomes that that's a conversation about\nanother Sun script concept called\nVairagya which means detachment and and\nwe can kind of go down there but I want\nto kind of\nthis thing with your dad if that's okay\nnow go ahead so the short answer is that\nyou can be successful by not caring\nabout other people or even success\nsuccess comes from you picking up the\nballs that you're juggling and trying to\ndo better than you did the last time it\nhas nothing to do with whether you think\nyou're a good person\nhas nothing to do whether other people\nthink you're a good person and that is\nwhat success depends upon so you can\nabandon the rest of all of your\npsychological [ __ ] in your systems and\nwhatever and as long as every time you\npick up a ball I mean every time you\ndrop a ball you pick it up and you try\nto do better the next time you're gonna\nbe successful what do you think about\nthat [ __ ] myself ins yeah so you don't\nneed any of the rest of this crap that I\nknow you're comforted in because those\nare the systems that you've developed\nfor yourself and so you've come to rely\non those but you can let go of those and\nas long as like because at the end of\nthe day you could care about what other\npeople think and not focus on becoming a\nbetter juggler and then like you've seen\nthose streamers right the streamers that\njust care about what other people think\nand don't focus on it wouldn't in just\nsay build it a craft or whatever perfect\ntheir craft like yeah it's perfection of\nthe craft that leads to success in life\nits devotion to the thing that you are\ndoing that leads to success not anything\nelse anyway so we can talk about that\nlater but kind of coming back to your\nyour I mean I think we got a I mean I\nthink we got to figure out like you know\nwhat's the deal with your dad and pride\nlike why don't you think your dad is\nproud of you and there are good reasons\nthat you think that because he hasn't\nconveyed that to you sufficiently I have\nsome hypotheses but well I'm mmm glide\nand then because if I if he doesn't feel\nit and that I want him to convey if he\ndoesn't feel like it if he doesn't feel\nlike he if he doesn't she's not proud of\nme about something I want to give me the\ndesign that they he is I feel like\nthat's misleading yeah I completely\nagree but then the question is like why\nisn't he practice\n[Music]\nah I feel like he wants and wanted me to\nperform and certain things that I didn't\nperform in like like schooling like some\nof the sport that he'd want me to do\nlike when I quit skiing I'm just no\nboarding and I stopped competing I mean\nI come in other ways like that's kinda\nlike how he wanted me to have success\neven though I even even if I found\nsuccess in other ways it's still not in\nhis like model without he shies it and I\nfeel like not achieving that it's kind\nof like it doesn't make him very proud\nokay\nthings were like it yeah I like\nschooling you always want me to do well\nin school I can I can I could never care\nokay um yeah alright two questions so\nthe first thing that I want to toss out\nto use that I I think I wonder why he\ncares so much about you being successful\nis he's successful\nprideful can you tell me about that um\nwell you know like\nI feel like I like a brother and\nyeah I I took mushroom for my dad and he\ndid like my brother doesn't mean yeah\nlike like an ego like a crazy over\ncompetitive spirits like isn't there\nlike that prideful right isn't like as\nlike self-centered like I took like all\nthat from my dad how do you feel about\nthat taking all those things from your\ndad\ngood and bad these are like double-edged\nswords almost all of them it's right\nanswer\nthese things [ __ ] you over but these\nthings make you could sometimes also\nsometimes I'm okay with like the\ndownsides these I also get the upside so\nI am NOT I'm not that much allowed to be\nupset about it by the way where is your\nmom in AAPIs my mom's always there for\nme in whatever I want but it's not as\n[Music]\nintense you tell me about your mom\nwell it's cool she's just not\nin tents and things if she wants me to\ndo something she wants me to be good at\nsomething\num if I fail her if I do her good\nlike any good or bad isn't intense hmm\nand I was really raised with intensity\nso is your mom proud of you yeah\nso it's interesting right because like\nwhen I asked you is your mom proud you\ncan say yes and I know you've sort of\nsaid already that your dad is a you're\nconcerned that he may not be proud cuz\nyou didn't you didn't become the thing\nthat he wanted you to be hmm\nright that's this we'll talk about that\nin a second but I just I think it's\ninteresting how how complex your answer\nis when it comes to your dad and how\nsimple your answer is when it comes to\nyour mom and and I wonder if there's a\nparallel to be drawn between when you're\nplaying when you're when you're playing\npoorly and people in the audience are\nsticking around and they're not leaving\nif that's your mom yeah and then I mean\nbut like I said it's it's I think for me\nI think I'm trying like this is kind of\nhard because it's very introspective\nright yeah I try think of the root\ncauses my thoughts is that like I said\nit's like I think it's really all about\nthe intensity it's like how how like May\ndisappointed or mad emmaandemma devil\nget if I didn't perform in him well you\nwant me to do well in and I'm happy he\nwas and how proud that he was when I\nwould do well as with my mom even if she\nwas really proud of me maybe the way she\nexpressed that what even though she was\nextremely excited wasn't as as deep or\nas intense but it's kind of hard to\ncompete because my dad is extremely\nintense so my mom was like above average\nin terms of intensity my dad was like\nway way way above average so she can\ncompete so what I'm hearing actually is\nlike I'm gonna toss something out called\ncontingent love so like it feels to me\nlike your dad's love was like contingent\nlike it depended on certain things\nwhereas your mom sounds like it wasn't\nquite as dependent like it so maybe\nanother way to put it is that your dad's\nlove was conditional and your mom's love\nwas unconditional okay that's a bit of a\ndark thought but yep it could make sense\nyeah yeah I mean what's dark about that\nthat's a strong word it's all yeah\nconditional that's a strong it's a\nstrong word how did how does it make you\nfeel to hear it\npants and throw them in the under the\nbus and hold them to such labels fare so\nlet's talk about that for a second\nmm-hmm so a lot of times I will use\nstrong words to amplify what is low in\nthe person I'm talking to for the record\nI think it sounds like your parents are\namazing and wonderful people and I think\nthey've done it sounds like a good job\nraising you I'm not hearing any kind of\nabuse or any kind of [ __ ] like that I\nthink this is just how human beings work\nlike so I think my parents were\nwonderful as well but I still had\nhang-ups so can I tell you a story no no\nso when I was let me just think about\nwhere to start this story\nso when I was finishing up my my\ntraining in in Boston I had done a\nreally good job so I was like I\ndistinguish myself in some ways and and\nwas it a pretty competitive kind of\ninstitution where there are a lot of\nbright people and so I had kind of\ndistinguished myself and then I had a\nmentor who had been supporting me for\nlike six years and started to become\nkind of paranoid that like I'd created\nthis thing and I was like afraid that he\nwas gonna like take it over and I had\nsome reason to believe that but like I\nkind of thought that this was something\nthat [ __ ] I don't want to go into the\nstory more um would like a precision I\nkind of felt like I missed a part of the\nstory sure you were doing well better\nthan some of the bright people whatever\nand then you and then what and then I\ngot paranoid that one of my mentors was\ngonna take credit for my work\noh so what I had done is I created a\nprogram so I'd created something called\na consult service where people with\nmental health problems could come and\nlearn like meditation and use herbs and\nand other kinds of like Eastern stuff to\nhelp with their anxiety and their\ndepression and it was going very very\nwell because a lot of people are\ninterested in that and it works really\nwell and I was afraid that one of my\nmentors would basically take over that\nprogram which I had essentially built\nfrom the ground up and it was really\nweird because the guy had been nothing\nbut supportive and so I was doing some\nkind of introspective work and actually\nlearning a particular kind of therapy at\nthat time and as part of learning that\ntherapy I had to do my own I would like\nwas kind of playing the role of the\npatient so I was examining my own issues\nand so we came up with this issue for me\nto work on and what I realized that is\nthat like this fear that someone who has\nbeen nothing but supportive is gonna\ntake away what I built actually comes\nfrom my childhood and when I was 13\nyears old this is back before the\ninternet was a thing or even younger\nthere used to be these things called\nbulletin board systems BBS's and back\nbefore there was a centralized internet\nwhat happened is you had a phone line\nand you would connect to one other\ncomputer through\na phone line and so what I did is a mic\nmy computer was a server that I hosted\ngames on and then like there would be\nall these kids at school who would dial\ninto my computer and use my server to\ntake their turns in the game and then\nlike 30 kids would play like this\nawesome game called barren realms elite\nwhich is still an awesome game so it's\nkind of like it's kind of like Clash of\nKings and stuff now it's sort of like\nyou take your turn every day you spend\nresources you build armies you attack\nother people and it's like compare like\nyou're like Travie I know whatever you\nknow that was that no yes whatever\nthat's so so but back then like so so\nnot so we had two phone lines at my home\nso I hosted the server and then what I\nwould do is charge 10 bucks a week for\npeople to get access to my server and it\nbecame like a super popular thing and I\nwas making like 300 bucks a week and\nlike that was a lot of money back in\nlike 1990 officer and and so you know I\ncreated this thing and then like the\nfunny thing is like my parents were I'm\nlucky I'm the son of two physicians so\nmy parents like had a big house and like\nthey basically bought me whatever I\nwanted I didn't need any money so I was\nlike making money and I was making money\nbut sake and making money and I didn't\nhave any way to spend it because like if\nI wanted something that would just get\nit for me or what I mean they would get\nit for me if my grades and stuff we're\ngood and so like one day like like my\ndad found this gigantic wad of cash and\nhe was like what is this and and then I\nwas like well I stole it and he was like\nI'm ballin dude I was like no man I he's\nlike you didn't steal it\nhe's like what is this and he's like I\ntold him I like I was like I started a\nbusiness and I'm making a bunch of money\nand so then what he did is he took the\nmoney away and he shut down the business\nand he said you've got to focus on your\nstudies like he was actually like proud\nof me because he like knew that I was an\nentrepreneur and all that kind of crap\nso he was like kind of proud but he also\nlike shut it off right like he did what\nwhat I mean I think is reasonable for a\nparent to do which is to say like you\nshould really be focusing on studying\nlike you should do what I think you\nshould do instead of doing what you\nthink you should do sound familiar with\nyour dad by the way and I yep yeah and\nand then like I realized that in some\nways like\nthat left a psychological imprint my dad\nwas like a great person and he loved me\na lot and he was a great guy but if you\njust listened to me talk about that\nstory and how it affected me today\nthat's where my paranoia was born that\nsomeone who cares about me and it's a\nvery specific pattern it's as someone\nwho cares about me like is gonna take\naway what I've built okay right it\ndoesn't make him a bad person it's just\nlike that's what happens because our\npsychology is imperfect and young minds\nare impressionable and like they don't\nunderstand the complexity of what our\nparents send us yeah okay so we're good\nwell III have some of that then tell me\nI think I can't think of something like\nvery much in the past much more\nsomething they kind of kind of recent in\nyou know a time we're like I'm looking\nfor that validation or I'm looking for\nthat effect and and I didn't get it and\nit kind of like didn't mark me but kind\nof did I just swap because I used to\nplay another game on the stream and then\nI had swapped this new game over watch\nand I was trimming it and as we good at\nthe game\nbut I suppose shimmy it a lot right I'd\nput like a lot of hours and I was\nenjoying myself a lot sometime\nno I care about being good me whatever I\nstill get out the stream a lot cuz you\nknow I wanted stream to feel like it's\ngoing forward just like my rank and\nmight my plane like pedigree or career\norder and isn't your heart first because\nmy guess what my guess was really bad\nit's the it's still it's not the best\nbut I just felt like I want to do that\nin English cuz I used to in French and\nthat's what I want to do and I want to\ndo good and then I just felt like\nthere's no way there's no I could I\ncould never do it who would listen to\nsome guy who doesn't speak English\nproperly and I just felt like can't like\nthe world's against me to have a thing\nbut I still did it and I would get like\nsmall milestones like oh man look today\nwe you know we had like two shells or\nsomething and after a while after like a\ncrazy not like grind if you want or\nwhatever I got this uh it was like\nChristmas there's something and I had a\ntotal like I think it was 212 subs I\nremember he was like 220 h1 to 12 or\nsomething and I was like I cannot\nbelieve it I think I've just peaked or\nsomething like I've plateaued like this\nis this is it this is like holy [ __ ] I\ncan't believe that two hundred people\nwould subscribe my channel did it and\nthey don't know it's like I'm saying you\nknow and then I finished you off and I\nhad to go to this time\nwas anymore so I had to go to this\nChristmas party right so I should I show\nup like like 10 minutes later so think\nthat's you know I was trimming an adult\nI rushed there and I'll talk to my dad a\nlittle bit and family and then I took my\ndad I'm like yeah you wouldn't believe\nit like today like I against all these\nother people that are like competing you\nknow like I had I had this many subs or\nwhatever and I had this much value to my\nchannel well that's crazy and then you\nkind of just can just look me like the\ndeciding she kind of said it okay so\nwhen does that make you go back to\nschool I'm like [ __ ] man\nthey just kind of crush me you know\nnonsense makes a lot of sense yeah\nthat's crushing\nfelt like it wouldn't matter like what\nthe numbers would be at I felt like that\nwas like a crazy number even though it\ndidn't matter there's any any direction\nin that path any any Heights it wouldn't\nmatter it'd be irrelevant that's why I\nstart making those systems like the\nviolations from other forms because I\nplay wasn't getting it there you know\nyeah I think it goes a little bit I mean\nthat's rough man I'm I got emotional\nhearing that because I think the only\nwhere that was going\nbut yeah I think so\nso here's the thing Felix don't don't\nget distracted yeah\nwhat are you you're looking on no no no\nit's a guy's stuff I know okay yeah so I\nthink here's the problem you say that\nyou needed to create systems of\nvalidation because you weren't getting\nvalidation from your dad I think the\nissue here is it's not validation that\nyou weren't getting from your dad it is\nfundamental sense of value okay does\nthat make sense like there's a\ndifference doesn't right so like that\nwas the moment that instead of your\nvalue as a human being here it came down\nover here because here you were proud of\nyourself and you said look I did\nsomething I'm proud\nI accomplished something and then you\nwere up here and then your dad moved you\ndown here in that moment that's when so\nthat's not validation it's it's devalued\nand then you need validation to fill\nthat gap mm-hmm but before that moment I\ndon't know that you needed any\nvalidation does that make sense yeah so\na validation like the problem with\nvalidation is that like your intrinsic\nsense of value and now we kind of go\nback to the beginning of the\nconversation is like you know impostor\nsyndrome is because you don't believe\nthat the person on stage deserves to be\nthere it's a statement of intrinsic\nvalue and then you need validation\nbecause that's the only way you can get\nback up because\nbelieve you you're starting down here\nright it's the [ __ ] bike with the\nbroken chain your whole life it's a bike\nwith a broken [ __ ] chain yeah that\nmight is and that's like that's sad bro\nis that this is the life yeah because\nthe thing is you don't have a broken\nchain you you are a thousand dollar bike\npawn yeah\nbut you don't see yourself that yeah I\ngrew that in that sin\nhow's that feeling yeah\nwe're going that I don't know I have\nlike it isn't really if I don't want to\nlike oversell myself it doesn't really\ntake me a lot to go on right like it\ndoes really like to like do well or do\nbetter or improve like there aren't like\na lot of requirements that I need to to\nto go in and do [ __ ] it's an expense\nyeah I want it yeah I feel more\nfulfilled if I get it\nbut is it sometimes I feel like I'm more\nlike solid on that without trying to\nlike you know sound like a high go Andy\nor something no no I don't think it's\nhigh ego but let me let me put it I\nthink it's a problem buddy\nyeah I think so why do you think it's a\nproblem hmm I feel like maybe it makes\nme like settle settle for Less or\nsomething I'm like in a certain way in\nme and makes me like be okay with like\ntrash yeah absolutely\nso I well I'm gonna put it a different\nway okay so you're not feeling a whole\nlot right now right no why do you think\nit is that other people have difficulty\ngiving their best because you're saying\nthat I don't have difficulty giving my\nbest right mm-hmm well I think other\npeople like what gets in the way about\npeople getting their best\nuh-huh\nI thought about it for a whole minute\nI'm no clue okay so do you feel a whole\nlot of emotions Felix oh I'd say less\nthan average yeah so I think part of\nwhat makes other people makes it hard\nfor other people to give their best is\nthat they've got like internal [ __ ] that\nlike bogs them down okay and I don't\nknow exactly what you mean by settle for\nLess but I think part of you giving it\nyour all lets you forget about a lot of\nthings that are probably I imagine\nhurtful to you and then leave us and I\nthink what we're running up against\nwhich is interesting because what you're\nsaying is like some pretty like you know\nyou'll say the word crushing and then\nthe only sign that you have emotional\nactivation is the amount of distraction\nwhich you have in your face and where\nyour eyes go so the only sign of emotion\nthat I see in you so you can recognize\nthat something is crushing you can\nrecognize these things and you're\nlearning them but you're not feeling\nanything you'll look at your hands\nyou'll get distracted by discord maybe\nit was just escort maybe I'm reading too\nmuch into it I have no idea it's really\nbasically one time over the last however\nlong we've been talking that you've like\nbroken eye contact with your screen in\nlike in a particular moment you kind of\nlike looked at your hands for a second\nyeah and and I don't know so I think\nyou've got feelings down there that are\npushed so far down because you've\nconstructed a system of like being your\nbest self and competing and like I think\nthat you know you can say it was\ncrushing but do you remember how it felt\nwhen you came to your dad and you were\nlike I got 200 subs I've peaked I've\nmade it on Twitch\nyeah I think I'm Ambria I think I yeah\nhow did it feel\n[Music]\nyou still like like\n[Music]\nlike I felt like so ready to to get\nsomething and they're the exact opposite\nyou know sometimes you can like protect\nyourself with like some like\nexpectations or something yeah right\nnothing's pretty much so I don't where\nlike you know like a fishing rod did\nsometimes you know um you know you don't\nexpect much you know you put it like\nclose you know whatever but that was\nlike an i overextended like I'm all in\nmy pool\ny'all know that I know I'm gonna get it\nso Felix went why do we protect\nourselves like that why do we expect so\nlittle from the fishing rod where does\nthat protection come from so like what\nare we tanking what I mean so you're\nsaying you said something about you know\nhaving low expectations and how low\nexpectations are protective yeah okay so\nlike you play over much right so like\nyou know those low expectations are like\nReinhart and his shield and like what's\nbehind Reinhart like what are we what\nare we tanking there\nif those a flow X if you didn't set\nartificially low expectations for\nyourself what would happen more intense\ndisappointment when you don't get it\nabsolutely and even then more intense\ndisappointment is a really cerebral way\nof saying it hurts okay you're\nprotecting yourself from hurt yeah I\ndon't really use those words real often\nyou don't use those words for you\nbad I know yeah so you're hyper\nanalytical and you're LexA thymic what\nAlexa 5ik means is that you're unaware\nof what your internal emotional state is\nand I don't think you like you can use\nwords like crushing you can use physical\nwords right you can use words that are\nlike crushing is like a physical thing\nmm-hmm\nit has a representation in the real\nworld and men do this often it's like\nyou know you can talk like you don't\ntalk about pride or satisfaction you\ntalk about like rolling news Yeah right\nthat's an emotion rolling newbs is like\nit's an emotion but you just don't have\nthe language and everyone understands\nwhat we mean because our whole job\nraishin is like emotionally sunk because\nwe play video games and stuff and like\nwe don't spend time like inside\nourselves it really is and and I think\nthat buddy like so you know I'm gonna\noffer a couple of thoughts because I\ndon't really know exactly what where to\nexplore from here and I kind of want to\nsay so I've also noticed something that\nwhen we explore too far we lose some of\nthe things that we learned at the\nbeginning yeah there's good data to that\nso I'm gonna try to leave you with a\ncouple of thoughts the first thing is I\nthink you've really got to think long\nand hard about you know how you feel\nabout your dad not being proud of you\nmm-hmm and cuz I just don't think that\nyou deserve a life where like your value\nis down here when it's really appear cuz\nyou are a thousand dollar bike you're\nnot and there's a certain amount of like\nyou know underdog pride with with being\ndown here and still achieving up here\nlike I can sympathize with that there's\na some pride in that but I just don't I\njust don't think that like when it comes\nto the self-sabotage and impostor\nsyndrome and all this kind of [ __ ] you\nknow because people people do genuinely\ncare about you I mean I'm making\nassumptions here but I'm pretty sure\nbecause that's what I've seen from\ntwitch at everyone talks about twitch I\nlike that they're toxic but I think that\nthere's like a lot of genuine caring and\nrespect does yeah and and I think I\nthink it's I mean it's it's gotta like\nit's got to be about your dad and by\nabout what I mean is like I think you've\ngot a you know maybe at some point first\nof all figure out how you feel and then\nthen engage your dad I don't know if you\nguys have ever talked about like what\nsuccess means to him and why he cares so\nmuch so the last thing that I want to\nleave you with is that all this [ __ ]\nabout your dad's expectations on you are\nprobably coming from his own sense of\nnot doing good enough because that's\nwhat parents do okay Beckham I could see\nthat right so if he's hyper competitive\nand egotistical and he has a son who is\nfar more successful than he'll ever be\nwhich I don't know if that's true or not\nI don't know how\nsuccessfully is and I really know how\nsuccessful you are like I'm know right\nbut if that thought is in his head that\ncould be difficult for him to sit with\nbut that's not that's not something that\nshould lower your value that's something\nthat he needs to deal with okay why does\nhe need his son to be number one and in\nyeah in in in a realm where that\ncouldn't change then what is it not okay\nto have systems where you where you get\nthat from or other things if you let's\nsay if that all I said was the truth and\nhe couldn't change then what so you're\nabsolutely right so the systems are\nthere for a damn good reason right so\nlike like what I'm yeah so then what\nthen I think you guys accept you breve\nand you move past it and what that means\nis like you know if I'm juggling and I\ndrop a ball then what Felix I'm sure\nabsolutely right so it like like you you\ndon't let that failure stop so if your\ndad like your dad needs to figure out\nlike why he wants his son to be so\nsuccessful like does he derived personal\npride and ego from your successes\ncuz that happens a lot with parents and\nthen the second thing is why can't he\naccept your success for what it is why\ndoes it have to look like his success\nokay that's that's it then you have it\nthen I have what I feel like that\nquestion is is the right one yeah or the\nmost the most fun was that when I had\nout of all exactly and that comes from a\nconversation with him and the cool thing\nis that once you can have that\nconversation with him and you can get\nthe answer that question then you're no\nlonger down here because what put you\ndown here is like his impression of\nwhat's valued mm-hmm then you're back up\nhere and then you're you know you're a\nthousand dollar bike riding a thousand\ndollar bike like that's what you are\nyou're not like a broken chain because\nif we look at your actual performance\nwe see the performance of a thousand\ndollar bike not the performance of a\nbroken chain and that you've\ndemonstrated time and time and time\nagain by schooling noobs and trampoline\nschooling noobs and skiing schooling\nnoobs right and left and center right\nyou're competing with like your dad\nsends you in to compete with kids with\nmulti-thousand dollar bikes and you've\ngot a broken chain you're [ __ ]\nwinning a race and you have to stop and\npull over and reattach me yeah yeah and\nin those moments I felt like I was upset\nthat they wouldn't get when do the\nresults but I was very much like self\nself rewarded and I had a good mint\nmental loop cuz yeah it sucks I don't\nget on the podium but at the same time I\nwas like dude if I had a bike as good as\ntheirs I know like it's not that doesn't\ncome from like over at all you my value\nlike I would have [ __ ] this guy over I\nought to roll them right and and that\nthat thought was enough yeah I'm with\nyou I think ok right so but but the\nproblem here is that you don't think\nthat way about yourself now right you\nthink the opposite mmm probably not yeah\nexactly\nreisen's so like I think and then we\nkind of ask a little bit about won't I\nbecome not successful no absolutely not\nbecause that is actually when you're\nyour truest self it's when you don't\nderive value from an external thing do\nyou see that in that moment you're not\nderiving value from being on stage\nyou're deriving value from a true sense\nof what you're putting in and what\nyou're capable of\nhmm then you don't care about the\naudience and can you be successful\nabsolutely\ntarts questions known as does all this\nOh mittens\nis it overall unhealthy in the\nimmigrants into things like lifestyle to\nto let's say not care about about what\nyour parents think we're like build\nyourself in an environment where you get\nlike a combined other things that make\nup for that let me make up for the mega\nfor their value or their so I think how\nhealthiest thing is done it's not to not\ncare it's to recognize what part of my\nparents value of me is fair and what\npart is unfair okay let me as lessons\nyeah because they're evaluation of you\nis not perfect yeah I think that's a\nproblem where you're growing up you\ncan't really can't really tell tens of\nyour parents they're above you so\nthey're they know [ __ ] but sometimes\nthey do things just like we did like I\ndunno like that we're human right that\nare that are that are wrong but I still\nsee it as right because I don't know any\nbetter so like they play their cards\nperfectly and that's how they really\nfeel\nand I mean but maybe that's how they\nfeel about themselves or some external\nother source right and then actually\nfeel I feel like you kind of build like\njust unhealthy conclusions absolutely\nright so I think the general strategy\nlike so when I say you have to see\nwhat's fair and unfair like you said do\nyou think that they're perfect when\nyou're a child and they're certainly not\nperfect and we don't blame them for that\nright because they also like they're not\nperfect so how can you expect perfection\nfrom them so I think the strategy Felix\nis damage control not perfection it's\nnot being perfect it's in recognizing\nlike so the way for it is to have\nconversations with them well then you\ncan through conversation with them like\nrecognize okay what is my dad saying\nthat's fair and what is he saying that's\nunfair and then once you recognize that\nit's unfair you let it go fine let's go\nit's like that shit's on him like if\nhe's not happy with me having a broken\nchain bike and not winning first place\nlike that's an unreasonable expectation\nand if he doesn't want to be proud of me\nfor that then so be it I'm gonna make my\ncase about why he shouldn't be proud of\nme right I need to explain to him and\nand and then that gives him the\nopportunity to also grow because you're\nnot the only one that needs to do\ngrowing in this relationship\nand it's kind of like a continual\nprocess in the same way that you like\nwake up the next day and you try to be\nbetter that's what both of you guys need\nto do for your relationship and then\nyou'll end up hopefully both being like\nhappy and accepting and loving each\nother and you know he'll be proud of you\nand you'll know that he's genuinely\nproud of you and he can accept that you\naren't him right you're not his perfect\ndream of himself you're you and you have\nyour own [ __ ] that you care about your\nown values and there are parts of you\nthat there are parts of him that live\nwithin you but there are also parts of\nyour mom there are parts of you that are\na little bit more chill there are parts\nof you that say that I'm gonna stop\nskiing and like snowboard because it's\nfun and I'm still gonna do a really good\njob but it's gonna be less intense\nmm-hmm okay in that he needs to judge\nyou for who you are not who he wants you\nto be and even in that you may fall\nshort in some ways he may say okay Felix\nI agree with you that you know you've\nbeen successful and I'm proud of you but\nI still think X Y Z yeah and then for\nyou to say okay dad that's fair that\nisn't fair and then you guys come to an\naccord and that's a healthy relationship\nyeah\nyeah I I think I'm uh I think I'm\ngetting them here I mean I understand\nlike the like the full scope of the full\nscope of things it's almost like at the\nsame time it's kind of like most people\nthat do good on Twitter kind of like\nlike degenerate or I mean I mean not\nmost of us and I will put throws on the\nsame boat it's kinda like almost kind of\nlike being like a failure or something\nyeah being like a bomber right being\nsuch a bomb that is like one of the like\nthings that make you makes you good on\nTwitter something that's also was\nsomething that that doesn't sit well\nyour your parents so I think it's gonna\nweird to be kinda like rewarded for such\nlike that am I getting that is an i\nsense it makes perfect sense and I think\nthere's a there's a difference in value\nbetween the boomer generation in our\ngeneration mm-hmm there's like a\nconversation that needs to be had like\nbasically I mean I have this\nconversation with my parents too about\nlike where value comes from right so she\nhas certain ideas about like what I\nshould be and and we just have to have a\nconversation about like you know some of\nthe ways that I raise my kids and and\nthings like that and and so she's like\noh that's not the right way to do it\nright your dad's issue is that you're\nnot successful in the right place yeah\nthat's it and and like this is just like\nthey don't get to determine what's right\nright we have our own perspective and we\ndon't get to determine what's right\neither\nlike what's right comes like from a\nconversation and the cord between the\ntwo of us and I mean I think you know I\nknow I wish I'm gonna have to think a\nlittle bit Felix because I think just a\ncouple of closing thoughts so I think\nthere are a couple things you can work\non one is you know to think about how to\nhave a conversation with your dad\nbecause I think that actually needs to\nhappen at some point and and the second\nthough is to really figure out like I do\nthink you're Alexa thymic which means\nyou don't really you're not really in\ntouch with your emotions and and I don't\nknow if you I mean sometimes like people\nwho are not really in touch with their\nemotions they come out and\nhe's like oftentimes frustration or\nanger or toxicity and so I think a big\npart of toxicity on the internet and on\ntwitch comes from like people having\nthese kinds of issues or like your dad\nis fundamentally not proud of you and\nlike that's hard to live with like every\nsingle day right and that hurts and then\nlike what happens when we get hurt like\nif I slap you across the face what are\nyou gonna do yeah I'll G and then what\nand then afterward till it heals sure\nbut you're not gonna hit back um yeah\nmaybe maybe not okay I'm sorry I I think\nI'm not giving you the the correct the\ncredit\nI should no no but but that's that's\nperfectly fine right so it's not like\nonce again it's not me it's not for me\nto know what the correct answer is when\nyou give me an answer that I'm not\nexpecting what your spot on that's not\nthat wasn't what I expected I don't try\nto convince you that I'm right I stop\nand put myself in your shoes and then\nthe truth is gonna be somewhere in the\nmiddle okay so let me put it a better\nanalogy that will give me the answer\nthat I want right when someone like when\nyou're playing a game of overwatch and\nlike you know they take the point or\nwhatever and then you're like yeah I'm\ngonna [ __ ] him right yeah you hit back\nyeah and and so when we're hurt what we\nrespond with his anger okay and I was\nreading I mean so I sort of realized\nthis one day when I was reading one of\nthe manifestos or one of these school\nshooters and at the bottom of all of\nthat man yeah go ahead okay [ __ ] effect\na bruni story no more I feel like over\ntime I have this new sort of system or\nloop that I do where when things like\nthat happen or something or somebody\npunches right I I punch but not by using\nlike my face or something is that make\nsense sure I punch another way that's\nmore like subtle or like calculate or\nsomething right\nwhere something like\n[ __ ] me over I'm not gonna I'm not\ngonna [ __ ] them over I'm gonna visit if\nyou're gonna dismantle them yeah but you\nlose yeah you're gay\nyeah I'm with you we could get into that\ntoo that's that's a cold anger it's not\na haunting okay right there's a but the\nanger is still there my friend mm-hmm\nright it's just it's just not you're not\ngonna hit back you're gonna say ow and\nthen you're gonna figure out how to\ndismantle me oh okay that that's\ninteresting then yeah yeah I like that\nthought yeah that's still anger I like\nthat\nyep because sometimes I'll like I guess\nfalsely tell myself I'll be like man\nlike that you know that's you're not\ndoing it out of anger you know like I'm\njust doing that because it's it's the\nright thing or like I'm myself like a\nself-righteous that I have angle but\nit's still it's still trash you know no\nit may not be trash okay that's a whole\ndifferent issue right so so what your\nactions may be just but your actions\nbeing just and and whether they're\nwhether there's anger there or separate\nor separate questions mm-hmm all right\ncuz if I smack you across the face like\nyou hurting me in some way could be just\nbut I think it doesn't surprise me that\nyou don't feel anger but it's a cold\nfury because I think the bigger thing is\nlike so in anyway so I think they're\nlike two general directions Felix that\nyou need to go the three actually so one\nyou're already doing and really good at\nand that's to learn and analyze your\nsystems which I think you've done a\nphenomenal job I don't think we could\nhave gotten this far in the conversation\nunless you had a pretty good attention\nto the systems that you develop over\ntime even if they don't make perfect\nsense to you you know what they are at\nleast which is awesome so continue\nlearning because there may be sudden T's\nwhich are not so I can think is I think\nat some point you've got to settle to\n[ __ ] with your dad and that could be\nthrough a conversation with him it could\nbe through therapy it could be through\nany number of things but this is this\nthing is not at peace right like there's\nsomething about like you still accept\nhis view on some level and that needs to\nbe dealt like\nawareness huh the third thing is that I\nthink you need to better understand what\nyour emotions are and what you're\nfeeling because I think you've got all\nkinds of stuff when you talk about these\nthoughts I think the fuel for those\nkinds of thought loops and negative\nthought patterns comes from because you\ncall them thought right all you\nexperiences the thoughts but like where\nis the fuel for that coming from it's\nprobably coming from sopressa music yeah\nand so the third kind of dimension for\nyour growth is to like you know to put\nit bluntly get in touch with your\nfeelings and I don't know if you're like\nin a romantic relationship or what the\ndeal is there but like when it comes to\nthose like you know getting this [ __ ]\nand order is like really important to\nhaving like a healthy romantic\nrelationship because unless you know\nlike when she he or she does something\nthat upsets you like if you don't feel\nthat upset and can't vocalize that to\nher you're just gonna dismantle her or\nhim depending on what your sexual\npreferences okay you know and and so we\ncan talk about relationships or whatever\nat a different point but does that make\nsense\nlike you got to know like what's going\non yeah Andres husband's I understand\nher thoughts or questions before we wrap\nup no I think I understand um yeah these\nthings many lessons you take aways from\ntoday you mind if I ask why what time is\nit\nI know I know do you wanna keep talking\ncause like we been out\noh oh I I didn't have time I lost look\nat time\nI enjoyed that the nerves really good um\nnot really\nI mean I have like it's almost like\nevery topic has like a bunch of branches\nI was like I could go with that okay\nwhat we're gonna instead and and you\nknow I I feel complete but there's no\nsense like there's still a lot left to\ntalk about\nyeah it's okay though yeah I I was\nwondering if you could try to summarize\ncuz like you know people are watching\nlike what do you think what do you think\nare some highlights like what do you\nthink are some of the key points what\nare the not the branches but like you\nknow the big stems that then could be\nexplored the big\nthat can be explored yeah what are the\nthings that you took away from the\nconversation if anything oh okay\nI think sometimes you say something\nright like a statement and it kind of\nsimplifies my viewpoint on it like all\nlike overcomplicate something or I'll\nsee like in a weird way\nand then you'll say like oh like if I\nreally resent it that's still anger\nright it's such a simple answer but it's\nokay it's just like a simple thoughts\nbut it resonates a lot and there's a\ncouple things that you did it leeches\nlike that you said like that like Oh\nlike really when he said oh that's pain\nbut you say thought you said you say in\nanother way or something mm-hmm like and\nthese things are easy to easy to take\nhome easy to okay because yeah I like a\nlot it's it simplifies it it makes it\nway more approachable mentally like it's\nnot oh it's not all broken no or it's\nnot like a so it's that complicates like\na crazy process it's as simple as you\nknow that's just a feeling or just that\nyeah okay thanks for from yeah John no\ngo ahead look I was doing nothing I'm\njust gonna say so sometimes I teach\npeople meditation are you interested in\nthat um I'm not really good at it where\nI\nmaybe you heard about this before since\nyou're in that sort of feel but um\nbiofeedback and huh no no feedback\nuh-huh\never heard about that yep okay and uh I\nhad to learn it like breathe and and and\nsort of method is the can't they kind of\nwere like hand in hand right yeah like\nbreathing properly like uh was it called\nagain dude\nwhen you breathe through like the bottom\nof the lungs or something abdominal\nbreathing yeah that okay so uh you're\nyou're not good at it yeah I'm not good\nat getting a hold of my thoughts like if\nI'm okay okay nobody's ready this is a\nlittle different I don't know what is\nyour time is this gonna take too long no\ngo for a media are you like on a set\nschedule is like very tight\nlet me check real quick sure and don't\nknow if it is like it I'm not gonna get\nmad it's like no no I appreciate your\nconsideration man sure it's very kind of\nyou nope we're good okay so\nI remember it's a Tetris syndrome or\nwhatever Tetris syndrome\nya know where you do an action for so\nlong and so much time in one day or a\ncouple days that even when you're not\ndoing it it's still happening in your\nhead okay like like I've been playing a\nlot of chess on an off stream and the\nentire time we talk today like it's like\nthe entire time I had I had pieces I\ncould visibly see like almost in my\nvision and if they kept just kept moving\nthe whole time and I kept like\npracticing like certain moves or\nsomething does that make sense yeah it's\nit's like it's so vivid that it's like\num it's always there right and I do that\nwith like streaming and playing games so\nwe're even when I'm not doing them it's\nlike always happening like I'm I keep\nplaying my head but it's it's always\nthere so whenever I try to like meditate\nor calm down it it's really hard to not\nthink about anything or think about\nsomething and just feel like let things\nflow you know I mean and without being\ncompletely disrupted by my head just\nplaying that game again or or doing that\naction that I did all day it's just so\noverwhelming right so it's all yeah okay\nthanks for sharing that very that's\ngonna hug yeah it's kinda hard to get a\nhold of my thoughts whenever I try to\nlike calm and chill like it gets under\ncontrol really bats I think the problem\nis not that you need to get ahold of\nyour thoughts I think you need to let\nhim go\nokay that's why you're not good at\nmeditating because meditating is not\nabout holding on to your thoughts it's\nabout letting him go it's like you're\nmoving in the opposite direction\nuh-huh alright it's sort of like you\nknow so Felix how do you go to sleep I\nusually just\nask myself I can't and I haven't really\nactually gonna sleep and I don't know\nthe longest time yeah just uh yeah right\nso so so sleep is not something that you\ncan do it's something that you have to\nlike it like it that's that happen to\nyou\nall right so sleep is not about you\ndon't go to sleep you let sleep take you\nand what you have to do to let sleep\ntake you is to be very very exhausted\notherwise sleep won't come and take you\ndoes that make sense you don't do it it\nit does you like it's the other way\naround yeah and so I think you\nabsolutely need to meditate but you need\nto meditate in the opposite direction\nfrom what you're trying to do and I just\nneed a second to think about how to do\nthat I have a particular technique that\nI think would work very well for you\nit's just we can't do it on streem is\nthe problem okay what is it I'm just a\nso so what I tell people to do is like\nso I you know I used to teach this stuff\nin a hospital like in my office and so\nwhat I would do is take people down to\nthe cafeteria of the hospital and I tell\nthem to close their eyes and listen to\nas many sounds that they hear as quickly\nas they can for a short amount of time\nas possible so just listen to like a\nglass clinking over here someone's on\ntheir phone someone's walking by someone\nspilled something there's a baby crying\nsomeone you know banged silverware\ntogether there's a cash register that\nding but there's another cellphone\nsomeone's coming down the stairs there's\nan elevator that beeped you know there's\nsomeone's something's moving over here\nthere's a dog barking and just to listen\nto as many sounds as you can as quickly\nas you can ok if you want to meditate\nwhat you need to do is not slow your\nmind down you need to speed it up ok so\nthere's a there's a good kind of saying\nin meditation which is how do you get a\nmonkey to sit still which is like hard\nto translate into the West because we\ndon't have monkeys and and you know if\nyou want a monkey to sit still what you\nhave to do is exhaust it right you can't\nlike force a monkey you can't hold it in\nplace it's just gonna go crazier and\ncrazier and crazier and so what we need\nto do for you to meditate is for\nmeditation to take you you need to\nexhaust your mind and\nI almost say like let me just think\nI mean do you want to try something or\nyou're okay just and I'm not trying to\npressure you I just want to know where\nyou are\nso anything element okay well good\nwhatever so what does that do when you\nthink about a lot of sounds what does\nthat do I'm gonna show you hope just\ngive me a second I think showing you is\ngonna be way easier than telling you I\njust have to think about how much to\nengage your mind\nokay so I want you to sit up straight\n[Music]\nthink let me think let me think we don't\nwant to overdo it that's okay maybe he\nwill be easier so I wonder if doing\nthings with your body is gonna be easier\nare you stay yeah how tall you're tall\nyeah\nokay yeah sure we can do something\nstanding so okay let's just stop\nextending all right jack\nall right so it's gonna be really simple\nwell let's just see what happens okay\nokay sounds good\nwe're gonna so that I was asking you to\nsit up straight but you're standing now\nso let's run with it it means just sit\nsit with your back straight that's okay\ndon't worry about it\nno no no we're gonna run with it I think\nthis is great okay I'm gonna stand up\nso I can it's not a big deal okay so\nthis is what I want you to do so stand\nup straight yeah feet together arms by\nyour side and then I want you to as you\ninhale I want you to raise your arms and\nthen the\nI don't know like with my nose your eyes\nit's fine right right and then exhale\nand as you exhale I want you to bring\nyour arms down to where when you fully\nexhale your arms should be at the bottom\nso you want to match the involution with\nthe match the movement of your arms with\nyour breast\nokay okay so yeah breathe in\nand then out okay way too fast\nso death yeah so I want you to look at\nthe pacing of my arms and follow your\nbreath long\nnow is your breath matching your arms or\nno no so you've got a focus on yeah yeah\nso your arms should not be moving your\narms should only be moving while you are\nbreathing in or out okay and I'm gonna\nspoil when I was about this one I was\nalready done yeah then you need to slow\ndown your breath\nslowing down your breath that's perfect\nhuh\nthat was perfect that was perfect okay\nso close your eyes and and do five up on\nyour okay Hebrew slow\ngood again\ngood keep going now keep your arm\nmovements even so you can't speed up or\nslow down it has to be even with your\nbreath the entire time\nagain\nduh keep going and now I want you to\ntell me as you're keeping track of your\nbreath and your arms I want you to tell\nme about which chest moves you see in\nyour mind\ndo you see chess moves in your mind no\nVincent for a while think about them and\ncontinue doing the practice from I'll\ncall the chess game keep your breath\neven keep your arms even think about\nchess\ndo you hear one of those in breath slow\nkeep it even and think about chess at\nthe same time very fast slow down slow\nbreath slow slow slow breath keeping\narms even in slow yeah good what's\nhappening I'm feeling good\nwhy I'm doing what are the other\nrobotically\nso let your full attention return to the\nbreath arms up slow even and then down\nsmooth\nnotice that your arms may be getting\ntired and Soviet we're gonna do three\nmore it's slowly smoothly infinitely as\nyou can now\nagain\nand out last one slow smooth and even\nand out\nlater eyes remain closed\nspread your feet apart a little bit and\njust sit in your mind\nnotice this natural breath that your\nbreath is naturally waste lower\nfocus on the sensation in your arms and\nlet your attention balance between your\nbreath and your arms whichever one feels\nbad\nand let it sit with one for a while and\nwhen it's ready to move let it move\nmove to something else if thoughts come\nyou can notice those thoughts that the\nchess pieces come back let them come\nback and then focus on the sensation in\nyour arms focus on the slowing your\nbreath will continue for about 30 cents\nwhen you're ready go ahead and sit back\ndown open your eyes and tell me how you\nfeel that's good what what does that\nmean um something weird happened it was\nkind of like that's what we're here for\nthat means you did it right okay I just\nsince I was looking for thoughts when I\nmoved away from trying to look for a\nfeeling in my arms or or my chest\nwhatever I feel like a random random\nlike scenes would like pop my head and I\nwas just kind of like go along because I\nknew that it was part of the process and\nI would move back to my arms again and\nthen I would think Oh what I think about\nlast time and then something would pop\nup who cares what I thought nothing\nabout this now\nso some another scenery in my head or\nanother object or things going on and\nthen back my arms and then I kind of let\ngo I don't know I find I kind of felt\nthat yeah okay I just give I can i I\nkind of give importance to those things\nI'm thinking about or I'm looking for\nwhanau and not like some other [ __ ] good\nso that's focusing of attention now let\nme ask you what was your mind doing\nwhile we were doing the breathing and\nmoving of the arms that was odd\nwhy I'm like this but I always like\nprocess images all the time I have like\nvisuals in my head like I thought about\nthat a lot today I think didn't I tell\nabout something I told you what I see\nlike I always thought like a drawing\nalmost or like something that displays\nwhatever whoever is going on and\nwhenever I do doing my arms up I\ncouldn't something about a robot should\nnot try to synchronize both right and I\ncan see like I could see like notches\nright like 1 2 3 or almost like a clock\nright and that's what I'm thinking about\nthe whole time I was like and I was but\nwhat about the breathing though okay but\nwhat are the notches actually I like\nsink a boat and because I was having\nthose thoughts\nI couldn't sink them beautiful okay so\nlet me explain something to you so\neveryone thinks that meditation is about\nstillness of the mind right so if we\nthink about it like you're you're saying\nthat anytime I try to steal my mind it\ndoesn't still I have all kinds of\nthoughts and all kind of [ __ ] is\nhappening right okay good is this pen\nstill there's no yeah right so this is\nhard for you to do with me okay you're\nnot gonna understand this inside\nhopefully this will make sense for you\nto meditate you can never do this you\ncan't just have something be still for\nyou to meditate you need to do this\nwe'll be able to do either okay what's\nthe difference between this and the\nother thing or both of these pens still\nthey're both still but this one requires\nlike a effort to keep it still if you\nlike absolutely this is what you need\nwell not this this your mind is gonna\nget [ __ ] bored and it's gonna think\nabout a thousand different things\nokay people who try to teach you how to\nmeditate they taught you this you're\nnever going to be successful meditating\nlike that this is what you need okay and\nthen what you need to do is do it while\nstanding on one leg so your meditation\nyour stillness of the mind because the\npen is still in both ways people think\nthat meditation is stillness that comes\nthrough no effort for you Felix it must\ncome through maximal effort yeah and if\nyou can fully engage your mind it's not\nabout stopping your mind it's about\npushing it to it's very limits and so I\nthink like that's that was the goal and\nI think you were even doing it because\nyou were bouncing between focusing on\nthe breath and focusing on the robot you\nsee that huh and then even at the end I\ntold you bounce between the breath in\nthe sensation in your arms you must\nbounce and you're like what does that\nmean it's exactly what you were doing\nbefore that's what I was telling you to\ndo bounce between the two your\nmeditation or your stillness is gonna\ncome through rhythm and balance not\nthrough like sitting still it's still\nstill low right there's no movement it's\njust a completely different thing it's\ngonna come through balance and so you\nneed to bounce back and forth as much as\nyou can and and the the the cafeteria\nexercise which we can't do now because\nof Kovan that too is about bouncing\nbetween as many things as you can as\nquickly as you can and in between all\nthat you'll find stillness okay so okay\nthings like too fast cuz I have liked it\nthere isn't nope if it's too if there's\nno such thing as too fast the only thing\nthat there is is not fast enough okay so\nyou need to push your mind until you are\nexhausted okay because I remember\nreeling back one time where I was like\num I was thinking about stuff right when\nwe're doing it and I was like wait if\nthat that's like unreasonable I'm going\ntoo fast now I for some reason my mind\nwas just going faster and I was like\nokay chill then you whatever you were\nthinking about anybody have a little\nmore and then we'll go through the\nbreath so I have to know that then well\nso what what we do want you to do is\nreturn two things it's not about speed\nit's about not returning okay right so\nreturn to breath return to the sensation\nlet your mind go somewhere and bring it\nback meditation for you should be about\nanchor and balance not about stillness\nokay okay yeah and in terms of a\ntechnique you can try to do this\ntechnique you can also try let me just\nthink I would literally say what you\nshould do is like you should do like\nmore martial arts oriented meditation I\nthink that'll work better for you so I'd\nsay like learn how to balance a pen or\nlearn and then once you get good at this\nthen do it on one foot so you should you\nshould be stable I'm gonna teach you\nsomething\nI forget what what pose this is and once\nagain IV I got a okay that's right no oh\none second hold on hold on you can sit\nhere that's fine you can sit I just\ndaddy needs to demonstrate something\nokay you can sit I'm no problem if you\nsit continue sitting no problem okay\nhold on okay so I want you to do I don't\nknow if this is the tree pose right so I\nwant to do this do do yoga I don't do\nyoga so tree pose this yeah oh well\nvoltic put your art put your hands into\nmust stay above your head and hold it\nclose your lenses like like this I'm\nsorry what what like this no no yeah so\nput the leg in and then with your upper\narms do this\nyep pull it good\nso close your eyes what's your mind\ndoing\nI'm loving like visual stimuli no no if\nyou're not getting visual stimuli that's\nwhat we want what about this open your\neyes it'll get easier\nokay okay so now is your mind wandering\nare you thinking about things yeah\nokay close your eyes what's happening to\nthe thoughts there you go that's about\nit that's what you need to do open open\nsee the thoughts come right back go come\nback in a second give him a second\nthey'll come back thoughts come back\nyeah well so make him go away\nclose them try to hang on to them try to\nhang on to the thoughts as long as you\ncan good bouncing back and forth balance\nopen your eyes\ndo this yeah good so that's still\nfocusing on the sensation is not the\nsame old ship hold on javi okay one\nsecond oh I gotta go up because the this\nkids going crazy if you don't get or you\nhave questions DME afterward okay can I\njust take you back for a second okay so\nlet's give xqc some love thanks a lot\nman it was a pleasure meeting you bro\nSherman thanks\num yeah of course as well and let me\nknow if you want to follow up at some\npoint or you have additional questions\nof course Sherman okay well thanks let\nme do this ever select yeah thank you\nfor coming on bro\nthe have a good it okay twitch at I\nshall be right back okay I have to just\ngo deposit this one and then we'll close\nup just give me a second"
