    "transcript": "welcoming it up is it okay if I call you\nAnita mm-hmm certainly\nand so when you so tell us a little bit\nabout so what do you want to talk about\ntoday or how can we help you or are you\nhelping us or what's going on whatever\nyou'd like I mean you're welcome to ask\nme anything you want a lot of people\ntend to ask about my condition and\nyou're totally free to you if you'd like\nI hear that you have particular\nexpertise with burnout um yeah also like\nwe can talk we can touch on a little bit\nabout like the pressure of being online\nand you know receiving a lot of abuse\nand kind of like prejudices against\npeople with disabilities if you like as\nwell because that's a very loud aspect\nof my existence that's right if I have\nto kind of try and ignore on a daily\nbasis yeah so I mean absolutely I mean\nif there's some way that I can be\nhelpful with you about burnout and that\nis sort of my I mean I guess I'm\ndeveloping a different professional\nexpertise nowadays but that was sort of\nmy traditional area of expertise so can\nyou tell us a little bit about can you\njust tell us a little bit about yourself\nand then we can talk about burnout or\nsure I'm Suniya I've been a streamer for\nabout two years now and I went I went\nviral pretty much as soon as I hit the\nground on twitch so I was completely\nlost and I've been playing catch-up ever\nsince with a crazy amount of growth my\nstream is mainly variety streaming\nmostly just chatting and yeah I've been\nworking on you know a mental health\ntopic since I started really because\nthen I'm forgetting that yeah I mean I\nkind of feel like the platform really\nneeds it this is this whole platform\nfeels like a symptom of loneliness like\npeople want company um so a lot of the\npeople who come here at people yeah a\nsymptom of loneliness I love that yeah\nso so you're you're whistling mmm oh\nthat's a tick okay I can't help it and\nand does your the the right eye blinking\nthat's a tick as well okay\nso you're not just does it have any\namount of winking or it's just a tick\nit's just a tick okay trouble a lot leap\nbecause okay if I go to nightclubs where\nI can't really explain myself right\neasily across the room a lot of people\nthink I'm hitting on them when I'm\nreally really not yeah\nso can you tell us a little bit about\nticks and what's up with that so I have\na condition called Tourette's syndrome\na lot of people get symptoms in that\nearly childhood but my family can\nremember symptoms coming from about the\nat least the age of one\nI have involuntary movements and speech\nso I'll quite often say things that are\ninappropriate if that happens during the\nstream I'm very sorry it's not a\nreflection of what I'm thinking and\nthat's a common misconception about\nTourette's syndrome is that it's what\nwas secretly thinking I wish we could\nsay but if it's mostly worth salad you\ndon't know what's gonna get tossed up if\nit's relevant to the situation at all\nand sometimes it is it's usually because\nI'm worried about saying it rather than\nbecause it's actually what I'm thinking\nor feeling because worrying about being\ninappropriate quite often forces you to\nbe inappropriate as someone with\nTourette's but it can be very\nunfortunate and dangerous in public but\nluckily slightly less dangerous if you\nyou know have an internet-based job\nwhere people get crossed with you they\ncan't do anything about it\nand and so tell me do you have you\nnoticed that some things make your tics\nbetter or worse oh yeah definitely I\nthink that's the case for a lot of\npeople with Tourette's syndrome making\nmusic definitely definitely a lot of\npeople with even severe Tourette's\nsyndrome have consumed without tics or\nperhaps play an instrument without\nhaving any ticks at all and there are\nlots of things a lot of people ask if I\ntick during sex and I've this is a\nquestion I ask a lot of people who also\nhave Tourette's syndrome across the\nboard if if the sex is good no\nkiss focus and if you're enjoying\nsomething and it requires a lot of focus\nand you're very much engaged with what\nyou're doing\nit definitely reduces the tics there's\nlots of where there's lots of things\nthat do reduce the tics exercise things\nlike\nI don't took as much around my personal\ntrainer um so he's quite shocked what he\nsees videos of me yeah so yeah\ndefinitely and there are things\nexacerbate it too like high stress\nsituations high emotion feelings of\nawkwardness my biggest trigger is\nawkwardness\nso I can't watch mr. bean quietly that's\nfor sure mr. bean is amazing yes so\nstress and and what about burnout so I\nhave always I used to be a cafe Bicks\nand my life was really still for a while\nand I think that was the worst thing I\never experienced honestly so I have\nalways been chasing things to do and I\ncan never say no and even before I start\nstreaming it was a bit of a problem\nbecause I used to run a business I used\nto care for my mom used to care for\nrescue animals and I used to do rescue\nvolunteering and the four of them put\ntogether sometimes I'd come home for an\nhour and then go straight back out again\nand I would do that for days on end and\nyou know and I would like fall asleep at\nwork and then I'd fall asleep in the car\non the way to rescue work and I would\njust never stop and when I started doing\nwhat's that I thought that is I don't\nknow I mean I definitely have an\naversion to sing still I definitely have\nan aversion to to stopping for anything\nand I'm not very good at its handing to\nmy needs so I quite often forget to make\nmyself food or get to sleep or take time\nfor me I feel guilty when I do those\nthings so I feel much better when I'm\ngetting on with stuff actually doing\nsomething productive and worthwhile hmm\nyou feel guilty for attending to your\nneeds\nyeah definitely like playing games or\njust you know just taking a minute to\njust sit in the garden whatever I feel\nthis like encroaching sense of dick\nChrist encroaching sense of um like I'm\nwasting my time there's things that need\nto be done I'm letting everything slip\nout of my hands and I've got to get back\nto it now sort of thing how long have\nyou been feeling that way\nI don't know I think he I think it\nprobably started when I stopped being\nable to go outside back when I got too\nscared to go outside and I was fully\nagoraphobic I stayed away from everyone\ndidn't really speak to anyone for years\nand during that time Easter look out the\nwindow and see the Sun was rolling by\nand know that this was a summers night\nsummer is yeah Saint years yes Wow Angie\nI used to I used to feel terrible like I\nwas wasting the best time of my life and\ndo you so can you tell us a little bit\nabout when you became as you put it\nfully agoraphobic I I went I I tried I\nwas up I was really young pestering my\nmom to go let me go back to school\nbecause I starting to feel a bit lonely\nand I wanted to reach out to other kids\nwhy weren't you in school uh we moved\naround a lot and even when we were still\nI wasn't I we all went we didn't always\nhave a home sometimes we were homeless\nand things were just challenging my mom\nneeded looking after and so did our\nrescue animals and so there wasn't\nreally much space for me to get a formal\na formal education but so I started to\nget a bit lonely and I started to want\nto go to school but then I did go to\nschool and even though I was doing well\nacademically right off the bat I wasn't\ndoing so well trying to integrate I had\nthese symptoms but no explanation for\nthem so I was coming across as a bit\nweird and it's not always easy to fit in\nwhen you're a bit weird and yeah some\nsome pretty some pretty bad stuff\nhappened so I kind of put you again\nbut the aggression didn't stop and you\nknow what do you mean the aggression so\nmy uh my my last day of school I was 13\nand my 4 I think it was for six formers\nI don't know how old they\nthe oldest kids our school basically\nbeat me until I was unconscious\noh [ __ ] wasn't much I could do about it\nso I woke up in the in the in there I\nwoke up in the in the in the in the\nhealth bit I forgot the name for it the\nmet first aid there we go first aid\nplace with their like on-site doctor\nperson and that's my last day I was like\nI can't do this anymore I mean it's not\nsafe for me to learn here it's not gonna\nstop so I left but I had a paper route\nand the kids from that same school would\ncontinue to ask me throw stones at me\nhad come home bleeding and they died my\nhouse and that constantly ridiculed me\nso there wasn't really anything I could\ndo to escape it it just followed me\neverywhere and my world just shrank and\nshrank I gave up my background I gave up\ngoing outside and just even opening the\nfront door started to give me a bit of a\nheart attack\nso people didn't take my tics well\npeople didn't you know there was there\nwas a lot of stuff going on that just I\ncouldn't really change or contend with\nright so but so I just withdrew wow that\nsounds awful those just sounds honest it\nkind of insane like I've never heard of\na 13 year old being beaten into\nunconsciousness nor have I heard of\nsomeone who like has a paper route who\ngets like throw stones thrown at them I\nmean it sounds like you were hunted yeah\nwell it's not always easy to explain\nyourself if you don't have a diagnosis\nI used to wonder myself I'd do all these\ninappropriate things and then go why am\nI such a terrible person\nbecause I didn't have I would pinch\npeople on the back of the arm or punch\nthem on the arm and not want to and not\nunderstand why and they might get kicked\noff buses and things like that and it\njust became very difficult to get out\nand you might would do anything because\nwhen people asked wiles I don't know I\ndon't know so yeah my world shrank and I\nstayed in all day and the nights and\ndays bled into one ah I didn't uh I\ndidn't go outside I think\nhave anything news so I was playing the\nsame games over and over again and my\nyeah I didn't really speak to my mom a\nlot she was very very ill she spend most\nof her time in bed the house was always\nquiet so there wasn't really mm much\ngoing on I need I'm gonna say something\nthat may be a little bit inflammatory\nbut like it's honestly the the thought\nthat pops into my head now on earth are\nyou not way more [ __ ] up uh you know\nthe first therapist to ask me that\nactually but just um I've had four in my\nlife and yeah all of them have asked me\nthat I mean serious I'm not like I mean\nyou you come across as is you know\nintrospective patient intelligent I mean\nthese are all the things that I'm\nfeeling from you compassionate you know\naware of your internal state to a\ncertain degree acceptance which is a lot\nof what we talked about today and and\nlike I'm telling you I've seen people\nwho are way more [ __ ] up than you who\nhave had way easier lives and like\nconsistently right I mean usually it\ndoesn't it doesn't take a whole lot to\n[ __ ] up patrasche and that's really sad\nlike it doesn't take a whole lot to\nreally mess up a kid and and what I'm\nhearing from you like I'm just really\nreally stunned to be honest like so you\nknow there's one part of it is like you\nknow all the frankly abuse that you went\nto but then you're also talking about a\nmom who's kind of disabled from a young\nage and and kind of doing left to your\nown devices mm-hmm and so I yeah yeah\nhow are you how are you capable of just\nfunctioning at all at this point well I\nthink one of the big things and this is\nwhy I'll always recommend it to parents\nis I was surrounded by animals and that\nwas partly my own doing if I'm honest so\nuh when I was really little uh uh the\nfront kind of started with rabbits we\nlived near a castle market there were\nrabbits they were being a headed skinned\ncleaned hung up by this by this giant\nlady with a meat cleaver there were\nthese fluffy little things in cage\nright next to the store where it\nhappened and I was just like what and I\nwas like really really young like a\ntoddler's age you know less than four at\nsome point and I love dies with this\nlittle white one I was at the st.\nhappening to you and we got out into the\ncar park and my mom was like why is your\ncoat wiggling we ended up with minty and\neventually licorice and dandelion and\nhoney and you know they were the\nfoundations for me empathy my patience\nand my introspect I definitely think\nthat animals were the root of that\nbecause you learned to care for somebody\nelse's needs with no expectations of\nyour own they can't give you anything\nexcept attention and they can they just\nthink about know jump in for a second so\nyou say you learned to care for someone\nelse without any expectation of your own\nneeds sorry that you learn to care for\nsomeone else without any expectation and\nkind of putting their needs above your\nown I don't think you need to put a\nrabbit's needs above your own in order\nto care for them but sure definitely I\ncared about them before I learned to\ncare about myself but the the thing was\nyou know I was a toddler you don't\nreally learn a lot about self-care when\nyou're little yeah I knew it immediately\nI cuz II already I've been through some\nstuff at that age I was like I already\nknew what it was to be vulnerable and at\nthe big peoples mercy and I just saw all\nof these little things that the big\npeople's mercy and I related to that I\nconnected to that in an instant I was\nlike but what I really go ahead say hmm\nI really just wanted them to be safe\nthat was the first thing I ever felt\nabout any animal was I just I wanted to\nbe one of the big people that was a good\nthing and you know a good a good\npresence in their life I wanted to have\nthe power to make things better for them\ndo you mind if I ask what what happened\nto you at a young age where you had come\nto fear the big people so much so so\nmuch I had a violent relative relative I\nhad relatives\nword punish me for my tics and which\nwould make them worse what do you mean\nthat I was quite often ostracized from\nmy family and a point of shame I my fat\nmy family broke apart quite early but\nwhenever I would go and be with them\nthey didn't understand me and they would\nfeel embarrassed when I was at the\ndinner table that constantly apologizing\nfor my behavior they're constantly\nmaking me stay at home alone what they\nwent and did activities as a family\nbecause they didn't want to have to deal\nwith the trouble I bring and I was left\nto not I wasn't allowed to eat with\neveryone like they punished me thinking\nhe would correct my behavior and it\nwouldn't it would just make it worse\nbecause the emotional side of things\nwould make the tics worse and so like\nwhilst I was well behaved I'd have these\nstats of seemingly just out of nowhere\nbeing terrible pushing things over or\nmaking loud noises or swearing and they\njust didn't understand it and thought\nbut I would just act out out of nowhere\nso yeah I I just had I didn't have much\nthat was fun\nmost the time I was just scared of what\nthey do next because I didn't predict\nwhen I'd upset them hmm\nyou actually kind of answered I was\nabout to ask like you know you're\ntalking a lot about other people's\nfeelings and and how they reacted I was\nreally curious about how you felt in\nthose situations like what did you\nunderstand about why you did these\nthings I understand any of it I just I\nknew that I wanted to get on with\neveryone I knew that I wanted to engage\nand have fun I knew that I wanted to be\naccepted I just didn't know how because\nI couldn't stop the thing that they were\nasking me to stop and I didn't know why\nI couldn't stop it was it felt like it\nwould happen and then I'd realised after\nwhat Helena nothing my heart would sink\nhow would you feel about yourself\nplace and always having to excuse or\napologize for my presence there like\neveryone else was getting on with things\nbut not me I was trying to be a part of\nit but always having to excuse my\npresence and always an inconvenience\njust felt like I was constantly having\nto apologize for existing I mean it's\ninteresting because I even wonder about\nsome of the things that you said earlier\nabout burnout and sort of how you tend\nto ignore your needs and and it's I'm\nalmost wondering if you know when you\nfeel a hunger thirst whether there's\nsome part of your mind that sort of use\nthat as an inconvenience and and kind of\nviews yourself as sort of an\ninconvenience that needs to be attended\nto I never thought about it right\nbecause like here's here's what I hear\nAnita I hear someone who's very caring\nbut caring to the point of neglecting\nthemselves right\nI think that's common among people who\nare care as though if the first level of\nengagement you ever know is a one-sided\nrelationship you end up in emulating\nthat later in life often our parents are\nthe templates we use to engage with\nothers and my relationship with one of\nmine was definitely all giving and\nwithout any kind of reciprocating for\nlong periods of time yeah so that's\ninteresting so first of all really viola\nthis is awesome I don't know if you're\njust brilliant or you've been through a\nbunch of therapy or you're well-read or\nwhatever but it's it's really fantastic\nto talk to someone who is so\nintrospective and and able to really\nlook at themselves so let's let's let's\nthink about that for a second right so\nyou're saying that our parents are a\ntemplate the template that we follow but\nwhat what did your parents model for you\nmmm well my mom was sick so I I learned\na lot just because I had to learn how to\ncook when I was really really young like\nunder the age of ten sure I had to learn\nto deal with bailiffs and landlords and\nbills and I had to deal with calling in\nabout repairs and you know my safety as\nwell I had to I was very cognizant with\nmy safety because no one was gonna keep\nme safe except me so I learnt to be very\nresponsible very young and I'm angry and\nwhen my mom was well she was a really\ngreat example she the scientist she was\nreally great at dancing she was an\naccomplished artist um she was a\nphotographer she you know she got silly\nqualifications and she was just\nbrilliant in many ways and that was very\ninspiring so she wasn't all bad but I\nthink I definitely learned to be most\ncomfortable when I'm giving but not very\nvery very comfortable or secure when I'm\nreceiving anything well yeah I mean so\nyou say that and and that makes that we\ncan clearly see the thing that I'm kind\nof confused about is that doesn't seem\nlike the template that your mom gave you\nright the template that your mom gave\nyou was to be the receiver of care not\nthe giver of care you actually became\nthe opposite of your true\nyeah I can see that right so that's\nweird like because I agree with you\ngenerally speaking children become some\nversion of their parents because that's\nwhat's modeled to us so we just you know\nwe learned through observation\nmonkey-see monkey-do and that's not what\nI meant\nas in like quite often I feel that we\nour parents give us the template with\nour engagement so if you have a parent\nwho is quite aggressive towards you then\nyour your template is when you grow up\nis that you conflate love with\naggression and you allow people to be\naggressive towards you because your\nparents always told you I love you yet\nhit you and so you can accept that kind\nof dye cotton dichotomy I don't know\nwhat the right word is when you're older\nbecause it's very familiar I don't know\nthat I copy my parents but I certainly\ncopy or relive some of the ways that I\nengage with them with other people and I\nthink that's what I mean by that\ntemplate yeah so beautifully put right\nso that's actually exactly what we see\nwe don't see you copying your parents\nbehavior we see you your behaviors as\nresponses the way that you learn to\nrelate to other people is based on the\nmodel of the way that you related to\nyour mom which is one side and caring\nyeah what do you think about that it's\nhard to break out of because it's a very\nexpected role of women so like people\nother people are very comfortable\nreceiving from me other people are very\ncomfortable with me making food for them\nor giving them see or bringing them\ngifts or tending to their needs or\nlistening to their feelings um I think\nthat it's very very difficult to step\nout of that role when people are very\ncomfortable with you being that and\nthings like having good self-esteem and\nbeing proud of yourself or being open\nabout your sexuality in things that\nthere are quite often frowned upon\nand you know given women who do that are\ngiving pretty nasty labels quite often\nso I think growing up people very much\naccepted the way that I've been shape\nand I was never really incentivized to\nchange it\nI think for a second so let's take your\nso beautiful example earlier by the way\nabout sort of people who grow up with\nlet's say aggressive or angry parents\nand who conflate love and anger because\nit feels normal to them and then\noftentimes children who are abused will\nwind up in relationships as adults with\npeople who are abusive and I think I\nthink you you offered a wonderful and\ninsightful explanation of how you know\nit feels normal to them that like you\ncan you can be the victim of aggression\nand also the recipient of love from the\nsame person it fits and then this person\nends up in an abusive relationship after\nabusive relationship after abusive\nrelationship and then one day they come\nand they say exactly what you just said\npeople are comfortable with receiving\nwhat I have to give they're comfortable\nwith me making them soup and and\nlistening to their feelings and I could\nimagine the same person or not like the\nperson in our hypothetical sentence\ninators saying yeah I'm a tab uncha\ndudes or women who are very comfortable\nbeating the [ __ ] out of me and then\ntelling me that they love me the next\nday people are just like that what would\nyou say to them I think it's very easy\nto I think it's very easy for violence\nto become invisible if it's all you've\never known in the same way that if you\nhave a teapot in the room and it might\nbe the most ugly teapot in the world and\neveryone who comes in might see it it\nmight be the first thing they notice in\nthe house because they're not used to\nthe teapot but if you grew up with that\nteapot in that room you might not even\nsee it anymore you might walk past it\nevery single day and it won't be there\nto you sure unless the one cake calls\nattention to it and so with violence it\nmight seem very garish the others like\nvery garish the obvious from the outside\nthat an abusive relationship is what it\nis but from the inside if it's all\nyou've ever known since childhood that\npart becomes invisible especially if\nyou're very desperate for love and\nattention\nand that was also something you didn't\nget very much of as a child enough\ndifferent for 11 attention I don't know\nI feel uncomfortable with love and\nattention\nso definitely twitch was an adjustment\nin that respect I feel worried when that\nhappens more than anything yeah so Anita\nlet me ask you a question why does the I\nagree with you that everything about you\nsaid about the teapot is is once again\nvery eloquently put but let me ask you\nlike when that person says yeah I end up\ndating abusive person after abusive\nperson after abusive person that's just\nthe way let's say men are or women are\nbecause men get abused too how would you\nrespond to that person like sure you're\nsaying that it feels normal to you but\nlike why do you think they keep on\nwinding up in abusive relationships is\nit because everyone is fundamentally\nabusive I think that people who tend to\nI wouldn't know how to put this to\nsomeone in that situation because I\nthink hearing it in and of itself\ndoesn't destroy that worldview but I\nthink that people who are passive in the\nface of violence attract violent people\nbecause violent people don't hang around\npeople who won't put up with their [ __ ]\nso the only people they're going to\nconnect with our people Q are passive\nand will continue to engage with them\neven when their boundaries is not\nrespected and those people are harder to\nfind but they will always find the\npeople who will allow them to do it so\nin in a certain way these people who are\nsubject to abuse and people who are\nabusers tend to attract each other but\nthey're kind of separate from the rest\nof the world in that a lot of other\npeople can engage with each other\nwithout hurting each other or being\nharmed it's just that this particular\nlife trap tends to magnetize towards the\nopposite and that can definitely lead to\na cycle so Anita who are you magnetized\ntowards and who is magnetized towards\nyou I don't know when I before I started\nstreaming there were a lot of dark\npeople in my life because even now my\nfriends will say it I'm very patient my\nfirst reaction when someone messes up\nthe first time is we all make mistakes\nor mix mal make mistakes someday and I\nhope I'm forgiven for it\nwe're all human and I try to like help\nthem through it and go here's how we\ndon't do this next time don't worry\nbuddy and I try to maintain the\nconnection I repair it even if I'm not\nthe person who's broken it so my friends\nwill probably tell you that I put up\nwith a lot more than I should and that I\nprobably do attract quite a lot of dark\npeople but since I started streaming\ntwitch is full of givers people who want\nto give you their time and attention\nwith no expectation and I'm not used to\nthat and that was scary when I first\nheard right um and now I'm surrounded by\npeople who are definitely very much the\nopposite that are very lucky to the\nphone into place because it's giving me\na whole new scope of life and friends\nthat are really amazing and safe sounds\nwonderful and it sounds like it was\nreally a growth a point of growth for\nyou to kind of essentially feel very\nuncomfortable with other people's giving\nbecause that didn't feel right to you\nyeah I found a way to overcome that\nthough how'd you do that\nwell I thought about the it was actually\nsomething a therapist said ages ago she\nwas like but it didn't really click\nuntil I fell here and it was how do you\nfeel when you're giving and I went good\nit's a way to connect with people it's a\nway to indulge the best part of myself I\nfeel good about these interaction I feel\ngood when I see people happy and she was\nlike well why what do you think other\npeople are feeling when they're giving\nto you I was like yes exactly that so\nhow do you think they feel if you refuse\nand you pull away was it okay no I get\nit\nyeah yeah can I share a story that\nreminded me of something from my old\nlife that I kind of learned that my wife\ntaught me can I share that yes so so my\nmom and grandmother so I'm I might I\nhave one brother so growing up and\ncoming from an Indian culture like\ngender norms are very regimented so like\nmen do certain things and don't do other\nthings and growing up you know my\nbrother and I were actually pretty chill\nand so you know my mom and grandmother\nwould sometimes come this\nand then they'd ask us like what do we\nwant to eat for dinner and we viewing\nourselves as chill we would kind of or\nyou know actually being chilled\ndepending on it we'd say like you know\nyou can make whatever you want to or\nlike we can eat whatever you want like I\ndon't really care like whatever you want\nto do is fine and then what do you think\nthat did to them when we would say\nwhatever any idea I have no idea what\nI'm surprised were they uncomfortable\nwith that yeah sort of so like like then\nwould have would they would ask us like\ndo you want to eat this or do you wanna\neat this because my mom and grandmother\nwould really derive especially my\ngrandmother because she basically I mean\nshe spent a lot of her life in in the\nkitchen and so she derived a lot of\nenjoyment and pleasure out of like\ndemonstrating her love through food and\nthat was kind of what she did and and so\nwe would say whatever and then she would\nask us like okay do you want to eat this\nand we'd be like yeah that's fine and\nthen she's like do you want to eat this\nand we'd be like yeah that's fine too\ndo you eat this and she would be like\nyeah but that's fine and and then my\nwife one day pointed out to me that\nyou're driving him absolutely [ __ ]\ncrazy like if you like what you should\ndo is just tell them you want to eat\nsomething because they want they want\nyou to say something and then they want\nto do eat feed you whatever you want to\neat and they want to watch you enjoy it\nbut unless you actually express a\npreference you're actually doing them a\ndisservice because they're here to care\nfor you so like let them care for you\nand just tell them what you want to eat\nor just pick something you don't\nactually care just pick any anything and\nthen pretend you really want to eat it\nand then let them make it and whether\nyou like it or don't like it just say\nit's awesome and express your gratitude\nand eat and stuff yourself and it kind\nof made me realize that like sometimes\nthe best thing that we can do for people\nis for us to like if for us to help them\nis not to actually be neutral towards\nthem but for us to actually be helped by\nthem right is for us to actually like\nlet them yeah sorry\nthat wasn't what I meant but yeah\nbreakfast I I can agree that you know\nbeing able to state your needs is an\nopportunity for others indulge the best\nin themselves and to rise up Tia and\nsometimes it can feel awkward and\nuncomfortable for many reasons some\npeople have low self\nand feel like others don't like\nattention and feel uncomfortable\nsome people feel demanding and feel like\nit's too much to ask there are so many\nreasons why many people I bet in chat\nfeel a bit weird asking for anything and\nI'm not the only person and I still have\nto fight on an emotional level even\nthough I feel like I've I understand it\non her what is the emotional level what\ndo you mean by that\nwell I think sometimes instinctively the\nway that we've grown the way that we\nfelt for most of our lives lingers even\nif we reason our way out of it we still\nhave to contend with the emotional side\nof things even if we understand how the\ntrick is done the magic trick can still\naffect you\nthat's a bad analogy because you yeah\nwhat is the emotion what is the theme oh\nwhat is the emotion that you're\ncontending with mmm I think it's a\nmixture of fear and shame yeah\ndefinitely\nokay I definitely understand you Sara\nthat hmm what are you afraid of her what\nare you ashamed\nI don't know I guess another way to\nexplain it would be like what someone's\nnice to me it's always felt like I've\ntaken out a loan of like two billion\npounds or something I'll never be able\nto pay it back I'm not in a position\nlike because when I was younger if\npeople were nice to me like there's\nnothing to do I can't make this good\nI'm just taking and everyone around me\nwas always saying all you do is take\ntake take you you know you're you never\ngive back and it's like I don't know how\nyou haven't shown me how and I didn't I\ndidn't really know what to do about it\nI just felt indebted and it and it felt\nreally concerning and worrying but also\npeople used to be nice to me in order to\nyou then later be cruel\nit was manipulative there were adults\naround me that weren't didn't have the\nbest intentions growing up and I didn't\nhave as much protection because my\nparents weren't there so in that sense\nit became intimidating it was almost a\nthreat to see things and I might be\nblamed or people might get angry at me\nlater for having them so I guess I was\njust concerned in general like that all\nof that would just hit me in a wave and\nsometimes it still doesn't have to catch\nit and go nope everything's good now and\nyou know I can bake the neighbor a cake\nnext time you know and everything's okay\nso it sounds like you were afraid of the\nother shoe dropping that people were\nnice to you and then there would be pain\nafterward hmm yeah so that's fear what\nis shame I heard a wonderful exploration\nof fear but I didn't understand too much\nabout why you felt ashamed I don't know\nI guess\nI think it was instilled from a young\nage that I wasn't supposed to take\nanything once I asked for a chocolate\nand one of my member of my family went\nno you can't ask for things that's rude\nand really really ashamed to be in front\nof everyone like really loudly\neverything went quiet and they kind of\nexploded at me for asking if I could\nhave a job to you and there was a\nsituation where I went to a friend's\nhouse and I made them toast they asked\nme to go down and make the toast for\nthem and I went down I made toast and\ntheir grandparents caught me I'm like\nall you do is take take take like oh\nthat's all you ever do and I was like I\nhaven't taken anything from you this\nisn't you it for me but like I\nimmediately feel ashamed because I feel\nlike if I receive anything it's I'm not\nsupposed to have that this isn't meant\nfor me like that there's this idea ever\nsince I was younger that I'm not\nsupposed to take it I'm not supposed to\nhave anything that yeah that it's I\ndon't even know how to explain it\nbut yeah so I feel guilty whenever I do\nokay can I think for a second\nhe wants breakfast send it now press em\nfirst I like that voice it sounds like\nlike it's like a serie or something it\nsounds like a I don't know how to\ndescribe it it sounds like a voice that\nyou hear on like a phone or yeah thank\nyou it's it's a voice I often have tics\nand for some reason or another I my tics\ntake they have a totally different vocal\nrange than I do\ngenerally for some reason some of them\nare high-pitched some of them have a\nlist some of them sound like a sat-nav\nyou know yeah yes I know that's what it\nis yeah yeah and it also I need it's\nit's cool to talk to someone and you\nsort of mentioned that sometimes\nemotions make your tics more active and\nit's been fun to watch and I hope this\ndoesn't come across as mean it's just I\nfind it very so a lot of times when I\ntalk to people I struggle to know what\nthey're feeling or how they could be\nfeeling and it's been neat to sort of\nhave a little bit of a barometer for\nwhat you could be feeling based on how\nactive your tics are and that there are\ncertain times where you know it's clear\nthat you're focused and paying attention\nand you're speaking and sharing and then\nyour tics kind of go down and if there's\na period of silence and then your mind\nis left some energy but some leftover\nenergy it sort of manifests outward as\nit is a tic and that's neat to kind of\nthink a little bit about I've never been\nable to quite get a thermometer or\nbarometer of someone's like mental\nenergy emotion and focus in the way that\nI have been talking with you so I'm\nlearning a lot it's actually kind of\ncool that's cool yeah I get a lot of\nabuse for it in chat because people go\nah she forgot to tick see I knew it was\nfake every time she talks or focuses she\nforgets she drops her acts and I'm just\nlike no that's not how it works please\ndon't pressure me like that no no it's\nreally not how it works I mean the way\nthat I would envision takes for you is\nan excess of mental energy so if your\nmental energy is spent\nin a particular way and if we think\nabout what does emotion do to your mind\nit creates energy in your mind right so\nwhat emotion leads to increased activity\nso the more increased activity that you\nhave that you cannot focus so if we\nthink about energy of the mind is having\ninflows and outflows when it rises above\na certain level I think it take\nmanifests and so the more inflow you\nhave through emotion and stress the\ngreater your chances of tics are the\nmore outflow that you have through let's\nsay focus practice flow music engaged in\nconversation that decreases the energy\nand decreases the manifestation of tics\nI think it's really just about energy in\nthe mind that's such a good way of\nexplaining it thank you\nI might steal that next time someone\nasks me on my street I steal away it's\nbeen really fun to see because even when\nI when I start talking more I think your\ntics manifest more because it doesn't\nrequire a little of your attention to\nlisten so I have a couple of questions\nfor you if that's okay yeah so the first\nis and so let me actually start off by\nsaying this so you know it's clear to me\nI think either you've done a lot of\nreally well probably both but you've\ndone a lot of wonderful introspective\nwork what are you really studying\nyourself and figuring out how the [ __ ]\nyou work which is awesome and it sounds\nto me like you've had a couple of really\ngood therapists I mean you said you had\nfour and I'd guess that at least a\ncouple of them were like really good and\nhelped you a lot what do you think I'd\nsay one was a life changer yeah the rest\nwere kind of met um but yeah since\nmeeting her she changed her life so I've\nbeen raising funds and giving them to\nher to pay for other people to see her\nbecause I really believe in what she\ndoes so this dream has helped me to you\nget other people to get help through her\nwhich it's been amazing\nthat's awesome wait now I also read but\nI think the Agra phobia allowed me to\nreally stop and think and process Who I\nam\nwhat I want to be my ethics my\nunderstanding of the world and not\nfitting in allowed me to observe from an\noutsider's role because I couldn't quite\nclick and so these things have kind of\ncome together as me I'm just trying to\nmake sense of the world as much as I\npossibly can yeah that's awesome I'm and\nI think you've really come a long way\nwhich kind of makes I mean I view that I\nhave a\nJudy to people who come on stream which\nis to help them understand something or\ngrow in some way I feel like that's what\npeople come on here for not to say that\nthat's why you came on but that's what I\npersonally feel so I believe that it is\npart of my karma my Karma that I've been\ngiven certain advantages and unique\nopportunities to learn and that it's\npart of my job to pass those on to\npeople who may benefit from them and I\nnever know who that person is and so I'm\ngonna ask you a couple of questions if\nthat's okay or a frame a couple of\nthings and then my hope is that you know\nwhen we think about burnout that there's\nstill a some part of you that doesn't\nlet you take care of yourself in the way\nthat you deserve to be taken care of and\nif we think about this like you know\nthere was a anita 1.0 which was sort of\nlike the caregiver and wouldn't receive\nanything and then there was a Nita 2.0\nwhich is able of giving and receiving\nand then I'm kind of seeing I need a 3.0\nwho is someone who is is able to\nactually give to herself right and and\nso I think you can now receive from\nother people but I don't know and I'm\nsure you can to certainly receive from\nyourself because I think I mean there's\nno way that you can become the person\nthat you have without having compassion\ntowards yourself and at the same time I\nsee a little bit of a pattern left over\nwhere you have difficulty like giving\nyourself things from yourself what do\nyou think about that yeah I think if I\ntook you in a house tool you'd see that\na lot how do you mean what does a house\ntour have to do with that I don't buy\nthings for myself I all of the people\nthat visited my house say my walls are\nbare I have barely any furniture I have\nvery few things most of the things in my\nhouse a rabbit related and for them or\nyou know it's like yeah there's not\nreally much that I do or invest time in\nthat's for me I don't know in this house\nso so I mean in a broad sense and this\nmay be a little bit unfair but I just\ndon't know how else to describe it like\nI'm trying to get a sense of why can't\nyou love yourself\nhmm Anais is a good question so and I've\ngot a little bit of a hypothesis so what\ndo you think about your mom I think\nshe's amazing I think she's a very\nstrong person thank you um she she gets\nvery fixated on a task and she she's\nchanged laws and she's changed the world\nin beautiful ways and you know I think\nyeah I definitely see a lot of good in\nher and I hope I can match up to it\nsomeday yeah so I'm wondering that all\nsounds really positive I'm wondering if\nyou have any negative feelings towards\nyour mom no I mean the rest of my family\nhas a lot of Chris's criticisms because\nthey think maybe she let me down but\nfrom a first-person like from an in the\nfamily perspective I'm not gonna hate on\nher for being sick not so uh and I'm\nreally impressed with how much she did\nmanage during that time you know yeah\ndid she let you down no I think she\nreally tried and I think that's really\nvery very evident in that when she did\nhave periods where she had more energy\nyou know she would always you know go\nand get treats for me and things like\nthat and you know she'd show her\naffection in some ways no I've never\nhugged my mum I've she doesn't show\naffection in conventional ways so we\nhave a strange relationship but I\ndefinitely do you appreciate the times\nwhere you know she would she would do\nthe most she could with what you know\nwhat little energy she had yeah so I\njust think about that so Anita I'm gonna\nchallenge you a little bit there and I\nknow this is gonna sound I'm not trying\nto it sounds like your mom really is a\nwonderful person and that she really is\ninspirational but I think that there's\nsomething very very subtle because\nyou've come like 90% of the way and it's\nclear to me like you've done immense\nstuff and I think oftentimes that last\n10% is very counterintuitive so let me\nlet me just toss out some of the\nlanguage that you're saying right so she\ntried she did the best that she could\nI'm not gonna\nnot gonna blame someone who's ill all\npositive things right makes sense is\nfair but let me ask you something\nis there a difference between doing a\ngood job and doing the best that you can\nyeah definitely so when we think about\nyour mom when you say she did the best\nthat he can the funny thing is that\nthat's she did the best that she could\nthe funny thing is that statement has an\nunderside to it which is sort of an\nacknowledgment that she didn't do a\ngreat job right it's not that you blame\nher for not doing a great job there's a\ndifference between blaming someone for\nnot doing a great job and like admitting\nthat someone didn't do a great job hmm\nwhat do you think about is that is that\nfair I mean my mom had a disability I\nwouldn't blame half being in bed a lot\nin the same way that I wouldn't blame\nsomeone in a wheelchair for not walking\nlike this this isn't a parental failing\nthis is illness you know yeah so this is\nthis is where things get really weird\nAnita because when we look at your\nupbringing so there's a difference\nbetween blaming someone for something\nand acknowledging that they actually\nlike that there were problems right\nbecause if we look at if we look at it\nfrom the outside and I know this it\nsounds really weird I'm really not\ntrying to beat up on your mom it's just\nI've worked with people who have been so\nlet me can I tell you a story so I was\nworking with a patient who you know came\nin and and also had huge respect for his\ndad and his when he was young his mom\nwhen he was about nine his mom got no\nwhen he was seven his mom got diagnosed\nwith cancer and then passed away when he\nwas nine and his it was hard on everyone\nin the family it was hard on him it was\nhard on his younger sister it was hard\non his dad and you know his dad was\nreally in grief and and what would\nhappen is he would finish working around\n5:00 or 6:00 p.m. he would go to a bar\nevery day after work and then he'd have\na few beers and he'd come\naround eight or nine and his his you\nknow ten-year-old son in his\nseven-year-old daughter would be with a\nbabysitter\nlike they'd come home from school\nbabysitter would pick him up and the\nbabysitter would be them from like with\nthem from like three day okay so and he\nrecognizes so his dad worked really hard\ntried to give him lots of opportunities\ndid a lot of good stuff like you know\ntried to teach him things and and was a\ngood dad in a lot of ways and and then\nwhen I kind of asked him I was like you\nknow how did you feel when when your dad\nwould like go drinking every day he was\nlike well my dad was like you know he'd\nlost my mom too and he loved her a lot\nand I don't blame him for going to the\nbar because he was in a period of grief\nand and then he kept on saying the same\nthing which is like he did the best that\nhe could right like he doesn't blame him\nfor doing that thing but the weird thing\nis if you really stop and think about it\njust because his dad even if we accept\nfor a moment that his dad did the best\nthat he could it doesn't mean that he\ndid a great job right like it doesn't\nmean that he didn't let his son down in\nsome ways we're not blaming him for\nletting his son letting his son down\nright we're saying that he's got a good\nreason he's a human being he's hurt he\nhas grief and so we're not gonna blame\nhim for that but at the same time we\nshould be honest with the fact that like\nhis dad whether he has good reason or\nbad reason wasn't able to provide for\nhis son what his son deserved does that\nmake sense yeah and so when I think\nabout your upbringing I think about an\nupbringing that really was not good in a\nlot of ways what do you think yeah I I\nwould say that there were definitely\ntimes where I wasn't safe there were\nthings that happened to me there were\ntimes where I needed to learn how to\nprocess things and I never got any kind\nof I don't know emotional toolset sure\nyou kind of handle the things around me\nI was definitely feeling out the world\nalone in many circumstances and I get\nthat and that's that's something that I\ndon't look at as something like it's\nreally hard to say that the sentence\nI deserved anything I don't feel\ndeserving of anything I have no\nexpectations of life life is chaos you\nyou aren't defined by your challenges\nyour defined by how you handle them and\nI my parents they were young my dad was\nlike young Indian teens I'm not sure\nwhen and my my mom was in a young one in\nher teens I'm not exactly sure how old\nthey were but they're in their teens\nanyway and they they didn't really know\nhow to be parents when I was born so\nthey were thrown in at the deep end and\nI didn't expect them I wouldn't expect\nany teenager any kid is essentially to\nknow how to be a perfect parent so I\njust feel lucky that I managed rather\nthan angry that I didn't get anything\nI'm sure I don't really know how to see\nit any other way\nyeah and that's why I think you can't\nlove yourself so I know this is gonna\nsound really bizarre but just run so\nlike first of all let's let's start by\nthere's a 90% chance I'm wrong and 10%\nchance I'm right can we start with those\nodds but I've got this really\nbass-ackwards way of looking at this so\nin a weird way I think that you grew up\nwith givers and takers right and your\nmom was a taker and you were a giver\nright and you decided then and there\nthat it was good to be a giver and bad\nto be a taker\nwhat do you think yeah I came pretty\nmuch okay so if we stop and we think\nabout that if you say that being a giver\nis good and being a taker is bad what\ndoes that say about your mom yeah points\nwhat does it say that logic would say\nthat she was bad right so and I think\nthis is the problem with givers is that\ngivers sometimes don't acknowledge that\nlike they shouldn't be giving that the\nperson who's taking from them is doing\nlike a bad thing right like that's like\nwhen we think about the abusive\nrelationship and stuff like that because\nyou're comfortable in giving hmm and\nthere's some people who are comfortable\nin taking but and it can be hard because\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't love\nand respect your mom and I'm not saying\nthat you should blame her\nbut at the same time I think you should\nacknowledge that there is like a giver\nand a taker in this relationship\nand that I find it as much as that you\ncover everything with like positivity\nwhich i think is resilient and good I\nthink you have to acknowledge right I\nthink that the way to really love\nyourself and I'll talk about how is to\nfirst of all acknowledge that like your\nmom could have done a better job right\nso even if she was ill or whatever maybe\nshe couldn't have done a better job you\ncan forgive so here's the here's what it\nis I don't know that you've forgiven\nyour mom for raising you the way that\nshe did because you don't blame her\nright and so in a weird way like you\ncan't forgive someone for something that\nyou don't blame them for like if you\nsmack me across the face\nand I think that oh that wasn't your\nfault and there's like no forgiveness\nfrom my end because it wasn't your fault\nlike what point is there and forgiving\nsomething if the no one is at fault and\nwhen I think about what what are you not\nable to do for yourself what are you not\nable to you're not able to love yourself\nand I think part of that is like what we\nmean by love is when you indulge you're\nnot able to cut yourself some slack\nyou're not able to forgive yourself for\nbuying a painting for your wall because\nit feels indulgent for you because in\nthat moment you're a taker in your honor\ngiven in that moment I think you become\na little bit more like your mom which is\nnot someone that you want to be yeah\nyou don't see that I don't know that's a\nlot to process\nand I do I do notice that sometimes when\nI try to process things they're\nuncomfortable my brain just bounces off\nthem yes so it's very it's a very it's a\nvery difficult thing to penetrate good I\nmean I think it's very good that you're\nnoticing that I could be wrong but my\npoint here is that you know when you\nwere talking about dichotomies earlier\nright that someone can be aggressive\ntowards you and love you I think that\nthere's a dichotomy here which is that\nyou can love and respect your mom and\nnot blame her for her disability which I\ndon't think you should do and you can\nalso acknowledge that just because it's\nnot her fault doesn't mean that you\ndidn't get a bad break mm-hmm right and\nand I think that there's a part of you\nthat like because if we think about it\nit's bizarre it's like like you don't\nwant to be a taker like that's the\nproblem is that you're not willing to be\na taker you want to be a giver and\nyou've learned through a lot of\nintrospection and growth and and frankly\ndiscomfort how to take things from\npeople or receive things from people\ngifts and support on Twitch but even\nthen like it's like you won't even\nyou'll take their risk they're their\ngifts and you'll pass them on right like\nyou're like oh it's like hot potato like\nthey can give you positivity and you're\njust gonna hot potato it right out to\nyour therapist so that she can help\nother people like I haven't forbid that\nI take anything but don't give anything\nto me like let me just let me do let me\nbe a good person and go help other\npeople and that sounds wonderful but\nthere's actually something really [ __ ]\nup there which is like why can't you\njust accept people's gifts like why\ncan't the potato land with you why can't\npeople just do something for you and why\ncan't you take it why can't you be on\nthe receiving end of other people's like\ncare and affection and positivity like\nwhat within you rebels so much against\nthat because that's why you're beat the\n[ __ ] out like you might beat the [ __ ]\nbut like that's why you neglect yourself\nso hard like why do you live in a room\nI'm not I think it's fine to live in a\nSpartan room like I lived in the Spartan\nroom for years of my life as well but\nlike I just literally didn't care and I\ndon't know if it's the\nyou don't care or that when the thought\nof buying something for yourself is like\nrevolting to you yes the latter one so\nthat's [ __ ] up right and then the\nquestion is like why is it revolting to\nyou and I think it's because it's\nbecause Nick sorry\nI think it's that's okay I'm confused\nabout when you're doing that should I\nstop talking and let you get it out or\nshould I keep going do have you\ncomfortable with I don't mind\nyou I'm just wondering whatever\nfacilitates a discussion I'm comfortable\neither way but I think it kind of comes\nback to the central idea of that like I\nthink that you actually have some amount\nof resentment towards your mom and I\nthink that that resentment is valid it\ndoesn't make her a bad person it doesn't\nmake you a bad person and I think what\nyou need to do is like learn how to\nforgive because you don't forgive you\nmake excuses for people you're\nunderstanding right so like actually\nlike it through all of your positivity\nlike this is the really really subtle\nthing is you've come across as and you\nare we're really like caring and loving\nand forgiving person but you don't\nreally forgive what you do is you allow\npeople to behave badly and you're so\nunderstanding that you let them get away\nwith it just like just like you said\nwhen someone when you said that friends\nnotice that like you cut people slack\nlike we think about that as a positive\nthing and I think this is a prime\nexample of it absolutely is a positive\nthing and 90% of the way it's positive\nbut that last 10% is when it starts to\nbecome a little bit toxic that last 10%\nis when you should blame people for\nbeing mean to you you can forgive them\nbut you should absolutely blame them if\nthey're letting you down yeah and so I\nthink this issue of blame and\nforgiveness is what you need to learn\nwhich is like actually holding people\naccountable if they let you down and\nthere's this weird kind of like I mean\nsure your mom was sick and I don't know\nwhat kind of illness she has and it's\nnot my place to be judgmental but I'm\ngonna go ahead and do it anyway like I\nmean just just the raw amount of Lourdes\nif you read the Lord of the Freid\nflights note Lord of Liza's I haven't\nread it yet I still need to so it's a\nstory about like a group\nkids who wind up on an island and they\nlike sort of like become primitive and\nbrutal it's like when I hear about your\nupbringing it sounds like Lord of the\n[ __ ] flies to me it's like people are\nattacking you like adults are yelling at\nyou people are doing nice things to you\nand then being mean to you\npeople are being violent people are\nhunting you down with rocks when you're\non a paper out like what the [ __ ]\nand if you don't blame anyone for that\nlike that's not good I know it sounds\n[ __ ] weird like I think instead of\ngiving people excuses what I would\nreally think encourage you to do is\nthink a little bit about blaming them if\nyou really do feel that way dig down and\nsee if you feel something like that and\nthen forgive them and then in learning\nhow to forgive if you can forgive your\nmom I think you'll be able to love\nyourself yeah that's what I got that's\nsomething to work on that's some\nhomework yeah I mean if it doesn't sit\nwith you that's ok too i mean i'm\noftentimes wrong because i don't know\nwhat [ __ ] i'm talking about so sounds\nlike you do to me yeah i might want to\nask some questions\nabsolutely uh what decided what made you\ndecide to move what you do want to\ntwitch just the realization that i could\nwork in my office for ten hours a day\nsix days a week for the rest of my life\nand i would never make a dent in\nanyone's liking the problem or what I've\nused the problem yeah that that coupled\nwith the the realization that most of\nwhat I do in my office is repeated right\nso case in point like when I'm talking\nto you the reason I have this hypothesis\nis because I've run through this with\nanother person who is also wonderful and\npositive and resilient and just a great\nguy that everyone loves and he's just so\npositive in like like he's also a\ncaregiver\nhe's like a giver he like supports his\nfamily he supports his in-laws he\nsupports everyone and and that like in\nthere's a very like when we\ngood people we start to not want to\nadmit that we have like dark sides right\nlike like your but that's just not how\nhuman beings are weird I mean we have\nlove and compassion and we also have\nhatred and shame and fear and you sound\nlike you've done a great job you can cap\nyou can find your fear and you can find\nyour shame so easily which you really\ndeserve credit for because it's hard to\ndo that what I don't hear from you at\nall is an ounce of anger or hatred and I\njust don't think I kind of save it up\nfor things I think are okay to be mad at\nthe thing is I see a anger is like a\nhopeful emotion like it's when you don't\nstand for how things are so you have\nthis motivation to change them and\nchallenge them and so I don't let myself\nbe angry at trivial [ __ ] like drama on\nbloody Facebook but I do let myself be\nangry and justice is and let that be a\nmotivation to change things yeah but but\nbut you see that like you see how like I\nmean it sounds so wonderful right but\nyou see how [ __ ] judgmental that is\nyou see how like you don't let yourself\nfeel away about a petty thing because\nyou don't like you're not letting\nyourself be you you're judging yourself\nfor being like I think it makes sense\nthat you should be angry within justices\nand fuel that anger and like make the\nworld a better place and like let's\nprotect rabbits absolutely but at the\nsame time you're also not letting\nyourself be a taker in that moment sure\nbut I I kind of feel like there are\ncertain things that define you and I\ndon't want to be defined by how I feel\nabout trivial things when I catch myself\nreading something that genuinely doesn't\nmatter or getting annoyed it's something\nthat genuinely doesn't matter in line\nI'm like am I gotta waste hate on this I\ncan just move on like this this [ __ ] hey\nhurts me so why just just let it go is\nit hurting anyone then I don't care sure\nI'd rather direct my attention to\nconstructive things absolutely so so I\nthink that that makes sense and I think\nthere's a middle ground because I think\nyou say I'd rather I'd rather spend my\nenergy on constructive things which\nmakes sense which is exactly why you\ndon't have Archon walls right because\nyou don't allow yourself the indulgence\nof doing things that are unconstructive\nin that I actually\nit is not fair I don't think you deserve\nto only be doing things that are\nconstructive I did I think you deserve a\nbreak from time to time I think you\ndeserve to be indulgent I think you\ndeserve to be taken care of I think you\nendure deserve a day off I think you\ndeserve to [ __ ] up I think you deserve\nto put yourself first\nand that not everything in like it's so\nsubtle because it's so [ __ ] positive\nbut it's like you deserve to be a little\nbit petty like you're allowed to be a\nlittle bit petty you don't have to be a\nsaint and I'm with you that I don't\nthink you should you know spend time\ngetting wrapped up and with drama on\nFacebook like I think it's just a waste\nof everyone's time well what I'm saying\nis that you're actually at one end of\nthe extreme and I think you're way\nforward because if we think about like\nyou don't value yourself right like you\nknow you're a good person and you value\nyourself in a very like a big way but\nyou don't value yourself in like a\nlittle way mmm like are two things that\nI really relevant to that discussion and\none of them is that you don't get to\n[ __ ] up on Twitch like you don't get to\nmiss B you don't get to have a past you\ndon't get to you know mess up in your\nrelationships and things like that\nbecause those things you'll be punished\nfor those things depending on your size\nthere are people who've taken like 2\nmillion pound pay cuts because they\n[ __ ] up in a private moment with their\npartner something no one would ever have\nmillions of people angry at them for no\none judging them for no one you know\ngiving them hate mail sending death\nthreats for not affecting their job in\nany way losing sponsors for like this is\na this is a place where there is no room\nfor fuck-ups where there's no room for\nHumanity who are always perfect or you\nare in danger you have there's this\nplace people dehumanize you here and\nthat's something I think you're less at\nrisk of the most but something that\nthose of us who offer mostly just\nourselves feel every day because one day\neveryone hates you in the next day\npeople love you and it turns on a dime\nlike constant and so the other thing is\nI agree with you with the not self-care\nbecause I used to make arts I have a\ndrawer full of artwork right there I\ndon't draw i I've done one drawing in\nfour years I specialized in animation\nand I haven't drawn since I left uni and\nit's because I feel that guilt\nI don't self indulge and I feel like I'm\nnot a constructive thing to draw it's a\nself-indulgent thing so I think if I\ntake your advice I probably would too\nand I think you should because I don't\nthink you have to fix the world right\nlike you like the whole point here I\nneed is that you you undervalue yourself\nin the hierarchy of what deserves\nattention you are way too far down hmm\nand and and that I really wonder if like\nit's because you resent your mom for\ntaking so much from you and you never\nwant to be like her like oftentimes like\nyou said we you know we like you're not\nyou're not actually like you're so\nafraid like you kind of say you even\nsaid when we talked about modeling and\nhow parents model behavior but you're\nlike no no I'm the opposite of my mom\nabsolutely it's weird because a lot of\ntimes we're not the opposites of our\nparents but you point out that you've\nworked very very so if we think about it\nif the automatic idea is that if I have\nan abusive parent the chances that they\nhave an abusive child is very high and\nif they don't have an abusive chili if\ntheir child doesn't become abusive that\nis accomplished through a lot of effort\non the child's parts it's because they\novercome and fight against what they\nwere taught right yeah do you think is\nwith your position as a therapist that\nyou have a lot of confirming evidence\nfor that theory that may not be relevant\nto the world because the truth of the\nmatter is that parent the children if\nyou don't end up [ __ ] up don't come to\nyou I worry that we tarnish people who\nhave heard about abusive parents as\nlikely to become abusive themselves when\naround two-thirds of them statistically\ndon't yes I think that yeah and that a\nlot of therapists think that a lot of\npeople become abusive because they've\nbeen abused but most people can triumph\nover that it's it and we I hope that\npeople who've been through a lot [ __ ]\ndon't get stereotyped because of it\nbecause the people who come to treat\nthose who fell through the net didn't\nget the support they needed and ended up\nabusing because they don't know how to\nconnect those people need help but they\ncan also paint a picture to therapists\nand the people who help them this is\nnever too\nyou become if you have a piece of\nparents and I don't know that's true and\nI want to be one of the people that\nprove that isn't true I wanna be one of\nthe people says you know we don't always\nturn out that way and many of us can get\nover it no so I agree with you a hundred\npercent so I I'm glad you brought that\nup so I do so I so the statistics just\nsay that people who are abused are more\nlikely to be abusive in your right that\nit's about a 30 percent chance right so\nthe statistics are low the second thing\nis that I completely agree with you that\nyour future is not determined by the way\nthat you were raised in fact what I've\nseen time and time and time again in my\njob is that you can overcome those\nthings and I think what we see from you\nis that you have overcome those things\nmy point is that that overcoming is I do\nthink that the people who are abused\ngrowing up have a harder game to play\nthey're playing the game on hard mode\nthis is the way that I'd put it that\npeople who have loving parents are\nplaying the game on easy mode people who\nhave something between loving and\nabusive are playing the game on normal\nand then people who have abusive parents\nare playing the game on hard mode now\nall three of those people can beat the\nlevel at the end of the day it's just\nthe deck is stacked against them and\nsometimes the people who end up becoming\nabusive once again I don't blame them\nbecause I think that they were playing a\ntougher game yeah so and I'm with you\nthat they can overcome things if I\ndidn't think that they could overcome\nthings I couldn't do my job like my\nwhole point is that you can overcome\nthat the second thing that I want to\naddress is is there a confirmation bias\nbecause I'm a therapist\nvery possibly it's something that I\nstruggle with a lot but I really don't\nthink so because I think that you're\nassuming that the people that I see are\nbroken in some way and I don't see them\nthat way I don't see the people that I\nsee as being less than the people that I\ndon't see right so I think in a subtle\nsubtle way like that in and of itself is\na very dangerous thinking I see normal\npeople everyone I see is completely\nnormal and that's where I start with it\nthis is just a normal person and sure\ncan they be labeled with some kind of\nmental health disorder absolutely but I\ndon't think of mental health disorders\nas like disorders of people I think of\nthem is actually symptoms to deeper\nproblems that we all face yeah I've seen\nmultimillionaires that are suus\nidle because they're not doing enough\nfor their family and I've seen people in\njail who were 16 years old when they\nstarted dealing drugs because they're\nsupposed to provide for the three older\nsisters because that's what a man\n[ __ ] does who's also suicidal because\nhe can't see enough for his family if\nthere's one thing that my clinical\npractice has taught me it's that the\nperson in jail and the person who's the\nmulti-millionaire at the core is self I\nknow this sounds completely crazy\nbut are far more similar than they're\ndifferent because our society has taught\nus that these two human beings are\nfundamentally different but my work has\ntaught me that this is why I stream on\nTwitch because I don't think that the\npeople on Twitch are rejects I see\nmyself in them and I see inside sorry\nthat's okay\nanyway so I don't think that there's a\nconfirmation bias but there very well\ncould be it's something that I struggle\nright but I think statistically I also\ndon't see I mean I a fair number of\npeople in my practice or don't have even\ndon't fit criteria for a mental illness\nI I work with people who suffer and I\ntry to help people with suffering which\nwould this says is like a universal\nhuman condition but it's still possible\nthat I have a cognitive bias right it's\npossible that there's a selection bias\nit's possible that all of what I've\nlearned is like not fair or widely\napplicable but I still think when it\ncomes back to you like you what what I\nreally think is that like I really\nwonder if there's a part of you that\ndoesn't want to become your mom yeah and\nyou know you're I'm grateful for that\ntoo because I think every parent aspires\nto have a child that outdoes them and I\nhave the benefit of learning from some\nof my mom's mistakes from getting not\nhaving to live them myself to know the\npain of them and that's good too and I\nthink it's good to some degree to want\nto be different from my parents when I\nimprove on the model that they set for\nus I think that's a beautiful thing so I\nam uncomfortable believing that yeah\nthat I would like to be different I\nwould like that I can see things that I\nwouldn't want to do we'll be yeah that\nmakes a lot of sense let me ask you\nsomething are you I mean really\nwhat about your personal life but is it\nokay if I ask you about your thoughts\nabout having kids or whether you have\nkids I am NOT gonna have kids I'm not I\nI think if I do start to feel broody I\nwill adopt because I don't think the\nanswer to the world's problems is\nanother DNA copy of me and by the time\nthey have kids that DNA isn't passed on\nanymore it's gets mixed and mixed again\nuntil it's completely different its DNA\nis not it's a transient thing it doesn't\nmatter but there are people out there\nwho've been through a lot of similar\nthings to me you were waiting for\nsomebody to love them and they go and\nsit out there and loved while I create\nyet another human being in a very well\npopulated earth so I think if I did have\nkids I would go and find someone that my\ntools would be particularly relevant and\nuse so exactly yeah there it is right so\nI asked you about kids and what's your\nanswer that I'm not gonna do something\nI'm gonna do something I'm like I don't\nknow it's unclear to me what your needs\nexactly are but I hear the same axis of\nthere are people out there who need my\nhelp so who the [ __ ] am i to create\nanother genetic copy what right do I\nhave to bring in someone else into the\nworld because there's so many kids out\nthere who are suffering you see how\nthick it is [ __ ] me and what I want it's\nnot even clearly that you want kids but\nI don't think you've even entertained\nthe idea automatically it's so [ __ ]\nautomatic that actually upsets me\nbecause I think you're you're actually\nnot valuing yourself there there's a\ndifference between saying I actually\nwant kids and I'm gonna give them up but\nI don't think you'd do that see this is\nthe thing you don't even like admit to\nyourself that something is wrong and\nthen give that up you just slide right\npast it and you use greater in justices\nto justify giving things up for yourself\nit's so positive and yet like there's a\npart of me that screams that you are\ndoing something to you that has been\ndone to your entire life which is that\nyou are devaluing yourself and you were\nsaying that if there are things that are\nmore important than me that bothers me\nit bothers me really deep down because I\ndo\nthink that that kid out there who needs\na loving parent is more important than\nyou are right we all deserve to be\nimportant yeah and you do it so quickly\nand it's like clouded with so much\npositivity and that it's so easy to get\naway with and yet I feel hurt when I\nhear you say that which is [ __ ] weird\nbecause you're talking about something\nthat's so good anyway can I just say to\nthose in chat that I still think it's\nworth adopting regardless strategies\naside and that there is a certain amount\nto be gained from adopting someone and\nconnecting with someone beyond a genetic\nlevel but rather passing on what's truly\nimportant about you the thing that you\ndecided which is your identity your\nvalues and your you know your tools for\nnavigating the world and those things\nare the things you decided about itself\nthose are the things you can take credit\nfor those are the things I think really\nmatter about us we don't choose what eye\ncolor we have but we do choose who we\nare and passing on a little bit of that\nin a positive way and helping someone\nelse with that is beautiful and I think\nthat is still Parenthood and I still I\nthink it's an undervalued form of\nparenthood and I'd encourage anyone in\nchat to adopt regardless of my reasoning\neven if it might seem a little bit\ndysfunctional in this content no I mean\nbut like Anita so thank you for sharing\nthat I think it's I really do think your\nyour goals are noble and I support them\na hundred percent I think you're a\nwonderful person it's just there's\nsomething that's just so subtle about\nyou putting the rest of the world first\nlike it's a weird thing right but that's\nwhat I hear from you time and time and\ntime again is that like I put other\npeople first\nand I just don't agree with that mmm-hmm\nand in that because I think you deserve\nyou deserve being put first - hmm it's\none thing to hear that but how do you\nput it in practice because the feeling\ndoesn't go away and sometimes I push\nback the tide and I start doing things\nfor myself I can never keep it up yeah I\nhad this issue for a long time and even\nwhen I did rescue work years back I used\nto go out there I used to do anything\nand everything\nsome of it was like dangerous as well\nand I'd come home and I'd be really\nreally exhausted and I'd go back after\nan hour and do it again like I spent an\nhour at home a day for like a month and\nshe's completely burnt out and the thing\nwith all of that is like I would notice\nthe problem trying to fix it get started\nand then just fall back into again and I\njust fell back into it with it's\ndreaming yeah so so I need a great\nquestion so I think which the problem\nhere is that you're overcoming something\nand that's not a sustainable way to live\nyour life so like when you when you\nthink about like you know your desire to\nmake the world a better place is to move\naway from something within yourself does\nthat make sense\nmmm like I I think like a lot of your\ndesire for goodness in the world is like\nbecause of some badness in you like it's\njust moving away and then when you\nindulge is something from yourself it's\nlike that badness within you comes up\nfront and center and then you don't want\nthat feeling so you go out and you help\nsomeone else\nhmm which the world the world loves a\nrelationship with you because you're you\ndo for the world what all these people\ndo and they take advantage of your\nkindness the world takes advantage of\nyour kindness\nthe world is gonna take as much as you\nhave to give and it'll let you chew\nyourself out in the process and it won't\ngive two shits when you burn out and\nwhen you're exhausted the thousands of\npeople out there who benefit from your\nyou know your sacrifices will appreciate\nit and no one will be left to care for\nyou\nand that's completely fine now the\nquestion is how do you overcome that I\nthink you have to figure out where that\nsense that other people are\nfundamentally more important than I am\ncomes from and you have to explore like\nwhere you got that idea and and I know I\nkeep on harping on this this may not be\nright but like I I really do wonder if\nyou Harbor some kind of resentment from\nyour mom or towards your mom and if you\ndo harbor resentment towards your mom if\nyou can acknowledge that it may not be\nrational and it may not be fair but you\njust have to like notice it right and\nand for you to hold that your mom\nbecause you talk about your mom like an\nideal\nfigure right like you talk about her\nlike she's one-dimensional like you talk\nabout her his is intelligent in support\nof and wonderful and he'll and it's\ntragic that she like but parents are not\none-dimensional right all of us like I\nmean I hope I'm a good dad but I'm a\n[ __ ] psychiatrist so I'm sure my kids\nare gonna be [ __ ] up one day because\nthat's what happens\nstatistically right and so so I mean the\ntruth is that there's no such thing as a\nperfect parent but what I hear you\ndescribe is a perfect parent and I think\nthat's a problem yeah and as you start\nto explore in what ways like where does\nthat feeling come from like why is it\nlike when I asked you this question\nabout kids like you've launched into\nthis whole philosophical explanation and\nI think great you guys should adopt\nbecause there are a lot of kids out\nthere that need love but the question is\nas you as as I asked that question and\nyou start explaining stuff what is the\nfeeling that you're moving away from if\nI were to ask you Anita I think you\nshould have kids how do you feel if I\nsay that right right so why do we feel\ndefensive it's because something hurts\nwe have to protect something time to\ntank up so what is it that hurts with\nthe prospect of you having kids like\nforget about whether you actually should\nor shouldn't that's your choice if you\nwant to adopt by all means go do it but\nwhat I'm saying is like what what is it\nwithin you that you are feeling\ndefensive about\nyou\nwhat's wrong with you having kids\nyou\nI think I think it's a I think it's a\ncouple of things I think I wanted them\nis uh is I don't really picture myself\nin a relationship I don't picture myself\nlike I worry as well like it immediately\nbrings up the idea of like almost\nrelationships and and then I'm it's\nhandily connected to another person who\nprobably [ __ ] me over at some point\nand you know looking at all of the\nawkward single parents you have to see\nthe other parent and a list of stuff and\nI see painful connections there whereas\nI see a connection that's based on\nsomeone needing you and it's not\nincumbent on whether you'll sleep with\nthem with the approve of you or whether\nthey can handle your condition it's just\na need and that seems pure from Earth\nyou're talking about the potential\nfather of a child that you have or\nyou're talking about the child\nthemselves the potential father like I\nthink if a child needs you that very\nthat's a very clear and very easy thing\nto maintain and a very safe thing to you\nfor me it seems like that's not\nincumbent on anything whereas a\nrelationship is and they fluctuate and\nthey don't statistically last I think\nthat a child with someone carrot the\nidea if it carries a lot of pain\ncompared to the idea of just helping\nsomeone who needs honestly yes that's\nthank you for sharing that and also like\nwhoa like I feel like this is a whole\ndifferent conversation right so because\nit's interesting so I'm gonna toss your\nwords right back at you about you know\nchildren of abusers becoming abusers\nlike why do you think you have to fall\nvictim to that statistic right we're\nwilling if you can overcome your\nupbringing because that was a long shot\nright let's be honest like most people\nwho grew up in your situation where\nthey're physically abusive the child of\nteenage parents it sounds like\nand you know left to fend for themselves\nlike most of them end up like you know\nin like I mean I've worked with a lot of\npeople with substance use and it's now\nand honestly I'll tell you I mean so I\nwe sometimes not really joke about this\nbut if I can share one other thing so I\nneed I used to work in an emergency room\nI don't really do that kind of work\nanymore but for many years I worked in\nan emergency room and sometimes we've\ngot a kid who comes in and the kid has\nall these different diagnoses they've\ngotten like bipolar disorder marijuana\nuse cocaine use depression ADHD and and\nreally like with the diagnosis for the\nkid was it was something that there was\nan older woman as a psychiatric DD who\nwas brilliant\nshe was a nurse practitioner and she\nwould say yeah the kid has [ __ ] life\nsyndrome it's not that they have\ndepression and bipolar and ADHD it's\njust like they've got just like a [ __ ]\nlife like they don't have stability in\ntheir house they don't have parents who\nare like stable they just you know the\nchild services people are involved and\nthe thing is it sounds like you had [ __ ]\nlife syndrome like it sounds like you\nhave grew up in a place where you don't\nreally have stability or care or support\nand you overcame the odds and so it\nblows my mind that like you're afraid of\nthe odds right because if you've\novercome such long-ass odds to become\nthe person that you are who's caring and\ncompassionate and resilient like why on\nearth would you think that if you chose\nto spend the rest of your life with\nsomeone and this gets into monogamy or\nwhatever so like I mean let's not even\npresume that saying this is probably a\ndifferent conversation but like you have\nso many fears around so your relation\nyour fear of having a child of your own\nhas nothing sounds like it has nothing\nto do the child has everything to do\nwith the partner yeah and so like I\nthink if I mean so that's got to be\ndealt with that has nothing to do with\nadoption that's just like what you know\nlike where do you get the idea that you\nknow this is gonna like be doomed to\ndisaster because that also hurts me to\nhear because I I think that it's\npossible and and you know I think it's\npossible for people to meet each other\nto be invested in each other and to\nbuild a life with each other and the\nfact that you've taken that off of the\ntable I think makes\nwe feel sad I think they have some\nhealing to do I I spent several years in\na DV situation what is that domestic\nviolence ah so I had to flee someone I\nhad to give up my life I was midway\nthrough studying I got my degree I was\nstudying for higher education and I had\nto just abandon it all move\nleave all my friends to get away from it\nhe tried to end my life it's [ __ ]\nscary yeah yeah that explains woman\nyeah and yeah it's been hard to connect\nwith people since I have succeeded\nI had another six year relationship\nafter that but I that wasn't the best\nrelationship either but for other\nreasons he he never harmed me but yeah I\nkind of feel I yes still getting past\nthat one yeah um and obviously that's\nhow I get that window into how our\nrelationship with our parents become so\nfamiliar that we end up reliving them\nwith our friendships and relationships\nthere are I'm very aware of that and\nstill figuring my way through it I'm\nstill figuring out how to draw people of\na different kind and to be in a safer\nmore stable place because sadly and\nhere's the thing people get crossed with\nwomen who keep ending up in with a piece\nof relationship there's so many jealous\nmen who like she only gets with\n[ __ ] more women like bird boys and\nall those generalizations but the truth\nis I didn't end up with bad people\nbecause I love bad boys I was hopeful\nand naive every time and every bad\nperson will tell you they're good at the\nstart and if you're hopeful you believe\nthem yeah and so I I end up convincing\nmyself never again I'm gonna go for\nsomeone nice someone kind animated so\ncan I tell you to go for something else\nyeah I don't want you to go for someone\nwho's nice I want you to go for yourself\ndo you mean so like the undercurrent for\neverything that I'm hearing from you and\nNita is that you put other people first\nI want you to be in a relationship where\nyou come first I don't even know what\nthat looks like\nabsolutely and that's the [ __ ]\nproblem that is the [ __ ] problem is\nthat you have no idea what it's like to\nput yourself first you have no idea what\nit's like to be in a relationship where\nyou get put first and that I think\nsomeone in your [ __ ] upbringing\ndeserve some blame for and so I think it\nstarts with baby snacks yeah get\nyourself some artwork spend some time\npainting and see what comes up you're\nworking with a therapist now no I don't\nhave okay well okay but then I would say\nlike and then like explore that right\nlike what is that guiltiness like that\nguiltiness is you putting yourself first\nlike [ __ ] put yourself first you\ndeserve it and you've already made a\nworld like you've done enough like\nyou're already in that positive right\nhow many people did you send to your\namazing therapist to is life-changing I\ndon't know yeah I'm gonna have to ask\nher who's like I mean if you if if you\nsent more than one then you're not\npositive for life fine so you deserve a\nbreak and like do something for yourself\nand put yourself first and you've done\namazing I mean I neither you've just\ndone such an amazing job but like your\npositivity is infuriating because it\ncomes in and you're 90% there but that\nlast 10% has to come from like loving\nyourself and choosing yourself and\nputting yourself first we're here on\nTwitch where everyone is so [ __ ]\nselfish and I don't think they are by\nthe way I have a better opinion in which\nI sometimes wonder I mean I realize when\nyou're saying earlier about you know\ntwitch and failure and all that you\nlosing my income and all that kind of\ncrap I I think I mean you must be right\nand I can see that and at the same time\nthere's a part of me that wonders about\nlike how much of that is because of the\nway that you view the world that if\nthere's love there's gonna be taking\naway of love eventually hmm right like I\nsee that same dynamic of like when you\nlook at Twitter like this is gonna be\ntemporary the gravy train is gonna stop\nat some point and they're gonna abandon\nme yeah yeah you you don't know how hot\nin the head you are with that my\ncommunity will tell you as well because\nwhen I first arrived I went from in\nthree months I ended up with like 300\nthousand followers um the first three\nmonths like I went viral and it was\nscary but I didn't get used to it\neveryone's like you're a big thing now\nis like no I'm not I'm viral everyone's\ngonna go on to the next thing in a few\ndays and everything will go back to 20\nviewers again and I just did not believe\nit and I kept saying that any minute now\nany minute now for like a year I was\nlike any minute now they're all gonna go\nand they stayed and I've been like what\nlike this has been like brain scram so\nI've not I've I'd never understood it\nyes and this is this is gonna sound\ncrazy but like I think twitch like this\nis gonna sound [ __ ] weird I think\ntwitch is teaching you how to love\nyourself right because like this is\nexactly what happens to someone who's\nbeen in an abusive relationship after\nabusive relationship after abuse is a\nrelationship after abusive relationship\nis they meet someone who's actually nice\nand they're like what the [ __ ] is going\non yeah yeah it's like why haven't they\nabandoned me like what is this I didn't\nI don't this is not how things work\npeople get interested me in me for a\ntime and then they start throwing rocks\nlike we're and then the longer they stay\nthe more confusing it gets yeah and it's\njust bewildering because you weren't\ntaught how this works you weren't taught\nthat you can have intrinsic value and\nthat people can come around and hang\naround because they like you for you are\nthat's it yeah yeah and that that is\nsomething but I I've been genuinely\nconfused by and sometimes people have\nlike donated thousands of pounds or they\nhave you know they've they've been\nfollowing me for like ninety months and\nI'm like why are you still here like and\nI'm confused and I will openly express\nit I haven't quite learnt how to come to\nterms with it yet because it is it\ndirect\nsee it confronts something I don't know\nhow to process yeah\nso let me I'll leave you with this to\nthink about and then we'll see I mean if\nyou have other questions and stuff but I\nwant you to entertain a crazy idea okay\nI want you to entertain that people can\nsee value and you without you giving\nanything to them I want you to entertain\nthe idea that sometimes you're a rabbit\nbut you don't have to give anything in\nreturn and that people will just\nappreciate you for being you and that\nyou don't have to adopt or save animals\nor other things to be like valued in\nlife that you can have and it sounds\ncrazy\njust intrinsic value not extrinsic value\nbut just intrinsic value that just by\nvirtue of who you are you have earth and\nthat you don't need to do anything to be\nworth something yeah that makes so much\nsense if I picture applying to somebody\nelse\nthat's the weird thing like that's\nthat's immediately when you're\ndescribing that it's easier to remember\nand understand those words if I'm\npicturing us describing someone other\nthan me which kind of emphasizes yes I\nthink you're very much on to something\nyeah right and so I think you've got to\nexplore that and I think it's it\nliterally Anita it starts with little\nthings like it starts like I mean when\nyou say people don't say nothing on your\nwalls like so get yourself something for\nyourself yeah like do you have a bathtub\nI do do you have bubble baths no do you\nhave things do you ever use the bathtub\nand enjoy being in a bathtub with like\nbubble baths or other kinds of bath\nbombs or whatnot no I don't do that yeah\nso I think you should try like I think\nyou should start start with Patty and\nworthless indulgences because you're\nworth it\nthank you any last thoughts or questions\nno I just wanted to say thank you for\neverything that you do I think that\nhonestly I've watched a bit of your work\nbefore here on the channel and I think\nthe beauty of it is that a lot of what's\nbeing described as very normal human\nproblems and a lot of people in chat can\ndefinitely relate to it you're helping\npeople process themselves and the people\naround them and contextualize behaviour\nthat they've seen or experiencing that\nthey don't really understand yet and I\nsee that fitting for place fitting into\nplace for people in chat people who've\nseen your work I've heard them talk\nabout just in the brief periods that\nthey've dipped in it just transforming\nthings for them and I think what you're\ndoing is beautiful I thank you ever so\nmuch for bringing this to the platform\nbecause it's definitely what's needed\nand yeah I know that this is gonna keep\ngrowing and it's beautiful well I am\nyou're very welcome and I greatly\nappreciate your positive sentiment it's\npart of what keeps us growing and I\ncould say that I'm gonna say the same\nthing right back at you because I think\nyou to bring a lot of positivity and\nwe'll submiss like I'm not too familiar\nwith too many twitch streamers but I\nthink it's awesome how you engage in\nconversations or on mental health I\nthink it's awesome how you try to be a\npositive person I mean I know we've been\ntrying to get you to not be a positive\nperson for less\nI really do think it's great that you\nyou do try to make the world a better\nplace and and the world really does\nbenefit from people like you I mean if\nwe had a you know 100 people like you\n10,000 people would be better off I\nthink the only thing that I'll return to\nis that this goes for everyone else out\nthere too is that you don't you should\nabsolutely make the world a better place\nbut I don't believe it has to come at\nthe cost of yourself I don't think\nthat's fair but I you know I think what\nyou do is awesome and I think that\nyou're educating people around\nTourette's and mental health and like\nteaching acceptance and and all that\nkind of stuff we're completely behind\nyou Anita do you do you want to meditate\nsure I teach people how to meditate let\nme just think about what oh man I do you\nhave anything you must indulge in some\nways right\ndo you have junk food at home I buy\ntreats put them in a box and I'm feel\ngood that I have them there and then\ndon't eat them okay so do you have any\ntreats at home right now go get one yeah\ngo get one okay I'm gonna turn the\ncamera off real quick sure go get it\nokay now yep so you guys should try this\ntoo yep cameras off okay so we're gonna\ndo for Mental Health Awareness Month\nwe're gonna do treat eating stream so if\nyou guys have some kind of junk food or\nsomething go get it\nright shouldn't be shouldn't be a big\nask for for most of our audience and if\nyou guys eat too much junk food you can\nalso get something go get something\nhealthy to eat as well go get whichever\nthing you get less you eat less often\nokay okay so should be back now okay so\nwe I'm gonna let's give people like 30\nseconds to go get their own food okay\nwhat did you get I got some white\nchocolate awesome it's unopened mm-hmm\nsee that's the crime yeah I've had it\nfor ages is it expired are you gonna get\nsick no no it's not expired it's fine\nokay so let's get started so I want you\nto start and eat it by sitting up\nstraight closing your eyes and I'm gonna\nask you to think out loud a little bit\nokay so when you think about eating the\nchocolate what comes up in your mind\nmm-hmm I can already taste it okay mmm\nand does any kind of emotion come up\nuh kind of like relief I guess okay okay\nso what keeps you from eating it if you\ncan taste it and eating it brings you\nrelief what keeps you from me to eating\nit what do you think I feel like I\nshould be doing other things\nmm-hmm okay do you feel like you should\nbe doing two other things now no no\nafter I check okay so the first okay so\nnow well so let's just zero in on that\nright so let's zero in on the\nacknowledgement that the reason it has\nbeen left it it is left uneaten so far\nis because you feel like you should have\nbeen doing other things and let's also\nnotice that for some reason and let's\nnot be jump to conclusions that feeling\ndoesn't appear to exist within you right\nnow hmm right so now I want you to open\nthe chocolate okay and then take off a\npiece is it like a big it looks like I'm\njust looking at it it seems yeah perfect\nokay so close your eyes okay think about\neating it for a second does any kind of\nlessons to come up taste like your\nmother sorry it does it wait but this is\nit bread does it does anything come up\nfor you no okay so let's just notice for\na moment that as her mind becomes less\noccupied that takes in grease\nso that's movable so now go ahead and\ntake a bite of your chocolate\njust notice how it tastes and tell us\nhow you feed pretty damn good but\nshouldn't you be doing something else\nlike this ok now the feelings coming\nback how do I push it away again what is\nthe feeling don't push it away um gilts\nok so shame eyes opened guilt and shame\ncame close the eyes\nnotice the guilt and shame give them\ndon't try to run away from them give\nthem your fullest attention what do you\nfeel\nlike I shouldn't be doing this okay\nso where is that sensation that I\nshouldn't be doing this hmm I feel it\nlike a squeeze Wow\nI squeezed them my chest or okay I feel\nlike I should okay so you feel squeezed\nand the pressure in your chest so I want\nyou to do is take a deep breath in feel\nthat squeeze expand and then relax and\nlet it squeeze you let it squeeze let it\ncontract your chest down and now breathe\ninto it and then let it squeeze and then\na third time\nfeel it expand that squeeze enos and\nthen let the squeeze contract back down\nlet it deflate and now continue your\nnormal breathing and notice what's\nhappening in the sensation within you I\nfeel like it is receding okay I feel I\nfeel like I feel like I feel like even\njust acknowledging that it helps me\nmm-hmm to kind of shut it down like it\nfeels less powerful when I actually\nfacing it good yeah so we're gonna go to\nlevel 2 take another bite and anticipate\nlet yourself recognize that that guilt\neyes closed it's gonna get stronger with\nyour eyes open\nlet yourself let it come in right\nrecognize that there's a part of you\nthat is guilty and ashamed and that that\npart of you that negative part of you\ndeserves a seat at the table you don't\nall have to be a wonderful person you're\nallowed to be a negative person - you're\nallowed to have negative feelings we\ndon't want them we don't want you to run\naway from them that thing is not hideous\nright there they're your whole life\nyou've been taught that there are parts\nof you that are hideous that needs to\nchange\nwhat's happening to it\nso I'm just letting it be there it kind\nof feels like an edge like I'm like okay\nnow you're done put it away now like\ndrop off the chocolate put it away\nthey're like that's my media edge good\ngood so notice that part of you right\nand then tell that part of you that\nyou're gonna take a third piece of\nchocolate and what you're going to do is\nthis third piece of chocolate\nyou're not gonna necessarily push the\nnegativity away but you're also going to\nlet yourself taste that third piece of\nchocolate and just enjoy it as much as\nyou can okay it gets to bark but you\ndon't have to respond to it right you're\nnot telling it to be quiet but you're\nalso not giving into it so the third\npiece I want you to try to really enjoy\nlike really taste it pay attention to\nyour mouth pay attention to the\nsensation of it pay attention to the way\nthat it melts pay attention to the\nflavor the sweetness the enjoyment we\ndon't want to push away the thus\nqueasiness you can breathe into it if\nyou want to but really try to just enjoy\nthe chocolate like so it looks like it's\na good [ __ ] chocolate white chocolate\ndelicious mm-hmm and just be like yeah\nthis is great the last question I'm\ngoing to ask you you don't have to\nanswer this the right way you can answer\nit the wrong way is is it okay for you\nto do this is it okay for you to enjoy\nis it okay for you to not donate that\nchocolate to a homeless person stop\nreading my mind is it\nis it okay to feel both answers yes\nthat's the right answer actually right\nbecause I have a Wow I have Wow\nI have well I have well I have the\nmental answer and I guess the emotional\nanswer and they're both yep good so so\nnow now we're gonna come to a close with\nthis practice so just sit with both of\nthose answers and see if you can find\nany emotional answer that resonates with\nyour rational answer right can do you\nfind any enjoyment within yourself yeah\nso so notice that too right we don't\nnecessarily want logic versus emotion we\nwant emotion versus emotion we want you\nto recognize that there's a part of you\nthat enjoys this experience and there's\na part of you that doesn't enjoy this\nexperience yeah that actually the\nemotion that you feel is a judgment for\nthe enjoyment so that's actually more of\na rational process than I think you give\nit credit for yeah so there's emotion\nversus an emotion and then there's\nrational thought versus rational thought\njudgment versus yeah of course it's okay\nfor you to enjoy something and then down\nhere there's a sense of tightness and\nthere's also a sense of like enjoyment\nor pleasure yeah and and either you must\ndo this okay so you pick whatever it is\nwhether it's buying something for\nyourself and and understand that one day\nyou may adopt a child or maybe you'll\nadopt half a dozen because why adopt one\nwhen you can save six people like yeah\nand then understand that one of the most\nimportant things that you can teach\nthose children is how to appreciate who\nthey are and how to derive enjoyment\nfrom life yeah right and how are you\ngoing to teach them that unless you know\nit\nit's very so do something for yourself\nand do like you're gonna notice it's\nlike I don't know if you go to the\ngrocery store because of covet or\nwhatever but you're gonna have a chance\nto indulge yourself and then you're\ngonna rebel against it but but support\nthat part of you that bought the\nchocolate that's the one that we want\nright because in that moment a you know\nit's like yeah I'm gonna get me some\nchocolate it's a support that part of\nyou cuz that that part of you deserves a\nseat at the table too and and spend some\ntime painting and notice how you feel\nabout yourself and even if you can't\ndelude yourself or trick yourself into\ndoing it for yourself you can trick\nyourself into doing it by telling you\nthat you're actually doing it for the\nchild that you're gonna adopt one day\nyeah right but do this and for people\nwho are at home if you guys are way too\nindulgent you can do the same exercise\nwith something that is not good I mean\nthat is good for you that you don't\nenjoy and just pay attention to what\nhappens in yourself but anyway thoughts\nor questions before we wrap up and eat\nit know this has been really great thank\nyou for everything yeah it's been an\nabsolute pleasure to talk to someone who\nis just so aware of their internal\nenvironment and and it's been awesome\nand I think you're just an amazing\nperson it's been a blast talking to you\nif you want to talk again we can dig\ninto why the [ __ ] this whole\nrelationship thing and what you're\nafraid of there that's a whole other can\nof worms but I mean I'd love to help you\nunderstand that you deserve to be loved\nand committed to by a particular person\nyou know like you deserve that too like\nyou deserve to be put first by someone I\nyeah thank you yeah anyway so it was\nawesome thank you very much and stay\nsafe you too have a great evening\nadios oh yeah okay we did meditation\nokay our\nso let's think about okay so guys a\ncouple of week app so first of all so I\nneed is amazing and let's remember I\nwant you guys to be careful right\nbecause Anita is so positive but like\nthat comes at the cost of herself and\nthat's not something that we want right\nlike we want her to like you know it's\njust not fair it's not fair that she\nshould sacrifice her own happiness or\nown wants for the sake of other people\nis it noble absolutely is it good\nabsolutely is it fair No right so like\nlet's remember that the way the world\nworks is we sacrifice for others and\nothers sacrifice for us that's how the\nOttoman Turks so I think that it's\namazing what she wants to do but then\nlike we should and she's doing a good\njob and I think apparently twitch at and\nhas taught her this is taught her how to\nreceive right which is amazing like\nlet's just let's not forget that that's\nthat's awesome that you guys like think\nabout this everyone thinks tweet chat is\ntoxic but y'all aren't toxic right you\ncan be toxic and this comes back to\nAnita saying can I feel both of them at\nthe same time absolutely there's a toxic\n[ __ ] in you and there is a wonderful\nwholesome person in you there's AoE\nhealing and there's AoE damage right\nthat we are both things that she can\nlove her mom and respect her mom and be\ngrateful for her mom and also resent her\nmom for being incapable right that's\nwhat kids do kids blame adults for all\nkinds of irrational [ __ ] that's how kids\noperate that's why they're kids they're\nlike we're daddy like why does the Sun\nhave to go down I don't want to go to\nsleep why can't the Sun stay up forever\n[ __ ] you dad like that's what kids do\nbut I don't get any of that from her and\nit's okay to be it's it's there's a\ndifference between being rationally\nupset with someone and being\nirrationally upset with someone and like\nit's okay to be irrationally upset with\nsomeone that's what most of being upset\nis it's irrational it's not logical\nright so it does\nhave to make sense and you don't have to\ndismiss it you're allowed to feel the\nway that you you do even if it's\ncompletely incompetent now should you\nlet it dictate all of your actions no\nbut I think this is where I needa gets\ninto trouble is she does let it dictate\nher actions right she lets the\nrelentless positivity dictator actions\nshe lets the fundamental premise that\nshe is worth worth less than other\npeople dictate her actions and it looks\nso beautiful on the outside but it's not\nfair to her right and what's awesome is\nthat twitch at his his talker this like\nyou guys get this you guys got her hat\nlike you guys got her there probably a\ntherapist to his life changing has\nsomething to do with it let's be fair\nbut when it comes to people who\nsubscribe to her stuck around or you\nknow sub for like 21 months or whatever\nlike you guys sent her signals that were\ncontrary to her worldview which is that\npeople leave and that people don't have\nvalue order that she doesn't have value\nand and that's amazing so I believe in\nthe the healing power of twitch at and\nalso the absolute toxicity of twitch\nchat' I know you guys are capable of\nboth that's why I make it makes it fun\nso listen this has been fantastic I you\nknow it was so interesting because when\nI when I talked to people who are so\ncapable and so awesome I always struggle\nwith the sense of like whether I can\nhelp them in some way not that I need to\nright but like Anita has come so far but\nI want her to see that take that next\nstep right I really want her to and and\noh wow I needed a thousand dollars Wow\nthank you very much Anita and yeah I\nmean I think like this is what we've got\nto do so this is what we want to do\nright so this is what we're doing right\nnow is we are we are doing Mental Health\nAwareness Month and we're gonna help\npeople in the way that we're gonna help\npeople is through our recovery coaching\nprogram and what I'm trying to do is\nteach people to like talk to you guys\nand help you like figure out what is\nholding you back because this is crazy\nand just think about this for a second\nright I need is such an amazing person\nand yet she is still holding herself\nback\nthe way that she's holding herself back\nis like oh do you guys hear that when I\nasked her like have you thought about\nhaving kids and she has this whole like\nrational justified response that is in\nresponse to something that she feels\nlike I can't have children like there\nare thousand questions that I want to\nask her and at the top of the list is\none that I think is incredibly hurtful\nbut I think she's got to explore which\nis was she'll an unwanted child like\nwhat's going on with like her being an\nunwanted like where does the worst come\nfrom it infuriates me that she has to\nfeel that way that she feels that way\nabout herself\nit's not fair she shouldn't need to feel\nthat way you know I don't know that we\ncan do this but we're gonna try so we're\ngonna try to train coaches or we have\ntrained coaches and we are actually\npretty good I'm understating things so\nwe collected data for eight weeks and we\nsaw that the coaches can actually help\npeople so we're gonna do this right\nbecause here's the problem here's what\nhealthy gamer is about she asked me why\ndid I start streaming so I'll tell you\nguys and this is why we're trying to\nraise money so if you guys subscribe or\ndonate or whatever like thank you very\nmuch this is this is what we're about so\ntwo years ago I posted on reddit I said\nI'm a psychiatrist who's interested in\nvideo game addiction ask me anything\npost hit the front page a lot of great\nresponses and then people started\nreaching out to me and I was like oh\n[ __ ] people think like oh this isn't\nthat wonderful that oh like oh you a\nfamous full heart oh my goodness front\npage oh it's so wonderful I was actually\nterrified my response was abject terror\nbecause what I heard from people over\nand over and over again is like help me\nand then I said I can't and then the\nnext person said help me and I said I\ncan't and the next person said help me\nand I said I can't and that happened\nlike literally a couple of thousand\ntimes and then I was like oh [ __ ] there\nis a huge problem out there and like no\none knows amidst ovid going on I want\nyou guys to think about this for a\nsecond okay\nwhen Kove it happened we tweeted out we\nsaid how are you guys dealing with kovat\nand the response that we got is that\nit's actually not that bad it's not very\ndifferent from my regular life and so my\nfirst thought was oh that's pretty cool\nlike people are more adaptive towards\nyou know Kovan because they're gamers\nbut then another part of me like jumped\nup and thought something really horrible\nthe rest of the world is falling apart\nbecause they're quarantined and we live\nlike this every single day that Kovac\nquarantine is a way of life for our\ngeneration that is [ __ ] up just think\nabout that for a second it's not that\nwe're more like the fact that we're\nadapted to Cove it is [ __ ] terrifying\nright that there's a growing population\nof people who lives like this day in a\nday out the rest of the world is [ __ ]\nfalling apart and we're like what the\n[ __ ] is wrong with you guys just stay at\nhome oh you can't get your nails did\nlike who the [ __ ] cares right but\nthere's a generation of people who lives\nin quarantine their whole life we heard\nit from Anita she was a agoraphobic for\nyears right the world is a dangerous\nplace we don't want to live out there\nand what I heard from people was even\nmore disturbing was that I I went out\nand I saw a psychiatrist\nI saw a therapist because that's what\neveryone says like oh you're you're\n[ __ ] up go see you psychotics\nyou're ill you have depression it's an\nillness right it's an illness it's not\nyour fault man it's an illness it's just\nsomething's wrong with you like your\nneuro chemistry's [ __ ] up man it's not\nyour fault\nyou're just something's broken in your\nbrain go and get that fixed and then\nyou'll be fine and they do that they go\nand they see a psychiatrist psychiatrist\ntalks to them for 45 minutes\nsays yeah you have depression because\nthey check their DSM checklist right we\nhave a checklist of things that okay if\nyou meet five out of nine criteria you\nhave depression sleep change an interest\nguilt lower energy level concentration\nappetite sluggish and suicidality if you\nhave five out of nine of those you're\ndepressed and then they give them a pill\nand they gamer reject lifelong\nquarantine er goes home and he takes his\npill and he says huh I'm fixed I'm cured\nand then they log on and they play video\ngames and then the next day I'm cured\nI'm gonna take my pill take their pill\nevery single day and they continue\nplaying their games in\nchanges in their life and then these\n[ __ ] reach out to me they're like can\nyou help me because you seem to\nunderstand something that these other\npeople are saying I'm like oh [ __ ]\nwhy did I start streaming on Twitch it's\nbecause of oh [ __ ] it's because when\nAnita was at the meat market as a child\nshe saw a rabbit that was in a cage that\nwas gonna get butchered so she tried to\ndo something about it\ny'all are my rabbit right I see the rest\nof the world not doing for us what we\nneed I see a mental health system that\nis too old the average age of a\npsychiatrist in America is like 55 too\nold too slow how long does it take to\nget an appointment Oh three months do\nyou have three months to waste in a\nsense yes because you guys aren't [ __ ]\ndoing anything but in a sense no because\nif you're like a sophomore in college\nand you get FS for three months your\nacademic career is ruined and it's too\nexpensive right\nhow much does I mean my hourly rate is\nastronomical and I see a lot of people\nfor free and that's why I urge an\nastronomical rate but it's expensive\nhealth insurance is expensive depending\non where you live wait times are super\nlong they'll see you for 12 sessions\nwe've heard horror stories who was it\nIngrid a couple of weeks ago for like\none week ago told us the story of how\nshe went to see a psychiatrist\nshe was waiting for 45 minutes into her\nappointment the guy talks to her for\nfive minutes says I can't help you and\nsends her out the door like what the\n[ __ ] the mental health system is not\nmeeting our needs right now and it's so\nmuch more than just mental illness right\nthere are like so many problems like we\ndon't have forward momentum we we rack\nup tens of thousands of dollars of debt\nfor jobs that pay us twenty five\nthousand dollars a year like something\nis [ __ ] up and and you know I don't I\ndon't necessarily think it's our fault\nand so what am I gonna do about it what\nam I gonna do about it right that's the\nquestion like what am I gonna do this is\nwhat I'm gonna do I'm gonna start\nstreaming on Twitch and then the number\nof people that ask me for help\nincreased now we get thousands per month\nasking for help so what the [ __ ] like\nwhat am I going to do about that\nI'm just gonna say like oh I'm sorry I\ncan't help you I only have 24 hours in\ntoday that's what I did for a while then\nI felt bad about myself I was like I\nhave to do something like I can't just\nsay no I'm sorry I can't help you I've\ngot to do something so it's like okay so\nwe're gonna start training people and\nlike can I teach people to help other\npeople that's where our coaching program\nwas born because I don't think that\nstreaming is enough like I know that AoE\nhealing is awesome\nand I believe that people get healed but\nit's not enough right we got to do\nsomething about it and so this is where\nour coaching program is born this is why\nwe have a discord this is why we have a\ncommunity I found out recently this is\namazing so I didn't do any of this or\nmods on discord they deserve a lot of\nprops too so there's like a cleaning\nhour where people log on to our discord\nand they cleaned together for an hour we\ntalked about our emotions we talked\nabout our feelings we talked about all\nthis kind of stuff there's a coding\nworkshop there's a book club because\nhere's the thing the world is not gonna\nhelp us right we've learned that like\nit's not gonna help us like the world is\nnot filled with people like Anita if the\nworld was filled with people I can\neither you guys one need to do [ __ ]\nbecause you could sit around and do give\nlife the 10% that you give it right now\nand Anita will step in and give you guys\n90% and y'all will be fine but the truth\nis that they're not going to give you\n90% I can't give you 90% I can give you\n20% I can give you 30% it's not fair\nit's fair it's not fair that it's 50/50\nit's sad but we're gonna do it and\nyou've got to do it too so you've got to\nstep up you've got to take the time to\nget help right so that's why we're doing\nthe coaching program and we have way\nmore people that want to be coached then\nwe have capacity right now so we're\ngonna train more people we've we've had\nthousands of people who want coaching\nand not all of them can pay so we're\ngonna try to make it affordable and\nthat's why we're doing the stream\nbecause some of y'all are broke which is\nfine and we don't want to be an\norganization that turns people away due\nto a new probably will because we'd go\nunder in a moment but you know what\nthat's why we're trying to do stuff like\nthis that you know I try to I mean our\nretreat in 2019 was free I don't know\nthat we can do that again because the\nretreat may be way bigger this time I\ndon't know when we're gonna do a retreat\nbut it's one of our stretch goals I have\nyou want to do when my whole [ __ ]\nteam is like you can't do this dr. K you\ncan't open your doors to the internet\nbecause you don't know who's gonna show\nup but there's a part of me the troll\ninside of me is like yes you can yes you\ncan you can do something absolutely\ncrazy because that's what streaming on\nTwitch is all of my colleagues who are\npsychiatrist said oh you can't do this\nyou're gonna get sued so I hired some\nvery expensive lawyers and they wrote me\na lot of disclaimers and then we'll see\nso that's what we're doing it's mental\nhealth awareness month so become aware\nof your mental health show up here we're\ngonna be doing some
