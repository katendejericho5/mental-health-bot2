    "transcript": "yeah great question so it starts by\nrecognizing\nthat like you're looking for answers\nfundamentally because this is the way\nyou've been trained\nso like literally the reason i ask you\nthe question where do you get the idea\nthat there is\na formula for success it's because like\neverywhere around you like even though\nyou've figured out and this is huge for\nyou by the way i think it's awesome that\nyou figured this out\nthat your formula for success is not\nyour parents formula for success\nthe next step is for you to figure out\nis there a formula for success\ni'm actually not home i'm uh stuck\nat hamburg germany right now because of\nthe corona\nyeah so i have to like stream from phone\nand work from chrome and like do\neverything from my phone right now oh\nwow so\nyeah i'm sorry okay you're stranded\nthat's fantastic\nit's okay it's an experience you know\nthere are some good things coming with\nit\nso yeah i hope it's involved\ncan you tell me about those and it's\nmira right\nyes yeah nice to meet you nice to meet\nyou too so\nuh mira what are we talking about today\noh so much i wanted to talk to you about\nwell um first of all i wanted to say\nthat\ni think what you've been doing on twitch\nis\nabsolutely amazing just like\nabsolutely astonishing like uh\ni'm just grateful that people\nactually trying to bring awareness into\nmental health in the gaming community\nbecause i've been streaming on twitch\nfor like over five years and i've never\never seen anything like so useful\nlike it's please keep doing what you're\ndoing that's all i wanted to say\nthank you so much i i really appreciate\nthe the\nsupport and and kind of the positive\nwishes it keeps\nus going so i'm grateful for your\nsupport\nyeah so yeah um i started\nwatching you from the very beginning\nactually like the first stream that you\ndid with byron\nyeah the first time that you stream with\nbyron i actually\nuh watched the whole thing and i had\nlike a very strong reaction to that\nuh for two reasons actually\nwell the first one is because i could\nrelate to like what byron was talking\nabout\num me and byron we don't keep in touch\nbut like back like\nfew like years ago we kind of had a\nsimilar\nlike we connected on a level of like\ndepression and like how we\nfelt yeah um so when he was talking\nabout all these issues with you\nit just it was like trigger point for me\nso i was kind of like reliving some of\nmy experiences and all the conversations\nthat you were having with him i found\nvery helpful um like i kept reflecting\non that and\nyeah so obviously that had um an impact\non me\nand as i mentioned like the fact that i\nhaven't seen anything like this\nuseful on twitch for years and years i\nmean yeah\ntwitch just brings some entertainment\nhere and there\nbut like actual like\nknowledge like actual help\nlike it's just i just think it's amazing\nso for me it was like wow\nyeah so i i think um you know a lot of\npeople i think\nbyron's courage was really instrumental\nin in\nyou know demonstrating to people that\nlike you can talk about things that are\nnormally hidden\nand yeah and that you don't have to be\nashamed or afraid of\nof what's on the inside and yeah\nso what was it about and the other thing\nthat's you know i guess not that\nsurprising but i think a lot of\nstreamers and our community because\nstreamers are like\nyou know we think about streamers as\ndifferent but i think they're like\nthey're part of\nour community right like they're just of\ncourse yeah and\nand so depression and mental health\nproblems are something that we all\nstruggle with\num and so was there something in\nparticular that like sort of\nwas uh you know resonated with you about\nthe the talk with byron\nwell yeah i already mentioned that\nme and him like interacted before in the\npast and\nthere was this one discussion that i had\nwith him\none-on-one with off stream we were\ntalking about\nnot feeling much\nyou know that issue when you feel like\nyou\nhave almost everything in life well you\nknow that like a normal person would\nthink they need to feel happy but you\njust don't\nfeel happy and on top of that you just\ndon't feel much at all\nand yes exactly\nand like the more you you dug it with\nbyron the more like you realize that\nthere was\ntraumas that you know sort of affected\nthe way that he is\nso i really i try to because i try to\ncontact you uh pretty much right after\nyou talk to byron\nbut it was a little hard to get in touch\nso um but i didn't get disencouraged\nno no it's absolutely understandable you\nhave other things to do\nso um i try to sort of dig that on my\nown and\ni try to good for you um yeah i just try\nto get like information\nonline and like work on myself and\nfigure out what was really wrong\nand i mean i progressed kind of\nish i had some progress through that but\num can you tell us a little bit about\nthat journey\nuh yeah i can\num well\ni did realize that a lot\nof my mental issues just came from the\nway my parents raised me always in it\nlike that with everyone pretty much\nand um a lot of it i didn't even realize\nthat i\nhad because i thought that's just how\nworld is\nyou know because their parents raised a\ncertain way and we like believe that's\nit\nabsolutely yeah so it's kind of hard to\nreflect on that like on your own but um\nabsolutely\nso um let me just\nsorry one second i'm gonna sit cross\nlike that's the tapping sorry about that\ntwitch\nyeah that's what i'm doing too so\nmira would you like like is it okay if i\nask you some questions about that\nokay and if you know if there's anything\nthat i ask that you're not comfortable\nanswering just let me know and\nand you know you don't have to say\nanything that you're not comfortable\nwith\num so let's start with the so so when\nyou said that it was\na lot of it has to do with the way that\nyour parents raised you can you tell me\na little bit about what growing up was\nlike for you\nyes i can\num i grew up in um\ni have to be careful with the words i\nchoose you\num careful about the words you choose\nuh my parents they're more or less like\npublic figures so\ni have to like be careful okay\nuh-huh so and that's like another big\nthing that added to my childhood because\nyou can\ntruly do what you want\nall the time you have to like be very\ncareful about like\nhow you present yourself okay\num not so much i guess on twitch they\ncan twitch\nthat's why i like try to you know keep\nthat part separate very separate\nbecause i feel like i can um i feel more\nfree to express myself and twitch\nbut growing up i had a pretty strict\nupbringing i guess\nlike my parents were open-minded about\nsome things but for the most part they\nhad a very specific ideas\nabout how we should be raised and like\nwhat we need to do in life um and how\num i guess uh\nwhat else we need to do to be happy and\nstay sort of\nuh very controlling in my opinion\nand what did they think you needed to do\nin life\nyou know the normal stuff you\ngraduate school then you go to college\nyou graduate college and of course you\nhave to have very good grades everywhere\nand you have to be on your best behavior\neverywhere\nyou have to make them proud what does\nbest behavior look like\nyou just have to be the best you just\nhave to be the best like there's nothing\nelse\nlike you have to have a ways like this\nthat's it like i just remember school is\nvery\nstressful mainly because of that\nso yeah and then when you graduate\ncollege you need to\num you know you don't have to get a job\njust like go straight into\nmarriage because like you have to have a\nhusband you have to have kids\nand you're gonna feel happy there you\nknow\nbut then the time comes you realize okay\ncheck check check check\ni feel empty and what were the checks\nwhat were the boxes that you had checked\nokay i didn't get the\ni didn't get the kids back i didn't get\na few boxes\nbut um i think it's really good that i\ndidn't have kids so i think you have to\nbe mentally very\nhealthy and financially also ready to\nraise somebody else because if you have\nissues like your kid's just gonna copy\nyou and that's\nto be bad news bears so yeah um\nso it sounds like you did well\nacademically\nyes i did and did you\nyeah sorry go ahead but even that like\ndidn't bring\nmuch satisfaction to my life\ni don't know i had some good jobs as\nwell um\njust just nothing really it just all\nfelt very\noff and i couldn't understand like why\nand like lately when i started realizing\nlike analyzing things i was like hey\nmaybe like that over controlling\nbehavior from my parents just kind of\nresulted in me\nmaking one choices for myself in terms\nof like that's not what i wanted that's\nwhy i don't feel happy that's what they\nwanted for me\nsure so what do you want\nlike evelyn\ni mean so so here's what i'm hearing\nmira\nyou told us what you've you've given us\na nice picture of what your parents\nwanted for you and you're telling me\nthat you kind of did what they wanted\nbasically right for the most part\nfor the most part yes and as you sort of\nlived the life\nthey had wanted for you you\nnoticed yourself feeling not happy as\nyou should have been\nand also maybe a little bit numb and\nfeeling a little bit\nempty\nand so then the question becomes okay if\nthat's if that's what they wanted\nand we're thinking about like i'm\nassuming that numbness and emptiness is\na problem for you is that\nfair\ni mean\nshould it be a problem other people say\nit should be\nuh yeah some people do believe that it\nis a problem but\nso what can i help you with today\nhow exactly uh can i ask you a question\nabout like your career path\nsure do you remember the moment when you\nrealized like\nyou 100 want to do what you're doing\nright now\nlike you want to study in that area and\nyou want to become who you are\nyes and no so i would say that i had\na hundred percent knowledge of who i\nwanted to be\nand i was a hundred percent confident in\nthat and i turned out to be wrong\nand then i kind of figured something out\nand i sort of settled\nfor second best and then at another\npoint i sort of figured out a hundred\npercent of who i wanted to be\nand then i turned out to be wrong\nand now i have a sense of a hundred\npercent of who i want to be for the\nthird time in my life\nand so far it seems to be going well and\neach of those things when i knew what i\nwanted to be i think i gained a lot from\nit it's not like there was\nfailure right so\ni think that you know there's this idea\nthat you have this revelation\nand then you figure out what your true\npath is in life but\nin my experience it's a series of\nrevelations\nthat are kind of wrong and each of those\nbrings you one step\ncloser to like what you should be doing\ndo you feel like what you doing right\nnow in life\nmight be your life's purpose in terms of\nyour\njob in terms of occupation i think it's\nmy life's purpose now\nbut what life has taught me is that your\npurpose in life changes over time\nright has it always been your occupation\nlike your main focus of your life\nno so i view occupation is a vehicle\nto accomplish what you want\nright so like i'm a medical doctor but\nlike i don't have to be\nso what i'm doing today doesn't have\nmuch to do with being a medical doctor\nright like\nso so medical doctor is a part of my\ntraining but what i'm really trying to\ndo is\nhelp gamers and i teach them lots of\nthings that are completely outside of\nmedicine\nso medical doctor like my occupation\nserves my goal\nit isn't my goal and this i think is\nexactly what maybe like your parents\ntried to\nemphasize for you is that they felt like\na particular occupation\nor a particular part a particular piece\nof your life\nis the goal for me it's not the goal\nit's just a means\nyou play video games oh yeah i've been\ndoing since i was a kid\nuh well now that i don't have my\ncomputer i just been playing lots of\nhearthstone\nit's like a strategy card game so\ni'm a boomer but not that much of a\nboomer\nso so when we think about like you know\nlike\nwhen you're playing hearthstone you can\nkind of think about like you have a\nclass right\nand your class is kind of like your\noccupation but the goal of the game\nis like independent of what class you're\nplaying the goal of the game is to win\nand the class just simply gives you a\ncertain set of tools to accomplish your\ngoal\nand i think the purpose is not to be a\nmage\nthe purpose is to win the game and if\nyou are a mage\nthen you need to be using like ice block\nand blizzard\nright does that make sense so i don't\nthink that my occupation\nis my goal it's just i'm trying to help\npeople in the way in which i'm helping\npeople is like\nhas to do with like my particular class\nit's almost like one of the you know the\ntavern brawls\nwhere you get like two classes you know\nso like\nwhat i am is like a mixture of two\nthings like it's part monk and part\ndoctor\nand i combine both of those to like have\na set of\ncards that then i use to help people but\nthe goal is really to help people but\nyou don't have to do what i do does that\nmake sense\nlike i don't think yeah absolutely yeah\ni actually love when you make those\ncomparisons of like\nour lives and video games like i've\nnoticed you do it often on streams it\njust\nhelps people relate a lot better so yeah\ni think there's deep deep wisdom within\nvideo games\nagreed so if video games would try to\nwin\nwhat do you think winning would relate\nto in real life\nuh\nyeah so i mean for me or for other\npeople for you\ni would like to hear your opinion i\nvalue sure\nso for me it's like i see people\nsuffering and that matters to me\nso what i determine like what winning\nlooks like comes from an internal sense\nlike i see a lot of people you know i\nget messages and stuff\nand and i really am sorry that we didn't\nget back to you when you reached out to\nus but we just\nget like literally thousands of people\nreaching out to us and each of those\nmessages i don't have time to read them\nall but like i try to read as many\nas i can i actually try to respond to as\nmany as i can and i have a choice\nbetween\nresponding to all the messages that that\ni get or having a job and twitch\nstreaming and being with my kids\nand and every time i get one of those\nmessages and i read it i see that\nsomeone is like suffering and lost\nand i feel like i should help them so\nthat's what winning looks like to me\nit's like helping all these random\npeople who are like messaging me\nand in a sense it's also helping the\nperson that i used to be\nlike i remember what i used to feel like\nand i remember feeling directionless\nand i remember so i have parents that\nare somewhat like yours i mean\ni'm the son of two physicians who are\nhighly highly\nmotivated and emphasized education and\ngrades\nand you know my dad when i was growing\nup told i have an older brother so he\nsaid one of y'all is going to be a\ndoctor and one of y'all is going to be a\nlawyer\nand those were our options and\nand so sound familiar yeah\num so you know i i grew up and sort of\nalso recognized that like i didn't value\nthe things that\nmy family members valued like i didn't\ncare about being a doctor like i did it\nbecause of ego and i did it because\nwhen i was 15 and people asked me at\nlike a party\nlike you know my parents friends would\nask me what do you want to be when you\ngrow up and i would say doctor everyone\nwould get impressed\nand they would like it was like i had\naccomplished something like they would\ngive me praise\nfor stating something that i wanted to\nbe 15 years from now\nand that's a really bizarre\nreinforcement for a 15 year old\nyou know yeah even now i notice it with\nmy kids like when when my four-year-old\nsays yeah i want to be a doctor when i\ngrow up everyone's like so impressed\nand it's like\nso i i mean that's what drives me is\nlike helping\npeople and it it i think about the\nperson that i used to be\nlike when i grew up with my parents and\nyou know they did the best that they\ncould like i think yeah\nthat was the formula that worked for\nthem my dad grew up in a\nin basically like a 10-foot room where\nlike eight people lived\nand at night time they would have to\nlike literally sleep outside because\nthere wasn't enough room\nfor like everyone just like you can't\nsleep eight people in the 10-foot room\n10 by 10 room um so that's kind of what\ni think about the person that i had i\nhad been when i was lost and\ndirectionless and hopeless\nand didn't understand myself for life\nand i try to help that person\nbecause that's what all oh you know\nthat's what the people are\nwho reach out to me and that's what\nmakes you happy the most\nthat's what makes me happy the most\nthat's what gives you that purpose in\nlife gives me purpose\nbut what makes me the happy mo the most\nis probably gaming\nand doing fun stuff and like watching tv\nlike i get a\nan immense amount of well pleasure\npleasure yeah i feel like pleasure and\nlike feeling\nhappy is not really the same though not\nfor me at least\nhow are they different\nlike when you were describing those two\nuh just from your\nexample if i had to choose like which\none would make me happy\nplaying video games or like\ndoing something useful feeling my\nself-worth even if it's\nin terms of uh you know for selfish\nreasons but like i know i helped someone\ni would choose the second one like the\nsecond one actually would make me feel\nhappy first one it's like little fixes\nof\ndopamine or something it's just it's\nnowhere close\nhave you felt that have you felt that\nway before where you feel like you have\nmeaning and worth\nuh actually yes i felt\nreally good recently\ni felt really emotional about it too\nwhich doesn't happen to me often\nso um and it had to do\nwith uh my decision to go back to school\num you actually inspired me\na lot to do that too um sorry about that\nwhat do you mean sorry about that i\nyou have no idea like how good i felt\nafter i like\nfigure out that puzzle because i was\ntrying to put like pieces together for a\nreally long time\nbut um i think i finally realized that\num there's\none thing i truly enjoy doing in life\nand i have some sort of\nskill for that i haven't even been\nnoticing so much\nor at all actually just because i was\nlike\nso carried away about what others want\nof me or like what others think or\nall of that so\ncan you hold yes one second sorry\nhello\nyes give me a second sorry\noh\nlet me see if this is better okay there\nwe go\nsorry mira apparently my mic was too\nquiet\ncan you keep going uh yeah\nso you were saying that that you decided\nto start education\nuh yeah i decided to go back to school\num\nso i got\naccepted for my master's degree\ncongratulations yeah of psychology and\nneuroscience actually\noh very cool what uh\nwhat um hold on let me just make sure\nthat this audio stuff is okay is this\nokay\ni need to do it testing testing\nthere okay um\nso you decided to get a degree in\npsychology and neuroscience\ncongratulations thank you\nso i felt really strong about that one\nand\nyeah but i still don't feel a whole lot\nbesides for that so it makes me think\nlike\nis that because my body is trying to\npull me in direction of like\nmy career and just kind of showing me\nthat this is what you should be doing\nthis is what you should be focusing on\nwhy do you think it's your body showing\nyou something\nwell recently i found out that most of\nthe emotions that we experience in it\nthey all just kind of come in from our\nbody and we have to live them through\nour bodies\nso i'm trying to listen a little bit\nmore you know\npeople call it the inner voice sometimes\nright\nso um i'm referring to my body as like\nmy inner voice\num and uh\ni lost my type of thought okay let me\njust think for a second okay\nwhat did you feel when you decided or\nwhen you got accepted to you said you\nfelt something\nand that's not common for you or that\nyou\ntend to be a little bit numb so what\nwere you feeling about\nwas it when you made the decision or\nwhen you got accepted to the program or\nwhen did you feel something\nuh actually both of them well i did feel\nreally\nemotional when i got accepted because it\nwas like a hard school to get accepted\nto\nso i was like damn you know i can do it\ni obviously felt proud of myself\nbut um even before then\ni think i was just searching i kept\ni kept searching it was so hard i i just\ncouldn't figure out like how\nto listen to myself how to like come up\nwith\ndecisions and opinions like is it my\nopinion\nis that what my mom wants my dad wants\nwhat my viewers want what like the world\nwants for me you know\nit's very hard sometimes to figure that\nout so\nas much as i was trying to get like\ninformation on that like how to learn to\nlisten to yourself and like what you\ntruly want from life\nit just turned out to be so difficult\nfor me and i i couldn't really figure it\nout but\nwith this specific example of me going\nback to school\nit just felt right and i'm not sure if\nit felt right because i kind of set\nmyself up for it\nor it truly is that one thing that is\nsupposed to be happening in my life like\ni'm\nfinally making the right decision\nwhere do you get the idea that there's a\nright decision\nso you're trying to say there's no wrong\ndecision and everything else is just an\nexperience that's going to lead to\nno experience that's not what i'm saying\ni'm asking you where do you get the idea\nthat there is a right decision\nbecause i feel an emotional response\nto something yes to something\nit's a very good answer okay\nis that how you usually figure out if\nyou're making like the right move\nif you're feeling emotional about it\ni think when you feel emotional about\nsomething it\nsignals that that has value to you in\nsome way\nbut i think a lot of the right decisions\nor something like a right decision that\ni've made come with bad emotions\nnot necessarily good ones\nso how does it make it right decision\nthat's a good point oh because in the\nlong term it brings like actually a\nbetter outcome even though it\nsort of hurts in the moment is that what\nyou're saying\nyeah sort of i mean i i think like for\nexample if i think about grief\nright so if i have to let go of\nsomething that i care about\num that can come with negative emotions\nbut\nit can be the right thing to do so if we\nthink about like let's say you're in a\nromantic relationship which is just not\ngonna work out\nor becomes difficult for any number of\nreasons and doesn't feel like the right\nthing to do\neven though you love that person and you\nreally enjoy spending time with them\nbut there could be like something that's\nmore important than that relationship\nand so you have to give something up and\nthat can hurt\nbut it can still be the right thing to\ndo but how do you\nknow that that's the right thing to do\nhow do you know you're not supposed to\nkeep fighting\nfor whatever relationship you have there\nhowever bad it is\nthat's a great question so mira i'm\ngoing to answer that in a second the\nfirst thing\ni want to point out is that so usually\nwhen people come on stream i tend to ask\nmore questions and give fewer answers\nand you seem to have a lot of questions\nwhich is perfectly fine\ndo you think that the most helpful thing\nright now is for you to ask\nquestions and for me to answer them is\nthat helpful to you\nyes do you agree with me\nuh i think there are some upsides and\nsome downsides\ncan we split a 50-50 sure\nwe don't have to can i share with you\nwhat i think the good things are about\nthat\nand what the bad things are could be\nabout that\nthe first is that you know when i ask\nyou where do you get the idea that\nthere's a\nright answer um\ni was actually thinking a little bit\nabout like you know you were raised to\nbelieve that there is like a formula for\nsuccess\nright and and really what you what it\nseems like you've done is you've\nreplaced\ntheir formula with success with the idea\nthat you have a formula for success and\nit just needs to be your formula for\nsuccess\ndoes that make sense like there's still\na path\nthere's a set of check boxes that if i\ndo all of these things i'm going to feel\nhappy\nthe only difference is that before those\ncheck boxes were your parents check\nboxes and now you're trying to figure\nout\nwhat are your check boxes with me\nare you saying we should raise the check\nboxes\ni'm wondering whether that's a\nworthwhile proposition\nright so you're doing something which is\nvery cool which is you're\nwhen i say something you're going\nthrough a set you're very smart\nyou're going through a set of reasoning\nyou're predicting where i'm leading you\nand then you're asking me whether the\nconclusion is correct\ndo you see that like you're like when i\nask you a question you're saying\nare you saying like you're going you're\nyou're jumping ahead to the end of the\nroad and you're basically saying is this\nwhat you're suggesting it's very\nintelligent\na lot of do you think it's a waste of\nenergy to what\ndo you think what i'm doing there is a\nwaste of energy should just kind of\nlet it more become no i don't think it's\na waste of energy i think it tells us a\nlittle bit about\nhow you perceive problems in the world\nand i i don't think it's a waste of\nenergy i think that you could be missing\nsomething\nalong the way right because you're\ndrawing conclusions from my questions so\ni ask you a question\nand then your response if you just\nliterally listen to what your response\nis i'll ask you a question\nwhere do you get the idea that there's a\nformula for success\nand then your response is not where you\nget that idea your first response is\nare you saying dot dot dot so you're not\nactually\nanswering a question about yourself\nyou're trying to figure out what i think\nyeah because i have just value yeah\nmaybe i should just go back to watching\nyour streams\nyeah because i just want to know what\nyou think i just kind of want to listen\nto you\nmore right so let's just think about\nthis for a second right like your\nproblem is that you don't know what you\nwant\nand your default answer is to listen to\nme more\nbecause i think you have a better idea\nof what those check boxes are\nand etc etc yes right but like maybe\nwhat you should do to figure out what\nyou want is instead of looking from\nfor the answer from me look for the\nanswer\nfrom you so how does one do that\neffectively yeah great question\nso it starts by recognizing that like\nyou're looking for answers fundamentally\nbecause this is the way you've been\ntrained\nso like literally the reason i ask you\nthe question where do you get the idea\nthat there is\na formula for success it's because like\neverywhere around you like even though\nyou've figured out and this is huge for\nyou by the way i think it's awesome that\nyou figured this out\nthat your formula for success is not\nyour parents formula for success\nthe next step is for you to figure out\nis there a formula for success\nand for a little while i was wondering\nlike why are you asking me the questions\nthat you're asking me\nright like you're it's kind of\ninteresting because\nand and so when when you ask me did you\nhave a moment\nwhere you know what you're supposed to\nbe in the rest of your life\nand that presumes that such moments\nexist\nand that you find yourself and then\nyou're you're set for life\nright like does that make sense you're\nkind of assuming that i had such a\nmoment\nand my answer was actually yeah i've had\nseveral of those moments and i turned\nout to be wrong through several\nseveral of them so it's been my\nexperience that there isn't\na formula for success and that thinking\nin and of itself\nis the thing that's holding you back\nthat you think that there is a answer\nbut here's the thing i think it's\nwonderful that you're going to\nget a degree in psychology and\nneuroscience you're clearly very\ncerebral\nand very intelligent and very capable\nand i think that you're gonna be\nunsatisfied after this\nwhy because that's not where happiness\ncomes from\nwhere does happiness come from where do\nyou think it comes from\nokay we're going 50 50 it's your turn to\nanswer\noh what makes it hard for you to answer\nthat question\nwell i don't think i have a very clear\nidea\ni mean obviously it's gonna be\nsubjective yeah\ngood so like like now we have to think a\nlittle bit about this okay so now mira\ni'm gonna ask you a question i'll\nanswer whatever questions you want okay\nbut i just want to make this point\nso if you don't have a clear idea where\ndoes\nthat clarity come from does it come from\nyou or does it come from me\nlet's just start there\nit should be coming from me\nbut we're here right now\nand i'm talking to you with a clear\nintention of gaining knowledge\nso i would like to hear your point of\nview first and hopefully they'll help me\nunderstand myself a little better\nyeah so i'm fine with that if that's\nreally what you want to do but like\nlet's just think about that for a second\nright like\nsure you can learn from me\nand hope to understand yourself a little\nbit better that's absolutely a really\nimportant\nsource of knowledge because we like the\nwhole reason that the aoe healing works\nis because other people like the whole\nidea behind healthy gamer is exactly\nwhat you just said\nthat i can have a conversation with one\nperson and that a thousand people\nwatching at home\ncan learn something that has nothing to\ndo with an internal exploration\nthey can see it in another person and\nthey can learn from it\nright that's what we're here about now i\nget that you've watched our streams and\nthat you've gained a lot from it and i\ni'm really\ni'm really glad that that's happened i'm\nhappy for you and i'm also happy for\nmyself\nthat's why we do it and today of all\ndays mira you have a different\nopportunity\nyou can watch me answer questions for\nother people\nas much as you want to but today you\nhave a very unique opportunity\nto explore yourself with my help\nand if that feels difficult for you\nlike i get the sense that you're really\nresistant to doing that and i'm trying\nto understand\nwhy and i think it may have something to\ndo with\nyou being afraid that you don't know\nanswers and it's hard for you to be\nignorant in public\nthat would be my hypothesis but i'd have\nto talk to you about it more\njust when i think about children of high\nfunctioning parents who are expected to\nget all a's\nnot having the answer on stream is\nprobably going to be hard for you what\ndo you think\nokay um\nokay i hear you so um\nwould you like me to answer the question\nabout what happiness\nis for me first\nlet me think about that\nso you said earlier that pleasure and\nhappiness are different right\nyes so help me understand how you\ndiscovered that\nwe're talking about pleasure um\ni can think about video games\nsex just\nlittle things like that it's it's\nsomething that\nis more physical\nand short term for me\nand happiness it's more of a\nmental\nlong-term state okay so are you happy\ni'm happier than i was before yes um but\ni don't think it's my final form\nhmm so have you been happy before\nnot in my final form no it's just\nwhat does that mean final form\ni think i have an idea of what\ni want in the future like how i feel in\nthe future\nand that's what i mean by the final form\nso how do you even know that exists\nbecause i made it up right\nso but that's the thing right so like\nthere's a part of me that wonders a\nlittle bit so i i do think that you can\nfeel happier and more fulfilled than\nthan you do right now if you say that\nyou don't feel happy and fulfilled\ni i think the challenge is that\nyou're chasing something from your\nimagination\nand in doing so you may miss out\non sources of happiness that\nbecause you're looking for something\nright\nlike if you think about are you do you\nmind if i ask you a couple of questions\nabout relationships\nyeah go ahead are you in a relationship\nright now\nyes and\nis that when you think about a good what\nare you happy with your relationship\ni'm uh definitely happier than i have\never been in a relationship before\nyes okay so when we think about like\nwhat you imagine a good relationship\nlike looks like\nand what your current relationship looks\nlike before your current relationship\nwhen you envision what a good\nrelationship is\nhow similar is what you're doing now to\nwhat you envisioned\noh i missed the first part uh before my\ncurrent relationship\nyeah before you started your current\nrelationship when you looked into the\nfuture and you said this is the kind of\nrelationship that i want\nyou created a fantasy or an ideal of\nwhat a relationship should be\nhow similar is that ideal to what you're\nliving now\nooh really really close but not 100\nwhich is why i'm i'm i'm having doubts\nabout it it's like should we really\nsettle if it's not 100\neven if it's 99 you know\nis it is it really the one how do you\nknow\nif it's not 100\nare you just wasting time are you just\nsettling\nwhat do you think\nah i googled this so many times\ngoogle didn't help yeah\n[Music]\nwell google thinks if you have any um\ndoubts at all like you probably\nshouldn't even be in that\nthat's what google thinks what do you\nthink\ni mean i'm just being really grateful\nto what the present is compared to the\npast\nbut then again maybe i'm just settling\ndown\nbecause i\nwhat do you think about settling are you\nokay with settling\nit depends if the worst thing is going\nto come yes\nbut what if there's something better\nplease\nokay so sorry for making you\nuncomfortable we don't have to talk\nabout that more but i i think it's\ni think the feelings that you're having\nare very common in relationships right\nlike most people in relationships\nthink about whether this is the right\nlike until you're married and even after\nyou're married many people are you\nmarried\nokay um so you know\ni think it's completely normal and\nhealthy to think about what else is out\nthere\nbecause until you have those thoughts\nlike you can't settle down with someone\nin a completely authentic way does that\nmake sense\nlike if i'm did you go through that too\nno so you always knew that your wife\nis the one like that's it that's\nsomebody i want to live the rest of my\nlife\nsettle in i feel happy even if you have\nsome moments like\nthat's it did i know that she was the\none\nsort of but it was also\nfar from perfect from day one\nokay right so my point was that when i\nthink about my ideal relationship\nit was very different from what i\nthought a relationship looked like\nso you say that your current\nrelationship is pretty close to your\nideal\nmy ideal was very different\nand one of the things now i'll answer\nso one of the things that i've come to\nappreciate is that there isn't a formula\nfor success\nand perfection is an idea and that\ni got a lot of happiness from letting go\nof perfection\nfrom letting you do that of looking for\n100\nbut how did you get rid of that idea of\nlike\nwhat if this is not my thing and i'm\njust well it's the idea that\nso it's the idea that something is your\nthing or\nisn't your thing that presumes that\nthere's an objective truth to what's\nyour thing and what isn't your thing\nno there's not huh right and this comes\nback to like where did you get the idea\nthat there's a formula for success it's\nbecause\ni think deep within you you have this\nidea that things are done right\nor they're done wrong there is a right\nand there is a wrong there is a right\nway to be at school there's a right way\nto behave\nwhen your parents friends come over\nthere's a right way to answer questions\nthere's a right way to look\nthere's a right way to present yourself\nand twitch reinforces that\nright right that there's a right way and\nthere's a wrong way\nand the thing is mira you're not right\nor wrong you're you\nand they're going to be parts of you if\nyou measure yourself against the scale\nof right and wrong\nyou're not you're never going to be\nright\nlike you can't be completely right\nyou're just you you're flawed\nany relationship that you engage in is\ngoing to be flawed\nokay okay okay that makes sense but\nstill there's got to be some sort of\nsigns that you derive probably from\nwithin yourself\nto figure out if this person is your\nperson\nand not your person if this is what i\nwant to do in life like\njob-wise or not so how do i get like\nvery sensitive to those feels like how\ndo i get to listen to myself better\nyeah so i think that you are listening\nto yourself better i think you just need\nto listen\nfor different things i think you're good\nat listening to yourself i think the\nissue is when you say is this what i'm\nsupposed to do\nin life you can't know\nand no sense of yourself is going to\ntell you what you're supposed to do\nin life in a sense oddly enough what i\nwould encourage you to do is like what\nare\nwhat is something telling you in the\nmoment\nand then reflecting on that so like is\nis getting a master's degree in\npsychology and neuroscience supposed to\nbe what you do\nin life i'm not sure but i think it's a\nwonderful thing for you to do now\nand that was my whole point betw behind\nmy earlier answers like i thought at the\nage of 21 that i wanted to become a monk\nand it felt so right for and me\nturned out to be like absolutely wrong\noh that was one of the things that you\nsaid you accomplished and then you\nrealized it was wrong yeah i decided at\nthe age of 21 i wanted to become a monk\ntwo weeks after i tried to like give up\nmy life and my teachers wouldn't quite\ntake me yet\ni met the person who was gonna be my\nwife and i was like i'm gonna be\ncelibate\nno more women i'm finished and then i\nmet her\nand then i was really confused because\nyou were kind of saying did i know she\nwas the one like\nit was weird it was confusing because i\ndidn't think there was gonna be a one\ndoes that make sense i let go of the\nidea of success\ni let go of the idea of a formula\nthat was going to be right for me i was\nso\nwrong and it felt so right it felt so\ngood\nit felt so wonderful that i was going to\nbe this spiritually enlightened master\none day\nand then i meet this girl and wow she is\nkind of hot\nno but no no no that's not for me that's\nnot who i am\nthat's for regular people\nand she was attractive\nand i just enjoyed being with her like\nour first date\ni didn't even realize it was a date like\ni was like yeah i'll like i'll take you\nto lunch like i'll i\nlike if you like thai food like there's\na really great restaurant so we like\nwent to lunch\nand then 11 hours later i dropped her\noff and we just hung out the whole day\nand like there i was in my head feeling\nlike this is wrong\nlike not wrong but i was like oh yeah\nthis is not anything like i had feelings\nin here\nthat i was actively ignoring because i\nwas doing the right thing like the right\nthing was to be a monk\nso i'm not going to have a relationship\nwith this girl\nand so you never had you never had like\nany big doubts about\nher you never i had thousands of doubts\nthat's exactly what i'm saying\nbut like not about your relationship\nwith her her\nyou were sure about her you just not\nwe're not sure how she was fitting into\nwhatever idea of your life you had at\nthe moment no the whole problem was that\nshe wasn't fitting into my idea of my\nlife\nright yeah but you still felt like she\nis right for you\nyeah i don't understand what i feel that\nnow i don't know that i felt that then\nright so i didn't understand what i felt\nthat\nand i still don't really know exactly\nwhat it was looking back on it it makes\nsense hindsight is 20 20.\nbut in the moment like this is why i'm\npressing you to like look within\nyourself because in the moment like it's\na [ __ ] mess\nand the other like the whole problem is\nyou're thinking like how do i look\nwithin myself and find the right answer\nmy point is that i don't think there's a\nright answer\nthere's only like the best answer you\ncan make today\nso there's no like technique or trick\nyou can do\nto like feel out your inner voice better\nthere are things you can do to hear out\nyour inner voice but i think like you're\nstill\nattached to this idea that there is a\nright answer out there\nand there's a secret formula to uncover\nwhat the right answer is\nand oddly enough you're not wrong there\nbut i think what you really need to do\nis move away from the idea that you can\nget to a perfect answer\ncan absolutely do things to better and\nif you want to learn a particular\npractice\ni will teach you a practice to enhance\nthe strength of your inner voice and\npeople think i'm a good psychiatrist but\ni've said this several times\ni'm not a i mean i'm a good psychiatrist\nbut what makes me exceptional is not\nthat i'm a good psychiatrist\nwhat makes me exceptional is that i do\npractices literally\nthe bulk of my spiritual practice is\nabout cultivating my inner voice\nand that's what allows me to connect\nwith people because like i have data\nthat like other people don't have\nand i think that that's through my\nmeditative practice so there's\nabsolutely things you can do that\nthat you can do and i'm happy to teach\nyou that but i want you to be careful\nbecause it still presumes that there is\na right answer\nlike mira i think if you want to be\nhappy in life you need to start\nmaking bad decisions\nyou\n[Music]\ni think what you need to start doing is\nmaking imperfect decisions\ninstead of looking for the right answer\nstart accepting\nthat like you can do the best thing you\ncan do today and it may or may not work\nout\nand that over time if you do the best\nthing for you\ntoday tomorrow and the next day some of\nthose are not going to work out some of\nthem will work out and\nover time hopefully you'll find yourself\nin a situation\nwhere you're happy but that happiness is\nnot something that can be chased it's\nsomething that's found\nright\nhave you always been in tune with your\ninner voice\nor is it something you came to no\nyeah i mean i did years and years of\nmeditative practice i was\ndeaf to my inner voice for most of my\nlife why were you deaf\nbecause i was like a normal gamer\nlike i played video games all day and\nhad no idea what i felt or how i felt\nthat way and all i know\nis that every every night when i went to\nbed if i wasn't absolutely exhausted\ntons of emotions would come rushing up\nthat i hated\ni got pissed off every single time my\nparents asked me how did your classes go\ntoday\nit pissed me off so much the worst part\nof my day would be like how did my\nclasses go because they didn't go well\nand then i'd lie to them and i'd say\neverything's fine\nand i knew it was a [ __ ] lie and i\nknew everything wasn't fine\nand there was a part of me that was\ntelling me hey man you're kind of\n[ __ ] up here\nand then what i did with that inner\nvoice was stuff it way down by playing\ndiablo 2 and warcraft 3.\nand wow and all kinds of other stuff\nyou've been there done that so basically\nit's by meditating\nand just working on yourself you've got\ninto practice\nthat sensitivity within yourself\nsure that's the way to get sensitivity\nsure\nokay like there are particular practices\nwhich i believe\nyou know i believe that different\nmeditation techniques affect\ndifferent functions of the brain in\ndifferent ways there's some evidence to\nthis\ni think there's some stuff on our\ndiscord we've uploaded some papers and\nstuff\nso they they've done like eeg studies\nyou know what eg eeg is\nokay so eeg is measures the electrical\nactivity of different parts of your\nbrain\nand they've done studies on different\nmeditation techniques that show\nthat different meditation techniques\ncreate different\npatterns of electrical activity in your\nbrain and the electrical activity in\nyour brain\nis a reflection of which parts of your\nbrain are quote-unquote\nturned off and which parts are turned on\nso\ndifferent meditations activate different\nparts of the brain is kind of like a\nsimplistic\nand frankly incorrect way of looking at\nit but that's not really incorrect\nit's just a simplistic way so if i were\nto go on your discord\ni can get more information about like\nwhat meditation i can do\nto help no you can get you can get\nscientific papers\nabout the science behind whether\nmeditation techniques affect different\nparts of the brain differently\nbut if you want to know what meditation\ntechniques to do i'm going to teach you\nbecause i know what you need to do so\nyou can start with\none or two practices and then we can go\nfrom there i'm happy to continue to\nteach you like from time to time\nthank you\nthis helping at all yeah it is okay\nwhat are you hearing from me mira um\nfirst i was a little confused\nbut yeah but i think it's because\ni had my own idea of like what you think\ni will\nwhat i thought you would say but you\ndidn't give me a specific\nanswer you kind of just marked my the\nanswers that i was expecting out\nand so i was confused but now i'm just\ntrying to like\ni'm really uh so that meditation that\nyou just mentioned\nis it something that we can do in stream\nand then i can practice upstream as well\nabsolutely okay and i don't need to do\nwith someone else i can just do it by\nmyself\nnope yeah you can do it by yourself okay\nso can you help me understand a little\nbit about what you're taking away from\nthis\num\n[Music]\nthere's no formula\ni need to stop oh\nlet's not say need maybe i shouldn't\nfocus\nas much on specific steps i need to make\ni said need again why that's okay you\nlike the word\nit's okay for some reason i don't like\nthe word need they put\npressure on me it puts pressure on me\nand i don't like that\nanyways um but that's how you feel right\nyeah i feel like i need i need i\ni need like that get that very strongly\nso the vibe that i got from you that i\njust need to chill\nthe [ __ ] out and just kind of let things\ngo and let things\nbe which i thought i did last year\nit was very what was i\ni thought i was not doing anything i was\njust like traveling and\nenjoying life but so let's talk about\nthat for a second i\ni think that you should live a life of\nintentionality so i don't think that you\nshould chase pleasure\nand just chill the [ __ ] out what i'm\nsaying is that you have this\ni get the sense mira that within you you\nhave\nlike there's like a mirror inside you\nwith a whip\nand she's just whipping you forward with\na whip and she's just whipping you\nforward\nshe's like you need to grow and you need\nto find yourself and you need to find\nthe right technique and you need to\ncultivate your inner voice\nand it's all like clouded by like this\nvery positive like language\nlike inner voice and discovering\nyourself but at the end of the day like\nyou're whipping yourself forward you're\npressuring yourself to find the answer\nthe right answer find an answer what's\nthe right formula for success what\nwhat are the check boxes that you need\nto check and it's a huge step forward to\nstep away from your parents checkboxes\nbut there's still the idea that there\nare check boxes\nand you're trying to live a perfect life\nyou're trying to have perfection in your\nrelationship you're saying it's like 99\nof what you want but\nit may not be perfect like that's a\nproblem\nright that you're you're looking for\nperfection\nbut without the whip would there be any\nmovement\nexcellent question absolutely but this\nis the hard thing for\nfor people like you and by people like\nyou i mean\npeople who have achieved this is the\nmost difficult thing that i\nwhen i work with people who are high\nachievers\nthe whip is what gets them to where they\nare\nand so the question is how can you care\nabout something without the whip\nthat make sense\nso you're saying the energy can still\ncome within you\nwithout you pushing like forcing\nyourself to do things\nabsolutely\nright and so so this is the thing the\nreason that you don't\nknow what you want is because you're not\naware of that thing\nlike that's exactly what we're talking\nabout this entire time is that there is\na force within you\nthat can propel you forward without\nwhipping you\nit's something that you gravitate\ntowards it's what feels right\nit's what makes you happy it's your\ninternal compass it's your internal\nvoice\nbut you have lived a life where you have\nwhipped yourself towards a particular\nexternal goal that you have lost sight\nof like what your internal\ncompasses and even the way that you\nfind your internal compass is still\nwhipping\ndo you see that like you're asking me\nfor the perfect technique to find your\ninternal compass\nthat in and of itself is an external\ngoal that you have an idealized answer\nfor\nyou see that does that make sense yes it\ndoes\nright like that yeah how does one get\nrid of the whip\nyou tell me\nwell realizing it is already a step\nforward right\nknowing that there is one and that\ndoesn't\nmaybe it's just not optimal for me it's\nnot the best way to go around it\nbecause you know how they say that there\nare different ways to get people to do\nthings and\nlike if you if you choose the stressful\none through like fear intimidation\nmanipulation whatever it's not as\neffective as\nopposed to when you inspire them or like\nall of your answers are coming from the\noutside\nmira they're coming you're smart so\nyou've read a lot of things and you're\nquoting a lot of theory it's very very\nintellectual\nit's not that right right it's not wrong\nbut it's incomplete it's all coming from\nup here\nand when i ask you questions like what\ndo you want like it's really hard for\nyou to answer that\nand this is like where the numbness\ncomes from like the numbness is because\nlike you don't know what's going on in\nhere\nright so i think oddly enough like the\nway that you need to answer that\nquestion is to look for yourself\nlike don't look for i mean i'm going to\nteach you a technique because i think\nyou\nhave a very good temperament for this\nand i think it'll help you a lot but at\nthe same time start to recognize that\nlike\nthe way that you need to find that\nanswer is by trying things and [ __ ]\nup for a few times\nright and and when i ask you have you\nbeen happy before and you say no i don't\nbelieve that\ni think you've been happy basically\nyou said you haven't had your final form\nof happiness which implies that like\nyou're saying like yeah it's kind of\nlike asking have you ever been\num have you ever had like a great horse\nride\nand then you say yeah i've had like some\npretty good like horseback riding\nsessions but i've never ridden a unicorn\nbefore\nthat would be nice to ride a unicorn\nabsolutely it would be nice to write\na unicorn but what i'm saying is that\nlike you're looking for\nanswers from happiness from the outside\nbut like\nthere is no doubt in my mind that there\nhave been moments of time where you've\nbeen like purely happy\nand what you need to look for in terms\nof like where to go is like go back and\nlook at those times\nand i wouldn't be surprised if they're\n[ __ ] confusing because they may not\nbe what you thought they would look like\nand we're not talking about playing\nhearthstone or sex or other dopaminergic\npleasurable things\nwe're talking about a moment of pure\nsurprise\njoy and happiness where you stopped\nthinking about expectations\nand you felt present and you loved being\nwhere you were for a moment\nis that weird that normally i only by\nmyself\nno not at all\nbut see that's an important revelation\nlike i think it's telling that your\nquestion was is it weird\nright that's telling me that like what\nyou're discovering\nis running a little bit contrary to what\nyou believe\nbecause otherwise you would have said\nyeah it was mostly when it's by myself\nyou said is it weird you're asking for\nconfirmation because it seems a little\nbit confusing\nwhich is exactly where you need to go\nso tell me about that\ndon't come up with the right answer just\ngive me the answer that you've got\nyes don't [ __ ] pull that [ __ ] with me\ngive me the imperfect answer\nwhat were you thinking about when you\nsaid it was is it weird that it was by\nmyself\num i mean society does tend to judge\nthat\nbut i i truly feel\ni feel like my happiest moments were\njust\nwith myself like when you started like\nmentioning oh it's not true that you\ndidn't feel happy i was like\nthis i started just kind of like going\nthrough that briefly and\nmost of them are by myself and can you\ncan you give me\nan actual example yeah like what\num like\nwhen i go to forest\nwell there were a few like really\nintense ones but basically most of them\nwere just\nin the nature and without anyone around\npeople just i don't i don't\nlike people very much i don't like being\naround people very much\nuh and it's pr it's probably me um my\nbad like communicated\ncommunication skills and stuff but\nyeah maybe me trying to\nso so many questions i haven't had\nlike so many things i just want to ask\nyou it's weird right you're asking me a\nquestion but\ninstead i would just want to say this\nthis is your opinion\nit's like well me trying to become\na psychologist will that get in the way\nthe fact that i don't really\nlike being around people but at the same\ntime i feel so fulfilled when i can talk\nto someone and like\nhelp one way or another uh that's just\nlike a random thought that just was\nthere\ngood now you're making progress what\nwhat else do you have\ni don't know if i should say it while\nwe're streaming\nokay i i don't i don't know people tend\nto get really weird on\ntwitch about stuff\ni i have ptsd a little bit from twitch\nokay\nit's been a while okay\ni don't know whether you should or\nshouldn't say it because i know less\nabout twitch than you do and i don't\nknow what's in your head\nbut anyway so maybe move on to the next\nthing\nlike like what other questions do you\n[Music]\nhave\n[Music]\nsorry i'm a little slow so i'm just like\nprocessing some of the things that you\nsaid\nand uh yeah not slow\nmira you're doing it this is what you're\nhere to do\nright this whole time you've had a\nthousand questions for me\nand now i'm asking you what are your\nquestions and\nyou're slow this is what exploration\nlooks like\nthis is what looking within yourself\nlooks like\n[Music]\ni mean if a person let's say the person\njust ends up living the life\njust by finding like\na good job and not necessarily like\nbuild up good relationships or like\nmeaningful relationships in life like\nwithout\ngetting married or having kids that's\ntotally fine too\nright that doesn't have to be yeah but\nthat's me setting up again like a\ncheckbox like okay then\nthis is my plan i'm gonna get yeah no no\nbut i i don't think that's you setting\nup a checkbox if you really listen to\nthat question\nwhat that question is asking is can i be\nhappy if i don't check all the boxes\nthat's the question you need to be\nasking do you see that\nlike that that scenario is actually\nletting go of a few of the boxes it's\nerasing a couple of the boxes\nyeah i mean\ni feel like relationships are overrated\nanyways\nyeah so\nsorry i'm just i'm not i'm not voicing\nit but i just have a bunch of\nthings going on okay good because i\ni still have a filter because uh with\nstreaming and um\ni i understand that we need to stream\nbecause it's\nuseful when people listen to our\nconversations and can we learn something\nelse but like i have to filter myself\nlike\nwhen it comes to what i say okay i feel\nlike i need to\nfine let's just respect that for a\nmoment okay\num and so one or two other\nso one or two thoughts so like you're\nasking a couple of questions which i\nthink are\ngood and you're making a couple of\nobservations which i think are good i'm\nhappy to still teach you about how to\nfind your inner voice and all that stuff\nbut i think this is actually the most\nimportant thing that you're doing right\nnow\nso you're noticing that actually when\ni'm happy like it's in the woods\nand also like the idea of being a\npsychologist and working with someone\nfeels very gratifying\nor when i've had very intimate\nconnections with people\nand helped them in a significant way it\nfeels like it gives my life meaning\nall that makes sense so i'm gonna try to\ntoss out one way\nto understand that i think the biggest\nthing about those two things i don't\nthink you need to be in the woods\ni think you need to be free from\nexpectation\nbecause what i'm hearing from you time\nand time and time again\nis that twitch your parents and\nother people in your life have lots and\nlots of expectations with\nfor for you and then you take those\nexpectations and you internalize them\nin the check boxes are you good enough\nare you pretty enough are you smart\nenough\nare you you know sharing enough are you\nnot sharing enough\nand and you're so full of expectation\nfinding your final form of happiness and\nand you know setting all these bars for\nyourself that like you just don't know\nhow to be\nexcept sometimes in your life you are\nput in a particular place where\nexpectation\nhas no it just doesn't compute like when\nyou're with trees like what do they\nexpect of you\nlike there's just no way like nature\ndoesn't give a [ __ ]\nand that's why i think it's wonderful\nespecially for people like you\nso for people who have issues with\nconfidence and self-worth\nwhich i think way deep down i think\nyou've got something going on there\nyou're afraid of the judgment of others\nright and you have good reasons to be\nafraid of the judgment of others it\nsounds like i'm not saying you shouldn't\nbe afraid of that\nbut at the end of the day like nature\ndoesn't give a [ __ ] like if you\nif you decide like i remember when i was\nalso going through my\ngrowth and transformative period you\nknow there was like i remember seeing\nthis\nlike 12 or 14 foot boulder it was just\nbig and i was out\nhiking one day and i said like i'm gonna\nclimb to the top of that whole\nboulder and and i tried to climb into\nthe top and\nwhat do you think happened mira you fell\nno thankfully i didn't fall but i\ncouldn't make it to the top i was just\ntoo out of shape and weak and\nhow do you think i felt about\nhow myself i feel if i couldn't climb a\nboulder i was trying to climb\ni would just keep climbing i would not\ngive up i would figure yeah\nyeah so i did that for a while and then\ni realized that it was physically\nimpossible\ndid you try putting stuff around it to\nclimb\nno i felt like that was cheating like i\nwanted to climb it you know\nyeah yeah how did you try to work out\nafter that to get stronger and stuff\nsort of like for a day or two but then\nthat fizzled\nhow do you think i felt when i when i\nfailed\nhow does failure feel like i\nprobably felt disappointed yeah\nright i felt weak and i was like yeah i\nneed to work out and get into shape and\nthings like that\nand then i remember this really strange\nmoment where i like looked around\nand i looked around because i was like\ndoes everyone realize how\nout of shape i am was anyone watching\nand i was like oh\nlike no one was watching and no one\ngives a [ __ ]\nand that like all of my disappointment\nlike comes from me it doesn't come from\nanywhere else the boulder certainly\ndoesn't give a [ __ ]\nbut what if people were watching how\nwould you feel ah\nso now people watch right\nand so what i learned that day is like\nmost of the things that we beat\nourselves up for\ncome from us ultimately they all come\nfrom us and that you can learn\na way to like literally become\nimpervious to the criticism of others\nand that's what confidence is impervious\nis immune\nice block okay so it's like\ni'm ice blocked like you can't hurt me\nanymore but that's what confidence is\nlike when you when you derive a sense of\nself-worth\nfrom in here people can say whatever the\n[ __ ] they want to\nand it doesn't affect you your eyes\nblocked it's not that you're numb it's\njust that you realize that like\nthey're allowed to have that opinion and\nit's not that they're wrong it's just\ni'm not going to let\ntheir opinions determine my value as a\nhuman being\nbut what if they come what if they take\nthat opinion\neven if it's not based on anything\nfactual\nthey group up they\nmake the group larger and they\nuse that let's call it one opinion just\nbecause it's not based on facts\nand they spread it all over the internet\nand you get that sounds awful\na lot of negativity yes that's when you\nhave to\nwatch what you do and what you say right\nso\nso far i've been lucky enough to not\nhave experienced that\nand i don't know if you know i i've\ndealt with\ncriticism i've dealt with harsh\ncriticism before\ni've dealt with criticism from people\nthat are important to me\nand so far i've maintained my confidence\ni'm not saying i think if twitch tried\nto tear me down or the internet\ntried to tear me down they'd succeed\nbecause they're just that powerful\ni think the big difference though mira i\nreally wonder when you say it's their\nopinion and it's not based on fact i\nwould question that\nbecause one of the biggest sources of my\nconfidence is when someone tells me\nsomething\ni don't assume that they're wrong i\nassume that they're right\nso if i get a criticism and there have\nbeen lots of people who criticized me\nsince i started streaming on twitch\ni start with the premise of like maybe\nthis person knows what they're talking\nabout\nand then i test it and then i see like\nokay are there things about this\ncriticism that are fair and sometimes\nthe internet definitely like bandwagons\nonto things\nbut i think like this is an important\npart of soul searching on your part that\nif like a lot of people think that\nyou're\ndoing something out of line you should\nat least\nbe objective and like look and maybe you\ndid do something out of line\nwhen i get criticisms i don't i don't\nassume that they're wrong i don't assume\nthat i'm an expert it's like\nanyone is entitled to criticize me and\nthey could be right\nbut what if you looked into that you\nreally reflect it and\nand you just\ndon't see what they see whatsoever\nsure so practically what i do is i i try\nto engage people now i think that that\ncan be hard so it's different from a man\nand a woman and it's different with the\ninternet\nright so i think like there are some\nthings that i've come to appreciate that\nare different about gender\nbut generally speaking if i don't\nunderstand someone's criticism\ni will actually make a full faith effort\nto ask\nand then you know say like hey i really\ndon't get this\nright like i don't understand why like\ni'll give you an example so one of\ni'm working with someone who has a\nparent who's upset\nabout my work because their child is\ndoing something that they don't want\nthem to do\nand their child is doing something\nthat's objectively bad and they kind of\nblame me for it\nthey're like since he's seeing you and\nwe're paying you a ton of money like\naren't you supposed to prevent this kind\nof [ __ ] and so then like i kind of\nyou know there's a part of me that says\nlike i don't think you guys understand\nlike i'm not responsible for your\nchild's behavior your child is\nresponsible for your child's behavior\nbut you guys think that you know their\nparents\na lot like yours who think that their\nchild should behave a certain way that\nthere's a right and there's a wrong\nthere's no sense of agency there's just\nlike there's a right and there's a wrong\nand if there's a problem we throw money\nat it and we find the best person out\nthere and he fixes it and the problem\ngoes away like they don't get\nthat like the problem here is that like\nyou guys can't communicate with your\nchild and he doesn't respect you\nbecause you guys don't respect him but\ni'll definitely stop and ask them\nyou know that's what i think and it's\nactually i believe that because\ni talked to them and i was like well\nwhat do you guys think you guys think\nthat i'm i'm\nletting your son down and i'm letting\nyou down so like tell me about in what\nways and am i letting you down\nand they said like this this this and\nlike we thought this would happen and it\nactually turned out that they had a\ncouple of very good criticisms\nyou know i realized like oh actually\nduring covet i haven't been checking up\nwith him because he has been doing\nbetter and it's been a stressful time\nso i can do better at that am i\nresponsible for their son's behavior no\nbut can i do better absolutely\ndoes that make sense yeah\ni'm just trying to apply it to my\nsituation so here\nokay so yeah i like that\nyou brought that part up about any\ncriticism regardless of how\nstupid or not factual i think it is you\ncan still derive something like really\nreflecting that\nbut imagine with that\neven though you're just telling me what\nwe're talking about like do you want to\njust tell me what the internet got\npissed at you about\ni mean there's just so much stuff i it's\nnot even that it's like i\ni pretty much forgot all about it but i\nwant to make sure that in the future i\nhave like a better\nformula to react to stuff which is why\ni'm asking you\nso that's one way of it but you know\nsometimes people are just so\nunhappy like those parents let's say\nthey just had their own issues and they\njust want to\ntake it out on someone they they're\nstruggling with their son\nthey don't want to take responsibility\nthey're very immature themselves\nand they put it on you like why do you\nneed to put up with that and let's say\nthey also\ntalking to everyone around saying how\nbad of a psychiatrist you are\nwhy do you need to put up with that you\ndon't need to put up with that\ndoes it affect you absolutely do i\nignore it\nno i mean so i don't ignore it i try to\naddress their concerns directly and if\nthere's a population that\nmatters i will address it with the\npopulation as well\nso for example like if people complain\nto my boss which has happened before\ni will go to my boss and you know\nthere's a part of that that feels\nhurtful but then i'll go to my boss and\ni'll explain\nmy side of the story and then there are\nalso times where like\nyou know i've been in conflict with\npeople and you don't ignore it but you\nalso like\naddress it directly and then\nyou can walk away like i think now we're\nspeaking so abstractly that i don't know\nif it really makes\nsense but you know so i'll give you just\na very clear example so i had an\nissue with i was about to take a job and\nwe got down to defining what my title\nwas\nand i felt like the title that they were\ngiving me was not\nappropriate for the kind of work that i\nwas doing\nand so there were a lot of people who\nwere my mentors and stuff who thought\nwho basically told me they're like the\ntitle really doesn't matter like\nyou should just do it and you'll get the\ntitle that you want in a few years\nand then i kind of took issue with that\nand i said well\nthis title is actually not the title for\nthe job that i'm doing and i want the\ntitle for the job that i'm doing it's\nnot about ego it's about like this is\nwhat i'm doing and i want a title that's\ncommensurate with that\nand they took an issue with that and so\nthen i said\ngoodbye\nso there wasn't any confrontation you\ndidn't feel\ni felt disrespected right i felt taken\nadvantage of\nand i felt betrayed because these were\npeople who and i think they still\ndo care about me they genuinely do\nthey've been incredibly supportive for\nyears and years and years\nand i'm sure they think i'm egotistical\nbecause after everything they had done\nfor me i\nwalked away but i just didn't think it\nwas fair\nright so i think if you're dealing with\nlike venom from the internet like you\nhave to be like centered in here\nand the more you're centered in here the\nless the criticisms matter to you like\nif you're doing what you're supposed to\nbe doing and you really didn't do\nanything wrong\nchances are i mean i mean there were\nthings that i did that were out of line\nand stuff like that so you reflect on\nthose and you grow from them\nyou even concede those points but i find\nthat\nyou know generally speaking like even\nwith twitch chat like there have been\ntimes where i've made\nmistakes of course\nand what i usually do is like i don't\nknow i mean i don't know how often\nthis is actually i apologize a fair\namount on stream\nand usually i find that the internet is\nlike actually a\nbizarrely understanding place like i\nrespect twitch chat a lot like i don't\nthink they're a bunch of mindless noobs\nwho are haters i think you've got to be\ncareful because there certainly are\ncommunities of people who are very toxic\nand they can hate you yep\ndo you think there's prejudice towards\nuh women because\nabsolutely people like i said\nmales young males i can't really relate\nabsolutely\nright so i said that at the get-go like\ni can get away with some things because\ni'm a\nman and you're gonna get a different\nshake\nand that's unfortunate like i can't and\ni can't pretend\nto say that what i can do is doable for\nyou because like\ni think you just deal with more venom\nthan i do\nright like yeah sometimes i really\nquestion if\nit's a waste of energy to even respond\nbut like if you don't put your five\ncents in\npeople you will just say oh okay\nwhatever is going on it's right\nbut mira the only way i find\nfrustrating about this conversation is\nthat i don't know what you're talking\nabout\nand i feel like if i understood what you\nwere talking about then it would be like\nway easier to like\nactually because we're talking about\nhypotheticals\nyeah but we use your situation it was\nperfect because like i actually\nthe first example with the parents\nit was actually perfect like i\ni really don't want to go into that okay\nbecause i don't know you know\nit's water under the bridge so well i\ndon't think it is though\ni don't think it's water under the\nbridge because whatever happened there\nshapes the way that you look at the\nworld and shapes who you are today\nof course i'm like so careful right now\nabout everything i\navoid any type of collaborate with like\nany any streamer at this point you're\nprobably the only\nthe first streamer i talked to in like\ntwo years like i've been streaming on my\nown since then it's just and now i find\nmyself being incredibly curious which i\ni'm not trying to push you i'm just\nsharing my feelings okay so please\ni mean i i can imagine you're gonna feel\npushed so be aware of that\nnow i find myself like what the [ __ ]\nactually happened with you mira like\nwhat happened\nyou don't have to answer that that's\njust like i hear you saying i haven't\ntalked to streamers in two years and\nit's like holy [ __ ] like what is this\ngirl gone through\nwhat happened to her\nthat's my that's my reaction when i hear\nyou say that\nand you've been dodging questions from\nthe get-go and i i'm fine with that\nlike every time i ask you a question\nlike you know your default is to ask me\nyou've been deflecting\nthis whole time which is fine i i get\nthat you this has been a place where\nyou've gotten\nscrewed and attacked so of course you're\ngoing to be doing that\ni think yeah i feel like it doesn't\nmatter what i say like\nthere's just a lot of prejudice at this\npoint so it's better not to talk\nabout it at all that pisses me off so\nmuch\nbecause i do not want to live in a world\nwhere it does not matter what you say\nlike that's not right your words should\nalways have value\nand like i don't want you to believe\nthat about yourself like [ __ ] however\nprejudiced it is\nbut like don't believe for a second that\nyour words don't matter because they do\nyeah i guess maybe because i didn't\nexpress like i said i am generally\npretty bad at communicating with people\nyou know sometimes you want to say\nsomething you feel a certain way but it\ncomes out completely different and\npeople\nuh take it differently so maybe because\ni didn't do it correctly in the past\nlike whenever i\ntry to say what i wanted to say just\nalways turn out to be not good\nso well like i'm talking about the\nsituations that we're not\nyou know like sticky iffy situations\nso i think it's just best to probably\nokay\ni'm sorry if i pushed you in a way that\nwas like made you uncomfortable\num i no you you didn't\ni it did remind me a little bit of like\nhow unfair some situations were and i'm\nlike\nand it's still sitting there i can feel\nthat emotional response\nbut it's not really what i wanted to\ntalk to uh to talk about on stream today\nthat's not it's in the past um\ni i feel like i'm i want to focus more\nlike the present and like what's going\non right now and\nhow much progress i made mira i i know\nlike i'm not\ni'm sorry if i'm you got to really let\nme know if i'm like doing something\nthat's\nthat's disrespectful but i don't think\nit's in the past right like we're\nwell this whole conversation is about\nyou looking inside\nand finding answers within yourself but\nthis [ __ ] is inside you\nand you're looking away from it\nyou've been looking away from this [ __ ]\nyour entire life like\nlike and and the thing the problem i\nmean there's so many subtle things that\nare actually like really really\nterrifying to hear you say\nright like to hear you say that your\nwords don't matter and i have no doubt\nin my mind that like\nwhen you were growing up with your\nparents you felt the exact same way\nbut the whole thing the whole point is\nthat you do matter and what you feel on\nthe inside\nis important and if people hurt you\nthat's not okay\nif they were unfair to you that's not\nokay\nand i want you to to find a place within\nyourself where you can\nsit with that and say that sometimes\npeople are [ __ ] on the outside\nbut it is not a reflection of who i am\nas a person\nthat what you want in life is important\nand that your words absolutely do matter\nand you are intelligent and you're\ncapable and you care about people\nand you're moving the right forward in\nthe right direction in life which i\nthink is [ __ ] amazing\ngiven all the [ __ ] that you had to deal\nwith\ngrowing up with a life where you've been\ngiven check boxes\nand then being in a place like being a\npublic figure where the world judges you\nfor what comes out of your mouth\nis terrifying and for you to like start\nto discover your own path\nand to to a certain degree move past all\nthat [ __ ] is amazing\nsorry sorry i should be apologizing\nbecause you've signaled to me several\ntimes\nthat this is an uncomfortable topic for\nyou and i just can't let this go because\nlike i don't want to let this go\nbecause it's not water under the bridge\nright it's water that's flooded your\nbasement\nand it doesn't belong there and it's got\nto get cleaned out because you deserve\nto be happy in life\nwell i think this is one of the battles\ni cannot win\nyou can't change their mind but you can\nacknowledge for yourself that it hurts\nand you can let it go\nyou can still speak your truth and take\nsolace in the fact that like\nyou were confident in who you are and\nthat you spoke your truth\nand that other people are not willing to\nlisten\nright now i think the problem is that\ntheir opinions of you\naffect the way that you view yourself\nexpectation that's why the trees are so\nhappy for you\nbecause you don't have to deal with any\nof that [ __ ]\nthe trees are wonderful yeah\nbut uh yeah to some degree it does\naffect me there were some\npoints sometimes in my life where i was\ngoogling again and why a psychopath or\nseeing a therapist or generally asking\nmy psychopath\nand when she was saying no i was like\nhow do you know if i'm a psychopath you\nwouldn't know i would trick you\nso twitch chat really makes you\nput some funny ideas in your head huh\nyeah so i think um i mean if it's any\nconsolation i'm kind of a psychopath\ntake that for what it's worth but um\nin which way so i think so we got to do\na stream about\npsychopathy and sociopathy because it's\nbeen coming up time and again but like\ni would love to watch that so\nyou know i think i think\ndoing so what what a sociopath or\npsychopath is\nsomeone who is able to separate their\nemotions\nor not feel emotions when they act in\ncertain ways\nthat's superior that's superior this is\nnot bad\nyeah i don't think that sociopathy is\nnecessarily bad why is it perceived as\nbad\nbecause some people\nbecause sometimes it leads to predatory\nstuff\nright so like people who can separate\ntheir emotions are able to hurt and take\nadvantage of people\nin a way that people who cannot separate\nthemselves from their emotions\ncan't so if i was free from all kinds of\nguilt it's way easier for me to be a\ncriminal\nright but if you test people for\nsociopathy\nyou find that politicians test highly on\nthe sociopathy scale\nbut also physicians surgeons and\npsychiatrists\nsurgeons and psychiatrists are the two\ntypes of physicians who test the most\nhighly\nand it's just because in my case like if\ni got overwhelmed by all of the emotions\nthat i feel\nwith people i couldn't be able to help\nanyone of course right\nyeah so being able to separate yourself\nfrom your emotions\nis a little bit of an adaptive strategy\nand in your case this comes back to the\nnumbness\nlike why do you feel numb it's because\nyou've got [ __ ] in there that you don't\nwant to feel\nand the whole point of like if you want\nto talk about how to find happiness you\ncan't be numb on the inside\nbut the problem is that you've got so\nmuch [ __ ] down there that you turn down\nthe volume it's kind of like\ni want you to imagine this for a second\nright let's say you've got a radio and\nthere's a\nstation that's playing really bad music\nand there's a station that's playing\nreally good music\nand how do you deal with the really bad\nmusic you turn the volume all the way\ndown\nand then you can't listen to the good\nmusic either because the volume is\nturned all the way down\nokay in order for you to be happy you\nhave to stop being numb\nbut the problem is that in order for you\nif you stop being numb\nyou're gonna dig into all this [ __ ] that\nyou say is water on the bridge it's not\nwater\nunder the bridge it was water under the\nbridge you wouldn't be feeling whatever\nyou've been feeling for the last couple\nof minutes\nand if people treated you bad like you\nshould feel bad about that and you\nshould feel\nsorrow and you should say that's not\nunfair and you should receive\ncomfort and if you [ __ ] up in some way\nyou should be reflective\nand you should be honest with yourself\nabout whether you made mistakes or not\nand you should learn from that and then\nlet it truly be water under the bridge\nand then you can be happy\n[Music]\nyour daughters are adorable by the way\none second hold on\n[Music]\nwhy are you all wet that's why she was\nlaughing\nokay it's okay i'll keep her for five\ntimes yeah yeah that's fine\nyeah we're just gonna meditate why are\nyou all wet\nokay\navi why are you all wet okay\num so hello hold on a second can i have\nthese\nno no no but

god we're gonna have reverb if i\nunplug it\nyou smell like soap\njust give me a minute okay i'm gonna try\nto drop her off okay let's go\nlet's go play something you can go play\nsomething okay\nokay go go go go go go go go go go\nshe's so cute\nokay okay\nyep all right\nmira questions sorry about that\num let's fix your hair\ncrazy banana\ncan you hear me okay yeah\num is it okay if you just

feel it\nokay let's step outside for a minute and\nthen daddy's gonna daddy's almost done\nand then we can play something okay but\ncan you go be outside for a little bit\ncan i finish up\n[Music]\nokay\n[Music]\nthey get so confused when i'm home\nand now we're home all the time so they\ndon't understand when it's play time and\nwhen it's not play time\nyeah i get it i get it so do you think\nit's important that\ni i really don't want to go into that\nso if there's any type of i guess\nnegative emotion from the past\ndo you really think i need to like do\nmore\nwork on that and i guess try to close\nthat\ngift i mean it doesn't have to be now\nbut if if it sits with you still like\nyou\nyou owe it to yourself to be unburdened\nof that\nright i can't just like\nmove on from that that doesn't really\nwork like that\num sorry\ni'm so sorry about this mira i don't\nknow if there\ngive me a second okay i'm sorry\nthis\n[Music]\ni'm really sorry about that mirror you\nwere saying do you have to\nyou ha do you have to deal with those\nemotions\nuh yeah i mean it's been a while and i\nsort of moved on from that but\num you know you kind of\nbrought up a few questions and erased\nemotions in me so you're saying this\nwill\nkeep effect in my overall state\nsomewhere there\nthis is going to keep sitting and i need\nto clean it up absolutely\ncleaning it up may not be as hard as you\nthink it is though\nwell see when i try to talk to a\ntherapist about this most of times they\ndon't even get that stuff and i mean\ntalking to people that\ncause the negativity in my life is\ndefinitely\nuseless so a good way to be just\nignoring it i guess close enough well so\nprocessing emotions doesn't have to\nhappen\nthrough talking about them so i think\nlike this is where something like a good\nmeditative practice\ncould help but you know if you're going\nto become a psychologist\nat some point oftentimes the training of\nbecoming a psychologist\ninvolves like doing therapy yourself\nlike being a client\nor patient in therapy i'm not saying you\nhave to deal with it now\nand it doesn't necessarily have to be\nwith a professional although i think\nthat's good and i'm surprised to hear\nthat you say that\nyou know therapists don't understand\nthis stuff\nyou know twitch and gaming and like so\nfar\nfrom what like normies i shouldn't say\nnormally like normal people\nyeah life are like they it's hard for\nthem to relate usually\nwell yeah but i mean i think a good\ntherapist is\nlike there are a lot of things i mean i\nhave a lot of clients that i don't\nrelate to because i can't understand\nlike take for example you like i can't\nunderstand i've never been crucified on\nthe internet before\ni'm not a woman on the internet and are\ngoing to be fundamental things about\nyour experience that i will never be\nable to understand\nright like how can i know what it's like\nto be a woman on the internet because\nthat's very different from being a man\non the internet\nhow do you advise in situations like\nthat you just do it for the best of your\nknowledge\nyeah so so if you don't know\nlike but in order to help someone you\ndon't have to be able to relate to them\nfully\nright you just need to be able to\nsupport them uh you kind of like lead\nthem in the\nthrough the process right and they do\nnot even lead them but like for example\nyou know when i have a client who talks\nabout postpartum depression\ni have no idea what postpartum\ndepression is like like i can't even\nbegin to understand postpartum\ndepression because i can't begin to like\nunderstand what it's like to be pregnant\nand when i talk when i work with women\nwith postpartum depression they'll say\nthings like\nyou know they'll feel like bad mothers\nlike they're not\na good mother and like i can't i don't\nknow what that feels like right like i\ndon't know what it's like\nwhen you can't breastfeed a child and\npeople judge you for not breastfeeding\nbecause breastfeeding is healthier than\nbottle feeding and all that kind of crap\nthere's a lot of stuff that i can't\nunderstand but it doesn't mean that i\ncan't help people\nand and the this is the beauty is that\nlike actually\nmira like you don't need someone to\nteach you and this is the whole thing\nyou're looking for me for answers like i\nthink you grossly underestimate\nwhat you yourself are capable of\nyou don't need someone who's gone\nthrough your experience and it's bad on\ntheir part if they didn't\nhelp you understand this or maybe they\ndidn't you just didn't have a good\nconnection with them\nbut like you're gonna you're able to do\nmost of this work on your own\nlike you need some help and some support\nyou need a space more than anything else\nyou need space to do this work and that\ncan come from trees it can come from\nmeditative practice it can come from a\nperson\nand you need to feel those things and\nthen like recognize that you were hurt\nand that you know you're scarred\nand also let yourself recognize that it\ndoesn't make you a bad person\nthat there have been may have been\nmistakes that you you made there may\nhave been things that you did that were\ncallous\nwhat is callus callus is like unfeeling\nright like you you may have\nyou may have done things without the\nconsideration of other people's feelings\nah okay but that too doesn't it doesn't\nmean that you're a sociopath a lot of\ntimes when people\nare mean to other people it comes from\nhurt\nand so like if you did lash out in some\nway or you were mean to people in some\nway like does that come from hurt or\ndoes that come from you being a bad\nperson\nbecause somewhere inside you right now\nis this idea that you're not good enough\nor you're a bad person or something i\ndon't really know\nlike there's something in there about\nthe way that you view yourself where you\nhave this like\nvery very like relentless focus on\npositivity and finding the right answer\nbut like why do you need the right\nanswer like why do you need to be better\nlike why can't you just be content with\nthe person that you are\nbecause there's something within you\nthat's like deeply discontent\nand what is that and why aren't you\nhappy right now\nwhat's missing from your life is it\nsomething external or is it something\ndo you believe that something that you\ndo in the outside world is gonna make a\ncertain feeling in here go away\nit's honestly not that i feel like i'm a\nbad person i feel bad about myself\nit's that whip that's telling me that i\nneed to progress\ni need to keep going just get better get\nbetter\njust fix everything be perfect get to\nthat final form that's what it is\nyeah right but if you think about that\nif you feel like you have to get better\nyou're not happy with who you are\nthose two things come hand in hand yeah\ndefinitely not fully and so how can you\nlearn to be\nhappier and what is it that has taught\nyou to be unhappy with who you are\nbecause that's learned top of the list\nis tiger parents\nhonestly it's just the society around\ni feel so good by myself like it's when\ni interact with\nother people not always but like there's\nsome interactions with other people it\njust brings so much\ntraction and i'm just like oh yeah\nbeing by yourself or somewhere in the\nnature just it's that's\ngood so absolutely i'm not a social\nhuman being i guess\nno i don't know that it's your social\nhuman being i think you're a human being\nwho's been hurt by other human beings\nso what if those human beings think that\ni heard them\nthey felt hurt by you i i don't know\nmaybe you were just not compatible\npossibly\nsure but you have to acknowledge the\npossibility that you did hurt them\nand maybe that's what you're steering\naway from\nso right mira we can definitely have\nyou know we can i'm gonna have to get\ngoing in a couple of minutes\nand i definitely want to teach you to\nmeditate and i want to give you a chance\nto ask questions if you have questions\num but let me try to like tie things up\nfor you so the first thing is\ni think that you're on a wonderful path\nand i you know i really am rooting for\nyou\num i don't know exactly what happened\ni'm not i sort of\nsometimes i wonder whether it's a good\nthing or a bad thing that i'm not too\nfamiliar with like\nwho people are on twitch um\nbut i think it's wonderful that you're\nlike exploring this and you're trying to\nfigure out what you want to do and that\nyou want to help other people\nvery concretely i think you should spend\nsome time being happy on your own like\nwith trees and stuff\nand the cool thing is like if you let\nsome of these emotions up i think the\ntrees are going to help you with those\nand you kind of let it up and you let it\nout and you leave them with the trees\nthe trees will take it\nthey have no problem with it and then\nyou kind of come back\nand then i think that you've just been\nhurt like you're someone who's been\ntraumatized\nright and you've gotta like you can't\ntrauma\nwater under the bridge is not is a lot\nof times what trauma feels like but it's\nnot really like under the bridge\nit's just in the basement it's not truly\ngone\nit's just tucked away\nand i think i can feel it on my own\nright if i just\nspend time with nature and just the good\nthings i hope so\ni hope so but maybe you can't i don't\nknow\nright yeah and and\nyou know i think there are definitely\nsome techniques that i can teach you\ntoday which hopefully will give you a\nbetter understanding of yourself\nthese techniques are not geared towards\nunderstanding i mean they're not geared\ntowards healing they're geared towards\nunderstanding\nand yeah i mean i think that\ni i don't know that you're gonna be able\nto heal it\non yourself and even then we see a\nsubtle\nexample of your thought process which is\nthis ideal of you being healed\nlike can you accept that you may never\nbe fully healed you'll never get back to\n100\nhp you know that you'll get to 90. like\nthat comes back to this once again your\nfinal form of a perfect healed\nlike that's the problem is like you you\nhave to accept that you're going to be\nflawed\nright right\nokay\nso thoughts questions before we meditate\nlet's get to it\nokay so um\nlet me first ask you do you wanna\nhave you done like breath oriented\nmeditation before\num i tried one hot one okay\num so i have two techniques both of\nwhich i've kind of taught i think on\nstream before\nso some of this may be familiar have you\nseen the charging the laser beam\ntechnique\nthat's what people call it here okay so\ni'm going to teach you a form of\nmeditation that\nis focused on your agna chakra agna\nchakra is your third eye\ni like that x in there\nthese are third eye meditations and if\nyou have the option to like if you ever\njoin like a yoga classroom meditation\nclass\nand people have can teach you third eye\nmeditations i would learn those because\ni think you have a talent for it\num so the technique is kind of weird so\ni want you to take your middle finger\nsit up straight take your middle finger\nis it okay that i'm cross-legged\nyeah cross-legged is great i'm actually\ngoing to sit cross-legged myself\nso take your middle finger close your\neyes sit up straight keep your neck\nstraight\nand i want you to hover your middle\nfinger above\nyeah a little bit further down yeah\nright there close your eyes\ndon't touch your forehead\njust hover it right above your forehead\nand then focus on the sensation\non your forehead do you feel anything on\nyour forehead\nwith your finger hovering above it\ni feel my left leg is falling asleep\nokay you can adjust positions if you\nneed to but\njust focus on the spot between your\neyebrows\nokay so hover means like\none sorry english is your second\nlanguage like a millimeter away\ncenter or okay\nand if you don't feel anything you can\nmove a little bit closer but you don't\nwant to touch\nand just concentrate on the point\nbetween your eyebrows\nmaybe a few millimeters above\nthe center of your eyebrows\nand hover your right hand middle finger\nabove it\nand now go ahead and let your hand rest\ncome down\nkeep your eyes closed and focus on that\npoint in your forehead\ntry to send your attention\nand your focus into that point\nmy headphones died sorry no problem\njust focus your attention on\nthe center of your forehead kind of\nbetween your eyebrows\nand tell me if you feel anything\ni think i feel\ni feel warmth in my face but i think\nit's because i'm just\nhot right now okay so notice that\nsensation\nand return your concentration to the\nto the eyebrow center\nand now take a deep breath in\nand notice the\nair as it enters your nose\nand notice the air as it leaves\nand now with a breath inward\nimagine the breath going up to that\npoint between your eyebrows\nfeel the coolness of the air as it\nenters your nose\ntravels up\nand now let your concentration return to\nthe point between your eyebrows\nlet go of the breath and bring your\nfinger up again\nand point it at the spot\nuh\nbring it down\nlet your hand come down\nconcentrate on the spot\nand now we'll bring the practice to a\nclose\nput your palms together in front of you\ni kind of like a namaste perfect rub\nthem together so you feel heat\nand warmth and friction fast fast fast\nfast fast fast fast\nand then come over your eyes cup your\nhands over your eyes\ntake a deep breath and as you exhale\nslowly open your eyes\nand let your hands come down when you're\nready\nhow do you feel\ni feel a little bit lighter\ni do have a lot of images going on\nthrough my mind though when i close my\neyes uh do you have that too when you\nmeditate\nnot usually what do you mean by images\nlike first when you told me to put my\nfinger here\nand i really started focusing on there\nwith my eyes closed i saw that i had a\nbig\nbolt going through my hat\nthen as i started breathing deeply in\nand it\nsaid to push that air through it i kind\nof pushed the bullet out\nwith the breath and i just had a hole\nso i was thinking about the hole that i\nhave in there and my scalp\nand then you told me to put the finger\nthere again and i put it all the way\nthrough and i started\ni had my hand and my head and going all\nthe way through my body it's just i have\na lot of images in my head usually when\ni\ntake yeah good sounds good to me\nyeah i think everyone's experience of\nthese techniques is different\nbut some of the sensations that you're\ndescribing to me\nmake sense and like i think you're doing\nit right basically\nand and if you have those images let\nthose images come and\nsee you know not that you should analyze\nthem\ntoo too extensively but if you want to\nreflect on their meaning that's fine\nand try to do the practice for let's say\nthree to five minutes and then\neventually work your way up to 10 or 15\nminutes\ni would shoot for three times a week\nalthough if you want to be ambitious and\ndo every day that's\nfine and then also\ngo ahead does it matter when i do that\nso the short answer is any time is good\nbut sometimes are better\ndawn and dusk are the best times for\nmeditation\nthere's some interesting stuff around\ncircadian rhythm cortisol levels\nand like your body's natural cycle and\ndawn and dusk are very attuned for\nmental or spiritual activity\nso if that's doable you know meditate at\nsunrise or sunset\nshould i try not to think about anything\nokay sorry\nexcuse me for a second\n[Music]\ni think i should let dr k go\nyou were saying should i try not to\nthink about anything\nall right if i do have this\nfeeling right yeah so as you have\nthoughts\nyou can kind of notice your thoughts but\ndon't get caught up in them\nright and then you know you can have a\nthought and then let your attention\nreturn\nto your forehead or your practice so\nyour attention is going to go away and\nthen it'll come back\nand then if you have images you can sit\nwith those images i think that's fine\nimages or sensations just sit with those\nand then a thought may happen but like\nan image is not exactly a thought does\nthat make sense\nright so i shouldn't try to block them i\ncan play with them right\nyeah sure play with them and then then\ndon't\nyou'll you'll see i mean you'll let\nyourself you can kind of play around\nwith it i think play with them is\nactually the perfect thing to do\nbut don't get caught up in them unless\nit feels\nlike don't get caught up in thoughts and\nthen after meditation\nyou may find that some of these thoughts\nor sensations\nor feelings start to arise and if they\narise after your meditation or before\nyour meditation\nor even during your meditation you can\nlet them come up\ndon't get but don't go down the rabbit\nhole with them\nand if you want to reflect or process or\nsomething like that you can do that\nbut i'd say especially after meditation\nis when you should\nlet your mind be active and think and\ntry to understand and reflect on what\nyour experience has been\nokay and in your case especially i don't\nknow that it's so much about time but i\ndo imagine it's about location\nso i don't know where you live or what\nthe state of germa you said you're in\ngermany\nyeah what germany is like but if you\nhave access to trees\ni would strongly strongly recommend\nthat you make this practice part of like\neven an hour-long thing where you go\noutside you hike for a while\nyou find a spot sit down meditate for\nlike 15 or 20 minutes\nand then you know let those thoughts\ncome up and those feelings come up and\nthen leave them\nwith the trees and then come back a\nlittle bit lighter\nyeah i'll do that thank you\nstrong work today thank you so much\nany final thoughts or questions before\nwe wrap up\nuh just please keep streaming\ni absolutely love what you do it's just\nso helpful to so many people\nwatching your streams just\nplease keep doing this cool will do\nall right thank you take care and good\nluck mira we're i'm really rooting
