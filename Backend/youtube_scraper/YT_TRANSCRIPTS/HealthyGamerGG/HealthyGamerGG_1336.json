    "transcript": "so tell me a little bit what am i how\nwould you like me to refer to you by the\nway uh Ingrid is fine Ingrid mine okay\nIngrid yeah Ingrid thank you very much\nfor coming on today can you tell me a\nlittle bit about what we're talking\nabout yeah thank you for having me um so\nbody dysmorphia um\njust general strong anxiety about\nappearance okay yeah that's it is okay\nsure so can you help us understand what\nyou mean by body dysmorphia um so but it\nis more yeah I know there's like\ndifferent kinds of it like transsexual\npeople have one kind of it I don't have\nthat kind my kind is that I am I see my\nbody my whole appearance as a lot worse\nthan it actually is okay and so like the\ndefinition is something like overly\nfocused on a flaw in the physical\nappearance that isn't necessarily there\nor is so insignificant that no one else\ncan see it okay and you're like you're\nso focused on it that it takes up so\nmuch time of your life and gives you so\nmuch stress okay and do you have a\nparticular feature in your body that you\nspend a lot of your time thinking about\nbasically all of it\nokay I I just I I am there's not like\none feature that's like I wish I could\nchange that it's it's it's basically\nlike I can't have a objective view of my\nbody it's like I don't know I explain it\nit's I see my voice cute like distorted\nsure wait how do they know that what you\nsee is distorted and I I don't think\nit's distorted okay so people told me\nprofessionals I'm talking doc told me so\nI guess it is I mean it doesn't seem\nlike thinking that your view is of your\nbody as a distorted does you much good\nno that's a problem okay so I'm gonna\nstart from kind of a weird place okay\nlet's just assume for a moment that\nyou're right instead of wrong so just my\nexperience being a mental health\nprofessional comes I've come to\nappreciate that\neven though sometimes our mind can think\nwrong things so let's think about\nsomething like suicide\nlike if someone wants to kill themselves\nI find that the most effective way to\nhelp that person is to not assume that\nthey're wrong and like that life is\nworth living it's to actually recognize\nfor that person in that moment life is\nnot worth living\ndoes that make sense yeah and and the\ncool thing is that it paradoxically like\nyou may think that you know telling to\nsua slike talking to a suicidal person\nabout why their life isn't worth living\nis like the wrong thing to do because\nthen like oh my god what if they kill\nthemselves it's absolutely a possibility\nbut strangely enough I think telling\npeople things that are contrary to what\nthey believe like doesn't help what are\nyou thinking about that I agree with\nthat it's like it doesn't help when\npeople tell me oh no you are pretty or\nyou look normal\nit's like thanks but doesn't change\nanything okay yeah so that's not what I\nwant to hear what do you want to hear I\ndon't know it's you I don't know what I\nwant to hear okay\nso what I kind of I guess I kind of like\nit would always be nice if someone just\ntold me straight to my face that I look\nterrible what is it another hassle yeah\nthen I don't have to worry about it okay\nso Ingrid right yeah Ingrid I'm so glad\nyou came on today can I just share some\nrandom thoughts so\nI feel optimistic and I'm grateful to\nyou I feel optimistic because I don't\nknow why I just do I can't make sense of\nit it sounds like you've seen\nprofessionals before and it hasn't\nreally helped much so I think every\nevery logical thought in my mind is that\nI'm not going to be able to help you and\nyet I feel optimistic today and I'm\ngrateful to you because I think this is\nsomething that is not talked about and\nnot understood and I think it's\nincredibly courageous for you to come in\nyou know and like let's just think about\nwhat you're doing in to what degree\nyou're courageous because you're someone\nwho has body dysmorphia you think you\nlook terrible and we're actually doing a\nvideo chat I I actually wanted to not be\non camera I can imagine so when I first\ngot a message but I didn't really want\nto say no because like you have everyone\non cameras yeah but why the [ __ ]\nwouldn't you why why are you on camera\nlike what's up with that don't you is it\nthat awful for you kind of like I was\nliterally shaking before like the 20\nminutes of delay I was just sitting oh\nI'm so sorry but I was gonna say I just\nI don't know it doesn't really matter\nbecause I I never have to talk to you\nagain or like no one in chat so it's\ngood yeah doesn't really matter and also\nI wanted to just try yes yes good for\nyou and I think it's it's really\nimportant I know this is gonna sound\nbizarre but it doesn't really matter is\nI think a wonderful way to live your\nlife I think so much of the torture that\nwe give ourselves is because we think\nMatt things matter we're like oh my god\nif I go to this party and people don't\nlike me then like oh my god it's gonna\nbe the end of the world no it doesn't\nmatter hmm\nand and I think that you've actually\ntaken a huge step forward by\nacknowledging that you don't have to let\nyour perceptions of your body or your\nwhat you really believe\nlike I say perception applies it's not\nreal you don't have to let being ugly\nget in the way of what\nyou do mmm and that's what we got that\nin and of itself is like amazing\nright let's forget for a moment about\nwhether you are ugly but I'm just gonna\nstep into your shoes and that's pretty\ncool what do you think about that I'm\nproud of myself\nlike damn straight I am I would never\ncarry on I don't know I don't like being\non camera at all sure and like right now\nyou have 2,000 people watching this so\nlet's make things boring so that it\ndrops down to a thousand yeah yeah so it\nhow does it feel to be on camera and on\nstream you said you were nervous for the\n20 minutes before but how about now it's\nfine now\nyes I don't know but I'm I'm just\nactually seeing you now I haven't read\nthe chaps so it's that you should stay\naway from\nchatez don't really get that but why do\nyou so let's just try to so Ingrid there\nare two things that I'd like to talk to\nyou about today one is to help us\nunderstand a little bit about where and\nhow these feelings and perceptions come\nfrom and the second is to forget about\nall that stuff and just focus on like\nwhy is it that the thought of being on\ncamera and actually being on camera is\nlike two different things right why\nisn't the thought of coming on stream\nactually more terrifying than actually\nbeing on scene because that's weird\nyeah that's right and if we can\nunderstand that and we can understand\nhow the body dysmorphia occupies your\nmind and shapes your mind maybe we can\nget some power over it not by addressing\nit directly not by telling you that\nyou're a beautiful person because that's\nlike that's like the content of your\nmind\nif that makes sense but what I'm talking\nabout is the process of your mind so how\nis your mind like how does it come up\nwith anxieties and then when you\nactually do the thing it's like easier\nthan thinking about doing the thing yeah\nbecause I can imagine that your your\nperceptions of how you look keep you\nfrom doing things yeah and I can imagine\nthat if they keep you from doing things\nthat may make life\nharder from you not just because you\nfeel a certain way about yourself but\nthen because then you're not doing those\nthings that make sense so yeah in a\nweird way we may be able to help you out\nby like not even talking about the body\nof morphia but just teaching you how to\nnot necessarily ignore it but like how\nyou can sort of outmaneuver it maybe\nit's a better way to put it hmm is that\nsound okay yeah okay definitely so let's\nstart with if it's okay with you we'll\nstart with like where these thoughts\ncome from and what you think about\nyourself is that okay well I don't I\ndon't know it comes from actually it's\nlike it's just kind of like something\nthat's manifested itself in my mind as\ntrue sure\nof course um I'm not really like trying\nto tell myself anything else yep so I\nspent a lot of time just looking at\nmyself in there's or hmm how much time\ndepends on the day sometimes hours like\nin front of mirror or photos like I\nthink that you're so myself for hours\nmaybe I'm like watching TV or something\nand I just take pictures but I delete\nthem all afterwards and it's like what\nare you looking for when you take a\npicture mm-hmm I always try to take nice\npictures so pictures were like like good\nangles good lighting and such apps I\nguess I'm just like looking for a\npicture outlook Nisan do you ever find\none I do that's the weird thing like I\nfind a lot actually really but the thing\nis like I just tell myself like that\nthat's not how I look like because this\nis a photo I see interesting I'm just\ntelling myself that like because you\nknow how much can be like influenced by\nlighting and angles\nsuch yeah I'm just telling myself like\nlike it's not what I look like because\nit's a photo sure so so it's kind of\nstrange right so like there's it sounds\nlike you actually take good pictures of\nyourself and and you're happy with the\nway that you look sometimes right maybe\nfor like one second when I look at the\nphoto right and keep in mind I'm like\nI'm taking maybe like five hundred\npictures for myself maybe four of them\nyeah so okay so what I'm what I'm\nhearing you say is that you have a\ncouple of pictures that look okay and\nwhen I repeat that back to you you\nrespond with yeah but that's like four\nout of five hundred so it's like you see\nwhat you're doing is you're kind of\ninvalidating what your observations are\nyou're arguing against the idea that\nyou're actually capable of looking\nnormal or attractive in a photo yeah do\nyou see how your mind does that yeah so\nyou said hmm sorry go ahead\nit'll so like even those four pictures I\ndo find it's an hour later I don't think\nI look nice anymore okay fine right so\nlet's think about that right so you say\nthat for a second you're like oh that's\na decent photo and then what happens in\nyour mind when I see a decent photo yeah\nit wakes up and says what like that\nsplit second is like oh maybe my nose\nlook okay there but then I'll just start\nthinking no that's because the lighting\nhits oh well something like that I'm\njust trying to tell myself that it's not\nnot what I look like because it's yeah\nso that's kind of so I just want you to\nnotice that sometimes your mind is able\nto appreciate a picture of you and\nanytime you start to appreciate a\npicture of you this other part of your\nmind wakes up and activates and it says\nno no no no no no no no Ingrid no no no\nit's just the lighting\nyou're not attractive it's just you\ntricked you tricked people into thinking\nthat photo was decent it's all trickery\nit's not the real you the real you is\nwhat ingrate how do you feel about\nyourself what do you think you look like\nI just feel I just look I don't know\nabortion okay I feel like I don't have\nlike a specific picture in my head of\nwhat I look like it's just I have I feel\nI am my proportions are unnatural like\nalmost as if I had a disease that's what\nI think about everything and everything\nmeaning yourself what are my appearance\nyour nerves okay that you're just out of\nproportion yes I I feel like I look like\na goblin resulting like some creature\nfrom Lord of the Rings or sure like a\ncaricature like it's not like normal\nlooking yeah yeah yeah like you have all\nthe pieces that a normal human has but\nyou don't look like a normal human is\nthat how you mmm how long have you is it\nokay if I ask you a few questions about\nthat yeah okay and by the way you know\njust a disclaimer that you can choose\nnot to answer anything hmm\nalso you can tell me to go [ __ ] myself\nat any point okay so can I rely on you\nto exercise both of those options if you\nfeel that like they're appropriate okay\nawesome yes\nall right so how long have you been\nfeeling like you were out of proportion\num since high school I'm 20 now so three\nyears ago no one else three or six years\nsix years ago okay yeah but it's been\nkind of up and down but it's been a lot\nthe last two years can you tell me a\nlittle bit about\nhigh school I always loved school\nso the actual like classes in such work\nI don't know I loved learning and just\nreading stuff\nthat's rare I I miss high school for the\nlearning I didn't really have so before\nhigh school I had two best friends and\nthey all they went to another high\nschool me so I didn't really have any\nfriends when I started there I didn't\nknow anyone and I didn't really get to\nknow anyone in those three years um so\nit kind of just I kind of just woke up\nwent to school did school which was\nsuper fun and went home and did my thing\nand I was fine with that I didn't really\nfeel the need to have friends there did\nyou feel lonely sometimes but usually\nnot do what what kinds of thoughts did\nyou have about your appearance in high\nschool it wasn't as badass as now it was\nI always thought that it didn't look\nfeminine at all\nI always thought and I still do that I\nlook like totally oh boy or something\nand I know I didn't look like a girl\nokay\nand it didn't help that everyone in my\nclass had kind of this joke too that\neveryone thought I was a lesbian which\nI'm not like but they're not that\nthere's anything wrong with being a\nlesbian but the reason they thought I\nwas a lesbian was because first of all I\nwas into like more boy stuff sure but\nand second gaming\nright off yeah and poor games like\nfantasy the Indians such I like football\nyeah more boy stuff so I I never really\nfelt like I felt like a woman but I\ndidn't feel feminine you know sure and I\ndidn't really feel the need to defend\nmillions but now I do but I can't do you\nfeel like you kind of missed the boat on\nthat yeah like you could have if you had\nbeen if you had acted differently or\nbehaved differently maybe you would be\nmore feminine than you are today yeah\nlike I say this my my two friends from\nbefore my school I'm still friends with\nthem today like my whole life I've known\none of them my whole life and my whole\nlife I've always been very boyish you\nknow sure and I am I was fine with that\nI kind of liked it because I was like I\nalways got to play with play football\nwith the guys and such and yeah so I\nfeel like now I can't go in the feminine\ncuz everyone I know including my best\nfriends as always it was always like\nthey we always had inside jokes about\nhow I can't wear a dress they would\nalways say it they would hurt a little\nbit but I wouldn't really care but now I\ncare\nthere's all the inside jokes about how I\ncannot be feminine because that's not me\nand how weird that would be if I did\nanything feminine hmm can I think for a\nsecond yeah\nI'm gonna need a few seconds okay like\nmaybe like a minute so of course I'm\ntrying to think there was something in\nmy head\nthat's very helpful\nI'm just not quite sure how okay so what\nI don't I don't know how it relates to\nthe dysmorphia but I this yeah so maybe\nit doesn't maybe it doesn't but what I'm\nhearing you say is that essentially\nyou're not really you haven't been\nallowed to be feminine I don't feel like\nit right and it starts like it's not\nstarted pretty early where you started\nto conceptualize yourself as like more\nmasculine and then I guess like when I\nwas 40 and I felt it was kind of cool if\nI was a tomboy or something\nsure cuz every other girl I knew in my\nclass was very feminine yeah so I got to\nhang play football with the guys and\nsuch in that that used to be kind of\ncool but what I'm hearing you kind of\nit's almost like at some point other\npeople haven't allowed you to be\nfeminine or haven't encouraged you to be\nfeminine at some point you stopped\nallowing yourself to be found on oh yeah\nso I noticed you're wearing a t-shirt\nyeah do you wear more like t-shirts like\nyou wear dresses or more traditionally\nfeminine clothing I own a lot of it but\nI don't wear it yeah so let's think what\nhappens when you try to put it on or you\nthink about [ __ ] putting it off I\njust on I just can't I just I can't wear\nit yeah what happened I just can't\nit's put it on and it's can you put it\non or you can't even put it on I'm not\ntalking about in public I'm talking\nabout like can you even try a dress on\nand in the privacy of your own home or a\nroom we can um but not the law how do\nyou feel when you put it on\nI feel stupid like I say to myself like\nalmost like how dare you believe you can\nactually wear this absolutely yeah\nright so the funny thing here is I I\ndon't even know and just so that that\nsounds like that kind of relates to the\nbody dysmorphia to me what do you think\nyeah I guess it does I mean I understand\nthat body dysmorphia has a particular\nrepresentation in your mind but I find\nit hard to believe that having a\nparticular view of how you look and\nbeing unable to wear a dress like I find\nit hard to believe that those are fully\nindependent so you know it's it they're\nprobably connected yeah yeah and and I\ncan understand why it's hard to connect\nthem because the way that those thoughts\nlook and feel are like very different\nright if you look in a mirror and you\nsay I'm disproportional or my from\nMartians aren't correct and you put on a\ndress and you you say how dare you like\nthose feel like different thoughts but I\nthink there's something about it's so\nhard it's like right on the edge of my\nunderstanding it's like at some point\nyou didn't no one allowed you to be\nfeminine and then you didn't allow\nyourself to be feminine and then instead\nof not allowing it it became true does\nthat make sense like something shifted\nI'm getting the sense of a shift where\nyou used to be like how dare you and now\nyou're like I can't does that make sense\nlike it became like a fact instead of\nlike a choice feel like it would mean I\nwould be comfortable with wearing maybe\na men's jacket the nurse yeah that makes\na lot of sense and I know it's like it's\npretty normal for girls to wear male\nt-shirts and such so I don't know maybe\ndoesn't count but\nI would feel more comfortable wearing\nmen's yeah so you know oddly enough I'm\nnot getting any sense of gender identity\nconfusion from you\nno right right I am yeah\nso that I'm pretty clear on that I also\ndon't get the sense that you're actually\na transvestite if that makes do you know\nwhat a transvestite is yeah yeah so just\nthe way that I remember it is\ntransvestites or someone of a particular\ngender who wears another genders\nclothing but it doesn't mean that they\nthink that they are like so that I then\nthe world citizen huh yeah it's\ncross-dressing so it's not actually like\nyou know a man who wears women's\nclothing is not doesn't think that\nthey're a woman and they're not\nhomosexual has nothing to do with like\nsexuality or gender identity it's just I\nyou know the trick that I use to\nremember or when I was learning this\nstuff is you know transvestite has the\nword vest in it and so it's about\nclothing it's about what you wear on the\noutside it's about nothing about who you\nare on the inside but I'm not getting\nthe sense that you're a transvestite\neither I think no yeah I like to put it\nanother way it's like I want to I want\nto wear female feminine clothes that I\ncan't so I wear I don't really wear\nmen's clothes I don't but I would be\nmore comfortable wearing it but not\nbecause I want to write you know because\nit's it's uncomfortable for you to wear\nI don't I don't want to wear men's\nclothes but I would rather wear men's\nclothes no okay I think yeah yeah oh god\nsorry please III so I rather where I I\nwear clothes maids for women but like\nnot particularly feminine of course like\nthis t-shirt yeah\nit's the questions how to help you\ndo you want help yeah what do you want\nto help\n[Music]\nI don't know it's it's just too I wish\nthere was like some way I could just\nrealize that like I don't even need to\nfeel pretty I just need to feel normal\nyou know so I don't know actually cuz\nlike I don't know and if you realize\nthat what would change about your mind\nwhat would change about the person that\nyou are well I definitely wouldn't spend\nas much time worrying about it worrying\nabout what about how I look like if I\ncould just settle with I'm normal true\nthen I probably wouldn't spend as much\ntime thinking pictures and looking in\nthere yeah it's it's kind of sad\nactually to think that you would be\nhappy with just being normal\nyou know yes I mean I feel sad when I\nhear you say that I I remember even\nfeelings to some degree that way myself\nnot so much about appearance but that I\nwas less than human in a lot of ways and\nI didn't want to be exceptional or the\nbest I just wanted to be normal\nyeah I don't I don't need to be I don't\nneed to like feel like I'm gorgeous but\nhow do you want this a normal one\nI just want to feel not terrible\nlike not like a goblin hmm and when did\nyou start to feel like a goblin\nI haven't actually thought about it that\nway before but uh that's what we're here\nfor\nthink about things but um I guess the\nlast year has been very like yes peached\nokay yeah so we're not talking about the\npeak right so you said you played D&D\nyeah a little bit more\nokay yeah you like fantasy stuff yeah\nlike do you remember you know looking at\nsomething from the fantasy genre whether\nit be a video game or book or movie or\nwhatever and like looking at a picture\nof like a monster or goblin and thinking\nlike oh that's what I look like\nthat's me well clearly no it's never\nwouldn't I'm actually looked at them\nI've never related to it but it's more\nlike in my mind\nsure okay and what about when so you\nsaid high school is when you started you\ndidn't have many friends in high school\nI had I I was neutral everyone so no I\ndidn't really have friends I didn't have\nanyone any outfit and how did you feel\nabout that it was actually it's okay\nactually because I still had my two best\nfriends in the other school that I saw\nin my spare time sometimes and are your\nbest friend's girls or boys girls and\nare you still close with them yeah not\nso much one of them but missing Newt but\nthe other one I'm still close with hmm\ncan you tell me a little bit about your\nparents and what growing up was like I\nhadn't I probably had the ideal\nchildhood so parents are there they've\nstayed together are we're we never\nstruggled with money my parents has\nalways been supportive they've always\nkind of kind of their whole idea of how\nto raise children is just let them\nfigure things out and it'll be okay you\nknow so like they didn't let me do\ndangerous stuff but they left me kind of\nlets me take risks they let me do\nwhatever what I wanted and felt like and\nif that went bad\nto learn the consequences you know\nmm-hmm\nsome would say that's not ideal but I\nwould say it's pretty good because the\nthe their their philosophy philosophy\nwas that as long as you're honest we\nwon't be mad and as long as as long as\nyou ask you if you do something wrong or\nbad as long as you take responsibility\nit's fine what with limit limitations of\ncourse so it sounds like you you you're\nvery grateful for the childhood you've\nhad I am everything was fine\nis your mom feminine yeah she's not\nsuper feminine but she wears dresses and\nshe doesn't wear makeup she's she has\nlike a very feminine personality and she\ndresses feminine but she's also very how\ndo I say this\nshe has characteristics of more like a\nmasculine like she's handy and mm-hmm\nyeah so it sounds like you had a pretty\nyou know like a role model in your life\nin terms of your mom that was a little\nbit more on the masculine side yeah same\nwith my sister she has always been very\nfeminine has has always been very\nfeminine yes\nolder or younger older three years old\ndo you remember what it was like if you\nhad thoughts about when you were in high\nschool so when you were 14 and she was\n17\ndo you remember thinking about the\ndifference between you and her but not\nin a negative way yeah just that we were\ndifferent very different she was very\nlike\nshe wore makeup she wore feminine things\nshe explored a lot with fashion and just\nways of expressing herself through\nclothes and makeup and such she liked\nmore feminine things when she was 15 she\nloves Twilight yeah all that stuff how\ndo you feel about Twilight I don't like\nit but I feel like Who am I to say it's\nbad because I'm not the target audience\nit's it's good for 12 year olds I guess\nso I work you don't like Twilight that\njust means you have good taste I guess I\ndon't like it but I I can see how a\nfourteen-year-old girl would like it I\ncan't even see how a 14 year old girl\nwould like it long but and and so what\nI'm hearing you say Ingrid is that you\nknow when you were in early high school\nhe started\nI mean you've known that you aren't very\nfeminine but it really wasn't a problem\nfor you when did it start to become a\nproblem\nI guess when when most people around me\nstarted when people like when people you\nknow just reach a certain point where\nthere's suddenly a difference between\nboys and girls like there's not much\ndifferent difference when you're eight\nyears old you know but I'll explain it\nwhen when all the girls in my class we\nweren't a lot of girls in my class but\nwhen all the girls in my class suddenly\nwere so focused on all the feminine hmm\nand the guys were more masculine it's\nlike I had all the same interests as as\nguys in my class but I kind of wanted to\nhang out with the girls you know but you\nkind of didn't know how to yeah I\nremember there was I was invited to a\nbirthday party once in a girl in my\nclass I think the reason she invited me\nlike she didn't want to be mean or\nanything but we didn't really know each\nother\nthe like we were only seven girls in my\nclass and she was inviting everyone else\nso she invited me too and I remember\njust sitting there and did not know what\nto do or talk about because I couldn't\nrelate to anything I did not know how to\njoin the conversation how did you feel\nlast year I felt awkward I wanted to\nleave because it was boring boring yeah\nI said I I didn't really care about\nanything they were talking about and\neverything they were talking about kind\nof seeing that I don't know the word in\nEnglish\nlike what's the working language\nover flawless which is they only talk to\nthings that don't matter and I'm not\nsaying you have to talk about important\nstuff all the time like you can\nobviously talk [ __ ] and small [ __ ]\nstuff they talked about things that are\nlike so insignificant that I don't even\nknow what to add yeah there's there's\nnothing for me to grab you know do I\nthink for another second\nI Ingrid I'm sensing a lot of tension\nbetween judging something and wanting\nthat thing like I can almost sense like\nin your mind like a sense of you don't\nreally want to be feminine like you want\nto be feminine but you don't really care\nto be found them you know it's like\nthere's a part of you that like wants to\nwear dresses and there's a part of you\nthat's like completely happy being\nmasculine and like it's kind of shallow\nand like makeup is sort of silly but at\nthe same time you want it yeah it's it's\nI kind of disagree with you on that\nbecause um I'm sure he didn't mean it\nlike that but I feel like the way you\nsaid that sounds like more important\nthoughts are more like masculine while\nshallow things are feminine that's what\nI heard I know I didn't mean it like\nthat\nthat's it interesting let me just think\nabout that for a second yeah do you feel\nthat way though no I don't okay do you\ndo you judge yourself for wanting to be\nmore feminine\nkind of but kind of not yes just kind of\nnot because I feel like it's it's a\nnormal thing like when you are happy\nwith the gender you are I I guess it's\nnormal to feel like you want to look\nlike that genders sure no of course let\nme ask you something when you were at\nthat birthday party did you feel left\nout yeah that did you feel I know this\nis gonna sound kind of weird but\ndisproportionate mm-hmm did you feel\nlike a goblin not physically at that\ntime but I guess like mentally I felt\nlike I didn't wasn't supposed to be\nthere didn't belong - yeah\nso when I when I think about not so I\ndon't I'm not supposed to be here and\nand like I can almost envision when you\nput on a dress there's a part of your\nmind that says I'm not supposed to wear\nthis like this isn't me well yeah it's I\ndon't know how to describe it it's uh it\nis what you're saying it's true okay so\nyeah so so I think it's kind of\ninteresting because you know I guess\nthis is this is where I sort of I didn't\nuse good words and thank you for\npointing out you know where you disagree\nbut I guess I get a sense of like\nthere's a part of you that wants this\nand there's a part of you that judges\nthat that's what I'm sensing that you\nwant to wear a dress\nI get that you're sensing that that's\nnot what I meant\num I'm not saying like femininities\nshallow because they're not it is I know\nso so I think that wasn't a good example\nso so I'm trying to clarify so I think\nthat like you want to wear a gendered\ndress but you also judge yourself for\nwearing a dress\nall right let's forget about shallowness\nand femininity for a moment but just\nthat there's a part of you that like\nwants it and there's a part of you that\nblames you for like trying to have it\nHey\nthat's a better way to put it hmm is\nthat fair\noh yeah I want to I want to feel okay\nwearing feminine stuff yep and when did\nyou start judging yourself or when did\nyou start thinking that it's not like\nit's awkward or it's not you to wear or\nbe feminine wear feminine things are to\nbe feminine when did that start kind of\nalways been like that it's it's always\nbeen like that that I it's just been\nit's been always been a part of my\npersonality to not be feminine right and\nnot just good not just to me\nso everyone yeah fine so I'm not talking\nabout whether it's been a part I'm\nasking when did you start judging\nyourself for it oh right because you're\nalso saying that used to be perfectly\nfine like being a tomboy but at some\npoint that changed right at some point\nyou started to become less okay with\nlike being more masculine and less\nfeminine is that basically around\npuberty no I guess it was last year of\nhigh school\nmaybe second-year high school\nwe're taking her 30 what happened then\nwhat happened tell me about that I don't\nknow watch it I I don't know um I just I\nremember its it kind of went like slow I\nwhat I thought I remember one day I\nthought maybe I want to wear makeup\ntoday\nto school just because I think makeup\ncan be can it looks like it can be fun\nyou know I didn't do it but and it's\njust like my thoughts like I just\nstarted coming yeah why didn't you do it\nI think it's very helpful tell me why\ndidn't you do it because I didn't first\nof all I knew everyone in class well not\neveryone people in class and my friend\nwould comment on it\nlike doesn't matter if it was positive\nor negative they would notice it and\ncomment on it if I showed up at school\nwith Mike what does that mean to you\nthey kind of wished I just wish they\nwouldn't have said anything they just\nlet me wear makeup and not say anything\nabout it I didn't want I didn't want\npeople wouldn't notice it why did you\nwant to be noticed why do you want to be\ninvisible\nI never I've never liked it\nI don't like being noticed\nwell I a lot of being noticed by people\nvery close to me but everyone else is I\ndon't I don't want to be noticed by\npeople I'm fine with just like walking\nthrough and not be noticed yeah that is\nqueer question is what does it mean to\nbe notice to you what happens when\npeople notice you I get embarrassed why\nwhat where did you where did you learn\nthat noticing comes with it being\nnoticed\ncomes with embarrassment it's just like\nI've thought about this before and like\nI can't put it into words\nbut best way I can describe it is like\nif I enter a room you know how when if\nyou're in a room and someone else enters\nroom you immediately like look at them\njust because that's what you do I just\nhate the thought of entering a room and\nbeing aware that other people in the\nroom is aware that I just entered the\nroom even if they don't care I entered\nthe room even if it don't look I mean I\njust hate thought of the people being\naware of me how long have you been like\nthat\nsince I was like I don't remember\nexactly like 12 13 14 maybe did you have\na crush on anyone in high school not\nreally I never really thought about\nstuff like that have you ever had a\ncrush on anyone well okay now gonna say\nsomething but I have a boyfriend so it's\nyeah that's a whole other story but like\nbefore him I never had any interest in\nanyone romantically I never even had a\ncelebrity crush how do you understand\nthat what do you mean how does one\nunderstand like so like most people you\nknow tend to have a crush at some point\nduring high school hmm right so if\nyou're not if you don't have a crush\nduring high school then what do you\nthink is up with that I think it's\nbecause when I notice in my relationship\nnow I how do I say this I don't I\nhonestly think my boyfriend is handsome\nbut I really really care about looks\nthis arm that looks thing cares about\nlooks like a normal person like do you\never know why he's with you yeah all the\ntime\nI ask him all the time what is he saying\nhe say cuz I love you what is that how\ndo you feel when he says that\nI mean it makes me feel happy because\ncuz like personality-wise why it's sure\nbut looks I don't know why he stays\ndoesn't do better yeah so I mean does\nthat doesn't sort of make sense that he\nsays because I love you not because\nyou're beautiful\nwhat do you mean like so does he ever\ndoes he ever comment on your appearance\ndo you know and how do you feel when he\ndoes that he does seat a lot and I I say\nhe's a good boyfriend well yeah he I say\nthank you but it's like I I don't\nbelieve it it's like he's just saying it\nbecause he has to because it's my\nboyfriend\n[Music]\nhow are you feeling right now talking\nabout this I hate calm like I was so\nstressed before the stream but it's it's\nfine now what is it like talking about\nit I've done it so many times with\nprofessionals that I just I've said\nthese sentences before so it's it's fine\nwhat's I don't working with\nprofessionals I don't notice I've been\nunlucky with the professionals I've been\nset up with but I it's been terrible\nwhat's been terrible about it\nit's they will I've never felt like that\nactually try to understand what it feels\nlike it's been more like they've I\nalmost felt like a test subject that\nlike Adam no which is one of the reasons\nwhy I applied to be on stream because I\nfeel like you talk differently than the\nones I found him so you're saying it\nfeels like a being a test object how so\n[Music]\nbecause they and they've told me so many\ntimes like this is the way that we have\nseen is working and etc that's why we're\ndoing this but it's it's they asked me\ntons of questions that I feel like\ndoesn't get me thinking at all because\nthey're just asking questions I've\nalready asked told them the answer to\nbut they're not they're not connecting\nthat together so I just feel like I'm\nrepeating what I've already said I feel\nlike I am explaining I I'm explaining\nhow I feel to them and then they are\ntrying to understand it but they're not\nour state they're not it feels like I'm\nthe one you're the expert in the room\nyeah if you look on the expert I'm gonna\nbe getting anything from you sure yeah\nthat's what it's been with the\nprofessional stuffing gravy are you ugly\nI think I am wasn't the coin I think I\nam what is there doubt oh really\nso I'll ask you again are you ugly yeah\nhow long have you been ugly I guess\nsince puberty\nI feel like children aren't Oakley\nthere's children oh sure what are we\ngonna do about that I don't know I have\nno idea\nhmm\ndo you think it's possible for me to\nconvince you that you're not ugly I\nthink it's possible to feel less ugly\nbut not no not not ugly okay\ndo you think you can live a happy life\nif you are ugly yeah do you are you\nhappy usually not but what gets in the\nway of your happiness like I've um\nduring this whole quarantine thing I've\nfelt a bit better because I don't have\nto go out but um I don't know it's as I\nsaid before just the thought of people\nare aware of me you know did you have a\nproblem being noticed when you were a\nkid like I didn't get attention or\nsomething no you didn't like attention I\nnever liked the tension so do you really\nthink your problem do you wish that your\nmom had taught you how to put on makeup\nor your sister time you put on makeup\nwhen you were in high school no not\nreally\nit's um I don't know how to answer that\nbecause I wish I had just done it and I\nthought that they had pushed it on me\nperfect that makes sense\nokay Ingrid I'm gonna share a couple of\nthoughts with you if that's okay I feel\nlike I could ask you more questions but\nI'm not so sure that they would get\nanywhere so I'd like to share some\nthoughts with you and then get a sense\nof whether you think we're on the right\ntrack or not and then we can try to\nfigure out where to go from here hmm\nso the first is I think it's very\nstrange that you the way that you\ndescribe your high school experience\nlike and maybe this is just me\nprojecting my own high school experience\nbut I think it's very strange that you\nwere not attracted or had a crush on a\nsingle person during high school what do\nyou think about that I know it's strange\nbecause like even if you don't have a\nhuge crush on someone people usually\nhave like people day\nabsolutely [ __ ] hormones right yeah I\nnever really liked that you you started\ngetting your period and stuff sometime\naround high school well way earlier than\nthat but really do you know when girls\nget their periods\nyeah well how old were you when you got\nyour period sirki okay so but a high\nschool is 14 right oh no my country is\n16 so oh god okay so so you got your\nperiod when you were 13 and then did you\nnotice changes in your body around that\ntime too I'm yeah did people treat you\ndifferently around that time no did\npeople treat other girls differently\naround that time like did the boys treat\nother girls differently around that time\nI don't I don't really know okay I don't\nknow okay it's I don't think so okay so\nlet's kind of go back to high school and\nlet's let's kind of toss in what ever\nwas before high school too so I just\nthink it's a little bit strange also\nthat you said that like during high\nschool you really didn't have any\nfriends and you were okay with in high\nschool or before in high school yeah\nthat also strikes me as a little bit\nstrange okay because my understanding is\nthat most people so it's not that\nstrange to not have friends in high\nschool what strikes me is a little bit\nstranger is to not want friends in high\nschool I was just I was just have been\ndoing my school work that's I understand\nthat you were happy doing your school\nwork but I think that you were let me\nput it a different way would you say\nthat you are comfortable doing your\nschool work comfortable yes yeah in high\nschool would you say you were\nuncomfortable on interacting with other\npeople yeah usually yeah yeah right so\nyeah so I mean that also is not like a\nlike you know that applies to pretty\nmuch everyone but what I'm noticing in\nyou in grid and and just try to take a\nstep back and just like like try it as\nbest as you can to listen to what I'm\nsaying pull yourself out of your own\nshoes for a second and what it sounds to\nme like is you actually have you\nprobably have things going on within you\nthat you're not really aware of or don't\nremember so I think that this comes down\nto comfort and discomfort and that you\nlet yourself you you're kind of like you\nstrike me as somewhat avoidant right\nlike if things make you uncomfortable\nit's like really hard which is why I\nthink it's so awesome that you actually\ncame on stream that's [ __ ] insane but\nthat that you know you tend to shy away\nfrom things that make you uncomfortable\nwhich is a completely normal thing for\nhuman beings to do but in your case I\nthink you've even shied away from some\nof your thoughts and feelings from a\nyoung\nand that like I don't think that you\nsuddenly develop body dysmorphia at the\nage of like seven I mean people do you\nget diagnosed with it because it becomes\nit becomes like problematic like you\nsaid a year or two ago like that's when\nit you use the word Pete right like when\nyou talked about bodies this morphe you\nsaid it peaked like a year ago\nbut that still implies that it started\nway before that but whenever I ask you\nquestions about like you know how did\nyou feel about your appearance and\nsometimes you can give me answers that\nmaybe are the ones that I'm looking for\nlike when we think about that party in\nhigh school that you got invited to\nthere's so much laced into there the\nfirst is that like and I want you to\nnotice like you even have such a low\nopinion of yourself that you say the\nonly reason she invited me is because\nshe invited everyone else do you see\nthat like it's like you're not even\nworth inviting does that make sense like\nin your mind as you tell the story it's\nlike there's no reason she would want to\ninvite me you're not worth and great and\nyou kind of say well we weren't really\nfriends but she invited everyone else so\nshe must have invited me and like that\nmay be true but the point here and this\nis the really interesting thing is that\nsome people who are most people who find\nthemselves being unhappy or like not\nsomething in their life isn't going well\nthey usually blame someone else right\nmm-hmm and and so but then when I ask\nyou a question and it's kind of\ninteresting that you know your mom isn't\nso feminine and your sister is like\npretty feminine that you don't really\nblame them you blame yourself\nand so what I'm detecting at the bar at\nthe bottom of all of this whether you\ncall it body dysmorphia are not being\nfeminine or whatever is a sense that\nlike you are not like worthwhile in some\nfundamental way that you are not worth\ninviting to a party that you recognize\nand I think the cool thing is that there\nare parts of you that recognize that\nlike you have Worth is a human being and\nI doesn't seem it seems like I get the\nsense that it's not alien that there's\nthere's a guy out there who loves you\nthat's not alien to you right like that\ndoesn't feel weird or does it\nwell no um what feels alien to you is\nthat there's a guy who's attracted to\nyou physically yeah and and so it's kind\nof interesting because I think you have\nparts of you that recognized that like\nyou're a decent person and you're you're\nfine and stuff like that but there's\nthis undercurrent of like assumption\nthat you're not gonna get invited to a\nbirthday party like unless they're\ninviting they're just doing it to be\npolite and and I think that that this is\nwhere we've gotta really like I'm\nwondering what other so as we try to\nunderstand why you have these feelings\nor where these feelings come from by the\nway do you want to jump in or comment\nlisten I'm on the right track wrong\ntrack makes sense doesn't make sense it\nmakes sense yeah so the basic issue is\nwe talk to you about like body\ndysmorphia and feminism not feminism but\nlike feminist femininity femininity\nthank you\nyou know like it's like I feel like\nwe're missing some piece of the puzzle\nhere like you could describe certain\nfeelings and you can say okay but like\nthere's just some things that seem like\ngaps to me and what I think is going on\nis that you're probably moving away from\ncertain thoughts or feelings because\nthey make you uncomfortable which is\nbizarre because like you wouldn't expect\nthat right because like now you're\nyou're telling us things like when I\nlook in the mirror I feel\ndisproportionate I feel like I'm a\ngoblin like I feel like I like you know\nyou're because you're saying lots of\nstuff that makes us makes it appear like\nyou're giving us a transparent look at\nyour mind which you are but I think\nwhat's missing is that you didn't always\nknow how to do that right like as as the\nbody dysmorphia crystallizes in your\nmind you can give us a more transparent\nview of what's going on in your mind\nmake sense so I don't think you're\nhiding things from us it's just that I\nthink this started a long time ago and\nyou have like very little awareness of\nit like in high school yeah so in a\nbizarre way I think the way forward is\nto really tunnel down because I think\nthere's there are some things that\nsomewhere along the way like people made\nyou feel like you do not you're not\nfeminine like I don't think and I think\nsome of it was tomboyish but I would\nguess that there is some insignificant\nevents in your mind that actually were\nquite significant\nI should also probably say I forgot to\nsaid I have had comments said to me in\nhigh school schools about my appearance\nnegatively yeah so but here's the\nquestion so I think here's the turning\npoint Ingrid when so at some point those\ncomments I think hurt you because you\ndidn't believe it that about yourself\nand at some point you started to believe\nthose things about yourself does that\nmake sense like it's bizarre because at\none point those probably hurt you but\nnow if someone tries to tell you the\nopposite it's hurtful it flipped yeah\nthat's exactly cuz I remember I didn't\nreally care that much when they told me\nthe things but somewhere along the way\nsomething flipped and I think if you\nwant to get free of all the [ __ ] that's\nwhere you have to find you have to find\nthat point it's like I'm gonna just say\nthis again because I think it may be\njust to clarify and think out loud so\nlike now when someone calls you pretty\nyou're like [ __ ] you you're wrong but\nthere used to be a time where someone\ncalled you ugly and you said [ __ ] you\nyou're wrong yeah and so I wouldn't say\nI wouldn't say that I didn't think that\nthey were wrong I just didn't really\ncare so much so that two strikes me as\nsomewhat like numb right so uh so I I\nfind it hard to believe like you say\nthat you don't care about a lot of stuff\nthat's very surprising to me like you\nsaid you didn't care I mean you don't\nand it's possible you don't care but I\nthink oftentimes not caring is a sign of\nnumbness right like not caring is not\nfeeling and so I think that that too is\nlike a protective mechanism that you\nnumb that part of you you suppress those\nfeelings and then you end up with the\nwords I don't care because if something\nhurts us one of the best ways we can\nprotect ourselves is to not care yeah\nbut my sense is that every time you say\nI don't care\nthere's actually a little bit of hurt\nand that if you want to get free from\nthe body dysmorphia you have to start by\nlike figuring out in what ways that\nactually did hurt because not caring is\nthe way that you protect yourself right\nlike oh like when my dad was supposed to\npick me up on the weekend and we were\nsupposed to go to a baseball game\ntogether he didn't show up\noh I don't care right hmm when my\nparents picked me up an hour late and I\nwas the last kid at school every day I\ndidn't care I was fine with that and\nthis is where like it really bizarrely\nlike you know I mean not to you know\n[ __ ] things up even more but even the\nway that you approach your feelings is\nincredibly masculine how what do you\nmean because you your standard answer is\nI don't care well yeah I I I'm admitted\nthat I care now yeah yeah I get that I'm\nnot trying to blame you for saying I\ndon't care I'm I'm pointing out that\nlike somewhere along the way how are you\nfeeling right now am i attacking you no\nit's fine okay you sure yeah I don't\ncare there it is again so now now Ingrid\nwe're gonna do a little bit of work I\nwant you to tunnel down because I don't\nthink you 100% don't care okay I think\nsomething that I'm saying is creating a\nlittle bit of negative emotion in you I\ndon't know if you're angry at me I don't\nknow if you're frustrated if you're sad\nif you think I'm wrong I think there's\nsomething there I can see something in\nyour face okay what do you what do you\nthink that could be do you really not\ncare are you are you asking me if I care\nabout how you just said my way of\napproaching feelings are masculine just\nall of it well yeah I care I don't\nreally care about what you just said but\nokay else I care are you four pence on\nwhat we're talking about sure very very\nfair\nsir as I've been speaking to you have\nyou noticed any kinds of emotions um I\ncan't even like name them I don't yep\nI don't I guess I have but I I they're\nnot being like super strong yeah yeah so\nthat so Ingrid I think that in that's\nwhere you need to go right because I\nthink what's going on is you have\nactually a lot of stuff you have a very\nrich internal environment but the\nproblem is that when I listen to your\ndescription of your internal environment\nit's very like it has a couple of\ndifferent colors one is that Ingrid like\nlooks [ __ ] weird right\nand then like Angra doesn't care about a\nlot of things and Ingrid want certain\nthings and then it makes you feel\nuncomfortable when you put on the dress\nlike what does that mean discomfort is\nnot actually an emotion no so when you\nput on a dress do you feel ashamed of\nyourself mm-hmm\nis that like something that you're kind\nof like do you know so what else like\nwhy do you feel ashamed of yourself when\nyou put on a dress well I feel ashamed\nyeah well where's one thing is as I said\nearlier like how dare you young and so\nwhat is that emotion it's just like I'm\nnot I can't\nme I can't wear a dress because I am me\nand who are you I'm I'm a girl I can't\nwear feminine stuff I think there's more\nto it than that the problem is that I\ndon't I can't name it yeah right like\nthere's there's some kind of like\nloathing there\ndoes that word make sense or fit at all\nI'm not sure with loathing means\nloathing is almost like hatred okay yeah\ndo you have some degree of like hatred\ntowards yourself well yeah okay this is\nthe way said well like obviously is that\nis that new for you or like you've\nalways known that all along it's it's\nnot new but it hasn't been there okay\nwhen did you start hating yourself\nprobably a high school like second year\nmaybe see it like it's interesting\nbecause you can give me specific answers\nyou can say this happened to the third\nor fourth year this happened in the\nfirst year this happened in the second\nyear and so what happened to your second\nyear of high school what happened that\nyou started hating yourself don't know\nif it's I um I was like in high school I\nwas I was scribed I guess I was kind of\narrogant high school absolutely and I\nknew that wasn't a thing and I didn't\nlike that why were you Merrigan why are\npeople arrogant because I think they're\nbetter than others that's why I don't\nknow no no\nso people that's what arrogance looks\nlike but people are arrogant because\nthey're afraid they're not better than\nothers they're afraid they're not normal\nright so arrogance actually comes from a\nlack of self confidence\nokay I did not move yeah so so generally\nspeaking the way that I view arrogant\nsaid I don't know if you've seen me talk\nabout Vedic psychology have you seen me\nin any of that stuff I probably have so\nI think you're a very classic case of\nlike Vedic psychology to like understand\nyou so I'll try to give you a very quick\nprimer so we have three parts of our\nmind five\nbut let's explain three so one is your\nemotional mind one is your ego and one\nis your rational mind so your emotional\nmind experiences emotions and then your\nego usually steps in to try to protect\nyou from your emotions so like your ego\nwill do things like oh you know if I\nfail a test I'm gonna call the teacher a\ndumbass for writing such a poorly\nwritten test does that make sense like\nI'm not going to just because the idea\nthat oh I actually failed or unstopping\nis so painful my ego kind of turns on\nand starts blaming other people now in\nyour case I think that your arrogance\nlike if you were arrogant in high school\nlike that's strange right like I'm just\nI want I want to just paint you the\npicture that we have a view Ingrid and\nmaybe I'm assuming but I would imagine\nto echad has this like you're like shy\nyou're like the sort of like the quiet\nkid like you don't really have a whole\nlot of friends you spend you enjoy\nstudying you're kind of a tomboy\nyou're not very feminine you're not\nflirtatious you're not confident you're\nkind of the kid that's invisible and\nit's strange to think of the kid who's\ninvisible is arrogant but the kid who's\ninvisible absolutely is arrogant right\nbecause most of twitch at is invisible\nin school and [ __ ] arrogant all the\nway the most arrogant they have very\nvery strongly held opinions they're\nsmarter than everyone else they have\nsuper high IQs and they're [ __ ]\narrogant and they judge other people and\nthey feel left out and they're invisible\nand people don't invite them to parties\nand they just get invited to parties\nbecause like they're a person who's\ninviting you is being polite making\nsense so that arrogance is protective\nbecause like the alternative is if\nyou're not arrogant in those situations\nthen you just feel awful because it\nlike I'm a no one no one likes me like\nyou can either be arrogant and and sort\nof say like oh these people all suck at\nlife I'm smarter than they are or you\ncan say no one really likes me and I\ndon't have any friends\nso that makes sense it's really mundane\nread your facial expressions right now\noh sorry no no it's okay I mean I'm not\nblaming you I'm just commenting so I I\ndon't know like if I'm I don't know if\nI'm you're buying what I'm selling I\ncan't tell but I am because it's\nillogical it's not yeah but I mean\nbuying what I'm selling is not about\nlogic is it resonating with you it's\nokay to say not really um a little bit\nI'm not sure actually you're not sure if\nit's resonating uh no no you're not sure\nor I'm not sure if you're not sure okay\nyeah hmm so that so I don't know if I'm\noff the mark or whether you're just numb\nto whether things are resonating it's\nhard for me to tell but I'd guess that\nI'm off the mark no it's more like um no\nmore like you're numb yeah yeah\nso let me just kind of let me take a\nstep back and just think for a second so\nIngrid it so first of all I think that\nyou can I don't think so commenting on\nyour appearance I think is like how can\nI say this\nso I think you can start to feel better\nabout yourself I absolutely think it's\npossible and I think it's because this I\nI don't know I mean maybe you can do\nsome kind of like CVT kind of stuff or\nsomething like that there appear tickly\nand I have one or two suggestions for\nyou from from a very practical\nstandpoint about how the process of your\nmind works and how thoughts function in\nyour mind but the first thing is that if\nyou want to not feel this way and you\nwant to feel comfortable wearing a dress\nyou've got a couple of options one is to\ndo exactly what you did today which is\nthat today you want it to be invisible\nyour concern that you are\ndisproportionate when you came on stream\nand you showed your face and somehow you\nwere able to like take those feelings\nthat you have and essentially say it\ndoesn't matter\nso like the question is when you're with\nyour boyfriend can you come to a place\nof peace and kind of accept that it\ndoesn't matter whether he finds you\nattractive or not are you okay with that\nno not yet no right so so this is this\nis the kind this is one solution is that\nyou can you can start to learn\ndetachment and like to not let your\nfeelings dictate how you behave what do\nyou feel well I feel like you're\nshutting down kind of M yeah what's that\nI don't know let's talk about that this\nis exactly what we're talking about I've\nbeen losing you for a little while now\nright yeah I don't know how to put it\ninto words I guess it's uh I I'm just I\ndon't know it's\nI'm listening to you and sure what\nyou're saying is true but okay what\nabout it\nso what it what is that Ingrid I think\nthis is very important\nand we have to understand what what is\nwhat is the but I I don't know it\ndoesn't do anything it's okay it's like\nokay now I know this cool I know this\nyeah so what I'm curious about is like\nwhen did that change when it when I\nstarted explaining things maybe yeah I\nthink so I don't know why because it's\nnot like I'm not I'm not\nit's not like I'm disagreeing with what\nyou're saying I get that you're not\ndisagreeing I just don't think you're\nbuying what I'm selling which is fine\nI'm not I think we need to understand\nwhy that is so what am I missing Ingrid\nwhat is it that I don't know like here's\nwhat I'm sensing from you now you can\nsay whatever you want it's completely\nlogical but it doesn't apply to me\nbecause what what do you mean like like\nI'm envisioning in your mind the the the\nbody language and facial expressions\nthat you're sending my way tell me in my\nin my mind I'm imagining the thought in\nyour mind is all this is fantastic but\nit doesn't apply to me because something\nwell yeah because\nI'm not really allowing myself to have a\nproblem I guess I'm not really it feels\nlike you are describing someone with\nbody dysmorphia that it doesn't apply to\nme\nyep and like that's making me doubt like\ndo I have bought a dysmorphia but why\ndoesn't that apply to you what's\ndifferent about the people that I'm\ntalking about the person that you are I\nwish I could answer better I don't um\ntake take your time\n[Music]\nlike I'm just me and I'm me and garden\nstuff that's going to be absolutely why\nnot what's different about you what's\nspecial about you tell me about how\nyou're different from other people I\nwouldn't say I'm different I would sound\nvery average no I don't think so oh\nbecause you're saying that what I'm\nsaying applies to other people but\ndoesn't apply to use there's got to be\nsomething different about you see this\nis what your mind does it jumps in and\nlogically discounts whatever you're\nfeeling like how are you feeling you're\ndifferent because you're just telling me\nthat like you're you just told me that\neverything I'm saying applies to people\nwith body dysmorphia but it doesn't\napply to you and then when I asked you\nin what way are you different you say\nI'm just average fine but like what how\nare you different why does why does\neverything that I have to say not help\nyou at all\nI feel like you're expecting me to have\nsome answer and I'll explain it but I\ndon't I just don't feel like it applies\nto me because\n[Music]\nI guess maybe because I'm never really\nmaybe it's because I've never been like\na part of like I've never been a part of\nthe girls and I've never been a part\nwith the guys so like if I have a\nproblem with not fitting in then that's\njust like normal I don't know let me try\nto put your dude good Ingrid you're\ndoing good you feeling frustrated yes\nokay good so I think you're doing\nfantastic I'm letting you flounder by\nthe way because a lot of the a lot of\ntimes when you said that you you haven't\nhad words I don't know if you notice but\nI jump in and I offer you explanations\nbut I don't think that's actually\nhelping us so I think you've got to\nlearn how to flounder and I know it\nmakes you feel uncomfortable and now I'm\ngonna reflect back what I heard from you\nwhat I can say sounds wonderful and\nlogical but it applies to normal people\nit applies to people who have body\ndysmorphia and or women or body\ndysmorphia and or men but like I'm an\noutsider\neverything that you say applies to the\ninsiders and I'm an outsider what do you\nthink about that is that fair I'd mean\nfair like is that act like a fair\nrepresentation of how you feel yeah I\nthink so so would it be fair to say that\nlike I just can't really help you or\nunderstand because I've worked with a\nbunch of people who are insiders or I\nmyself in an insider and I just won't be\nable to understand you so can you repeat\nthat\nyeah like would it be fair to say that\nand I notice it's gonna sound weird so I\nreally want you to think before you\nanswer okay that like I'm not going to\nbe able to help you because I'm just not\ngoing to be able to understand you\nbecause you're just an outsider\nit's\nI mean I first of all I think like\nunless you had a unless you've had body\ndysmorphia you never truly understand I\ncompletely agree everything but that\ngoes without saying I guess I'm gonna\nbut um I completely lost maternal [ __ ]\nthat's okay\nah I think you've been working hard\ncognitively for the last hour or more\nyeah and how do you feel about just sort\nof I know it's gonna be kind of\nunsatisfying but how do you feel about\nkind of winding down sure okay if if you\nif you don't have anything more to add\nthen I guess it's no point\nI can try to share some closing thoughts\nI just don't think that we're gonna\ncrack this today because that's what\nbody dysmorphia is like so here's Ingrid\nhere's what I would suggest to you if\nyou're interested in suggestions the\nfirst is that like I think you've got to\ngo back to high school and try to really\nfigure out why if there were things that\nyou felt which you weren't aware of yeah\nand and i think that something about\nthat is because i think it comes down to\nthis idea of like one thing swept right\nwhen did when did other people when did\nyou have a view of yourself that was not\nugly let's not focus on pretty for a\nsecond but just there was a time at\nwhich you didn't really think about\nugliness versus prettiness right and\nthen there was a time where you started\nbelieving that you were ugly or\ndisproportionate right hmm and so I\nthink if you want to be free of this\nthing which I think it's possible and I\nknow you\nI imagine you disagree then you have to\ngo back to like that point and try to\nexplore where the flip happened because\nnow you are sure like you kind of talked\nabout when you say I talk about people\nwith body dysmorphia you don't even\nthink you have body dysmorphia right\nit goes up yeah officials have told me\nand when I feel like even is it like\nI've had a good day today\nI haven't been fun at all today good so\nthis has been a good day but when I have\nthose bad days which is a lot I\ndefinitely think I have it but it's like\nI definitely think I have it then but\nit's I'm still kind of not allowing\nmyself to have it so that also like is\nthat something you were aware of like\nthey're not allowing yourself to have it\nI a little bit okay because I think\nthat's huge - because I think this comes\nback to judgement and allowing yourself\nto feel certain ways which also kind of\ngoes back to high school but I think\nthat this is really really important\nthat you you know you're not willing to\ncut yourself a break does that make\nsense like you're not willing to say\nlike this is not okay because there's a\npart of you that doesn't believe that\nthis is an illness there's a part of you\njust that just believes that the rest of\nthe world is wrong they just don't\nunderstand right like it's not yet\nanyone sick here it's just that they\njust can't [ __ ] use their eyes yeah\nright and and that's how you feel right\nit's like like well even when I say oh\nyou can be free of this one day there's\na part of you that I think rebels\nagainst that and says this guy doesn't\nif I the second I say that I've lost you\nbecause you're like there's no way to be\nfree of this because it's fact it's like\nhow can you be free of gravity you can't\never be free of gravity and start flying\nthere's no there's no universe in which\nI'm gonna wake up one day and I'm not\ngonna feel this way about myself because\nthis is true hmm and that's the not\nallowing and it's very very dangerous\nand I think this kind of comes back to\ncomfort and discomfort because if you\ndon't allow yourself to be better then\nyou don't ever have to face the dress\nyeah and so I think the real challenge\nhere is like like because when you when\nyou when you when you accept that you're\nugly and you're not feminine sure it\nhurts but like you can deal with that\nthe possibility that you could be\nbeautiful and if you put on a dress and\nyou put on makeup and and did your hair\nor whatever like whatever feminine ideal\nof beauty that you have the possibility\nthat you're actually beautiful like what\ndo you think about that does that\nthought scare you\nnot really I feel like I feel like what\nyou're thinking right now is like I\nwould I would just be happy if I was\njust content with being ugly but if I\ncould feel beautiful then yeah that\nwould be great I don't think that I\ndon't think you would be content I mean\nyou can learn to be content being ugly\nthat's one path but I I think that\nthere's a part of you that's not\nallowing yourself to be beautiful\nbecause something about that is like\nfrightening to you and like well it's\nit's frightening in the sense that I um\nI have worn a dress like in public and\nrecently but like last year and that was\nscary what's scary about it I feel out\nof place\nit's uh no one said anything negative no\none really said anything about it at all\nexcept my boyfriend you almost became\ninvisible yeah yeah so Ingrid I I think\nit's gonna be hard like I think you have\nto allow yourself the possibility of\nbeing pretty but I don't think you want\nto do that right\nlike I think there are two pieces one is\nthat you there's a part of you that\nthinks that it's impossible to be pretty\nand I think there's another part of you\nthat doesn't allow yourself to try to be\npretty I've tried to feel pretty but it\nhasn't worked and if I go on I just feel\nso anxious yeah so very practically have\nyou done exposure therapy before No\nso very practically you may want to try\nthat right so like just because you go\nout and you don't feel pretty like what\nhappens the next day like could you wear\na dress like what would happen if you I\nmean I think you should consider seeing\na therapist because I think this is in I\nmean this is tough so having worked with\npeople with body dysmorphia I can tell\nyou that it's probably the most\nchallenging patient population I've ever\nworked with\nokay why is it because I think in their\nminds things are not flexible like it's\nnot it's not an issue of like there's no\nexploration it's just facts so I was I\nworked with some like body builders and\nboy that's just really hard yeah they\nare they're the most in-shape people\nthey look artificial like they don't\neven look like real humans and yet it's\nnot good enough and it takes a long long\ntime to figure out like where to date\nlike so in Ingrid which you've got to\nfigure out it's like I'm not disputing\nthe fact that you're ugly I'm not\ndisputing that because that doesn't do\nyou any good\nmy question is when did that start when\ndid you learn because what you've really\ngot to do is go back to the point where\nlike you when you say you didn't care\nlike there was like sure you like the\nreason you didn't care is because it\nhurt you to hear that\nright so I want you to translate I don't\ncare into I'm suppressing this emotion\nand it's numbing me like there's no\n[ __ ] way that you can tell a\nthirteen-year-old that they're ugly or\nmake fun of them or like call them not\nfeminine and that they don't care so\nthat make sense yeah like it hurts them\nhmm\nbut you're not aware of that hurt and so\nthis thing this body dysmorphia has been\ngrowing within you for a long time and\nyou only noticed it when it became very\nvery severe but it started a long time\nago and what I can tell you is that if\nyou can understand like if you can go\nback to an Ingrid who did actually feel\nnot even pretty but like could just\ncompletely neutral about her appearance\ndidn't care\ndidn't think about other people when she\nwent on in public with a dress because\nthat part of you exists right like you\ndid that one day and try to figure out\nlike how did you like when you were 9\nyears old like did you wear dresses and\ngo outside no when I was 9 when I was\nyounger because my mom picked my clothes\nso right so like this may go even\nfurther back than high school so part of\nthe reason that we may not find the\nanswer there is like when did use when\ndid you start to like really give up\nyour femininity and this when you say\nlike that I think like it was very early\nbut when I did it it it when I did it it\ndidn't really matter because like it was\na mix of like I it's fine and also it's\na bit cool to be a tomboy fine yeah so\nso I I don't know that like so my point\nis that I think you got a lore of this\nstuff and if you're willing to see a\ntherapist again I think the main thing\nto look for is to try to find like you\nknow all these times when you say you\ndidn't care because someone said\nsomething to you I think it was actually\nhurtful\nand then at some point they didn't need\nto say it to you and the reason it hurts\nis because like\nyou didn't believe that about yourself\nmm-hmm\nand once you started believing yourself\nabout yourself then it no longer hurts\nwhen people call you I go right like\neven when you say you just wish your\nboyfriend would call you ugly and get it\nover with yeah I tell him that right so\nat some point like my point is that\nthere was one point in your life where\nyou when someone insulted your\nappearance and you said I don't care but\nyou did care you were just suppressing\nthe hurt and then at some point that\nchanged and it was no longer like but in\norder for you to be hurt by someone\ncalling you ugly you have to have a\nbelief about yourself that you're not\ngoing with me\nhmm and then at some point that belief\nabout yourself changed and you have to\nundo whatever that damages yeah and I\nthink that's something that you probably\nneed to work with someone like a\ntherapist but in a targeted fashion\nwhere you need to steer them instead of\nlistening to all their [ __ ] about\nbody dysmorphia that's I did try and do\nbecause I've been talking to a therapist\nbut I stopped because I didn't want to\nshe was terrible and I did try to go to\nlike an up an organization for students\nthat offers very cheap therapy sessions\nand I waited there and I waited there\nfor like 40 minutes he called me in he\nasked me like what what do you what's up\nand I explained it to him and five\nminutes later he just said not we can't\nhelp you and he said no way so I I don't\nknow where to go okay well I mean we\ndon't offer therapy but our recovery\ncoach program is about to launch in a\nweek or two and if you're interested you\ncan try to work with one of our coaches\nI wonder if they'll be able to help you\nI mean I don't think they'll be able to\nhelp you with their body dysmorphia but\nI wonder if they'll be able to help you\nin some other ways like in terms of\nunderstanding the way your mind works\nand things like that but I would also\ngive therapy another shot\nit sounds really really awful I don't\nknow why someone would say after five\nminutes we can't help you like I don't\nknow what did you tell that I I told\nthem that I hope body dysmorphia and I\nspend a lot of time worrying about my\nparents and it's exhausting\nand I don't know what to do and the\nthing is like I think he was very busy\nreal in a hurry so it like it almost\nfelt like he just wanted to like as\nquickly as possible just like getting\nout that's awful\nyeah because he he he was 40 minutes\nlate when I got there I explained he\njust he just he didn't do anything he\njust he looked so he was just waiting\nfor me to leave and when I was finished\nI was like ya know that we don't do that\nIngrid knew something yep how did that\nmake you feel\nI was shocked cuz like even though I\nhaven't been happy with the therapist\nearlier they have never just dismiss me\nlike that how does it feel to be\ndismissed it feels like what I'm\nthinking it's not valid at all so I\ncalled my boyfriend and told him and he\ngave them an angry call and yeah I was\nthinking how does it feel to have your\nthoughts and your feelings not be taken\nseriously you're suffering to not be\ntaken seriously it's\nit's kind of demoralizing like\nabsolutely I'm really in a weird way\nIngrid I'm really happy to hear you say\nthat because the answer can you guess\nwhat answer I was afraid of I don't care\nit's beautiful\nso I think that's a step in the right\ndirection to be completely honest I\nthink to be rejected and to recognize\nthat you were hurt by rejection is\nactually like really really important\ncuz I think the point here is that like\nyou started to develop a view about\nyourself because just think about this\nfor a second you got rejected time and\ntime and time again in all manner of\ntiny tiny ways about your appearance\nabout your femininity about not being\ninvited to birthday parties parties and\neach of those points something started\nto grow within you it was like this evil\nevil seed of body dysmorphia and since\nyou were so good at ignoring it all the\ntime it just continued to grow and grow\nand grow and grow and grow until at this\npoint can't ignore it anymore it's\ngigantic\nit's blocking out all of your windows\nand you can't get out of your house\nbecause it's there it's all around you\nand it feels so real to you because this\n[ __ ] is it's like it's in every part\nof your mind and you have good days and\nyou have bad days and the good days you\nforget but the tree is still there it's\nlike just because I choose not to look\nout the window and I don't see the tree\ndoesn't mean the tree has gone away but\nI do think that there's hope for you I\nthink it just involves going back to\nlike understanding each time that you\nyou know felt those little injuries and\nyou let that tree grow going back and\nundoing that a little bit can I can I\nhear your opinion on something else I\ndon't know if it relates to this go for\nit\nbut I was I served in the Navy uh-huh\nand during that time it was like first I\nwent to boot camp and so obviously like\nwe got up at 5:00 worked so hard all day\ndone at 8 p.m. mm-hm\nso like what I experienced there\n[Music]\nwhat I experienced there was I during\nthe day when we were like things were\nconstantly happening there was no brakes\nI did not think about any of this hmm\nand I didn't feel numb but I don't feel\nlike I changed how I interact sure\nbeautiful so but once like we we were\ndone for the day and we got to do\nwhatever we want I just broke down just\ncried in the bathroom and in the bed\navoided people and I don't know why yeah\nit's uh yeah so what do you remember\nwhat yeah I can see you even getting\nemotional thinking about it yeah I\nstarted having panic attacks like pretty\nfrequently during that time hmm do you\nstill have panic attacks not really um\nnot lately\nokay so Ingrid I think that makes a lot\nof sense to me but I think it's maybe\nhard to explain so in the past on stream\nI've talked about this principle of\nwhack-a-mole with mental health issues\nso I'm gonna have to explain a little\nbit of context is that okay mm-hmm so in\nmy work with people with borderline\npersonality disorders so this is a\nparticular condition where people don't\nhave a clear sense of their internal\nsense of self they don't know who they\nare on the inside and so what happens is\nthe way that they feel about themselves\nis the way that they're treated so if\nI'm empty on the inside when I look on\nthe outside the way that other people\ntreat me determines Who I am as a person\ndoes that make sense with me so people\nwith BPD tend to\nhave three behaviors sometimes that all\nkind of it's hard because they'll\nthey'll have drug problems so they'll\ndrink alcohol or use drugs they'll do\nself injurious behavior like cutting so\nthey'll cut themselves or burn\nthemselves with cigarettes or things\nlike that\nor they'll have very restricted eating\nbehaviors so they'll you know they'll be\nhad that's it by the way okay so we're\ngonna get to that okay so why what\nhappens with BPD is that anytime you try\nto treat one of these problems the other\nones get worse so when they go to like\nwhen they get into eating disorder\ntreatment their drug use and their\ncutting gets worse if you hospitalized\nthem where they can't cut and you take\naway all their razor blades and they\ndon't have access to drugs they stop\neating their food in the hospital so\nit's almost like anything that you fix\nmakes the other ones worse so the ways\nand I want huh it's Lakmal so I think\nwhat's going on with you Ingrid is oddly\nenough it doesn't surprise me that you\nhave restrictive eating and other that\ndoes Navy experience because I think\nyour mind has a particular way of like\nprocessing and managing your emotions\nand what it does is it beats the [ __ ]\nout of you that's what it does so you\nhave some like thoughts and feelings\nwhich like the only way that you know\nand I want you to think about this for a\nsecond\nwhen you take pictures of yourself you\nare feeding the Beast right like even\nthough you feel terrible about yourself\nthere's something incredibly satisfying\nabout feeding that hunger you're sitting\nthere and you're watching TV and then\nyou get hungry and then you start to\nsnack you pull out your phone and you\ntake a picture of yourself and then it's\nlike ooh that was a delicious chip let\nme take another one and then another\nchip and another chip and another chip\nand another chip and even though you\nfeel on the surface on some degree\nterrible about yourself there's\nsomething that feels very satisfying\nabout it right and then what happens is\nyou go to [ __ ] boot camp and then\nwhat don't you have\ntime to do it boot camp is feed this\nbeast and then you've got these emotions\nthat are like piled up inside that don't\nknow what the [ __ ] to do because they're\nlike hey Ingrid we had a deal we were\ngonna beat ourselves up for hours and\nhours and hours a day and look in the\nmirror so that we can feel these things\nand now you're taking that away from us\nand then stuff comes flooding back and I\nwouldn't be surprised if your eating\nbehaviors were bad when some other this\n[ __ ] was good well yeah yeah so I mean\nlike going forward I think this still\ngoes back to this like Ingrid do you get\nthat like when you were in the Navy like\nyou didn't have the place to feel those\nfeelings so they came out it all goes\nback to like not really understanding\nwhat you feel you've got all the [ __ ]\nthat's going on inside you like you know\nyou have all of these like it's just\nstuff that's going on inside you have no\nway of dealing with it so you've got to\nfind someplace to start digging into\nthat and understanding how you feel\nyou're incredibly Alexa thymic if you've\nheard me talk about that before well\ninability to tell what your internal\nemotional status okay right and like\nhalf of them huh that doesn't sound good\nI mean it's it's a protective mechanism\nand video games makeup turn do that to\nus too so they're like when you you know\nlike so let me ask you this when you\nplay a video game how do you feel I I\ndon't exactly I just play and have it's\nfun exactly right so like like you you\nhave your video games are a way to get\naway from that hungry beast right yeah\nyeah so I mean like that's why we played\nso I think you're like I think you've\ngot to start by understanding what your\nfeelings are and you got to start by\nunderstanding that it's not true it's\njust that truth comes from like all of\nthis pile of you know little like how\ndoes someone\nsomething to be true right they have\nexperiences over and over and over and\nover again until one day you walk\noutside and you know how gravity works\nhmm so in your case you had a thousand\nor 10,000 experiences telling you that\nyou're an ugly person does that make\nsense like you don't just wake up one\nday and believe that you're ugly that's\nnot how it happens no so you were taught\nto believe that about yourself in some\nway maybe you taught it to yourself and\nif you want to be different if you want\nto be able to wear a dress again you've\ngot to like go back and and undo some of\nthat stuff but it's it's it's weird cuz\nI don't know how long are you talking\nabout yeah I don't know either\nI've been hour and a half I've had\ncomments said to me quite a lot in high\nschool but like as I said I felt like I\ndidn't care I probably did care but\nabside felt like I didn't care so we're\nlooking for so sometimes on stream it's\nlike one thing right one moment in your\ncase I don't think that you are aware\nthey still could be one moment but each\none of those things is like a little\nlike strengthens that beast within you\ngives you the idea that Ingrid is like\nIngrid is an ugly person hmm I think\nit's gonna take time I mean it's not\nlike a one one stream kind of thing you\nknow it's like you got to really dig\ninto this and you're welcome to join our\nprograms and stuff we try to teach\npeople out of meditate and things like\nthat it's complimentary to therapy if\nyou decide to engage with a therapist I\nwould give it another shot I'm sorry\nyou've had bad experiences unfortunately\nthat's what we what I hear over and over\nand over again\nis that mental health resources suck ass\nI'm sorry about that yeah yeah I can't\nreally afford a private one either so it\nwould be someone the doctor it would be\nsomeone like the doctor set me up with\nlike one\nby the government sure what country\nyou're on it Norway okay so it's free\nhere but in my experience they're not\ngood yeah I'm sorry about that so I mean\nwe have I mean hopefully we'll be able\nto help you out a little bit but anyway\nI mean coaching isn't therapy but you\nknow we can try to teach you some things\nlike meditation and stuff like that but\nby the way do you want to meditate today\nsure you can try I don't believe in it\nbut I can try what do you believe it I\ndon't even mean well first of all like\nit's not really like the way you do the\nmeditation thing but like we've had a\nlot of meditation gym class for some\nreason okay and I hate it\nwhat do you I can't sit still I can't I\nfeel like a physical feeling tingling in\nmy whole body that's not good\nit can't sit still I was excused from\ndoing it in the end because like I it\nhurt it's not great I don't know what's\nup with that\nyeah buddy that's all suppressed emotion\nmy friend\noh okay so I want you to understand when\nyou meditate so I want you to think\nabout what are you feeling\nIngrid you know what are you feeling\nright now yeah I can't put it into words\nokay Oh Ingrid okay\nsorry no no problem it's I mean it's\njust what are we gonna do with you we're\ngonna have to do something I'm just\ntrying to figure out how I'm trying to\nthink about how to help you and I don't\nthink and I had something else yes I\nthought about when you explained you'll\nsee so when I take the pictures I\nsometimes post the nice one on Instagram\nI have a few followers in this room and\nI shouldn't do it but I do it cuz\nand when I do not I get a lot of\npositive response but I don't even\nbelieve that yep so I don't know why I\ndo why do I do it\nlike my whole Instagram page with\npictures or like me or what I'm wearing\nwhat I'm doing it like it doesn't feel\nlike me it doesn't look like me why do\nyou do it I don't know I've thought\nabout quitting quitting so many times\nbut but you can't yeah I always come\nback to it I've got an answer for you I\ndon't know if it's if you're able to\nhear it or not because I think Ingrid\nyou know like there's a war going on in\nyou one in which you know you're an ugly\nperson and wonder which you may not be\nan ugly person right and and you want\npeople you're the part of you that knows\nthat you're not an ugly person is\nlooking for looking for ammo to continue\nfighting yeah but it's hard\nyeah what do you think when people will\nhead us in every night how does your\nmind react when you post something\nwhy do you post things on Instagram let\nme just ask you what are you looking\nlike it's hunger right like it's hunger\nyou feel hungry when you post things on\nInstagram I feel hungry and then I feel\nashamed because I I don't I don't really\nwant to post those pictures cuz I don't\nI'm I'm not gonna say I don't care but\nlike I feel like I don't I don't care\nabout posting stuff about myself there\nit is so very good I want you to really\npay attention to your words right I feel\nlike I don't care like you don't want to\ncare but you do care yeah this is thing\nyou've always cared Ingrid even in high\nschool you've always cared\nyou just didn't watch it and you were\nbetter at deluding yourself then because\nyou had the brain of a 13 year old but\nyou have always cared and you're just\nbursting at the seams in emotion like\nnow that I'm trying to get off the\nstream and end it you're keep on you're\ntelling me more and more things well\nsorry\nyeah no no it's okay like I see this too\nI think this is part of your pattern\nactually that like in a sense like we've\ntalked for a while and now like I'm\npushing you out the door\nright just like that other guy who is\nlate and you actually have a lot to say\nand it's very helpful it's very valuable\nI think it just takes some time to get\nthere in everything that you're telling\nme is like reinforcing my idea that you\njust have a lot inside you that you just\ndon't understand hmm\nthis whole business with the Navy this\nwhole business of like so when you\nmeditate I want you to think about this\nright now youyou are keeping a lot of\nstuff down with pressure in your mind\nyour mind is working it's\nsauce ting being you right I feel like\nit it's like so much work to just sit\nanywhere for any amount of time doing\nanything the only relief that you get is\nthrough distraction but even keeping\nthose negative feelings down is like\nit's like you're pushing and pushing and\npushing and all meditation is is it's\ntaking the pressure off so whatever is\ndown there it comes up so when I\nmeditate with people with a history of\nPTSD I'm very careful with how I\nmeditate with them because if you just\nempty their mind it's like a vacuum and\nall the trauma comes rushing out in your\ncase you literally cannot sit still and\nyou feel physically uncomfortable\nbecause those emotions are coming\nrushing out those emotions come out any\nwhich way you can call it body\ndysmorphia you can call it shame you\ncould call it playing excessive video\ngames this whole thing about taking\npictures of yourself uploading it to\nInstagram it's all one [ __ ] thing man\nand you've got to like dig into that\nsomehow I mean I think therapy is a good\nway to do it if you want to try to\nmeditate we can try that cancer one more\nthing\nyep photo how that's happening huh\nthings just get up now for an hour you\ndon't have an answer now it's like oh\nwhat about this good keep going yeah do\nyou think like I don't want to call it\nsome sort of like physical trauma can\nhave anything to do with it you haven't\nit's nothing pretty recently like you've\nbeen saying like how all this stuff go\nway back you know I'm just like\nwondering if something I don't know if\nI'll call it traumatic something kind of\ntraumatic happened recently like how\neasily last year did your body\nbe a peek before this happened no good\npiece after it happened\nmm-hmm\ndo you feel comfortable sharing what\nhappened sure if I don't have to go into\ndetail sure or you don't have to share\nanything I can just comment on what I\nthink without that but I'd love to hear\nyou think it'll help if I share because\nI can share but well so I tend to do\nbest when people give me raw data hmm\nbut I can try to give you a theoretical\nanswer which may or may not help but so\nwhat I'm so like what we're talking\nabout is some kind of flip right like\nand I don't know where that flip is but\nthat flip could have been recent so the\npoint here is that Lane and sometimes\nphysical trauma can do that so like\nthere was something that was the way\nthat I want you to think about this is\nlike you had a you had a predisposition\nor a risk factor for body dysmorphia for\nmaybe a long time but generally when we\nthink about mental illness and\ndiagnosing someone it's usually\nsomething that catalyzes that change so\nsomeone have always been like a little\nbit depressed but then when they went\nthrough the divorce is when like the\ndepression really hits them but you can\nkind of see the signs and risk factors\nin the the cracks that the divorce that\nthe depression kind of like breaks\nthrough like you can see the cracks\nstart to form the weaknesses start to\nform early on and then oftentimes it is\nan event that sort of like really like\nlays people oh yeah and when you say\npeak like I'm assuming that that that\nthat sort of you know that curve started\na long time ago but absolutely you can\nkind of be going like this and then go\nlike this hmm so and we see that like a\nlot of times like you know mental\nillness gets more severe under a\nparticular stressor but all of the\nfoundation of it was there before if\nthat makes sense\nso I do think that a physical trauma\ncould have a lot to do with it now the\nthing that's confusing to me about\nphysical trauma is that I'm getting a\nsense of Worth and value and sense of\nself and hatred and shame about you\nwhich I'm surprised to hear relate to\nphysical trauma unless the physical\ntrauma was like malevolent in some way\nlike if someone got into a car accident\nI would be really surprised to see this\nkind of manifestation I don't I don't\nthink I should call it physical trauma\nactually it wasn't Mormon people but\nyeah abso-fucking-lutely yeah it wasn't\nit it wasn't like a car crash or\nanything yeah so if if it was a physical\nI look you can say what you want to or\nnot say what you don't want to but I'm\njust saying I would be surprised if it\nwas purely a physical trauma seems like\nit's not really a physical trauma no I\nrealize now it wasn't I just I thought\nthat was the way to describe it but it's\nokay sure do you want to tell us what\nhappened so me and my boyfriend was at a\nparty and and we were a party with one\nof his friends and we all got very drunk\nlike I never been so drunk in my life\nand my boyfriend passed out on because\nwe were sleeping there we passed out on\nthe bed and I just I joined him because\nI didn't want to be alone in like I\ndidn't want to be in the party without\nhim and I I just laid down and I like I\ngot undressed in a way down and then\nand he's my boyfriend's friend came in\nthe one who was hosting the party and he\nstarted touching me\nyeah I think that could be related\nhave you told anyone that before\nI'll just move away\nwhen you think about that what do you\nwhat are you feeling now\nI\nI sometimes think that I should be happy\nhmm\nbecause like he found you desirable but\nI didn't want to drop him\nyou said you sometimes think you should\nbe happy but how do you feel about that\nany of it because when I ask you how you\nfeel your answer is I should dot dot dot\nbut I feel girls about it I feel like I\nfeel disgusting about it yeah and I did\nthe day after slope because I woke up\nand like fill up and say click in my\nstomach when you put on a dress\ndoes any of that feeling come up\nmaybe I haven't really noticed it a\nlittle bit\nand good I'm really sorry that that\nhappened to you it sounds awful\nand sorry for laughing in a moment like\nthis but sometimes that's the word I\ndeal with negative emotions didn't feel\nbut yeah I think that could be related\nmy friend right I mean we can talk about\nfoundations and that sort of makes sense\nlike you know earlier when I started\noffering answers and we noticed that\nsomething was missing and now I think\nyou've given us a lot to help us\nunderstand like I mean I didn't even\nknow how to put all this together but it\nsure is how every one of those things\nthat you shared with me feels very\nsignificant mm-hmm I think it's really\nhard once again I can't believe I\nsometimes I forget we're on twitch oh\nI'm sorry I brought it up because like\nthat what are you sorry about because\nwe've been going for so long now and I\ndon't bring that up then actually really\nshort so yeah but that's okay I think I\nthink the reason that you so ingred\nthings happen at their time in in their\nplace and part of what we have to do is\nlike let go of some expectations of how\nand when things are supposed to happen\nin my sense is that you just needed some\ntime to kind of let this stuff out\nvery smiling I'm just hopeful for you no\nit's good I know may seem weird but I\nthink that you know if you're able to\ntalk about it here and reach out for\nhelp and and I think that I'm hopeful\nfor people where I can see a problem and\nlike this is absolutely a problem in\nEurope like if you feel the way that you\nfeel about yourself and something like\nthis happened then you know I think that\nthat gives me hope in a weird way\nbecause what what gives me no hope is\nlike when we don't understand where the\nproblem comes from but I think in your\ncase there's all this like little stuff\nthat was kind of building up and then\nthere's like this feeling of being like\ndirty right hmm of being disgusting and\nand sometimes things happen to us that\nmake us make us feel though that way but\nI'm hopeful that with the same courage\nthat you displayed today cuz like I'm\nbasing this on you yeah which is that at\nthe end of the day I think you're\nincredibly courageous and I think you're\nincredibly intelligent I think you're\nawesome got some pretty sweet lights in\nyour PC and and I think that you know\nyou've got a lot of stuff that seems\nunrelated but I think at the end of the\nday you really only got like a couple of\nthings holding you back\nand the reason I'm hopeful is because I\nthink you've started to take huge\nstrides in those directions today and at\nthe top of the list is is like\nunderstanding what you feel right\nbecause here we are I'm asking you\nquestions for like and out and I don't\nmean to keep on beating you up about\nthis but listen I just tend to be a dick\nyou could tell me to go [ __ ] yourself\nremember well that'll do that one day\nangry one day you'll have the courage\nbut I was saying going to you'll have\nthe courage to tell me to go [ __ ] myself\nbut but because I think you you have\nbeen incredibly courageous today and you\nfaced a lot of feelings and I think it's\nhard to know what you feel because\nyou're not used to feeling it it's like\nnew territory for you so I taught my\nwife I had her play if you heard of this\ngame called deep rock galactic mm-hmm so\nlike I had her played deep rock galactic\nfor the first time a few days ago and I\nrealized she's never played an FPS oh\nand then I realized like how\ndisorienting it is to play an FPS for\nthe first time she's played games like\nMario and like Mario Kart yeah there was\nlike two different and like I just take\nit for granted that I know how to\ncontrol an FPS but actually it's really\nreally bizarre to have like character\nmovement that's half keyboard and a half\nMouse like that's just strange hmm you\nknow and and so like the in your case I\nthink this is like your first I mean\nmaybe not first but you're new at this\nlike you just don't know how these\ncontrols work yet in terms of feeling\nwhat you feel understanding your\nemotions tying things together putting\nwords to how you feel you're new at that\nsystem of control and so just give\nyourself some time and hopefully you'll\nfind a decent therapist who's not an\n[ __ ] and pushes you out the door\nafter five minutes and and you know be\npatient with them and let them be\npatient with you because I think if the\nonly thing that you needed for me is\nlike not my brilliance that doesn't\nactually help by the way but yeah well\nall you all you've really needed a space\nand you're gonna I mean you're a capable\nof doing the work on your own you just\nneed space and if you can find it I\nthink you're gonna start to feel better\nabout yourself\nand I really hope so because if I didn't\nif I couldn't have hope for you then I\ncouldn't do my job like I couldn't do\nthis next yeah how are you feeling now\nprobably relieved yeah takes a while to\nget there I don't know why I said\nlighting from five thousand people I\nthink you said because you needed to say\nit and it needed to come out yeah yes\nand I think you need to talk more about\nit maybe not in front of 5,000 people\nyou know four thousand next time\n[Laughter]\nbut seriously fine find a space to talk\nabout I'm dead serious about that in\ngrid like you know you don't need to be\ncarrying that around all by yourself\nit's not fair to you and you don't\ndeserve it and you're not burdening\nanyone by doing that talk about it with\nmy boyfriend oh sure\nso I think that's good but also your\nboyfriend is gonna support you in some\nways and not be able to support you in\nother ways too hmm I mean it's it sounds\nlike you have a really good boyfriend\ny'all have a good relationship yeah he's\ngreat that sounds like it sounds like\nhe's a real keeper\nyeah and and so I think you owe it to\nyourself and you owe it to him and you\nowe it to the your relationship to try\nto help yourself\nget through some of this stuff so that\nyou guys can do what you guys are\nactually supposed to do we'll just be\nhappy together hmm\nand no meditation write it we don't have\nto suit though I think we've done enough\nI think we add do anything else so\nthanks a lot for coming on thanks for\nhaving me\nyou're very welcome any last thoughts or\nquestions and you asked a bomb's you\nwant to drop on this before we check out\nthink that's all Ingrid seriously I wish\nyou all the best and I'm really hopeful\nfor you and you know you deserve you\ndeserve to feel better and you deserve\nto not have to carry this [ __ ] around\nanymore\nthank you so deuce\nabout that okay that's right all right\ntake care kid but okay now I'm confused\noh [ __ ] all right well hmm give me a\nsecond\nchat dr. K on boomer on boomer boys and\ngirls fixed saved etc oh man yeah so I\ndon't know if you guys know this but you\ncould teach an old boomer new tricks you\ncan unleash the plebs yeah that was a\nraid boss whoo anyway so we are you know\nwe started late but we're also over time\nI've got to run so I don't think we're\ngonna have time for Q&A or anything else\ndude the raid boss is getting the\nscreams this launched like that's the\nraid boss see like the problem with like\nare screams that like it's not it's not\nlike you could clear a bunch of trash\nmobs and then then it's the it's the\nraid boss it's like the raid boss is at\nthe very beginning with when the stream\nactually launches or not and then it's\nlike yeah so listen guys thank you guys\nvery much I think I've got a I just want\nto share a couple of things which we\ndidn't really get around to so first of\nall you know I hope that was hopeful for\nyou guys and I think that oh yeah it's\nso weird I think the most important\nthing was thing was actually recognizing\nthat nothing we were saying was actually\nhelping like\nit's really the turning point of that\ninterview for me isn't kind of\nacknowledging that you could come up\nwith it however many theories you want\nto and all this other [ __ ] and believe\nyou know everything in them like if it\ndoesn't fit like you gotta trust the\nperson that you're talking to and what I\nwant you guys to do is like trust\nyourself right because like Ingrid in\nthat moment like you have to trust\nyourself that these guys don't know what\nthey're [ __ ] talking about because we\ndon't know what the [ __ ] I'm talking\nabout because we don't have the whole\nstory\nand that's not her fault necessarily\nbecause you know it's just trust in\nyourself and trust in the way that you\nfeel and if people you know if you feel\nsomething about yourself then then oddly\nenough even if it's depression or\nsomething like that even if it's\nnegative if you're suicidal or you know\nwhatever like you can have feelings and\ntrust in those feelings doesn't mean you\nhave to act on them in fact you\nshouldn't especially if you're I think\nyou might hurt yourself but like\nunderstand that that's coming from a\nvery authentic place and that you have\nto like accept that and recognize that\nthat pain is real what the pain\ntranslates to in your mind is not real\nbut the pain itself is real right that\nfeeling of like and I hope you guys\ncaught this when I was sort of saying\nthat she has like this belief about\nherself that like the low thing like if\nyou go back I don't know maybe like 40\nor 45 minutes ago or an hour ago like\nwhat we were getting from her is a sense\nof like self loathing and that\nabsolutely comes after a sexual assault\nwhich is what happened to her right like\nthat sort of makes sense if we were\nsniffing it but we just don't know where\nit comes from and so if you have\nsomething that you feel about yourself\nrecognize that that comes from a place\ntoo but then like that doesn't have to\nown you right that doesn't have to be\nfact it doesn't have to be true you can\nyou can like let go of that but you have\nto figure out where it comes from and\nthen like heal that so anyway I really\nhope that she does okay and she gets\nsome decent help so a couple of things\njust to let you guys know so first of\nall thank you very much for all of the\nsupport and then we're gonna have\nactually a good friend of mine this guy\nnamed will sue who is an expert in\npsychic\nlet's seize a psychiatrist and he's\ngonna be on on Friday to talk about\npsychedelics because I know that we've\ngot a lot of interest in that he's part\nof the psychedelic support network also\nyou know don't crucify him for this but\nit is also on TV and some Netflix things\nand and a couple of things like that so\nhe's a great big proponent of the use of\npsychedelics medically and non-medically\nso hopefully he'll be on and we'll talk\na little bit about that I think he's\nalso offered to I think do a Q&A on our\ndiscord maybe after the stream so we may\ntry to set that up for Friday and Friday\nis gonna kick off we're doing a whole\nthing for Mental Health Awareness Month\nso may is mental health awareness month\nso starting on Friday we're going to\ntalk to will and we're also gonna be\ndoing some fundraising for our coaching\nprograms so we'd like to help people\nlike Ingrid and other people who have\nbad experiences with psychiatrists where\nwe can't treat medical problems but we\ncan definitely you know try to support\npeople teach them how to meditate help\nthem understand Vedic psychology things\nlike that help them understand their ego\nand so we're gonna be doing some\nfundraising with some various goals\nalong the way and yeah so like for\nexample if we're hitting our goal I\nthink we're gonna try to raise $75,000\nmaybe and if we hit that you know we're\ngonna have various goals and you guys\ncan decide like what we do so options\nfor like stretch goals include me I hope\nI can say this can I say this hold on\nlet me figure this out and I talked\nabout\n[Music]\nokay so yeah so like it involves gaming\nstreams but then also tears again so\nthis gaming stream there's gaming stream\nwith dr. K being hopeful and positive\nand then there's also gaming stream with\nme doing an Indian accent and trolling\npeople and then there's also a gaming\nstream with me being doing an Indian\naccent and and being toxic as all hell\nand using my powers to destroy people's\nlike psyches instead of rebuilding them\nand so we'll just see like how toxin can\nwe get let that inner troll all the way\nout and so we may also do like some like\nsome cue it like marathon kind of\nstreams with like QA and stuff like that\nwe're still trying to sort out exactly\nwhat our what our various donation\nbenchmarks are and then you know if we\nhit our end goal maybe that should be\nthe end goal I don't know you guys\ndecide what the end goal is but other\noptions are gonna be like content that's\ndetermined by the community so you guys\ngive me a topic and I'll produce a\nseries of webinars or YouTube lectures\nor whatever like on whatever you guys\nwant if that's dating and talking to\nwomen that's fine if it's like\nunderstanding procrastination better\nthat's fine if it's understanding trauma\nor like meditation you guys pick the\ntopics and I'll do it\nand yeah so we're gonna start so this is\ngonna be for the month of May for mental\nhealth awareness month yeah and so we\nhave a highlights channel too for those\nof you guys so that's gonna be a long\ninterview people have said that they\nwant the whole damn thing so fine so\nthat's gonna be like a two-hour upload\nto YouTube but we have a second channel\nwhere we try to clip some of the more\npiecemeal chunks and yeah so that's\nthat's what we're gonna be shooting for\nso all throughout the month of May I\nthink we're gonna do a lot of cool stuff\non stream and that's what we're shooting\nfor and I think we're gonna rave so\nwe're gonna do oh yeah so so oh god\ncosplay you've got to be kidding me\nMoses\nso give ideas and discord about what you\nwant is what I've been told and we're\ngonna raid let's raid Mitch you guys got\nto be kidding if I talked to a person\nwith BPD yet yeah buddy I've talked to\nseveral of them I just don't know if\nthey actually have BPD but take care\nguys we'll see y'all hopefully on\nWednesday and hopefully on time with\nlike my Nvidia drivers working that's\nwhat I get for trying to update my\ndrivers Fogg take care\n[Music]"
