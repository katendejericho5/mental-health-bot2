    "transcript": "in fact what you tell me is there's a\ndifferent thought machine that's kind of\nlike saying like oh this is awesome like\nyou did a great job even though like\nit's kind of a small impact\nit feels fulfilling and right to you and\nthere are other times where on some\nobjective criteria in theory you're\nhaving a bigger impact but it feels like\nyou're kind of a fraud yeah right so for\nyou to feel like you're a fraud must\nmean that you believe something about\nyourself\nsay say goodbye to chat I've never\nclosed chat for a stream before that's\nweird\nyeah um what's weird about it it feels\nlike I'm not live well perfect yeah but\nlet's just let's just trick your brain\ninto thinking about thousands of people\non the internet or not watching this for\nsure good start so it's okay if I call\nyou Maya yeah I was just saying that\nthis is actually really fun for me\nbecause I actually know what to call\nsomeone yeah I just changed my name on\nswitch to Maya\nprior to that it was my ego which is my\nname okay yeah he go what is he what is\nit's Japanese\nmy-my dad's Okinawan okay cool and so\nwhat are we talking about today Maya um\nit was difficult for me to come up with\nI come up with that what but I guess\ngeneral anxiety my chat said that I\nshould talk about overthinking because I\ndo that a lot and then I have trouble in\nI guess like internalizing my success\nbecause a lot of I share a lot of my\nviewership with my boyfriend who you\ntalk to miss Kay there Matt oh yeah says\nthe sky doing he's good he's good and\nwell actually he's playing a game right\nnow that makes him not so good but I\nthink miss Gibbs is fantastic man I like\nhim so much I think so too\num yeah so a lot of my growth on Twitch\nhappened after I after I met and started\ndating him so sometimes I have trouble\nlike owning my success and not thinking\nthat it's just solely attributed to his\nyeah hmm interesting\nyeah it's a it's kind of a long story I\nhaven't been on twitch all that long\nit's been just over a year okay but so\ncan you tell us the story yeah sure I'll\ntry to make it digestible um I started\nwhen a nice in like February or\nsomething like that and I was maxing out\nit like a couple hundred viewers and\nthen one day I brought my Hawk out on\nstream and a clip of that got put on LSF\nso clips of me started getting put on\nLSF why she feels um\nblowing up whatever and then Matt found\nme off of those clips and called me on\nstream we started talking that way and\nthen several months later\nMiska sorry ah um and then several\nseveral months later we started dating\nbut my channel blew up after talking to\nMatt and Hydra LSF okay and and so you\nfeel like your success on twitch is it\nis attributed to miss get there Matt\npartially yeah yeah like big partially\nhow do you feel about that um I don't\nknow I mean sometimes it doesn't bother\nme it doesn't matter because I still\nlike what I'm doing with the platform\nand I'm proud of it but it also makes my\nachievements when I think about it feel\nless satisfying I guess like what's\nfulfilling hi guys so you're kind of\nthinking like if you had done it on your\nown it would mean more right and and\nhelp me understand what what you mean by\nachievements um I do a conservation\npodcast on my channel every week and\nI've done solidarity yeah happy Earth\nDay chat I'm sorry I didn't say that um\nyeah Earth Day but I do\nconservation podcast every week and we\nraise money I talked to a\nconservationist psychologists biologists\nspecial whatever about conservation\nresearch and about usually a particular\nspecies and we raise money for an\norganization of their choosing through\nthe podcast alone or I think it's 26\nepisodes we've raised nearly 30 K around\nand then through my streaming career\nit's been well over 50 K I did a lot of\ncharity wow so yeah that's very cool\nyeah and and how do you feel about doing\nthat it's the most important thing that\nI've done in my life is is the podcast\nand being like a powerful force in\nconservation education and being able to\nteach more people because before I\nstarted streaming I had been working at\na zoo for several years doing\nconservation education so like bringing\nanimal ambassadors out and teaching kids\nand bringing them to birthday parties\nand stuff like that and that's been my\nthing in my dream forever so twitch kind\nof just gave me a platform to do that on\na larger scale yeah my kids love that\nstuff yeah like a fair and there's like\na dude there with animals mm-hmm yes and\nand the interesting thing is that my\nolder one they like different animals so\nmy older one is terrified of all of the\nanimals that my younger one really likes\nyeah you would think so but it doesn't\nthe younger one is oblivious that you\nknow the older one is scared of large\nanimals and snakes and crocodiles and\nalligators and the younger one wants to\nprevent all of them and we have to\nexplain to her sometimes I'll tell her\nstories about you know friendly\nalligators and then we actually had an\nalligator in our backyard oh yeah shoot\nso we have to explain to her that you\ncan't actually like to go up to the\nwater and pet the alligator it is it's a\nfine line with having people fall in\nlove with animals and necessarily their\nfriends have you seen Tiger King I have\nany thoughts about that can I ask you\nabout that or\nyeah I absolutely despise the entire\nseries the only reason that I watched it\nis because I felt the responses or the\nobligation to be able to comment on it\nbut it's the good thing about the series\nis that it exposes a lot of the really\nreally terrible stuff that happens in\nthe exotic animal industry for in the\nfor-profit exotic animal industry and\nthe exploitation that that comes with\ncub petting and animal interactions and\nespecially with big cats so I think that\nthe best thing that came out of that\nseries is everyone who watched it I\nthink would now be uncomfortable going\nto a facility and doing like cub petting\nyou know and that's huge cuz that's\nthat's been going on forever and there\nare a lot of animals that aren't going\nto suffer anymore because of the series\nbut it was really frustrating to watch\nfirst we rust rating to watch about it\nthe animal husbandry\nin the series the I mean the dynamics\nbetween the people from you know a\nnormal person perspective or pretty wild\njust the the lack of care for the\nanimals in the amount of care for the\nfor the profit and for the power\nthere's frustrating yeah you see that a\nlot in in exotics when you have\nsomething that people aren't supposed to\nhave you know or that most people don't\nhave so interesting okay yeah so you\nknow I've just been listening for you're\noverthinking the course of this Congress\nsay I haven't seen it yeah well that I\nguess that's good okay you're fine and\noverthinking for me at this point in my\nlife is pretty much only about streaming\nstuff I think so help me understand what\nyou mean by overthinking or what you're\nbecause we're taking advice from chat\nnowadays what your what your chat feels\nabout you ever thinking I'm trying to\nthink of an example\na while ago I set a goal incentive for a\nsponsored stream well this happened a\ncouple times um yeah no so I sent a goal\nincentive to add an emote and I don't\nknow if you're familiar with like haha\nemotes but like it's a so an email like\nof my face\nthat is like cringing and you're\nsupposed to use it when something or\nsomeone says something that's not funny\nbut that kind of emote lens to talk the\ncity in chat cuz it's like you're\ntelling someone that they're not funny\nand I said that I would add that emote\nas a goal incentive for a certain amount\nof downloads I think this is right I\nthink that's why I did that on a\nsponsored stream and what is a download\nit was more like I know what download is\nbut I may be getting this confused I'm\nsure it was an incentive for something I\nthink it was for raid shot of Legends\nand like the sponsor is they want you to\nget a certain amount of downloads for\nthis free game you got it um and so you\nkeep track of how many of your viewers\nhave downloaded it and I think that's\nall okay better um it wasn't incentive\nfor sure and I got I freaked out after\ndoing it because I was like wait are\npeople like do people think that I'm\njust like a sellout or that I'm that I\ndon't care about like enabling toxicity\nor are people starting to think that\nlike I'm not a good person because of\nthat emote and I freaked out and then I\ndeleted the emote and then chat freaked\nout and they got really mad cuz they're\nlike you scammed this so then I added it\nback shrim\nyeah that's an example of overthinking I\nthink yeah I think I was overthinking\nwhen I like snow balled I guess from\nso that is to me sorry when I snowballed\nfrom like I added this emote to shoot\nlike people think that I'm a bad person\nokay so emote enabling toxicity uh-huh\nI'm a bad person\nOh No\nso the first thing is let's let's kind\nof understand what's happening in your\nmind there oh okay so let's try to\nunderstand what's happening in your mind\nthere first so you say over thinking\nwhat I'm gonna toss back at you is that\nthere may be a particular so I want you\nto envision your mind as having\ndifferent centers of what I let's call\nthem thought producers so you'll have\nlike some part of your mind let's talk\nabout the internalizing growth for a\nsecond right so you have one part of\nyour mind that produces thoughts like\nyeah you know like at the end of the day\nsure miss gif gave you a bump but people\nwouldn't watch your stream if they\ndidn't like your content right so like\nsure you got exposure through miss gif\nbut I don't think that I mean just based\non my understanding of twitch you know\nour channel got huge bumps from a lot of\ndifferent places and at the top of the\nlist is probably our stream with reckful\nand and so I'm grateful for that and I\nthink that that's like a big part of our\ngrowth and at the same time I still\nthere's a part of me that says that like\nsure we got like a gigantic bump from\nthat I mean we went from probably like\n150 to like 10,000 in in terms of like\nbefore and you know during the reckful\nstream and things like that and so\ncertainly there's there there bumps that\nhappen but one of the things that I've\ncome to understand about twitch is that\ngenerally speaking you know sure you can\nget a bump because of a particular\ninteraction but people usually watch the\nstreams that they enjoy right like I\ndon't think anyone watches stream I mean\nmaybe people do but I generally speaking\nlike I know when I watch a twitch stream\ni watch a Twitter stream because I enjoy\nwatching a twitch stream I don't do it\nyou know like and I find certain\nstreamers in certain ways but once I\nfind a streamer if I like a streamer I\nwatch the stream so let's say that\nthere's a part of you that sort of\nunderstand\nthat produces thoughts right like that\nsays that okay am i you've actually\naccomplished a lot and and you're you\nknow a good person and you're doing a\nlot for the world and you're expanding\nyour conservation work and so be it then\nthere's another part of your mind that\nproduces other kinds of thoughts right\nand this is the kind of with a part of\nyour mind that says ohm like maybe\nyou're an impostor like you wouldn't be\nwhat you are without him and this and\nthat like do you see how like those two\n[ __ ] it's not like each of these\nthoughts is independent you have like\ntwo like thought producing machines\nthey're like bobble machines yeah I'm\nkids so bubble machines are very common\nand and so you know they just kind of\nlike these things in some days like one\nthought machine is like more active than\nanother thought machine does that make\nsense yeah like you wake up on one day\nand you're like oh I'm a [ __ ]\nimpostor today and on another day it's\nlike oh like I you know I'm I'm like\ntrying to make the world a better place\nand that's awesome so the first thing is\nwhen you talk about overthinking I don't\nknow that it's it's so much that you're\nthinking too much\nit's I get the sense that on some days\nyou think from the wrong place right so\nlet's try to understand how that is\nbecause then maybe we can get a control\nover overthinking we don't I don't think\nthat thinking too much is a problem like\nif you're thinking about you know\nconservation work or how to make the\nmost of your presence on Twitch or\nthings like that\nwe definitely want you to think as many\nthoughts as you can on that so the first\nthing is I have an issue with the word\noverthinking because I think it's a\nlittle bit of a misdiagnosis of you know\nnot acknowledging it's not like your\nthinking is too high or too low it's\nlike there are different kinds of\nthinking and one source of your thinking\nis kind of problematic so let's start by\nunderstanding where that thought machine\ncomes from and what it looks like\nso when you started when you had the\nidea for the emote can you walk me\nthrough like how you decided to do that\nemote is kind of the prize for a\nparticular goal it had been created and\nI rejected it immediately when it was\ncreated because I didn't want it why\ndidn't you want\nwell one cuz it's a picture of my face\nthat I don't particularly like okay so\nwhen you say a picture of your face that\nyou don't particularly like help me\nunderstand that what I'm making like a\nweird expression and kind of weird to\nhave face emotes in chat what what when\nyou see a picture of your face with a\nweird expression how does that make you\nfeel embarrass I guess okay what are you\nembarrassed by that people are gonna see\nit and think that I look weird okay so\npeople think that I look weird what do\nyou mean by weird I'm not sure okay\nhave you felt like you look weird in the\npast not particularly okay do you\nremember being concerned about your\nappearance when you were growing up for\nsure yeah I don't think more so than an\naverage\nyoung girl I'm saying yeah I'm like\nmiddle school I was super awkward short\nbut weirdly lanky I had a unibrow\nstringy hair all that um I started\nworrying more about my appearance at the\nbeginning of high school when I started\nlearning how to use makeup I guess is\nwhere I started and other girls started\nlike to me getting prettier and I felt\nlike I was behind the curve\nso yeah when what do you remember what\nkind of thoughts you had um I thought\nthat makeup made them look really\ndifferent in a good way and I thought\nthat makeup either didn't make me look\ndifferent enough or I wasn't good enough\nat doing it or it made me look different\na bad way\nso I think why can't I do makeup to make\nme look better like they can umm why did\nyou need to look better to catch up I\nthink behind the curve is [ __ ]\ndevastating yeah so just to kind of tie\nthings together behind the curve is a\nthought machine okay what do you think\nabout that sounds toxic does that make\nsense at all like would because it's\nkind of a vague statement I'm making I'm\nlike you know does know it does help me\nunderstand what you help me understand\nwhat you understand when I say behind\nthe curve is a thought machine that if\nthat that thinking can lend itself to a\nlot like a variety of situations\nabsolutely for me like academically\nessentially sure right so so let's just\nthink about this for a second so do you\nfeel like you're behind the curve on\nTwitch a little bit not in terms of like\nmy viewership or my rate of growth but\nthere's a lot that I don't understand\nabout twitch just cuz I haven't been\naround as long as other people a lot of\ntwitch history that I don't know a lot\nof intricacies of streaming that I don't\nunderstand just because I haven't had\nenough experience yeah\nso that doesn't sound to me like that's\na behind the curve thought that sounds\nto me like someone who recognizes that\nthat they've been doing this for about a\nyear and they have a lot to learn\nthat doesn't mean you're behind the\ncurve that just means you're one year\ninto the car does that make sense\nright yep yeah do you see the difference\nthere yeah like do you feel bad when you\nsay I have a lot to learn about twitch\nno okay so now let's talk about\ninternalizing growth for a second do you\nfeel like mischief is sort of the make\nthat makes you look better than you\ntruly are is that sometimes how you feel\nabout it I'm having a hard time like\nputting those things together okay so\nmaybe they're not connected let me put\nit another way I'm noticing something\nthat you have a sense of your worth that\nsometimes is low and that you have an\nidea that you can do certain things to\nartificially elevate your sense of worth\nso let's say makeup is one example right\nnow we're not saying that you're\ndifferent for most people I mean most\npeople are like this okay that's how we\ncan talk about this because these are\npatterns that exist with like basically\neveryone I've ever talked to\nand and so I'm kind of thinking if we\ntake this idea that like my is not good\nenough and then unless she can like do\nsomething external that makes her good\nenough or makes her appear to be good\nenough I think makeup falls into that\nand I'm wondering whether miss gifs bump\non your stream also sort of qualifies\nunder that framework of oh you couldn't\nmake it yourself but he's basically the\nthing that elevates you beyond where you\nnormally belong and so the success is\nnot yours yeah I don't know if it's so\nclosely tied to music if as it is like\nthe bump in viewership and you're like\ngeneral like numbers I have on twitch\nnow like the numbers make me look like\nI'm a better streamer than I am look\nlike a better stream of beautiful that's\nexactly what I'm talking about right\nwhere do you get the idea of what your\ntrue like that implies that there's like\na false streamer quality in a true\nstreamer quality right like oh my\nnumbers are better than what I deserve\nso where do you get the idea of like\nwhat your gold standard is how do you\ndetermine what you deserve how do you\ndetermine what's right because it's\ninflated yeah so where do you get the\nidea of like what's true north\nmaybe it's because I haven't been on\nTwitch that long or because my my like\nlife purpose or my life goal for years\nhas been to be a force in conservation\nand before when I was working at the zoo\nI was completely and fully satisfied\ndoing a presentation for like 30 people\na class of 30 people or like a crowd of\nmax a hundred people you know I was like\nthat's huge and I would go home and feel\nreally good about it and think like I\njust inspired this many people today and\nthat's a big deal for me um I think it's\nunfathomable to imagine a thousand two\nthousand three thousand people watching\nme and me having the same effect on that\nmany people so I maybe feel like there's\nsomething not wrong but like there's no\nway that I can influence this many\npeople just because I'm like good at\nwhat I'm doing I like because I'm a good\nstream like there must be something that\nthey're missing or that like I'm like\nthey're like being tricked into thinking\nI'm some expert that I'm not or that I\nlike deserve this like platform and I\ndon't I don't know that makes sense yes\nsort of okay so I'd like to ask you a\nfew questions about that if that's okay\nsure so the first thing is I'm hearing a\ncommon theme of like you deserve\nsomething and you get more than you\ndeserve\nyeah right so let me so I think the the\nmain question is like where do you get\nthe idea of what you deserve right so I\nthink that's a thought machine this idea\nthat like I don't deserve this or I'm\nnot good enough or I wouldn't be\nsomewhere because like you don't have\nintrinsic value and who you are and and\nthat's not like a it's not an all the\ntime thing and I think it's beautiful\nthat you gave the are the\nthe example of when you give a\nconservation lecture for 30 people\nbecause at that time the thought machine\nof I don't deserve this or I'm not a\ngood person or I'm not good enough is\nnot producing thoughts in fact what you\ntell me is there's a different thought\nmachine that's kind of like saying like\noh this is awesome like you did a great\njob even though like it's kind of a\nsmall impact\nit feels fulfilling and right to you and\nthere are other times where on some\nobjective criteria in theory you're\nhaving a bigger impact but it feels like\nyou're kind of a fraud Yeah right so for\nyou to feel like you're a fraud must\nmean that you believe something about\nyourself so like if I pretend to be a\ndoctor if I think I'm not a real doctor\nif I feel like I'm a fraud doctor even\nif I'm performing the duties of a doctor\nI have to have a belief that I'm not a\nreal doctor that comes from somewhere\nright so what I'm really curious about\nand I think if we really want to try to\nhelp you Maya it's to help you\nunderstand like where you get the idea\nthat you're a fraud we have to find out\nwhere that thought machine came from do\nyou have any idea I think that that's\nactually something that I've had for a\nlong time or like the idea of like I'm\nthe fraud thing even before before\nstreaming yeah I I grew up in a super\nsuper competitive School District now we\ngot in there and ventured academics\nearly earlier and behind the curve yeah\nwe had like we I mean we easily have one\nof the highest suicide rates in the\ncountry like not just at my high school\nbut a bunch of high schools in the area\nand I've always said I still say now\neven though I shouldn't that and I've\nsaid it on streem before to that I come\nacross as more intelligent than I am\nbecause I've been taught in school to\nlike be articulate or like I have been\ntaught to like come across as being\nintelligent but I'm not so my I want you\nto I'm gonna repeat back your statement\nokay I come across as more intelligent\nthan I am\nhelp me understand what you see in that\nstatement what do you mean what I see\nlike what like help quick so in I guess\nit's kind of read my mind question so in\nthat statement I see once again the\npresumption that you are one thing and\nthat you're a fraud do you see that like\nin that statement we see the same thing\nI'm not I'm smarter than I appear to be\nI'm not as good-looking as I appear with\nmakeup I'm not as successful of a\nstreamer as I would be unless I got the\nbumps from LSF or this or that\nlike it's sort of this idea of act\nintrinsic value and the way that the\nworld perceives you and the world\nperceives you like you're over here but\nyou feel like you're over here yeah and\nabsolutely that started way before you\nstarted streaming on twitch twitch is\njust one manifestation that activates\nthat thought machine do you see like\nthis is like a core part of you that\nfrequently whether it's academics\nwhether it's social stuff you feel\nbehind the curve you feel like you're\nnot that other people think you're\nsomething that you're not\nyes and can I ask you some questions I\nmean I know I mean I learned this lesson\nthe hard way where sometimes I would ask\npeople personal questions about whether\nthey grew up or where they are and you\nknow you don't do that on Twitch and\nthat's just because you know I usually\nsee people in the privacy of my office\nwhere no one is watching so they can\ngive me details about you know what\nstreet they grew up on but do you mind\nif I ask a couple of questions because\nyou mentioned that we have the highest\nsuicide rate I thought that was a weird\nthing and I'm really curious about that\ncan I ask I mean my my first move on\nTwitch was leaking my full name so so\ncan you tell me where you grew up\nyeah Silicon Valley okay California and\nI just laughing so and tell me a little\nbit about what growing up was like for\nyou that explains so much\noh yeah I work with a fair number of\npeople who are in Silicon Valley and\nalso have children of parents who are in\nSilicon Valley so growing up I grew up\non a small farm so I've always been\naround animals I was the only one out of\nfour I have three other siblings that\nwas really into animals my sister and I\nare super close in age or 18 months\napart she's older I'm 21 um she's far\nmore academically inclined than I am she\nwent to an Ivy she played soccer all\nthrough high school I also played soccer\nin high school who's older she is okay\nshe's older by 18 months and I played a\nbunch of sports\nI rode horses I've been riding horses\nall my life and I'm a senior at Cal Poly\nSan Luis Obispo but not in school right\nnow because of the virus okay what are\nyou studying agriculture agricultural\ncommunications that's my major hmm that\nsounds cool can you tell me a little bit\nabout that the idea of the major is to\ncrank out people that can work in the AG\nindustry that are capable of\ncommunicating messages to consumers\nbetter so marketers journalists\nenvironmental lawyers stuff like that\ninteresting so you mentioned that she\nwent to an Ivy mm-hmm how do you how do\nyou feel about that they're mixed\nfeelings for sure I mean absolutely\nproud she got recruited for d1 soccer as\nwell my sisters always been like a like\nbetter than you in a lot of ways shay\nyeah um but I was super proud that she\nwent to an Ivy shouldn't end up being\nall that happy there\nbut it was cool too\nto know that she got like when she got\nin it was like a really big deal and\nthat she was going for engineering she's\nalways want to do engineering so it was\nexciting\nit also was a little bit nerve-wracking\nbecause her going to an Ivy kind of set\nthe precedent that I would also I felt\nthat way to go to Cornell but where are\nyour other two siblings in terms of your\neight y'all's agency she's 23 22 23\nyou're 21 where where are they one of my\nbrothers they're half-brothers so\nthey're much older over there 33 and 29\nand so you said it set the bar for you\nand and how did you feel when that bar\nwas set do you remember\nwell I think I knew that it wasn't my\nlike whole life it was kind of like cuz\nshe's I mean she's 18 months older so\neverything that she did like I was next\nfor you know like going to high school\nthan making this soccer team she was\nlike always setting a bar this is so\ndepressing\nshe was always setting a bar that I knew\nlike I couldn't hit true so um would you\nsay that that's when he started to feel\nbehind the curve yeah okay so so how did\nit feel when she got into an IV cuz you\nsaid mixed feelings like obviously\nyou're proud you love your sister you\nrespect her a lot you want her to be\nhappy\nbut and\nkind of like a oh [ __ ] feeling what's\nway in that I'm gonna ask you to dig a\nlittle bit and if we can't get anywhere\nI'll offer you some hypotheses about\nwhat oh [ __ ] means yeah that I I've\nnever really been interested in\nattending an IV I wanted to go somewhere\nwhere I knew there was like a lot of\noutdoorsy stuff and where people were\nsuper relaxed and I might buy me my\nuniversity it's been perfect for that\nbut I didn't want to do like a hardcore\nacademics thing say I would just like\nheaven I've never been into it so it was\nkind of like a oh [ __ ]\num is this gonna make me feel worse\nabout not doing something as challenging\nas she's choosing to do I think and did\nit make you feel worse then if she\ndidn't know I mean so when so so you\nkind of said is this gonna make me feel\nokay so let me take a step back for a\nsecond so this is what I'm envisioning\nyou have an idea of who you are hmm\nyou actually do have an idea who you are\nright so we see leo Maya which is Maya\nwho knows she wants to like not be an\nengineer and go to a school where she\ncan be outdoors and be involved in the\nAG industry or animals or things like\nthat\nconservationist Maya Maya who works\nsummers and educates kids about animals\nand teaches them about conservation the\nMaya who raises money for charity on\nTwitch of all places this is real Maya\nthat Maya is one thought machine right\nit makes you happy with what you\naccomplish even if you're what you\naccomplish this quote-unquote small and\nthen there's also behind the curve Maya\nand what I'm hearing in oh [ __ ] is like\na conflict between real Maya and behind\nthe curve Maya so then you start to\nthink like oh like maybe I'm making a\nmistake like maybe I should do what she\ndoes is this good enough\nmy capable you said that you're not\ninterested in doing what she does but I\nwould hypothesize that you felt on some\nlevel that you're not capable and if you\nchose absolutely - yeah right I don't\nthink I am and and so how do you feel\nabout not being capable how does that\nfeel\nI mean I recognized that I'm capable of\na lot of things that my sister's not in\nbeing a communicator in public speaking\nand you know like being internet famous\nsure but like the feeling in high school\nlike all my friends I didn't have a\nsingle friend that didn't attend college\nand the vast majority of them went to\nthat are better or like more difficult\nto get in colleges and I did everyone\nhad a higher SAT AC T Square than I did\nand it always felt like I was like chat\nI mean we've already talked about this\nthat I was just like trying to like fake\nthat I was as smart as they were so in\nthinking that I'm not capable of going\nto an IV of being an engineer or\nwhatever it's just kind of like it feels\nlike me like exposing myself like saying\nlike yeah like you're you're at least\nbeing honest with yourself that you're\nnot well yeah I mean so when you say\nexposing so being honest with yourself\nsounds like a good thing exposing\nyourself\nsounds like a not good thing yeah right\nand and so what I'm hearing is that like\nthe gig is up but you've been revealed\nto be a fraud because you ended up at\nsome school that's not an IV and now the\nlike you know the cats out of the bag\nmy is actually kind of dumb is that how\nyou feel yeah I think that okay what is\nit like to hear me say that\ndoes it hurt\nI mean my first reaction was not really\nbut maybe a little bit I don't know okay\nso let's think about that like that's\nweird right like so I think if we think\nabout you know your emote this would be\nno this would have been a prime time to\nspam the emote in this channel because I\njust said something to you that seems\nlike it should be really hurtful right\nokay like I mean literally the sentence\nthat I the phrase that I used or close\nto it was like the cats out of the bag\noh my is dumb and isn't that what you're\nafraid of people saying I feel like\npeople already know but that doesn't\nmake sense\nthat doesn't matter you're damn right it\ndoes it let's do it right so what what's\nweird because like even though you feel\nlike people already know you don't want\nthem to say right you want to try to\nhide what you're afraid they already\nknow yeah so why is what happens why\ndoesn't it hurt when I bring it out into\nthe open I can't logically think of a\nreason for that yeah okay great answer\nno that's an accident why because it's\n[ __ ] confusing let me think about how\nto explain this so when people find out\nthat you're a fraud mm-hmm what do you\nenvision how do they react\n[Music]\nI don't know how to articulate it yeah\nbecause I don't think it's actually like\na vision right so look what are the\nfeelings like what like help me\nunderstand that like what are you afraid\nof them how do they make you feel or how\ndo you feel once they know let's start\nthere I've that I have some sort of like\nmalicious intent to like trick people or\nthat I've been lying I thought I'm like\nnot genuine mmhmm right yeah so I think\nwhat you're afraid of in terms of a\nnegative reaction is that right like\nit's not just them finding out it's the\njudgment that they place upon you after\nthey find out yes it's the way that they\nperceive you so now let me ask you a\nquestion is it the fraud that hurts or\nthe judgment that hurts\nabsolutely.thank right so just think\nabout that for a second right because\nlike if someone you know if and so I\nthink the reason that I mean maybe this\ndoes hurt you and you're not telling me\nor tricking me but you know I think the\nreason that you can hear those words for\nme is because I from me is because I\nactually don't judge you negatively at\nall so I'm saying the words without the\njudgement we're talking about you being\na fraud I see that you think you're a\nfraud and I don't believe you're a fraud\nat all so I think because you're an\nempathic person when you look at me I\ndon't I don't judge you for that in fact\nI think that yeah this is gonna sound\nweird how can I say this it's very clear\nto me that you're not a fraud the only\nthing that is like wrong about you is\nthat you think you're a fraud like you\nknow who you are and I think you're\namazing and the only issue is that like\nsometimes you think you should be\nsomething that you're not and not all\nthe time but there are two thought\nmachines one thought machine is like the\ngenuine Myo who does like real stuff I\nthink that person is awesome I think the\nonly problem that I have is that some\ntimes there's a part of your mind that\ntells you you should be someone else and\nthat's the part of you that makes you\nfeel dumb I don't think you're dumb\nfirst of all I don't know how many like\nactual score reports you saw for SAT\nscores or a CT scores but there's a\ndecent chance that not everyone did as\nwell as they they said they did right\nthere's also a decent chance that I\ndoubt that you actually had the lowest\nSAT score because statistically that's a\nvery very unlikely I think that's\nprobably a cognitive bias on your part\nin the same way that you had a cognitive\nbias that oh like makeup makes other\npeople look better but it makes me look\nout right yeah right so some something\nabout this how are you feeling right now\nby the way thank okay something about\nthis I think comes back to this core\nidea of like you're someone who's behind\nthe curve you're not as good as everyone\nelse and if it's a does that make sense\nabout actually before I go there does\nthat make sense why those words may not\nhurt you because I don't I say those\nwords but I don't have any judgment in\nfact I have a positive judgment with it\nwhich is probably why it's confusing for\nyou and you're picking up my positive\njudgment and you're hearing my negative\nwords and that doesn't fit right\nokay so let me ask you this like can you\ntell me a little bit more about like\ngrowing up sure what was it like growing\nup in your house pretty pretty good um\nI've always made my sister I've always\nbeen super close we did everything\ntogether a little my brother's because\nthey're older I mean I grew up with them\nbut they left for college when I was\nlike on the younger side so yeah it's a\nlittle different my parents both Silicon\nValley work full-time so we were we were\npretty much raised by babysitter's\nmostly one babysitter and then she she\njust like didn't pick us up one day so\nthen random teenage babysitters\nthroughout elementary school some in\nmiddle school and\n[Music]\nwhat's it like being raised by\nbabysitters fine I don't I don't feel\nlike I ever really had a problem with\nthat um I didn't realize until like high\nschool that it was weird that they like\nwe only called one of them mom\nbut I didn't realize until high school\nthat that was like strange like okay I'm\ngonna repeat back what I heard we only\ncalled one of the mom yes yes I yeah\nyeah but I didn't realize growing up\nthat that was abnormal sure what kind of\nwork did your parents do uh tech okay\nand do you remember what your so it\nsounds like you were raised by\nbabysitters do you understand what\nhappened when one of them didn't pick\nyou up like you said yeah yeah so she\nwas she was there I mean she was there\nthe day my sister was born so she's\nabsolutely there the day I was born\nand then she was with us until I was in\nthird grade or something okay second or\nthird grade every day\nand then she just she just didn't pick\nus up from school one day and I guess\nshe had some sort of nervous breakdown\num but I've I mean I've well I did talk\nto her about it once because I'm at some\npoint in high school she reached out to\nmy sister and like wanted to meet up\nwith us which was weird and then she\ntold us that she had a nervous breakdown\nbut I'm not really sure what the what\nthe reason was\nhmm what if she lost her husband at some\npoint in there so that was probably okay\nbig part of it hmm\nokay I'm just gonna think for a second\nis that okay yeah of course\nhow's this going so far by the way good\nokay you feel like you're learning any\nwhat are you learning\nI I don't usually think about the I\ndon't usually go that far back when I\nthink about anxiety or whatever so yeah\nit's interesting so I've been in therapy\nfor I've been seeing a therapist for\njust over two years and I've I do\nbelieve Dr for like almost a whole year\nand I did neurofeedback for a few months\nso we've talked about it in there yes\nI'm in a lot I am as why are you doing\nEMDR um I had I had like deep-rooted\ninsecurities in my former relationship\nthat I wanted to figure out so we did\nthe EMDR and focus a lot actually on\nthat babysitter and about like\nabandonment issues and stuff like that\nand then neurofeedback was for a\nseparate trauma that I was hoping to I\nwas hoping for memory recovery because I\nlost most of it but that's yeah that's\nwhat I haven't talked about it on streem\nside okay don't think you can steer\nclear of it yeah okay\nso I guess some things are starting to\nfit together a little bit more for me so\nhelp me understand a little bit about\nwhat your relationship with your parents\nwas like my parents are great\nmy dad doesn't talk a lot and he's not\nvery affectionate but he's first\ngeneration or he moved here when he was\n17 and he's always just been really\nreally quiet and then my mom is super\nloving and she loves animals and yeah\nwell we got along with and we butt heads\nin high school a lot but that's cuz I\nwas a teenage girl that's a lot like her\nnormal yeah and what when you say that\nyour dad wasn't very affectionate do you\nremember feeling like you wanted him to\nbe more affectionate no not he was\nwouldn't be and my sister were little\nand then when we got older was it but I\nnever thought of it as being anything\nbut normal\nit sounds like you feel pretty stronger\nlike your parents love you\nyeah it sounds like they're great yeah\ncan you in once again anything that you\ndon't want to talk about just let me\nknow what we're steering clear up can\nyou tell me what you mean by abandonment\nissues yeah I was so the reason that I\nstarted going to therapy was because I\nwas really insecure in my last\nrelationship like I always thought that\nhe was gonna leave or whatever so I went\nin to figure out why that was happening\nand we had a hard time figuring out and\ntalk therapy than my psychologist\nrecommended EMDR because she thought\nthat it was something deeper I went to\nEMDR we did a bunch of sessions and I\ndon't remember what the session was but\nwe had some breakthrough session where I\nlike started talking about that\nbabysitter and how like\nlike any when a parent figure or\nsomething leaves how like the kid feels\nlike it's their fault you know where the\nkid feels like they're not good enough\nor whatever what's your understanding of\nthat how does that work do you know like\na kid not understanding and thinking\nthat it's their fault that that person\nleft mm-hmm which I know logically isn't\nthe case but what do you mean logically\nisn't the case like I don't I don't\nthink that she left because she didn't\nlike me oh right because because my\nfault but yeah my kid brain you know\nlike my my therapist would say still\nthinks that that's that's a thing so\nthat tendency of thinking that someone's\ngonna leave because of me or someone's\njust gonna ditch me after I think that\nmy relationship with them is super\nsecure was leaking into my my current\nrelationship at the time and does that\ndoes that did that make sense to you did\nyou find that to be the case like was\nthat hypothesis kind of very helpful and\napplicable yeah and and after that\nsession it got a little bit better but\nit remains pretty pretty debilitating\nthroughout that relationship yeah once\nagain if you don't feel comfortable\nasking answering this just let me know\nbut I was gonna I was just curious is\nthat still pretty active for you and\nyour relationship with Miskin it's not\nwhich is really bizarre and I talked to\nmy therapist about that a decent amount\nnow I I took like I had a little over I\nhad about a year of being single and\ndoing that I at that point I had stopped\nthe EMDR and the neurofeedback but it\nused to be like debilitating like fear\nand I would be sad and what\nfor about him talking to other girls and\nand that kind of thing and I'm not sure\nif that like there's I mean there's\njealousy that comes up you know but I\ndon't think that it's abnormal sure for\nbetween me and Matt um and I'm not sure\nif that's because of the work that I've\ndone or because something's changed for\nme or if it's because of differences in\nMatt compared to my ex-boyfriend but\nit's pretty weird which is by me to try\nto explain what my understanding of that\nis sure yep so let's start with with\nyour kid brain okay so early on when\nchildren are young they lack something\ncalled theory of mind in theory of mind\nis the capacity to like put yourself in\nother people's minds and like understand\nthat they have thoughts and feelings and\nintentions okay so the simplest thing\nthe simplest reason why abandonment of a\nparent parental figure leads to a sense\nof you are like unlovable or there's\nsomething wrong with you is because a\nchild literally does not understand that\nthere are other agents in the world who\ncan do things right they're the only\nthing that exists because they don't\nunderstand that there are other like\nthinking breathing beings out there and\nso anything that happens to them is\ntheir fault because they're the only\ntheir all-powerful in the universe in\ntheir mind because they just don't\nunderstand that other people exist and\nthis changes drastically especially in\nyour teenagers so you start to develop\ntheory of mind you know around like\nmaybe I mean you develop it relatively\nearly but it becomes really really big\nwhen you become when you go through\npuberty and in puberty the reason that\nlike high school is so hard in middle\nschool is so hard is because this is\nliterally when your brain develops the\ncapacity to understand that other people\nhave like lasting opinions of you and\nthat like if I do something this person\nis gonna think this about me that\ncapacity like if you talk to a\nseven-year-old they don't understand\nthat right right they don't understand\nthat like if you go to someone's house\nand you break their thing that that\nperson is not gonna like you like all\nthey understand is that they're not\nsupposed to do it and they don't\nunderstand why they're like it's dumb\nlike I should be\n[ __ ] I want right and when you become a\nteenager you start to realize oh like\ntheory of mind is actually thing and\npeople think things about me and that's\nreally terrifying because now you have\nto like balance all of these hundreds of\npeople that you know and what they think\nabout you so as for why your current\nrelationship and I'm not surprised at\nall that it's better and that's because\nI think you figured out the thought\nmachine so you discovered through EMDR\nyou figured out oh there's a thought\nmachine that that gives me that sources\nmy thoughts of insecurity and once you\ndiscover the source of the thought\nmachine you can start the process of\nturning it off and so I would like\nliterally if I were to record your\nthoughts from your last relationship in\nthis relationship I think one of them\njust had way more thoughts coming from\nthat thought machine and they just don't\ncome from this thought machine because\nyou just kind of turned it off and I\nknow it sounds kind of simple but like\nhonestly it kind of is and so the\ninteresting thing here is that I think\nthat you have another thought machine\nwhich is behind the curve and somewhere\nalong the way and I'm not sure if it's\nyour parents like everyone wants to say\nit's your parents like all of us\ntherapists and psychiatrists and stuff\nlike we're like all our experience I\nmean you know maybe there was something\naround like your dad not being quite\naffectionate enough or maybe your\nparents compared you did your parents\ncompare you a lot with your sister yeah\nbut not like like they wouldn't they\nwouldn't say or maybe they didn't then\nmaybe I just think that they did but no\nit's interesting right like how you're\nanalyzing what you said so let's not\njudge what you said so what how did can\nfeel growing up my dad more so than my\nmom but yeah I think that they that they\ncompared us a lot and how did you notice\nthat um I guess I'm just like expecting\nme to do well like my sister in\nelementary school they were like normal\nclasses in advanced math classes I think\nthat because my sister was always in the\nadvanced ones they expected me to be in\nthose classes as well\nmy sister making varsity\nsoccer freshman year just like it\nexpected me to do the same yeah I guess\nthat like sisters that precedent\nexpected me to reach that precedent and\nand what was it like to not reach that\nprecedent I mean the interesting thing\nis I I'm almost interpreting what you\nsaid is that you weren't in advanced\nmath classes and you didn't end up in\nvarsity soccer is that true yeah how\ndoes it um to hear me say that\nexplicitly what I mean it's too much but\num I don't know maybe at first maybe it\nbothered me actually yes okay it did\nbother me at first the first like big\nexample that I have is this advanced\nmath stuff and I would like on my own\nstudy I actually recently I did this\nYouTube video where I went through like\nold school work and old pictures and\nstuff and I found a letter that I wrote\nto a teacher it's not in the video I\nfound a letter that I wrote to a teacher\nabout like really wanting to be an\nadvanced math which is like not a thing\nthat I mean it's not like you submit a\nletter to be in advance\nI like wrote a letter to my teacher for\nthe following year saying like can I\nplease be in this class which and this\nwas in like third or fourth grade or\nsomething yeah and I was never in it so\nat first I think it was it made me feel\nbad and then later on in high school\nlike when I didn't get in the varsity\nsoccer at that point it was just like a\nnorm so I think it probably became\neasier to to deal with oh okay hold on a\nsec so no my friend i I think I think by\nthe time you hit high school it became\nchronic right so now what we're dealing\nwith is something that's chronic does\nthat make sense yeah like your sense of\nbeing behind the curve like now in a\nsense when you say be it's become easier\nto deal with\nnot really you've become better at\ndealing with something that\nthat point became fact yeah so that's\nbad okay so like do you understand what\nI mean by that I don't really understand\nwhy it's a bad thing yeah I understand\nthat you don't understand that what I'm\nsaying is that like you think that this\nis just the way that you are yes right\nso like I think that that's bad because\nI don't think you're that way okay so I\nthink you so I think so let's just let's\nthink through this okay\nand is it okay that we're being a little\nbit more analytical instead of emotional\nokay were you hoping to come in here and\nhave like a cathartic like oh so so I'm\ngonna try it because I think you're\nyou've done a lot of that kind of stuff\nI don't know why I believed that but now\nit sort of makes sense so so I want you\nto just think so first let's think about\nthe third grader who writes a letter to\ntheir math teacher to be an advanced\nmath yeah let's talk about her like what\ndo you think a third grader how do you\nthink that third grader feels well it\ndefinitely wasn't because I liked math\nand I wanted to challenge myself third\ngraders don't want to challenge\nthemselves in any way sure yeah I've\nalways hated it when I was reading the\nletter it felt like a really sad like\ndesperate attempt to find another way to\nget in because I knew that I wouldn't\nget him because of my test score yep so\nit is sad and desperate what does that\nperson feel about themselves\nI probably just that they're not smart\nenough yeah they're not good enough\nright yeah and that they have to put on\nmakeup to fool people they have to do\nsomething that is outside the norm of\nwhat normally like normal people normal\nkids get in the math class by being\nsmart and normal people are pretty and\nthey can put on makeup and I'm sorry if\nI'm bludgeoning you with this I think\nit's related but like you know normal\npeople can put on makeup and look better\nbut like I'm fundamentally different and\nso I have to go the extra mile to catch\nup and be normal right you start behind\npeople is that how you feel about\nyourself yep\nso can you see how like that's what the\nthird grader feels about themselves\nright so like you kind of said this runs\ndeep I completely agree and then let's\nthink about so let's just pause and\nthink about that for a second what do\nyou think about that third graders\nbeliefs do you think that those are\naccurate I mean I wish that I could say\nno but yeah cuz I I know that according\nto that I mean if we're talking about\nthe math class like I know that even if\nI I don't know I mean I could but even\nif I were to like study harder or like\nreally make an effort to to test to get\nin that class that I I don't think I\nwould have so yeah I mean I think I was\naccurate and thinking that I needed to\ndo more to try to get in I I'm glad\nyou're saying that because this is so\nthis is where we get into a really\nreally tricky trap which is that we want\nto be positive right what we should say\nis that yeah third grader you can do it\nyeah yeah like you're not actually dumb\nyou don't actually have to work as hard\nbut like the truth is that like maybe I\nmean I don't think you're dumb I mean\nthat was kind of an inflammatory\nstatement but I I don't I think it's\ngood that you can recognize that you're\nnot your sister the big difference is\nthat third year old three third grader\nyou placed a value judgment on not being\nyours\nyeah you assumed that your sister was\nlike objectively better than what you\nare you assumed that being an advanced\nclass advanced math is objectively\nbetter than not being an advanced math\nyes what I would like to help you do\nMaya is to let go of that second part\nthe judgment because I think you're\naccurate right like if you're not good\nat math and you're not gonna go like if\nyou're not gonna study engineering in an\nIvy League university like you shouldn't\nstudy Utley [ __ ] that all right you know\nbe the person that you want to be I\nthink the tricky thing is that somewhere\nalong the way you started judging\nyourself for being who you are and you\ntried to be someone else and then what\nhappened is when high school came along\nyou sort of got so good at that that it\nstopped being painful hmm you just sort\nof accepted it you're smiling yeah no\nit's just true what's true about it what\nare you thinking it's just how so that\nthat like that I had like tried to be\nsomething else and then by the time I\ngot the high school it was it was I just\ngotten used to doing that yeah right so\nat that point like the problem is that\nat that point it becomes fact and it\nbecomes baked in its like baked like you\ncan't take it out anymore like once you\nbake a cake you know everything's in\nthere right and and now I think the\nproblem is that we see that part of you\nright like we see the 3rd grader who's\nnot good enough for advanced math who in\nyour teenage years needed makeup to look\nnormal and and now we still see it with\nyour twitch stream we're like oh I\ncouldn't have done this on my own\nbecause I'm not good enough like miss\nkif is like I'm I'm less good and I need\nthese I need letters to math teachers in\norder to be like the others and it's\njust become true for you what do you\nthink about that\nI think that it's accurate yeah yeah and\nI think that it makes sense I'm not sure\nwhat that means for for me or like my\nidentity aired what I should do about it\nthat I'm sure it's so let's answer that\nquestion because that's an important\nright so the first is oddly enough I\ndon't want you to make that untrue\nit's not my place to tell you it isn't\ntrue what I'd like for you to be able to\ndo and what I'd like to help you do is\nfree yourself of the judgment that comes\nwith that all right\ndo you play games okay I mean like I've\nplayed some all of my allergies go No\nyeah I won't worry I won't understand a\nfew if you make it reference so so you\nwork with animals right I do you have a\nhawk she's an American Kestrel\nokay so Kestrel is a pretty small bird\nright it's not good at North America\nyeah yeah so like let's think about that\nfor a second okay so like a Castrol is\nlike a Kestrel isn't as big and like\ndoes that mean that it's worse but\ngenerally speaking no right so so like I\nwant you to think about that right so\nlike the problem is not that factually\nyou aren't as smart as other people the\nproblem is that you don't think about it\ndepends on what you want to do do you\nsee that like it's that part of the\nthought process that's missing you just\nlook at size you don't look at like\nadaptability and it's sometimes you do\nbut does that make sense yeah and I\nthink that that's been ingrained in me\nand all of my peers since we were in\npreschool for that but like what you\nshould do is do really well in school be\nreally good at math be an engineer\nor comp sigh and goes to school but no\none ever no one ever said like you\nshould like you should learn how to\ntrain animals and you should try to go\ninto the AG industry and you should like\nif you like doing outdoor stuff like you\nshould get really into it you know and\nand like nurture that passion nothing to\nbe talks about that yeah what do you\nthink about that if I liked math a lot\nand wanted to be an engineer and went to\na school for that I probably wouldn't\nfeel a lot of the things that I feel\nyeah so I I think actually my I think\nyou are just truly remarkable and the\nreason is because like you said all of\nthose kids were do you know why your kit\nyour high school has a high suicide rate\nprobably cuz not all of them like math\nand engineering and what do they do when\nthey don't like math or engineering I\nmean not all of them but yeah a lot of\nthem yeah why do they kill themselves\nbecause they don't like math and\nengineering like what do they end up\nmajoring in college well most the ones\nthat I mean kill themselves off you know\nlike those kids like you know the ones\nthat didn't kill themselves the ones\nthat are just depressed yeah so like I\nmean I know a lot of people I know a lot\nof people that that went to school like\nmy best friend went to school for\nbusiness and she was super super unhappy\nand she changed her major it's an art\nand design and now she's really happy\nbut she went through credit quite a\ncrisis in deciding to change her major\nand I think there are probably a lot of\nmy peers from high school that have\npursued business or\nor engineering and are unhappy but feel\nlike they're doing what's right and I\nthink that the kids that couldn't take\nthat or the kids that were depressed in\nhigh school or the ones that did take\ntheir lives probably just thought that\nlike they knew that they wouldn't be\nhappy doing what we were supposed to do\nand you get where I'm going no I'm sorry\nor not and they knew they wouldn't be\nhappy doing what they're supposed to do\nso they I mean they just they took their\nlives because they knew that they\nwouldn't be happy because they want to\ndo other things so why do I think you're\nremarkable what does I did in high\nschool you didn't what commit suicide\nnot only that I mean and now I'm curious\nabout whether you were suicidal but what\nI think makes you remarkable is that you\nchose to be what you are right that you\nhad like that you chose to like be the\nperson that you shouldn't be that's what\nI think makes you amazing like so I\nthink you know you're in a world of I\nforget you know what kind of like what a\nred-tailed hawk is pretty big yeah so\nlike you know you're in a world of where\neveryone's saying that a red-tailed hawk\nis what you should be in you're a\nKestrel and I think the people that\nkilled themselves were kestrels that\npretended to be red-tailed Hawks and\nthen realized that they couldn't take\ndown the kind of prey that red-tailed\nHawks go for yeah yeah no that makes\nsense what are you feeling right now\nI feel bad I don't know I don't I don't\ntalk about or reflect on the case from\nmy high school like ever but it's it's\nnot something that I ever put thought I\ndid the most thought that I've ever put\ninto it was that like it was just like\ntoo much pressure you know and I've like\na lot of the language and like high\nschool and stuff when we talked about it\nwas that like they like couldn't take it\nyou know or like they couldn't handle\nthe pressure so I think that you're very\nsimilar to those kids in high school\nwhat do you think about that yeah I mean\nI wasn't I was never depressed or\nsuicidal in high school I was in college\nlike a year and a half I'm wondering\nlike Maya do you think that those kids\nin high school felt the way that you\nfelt in the third grade when you wrote\nthat letter\nyeah I bet um I bet a lot of them felt\nlike frauds or like they weren't\nsupposed to like they weren't like\neveryone I would say like they were just\nfaking it while everyone else was\nactually smart yeah I think that's why\nit hurts right because like when you\nthink about it you recognize that like\nyou know what they felt like like you\ndon't know what you know but you feel I\nmean to be honest I was a little bit\nsurprised to see your reaction there but\nI think just that you got emotional kind\nof it when we were sort of oh me too\nyeah I've never I've never cried about\nthat yeah yeah and I mean so I was gonna\nask you why do you think you did but I I\nthink the reason that you did is because\nyou know what it's like to be them you\nknow what it's like to feel those\nfeelings you know what it's like to be\neight years old and like\nstart to think that you're not good\nenough and between the ages of 8 and 15\nevery year that goes by to think more\nand more that oh maybe I'm not good\nenough maybe I'm not good enough and\nmaybe I'm not good enough and then what\nhappens in high school then it's not a\nmaybe yep right then it's like I'm not\ngood enough and I'm not gonna make it\nand then they hold on to hope and they\nhold on to hope that maybe they're wrong\nmaybe they're wrong maybe they're wrong\nbut their mind tells them no you're not\nwrong you're not wrong you're not gonna\nget into an ivy\nyou're not as good at math you're not\nyou're not a redtail talk right and they\ncan't what I think really I'm very\nimpressed by and and what I think really\nmakes you an amazing person has nothing\nto do with your skills at math or even\nyou're not necessarily your conservation\nwork it's that you let yourself be a\nKestrel and I think that's what saved\nyou and I think that like the world has\nmade a better place by people\nacknowledging that they're not by being\nwho they are right like that's what\nmakes your conservation work impactful\nbecause you actually like give a [ __ ]\nabout it like imagine an alternate\nuniverse we're in Silicon Valley\neveryone went into conservation work and\nyou were the one kid that liked\nmathematics it doesn't matter it's just\nlike being who you are and what I love\nit if you could do is just recognize\nthat you know when you feel so now I'll\ntry to tie things up for you okay and\nthen you can ask questions or we can\nmeditate or whatever we can talk further\nbut I'd like to I'd love it if I could\nhelp you walk away from this\nconversation with something kind of\nconcrete that hopefully you can sort of\nlike implement in some way in that\nconcrete thing is recognized that you\nhave this thought machine of Maya is not\ngood enough and that same thought\nmachine is what drove people to kill\nthemselves in high school in that same\nthought machine is what drove you is a\n3rd grader to write a letter to your\nmath teacher to like one\nin advanced math class and just think\nabout the desperation and sadness right\nlike that's where suicide comes from it\ncomes from a combination of sadness and\ndesperation I can hear you know all\nright I was saying that that I was\ngetting myself going just a discord\n[ __ ] me out me um no it's not your it's\nmy internet so I was just thinking that\nyou know what I think about suicide I\nthink about if you want to understand\nsuicide its sadness and desperation it's\nthose two things right that's what leads\nto suicide and that you understood like\na third grade you like understood what\nthat was like and now what I want you to\nrecognize is that third grade you lives\nwith you today that all throughout it\nstarted and like there's a part of you\nthat just believes and then like you you\nthankfully were able to find yourself\nquote-unquote right you found Miss\ngifting you found twitch and you found\nus and we embraced you and we love you\nfor who you are and you absolutely\ndeserve the success that you have\nbecause I don't think I mean you can't\nfake it on Twitch you just can't like\ntwitch is actually really really good at\nlike picking up things they're they're\nkind of visceral and primitive but\nthey're like very instinctual and so so\nthe next time can you hear that it\nsounds like one of my children is it\nhurt hurt herself okay let me try the\nrock so I was just gonna say so I want\nyou to notice that when you start to\nfeel not good about yourself or you\nnotice those thoughts or you start to\nthink like now we're gonna go back to\nthe hemo right thinking that if you use\nthis emote you're a bad person and this\nand this and this and recognize like try\nto see like what of those thoughts is\ncoming from the thought machine of third\nyear the third grader Maya and even if\nit's coming from those that you don't\nhave to like follow those like even\nthough you're not as smart as other\npeople it doesn't like you who the [ __ ]\nthis is my point is like there's no I\nwant you to let go of your judgment of\nnot being as smart as other people\nmm-hmm right like if you're not as good\nof a streamer as Miss gift for other\npeople like so be it like what's wrong\nwith that yeah right you're not a\nred-tailed hawk you're a Kestrel fine so\nlike be the Kestrel and as best as you\ncan recognize that that part of you is\nlike there and that's gonna be like\nbubbling up thoughts but you have this\nother thought machine in which you're\nnot behind the curve that thought\nmachine doesn't care about whether\nyou're behind the curve or not it\ndoesn't care about whether you convince\n30 people or a thousand people or 3,000\npeople you just care about convincing\npeople and you just care about pushing\nforward in the more that you can listen\nto that part of yourself I think the\nless power\nthis internalizing your success and\ninsecurity and anxiety and overthinking\nwill have over you thoughts questions\nI like the because I've had I've had a\nred day on the Kestrel so I have and\nthat does make sense\nbut I don't think I have any questions\nokay great any last I mean thoughts are\nwe or we can say goodbye you good one\nnot the drips have to say something I\njust yeah I don't I don't think so I\nmean this was a really cool conversation\nthank you you're doing really really\ncool stuff on Twitch I mean you know\nthat a cuter but um yeah a lot of people\nhave been have been like touched or like\naffected by by watching your stream so\nit's it's cool that you're doing what\nyou're doing appreciate it I try to\ntouch and fondle as many people as I can\nall right well listen Maya I've had a\nblast too and I think it's awesome that\nyou're doing this conservation work\nbecause of people like you like my kids\nhave you know alligators in the backyard\nso thank you for that actually the\nreason we have alligators in our\nbackyard is because there's a there's a\nswamp or Marsh that has this gigantic\ndevelopment that they're destroying\ntheir habitat so they're moving into the\nlake but um I really I think it's\nawesome what you're doing and I share\nthat sentiment I think you're you know I\nI don't doubt for a minute that you\nbring real value to twitch and that\nyou're an awesome person I don't think\nyou know I agree with you that you're\nnot good at math I mean you're probably\nstill good at math you're just not know\nokay fine so and that's like that's\nperfectly fine in my book and I think\nthe only reason that you're behind the\ncurve is because like you're on a curve\nthat you don't belong yeah and so of\ncourse you're gonna be behind and and\nthen somewhere along the way you started\nto think that you're behind on all\ncurves because my is the girl who's\nbehind on the curve no that's not true\nit's just because you were in on so many\ncurves that weren't your curves so\nanyway good luck to you and you know let\nus know if we can support you in some\nother way or sometimes people have an\naftermath from these conversations and\nI'm glad you have a therapist that you\ncan lean on\nbecause then ya know but if you want to\nyou know if you need some kind of\nsupport or something just let us know\nyou're very welcome and good luck all\nright and thank you for making the world\na better place take care okay so oh [ __ ]\nI forgot meditation yeah I don't I don't\nknow she's done EMDR so I don't think\nwe're gonna meditate I think it's okay\nwe're gonna let her slide\nI just have to think I don't think\nmeditation is actually good for her\nright now\nI think she just needs to not just\nprocess whatever she's thinking or\nfeeling can we see the notes that you\ntook okay let me just think for a second\nlet's see if we want to do we want to do\nquestions let's do questions then we'll\ndo reaction\nlet's do questions while things are hot\nso let's start with a couple of things\none is what does EMDR so EMDR is\nessentially it's something called a\nmovement a movement desensitization\nsomething I forget what the R is and\nit's a technique that's heavily related\nto actually meditation actually so I\nthink the the developers of EMDR it's\nessentially ad hot or not if you guys\nhave heard me talk about that but it's\nthis thing where you move your eyes and\nit's in a particular way and while\nyou're moving your eyes you explore\ntraumatic events and so since your\nattention is focus on the eye movement\nit desensitizes you to some of the\nreactions of the traumatic events so\nit's essentially a way of maintaining\nawareness and not getting sucked into\nthe trauma and then as you talk about\nthe trauma and you kind of open that up\nbut like retain your anchor and the eye\nmovement it sort of helps you process\nthe trauma more easily so yes a ruby\nlight accessing I heard EMDR is used to\nhelp patients with trauma PTSD but the\neffect effectiveness is still\nquestionable yeah so they're they're\nmixed studies right so there's some\nstudies that show that EMDR is effective\nand there are other studies that show\nthat it doesn't seem to be that\neffective which is common for a lot of\nthings in medicine and I think that like\nyou know we think about effectiveness is\nlike monolith like its effectiveness is\nquestionable\nwell that just presumes that everyone is\ngoing to benefit from the same thing and\nin my experience some things are\neffective for some people and some\nthings are not effective for people and\ngenerally speaking you know it takes\ntime for medicine to tease apart those\ndifferences so for example we know that\nyou know different kinds of people will\nrespond to different treatments for\ndepression for some people psychotherapy\nworks really well and psychotherapy is\nlike for other people stuff like\nbehavioral activation works well for\nother people medication works well for\nsome people exercise works well so\nthere's a heterogenous population so\ntreatment you shouldn't think about a\ntreatment as quote unquote effective or\nnot effective although there are some\ntreatments that really don't work for\nanyone but you know so I think it's fine\nif a treatment has mixed results like it\njust to me when you have a study that\nshows that something is effective in\nanother study that shows that it is an\neffect or the first question you should\nask yourself is you know what are the\nperspectives of the researchers because\nsometimes bias can lead to that result\nbut if there isn't too much bias or you\nthink that the study was done in a high\nquality way it probably means that the\nresponses are heterogenous\nor especially something like EMDR I\nthink there's a lot of variability and\nthe quality of people who D EMDR so it's\nnot like standardized it's like a pill\nright so like a pill has a particular\nconcentration of a substance that's made\nin a factoring is guaranteed for\neveryone who gets it the variability\nbetween practitioners of EMDR is high in\nmy experience anyway so let's do let's\ndo questions and then we'll do reaction\nPOG ready to go bro okay so hello Hey\nokay so my question\nis I guess watching my I saw kind of how\nshe was like influenced by other things\nand people and how she grew up on how\nmuch like what she's supposed to be I\nguess and what she's supposed to do yeah\num but it seems like she was kind of\nable to figure herself and like figure\nout like what she is meant to be and\nstuff okay I wonder if it's not that\nclear to somebody what they are and how\nthey're supposed to be how they can\nfigure that out I guess I don't know if\nthat's like a good question or if it's\ntoo much that's a fantastic question\nso first let's understand a couple of\nthings one is that even though Maya is\nmoving in the right direction for her\nlife she still carries her demons with\nher right is that so I think that like a\nlot of people assume that once you\nfigure out what you want to do in your\nlife that the demons go away but the\nfirst thing that I just want to point\nout is that you carry your demons with\nyou the processing the process of\nexercising your demons and then like you\nknow finding out what you want to do in\nlife is separate right and I and I\nrecognize that's not your question I\njust think it's an important distinction\nso question your question is like how do\nyou find out if you've been told that\nyou should do something your entire life\nlike how do you figure out what you're\nsupposed to do yes because like it might\nnot be as simple in a way not simple but\nlike specific maybe as to like how\nyou're supposed to study a certain thing\nit might be just a general thing like\nfor me it's like how I'm generally\nsupposed to be right so then I find\nmyself conflicted as like how are we or\nam i really annoying or am I really\nfunny or am i what am i you know in many\ndifferent things that kind of thing like\nI don't know it's just what have you\nbeen taught that you should be I guess\nthat's like a huge response but long\nstory short I guess like I was\nthat I'm supposed to be respectful in\nanyway in some ways and like I'm I don't\nknow it's like a very traditional way I\ngrew up I guess sure so there's like a\nlot of things with that thay has to do\nwith behavior has to do with like maybe\nacademics like similar to Maya there\nwhere you're supposed to go to a good\nUnion all that but then I just end up\nfinding myself conflicted in general so\nwhat I so what's the conflict so on the\none side is be respectful go to detox\nand what's on the other side that's the\nthing I don't really know because in\nreality I'm just I'm just so used to\nfollowing the path that I was supposed\nto take but like now I have different\nbehaviors that don't go together and I\ndon't know which one is like real and\nwhich one is not me\nI don't know makes any sense yeah so so\nI I think I think that it makes a lot of\nsense and I think your answer is\nactually closer than you think it is so\nlet's put it this way right so like\nthere are some people and and do you\nmind if I ask what your ethnicity is\nyeah I'm great I don't mind okay\nso like there are some people who you\nknow you've been taught that you should\ngo to good uni you should do this you\nshould do that and then there are some\npeople like in your social circle that\ndid those things are not completely fine\nwith it\nyes right yes so then you're asking how\ndo I figure out like who's the real me\nand my point is that first of all\nthere's a gigantic data point because\nyou're not one of those people yes I'm\ndefinitely not I never felt like a fit\nin perfect so then it goes back to this\nconflict so then the question is like so\nyou have the real you that's actually\ntrying to come out and that's why you\nhave conflict that's why you didn't you\ncan't be one of those people so all you\nready to do is pay attention to where\nthe source of that conflict is coming\nfrom because there's the path that you\nshould take and then there's the part of\nyou that rebels against that path so all\nyou have to do is figure out like what\nis that part of you that's rebelling\nlike why do I feel like not doing this\nwhat about this doesn't feel right to me\nthat make sense\nand as\nto explore like why you're conflicted\nyou're gonna find your answer so like if\nwe think about Maya she was told in the\nthird grade she wanted to be an advanced\nmath class and then as she went to high\nschool she I'm sure there were kids who\nwent to like technology camp or math\ncamp or [ __ ] like that and she said\ninstead of doing that that doesn't feel\nright to me what I really want to do she\nhad I'm sure she was offered to go to\nyou know summer soccer camp or math camp\nor something like that and then she\nnoticed a little bit of conflict within\nherself that she really didn't want to\ndo that what she wanted to do is do\nconservation where she wanted to be with\nanimals and then she listened to that\nvoice because she there was some kind of\nconflict and I think if you just listen\nif you tunnel down into why you're\nconflicted you'll find out who you are\nokay that makes a lot of sense awesome\ngood luck thanks for your question yep\nready for the next one hello Hey so my\nquestion is how do you enhance went of\nmachine over another thought machine for\nexample my Myatt or a third machine and\nthe other one how do you what can you\nask your question again please yeah so\noh do you enhance one thought machine\nover another thought machine perfect so\nthat's a wonderful question so the first\nis you it starts with noticing which\nthought machine is active so the biggest\nproblem is that when a thought machine\nis active we don't accept we don't\nrecognize that those are just thoughts\nwe believe them yeah right so like like\nwhen Maya\nyou know believes factually that she's\nnot as good as others twitch streamers\nwe're like so the first thing you've got\nto do is recognize that one of your\nthought machines is going to how can I\nsay this so the first\nto recognize that it's a thought machine\nthat's active instead of truth okay and\nand so do you recognize like do you have\na particular thought machine that you're\naware of yeah I can notice a thought\nmachine that it's filled with fear like\nfor an anxiety about something okay so\nit starts with recognizing the fear and\nthen there are two or three other\nprinciples so when you're trying to\nfigure out when you're saying enhance\none thought machine over another let's\njust think about the different things\nyou can do with a thought machine so one\nis that you can prioritize one thought\nmachine over the other the second thing\nthat you can do is directly shrink a\nthought machine so if we look at Maya's\ncase what we see is that she had a\nbreakthrough with EMDR that essentially\nunpowered or reduced the power to her\nthought machine that was like about\nabandonment did you catch that part yep\nand so in the same way if you figure out\nwhere does this thought machine get its\npower from where does it originate from\nI mean if you can find the origin of the\nthought machine and you can figure out\noh like this is like these thoughts are\ncoming from third-grade me who felt this\nway this isn't actually like true now\nit's just like thoughts that are left\nover from like this traumatic experience\nso again thank you huh\nyes or in my case for example it came\nfrom a another movie which stressed me a\nlot so when I watched something that\ncould be stressful I'm like I'm I'm\nscared it could stress me don't know\nthere under the way I have watched like\nthousand movies so I'm like oh no don't\nworry it will be nice yeah that's that's\nreally good so so that's good that you\nnotice that so then what you have to do\nis the next time you approach a movie\nyou need to be aware of like okay is\nthis the fear from the last horror movie\nthat's left over or is this like a fear\nfrom now the other thing that I worry a\nlittle bit about is that the horror\nmovie may not actually\nbe the origin of it it may have been the\nway like the surface of it yeah so did\nthe horror movie relate to something\nelse that happened to you before\n[Music]\nthat's better\nbut it's so it's so what I did they\ndidn't to be sure absolutely so here's\nthe way that I would like you to explore\nthat so the way that you felt when you\nthink about the horror movie that\ncreated this for you think about the way\nthat you felt in that horror movie and\nthen ask yourself have you felt that way\nbefore I mean if the answer is yes go\nback to and reflect about how did I feel\nthen why did I feel then because I would\nbe really surprised if it was created by\nthe horror movie yes I don't find the\nroot of the primitive absolutely and\nthen as you process that root you can\nsee a therapist or just reflect about it\nor think about it then the thought\nmachine will start to get powered down\nand then the second thing that you can\ndo is as those thoughts or that anxiety\nstarts to rise you can shift towards\nanother one through a technique like\nalternate nostril breathing or something\nlike that you can actually like just\nshift and then start to you know you're\ngonna have different thoughts or\nconflicting thoughts and then you can\nliterally steer your mind so you can ask\nyourself if you say like oh I should\nwatch this movie and I shouldn't watch\nthis movie and then notice that you have\nthe two conflict right you say oh it's\nokay to watch the movie it'll be a great\nmovie and then kind of notice okay I'm\ngonna choose to watch the movie and\nthere's gonna be a part of my mind that\nis gonna be afraid and I'm just gonna\nwatch that thing and I'm gonna let it be\nI'm not gonna try to not be afraid I'm\ngonna let it be afraid but I'm also\ngoing to try to enjoy the movie yeah\nabsolutely\nit's like and they are technique\nabsolutely very good excellent\nyeah perfect all right good luck man\nthanks a lot for everything you that you\ndo yeah of course man\nmy pleasure"
