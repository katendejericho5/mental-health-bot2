    "transcript": "today I want to talk to you all about\nhow to stop taking things\n[Music]\npersonally so as we go through life\noften times people will tell us things\nthat we don't want to hear and we take\nit incredibly personally they'll say\nthings like oh bro like don't take it so\npersonally man like it's not really you\nor if we're going through a breakup like\noh my God it's not you it's me and it's\ninfuriating and when I work with my\npatients one of the most important\nthings that has trans formed their lives\nis to teach them how to stop taking\nthings personally when you take things\npersonally it creates bad feelings and\nbad outcomes and if we can learn how to\nstop taking things personally which\nironically means accepting\nresponsibility those two are at opposite\nends of the spectrum as I hope to show\nyou what we'll discover is that it will\nhelp you feel better and do better now I\nwas even debating making this video and\nI talked to about it about my team\nbecause I think while this concept is so\ntransformation\nit is also really really hard to explain\nso when I work with my patients it's\nlike at some point they get this like\nlight bulb that goes off above their\nhead like a a flip a switch flips in\ntheir mind and then suddenly they get it\nand it's really awesome but it's really\nhard for me to try to explain this so I\nI think it's really stressing my\nabilities as a teacher so please try to\nstay with me please try to get what I'm\nsaying because I think it'll really help\na lot and if that doesn't work out\nremember it's not you it's me\nso let's start by actually looking at\nnarcissism which if we really stop and\nthink about it for a second taking\nthings personally is a feature of\nnarcissism right so I want youall to\nthink about the people in your life that\nyou know who are narcissistic thankfully\none of the interesting positive sides\nfor the skyrocketing rate of narcissism\nthat we see due to things like the\ninternet is now at least everyone has\nseen a narcissist and maybe you are a\nlittle bit narcissistic it's what the\ninternet and social media is doing to us\nwe all watch videos on the internet\nbecause we want to change the problem is\nthat even though we keep watching them\nwe don't necessarily change I want to\ntalk to you all about our coaching\nprogram and if you're not interested\njust jump forward 20 seconds and get\nstraight to the video but if you're\nsomeone who is ready to actually make\nchange if you want to see outcomes in 6\n8 12 weeks if you guys are struggling\nwith problems like career stuff burnout\nstuff social skills low self-esteem if\nyou're trying to struggle to motivate\nyourself to actually act that's what we\nbuilt a coaching program for check out\nthe link in the description below to see\nhow coaching can help you and now on to\nthe video so here is a narcissist I\nguess they are green and what happens is\nlet's say that you are over here and you\nsay to the narcissist hey I don't like\nthis thing that you do right so let's\nsay that you have a narcissist who\nalways shows up drunk they are drinking\nall the time this is a bottle of beer I\nit looks like lipstick I look look y'all\ndon't watch me for the art okay so let's\nsay they they always show up drunk and\nyou tell the narcissistic person hey I\ndon't like this thing that you are doing\nand how does the narcissistic person\nrespond the narcissistic person is like\noh my God I don't know what I can do to\nmake you happy I've tried everything I\ndo everything they take it so personally\nright they're like I've tried everything\nI don't know how to make you happy like\nthis is a relationship that I can't win\nin they play the victim card and instead\nof focusing on this problem over here\nthey take things personally this is a\ndefect of them as a person and if it\nbecomes a defect of them as a person\nthey don't actually fix this right\nthat's like what happens with the\nnarcissistic defense mechanism is that\nthey start playing the victim and then\nthey never actually have to create their\nbehavior they start saying all this crap\nthey make you feel guilty and they like\nthey never actually change because they\ndon't understand that the problem is\nover here and instead you know they sort\nof make the problem over here and this\nis exactly the problem with taking\nthings personally now let's flip things\naround so let's say that you are going\nthrough a breakup with someone and the\nperson says it's not you it's me and if\nthey say the problem isn't you it's me\nand you take that personally where do\nyou think the problem is the problem is\nover here right and you're like oh my\nGod like what did I do wrong like I knew\nI'm pathetic I I know that you're seeing\nsomeone else like whatever kinds of\nnegative thoughts happen but you\ninternalize the problem that's what it\nmeans to take something person\npersonally now this creates a huge\nproblem because sometimes you're\nactually right and there is a problem\nwithin you but even in this case you\ndon't know what that problem is right\nbecause they're not saying this is the\nreason I'm breaking up with you that\nthere's an external reason over here\nthey're actually saying that the problem\nis not you at all so even in the event\nthat they the problem does lie with you\nyou still don't know what it is and you\ncan't really take corrective action\nthere's another\ndevastating possibility which is that\nthis person is actually being honest\nthat they are going through some stuff\nin their life right now where they're\nnot ready for a relationship there\nreally is nothing wrong with you and\nthen what happens is you feel bad and\nthe other problem is that there is no\ncorrective action to take see if you're\ndating someone and they no longer want\nto be with you because of they're\nthat they're going through there's\nnothing you can do to actually fix that\nso there's no corrective action so\nthere's no improvement that you can make\nbut you feel bad and then you will\nfurther rack your\nbrain thinking what is wrong what is\nwrong what is wrong what do I need to\nfix what do I need to fix what do I need\nto fix and this in turn leads to low\nself-esteem which in turn leads to more\nnarcissistic defense mechanisms right\nthere's not actually anything to fix\nbecause the problem isn't within you but\nthe moment that you take it personally\nyou beat yourself up the problem is you\nyou don't really know what to fix and\nthis becomes a huge problem so what is\nthe alternative so this is what I work\nwith with my patients which is is what\nwe actually want to do is accept the\nappropriate responsibility let's say\nthat I go for an interview at Google and\nthere is some kind of Le code interview\nokay so the skill is lead code and then\nhere is some prospective employer I go\nto the interview and they say sorry you\ndon't get the job now in this situation\nI have two choices I can take things\npersonally oh my God I knew I wasn't C\ncut out for this I really suck at this\nlike oh my God like you take it\npersonally right the defect is within\nyou it is a part of your identity it is\nan identity defect and this is exactly\nhow narcissists feel by the way right so\nthey feel like there isn't oh no it's\nnot you just don't like me it's not that\nyou don't like how I always steal your\n or I'm always drunk or I have no\ncompassion for you or I don't listen to\nwhat you say or how I prioritize all my\nneeds above yours it's none of that\nstuff you just dislike me I can't win\nright because what they see is they see\nthe problem is over here and I want\nyouall to think about this if you were a\nshitty human what is the solution to\nthat if the problem is in your identity\nyou cannot change your identity it is\nnot actionable information so\ninterestingly enough if you go through\nan interview and you don't get hired and\nsome people will take this personally\nthe defect is in here but this is not\nactionable so when I work with my\npatients what I try to help them do is\nsee what the actual defect effect is\nright what we actually want to do is\nexternalize the problem from ourselves\nwhen we externalize the problem from\nourselves we open ourselves up to\naccepting\nresponsibility and we also create a path\nof action the reason I didn't get hired\nis not because I am a screwed up human\nbeing the reason I did not get hired I\nknow this is shocking is because there\nis a insufficiency of the skills that I\npresented and I want youall to think\nabout that right that's literally what\nnot taking things personally is it is\nnot the problem isn't me it is there's\nthis thing that I need to work on even\nin the case of a breakup right if\nsomeone says I need someone who's more\nemotionally available and if you're not\ncareful you will take that personally\nand you'll be like oh my God how am I\never like there's nothing I can do about\nthat this is who I am right this is who\nI am it's deterministic it's fatalistic\nand it's exactly how narcissists talk\nthey never actually address their\nproblem s which is why so going back to\nthe narcissist right if I have a problem\nBehavior over here right like drinking\nand someone says this is the problem but\nthe narcissist places the blame over\nhere they take things personally then\nwhat that means is they never actually\ncorrect this this continues again and\nagain and again the behavior continues\nforever so the more that they take\nthings personally the less they actually\nfix things in their life which\npropagates the cycle and is what creates\nthe life of a narcissist which is that\nno one ever likes me I don't know what I\ncan do differently I've tried so hard\neveryone hates me and then they ignore\ntheir behaviors over and over and over\nagain so now what we can do with some\nsomething super cool we can use the\nblindness of a narcissism to shed light\non our own lives and when we take things\npersonally we are literally doing the\nsame thing here is you and here is your\nbehavior and if you see the problem over\nhere instead of see the problem over\nhere because we as human beings are not\ngood at seeing problems in two places we\ntend to look at just one problem right\noh yeah it's not you it's me or I'm the\nproblem in the relationship or you're\nthe problem in the relationship shared\nresponsibility is scary and way more\ncomplicated so what this does is when we\nsee th things over here we do not see\nwhat is in here and then we can't take\ncorrective action so instead what we\nwant to do and this is what's\nrevolutionary for my patients is when I\nhelp them see that you are actually\ntotally fine as a human being it is this\nbehavior that you need to change and\nwhat I tend to find with my patients is\nwhen they start to realize this not only\ndo they feel better right because now\nI'm not a poos over here and they can\ntake corrective action and this is what\ntaking responsibility means so you can\ntake corrective action and then as these\nproblems start getting better their\nrelationships start improving their\nperformance starts improving everything\ngets better and they feel better because\nthey don't feel like a POS because they\nrecognize that the problem is outside of\nmyself if the problem is outside of\nmyself there is a clearer way to fix it\nso how do we go about doing that so\nliterally what I want you all to do is\nto anytime you take something personally\nI want you to try to remove yourself\nfrom the equation so in try to practice\na little bit of empathy put yourself in\nthe other person's shoes and ask\nyourself what do they actually see what\nis the behavior what are the words what\nwhat is the visible expression it is not\nidentity right cuz they have no sense of\nlike who your identity is like that's\nnot a thing that they can see there are\ngoing to be certain things that you are\ndoing saying certain ways that you're\nacting that the other person is going to\nperceive so the first thing that you\nneed to do is look through the eyes of\nthe other person which by the way is the\nexact deficit that narcissists have\nright so even if we look at\nevidence-based treatment for narcissism\none of the treatments is something\ncalled mentalization based therapy and\nin mentalization based therapy literally\nwhat we're training these people to do\nis see things through other people eyes\nso ask yourself if you get something\nthat makes you feel bad and you're\ntaking it personally you feel like a POS\nlook at the other person's perspective\nand ask what are they seeing now the\nother thing that you can do is literally\nask them what are you seeing that I'm\ndoing what are the behaviors that bother\nyou what are the words that bother you\nlike help me understand so what we want\nto do is try to externalize our\nperception and look at ourselves or look\nat what they see the next thing that we\nwant to do is try to focus on when when\nwhen you say I am a p o s and you take\nthings personally that is going to\nresult in once again certain\nmanifestations so what are the\nmanifestations is it that I don't text\npeople back fast enough is it that what\nis what are the manifestations of being\na POS and as you examine the\nmanifestations you're going to start to\ndiscover things over here and then comes\nthe most important step is once you\nstart to isolate these things and this\nis the beautiful thing they don't even\nneed to be right right so a lot of my\npatients will get hung up what if what\nif I'm wrong about this right what if\nI'm wrong about let's say this person\nsays I'm not invested in the friendship\nand I ask them okay what what does this\nperson see well they text me and I don't\ntext them back and then my patients will\nask well what if I'm wrong what if\nthat's the wrong thing and that's not\nreally the problem that that is in the\nrelationship this is where I say I don't\ncare what what do you how do you feel\nabout texting people back more\nfrequently like do you think that would\nimprove your life in some way do you\nthink that that could help may help your\nother relationships as well so as you\ntake this as you take this approach\nyou're going to start to isolate these\nkinds of things and then you're going to\nstart working on them this is what we\nmean by accepting responsibility you're\ngoing to start to fix those actions and\nthe Beautiful Thing is as you start to\nfix those actions you separate things\nfrom your ego as you separate things\nfrom your ego and you start to take the\nright action you remove bad feelings and\nbad outcomes and if you stop and really\nthink about it right so we're going to\nend by talking about the narcissists\nwhat is it that the narcissist never\ndoes they never change their\n Behavior they never change what\nthey say they keep on insisting that the\nproblem is within them but the whole\nreason that it's so infuriating is\nbecause they do not focus on the things\nthat are outside of them and so if you\nwant to take things less personally it\nwill help you so much practice a little\nbit of empathy look at what other people\nare seeing and you don't get to answer\nwith they're seeing a loser that is not\nsomething you can see right even in the\ncase of a loser what is a loser maybe\nit's someone who's overweight maybe it's\nsomeone who doesn't wear properly\nfitting clothing maybe it's someone who\ndoesn't it doesn't groom themselves\nproperly boom action item number one\naction item number two action item\nnumber three so literally look at things\nthrough other people's eyes look at\nthings look at the manifestations of\nwhat you feel makes you take things\npersonally and then focus on those\nthings it'll improve your life and it'll\nproove the way that you feel last thing\nis that there are a couple of other\nthings involved with this things like\nego and stuff like that we have other\nsources that we talk about the\nrelationship of what activates the ego\nbecause taking things personally is a\nnarcissist defense mechanism there's\ncertain meditation techniques and things\nlike that check out our videos on ego we\nactually have a resource pack that's all\nabout ego and confidence and then we\nalso have things in in stuff like Dr K's\nguide to meditation um the trauma guide\nand then the last thing that is very\nvery\nhelpful is when we have trouble seeing\nthings the way that they are this is\nreally what our coaching program excels\nat so the reason that their outcomes are\nso good is because they are they're very\ngood at being an external lens for you\nright so if you're having trouble\nputting yourself in someone else's shoes\nor seeing what they see that's exactly\nwhat a coach is for they're there to\nlook at things from the outside and\nshare that information with you in an\nactionable way so depending on what\ny'all are interested check out more\nstuff thanks for making it to the end of\nthe video and let us know if this\nactually makes sense to you or not so is\nit you or is it me or does it work out\nor let us know\noh\n[Music]"
