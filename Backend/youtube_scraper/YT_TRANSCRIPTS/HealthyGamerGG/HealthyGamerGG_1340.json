    "transcript": "there's no way that's true right that's\nwhat your responses you're like sure\nlogically it could be true but you\nweren't there and you really don't know\nit's impossible is that how you feel\nit's impossible yeah\nit's impossible that she could like you\nso what's your name buddy\nmy name is head Hayden okay yeah\nand so tell me Hayden what are we\ntalking about today\nbe sure we're talking about me being an\ninsult\nokay so why don't we start with this\nwhat does that mean it means it just\nmeans that I almost sad come okay what\nis in what ways are you assign count\nsorry for the story grab my lads this\nway sure I I don't actually I mean yeah\nI think you can say [ __ ] I don't think\nyou should say things that are offensive\nso maybe maybe sorry any word yeah\nthat's just my coach oh sorry yeah\nthat's okay\nit's good you lift you noticed yeah I'm\njust a little bit like misogynist and\nkind of go like a negative view on women\nI guess okay just from that's strange\nmost misogynists describe themselves as\nmisogynists I don't know I don't usually\nhear that usually people get called\nmisogynists right oh yeah I've been coda\nmisogynist but okay silly what what is\nthat\nso I don't think I'm fully misogynist oh\njust like what so what is it when you\nsay you're a misogynist what is it what\ndoes that mean just means just negative\nyou and women what does that mean a\nnegative view on women can you help me\nunderstand that\nI don't know like just so bad things to\nrelate to them okay so let me it seems\nlike it's a little bit tricky for you to\nanswer questions is that are you feeling\nthat way yeah yeah yeah\nso let's let's just try to understand\nthat first are you feeling nervous yeah\nyeah like on a scale of one to ten how\nnervous are you right now\nuh probably like seven eight okay and\nwhat is it that's making you nervous\ndo you think uh just the fact that uh\nI've watched you a lot i watch all the\nstreamers that you interview so like\nit's kind of like surreal okay\nthank you okay so justjust do you think\nsome of your nervousness has to do with\nwhat we're talking about or is it just\nbeing on stream in general yeah and that\nbut I don't know I just don't really\nlike I don't think I'm the biggest in so\nyou could have caught what the [ __ ] man\nlike what's what's up with all these\nlike people coming on that are not\ngigantic I don't think there's such\nthing as like what would the biggest\ninsult look like let's start there just\nreally hates everything I mean I hate\neverything but like really hates you\nwould look ugly you know the head of you\nwould endure you just I think I'm\nalright okay I would add I think I'm I\ndon't think I look amazing but yeah you\nand me both brother thanks okay so what\nwhat else is different between you and\nso that the the ultimate insult the\nfinal boss of the insults the clan\nleader of the in cells would be uglier\nthan you are what else would be\ndifferent about him he'd be a man\nmale yeah okay\ncan you be a female and sell yes okay so\nthat's kind of confusing because you\nknow I asked you like what's an in sell\nand then you kind of talk started\ntalking about misogyny so what's an\ninsult but just explain it to us like\nhelp us understand you got understand\nright so like back in my day I mean I\nwas probably an insult but they didn't\nexist so how is more common today cuz\nthe internet like you know I don't\nreally social a lot so like this just\nthe fact that I just stay inside enjoy\nthe time okay what does I don't have to\ndo with you being an insult\nbecause I have an opportunity to be in a\nrelationship or they women you don't\nhave an opportunity well less of an\nopportunity but okay like but yet and\nbut also with like the culture today I\nthink makes for more in sales as well\nmax there are a lot of insults right now\nI mean you take maximal cells as well no\nI said wait what was a lot of in cells\nokay so let's start with this what is\nthe term in cell stand for involuntary\ncelibate picture and help me understand\nwhat that means not your choice to be\nsingle okay so whose choice is it that\nyou're single it's a woman's fault I\ndon't know okay so let's talk about that\nhow is it the woman's women or a woman\nlet's start there\nwomen i matter I don't necessarily agree\nwith that I think it can be it can be\nbut I also like its sorry mind afraid\nwe're gonna be perceived Hayden a little\nbit but not really really cuz I'm\ngetting a lot of hesitation from you and\nI'm trying to figure out if that has me\nI just like generally not know I'm just\nlike not clear in my thoughts\nokay like I've been thinking about it\ncoming up to the interview but like I've\nhad conversations in my head with you\nbut it's never likely cut like this is\nwhat I think this is my opinion it's\nalways like Mackie and like yeah this\nand this so so let's start there Hayden\nis this a place where we want people to\nhave clear-cut thoughts and opinions you\nknow is that what people come here for\nuh no I don't think so yeah so what do\npeople come here for uh take it to help\nunderstand the way you think about\nthings okay and so like if I take two\npeople so let's say that our audience is\ninterested in understanding the way that\nthey think and I give them two options\none is someone who has done a lot of\nthinking and is very clear and they're\nthinking and the other one doesn't\nunderstand what the [ __ ] they think and\nthey're thinking is very murky which one\ndo you think our audio which one do you\nthink helps our audience more fake\nlaying straight like to the point person\nhow because you can easily help him\nunderstand way he's going wrong well I\nthink you can more than any guy that\ndoesn't know so I actually disagree so\nthe first thing is you have a\npresumption that the clear-headed person\nis going somewhere wrong which I don't\naccept that like I don't think that it's\nnot my job to tell people where they're\nthinking is flawed right because I just\nfor this situation like I think being an\nin cell\nand big misogynist is wrong why but I\nwell I just think it's wrong and stupid\nbut why also it's because I don't know\nyeah so Hayden I ask you like can we be\na little bit critical of ourselves yeah\nand so the first place that we need to\nbe critical of is placing a value\njudgment on whether being an insult is a\ngood thing or a bad thing or whether\nbeing a misogynist is a good thing or a\nbad thing\nnope right so like a I don't know if\nyou've caught some of these streams but\na big thing that I've come to appreciate\nis that our mind does things that are\nadaptive like anxiety is a protective\nmechanism right ego is a protective\nmechanism and so I don't know if that\napplies to being an insular and\nmisogynist but I'd be curious about that\nand I think if you want to change which\nwe haven't explicitly talked about but\nthere's you know I kind of had this\nassumption that you don't want to be an\ninsult anymore is that true Tonda yeah I\nmean yeah rather have a positive view\nrather than having in you what's\nnegative about the view of an insult\n[Music]\njust how to\n[Music]\nI think there is native things like just\nthinking just judging a person off the\nagenda is pretty negative but er your\njudgments accurate I mean if they\nthought of it I go it's accurate but\nlike if you if you\nI don't think everybody's like that you\nknow I mean do you think most in cells\nfeel the way that you feel yep that they\nand what about what about that like do\nthey think that do you think that they\ndon't like being misogynists oh I've no\nD okay um it's a good answer so hmm\nso let me I want to share like maybe one\nor two thoughts and then maybe I can we\ncan ask it kind of different strain of\nquestions because it seems like your\nthoughts about this aren't clear which\nother is the first thing I want talk\nabout so that's good I think it's good\nthat you're not clear the reason that\nour scream helps people is because we\ntake people who have muddy water and we\nhelp them clear it up and since other\npeople watch that process like they can\nclear up their own thoughts whereas if\nsomeone comes in with fully formed\nthoughts that's very clear and\nunderstands themselves like that doesn't\nhelp us like our audience wants to be\nthat person but they don't know how to\nget there so let me put it to you this\nway like what do you think would help\npeople more watching an out-of-shape guy\nget into shape or watching an in shape\nguy talk about how he's in shape in the\nattitude guys absolutely so that's what\nwe're here for we're here for your muddy\nthoughts we're here for your half-formed\nthoughts like that's what we want man\nand and like it's not weird I'm not\nexpecting you to have everything figured\nout if you you know if you had\neverything figured out when you would go\non a show like you would go on Destiny's\nstream and like debate it right like\npeople on destinies\nstream like know what they know and they\nknow what they think and their their\nbeliefs are firmly held like that's why\nthis is the opposite like I want people\nwho don't understand what on earth they\nthink because I don't understand one on\nearth you think look we're coming\nwe're starting from ignorance not\nknowledge like that's what the stream is\nall about it's about ignorance like I\nstart by asking you a question like\nwhat's an insult because people think\nI'm an expert but I don't think you guys\nget this like do you think I'm an expert\nwhat beautiful so you guys do get it\nright so you we don't expect you to know\nthings and I'm thrilled to hear this\nbecause this is a weight off my\nshoulders because I'm terrified that you\nguys think I have answers I don't have\nanswers I have questions yeah I know\nthat you have questions no answers\ngreat based off the other streams\nbecause you know you never see do you\nsay you think you can help somebody\ndon't say you know you can help so\nabsolutely so who's got the answers here\nthey Mir you me absolutely and so you\nmay not know that you have the answers\nor you may not know what they are yet\nbut my role is to help you figure out\nwhat answer you know by asking you\nquestions and that starts with you\ngiving us crappy answers here's how this\nworks\nI ask you a question you give me a\ncrappy answer I ask you another question\nyou give me a slightly better answer and\nwe do that for about an hour and then\nhopefully laughs Mansour's who knows\nwhat do you think about that\ndamn it makes sense can I rely on you to\ngive me just shitty ass answers yep\nawesome dude thank you very much so let\nme ask you this how long have you been\nin itself pretty much okay so so and\nalright like could you explain a like\nthe red pill blackwell stuff cuz I think\nthat might help I don't know what that\nis\nnow then don't worry but yeah well if\ngets out can you explain it no I just\nhate people talk about it it's like your\nassistant asked me about it but okay I\ndidn't know what I don't understand what\nblack pill is but I can explain to you\nwhat I know\nso when I was in college there's this\nthing that started becoming popular\ncalled pickup artists or the PUA\ncommunity and these were people that\nthought that essentially getting laid or\npicking up a girl for a short term\nsexual satisfaction was like a skill and\nI think they're right in a sense right\nso like being able to convince someone\nto have sex with you is sort of like\nbecoming is like selling a car like it's\na skill that you can learn and so what\nhappened is I think that they took what\nwas then the insel community and gave\nthem a light of hope they said that you\ncan get laid too and all you have to do\nis like work with us and we're artists\nwere pickup artists so we're gonna get\nand they can't started coming up with\nall of these in my opinion pseudo\nscientific concepts they think that\nthey're scientific concepts maybe we'll\nget there I'm not really sure I'm not an\nexpert in that stuff and and they\nstarted coming up so they started like\nexplaining to people that like you're an\ninsulin there's like biology involved\nand it's anyway so like they started\nsort of supporting their things with\nscientific theories and then over time I\nthink this became the red pill community\nand my understanding of the red pill\ncommunity is that they're a group of\npeople who believe that men have falsely\nbeen lured into a perception about the\ndynamics between men and women so that\nlike there are some value judgments like\nmarriage and monogamy which are not like\nwhich are sort of like I don't really\nunderstand this stuff but the best way I\ncan put it is that like some of the\nassumptions that we have about the\nrelationships between men and women are\nactually false and this is an analogy\nfrom the matrix about like do you want\nto live in a world of false comfort or\ndo you want to face reality and take the\nred pill and see things as they are so\nin that kind\nof idea they sort of say that like you\nknow some of these like monogamy and\nother kinds of concepts or like blue\npill concepts and then so that's a big\npart of red pill and I think the other\nbig part of red I mean there are lots of\nbig parts of red pill but as best as I\ncan understand there is also this\nconcept of alphas and betas which is\nlike an alpha is like a Chad and and so\nthat means like a dude who can get women\nand a beta is a dude who either cannot\nget women or gets women in a way that\nsacrifices a lot of his power and\nthere's like there's like power dynamic\nI think really alpha and beta is not\nabout getting laid the best I can\nunderstand it's about a power dynamic\nbetween men and women and that's what I\nunderstand I actually literally do not\nknow what black pill is so like at some\npoint maybe in the early like 2010-2011\nI sort of like lost track of the\nevolution of the pickup artists or red\npill community which I was at in essence\nlike sort of a part of in the sense that\nI had friends who were really into\npickup artists and I like read some of\ntheir stuff and things like that because\nI couldn't get a girlfriend how old are\nyou by the way I'm 21 yeah so like I I\nhad real I had never really dated a girl\nby the time I was your age and you know\nI went to college and like my freshman\nand sophomore year I like tried to date\nwomen and it just ended catastrophic ly\nevery single time yeah like I think I'm\nlike a like a beta but what does that\nmean I don't well as you said somebody\nthat uh isn't outgoing you know isn't\ndoesn't approach women I can't chat them\nup yeah Sarah and I think I'm just a\nbeta that doesn't seem it doesn't like\nsuck up to women or anything like that\nokay so what is what does that mean suck\nup to women what I mean just treat them\nlike royalty out of there okay how do\nyou treat women uh just like I would a\ndate\nis normal okay she's like human a human\nhuman a human and and what about where\ndoes the misogyny come in there because\nthat doesn't sound very misogynistic me\nat all I mean some women they have like\negos or like yeah baby what what do we\ngo to sickle women do to man\nsome depends well some lead him on some\nhow does that work and well why would a\nwoman lead on a man what does that look\nlike and like what it for Lester Otis\nwhat is leading a dude on look like it\njust looks like just teasing with him\njust playing with him just like giving\nhim false heart and then and then only\nusing him for her benefit yeah yeah does\nthat happen to you yep can you tell us\nabout that yeah\njust a situation where those friends of\na cheek we got along the look but yeah I\nwas asleep\nlast year okay can you tell us about her\nyou don't have to give like identifying\ndetails but like like what kind of\nperson was she like what did you like\nabout her she's hot okay the most\nimportant thing yep we got along I mean\nlike like we like thought alike\nwe how did you guys meet\nthrough a friend like Oh interesting\nwell no we met we I went clubbing with\nher and then after that yeah\nbasically huh do betas go clubbing no\nbut I do well I'm a beta vote linkage Oh\ninterest I don't like clubbing but I'm\nshipping it but yeah I'm surprised to\nhear that I usually when I imagine a\nbeta I think about you know someone\nwho's in a room like this with\nelectronics and they don't go out and go\nclubbing it's weird I mean I have\nfriends and like sort of a social life\nbut Flake citizen a so you were out\nclubbing and you met her while clubbing\nyeah like whoa she's friends with my\nfriends silly he invited me out to go\nclubbing with him in like then what and\nthen I went out is he an insult your\nfriend yeah okay\nbut he's friends with hot girls I mean\nyeah he doesn't have a chance but yeah\nhe's friends with food hmm interesting\nwhy don't you think he has a chance\nbecause there's always someone better\nthan him in what wakes was looks-wise\nyeah so people who are better looking\nthan he is yeah and if there's someone\nbetter looking than he is he doesn't\nstand a chance\nyeah probably okay so what you're\ntelling me is that your perception is\nthat women choose men solely based on\nlooks I mean yeah I think it's a big pop\nI don't think solely based on looks okay\nso what else so how do you think women\nmake choices about who they date whoa\nI think looks and personality in tennis\nshoes only they like him personality\nyeah\nand how much they like them okay so\nmaybe we can kind of get to some of\nthose abstract things in a little bit\ncan can we go back to so you met this\ngirl she was a friend of your friends\nand she was hot you all were at a club\ntogether and did you interact with her\nwhen I was out Tommy I awkwardly dancing\nyeah well enough to his yeah nothing\nhappened in the back\nslit wake up when you talk to a lady\ndanced did you dance with her yeah the\nnews cringe okay how do you know it was\ncringe because it just was awkward\nyou felt awkward it was super good okay\nand so then what happens well then she\nhooked up with a black dude that was\nattracted I see at the club that night\nyep and what is what is hooking up mean\njust hooking up kissing kissing so you\nsaw them I mean yeah which doing it\ndoing this thing alright I saw I know\nthis is gonna sound bizarre Hayden but I\ndon't know what hooking up means like\nliterally I don't know if that means\nthey had sex I don't know if that means\nthey just uh just thought I'm making up\nfrom the club okay and and so did you\nwant to make out with her in the club\nyeah probably and you saw them making\nout yep and do you remember how you felt\nwhen you saw that\nI mean yep how did you feel\nmissed opportunity missed opportunity\nthat sounds like a watered down answer\nto me buddy\nI think about missed opportunities like\nso you play games dude yeah so like you\nfamiliar with this game Jedi fallen\norder or whatever yeah kind of haven't\nwatched any gameplay but yeah so yeah I\nbought this game when this kovat stuff\nwas starting and then about three days\nafter I bought the game it went on sale\nand so I felt like that was a missed\nopportunity like oh I could have saved\nlike when I think about the phrase\nmissed opportunity I sort of think about\nand maybe this is like my perception\nokay so I'm just sharing with you what I\nhear when you say that like I think\nabout like oh I could have saved 15\nbucks like man that was a missed\nopportunity I think of it like if I was\nmore confident in this like socially\nawkward and anxious I could have done\nbetter so you know didn't have to you\nknow but yeah\ndid you think that maybe you would be\nbetter if you were black yep and being\nblack is important because you'd have a\nbigger dick and look better than Tina it\nalone yeah so it would you say you don't\nhave that advantage this guy has the I\nknow it's funny what's funny about it\nit's [ __ ] weird to say isn't it say\nwe're both thinking about the dick size\nright no no oh just me yeah yeah I just\nthink about the big size when it comes\nto black man when you're you know what\nI'm sorry I said it's part of the\npackage it's part of the package yeah so\nit's like yeah you kind of think about\nthat yeah yeah for a second there I was\nlike maybe oh I guess just dr. K thinks\nabout black dicks like that's just me\nprojecting what's in your head but I'm\nsure\nawesome man so yeah so you you kind of\nthought like so what I'm seeing is that\nyou know you thought that you could have\nbeen better if you were black I mean\nlike I think part of its like social\nlike I'm just says if you're anxious and\nsocially awkward and I'm like super like\nself aware as well so then it just makes\neverything worse\nsure anxiety oh yeah no I notice it and\nthen I dance li awkwardly I don't like\nthis [ __ ] cringe like and then yeah\nthat and then yes super awkward and\ncringe well I'm not a very good dancer\nso that's pretty oh good how did you\nfeel when you saw her making out with\nthe dude I mean nice - it is what it is\nright that's a thought how did you feel\nfeel like [ __ ] what does that mean just\nsay I don't know I could have done\nbetter okay just feeling [ __ ] okay so we\ncan I'm gonna I'm gonna move us along if\nthat's okay Hayden but I just think it\nyou know I think it's worthwhile noting\nthat like feeling like [ __ ] I hear what\nyou're saying\nand I kind of know what you mean but I\nthink there are a lot of feelings there\nright so yeah like I just felt like I\nwasn't good enough yeah they're not good\nenough and also that like I'm also\ngetting a sense of powerlessness about\nthis situation like like I'm getting\nsome amount of self-loathing some amount\nof shame and also some amount of power\nso like let me take a stab at what may\nbe your thoughts are you know see you\nkind of sit like I can just imagine like\nyou're kind of dancing with this girl\nand it probably was like hard to even\nlike get up the courage to even dance\nwith her right like if you feel kind of\ncringe and awkward and like you're not\nconfident in yourself like it takes a\nlot to even take that first step and\nthen she kind of like you you put in\nlike a lot of work to like overcome your\nanxiety and you dance with her and then\nshe goes off and makes out with a black\ndude and dip and looking at that\nprobably hurts right so I'm just gonna\ntoss out like what I can imagine you\nfelt or maybe a better way to put it is\nremember the way that I felt when I\ntalked to a girl at a party when I was a\nfreshman in college and you know it was\nhard and then she ended up talking to\nanother guy or leaving with another guy\nI felt like things were unfair I felt\nlike I was cursed because you know in\nyour situation I didn't I don't remember\nhaving these particular thoughts but\nlike you know you were kind of saying\nwait because he's black this is why this\nis happening there's there's there's a\nsense of you know you're what you get is\nnot yours to control because you're not\nblack let's not judge the thoughts I see\nyou judging the thoughts are you judging\nthe thoughts what do you mean what like\nare you saying these thoughts are stupid\nno okay what do you know what do you\nthink I agree I agree with them I'm just\nthinking like just yeah nothing so I\nthink there's something about alike\npowerlessness and sort of the sense that\nthings are out of your control but the\nfunny thing is like you also blame\nyourself right language sort of doesn't\nmake sense because either it's out of\nyour control or it's in your control but\nyou manage to beat yourself up with both\nof those things it's like right hook\nleft hook you know it's like oh but like\nif you were better then she would be\ntalking to you instead of\ndude and if you were black she would be\ntalking to you so it's kind of like\nyou're screwed because you're not black\nand you're also screwed because you're\nawkward and cringe and you're anxious\nand so like it's your fault and it's out\nof your control\nthat's a terrible place to be feels yeah\nplace to be yeah I also think that um if\nI wasn't awkward and cringe I could like\nnot care as much is like like losing\nmissing that opportunity\nwell not it wouldn't be missing\nopportunity just that never happening\ncuz there's plenty more option nice I\ncould you know go laugh it no get but uh\nyeah yeah so what happened next\nnothing just said yeah Ron discord oh\nyeah now we went back to her friend's\nhouse we all slept in the same room and\nhold on we should she you and her went\nback to her friend's house and y'all\nslept in the same yeah yeah no I mean no\nbut we'll all in there because it was\nher friend's mother's house so we all\nwent back to there and that yeah we just\nwent to bed\nwatched a movie okay and then in the\nmorning telling in the morning no I just\nmade a laugh and we played games on\ndiscord you made her laugh how did it\nfeel to do that oh I'll make a little\npeople s ego but wait but yes how did it\nfeel\n[ __ ] so when I ask you how you feel and\nyour answer is I make a lot of people\nlaugh what are you doing there\nwhy do you say that what is your mind\ndoing kissa is making people laugh isn't\nreally a big deal to me alright okay I'm\nnot so sure I agree with that I mean it\nlike yeah so I'm gonna toss something\nout Hayden so I get the sense that what\nyou're doing is I asked you how you felt\nand my sense is that like you felt good\nit felt good yeah and then when I asked\nyou how you felt\ninstead of saying good you kind of\ninvalidate the way that you feel by like\nsaying it's not that big of a deal I do\nit all the time do you see that truth\nbut you're kind of stepping away like\nyou're willfully stepping away from your\npositive qualities and positive\ninteractions yeah yes missing it\nessentially yeah you're dismissing your\ngood feelings now why do we do that\nany idea to protect yourself oh wow I\ndidn't think you'd be able to get there\nHayden what are you protecting\nwhy does dismissing our good feelings\nwhat does that protect us from getting\ndisappointed very good protects you from\nhope how do you feel that Hope Haven\njust like if I told you that I think\nthat you don't have to be an insult for\nthe rest of your life how would that\nmake you feel good would it make you\nfeel bad too\nI mean okay cool\nso we'll see if I'm not actually saying\nthat yet but we'll see\nmaybe we'll get you there do you think\nyou haven't also yeah yeah I think I\nthink I have hope in the right situation\nokay so let's explore it Kim\ncan we keep talking is that okay dude so\nyou made her laugh yep did you think you\nhad a shot when you made her laugh no\nbut it was nice to make a lot I mean do\nyou and then you guys started playing\nyou added or on discord yeah we played\npub G how did you do that did you ask\nher for her desk or tidy donors mister\nand dance\ncuz uh how did you think about who the\nmessenger had a message her if you\ndidn't know well I like I like sorta\ntalk to a once before we went out so I\nkind of like kind of had an idea who she\nwas\nand then afterwards so I just knew who\nshe was and I already had a steam I'm\npretty sure from okay like ages ago\nokay like I don't really know right\nbecause like like the reason I'm\ntunneling down into this because a lot\nof times getting contact information of\nwomen is actually a hard thing for in\ncells yeah right oh when I was growing\nup I wasn't really Ninh so but I wasn't\nin so in the way that I didn't have\nrelationships but tolki two women don't\njust guess when I was growing up it was\nlike easy\nyeah pretty easy for me there's a Chad\ndeep within you yeah there's an alpha in\nthere man talking they're just girls was\neasy\nWow impress\nso then what happens so you guys start\nplaying games on on pub G oh yeah then\nya know you like her at this point not\nat this point I was just getting to know\nuh talking about [ __ ] then yeah I think\nI didn't really like it to like later on\nand it took me a while to develop\nfeelings okay what do you what started\nto happen what kind of feelings did you\ndevelop I couldn't really help it as\nwell like the feelings just uh kind of\nlike kind of trouble I got didn't want\nto feel that way but I couldn't help\nwhat feel so to be in a relationship\nwith it alright okay were you in love\nwith her yeah probably do you think I'm\ntrying to figure out why that's hard for\nyou to say or recognize\nyeah yeah sounds like you felt a lot\nyeah yeah probably yeah do in cells\nusual I mean do in cells fall in love\nwhat does that happen to them what do\nyou think no well no no I think they do\nbut then they I don't know I think they\ncan't yeah I think it happens a lot yeah\nwhat do you think and that's what I\nbecome in so yeah great thought like\nthat's what I was thinking too but can\nyou help me understand you know because\nthe last time I assumed we had the same\nthought it turned out to be very wrong\nso why do you think that falling in love\nhelps them along the path of becoming it\nan insult because I get hurt and then\nyou know they're necessarily oh no they\njust can't they don't have control yeah\nhmm what don't they have control over he\nlikes them he doesn't do you can't make\nsomeone love you back yeah so what did\nyou start doing what did you do anything\ndifferently when you started developing\nfeelings for her\nyeah outside sir would you sergeant I\nwould sound like a message rim or Oxford\nor play games well then I'll notice it\nas well cuz you know needy but well yeah\nwhat do you mean by that what does that\nmean needy\nwell like I want to play games with her\nkids I'm bored and desperate and she's\nnot so its needy on my end cuz how is\nthat bored and desperate I'm confused\nwell I had nothing but I was born in\ndesperate how do you know she has more\nbecause she's not pulling desperate how\ndo you know that though because I'm lost\nhow do you know what her social life is\nthough cuz she tells me I see ok yeah I\nmean I didn't mean to ask though I was\njust genuinely curious like you're sort\nof saying that is that what I'm seeing\nis like early on you kind of said that\nyou treat women like humans right you\ndon't treat them differently and what\nI'm seeing is like two people who enjoy\nplaying games together and generally\nspeaking people on discord or bored and\ndesperate like that's that's the average\nskort user right that's it and and even\neven the women that I've talked to her\nplayed games with who are discord also\ntend to be pretty bored and desperate\nthey tend to be like I don't see a big\ngender difference in terms of you know\nhow successful or bored people are or\ndesperate people are on discord just in\nmy own experience we're all gamers the\nend of the day but anyways so it does\nsound like she had a pretty active\nsocial life so what I'm kinda getting a\nsense of is is maybe what's needy is\nthat she had a life outside of you but\nyou were noticing that your life started\nto revolve more around her yeah I think\nwhile I was working at the time and like\nwhen he was getting bad Legos\nlike don't I was working at a factory so\nthen I'd like so old I had time to think\ncuz it was like a very boring job so\nthat made it like evil was then it was\nand I was made what even worse just\nthinking and being like obsessing kind\nof hmm and it's just creepy and weird\nbut it is what was happening obsessing\nwhat kind of thoughts were you having\nthat's just the situations where you\ncould look at so you were fantasizing\nabout how things could work yeah and and\nwhat kind of can you walk us through one\nof those and if that's too personal it\nmakes you uncomfortable we don't have to\ndo but I'm I'm just the reason I'm\nasking is because I I'm curious whether\nwhat you say is gonna resonate with the\npeople that are watching because I think\na big problem here yeah we all have\nthese thoughts but like no like you feel\nalone with those thoughts right you feel\npathetic with those thoughts and the\npoint of saying here is that you're\npathetic but you're not alone yeah right\nwe're all pathetic yeah situation oh\nthat's just\njust I think it's more like her changing\nchanging how oh no it's like I'm trying\nto remember like it thought oh how would\nthink what would you say I guess it's\nlike ego as well because like like I'll\nthink that you know I'm prettier on date\nyou know and then she she just has open\neyes or someone listens sure she just\nhas to see how good you are\nyeah okay yeah pretty much and so so you\nstart thinking about her more and more\nyeah and so you're thinking about her\nwhile you're working and then you play\ngames with her in the evening and what\nare you do you have certain hopes like\nwhat do you want to happen Hayden what\ndid you want to happen I just want to\nlive happily ever after\nabsolutely with her right yeah not with\nthe black dude she was making out no and\nand so then what happened so like you're\nthinking about having building a life\nwith her and you guys just play games\ntogether did you ever share your\nfeelings there no [ __ ] that\nwhat gets in the way of that cuz she\ndoesn't share the same feelings so\nwhat's the point\nhow do you know that kiss if she did so\nwe would be dating okay I want I want to\nput I want you to just try something for\nI know that I don't have that said stuff\nbut yep what I just said scented dumb\nbut late so so let's just assume it\nseems but it ended differently what\nsounds dumb about that\nwell you can never know what somebody\nelse is thinking yeah but that's not\nwhat actually happens in your head right\nlike you don't tell yourself you can't\nactually know what someone else is\nthinking yeah well like I'm not gonna\ntell her my feelings when she's you know\nclubbing and you know and also yeah no\nshe she tells me wait okay well when I\nwas working in the factory and I was\nlike doing about work and [ __ ] and just\nlosing my mind she she like was messaged\nme about their guy problems as well so\nthat's pretty low you know what Blair so\nthat's how I what was a low blow about\nthat let's think about that for a second\ncuz stung me yeah what's what's not oh\nyou're not the one she's having guy\nproblems with yeah well I mean if you\nwant if you want to be the guy she's\nhaving guy problems with you can just\ntell her what your feelings are then you\nguys can have a problem\nright you could become part of the drama\nman well I sit on sidelines I don't know\nif that's a problem that I want but\nlet's think about that for a second\ncuz you're saying like I want to be the\nguy that she texts loser in sells about\nbecause she's having problems right you\nwant to be in that role no I don't I\ndon't we message brother [ __ ]\nokay you don't want to be messaged about\nthat [ __ ] but you want to be the [ __ ]\nyou want to be the [ __ ] that she's\nmessaging other dudes about yeah yeah\ntrue enough right so like like she has\ndrama with dudes and you don't want to\nhear about that because you want to be\nwith her why is she sending you those\nmessages because I'm a pretty\nstraightforward and honest person saying\nI guess she believes my opinion you're\nstraightforward and honest really maybe\nenough to you but when we're friends\nyeah no I apologize I didn't mean to I\nwas just really confused because what\nI'm hearing from you is like you had\nthese feelings and you were anything but\nstraightforward or honest yeah just\nthose feelings here so so I'm not trying\nto make a value judgment on you as a\nwhole I'm just like it I just surprised\nto hear you say that because it sounds\nlike you were playing one you know you\nwere interacting with her in a\nparticular way and you were thinking\nabout her in a different way yeah so\nthen what happened did you feel like\nlike she was leading you on at this\npoint\nno I just thought it sucks but yeah it\nsounds I think to be in love with\nsomeone who sends you text messages\nabout other dudes yep\nthat's so now we get back to what you\nwere saying like I asked you how does\nthat feel and you're like shitty is like\nokay I got it now since like it feels\nshitty yeah yeah it does so what\nhappened then um what happened next\njust like\nI'm like we we hang out we hanged out\nlike once so it was we went to the city\nand just went shopping and then after\nthat I asked to hang it again and then\nshe ditch me of your clubbing I was like\n[ __ ] II can't\noh sorry might ditched you to go\nclubbing well like we set up playing\nstood like a guard for a drink'll gonna\nhang out and like I'm not made out but a\nDana and then she bailed on me to get\nclubbing with a friend you should rather\ndo it and I was like yeah that's kind of\nshitty when did she bear like the same\nday or like like that well uh it was\nlike the day before so what did she say\nwe got message her about Italy yeah we\nstill we still gonna hang out but she\nspelled what did she saying she just\nsaid it wasn't on my mind I forgot about\nit I'm going clubbing\nmmm not about it or forgot about you sir\ndifference that's what I'm wondering\nsounds like there isn't it pretty much\ncuz you don't forget anything about her\nwell right so like it's like you she\nspends most of her time I mean you spend\nmost of your thought or you spend a lot\nof your thoughts thinking about her like\nif you guys had had plans you would\nnever forget it pretty much it feels\nlike you're an afterthought to her yep\nlike if it feels to me like she doesn't\nvalue you as a person\nit pretty much and how does it feel to\ncare a lot about a person who doesn't\ncare a lot about you\nI mean it is one of these it feels [ __ ]\nbut I can't make them feel sit away sir\nit's nothing I can do about it you can't\nmake them feel the same way so there's\nnothing you can do about it I don't know\nif I agree with that but we'll get there\nI'm kind of curious ooh so then you know\nyou say [ __ ] you see word that is\nemitted on twitch because it is\noffensive and then what happened and\nthen we just stop talking and then after\nthat like we haven't talked for like a\nand then we started talking like legit a\nmonth ago when you say he stopped\ntalking that means when you stopped\nmessaging her oh yeah I just tried\nforgot about it and she just you know\ndidn't message me either\nso actually yeah so let me ask you\nsomething did it feel like you were\ndoing most of the work of communication\nlike you were you would start all the\nDMS and then she would receive you was\nthere a part of you that was kind of\npaying attention to if I don't message\nher how long is it gonna take her to\nmessage me yeah definitely yeah and then\nwhen she didn't message you for a week\nor two did you feel like you were right\nall along and like you were putting more\ninto this relationship than she was and\nshe actually does I mean about I felt\nwell I didn't you it neither at that\npoint but yeah it would wouldn't make me\nfeel that yeah and so was she leading\nyou on\nno I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't say so\nwhat did she do to you hey me\nSpiritualist my friend\nthis that doesn't make that doesn't\nanswer my question at all I don't like\nit sounds like she did something to you\nhow do you feel about her now\nnow just you still I don't really have\nthat no no really\nwell it's more like I don't think I'd\nstill love her or anything okay what why\nare you smiling\noh there's no reason\nit's just wait cause we're friends are\nwe gonna watch this and it's pretty\nnerve-wracking your friend not friends\nyour friend see this holy [ __ ] she's uh\nI hope she never sees this be painful\nwhat would be painful about it should be\nweird what would be weird about it\nbecause I would the I'm irrelevant in\nher head and then it's kind of like\ncreepy is it uh what's creepy about it\nOh me talking about her when she does a\njust no clue sure but what comes off\ncreepy okay can I think for a second\nyeah sure so first of all huge props to\nyou for saying all this stuff because I\nmean if your friends are gonna watch it\nthen that's like holy [ __ ] man I didn't\neven realize that you know yeah I guess\nI should have put on the two together\nthat if you guys game together there's\nlike a small chance that she is aware of\nwhat we are I'm not sure now a\nfriendship\ngood friends are hurt they won't tell\nher yeah okay I mean sure okay so what\nis it well so let me ask you the same\nwhat does it like to share this story\nlike how do you feel like having talked\nabout this I don't never really talked\nabout it so it's kind of new to me good\nwhat is what do you think like it's like\nwe're playing a game for the first time\nyou're like oh I've never played this\ngame before like what do you think about\nthis game what do you think about\ntalking about the things that you've\nkept locked up inside total noise it's\nkind of wait\nit's go to it yeah so we knew you were\ngonna say that\nright so it sounds like you're confused\nabout what to feel or that you're\nfeeling things that are unfamiliar\nthat's what we really mean it's a novel\nexperience you I don't know how I feel\nso what I'm getting from you is that you\nhaven't become unburdened I'm not\ngetting that at all\nwhich is perfectly fine and I'm not\ngetting any sense of positivity or\nnegativity what I'm getting a sense of\nis like this is new for me yeah what's\nhappening like okay let me just think\nfor a second\nso having talked through this story are\nthere any kind of like thoughts or\nreflections that kind of pop up about\nyourself like if you are listening to\nthis this is kind of a weird question\nit's sort of like I read my mind\nquestion so if it doesn't make any sense\ndon't worry about it\nbut like I'm just wondering like has\nanything kind of popped up to you is\nlike odd or something that you want to\nthink about or maybe explore or what\nwould you say to yourself having heard\nthis story I mean I just think my\nthoughts really haven't changed much\nsure\nwould you like how about it yeah oh\nsorry god I feel bad it's no different\nokay and any fellow would like my\nthoughts to change yeah maybe yeah\nokay so Hayden is it okay if I sort of\ntalk a little bit more and kind of take\nout like ask you fewer questions for a\nlittle bit\nyes so I still don't understand exactly\nwhere the the misogyny comes from like\ndo you believe that all women are gonna\ntreat you like she did do you believe\nthat if you interact with women in the\nfuture that you're gonna end up in the\nsame place I mean I think I've high\nstandards said I could so yeah I would\nend up in that situation what do you\nmean you have high standards what's that\nmean I go for attractive sort of like\nthere's a lot of people going after the\nsame person yeah yeah I just just uh\nwould you be okay with lower standards\nprobably not okay I don't think so\nJapan would you date a girl who's a five\nout of ten\nprobably know why not which is\nI'm not attracted to them okay\nso I don't think you have to be an\ninsult let me start with this can I\nshare some thoughts with you about that\nyou're welcome to you know SWAT them\ndown as they pop up the first thing is I\nthink a lot of your conceptions are in\nyour head like I think the reason that\nyou believe you're an insult is because\nyou set yourself up with a scenario that\nis unwinnable like the reason that it's\nnot your like you you give up your power\nbasically which is bizarre so like you\nfeel powerless but like you're the one\nwho's actually giving it up and the\nsimplest thing is that you have no idea\nhow she feels but you make assumptions\nbased on what you observe about what her\npreferences are so I think this is a big\nproblem what are you thinking you're\nsmiling I mean yeah no great I'm just\nthinking about those situations like\nwhat just kind of caught me off guard\nokay I was just thinking of it that's a\nsituation so kind of evident like what\ndo you what do you what any of those\nsituations are evident what cynics me\nlike message me but the dude that she's\nobsessed with so why would I\nI mean yeah so that's the that's the\nreason why I think that she doesn't like\nme\nsure so so so I I agree with that I\nthink that that actually kind of makes\nsense because I think at some point you\nguys became friends if she didn't have\ntoo much of a romantic interest in you\nyep so let me kind of share a couple of\nother things so I think that like are\nyou familiar with like all of this you\nknow like mate selection theory that\npeople like insult like you guys talk\nabout that and insult communities like I\ndon't know I mean if you're part of\ninsel communities or not no okay\nno okay so you know III think\nbasic issue here is that you know you're\nsomehow assuming her feelings and you're\nsomehow also assuming that she\nunderstands yours I mean I don't think\nshe understands Milan but okay\nso if she doesn't understand your\nfeelings does she have a choice to date\nyou or not so like actually forget about\nthat question let me ask you a different\nquestion so let's assume that y'all's\npositions are reversed so let's say that\nshe hangs out with you she saw you at\nthe club and then she starts to have\nlike a little bit of a crush on you\nyou seem to be dancing with her but you\ndemonstrate no romantic interest so\nfeeling hurt she goes to the first guy\nthat she can find and she starts to make\nout with him and then at the end of the\nnight she doesn't go home with that guy\nshe goes with her friend with you you\nguys sleep in the same room together and\nthen you all talk you make her laugh she\nstarts crushing on you a little bit and\nthen you never ask for her number and\nthen you messenger on discord and she's\nwaiting for that and every time you\nmessage she responds you guys start\nplaying games together she starts to\ndevelop feelings for you and she's\nwaiting for you to ask her out and you\nshare some kind of feeling and\nshe has these feelings for you that you\nnever see I just didn't believe she had\nfeelings I think we're just friends I\nunderstand that you don't believe that\nbut if you can hide your feelings from\nher\nwhy can't she hide her feelings from you\nI think like you see what I'm saying\nlike if if you can if you can hide\nfeelings from another human being why do\nyou assume that you know her feelings\nlike where does that thought come from\nand I'm not telling you to abandon the\nthought because it's illogical I'm\ngenuinely asking us I think it comes\nfrom somewhere right that's like this is\nwhere I'm not trying to prove you wrong\nI'm trying to point out to you that you\nhave a strong belief that she does not\nlike you and that belief comes from\nsomewhere but it doesn't come from her\nyou see that like she you can't know\nwhat's coming from her she can let you\nknow that she does like you but she may\nlike you and you may not be able to\ndetect it what do you think about that\nyeah I can yeah I could see that so then\nthe question becomes if it's possible\nfor her to like you and you to not know\nwhy don't you think about it that way\nyou don't think about it that way how do\nyou think about it when I tell you\nHayden\nthere's a chance that she liked you all\nalong what is the instinctive response\nthat you have to that statement\nforget about logic just can't believe it\nabsolutely good right so like your\nresponses you're [ __ ] crazy man yeah\nthere's no way that's true right that's\nwhat your responses you're like sure\nlogically it could be true but you\nweren't there and you really don't know\nit's impossible is that how you feel\nit's impossible yeah\nit's impossible that she could like you\nyeah pretty much it okay so then yeah\nthat's the stuff oh not really\nwait I'm not 100% but nowadays yeah\nunder cent yeah so then the question\nbecomes where did you start to believe\nthat you are unlikable that she couldn't\npossibly be interested in you because\nthat's that's a belief right like that's\na belief you have about yourself that\nthere's no way that she could like you\nyeah I just think I'm like insecure\nwhere does that come from from from my\nlife remember it childhood growing up\njust situations yeah okay so can can we\njust think for a moment that like so\nlike even if what I say is like you so\nyou you have this firm belief that\nsomeone like her can't like someone like\nyou you can get a five to like you\nbut you can't get it hate to like you\nyeah right like that's what you think so\nI think I'm not good enough\nyep absolutely you know looks good in\nlooks too like you know yeah I mean sure\nI mean you're not you know fine and and\nso so my still my sense though is that\nlike so I think you made a couple of\nmistakes here the first is that you\ndidn't share your feelings with her and\nwhy didn't you do that because I didn't\nthink I was good enough yeah you see\nthat but the thing is like I know you\nbelieve you're not good enough and I\nthink that's a fair belief but there's a\nchance you're wrong\nright like how do you know it's like\nyou're making a judgment for her about\nwhether you're good enough like you're\nnot actually letting her choose whether\nyou're good enough you're deciding for\nher it's kind of like if you come over\nand I'm baking a pie and then like\nyou're at my house and I like pull the\npie out of the oven and then I look at\nthe pie and I'm about to offer you piece\nof pie but I'm like oh this pie is [ __ ]\nlike you may like that pie that pie may\nbe good but I'm I'm just I'm gonna make\nthat choice for you I'm gonna say this\npie is [ __ ] and I just throw it in the\ntrash and I don't even offer you a piece\nbecause I I don't have confidence like I\njust started baking pies a couple days\nago I follow recipes they're not very\ngood does that make sense\nbeautiful all right so the first thing\nto understand is that in sell like what\nI'm hearing from you is not that like\nyou're you know you don't need to be a\nblack guy because the problem isn't it\nthe problem is that you're not a black\nguy the problem is that like you\nfundamentally don't believe that you\ndon't act like you don't even give her a\nchance man\nand so the funny thing is that that\nbecomes a self-fulfilling prophecy you\nmeet girl after girl after girl and you\ndon't give him a chance and you don't\ngive him a chance and you don't give him\na chance and then you wind up alone and\nthen you start to hate them as\nthe class but this is like this is like\nI bake a pie you come over and I'm like\nthis pie is [ __ ] and then I throw it\naway and then the next day you come over\nand I'm baking another pie I pull that\nout of the oven and I'm like this pie is\n[ __ ]\nthen I throw it away then the next day\nyou come over and I bake a third pie and\nI say this is [ __ ] and then what happens\nis that night when I'm lying in bed and\nI'm like no one likes my pies it's\n[ __ ] this guy has come over three\ntimes and I've not he's not told me he's\nnot giving me a single compliment about\nmy pie does that analogy fit or not yeah\nbut what do you do when she doesn't want\nyou [ __ ] put exactly like like hey like\nwhat do I do like you don't want my [ __ ]\npie right yeah like you don't want my\n[ __ ] pie so I'm not gonna offer you a\npiece because I know you don't want it\nso I'm gonna throw it away and you're\ngonna come over the next day I'm gonna\npull another one out of it I'm gonna\nthrow that one away like exactly what do\ni do Hayden because you don't want my\n[ __ ] pie I don't know just how can I get\nyou to like my pie make it better\nabsolutely that's your strategy so day\nnumber four rolls around I'm gonna make\nit even better and I'm gonna pull it out\nof the oven and I'm gonna say to myself\noh this is still [ __ ] it's not that much\nbetter than yesterday I haven't changed\nmy recipe that much and you're gonna\ncome over you're gonna sit on my\ncountertop\nyou're gonna sit in my table I'm gonna\nthrow the pie away because it's not good\nenough and then I'm gonna say tomorrow\nit's gonna be better and then I'm gonna\nmake it better or I'm not gonna make it\nbetter because like I'm a piece of [ __ ]\nand I've made the best buy that I\npossibly can and then I'm gonna I'm\ngonna still tear my hair out because you\ndon't like my pie\nhow do I get you to like my pie Hayden\nyou make it better I've done that five\ntimes six times I can't make it any\nbetter you can't make yourself better\nthen you can't you just can't make them\nlike you pie okay in this scenario I\nthink the problem is that you've never\ntasted my pie you get that you know if\nyou don't like if you don't taste it\nexactly but am I ever offering you a\npiece of pie maybe I haven't been clear\nyeah no Dan I get it comes from it yeah\nas you come over and what I do is I pull\nthe pie out of the oven I throw it\nstraight in the trash and then I say\nokay Hayden I'll see you tomorrow and\nthen you come over the next day because\nI want the pie to be perfect I want to\nbe perfect before I'm even gonna give\nyou a taste and then I get upset because\nyou don't like my pie but I've never\ngiven you any pie to try what do you\nthink about that I mean I just think\nwhat if you make a really good pun you\ngive it to them and they don't like it\nwhat if right that's why I'm not giving\nyou the pie because I'm afraid that you\nwon't like it\nand I want it to be good enough I want\nto guarantee that you're gonna love the\npie I want it to be perfect because if\nthe pie is perfect and I give you a\npiece then you can't say you don't like\nit the only security that I need is a\nguarantee that you're gonna love my pie\nand until I get that I'm not willing to\ngive you a piece does that make sense\nyeah\nthe only way you would share your\nfeelings with her is if you were sure\nshe felt the same way about you\nright yeah\nnow that's that's a bit of a pickle why\nis that what's the problem with that\nHayden well it's just it gets to try you\nbut absolutely so this is the other\nthing is like you actually don't know\nlike you've ever had a girlfriend before\nno so like are you a good boyfriend I've\nknown T is that how you feel\nyeah kind of\nso I imagine that you feel like you're\nnot a good boyfriend that you're not\ngood boyfriend material I don't think\nthat I would be surprised if that it's\nreally I don't know yeah yeah I think\nit's reasonable to say I don't know\nbecause you have no experience yeah no\nexperience I've nothing to base it off\nright so you could be good or it could\nbe bad yeah pretty much right are you\ngonna be great at it what do you think\nI could be I could not oh yeah so I\nthink honestly hating the chances that\nyou're gonna be great at it or pretty\nlow yeah you know why I think that no\nexperience absolutely but I do think\nthat if you work at it you're gonna get\nbetter\njust like pub G yeah I kind of in a\nmentality as well with I don't really\nwant a girlfriend until well beautiful\nfor me I don't need to hear I don't need\nto hear anything else this is the\nproblem I don't want a girlfriend until\nyeah I know what's after that is [ __ ]\nirrelevant you see that the problem is\nthe word until I don't want you to taste\nthe pie until XYZ it makes sense so I\ndon't want a girlfriend until dot dot\ndot so Hayden I think the reason you\ndon't have a girlfriend is because\nyou're not ready I'm not ready to let\nyou try my pie you see that it's not\nlike women is a race or not\ndiscriminating against you because\nyou're black although that's a\ncomforting theory because then it\nabsolves you of responsibility you can\njust hate them in the corner of your\nhome and like uh the world is a terrible\nplace because I'm not a black dude and\n[ __ ] those people and [ __ ] those people\nand [ __ ] those people that's easy man\nit's a very very comforting little world\nyou built for yourself right it's a safe\nplace because you don't have to put\nyourself out there you don't have to get\nhurt because if you never tell her how\nyou feel\nshe can't reject you but she can and she\ndoes but like that's the thought that\nyou have right like if you tell her how\nyou feel like what happens if she\nlike the pie what happens if she says I\ndon't feel the same way about you I\ndon't know what happens after that\nso never experience that is that how you\nfeel you're sounding way too rational to\nme my friend I mean that's how I feel\nyeah well that's good right because then\nlike if that's genuinely like if you're\ngenuinely like I really don't know what\nhappens after that\nbecause what I was hypothesizing is like\nthe world comes tumbling down around you\nlike everything falls apart\nand and now I'm projecting cuz like I\nremember when I liked a girl there was\nlike there was a girl that I was like\nreally really into my freshman year and\nwe were friends and I never told her how\nI feel felt because I was [ __ ]\nterrified yeah I think if I would open\nup it just feel like and she says no\njust be like hey correct like saying\nthem correct about main Security's\nabsolutely so yeah very good right so\nyou have a fear that you're unlovable or\nwe'll never be able to find a girlfriend\nand you will you will never risk that\nbeing true to you and instead what\nyou're gonna do is never test that\nhypothesis and by not ever testing it\nyou're going to reinforce it with each\ngirl that you meet it's a hypothesis\nthat's never put to the test but becomes\nmore and more fact it's [ __ ] weird\nthat's not how we handle hypotheses what\nwe do is we test them but here's the\nproblem with testing a hypothesis when I\nhave a hypothesis I don't know that it's\nwrong when I test the hypothesis what\nhappens what do I put on the table\nanswers absolutely\nthat's what you're avoiding buddy you\nsee that which are terrified of is not\nwomen it's answers you're afraid of what\nit could show so now I've got a question\nfor you Hayden what are you gonna do\nwhat do you want to do what do you wish\nyou could do I wish I could just know\ngive a [ __ ] good but you can't yeah what\ndo you wish what else do you wish you\ncould do anything else by not to give a\n[ __ ] do you mean not care about any of\nthis stuff or be willing to put answers\non the table like be willing to test\nyour hypotheses well but yeah yeah Birds\nso very concretely now that you are\ndealing this girl again you gonna tell\nher anything well okay so can I help you\na little bit there yeah so when you know\nI think you and probably most of twitch\nat is thinking that what I want you to\ndo is tell her how you feel and that's\nwhat I want you to do but I don't think\nthat's gonna look like what you think it\nlooks like so here's the conversation\nthat I think is gonna help you the most\nand I think it's not gonna be quite as\nterrifying is you you think I'd be\nreally surprised if you can accurately\npredict what's gonna come out of my\nmouth I'm gonna toss this out there okay\nand I just want you to think about it\nyou don't have to do it so it's not tell\nher hey I used to be in love with you\nand I was obsessing about you for years\nhere watch this Twitter stream that's\nnot what I'm saying right so I think\nthis is the big thing it's like people\nthink like the other problem\nHayden is that your options of\ncommunication with her or tell her\neverything or tell her nothing that\nneeds to change\nthat's the thing that needs to change\nthe conversation that I think would help\nyou the most and not because it's gonna\nget her to fall in love with you but\nbecause it'll help you grow as a person\nis hey our friendship meant a lot to me\nand I was hoping to have like a\nconversation with you about it and I\nrealize now that I had some feelings for\nyou that were like more than friendship\nand I was hoping we could just kind of\ntalk that through and then you tell her\nbecause now you're in a safe place\nbecause you're not in love with her\nanymore right there is still feeling\nthat changes everything I'm gonna assume\nfor a moment that you're not in love\nwith her because if you're not in love\nwith her then like you don't it's not\ndoesn't matter if she likes your pyre\ndoesn't like your pie yeah I think the\nconversation you need to have with her\nis like hey you know I've always thought\nyou're gorgeous and I I value our\nfriendship but I also had some feelings\nwith you for you and then there was one\nthing that happened we had plans and I\nfelt like you blew me off and that was\nvery hurtful and and so then like I know\nwe've kind of been out of contact and I\nrealize now that that was because like\nit hurt me when you did that I felt like\nI wasn't important to you and you were\nimportant to me what do you think about\nthat conversation\nI'll just think yeah I've had that\nconversation in my head before they I've\nhad sure conversation of flake\nconfessing this no I'm not talking about\nconfessing that's not confessing your\nlove are you hearing that is what I'm\nsaying that's not what I'm saying\nwhat do you say I'm gonna say it again I\nwant you to have a conversation about\nyour mixed feelings about her isn't it\nconfessing no because confessing is\nconfessing your love to her it's\nconfessing a unit dimensional feeling my\nfeeling my mixed feelings yes so you say\nlisten to what I'm saying so like Hayden\nI value it like so you know I've always\nthought you're gorgeous and I value our\nfriendship and I really like hanging out\nwith you and I enjoyed like you know\njust being friends with you and I also\nnoticed that like over time I started to\nhave some romantic feelings towards you\nand I don't know exactly what happened\nthere but at some point you know there\nwas this one plate time where we had\nplants like go hang out and then you\nkind of forgot about him and you you\nknow I felt like you sort of didn't\nvalue me like I you know I was just\ndisappointed and hurt when you kind of\ncancel plans and it took me some time to\nsort of figure that out I'm glad we're\ntalking again I just wanted to share\nsome of those thoughts or feelings with\nyou and like see kind of what you think\nwhat are you hearing there are you\nhearing I I mean yeah I'm just thinking\nabout it what does that fit what does\nthat sound what does that sound like to\nyou\nthat sound like a confession of love\nsaying that you have mixed feelings to\nme it's like a confession okay\nhow so cuz you're telling them that you\nhave mixed feelings so that's sure let's\nsee yeah but you're confessing what are\nyou confessing to them that you have\nmixed feelings that's it or that you had\nmixed feelings you can even put it in\nthe past tense\nyeah like that you have some feelings\nbut like you want to share the mixed\nfeelings right because then what you\nwant to do with the beauty of this\nconversation she can go either way\nshe can say yeah your friendship matters\nto me too and I don't have romantic\nfeelings for you and then you cry or but\nyou'd be surprised or if she says by the\nway I sort of have mixed feelings for\nyou too and then the interesting thing\nthere is that you're gonna want to go to\nlike one of two places either you're\nwanting you're gonna want to jump for\njoy or you're gonna want to be\ncompletely crushed I don't want you to\ndo either of those I want you to sit in\nthe blend right and then you guys have\nanother conversation about it do you\nwant to just be friends or do you want\nto try to like try to date and you talk\nit through with her so the problem here\nHayden is that you're making all of\nthese decisions and shouldering all of\nthe responsibility for y'all's\nrelationship you're holding all of it do\nyou see that she like doesn't get to\nplay a role you're dealing with an NPC\nnot a party member it makes sense so I\nthink what you've got to do is like let\nher have some agency in this\nrelationship and give her a chance to\nvoice your feelings and by the way you\nknow when we're talking about like\nthings that women are looking for it I\nknow a lot of people have perceptions\nthat it's money or looks or other kinds\nof things but I would say 90% of\nsuccessful relationships that I've seen\nhave men who are emotionally available\nthis is a concept that in cells in red I\nthink red pillars don't understand they\nthink it's bata behavior it's not baby\ndo you even know what emotional\navailability is no not really\nokay so like what I talked about the\nconversation that I just gave to you is\nemotional availability it's the ability\nto like think like a woman basically and\nsort of like think like not in terms of\nblack and white but in shades of grey\nthat relationships are complicated and\nnuanced things where like there's shared\ndecision-making it's not like alpha and\nbeta it's not like you you trick her\ninto sleeping with you or you make her\nsleep with you there's like no agency\nit's all like you're it's like you're\ninteracting with the Insull red pill\ncommunity as best as I understand it\nwhich I'm not an expert by any means so\nsomeone does understand it better please\nexplain it to me it's almost like they\ntreat women like NPCs like they don't\nacknowledge that there is like a\nthinking feeling person there that can\nmake their own choices and you accept\nall of the responsibilities about\nwhether she's gonna like like this is\nthe thing you gotta understand man you\ncan bake a perfect pie and someone can\nnot like it you can bake an imperfect\npie and someone can love it because\nthere's no such thing as a perfect pie\nright if I'm baking an apple pie\nsome people like it's sweeter some\npeople like it more sour like people\nhave individual preferences and you're\nnot even letting her choose okay it\nmakes sense so the next part if there's\ngonna be a part two and this is where I\nencourage you to think a little bit and\nI'll you know I'll give you a chance to\nask questions and stuff but my next\nquestion to you is like where did you\nlose your confidence because this whole\ninsel thing is gonna come tumbling down\nbecause like I hope you see this it\nstarts with the basic idea that you\npresume she's gonna say no it starts\nwith the basic idea that your pie is not\ngood enough that's not a testable\nhypothesis it's a belief you have faith\nthat she's gonna say no so where does\nthat come from\nuh I think it just comes from me like\nbeing insecure\nso that's hating myself that's that's\nwhat it is that's not where it comes\nfrom where it comes from is not people\ntelling me and then like a just not\nbeing like successful sure with women\nyeah so the other thing is that anytime\nyou go through the cycle it's going to\nmake that believe stronger in your mind\ndo you see that yeah but the other\ninteresting thing is that if this is a\nbelief in your mind that is dictating\nyour relationships\nit also means like that's just a belief\nyou get that that doesn't actually mean\nit's true like if the belief can\nstrengthen it doesn't mean it's truth\nand if it comes from people telling you\nthat you're a piece of [ __ ] when you\nwere growing up like that doesn't\nactually mean you're a piece of [ __ ] it\njust means that you've been convinced\nthat you're a piece of [ __ ] there's hope\nbecause if you can dismantle that belief\nI think all this [ __ ] is gonna come\ntumbling down and you'll find yourself\nwith a girlfriend because I think like\nyou said at the beginning Hayden you\nwere a moderately attractive guy who\nsounds like he's funny\nand can you land an 8 maybe maybe not\nyou absolutely can by the way thanks but\nI think your bigger problem is that\nyou're not willing to consider a 5 right\nthat is ego like you have this\nperception that you want this thing in\nlike in the same way that you want her\nto notice what's right in front of your\neyes omma hypocrite Yeah right but I\nknow that good I'm all ready yeah yeah\nand it's it's not just you right so like\nI saw this really interesting like psych\npsychology article about like you know\nlike there's the there are obese and\noverweight especially like women like\nthis is I mean I could be wrong\nstatistically about this but my\nperception is it's women who like want\npeople to be like accepting of all bod\ntypes so they'll post about like you\nknow there's no such thing as fat and\nthey'll be like overweight and it's\nusually women these social media has led\nme to believe that the paper that I\nlooked at was looking for nominally\nwomen and the funny thing is that like\npeople who women who want men to accept\nthem for being overweight and treat them\nthe same as someone who's not overweight\nare not willing to date overweight men\nso that's common we're all like that I\nthink it's all ego questions why is it a\nproblem that I have a writing of high\nstandards because I think your standards\nare unidirectional but they're not\ncomplicated enough because I think your\nstandards don't lead to happy\nrelationships which is what I think you\nreally want someone's physical\nattractiveness is in my experience is\nnot one of the most important parts of a\nhealthy relationship so is it important\nabsolutely I'm not saying that you\nshouldn't be attractive to other people\nI mean you shouldn't change who you're\nattracted to what I'm saying is that\nlike I think you have a false standard\nof what you're looking for that's fueled\nby your ego which comes from all this\nkind of complex I mean yeah like like\nticket oh yeah exactly I think it's a\nfantasy and I think that if you know so\nlike here's that here's what I've\nobserved okay Hayden and this is\nsomething that you have to experiment\nwith yeah so I I see possibilities in\nyour life where you remain happy or you\nbecome happy or you remain alone and sad\nand I think the likelihood that you end\nup being happy in life is greater if\nyou're willing to consider someone under\n1/8 I'm not saying don't have high\nstandards I'm saying expand the scope of\nyour standards beyond physical\nTractatus so I think the average of all\nof her qualities should be greater than\nan eighth but I think someone who makes\nyou feel like you're not a piece of [ __ ]\nis worth way more than how much how\nattractive she is if there was a 10 out\nof 10 that made you feel like a piece of\n[ __ ] and abuse you but also let you [ __ ]\nher from time to time I do not like that\nas a good relationship for you yeah\nright but like there's the bottom would\nya no but like would I still now what I\nstill care about her like I'll just be\nin a six so yeah you'll be whipped then\nyou'd be a beta wit yeah you'd be a bear\nthat's then you'd be a back then I mean\nwhen like just get those [ __ ] hot\nchick thoroughly absolutely and the\ncamera as well know you'd care a lot\nbecause she'd be [ __ ] other people\ntoo and she'd make you feel like [ __ ]\nmaybe she wouldn't be [ __ ] other\npeople but I think like like healthy\nrelationships where people feel valued\nand appreciated and supportive that\ndoesn't necessarily have to do with\nphysical attractiveness right and I\nthink what you want what you really want\nHayden is not to just [ __ ] a hot chick I\nthink you want someone to love you back\nthat's what I think you want more than\nanything else I think you want someone\nwho takes away that feeling that you are\na piece of [ __ ] and unlovable and\nunattractive I think more than now I\ncan't use the f-bomb but okay okay pee\nwees there okay\nThank You lovey\nokay I'm just gonna have to remain\nsilent cuz I can't talk about this\nbefore anyway okay so I think what'll be\nmore satisfying let me put it this way\nHayden I think you may disagree with\nthis but I just want you to think about\nthis well what you're gonna find more\nsatisfying than [ __ ] a hot chick I\nthink is having a check who's moderately\nattractive who wants to [ __ ] you yeah\nwe get so caught up about wearing to\n[ __ ] hot chicks but what like makes us\nfeel good is to like have someone come\nover it's not that like my pie is the\nbest like what you want is someone who\nwants your pie right like you want\nsomeone who's gonna come up to you and\nappreciate you for who you are and like\nwant you as a person they want to be\nwith you you don't have to convince them\nto be with you you don't have to worry\nabout them being with you they want to\nbe with you that's what you want more\nthan anything else and if you have a\ncertain standard of attractiveness like\nI think that's okay if you want to end\nup only dating eights out of eight out\nof tens like I think that's fine too\nlike you can choose how you live your\nlife but I don't think you're gonna be\nhappy and it makes sense dots are\nquestions before we wrap up\nutterly I don't know if I get anything\nfrom this like I believe everything you\nsay but like I watch your other videos\nbut please never like I guess all I can\ndo is acknowledge it yep\nI think you only perception of what you\nget out of this is going to be very poor\nI think my perception I don't think\nwe've you haven't had you haven't broken\ndown crying right that's what people\nthink that like Oh to get something out\nof this you have to break down crying no\nI think what can you get have a minute\nyeah really so hey let me be very clear\nwhat you get out of this is what you do\nwith the thoughts and reflections that\nwe've come up in here with in here\nbecause in order to make change it's not\ngoing to come from a conversation it's\ngonna come from offering the imperfect\npiece of pie to someone that's what you\nlike no amount of talking to me is ever\ngoing to be a substitute for that you\nunderstand that\nlike the progress that you need is not\ngoing to come from me man\nhow do I be okay if my [ __ ] pie that's a\ngood question so I think we may have to\nhave a part two at some point but let me\nstart here so we're gonna do a little\nbit of meditation sit up straight\nclose your eyes and feel yourself for a\nsecond where is your [ __ ] pie in my\nanxiety where is that feeling in my\nchest okay what does it feel like\nnervous just tightness tightness in your\nchest right sweating quick baiting Oh\nsweating in what my house just beating\nquick quick quick beating art okay so\nthis is the [ __ ] pie right this is what\nyou're saying\nso now let me ask you Hayden if these\nfeelings were to reduce does that make\nyour pie less shitty uh kind of thing to\nStu insecurities sure I didn't say does\nit make it go away I said does it make\nit less shitty dear okay so listen let's\nstart there right so this is you're\nsaying how do I get rid of the [ __ ] pie\nand the answer is it takes time and\neffort it doesn't happen through one\nconversation so I think you need to\nstart thinking back to where you started\nto form these beliefs I think seeing a\ntherapist is a great idea or see one of\nour coaches they can help you with this\nkind of thing as soon as they're\navailable to help you with this kind of\nthing yeah and and right now I want you\nto just notice those feelings and I want\nyou to breathe into them so put your\nhead up straight neck up straight good\nthere we go\nrelax your shoulders don't hunched over\nso I want you to are you leaning against\nthe back of the chair too so I want you\nto sit forward away from the back of the\nchair\nyep how tall are you\n5:11 okay so okay so can you raise your\nchair a little bit look do you have\nanybody can sit on no no I I don't want\nto you know move I when we I wanted to\naffect your posture not your camera oh\nyeah I can sit on my pillow like Miss\nJones yeah\nsit on your pillow like Mitch Jones you\nlook like you're hunched are you hunched\nthere we go there it is issue number one\nyou're not gonna be confident if you're\nsitting like you were sitting before\nthat is the posture of a beta who is\ninsecure how do you feel now I feel like\nsitting up straight there you go so\nyou're a whole life Haydon you have not\nbeen sitting up straight you haven't\nactually been sitting the way that you\nreally are you've been sitting over\nhunched smaller than you truly are how\ndoes it feel to sit up straight\njust feels like I'm sitting up straight\nthat I don't have any feelings related\nto sit up shy okay fine so what's\nhappening in your chest\nuh I'm just puffing it out okay uh-huh\nwhat's your anxiety same same feelings\nokay so I want you to notice that those\nfeelings are sort of like operating in a\ndifferent space there's more space in\nthere now can you feel that yeah yeah I\ncan feel it so if there's more space has\nthe anxiety grown or is it sort of just\noccupying like a portion in the middle\nit's stayed the same but so is there\nspace around the anxiety that is not\nanxiety in your chest\nI think it's filling up because I'm\nthinking about it good let him so know\nwatch it filling you up sit up straight\nthere we go see as you fill up you start\nto hunch down so keep yourself straight\nif you need to now what I want you to do\nis pick up your pillow and fold it in\nhalf and then sit on it there we go\neyes closed\nnow what I want you to do is to breathe\ninto your chest and expand it maximal\nbreath hold that feel that tension and\nthen relax let your spine remain erect\nyour shoulders can relax but your spine\nshould stay straight there we go\nyou guys see what he just did with his\nhead now he's doing it right\nso I'm gonna talk to twitch chat for a\nsecond I don't know if you guys can tell\nbut Hayden is less pathetic now he may\nfeel just as pathetic but he's less\npathetic you guys can see the difference\nlike just look at him\nI know it's anxiety provoking for you so\nnow what do you feel Hayden nothing okay\nHayden's like I don't know what these\n[ __ ] guys are talking about that's\nokay\nthat's fine so what are you smiling out\nof embarrassment or absurdity or what I\njust think it's funny okay good we'll\ntake it what does the laughter do to the\nfeeling in your chest\nthought and I just I don't lean so much\nlaughing okay it's so yeah I can't tell\nyou\nokay that's okay good so breathe big and\nthen out now what I want you to do\nHayden we're gonna do Darth Vader breath\nhave you learned this before have you\nseen this before so you know how Darth\nVader breathes\nhow does he feel can you make that sound\nyeah good so\nI can't stop so I feel like a [ __ ]\nidiot good I'm glad you feel like a\n[ __ ] idiot\nyeah let's do it\nmake the noise and I want you to focus\non your throat okay I want you to\ncontract your throat and slow down the\nrate of your breathing and make that\nnoise good beautiful so sit up straight\nagain\ngood back straight head straight there\nwe go I don't know what's an you want me\nto make could you make it again okay\nyeah so just beautiful and then out\nnow as you make that sound can you feel\na contraction in your throat yeah okay\nso now what I want you to do is focus on\nthat contraction but now breathe through\nyour nose and you should hear a hissing\nsound in your head you hear the hissing\nyou know focus on the hissing\ngood\nI want you to do seven breaths and you\nhear the hiss in and the hiss out with\neach one expand the chest fully so don't\njust focus on the hissing turn on the\nhissing and then focus on your chest and\nthen exhale fully so folk turn on the\nhissing and then let your chest contract\nevery ounce of air out every gram I\nsuppose every milliliter\nand now that you're doing a good job\nwe're gonna throw you off again do you\nfeel like an idiot you know where is\nthat feeling of idiocy I can't okay\nbreathe through it four more breaths sit\nup straight\nexpand your chest\nwe're gonna throw you another curveball\nI want you to try to ignore what I'm\nsaying listen to what I'm saying\nnotice the thoughts and feelings it\nevokes and then go back to your breath\nnow you're sitting like a Chad now\nyou're sitting like an alpha I'm gonna\ntroll you harder and harder buddy\njust 12 breathe through it\nsee you were you ready for the next one\nso you thought the bad part about this\ntwitch stream was your friends watching\nthe bad part is when I asked you to\nmeditate and then make it really really\nhard for you\nsit up straight three breaths focus on\nthat contraction in your throat\nbeautiful and then out\nnow three more breaths count to seven\nfor the inhalation and seven for the\nexhalation\nbeautiful\nnow if you're done now just notice what\nyou feel\nthe anxieties there the embarrassment\nthe embarrassment is there so so now\nHayden I'm going to ask you a couple of\nlast questions so your question to me\nwas how do you do things if you're if\nyou believe your pipe tastes like [ __ ]\nso did you feel anxiety today yeah did\nyou feel embarrassment today yeah did\nyou feel like you were doing a bad job\nyeah how did you do this then\nI'm confused I thought that if you felt\nthose negative things you couldn't do\nthings right that's what you're telling\nme you're saying I have these feelings\nhow do I act but just now you had a\nbunch of feelings and I didn't make it\neasier on you just rolling you the\nentire time making you look like more\nand more of an idiot how did you do this\nI just did Oh hmm so I think your answer\nto your question now you've done it once\nI'm gonna leave it up to you to reflect\nand figure out what you did today\nbecause you came on the stream in front\nof thousands of people and aired the\ndirtiest most shameful parts of your\ninner being and you opened up you cut\nopen your pie and you showed people all\nof the [ __ ] inside alive in front of\nthousands of people how did you do that\nit wasn't easy but Edie tell you just\nhad the idea yeah you're damn right it\nwasn't easy that's why it's valuable\nbecause if this was easy then you\ncouldn't like that doesn't help you man\nwhy do you think I was making it harder\nfor you it's because like we want to\nmake it harder for you we don't want to\nmake your life easy because you're you\nwhat you're dealing with is not easy\nit's hard so we have to train you to do\nthings in spite of your emotions that\nare difficult and you've done it you've\ndone it once how did you do it I'm not\neven sure all I know is that this seems\nto work I don't know how this works I\njust know that does in something about\npeople who so this is the thing hey do\nyou part of it is getting to the root of\nwhy you feel this way in dispensing with\nthat the other half of that is not\nbothering with the root but just\naccepting that like your pie is kind of\nshitty you can have negative emotions\nbut don't let them paralyze you because\nthey don't actually control you and then\nthe more you understand and reflect upon\nwhat happened here today that dr. K like\nhe didn't teach you meditation he\ntrolled you during meditation and then\ntrolled you harder and harder and harder\nand harder and harder and yet you did it\nso how does that work I don't know but\nsomething tells me that if you can\nunderstand what happened here today\nyou'll have the answer to your question\nnow remind me again who's got questions\nand who's got answers you ask me a\nquestion who's got the answer me\nabsolutely\nany last words all right man no thanks\nLily\nyou're very welcome dude good luck thank\nyou and and if you want to watch the\nvada and really listen to what I said in\nterms of how you should consider talking\nto this girl okay really think about it\nif you could you know send me the\nmessage what do you guys I said yeah\nsure I'll I'll message you I'll send you\nsome dm's okay yeah okay take care of it\nThanks good luck Manny - we're rooting\nfor you because if you can change then\nwe can change\ngood luck sure Thanks\nall right boys and girls\nokay so okay awesome so what we're gonna\ndo\nlet me see if we want to do our late\nyo do we have time for two questions do\nwe have time for two questions yeah\nawesome let's do it oh yeah can you hear\nme look hey what's up man hey how's it\ngoing good um first off I just want to\nsay how much I appreciate the work\nyou're doing you're addressing a problem\nwithin a community that probably needs\nit the most right now in this day and\nage but uh so my question is that I was\nwondering if you had any advice for\nsomeone with low self-worth and how to\nstop comparing yourself to others yeah\nso um I think yeah so I think like I was\nkind of telling Haden there are two\npieces to that right one is that you\nhave to understand where this low\nself-worth comes from so like when did\nyou start to believe that you're like\nnot a good person and if you can go back\nto the source like when like so think\nabout when you feel ashamed about\nyourself so I'm just tossing out the\nword ashamed and what am i calling you\nbuddy uh an oral integral okay so\nintegral when you think about like when\nyou feel that shame or you find yourself\ncomparing and then you fall short right\nbecause when you compare you fall short\nof other people yeah and I guess that's\nwhy I have trouble sort of approaching\nother girls or you know I'll start\ntalking to them and then I'll just stop\nbecause I feel like they're gonna be\ndisappointed in me yeah so the first\nquestion is when was the first time you\nfelt that feeling\nI couldn't give you a time but it's just\nbasically when I I don't want to give\nyou the whole spiel but it's basically\nwhen I started behaving and and\nobserving that I'm acting just like my\nfather does and he's just somebody I\nreally don't want to be look okay so I\nthink like your journey actually starts\nwith like something it sounds like it\nstarts with something around your father\nright so I encourage you to actually\nreflect and and sort of think a little\nbit about did he make you feel a certain\nway did you watch him and feel a certain\nway and you really have to like dig in\nto that kind of stuff and I've got to\nthink a little bit about how to better\nhelp you guys structure those\nexplorations and the second thing is to\njust recognize the comparison right and\nwhen you when you're doing the\ncomparison like just like what what we\nwere doing with with Hayden you can have\nfeelings and generally speaking those\nfeelings control you but you can also\nhave like you can though they don't have\nto but we kind of feel like they do and\npeople don't understand that your\nfeelings don't have to control you until\nyou start the process of not letting\nthem control you and that happens in\nlittle little ways right so so if you're\ntrying to talk to a girl and you find\nyourself like comparing yourself to\nother people in your head and saying oh\nthis girl's not gonna like me because\nI'm not so and so so you have to start\nby finding the the lowest value\ncomparison so forget about girls but\nit's like maybe it's something like I'm\ngonna smile at the person at the grocery\nstore and then there's gonna be a small\npart of your in your voice that's in\nyour head that's gonna be like a voice\nthat's like oh you're gonna look dumb if\nyou smile at people and so you notice\nthat but the question is can you get\naway with it\ndespite the voice telling you that\nyou're gonna look dumb can you do it\nanyway because right now there's a power\nstruggle between you and that voice and\nright now that voice is winning\nso the way you start to win against the\nvoice as you take the battles that you\ncan write you're fighting a war against\nan opponent who's far stronger than you\nyou are so you don't face them in battle\nlike in an open field and get run over\nbecause that's forcing yourself to ask a\ngirl out that's gonna end terribly you\ntake you do guerrilla warfare so what\nare the small battles that you can fight\nagainst the voice that you can actually\nwin and I'd start with something as\nsimple as do you smile at people when\nyou see them well it's it's super\ninsightful again it's just like I never\nthink about that kind of thing but um\nthank you so much\nwhat for answering what the I asked you\na question do you not really I mean like\noccasionally once in a while but it's\nlike so literally integral you should\nstart by smiling at people and every\ntime you do that you're gonna run a\nlittle experiment in your head like when\nI tell you like the next person like\nwho's the neck I know it's Kovac but\nwho's the next person you're gonna see\nbesides my parents probably who said\nthat you can't smile it not sight and\nbesides onion do you smile at your\nparents ah barely I mean okay yeah I bet\noccasionally yeah you know they they\ntell me something but it's it's not like\na regular thing you know absolutely\nthat's why it's important the goal here\nis to get you to do things that you\ndon't normally do not do things that are\nregular things for you right right so\nstart by smiling at your parents it's\ngonna be feel [ __ ] weird you right\nwe're on the same page about that but\nthat's why you've got to do it okay try\npractice on them and then you'll see a\nstranger and then you can practice on\nthat so you are practicing the skill you\nare leveling up the ability you're\nleveling up your emotion resistance\nthat's what this is you guys got a\nresistant to your emotions and act\nanyway right it gives you like an attack\npenalty but you don't stop swinging just\nbecause you've got an attack penalty you\ngotta still take the swing you're gonna\nmiss because you have an attack penalty\nfine build up your emotional resistance\nyour attack penalty will decrease and\nyou'll start hitting hitting things\nhopefully women like isn't sexually not\nlike physically abuse okay I'm gonna\nstop before I get bad all right thank\nyou so much take care dude\nokay who's next who's next\nwait one one more two more one more okay\nthen I have a question hold on\nit's Randolph from the discord asks\ncould you ask dr. K how he met his wife\nif he's struggling with it or maybe it\nwas arranged that would be interesting\nto hear yeah so it was not arranged I'm\nhappy to say so I met my wife at summer\ncamp and so like I had some interesting\narmor so I really lucked out so I met my\nwife at summer camp so I went to India\nfor like three months and towards the\nend of the that time I came back to the\nUS and I went to this like Hindu summer\ncamp basically where I was gonna teach a\nlot because I had learned all this stuff\nand you know in the old country so and I\ndecided to become a monk and so the cool\nthing that so then I'd her and and she\nwas a counselor at the camp I was a\ncounselor at the camp you know I was\nteaching all this wonderful knowledge I\nhad about meditation that I've learned\nin these ashrams in these remote areas\nof India and everyone was like oh right\nbecause they're a bunch of like\nsecond-generation Indian kids at this\ncamp and so the interesting thing is I\nthink I kind of got lucky because in my\nmind like I had taken a relationship off\nof the table and so what I struggled\nwith is like I thought like I cared\nabout what women thought when I talked\nto them so I had trouble being me\nbecause I tried to be someone who was\nnot me to get them to like me more so\nthere's like real all oak and then\nthere's the all oak and real all oak\ndoesn't think that women can like him so\nhe tries to be fake all oak and it turns\nout that being fake all oak is\nunattractive to women just like most of\nthe time being a fake person is like\npeople are attracted to like\nauthenticity you know I was super\nstressed out because I was trying to\nmaintain this persona that I was not I\nwas just like faking it right and and so\nthe funny thing that happened is like\nwhen I decided to become a monk I kind\nof let that go because I was like okay\nthere's no way I'm gonna date anyone\nanyway I'm gonna become a monk right\nbecause that was the way that I\nprotected myself from the rejects\nbecause I've protected myself because if\nit's like if there's no chance that I\ncan you know if I it's like I don't have\nto feel like a reject if I'm not willing\nto date them in the first place you get\nrejected from you protect yourself from\nrejected rejection 100% when you don't\napply\nyou know you get 0% rejected from jobs\nif you apply to zero jobs zero rejection\nsafety and so the way that I did that in\nmy mind was like I was gonna take all\nthose feelings if I'm a piece of [ __ ]\nand then I said I'm bad oh I'm gonna be\na monk I'm going to give up it's not\nit's not in cell it's like voluntary\ncelibacy so I was like a vol cell and\nand so the interesting thing is that it\nturned out that like when I just was\nmyself that sometimes women find that\nattractive and then I got really really\nconfused because as I started dating her\nlike women that I was interested in for\ntwo years like at college started to\nlike hit me up whereas just like Haden a\nlot of my communications felt one-way so\nunless I reached out to them they didn't\nreach out to me and then suddenly like\nyou know a year after I'm dating someone\nI run into someone and then they're like\nand then throughout so that I got\nconfused by that for a little while and\nI wasn't really sure what was going on\nand then I got busy and tried to uh you\nknow put my life together and stop so I\ndidn't have time for that [ __ ] and then\nlike the funny thing is that even\nthroughout like med school and stuff\nlike that kept happening like and and\nyou know I just didn't care so like by\nthe time so I was older than many people\nwhen I started med school so like the\naverage age of people coming to med\nschool was like 23 24 I was 27 I got\nmarried after my first year of med\nschool or like during my first year of\nmed school and then like the really\ncrazy thing is like like so then I\nreally didn't care so like once I knew\nout like once I got engaged I was like I\nwent into med school and really didn't\ncare like there's no possibility that\nI'm gonna date anyone there because I'm\nengaged\nsounds like okay that's figured out I\nsorted through that and so I just\nstarted to be\nmyself and then suddenly like nurses\nstarted hitting on me I was like is this\njust because I'm gonna be a doctor one\nday because that's what you would think\nright but it turns out that that's not\nthe case I mean you guys can talk to\ndoctors who are in cells and they'll\ntell you that they thought that once\nthey become a doctor the women are just\ngonna be like trying to bash down their\ndoor and date them and it turns out\nunfortunately it's not true and this is\nwhere like I think people have a lot of\nlike incorrect perceptions about what\nwomen are looking for because once you\nhave friends who are doctors and in\ncells and becoming a doctor doesn't\nchange their Insull status then you\nstart to question what is it that makes\nan in cell so I think at the end of the\nday you know I met her and kind of\nlucked out because my ego had sort of\nprotected me from in a weird way had\nprotected me from like that whole\ncomplex of thinking and that's why I\nbelieve that like if we listen to Hayden\nHayden isn't actually cursed in life\nlike what's holding him back is in here\nit's not out there and the reason I\nbelieve that is because I realize like\nthe difference between me not being able\nto get a girl to date me and then like\nsuddenly falling into a girlfriend is is\nlike has nothing to do with like my\nphysical attractiveness or my ethnicity\nand as everything to do with like what\nmy thoughts are and how I carry myself\nbecause my I carry myself relates to my\nthoughts and you guys like get what I\nwas saying when like like Hayden looked\nless pathetic right you guys with me\nanyway does that answer your question\nMoses or other dude yeah do you have\nfollow-ups I think so not really that's\na pretty good answer all right man we\nshould all go to summer camp and to cure\nour insulin yeah so it's I know you just\nabout that but I do think it's\nworthwhile to like engage in activities\nwhere you're not looking for a date\nright like that's people people say that\nbut like it's fun I mean as funny as\nthat is yeah like you should go out you\nshould just do stuff for the sake of\ndoing stuff and be yourself and then oh\nyeah you know don't have your head up\nyour ass\nand then you will be surprised right\nyeah anyway like not not healthy I'm so\nI can have some babies good yeah did the\nretreat last year\nlet's do summer camp let's do it oh yeah\nokay so thank you guys very much thanks\na lot\nMoses I thank you all right folks so we\nare gonna wrap up for today thank you\nguys very much for coming thank you guys\nvery much for your donations\nsubscriptions all that kind of stuff you\nknow we're here to help people\nunderstand themselves and we're not\ngonna judge right so hopefully I wasn't\njudgmental but I think that you know if\nyou're an in cell this is the other\nthing so by the way what's up with like\nall the softball in sauce maybe this is\nthe second guy who's like I'm sort of an\nin cell and then he says like he uses\nthe c-word and then he drops misogyny\nbut like if he stops using the c-word\nlike he doesn't really seem like a\nmisogynist like what what's up with that\nlike do we just is it because we're such\na wholesome stream that we can't attract\nthe right kind of you know breathing\nfire sort of insel like if we get like a\nlike maybe what we need instead of an in\ncell is a red pillar right can we get\ncan we get some real just toxic\nmasculine you know just the yes so what\nis a black pillar I don't even know\nanyway"
