    "transcript": "so I think karma can be really useful\nbecause it helps us understand like how\nthe world works basically so it is my\nbelief that if you want to be better at\nlife you should understand how life\nworks that competence and ease it\nactivities comes through understanding\nof those activities so if I understand\nlike you know how to control a character\nin world of warcraft like if I use Waze\nthan a mouse and I understand what the\nwk ducky does and what the a key does\nand what the S key does and what the D\nkey does that my success in a particular\ngame will be improved right sort of a\nno-brainer and so the question is is\nthat true of other things like is that\ntrue of life like if you understand how\npsychology works if you understand how\nyou know habit works\nif you understand how biology works do\nyou get better at the game of life like\nif you understand the nature of\nprocrastination and where\nprocrastination comes from will you do\nbetter and I think the answer is yes and\nso karma is one of the biggest things\nlike you know we can talk about habit\nand psychology and procrastination but\nthose are all like one slice of what\nlife offers right so like this is gonna\nbe psychology and neuroscience and\nthings like that but life has like other\nbig chunks right so we can like do this\nand I think that God MA is over here and\nI think it's actually helps you\nunderstand even more than the psychology\nand neurology and stuff like that\nbecause this kind of explains why things\nhappen and if we understand like why\nthings happen it becomes way easier to\nunderstand life so we're gonna start\nthis in kind of a weird huh what's the\nother half that's where you guys to\nfigure out so we're gonna start by sort\nof let's start here okay so let's say\nthat here's human knowledge and I want\nyou guys to just think about this for a\nsecond okay so like\nlet's say 5,000 years ago humans\nunderstood this much and then we had\nthis so let's say like this is a cloud\nwith a thunderbolt right and then we\nalso had like biology or let's say it's\nnot called biology let's call it illness\nokay so like there were some phenomenon\nand human beings like understood this so\nthis is ours and when they looked at\nlike whether they said like oh that's\nnot us\nlike we don't understand how that works\nthat doesn't have principles to it this\nis a guy named Zeus so Zeus controls\nthis and there's no reason if Zeus is\npissed off there's thunder and lightning\nand if Zeus is happy there's no thunder\nand lightning and like we're not really\nsure how that works but like it's under\nZeus is control and then similarly like\nillness is like not something to be\nunderstood it's like the gods or other\nforces that we can't control like muses\nor randomness or entropy or or chaos\ntheory or whatever like this is not\nsomething that fundamentally can be\nunderstood so it's a question mark and\nover time what's happened as science has\ngrown is we're like okay so let's do\nthis like so humans have sort of covered\nthis right we've moved the bar this way\nand now we're here and we're like oh\nthunder or lightning or not actually\nthere's like no God who controls it it's\nlike physical phenomenon that have\nforces that we can understand and then\nover time we also move over here and\nthen and then we have so now humans\ncontrol this stuff right we like we get\nthis but over here are places like why\nor things like was I born to my parents\nwhat are some other things why am i lazy\nwhen others are not and we look at these\nthings and we say these are questions\nthat cannot be scientifically answered\nright there's no like science so like\nover here is the question works so we\nsay that oh this is like it's random\nright so like a person whose religious\nwill say this is the province of God and\nGod works in mysterious ways and the\nsecularists or the atheists will say\nthere's like there's no order to the\nuniverse that can be determined things\nare just random but do you guys see how\nlike whether we attribute it to\nrandomness or god it's the same thing\nthere's no way for humans to understand\nso now my first question to you is are\nparts of the universe ordered and other\nparts chaos right if we think about the\nsystem of science the science say yeah\nlike this part of the universe has order\nso like physics has ordered but biology\ndoes not and like this part of the\nuniverse has order but this part of the\nuniverse is chaotic because if if we if\nwe kind of think about it\nlike essentially what's happened is the\nchunks of universe that have become\nordered have grown over time as\nunderstanding of science grows we've\ngone from disorder to order right if we\nlook at this spectrum this spectrum over\nhere is like growing order over time\nthis is order over time right so like\ndoes it make it so it I mean I'll share\nwith you one conclusion so like some\ntime ago I was very confused by like I\nthought it was strange that there's like\nsort of this arbitrary place that we\ndecide we we look at this thing and we\nsay oh yeah like everything on the\nothers\nas chaos but this is order right so it's\nkind of weird like that just doesn't\nmake sense to me\nand so if we think about it you know so\nit's my belief that things like it\ndoesn't make sense to me that the\nuniverse has an arbitrary point at which\ndisorder starts like that just doesn't\nmake sense and generally speaking if you\nlook at it scientifically any place that\nhas been disordered that human beings\nhave looked into over time they start to\ndo deduce order and like Zeus is a great\nexample of that right like they looked\nat thunder lightning and they were like\noh that's just there's no way to\nunderstand that it's the whim of the\ngods and then some guy was like I don't\naccept that let me look into it and then\nthere were all kinds of other forces\nthat we attribute and this is why sort\nof like you know the domain of God is\nkind of shrinking over time\nso now we get to if there is\nfundamentally order in the universe and\nyou guys are allowed to disagree with\nthat right that's like I'm not a\nphilosopher or anything and so maybe I'm\nwrong about that but generally speaking\nI think that we can have we have good\nevidence that human beings over time\nhave like made ground and expanding into\norder or into disorder we've been like\ncolonizing disorder with order and I\nthink there's good scientific evidence\nbehind that so now you know it starts\nwith the hard sciences but like we're\neven starting to deduce order out of\nthings that are unscientific so like\neconomics or sociology or disciplines\nwhere there isn't like a clear science\nor I mean there is but but it's kind of\nlike it's like a like it's not easily\nobservable and testable but we can still\nfind order principles within its\nfunction right so these are the\nquote-unquote soft sciences psychology\nis another good example like we can't\nyou know do an x-ray or MRI of someone's\nbrain and know what they're thinking but\nthere's still ordered principles that\npsychology adheres to so now we get to\nKarma so what is garma okay\nkarma is nothing more than the principle\nof cause and effect so some people say\nthat what goes around comes around but\nthat's incorrect actually garma is not\nwhat goes around comes around it's that\nevery action has an equal and opposite\nreaction it's Newton's second law all\nreally car by is is Newton's second law\nit's just applied on a scale or a third\nlaw is it third Locke they're like okay\nthanks for correcting me guys\nme llamo dr. K I mean sorry mae amo\nespanol oh [ __ ] I was gonna write ii\nagain\nokay so Newton's third law every action\nhas an equal and opposite reaction right\nso so the interesting thing is that like\nNewton said that this applies to physics\nbut gaddama says that this is a general\nprinciple that applies to all things and\nthat like it's not just physical objects\nthat are subject to this karma priests\nlike sort of says that if you have if\nactions have results then all actions\nhave results are all forces have\nconsequences and there's no way to\nescape these and so what like so physics\nyou know this this is physics and then\nlike we can sort of see that actions\nhave results in terms of chemistry and\nthen like biochemistry right so if I\nlike mix like an alkane with like an\nacid something is gonna happen I don't\nremember right so and and then we end up\nwith biology and then we end up with\npsychology and then we end up with\nbehavioral economics\nand then we end up with advertising so\nas we can see like these are sort of the\nhard sciences right and then this is\nwhere we get into the soft sciences but\neven in advertising we know that if we\nelicit a particular kind of cause like\nif we place a particular object\nsomewhere on a shelf it is likely to\naffect whether someone is willing to buy\nit or not\nprobabilistically so this there's\nthere's cause and effect here there's\ncause and effect here and then there's\ncause and effect\ngarma so then we get to the areas where\nscience says oh this is random so like\nyou know why were you born a certain way\nso in my opinion the biggest revolution\nin karmic understanding so this is where\npeople like get hung up on karma okay so\npeople say that so this is fine we call\nthis science but stuff like this is BS\nin is God in his religious and is\nunscientific and so karma says things\nlike the what what is happening to you\nin this life to a certain amount or\nmaybe all amounts but at least there's\nat least 1% chance let's start here so\nlike people say like all of these things\nare observable within this life but\nthere's no connection between things\nbefore this life in this life this is\nwhat science generally believes right\nthat like fine you have a particular\npsychology and that determines your\nactor advertising behavior but all of\nthat stuff is ensconced within this\nparticular life and then as soon as we\nstart doing things before this\nparticular life we start to get into\nlike hoity-toity stuff and like\nreligious stuff and chakras and crystal\nhealing and God and all that kind of\nauditory things so we don't accept that\nand Along Came genetics\nso I think the biggest contribution from\nmodern science to support the theory of\nkarma is genetics and that may sound\nlike absolutely bizarre but I want you\nguys to think about this for a second a\nhundred and fifty years ago I want you\nto go back in time a hundred fifty years\nand pretend that you had the same\nskeptical like atheistic views that you\nhave now like that that doesn't depend\non a particular body of knowledge right\nit's like it's a view and pretend that I\ncame to you 150 years ago and I said\nwhat you are in this life is actually\ndetermined by your parents it's\ndetermined by something that has nothing\nto do with what your choices are in this\nlife that there is actually an order in\na predictive capability to understanding\nhow you turned out to be this way I can\npredict your hair color is not\ndetermined by anything in this life and\nfurthermore is not random but there is\nactually a system of science that begins\nprior to where you when you are even\nborn that is going to make a predictive\ncapacity and shape your life today and\npeople would have been like that's\ninsane\nlike there is no scientific link between\nanything that happens before and today\nand then along comes genetics and\ngenetics is like actually what you are\nin this life is heavily determined by\nthings be up before this life that are\ncompletely out of your a quote-unquote\ncontrol we'll get to that in a second so\nthis actually is is really fascinating\nbecause genetics actually in my opinion\nis one of the strongest supporters to\nthe theory of karma because generally\nspeaking when people sort of talk about\nGod Amaya and how it's unscientific they\ndraw they draw like a very important\nline between things in this life and\nthings before this life\nright so the theory of karma like if you\ntalk to Hindus and Buddhists they'll say\nthat things in this life are determined\nby things before this life so this is\nlike they're saying okay this actually\nleads to us and the first scientific\nevidence that we have of this is\ngenetics and just think about that for a\nsecond so this opens up a whole world of\npossibility because if we have at least\none piece of scientific evidence that\nsupports that you can bridge this gap\nthen like what does that say because\nthen suddenly like this barrier becomes\nartificial right this barrier is no\nlonger here and so what other kinds of\ninfluences from this life are we opening\nourselves up to and this is basically\nwhat karma says all karma says and it's\nnot really that complicated is that all\ncauses have effects and all effects have\ncauses that's really it it just says\nthat if you look at anything there is\nthere is a reason why this happened and\nnot like a cosmic moral reason just a\nphysical reason if I throw a pen up in\nthe air the pen is gonna come down and\nso the problem that people have with\ngovernment this is why karma is\ndifficult to understand is because our\nknowledge of this life is restricted to\nthis life okay so I want you guys to\nimagine something so imagine that\nthere's a fence and there's a ball\nthere's one person on the side on this\nside of the fence and there's a ball\nthat comes down and like lands over here\neven though we can directly observe so\neven though this is the only thing that\nwe can directly observe we can still\nextrapolate where this ball came from\nbased on this and this is what karma\ndoes when people talk about like\nreincarnation and crap like that what\nthey're doing is they're saying even\nthough we can have only observe like\nhalf of this interaction we can still\nextrapolate like where things come from\nand\nanyway I don't I think that's just kind\nof like I don't have a particular I\nthink that's worthy of further\ndiscussion but we don't really need to\nget into it I'm just sort of\nhighlighting what theory of got about\npresupposes and so I think a good way to\nthink about this if you guys want to\nunderstand karma is imagine that you\nhave amnesia amnesia every time you\nsleep right so if like if you have\namnesia every time you sleep whenever\nyou wake up you only see the effects of\nyour actions in the past even though you\nhave no direct knowledge of them so if\nyou wake up in the morning and you see\nlike a dirty a sink full of dirty dishes\nand you're like oh like that's\ncompletely random like oh I just you\nknow unlucky me but no it's not unlucky\nyou it's because you didn't do the\ndishes yesterday so I think if you want\nto understand this whole business about\nlike prior lives and reincarnation and\ncrap like that like from an intellectual\nor philosophical way you all you need to\ndo is the thought experiment is did I\nsay dirty dick all you have to do is is\nkind of do this thought experiment where\nyou have amnesia every time you go to\nsleep and like that's what people sort\nof describe is like karma and and kind\nof past lives and stuff like that so\nwhat does this mean I mean I think all\nthis stuff is kind of interesting but\nthe question is like what does this mean\nfor us okay so so how does karma affect\nour lives now like what can we you how\ncan we use this information the first is\nthat karma is a system of cultivation\nnot creation\n[Music]\nand so when you guys I want you guys to\nthink about it this way you want to\nchange your life right you can't change\nyour life all you can do is so cut them\nup so what I mean by that is like if I\nask sometimes I'll ask people like how\ndo you grow a plant and they'll say like\nyou plant it and then you water it and\nthen you give it sunlight and then the\nquestion is if you plant something like\nlet's say I put a seed down here and\nthis is dirt and then I add water right\nand then I add sunlight does the plant\ngrow do we get a chute right does that\nhappen or does it not happen and the\nanswer is we don't really know yes\ndepends hopefully sometimes not always\nright so let's just think about that for\na second so when you guys live your life\nand you commit to an action in your mind\nwhat do you think is gonna happen\nbecause people say like so now let's\nlike think think about this for a second\nso I made a mistake like I didn't do\nwell on this test and like the idea is\nthat you have a sense that you control\nwhat happens when you do something right\nyou have this idea like this is why you\nblame yourself because like if it's if I\ndidn't study enough then it's my fault\nthat I did bad on the test that the\naction has a certain coral-like\nleads not even correlation to a result\nwhat what gaddama says is that you can\ndo all of the right things right like\nyou can you can provide sunlight and\nwater and fertilizer and that the plant\nmay not grow and why is this it's\nbecause there are other forces which are\nyour prior Karma's which despite doing\nall of the right things can actually\ncause an action to not happen and what\nthis means is like it's not actually in\na sense that's sort of not your fault\nbecause you know\nI'm jumping around too much let me see\nif I can explain this a little bit\nbetter so this is what I see a lot of\npeople have problems with is that they\nblame themselves for not getting a\nparticular result right so like if you\nare a college dropout or a NEET you like\njudge yourself and you're like I'm a\npiece of [ __ ] because I didn't graduate\nfrom college and I'm not like this and\nI'm not like this and if you think about\nthat that blame it only works like you\ncan only blame yourself if you're\nresponsible like if you're not\nresponsible like if you don't control\nthis and this isn't true then you can't\ncompletely you can't blame yourself for\nthis\nthis blame comes from a presupposition\nthat you control the result if you don't\ncontrol the result then you can't be to\nblame right it's kind of like saying you\nknow I showed up at the rental car place\nand I made a reservation and I have a\nconfirmation number but there was a\nglitch in their system and their\ncomputer systems are down so is that\nyour fault\nlike no obviously not so the more that\nyou believe that you control this part\nor actually that's not right I wish I\ncould undo oh crap okay they're\nbeautiful the more that you believe you\ncontrol this part the more likely you\nare to blame yourself because if you\ndon't control this then there's no like\nit doesn't make any sense to blame and\nif we think about what holds you back\nwhen we were talking about like\navoidance procrastination and things\nlike that your self blame holds you back\nright like that's true like you holding\nyourself back because like oh I'm such a\n[ __ ] this this and this you can't\nforgive yourself you can't let go you\ncan't like cut yourself a break for\nbeing the person that you are and\nscrewing things up so the question is is\nthere some way to make it easier to\nforgive yourself and the answer is yes\nif you look at karma and what karma says\nis that this actually is not yours to\ncontrol like this is crazy man all you\ncontrol is this you can water a plant\nyou can give it sunlight and you can\ngive it fertilizer but that does not\nequal growth this is what you guys\nreally have to understand and now I want\nyou guys to think about this like what\ndoes this do for your life if you start\nto think about yourself in this way\nit's not even don't just don't be\nemotionally invested in the outcome\nunderstand that like you are only\ncapable of exerting a certain amount of\ncontrol right and this is the other\nthing that I want you guys to understand\neven when you feel like you don't do\nyour best you are doing your best right\nthis is the other really really crazy\nthing about karma is that like karma\nsays that you know you so let's say you\nblame yourself for like skipping a test\nbecause you were afraid you were gonna\nfail and then you use hold yourself\nresponsible for that but what you guys\naren't acknowledging is that that person\nskips tests due to anxiety of failure\nright so like you have an option to move\nforward to take the test or skip it but\nthis person that you are this is the\nproblem with this way of thinking okay\nis you guys think that time starts here\nt0 is here right you guys think like oh\nI should have done that but what you\nguys need to understand is that this\nperson is the result of past Karma's so\ntime doesn't actually start here your\ncapability to man up and take that test\nor woman up and take that test is not\nactually like it's not like you have a\nlike you don't have like absolute\ncontrol in that moment you are sort of a\nproduct of your prior circumstances and\nif your prior circumstances have not\nbeen good like never went to class\n[Music]\ngot dumped by someone and mom and dad\ngot divorced okay so like if all the\n[ __ ] is going on like you can't really\nblame yourself for for like skipping a\ntest just think about that like it's not\nlike you you blame yourselves fully\nright so there's absolute judgment here\nyou're an absolute [ __ ] but that's\nactually not a fair way to look at\nyourself because there's all kinds of\ncrap that got injected into you and and\nsome of this stuff is even things like\nneglectful parents or genetics or even\nthat you were not given certain\nadvantages in life so I was given a\nbunch of advantages so my parents for\nexample like financially supported me\nwhen I was like 24 and in not making any\nmoney or anything like that and so when\npeople look at my success so if I'm if\nwe put success over here and we make\nthis person dr. K they say like Oh dr. K\nis so different he's so smart he's not\nlazy what they don't get is that I have\nthis right and what what you guys don't\nget is that like you know you guys maybe\nhad this or this or trauma in the past\nor anxiety so now the interesting thing\nis that like so what that means is that\nI don't in the same way that I don't\nblame myself for my failures I also\ndon't own my successes so I don't\nbelieve that I'm successful because I'm\nlike hardworking and I lifted myself up\nby my bootstraps you detach from all of\nit because if I free myself from my\nfailures I also free myself from my\nsuccesses when I look back on my on my\nlife and I recognize like oh I had a\nbunch of advantages like I was born\nIndian like that was a huge advantage\nwhy was it a huge advantage it's because\nthe body of knowledge that I chose to\nlearn from or that I was exposed\nI had like a racial advantage like I had\na race bonus to learn yoga because I\ngrew up understanding words that were\nspoken in my household that when I when\nI let go to an ashram and they're like\nCaucasian people there I realized like I\njust have an advantage over them because\nsome of these concepts are baked into\nthe language that was spoken in my house\ndoesn't mean I'm smarter it just means\nthat like they're trying to understand\nsome concepts that like I grew up with\nlike they're learning yoga for the first\ntime at the age of 21 and when I went to\nSunday school at the age of 8 like\npeople taught me yoga it's absolutely\nlike a race bonus and so if I have a\nrace bonus that other people don't have\nlike how can i how can I say that I'm\nbetter in like oh like I'm so successful\nbecause like I'm so much better than you\nlike you guys suck and I'm amazing\nbecause like I'm so smart no it's dumb\nit's a race bone it's like I didn't do\nanything to deserve that and so it\nchanges if if you don't deserve your\nsuccesses then you also don't deserve\nyour failures it's not really under your\ncontrol\nso yeah right so like just think about\nthat for a second this leads to all this\nstuff that we want like humility and\nconfidence and self forgiveness in\ncompassion and people like how do I do\nthat stuff I'm like oh you should learn\nhow to forgive yourself and they're like\nhow do I do that this is the way that\nyou do that you understand this so the\nnext thing is this also changes the way\nthat you act because here's the real\nscam okay is that according to karma you\nactually control all this [ __ ] this is a\nreally crazy thing okay and what I mean\nby that and but we're gonna focus on\nreally one part of it is this this is\nthe operative thing right so now what I\nwant you guys to do is recognize that\ngoing to class is not about getting a\ngrade going to class is about providing\na buff for future you it's not about\npassing the test\nit's not about graduating\nfrom college it's not about getting a\ngood job it's just about buffing future\nyou and this is what karma is karma is\ngiving yourself the opportunity to\ncultivate things for yourself you can\nplant a dozen seeds but you can't make\nthem grow so what you guys should focus\non is planting seeds but the problem is\nthat when you plant a seed and that's\nyour focus and it doesn't grow then how\nbummed out are you you're a little bit\nbummed out but if you plant a seed and\nthen you try to like really really make\nit grow you're like man I want that\nplant to grow I really want the plant to\ngrow I want to graduate I want to get a\ngood job I want to get a girlfriend I\nwant to move out a house I won't do this\nI don't do that I want this seven but\nthat's HAP na na ma you're not focused\non the sea you're focused on the fruit\nright you're focused on the end game and\nthen what happens is if things don't go\nyour way then you get disappointed and\nthe disappointment keeps you from acting\nand so instead what I want you guys to\nfocus on is like the action focus on\ngoing to class and change your view from\nI want to graduate to I want to set\nmyself up to graduate it's it's a tiny\nlittle shift but it's revolutionary like\nevery day when you guys come to this\nwebinar and you do 10 or 15 minutes of\nyoga that's a positive that's a positive\nbuff right these are the positive ones\nyoga so I don't think you guys realize\nby coming here and doing yoga you're\nactually buffing future you and then\nlike things are gonna start to change in\nyour favor this is what I see time and\ntime and time again is that when people\nstart sowing positive karma they don't\nreally know what the result is gonna be\nlike there's no clear way when yoga's\nover here every day what does that lead\nto\njob girlfriend-boyfriend\ndoes that lead to that no not not not at\nall like it's like how does yoga lead to\nany of that but Yoga is one of these\ninfluences it's one of the influences\nthat you don't see and that what I've\nnoticed time and time again and I've\ndone this work now with like literally\nhundreds of people is that when they\nstart doing yoga every day like [ __ ] in\ntheir life just starts to get better and\nthat cause and effect look so distant\nthat it's hard to like really see and so\nwhat I want you guys to do is like\ncultivate good things for yourself don't\ndo good things for yourself\ncultivate good things for yourself right\ncultivate a life for yourself or an\nattitude for yourself by like doing good\nthings that don't have a reason like\ndon't have a good reason behind them I\nknow it sounds completely crazy because\nright now you guys do things because of\nparticular reasons and if those reasons\ndon't pan out then you feel disappointed\nand stuck and you feel like it's useless\nto do stuff in that frame of mind leads\nto you feeling like doing stuff is\nuseless just think about that for a\nsecond\nif action does not lead to result it\ncreates a negative feedback loop for\naction right so this scenario results in\ninaction\nif action has no effect to result what\ndoes this lead to this actually leads to\naction\nbizarre [ __ ] crazy this is karma\nkarma is saying sow the seed sow the\nseed sow the seed we don't know if it's\ngonna grow we don't know if it's gonna\ngrow we don't know it's gonna grow this\nactually leads to action it's bizarre\nbecause then what happens is like this\nis what's crazy is the result starts to\ncome right at some point if you plant\nenough seeds stuff is gonna start to\ngrow like that's gonna happen you guys\nget that like if you go to the library\nand you study every day like at some\npoint you're gonna start passing tests\nbut the key thing is to not go to the\nlibrary to pass tests it's crazy if you\ntry to pass a test by going to library\nyou're not going to go good if you don't\nknow what to think then you're doing it\nright\nsee this is the problem is you guys get\nstuck in this negative feedback loop\nthis is the problem right here anyway\nokay so let's is to cheat code\nabsolutely that's what I'm telling you\nguys karma is like a cheat code because\nit gives you it's not a cheat code it's\na walkthrough right it doesn't allow you\nto break the rules in a new way it's\nlike you know finding like a fountain in\na game that makes you like invulnerable\nor buffs your stats it just makes the\ngame way easier to play okay so let's do\nQA\n[Music]\nall right so ah very good annex so anak\nsays this almost feels like I'm not\nresponsible for anything your act\nactually in a weird way you're\nabsolutely right\nso the problem is that we view\nresponsibility with the result when we\nthink about I'm not responsible for\nanything we lump these two together\nright so we think about like if we think\nabout someone who's responsible the way\nwe describe a responsible person is by\nresults we say they have a job they\nmoved out of the house they have a\nfamily they pay a mortgage they do this\nthey do that like they think about all\nthese kinds of things they think about\nresults but what you're actually\nresponsible for is your actions this is\nwhere responsibility lies is with\nactions not with the results and the\nmore you focus on being responsible for\nyour actions and letting go of your\nresults the better off you're gonna be\nyeah my question is if a person is in\nthe habit of blaming themselves for\nmisfortunes in life doesn't karma give\nthem the opportunity to blame their\ncircumstances and if blame is not\nhealthy then how do you dissolve the\nhabit of blaming and not become a doer\nokay great question so the first thing\nis that like so if you aren't\nresponsible for the result can't you're\nsaying if you're not responsible for the\nresult can't you become a Doomer because\neverything is sort of destined is that\nwhat you mean Oh kind of like for\nexample if I have a habit of blaming\nmyself like I was I if I'm like\neverything that's happened in my life is\nmy fault because I didn't do anything\nabout it up until this point then\ndoesn't understanding carmella doesn't\nthat make me able to blame that oh it\nwas all life's fault so therefore it's\nnot my fault\ntherefore it's fine if I don't do\nanything about it so yes and no so this\nis the thing to understand so like I\ndon't know if you're are you basically\nsaying that like you\nit's life's fault therefore it's destiny\nit's not me sort of yes okay so this is\nwhat you guys have to understand so like\nyou know this debate\nbetween freewill in destiny that exists\nin the in the West\ngarma fixes this beautifully so there's\nno debate in karma so what karma says is\nthat it is your choice whether you jump\noff a cliff but once you jump off a\ncliff you're destined to fall so karma\nis a tie between freewill and destiny\nand you're absolutely right that if you\nlook back on your life and you say\nthere's nothing else I could have done\nin a bizarre way you're right but that\ndoesn't mean that there's nothing you\ncan't do today in fact what you should\ndo is reframe that to recognize there's\nno you couldn't have done any better\nthan you did but today is a new day and\nyou can sow new karma so you don't\ncontrol anything that happened in the\npast but in the present moment your\nactions will influence the future I mean\nthat makes sense for me but from a point\nof view of somebody who I was before it\nseems like it's a hard concept to wrap\nmy mind around if I'm in the process of\nif I'm just blaming myself and then I\nget an out that I didn't blame\ncircumstance sure so your circumstances\nso let's think about it this way right\nthese are circumstances that are out of\nyour control so not my fault so be it\nI accept it you're correct not your\nfault the question is what is the next\narrow that you put forward because at\nthis point it starts to become your\nfault\nwhat do you think about that ice yeah\nthat yeah I see the distinction now I\nthink it's a it's like a fine line but\nlike the idea is that doing everything\nyou can do is doing something now\nabsolutely under right so even if we\naccept that the past is not your fault\nbecause you couldn't control those\ngarments the these garments over here\nwas like you jumping off of like various\ncliffs in past lives which you can't\ncontrol so if you want to let go of\nblaming yourself there so be it tell\nyourself it wasn't my fault there was\nnothing I could have done but today is a\nnew day and you can definitely so new\nseeds today so in a weird way I don't\nwant you to blame yourself\nlike if you're saying like how do I\ndon't i absolve myself with\nresponsibility go for it man unburden\nyourself of responsibility learn to\nforgive yourself for not achieving that\nwhich you wanted to achieve and wake up\ntoday and recognize that today is a new\nday and I can sow new seeds and have new\nresults yeah it's bizarre but you're\nabsolutely correct you just seem easier\nso see the the tricky think about what\nyou're saying is they say if this isn't\nmy fault then this isn't my fault this\nis the false correlation right here\nright this is where the nihilist or the\nperson who's like hedonistic or has no\nmeaning in life this is the correlation\nthat they make that the past and the\nfuture are tied together but they're not\ntoday is a different day in the actions\nthe Karma the seeds that you sow today\nlike it's like waking up one day and\nlooking out at your garden and saying I\nhave no fruit trees and it's like yeah\nman like you can't wait you can't blame\nyourself for not having fruit trees now\nbecause you didn't plant anything in the\npast but today you can plant and whether\nyou have fruit trees in your your yard a\nyear from now or not depends on whether\nyou plant today and you can even plant a\ndozen trees today and maybe none of them\nwill grow there's a chance that a year\nfrom now you'll still have no fruit\ntrees but when you fast forward to a\nyear from now and you look back on your\nlife and you're like okay there are no\nfruit trees but you\nknow what I actually planted 1212 seeds\nand I watered them every day and I gave\nhim sunlight and soil I did the best\nthat I could okay this is what I was\nsaying so when you look back at your\nlife a year let's let's say you fast\nforward a year from now and then you\nstill don't have any fruit trees in your\ngarden something magical is gonna happen\neven though you have no fruit trees in\nyour back garden you're gonna look back\non your life and you're gonna say you\nknow what [ __ ] it I did the best that I\ncould so I should rest easy and\nsometimes life just throws you a\ncurveball and you can't do it the\nquestion is did I do the best that I can\nand should I be able to sleep at night\nright this is a problem that physicians\nface when their patients die\nwhether you sleep at night as a\nphysician depends not on whether your\npatient died or not although sometimes\nit takes time to learn this isn't\nrecognizing I did the best that I could\nand sometimes bad [ __ ] happens and the\nproblem right now is that you guys have\nnot done the best that you could a year\nago you didn't do the best that you\ncould and that's what you blame yourself\nfor so it's not about being successful\nor not being successful it's about\nliving a life without regrets living a\nlife in a way that you free yourself\nfrom blame because you give it\neverything you've got I mean it feels\namazing to give it everything you got\nbecause a lot of times things work out\nand sometimes things don't work out and\nif you play a game and you play like\nlet's say I'm playing a game of dota or\nsomething or Lal or valor --nt right and\nif I like played the best that I\nabsolutely could and like I get crushed\nlike that's okay does that make sense\nyou doesn't make sense yeah\nyeah and if I if I think about what you\nknow if I could wish one thing for you\nguys it's not success what I think most\nof the people who watch the stream are\nlooking for is to wake up one day and\nsay I gave it my all that's what they\nwant they don't want success they want\nto wake up one day and be happy with the\nperson that they are and be happy with\nthe work that they put out into the\nworld they actually don't want a million\ndollars like that is not what's missing\nI have an analogy I just want to make\nsure I got this correct\nfor example dota analogy you can try to\npush the lane and kill creeps but you\ndon't guarantee weather\nget the power absolutely is it is that\nabsolutely right like so you don't\nrespond you don't determine when you're\npushing a tower you don't determine\nwhether they five-man rotate to defend\nit and gank you or whether no one shows\nup you just have to do the right thing\nyeah thank you okay next question\nhey doctor stay with them just get a\nmute stream hey man\nokay hey so um my questions or just they\nwould like to give you a quick\nbackground like I feel like I have a lot\nof grief related to those past Karma's\nsure because because I feel like I mean\nin essence I feel like I've lost five\nyears of my life like although although\nsomething good is like coming out of\nthose years where like in like you\nmentioned in a stream earlier I feel\nlike I'm not building building my\nfoundation on a house of cards it's like\na stronger foundation coming from it\ngood but I I guess my question is like\nhow is karma different from setting up\ngood habits like like yeah is there a\ndifference between the two\nlike just focusing on building good\nhabits that might set you up for success\nor like just a concept of karma like\nwhat's the difference between them there\nisn't right so like a good habit is the\nfruit of a karma so if I wake up and I\ndo yoga every day the action that I do\nis yoga on a daily basis or it's not\neven a daily basis all I can do is yoga\ntoday if I do yoga today and then when\ntalk tomorrow rolls around I can do yoga\nor not do yoga\nlike when does it become a habit like\nwhat does a habit how do I find a habit\nlike what is that show me a habit\nrhetorical so how do I know whether\nsomething is a habit I'm just using like\nthis habit bull F and I'm like it says\nit takes 66 days to build a habit I know\nbut I'm asking what is a habit like I\nfeel like for example I want to make\nyoga have it for me where it's like I do\nit every day I'm not asking you what you\nwant your habit to be I'm asking you\nwhat is a habit okay it's something I do\nevery day regardless of what it brings\nme okay so does that sound like Karma to\nyou okay so I mean maybe not that\neveryday concept like very good\nexcellent\nso this is the main thing that you need\nto understand a habit is not something\nyou can have going forward it's\nsomething that you look back on okay I'm\nnot sure it follow so like a guard my\nGarmin is about action in the present\nright and habit is is is like it's kind\nof I mean there are some things that are\nhabit but let me put it this way like\nyou said you notice that you you paused\nat the word every day it's something\nthat you do every day that you you know\nthat is relatively easy for you or\nwhatever but the king the key difference\nbetween habit and Karma is habit is like\nyou don't you can't have a habit going\nforward you can have a habit when you\nlook back so when you look back and you\ntake actions on a daily basis without\nthe exertion of willpower that is what\nwe call a habit it's an automatic\nbehavior oh yeah yeah right how's the\ndifference from karma it's different\nbecause karma is about the present and a\nhabit is about the past you can't have a\nhabit going forward because you have no\nidea what you're gonna do tomorrow it\nfeels like your Karma maybe covers your\nmindset as well whereas habit is like\njust the action so yeah well I think\nthat garma has a lot to do with mindset\nand so let me let me put it so your\nquestion was is habit different from\nKarma so I think some people got what I\nwas saying about a habit is in the past\nbut so I'll put it this way so if you so\nif you take the right actions on a daily\nbasis one of the fruits that garma can\nbear is something called a habit and a\nhabit is the capacity to engage in a\nbehavior with a relatively low\ninvestment of willpower or even like an\nautomaticity to it like a habit is like\nan automatic behavior right it becomes\neasy once it becomes a habit and I think\nhabits are built through karmic actions\nokay so Karan was like laying the seeds\nfor the habit to grow yes\nand then the habit is also up Gautama\nfor future you so this is what karma\nsays right is that there are causes and\neffects and effects or causes\nit's a loop it's not linear so if I\nthrow a ball up in the air and then the\nball lands on the ground the next time I\nwalk into the room the ball is gonna be\non the ground right and then then I can\npick the ball up so all things are tied\nlike causes lead to effects and in\neffects in turn or future causes does\nthat make sense or no um I'd like to be\nhonest I'm not getting it good no but I\nI might I might listen to this yeah let\nme let me explain it so it's let's let's\nspend time on this okay so let me think\nlet me show you something okay so let's\nsay that I study every day at the\nlibrary what's what's the result of\nstudying every day at the library I'm\nlike a good study habits so like if a\ntest comes you you don't have to like\ntake radical change - great therefore it\nyou're oh you already know good study\nhabit so let me ask you something so we\ncan sort of say that a good study habit\nis the result of the Karma of studying\nevery day right fair yeah okay so now my\nquestion to you and what's your name\nbuddy Simon Simon is that does a good\nstudy habit is that a cause for future\neffects or is that the end of the rope\nfor me personally that feels like a like\nsomething for future results absolutely\nright so then you you graduate from\ncollege let's say okay so now we can see\nthat the good study habit is both an\neffect and a cause do you see that yeah\nright so like what's the relationship\nbetween karma and habit a habit is just\none result that is also like a future\ncause but at the end of the day like so\nthis is this is exactly the point is\nthat if you think about\ncurrent you and what kind of action you\ntake if you've got two choices right to\ntake act in a good way or at that\ncurrent you is the result of prior\nKarma's and so like good study habits go\nhere let's say gaming goes here right\nbecause you stayed up too late and then\nlike let's say this is do you go to\nclass and then this is yes and this is\nno so do you see that like in this\nscenario your prior actions create the\nyou that exists now in shapes your\nlikelihood to take actions in the future\ndo you get that yeah yeah I know okay\nso like where do habits come in because\nhabits are created by prior Karma's does\nthat make sense like whether you go to\nthe library every day or not determines\nwhether you have good study habits yeah\nyeah like what path karma has an effect\non you or have this today absolutely so\nthen did you so what's your question or\nif I answered that like I got the sense\nthat your question is what's the\nrelationship between karma and study\nhabits and and this is sort of the\nanswer that I have for you is that karma\nshapes your study habits but then your\nstudy habits are in and of themselves a\nkarmic effect for future you so they're\nthey're intertwined absolutely oh okay\nyeah yeah again so that yeah so my\nhabits will become my Karma for my\nfuture self exactly okay and so the way\nthat I want you guys to live your life\nis to build Karma's for your future self\ndon't become a don't develop good study\nhabits so that you can graduate just set\nup like try to help out like if you ever\nplayed a game like you know wow where\nyou you create\nan alt and you send money from your like\nprior character to your like alt you\nknow what I'm talking about that yes\nsweetie\nI'm trying to teach people on the\ninternet about Karma\nI don't know why that's a good question\nit's okay she can say just almost done\nMeili okay hold on it's okay you can say\nokay so so I'm gonna give you guys one\nlast gaming analogy and then I gotta run\nokay so in World of Warcraft you can\nhave a high level character who makes\nmoney really really fast and then you\ncan create a new low level character and\nthen the money like the low level\ncharacter earns money in a far slower\nrate than the high level character and\nso what I want you guys to think about\nin karma is like when you have a high\nlevel character you can send stuff from\nyour high level character to your low\nlevel character and it really\naccelerates your growth and so what I\nwant you guys to understand about karma\nis like sowing good Karma's is like\nsending stuff to your future self so\nyou're like setting up your all for\nsuccess or failure or an ease of success\nor failure down the road you guys got it\nI don't know if that makes sense if you\ndon't play wow it can be hard to\nunderstand but ok good thanks for asking\nSimon I got a run guys but thanks thanks\nfor asking you a question man thank you\nthank you ok so\ncompound interest is absolutely right so\none person says compound interest so I\nwant you guys to understand this very\nclearly okay the difference between and\nI mean I say I keep on making\ncomparisons so maybe that's not good but\nthe difference between me and you is not\nthat I'm smarter the difference between\nme and you is compound interest right so\nlike I'm older than most of our audience\nnot all of our audience so the\ndifference is I started investing things\nat the age of 21 and I didn't even see a\nresult until like 2010 so I went to\nIndia at the age of 21 and it took nine\nyears for that to bear fruit 2010 is\nwhen I started medical school okay and\nthen that in turn has led to the bearing\nof all kinds of other fruit / hey and so\nso give yourselves time and don't worry\nabout moving out of the house and on\nother things like that just focus on\nbuilding that compound interest set your\nfuture you up for good things through\nkarma and if those things happen great\nif they don't happen don't worry about\nit just continue investing continue\nplanting seeds continue planting seeds\nhype and then eventually stuff will\nstart to grow okay so if you're thirty\nfine so be it I started med school at\nthe age of twenty seven or something\nit's okay it's not the end of the world\nalright let's go ahead and who do we\nwant to raid oh we want to raid you\nyou're okay it looks like we're raiding\nmy two-year-old"
