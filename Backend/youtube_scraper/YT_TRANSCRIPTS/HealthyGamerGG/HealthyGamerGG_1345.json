    "transcript": "let's get started okay so today is day 8\nand 10 today we are gonna talk about\nfear or not theories really models of\nmind so the goal of today is to talk a\nlittle bit about you can see that okay\nokay you know what are the different\nways that we can understand how our mind\nworks like what are the different models\nwe can use to understand the system of\nmind so we're gonna start with first by\ntalking about Western models of mind\n[Music]\nthen we're gonna talk about ethics\npsychology and then hopefully we'll do\nlike a little bit of kind of exercises\nto think through these things so let's\nstart with Western models okay Western\nmodels so the first thing is oh the\nthird thing is gonna be like practical\napplications okay\nso Western models the first thing is\nthat the Western model of the mind\nbasically has a couple of components so\nthe first kind of model that we can\nthink about is conscious subconscious\nor unconscious and some people will\nactually put the unconscious is separate\nfrom the subconscious they'll actually\nsay that this actually goes here I think\nit really doesn't matter so this sort of\nposits that you have I think the best\nway to understand this is you have\nthoughts and then you have the place\nthat thoughts come from okay\nand that's basically like the Western\nmodel of the mind right like so we say\nthat we have our unconscious mind or\nsubconscious mind which is where like\nparticular thoughts are just going to\ncome from and you know it's it's there's\nnot really a clear sense of how\nconscious mind and subconscious mind or\nunconscious mind interact you can't\nreally use conscious mind to control\nunconscious mind it's a little bit you\nknow it's sort of this general\nobservation that there's a part of the\nmind that is not active and then there's\na part of the mind that is active or\nnoticeable and that's kind of it\nthis stuff was sort of developed by\nWestern psychologists especially people\nlike Freud and Jung although it's very\npossible that earlier philosophers kind\nof you know notice this as well so let's\ntalk about sort of the central Freudian\nmodel before we get to the good stuff\nokay\nso Freud posited that our mind this was\nreally his biggest contribution kind of\nI mean one of the biggest contributions\nwas sort of the acknowledgment that we\nhave an unconscious mind before Freud\npeople didn't really think about the\nunconscious as a thing whereas now we\nall sort of accept it\nand that was largely Freud's\ncontribution so the other thing that\nFreud sort of talked about is that we\nhave something called the ED we have\nsomething called the ego and we\nessentially have something called the\nsuper-ego and the way that he defined\nthese is the it'd is our impulses\ninstincts\nso like these are the kinds of like if I\nsmell a a hamburger cooking I'm gonna\nwant to eat it I may have sexual\nimpulses which he was a big fan of\ntalking about they're just basically\ndifferent kinds of like impulses or\ndesires that we have or super-ego is our\nsense of morality or like sense of right\nand wrong\nso if I see like a hamburger being\ncooked but from a street vendor I'm just\nnot gonna pick it up and eat it I'm\ngonna sort of pay for it I'll you know\norder one etc so this is sort of the\npart of us that essentially controls\nrestrains our impulses so if we think\nabout it it's like pure impulsivity and\nthen control over here those are the it\nand the the super-ego and then in the\nmiddle is the ego which is sort of\nmediates the interactions of it and\nsuper-ego okay so the it is like in the\nmiddle so if I have an impulse to eat a\nhamburger but then there's a part of me\nthat says oh no you should pay for it\nthat the part that resolves that\nconflict or manages those two sides is\nthe ego and so for example if we look at\npeople who are self critical or self\njudgmental they're gonna have a lopsided\nthey're gonna have a super-ego that is\nvery strong and like stronger than let's\nsay the it'd or ego okay and then like\nanother person so sometimes when people\nare depressed they really beat up on\nthemselves right so beating up yourself\nis a strong super-ego\nso that's like a quick way to kind of\nunderstand it right so if we if I'm\nreally self-critical and notice that\nlike beating up yourself isn't\nnecessarily a bad thing I mean it is a\nbad thing because you're gonna feel bad\nbut beating up yourself can actually\nlead to like productivity and success\nlike academic success professional\nsuccess so sometimes some of these like\nbeating up yourself kind of\ncharacteristics can be correlated with\nlike positive things in the real world\nso that's an example of like a strong\nsuper-ego so if someone is kind of like\nanimalistic so if someone is kind of\nanimalistic and what I mean by that or\nmaybe animalistic isn't the right word\nhedonistic it's maybe a better word\nthat's kind of a situation where the\nit'd is way stronger than the super-ego\nor ego and then generally speaking what\nFreud posited or what people after Freud\nposited was that you know the stronger\nyour ego is the better off you're gonna\nbe\nso like ego strength is sort of the\nability to sit with this like sit with\nthese two different parts of yourself\nso hedonistic means pleasure-seeking I\ndon't know why I put quotes there right\nso like you don't really have you just\ndo what feels fun or what feels good\nlike you don't eat healthy you eat\nthings that taste good you don't want to\nwork you don't want to do other things\nlike you're you're basically controlled\nby your impulses okay so and then when\nwhen these things are well balanced when\nyou have a strong ego it sort of manages\nyour moralistic side from your you're\nlike impulsive side and then you're\nbasically kind of a balanced human being\nokay so that's one model so this is kind\nof the Western model so let's go to the\nVedic model okay\nso Vedic model of move this over a\nlittle bit there we go okay so the first\nthing that I want you guys to understand\nabout the Vedic model of mind and why\nthis is useful is that we have\nconflicting thoughts so this is why I\nlike this model of the mind so generally\nspeaking if I decide that I'm gonna do\nsomething there are other parts of my\nmind that tell me that I'm not gonna do\nthis thing like if I say I'm gonna wake\nup every day and I'm gonna do yoga\nthat's one part of your mind right so\nI'm gonna do yoga every day I'm gonna\nyoga great so that's the thought that\nyou have and there are all kinds of\nother things in your mind that crop up\nlike how about we watch twitch right and\nthere are all kinds of things like I'm\nnot flexible\nthere are all kinds of thoughts that\nkind of crop up so the question is like\nhow on earth does this work\nwhy do we have conflicting thoughts in\nour mind why doesn't our mind just make\na decision and do it right like this if\nyou stop and think about it we think\nabout the mind is one thing we think\nabout it is monolithic but if the mind\nis one thing like why on earth do we\nhave contradictory thoughts like what is\nup with that right it's not like we go\naround in life with like you know my\nleft hand is like hey I'm gonna drink my\nwater and then the right hand is like no\nwe're not gonna drink the water no what\nare you doing don't drink the water in\nmy left hand it's like no no I really\nwonder get my right is like no don't\ndrink the water right that's not how are\nthe rest of our body works it's not like\none eye is like I'm gonna look over here\nand then the other eye is gonna like I'm\ngonna look over there alright so if you\nhave a weakness in one eye muscle\nsometimes you can get you know\ncross-eyed but that's separate so this\nis normal okay that our mind has\nconflicting thoughts and so the question\nis like why does our mind have\nconflicting conflicting thoughts and the\nshort answer is that we have different\npieces of mind and the the four pieces\nthat I'm going to talk about are three\nfour or five pieces I'm going to talk\nabout the first is the munnis which is\nemotional mind\nthe second is a hum car which is ego or\nidentity and then the third is would be\nor intellect rationality the fourth part\nof mind is a some scar or undigested\nemotion or pattern also personality and\nthen the fourth is chittha or\nunconscious or really mind stuff you\ncan't I'll explain what these mean so\nwhat I want you guys to understand is\nthe reason we have conflicting thoughts\nin the mind and the reason we have a war\nin our mind is because we have different\nwe have thoughts that come from\ndifferent places so it's not like our\nmind is one thing it's like our mind is\nlike knights of the round table at\nCamelot and like different parts of the\nmind are gonna have different thoughts\nso let me give you guys an example okay\nso let's say that I want to apply for a\njob so my would be\nso my intellect let's use the scenario\nof job so my intellect is going to say\n[Music]\nwe need a job and then what happens is\nlike like when we like go to ask for an\napplication we feel anxiety right like\nif we go and do if we're not used to it\nthe thought of going in somewhere and\nasking for an application can lead to\nall kinds of anxiety and so what happens\nin our emotional mind we feel anxiety\nand then that anxiety gives us another\nthought\nI don't wanna okay actually that's not\nthat's not correct it's a different part\nof our mind tricky tricky tricky the\nthey they will think I'm stupid\nokay and then what happens is we have\nanother thought and this thought comes\nfrom our identity or ego so this thought\nsays getting a minimum-wage job is for\nlosers right so like this is how our\nmind actually functions even though you\nknow you need a job and getting a\nminimum-wage job isn't for losers\nyou have different parts of your mind\nthat like are conflicting and you can\nlike clearly see that the different\nthoughts are sourced from different\nparts of your mind\nright your emotions will lead to certain\nkinds of thoughts your identity or ego\nwill say like I'm smarter than this\nright and then you end up like confused\nbecause a week later you're sitting at\nhome and you're like I need a job and\nthen so you kind of think through this\nright and then like days go by and then\nyou end up back here\nwe still need a job and then the process\nrepeats itself and then like this leads\nto frustration and annoyance and and\nbeating yourself up because you're like\nwhy on earth like why does this happen\nto me I don't understand and then what\nhappens is you conclude right that like\nthis is the conclusion then you analyze\nyourself so then your intellect steps in\nand says like how on earth does this\nwork how does this work and then it\nconcludes I'm lazy right this what you\nguys can do it oh I'm lazy i\nprocrastinate\nso you guys come up with these umbrella\nterms which don't actually help you at\nall like so laziness is not an\nactionable term so this is what I don't\nlike about using words like laziness or\nastha nation or willpower\nI mean it starting to be their actual\nbut they're really not actionable like\nwhat's the cure for laziness being born\nnot lazy like how does that help us\nthere's no point in in conceiving of a\nsystem unless that system helps us to\nmove forward right it's like it's like\nsaying that weather is due to Zeus the\nThunder God like we can't make any\npredictions about that we can't rely it\non any on it in any way it's not like a\nuseful conception of the world\nirrespective of whether you know you\nbelieve in Zeus or not I'm saying that\nlike there are two ways that you can\napproach problems one is to diagnose or\ndefine them in a way that is like\nactionable in another way that is like\nin actionable furthermore this happens\nto be not true like calling yourself\nlazy isn't is in and of itself\nintellectually lazy it takes this\ncomplicated aspect of human behavior\nwhich is not simplistic and it reduces\nit down to one word and then so you're\nlike okay we're done so the real reason\nthis happens is can you guys see that\nlike so now we have our intellect okay\nwe have our ego and then we have our\nemotions and basically there's like a\npull between these and if our ego is\nstronger than our intellect or our\nemotions then we'll will behave a\ncertain way right if our emotions are\nstronger than our intellect our ego will\nbehave another way\nand if our intellect is stronger than\nour ego or emotions will behave a third\nway right so let's just think about this\nfor a second so let's say that you guys\nlet's say someone criticizes me okay so\nlet's say dr. K is an idiot\nwhat do you guys think is the first part\nof my mind that responds to that thought\nokay right so so in emotion most people\nare saying emotion or ego so like like\nwhat's the emotion that I'm gonna be\nfeeling\nokay hold on so defense is not an\nemotion okay so we're gonna say so you\nguys are saying emotion first okay so\nanger may be shame right and what is\ndefense what is the defense of thought\nokay or you can say ego first I'm not\nstupid\nyes he beautiful I'm not stupid\nalso you're stupid\nI'm not stupid you're stupid you're the\ndumb one I'm not the dumb one he's wrong\nme right so do you guys see how like so\nso even thoughts like how dare you do\nyou know who I am\ndo you know who I am do you know do you\nknow how dare you how dare you so these\nare all ego thoughts right so then what\nhappens is depending on on my mind and\nhow strong it is or weak it is the\nintellect comes in and so the intellect\nmay say hey man you're not perfect\nthese people are calling you an idiot\nmaybe it's because you're a boomer and\nyou don't know how to use technology\ntwitch hurr Durr okay it's like you know\nthese guys like you may be you know you\nmay have a certain amount of educational\nbackground but it's not like the people\non Twitter dumb right like the people on\nTwitter like let's be honest twitch it\nis pretty smart sometimes you say dumb\nthings right tech W POG Bey Hance right\nso it's like so so few areas like look\nat this like so now what happens is the\nquestion is like what part of my mind is\nstronger so even though you know my my\nego is gonna respond in a particular way\nlike it depends on the relative strength\nof my ego or intellect so you know I try\nto do something which some I mean I hope\nworks most of the time but maybe I don't\nknow right so even that that little\nthing that I did in my head was ego\nwarring with intellect and I'll explain\nthat in a second but generally speaking\nwhen someone calls me stupid\nmy first question is like why do you\nthink that it's not you're wrong because\nthey may be right like I could be dumb\nlike there's no way to know I mean maybe\nI am dumb right it's very possible\nso like help me understand like how do\nyou why do you think I'm dumb whereas if\nI let my in and that's actually my\nintellect controlling or I think it's\ncontrolling my response and I may see\nfeel some kind of emotion like I may\nfeel angry or ashamed and then like I\nkind of like notice that emotion I set\nit aside I'm like okay look we feel\nshame we feel attacked we feel like\nthese people don't like me and I want to\nbe liked and I want to be\nSoviet so I'm getting attacked let's try\nto figure out what's going on here and\nthen other times my ego is gonna like\nwin when it comes to my intellect I'm\njust gonna get incensed and angry and\nthings like that\nand I'm gonna say I'm not stupid you're\nstupid so do you guys see how like each\nof these things [ __ ] this guy oh no he\nfigured out I'm posture attack\nhandwriting fog run away stop streaming\nso all of these thoughts can come from\nemotions and like you guys can see that\nlike the the the nature of thoughts that\ncome from different parts of our mind\nare different and that's what leads to\nconflict and confusion and us not doing\nthe right thing okay so this is what I\nlove about this model of mind is once\nyou understand like which thoughts come\nfrom which places you can see why you're\nnot able to do stuff and what it comes\ndown to is what are the relative\nstrengths of your intellect ego and\nemotions so generally speaking you know\ngamers have an intellect that's level\nthree they have emotions that are level\nfive and they have ego that is level 82\nand so like the reason you guys are\nstuck is because there's like some parts\nof your mind that are just way stronger\nthan other parts of your mind and\nthey're beating crap out of you\nright it's like yeah I mean you guys\nunderstand levels I don't need to\nexplain it further so let's look at a\ncouple of other attributes okay so how\ndoes this help us so the first thing is\nwhat is the chain of events so generally\nspeaking our minds reaction so order of\noperations okay\norder\noperations so the first thing that tends\nto happen is an emotional response so\nmotion is super fast okay and if you\nthink about it like if I walk into a\nroom and then everyone turns on the\nlights and says surprised even before I\nconsciously process what is going on\nbefore I have an an analytical\nunderstanding of what happens in the\nroom like my emotions are like react so\nemotions are the fastest okay and then\nwhat happens is our ego so these act\nfirst now let's talk about ego for a\nsecond so then usually ego arises as a\nprotective mechanism so the ego is your\nmain tank that's the way I want you guys\nto think about it when your emotions\nwhen you're feeling hurt your ego or\neise's to protect you so when some girl\nlike let's say you ask out a girl this\nis an example that I use a lot and she\nsays no then you feel like shame you\nfeel fear that you're unlovable you feel\nlike all these things but they happen\nlike this and then your ego steps in\nright away to protect you from all those\nnegative feelings and you're like yeah\nit's her loss she's dumb like I can do\nso much better than her you know she's\ngonna end up alone like all of these\nthoughts like those are all egotistical\nthoughts right like that's clear I don't\nneed to explain that like oh yeah like\nshe missed out man boy did I dodged a\nbullet when really like that doesn't\nmake any sense oh she's not that\nattractive anyway like I'm not even that\ninto her which is like why'd you ask her\nout in the first place man like if\nyou're not that into her oh yeah I was\ndoing her a favor and then if you talked\nto people like you'll see that like as\nyou talk to them rationally like their\nego just keeps on spinning stuff out and\nthat's because their main tank is really\nstrong like you can try to attack it any\nway you want to their main tanks like\nlevel 82 and it's like hey man you got\nnothing on me like I can block whatever\nyou send my way right and and so like\nthe main tank kind of steps in and\nprotects you\nfrom negative emotion so it's really\ntrying to protect you it's trying to\nhelp you out like it's trying to help\nyou feel less hurt because if you don't\nthink those kinds of thoughts if you\ndon't think oh it's her loss\nthen whose loss is it it's my loss and\nthat's hard for people to accept and\nthen what happens is the intellect goes\nand then sorry the ego goes and it\nbullies the intellect so it goes over\nthe intellect and it's like hey buddy\nwe're hurting right now I need you to go\nback in time and do some really really\nselective analysis that shows us that\nproves my point to my emotions that we\nare awesome and so the intellect is like\nokay like I don't know if I want to do\nthat knee goes like no screw you like\nyour level three I'm level 82 like do\nsome [ __ ] selective reasoning for us\nand there are intellectus like oh yeah\nremember six years ago when that\nattractive popular girl actually had a\ncrush on us and we found out three years\nlater and we didn't really do anything\nabout it but she was into us because\nthat friend told us that she was kind of\ninto us and she kind of had a crush on\nus and she was super hot and she was\nsuper popular so yep it's that girl's\nloss that girl turned me down like cuz\nsix years ago this other girl like found\nme attractive so that's that's how it\nworks right\nlike the intellect gets bullied by the\nego and the egos like hey man do\nselective reasoning and and then the\nintellect is like okay and then the\nproblem is that the this person thinks\nthey're logical right so then then what\nhappens is selective reasoning because\nif you try to argue with them their\ntheir intellect presents evidence and if\nyou guys have ever tried to like you\nknow argue with someone and you've\npresented evidence you can understand\nespecially if they're like emotionally\nhurt in some way evidence is irrelevant\nand and so I'll give you guys kind of\nanother example of this so let's say\nthat you have a relationship where one\npartner is unfaithful and then like you\nknow that person feels like ashamed of\nbeing unfaithful but then their ego\nsteps in and they're like oh you know\nthey made me cheat like they weren't\nemotionally or physically available\nbecause they were working so hard and\nthey weren't\nand I have needs and then what happens\nas it goes to the intellect and it's\nlike hey like we feel bad about\nourselves can you come up with some kind\nof line of reasoning that can make us\nfeel better about ourselves and then\nyour intellect is like sure how about we\nsay that we have unmet needs because if\nwe have unmet needs needs then we can do\nwhatever we need to do to meet those\nneeds it's not morality or anything like\nthat we're gonna frame them as needs and\nif we frame them as needs like hunger\nand thirst like you can't really blame\nus for doing that and then we'll feel\nbetter about ourselves and so this is\nkind of the chain of events okay\npresuming that your intellect is weak is\nthis a one person asked a question about\nconfidence so confidence is opposite ego\nso if we have a spectrum egos over here\nconfidence is over here so I'm about to\nsay something and this could be ego this\ncould be confidence you guys let me know\nso I think that the way that I respond\nto people's criticism of me is because\nI'm confident in Who I am but if someone\ncalls me stupid my whole question is\ngonna be why because I don't you know I\ndon't need to feel smart to them I'm\npretty confident in Who I am and what\nI'm capable of so I'm like okay so like\ntell me how I'm wrong am i dumb sure\nlet's let's hear out how am i dumb in\nwhat way\nso that to me feels like a confident\nresponse but maybe that's my ego talking\ncuz now I'm saying I do this and like oh\nlike look at me like I'm so confident oh\nyeah look at how dr. K is confident look\nat it so dr. K is different right you\nguys have your ego that's Lovelady tube\nof my intellect to say 82 ah right that\nin and of itself is an egotistical\nstatement like this comparison that I'm\nmaking about myself is egotistical so\nmaybe in that situation actually like\nI'm doing the same thing I'm committing\nthe same problem it's just but no no but\nyou guys don't understand I have\nevidence that I'm less egotistical than\neverybody else I have evidence let me\ntell you about all the yoga that I did\nlet me tell you about all the meditation\nthat I did let me tell you about this\nlet me tell you about that let me tell\nyou why I am different\nyou guys see that that's an ego\nstatement right that's an ego statement\nso like so any statement that has to\nkind of do with with I could be an ego\nstatement or it could be like an actual\nintellectual assessment right so like\nyour intellect can without ego assess\nthat you're good at things are assess it\nthat you're bad at things the question\nis what is the relationship between\nintellect and ego it's for you guys to\ndecide whether my statement is\negotistical or confident like that's for\nyou to decide and that is my sense of\nthat's actually like that's a good D\nstatement so that's an intellectual\nstatement for me to say that you guys\nare the deciders of whether I'm\negotistical or confident in my mind is a\nstatement that comes from my intellect\nnot my ego because my ego says oh y'all\nare right I mean y'all are wrong and I'm\nright\nit's not for you to decide it's for me\nto decide and so in my mind if I'm\ntelling you guys y'all are the ones that\ndecide whether I'm smart or dumb or\nconfident or egotistical that's kind of\nlike the intellect because the intellect\nsort of says my intellect says you know\nyou're gonna be biased or I'm gonna be\nbiased my mind is gonna be biased so if\nI really want a fair shake of like what\nI'm capable of I should look to other\npeople because they're gonna be like\nmore objective than I am because I'm\ngonna experience all my own emotions so\nconfidence equals being humble basically\nyeah right so if you think about someone\nwho's confident they're not so what's\nthe difference new confidence in ego\nokay let's just talk about this for a\nsecond\nself-worth from within and then\nself-worth from without or actually\noutside\nright so when people have their sense of\nself depends on the praise or lack of\npraise they get from other people that's\nego and when your sense of self comes\nfrom within and it doesn't depend upon\nother people that's confidence so people\nwho are egotistical are gonna be like\nsensitive to the criticisms of others if\nyou call them dumb they're gonna respond\nin a particular way is like the\nconfident person is like okay you can\nthink I'm dumb like that's fine\nlet go I don't think go ahead and think\nthat that's fine okay so let's go back\nto this for a second so the order of\noperations so now the question is like\nhow do we move forward okay so actually\nthere are a couple of questions the\nfirst is so let's just go back here okay\nemotions ego and intellect okay so the\nfirst thing is like if you guys are\nhaving trouble with following your like\naccomplishing what you tell your mind to\ndo if you tell your mind to do something\nand it doesn't work like you're like oh\nwe need to get a job the first thing\nthat you need to do is recognize in your\nthoughts which thoughts are coming from\nwhat place okay so now we're gonna do a\ncouple of practical applications so if\nwe want to get a job or we want to stop\nplaying video games right like what what\nare the thoughts that we have like write\ndown the thoughts of conflict and then\ntry to figure out which one is coming\nfrom where and then you'll understand\nthat it's not like you're just dumb and\nparalyzed and lazy it's that there's\nactually like a war going on inside you\nand there are different parts of you\nthat are like fighting for different\nthings right it's kind of like an\nelection where each part of your mind\nhas a different number of votes based on\ntheir relative strength and then they\nkind of like all cast their vote and\nthen you decide on a particular behavior\nso this could be so look for thoughts of\nshame or anger\nwhatever and then also recognize that\nlike the last thing that you the thing\nthat you're gonna experience first in\nyour mind is actually gonna be the last\none in the chain so the last thing\nyou're gonna find or the first thing\nyou're gonna find is the selective\nreasoning which is actually like the\nlast thing in the consequence because\nthis chain happens super fast like less\nthan a second because the mind is pretty\namazing so if I ask a girl out and she\nsays no within five seconds or maybe one\nsecond I'm gonna be thinking oh it's her\nloss right it happened super fast so\nwhat you guys want to do is isolate the\ndifferent thoughts that are coming from\nemotions coming from ego and coming from\nintellect so let me give you guys a\ncouple of attributes of these okay so\nemotions I think you guys we've talked\nabout before we did a whole lecture on\nthat so I'd go back and watch that if\nyou guys want a go there are a couple of\nclues one is its comparative okay so\nthis is the biggest clue of an\negotistical thought and we have a\nchannel on our discord that's devoted to\na hum car or finding your ego so this is\na thought that compares you to someone\nelse or compares different things the\nego is fundamentally comparison\ncomparative the other thing is ego pumps\nyou up and puts other people down so if\nyou have a thought that is comparison or\nlifts like pumps you up or tries to\nknock other people down those are ego\nthoughts right so oh I could do better\nthan her that's a comparison that also\nlike puts you up and puts her down do\nyou guys see how like that thought I\ncould do better than her\nso the other thing is I don't know if\nyou guys are familiar with like the\npickup artist\nred pill kind of movement but in my\nexperience these people have very very\nstrong egos and they do a lot of very\nselective reasoning and they tend to not\nbe aware of their emotions because they\nmake a lot of comparisons right and I\ninvite you guys to like look for that\nyourself\nand so you'll kind of see that like they\nmake lots of comparisons they make they\nput other people down they put\nthemselves up so they have like very\nvery strong egos so then then what\nhappens is like you know you're gonna\nhave some amount of reasoning so like\nyou're gonna have some things that you\nuse as evidence or justification so look\nfor the thoughts that make you think\nyou're right right these are the\nthoughts that make you think you are\nright and that's gonna be the intellect\nand whether those thoughts are accurate\nor inaccurate are is based on their\nrelative strength to the ego so the last\nthing to understand about this is that\nlike so we have a basic problem with our\nintellect which is that human beings\nalways believe that they are correct and\nthey are logical right no human being\nwalks around and says I am wrong if you\ntalk to anyone about politics for\nexample everyone who believes something\nin politics logically believes that they\nare correct and that the other side is\nwrong it's not about right or wrong I\nmean it's about right or wrong it's not\nabout relative views like you know one\nof the biggest things that I remember\nwhen you know I was training and so I\ntrained it a very liberal institution\nand the the biggest thing that I\nremember in 2016 when Trump won the\nelection and in the US is that everyone\nwas surprised that people could\nquote-unquote be so stupid they were\nlike I don't understand how people can\nbe so stupid I don't understand how\npeople can be so stupid\nif you think about it that like everyone\nno one thinks they're stupid everyone\nthinks that are smart everyone thinks\nthey're logical so how do you know\nwhether your intellect is operating well\nor is like operating poorly how can you\ntell whether your intellect is flawed or\ncorrect because your intellect is always\ngonna tell you that you are correct\nright it's kind of like bizarre so so so\nthis person says liberals on ego trip\nlull w that in and of itself is also a\ncomparison what I'm saying is that\neveryone is on an ego trip everyone who\ntalks about politics usually believes\nthat they are factually correct\nand then the other side believes they're\nfactually correct right so this is\nexactly what I'm saying like even\ny'all's reactions are so rapid if you're\nmaking a comparison that like the same\nis true of conservatives right so when I\ntalk to trump supporters now and I ask\nthem how do you guys think the u.s. is\ndoing with the coronavirus they say\nwe're doing a great job and then I say\nokay then help me understand why you\nthink it is that the number of cases\nthat we how are we number one in the\nworld even coronavirus cases we had two\nmonths more to prepare than China like\nhow is that a great job and then they\nthey tell me all kinds of different\nstuff right so then their intellect does\nthese weird mental gymnastics and and\nthey say oh it's the NIH s fault it's\nlike how is it the NIH s fault but help\nme understand that they're like oh it's\nthe scientists fault that's like what do\nyou mean it's the scientists fault and\nthen I can keep on asking him questions\nand their mind is going to keep on\ncoming up with answers right so that's\nthat is they're just gonna keep on\ncoming up with answers I can ask a\nmillion questions that I want to and as\nI ask more questions and as they so\nlet's just think about this as I ask\nmore questions how do you think they\nfeel\nokay so as they as they get insecure so\nlet's run through this right this is fun\nso as they feel insecure what's gonna\nhappen how are they gonna respond to\nthat insecurity sure they feel insecure\nfrustrated irritated more ego exactly\nright\nand then what does their intellects\ngonna do as we level up the ego ego\nprotect their emotions\nshields up and then what happens defend\nthemselves counter right right and so\nthis is what happens if you engage in a\npolitical discussion with someone the\nmore right you are how convinced do they\nget when you're right absolutely they're\ntanking up right that the more correct\nyou are the more wrong they feel so this\nis the main thing you guys got to\nunderstand in politics the more wrong\nthey feel the more right they're gonna\nfeel and the less they're gonna listen\nand we kind of know this right like you\ncan observe this so like this model that\nYogi's came up with 5000 years ago in\nfive minutes explains political\ndiscussion done so now I'm gonna ask you\nguys a question\nif you want to if you want to convince\nsomeone politically what should you work\non how do you convince them okay\n[Music]\nwhere does it start\ndisarm their ego nope incorrect\nyou can't disarm the level 80 to tank\nfight them sure emotions absolutely\nright so like there's a really\nfascinating I remember seeing like a\nsmall docu-series about a black guy who\nlike convinced KKK members that they\nwere racist and like converted them from\nracism to being like less racist and he\ndidn't do it by attacking them right he\nlike went and he hung out with them and\nthen likely they hung out with him and\nthey started hanging out for a little\nwhile and then like the KKK folks were\nlike oh the students like actually a\npretty cool guy and so he just like\ntreated him like normal people and he\ndidn't attack him he didn't call him\ndumb and then over time yeah Darrell\nDavis so it's it's great like so that's\nhow you do it so this is the thing if\nyou want to convince someone you have to\ndisarm their emotions right you have to\nmake them feel comfortable and then like\nover time you can sort of bypass the ego\nand then like speak to their real\nintellect because here's the thing as\nlong as they're not attacked their level\n82 main tank is like is afk\nso he's like afk drinking at the bar and\nthen you can have a conversation between\nemotions and intellect and this is like\nwhat a lot of therapy is about it's\nabout sort of disarming emotions so that\npeople can you know focus on their\nintellect okay so yeah so that's the\ngoal like the goal is like as long as\nyou disarm their emotions and you treat\nthem with kindness then their main tank\nis gonna go afk and if their main tank\nis afk then you can have a discussion\nwith them so like when I'm talking to\npeople I mean I don't\nI tend not to talk to people about\npolitics but you know when I have\nsomeone whose views I disagree with I\ntend to start by like actually first of\nall starting with the idea that my views\ncould be wrong right like what makes my\nviews like why am i is a human being\nmore qualified to like know something\nthan someone else and and I had one of\nthese\nsince two days ago and it was it took a\nlot of self-control to not let my ego\nget in the way but it was like okay so\nlike maybe this person is right maybe\nprayer does stop the coronavirus you\nknow it's possible like we do know that\nthat you know mind has a positive effect\non the immune system that is we as we\ndecrease our stress there's a\npsychosomatic component and there are\nall kinds of reasons why like what\nthey're saying actually could have merit\nand I have to like really like work I\nhad to work at that a little bit right\nto kind of get there again and and so as\nlong as you do that by the end like the\nperson is asking me questions they're\nlike you know and then sometimes you you\nknow you toss out statistics and you\nquote things and things like that and\nthen you you know there's a part of you\nthat really wants to beat them into\nsubmission by quoting studies because\nthey can't do that and I can but we try\nto step away from that right"
