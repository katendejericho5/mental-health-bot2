    "transcript": "so there are some things that I think\nAndy about you that are somewhat\nrelatable to other people and some\nthings about you that I think are quite\nrare the first thing is that I do think\nyou have a sense of internal confidence\nthat doesn't necessarily come from\nsuccess because I don't think it's\nsuccess because a lot of people become\nsuccessful and then they need more and\nmore success and it's kind of like you\nknow no money is ever enough like you\nwant to be higher and higher on the\ntotem pole like the desire to be higher\non the totem pole never goes away so\neven if you move up on the totem pole\nyou want to be even higher and then you\nwant to be even higher and then you want\nto be even yeah it's like a beast that\nlike the more you feed it the more it\ngrows in the hungry or it gets and the\nmore you have to feed it like the\nhedonic treadmill I don't know what that\nis but certainly sounds like it it's\nlike the thirst for hedonism just like I\nneed more of yes making me happy so I'd\nsay that for example like ego is a good\nexample of the more that you feed ago\nthe bigger it grows and the more it\nneeds to sustain itself yeah so over\ntime ego can become like really\nnarcissism I think I think you are\neither lucky or should give yourself a\npat on the back and I think that comes\nfrom this sense of snapping out of\nautopilot into awareness so that so I\nthink you won't really are somewhat\ndifferent in that you have that capacity\nto recognize that you could be working\nat Popeye's for the rest of your life\nand kind of be happy with that yeah I\ndid I've had many minimum-wage jobs and\nwhen I look back at them I loved them\nall and all of them were cool and I feel\nlike character building and I think\npeople who get success in Hollywood way\nearly you see there's just like an\nonslaught of people that just turn to be\n[ __ ] up and yeah and it's like drugs\nand mentally [ __ ] like sure I mean\nI've worked with some people in\nHollywood and and so I I'm with you a\nhundred percent\nso I think that this is interesting\nbecause I don't think that that sort of\nhappened to you the real question so\nthat's one thing the second thing is you\nknow we could talk a little bit about\nlike motive\nand habit and behavior and what mutates\nbehavior that feels kind of dry to me I\ndon't think it's like really I mean we\ncan talk about it it's gonna be a little\nbit more lecturing or walking you to\nsomething yeah yeah the third thing\nthough I think comes back to this like\ncentral idea of why do you need to be in\nthese rooms with these people in the\nfirst place mm-hmm and what are the\nthings that keep you from so we could\nsay like why do you need to be in a room\nwith Netflix execs why do you need to\nput together a treatment because you're\nmaking a I think I'm understanding that\na little bit you're kind of making an\nargument that in order to creatively\nexpress yourself the way that you need\nto and I'm kind of trying to summarize\nhere you actually do need an\norganization or production value behind\nit that for some for something worse I\nthink right so I think also that's also\na crutch for people too is saying like\nyou need a production you need this I\ndon't I mean the thing that got me a TV\nshow was making homemade videos with a\nwebcam like 20 years ago if that doesn't\ngive me proof that I don't [ __ ] eat\nanybody\nand I don't know what does so I could\nstill make cool [ __ ] on my own but also\nI have a thirst to make something bigger\nwith the production and that's where I\nfeel like it's just like so so that's I\nthink the key thing there right so the\nquestion is what is that thirst\nso is it truly an artistic artistic\nthirst or is it an ego thirst and my\nsense is that it's more of an artistic\nthirst too than an ego thirst yeah I\nthink so so if that's the case then then\nyou do need to be in the room with those\npeople yeah I mean I mean not a hundred\npercent I mean I think like there are\nalso people on YouTube who create a\nbunch of stuff it gets big and then they\nbecome those people in the room for\nthemselves and they start hiring people\nand they have a production budget and\nthey climb that mountain\nand that's definitely a possibility too\nlike if I stop doing twitch which would\nbe big and I made videos every day I\ncould potentially get to that point\nwhere I can have a whole staff and hire\nwhole staff with the YouTube budget it\njust it's it's a crazy rare uphill\nbattle that I don't know when you say I\ndon't know what does that mean I mean\nlike for me to just stop doing twitch\nlike I attempted YouTube around the time\nwhen like vlogging was real big and like\nthe Logan Paul's and Jake Paul's and\njust very like pantry stuff was like\nreally big and my YouTube channel wasn't\npopping at all and then I kind of found\ntwitch and when the IRL section came out\nI started you know doing pretty decent\non Twitch so to kind of pull the plug on\ntwitch I'd have to i'd have to like I\nmight be totally getting to pulling the\nplug on twitch I'm saying like my alt my\nalternate my alternative to sitting in\nthe room with someone like Netflix would\nbe to pull the plug on twitch and to\ncreate this big youtube series that\ncould eventually fund me getting a staff\nand a production so let me let me take a\nstep back again I'm gonna give you a\ncouple of options okay okay one is that\nwe can talk a little bit about like\nmotivation and habit and how to sit your\nass in front of a piece of paper and\nwrite something we can dig into a little\nbit more about you know what it means to\ncreate something substantive and what\nthe recipe for that looks like but the\nreal question that I wondered I think\nthis could be tricky for you Andy is\nbecause you're so confident it's\npossible that you have some kind of\nnegative emotion that's really holding\nyou back and your confidence is there\nand so it makes it almost like\ncognitively dissonant for you to feel\nthat kind of fear you're having being at\nPopeye's but here's kind of the\na couple of notes and this is sort of\nlike a hypothesis that I'd love to put\nto you and and you kind of talk about\npotential you talk about kind of giving\nup twitch and and sort of gunning for\nthis YouTube thing you talk about these\nexecs where you're not able to motivate\nyourself and when I think about why\npeople can't motivate themselves a lot\nof it is because they intrinsically are\nconcern to really don't believe that\nthey're gonna be successful mm-hmm and\nand it's very very subtle because I\nthink you are confident but I wonder if\nI'm hearing some subtle undertone of\nlike your best days are behind you that\nyou're the highest you're ever gonna go\nwas that first thing that you did where\nyou made it big and you wound up on\nHollywood and everything after that is\nlike you're like you know a little bit\nof like had like and easie has been\nmm-hmm\ndo you feel that are you afraid of that\nI don't think so because I was about to\nmove to New York - really - really I\ndon't think there's like a lot of IRL\nstreamers in New York and I was like\njust about to be like all right well I\ncould just run it I could run the IROC\nand in New York so not that many people\nare doing it and then I acted in this\nindependent film that maybe nobody will\nsee but it was so rewarding and it felt\nso good and it it made me like man like\nit made me feel like man I need to do\nmore acting like what am i doing there's\nsomething so awesome and creative about\nit and the fact that it might not even\nsee the big screen like like yeah it\nwould be nice if that was seen in 2,000\nscreens but it was still just as\nrewarding just actually doing it so like\nI don't know I think like I don't I\ndon't think I really care okay you told\nme if you told me I could say like oh I\ncould snap my fingers and this is gonna\nbe in two hundred screen\nand be super successful yeah I'd be\nhappy about that but there's so much\ndisappointment in Hollywood I just\nexpect it and when something good\nhappens that's kind of like the icing on\nthe cake it's like cool that was really\nfun and awesome to do but also oh cool\nthe successful do hmm\nAndy are you unhappy I don't think so I\nreally don't think so I mean I think\neverybody goes through unhappiness like\nnobody's a hundred percent happy all the\ntime but I try to like kind of like do\nyou penalize myself do you even when I\nwake up do you should be different or do\nyou think your life should be different\nI think I think if I put in instead of\nlike over the last ten years put in\nmaybe 25% of the effort I could have I\nput in 50% my life probably would be\ndifferent and as much as like it sounds\nlike that's I resent myself for it and\nmaybe I do a little bit I mean that's\ntrue but do you care I only care a\nlittle bit and I don't want to get too\nweird on you but since the way I view\nthe universe and the way of you\nphilosophy how I feel like most\neverything means nothing like you know\nevery day you wake up you smile you feel\ngood that means something right but\nlong-term I value very little so like\nI'm kind of kind of indifferent I kind\nof think like man if I put a little more\neffort in like I would have been in a\ncooler doper position and I apologize\nbecause I'm interrupting you a fair\namount but if it gets annoying please\nlet me know I can do last okay I think\nat this point I'm getting a sense I\nthink you your head I mean this is\ndefinitely my fault so I asked you you\nknow is there something that you want to\nchange and you said yes but the more\nthat we talk about it I'm not really\ngetting the sense that anything in your\nlife needs to change well I disagree I\nam it because I wouldn't I wouldn't be\nthinking about it so much if I didn't\ncare at all right yeah but so then the\nquestion is how much do you care because\nif you care as you said just a little\nbit what I mean there are a lot of\nthings that I care about just a little\nbit but like why the [ __ ] even bother\nright like well maybe a little bit as an\nunderstatement because if I think about\nit a nice if I think about it enough and\nit's something that fuels my mind and\nI'm like I have these like especially\nlike late at night thoughts where I'm\nlike what the [ __ ] am i doing tomorrow\nI'm gonna wake up and stream a game it's\nso [ __ ] pointless for me I'm not good\nat games it's just killing time so I\njust went online and I bought some\nreally nice headphones and a microphone\nand I'm like [ __ ] this were quarantined\nI'll make a whole [ __ ] album while\nwe're here [ __ ] twitch for a minute you\nknow I mean like that I could come back\nin a week I could come back in two weeks\nlike you know I have this tug of war in\nmy mind where I'm just trying to pull\nmyself away from the stuff that's not\nsuper creative and I'm trying to pull\nmyself towards the creative side and\nthat struggle is something that I feel\non a regular basis you what keeps you\naway from the creative I think what\nkeeps me away from it is saying yeah\n[ __ ] it what is this like I don't know\nman maybe maybe it's like okay think\nabout this how would you how many\ncompany actually says how many people\nwe'll talk to you and pitch a really big\nidea to you and they're like so excited\nabout this idea they thought of and how\nmany people actually go ahead and do\nthose ideas being a doer and not a Sayer\nis the hardest thing in life sure and I\nthink that's I think that maybe be my\nstruggle and sometimes I say you know\nwhat I thought of this I'm not gonna be\none of those people who just says I'm\ngonna do something and I do it and\nsometimes I become a doer and I and and\nit pays off because it feels good but I\nneed to try to win that tug-of-war more\noften and be more of a doer and when I\nhave a thought of creating something\nawesome I need to like learn how to be\nstronger to win that tug-of-war with\nmyself I think okay so that I think I\ncan help you with and sorry for we're\nspending so long and kind of getting to\nthis point because no it's my fault for\nbeing confusing maybe no no yeah I think\nyou've died I think it's just it's it's\nit's complicated right because you're so\ncontent and yet we talk about things a\nlittle bit like you're like I'm a look I\nhave a little bit of regret but yeah I'm\ngetting the sense that that there's a\npart of me that some of your language\nmm-hmm\nmakes it sound like not a big deal like\nliterally you'll use phrases like it's a\nlittle bit and like I'd be fine if I was\nlike working at Popeye's for the rest of\nmy life I'd be fine if I had this and\nthose seem like genuine statements to me\nthey don't seem like they're they're\ndenial they don't seem to me like their\nego that sounds like you're genuinely\nthere and also I get the sense from you\nthat there is some work that is left\nundone and I think that there is\nactually a part of you that's a little\nbit desperate because I think until that\nwork is done until you actually create\nthat thing which is not the totem pole\nof success in Hollywood but the totem\npole of like your satisfaction with what\nyou have created and put out into the\nworld I agree with that except I think\nit will never be complete because\nthere are little bursts it's like a\nrollercoaster yeah so I I think I don't\nknow I don't I don't agree with that I\nthink it can be complete I think you can\nbe content and I think that on on your\ndeathbed yes death is imminent and\nlooming before you your that cookies\ngonna crumble one of two ways\nyeah but I I already feel like if I died\ntoday I've done so much and I've I feel\nlike I feel like I've I use this analogy\nalready but I feel like anything else is\nthe icing on the cake I went from being\na high school dropout to having my own\nshow to being in movies and coming and\ntouring the world with doing music like\nto me that feels pretty dope and if I\ndie I'm like cool so I got to see a lot\nof countries this is exactly what I'm\nnoticing right so like when I when I any\nside of the argument that I take you\ntake the opposite side so like if I say\nthat you you're you're a discontent\nyou say I am content and if I say you\nare content then you kind of say like\nmaybe it's a little bit more than a\nlittle well here's the thing I totally\nagreed with whatever you had to say\nabout getting to a place of being\ncontent but the only argument I have is\nit feels like a roller coaster right\nbecause like when I it's not like I\nhaven't done bigger stuff in the recent\nyears when I do like I did a cooking\nshow for advice right that was like cool\nand creative and it was my own idea and\nthat was like the top and then you go\ndown and then you plateau again and then\nyou feel that juice you need that you\nneed that hit again to do something else\nwhat does that hit is that is that an\ninternal desire to create or is it to\nhave something successful it's it's\ndefinitely to create but having it be\nsuccessful is nice but it's that\ninternal desire to create something\noriginal and put it out into the world\nokay and yeah if nobody sees it it might\nfeel a little bit like bad but you know\nso let's talk about that so oddly enough\nI think I think what I liked liked\ntalk to you about a spirituality okay\nany do you have a particular inclination\ntowards spirituality or religion I think\nreligion to me is like is just nothing\nto me it's like sure I just I look at it\nas like naive like my my favorite here\nI'll show you a little quote that I\nreally like that's a to don't know it's\nonly the madman is absolutely sure and\nit's kind of like the people in the\nworld that are the madmen that are the\ncrazy people where are the people who\nare absolutely sure of something and\nit's not just about anything like I'm\nabsolutely sure I love the color green\nit's more about bigger things like about\nreligion about the universe people that\nthink they have the thing figured when\nit's just such a gamble and it's such a\nmaybe those are the people that are a\nlittle bit cuckoo for cocoa puffs\nso my thing is pretty much this guy\nRobert Anton Wilson is pretty dope it's\nkind of like maybe two everything sure\nso I'd like to then maybe share with you\na hypothesis that I'd love to get your\nthoughts on and so let me first of all\nlet's see if I understand where you are\nand where you'd like to go so it sounds\nlike like I said at the beginning I\nthink you are generally content and\nconfident in your capabilities and that\nyou sometimes have creative impulses and\nthat you that those creative impulses\ncan be satisfying or unsatisfying and\nthat sometimes the the result of your\ncreation is successful or unsuccessful\nbut that that is an independent axis\nfrom satisfying or unsatisfying that in\nand of itself I think sets you in the 1%\nbecause very few people a lot of like\nthe people on Twitch for example I mean\nI'm not trying to speak down to them I'm\njust saying that we're taught by society\nthat row internal reward and success\nshould be aligned that internal\nrewarding and external success or like\none of the same right that's why this\nidea is garbage sure\nabsolutely and I think that's why people\nare suffering because society is garbage\nright yeah it's like the promise of a\nboomer generation that if you work hard\nand you go to school and you get a good\njob as an engineer and you buy a house\nand you you have two kids that you will\nbe happy in life right it's the kind of\nidea that internal success is a\nreflection of external success yeah\nbecause if you need validation from\npeople that are probably garbage people\nlike what the [ __ ] does that make you\nyou have to like learn to love yourself\nand if you think you're adult human and\nyou're cool to people then you should\nvalidate yourself if you know what I\nmean like why do I care what people I\ndon't trust think about me why do I care\nwhat people who are horrible to other\npeople think about me those people don't\nmatter they're there like in the [ __ ]\nsewers so for people who are curious\nthis is the difference between ego and\nconfidence right so the egotistical\nperson has a value that is determined by\nothers and the confident person has a\nvalue that is determined by yourself and\nI mean Andy is confident so that that\nstill remains you still have your\nproblem which is that when after a\ncertain amount of creative endeavor you\nwind up in kind of like this this trough\nwhere you notice it sounds like you have\nopportunities to create and maybe get\nthat production value behind you that\ngives you a substance to truly create\nwhat you want to when you're not able to\nmotivate yourself to be able to like\ncapitalize on that opportunity and make\na treatment for Netflix or whatever yeah\nand sometimes I think I like cook myself\nbecause of like logistics that I get\noverwhelmed with like I have a I didn't\nhave enough space to create stuff so I\ngot a loft downtown bigger space then I\ngot a green screen and like little\nlogistics of like this is not working or\nI don't know how to like properly do\nthis and then like I needed some help so\nI got TaskRabbit to fix this once I have\neverything aligned to where I could\ncreate something I feel like that's when\nI really go for it\nlike and I\nsee little successes here and there\nwhere I'm like alright well I want to\nmake a parody auto-tune song I can't get\nauto-tune working so then I just don't\nwork on it for a week and then I finally\nhave someone help me or like get\neverything tuned to where I could just\ngo and once I have everything ready to\ngo that's when I could start creating\nstuff and I feel like all right\nsometimes I have these little mental\nblocks where I feel like I know there's\nlike there's a hurdle in the way of me\ncreating something and that kind of gets\ndiscouraging and what's the hurdle the\nhurdle could be technical stuff\nit could be finding people to be in\ncertain like sketches it could be you\nknow okay\nmoney for production yeah I mean it\nsounds like you would do you do your\nbest to work and I mean now I see the\nvalue of production because it sounds\nlike the stuff that prevents you from\ncreating is the same stuff that prevents\nme from creating which yeah like I do my\nbest work when I don't have to worry\nabout configuring any of the platforms\nor this or that or you know arrange it\nlike I like to talk to people and you\ncreate stuff and if I have to manage\ngreen screens and cameras and\nmicrophones Twitch's seen what happens\nyeah like when if someone told me all\nright Andy you're gonna be working on\nthis show blah blah blah\nfor the next two months it's 14 hours a\nday you just got to show up I'm there\nevery day yeah so so I think let me come\nback to kind of what I I'm not honestly\nAndy I'm not sure how to help you\nbecause I think that I mean I do have\nsome idea so let me put forth a couple\nof things and then you let me know if\nthis kind of resonates with you or\ndoesn't resonate with you we can try to\ntalk further but I don't think that you\nhave some kind of psychological thing\nthat's holding you back\nbasically mm-hmm right so I've been\nsniffing around for something like that\na lot of times the people that it can\nhelp or people who have psychological\nblocks that get in the way of like them\ndoing things I doesn't sound like you\nreally do the only thing that that like\nI said and and it doesn't sound like\nthis is the issue is that you know I\nwonder if getting success when you did\nif that sort of created in that sense of\npotential creates for\nyou a fear that you're not going to live\nup to your potential and that fear\nprevents you from putting your best foot\nforward but that doesn't sound like it\nresonates with you right like you don't\nthink that that's really an issue fear I\nthink maybe partially fear of not living\nup to my potential definitely resonates\na little bit I feel like definitely isin\nAIT's a little bit yeah like like to the\nparty well I'm just saying like I don't\nwake up being like but it's there it's\njust not but it's it's there the time\nexactly it's very ok it's kind of like\nwhen I when I'm like I when I'm kind of\nlike men\nok yeah so do something good let me let\nme so let me talk okay so let me can I\ntalk for a little bit yeah sure ok so I\nwant people to kind of understand this\nthat generally speaking when we think\nabout barriers in life I think the\nbarriers start with the grossest and I\ndon't mean gross like disgusting I mean\ngross is the opposite of subtle and the\nbetter you get at things the more subtle\nyour barriers become so if we think\nabout you know someone like a biological\nbarrier is very gross in terms of it is\nvery tangible and noticeable so if I\nlike if I'm trying to get out of bed and\nI don't have legs that is very like a\nparent and that's maybe a better word\nfor gross is a parent that's in a parent\nproblem like if I'm trying to get out of\nbed and I lack legs that problem is very\napparent and has like a very apparent\nsort of solution right I need to get\nlegs or maybe I need a prosthetic or a\nwheelchair or something like I know a\nleg guy by the way from I got you know\nso so that's kind of problem number one\nis sort of like the biological or\nphysical then as we kind of go further\nlike as as you settle your like\nbiological needs or like physical\nproblems then we enter the realm of\npsychological problems so psychological\nproblems are like these pent up\noceans are like some scars or like\nlittle traumas or these emotional\nweights that sit on our mind and prevent\nus from moving forward and and as we\ntalk to you it sounds like that's there\nbut it's not that significant for most\nof the people that I talk to on stream\nthat's really where the money is some\npeople that I talk to on stream like the\npsychological stuff actually becomes\nsort of irrelevant because their\nphysical situation or their circumstance\nis so bad that like growing as a human\nbeing doesn't [ __ ] matter if you're\nyou know broke and and like don't have\nfood and have no place to live like you\nknow you it's kind of like Maslow's\nhierarchy of needs but you know\npsychology is ultimately less important\nthan like basic survival and biology and\nthen once you get the psychology soft\nsort of sort of taken care of and what I\nhear from you is that's definitely a\nthing a little bit then your your way\nforward is actually spirituality so I\nwant you to think about this for a\nsecond do you know anything about Buddha\nBuddha um not that much I mean I do a\nlittle light research sure do you know\nwhat what like what he was in life like\nwhat did the job was know what was his\njob so he was a prince so would the woke\nup one day and he was respected and he\nwas powerful and he was loved and he was\nwealthy and so he woke up one day sort\nof and he kind of in a similar situation\nto you it's not that he like lacked\nconfidence and he wasn't unhappy he had\ngood days and he had bad days he had\nstuff that pissed him off and he had\nstuff that that didn't piss him off well\nI had a show called the fat Prince so\nthat makes sense great and and so so\nwould\nwoke up one day and he's sort of like\nlike I want you to think about this if\nyou miss something in life you think\nthat that thing will make you happy\nright so you have some amount of success\nand I think this is the lesson that\nyou've learned that a lot of people\ndon't learn is that people who are\ntrying to make it think that making it\nis going to make them happy but what we\nhear from you is that sure making it is\nnice but what actually makes you happy\nis like doing the work itself in\ncreating\nsomething and even if no one sees the\nfilm like you're so actually kind of\nhappy and content with that with which\nthe guy who's trying to make it just\ndoesn't understand you can explain that\nto him and he's just not gonna get it\nhe's like dude that's crazy like I'm\nnever gonna be content until I make it\nyeah and then people sort of end up\nwhere you are and this is where would\nthat end up end it up which is that he\nhad made it right he was wealthy he was\npowerful he was respected he was loved\nhe walked down the street and people\nwould approach him and be like hey can\nyou take a look at my script I have this\ngreat idea for a sketch comedy thing and\nthat's what was in your son can you sign\nmy papyrus no sorry yeah exactly\ncan you sign my papyrus right can I can\nI can I can I have a dirt drawing of me\nand you can we get a dirt drawing selfie\ncan you tear my tits oh hey that's -\nyeah absolutely right and then I woke up\nand he was unsatisfied and then he's\nkind of screwed right because there's\nnothing to move towards like there's\nnothing there's no where to go from\nthere and so this is when he sort of\nrealized he's like oh I'm actually kind\nof [ __ ] because if I kind of have\neverything and everyone around me says\nthat like to be happy you have to have\nstuff and I have stuff then what do I do\nand so I think that's kind of where you\nare and so I think your way forward is\nthrough actually through spirituality\nand what I mean by that very and in your\ncase there's a particular flavor of\nspirituality and when I talk to you I'd\nlike to talk to you about for a few\nminutes as manifestation so in this\nworld we have intentions and we have\nenergy but oftentimes we're not able to\nmanifest right so like you want to write\nthis thing for Netflix but you lack the\nenergy to write this thing for Netflix\nand there are other times where you wake\nup and you want to do something but\nyou're not quite sure like what to do so\nyou have the energy and you kind of\nmentioned that you attempted to like get\non the YouTube bandwagon with like Paul\nLogan or Logan Paul earth and Joe\nRogan's or whoever whoever those be bit\nright so like you have the energy and\nyou tried to create something and it\nkind of fell flat and so the question is\nlike why do things fall flat when you do\nthem or why is it that\nwhen you want to do something cuz like\nwhen you want to do something it's not\ngonna fall flat like you have this\ncreative drive but you're not able to\ncapitalize it and other times you're\nable to capitalize on something but the\ncreative drive is not there so it falls\nflat does that make sense yeah that\nmakes less sense and so some people may\nthink oh like the YouTube thing didn't\nwork out because sometimes things don't\nwork out that is a stupid mentality to\nme I think as a scientist if something\ndoesn't work out you should be able to\ninvestigate why things didn't work out\nand the one thing that I would have\ncautioned you to accept is that\nsometimes things in Hollywood don't work\nout and disappointment is a part of the\nequation most times and I would\nencourage you to step away from that\nbecause it's not just that randomly\nthings become disappointed you didn't\njust randomly fail at YouTube like there\nis a reason why and and this is where\nyou're entitled to disagree with this\nand I think this kind of thinking\ndoesn't work for 99% of people but I\nwant you to start thinking about your\nsuccesses and failures as attributable\nto you and that you have a hand in that\nright like the product that you put out\non YouTube the kind of acting that you\ndo is in some degree like dependent on\nyou you have agency in that and you\ncan't control what execs think I'm not\ntalking about that I agree with you for\npretty much any creative project except\nYouTube YouTube's algorithm and the type\nof stuff that gets popular and the fan\nbase and how it gets eyes\nI don't attribute to myself but any\nother thing I mean besides YouTube I\nagree obviously I think that you know\nyou can't control exact so you can't\ncontrol YouTube's algorithm like in a\nsense like what I'm saying is completely\nwrong what I want you to think about\nthough is like this idea of\nmanifestation so you have this idea in\nyour head of something that you want to\nsee in the world that is manifestation\nand according to Yogi's from ancient\nindia in order to manifest you need a\nunion of two things you need a union of\nintention and a union of energy you need\nto combine intention with energy and\nwhen I listen to you it sounds like\nthings don't go well you are lacking one\nof those two things so like when you\nthink about creating something for\nNetflix you have this idea of what you\nwant to create but the energy isn't\nbehind it and sometimes when the energy\nis behind something you still are not\nable to manifest and that may be because\nof a YouTube algorithm fine but that\nthere's like like you can have energy\nwithout direction and then like you're\nnot able to create do you think the past\nfailures and the past effort I put into\nstuff where you know and there's a lot\nof them and I know it's a normal thing\nbut do you think those past failures\njust once you like it's like when you're\nthe first time you're motivated to climb\nthat mountain you feels good feel strong\nthen you fail and then you try a second\ntime and then you try a third time and a\nfourth time by the fifth time like it's\nnot the same as the first time you're\nnot kind of like yeah let's get up this\n[ __ ] I'm gonna get there you know I\nmean absolutely which is why what I'm\ntelling you Andy I haven't used the word\nmotivation yeah in my first part of the\nsolution I'm not talking about\nmotivation because you're spot-on\nbecause the human brain is gonna learn\nif I you know if I walk out to my\nbalcony and I drop an egg off the\nbalcony and it crashes to the ground and\nbreaks and then I do that five more\ntimes my brain is gonna start to expect\nthat if I drop an egg it's gonna break\nyeah if you pull yourself up by your\nbootstraps dig deep and find your\nmotivation and give it your best\nand those execs say no thank you after a\nthree-day pilot the second time you you\nget on that roadie like you go to that\nrodeo and you get that bull and then\nlike you learned that lesson again and\nyou learn that lesson again and you\nlearn that lesson again you think you\nlack motivation you don't lack\nmotivation your problem is that you're\nsmart your problem is that you have made\nobservations in the real world and those\nobservations have taught you that\ndisappointment is a probability and as\nlong as you're talking to suits they're\nnot going to get behind your ideas yeah\nI even had a pilot and\n[ __ ] Jimmy Kimmel signed on as a\nproducer he's the guy who discovered me\nby the way but Jimmy Kimmel signed on as\na producer we got him\nhe's a busy guy we got him to be in a\nsketch to pitch it even even that\nthey're like nah and I'm just like when\nyou when you see like when you see like\n[ __ ] that just seemed so ripe and so\nperfect and it's just like nah\nyeah socially so that is gonna\nabsolutely kill your motivation which is\nwhy I think no way forward is to abandon\nmotivation entirely okay your way for it\nis to recognize that motivation is not\nsomething that you can create like you\ncan get inspired that sounds like\nmotivation but what I'm that's why I'm\nusing the words intention energy and\nmanifestation mm-hmm so once you have an\nintention I think you should and this is\ngonna sound so simple but like yeah let\nme just say this and then you let me\nknow if this makes any sense or it's\nsimple or it has no value to you I don't\nwant you to think about motivation I\nwant you to think about your intention\nwhat is it that you want to create and\nhow do you put energy behind it mm-hmm\nand if you can align those two things I\nthink it will become manifest motivation\nis not an issue here disappointment is\nnot an issue here execs are not an issue\nhere YouTube is not an issue here it is\nabout clarifying in your mind what is it\nthat I want to create and then aligning\nyour energy to create that thing because\nevery time a hurdle arises and you don't\nhave a green screen and you don't have\nthis and you don't have that that is\ngonna impact your motivation if you're\nplaying the game of motivation because\nyou have this idea in your head and then\nlike it doesn't sort of turn out in that\nway and then like since it's not turning\nout since your Fant you have this idea\nthat is actually like a fantasy and\nsince the fantasy is not playing out the\nway oh this [ __ ] is hard I need a green\nscreen this camera is not working this\nis not working it impedes your\nmotivation mm-hmm and instead what I\nwant you to have is don't look at the\nend and what you want to create look at\nsit where you are and look in the\ndirection that you want to go and pack\nEnter\ninto that forward process it sounds a\nlot like motivation though that's the\nonly problem it does sound a lot like\nmotivation right so I think like so let\nme put it to you this way sometimes you\nget motivated to create something that\nyou envision in the end mm-hmm right\nand if you're motivated to create this\nthing in the end what happens with\nsetbacks what does that do to your\nmotivation it diminishes it absolutely\nso what I'm talking so there's a\ndifference between looking at the top of\nthe mountain and starting to climb and\nthings getting in the way and being\nwhere you are and focusing on taking the\nnext step yeah I feel like I could do\nthat with stuff that I do on my own that\ndoesn't rely on anyone else but me I\nfeel like that advice is actually good\nadvice first stuff that only involves me\nwhich is fine cuz I could create a lot\nof [ __ ] on my own but when it comes to\ninvolving other people then there's\nother variables that I feel like are out\nof the picture yes and that is exactly\nyour problem is because you use a\ndifferent strategy when other people are\ninvolved that prevents you from doing\nyour best work right that's exactly the\nproblem is that when it's on your own\nyou can actually put forth your you're\nyour perfect creative energy and when\nother people get involved something in\nyour mind changes that prevents you from\ndoing solo work so what I want you to do\nis don't stop doing solo work I want you\nto do solo work in spite of people yeah\nI mean I I get that I feel like I feel\nlike solo work is is definitely more of\nmy ticket because I don't need to rely\non other people why didn't you write the\nthing for Netflix\nprobably because of thinking about my\nprobabilities and thinking about how\nmany times I went into a meeting and\njust led to nothing and then your\nmanager hooks you up but general\nmeetings in that equation there is an v+\nnet flix equals manifest option right\nbut that's exactly my point is that what\nyou should have done is say [ __ ] all\nthat I'm gonna just make this thing and\nif Netflix wants to get on board they\ncan get on board if I have to sit in\nmeetings I have to sit in meetings but\nI'm not going to your factoring Netflix\ninto the equation which kills your\nproductivity so what you need to do is\nfactor them out of the equation and be\nidiotic be perfectly idiotic I'm good at\nbeing an idiot absolutely and just\ncreate whatever weird [ __ ] is in your\nhead and don't worry about the rest of\nthem factor them out of the equation and\nthen show up and just pitch whatever\ncrazy stupid thing you want and then\nthey're like okay we want to come back\nand then you recognize these are just\nthe idiots and you're gonna do your\nthing you're not gonna try to cater to\nthem you're just going to do your thing\nand let them be stupid and you're not\ngonna start playing a multiplayer game\nyou need to treat them like NPCs instead\nof party members yeah because your\nproblem is that when you play a\nsingle-player game you do a fantastic\njob when you play a multiplayer game you\nstop producing yeah it's funny because\nthe very biggest and first thing that I\ndid was single-player my own idiotic my\nown idiocy my own [ __ ] idiotic weird\nrants and sketches and songs and it was\nso cringy basic-cable weird and that's\nwhat MTV wanted but nowadays in 2020\nthat level of energy that I put out you\nknow do they want that you know I mean I\ndon't know if they want that if I go get\nlike say say I go get an independent\nbudget of 50,000 and I go create\nsomething that looks like something in\ntheir wheelhouse and I put my\nenergy into that which that's realistic\ntoo then maybe they'd want it but I have\nto be a realistic into thinking what\nthey're actually gonna get if I'm just\nlike a hundred percent me [ __ ] everybody\nthis is like this all weird ball of\ncrazy Netflix just because it has raw\nenergy it's not gonna be like yeah let's\nlet's say or this let's give this guy\nI'm with you a hundred percent I mean\nright I'm with you a hundred percent and\nI think it is actually irrelevant to\nwhat I'm saying\nright so so I want you to think about\nthis for a second when you're playing a\ngame whether you have party members or\nNPCs you have to account for them mm-hmm\nright but those are fundamentally\ndifferent things okay\nlike you have to account for them but\nwhat I'm saying is that like you should\nyou should create so you do your best\nwork I think when you're solo playing\nand and you are telling me that the more\nthat you account for them what does it\ndo to your productivity well a lot of\ntimes it stops it because I have to like\ncater to them and appeal to them if I\nwant it to be something bigger right\nand so like what's your problem right\nyour problem is that you're not able to\nproduce yeah and the more that you cater\nfor them what happens to your\nproductivity goes down absolutely and so\nyou're saying but if I just am an\nunfettered ball of absolute crazy\nthey're gonna be like that's not for us\nalthough if we really listened to what\nyou said a few minutes ago that seems to\nbe the thing that actually got you\nsuccessful in the first place it was a\ndifferent time then I mean fine no so I\ndo not I would not worry about I would\ntry to shift away from them so even if\nwe don't want to go a hundred percent\nball of crazy I think you've got a real\nall of crazy and then learn like don't\ntry to give them what they want\nmm-hmm dress up what you want to give\nthem mm-hmm and I think that's the big\ndifference\ndoes that make sense yeah that's like a\ndifference between an NPC and a party\nmember and also I've been thinking about\nthis a lot if I put in 100\nan energy to my next crazy thing it\ndoesn't matter if they want it\nultimately if someone wants it that's\ncool if no one wants it as long as I'm\ncreating dope stuff that's new and\noriginal that feels good then you know\nthen I'm chilling absolutely yeah\nright so like now we're both saying the\nsame thing and I've been gearing up for\nthat I mean I literally am a B&B\nI bought gaming chairs I bought desks I\nbought a new microphone I bought a new\nheadphones like just so I could create\n[ __ ] while I'm here good like so the\nlast thing a little bit of a concrete\ntip that is going to satisfy the part of\nyou that wants to be successful okay\nmm-hmm so you're kind of saying like I\ncan't just be an unfettered ball of\ncrazy so be it you can't be an under\nfederal of crazy fine you have to\nconsider what the Netflix execs want\nfine so this is where I want to talk to\nyou about triage do you know what triage\nmeans until I get through some so like\nso in medicine sorry was you know I'm\njust so in medicine we do this thing\nwhere we triage right so we take like\nfive people and we try to figure out\nwho's the sickest mm-hmm who's the\nsickest and what kind of resources do\nthey need and like who's the second\nsickest and who's the third sickest\nwho's the fourth sickest\nso here's the thing Andy you're a\ncreative guy so you're gonna have a\nbunch of ideas right how do you decide\nwhich idea to pursue something that\nfeels polarizing to me okay so I want\nyou to take like five of your polarizing\nideas and then try to figure out which\none feels true to me which one is\nactually a solo player game but also out\nof these five things which one do I\nthink I could sell the best and Netflix\nyeah that's easy for me to do because I\ntake the insanity first and then I\nchisel away beautiful of it and then I\nmake it I basically what what it needs\nis here's the crazy here's the raw and\nthen it needs\nskeleton absolutely you have a skeleton\nand a through-line you could throw that\ncrazy crazy on and then you could have a\nshow out of it\nabsolutely so Andy I think this is what\nyou've got to do man\nand I think I I mean to me it sounds\nweird that you're not already doing this\nbut it's out somewhere in the way I\nthink you got mixed up with worrying\nabout productivity and giving them what\nthey want and that killed your\ninspiration that killed your creativity\nand you weren't able to manifest and I\nthink all it is it's not about really\nchanging anything it's just about\nchanging the way you look at things and\nI think it's like really tap into that\ncrazy but understand that in your head\nno matter how even if you try to give\nNetflix a hundred percent unfettered\ncrazy understand that the the safeguards\non that crazy are gonna be the business\nsense that you have to have in order to\nbe as successful as you are and you'll\ntweak things and tune things but don't\ntry to give them what they want try to\ngive them what you want and then you'll\nfigure out how to put the skeleton on\nthere like that's beautiful right like\nyou know how to do that you don't need\nto worry about them rejecting your\nabsolute crazy because you're never\ngonna give them absolutely crazy but you\nknow side of that put the gelatin on it\nand then go ahead sorry yeah I was just\ngonna say look I see how safe certain\ncontent could be where it just all kind\nof seems the same and I want to shake\nthat up you know I feel like a lot of\nshows are colored by number and they're\nkind of like that goes there that goes\nthere that goes there\nI want the craziness because the\ncraziness is me trying to make something\noriginal and different because there's\nvalue in that it's not oh there's not\nalways value the value is not always\nseen by executives but I think the value\nis there and it's strong because it's\ndifferent from what other yep so this is\na beautiful way to reframe right so the\nquestion isn't about giving them what\nthey want\nit's about finding people those rare\nsouls who will see the value like I have\nto think so you have you seen Tiger King\nyes so I like Tiger King is a beautiful\nexample of everything that you're\ntalking about yeah that's right so if I\ngo to\ngo ahead no it's gonna say it's like gum\no come o ask what is that\nthat's a harmony Korean film okay I\ndon't know he he basically had like he\nbasically took people off like some\nJerry Springer show that were addicted\nto huffing and they they're like you're\nthe actors of this movie now go drown\nsome cats and ghosts go sell the cats to\na Chinese restaurant right so like it's\ncrazy man so I think I think you gotta\ntap into that crazy cuz I think that\nlike if you really look at the things\nthat move forward the entertainment\nindustry they're not the safe bet\nthey're not the things that long execs\nwant\nit's the polarizing [ __ ] absolute I've\nalways a lot of people are like what you\nknow what kind of stuff do you want to\ndo and even early on even though I was\ndoing [ __ ] that sometimes would make\npeople laugh to me the bigger pop was\npeople saying what the [ __ ] did I just\nwatch to me that's more value back\nsaying that is what I say to myself five\ntimes per episode of tire tire King\nexactly right so like I just I cannot\nlike what I love about the show is that\nit has created thoughts in my head that\nI have never had before\nand do you want to sleep with Carroll\nBosque and that's the real question I\nhave for you I do not you should ask me\nif I want to sleep with y'all exotic\nthough that's the better question right\nI mean that I already knew the answer to\nthat's a big yes that's why I asked you\nCarroll but but I I think exactly right\nso I think Andy here's the thing so the\nlast thing kind of a little spiritual\nnugget that'll leave you with is\nunderstand that so I'm gonna try to\nrecap so I think your your problem for\nlack of a better word is that you know\nyou have so you want to create something\nsubstantive and you recognize that you\nhave to get big people behind you and\nyou need production value so be it it's\nnot egotistical we sort of sorted\nthrough that it's because you are an\nartist and you want to create like you\nwant to create a Sistine Chapel and\nthat's not like a five by five canvas\nright like not want to paint something\nthat is human something like this on the\nwall absolutely that's what you want so\nbe it it's not egotistical it's your\ncalling it is your Tata my it is your\nduty it is what you need to do it is\nwhat you were put on this earth to do\nyou were put on this earth to offer\npolarizing things that wake people up in\nthe in the in a world of mass market you\nknow algorithmic [ __ ] that is\ndopaminergic and soulless yeah where our\nMessiah you have to understand that deep\nwithin your Andy that this polarizing\nthing is what we need and we see\nevidence of that it's how you got your\nsuccess it's why Tiger King is\nsuccessful right what execs want is they\nwant adaptations of existing formulas\nthat work they don't know if someone\nwalks in and says I have a show for you\nthat's about a homosexual zoo owner who\nis engaged in a polygamous relationship\nwith two straight men are you talking\nabout me or Tiger King I'm talking about\nyou okay Andy Milonakis the life story a\nwrap on the haters so like the execs are\ngonna be like you're crazy man and then\none person is gonna say you don't like\nwhat they're gonna say is like we want\nversion 2.0 of homeland you want the\nnext homeland that's what they're gonna\nsay but then like some of them and I\nlove this I love because there are execs\nout there who are like not like this and\nI love them because some of them bro\nlike yeah let's make something\nabsolutely crazy let's do it you know\nright you have people it's not that hard\nfor them to do that because if you look\nin history and you see a lot of crazy\nshocking big things like yeah there's\nthe safe play which is like they're\ndating reality shows that you've seen a\nmillion times and then there's the one\noffs that are like boom yeah that our\ndefining moments and like TV absolutely\nbut if you think about it from the\nperspective and executive of an\nexecutive the probability of success\nfrom a safe show is way higher than like\nthe probability of success from a\npolarizing big risk big reward\nabsolutely right and that's not that's\nnot how execs get their job they get\ntheir a job by reliable results yeah and\nbut just going back to you so I think\nyou've got to be that polarizing\ninfluencer and then you got to\nunderstand that like when you like don't\nlet that stop you from going\nNetflix understand that like you need to\nbe the Messiah for Netflix like that's\nwhat you've got to be and you got to go\nthere and when you present your idea if\nthey toss it out the window so be it\nthat was and this is the spiritual\nnugget that was not your Sistine Chapel\nyeah that was you leveling up to make\nthe next Sistine Chapel and there are\ncircumstances there is garma and garma\nwill decide whether that beautiful work\nthat you create becomes famous and is\nshown on 200 screens or never gets shown\nat all but your job is to create it's\nnot to make things successful yeah sure\nand as long as you orient towards that I\nthink you will continue creating and I\nthink you'll you're gonna be successful\nbecause I've I've tried to help people\ndo this and I get I've seen this\nreliably time and time and time again\nwhen successful people start to play it\nsafe and they stop listening to their\ncalling when they start focusing on\ntheir career and stop focusing I mean\nwhen they start when they focus on their\ncareer and ignore their calling they end\nup not only failing but they feel empty\nyeah and I said I feel that twitch to\ntwitch is kind of me playing it safe a\nlittle bit yeah\nso which doesn't mean you have to quit\nit just means that you shouldn't start\nlistening to your calling again and\ndon't worry about your career yeah\nthoughts questions no it makes it it\nmakes a lot of sense honestly like the\none thing that's holding me back with\ntwitch is how much time you have to\nstream for"
