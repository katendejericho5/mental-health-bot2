    "transcript": "[Music]\nall righty folks let's go ahead and\nbegin so welcome to the healthy gamer\nwebinar day - all right so let's get\nstarted so my name is dr. Alok Canoga\nwelcome to the healthy gamer webinar day\n- so we decided to do this webinar\nbecause we you know I know I know a\nbunch of people are kind of stuck at\nhome with kovat and so we thought it\nwould be a good opportunity to offer a\ndifferent kind of content and what we're\nhoping to do is offer more comprehensive\nteaching about various concepts so\nwelcome today - I'm excited I'm glad\nthat you know all of you guys are here\njust a little bit about the structure of\nthe webinar so we're going to start with\n10 minutes of yoga and based on\nyesterday's feedback thank you very much\neveryone who filled it out we are I'm\ngoing to start by actually demonstrating\none round and we're gonna go slower and\nwe're gonna do three rounds today so\nactually yoga may take a little bit\nlonger than 10 minutes\nthe second thing so the topic for the\nday so we do yoga for about 10 minutes\nthen we cover a topic for somewhere\nbetween 30 and 50 minutes and the topic\ntoday is going to be anxiety so I'm\ngonna explain kind of my take on anxiety\nand really not so much we're gonna go\ninto some detail but I think a big part\nof the reason that I'd like to talk\nabout anxiety today is to teach some\nbasic principles about how the mind\nworks and as we better understand like\nwhat are the rules of the mind then I\nthink our ability to control ourselves\nsort of improves over time and so we're\ngonna talk a little bit about anxiety\ntoday and then we'll have time for Q&A\nand I think another piece of feedback\nabout last week's are sorry yesterday's\nwebinar was that people felt like that\nQA was a little bit disorganized I\ncompletely agree and so they're hoping\nfor a little bit more structure and\nmaybe even\na little bit more time for QA so I'm not\nquite sure exactly how we're gonna\nmanage that but we're gonna do our best\nso we'll have a little bit more time for\nQA and then we'll end with about ten\nminutes of meditation so we're gonna\nstart with yoga so I encourage everyone\nto get up and do yoga with me so the\npurpose of doing the webinar at the same\ntime every day and starting it with\nyoga's so that you guys can start out\nwith yoga I think it's a great way to\nstart your day it's a great way to yeah\nit's a great way to start your day it's\na great way to sort of physically get up\nand moving a little bit and we can talk\na little bit more about that so let me\njust this there we go okay so let's do\nit so a reminder that I'm gonna\ndemonstrate one round of Surya Namaskar\nall right so Surya Namaskar is the Sun\nscript phrase that means Sun Salutation\nso this is a set of yoga practice\npractices that's designed to do first\nthing morning and it kind of prepares\nyour body in your mind for the day so\nthe first step of Surya Namaskar is I'm\ngonna I'm gonna stand with my feet close\ntogether a kind of a detention and then\narms kind of relaxed in in namaste\nposition and then the first step is arms\nup so biceps are going to be near the\nears so I'm gonna try to give you guys a\ncouple of like physical landmarks that\nif you try to do the posture is going to\nbe a little bit easier to achieve and\nthen second one is step down and or go\ndown and touch your toes and remember\nthe goal here is not\nyour toes we don't want to bend her\nknees it's really to just bend your back\nand let gravity do the work for you so\ngo ahead and lean down you guys can just\nwatch this round right third round I'm\ngoing to put my hands the palms of my\nhands right next to my feet so they're\nforming kind of a little bit of a lines\nof surety that's the sway that sort of\nmakes sense\nand then what I'm going to do is put one\nleg back and so once again and put and\nleg back here and then what you can\nreally notice about this pose you can\nlook up where you're supposed to look up\nis that you can kind of like lean into\nit and you'll feel like a different\nstructure you can kind of come back out\nlean into it\ncome back out and this knee should kind\nof be right next to your shoulder so\nI'll kind of demonstrate maybe on this\nside okay and then this leg back and now\nwe're going to kind of be in push-up\nposition so you want to be kind of\nstraight and then down and for this\nposition you want toes knees chest so\nyour butt is slightly elevated and then\nfor them and then we push up so hips\ngoing to the ground the back is bent\nshoulders are not like this shoulders\nare rolled out elbows are bent that's\ncompletely fine as you get better you'll\nbe able to push up more but we can stay\nlow it's not a big deal look up and I\nwant you guys to notice when you do yoga\neven as you move a subtle part of your\nbody like your neck you'll notice\ndifferent things in other parts of your\nbody and then we go to part of a passing\nor Mountain Pose once again ears by the\nbiceps\nput your heels into the ground other leg\nforward look up again and then back to\nhead down you'll notice that even\nbetween the first round and the second\nround\nyour flexibility is going to be far more\nincreased and that's the purpose of yoga\nlet me go up again just and then back to\nthe center okay so let's now you guys do\nit with me we're gonna do three rounds\nwe're gonna go slow maybe the CEO is\ngonna take a little bit longer actually\nit's okay so start start with your feet\napart close your eyes go ahead and just\nfeel your body for a moment and now put\nyour feet together feel the instability\nopen your eyes and then close them again\nyou can use this just slight opening and\nclosing of the eyes like open for a few\nseconds feel the stability to return\nclose your eyes feel the instability so\neven that can kind of anchor you in the\npresent it's gonna be

be\ndecreased you'll notice maybe even\npauses between your breaths just not\nusually how we breathing right usually\nit's in out in out your breath is like\nhey man we'll find you we don't we

question for you guys\nokay let's do a poll so we're gonna do a\npoll what do you guys want to talk about\ntoday yoga or anxiety I can we can just\ntalk about yoga actually if you guys\nwant oh all right so let me know what do\nyou so we can just talk about what yoga\nis or we can go back to anxiety and how\nyoga works oh man I love this okay so it\nsounds like we're sticking with anxiety\n[Music]\nNo\n[Music]\nwithin like five seconds I saw a huge\nspike for your anxiety so we'll do that\nthat's okay we'll stick with anxiety\nokay it's all the same anyway okay thank\nyou guys very much I found that very\nhelpful okay so\n[Music]\nOh interesting\n[Music]\nokay so someone suggested that I use a\ndifferent note taking app which I'm\nhappy to but I just realized that I\ncan't screaming capture on this app or I\ndon't know how to so we're actually\ngoing to go back to just regular notes\nokay oh okay all right so let's talk\nabout anxiety oh my god my OCD is\nkilling me okay so when let's go ahead\nand screen share so thank you guys very\nmuch and let's go ahead and go back to\nthis channel your inner boomer okay so\nthen what we're gonna do is this so\nlet's talk about anxiety you guys see in\nthis okay let me just make sure so\nquestion number one what is anxiety\nright let's start with basics no no\ninteresting looks like I can't cap cast\nmaybe it's because it's it's using\nreflector okay so what is anxiety so the\nfirst thing is like let's just think a\nlittle bit about what our experience of\nanxiety is so when I'm anxious about\nsomething I'm worrying right so we use\nthis word worry and so what is worried\nworried is thinking of consequences\nright we're usually worried about stuff\nwe're worried about what are people\ngonna think of me\nwhat are what's gonna happen at work\ntoday what is my boyfriend or girlfriend\ngonna think what are how do I look or\npeople gonna think I'm stupid so there\nare all kinds of thoughts but they're\nbasically thinking about consequences\nusually of your actions like if I go to\nyou know if I go out with friends and I\nopen my mouth is everyone to think I'm\ndumb if I answer a question and I get it\nwrong in class as everyone gonna think\nI'm done and so that's really what we're\nhe is so thinking about consequences and\nso the next question is if we look at\nconsequences this is gonna sound like a\nweird question when do consequences\nhappen and the answer is in the future\nso the first thing to understand about\nanxiety is anxiety is our minds ability\nto predict problems in the future okay\nso so if we think about this so like\nlet's say here's our mind right here's\nour brain whatever it's a bad looking\nbrain five head so we'll give this\nperson dr. K's artwork okay so this is\nwho we are and this is your anxious mind\nright because the anxious mind is kind\nof like always you know it's gigantic it\nfeels heavy and then since we're anxious\nwe're gonna give you a frowny face all\nright that's a mustache and then that's\nyour face okay all right so this is our\nbrain right and what we're gonna so if\nwe think about it like our brain is kind\nof thinking about the future right what\nif\n[Music]\nwhat if what so this is anxiety does\nthat make sense\nso fundamentally our my this is our our\nminds ability to like look into the\nfuture so what that means is that you\nknow if we think about it like how does\nanxiety work it is essentially Minds\npredictive capability so anxiety is\nactually a normal function of the mind\nwhich is our predictive you know kind of\nlike danger like it's predictive and\nlike danger oriented like that's what\nour mind has this capability that sort\nof looks into the future and then let's\n[Music]\nso our mind has this capability to look\ninto the future and predict problems and\nif we didn't have this capability like\nwe wouldn't be alive so this is an\nevolutionary capability so evolution\nhelps us predict problems okay and so\nwhen our problem predicting capability\ngets out of our control\nthis is anxiety so I want you guys to\nthink about this for a second okay so we\nhave our head I'm just gonna make a\ncircle and then it has all these\nfunctions right so danger prediction\nkind of reflecting on the past fantasy\nright when that to is sort of future\noriented has things like imagination\nthese are all the functions of the mind\nlike they're more but these are kind of\nwhat we'll talk about so the interesting\nthing is that when these so generally\nspeaking what we want to do is we want\nto be in control of these functions of\nour mind so you know I want to think\nabout okay if I'm going to you know\nlet's say Co bid the Kournikova\nquarantine is like going on in many\nplaces so we want our mind to be able to\nlook\nto the future and anticipate problems\nright so anticipate problems and this is\nvital because like unless we know how to\nprepare for the future like we're gonna\nget screwed so our mind kind of like I\nsay okay so kovat is going on what do I\nneed to do like how do I prepare so\nthat's like a very healthy part of our\nmind the what anxiety is is when this\nfunction of our mind actually like we\nlose control of it so we don't get to\ndecide when it operates\nthat's what anxiety is so anxiety is\nproblem anticipation out of control\nright and if you think about it that's\nwhat really it really is like if I'm\ngonna if I have social anxiety I'm gonna\ncreate all these kinds of potential\nproblems from my social interaction I\nyou know if I'm worried about my health\nthen I'm like I have a pain in my chest\nand then my mind automatically goes to\nall these different thoughts about oh\nmaybe I have a heart attack maybe I\ncancer maybe have this maybe I have that\nand it's like problem anticipation but\njust blown out of proportion\nso this kind of comes back to and I'm\nnot gonna I'm gonna just steer away from\nmy earlier drawing so this is the mind\nso anxiety is future-focused\nokay so now what does this mean so like\nlet's just think about this like can you\nhave anxiety about the past or is all\nanxiety focused in the future can you\nhave any anxiety in the present and some\npeople will say oh you can't have\nanxiety in the past like I'm I'm super\nanxious and I think about last night\nlike I woke up this morning and I'm\nfeeling super anxious because last night\nI went out with some friends and then I\nmade a joke and then like six people\nlaughed but then it was sort of like\ndirected at the seventh person because\nthis is how anxiety we're excited it's\nsuper complicated and then you kind of\nnotice that that seventh person laughed\nmaybe they were offended so isn't that\nthinking in the past the answer is\nactually no because what is anxiety\nreally doing it's thinking about a path\nevent and it's thinking about the\nconsequences in the future right even\nwhen you think about anxiety like if you\nhave anxiety about past events if you\nreally pause and study yourself well but\nyou're really worried about is the\nfuture impact of your actions in the\npast\nso anxiety is always anxiety is always\nfuture focused so this is like piece of\nhomework number one right I encourage\nyou to examine this point so between now\nand tomorrow I don't want you to think\nabout every single anxious thought or\nlike whenever you have an anxious\nthought you can remember it look at\nyourself and try to figure out okay am i\nworried about something in the present\nthe past or the future and see if this\nthis is my assertion you guys tell me if\nthat's true or if that's false\nokay so anxiety is essentially our\nfuture like problem predicting\ncapability so can it exist in the past\nor can it exist in the present second\nthing that I want to note is that since\nanxiety is essentially a normal function\n[Music]\ngone wild what is that you know what are\nsome of the implications of that so the\nfirst is that the higher the IQ the\nworse the anxiety so just think about\nthis for a second okay so if you have a\nfunction that predicts problems the\ngreater your analytical capability the\nstronger your analytical capability the\ngreater chance there is that it's going\nto be able to predict more problems and\nwhat this means is that if people try to\nfight against your anxiety and by people\nwe're including your\nself the smarter you are the stronger it\nis so when you try so a lot of times the\nresponse is reassurance and what do I\nmean by that people tell you you say oh\neveryone thinks I'm a dumbass and then\nsomeone comes to you and says oh no man\nlike we all like you we think you're a\nfantastic person and the smarter you are\nlike the stronger you are at knocking\nthat away right you say no no dude like\nyou really don't understand and they can\nmake all these different arguments to\ntry to convince you that you don't have\nanything to worry about that people like\nyou and then your anxiety is like that\nI'm pretty sure I'm right about this\nbecause this is what I want you guys to\nunderstand is that this is actually a\nnormal function of your mind so if your\nmind is strong if you're high level then\nyou know your your stats are gonna be\nhigh and like if anxiety takes control\nof you then like its stats are gonna be\nhigh I want you guys to think kind of\nthink about you know in games like their\nmind control mechanics right and like\nyou want to mind control the strongest\nenemy you can because then you're gonna\nget the strongest ally and anxiety is\nsort of like mind controlling your it's\ncould taking control of your problem\nanticipation your ability to predict\nproblems and it's kind of like using it\nagainst you so the first thing to\nunderstand is that anxiety is not\nnecessarily an illness I mean I think it\ncertainly is an illness but it's not an\nillness in the way that an infection\nlike Kove it isn't illness right it's\nnot something that happens to you it's\nactually a part of you that is\nmalfunctioning it's not external so next\nthing to kind of think a little bit\nabout is that most things in our brain\nare learned and I want you guys to\nappreciate for a second that anxiety is\nusually learned okay and what I mean by\nthat is that you know if you're worried\nabout social anxiety there's usually a\nreason you're worried about that as\nopposed to health care anxiety or other\nkinds of things so if we think about\nwhen does the mind when does the\npredictive capability of the mind\nactivate it is to protect us from\nproblems so depending on what's Happ\n- in the past your anxiety will manifest\nin different ways okay so this is why\npeople are anxious about different\nthings so the more that you talk to\npeople with anxiety the more you\ndiscover that like their anxiety traces\nback to like particular events and\nthat's to learn behavior because if you\nthink about you know if I'm worried\nabout getting burned by a stove why am I\nworried about getting burned by a stove\nit's because I've been burned by a stove\nbefore and the more recent the injury\nthe more likely I am to be worried about\nit you know if you are dating someone\nwho breaks up with you and then two\nmonths later wants to get back together\nyour anxiety is going to be like what if\nthey break up with me again like that\ncomes from some some injury that you've\nyou've experienced and that's the way\nthat our brain works our brain anytime\nwe suffer or we we take damage of some\nkind our brain tries to learn from it\nand protect us and the way that our\nbrain tries to protect us is through\nanxiety right so it predicts problems so\nthis is kind of interesting because if\nwe kind of like look at this this is not\nnecessarily I mean sure it causes us\nsuffering and we'll kind of get to that\nfor a second in a second but I want you\nguys to first realize that your anxiety\nis a part of your mind\nthat is actually like you know it's not\nsomething you need to get rid of it's\nsomething that you need to tame it's\nkind of like a horse that's gone out of\ncontrol and is like bucking around and\nyou need to calm it down and help it do\nwhat it's supposed to do which is\nactivate when you want to activate okay\nso let's just think a little bit about\nwhat anxiety looks like\n[Music]\nwhat does anxiety look like okay so\nanxiety usually manifests as thoughts\nabout the future and then anxiety also\nhas a focus on the self so what does\nthat mean so if you think about like if\nyou if you write down and I encourage\nyou guys to do this so task number two\nis write down ten anxious thoughts and\nwe're actually gonna switch gears for a\nsecond so this is what I want you guys\nto do his anxiety something you can\nreally switch on and off we're gonna see\nright ah I'm very good\nso we're gonna get to the physical\nsensations in a second so I want you\nguys can someone just post an example of\na like in chat some way just give me an\nexample of an anxious thought can I get\nan example I don't know how much of a\nlag there is no one likes me Oh perfect\nwhat if I can't get a girlfriend\nbeautiful okay what if I can't get a\ngirlfriend okay okay okay will I be good\nenough that's good guys thank you very\nmuch will I be good enough to pass the\ntest right so I want you guys to notice\na couple of things the first is this you\ncan't have anxiety without I or me\nactually I mean you can you can be\nanxious about other people but generally\nspeaking a lot of the anxiety that we\nexperience is focused on the self the\nsecond thing is that like what is the\ntense I mean yeah what is it like what\nis the direction of these thoughts right\nso like will what if so these are future\noriented and these are focused on the\nself right you guys see that and this\nstuff can change this stuff is actually\nkind of irrelevant this is the important\nthing so if we're talking about how\nanxiety works like what is the nature of\nanxiety like how does it function in\nyour mind if we're opening up the hood\nthis is the consistent part because this\ncan be like completely random right will\nI dot dot dot what if da da da and this\nstuff this stuff has to do with like you\nknow specifically what your anxieties\nabout and I want you guys to write down\nten anxious thoughts and and\nsee like what about this pattern applies\nand what doesn't so throughout your day\nif you have an anxious thought just make\na note of it and write it out and I want\nyou guys to understand that you can't\nsay something like some people\nso some people's like are using words\nright so they're saying getting replaced\ngetting replaced is not an anxious\nthought so you guys have to capture the\nfull thought right so so NOAA says\ngetting replaced so what I want you guys\nto think about that's not actually the\nthought that you have in your head so\ntrain yourself because what that really\nthought is the real thought is what if I\nget replaced that's the full thought and\npart of this process of understanding\nand overcoming anxiety is to be clear\nand descriptive about what is going on\nin your mind\nso as you can you know try to really\ncapture the fullness of the thought okay\nso the next thing to think about anxiety\nso the first thing is with their\nthoughts right so there's their thoughts\nof anxiety and then they're also\nfeelings see dr. K learned something\nthere are also feelings so the feelings\nare like pain in your chest\n[Music]\nnausea butterflies headache sweaty palms\nshortness of breath\nright here are examples of physical\nsensations that come with anxiety so the\nfirst thing to understand is that\nanxiety has cognitive and physical\nmanifestations so these are\nfundamentally different right and you\nguys have to understand that like like\nnotice both of these things and\nsometimes you have an\nthought without the sensations and\nsometimes you have the sensations\nwithout a thought so we're gonna get to\nhow to deal with each of these because\nthe the pathway is a little bit\ndifferent okay so now what do we do with\nthis so there are thoughts in there\nthere are physical sensations so the\nother thing that I so now what we're\ngoing to talk about is like what is your\nmind how do these thoughts that we have\nhow does anxiety affect our mind so I\nknow this is kind of a weird kind of\nquestion right like like we don't really\nthink about we think like oh I'm anxious\nand that's sort of like I want to stop\nbeing a anxious but let's try to figure\nout like that's not actually that's not\nsufficient if we really want to\nunderstand anxiety we have to think a\nlittle bit about what is the implication\nor what is happening in our mind when I\nhave an anxious thought so how does it\naffect our mind so the first thing is\nthat anxious thoughts are circular okay\nso I want you guys to just think about\nthat so anxious thoughts lead to more\nthoughts which lead to more thoughts\nwhich lead to more thoughts and then we\nkind of end up where we started guys\nagree so this is called rumination and\nthis is actually a hijacking of\nsomething called like our\nproblem-solving thought process right so\nproblem thinking solution and then so\nlet's say anxiety relaxation\nright and then actually decrease in\nthought so I want you guys to look at\nthese two things okay so this is\nproblem-solving let me try to fix this\nokay and then move that up back over\nhere okay so let's just think about that\nright\nthis is rumination and this is anxiety\nand this is problem-solving so do you\nguys see the difference between the do\nyou get any kind of the difference\nbetween like these two processes\nso this one is productive and both of\nthem start from the same place like they\nstart with anxiety right like you're\nworried about something but one is a\nproductive problem-solving process and\nthe other is kind of like a self fueling\nprocess so we can think about\nproblem-solving is thinking through\nthings right you start at point a and\nyou go to point Z and then anxious\nthinking is you start at point a and\nthen you end up at point a so you never\nget anywhere so what this means is that\nthat if we think about this like anxiety\nis exhausting because it doesn't stop\nand problem-solving is relaxing because\nyou kind of like think through things\nand then you feel good about yourself so\nanxiety sort of exhausts when we think\nabout how does anxiety affect the mind\nthe first thing that it does is it's\ncircular and it ends up exhausting the\nmind and so if we think about how do\npeople cope\n[Music]\nso what are the coping mechanisms for\nanxiety right so it's stuff that what\nwhat is the main coping mechanism of the\nanxiety is to shut off thoughts or mind\nso good examples of this are sleep\ngaming drugs right there there are\nthings that essentially try to shut off\nour thoughts because this is this is not\ngetting anywhere right it's not like\nit's not doing anything for us so it's\ncircular and so the only general e\nspeaking the solution that we have to\nanxiety is to shut it off or you know\nturn off the mind or shut off our\nthoughts the problem is that what\nhappens so if we do this what happens\nwhen the mind turns back on right this\nis the real problem so let's say you\nstart playing video games like you're\nworried oh am I going to fail out of\nclass am I prepared for the test that\nthat feeling is exhausting you guys are\nthinking about that for a while and then\nyou're like oh I can't take this anymore\nI'm exhausted I don't feel good you\nstart to play a video game and then it's\nrelief it's sweet sweet relief and then\nafter you play the video game then you\nknow if you turn off the video game like\nwhat happens the anxious feelings come\nback you're just back to square one\nyou're right back here because you're\nnot actually solving any problems okay\nso the second thing to understand is\nthat so if we think about this this so\nthis process if we think about\nproblem-solving leads to a decrease in\nthought anxiety leads to an increase in\nthought so this is what I want you guys\nto kind of think a little bit about okay\nso what happens when we increase thought\nversus the\nChris thought so this is our mind and\nthere are some things that we do that\nsort of increase our thoughts and some\nthings that we do that decrease our\nthoughts okay so what this essentially\nmeans is that when we feed the mind we\nincrease thoughts and we when we\nessentially starve the mind we decrease\nthoughts and what do I mean by this like\nit's kind of like you know when you when\nyou have an anxious thought that anxious\nthought starts to breed right it's like\noh my god this person doesn't like me\nand then this is gonna happen and then\nthis is gonna happen and then this is\ngonna happen so what that looks like is\nanxious thought right so let's say\nanxious thought number one and then okay\nand then that leads to number two which\nleads to number three and then one\nthought leads to another leads to\nanother right so what we're doing is\nwe're actually creating more and more\nthoughts the other thing that happens is\nlike sometimes when people have anxiety\nthey try to argue so this is mechanism\nnumber two so you try to tell yourself\nagainst the thoughts and this can be\nyourself or other people okay and so as\nyou argue against the thoughts what\nhappens the thoughts just grow it leads\nto thought number four number five and\nnumber six right so do you guys see how\nthey're trying to argue against the\nthoughts if we look at the mechanism of\nmind we see that arguing against your\nthoughts actually does not work and in\nfact makes your anxiety\nworse right this is the same problem\nit's all the same thing\nso then the question becomes what do we\ndo about that right so like if if this\nis if we assume that thoughts kind of\nbreed other thoughts or we assume that\nconflict within the mind so the other\nway to describe this is tension actually\nthat's not this but that's so this\nprocess here is tension so this creates\ntension in the mind right when you try\nto argue against yourself you get\nyourself riled up and the more tension\nyou create the more active the mind\nbecomes so if we think about this you\nknow how do we how does the mind how can\nI say come up with the right word for\nthis what makes the mind grow right so\nwe're talking about feeding so tension\nmakes the mind grow number one right so\nthis can also include I'm gonna these\nare essentially synonyms but conflict\nwhat else makes that mind girl\nexcitement things like fantasy so I want\nyou guys to think about a daydream right\na daydream is one thought leading to\nanother thought leading to another\nthought leading to another thought and\nthe mind locks this and so if we think\nabout the the a active mind an act of\nmind is not really relaxed when you\nthink about like fantasy your mind isn't\nrelaxed right it's like super excited\nand it's like active super super active\nwhen your intention when you're in\nconflict when you're in worry your mind\nis not relaxed and what is a relaxed\nmind mean I I pause it to you guys that\na relaxed mind has fewer thoughts\nso if you think about like when is your\nmind relaxed okay so when does this\nhappen so the first thing is that if we\ndo this right if we find a solution that\nleads to relaxation then you don't have\nto worry about anymore\nthe amount of thoughts once you come up\nwith a good solution and buy a good\nsolution I don't mean a fictional or\nfantasy solution I mean an actual\nsolution that calms you down leads to a\ndecrease in thought so when does this\nhappen solution number two sunset number\nthree shavasan okay that's that last\npose that we did after the yoga like how\nactive was your mind number four\nmeditation number five\neating a cookie with full awareness\n[Music]\nright so let me ask you guys something\nwhat time frame are these things focused\non where are you\nare you in the past the present or the\nfuture cookie cleanse absolutely present\nright so I want you guys to think about\nthis if just think about this for a\nsecond okay if if anxiety is literally\nlike the definition of anxiety is to\nhave thoughts in the future can anxiety\nexist if your mind is in the present\nwe're thinking about cognitive anxiety\nokay literally can anxiety exist if\nwe're focused in the present does shower\nthoughts count as a relaxed mind\nabsolutely Ezri can't I add gaming to\nthe list absolutely absolutely\n[Music]\nso I want you guys to think about this\nright so now we're gonna talk let's talk\nabout gaming this is sounds crazy\nso when or games fun and when are games\nless fun so when you're fully engaged so\nI started playing this game called deep\nrock galactic which I think isn't\namazing so like yesterday there's this\nthing where you have a timer and like a\ntimer counts down you have to like get\non a ship before the timer runs out and\nlike we were playing this game and like\nyesterday the timer was ticking down and\nwe had like six seconds left and we\nweren't sure if we were gonna make it\nand in that moment my mind was thinking\nabout nothing except this moment and it\nwas like I started cheering it was 11:30\nat night I started cheering after we\nmade it because one of us made it and so\nthe mission was successful and my wife\nwas like you're being really loud so\nthere are times when gaming makes us\nlive is crazy Scott sounds in the\npresent and I want you all to understand\nthis if gaming did not do this this\nwould not work right so if we think\nabout sleep drugs gaming they're able to\nbring us to something like the present\nwhen is gaming less fun when we're\nthinking\nabout the future in the game if I'm\nplaying a game of League of Legends or\ndota and I have someone who's feeding\nwhy is that not fun it's because I'm\nthinking about the next five minutes I'm\nnot thinking about now I'm thinking\nabout oh god they're their ADC or their\ncarries getting fed we're gonna lose or\nmy so-and-so is a [ __ ] we're gonna\nlose we're gonna lose we're gonna lose\nwe're gonna lose I'm going to have to\nsit let's look at it I'm going to have\nto sit in this game for 30 minutes okay\nguys let's look for where is where are\nthe important words give you guys a\nlittle hint let's go back and examine\nour anxiety words wait where did it go\n[Music]\nhere we go right so what are the\nimportant words future-oriented in self\ndo we see those here future-oriented\nitself to this crap doesn't matter\ndoesn't matter doesn't matter this is\nthis is unhappiness of the mind so in\ngaming it's actually a beautiful example\nbecause actually if you think about you\nknow if you think about like meeting the\ndeadlines and Deepak galactic if you\ndon't think you're going to make it\nthen that is actually anxiety provoking\nbut there are times there are times when\nyou're playing a video game where your\nmind is fully focused in the present\nyou're not actually worried about making\nit you're trying to make it so I want\nyou guys to notice this difference\nworrying about winning and trying to win\nwhat's the difference here where are we\nwith this one what's the time where are\nwe when we're worrying about winning\nwhat do you guys think so let's do\nanother poll oh sorry cancel what time\nframe are you in when you are worrying\nabout winning asked present hey you guys\ntell me right beautiful so let's do\nanother one\nokay oh looks like I can't do another\none yet oh I can't how do I show poll\nresults okay so it's like 95 percent to\n4 percent when where is the time frame\nof your mind\nwhen you are trying to win asked present\nyou guys can't see the bowl interesting\nwe have to learn how to do that or\ndisplay results at the end of poll I see\nokay\ngot it fixed fixed saved see look at\nthat just think about that for a second\nwhen you're trying to win a game it's a\nlot of fun\nwhen you're worried about losing it\nsucks even when you know that that when\nyou know you've won how fun is that game\nthat's the next question right so let's\nask that one so\nokay so now we're gonna do one more okay\nwhat's more fun trying to win a game or\nknowing that you've basically one time\nto win knowing you won let's see this\none okay\nsee if there's difficult\nsome amount what do you guys think is\nmore fun now interesting huh now I think\nthe interesting thing about knowing\nyou've won is that a lot of times our\ngames have certain outcomes that we want\nright like we're grinding towards\nsomething and even if you're grinding\ntowards something that grinding can be\nsomewhat present focus which is like\nit's kind of weird and you really have\nto look at that\nbecause in that moment you know the the\ngrind is like what you're doing and\nthat's why you want to win because you\nwant the outcome but even in that moment\nyou're kind of present within the frame\nof Briony which is complicated but right\nso there is a little bit there's a\nlittle bit more um grinding is in the\npresent right grinding ing so now let's\ntry to kind of wrap things up and see\nwhat we've learned okay so we haven't\nreally gotten a chance to talk about\nphysical anxiety that's the first thing\nbut hopefully I've convinced you guys\nthat anxiety first of all so let's go\nthrough conclusion okay\nnumber one anxiety is a normal part of\nthe mind gone actually let's just go\nwith this\nI like this gone wild okay number one\nnumber two anxiety has two components a\ncognitive component and a physical\ncomponent okay\nso we haven't really talked much about\nphysical anxiety today which is okay\nwe'll get to that number three is that\nanxiety is future-focused\nand all oftentimes has rumination or\nunproductive thinking and grows with\nattention okay so now my question to you\nguys is what do we do about this right\nso for let's think about the structure\n[Music]\nWow my handwriting's man okay dr. K is\ngonna take a handwriting course\nstructure of the anxious thought which\nis I me write plus future plus specific\ncontent based on your past experience so\nI want you guys to notice this for a\nsecond a lot of times when psychiatrists\nor therapists try to help someone with\ntheir anxiety what they actually focus\non is this right Oh tell me about why\nyou're worried about social anxiety just\nthink about this for a second we have\nsocial anxieties a different diagnosis\nfrom let's say a phobia yeah or a\ndifferent kind of anxiety health anxiety\nsocial anxiety western medicine focuses\non different kinds of content in class\nsuffice these anxieties differently\nright you guys see that this is where\nwestern psychiatry or Western medicine\nis focused what I want you guys to focus\non what the Yogi's focus on is these two\nthey focus on these because the cool\nthing is that you can fix someone's\nsocial anxiety and then they'll still\nhave health anxiety or they'll still\nhave impostor syndrome or any number of\nother things a phobia the phobias are a\nlittle bit different to be honest but\nthat's actually not a good example so\nthe nature of a phobia and the content\nof a phobia is actually different for\nanxiety No okay so impostor syndrome so\nlike even if we check this off the list\nthat we still have to do these right\nthis is what Western medicine does so\nnow I'm going to ask you guys what is\nthe solution to this how do we fix this\none bring mind to present okay second is\ndon't feed the mind so what that means\nis don't argue don't even go for\nreassurance no argument no reassurance\n[Music]\nbecause our mind rebelled against that\nright so we want to avoid these and\nwe'll talk a little bit practically\nabout how to do that in the future the\nsecond thing so I want you guys to see\nthis for a second so one is to bring\nthat in mind to the present so if you do\nsomething like yoga or you do some\ncentering activity like this is how\nmeditation helps anxiety because\nmeditation brings your mind to the\npresent that's what meditation is and\ntherefore you can't be anxious number\ntwo this is the next thing is to get rid\ndecrease the ego\nthis is the real answer to anxiety I\nwant you guys to think about this so\nthis is the self right so do you guys\nget anxious about things that are like\nlike how much of your anxiety has to do\nwith you if you can remove you from the\nequation then how much how powerful is\nyour anxiety I'll give you guys an\nexample so let's say that I go to class\nand I'm ice I start to say something and\nthen I'm afraid that these people are\ngonna think that I'm an idiot\nand let's say that you're in a room of\nrandom strangers who you're never gonna\nsee again are you less likely to speak\nwith the strangers are more likely to\nspeak with the strangers right so if you\ncan remove your sense of self from the\nequation if you don't have to worry\nabout your ego and what people are gonna\nthink about you then your anxiety goes\ndown right okay so let's think about\nthis um let me okay if you guys want to\npull it that's fine let's pull it let's\ndo this okay are you more worried about\n[Music]\nlooking stupid in front people you're\ngoing to see again or people who you\nwill never see again\n[Music]\n[Music]\nI pull it\nlet's see no gotta hit another button\nexcellent question to poll see so this\ngets tricky we can explore it further\nright so like like like or do you feel\nmore comfortable when you're so here's\nthe other way to put it like so to think\nabout the ego is do you feel more\ncomfortable when you're anonymous right\nwhy do people with social anxiety\nfunction better on the internet and\nbehind computer screens and away from\nother people it's because they can\nprotect that they can isolate their ego\nor sense of self this is why anonymity\n[Music]\nthis is why anonymity is protective so\nthe other thing that you can do is you\ncan so one ways anonymity is a way to\nlike cover the self but the other thing\nthat you can do is you can sort of start\nto dissolve the ego right and in the way\nthat you dissolve the ego this is when\nwe talk about meditation we're gonna\nhave to have we're gonna have a whole\nday on ego or more than one day you can\ndo a whole semester on ego if you want\nto but basically like I want you guys to\nthink about someone who's confident is\nsomeone who is less likely to be\ninfluenced by the opinion of others and\nso they actually their ego goes down and\nas their ego goes down they're less\nanxious because the opinions of other\npeople's don't kind of matter to them so\nin terms of what to do about it this is\nthe first thing that I want you guys to\nfocus on is if you can bring your mind\nto the present literally anxiety cannot\nexist physical anxiety is different I'm\ntalking about cognitive anxiety so if\nyour mind is in the present you cannot\nbe anxious that is like a fact and I\nencourage you guys so in my opinion it's\nnot a fact it's my opinion and I\nencourage you guys to test that and see\nfor yourself whether you can be anxious\nwhile you are in the present and if you\nare in the present because we think\nabout this way right so remember that\nbeing in the present is this is what we\nkind of call\nall this stuff is relaxing you guys see\nthat anything that is present is going\nto be relaxing and can you be anxious\nwhile you're relaxed it's kind of like\nan oxymoron so I encourage you guys to\nexamine this and let's even think about\neating a cookie like so if I eat a\ncookie and I can just sit and enjoy the\ncookie then it's fine if I eat a cookie\nand I'm worried about gaining weight and\nthat this is gonna make me look fat then\nit's not fun\ntake whatever example you want to look a\nsauce salmon yourself see what you\ndiscover we're gonna do questions okay\nso let's start with I don't know how to\nspecify people but we're gonna actually\nstart with questions about how what's\nyour question let's do so okay so\nRaymond we're gonna start with you buddy\nlet's see if this works I've clicked a\ncheckbox okay so one of the pieces of\nfeedback that we got is that we want one\nquestion at a time all right Raymond\ntalk to me buddy hello\nokay all right I'm gonna fit\nFelipe Rico and one teen you guys up for\nquestions cuz I don't hear Raymond ah\n[Music]\nokay oh I see so I see that there's a\nbutton for audio got it hello hey\nRaymond\noh I can't hear Raymond I can't hear you\nbuddy\nRaymond you have to turn the microphone\nbutton on on the top somebody's speaking\nit's not you all right all right who's\nspeaking do you have a man yeah hello\nhey food babe oh yeah hi so when we were\ntalking before sorry I have stuff\nwritten down you talked about the first\ntwo parts about that sorry my webcam\nmessed up we're talking about that I\nthat I will and then we were talking\nabout the part where we're thinking\nabout in the future and you said that we\ndidn't want to seek reassurance about\nour thoughts because we'd be fighting\nagainst that and create more thoughts\nbut how do I fix my assumption about\nlike for example when we were talking\nabout all of this I was thinking about a\nsituation about me thinking that my\nroommate doesn't like me as much as the\nother roommates and if I don't get\nreassurance that my roommate likes me as\nmuch which i think is probably true I'm\njust being very anxious about it how do\nI fix the anxiety if I don't get\nreassurance about it so let me ask you\nsomething when you get reassurance about\nit\nwhat does it do to your anxiety oh my\ngod my web comes messing up the when I\nget reassurance about it logically it\nwould help my anxiety because if she\nsays that's not what I'm asking you I'm\nasking you what does it do to your\nanxiety what it does to my anxiety is it\nprobably creates more thoughts no I'm\nasking you so when so you know you're\nconcerned that your roommate doesn't\nlike you yeah have you sought\nreassurance about this in the past no\nthis is just a thing that came up today\nso that's why I was relating about it\nwhen you okay have you been anxious\nabout something before yes and what when\nsomeone reassures you what does that do\nto your anxiety\nit depends on the situation I guess in a\nlot of cases my anxiety doesn't believe\nthem and then I think about reasons why\nthere may be to be telling me this to\nmake me feel better\nand yeah it's a big thought loop yep I\nguess it depends on the situation as\nwell I don't think that's the universal\nthing across anxiety so give me an\nexample of where reassurance helps you\nlike in this room a kiss I feel like\nthat would help not one that could\nhappen like when that has happened maybe\nme going to a lecturer talking about a\ngrade and saying I'm not I I'm anxious\nabout this exam because I don't think\nI'm prepared enough and I talked to the\nlecture and the lecture then explains to\nme about how according to him I had been\nprepared and then talks to me through\nall of that and that maybe helps me has\nthat helped you in the past yes okay\nso I think that that is different\nbecause what that so I know this sounds\ncrazy but when we say reassurance I want\nyou to understand that reassurance is\nnot what the outside world gives you\nbecause in both cases you're saying that\nsomeone from the outside tries to\nreassure you right yeah someone says\nokay you're gonna do fine on the test\nand someone else says okay you're\nactually a really smart person even\nthough the signals from the outside are\nexactly the same in one case it fuels\nyour anxiety and in another case it\ndoesn't feel your anxiety yeah does that\nmake sense so the first thing that we\nneed to understand is that that has\nnothing to do with the outside because\nif the outside is giving us the same\nthing and our response is differential\noh that makes that it's not coming from\nthe outside it's coming from here that\nmakes a lot of sense right so then the\nquestion is what is different in here\nand I think in some cases what's\ndifferent is the way that your mind is\nokay\nthis makes sense cuz it's it can be like\nyour confidence that is different as\nwell because if I'm not confident like\nif inside maybe I do think I'm smart I\ndo think I do well in a test and I am\nmore confident about that then when I\nhear the reassurance it will help me\nconfirm maybe my own thoughts that I was\nlike confirm my confidence but then when\nother situations maybe if I'm internally\nnot confident and my ego is gonna be\ndamaged maybe if a girl doesn't like me\nor something then it\nwell it won't actually help because my\nego will be fighting against it so I\nthink that that's possible so what I\nwould encourage you to do Felipe is to\nexamine this the main thing so remember\nwe're not talking about I mean we're\ntalking about individual situations as\nexamples to understand principles all\nright now we're talking about today is\nnot solving for the equation of a\nparticular line we're trying to figure\nout y equals MX plus B we're trying to\nfigure out one of the variables and I'm\ntelling you that if two people in\nseparate situations give you reassurance\nand then one that helps your anxiety and\nin another it doesn't help your anxiety\nit doesn't have anything to do with the\noutside it has to do with the inset okay\nthe next thing is is I want you to and I\nwant you to think about remember that\nthere are two problem-solving routes\nright one is anxiety what's the other\none I mean I sort of said it but do you\nremember the two diagrams well the the\noh yeah once the problem solving so it\ngoes from the like you have the problem\nand you have a solution and then there's\nanxiety thought loop right so the\nquestion is when you sit down with a\nprofessor which mode of operation does\nyour mind move into okay I'm going to\nthe problem solving so you have to tell\nme\ndon't hypothesize yeah any logic go and\nstudy it I guess I think what your\nprofessor does is walks you through the\nproblem-solving group loca which then\nrelaxes the mind okay great question\nokay\nno a thank you so much all right let's\nsee if we've got rain I'm gonna give you\nthe boot okay fully bad how are you by\nRaymond no one no sorry buddy okay we're\ngonna invite a couple more people I know\nyou guys say one person at a time but\nlike because of these technical\ndifficulties can you hear me yep who is\nthat\nthis is one okay I'm gonna invite Reece\nsomeone else and Victor just why we've\ngot one on the question go ahead one\nokay so my question is kind of big can a\nphilosophical but I feel like this\naffects my anxiety my motivation pretty\nmuch everything about myself how do I\ndeal with\npessimism and like challenging like big\nworldviews like so I'm a little nervous\nlike a like biological determinism like\nbeing afraid that like I'm capable of\nchange okay so so once again I'm not\ngonna answer the content of your\nquestion because like you said that's a\nbig question and instead what I'm gonna\ndo is we're gonna look at the mechanism\nof your question yeah okay so let's\nstart by a second okay let's let's try\nto examine your thoughts so tell me a\nlittle bit more about what what is that\nI don't understand what you mean what\ndid you understand like what you say\nlike I have you know this philosophical\nsomething rather can you say can you say\nthat again I don't know what that means\nso what what I mean by pessimism that I\nam incapable of change and incapable of\novercome anxiety I am incapable of\nchange right so let's think about what\nis the tense of your statement aspirin\nis incorrect hmm oh I suppose yeah I\nsuppose I'm incapable changed in the\nteacher exactly right so now we have to\nbe tricky we have to be careful because\nthe mind is tricky and just because\nyou're using a verb in the present tense\ndoes not mean that this is in the\npresent tense right are you saying\nsitting there and you're saying that I\nam incapable of change that's not what\nyou're saying what you're really I think\nwhat this really is is I'm afraid I'm\nnever going to\nchange yeah what do you think is that\nwhat that's correct because because\nhere's the thing like I I know this is\ngonna sound I know this is gonna sound\ncrazy but so sometimes you know I I work\nwith patients with cancer really\nfascinating in terms of like\nunderstanding the mind so I'm going to\ndie how do you think this person feels\nonce when a terminal cancer patient\nunderstands that they're going to die\nhow do you think they feel um I guess it\ndepends on how they feel about death\nright mm-hmm\nso they could be accepting they could be\nscared\nsure so so I know this is gonna sound\ncrazy but what is the tense of this\nstatement future incorrect dammit I know\nit sounds bizarre but it's not it like\nit's not it's because this looks like a\nfuture statement right so I just I need\nto explain a little bit so sometimes I\ntalk to a cancer patient who recognizes\nand accepts that death is inevitable for\nthat and bizarrely when they recognize\nthat truth that is a truth that comes\nfrom the present it's not actually like\na fear of the future it's not even in\nthe future it's like an acceptance in\nthe now that death is inevitable does\nthat make sense yeah and bizarrely that\nthis leads to peace it's bizarre it's\nthe weirdest thing but when someone\naccepts in the present that's something\nthat some action is inevitable they\nactually like relax because it's that\nboat has sailed\nyou can lament it you can grieve so\nthey're gonna grieve they're gonna be\nsad they're gonna be filled with lament\nmaybe some amount of regret but\nunderneath it all there's still peace\nwho is bizarre yeah okay so so that's I\nmean that's sort of a random aside I\njust I don't know exactly I mean\nhopefully that was helpful for people I\nfelt like that was\nI'm not exactly sure why so let's go\nback to this okay so now you tell me and\nit's it's is it one yes great okay so\none so when you say like what do we do\nabout this you tell me like what there\nwhat are our solutions right so like you\nsay like I'm never gonna change you also\nsaid some other stuff about the planet\nright\nyeah like well I mean I believe that the\nuniverse is biologically determined ok\nbiological determinism fine what else\nwhat other kind of pessimistic thoughts\nyou have I mean I think it all really\nstems from there okay sure so oh you\nknow what in the purpose for the purpose\nof this seminar you know what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna take this and we\ndon't actually care about that we don't\ncare about that either what are you\ngonna do so what do you what do you do\nabout fear\nsure in general like how should you\napproach this problem right because you\nget that if I start talking to you about\nbiological determinism this is gonna be\nintellectual masturbation for an hour\nand you're not gonna get anywhere yeah\ndoes that make sense cuz you've done it\nbefore does that make sense\nright doing that exactly so that's not\nwhere your answer lies and this is\nbizarre because like I said in\npsychiatry we focus on the content of\nthe mind and in general we think that\nsolutions are external and like\ncontent-based like I don't know how else\nto say that like it's a kind of a weird\nsegment I don't even know how many\npeople are going to understand it but\nlike we think that the solution to you\nknow climate change is in the outside\nworld which obviously it is but also\nlike anxiety about climate change can\nsomewhat come from the outside world but\nalso like I want you to think about this\nif you're worried about climate change\nyou know you can act like I can go\noutside and plant a tree every day but\nthat person is not living in the future\nthat person is living in the present\nthey're addressing the problem of\nclimate change even though they don't\nknow if it's going to work they don't\nknow if it's enough or the corporations\nwill screw them or whatever they're\ngoing out every day and they're planting\na tree they're doing their part there's\nimmense peace and that and there is\nimmense problem-solving about does that\nmake sense\nyeah totally what am i doing now exactly\nso that is what I'm saying is that\nirrespective of what the problem is you\nknow it's not that a particular solution\nbecause someone can be worried about\nclimate change and they can be worried\nabout corporate pollution so they can be\nworried about cruise ships or you know\ninsufficient like carbon like moving to\nrenewable energy or like you know\nhitting a tipping point of greenhouse\ngases or like you know sea levels rising\nor like all kinds of stuff you could be\nphotos or all that crap\nall that crap can be anxiety provoking\nyou can also get data that's reassuring\nand those people saying that those\npeople's anxieties will still remain do\nyou see that like it's just what Felipe\nwas saying about the external world can\ngive you reassurance and you can just\nsay screw that reassurance I'm not\ninterested so I'm asking you where does\nyour solution lie yeah incorrect dealing\nwith that fear is wrong hmm right that\nfear is this do you understand that that\nfear is a specific fear it's actually\nincorrect sorry to say so I'm being a\nlittle bit blunt with you by the way\nsure right so we're sir where's our\nsolution man what have we been focusing\non what words Oh being the present yes\nright so in the present so when you\nworry about biological determinism what\nare you worried about\nlike his determinism is about the past\npresent or future the future absolutely\nand then the other thing is I write you\nfeel like I'm incapable so I think what\nyou need to work on is AI and being in\nthe present because determinism is like\nI'm gonna be screwed down the road like\nthere's nothing I can do about it fine\nso then why don't you gonna do today\nlike forget about the future what are\nyou gonna do today one\ntry to make changes what are you going\nto change today what I think about where\nis a kink in the present how do you do\nthat I'm asking you literally what are\nyou going to do today so what part of\nthe world are you in Washington\nokay so you're in Washington so it's\nlike what like 8:30 in the morning for\nyou yep\nso what are you going to do after the\nwebinar ends okay and after meditation\nwhat are you gonna do I was gonna rather\nto-do list okay and then after that what\nare you gonna do are you gonna study or\nnot study okay so what about biological\ndeterminism what is biologic like what\nis biological determinism have to do\nabout anything that you just said well I\nthink it has everything to do with it\nwhy I mean because there are certain\nfactors in my life based on past\nexperiences that bring me to carry out\nthese actions I disagree so you're\ntelling me that you're gonna meditate\nlike yeah I don't I don't see how\nbiological determinism has anything to\ndo with meditation I don't see how\nbiological determinism has anything to\ndo with writing a task list and I don't\nthink I don't see how biological\ndeterminism has anything to do with\nactually sitting down and cracking a\ntextbook in a sense obviously it does\nbecause when you study you're gonna have\na particular IQ and depending on your IQ\nand depending on X Y Z and depending on\nABC the results\nyour study studying will be different\nand if you want to say that biological\ndeterminism has something to do with the\nresults of your actions by all means if\nI say that I'm gonna jump if I'm gonna\nstand up and jump up and down after I'm\ndone with this webinar biological\ndeterminism determines how high I jump\nbut it has nothing to do with whether I\njump or whether I don't drive does that\nmake sense yeah makes sense but I feel I\nfeel differently I understand that so\nyou need to start trying it this way and\nsee what happens because I don't think\nthat biological determinism has anything\nto do with making a to-do list that just\nfeels so far-fetched to me\nokay let's actually let's do this okay\nlet's see so we're gonna do a poll does\nmy illogical determinism have anything\nto do with making a to-do list let's\nfind out now I think the real question\nhere is how hard am I about to get\ntrolled alrighty so I I know you feel\nthat way I'm not telling you to feel a\ndifferent way what I'm telling you to do\nis collect data yeah so don't I can't\nthank you through to this solution I\nwant you to just stop and just like do\nthe things that you are saying you're\ngonna do in the moment so meditate make\na to-do list and crack open a textbook\nor whatever you have to do study take\nthose three actions and do that a couple\nmore times a couple more times a couple\nmore times and are you incapable of\nchange I have no [ __ ] idea\nmaybe you're gonna change maybe you\nwon't I don't think that change is\nactually thing change is impossible\nchange is literally a a fiction of the\nmind that is philosophy to which we can\nintellectual\nmasturbate about but I want you to do\nthese things and I think that your\nanswer still remains here in here and as\nlong as you're working over here like\nnothing is gonna happen yeah if you\nstart acting because action happens in\nthe present if you start predicting the\nconsequences of your actions that's file\nlogical determinism whether I jump or\nnot is not biological determinism how\nhigh I jump is biological determinism\nthose are two entirely different things\nbut action happens in the present\nconsequences of action happens in the\nfuture it's a really really difficult\nconcept because it's so simple in the\nmind does not like it the other thing is\nyou know you say that I am incapable so\nlike where do you get your sense of I\nand I would guess that it comes from\nyour mind instead of like other kinds of\nexperiences so there's the other thing\nis all we can think about confidence and\nstuff like that if you wake up and you\nfocus on the action day after day you\ncheck things off your to-do list\ngenerally speaking your feeling about\nyourself would change and that we sort\nof but you can't understand that until\nyou do it so focused on what you're\ngonna do after the webinar and good luck\nbuddy giving you the boot okay sure\nthanks all right one more question and I\ninvited some people why haven't they\nshown up okay we're gonna do Vlad Iman\nBonnie and Max and Raymond body were\ngiving you the boot too unless you can\nspeak now speak now or forever hold your\npeace\nyeah I mean I just read some comments\nI'm not trying to be I'm not trying to\nbe hey I mean I realize I come across as\narrogant but it's really a pressure of\ntime right so you guys watch twitch\nstreaming and like I have time with\npeople to walk them through things into\nextreme right so like here I'm a little\nbit more of a you know I'm like no\nthat's incorrect because we don't have\ntime to walk you through it right let's\njust get to the right answer so I\napologize if I'm hurting anyone's\nfeelings it's really not my intended I\nwish I had you know another hour to\nexplain I mean that's why I love that's\nwhy we started with twitch streaming so\nwe can have like an hour to take someone\nlike Juan and talk him through his ideas\nof biological determinism and the\npresent and stuff like that yeah we're\nstill streaming in a couple of hours\nokay I don't know why we can't get\nanyone else okay\nOh max has joined the room beautiful max\nRaymond has left the room\n[Music]\nwhat is the consensus behind determinism\nI have no idea yeah III we're gonna do\nthermo I'm trying to decide between\ntalking about procrastination Dharma\nmeditation or dealing with covin in\nisolation and how to talk to people who\nyou're isolated with it's tricky ok\nlet's do that let's do Paul while we're\nwaiting I invited it like a bunch of\npeople max are you dzifa dar Viktor Sam\nwe're gonna get one more question\nlet's pull you here me yep what's your\nquestion buddy uh thanks for doing this\nman I've been watching all your stuff\nfor probably a few months now and I love\nit and I thank you for the yoga this\nmorning too um so I used to be in the\nmilitary and I got out in 2017 mm-hmm\nand I'm currently a student but I feel\nlike I'm really struggling with the\nidentity portion and it's it's kind of\nlike preventing me from being present at\nall times and I also have like a lot of\nanxiety about because I'm trying to\ncareer change um I haven't I just have a\nlike a mountain of like things that are\ncausing anxiety like I'm not gonna be\nable to pass college or I'm not gonna be\nable to like right now I I'm fearing\nthat I'm gonna fail this class or like\nand the next one's gonna be like I'm a\nI'm applying to jobs and everybody's you\nknow nobody's hiring me um so am I gonna\nhave my next career so it's just like it\ncan be really hard to like be present\nwhen you when you're having all those\nthoughts sure and I want to know like\ncan I Center in on like a new identity\nfor myself because I I was from 18 to 32\nnow I was 30 years old I was always a\nmilitary guy and that was my\nwas my identity and now my my kind of\nworld is like completely dissolved kind\nof yeah so you know max I think my\nanswer may be a little bit unsatisfying\nto you but I'll do the best that I can\nin the time that we have left okay so\nthe first thing is that you know I think\nso this is why this is exactly why I\nstructured this talk on anxiety in this\nway because here's the the basic problem\nis that when you look at your anxiety\nyou say I'm worried about X Y Z I'm\nworried about ABC I'm worried about de f\nother people are worried about GHI\npeople are worried about all kinds of\nthings you're worried about are you\ngonna be able to find a job are you\ngonna be able to like land in this new\nworld with this new identity you know\nthose are all of the questions that you\nhave and the reason that I think that\ntalking about the process of how anxiety\nworks is because the content actually\ndoesn't matter because if you can learn\nhow to be in the present and you can\nfocus on on dissolving your ego which we\ncan talk more about then it doesn't\nmatter what's on the other side of the\nequation it doesn't matter what you're\nactually anxious about because you can\nliterally learn how to turn off your\nanxiety and like function on that day\nand I think that's ultimately what you\nhave to do because the other thing to\nthink about is that you don't have the\ncapability and I know this sounds\nbizarre you don't have the capability of\nactually determining whether you're\ngonna be successful in the world or not\nwhat do you think about that um yeah I\nfeel like that's probably true so tell\nme what you are what is yours to control\nand what is not yours to control my\nactions I can control my actions and\nwhat can you not control\nthe results of those actions okay so\nyou're afraid that you're not going to\nbe able to make the transition to a\ncivilian right yeah and have a second\ncareer and have a second career can you\ncontrol whether you have a second career\nor not no how does that make you feel\num well I really value the ability you\nknow I love working I loved working in\nthe military and I really I guess I\nwouldn't I feel like it would be not\nliving up to potential type of deal if I\ndidn't get another job or a career sure\nright so I want you to notice those are\nthat so there therein lies the problem\nso there's a part of you that worries\nabout living up to your potential so\nI'll tell you another thing potential is\nfalse it's a false concept of the mind\nso I want you guys to think about this\nfor a second okay\nso what exists and that's the kind of\nweird question what exists yes or I\ndon't know our present mind and body\nabsolutely perfectly correct so\npotential is not a real thing right the\nonly thing that exists is reality\nin reality is now regular right now if I\nwere to ask you like if I were to take a\nmeasurement anywhere in the world of\nanything that measurement could only be\ntaken in the present does that make\nsense the only thing that we can measure\nis this this world this moment this\nreality and and so you you're getting\ncaught up about the future and you're\nworried about not living up to your\npotential where it's like you actually\nhave no control over what your potential\nis potential is a falsity the only thing\nthat exists is what is right right so\nlike it when it\nlike become having a successful career I\nhate to break it to you buddy that is\nnot that is not your choice and that is\nnot something you can control what you\ncan control is like going back to school\nso you said you're a student right yes\nso that I think is wonderful right\nbecause you're actually huh um being\nonline though it's very hard to be have\nthat identity though it's like for me I\nhave to be around people that share the\nsame you know mind set and like goals so\nI was thinking about this yesterday's\nlike maybe I just need to force myself\nto get on campus more even though I'm\nI'm pretty much 100% oh I am now because\nof coronavirus but I'm always a hundred\npercent online but I I mean yeah I\nwouldn't right down the road from the\ncampus so so I want you to just notice\nthe tense of that statement right so you\nsay like I need to be around people who\nlike share a common goal with me yeah\nthat's not about future or present I\nmean or past it's about present that's\njust an attribute of who you are that is\npart of your identity your identity is\nnot military or student your identity is\nlike human being who enjoys sharing in\ngoals with other human beings yes India\nlike that's true yeah and so as long as\nyou're not living in alignment to that\nyou're gonna feel like you don't even\nhave an identity it's not that you don't\nhave an identity it's that you're not\naligned with who you are yes and as long\nas you're not doing something that's\naligned with who you are like if you're\nan artist and someone sticks you in an\naccounting firm you're gonna feel like\nyou don't know what your identity is\neven though you know what your identity\nis you're just not aligned with it so I\nthink you need to live a life that is\naligned with who you are and I think you\nknow more about who you are than you\nrealize and who you are is not\ndetermined by your profession it does\nit's not determined by your career\ncareer is just like something that you\nslap on your resume and it's a way that\nhopefully money gets into your bank\naccount right so like there's a\ndifference between being a graphic\ndesigner and like being someone who\ncreates things that are cool to look at\nlike one is a job and one\nlike who you are so in my case like I'm\nsomeone who talks with people and tries\nto help them that's who I am you guys\ncan call it whatever you want you I\ncould have been a priest I could have\nbeen a psychiatrist I could have been\nwhatever doesn't matter\nlike am i a psychiatrist right now not\nreally no you're talking to me yeah\nthat's who I am\nand who are you right now yeah I'm\nrealizing that I just need to align with\nwho are you right now I'm talking to you\nright now yeah that's it that's all you\nare\nYeah right so what I see is someone who\nwants to be a better person someone who\nwants to understand themselves and\nsomeone who wants to live a life that is\nlike aligned with who they are that your\nmove your striving towards growth your\nstriving towards in a bizarre way being\nwho you are which is sort of growth but\nis also not growth and that's where we\nget into like Zen paradoxes and that you\nalso have noticed a couple of things\nthat like you need to be around other\npeople and I'm sure there are all kinds\nof reasonable reasons why you're a sense\nof identities under assault because\nyou're an undergrad yes you're a 30 year\nold in undergrad yeah\nthat's not easy no you will be surprised\nby how amazing it is once you get used\nto it yes I have noticed I've become a\nbetter student in the last two years but\nyeah and then you will you'll begin to\nrealize that you have advantages over\nthese children Yeah right like you'll\nrealize they're kids like they actually\nhaven't like lived life yet and you've\nreally come of life and and try to take\nsome comfort in that but I think overall\nit still comes down to you know taking\nactions in the present it sounds like\nyou've figured out kind of who you are\nand I think your sense of identity this\nis the thing your sense of identity once\nagain is like the content side of things\nwe don't need to address that you just\nneed to start going to campus and\nhanging out with people and things like\nthat and your sense of identity will\nbecome like less important it's bizarre\nyour anxieties will just like literally\nlike start to melt away it's the\nweirdest thing in the world\nwhen I work with people in this way\nthey're like yeah it just doesn't bother\nlike people with anxiety for 15 years\nwill be like and I'll check in with them\nbecause we'll talk about spirituality\nand meditation stuff and then I'm like\nby the way how's your anxiety are you\nstill worried about X Y Z and they're\nlike it just doesn't bother me as much\nyeah it's weird\nyou were what so when you start to focus\non the ego and you start to focus on the\npresent you literally remove food and\ndrink in sustenance for your anxiety you\ndon't fix your anxiety that's what's so\n[ __ ] confusing to everyone\neveryone's like but what about my sense\nof identity what about my sense of\nbiological determinism what about this X\nY Z what about people what about my nose\nwhat about my hair what about my my\nweight what about that and I'm like yeah\nI don't really care\ndoesn't matter it's just all of that\nstuff feeds your mind feeds off of the\nthoughts of others and just think about\nthis for a second your anxiety is like\naddictive does that make any sense to\nyou yeah well as various it comes in\ncycles like you said like I I go into\ncycles and it can be very dark like it\ncan get very dark and your mind even\nthough you suffer your mind loves to be\nin that place yes it's like a kid in a\ncandy store it's like thoughts thoughts\nthoughts lot thoughts and think about\nwhat is the mind hate the mind hates no\nthoughts and this is why boredom is so\nhard for us we hate the mind the thing\nthat hates that we hate the most and the\nmind hates the most is boredom because\nboredom is a place with no stimulation\nand with no stimulation thoughts are\nhard to come up with and then the mind\nstarts to die if it has no thoughts so\nwhen you're bored your mind starts to\nwander it grasps like I want you guys to\nreally think about this for a second\nwhen you're bored your mind is like a\nstarving something and it's gasping for\nair it's thinking this thought that's\nthinking that thought anything to like\nget the chain of thoughts flow does that\nmake sense yeah and anything to like\nstart feeding itself because once it\ngets interested in something then you\ncan think think think think think and\nyou're no longer bored and then the mind\nis at ease because it's like oh thank\ngod we're thinking again\nso is you step away from the process of\nthinking it can be kind of difficult but\nover time your anxiety won't have food\nand water and it'll start to wither away\nand then eventually it'll die and then\nas you think anxious thoughts as you\nengage in the world that's gonna add\nfood and water so this is why I like\nconquering anxiety takes like really\nlike months or even years and then yeah\nso good luck man thank you thanks for\nyou guys we're gonna have to stop\nbecause we're actually like about 45\nminutes overtime and I'll do a better\njob of time management and meditation\nnext time okay\ngood luck Thanks"
