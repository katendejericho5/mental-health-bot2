    "transcript": "all righty\nlet's get started so okay oh my goodness\nalright let's get started let me see if\nthere's some I need to record so welcome\nguys to the first official healthy gamer\nwebinar so we're gonna be so this\nwebinar is gonna be a little bit about\nwhat I call the science of the self so\nwhat I mean by that is that we don't\nusually learn how we work right so there\nare a lot of like principles about how\nhuman beings function whether it be\nneuroscience or psychology or yoga or\nmeditation like what we learned from\nBuddhism or things like that and so\nwe're kind of going through life without\nunderstanding like the mechanics or how\nto use the controller or like the mouse\nand keyboard for like who we are\nalright so where did desires come from\nwhere does ego come from how does\nbehavior work how does motivation work\nlike no one ever teaches us these things\nhow do you learn how to concentrate how\ndo you focus your mind on one thing had\nlike you know what is the nature of\nprocrastination so this webinar is\nactually designed to offer you guys sort\nof a comprehensive answer to a lot of\nthose questions and the structure of the\nwebinar is going to be as follows so\nevery day we're gonna do yoga for about\n10 minutes so I'm about to shift my\ncamera and we're gonna do something\ncalled Surya Namaskar the next and then\neach day we're gonna have a 30 to 40\nminute lecture and today's lecture is\ngoing to be about motivation and how\nmotivation works where it comes from\nwhat's the neuroscience of motivation\nhow to create motivation in your life\nwhich is actually incorrect it's really\nabout unlocking or redirecting\nmotivation and then we're gonna have\nabout 10 to 15 minutes for Q&A and we're\ngonna end with meditation so my goal\nhere is to give you guys kind of a\nchance to start your day off right\nduring kovat and because everyone's\ngonna be at home and stuff like that so\nhow can we sort of behaviorally anchor\nyou to doing something like properly on\na daily basis how\nyou learn something how can we make it\nconcrete how can we make it\ncomprehensive so I encourage all of you\nguys to not just watch but to\nparticipate in you know the yoga that\nwe're about to do so the first thing\nthat we're going to do is something\ncalled Surya namaskara and Surya\nnamaskara is the Sanskrit phrase for Sun\nSalutation so it's a sequence of yoga\nposes that is designed to kind of start\nyour day off so you're supposed to do it\nlike in the morning like facing the\nsunrise ideally and what I like about\nthe Surya Namaskar is that it's kind of\nlike a complete set of yoga poses that\nyou can kind of stick with so when I\nfirst started learning yoga back in 2003\nyou know Surya Namaskar actually even\nbefore 2003 like when I was a kid and I\nwould go to like Sunday school like\nSurya Namaskar were the poses that they\ntaught us at the age of 10 and then I\nwent to India and you know started\nlearning I mean relearn Surya Musco and\nthen learned all this advanced yoga and\nbasically now my main yoga practice is\nlike back to pseudonymous car because\nit's kind of a complete sort of yoga\npractice and so what so want one or two\npreparatory things about the suit in a\nmosque are so the first is that the goal\nof yoga is not to become a human pretzel\nso the goal of yoga is not to stretch as\nmuch as possible or increase your\nflexibility Yoga is actually a\npreparatory practice or Ahsan which are\nyoga postures or preparatory practices\nfor meditation so the goal of yoga is\nactually to prepare your mind for\nmeditation or even enter a premeditative\nstate so what do I mean by that so what\nthat means is that when you guys are\ndoing this practice what I want you to\nnotice is what your mind is doing so the\ngoal of these postures is to stress you\nout enough so that your your mind cannot\nwander so the reason that the practices\nare difficult is because your your brain\nis going to be your somatosensory cortex\nwhich is the part of your brain that you\nknow gives you information about your\nbody is going to be sending you so many\nsignals that you're not going to be\nable to have your mind wander right so\nif we think about when does the mind\nwander the mind wanders when we are\nphysically relaxed so if you're\nphysically stressed out it's actually\nvery hard for the mind to wander and if\nyou have a physical demand then the mind\nis going to focus on that thing so the\ngoal of yoga practice I want you guys to\nfind the point in the yoga practice so\nif I tell you know for example bend down\nand touch your toes the goal is not to\nactually touch your toes the goal is to\ngo down as far as you can to the point\nthat your mind is focused on touching\nyour toes okay yeah I know you guys are\nso some of y'all are in the EU and\nthings like that so you know hopefully\nif y'all are here live that's fantastic\nso do yoga in the middle of the day and\nyeah so we're gonna go ahead and start\n[Music]\n[Music]\nwe're gonna do three so we're gonna\nstart so start by putting your hands\nthis guys can still hear me okay so\nstart by putting your hands so put your\nfeet together and stand up straight and\nyour angles should be touching so you\ndon't want your feet spread apart you\nwant two right next to each other\nand then place your hands in front of\nyou like this close your eyes and notice\nthat when you close your eyes you be can\nbegin to be unstable that's the first\nstep right if you open your eyes\nstability returns and then go ahead and\nclose your eyes again\nand instability returns\nso just feel that instability focus on\nstabilization and notice that your mind\nfocuses as soon as the instability\nreturns open your eyes\nis instability goes away the mind\nbecomes free once again and then go\nahead and close your eyes feel that\ninstability and now we'll begin the\npractice of subió Namaskar\nso the first step is to raise your hands\nhands above your head you can open your\neyes now and go ahead and let your\nbiceps touch your ears so the goal here\nis to keep your biceps touching your\nears and that's really the posture that\nyou want and just go ahead and feel this\nfor a second feel the stretch in your\nback the pull excellent go ahead and\nfeel that as you hold it you may begin\nto quaint a little bit that's perfectly\nokay and now we're going to go down to\nstep two which is to touch your toes now\nin this posture we're gonna have to be\nvery careful because the goal actually\nis not to touch your toes the goal is to\nhang your head and hang your body down\nand I want you guys to notice that\nthere's tightness maybe in the back of\nyour legs or in your back or even in\nyour neck and now what I want you to do\nis let gravity pull you forward let\ngravity pull you forward keep your legs\nstraight let your head hang and we're\njust gonna hang like this for a second\nyou notice all the sensations that arise\nin your body your body's like hey man\nwhat are we doing why are we doing this\nthen notice go ahead and come up a\nlittle bit\nand then notice how it's easier and as\nyou go down let your your body hang let\nyour head hang hold that for a second\nand now we're gonna do step three so\nwhat I want you guys to do is put your\npalms face down right next to your feet\nso you're kind of squatting right so\nyou're pop the palms of your hands or\nface like\ntouching the ground just like your feet\nyou may feel a little bit of a stretch\nand I want you to take your right leg\nand put it back behind you like this so\nas you look down you should be able to\nsee actually [ __ ] so as you look down I\nsee that as you look down you should be\nable to see you know your palms and your\nyour left foot in a straight line your\nknee is gonna kind of be in your next to\nyour shoulder and then you got this this\nstretch in the back and notice that you\ncan maybe move your leg up or down a\nlittle bit and it kind of enhances the\nstretch you can kind of go down and lean\ninto it right and then you can kind of\ngo up and just hold that for a second\nnow put the other leg back okay and now\nwe're gonna kind of enter push-up\nposition and hold this for a moment\nnotice it and then we're gonna lay down\non the floor and this part is gonna be a\nlittle bit weird so what I want you guys\nto do is I want your toes on the floor\nknees on the floor hip like butt in the\nair so you're a hips up it's not\ntouching the floor chest touching the\nfloor you don't want your belly touching\nthe floor and the last thing is for that\nso you're kind of touching the floor on\nfour points forehead chest knees and\ntoes and that's going to create like\nnotice what happens if you just like lay\nyour head like this you're relaxed as\nyou touch your forehead to the floor\nnotice what happens to the back of your\nneck next what we're going to do is when\nI move our hips to the floor and we're\ngonna push up so I'm going to show you\nguys this way okay so we're not going to\ndo it and actually push up but your hips\nstay on the floor and you just want to\nbend your torso upward so your knees\nyour elbow should be raised\nI want your shoulders rolled out so\ndon't go like this don't go like\nshoulders out elbows out is fine and\nfeel that stretching your back feel that\nstretch and now what we're gonna do is\npush up and then butts in the air and I\nwant you guys to form a triangle form a\ntriangle with your kind of with your\nbody so palms face down once again your\nhead should be kind of aligned with your\nbiceps or even maintained and then the\nlast thing that I want to do if you guys\nreally want to feel a nice stretch put\nyour heels to the ground so try to keep\nyour toes on the ground and try to\nflatten your feet and notice what\nhappens when you try to flatten your\nfeet you'll feel fuel a beautiful\nstretch in your cap and just focus on\nthat sensation and now what we're going\nto do is return back to a previous post\nso now I want you to take your right leg\nand put it forward okay so now that\nthese that your two hands and the right\nleg are kind of in a line and feel that\nstretch in your hips and then just kind\nof feel that for a second and now back\nup to touching your toes let your head\nhang and then up and then back to the\nstart\nokay we're going to do one more round so\ngo ahead and relax for a second notice\nwhat your body is doing like your body's\nkind of like waking up right it's kind\nof feeling a little bit more take a deep\nbreath now we're gonna do one more round\nwe're gonna do this one quicker okay\npalms in front of you feet together and\nthen up biceps to the ears and then down\ntouching your toes remember keep your\nlegs straight back bent\nlet gravity pull you down\nnotice the stretch in your legs as\ngravity pulls you down and then right\nleg back and then look up so right leg\nback left foot and two hands in the line\nand then other leg back so we're going\nto kind of be in push-up position feel\nthat for a moment go down so toes knees\nchest and forehead\nfeel that stretch in your neck and now\npush up hips to the ground back bent\nshoulders out knees I mean elbows bent\nfeel that stretch and then they'll look\nup ooh my favorite awesomes it's called\nBruijn awesome awesome so feel that - I\nguess part of my thoughts on mountain\npose or a downward facing dog I think is\nwhat people call it nowadays and so\nremember put your make a triangle with\nyour butt in the air and then put your\nyour heels into the ground feel that\nstretch in your calf now right leg\nforward okay look up feel that stretch\nyeah it's good and then other leg\nforward\nlet yourself move down let gravity do\nthe work for you don't push it\nhands up\nbiceps to the elbow and then back to\nCenter\nokay what do you guys you guys want to\ndo one more let's check in I have lied\nokay let's do okay\nwell we'll start with two so we'll do\nthree tomorrow okay so let's switch\ngears okay how was that okay too fast\nall right one more okay we're gonna just\nstart with we're gonna start with two\nokay so I want you guys so some people\nmay have difficulty with that because\nit's like you know it's kind of new for\nyour body so we're gonna start with two\ndon't worry guys well we'll work our\nways up okay well patience okay lesson\nnumber one is patience patience so let's\ngive everyone I know you guys wanted you\ncould hey you know this is kind of\ninteresting did you guys know that you\ncan do this on your own that you don't\nneed dr. kay to teach you fascinating so\nif you guys want to do one more go for\nit\nor do it on your own time or you can\nstart with three in the morning we're\ngonna do three tomorrow okay so we're\ngonna over time gradually build up our\nhave people are sweating so people are\nhaving a different kind of response to\nthis which is perfectly okay but what I\nreally want to do is get to I want to be\na little bit mindful of our time so\nwe're gonna get to the lecture cuz\nthat's good - okay all right oh no\ndevices connected there we go okay so\nyou can have a little bit of water and\njust notice how you feel for a second\nokay all right so next what we're going\nto do is we're going to start our\nlecture so we're going to start talking\nabout motivation\nokay all right so let me just get set up\nI feel like my arms are too short oh\nyeah you will discover all kinds of\nthings about your arms and body when you\ndo yoga okay so let's just start this\ntesting testing testing okay all right\nso let's go ahead and switch so today\n[Music]\nwe're gonna talk about motivation so\nlet's start with this this over here\nokay so how are we gonna understand\nmotivation okay so the first thing that\nI want to share with you guys is that\nwe're going to talk about motivation\nokay so the first thing is we're going\nto talk a little bit about our approach\nand how this seminar is structured so\nthe first thing is that I want us to\ndraw on a couple of sources of\ninformation the first is going to be\nobservation so rather than rely on\nscience or what we know or what we've\nread we're actually going to focus on\nobservation so we're gonna develop\nhypotheses and we're gonna make\nobservations about ourself and see if we\ncan uncover things about motivation to\nbetter understand how it works the\nsecond source of knowledge that we're\ngoing to rely on is actually like the\nyogic or meditative tradition so this is\nkind of where I learned a lot of this\nstuff and what I mean by that is that\nyou know Yogi's like basically we're\nexperts at observing the self and\nthrough observing the self they made\ncertain observations or conclusions and\nthat's going to be a lot of what we draw\non the third thing that we're gonna draw\non is neuroscience and I know I just\nsaid we're not gonna rely on science but\nwhat I mean by that is that I don't want\nyou guys when when I'm asking you a\nquestion\nI don't want your answer to be what\nyou've read I want it to be what you've\nexperienced because here's the thing out\nlike reading\nsomething right so you can read a book\nthat explains to you how alcoholism\nworks in the brain and that doesn't\nnecessarily change your ability to\ncontrol whether you have a drink or not\nso what's more important than what\nexperts say is what you discover about\nyourself okay and this is going to be\ntrue this segment is gonna be true for\nbasically every part of the webinar that\nwe do that the most important thing is\nwhat do you observe or what do you\nexperience and if it's contrary to what\nthe most brilliant neuroscientist says\nthat's fine forget about the\nneuroscience because you've got to deal\nwith you okay so that's just kind of a\nquick kind of background about how this\nis structured okay so now our discussion\non motivation is going to have four\nsegments the first segment is do we\nreally lack motivation so we're gonna\nspend a few minutes talking about you\nknow what's the actual problem like\nwhat's going on here like how like what\nis motivation do we really lack it how\ndo we determine that we lack it or not\nand the second thing that we're gonna\nask is how does motivation work so once\nwe define our problems so this is\ndefining our problem okay this is going\nto be like understanding or problem the\nnext thing is what does this mean for us\nright so this is applying you know our\nunderstanding of things to us and the\nfourth thing is what do we do about it\nright so this is kind of actions or\nmoving forward and this is what everyone\neveryone wants number four but we're\ngonna take our time in getting there\nokay because I think jumping straight to\nsolution actually isn't as important as\nyou know really understanding what the\nproblem is so let's start with number\none okay so do you lack motivation so\nlet's just think a little bit about\nmotivation so people tend to say that\nokay like especially in kind of Gen Z\nMillennials right we kind of say oh I\nlack motivation I don't have any\nmotivation I'm lazy I'm undisciplined\nwhatever so let's just think about that\nfor a second so the first thing is that\nthis is a very very common problem right\nso lacking motivation is common that's\nnumber one so what is that what's the\nsignificance of that so the first thing\nthat I want you guys to understand so\nI'm a physician right so I think about\nthings kind of from a medical standpoint\nand what I want to share with you guys\nis that pathology is rare what do I mean\nby that if we look at actual diseases or\nthings that are broken within people\nthose tend to be rare for example like\ncancer like not everyone doesn't have\ncancer like cancer is a rare rare thing\nand and if you're unlucky it kind of\nhappens to you or someone that you love\nbut generally speaking the body works\nthe way it's supposed to so if there's a\ncommon problem I don't actually think of\nit as a problem if an entire generation\nof people are facing a common shared\nproblem which is that you know we all\nlack motivation it's not that we lack\nmotivation it's not actually a problem\nit's actually the way that we're wired\nright does that make sense\nlike if everyone shares a particular\nthing like everyone can use their left\nand right hand or presumably most people\ncan use their left or right hand and if\neveryone can do it earth it's a common\nissue with most people then that's sort\nof how we're designed so the first thing\nto understand is that\nokay how do I there we go okay so the\nfirst thing to uncannily that\nfascinating no problem okay so the first\nthing no okay\nso pathology is rare we all we all lack\nmotivation okay so then what this means\nis that actually our brain makes us\nunmotivated and I'm sorry guys I'm a\ndoctor which means I have terrible\nhandwriting right so even though we\nwe're using electronic medical records\nwe still have terrible handwriting and\nso so our brain actually makes us\nunmotivated and that this isn't actually\nthis is not broken I want you guys to\nreally understand this that your lack of\nmotivation is not a problem it's\nactually how your brain is wired and so\nthe first thing that this kind of clues\nus into is if everyone's doing it and it\nseems to be like really really common\nthen like that's what our brain is\ndesigned to do it's how our brain is\nsupposed to be and so like this this I\nthink is really important because the\nbasic reason that I think so many people\nstruggle to fix their motivation is that\nthey're defining the problem incorrectly\nwe're trying to fix something that\nfundamentally is not broken where our\nbrain is designed a particular way and\nso you're trying to redesign the\nfunction of your brain which is like not\npossible so instead what you should do\nis like understand how your brain works\nand then create a life that sort of uses\nyour brain for you instead of trying to\nreprogram your brain okay so what do we\nkind of do with this okay this second\nthing I'm good\n[Music]\nokay there we go\nso the second thing is do you really\nMack lack motivation so let's just think\nabout this for a second are you you\nmotivated so what people usually say is\nthat people usually say like no I'm not\nmotivated and let's think about this for\na second\nso when you wake up every day and you\nkind of feel bad about yourself and\nlet's say I'm just assuming for a moment\nthat you spend your whole day kind of on\nsocial media reddit Instagram YouTube\ngaming etc like you wake up every day\nand you feel terrible about yourself so\nyou have all of this like shame and and\nlike all these like you know negative\nfeelings which we hate having and\ndespite having all those negative\nfeelings and suffering we continue to do\nthe same thing so I want you guys to\nthink a little bit about suffering and\nhow suffering motivates us right and if\nwe think about it usually like we try we\ntry very hard to avoid suffering like if\nI have you know if I go to school and I\nget bullied and people beat me up\neveryday like it's really hard for me to\ngo to school and so even if we think\nabout it\ndespite daily suffering we continue in\nour patterns in our patterns so what\nthat means\nso usually suffering causes us to change\nour behavior but what this means is our\nsuffering is actually less than our\nmotivation just think about that for a\nsecond right in order for you to\ncontinue doing something that causes you\nso much pain and suffering you actually\nhave to be highly highly motivated to do\nit so when people tell me oh I have no\nmotivation in life all I want to do is\nplay video games what I really interpret\nis I have a high high high amount of\nmotivation to play video games all the\ntime it's not that you lack motivation\nit's that your motivation\nis pointed in the wrong direction so\njust think about this for a second how\nhard is it for you to stop playing video\ngames it can be really really hard and\nif it's it's really really hard that\nmeans you're like highly highly\nmotivated to play video games\nso let's first understand that the\nproblem isn't that we lack motivation\nthe problem is that our motivation is\npointed in the wrong direction and\nfurthermore we don't really think we\ndon't really think about how complicated\ntasks are and we actually have a lot of\ndifferent kinds of motivation but this\nis the main thing to understand so now\nif we kind of accept this premise and if\nyou guys you know I encourage you to\nobserve yourself and ask yourself do you\ncontinue doing a behavior despite it\ncausing you suffering and if the answer\nis yes that means your motivation\ncircuitry is actually really hardcore\ngeared towards that behavior and so then\nthe question becomes like okay so then\nthen you know why do people struggle to\nfix it and I think the reason people\nstruggle to fix it is because they\nconceived of it is a lack of something\nwhereas like it's not that it's a lack\nof something it's just that that thing\nis there and and it's pointed in the\nwrong direction so what people try to do\nis create motivation instead of shifting\nmotivation and I don't know if you guys\nrealize this but like creating something\nthat already exists is like really\nreally hard but if the problem is not is\nnot that you lack it the problem is that\nlike it's an issue of direction not an\nissue of like absence or presence and\nthis is the first fundamental mistake\nthat people make right as they try to\nfix something that isn't broken\nright your effort is completely wasted\nbecause actually your motivation\ncircuitry is intact and you're highly\nhighly motivated you're just motivated\ntowards the wrong thing so instead of\nmaking motivation what you really need\nto do is like learn how to turn the\nsteering wheel and then you're going to\nbe in a far better place so my answer to\nthis question is do you lack motivation\nmy answer is no I actually think that\nmost people in our generation are highly\nhighly motivated did they're just highly\nmotivated in a direction they don't want\nto be if you think about people who like\nplay tons of video\nlike grind stuff right like they're\ndedicated to playing 10 hours 12 hours\n18 hours a day day after day after day\nweek after week after week you know\npeople who are sort of addicted to\nsocial media and are dedicated to making\nposts and crafting their posts and\ngetting likes and getting follows\nthey're like so dedicated to it they're\nhighly highly motivated and so you know\nthat the answer is do you lack\nmotivation no so let's start there so on\nto number two\nokay how does motivation work okay so\nthe first thing is that motivation isn't\nbinary and what I mean by that is if you\nthink about motivation we talk about\nmotivation in a way that is like I lack\nmotivation or I have motivation but\nthat's not actually how motivation works\nit's not binary right if you think about\nyour day like let's say so I have a I\nhave a glass of water right so I have a\nglass of water here and if I have a\nglass of water then you know my\nmotivation to drink it is like one type\nof motivation my motivation to make\nmoney is separate my motivation to work\nout a separate my motivation to play\nvideo games is separate motivation is\nnot one thing there are a thousand\ndifferent things that calculations that\nour brain is brain is performing all the\ntime and depending on those calculations\nwe actually engage in the action or we\ndon't engage in the action so that mean\nis that we have thousands of motivation\ncalculations and why is this an\nimportant point so I believe that in\norder to move forward in life you need\nto understand and define your problem\nand this is also something that comes\nfrom medicine which is that if you want\nto appropriately treat a disease you\nhave to appropriately diagnose a disease\nso I think a big problem that people\nface is of inappropriate diagnosis so\nthey say I lack motivation but that's\nnot really\nactionable like you can't flip a switch\nin your brain to create more motivation\nand that's why they fundamentally fail\nbecause they're trying to solve a\nproblem that doesn't exist so of course\nthat's going to lead to failure they're\ndeveloping treatments with an improper\ndiagnosis so what we have to understand\nis that motivation is actually a\nthousand different calculations kind of\nconstantly going on and so let me just\nkind of put that down so motivation\nreally is an ongoing calculation about\nlikelihood of success this is what\nmotivation is and now we're gonna switch\ngears for a second okay so application\nwindow interesting let's do this then\nokay so now we're gonna do a little bit\nof we're gonna take a look at\nneuroscience okay all right great okay\nso I want to we're gonna see a little\nbit about what what this means for us\nand we're gonna look a little bit at\nscience so this is a paper by actually a\ngood friend of mine dr. Daoud who we\ntrained together and so this is a paper\nabout schizophrenia and I think it's\nbizarre but one of the best ways to\nlearn about motivation is through\nstudying schizophrenia and why is that\nso if we want to understand how\nsomething works one of the best ways to\nunderstand the function of something is\nto look at cases where it's broken right\nso if we want to like understand okay\nhow does an engine work if we remove one\npiece of the engine and the engine no\nlonger turns on we can study the engine\nand sort of figure out okay what is the\nrole of that one piece does that make\nsense\nwe want to understand something looking\nat a broken version actually give us a\nlot of insight into what you know what\nis broken and what influence that part\nhas and so why do we look at\nschizophrenia because in schizophrenia\npeople have two major things going on\none is something that we call positive\nsymptoms and this is usually what the\nmedia portrays which is that people will\nsometimes become paranoid or hallucinate\nor have delusions and we actually have\ndecent medications for that the real\nproblem in schizophrenia is actually\nsomething that's better called negative\nsymptoms which are over time people with\nschizophrenia start to become like\nreally really a motivated so when you\nkind of think about the quintessential\ncrazy homeless person I'm not trying to\nbe judgmental or anything but a lot of\ntimes people with schizophrenia end up\nin like bad social situations because\ntheir motivational drives aren't\nfunctioning properly and so what we know\nfrom schizophrenia is that that\nbasically like some of their\nmotivational circuitry doesn't work\nproperly so let's just define you know\nas we look at the paper\nso what we see from negative symptoms is\naspects of schizophrenia include\nconstructs such as a sociality which\nthat what that means is people like are\nnot social a volition a reduction in the\nmotivation to initiate or persist in\ngoal directed behavior this is exactly\nwhat we're talking about and anhedonia\nreduction in the ability to experience\npleasure\nso a volition is something that we see a\nlot in schizophrenia and I think is a\nlot you also see it in our generation so\nlet's try to understand how evolution\nworks and so what we're gonna do in this\npaper is we're really gonna look at this\nfigure okay and the first thing that I\nwant you guys to notice is that the\nbehavioral response is over here and you\nknow when we think about motivation we\nthink about okay no motivation means\nkind of so the first thing is that no\none really appreciates that there's a\nlot of complicated stuff that goes into\na behavioral response that's the first\nissue right so you guys say oh I'm not\nmotivated I need motivation it's not\nlike a leads to be\nthere's actually a lot of different\nthings that happen in the brain that\nlead to a behavioral response and create\nmotivation so what we're gonna focus on\ntoday so I can run through these so the\nfirst thing is hedonics so what that\nmeans is how likeable the behavior is so\nhow pleasurable the behavior is the\nsecond thing that kind of goes into this\ninput is how much you want it so I want\nyou guys to understand this for a second\nwanting and liking or two different\nthings\nokay we oftentimes conflate the two but\nthere are actually completely different\ncircuits in the brain your desires and\npleasure are actually different things\neven though they're they're tightly\nrelated reinforcement through\nreinforcement learning through reward is\ndopaminergic and this is wanting and\nactually enjoying something is different\nanyway we're not gonna go too much into\nthat what I really want to focus on is\nthis stuff so the first thing is that\nour brain is constantly performing a\ncost-benefit analysis and what that\nmeans is that we're like int we're\ntaking in new information we're\ncomputing some kind of like we're\nperforming a computation and then based\non like new information in a computation\nthat we're doing we construct a plan and\nthen it leads to a behavioral response\nokay so what does that mean so we're\ngonna kind of go back to all right so my\npoint and kind of diving into that\nneuroscience for a second is simply that\nlet's hold on okay my screen there just\ngot restart my screen mirroring there we\ngo\n[Music]\nso now going back to this okay so what\ndoes this mean for us so the main thing\nto understand is that motivation is not\nbinary and that actually there's a\nconstant calculation that's going in our\nin our brain about what we should do and\nwhat we should not do so if I think\nabout like drinking a glass of water you\nknow right now I don't feel like\ndrinking the glass of water and my brain\nis performing a calculation as my sodium\nlevel rises in my bloodstream it sends\nsignals to my brain that make me crave\nwater and get thirsty and whether I\nrespond to those signals or not\ndepends on all kinds of things like the\navailability of water so if water is\nclose by and I'm not very thirsty I'm\nlikely to drink it but if water is not\nclose by then the thirst actually has to\nincrease to change my behavior to get me\nto go drink water you guys got that so\nlike there are all kinds of like\nprocesses that are going on about\navailability of water what's my thirst\nlevel what am i doing right now am I\ngoing to be able to drink water later\nshould I drink water now there are all\nkinds of things that kind of even go\ninto something as simple as drinking\nwater and so what does that mean for us\nlike why do we care about understanding\nmotivation that way and so I'll kind of\ngive you guys an example so like I think\nunderstanding the complexity of\nmotivation helps us understand the\ndifferent components we can act on to\nincrease motivation if we think about it\nas 100% or 0% then it's like hard to act\nright but if we think about motivation\nis 90% and there's like kind of a 60%\n30% then like how do we navigate between\nthese how does our brain sort of decide\nlike if you know how do we move from 30\nto 60 to 90 and as we understand more\nvariables we can actually start to make\nchanges in our life to move in this\ndirection so let me give you guys kind\nof an example of this process and how\nunderstanding complexity of something\nhow\nsus do a better job ah so sometimes\npeople come to me and they say I want to\nbe healthy and then what's my answer\nthat do I say okay here's how you be\nhealthy like okay let me just give you\nhealth and people walk around they say\noh I want to be healthy I want to be\nhealthy I want to be healthy I want to\nbe healthy I'm not healthy I'm not\nhealthy I'm not healthy I'm not healthy\nand so how do you become healthy is\nhealthy something you can become like\nyou just become healthy no but that's\nthe way that we talk about motivation we\nsay oh I want to be motivated I lack\nmotivation I have a motivation other\npeople have motivation I don't have\nmotivation I need motivation I need\nmotivation and people can walk around\nand they say oh I want to be healthy I'm\nnot healthy other people are healthy I\nwish I was like them if I was luckier in\nlife I would have been born healthy just\nlike they're born healthy but instead\nI'm lazy and they got the they got dealt\na good hand in life where their laziness\nlevel is low and my laziness level is\nhigh and so I don't have motivation I\nwish I could be motivated right so this\nis where I think like if we think about\nthis like it's absurd like you don't\nbecome healthy well okay\nyou don't really become healthy what you\ndo is you understand that health so\nhealth is an emergent property based on\nmultiple variables and now what I want\nyou I want you guys to just think about\nthat like that makes sense right\nhealth is a function of whether you\nexercise what you eat whether you see a\ntherapist whether you meditate whether\nyou spend out time outdoors whether you\nsocialize health is a really really\ncomplicated process and if someone comes\nto me and says I want to be healthy can\nyou give me a pill to make me healthy or\nwhat is the strategy to uncover health\nmy answer is there isn't one there are\nactually a dozen strategies and the more\nyou understand the components of health\nthe easier it is to be healthy so what\nwe're gonna do is replace this word with\nmotivation right is an emergent property\nthat's based on multiple variables is an\nongoing calculation about the likelihood\nof success and this calculation has many\nvariables okay so then the question\nbecomes part three what does this mean\nfor us okay so what we do is we do a\nlikelihood of success calculation okay\nso I want you guys to think about this\nfor a second our brains evolved not in\nour current society but in a society\nwhere we were like hunter-gatherers\ncavemen whatever so I want you to\nimagine that there was there's a there's\na caveman with a spear right and the\ncaveman wants to go hunting and he wants\nto go look for food so he like leaves\nhis hot in the morning and then he looks\nat different trails he sees lots of\ndifferent trails right how does he\ndetermine which trail to go down so he\nlooks at five trails and he's like oh I\ndon't really know like what to do but\nthen he sees let's say that he sees\ntracks over here so see as he sees\ntracks over here what does that do to\nhis likelihood of success calculation\nthat he's gonna find food in this\ndirection is that is the likelihood of\nsuccess calculation increases the\nprobability it motivates him to move in\nthis direction you guys see that like\nsuddenly this bit of data actually\nchanges his motivation very quickly it's\nkind of simple right\nand then let's\nlike so this is how he this is where\nmotivation comes from so we do as a\nlikelihood of success calculation and\nthen let's say that like over here he\nsees actually like you know a deer okay\nso if he sees a deer over here then what\ndoes that do to his success calculation\nit increases his success count equation\na lot he's like oh there's actually food\nthere so suddenly his motivation is\ngoing in this direction now he's going\nthere even more than over here so if we\nthink about this his internal motivation\nis actually influenced very clearly by\nhis probability of success calculation\nso let's think a little bit about that\nwhat has to do so what goes into our\nprobability of success calculation so I\nhave a problem okay and I lack\nmotivation so let's say that I don't\nhave a job so what do we think about our\nprobability of success so like find a\njob what's the probability of success\nfor finding a job the F knows you can't\nassign a number to that and if you can't\nassign a number to that you're gonna\nstay in the middle just think about this\nfor a second if our brain has no idea\nhow to assign up a likelihood of success\nit's not gonna act right so let's say\nokay vs. play a game which makes us feel\nbetter\nwhat's the likelihood of success here\n100% so think about this look at it\nright how do you find a job like I don't\nI don't even know what does that even\nmean so when our brain when you wake up\nin the morning and you think about okay\nI need to find a job and then your brain\nis like I don't know how to gauge\nwhether that's gonna work or not right\nit's kind of like waking up in the\nand saying I want to I want to find a\npound of gold and your brain is gonna be\nlike I don't know how to do that\nlike what's the likelihood of success of\nfinding a pound of gold and then your\nbrain is also like okay well we're\nfeeling bad so that's almost like a need\nthat it wants to fix like hunger or\nthirst\nso as negative emotions arise within you\nyour brain is like hmmm what can we do\nabout these negative emotions because\nI'm trying to protect you buddy and I\nknow that you're suffering right now why\ndon't we just go play a game and so the\nproblem is that you the the your brain\nis actually working perfectly fine it's\njust it's doing a good job at what it\nknows how to do and as long as you view\nyour problems as something or your goals\nas something that like don't have clear\nlikelihoods of success then you're not\ngonna do them and so let's think about\nthis for a second all right so so a lot\nof people nowadays would rather play\ngames with a 0% chance of finding a job\n[Music]\nrather than apply for a job with a 10%\nchance of success just think about that\nfor a second you guys would rather do\nsomething that definitely does not help\nyou move forward in life versus\nsomething that may not help you move\nforward in life and how on earth does\nthis work right why on earth would your\nbrain pick a 0% chance over a 10% chance\nand the reason is because this is\nactually not a 0% chance this is a\nhundred percent chance of feeling better\nso it's not that you lack motivation\nit's simply that you know your brain is\ndoing like a different kind of\ncalculation and like this is why because\nlike what this is why you guys do this\nright so if you if you think about this\nyou know this is an observation this\nwhat I was saying about observation so\nif we actually look at ourselves we find\nthis to be true and if this is true\nrather than assuming that we're broken\nwhat we should do who is take that\nobservation and try to use it is like\nscientific data and then develop an\nexplanatory hypothesis that accounts for\nthis observation the observations that\nyou make about yourself are not signs\nthat you're broken they're clues as to\nhow you work and that's a really really\nimportant principle that I believe a\nhundred percent in so don't assume\nyourself to be broken assume that\neverything about you is data about how\nyou work and then start to construct a\nstrategy about how to deal with with\nthose truths okay so the second thing is\nthat so if we think about likelihood of\nsuccess of success what else kind of\ngoes into this so the next big thing\nthat goes into it is confidence right so\nlike if we think about you know our\nhunter again and let's say that there's\na deer over here and then there's a like\nyak over here okay\nso whether he goes for the deer or he\ngoes for the Yak depends on his\nconfidence in being able to catch either\none right and be able to hunt it down so\nif we think about a likelihood of\nsuccess calculation your fundamental\nconfidence for success leads to the\nlikelihood of success so what that means\nis that if your confidence is low that\nleads to a low likelihood of success and\nthat's like mathematical and if we have\na low likelihood of success that in turn\nleads to low motivation or lack of\nbehavior right and I don't know how else\nto put this but why don't you guys wake\nup every day and and jump up into the\nair and try to fly because wouldn't it\nbe awesome to be to be able to fly like\nit would be cool if you could fly like\nimagine like how fun that would be\nbut why don't you\nwake up everyday and jump up and try to\nfly like why don't you guys do that\nbecause the likelihood of success is\nclose to zero so even though you want to\nbe able to fly you're not going to spend\ntime trying to fly if the likelihood of\nsuccess is zero so likelihood of success\nleads to motivation or lack of Beor or\nbehavior and if we think about what\nleads to likelihood of success its\nconfidence in your ability okay\nso what is this so what should you do\nall this stuff is fine\nwhat now right what should you do so the\nfirst thing to understand well so let's\nlike look at our equation so confidence\n[Music]\nleads to likelihood of success which in\nturn leads to motivation so now the\nquestion is if we want to increase this\nquantity how can we act on these two\nquantities so the first is that we can\nchange our task from find a job\nlikelihood of success 0% or a lecture\nthat's not say zero let's be a little\nbit more fair okay let's say one percent\nokay to apply for a job\nah now what happens so when if we set\nour target is applying for our job our\nbrain is like oh like apply for job I\ncan do that let's say 30 percent let's\nremember we're us right so even though\nit's perfectly in our control our brain\nis like oh like applying for a job like\nI understand what that means okay\nlet's even change it a little bit\nfurther fill out a job application\nno that's like 50% and then download a\njob application\nthat's pretty easy that's like 80%\ndownloading job application is easy you\nguys see this this is the trend so you\nhave to program your task so that your\nbrain is like oh actually I can do that\nso if we go back to our hunter if we\ntell our hunter go find go find food in\nthe mount like in the ten-mile radius\nthe hunter doesn't know where to start\nyou guys get that the more roads they\nhave the bigger the task is the more\nparalyzed the hunter is so if the hunter\ngets some kind of data that focuses his\nattention his ability to act actually\nincreases so we need to do the same\nthing over here we need to change our\ntasked to increase the likelihood of\nsuccess and as you increase the\nlikelihood of success you're more able\nto act so next question is what about\nconfidence so we're gonna do an entire\nvideo on confidence but let's just think\na little bit about this so what leads to\nconfidence so the first thing I mean you\nknow how do you get confidence so the\nfirst thing is that I'm going to kind of\njust toss out a couple of things the\nfirst thing is that dealing with\nnegative emotion so one of the things\nthat keeps us from being confident is\nthat we're sitting on these piles\ngenerally speaking of like negative\nemotion and if you feel bad about\nyourself like if you have shame if you\nhave fear if you have low self-worth\nthen it's gonna heart it's it's hard to\nbe confident and confidence is gonna\naffect all of these numbers right so the\nfirst thing and this is kind of weird\nbecause everyone kind of thinks about oh\nhow do I solve motivation how do I apply\nfor a job you know that they're looking\nsort of externally or even they will\ntalk about habit or brain hacks or you\nknow they'll develop all kinds of\nexternal strategies whereas my\noverwhelming experience is that if you\nactually deal with your negative\nemotions your confidence increases and\nthe motivation naturally goes up the\nmotivation just goes up on its own it's\njust like it happens magically like as I\ndo therapy with people and I help people\nprocess their negative emotions they\njust start being more active in life so\none solution to motivation is just by\ndirectly dealing with your confidence\nand addressing your confidence the next\nthing that you can do is understand\nwhere confidence comes from so\nconfidence a lot of people think that\nconfidence comes from success but\nactually that's not true so if you guys\nwatch some of our videos you'll realize\nthat success after success after success\nactually leads to things like impostor\nsyndrome so confidence comes from\n[Music]\nsurviving failure okay and so what that\nmeans is that when most people are\nthinking about motivation they think\nthat if they get like something good\ngoing on for them they'll be motivated\nand that kind of leads to like\npositivity so what I want you guys to\nunderstand is that you know likelihood\nof success comes from confidence right\nso we kind of have this relationship\nhere and confidence comes from surviving\nfailure and so the real key to building\nconfidence is actually failing and what\nthat means is that failure leads to\nconfidence in confidence leads to\nsuccess so what that means is that\nfailure really leads to success and\nlet's just think about this for a second\nlike if you think about a kid right how\ndoes a kid get confident and walk\nif you if you've ever watched a kid\nlearn how to walk at first there they're\nhesitant to walk because they're afraid\nof falling so they hold onto things and\nyou try to get them to take like one or\ntwo steps and you really have to\nencourage a kid to learn how to walk and\nso the tricky thing here is like how\ndoes a kid learn how to walk and what\nhappens is they fall and then they get\nback up again and they're like oh\nactually falling is not that big of a\ndeal and the more they fall the easier\nit becomes to try so failure makes\ntrying easier and trying is about\nsuccess confidence is about dealing with\nthe uncertain right so confidence isn't\nguaranteeing a result if you're\nconfident in something you're willing to\ndo something with uncertainty and so if\nyou guys want to work on your motivation\nI'd say two things one is change your\ntask okay oh [ __ ] no no no okay so\nchange your task right and the second\nthing is fail this is what you guys\nshould do and if you really want to\nunderstand how to increase your\nmotivation those are the two things that\nyou should do define your task more\nclearly and learn how to fail and then\nthe third thing is deal with your\ninternal emotions because as long as\nthis stuff is kind of sitting here you\nguys are gonna be like Sol and this if\nyou kind of deal with this stuff if you\nget rid of this stuff then suddenly your\nmotivation is going to increase it has\nnothing to do with your habits or think\nI mean it has stuff to do with that but\nI think these are kind of the highest\nyield things okay so we've got a few\nminutes for questions okay so we're\ngonna try this how do I I just click to\ncheck for speak\nspeak accept so I think I'm accepting\npeople so if you guys you guys want to\ntry talking how does this work so Martin\nI'm accepting hate and I'm accepting you\nguys wanna try saying saying something\ncan other people hear you how does this\nwork\n[Music]\nalright\nlooks like our questions are not working\ngreat\nokay so milik le Hadi Josh Joshua Samuel\nDaniel J Aditya you guys want to try\nspeaking\n[Music]\nso cute okay let's see looks like that's\nnot working\nDaniel has joined Oh beautiful we've got\nDaniel and Samuel hey guys okay so ask\nyour questions what questions we've got\nabout five minutes ten minutes oh noes\nhmm okay\nI'm gonna invite more people hello oh\nhey ask your question buddy\nSamuel Daniel\n[Music]\nI can't hear anything I'm just gonna\nstart randomly accepting people maybe\nI'm gonna bust the webinar\nokay Oh Vince has joined the room there\nwe go Dell egg great ask your questions\nguys let's get started we can't hear\nanything\nno see a little bit hello yeah ask away\nbuddy okay I have two questions go for\nthe first it's like my brain overvalues\nmy time because I like gaming so much\nthat like doing anything besides gaming\nso I a high cost for me yep and the\nsecond question is like I think I'm\nmeditating wrong I've been doing like\nfor eight weeks but like I see the\nquests like having major experience at\nfirst and I don't have anything okay so\nlet's start with the first one so I\ncompletely agree with you that your\nbrain over values the time from gaming\nthat's why everyone games because gaming\ngives you a very clear like path to\nsuccess so what should you do about that\nsmaller tisks absolutely right so you\nhave to you have to make the cost of\ngaming like if you tell yourself to\napply for a job or get a girlfriend or\nget healthy or get in shape your brain\nis like that is way too much of a time\ninvestment for a very low likelihood of\nsuccess and so what you need to do is\nchange the equation for your brain\nmm-hmm and you say that you're you're\nmeditating wrong yeah what do you mean\nby that\nI been meditating for our like over\neight weeks and like I don't have a\ntechnique like I tried everything that\nwas on YouTube and I feel like I don't\neven know mine state and I see the\nguests in the show like on the major\nhaving major experiences at first like\nMitch like was major and I don't\nremember right yeah so that's kind of\ncomplicated and has something to do with\na Sun script term called Nick Scherr\nwhich means initiation and I'm sorry but\nI know this is gonna sound completely\nbizarre and is probably gonna create\nmore questions than it answers but\nthere's this concept in meditation\ninstruction where a teacher actually\nimparts a portion of their spiritual\nenergy to the person they're directly\nteaching and I actually didn't put so\nlike you and get in\nshe ate it into a meditation practice by\na teacher or guru and that somehow that\ninitiation is worth more than like\nlearning it from a book or a video or\nwhatever and I actually did not put any\nvalue in that concept I found no\nscientific validity for that concept\nuntil I started making observations that\nthe people that I teach meditation\ndirectly to oftentimes have big\nexperiences on the first try whereas a\nlot of people watching do not I don't\nunderstand quite how that works so I'd\nsay that you know continue practicing\nand try different techniques we're gonna\ndo a little bit of meditation now okay\ndoes anybody else have a question I'm\ngonna Daniel thanks for coming on buddy\nI'm gonna just boot you and don't do it\nif it gives room for someone else\n[Music]\nanybody else have a question yeah yeah\nyeah no yep\nyeah so basically her I was wondering\nthat you said you build confidence by\nsurviving failure yeah and how does it\nactually happen like shouldn't failure\ndiminishes or contents like you\nshouldn't really you can build yourself\nup that way and second question I cover\nthis is that does not depend on your\nperception like is perceiving failure a\ncertain way I mean let me rephrase sorry\nperceiving failure a certain way might\nmake you more my increasing motivation\nand perceiving it definitely might\nreduce it so how do you influence your\nperception of that great questions so\nthe first question was doesn't\nhow does failure lead to doesn't failure\nisn't that a blow to your confidence\nmm-hmm right so the answer is yes so I\ndidn't say that failing leads to\nconfidence what did I say surviving\nfailure there's a big difference hmm\nwhat's the difference your perception\nvery good right so that now we go\nstraight to your second question which\nis that like if if a child\nold Falls and gets hurt and they don't\nfeel like if the consequence of the\naction was negative it's gonna be like\nit's gonna be a punishment and it's not\ngoing to reinforce the behavior\nconfidence comes from surviving failure\nright it's from knowing that you're\nactually alive at the end of the day so\nin my case like when I was failing out\nof college it did not increase my\nconfidence at all it was the knowledge\nthat like one or two years after\ngraduating that you know I was still me\nand that even though I had failed and\nthat was a challenge it was kind of like\nthis idea that okay like failing hasn't\nactually destroyed me that I'm still\nokay I'm still smart I'm still capable\nand I just need to change a little bit\nabout like how I function so surviving\nfailure is a big difference from failing\nand you're right that it has to do with\nyour perception and understand that like\nfailure in and of itself is going to be\na negative reinforcer I mean it's not\nreally the right term it's gonna be a\nPunisher for a particular behavior so\nit's going to reduce a behavior so this\nis exactly why processing and\nunderstanding your perspective is very\nimportant because you're a hundred\npercent correct that you need to change\nyour perspective on what failure means\nso a lot of times when we get wrapped up\nin the ego we look at one failure and\nthen we just stop trying again right so\nif I fail a class I'm not gonna try\nagain but if you play a video game and\nyou lose a game how does that change\nyour behavior you're just queue up again\nexactly so there's so what I want you\nguys to do is think about that and\nobserve within yourself\nwhy doesn't losing a game cause you to\nquit playing and why does losing\nsomething at life cause you to quit\nplaying and if you can understand within\nyourself why you can queue up again\nthat's what confidence is all about\nright when we think about someone who's\nconfident if I asked a girl out and she\nsays no and I queue up again you view\nthat person as confidence that's the\nvery definition of confidence it's not\nletting failure affect you and\nunderstanding that like your worth as a\nhuman being is not necessarily tied to\nthe outcomes of your actions just\nbecause a girl says no doesn't mean that\nI'm unlovable but for a lot of people\nthat's what happens in their\nright I mean there are a lot of reasons\nthat a girl could say no she could be in\na relationship she could have just\nfinished an abusive relationship she\ncould be not interested in men sexually\nthere are all kinds of her romantically\nthere are all kinds of reasons that\npeople say no but when our ego gets\ninvolved it no longer is about that\naspect and starts to be about us okay\nawesome and great questions I'm gonna\ngive you the boot to make room for\nsomeone else okay all right anyone else\nyeah you can go okay you were talking\nabout dealing with negative emotions and\nI grew up being called stupid and\nwhatnot throughout my entire life and\nI've been failing through the course of\nlike my education and that kind of led\nme to take through gap years and I know\nthat this is like a big topic on its own\nbut I want to know like how to\nspecifically deal with those emotions\nbecause even when I'm listening you talk\nI get like this anxiety where I'm like\nI'm not going to understand this I'm not\ngonna understand this like I'm stupid\nI'm stupid okay so you're right that\nthat is a whole topic in and of itself\nand I can't do I can't give you an\nanswer that you deserve in the time that\nwe have left but I'm gonna give you one\nan answer anyway right so the first\nthing is it's good that you notice it so\nI'm gonna ask you is it delag a dozen\nDelic so delegate so do you if you're\nnoticing that thing you are not that\nthing does that make sense yeah\nso that's the first thing to understand\nis that you don't have to be defined by\nthat feeling even though that feeling is\nstrong it's just a feeling it's not\ntruth and I know this sounds kind of\nbizarre but oftentimes we think our\nemotions and our thoughts or facts\nthat's the way that we live and operate\nthrough life they're not facts there are\njust emotions and feelings and if I'm\nwatching a scary movie and I'm scared\nthat doesn't actually mean I'm in danger\nright now and if I can think all kinds\nof thoughts like I can think I'm a dumb\nperson and my mind is telling me that\nbut that doesn't mean it's true it's\njust my mind telling me that so over\ntime what you need to do is learn start\nto appreciate and notice that delag is\nactually different there's a part of you\nthere's like there's some kind of like I\nwant you to think about it this way\nyou're the machine you're the computer\nand you have an OS and then you have\nprograms so the computer is different\nfrom the program and you have a program\nthat's running in your head that says\ndeleg is not gonna understand it\ndelegates not gonna understand it Dalek\nis not gonna understand it\nit's like Spotify like playing in the\nbackground and you're trying to like\nhave a voice chat with someone and\nSpotify is just gonna like be playing in\nthe background and then it's gonna be\nlike really hard for you to function but\njust because it's saying that doesn't\nmean it's true and that starts that\nrecognition starts with noticing and and\nyou know you can also kind of ask\nyourself like what are other like if you\ndon't think so just think about this for\na second if you--if there's a voice in\nyou that says that you're not gonna\nunderstand it why why are you still in\nthe sound webinar why don't you drop out\nyou're not gonna understand in any way\nfair no I'm asking it's not I'm not\nmaking a point I'm genuinely asking\nquestion why didn't you drop out of the\nseminar because I want to try and\nunderstand beautiful so there is another\nprogram in you that says actually I can\nmake a difference actually I want to try\nand all you need to do is learn to\nprioritize that program instead of the\none that tells you that you suck at life\nright right so you have both of those\nprograms within you and then kind of\nlike the angel and devil on your\nshoulder over time you can train\nyourself to listen to one over the other\nbut it starts with individual moments\nlike this where you chose not to drop\nout in the seminar and pay attention to\nthat think about like why didn't you\ndrop out did you think about dropping\nout what happened in your head that kept\nyou from dropping out I mean yeah I did\nwant to drop out of this call because I\nthought my question was not valuable and\nit's something so why didn't you write\nso now you really need to go back in and\npay attention to why you didn't drop out\nwell because I hate the almond aspirin\nsure because I felt as if my issues as\nyou said it's a common issue where\npeople feel as if they well they doubt\nthemselves and then I felt as if since I\nhave the opportunity here I can ask for\nother people as well yeah but so do you\nsee how that's a different program the\ncontent of the program is fine what I'm\npointing out to you is that there is an\nimpulse within you that says drop out\nand there is another impulse within you\nthat says no let me do this as part of\nmy daughter mom let me ask this question\nfor other people even though people are\ngonna think I'm an idiot because I'm\nasking a question that's unrelated but\nyou did it anyway you chose to listen to\nthe part that was gonna make you feel\nlike an idiot\nand that's exactly what embracing\nfailure looks like it's choosing the\nthings that are gonna make you feel like\nan idiot that's how you build confidence\nbecause now delag you're a little bit\nmore confident to speak whether you\nrealize it or not because you did the\nhard thing you made yourself look like\nan idiot and it turned out okay right\nright so now you've survived looking\nlike an idiot how does it feel pretty\ngood there you go\nright it's that simple it's not easy\nit's simple okay great question man and\nmore about develop your confidence okay\nwe're gonna have time for one more and\nthen then I gotta go yep my question is\nabout like the focus of meditation of\nlike motivation okay so like the way of\nlike shifting your focus from the thing\nthat you want to the thing that you know\nis good for you like beating the like\nbiological rewarding system of doing the\nthings you know are not necessarily good\nfor you okay to put that focus on the\nthings you know that are good for you\nand that you don't necessarily want like\nin the instant moment yeah so I would\nactually disagree with your premise how\ndo you know that something is good for\nyou in the sense that it\nwould make me I don't know healthy or\nwould be a an investment of time that I\nknow would worldwide reward me with\nsomething that we do you know that well\nI feel it so where is that feeling\ncoming from it's from like I don't know\na vision of the future that I'd like to\nexcellent growth or so let me explain\nsomething to you Vince fantasies about\nthe future do not factor in to the\nlikelihood of success calculation that\nyour brain does this is exactly my point\nso I can fantasize about wanting yacht\nlike I want to have a yacht I want it to\nhave like very fast internet connection\nI'm gonna get a gaming PC stick it on my\nyacht and I want to sail around the\nworld while I game while I'm on the\nocean and then I want to dock in places\nand eat delicious local food and what\ndoes that do to my motivation well it\njust enters it because it's kind of a\nunattainable ideal absolutely right so I\nthink you're so you're you're starting\nwith a couple of assumptions that I\ndon't agree with and that's that you\nkind of say there are some things that\nare good for me and there's some things\nthat are not good for me and how do I\nchoose the thing that is good for me\ninstead of like playing video games and\nI think that your brain doesn't actually\nunderstand that those things are good\nfor you because I think that they are\nlike they're they're not things that you\nfeel they're like random rational\nthoughts or fantasies which don't\nactually lead to behavioral change that\ndoesn't go into the equation so I think\nactually what you need to do is go back\nto that like defining what you want\nthings so the likelihood of success\ncalculation so like what's a goal of\nlike what's an example of something that\nyou think is good for you the you doing\nhealthy perfect\nso I even addressed this almost directly\neating healthy is not a thing how do you\neat healthy tell me you put your\nattention towards buying certain types\nfood and cooking certain types of mean\nfor you so what is the likelihood of\nsuccess of that the likelihood of\nsuccess of putting your attention on\nbuying healthy food is pretty high but\nI'm not so sure about that\nright so like you my point is that use\noffered a very complicated statement\nputting your attention on buying food\nand then cooking it yeah so what you\nneed to do is chunk up each of those\nbecause I agree with you that if you put\nyour full attention on the buying yeah\nthat becomes easier than quote-unquote\neating healthy but the problem is that\nyour brain is like they're a bunch of\nother things that you're talking about\nhere you're talking about\nyou know being willful when you go to\nthe grocery store you're talking about\nbuying food and a lot of people buy\nhealthy food but then what happens then\nyou have to cook it you have to prepare\nyour food yes - and which how to do with\nthat well it depends on the case but I\nmean if you buy the if your answer is it\ndepends on the case your brain\ncalculates that is a low likelihood of\nsuccess if your brain thinks it depends\nthat's not a high likelihood of success\ndoes that make sense yeah so therein\nlies your problem because you're talking\nabout eating healthy and health is the\nexample I use because it's a great\nexample of how we actually poorly define\ntasks for our brain and our brain\ndoesn't know what to do with that yeah\nso I think in your case I would start by\nreally examining where you get the idea\nthat there is like something that's good\nfor you and something that isn't because\nI think your brain believes the exact\nopposite it's like we can do this weird\nfantasy random amalgamation of tasks\nthat has an unclear chance of success or\nwe can play a video game yeah got it\nokay I got a run so thank you very much\nVince we're gonna do I'm gonna go ahead\nand I'm sorry Mikey I gotta kick you but\nwe're gonna do five minutes of\nmeditation and then I really do have to\nrun okay\nso sit up straight we're gonna do not II\nshould be which is alternate nostril\nbreathing so take your fingers and do\nthis so what you're doing is folding\nthese two down if you have to do this\nthat's okay it's not a big deal it can\nalso be like this or something like that\nit's not a big deal\ntake your right nostril block your thumb\nI mean block your right nostril breathe\nin switch and out breathe in through the\nsame nostril switch out in switch out in\nswitch out in switch out in switch out\nand now continue at your own pace\ngo ahead and finish the breath that\nyou're on let your eyes remain closed\nlet your hands relax\nand now kind of notice once again that\nthere is sort of a basic you there is an\nobserving self that there may be\nthoughts emotions desires conclusions\nbut those are all products from you\nthey're not you so all those little\nvoices inside you that say don't bother\ndo this or don't do this is your choice\nwhether you listen to them or not and\nthat from this place\nhow true or false they are becomes a\nlittle bit more clear\nwhen you're ready go ahead and come on\nback thank you guys very much\nday one of our webinar we're gonna\ncontinue tomorrow I don't know if we're\ngonna do tomorrow maybe we may talk a\nlittle bit about managing relationships\nand tight quarters given covin so like\nhow to communicate matter with people\nthings like that maybe something else\nI'm not quite sure so thank you guys\nvery much and we'll see you guys\ntomorrow 9:00 AM cxeh Central Standard\nTime and we will upload I think to\nYouTube so take care"
