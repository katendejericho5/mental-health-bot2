    "transcript": "let's get started so welcome Scott you\nsaid it's Scott yeah yes that's good\nyeah yeah so Scott tell me a little bit\nabout you know what what's bringing you\non stream today and and how we can be\nhelpful I guess pretty much a core it's\njust video game addiction okay so I play\nway too many games okay like upwards of\npretty much like 18 to 20 hours a day\nand I'll get a whole lot of sleep so oh\nwow a lot of games yeah that's kind of\nan average and it pretty much effects a\nwhole lot of stuff like friendships\nrelationships like outside of games and\nstuff like that\nsure and obviously like ability to get a\njob so what are the things like gaming\nis kind of like a kind like a recovery\nthing for me like if I get some bad news\nI could just go into a big spiral of\nplaying all the games and stuff like\nthat so okay mmm that kind of kind of\nshifting away from that it's kind of\nreplacing it with something healthier I\nguess I'll just hang out as a bit sure\num and can you tell me a little bit\nabout which games you play um a lot of\nworld warcraft um like way too much um\nbetter league as well and fighting games\nas well like which ones smash Tekken\nmostly okay and in and what are you\nusually doing Wow um at the when I play\nclassic and I just finished ranking and\nclassic if that makes me like ranking is\npretty much just like a competition of\nno life like you like one to fourteen\neveryone ranks up you get a certain\namount of points every week and if you\ndon't play for a week you lose points so\nit's like notorious for just being like\nno life you just have to keep no lifing\noh interesting so it's actually a\ncompetition where who can put much time\nand it's not skill at all interesting\nreally weird what do you mean by rank up\nfrom 1 to 14 supreme it's like you get\nfrom rank 1 to 14 used to everyone\nstarts at 1 and then you get punch like\na bracket system and so like whoever\ngets the most honor in a week gets it\nput into a bracket bracket 1 well\ntechnically bracket 14 gives you the\nmost points and then gradually gets\nworse they'll be like 7 people and like\na large server back\none kind of thing okay top bracket\nthey'll get the most points and then you\nwreck up to 14 to get the Reg 14 is not\na PvP thing in game or is it outside a\ngame never I ain't gay ranked for things\nlike a you got like a title high\nwallowed or grand marshal okay Nikita\nthe Kia pretty much okay okay so but so\nso but the rank is determined by the\namount of honor and honor can just be\nlined in right yeah yeah pretty much\nlike people bought it like all the time\nlike people just live and I'll track\nValley and just afk all the time okay\nit's literally just to place the most\nokay and and is that fun\num oddly enough yes but I've kind of got\nlike a like a ladder addiction like when\nI see my name go up on a ladder\nI get happier okay when it goes down I\nget worse it was the same in League okay\nlike if I slow myself like getting lower\nrank I wasn't as happy but if I was\ngoing I was tapping sir okay\nyeah what's I'm kind of curious about\nthat when you say happy what does that\nmean um I guess it's like a progress\nthing like when you see progress you get\nhappier like I guess it's kind of the\nsame if you had a promotion to work\nyou're happier you get a promotion in\nleague I'm happier if I got my rank I'm\nhappy and and so it sounds like you're\nable to get a lot of happiness through\nranking up to to an extent and then you\nrealize like you're not this is all like\njust a virtual thing it's like you don't\nget any real life benefits from it I\nguess how do you realize that when does\nthat happen um pretty much when I talk\nto the people that I went to school with\nand they're talking about things that\nthey've gained IRL like you know like\nthey just bought a new car or that kind\nof thing how does that make you feel um\nnot the best kind of like I'm wasting\ntime I guess so okay so you feel like\nyou're wasting time when you're talking\nto your friends no wasting time when I'm\nplaying a whole little while when I'm\ndoing you feel the feeling of wasting\ntime yeah I guess that's when I talk to\nmy friends and I I realized that if I\ncompare myself to pretty much the\naverage person they don't have a lot of\nthe life skills that they have Oh\nor a lot of the experiences in life that\nthey have mm-hmm so it's all my\nexperiences pretty much comes from my\ngames okay hmm\nI'm just thinking a little bit about\nyour brain yeah and the interesting\nthing is that you know you know if you\npresent your brain with something that\nmakes you feel happy and then you\npresent it with something that makes you\nfeel bad your brain is gonna gravitate\ntowards the thing that makes you feel\nhappy\nright we don't walk around punching\nourselves in the face because that's\nbeautiful and and so if I think about it\nwithout what I would imagine that your\nbrain is actually telling you to play\nmore video games and telling you to talk\nto your friends less yeah yeah pretty\nmuch 20 cent that's pretty much how it\ngoes like I I used to play a lot of\nleague when it was like a thing that I\ncould play my school friends and then\nkind of gravitated away from it when Wow\ncame out and it's less so of like a\nfriend grind it more of like a solo\ngrind like if I can stay up for like 20\nhours and just played all the time\nthen I get the feeling of being happy in\nthe progression aspect in games while\nnot we're getting reminded of the whole\nthey're progressing and life think yeah\nabsolutely and and that too is kind of\ntricky because I think sometimes our\nbrain doesn't know the difference\nbetween I mean so the reason that we\nfeel like progressing so just think\nabout this for a second the reason that\nyou feel like progressing like how does\nthat work how do you have any idea how\nyou're you like how do you how does a\nhuman being feel like they're\nprogressing like what's the circuitry or\nmechanism behind that any idea um I\nguess it's I really know like the\nscientific way obviously but I mean I\nguess it's just like the the emotional\nvalue that comes with not being where\nyou previously were I guess but so you\nknow being somewhere that you weren't\nfeeling up I guess I don't know yeah yes\nit's a sense of progress right yeah and\nand where do you think this is gonna\nsound that kind of a silly question but\nwhere in your body does that sense of\ncome from like what on you finishes the\nchest like I feel I feel a lot more\nwhole I guess mm-hmm kind of sad to say\nI think but it's I feel a lot more\naccomplished yeah just to know that if I\nwalk around like the main city that I'm\na higher rank then pretty much like\nevery player yeah so it just feels\nbetter yeah and and so you know it's\nkind of interesting we because we think\nabout addiction and you know a lot of\ntimes like but we think about addiction\nis a bad thing right like do you think\nthat your addiction to video games is a\nbad thing I do yeah why because there's\na lot more efficient things I could be\ndoing with my life I guess like this is\na very temporary thing whereas like if I\nlook at like the French for example\nwho's working maybe like 40 hour weeks\nat like maybe not the best job but he's\ngetting money and he's gaining life\nskills he's updating like he's getting\nsomething that's good for a CV whereas\nI'm getting titles in a game and you\nknow is more efficient than yours\nbecause it helps them more in the long\nrun I don't think that my addiction\nhelps me in the long run other than\nmaybe competitiveness and like addiction\nhelp you does it help you yeah I mean in\nthe in the current time\nit pretty much helps me with just\nfeeling whole I feel a bit happier while\nplaying more I guess yeah so why do you\nsay that his I mean so let me just let\nme just think about this for a second so\nI could go to a job that I don't like\nvery much\nfor the purpose of getting something on\nmy CV which also putting together a CV\ndoesn't make you feel whole or\naccomplished it's just boring ass work\nyeah and and then or I can feel whole\nand happy and accomplished through\nplaying a video game why would I want to\ndo the former instead of the latter\nbecause I feel like I don't know I see I\nsee a lot of things like a grind like\nwell ground and then there's like the\nIRL ground kind of like if you're\nworking like a nine-to-five job Monday\nto Friday you might not be in a happiest\nstate but it's the fact that you can\nknow that it's maybe leading towards the\nright thing like towards the right thing\nwell it updates a CV it gives you maybe\na good reference if you do your best\nthen it can it can lead to the right\nthing if you do it the right way\nobviously if it's if I'm doing a job\nthat I'm absolutely depressed doing and\nI have really bad work ethic that it\nmight not be a good thing mm-hmm do you\nhave a job but I don't why do you think\nthat is because if I get rejection I\npretty much fall back to Wow\nor I fall back to games um and the fear\nof rejection pretty much stops me from\nputting my CV out there and that kind of\nthing\nand it just keeps me playing well say if\nI go to a job interview I think I did\nokay and then I don't hear back anything\nat all then it's like you get that kind\nof sinking feeling that you thought you\nwere doing well but you're not and then\nit's the kind of just like to kick back\ninto the middle of the hole like you\nclimb your way out to actually stomach\nit to actually go to the interview with\nlike pretty bad social anxiety so\nstomach it to actually get out of my\nhouse and go to the interview do the\ninterview and then not getting a reply\nor anything that is kind of like a kick\nin the face back to the hole back to 20\nhours away all day yeah absolutely man I\nmean okay so this is why I was kind of\nconfused cuz you say like you know\ngetting a job and working on your CV you\nknow it leads to something but what I'm\nhearing from you is actually quite the\nopposite I think what I'm hearing from\nyou is that like trying to do something\nin the real world actually you know it's\ngonna kick you back in the hole like\nthat's what you know the thing is I feel\nlike if I put more into it it might not\nkick me back in the hole if I was able\nto really I mean it sounds like you it\nsounds like you you really have a lot\nlike you have these feelings of\nrejection and fear of rejection sounds\nlike you what kind of feel socially\nanxious and actually you're putting a\nlot into it every time you go out for a\njob interview\nthat's the thing I feel like I could be\ndoing it more like that's that's where I\nthink the addiction comes into place\nbecause I I know that I could be doing\nit more but it's just the question could\nbe doing what more putting more effort\ninto finding a job or any more effort\ninto that kind of thing\nI mean I think that makes sense\ntheoretically but what I'm hearing from\nyou is like let's just think about this\nfor a second let's think about your\nbrain right yep so like your brain you\nlike overcome a lot of these like social\nanxieties and fears of rejection and\nthen you go out into the world and you\napply for a job and what happens don't\nget anything like no response so the\nnext time you apply for a job so you've\nbeen rejected one more time right so\nwhat happens to the fear of your\nrejection every time you get rejected\nit's theoretically I guess it would get\nit feels like the social exciting things\nlike that getting easier but I don't\nknow no no forget about theoretically\nwell let's talk about you what happens\nto your fear of rejection every time you\nget rejected\njalaja absolutely right so let's think\nabout this because I don't think it gets\neasier I think let's trust you let's\nforget about theory ok because theory\nleads us to stupid answers let's trust\nyou so like if I if I get on a horse and\nthe and I start riding the horse and the\nhorse throws me off and I break an arm\nand then I get back on the horse again\nand then I go riding and it throws me\noff and I break a leg like what happens\nto my fear of the horse every time the\nhorse tosses me off it's gonna go with\nabsolutely right and that's what it\nfeels like it doesn't get easier it\nactually gets harder every time you get\nrejected the sense of rejection grows\nand so what is your brain gonna do if\nyou're getting rejected over and over\nagain and feeling bad about yourself\nshut down and give into habits not give\ninto habits a very important Scott I\nwant you to realize this it's not giving\nin to anything it's action\nlearning ruta rights giving in presumes\nthat like you're like it's failing does\nthat make sense giving in sounds like a\nfailure yeah but you're not actually\nfailing your brain is actually trying to\nhelp you out it's succeeding it's\nlearning it's helping you by telling you\nhey Scott don't apply for a [ __ ] job\nbecause all you all it does is hurt you\nit's almost like you have a an abusive\nrelationship with life and you're like\nyou know you're the person who keeps on\ngoing back to their abusive partner even\nthough they get beat and your brain is\ntelling you that hey life is abusive\nbecause every time you try to live life\nwhat happens Scott get kicked absolutely\nright because you brought it you get\nkicked back in the hole so what do you\nthink about that it's really easy to\njust play Wow all day absolutely and why\nis it really easy to play Wow cuz it's a\nreally easy escape it's it's where I\nfeel I mean I escaped bad word good why\nis it a bad word mmm because that kind\nof makes it feel like I'm losing yes\nyeah so it's not an escape what is it um\ncomfort sure yes yeah absolutely right\nso I'd say it's almost like a strategy\nto do what for you to just say\ncomfortable not put myself into any kind\nof emotionally harming situations and\njust stay where I'm comfortable and\nhappy yeah so I don't like the word\ncomfort because that too has a value\njudgement right if someone decides to\nstay comfortable we like judge them and\nwe say like oh you shouldn't put\nyourself out push push for more yeah so\nI like the word happy because I think\nthat's closer to the truth I also like\nthe word protects protect so it feels\nprotective to me it's like tanking like\ngaming is the way that your brain tanks\nthe bad stuff in life yep what do you\nthink about that makes sense because it\nkind of shelters me for everything else\nwhich is what choice does sir absolutely\nright and is that a bad thing I don't\nnecessarily think so why not because I\nthink everyone should have something\nthat tanks the kind of harmful things in\nlife for me\nright now so what do we do about that\nhey don't know I'll be honest I I'm not\nreally sure that's a great answer man\nyeah I'm not so sure but I'm hoping we\ncan try to figure something out yeah\nsure so I think the first thing to\nunderstand is that I want you to stop\nthinking about gaming as an addiction\nokay because like an addiction is a\nnegative thing it's something that you\nhave to overcome and and what am I\ntrying to like when I'm walking you to\ninterpret things in a particular way\nlike what am I trying to do like how am\ni pushing you towards like thinking\nabout gaming as it is like a I don't\nknow that it's a healthy thing that it's\nthat it is good for me at the moment but\nI mean I yeah I don't think you vested\nabnormal but I think for me it's a good\nthing at the moment yeah so so I think\nhealthy and good for you also imply\ncertain value judgments right so I don't\nthink that your gaming is healthy I\nthink it is protective protectors Yeah\nright so so I think that a lot of the\nstuff that you said in terms of sort of\nbeing behind in life and stuff like that\nI think all that stuff makes sense I\nthink you should play less than 18 to 20\nhours of Wow a day and I also think that\nyou don't play just because you're\naddicted I think you play because your\nbrain has two options it's kind of like\nwe can do this one thing that leads to\nuncertain like progress which is like\napply for a job and work on our CV\nbecause you say that you know that's\ngonna make your future better I don't\nthink your brain understands that and I\ndon't because I don't think that that's\nfair because what has your CV done for\nyou Scott\nwe've proved us nothing this right so\nthen here's the thing your brain is\nsmart your brain is working for you and\nso your brain is like Scott why the [ __ ]\nare we working on this CV it's never\ngotten you anything instead we've got\nthis other thing that gives you\nhappiness accomplishment and feeling\nwhole like why would you ever want to\nwork on your CV when you can get all of\nthose things here and all your CV ever\ngets you is\nmore sadness exactly yeah so it's not an\naddiction it's actually a protective\nmechanism what is that big sigh what do\nyou think yeah I just just like a\nrealization thing because it doesn't\nmake sense like because it's like I feel\nlike a lot of people aren't necessarily\nhappy with their jobs but they do it\nbecause they know that they have to and\nlike I'm in a pretty little fortress\nsituation where I don't really\nnecessarily need income right now so\nit's I feel like I'm lucky but I feel\nlike I could be doing better which is\nthe sigh I think but it's yeah just I\nrealize I should say I guess yeah that\nyou could be doing better what does that\nmean um I mean I could be living\nindependently I could be getting income\nbuying a things that I want that kind of\nthing I guess sure you couldn't be doing\nbetter what is your brain how does your\nbrain feel about that it wants to play\nWow feel about doing better um anxious I\nguess like cuz it obviously the thought\nof doing better obviously means I'm\nstriving to actually better myself which\nin itself makes me feel quite anxious\ndoes your brain care about bettering\nyourself\num I guess directly not but that's\ncorrect\nbrain doesn't give a [ __ ] doesn't and\nbettering yourself that's your mind\nthose are your intentions but the brain\nis like like if you think about it like\nthat's why we have to fight against\nourselves like when we exercise right\nevery if you go out and you try to\nexercise your brain is like what what\nare we doing well yeah this is fabulous\n[ __ ] yeah yeah like you're just you're\nrunning but there's no reason to run\nthere's no there's no purpose so our\nbrain is kind of the idea bettering\nyourself is not something there's no\nlike neuroscience circuit about\nbettering yourself there is a circuit\naround progress right and the tricky\nthing is that we have a circuit that and\nthe problem is that part of our brain\ncan't tell the difference between\nprogress in the real world and progress\nin a virtual world right right so like\nyou could also argue that if you trade\nstocks during the day and you see a\nnumber on a computer screen go\nwe can think of that as progress but the\nstimulus for the brain is exactly the\nsame whether you're seeing the honor go\nup or the number and your bank account\ngo up in that moment does that make\nsense yeah it is just a number on a\nscreen both of that are just a number on\na screen we tend to as a society at\nattribute more value to one than the\nother and I don't think that that's a\nmistake but our brain is just like hey\nwe're doing better and that's a very\nvery deeply wired circuit of our brain\nthat sort of if you think about it like\nyou know kids fall and then they get\nback up and they walk again yeah and\nthey keep on failing over and over and\nover again but it's that that sort of\nstrive it's something called intent to\nmastery so we all have this baked in\npart of our brain that kind of like\ntries to get better at stuff and wants\nto see progress and it doesn't care\nwhether it's learning how to throw a\nball or standing up and walking or you\nknow grinding on other pitous yeah yeah\nyeah yeah so I mean where does the sense\nof better come from tell me about that\nmeaning like doing better and life oh\nyeah like why do you want to do better\nbecause I don't wanna be a dropkick my\nlife pretty much I don't want to miss\nlike sorry just does nothing like living\non like social benefits and stuff like\nthat I guess like I don't want to be I\nwant to study I want to raise a family I\nwant to provide I want to do all those\nthings so that I can I don't know if\nit's like leave a mark on the world or\nwhatever it is but like I want to do\nsomething that's like actually means\nsomething rather than just does that\nmean in like a I guess like\nto provide like I don't know I want\nthere to be someone who actually\nunderstood like this person did\nsomething or like I don't know why that\nis I don't know if that's like a deeply\nlodged thing in people's brains but it's\nsomething that I want to do I want to\nlike have my kids know that they had\nlike a dad who cared for them and wanted\nto do something that's like I'm like\nactually want to do things I guess so\nwhat is it that you want can you say\nthat again uh to have people be proud of\nme I guess\nya can't just think for a second yeah of\ncourse so I just want to point something\nout so I think there's a difference\nbetween what you want and the ways in\nwhich your mind comes up with fulfilling\nthat want so you said something about\nhaving a family and and being successful\nand and having a job and stuff like that\nyou said that these are all the things\nthat you want that's what you mean by\nbetter because I was asking about it\nbetter but what I think the really core\nof I think those are all pictures of\nthis sense of being proud does that make\nsense I think what you really want is\nfor people to look at you and say like\nhey that's a that's an awesome person\nyeah and if we think about it you know\nwhen you think about what games protect\nyou from what is the main thing that\nthey protect you from kind of mentioned\nthe word a couple of times there's one\nword that sadness from what drives you\ninto games more than anything else\nhappiness what negative thing what what\nwhat let me put it this way what is what\nour games tanking from like what are\nthey taking damage the real world uh I\nfavor the word I used\nyeah so I mean I mentioned rejection\nseveral times oh yeah right so like for\nme the thing that seems to float to the\nsurface out of everything you've said is\nrejection yeah what do you think is that\nthe main thing that they tank yeah yeah\nokay pretty much so what do you think is\nthe relationship between wanting\npeople to be proud of you and rejection\nif any are those two things connected I\nfeel like most people will go through\nrejection of my life and that they'll\nyou kind of just have to tank through it\nand that I don't know feels like\ndirectly connected though okay fair\nenough yeah okay so let's think through\nthis right so you have to tank through\nit but games tank rejection right yeah\nand as long as that rejection is there\nand it's big you're gonna need to take\nit so there are two things that you can\ndo you can tank damage or you can do\nwhat do damage you can do damage\nabsolutely yeah or so if you're a rogue\nright and Wow and you're in a raid the\nthe main tank serves as protecting you\nfrom damage what's the other like\ncritical role that we're missing feeling\nabsolutely yeah so I think that gaming\nserves as a tank but the question is\nlike like where is the healing in your\nlife right so if we think about the fear\nof rejection is that which keeps you\ninto the game playing the game yeah and\nthe more that we kind of like the more\nyou're afraid of rejection the more you\nneed your tank and tanking is the game\nyou're the DPS like what are we missing\nhealer like what heals so what is it\nthat needs to be healed\nI guess the damage that comes through\nbecause of the rejection absolutely\nright so now our question becomes when\nwas the first time you were kicked into\nthe pit probably right after high school\ntell me about that I pretty much I\nfinished high school and I pretty much\ndid it nothing for a while like I didn't\nreally know what to get into so I was\njust really down and just didn't really\nknow what to do with anything and then I\nwas found a couple games to play that\nobviously filled the void and then it\nwas it was really hard to get out of\nthat pit of\nplaying games and being can I just\ninterrupt you for a second\nyeah so use the phrase filling the void\nyeah that implies to me like healing\nright that that implies you're fixing if\nI've got a pet and I fill it in the pit\nis no longer there\nI don't think games filled in the voyage\nright\nI think they boarded it up a little bit\nthere yeah right tap stuff a bit sorry\nfor interrupting you but I think that no\nthat's it's a distinction to the notice\ncatch yeah\nyeah so it sounds like you said that you\nwere you weren't really sure what you\nwere doing after high school can you\ntell us a little bit yeah and anyone\nit's like a kinda like an IT course but\nI feel like I only really went into an\nIT course cuz I think it's like I think\nit's this really common if people who\nliked games just go into IT even though\nI don't have like I don't have like a\nwhole lot of interest in it sure like\nit's just like a I think it's just a\nthing that's real common yes\nScott let me just hypothesize with you\nfor a second so you know if you say that\nyou finished high school and you felt\npretty directionless that may have been\nwhen you got knocked into the pit but I\nthink the pit started getting dug way\nbefore that probably does that make\nsense so - well tell me a little bit\nabout like do you remember times in your\nlife like before you finished high\nschool where you kind of were rejected\nor you dealt with rejection absolutely\nyeah through high school because we\nmoved to this country from I moved from\nEngland when I was pretty young and I've\npretty much always had an issue with\nallergies and I have like eczema and\nlike pretty bad expects me through high\nschool and I don't know if I was like a\nstress through school but it was always\nlike really really really bad like I'd\ngo to school like with just bad x-bow of\nmy face and things like that so I think\nI don't know like how would it be\nconnected I guess it was just like a\nwhen I come I was just excited to come\nhome and just play games cuz in games I\nwas felt comfortable well protected from\nnot having to show my face and things\nlike that I guess yeah go yeah so let's\ntake a step back from analyze\nso let's just understand so tell me\nabout when when did you move from the UK\nto you're in the US or what I'm in New\nZealand oh your news okay so yeah so\ntell me when did you move to New Zealand\nhow old were you I think I was about 11\nokay and what was what do you remember\nabout growing up in England\num not a whole lot um pretty much like\nthrough England houses school family I\nhad like two friends in England that I\nwould like go to the house and things\nlike that I'm just just off after school\n- but what was what was home like for\nyou when you were growing up um\nbusy like it was pretty much almost one\nparent was working one was home and it\nwas kind of shifted in and out but my\nsister's a big gamer what a mess this is\na big game and the other one stop how\nmany my dad was a big gamer zone - okay\nolder younger both older I'm the\nyoungest okay and what was it like do\nyou remember what it was like being a\nkid with your sisters at no like in\nEngland um I don't have like too many\nlike crazy memories I guess not -\nnothing really like pops out I was like\na distinctive thing were you guys close\num yeah yeah it kind of shifted between\nthe two of them I was always closer to\none than the other I guess I don't know\nwhy that was but yeah\nyou said your dad was a gamer yeah yeah\nmy dad used to play a lot of games where\nhe's like oh well he passed away last\nyear\nso I'm sorry to hear that yeah but he\ngot me into like a lot of games like he\ngot me into like a lot of the RPGs that\nI grew up with the kind of fantasy and\nstuff like that and I think he also got\nme into a while like when we were like\nour first computer when we moved here\nand had a friend that played while at\nschool and it was yeah pretty much\nstarted from there what's it like\ntalking about this um it's okay I kind\nof I don't think I was like crazy close\nwith my dad like just as a whole but\ntalking about it feels okay I guess I\nkind of come to terms of that I think\ncome to terms with what just his passing\nand talking about it as okay I don't\nreally tell people I don't\nI've never really talked people like\none-on-one I'm from like one or two\nfriends just cuz I don't know I don't\nreally like I don't know if it's like a\nselfish thing but I don't like ten a a\nconversation like all on me or like\nmaking people feel uncomfortable because\nI know that that kind of thing can make\npeople feel uncomfortable I guess do you\nfeel like you're burdening other people\nby talking about your dad yeah yeah I\nfeel like if it's like I don't know I'm\nnever gonna bring it up unless it's like\ntopic like the other time I told the\nonly time I float like one of my really\nclose friends was because we were going\nto another funeral and until then he\ndidn't know I'm gonna just think a\nsecond okay yeah yeah of course of\ncourse\nwhat's wrong with burdening other people\num I guess I don't want to unnecessarily\ncause like I don't want to say like\nunhappiness but I don't want to like\nunnecessarily a shift a mood of like a\nroom or something like that so unless\nit's like a topical thing I don't really\nwant to just bring it up\nI just I feel like it can like if every\nwas having a good mood or like\neveryone's just like completely contain\nor anything like that I don't feel a\nneed to bring it up I guess do you miss\nyour dad um yeah from time to time it's\nnot like good\nnot particularly um we had like a lot of\narguments - yeah cuz he he was one of\nthe people like really struggling or\nlike kind of get her drop on things like\nthat but I obviously I'd miss him but\nit's not like yeah how did he make you\nfeel when tell about those arguments um\nI had shifted from different things like\nmultiple things like waking up past 12\no'clock because I have to play till like\n3 o'clock because that's when the keys\nwere there I was something like that\nwe were talking about after high school\num oh no that was recent that was like\npretty much a couple of months before I\npassed I guess okay um and then after\nhigh schools kind of just get a job no\nget a job no funny thing I guess hmm I'm\ntrying and then it was get a job\nI'm trying what were things like between\nyou and him during high school um for\nthe most part they were okay like it was\nkind of just yeah there's the haggis\nsame with it was like the same\nrelationship I have with my mom which\nwas like fine good oh yeah was it good\nI'd say yeah they're like cuz he was\nlike a bit of an alcoholic like so\ntippy time so it was a little bit shifty\nbut as a general thing it was good like\nI never like resented him or anything\nlike that\nI mean there's a difference between fine\nand God\noh yeah of course so I'm hearing from\nyou is that it was okay yeah yeah pretty\nmuch it was okay like like it sounds bad\nto say tolerate but kinda one of the\nwords that pops up I guess yeah\nwhat were you tolerating um just the\nfact that he would come home drunk and\nbe it would be really uncomfortable like\nI'm not very good around drunk people\nbut I think that might stem from that I\nmean how old were you when he would come\nhome drunk pretty much all the way from\nlike 14 to like 21 okay do you know any\n14-year olds that are quote unquote good\nat handling drunk people yeah I guess\nnot I guess it's not really something\nyou can just pick up as a skill okay\nyeah I mean I'm sorry did they not teach\nthat to you along with history and\ndinosaur I guess I must have missed his\nclass yeah so so you said 14 what\nchanged when you were 14 why did he\nstart coming home drunk then um I guess\nthat's just kind of like an early\nrecollection but I guess he would\nprobably come home around like 11\no'clock and I'd probably be in bed\nbefore that before sweating so I was\nkind of early recollection would you say\nthat you were happy growing up in\nEngland\num content and I really have like too\nmany memories of England I guess it's\nkind of just about it's all here like no\njust together kind of a blur I guess\nyeah from ginger and everyone else yeah\nyeah does anything in particular pop out\nin terms of memories you have any strong\nmemories from before you move to New\nZealand it's a bit like a lot of\nfootball and like a soccer and they\nstill are quite good so I guess have\nmemories of that Jam how did it feel I'm\ngood at football yeah I loved it like\nI've always been a very competitive\nperson so it's like I think that's why\nmy guy loved games as well sure but yeah\ndo you still play football not as much\nas I'd like to but yeah I'll like your\ngrandma's like my niece and stuff like\nthat oh you have a nice yes oh this is\nsir\nhas two kids how old are your kids or\nnephew oldest niece oh yeah oldest is\nseven I think and nephew is two and a\nhalf I think how's your relationship\nwith them um pretty good obviously my\nnephew like every time I say me six\nscreaming was happy um\nsalmon that nice basically what do they\ncall you uh scat scat scat II I don't\nknow why the reason I ask is because\nkids usually have weird names for yeah\nyeah yeah yeah interesting and so what\nwas life for you after you moved to New\nZealand I don't really know when did you\nstart um pretty much as soon as I moved\nhere just because could when he compared\nEnglish to New Zealand one of the\nbiggest things you see a scenery as\ntrees and I have like real bad hay fever\nso it got real bad like I got like a\nreally bad eyes like why I asked you\nlike really bloodshot and like puffy and\nstuff like that so I was always like\nreal nervous going to school at first\ncuz what were you nervous about\njust like appearance like cuz it would\nget really bad\nx2 I get really bad and then I just like\nwouldn't really want to go out because I\nfelt like I look like a puffy mess\nmm-hmm\nI can sympathize with the feeling of\npuffy mess because I had eczema and I\nstill have allergies everything's just\nswollen yeah yeah puffy mess is actually\na great way to describe it yeah and did\npeople ever comment about your skin or\nyour puffiness er um no but I was like\nreally new to England like when I was in\nlike like primary school like promise\nwhen I first moved to not really my\ndouble take a couple cases of bullying\nthrough like maybe like 13 or 14 and\nthen again like mmm\nearly midway through high school can you\ntell me about 13 14 yes it's kind of\nthis doing school\nfootball and I don't know kind of bad\nwith that kind of memory stuff I guess\nbut what do you remember yeah about\nbeing bullied her I just remember like a\ncouple of moments of being bullied just\nlike I heard like I'm called alien and\nstuff like that which was there yeah\npretty weird but wise cuz the ala do\nstuff oh well yeah I don't really have\nlike too many recollections of them that\nbut really sure and then what about when\nyou were a little bit older I had\nsurgery a few times like cuz I've got I\nlike pretty bad kidney as well just like\na couple of health issues and I remember\none time I was hospital for quite a\nwhile and I came out and I was a little\nbit chunky and next one was bad I just\nkind of got belief like oh stuff as well\nso kind of status with the mix do you\nremember how they made you feel bad that\nearly yeah I don't really remember like\nwhat they'd say anything like that but\nyeah wonderfully avoided like like\ncertain parts of the school because I\nknew people around there hey how can we\nadd a little bit more color or depth to\nthe way that they made you feel what do\nyou mean sorry\nso you say they made you feel bad yeah\nsomething more descriptive yeah we don't\nhave to talk about the scene tell me\nabout what if you can tell me what the\nfeeling was like I mean the biggest\nthings like outcasted I guess play I was\ndefinitely outcast for like a certain\ngroup of people because I don't know\nlike obviously high school people hang\nout in groups do you feel like an\noutcast throw out some of the early as a\nhigh school I did and then max but\nstarted getting a little bit better\ninstead of getting a bit more confidence\nand realizing that there was other\npeople who played Yan's a lot so it was\nkind of like his hangover those people\nokay but earlier you found your people\nyou found us yeah exactly yeah yeah I\nmean I'm just wondering you know would\nyou say that because I when I think\nabout outcasted um you know it's it's an\nit's an interesting verb it's not a verb\nthat I hear very much and you know not\nto not to be a little bit too Freudian\nfor you but I wonder if rejected would\nbe a similar word yeah yeah yeah yeah it\nwould be some of them fresh feels the\nsame way I guess yeah like what feels\nthe same\njust like the usage of the word like\nI'll cast it rejected like it's yeah\nlet me ask you something when you go to\nlet's say you apply for a job when it's\nlast time you applied for a job three\nweeks ago\nokay and have you heard back no dude is\nthe feeling when you think about that or\nwhen I ask that question even that no is\nnot a regular no right no the feeling\nthat you have is that do you does it\ndoes it smell or taste like what used to\nfeel like when kids would comment about\nwhen they would call you an alien or I\nfeel like it's a little bit different\nbecause them denied me a job isn't like\na hateful thing like I don't take it\npersonally sure it's just like a there\nwas someone better or something else\nhappened which is like perfectly fine\nlike is that cool yeah like if I didn't\nget the job it means someone else did\nwhich means there's probably someone\nthere was just more applicable or better\nwhich is okay but like the whole\nHighfill comments and I was like that\nwas like a direct thing that was to me\nit's true they feel very different okay\nso that that's very helpful for me to\nknow thank you for sharing that so let\nme ask you something you know if\nsomeone's if there was just a better\ncandidate out there being told no\nindirectly yes so it still feels like\nI'm not good enough for being rejected I\nseem so so so one is not being good\nenough one is being persecuted or\nattacked yeah yeah exactly yeah do you\nremember if there's anything that\nhappened to you that made you feel not\ngood enough growing up\num I can't think of anything in\nparticular\nsure can you tell me about what it was\nlike when your dad would come home drunk\nuh hi to my room it's like for the most\npart like if I was on the computer like\nI knew I would duck away before like\n10:30 and it aside to my room play my\nphone on something all hot a console cuz\nwe had a computer like family room\nbecause it was just uncomfortable being\nin the same room isn't basically like I\nwas I couldn't tolerate it like I would\njust hide away what made it difficult\nfor you to tolerate he was obviously\nthey weren't not themselves when they're\ndrunk like I I've always just like that\nlike they'll be a lot louder a lot I\nguess just him a particular was like a\nlot louder it was asking I don't know\nit's like a snare comfortable questions\nI don't really remember any in\nparticular but I just remember I was\nfeeling very uncomfortable if I was in\nthe room I guess mm-hmm but can't think\nof any super in particular ones I guess\nI'm trying to get a sense of so I mean\nI'm trying to understand what what it\nwas that made you uncomfortable like it\nmakes perfect sense to me that you were\nuncomfortable yeah because you know 14\nyear-olds tend to be uncomfortable\naround drunk people yeah what was it\nright so some people will be judgmental\nyeah I guess that's I guess it can be\nthings like that like he would like come\nin and just like it's just like a little\ncomment like they'd say oh just like a\nlittle comment like shouldn't you be in\nbed why you still playing the games you\nplay the games too much kind of thing I\nguess those kind of things would kind of\njust make me think I don't even want to\ntalk about this I'm just gonna go mm-hmm\nso let me ask you something Scott you\nknow when someone comments something\nlike that what how do you think that so\nif I have you know if I told my kid\nshouldn't you be doing this shouldn't\nyou be doing\nhow do you do that that that what\nemotions do you think that my kid would\nbe feeling if I ask those kinds of\nquestions it feels like you're not\nmatter I want to say like accepting them\nfrom what the they are role what they're\ndoing I guess sure would you say that it\nwould make them feel like they're not\ngood enough yeah yeah is that how your\ndad made you feel sometimes yeah like\nlike when I cuz he was like a big\nfootball player as well\nwell like loved he was like big into me\nplay football zone so like when I kind\nof stopped because set it overseas like\nbig day on Wow usually and like just fun\nto do stuff like with your school\nfriends play league with school friends\nand stuff like that so like when I\ndidn't want to go to like all the\ntrainings and like old matches he wasn't\nparticularly happy about that\nI don't remember like a specific\nargument or anything about it but I do\nremember like a bit of not\nsupportiveness\nthis little word but yeah yeah so I mean\nI like it when people use things that\nare not real words that actually gets\ncloser to an authentic oh yeah what that\ntells me is that you're feeling\nsomething that you don't have words to\ndescribe but you're trying to create\nwords to capture the feeling yeah so not\nsupportiveness so it sounds like there\nwere kind of two things one is so it\nsounds like your dad was pretty\njudgmental I'd say so yeah\nyeah and and generally speaking I think\none of the effects of being Chuck you\nknow judgemental is that you make people\nfeel like they're not good enough\nyeah does that make sense yeah is that\nis that closer to the way that you feel\nin terms of when you apply to a job like\nwe talked a little bit about bullying\nand persecutor yeah might feel the same\nit feels it feels a little more closer\nto like direct bolt-on\nI guess because it's like the two things\nkind of correlate with not being good\nenough Oh interesting so you're saying\nthat your dad the the flavor of the\nfeeling that your dad evoked is actually\nsimilar to bullying oh no it's more\nsimilar to denial of a job oh it's more\nso okay yeah I was\nbecause it sounds absolutely better that\nbad so have you watched our streams\nbefore yeah look pretty much all of them\nokay so do you know where to some scar\nis Ike I remember the descriptive word\nbut I kind of have it in my brain what's\nin your brain you I get all of them kind\nof mixed up sure like some Scott dama\nthings like that no problem description\nprisoner my best what am i digging for\nyou get the sense I'm digging a little\nbit I'm not sure I'm particular like\nwhat it is exactly that you're digging\nbefore okay I can tell you looking for\nsomething though yeah yeah so let me let\nme just be a little bit more transparent\nOh root of the problem sure yeah and\nwhat do you think about that do you\nthink there is a root I mean I'd say so\nit might be like a collective of things\nbut I'd say yeah what do you think is in\nthat collective being denied at multiple\nthings or like yeah not being was to it\nrejected there multiple things I guess\nthat have just led to a whole bunch of\ncovering myself hooked with like\ncatching myself up with like a bunch of\nlike games and stuff like that I guess\nsure is there any rejection that you\nfelt that is particularly painful I\ndon't really think so I don't think\nthere was like one in particular that\nlike you know broke everything yeah but\nI'm getting that sense as well yeah so\nyou know sometimes when when I talked to\npeople we find sort of like a root of a\nproblem and we're able to kind of like\nnotice that and evoke it and then\noftentimes they have a very like\nemotional response on the stream is that\nsomething that you're looking for hoping\nfor not really I also just want to\nunderstand sure I think so I don't what\nI'm getting the sense is that just like\nyou said I don't think you have one\nthing I think you've got\na lot of little things yeah and you know\nif we think a little bit about tanking\nversus healing I think you've got a\ncouple of things you just think about\nthis for a second so I think there are a\ncouple of things going on so the first\nis that gaming is sort of the board's\nabove the pit yeah right but the pit got\nthere somehow to begin with no so\ngenerally speaking I don't know how else\nto describe this but I'd say about 30 to\n40 percent of gamers who I've worked\nwith actually had an alcoholic problem\nalcoholic parent I don't know exactly\nhow that relates and I think it's I also\ndon't think I mean I don't\ndid your dad just suddenly develop a\ndrinking problem when he when you were\n14 yeah it's pretty much always like I\nremember like situations I family go to\nthe bar like when I was tough like that\nyeah so so I think something changes in\nterms of when you have a parent who's an\nalcoholic and the way that they relate\nto their children and something about\nthe way that they relate to their kids\nmakes children less confident and and\nnow I'm gonna sort of try to explain\nkind of academically yep so or let me\nactually ask you this how does a child\nbecome confident kind of a question I\nguess so don't answer theoretically just\nstart saying whatever comes to your mind\nyou're gonna you're gonna have a lot of\nwrong answers but I'm sure you know the\nright answer and we'll get you there I'd\nsay just like building confidence within\nlike success like if I was successful at\nschool I'd have more confidence like\nsure I think I like the phrase building\nyeah and and the interesting thing is I\ndon't think it just comes from success\nright so how does like so let me put it\nto you this way like in a weird way mmm\nyou think about how to ask this\nso how did you know to go to your room\nwhen your dad came home drunk because it\nwas an uncomfortable feeling that I\nwanted to avoid\nSharik and and in a sense you could say\nthat going to your room you could be\nconfident in that strategy does that\nmake sense yeah like it's a pretty\nreliable strategy yeah yeah how does how\ndoes one learn like what's there a\nreliable strategy how does one develop\nI'm not talking about like confidence\neven on the level of like oh I'm a\nconfident person I'm talking about\ngenerally speaking like the idea of\nconfidence right so what is confidence\nit's it's like taking an action and\nbeing somewhat like confident talkative\nthe result right like it's being sort of\nassured about the result so like where\ndoes that come from like how can you be\nconfident that going to your room is\nlike the right thing to do when your dad\ncomes home drunk I don't know if it\nreally applies to the whole culture room\nthing that I guess trial and error\nthere's like a good absolutely right so\nif we think about it what leads to\nbetter confidence like trying trying\nthings and then also like consistency of\noutcome yeah does that make sense like\nif you go to your room and then like he\nshows up every now and then and like\ndrags you downstairs and then what's\ngonna be your confidence about going to\nyour room is a solution lot lower so\nconfidence oddly enough for children\ncomes from order does that make sense it\nhas nothing to do with success of\nfailure it has to do with order so like\nright like a confident child like so you\nknow like a child becomes confident in\nwalking when they start to be able to\npredict the outcomes of their walking\nright does that make sense and they also\nlike have have confidence and parents\nbecause until they walk like if they\nknow if okay if I hold hands then I can\nbe confident that I walk because I'm\nunstable on my own but if I'm holding an\nadult's hand then I'll be able to walk\nfine so can we see how they become\nconfident in holding an adult's hand\nthen graduate all the time they become\nconfident and walking without kids yeah\nyeah so what do you think it does for\nthe order of a child's universe if they\nhave a parent\nthat drinks well there's no stability\nreally like they like it's two different\npeople right like he comes on one person\nis another person in the morning yeah\nabsolutely so what what does that do for\na child's confidence well they don't\nhave the consistency so they don't have\nthe same thing over and over again yeah\nScott do you ever get worried that\nyou're gonna fall into the sky when you\nstep outside of your room\nthat's out of your house that's like a\nmetaphor I guess no practically don't\nworry that you're just gonna fall into\nthe sky and shoot out into space\nI mean I've I guess I never had that\nfeeling yeah huh so it sounds like in\nyour world gravity always goes one\ndirection yeah I guess this is what I've\nbeen told yes I guess you're confident\nyou're very very confident in the\ndirection of gravity because it always\ngoes one right yeah so like what you're\ndescribing to me is that you get gravity\nthat goes both ways when you're a kid in\nterms of your parents right so you have\nyou have a dad that sometimes he's one\nperson\nso it's like gravity goes in this\ndirection and then other times gravity\ngoes in this direction right and like\ncan you imagine how anxiety-provoking it\nwould be if we did not know which\ndirection gravity went yeah do you if I\nif gravity sometimes went up and\nsometimes went down\nhow confidently do you think I would\nmove through life right why because it's\nnot consistency you don't know what's\ngonna happen yeah\nso when we think about you in an\nalcoholic parent like like tie things\ntogether for me what am I trying to say\noh that I don't like I don't have the\nconsistency I don't have that\nreliability I guess of him being but I\ndon't know if I'm not seeing the\nconnection though like I don't sure yeah\nyeah so the first thing is in terms of\nso if we think about a fear of rejection\nright right\nso like fear of rejection tends to be\ncan also be correlated with a lack of\nconfidence hmm does that make sense yeah\nlike the confident purse\ncan handle rejection better in fact the\nway that you talked about your job three\nweeks ago actually sounds relatively\nconfident right like people just say\nlike Oh someone else was better\nqualified than I was like it's no\npersonal insult to you you don't feel\nbad about it it's just the way of the\nworld\nyeah is that how you feel about your\nlast job application I guess so\nit's I don't know if it's just like numb\nto like the consistency of like being\ntold no or like not hearing anything or\nwhat it is but sure so it sounds like\nit's a little bit complicated a little\nbit in the eye towards it yeah so here's\nkind of the point that I'm making so\nfirst of all the hole comes from\nsomewhere so let's actually try to sort\nof give us give you a brief summary okay\nso if you're addicted to video games\nright by the way any questions so far\nwell I think I'm a fully pretty okay\nlook at them so I'm gonna try to\nsummarize okay so you're addicted to\nvideo games so the first thing to\nunderstand is that video games are not a\nproblem they're a solution what do you\nthink about that that's a make sense\nwhat makes sense about it the fact that\nthey're all like it's consistent like\nit's always pretty much always gonna be\nthere if you're not having a good day\nyou can go home and play games which\nmeans they're a solution like but at the\nsame time what do you think yeah sorry I\ndo think you can kind of get addicted to\na solution like if you have something\nthat's like really consistent and keeps\nyou happy I think we can still cling to\nthat feeling absolutely right so this is\nalso true of other addictions so like is\nheroin a problem absolutely is video get\nour video games a problem\nabsolutely is playing wow 22 hours a day\na problem absolutely and there also I\ndon't want you to think about it just as\nan addiction just as a negative thing\nbut I want you to realize that it is a\nsolution for your brain because it\nsolves a problem that you have is a\nproblem that you have is what play it\ntoo much I know that's so what what is\nit tank\nwhat is it tank for you I guess it takes\nrejection oh yeah yeah so it sounds like\nrejection and failure\nmain feelings of yours that it tanks\nfrom yep so now we kind of go to so the\nfirst thing that I just want everyone to\nunderstand is that gaming is adaptive\nand protective and is actually a\nsolution to another problem now that\nsolution can become maladaptive so\nmaladaptive is like when we do something\nand it sort of like works in the\nshort-term but over time it becomes\nmaladaptive so it starts to cause\nproblems even though it was adaptive it\nones that make sense yes I think rather\nthan solution or problem I like the\nphrase adaptive or maladaptive and the\nbest example of something that's that's\nmaladaptive that I like to use is so you\nknow what hypertension or high blood\npressure is yeah so do you have any idea\nso if I have a blood vessel in my heart\nis pumping and if I have high pressure\nin that blood vessel do you know what\nhas that what the heart has to do you\nhave any idea like how do you overcome\nlike if I have a high amount of\nresistance and I'm trying to push\nsomething into that resistance what do I\nhave to do really stress release oh yeah\nso releasing the resistance would be one\nthing the other thing is that you can\npush harder right so actually it's funny\nbecause that's one of the ways that high\nblood pressure medications work is they\nreduce the resistance but one thing that\nyou can actually do so like basically\nlike when you have a high pressure\nsystem so what happens to your for like\narteries and then if I in the job of the\nheart is to pump blood into the artery\nright and if I clamp down on the artery\nwhat is what does the heart have to do\npush through the clem exam so it has to\npush harder so the greater the\nresistance if I like if I'm lifting\nweights and I increase the resistance of\nthe weight what do I muscles have to do\nbuild up and push through it\nexactly and that is exactly what the\nheart does so the heart starts to grow\nwhen you have high blood pressure so the\nheart just like your biceps are triceps\nor pectorals or whatever like anytime a\nmuscle hits high resistance it grows it\nbuilds up and then the heart gets bigger\nand bigger and bigger as it deals with\nhigher and higher and higher pressure\nnow the interesting thing about the\nheart is that you know there's like\nthere's a bunch of muscle and you know\nthat\nart is filled with blood so the muscle\nneeds blood to nourish it right Jo so\nyou have these like three arteries that\ngo outside the heart and they feed sort\nof the outside of the heart and then\nyou've got blood on the inside of the\nheart so the blood from the inside kind\nof feeds the top half of the heart the\nblood from the outside feeds the bottom\nhalf of the heart and what do you think\nhappens if if the heart expands\neverything else expands or is there what\nhappens to the blood flow so like if I'm\ngetting blood from here and I'm getting\nblood from here what happens to the\nstuff in the middle not sure it doesn't\nget blood right because like there's\nblood coming from here and there's blood\ncoming from here and if I let me put it\nto you this way if I have you know if I\npour water on something like let's say a\npiece of like let's say a card a piece\nof cardboard if I sprinkle a little bit\nof water on top and I sprinkle a little\nbit of water on the bottom like the\nwhole cardboard is gonna get wet yeah\nokay if I increase the thickness of the\ncardboard ten times and I sprinkle a\nlittle bit of water on top sprinkle a\nlittle bit of water on bottom what\nhappens to the middle of the cardboard\ndoes it get wet still start stays right\nexactly so that's exactly what happens\nto the heart so as the heart grows so\nthe heart is trying to adapt to the high\npressure system by growing and then\neventually what happens is it grows so\nbig that it actually the heart can't get\nblood because there's blood coming from\nthe top and blood coming to the bottom\nbut the thing is so big the middle the\nheart corner quote stays dry just like\nyou said okay and if it stays dry that\nmeans it doesn't get nourishment and\nthat starts to die yeah and this is\nsomething called congestive heart\nfailure so in the same way sorry for\nthat you know medical analogy that I\ncompliment you to understand is that\ngaming for you was a short-term solution\nthat has now caused you to become a\ndifferent kind of person and that\nsolution is no longer working right but\nwhat you really need to understand is\nthat gaming really is a tank for you and\nwhat it's tanking in your case I think\nis some sense of good enough or like\nbeing sensitive to rejection a lack of\nconfidence in who you are so every\nrejection hurts so I want you to just\nthink about this for a second\nthat like you know if you're confident\nin who you are like let's say that I'm\ncontent to Who I am I ask a girl out and\nshe says no how does that affect me you\nmight lose some confidence yeah and if I\nhave no confidence and she says no how\ndoes that affect me I might Shetty\nthat's what happens every time you you\ndon't get a yes from a job I'd say\nshadows me a little bit but a built some\nresistance but yeah yeah right so you\nbuilt some resistance to it which is\nalso very good like it's good that you\nnotice that that too is sort of an\nadaptation and what is your resistance\nlet's just think about this for a second\nhow have you become resistant to\nshattering because you didn't say the\nfirst feeling will better you said yeah\nwhat is the nature of that resistance\nconsistency like cuz I mean I've been\ndoing it for a while now yep so it's\nlike yeah kind of\nI I would venture that you've learned\nhow to numb yourself from it yeah yes\nall right so that too is gonna be\nmaladaptive so I've asked you a lot of\nquestions I think it's it's a little bit\ndifficult for you to access your\nfeelings mm-hmm what would you say to\nthat that's that's pretty true yeah\nright so like what's up with that I\nthink it's because you've learned how to\nnumb yourself from rejection because my\nsense is that inside the trap door of\nyour subconscious there is a whole pile\nof like feeling like a shitty human\nbeing yeah yeah and where is that\nsensation throughout the day hiding\nbehind the bridge that is games\nabsolutely beautifully put right so that\ntoo is like when we try to do when I ask\nyou someone kind of these exploratory\nquestions like it's you know you're kind\nof like I'm getting shades of gray but\nI'm not getting a whole lot of color\nlike you were to say like okay how did\nyour dad make you feel like you say\nuncomfortable like we're you know that's\nyou know I I completely agree that he\nmade you feel uncomfortable but uncommon\nso we're sort of like a shallow term\nit's not like yeah you know do make\ndirect oh yeah so did he make you feel\nashamed did he make make you were you\nfrightened of him were you angry with\nhim they're all\nthose kinds of things that kind of fall\nunder uncomfortable yeah so kind of just\ngoing back to our analogy so like I\nthink gaming is adaptive right so it\ntanks so this is the the floorboards\nover the pit and then that pit comes\nfrom somewhere so in your case I'm not\nsure exactly where it comes from but so\nwe sort of hypothesized maybe it comes\nfrom bullying it sounds like it doesn't\ncome from bullying it sounds like the\nfeeling that is closer is actually the\nfeeling that like something around the\nway that your dad made you uncomfortable\nis that fair or not really I'd say in a\nway but I'm not really a hunter sensor\nwhich is sure so what are the yeah yeah\none of the way I think one of the\nprimary reasons that I really wanted to\ncome on here and talk to you was\npremature so I can get a bit more\nunderstanding off that so I can kind of\nat least get a little more knowledge on\nwhat it might be\nyeah yes so I think I'm not sure if it's\npartially your dad or other things and\nwe can give this another shot\nokay like I know we can continue talking\nafter at my summary but the first thing\nis that gaming isn't adaptive is\nadaptive and is actually a solution the\nsecond thing is that it protects you\nfrom the pit but the pit was dug\nsomewhere else we haven't quite been\nable to figure out sounds like it's not\nbullying maybe has something to do with\nyour dad maybe not and that ultimately\nyour solution is gonna be twofold one is\nto try to fill in the pit because if you\ncan deal with that underlying sense of\nrejection or that lack of confidence and\nthat to your lack of confidence may come\nfrom the disorder of your childhood\nright because like that kid like when\nyou just don't know like it's really\nhard to have let me just think about\nthis for a second like how difficult is\nit for a child who has like dr. Jekyll\nand mr. Hyde for a panic I'm not sure\nthe two people I'm sorry like you know\nlike who's who's another good example of\nsomeone who's got like yeah I'm trying\nto think of it because Clark can be\nSuperman is not really a good example\nbut\nwho's a good twitch at help me out hold\non I'm gonna to face your face also ID\nidaho yeah hope yeah I don't know Harvey\nDent to face huh you familiar with heart\noh yeah let's go to your face yeah what\nwhat T's Walter White ah nah man Walter\nWhite he just changed from good to bad\nit's not it's good so so my point is\nlike you know you don't know who you're\ngetting right so you're like it's it's\nreally confusing when you have a parent\nwho's loving and kind and supportive but\nthen like another day it's like gravity\nis going up or gravity's going down\nthat's just [ __ ] hard yeah so so I\nthink something about your lack of\nconfidence probably comes from that\nthat's a so yeah so something about the\nwhole comes from there and then the\nproblem is that as you mentioned earlier\nlike you know when you don't have\nconfidence and you get rejected it's\nshattering and then on top of that when\nI when you say like you know what does\nrejection do to you in your responses it\nshatters me a little bit like that's an\noxymoron if I've ever heard one yeah\neven that don't make sense because I\nthink another adaptive mechanism that\nyou have is you've learned how to numb\nyourself to the pain of being shattered\nbut I do think you'll get shattered with\nevery rejection hmm and so I think your\nway forward is twofold one is to\nunderstand that gaming is like is\ntanking and that at some point like what\nyou're gonna have to do is stop letting\nand you've got to understand that gaming\nis gonna be a very good solution but I\nthink you're actually doing a really\ngood job if you applied for a job three\nweeks ago that's actually really good\nand at some point you've got to\nunderstand that like you're gonna be\nshattered a little bit more and and not\nso much that you get used to the\nshattering because that you've already\ndone but I do think it's possible for\nyou to how can I say this not get\nshattered by a rejection through sort of\nintentional growth\nright so like instead of like numbing\nyourself to those feelings like really\nsitting with those feelings\nwalking through them and like letting\nthem kind of pass through you because\nright now I think what's going on is\neach rejection sort of like adds junk to\nyour inventory and you're not really\nlike ven during that junk and so\novertime like your subconscious is just\ncluttered with all this trash that is\nlike you know and what you really need\nto do is vendor your junk but I don't\nthink you do that because what you\nessentially do is you close the bag and\nthat's your numbness you just close your\ninventory you're like [ __ ] this is such\na mess and you just closed the inventory\nand then you keep on trying to live life\nand then you don't have any like room\nfor good [ __ ] in there because all the\nbad [ __ ] is filling up your subconscious\nsubconscious actually works but like\nthat by the way if it's filled with a\nbad [ __ ] there actually isn't room for\ngood [ __ ] good stuff yeah and and so I\nthink you've got to open up your bags\nand vendor some of that [ __ ] so some of\nthat can be through you know we can try\nto talk a little bit further after this\nif you feel like it we can you can see a\ntherapist or something like that have\nyou ever tried to see a therapist I have\nonce yeah but didn't okay so that's\nsomething worth kind of reconsidering\nthe other thing is is you know we have\nto try to fill in that pit so we have to\nfigure out like where did this lack of\nconfidence in this sensitivity to\nrejection come from I mean I think the\neczema honestly sounds like that would\nmake someone pretty [ __ ] sensitive or\nrejection you know to be like judged for\nlike your face and someone call you an\nalien because your eyes are probably\nlike that sounds like it's a pretty bad\n[ __ ] rejection yeah\nappreciating and and so it you know it\nstrikes me as a little bit odd that you\nfeel like the the feeling is actually\ndifferent but I'm gonna respect that I'm\ngonna assume you're right because I\nthink it if you feel like it's not the\nsame it's not the same you may have more\nthan one kind of rejection sensitive\nsensitivity one of them does feel to me\nit makes sense though because you said\none of them feels like a lot more\npersecutory and then the other one the\nother sort of like you know the job\napplication thing doesn't feel like it's\na personal insult it feels like you're a\ncog in the wheel and you're just getting\nrailroaded by the system yeah and so I\nwonder if\nyou've if you know there's been a time\nin your life where you felt like you got\nrailroaded by the system that possibly\nyeah I'd say it could be a thing or no\nI'd say it could be yeah yeah I mean so\nso what do you think about this kind of\nso one strategy is to like kind of\nchange a little bit like recognize that\ngaming is actually gonna be doing a lot\nof important stuff for your brain and to\ntry to catch those moments and to try to\nlike actually expose yourself to a\nlittle bit more negative emotion so\nthat's one option\nsecond option is you have to figure out\nwhether the source of this rejection\nsensitivity comes from and try to you\nknow cleanse that debuff right I'd say\nprobably just like expose myself to a\nlittle bit it's probably like a bit of a\nbetter bet for me I think okay so I\nthink that's something I'll try it's\njust yeah just scary what's scary about\nit\nwell expose myself to kind of like the\nnegativity and things like that yeah you\nwanna try that here like right like\nexplain oh yeah I mean do you want to\ntry it here yeah okay so close your eyes\nsit up straight okay we're gonna try it\na different way so when was the last\ntime that a rejection really hurt so it\nsounds like this last one wasn't that\nbad yeah this one that says around come\naround three months ago I got a job\ninterview and it felt like it went well\nand I said I was something like get in\ntouch with him and I mean I was quite\nexcited for the job like I thought it\nwas something that I could do they're\nsort of like helped me keep like healthy\nand on my feet and things like that and\nobviously I thought it went well\nlike the interview it was like really\nnice and things like that and I just\ndidn't hear anything and it was just a\nfact that like I didn't get a no that I\njust kind of like kept lingering and it\njust felt like as each day went past\nlike that's thinking just that got worse\nand worse and worse okay so do something\nthat was successful definitely in the\nchest like it's just\nthe feeling of thinking that something\nwas gonna start doing well and then it\nwasn't like you get on a high\ntemporarily and then you just like\ngradually feel this one consistently so\nso it kind of feels like you know an\nelevation followed by like a depression\nyou know like every disappointment yeah\ninteresting\nhave you had that feeling before like\nthat that kind of excitement in your\nchest followed by kind of like this\nthing yeah yeah yeah I've heard quite a\nbit can you tell me about a couple of\ntimes\none of the ones was like a test from\nschool okay so do you like drama and\nthings like that the girl like acting I\nthought I'd do well and I'm like it's\npretty much that kind of situations\nright like I kind of myself up for that\nand I did well and I didn't like\nmisguiding myself and then one of the\nsituation was pretty much similar to the\nlast job one where I thought I did\nreally well everyone ended up like I\nactually had got a call for that one and\nthought they were just gonna say let's\nstart on Tuesday whatever and they were\njust like they remember like like the\nshadow like the feeling of just like\nnothing pretty much like second like a\nquick sudden sink like like a movie is\nwhen they just like fall through water\nyeah\nfirst like that why are you I think um I\ndon't know I think it's a coping\nmechanism at have what are you feeling\nright now\num I don't think it's like embarrassment\nit's just it is a little bit\nuncomfortable like talking about this\nstuff but I think that's weird even so I\nwant to suffer I'm not really sure I\nthink it's kind of yeah I just focus so\ntell me what it feels like it just feels\nyeah quite shallow on my chest like\ncan't really tell where like the\nsurfaces I just cry feels I got a little\nbit empty okay I want you to just focus\nin on that feeling\nthe shallowness of your chest the\nemptiness of your chest\nand now what's happening to the feeling\nit's kind of soothing over a little bit\nyeah it's kind of interesting you can\neven see it you can see the change come\nover you try to feel it soothing over it\nwhat does that mean\nit's like um I got like a visual thing\nof like I'm that like soothing the\ncement of a bricks and they like\nbuilding so okay so you're kind of\nyou're kind of helping it out it's yeah\nyeah so let me ask you something is\nthere a particular time where you felt\nthat feeling of kind of shallowness or\nemptiness pretty profoundly\n[Music]\ncan't think of like any other like\nreally specific situations okay\nhow did you feel when your dad passed\naway um yeah my yeah definitely felt the\nbig sink like yeah it was kind of like a\nmixture of like panic and the shallow\nsinking feeling like being sent like the\nthud what what about what about that\nsituation what was it were their\nthoughts that came with the shallow\nsinking feeling in the thud yeah cuz cuz\nmy mom give another call back I'm just\nlike hear their distress and it just hit\nmy cone I really capture the feeling at\nthe moment but yeah just like a big sink\nso fell very frantic like I want to be\nthere but did you have I mean I think\nit's you know any parent passing away is\nvery very difficult is there something\nin the same flavor or color as what\nwe've been talking about with your dad\npassing away the I mean this the sinking\nfeeling of that is quite similar to when\nI got the phone call for the not getting\nthe job but obviously on a much grander\nscale sure of course and and well so did\nthat when your dad passed away did you\nfeel like I mean does that feel like I\nknow it's gonna sound like a weird work\nbut I'm asking you literally in your\nbody does it feel like a rejection yeah\nwhat do you think it was it that got\nrejected\nand the losing the opportunity to show\nthat I can do better mmm yes that's kind\nof interesting I mean oddly enough Scott\nI think that is the statement that\nyou've made that feels the most full\ncircle to me because I had kind of\nwritten down on my paper that there was\nfear of rejection and what you're really\nwanting to do is like make people proud\ndid you want to make your dad proud yeah\nwhy is he\nI'd said certain things I guess but as a\nwhole I probably could have done better\nbut yeah not sure do you feel like you\nscrewed up out of it yeah\nnow help me understand when you say a\nlittle bit does that actually mean\nfocus yeah because there could be other\nfeelings there right so so yeah because\nit's completely reasonable for you to\nthink that you didn't screw up that big\nbecause you know yeah who do you who do\nyou feel like you've let down primarily\nhim because like I know that I could\nhave done better and it's just not\nliving up to the potential that I like I\nthink I have inside me mm-hmm\nso now I'm gonna ask you a question\nScott when you get rejected I think that\nthere there there are two parts of you I\nthink there's a part of you that feels\nlike you have the potential to do great\nthings in a weird way and now I'm gonna\nbe a little bit Freudian okay so you\nhave to forgive me a little bit if this\nis just this would just be complete\n[ __ ] so I want I want you to imagine\nthat there are two versions of your dad\nright the one who's not drunk and the\none who's drunk and then each of those\nversions in turn creates two versions of\nyou yeah there's the dad who taught you\nhow to play football who played Final\nFantasy with you there's that guy and so\nthen there's also two Scott's there's\nthe Scott who's confident in himself and\nknows he has potential and then there's\nanother Scott who is kind of unsure\nabout what he's worth does that make\nsense yeah it does\nand then I think that what what maybe is\nvery scary for you is that you're not\nsure which of those Scott's is real and\nevery time you get rejected maybe it\nterrifies you a little bit that the one\nwho's a failure is actually\nthe real Scott yeah\nit's yes that's pretty accurate\nyeah so I'm gonna just I just want you\nto sit with that thought for a second\nokay I want you to try to how can I say\nthis do you know how those two Scots\nfeel different what their experience of\nthem is or their experience of you\nbecause sometimes you're one Scott and\nsometimes you're the other Scott yes\nbecause I mean I guess I have moments of\nlike confidence when I think I've done\nlike if I thought after the interviews\nfor example something like that mm-hmm\nso I guess that was that like an example\nof one Scott the other is the other\nmaybe or and I think what's what's\nreally scary is that you start to\nbelieve that you're the successful Scott\nand then life shows you that actually\nthat Scott is false and you're actually\na piece of [ __ ] yeah is that how it\nfeels yeah and I think that the sinking\nfeeling is probably the transition like\nthe noticing moment so your road forward\nso right now which Scott do you feel\nlike the piece of [ __ ] okay and is there\nwhat does that feel like\ndisappointing okay physically an\nemotional yeah physically how does it\nfeel\nI'm not good like I don't know how to\nexplain it physically I guess um it's\nsomething that you feel in a part of\nyour body or your entire body\npretty much the entire body I don't\nthink it resides in one place it it it's\npervasive right yeah I want you to\nbreathe into your body and then exhale\nso as you breathe in I want you to\nimagine vitality coming in and it's\nsuffusing you you can feel that breath\nthroughout your entire body and all of\nthe sense of disappointment and and\nfailure that / that has just fills up\nevery single cell in your body is\ngetting jostled by that vitality and as\nyou breathe out I want you to like\nsqueeze that negativity out of you like\nyou're twisting a wet rag you're\nbringing in so imagine that you're like\na rag that's full of dirty water and\nthen you add clean water to it with each\nbreath and then you wring it out so a\nlot of dirt leaves but there's still a\nlot of dirt that remains and so which\neat with each breath you're adding more\nclean water and with each cycle with\neach exhalation you're wringing out more\ndirt good now transition to the nose\nthe hard for us\ngood\nwhat are you feeling\ncleaner good\nso I want you to do three more breaths\nlike that and then let your breathing\nreturn to normal\ngood and now Scott I want you to listen\nso I want you to understand that\nsuccessful Scott and failure Scott are\nboth false that fundamentally you're not\ndirty water and you're not clean water\nthat's like successful Scott and failure\nScott what you actually are is the rack\nthat's the real you in in order for you\nto really move past this what you really\nneed to let go is not just the sense of\ndisappointment the sense of\ndisappointment is something that you buy\nyourself when you have the what\nconfluence or absolutely is bizarre as\nthat sounds right so this is the really\nreally tricky thing is that when you\nhave the expectation or hope or\nconfidence for success that's just\nthat's like the casting bar for the\nactual spell of disappointment you're\nbuilding it up with the confidence and\nthen when your spell cast finishes\nyou're gonna launch that fireball or\nfrost bolt or whatever right and so what\nyou really need to do is take a step\nback from both of those things\nand just try to be like so so take a\nsnapshot like how do you feel right now\num a lot more tranquil yes are you\nsuccessful right now I mean more so than\nI was like an hour ago\nokay I feel more like I understand the\nsituation a little more so I agree with\nyou that you understand the situation\nare you successful no good are you a\nfailure yes\na little bit a little bit okay but less\nso than before right yeah yeah you feel\nlike a failure in this moment yes okay\nso I want you to try to notice that that\nfeeling of failure is not actually you\nbut is something that fills your cells\ndoes that make sense\nit does yeah so it's like you still have\na bunch of crap that you need to vendor\nwe're not gonna cure you yet it's not\nlike you can just click one button and\nsell all your trash but I want you to\nnotice what has changed in you so you've\nyou've shed a little bit of failure but\nyou have not gained a little bit of\nsuccess does that make sense more for\nspace for success though sure but what I\nreally want you to notice is that so far\nyou have thought that when you reduce\nfailure success comes it's a seesaw\nright right but you're not actually any\nmore successful you've just stepped off\nof the seesaw a little bit so it has\nless up and down and and the more that\nyou can understand like the more you can\nbecome closer to what you are now and I\nsee that you know you still feel the\nfailure you're pretty profoundly so I\nthink you've got to do this kind of\npractice like this visualization of like\nwringing out the dirt that's relieved\nyou've got to do I think the better off\nyou're gonna feel right and when it\ncomes to applying for a job it sounds\nlike you apply for how many jobs per\nmonth mm-hmm two three yeah so I think\nthat this is where what you need you\nalso need to do is each one of those\nwhat happens is like you enter the cycle\nof success or failure with each job that\nyou apply to does that make it sup does\nthat make sense so actually what you\nneed to do is if you're gonna apply for\nthree jobs a month so be it but apply to\nthem all at the same time we're good\nwhat do you think that's gonna do it's\nI feel like it if it does it all at once\nit just I don't know what like the\nactual feeling would be but did you feel\na little more relieving I guess yeah why\nI don't know if it like gets it out of\nthe way or if I if I get the surge of\npositivity or what I hope it does for\nyou is it deep personalizes the process\nthis is the other really really really\nbig thing you need to do Scott you need\nto deep personalize this process of\nfinding a job right now your value as a\nhuman being is tied to a particular job\nwhat job outcome does that make sense\nyour value is a person that is\ndetermined by whether you get the job or\nyou don't get the job as you apply for\nmore jobs in a shorter period of time\nyou become uncoupled from the job\nprocess right so practically I think\nit'll be better for you to apply to more\njobs faster okay now tell me what's\nwhat's happening to the shallowness or\nemptiness in your chest how's that doing\nit feels pretty patched up or like\nsoothed over I guess okay\nnow good so I think you just did a\nlittle bit you just cast a you know a\nflash heal yeah you can open your eyes\nwhenever you're ready good I'm glad\nyou're feeling a little bit better and\nhe has been helpful not helpful yeah\nit's official\nyeah no official for sure why it gave me\nmore realization of make it's not a sale\nof the root of the problem but like the\nthe cause I guess like the the multiple\nthings and maybe identify those a bit\nbetter which is good because I think and\nI can learn from that identified that\nPatrick's for that's so Scott I think\nyou do a fabulous job of explaining when\nyou think you do a bad job that I have\nunderstand like the one I actually feel\nabout like success and things like that\nI feel like I need to just do things\nrather than think about the mom well I\nwant them of it yeah I feel like that's\none thing that like games have helped a\nlot with it's just it helps the ball\nwent out of it\nyes it helps you what like mellow it out\nsure yeah oh what's a hot yeah so so I\nthink that that's actually really good\nso I think when you say mellowed out so\nI think another way that I would\ndescribe that is like depersonalization\nyeah right yeah so so like we you need\nto like I was saying earlier remove\nyourself from the equation and much like\nyour questing and Wow like like when\nyou're when you're doing stranglethorn\nVale is that right we're doing\nstranglethorn Vale like do you do you\ntake one quest at a time and go out and\ndo it may I get multiple did I area it's\nmore efficient job-seeking process yeah\nyou're more efficient if I do the\nMilan's yeah absolutely right so this is\nthe last crazy thing I'll leave with you\nis I think you can actually learn a lot\nfrom video games I think that that a lot\nof the gamers that I work with when I\nactually help I feel like I'm sort of\nI've Unleashed them into some\nenvironments like I've set them up with\nthings like internships and things like\nthat in the past sometimes you have\nstartups and even at places like there's\na really good University in Boston\ncalled Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology and my favorite thing to do\nwith gamers that I work with in Boston\nis to set them up at MIT or in mi t--'s\nincubator which is like their\nentrepreneurship sort of thing so you'll\nget like PhD students at MIT and then if\nI stick a gamer who has no job\nexperience if I just drop them in one of\nthose internships they actually do a\nphenomenal job so I think a lot of\nthey're they're very analytical thinking\nand a lot of the way that they\nsolving stuff is actually very very\nhelpful the other interesting thing is\nthat there tend to be very very\ndedicated so I know you grind Wow for 18\nor 20 hours a day I've dropped people in\ninternships who will work for 20 hours a\nday and they absolutely love it and they\ndo a phenomenal job so I think that you\ncan absolutely learn things from world\nof warcraft you can learn how to be\nefficient you can learn how to you know\nyou can you can learn a lot and overall\nyou know Scott I really do wish you the\nbest of luck I'm kind of I'm satisfied\nwith where we are how do you feel as a\nsatisfied as a good word for it I feel\nya satisfied like I liked this\nexperiment solo you use the word a lot\nhelp me understand that\nI this will feel me like this will help\nme a lot like it with the whole I plan\nfor a lot at once makes a lot more sense\nwhen I visualize it in like a different\nlight which is one thing I always kind\nof had trouble with just like yeah yeah\nthat's it's yeah very very satisfying\ngood I'm glad so I think that one of the\nthings I'm noticing about you is I don't\nthink you have a whole lot of emotional\nexpression which I think has to do with\nsome of your numbness so it's you're\nsaying a lot but you look basically the\nsame as when I first saw you true\nso it's hard for me to gauge what your\nresponse has been without words because\nusually yes I think in some ways I think\nyou really are kind of emotionally like\npretty um yeah like pretty like your\nyour emotional like wave length is\nactually pretty flat right so like your\nemotion has been like this and and so\nit's useful I mean it's helpful for me\nto hear that this has been helpful and I\nyou know I really hope it has been\nhelpful you know keep us posted on how\nyou're doing and any questions before we\nwrap up for the day no think I'm pretty\ngood it was a raisin thank you so much\nyou're very welcome and good luck dude\nChes every door\nokay so emotions don't help you grind\nwow that's that's why you that's why you\nget rid of a man who needs emotions when\nyou're grinding Wow so let me ask you\nguys a quick question did y'all follow\nthat meditation I guess I should have oh\nyeah so people are asking did he have\nsome amount of alexithymia he had a ton\nof alexithymia\nokay\nso yes no kinda okay um let me just\nthink okay so let's just do a little bit\nof Nardi should be let's do some\nalternate nostril breathing okay so I\nshould have you're a sociopath how do\nyou gain empathy I'm not sure that\nyou're a sociopath I think just because\nyou have a lack of empathy or emotional\nnumbness doesn't mean you're a sociopath\nso not feeling things doesn't\nnecessarily\nthat's a symptom that's not a diagnosis\nright so diagnosis is sociopathy but\nthere are all kinds of other reasons why\nyou may not have empathy burnout\nalexithymia all kinds of things okay so\nNardi should be okay or nadi shodhana so\nthis is alternate nostril breathing so\nwe'll do this again so I want you guys\nto do this\nokay actually I I there's a good\nquestion here so I'm gonna expand on it\na little bit so someone asks can you\nexpand on the alcoholic parents and\ngaming addiction thing yeah so like so I\nstarting in 2015 I started working with\ngamers right so that was about five\nyears ago now one of the most surprising\nthings that I discovered was that like\nabout 30% of the gamers that I've worked\nwith over maybe like 200 or 300 or 400\nbe gamers that sounds kind of high\nprobably lower than that but of the ones\nthat I worked with individually which\nwas maybe like a hundred or two hundred\nI'd say like a third of whom had\nactually alcoholic parents or one parent\nwho was alcoholic and I was just very\nvery surprised because I had always\nthought of gaming addiction as like an\nindividual dopamine kind of thing like\nyou know it's about the dopamine in your\nbrain and stuff like that it really has\nnothing to do with you know having\nalcoholic parents so there are two or\nthree hypotheses one is that you know if\nyou're prone to addiction in your brain\nwhether it be alcohol or another\nsubstance may be the vulnerable the\nbiological vulnerability to alcohol in\nsome way translates to a biological\nvulnerability to video game addiction\nright so this some people say they have\na corner quote addictive personality I\ndon't really quite buy that sort of\nsense but I think it's complicated so\none option is that there's a biological\npredisposition that is genetically\ninherited to be addicted from one\nsubstance to be addicted to another\nsubstance now I don't really hold too\nmuch to that theory because what we do\nknow from genetic inherent your\ninheritance is that like being addicted\nto alcoholic so if you have a\npredisposition for alcoholism it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that you're gonna get\naddicted to heroin so like addiction is\nsubstance specific so you have\nalcoholism that runs in families and you\nhave like opiate addiction that runs in\nfamilies and that people also have a\nquarter unquote drug of choice so the\nquestion is why do people have a drug of\nchoice like biologically why is it that\nsome people get addicted to alcohol and\nsome people get addicted to opiates and\nsome people get addicted to marijuana\nsome people get addicted to math like\nwhy do people get addicted to differ\nthings why aren't substances like just\nmore or less addictive you know and so\nthe individuality it turns out is born\nin in neuroscience\nso are you forea like what which\nsubstance creates a sense of euphoria in\nour brain is actually like dependent on\nour biology so some people like our\nbrain sort of lights up like a Christmas\ntrees with some people with alcohol some\npeople with opiates some people with\nmarijuana some people with\nmethamphetamine some people with video\ngames some people with other things so\nthere is a biological component but that\nthey they seem to be specific to the\nsubstance so what I believe so that is\nkind of like a counter-argument to like\na genetic predisposition from alcohol to\nvideo game addiction what I think makes\na lot more sense there may be some\ncomponent fact there probably is but\nwhat I think is a lot more accurate is\nwhen I talk to people they actually have\nthis pattern quite commonly which is\nthat they just fundamentally are like\nnot confident in the person that they\nare and you can kind of like with many\npeople I'll sort of dig into things like\nbullying and stuff like that but like I\nmean everyone [ __ ] gets bullied come\non like most people get bullied and not\neveryone turns into a video game addict\nor at least not of this severity so the\nquestion is like why do you turn into a\nvideo game addict in my sense is that\nyou know the the you need a bigger tank\nfor like a bigger boss and the bigger\nyour pit is the more planks that you\nneed to cover it and so people who get\nvery very addicted to video games have\nactually like a bigger pit or they're\ndealing with like more and more\nuncertainty and if you think about it\nwhat is it what does the video game give\nyou it gives you certainty like WoW is\nthe why do [ __ ] people why do people\nplay Wow over and over and over and over\nagain it's because it's the same damn\nthing every single time there's no\nuncertainty so you can be confident in\nwhat happens with Wow\nbut that's the way the game is designed\nit's like you're great you can be\nconfident in what happens and so I think\nthat this issue of lack of confidence\nabout how the way the world works is\nvery common with gamers and so\nuncertainty becomes very very like\ndamaging to them and what do I mean by\nthat\nthere are a lot of people who like let\nme just give you an example of how\nuncertainty is completely unacceptable\nfor gamers if there's gamers will avoid\ndoing anything unless they're sure it's\ngoing to help them just think about this\nfor a second I'm not gonna apply to a\n[ __ ] job unless I know I'm gonna get\nit I'm not gonna apply to school unless\nI know I'm gonna get in I'm not gonna\nask someone out unless I know they say\nyes so just think about that you have an\naversion and most people are not like\nthat\nright like most people like basically\nunderstand that not everything is gonna\nwork out for you so the question is why\nare gamers so averse to uncertainty and\nI think it's because some of them grow\nup in an environment where like there's\nvery little order and so you learn how\nto like get really scared of like\ndisorder and you start gravitating\ntowards like order any place that you\ncan find it and what a video game really\ngives you is like order because in a\ngame you know what you're gonna get and\nthe thing that paralyzes gamers so much\nfrom moving forward is a lack a sense of\nuncertainty about what the outcome is so\nthey would rather\nyou\nsee this is what happens every time\nis this working okay so every time I say\nsomething profound either discord cuts\nout or twitch stop streaming or I knock\nout yeah so let me explain something to\nyou gamers would rather how can I say\nthey would how can I say this they would\nrather spend they would rather waste all\nof their hours how can I say this you're\ncompletely fine wasting time playing\nvideo games with a 0% chance of success\nyou'd rather do that then have a 50%\nchance of success and waste time doing\nsomething that like may not work out\nright like gamers are more comfortable\nwith a 0% chance of success than they\nare with like a 50% chance of success\nit's [ __ ] weird it's bizarre right\nyou would rather waste your time playing\nvideo games all day long rather than\nwaste your time on an application that\nmay not work out you would rather give\nyourself a 0% chance of success and\nwaste your life rather than do something\nthat may lead to success but you're not\ngonna choose that you [ __ ] hate it\nit's bizarre you think that human beings\nwould choose the thing that leads to the\ngreatest probabilistic chance of success\nwhich is that apply to a lot of things\nbut bizarrely that's not how we work\nwe're like no screw that if there's a\nchance it's not gonna work I'd rather\nnot do it at all and I'm gonna waste all\nmy time over here and said give me as\ngive me a hundred percent chance for\nzero success as opposed to a 50% chance\nfor 50% success that's what I'm trying\nto say it's a weird mathematical formula\nbut that's what I've observed right it's\nbizarre and I don't know where exactly\nthis comes from but I think it has\nsomething to do fundamentally with the\nway that we're wired and I think that\nhas something fundamentally to do with\nthe way that we're raised\nso we're taught to be like very very\nscared of disorder from a young age and\nif you think about what conf\nthe definition of confidence is being\nable to face uncertainty right that's\nwhat confidence is\ngamers are not interested in confidence\nthat you guys don't want confidence what\nyou want is guarantees and we sometimes\nwe conflate those two right we say that\nlike a guarantee like no guarantees and\nconfidence our opposite ends of the\nspectrum the more guarantees you have\nthe less confident you need to be and so\nlike this is really bizarre but you guys\nactually don't want confidence you don't\nlook for confidence you want a scenario\nwhere confidence is unnecessary that's\nwhat you look for and that's what\nparalyzes you because fundamentally\nthat's not possible\nnewsflash the world is full of\nuncertainty but here comes [ __ ] video\ngames and they come to your brain and\nthey're like hey brain you guys don't\nneed to deal with uncertainty you can\nget progress in accomplishment if you do\nthis you can come to me and you can play\nevery single day and you can get\nprogress progress and accomplishment and\npride in a sense of growth without\ndealing with any of that uncertainty and\nthen your brain is like well [ __ ] I'm\nnot going to deal with uncertainty like\nscrew that let me let me get everything\nthat I need with a guarantee like I'll\ntake the guarantee over the uncertainty\nany day of the week and that's that's\nwhat I think is going on so I think that\nwhat you guys really need to do is\nunderstand that like the life if you\nwant to move forward in life which you\nshould really do is embrace uncertainty\nthat uncertainty is like is how you get\nyou move forward so I think a lot of my\nmy success has been through actually\nchoosing the uncertain path over the\ncertain path it's walking away from\nopportunities not taking them so when I\nhave like a set job to you know be a\nclinician it at Harvard Medical School\nthey're gonna give me that job and it's\ngonna be a great job and then you walk\naway and if I if I hadn't walked away\nfrom that job I mean I'm still clinical\nfaculty so I still teach but if I hadn't\nwalked away from the job healthy gamer\nwould wouldn't exist today because I\nwouldn't have had time because I would\nhave been an employee with a boss\nso walking away from great opportunities\nand facing uncertainty I think is a\nwonderful way to move forward in life\nbut you've got to understand that like\nit's gonna be a [ __ ] show like I didn't\nknow that healthy game was gonna happen\nright so like you not you're not gonna\nknow and this is the other crazy thing\nis that you guys try to create so many\nexpectations about what you want your\nlife to be that you guys don't even\ngrasp that your brain does not even know\nwhat you're capable of think about that\nfor a second when you think about what\nyour future can hold you are such a poor\njudge for like what you're capable of\nbecause you have so little experience in\nthe real world and this is the big\nproblem is you guys all lent aim way too\nlow like I'm telling you guys I will\ntake a 26 year old who has never had a\njob in his life and I will drop him in\nan MIT startup and he will do phenomenal\nwith no work experience he'll just learn\nhe'll like he'll go on wiki and like\nhe'll go on Wikipedia and he'll like\nlearn how to code and he'll learn how to\nproblem solve and he'll learn Stata and\nstatistics because that's what you guys\ndo right like if you look at scott scott\nplays Wow for 20 hours a day he knows\nthe game in and out and and like if if\nyou guys get challenged and you stop\ncaring about like guarantees of success\nand you can just abandon all that crap\nand this is what I was telling Scott is\nlike in terms of the dirty water and the\nclean water you guys are so concerned\nabout success and failure you guys are\nneither of those things\nyou're the rag if you just abandoned the\nidea of success and failure and you just\ndo something it's the results have like\nalmost always been amazing I haven't I\nhaven't been just I've been I mean\npeople haven't some people haven't done\nwell but I haven't been disappointed in\nthem even if they don't do well so\nanyway it is difficult to find something\nyou actually enjoy doing though yes I\ncompletely agree it is difficult to find\nsomething that you actually enjoy the\nproblem is that most people don't their\nsearch for things that they enjoy\nhappens up here\ninstead of with their hands you guys\nwhen you think about when you find you\ndon't find what you enjoy you think\nabout what you may enjoy and you let\nthat control whether you act think about\nit for a second where do you make the\ndetermination about what you are going\nto enjoy do you make it up here or do\nyou make it in the outside world and how\ngood of a judge is this depending on\nwhat you're gonna enjoy think about it\nright so this is exactly what I'm saying\nyou guys in terms of the solution space\nthat you create for yourself it is so\nnarrow because you guys have no idea\nwhat you enjoy you have no clue because\nyou guys don't do anything you live in\nhere and that's not just a bad I mean\nlike in this case it's a bad thing but\nthis is what I'm telling you guys you\nguys have spent so much time living in\nhere that like we live in a world where\nlike this working really well is\nactually the most important part of your\nsuccess in the real world this and so if\nyou actually find yourself in a job that\nyou enjoy this [ __ ] is levelled up so\nmuch that you guys are gonna do an\namazing job because you've leveled this\nup the problem is this can't fix\neverything so you just need to level up\nyour like IRL skills a little bit and\nthen unleash that's really the best word\nthat I can think of I feel like I'm\nunleashing gamers into like certain\nareas it's like they're like a [ __ ]\ntornado and they just own it\none last story I'll share with you guys\nokay I was taking a class called\nvalue-based healthcare at Harvard\nBusiness School so this is a class where\nthere were a hundred or so physicians\nthroughout the Harvard Medical School\ntraining program who took a class so\nHarvard and E Harvard and E Harvard and\nE and I'm using that reason that this\nphrase for reason right at HBS so these\nare a bunch of [ __ ] try-hards who are\nvery accomplished and we had an\nassignment the assignment was optimize\npatient flow through a urology clinic so\nurology is is like the subspecialty of\nmedicine that deals with the genital\ntract and also like yeah\nthe euro general detract sorry not\ngeneral trying but you're a general so\nit's like you're in stuff like bladder\nurethra all that kind of stuff they also\ndeal with like a rectal dysfunction and\nstuff like that and so like they have\nsome procedures right so that sometimes\nthey have to like inject dyes and take\nx-rays and stuff like that so patients\nthat come to your all adji clinic and\nit's like kind of complicated it's not\nlike psychiatry will you come and you\njust talk to someone then you leave you\nhave to like get prepped by a nurse the\nthe doctor has to do a procedure\nsome people need procedures some people\ndon't need procedures some people need\nperhaps some people don't need prep so\nit's like a complicated situation where\nyou don't know what the patient's needs\nare so you don't know how many like how\nmany nurses do you need how many doctors\ndo you need how many rooms do you need\nhow many rooms with equipment do you\nneed how many like offices do you need\nwith four just consultations where you\ntalk about medications it's kind of\ncomplicated\nso that our task was to optimize\noptimize flow through urology clinic so\nI I log on to discord and I turn to a\ncouple of buddies of mine who are all\nmeet I'm like hey guys I have this task\nlike do you guys want to help me try to\nfigure this out I send them the case\nit's like a case study so they work on\nthe case and they come back with\nsolutions they're like oh you should do\nthis this and this this is what I think\nyou should migrate next day I go to\nclass or next week I go to class and\nthen you know the professor's like what\nare you so what do you guys think you\nshould do to optimize flow and then I\nhave my plagiarized answers from my\nbuddies on disk or I raised my hand and\nI say I think we should do this this and\nthis for us is like fantastic those are\nall wonderful ideas like I'm telling you\nguys crazy right so what gamers are good\nat is if you give you if you give them a\nsystem and you tell them to optimize the\nsystem they're good at that because\nthink about what you've changed what\nyou've trained yourself to do you\noptimize Wow\nyou optimize fortnight you optimize\nLeague of Legends you optimize dota you\noptimize Final Fantasy Tactics you\noptimize all kinds of stuff you guys are\ngreat at optimizing and all you have to\ndo is just like like go like do you guys\nrealize like how bad people aren't\noptimizing things in the real world like\npeople do stupid stuff all the time\nwhich it's just mind-numbing lead um and\nit feels my numbing lead um to me\nbecause I'm an optimizer like y'all you\nguys know what min maxing in D&D is like\nwe're good at min max you guys are good\nat min maxing you're gonna be good at\nlike other stuff in the real world too\nyou just need the social skills and you\nneed to like apply for the job\nto where people don't think you're an\n[ __ ] when you tell them that you're\ndoing something dumb and you can\nactually help a lot of people because\nmost people don't think like we do so\ngames train us to think in terms of\nefficiency most people do one side quest\nat a time they actually don't batch\nthey're side quests and do like a\ncircuit of stranglethorn Vail it's not\nhow they live life right and you have\nlike whole degrees and stuff that are\ndevoted to like fixing operations and\nlike streamlining operations and stuff\nlike that and I'm not saying that you\nguys are as good as formal education but\nyou'd be surprised so I took a guy that\nI was working with and hopefully he's\nnot watching but I told him that I\nwanted to do economic analysis on\neSports so I told him that I want to\npublish a paper about which eSports are\nthe most lucrative and which eSports are\nthe hardest to break into guys he's\nnever done anything like this before I\nshow him some data and I'm like hey like\nthis is how like do you know how to use\nExcel he's like sort of and I'm like oh\nokay like so this is what you do and\nthis is how you run the analysis here's\nhere's the analysis for one sport I want\nyou to take this and do nine other\neSports he's like okay and sure enough\nhe does a great job so don't\nunderestimate what you're capable of I\nmean you guys do but that's just because\nyou just don't you don't I mean of\ncourse you're gonna underestimate what\nyou're capable of because you have no\nexperience so your estimation is gonna\nsuck so go and get get yourself out\nthere try something and and just try\nsomething you'll be amazed at where\nyou're capable I mean you just [ __ ]\ntry the other thing is that like Scott's\napplying for one job every two weeks\nlike that's not how you get a job you\ngot to apply for like a hundred jobs\nover the course of three months that's\nhow you got a job and then the other\nproblem is like you guys are applying\nfor one job every two weeks so like the\nlikelihood that you're gonna get a job\nthat you enjoy is gonna be low because\nyou only have one option so you guys are\nconcerned I say you guys I mean it\nsounds like a [ __ ] boomer talking to\nyou yeah so just think about this for a\nsecond a lot of gamers feel like they\nneed to find a job you guys don't need\nto find a job finally job is dumb I\ndon't think you should find a job I\nthink you should find five jobs and then\nI think you should pick\nthe best one but that's not the way that\nyou think and that's not the way that\nyou act you guys are so concerned about\nfinding a job that you do them yourself\nto finding a shitty one\nyou should get five jobs you should\nincrease the number of places you apply\nby a hundred and then you should be\nselective about what you want you guys\nthink that life is not giving you\nanything so you're willing to take the\ntable scraps from your shitty efforts\nand instead like put forth some effort\nand then get something that you enjoy\ndoing it's actually doable it's not that\ncrazy\nbut that's just not how we think like\napply for weight like you guys get this\nyour problem is not you need a job your\nproblem is like you should get like 30\noffers of acceptance and then the other\nproblem that you guys make is when you\nget a job what do you stop doing you\nstop applying that's dumb that's just so\ndumb why would you stop applying for\njobs just because you have one you're\ncompletely missing the point you don't\nknow what you're gonna like two weeks\nfrom now sorry I mean I'm not it like\nI'm the same I was the same way so this\nis the way that I think now it's like\njust pause and think about this right so\nlike don't accept how can I say this\ndon't accept the walk through that the\nboomer generation has given you create\nyour own walk through because the walk\nthrough from the boomer generation which\nis they say hey kid you don't have a job\nyou need a job that walkthrough doesn't\nwork for us that's why the world is like\nthat's why everything is [ __ ] because\nthe Boomers gave us a walkthrough and\nthey're like this is how you be\nsuccessful in life that walkthrough\ndoesn't work anymore\nwe've got to come up with our own\nsolutions and our own solutions are\ngonna be different and we don't have to\nwork hard like their walkthrough is like\nwork hard and you'll be successful in\nlife that's a dumb\nthat's a dumb walk through don't do that\nI'm lazy\nyou guys are lazy that's fine like the\nsolution is not apply for one job get\none job and then work your ass up to\nmanage\nposition even though you don't like it\nwhat I'm saying is front-load your work\nso you can be a lazy [ __ ] down the\nroad find the job in IT where your\nbosses don't understand what you do\nwhere they don't understand like that\nyou can write a script to do your job\nfor you and you can sit there in the\nback and just like run your script to\nautomate things like people don't\nunderstand that you can run scripts to\ndo things they think that like the stuff\nhas to be done manually like data entry\nthat gets done manually right and then\nlike the cool thing about that is once\nyou realize like I want you guys to try\nto optimize and maximize your laziness\nall you guys sorry for saying all you\nguys all you guys are like oh I'm so\nlazy I'm so undisciplined like yeah so\ndon't try to change don't try to be\nsomething that you're not this is were\nthe Eastern philosophy or Eastern\nphilosophy me what you are Oh be present\naccept accept who you are Oh\nenlightenment Yoga Buddha Oh\nOh be where you are you guys need to\nreally listen to that for a second it's\nnot for yoga hippies it's for you what\nthat means is be lazy be lazy try to be\nthe laziest person that you can but make\nit work for you don't try to be don't\ndon't look don't do the boomer\nwalkthrough don't do the boomer\nwalkthrough don't work hard that's not\nthe way you become successful the way\nyou become successful is by adding value\nnot adding effort think about this for a\nsecond okay what is value how do we\ndefine value does anybody know what is\nthe mathematical definition of value how\ndo you define value no incorrect value\nequals value incorrect isn't value an\neffort the same absolutely incorrect\nvalue is the result it is it's on one\nside of the equal sign what is on the\nother side of the equal sign work\ndivided by time incorrect output minus\ninput sort of value equals time no no\nsee this is the basic problem yeah so so\none i'm see couple people get it effort\nover time sort of you guys are getting\ncloser I'll tell you so value equals\nyield divided by effort right high value\nthings give you a lot of stuff for a\nlittle investment that's the definition\nof value so like if we think about like\na high value pair of shoes gives me a\nlot of walked miles divided by the cost\nof the shoes just think about that for a\nsecond value so high value in health\ncare so there's like this value base to\nhealthcare delivery course that I was\ntelling you guys about what does have\nvalue in health care is like amount of\nsickness improved divided by cost of\ndelivering care do you guys get that so\nit's like yield divided by cost and so\nif you guys want to have high value what\nthat means is that your effort can be\nlow that's the goal so if you guys are\nlazy that's perfectly acceptable\noptimize that in fact all of health care\nin the u.s. right now is trying to\nbecome lazier they're trying to reduce\nthe cost or the effort that you put in\nand get more out of the like clinical\noutcomes that you receive does that make\nsense so be lazy just figure out how to\nmake laziness work don't try to not be\nlazy dumb sorry for calling guys dump\nbut it is dumb it's like dumb I was dumb\nI mean I'm still dumb probably like 10\nyears from now I'm gonna be sighs saying\nsomething else about how stupid I was\nbefore I was like oh I was so dumb like\nI was telling people to be lazy like how\n[ __ ] dumb is that so grow fine let's\nsay grow so I encourage you guys to\nchallenge yourself about\nthinking about like how can you be as\nlazy as possible this is your homework\nfor today okay and think about how many\njobs you need to apply to to maximize\nyour laziness think about that the more\njobs do you apply to does that increase\nyour capacity to be lazy over the next\nyear or decrease the capacity to be lazy\nover the next year right so think about\nit answer 0 fine effort zero values\ninfinity absolutely just be homeless no\ndon't just be homeless that's dumb I\nmean if you are homeless I that's\nunfortunate I'm not calling you stupid\nbut what I'm saying is that like just\nthink think a little bit about how\nyou're living your life and think about\nif you can live it differently because I\nstill maintain that most of change in\nlife I know this sounds crazy it's not\nthrough effort I mean it does it does\nrequire effort but it's not through work\nso I think the effort is actually up\nhere I think the effort is an increase\nin intentionality so I sketched out like\nanyway I'm gonna get off on another\nchannel tension I got to stop so I'm\nsorry that we don't have time for\nmeditation but I want you guys to just\nthink about what we've talked about\ntoday and try to think about how to\napply it to your own life like actually\nlike stop and reflect on it think about\nhow can you insert these principles into\nyour own life and whether they apply to\nyou or not and one of the biggest\nbiggest lessons that I learned is that I\nknow that we're all about\nprocrastinating and like not like\npushing back things but generally\nspeaking if you really want to be lazy\nin life the solution is to front-load\nyour work for an optimal like setup down\nthe road that's really what it's about\nall right so all these people who like\nbought alter act valley like they're\nthere they're doing it right like you\ncan do you don't think that you can\nbought real life like you can absolutely\nbought real life absolutely do things\nthat increase your efficiency and like\nmake it like a lot of people are working\nfor stuff and you can just automate it\nright so like this I mean we we've\nautomated a lot of stuff recently we're\ntrying to create workflows and you try\nto think about it that balance seems\nvery hard to find you\nvery right it is very hard to find so oh\nI forgot for a second if it's hard to do\nyou guys are just not gonna do it right\nhard and impossible can be the same to a\ngamer I'll leave you guys with that\nthought and take care of guys so we're\ngonna try to focus on this webinar a\ncouple of things so by the way a lot of\nthis stuff for those of you who have\nsupported us we are very very grateful\nso we're gonna try to turn some of that\ninto a webinar and yeah I think right\nnow we're I don't know exactly how the\ncost structure is gonna work I think\nwe're gonna try to make it free\nhopefully I don't shoot myself in the\nfoot for that we're gonna see if there's\nsome way that we can swing a suggested\ndonation or maybe how people just\nsupport us through patreon or something\nlike that we really don't want to charge\nfor it we may have to and if we do\ncharge for it it's gonna be like super\ncheap but it's just we're gonna have to\nfigure out what our investment is and\nand things like that but I think we're\ngetting a lot of support through streams\nso I'm really really grateful for that\nnor hope is to try to build this content\ndefinitely what's coming out is YouTube\nvideos on a lot of this stuff so I have\nthere's one I'll just share with you one\nguys one thing that I'm thinking about\noh yeah\nso here's here's I want to do a video\nabout this what's the difference between\nhalf-assing something and doing\nsomething good enough and what's the\ndifference between waste and sacrifice\nright so that's something that we're\ndoing a video about does that make sense\nI think about that for a second\nlots of answers lots and lots of answers\nso what's the difference between\nhalf-assing something and doing\nsomething good enough and what's the\ndifference between waste and sacrifice\nright so think about this stuff and then\nthe next question is is it important to\nunderstand what the difference between\nthese two things are that's even a more\nimportant question so these questions\nthat I asked like what's the value of me\nlike asking this stuff what do you think\ndo you think it'll change I mean I hope\nthat it'll change your life and I hope\nit'll change your life because you'll\nunderstand the difference between those\ntwo things and hopefully you'll do one\ninstead of the other and and like so my\nlife has been changed through like\nanswering questions like this like I\nreally want y'all to understand this my\nlife has not been changed through\nworking harder it's been changed through\nlike understanding concepts and systems\nthat's like a no-brainer right like if\nyou guys see you know if you see like\nspeed runs like someone who does a\nspeedrun doesn't work harder than\nsomeone who plays the game at a slow\npace what's the difference between a\nspeedrun and like a noob who plays the\ngame in fact the noob exerts a lot more\neffort right like what exactly\nproficiency optimization knowledge that\nis the difference and the funny thing is\nthat the speed runner actually beats the\ngame and a fraction of the time is the\nnoob and so just think about that\nknowledge is sufficient to actually\nchange your life for the better\nabsolutely you cannot teach experience I\ncompletely agree but I can ask you guys\nquestions and you can reflect on them\nand then you can gain understanding I\ncan't teach understanding either I can\ngive you information and that's part of\nthe reason that what I try to do is ask\nquestions and make statements that are\nprovocative from a thinking perspective\nas my goal here is not to teach you my\ngoal here is to make you think because I\ncan give you guys all the answers and\nit's not going to change you like the\ngoal is for you to think because that\nalso has to do with behavioral change\nand how the brain works and stuff like\nthat right I'm not asking you guys to\nmemorize multiplication tables I'm\nasking you guys to learn how to multiply\nand I can I can\ndemonstrate multiplication tables I\ncannot teach you how to multiply\nmultiplication is something you have to\nlearn and understand on your own\nright do you guys get that I can't\ntransmit the knowledge of multiplication\nto you as a concept that's the goal\nanyway thank you guys very much we'll\nsee you all on when Wednesday\n[Music]"
