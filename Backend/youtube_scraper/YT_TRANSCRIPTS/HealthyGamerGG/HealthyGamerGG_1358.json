    "transcript": "so what are we what are we calling you\ntoday buddy how am i how Michael Milo is\nmy name okay so Milo tell me a little\nbit about what we're talking about today\num well I am a huge fan of yours and I\njust wanted to bounce kind of my ego off\nof you and see if you have anything to\nsay pretty much as soon as I started\nlike as soon as you popped up in my\nrecommended videos on YouTube you just\neverything he was saying was really\nresonating with me and it's really\nsurreal that like it's coming to the\npoint where I'm actually talking with\nyou so I guess we can talk about\ncannabis addiction and how I'm dealing\nwith that that goes a lot in that's kind\nof wrapped up with a lot of my other\nvices and and kind of issues with\ndepression and and mental illness and\nsuch sure it's all kind of a big it's a\nbig [ __ ] tangled ball of yeah yeah\nI'm inside shits do yeah it really is\nman I'm so sorry that you know you're\nstruggling with a lot of stuff that's\nthe way I see it I mean I think you know\nif I can just monologue or soapbox for a\nsecond I like this is what I see right\nso and I think this is where psychiatry\nactually Falls a little bit short\nbecause what psychiatry does is it takes\na person like you and we give you like\nhalf a dozen diagnoses right we'll say\nthat you've got like a DD and you've got\nanxiety and depression and and cannabis\nuse disorder and and stuff like that but\nI think then you know the more I work\nwith people like I just don't think that\nthey've got like four separate disease\nprocesses random like it's like one it's\nlike one tangled ball of something and\nthen it kind of like likes like I almost\nthink that our psychic psychiatric\ndiagnoses are symptoms they're not\nactually like\ndiseases I mean not yet of all things\nbut some of them really are disease\nprocesses but yeah so I kind of echo\nwhat you're saying about it sort of\nbeing tangled together so let's try to\nuntangle it well the other thing is you\nsaid you wanted to bounce your ego off\nof me yeah\nwhat does that mean oh you cut out a\nlittle bit you hear me yeah I mean I\njust want to have like here's somebody\nelse's especially professionals take on\n[Music]\nthough hello can you hear me yeah can\nyou hear me yeah did the video cut out\nfor you nope I'm fine okay um I don't\nknow I mean like you know who I am who I\nthink I am was like just a persona okay\nand it would be interesting to hear\nsomebody else's kind of professional\nopinion on what I've got going on and\nI've heard you you know call a lot of\nother people out are on kind of [ __ ]\nand like devices like you go I see\ndevices of sort so do you think actually\ncan you hold on a second I'm just gonna\nshut a door I'll be right back\nsure\n[Music]\nit's like night and day when kids are\nback from the playground yeah so so okay\nso I see so it sounds like you maybe\nsuspect that your ego is pretty active\nyeah oh yes oh yeah so I'm gonna give\ntwitch chat and assignment\nokay so we're so one of the things that\nI want to think I want to try to teach\nyou guys is to be like present and pay\nattention to what you see in other\npeople and what you'd see in yourselves\nso I'm gonna point some of this stuff\nout to you Milo but just so that can\nkind of follow along I want you guys to\nkind of pay attention to when you think\nMilo's ego is speaking and when his ego\nis not speaking so a quick rundown so\nMilo since you use the word ego it\nsounds like you've been watching our\nstuff so what's your understanding of\nwhat ego is let's start there it's the\nthing that isn't your true self and it's\nyour you're kind of biologically and\nsocially cultivated organism that uses\nsurvival techniques to stay alive\nokay so what I want so I'm gonna give\nyou guys a couple of clues to notice\nwhen the ego is running Milo's mind okay\nand the first thing that we're gonna\nlook for is comparisons so when we\nanytime our mind compares us to someone\nelse that's usually a sign of ego I mean\nI say usually so you know if if if Milo\nsays something like oh other people are\nable to do this but I'm not able to do\nthis that's like a comparison so keep an\neye out for ego anytime the other thing\nthat the ego tends to do is pump\nourselves up and put other people down\nso I'm not really expecting this from\nyou but if you start to you know talk\nabout how other people are stupid or\nthings like that that's likely to be ego\ndoes that make sense\nmm-hmm okay so let's just kind of keep\ntrack and if you guys notice the ego\nis going on you know just mention it in\nchat why let's say you know steer clear\nof chat if you can during the duration\nof our our talk yeah I'm not watching\nyou know okay awesome so let's let's\nkind of dive right in\nso tell me a little bit I mean you want\nto start with cannabis or you mentioned\nother vices or like where how do we\nstart to untangle this ball of of the\nshits - well he started with video games\ndefinitely tell me about yeah so like a\nlot of people you talk to I was a user\nvideo games for a really really young\nage how young and probably like seven\nokay and what did you play the first\ngame that I haven't really really got\ninto was a game called dungeon siege\nwhich was like kind of a Diablo esque\ntop-down like action RPG thing and yeah\njust kind of evolved there I played a\nlot of Warcraft 3 throughout the years I\nstill play that one what do you think\nabout remastered it's pretty upsetting\nyeah pretty dead ok yeah what's up\nwell to be honest like I'm really not\nsuper concerned with Blizzard at all\nanymore just because of how they treated\nthe whole protests in China thing so\nit's shitty but I could be happy like\nnever hurt just again a blizzard product\nagain yeah yeah but I didn't get reforge\nbecause I honestly don't even think my\ncomputer could handle it is another\nthing because I have a really shitty\ncomputer but\njust heard that the servers were\ncrashing all the time and had just a\nmyriad of other issues yeah yeah\ndo you still game now yeah what do you\nplay\nWarcraft 3 I did work I thought they\nshut it down the old one you know it's\nlike um yeah it's it still works\nbasically Oh interesting okay what race\nSteve is just it's just like like a\nlimited it's the same game reforged in\nthe classic one mm-hmm\nyeah what race or races do you play like\nyou play like regular games where you\nplay custom maps mostly custom maps but\nwhen I am playing regular games I\nusually pick work you know Blademaster\nor TC awesome and I was a bigger than\ndead player under the sickest book yeah\nman I used to love going glitch first\nbut it wasn't very good I just wish I\nheard enough but yeah cool yeah and I\nplayed a lot of dota like back in the\nday like one or three but the og yeah\nthe original mm-hmm so cool so and and\nwhat are you how are you spending your\nmost of your time nowadays um well one\nthing that's always been a huge passion\nfor me has been music and this kind of\nso I've been kind of getting my [ __ ]\ntogether lately\nin a positive way um like as of maybe\nlike December or January 2020 and one\nthing that's come with that is a huge\nincrease in my time spent playing guitar\nand practicing music which has which has\nalways been like kind of sidelined by a\nvideo game addiction and cannabis usage\nas well sure which I helped me\nunderstand what changed in December\nJanuary why are you getting your ship to\nNo um I read this book called atomic\nhabits mm-hmm I don't remember who it's\nby\nbut don't ever write here and it just\nkind of talked about how willpower is\noverrated and and the real way to let\nyou talk it they broke down the science\nof building good habits and breaking bad\nhabits and why we naturally build bad\nhabits and and don't stick with good\nhabits yeah and I just kind of took the\nprinciples from that book and was able\nto establish a pretty consistent so I've\nbeen doing push-ups every day I've been\nmeditating every day Wow just about this\nthis year yeah and like I also I'm no\nlong I'm not a smoker anymore but that\nwas something that I stopped in about\nSeptember and I had like wanted to to no\nlonger be a can of a smoker for a long\ntime at that point I felt that it was\nbeing really destructive on my life\nhow so I felt like it was just kind of\nreally messing with my mental faculties\nin what way like have you heard the term\nthe brain fog yeah I fell just I felt\njust incredibly mentally slow and like\ndumber than I am and\nI I try to not like identify this\nidentify with this anymore but my\nintelligence has always been like a\nreally important part of my life you\nknow and I and I valued being smart or\nwhatever which i think is a school which\ni think is a silly arbitrary thing at\nthis point but but it was one of the few\nthings that I thought I really had going\nfor me in cannabis was just seriously\nmissing yeah so Milo you're making my\njob harder man you know why it's like\nI've noticed this trend recently like I\ndon't know if other people have noticed\nthis but like people are like doing\nbetter and and when we started streaming\nwe were getting absolute train wrecks\nmm-hmm\nand you talk about the shit's too but\nhere I'm talking about like so I thought\nwe were talking about cannabis addiction\nsounds like you stop smoking pot like\nsix months ago yeah right and and we're\ntalking about you're talking about\natomic habits you're talking about\npush-ups every day you're talking about\nplaying guitar which is awesome and I\nlove to continue supporting you it's\njust I'm noticing like a trend and I'm\nnot just sure if it's like a selection\nbias or what but it sounds like people\nare actually starting to make changes in\ntheir life and it sounds like you mean\npeople in your sphere like people that\nyou were talking to and people and stuff\nyeah mm-hmm\nwhat do you think about that I think\nmaybe you should take that as a sign\nthat you are making a huge impact in\npeople's lives I will I would love to\ntake that as a sign but it also sounds\nlike you started you your your journey\nstarted before I ever showed up right\nyeah certainly right so I'd love to take\ncredit for transforming your life but I\nthink actually at case-in-point for\neveryone who's watching\nI don't transform lives right so Milo's\nbeen working at it for a while and maybe\nwe can talk a little bit more and\nunderstand a little bit\nbut I I'm beginning to notice a slight\nshift in terms of I'd certainly like to\nhelp you I'm happy to but I think I'm\nnoticing that actually Milo you may be\nable to so it used to be that like you\nare the person getting healed and I was\nthe healer but I think you've leveled up\nlike you skilled up some healing skills\nyourself right like because you're\nalready and you can actually help people\nby telling us and sharing with us like\nwhat was different one year ago and like\nwhat's different today that I agree with\nthat and I would love to yeah to do that\nso so let's just kind of keep that in\nmind I think let's just take let's go\nback though and try to understand a\nlittle bit about more about cannabis but\nI just wanted to kind of point out that\nI think things are changing here you\nknow like yeah yeah I'm working on it\nyeah good for you dude so tell me a\nlittle bit about when you started using\npot um I think the first time was either\nthe summer of my freshman year of high\nschool or the summer before that I can't\nremember okay and it was like a lot of\npeople say they don't get high the first\ntime mm-hmm because if your cannabinoid\nreceptors aren't totally awake or\nsomething but that was not the case for\nme and it was a super excellent\nexperience I enjoyed it a lot\nand as I kind of slowly started to get\nmore into it I would do it maybe like\nonce a month my first couple years of\nhigh school and then I increased a\nlittle bit after high school and then\nafter I mean in my junior and senior\nyear and then after high school I really\nstarted ramping it up but during high\nschool I really saw it as a tool to kind\nof discover myself because at the time I\nwas really really\nexcuse me I was really wrapped up in\nanother popularity hierarchy sure and I\njust wanted to like hang out with the\ncool kids and I was so upset that you\nknow I wasn't like what are these kids\nhave that I don't that that makes them\nyou know cool popular and liked and we\nnot and smoking cannabis kind of helped\nme like understand that like I'm okay\nwith myself and it's okay to to be to be\nme and I don't need other people's\napproval basically and Wow that that\nhelped me kind of in like my senior year\nreally really how does can't just enjoy\nmyself I'm not worrying about that kind\nof thing how does cannabis help like\nfree you from those worries do you\nremember that um I think it just it made\nme super introspective and that\nintrospection brought a lot of insight\nand I had always until it started like\nreally [ __ ] up my life I had always\nreally thought that cannabis was a very\nuseful tool in that way and I still do\nthink like I think for people who don't\nhave like addictive tendencies I think\nit can be a very very it can be a tool\ndefinitely how do you know if you have\naddictive tendencies if if your\nconsumption of something is becomes\nproblematic and difficult to stop I\nwould say sure so would you say that you\nhad addictive tendencies in high school\nnot at all no I used it quite\ninfrequently and\nit was always nothing but positive\nduring that time yeah okay\nI'm just gonna try to organize things\nfor a second mm-hmm\nso Milan once again I'm kind of\nrecalibrating a little bit about what\nthis discussion is so a lot of times\nwhen people come here my primary goal is\nto help them and if we're talking about\ncannabis addiction and you haven't\nreally smoked for six months I'm sort of\nchanging a little bit about what we're\ntalking about right so I'm wondering if\nwhat would be better is actually four so\nI still want to help you we can kind of\ntalk more if there's something I mean is\nthere some kind of challenge or some\nissue that you have that I can help with\nwell the cannabis addiction I don't know\nif I said this earlier it completely\nintertwined with my video game addiction\nand just internet addiction and so on\n[Music]\nyeah and that's something that's like\nquitting six months ago and like still\nhaving a lot of the problems that I\nthought that I like attributed to\ncannabis consumption I realized that the\nbigger problem was video game addiction\nwhich was something that was a problem\nlong before I ever smoked for the first\ntime okay\nall right so we're gonna talk about that\nwe're gonna talk about the rest of the\nyou know ingredients of the shits do and\nthen what I'd like to do maybe a little\nbit more towards like let's say the end\nis Milo since you've kind of come a long\nway what I think could be useful is for\nus to use some of your experiences is\nkind of examples for broader principles\nthat are more applicable like more\nbroadly applicable so how can we\nunderstand\ngeneral things about identity and ego\nand like how cannabis interacts with\nthose for example you say that cannabis\nmade you more introspective when through\nthat introspective you gained insights\nand through those insights you became\nless concerned about popularity mm-hmm\nthe other interesting thing is I don't\nknow if people caught this or not but\nyou when you were describing your high\nschool experience that's an ego\nexperience because you asked yourself\nthe question why are those kids popular\nand I am yeah totally so that's an ego\npoint now the interesting thing is that\nyou attribute your growth in that way\nthrough the insight you gained from\ncannabis I don't think it was actually\nan insight that you gained from cannabis\nbecause I don't know if you guys have\nfigured this out or not you have a lot\nof insights when you're on cannabis but\nrarely does your life change from them\nright anyway your your what do you think\nwell I mean if I had an insight due to\nthe fact that I was on cannabis and it\nchanged my life which it did by making\nme give less of a [ __ ] about the\npopularity conflicts wouldn't that mean\nthat it was directly related to it would\nsuggest so but I think actually the\nimportant thing is not the insight you\nhad I think the important thing this is\nexactly what I'm talking about so I\nthink the important thing is that\ninstead of your mind focus on the\nfocusing on the external your mind began\nfocusing on the internal I don't think\nit was the insight that you had I think\nit was the introspection the act of\nintrospecting shifts what you're like\nyour mind is focusing on so I want you\nto think about your mind like a\nspotlight and when you're in high school\nand you're comparing yourself to other\npeople you're putting the spotlight on\nthem and how you're not like them and\nwhen you introspect you're putting the\nspotlight on yourself and the more that\nyou put the spotlight on yourself the\nless comparison naturally happens does\nthat make sense\nlike if I'm on an island and there's\nnothing for me to compare myself to\nit's very difficult for my ego to exist\nbecause my mind cannot externalize and\nmake comparisons so this is exactly my\npoint is that I think a lot of people\nbelieve that it's the insight from the\nintrospection but what I'm really\ncurious about and what I would encourage\nyou to explore is whether it is the\ninsight from introspection or it is the\nact of introspection in and of itself\nthat reduces ego because if we look at\nsomething like atomic habits I think the\nreason that you're able to change is not\nbecause you gain some information but\nonce again the the atomic habits book\nwas a trigger for you to introspect and\nyou may have gained some things through\nthat introspection but I think the key\nthing here if we look at the common\nelement between how you've changed from\natomic habits and how you've changed\nfrom cannabis you're gaining different\ninsights fine but the key element here\nis that your focus is on reflection and\nintrospection and that's where the money\nis that's my hypothesis that I'm putting\nforward you're entitled to agree or\ndisagree but I I partially agree I think\nthat the external factor of a book or a\ndrug or whatever can be something to\ndirect that spotlight and I definitely\nthink that there's the potential to to\njust look inwardly and change I think\nthat's kind of what like meditation\nleads to but I'm not sure if it's I\nthink it's like like a sprinkler versus\na pressure washer way towards ways\ndirecting your focus with like a book or\nsomething or some kind of frame of\nthought is more concentrated in a\npressure washer as opposed to just\nsitting with yourself and being\nintrospective and like allowing\nwhatever thoughts to arise I completely\nagree with you so I completely agree\nwith that you're saying that an external\ntool can really focus your introspection\nand allow you to gain greater insights\nthrough that focused in introspection\nthat's what you're saying right yeah if\nyou just sit there and you just kind of\nlike listen to your thoughts that's like\na sprinkler and you're not gonna get\nanything done I completely agree with\nyou the question still remains just\nbecause it allows you to focus your\nspotlight is it the drug itself or is it\nthe act of focusing internally which one\nis responsible so I agree that the drug\nallows you to focus internally more\neasily but then the question becomes if\nit's the focusing internally that's\nactually important can you train\nyourself can you take a sprinkler and\nturn it into a garden hose and then\nfurthermore can you cover a part of the\ngarden hose so you have a high-pressure\namount of water right can you actually\ntrain yourself to do what the drug does\nfor you I think with immense immense\nconcentration and dedication I\ncompletely agree with you there as well\nlike the thing that comes to mind is I\nthink it was with destiny you were\ntalking about the analogy with\npsychedelics of like taking a helicopter\nto the top of a mountain rushes you know\njust trekking up the whole mountain but\nit's the same thing either way no I I\nfeel like the same analogy applies here\nin terms of kind of one is without\nexternal stimulus and there's a much\nmore long-term slow-moving laborious\nprocess absolutely agree few hundred\nhours that man so just kind of kind of\ngoing back to your narrative or your\nstory so\nsounds like marijuana was actually quite\nhelpful for you in a lot of ways it was\na overwhelmingly positive experience you\nactually used it to free yourself a\nlittle bit from your ego it made high\nschool to be like a little bit more\ncomfortable because you were less bogged\ndown and like popularity and stuff when\ndid it become a problem I really started\nramping up after senior year of high\nschool started smoking on a weekly basis\nwhere before I was smoking you know\nmaybe on a monthly or even like a five\nmonthly basis mm-hmm and I also started\ntaking dabs which it's the so beer is to\nliquor as like flower bud cannabis is to\nDeb's\nso it's a concentrated THC oil that is\nincredibly like it will just [ __ ] your\n[ __ ] up it's super powerful what way\ndoes it [ __ ] your [ __ ] up so bud is like\nmaybe fifteen to twenty-five or thirty\npercent THC in like just throughout the\nnut that's the chemical percentage dads\ncan get up to like 80 percent 90 percent\n95 even like 99 or 100 percent THC so\nit's like super super potent and you're\nalso not getting any of the kind of\nnatural even though a lot of this has\nbeen kind of bred out in the cannabis\nindustry you're not getting a lot of the\nkind of CBD or some of the other\nchemicals that may be kind of balance\nbalance out the eye a little bit so\nI I don't know if this is what directly\nled to it but I had a I had a mental\nbreakdown what was diagnosed as a manic\nepisode in college and before that was\nhappening I was basically staying up all\nnight playing video games and just\ndabbing all day and doing not much else\nnot going to class at all did the people\nwho diagnosed you with the manic episode\nknow what was happening before that did\nyou tell like do they know that you were\nusing dabs very heavily I don't know\nokay I don't know yeah it could totally\nbe some some cannabis induced psychosis\nwhich is which is part of the reason\nthat I sometimes doubt my diagnosis yeah\nso Milo I'm gonna be very careful with\nwhat I say okay so when members of this\nconversation is to provide general\neducation and not diagnose or treat you\nwith any medical conditions so I'm gonna\nmake some general statements about\nDiagnostics in some of my experiences\nwith Miss diagnosis so if we see a manic\nepisode like let's say someone gets\nhospitalized with a manic episode we\ngive them a diagnosis of bipolar\ndisorder often times there are\nevidence-based treatments for bipolar\ndisorder that include medications and\nsometimes those medications can have\nanywhere from no too heavy side effects\nsometimes we are we oftentimes believe\nas providers that the side effects of\nthe medications are worth the benefit of\npreventing another manic episode mm-hmm\nthe really really important thing is\nthat sometimes manic episodes are not\ncaused by by bipolar disorder so bipolar\ndisorder is an\nillness which involves periods of\ndepression in periods of mania or\nhypomania\nso the periods of depression are\ncharacterized by weeks to months of\nfeeling super down having low energy\nhaving trouble getting out of bed things\nlike that the periods of hypomania or\nmania so let's start with hypomania are\ncharacterized by periods of time of high\nmental activity often times higher\nenergy often times reduced needs for\nsleep despite maintaining some\nrelatively high function interesting\nside point the the prevalence which\nmeans how common type to bipolar\ndisorders and type two bipolar disorder\nmeans hypomania so the amount of kids\nwho have hypomania at Harvard University\nis three times the national average what\ndo you think about that I think\nhypomania can be like very useful if you\nare living in a productive world\nmy uncle is bp2 and he uses his\nhypomania in his work and like in his\nkind of hobbies and in one of his\nhobbies is to create unmanned electric\nlike RC planes and he has like seven\nWorld Records for the fastest and the\nbest things in the world because he gets\nand there was hypomania and he'll just\ngrind yep so hypomania can feel\nwonderful unfortunately generally comes\nat a cost of depression afterward and\nand and so the reason I'm not giving you\nmedical advice but what I would\nencourage you to do I haven't asked you\nif you're on medications or if you're in\ntreatment or anything I actually I'm not\ninterested in learning that stuff\nbecause that becomes more of a medical\nrelationship but what I will tell you is\nthat if you are on medication or if you\nwere in treatment it is very important\nfor your providers and this is true of\neveryone is very important for your\nproviders to know whether you are on\nsubstances or not and to what extent you\nwere using substances because that can\nmuddy the diagnosis yeah anytime I have\na patient who has any kind of substance\nuse and depression\nI don't truly know if they have\ndepression or that's the substance\nthat's making them depressed you can't\nreally make a true clean diagnosis of\ndepression or bipolar disorder until you\nget a clean brain mm-hmm so I would\nencourage you to if you were still in\ntreatment to share with your providers\nthat detail because I think it's quite\nimportant and the reason for that is\nbecause I would hate for people to be on\nmedications that they don't need to be\non yeah well I they definitely knew I\nhad THC in my system like when I went to\nthe hospital so I'm not sure how and\nlike I went to like three different\nhospitals over the course of ten days\nand did outpatient treatment and\nshitbird inpatient treatment and a\nlittle bit of outpatient treatment I'm\nnot sure how like all of the information\npermeated throughout the entire yep\nprocessing throughout the entire medical\ncommunity so I guess I would assume that\nthere was some awareness yeah so what\nI'm doing yeah what I'm telling you is\nthat medical information getting passed\nbetween different institutions is\n[ __ ] like it's bad right so like like\nit's bad so if you if you are very lucky\nand you have a very thoughtful clinician\nwho is also not like overworked then\nthey may be had the time to look through\nthings but what I'm saying is that this\nis a danger of our medical system so\nonce something gets slapped into your\nchart like it takes a lot of effort for\nsomeone to like take you from scratch\nand not be influenced and like not do\nlike a thorough workup from the get-go\nso they just assume that providers in\nthe past made good judgements which may\nnot be like it's and it's not a bad\nassumption but you kind of get like what\nhappens to a lot of people especially\nwith mental health diagnoses because we\ncan't test for it right it's not like we\ncan do an x-ray and see if you're\nbipolar or not\nyeah and the other the other reason that\nmental help provider to that it's not\nnecessarily our fault because you know\nwe didn't see you when you were manic so\nwe just have to trust the person before\nthat they're not a dumbass and that they\nmade a right diagnosis and I don't even\nthink that they were necessarily a\ndumbass I think it can be like\npresumptive mania and they could have\nhad a question mark the problem is that\nwhen they send a bill to your insurance\ncompany because they want to get paid\nthey can't leave a question work because\nan insurance company is not going to pay\nfor anything if they have a plan work so\nthey have to label you with something in\norder to get compensated and that label\nsometimes carries forward and can\nactually negatively impact your care\nyeah so I would just encourage you if\nyou were still in treatment or enter\ntreatment in the future to you know\nshare this information share the extent\nof your substance use so that you give\nyour clinician an opportunity to really\nlike get to know the full picture and\ngive you like a diagnosis from scratch\nmm-hmm yeah okay sorry for that tangent\nit's just I think that's a really really\nimportant no that was helpful for people\nto know because I I think it's it's\nunfortunate that we just have a lot of\nyou know it's it's a mix of bad systems\nit's a mix of like insurance and like\nthe medical documentation is not\nactually geared towards providing\nclinical care like I don't know if you\nguys have ever seen your chart but it's\njust like this pile of auto-populated\ncopy pasted [ __ ] it's not about like\nthinking or clinical care it's all about\njustifying because insurance companies\nin order to get paid you have to like\ninclude all kinds of information that\nthey want you to include so that's what\nyou include and then while you're\nspending time including all that crap\nlike you don't have time to you know\nwrite a page about what you actually\nthink is going on to be put into a box\nyep and shake it's overlooked yep\nexactly so I think as as a patient it is\nvery important for you to take\nresponsibility and not assume that you\nknow your providers have gone through\nyour chart and things\nlike that like and you can be respectful\nabout it you shouldn't assume that they\nhaven't you can just ask like it and\nthese are things unfortunately that we\ndon't teach kids right like so a lot of\ntimes people get hospitalized like in\ntheir late teens or early 20s and no one\nhas taught you how to talk to a provider\nbecause you don't have what you don't\nhave any idea what the [ __ ] is going on\nyou get taken to a hospital people come\nin people come out they're the experts\nyou're like I don't know what to do it's\nvery hard to advocate for yourself\nbecause you don't even know what you're\nsupposed to be advocating for no one\nteaches you this stuff anyway I'm gonna\nget off my soapbox but you know take\ncare of yourself and all of you guys\nshould talk to your providers and if you\nhave concerns about your diagnosis like\nit's our job and we have ethical\nresponsibilities we have ethical duties\nto like not miss diagnose you and like\nconceptualize you from scratch we owe\nthat to you so you should ask for it if\nyou think that you've been labeled with\nsomething that isn't fair or you've been\nlabeled with half a dozen things by half\na dozen people chances are some of that\n[ __ ] is wrong yeah one thing though\nyeah this is so bad but like I get to be\non my own soapbox and complain about the\nstigma of mental illness now and also\nlike use it hypocritically at the same\ntime as like that crush and there's like\nan excuse for certain things let's talk\nabout that okay how do you use mental\nillness as a crutch well it's easy to\nexplain like it's easy to say oh I'm not\nan [ __ ]\nI just bipolar yep I have a mental\nillness you know what does that allow\nyou to do Milo it allows me to make\nexcuses for and not not do that crucial\nintrospection absolutely how does that\naffect your life\nI would assume it slows down the\nemotional and mental maturity maturation\nmm-hmm what do you think it does for you\nprofessionally academically well\nprofessionally and academically I'm\ngonna I'm in a bit of a rut or a pit\nright now so it's not doing much do you\nthink I don't I don't think it's\ndirectly related to to where I'm\ncurrently I think that has a lot to do\nwith just my cannabis addiction in my\nvideo game addiction and you're making\npoor decisions in college so what I'm\nhearing from that statement is that you\naccept responsibility for where you are\nprofessionally and academically based on\nyour addictive behaviors instead of\nusing bipolar as an excuse yeah is that\nfair to say\nyeah so yeah I'm not like oh I can't get\na job because of this diagnosis it's not\nlike that what have you used the\ndiagnosis is that crutch for can you\ngive us an example let's see like the\nmain thing that comes I I wouldn't use\nit for anything like seriously I don't\nknow drastic or dramatic like I said I\njust it's mostly the only times I've\nlike kind of like cheesed it was\nbeautiful word usage taste it thank you\nI have only cheesed it in like social\nsituations basically to like maybe like\nshut somebody up who's like using\nbipolar in a derogatory manner which it\nis sometimes used like people say like\noh I'm so bipolar I was happy yesterday\nand I'm sad\nhey inside a really good way to shut\nsomebody up like that I think them I\nthink the most I use it is as an excuse\ntowards myself and for myself like\nhaving this label you know it finds me\nand it limits me and all these things\nand and when you use it as an excuse for\nyourself what do you let yourself get\naway with not doing [ __ ]\nlike what for the most part hmm I don't\nknow maybe just not mentally pushing\nmyself or trying in in certain certain\ncircumstances it really so like the only\nexperience I've ever had that would lead\nme to kind of that would seem to\nsubstantiate the diagnosis was this one\nepisode which was super bad super\ntraumatic and a [ __ ] ton of depression\nfor the last like you know maybe eight\nor nine years okay pretty constant over\nthose eight or nine years or would\nfluctuate um it would it fluctuated in\nlike an upward trend upward being more\nmotion more depression so yeah\nprogressively got worse over eight or\nnine years yeah kind of as I started\nhaving more responsibility in life\nstarted doing generally worse in school\nstarted to feel lonelier and have less\nfriends yeah\nsand at a certain point along there like\nwhen were you diagnosed with Bipolar in\nthat eight or nine years stretch when\nfreshman year of college\nand the eight or nine-year stretch that\nyou're describing is from when to when\nI'm 23 now so like 14 or 15 okay\nto to now and like three years ago\nalmost three years ago I think was okay\nwas the episode what was I saying you\nwere just talking about how the\ndepression was getting worse and worse\ngradually yeah and and at some point in\nthat upward trend the cannabis smoking\nstopped becoming like this cool fun\nspiritual tool and started becoming like\na numbing agent analgesic is that the\nword that is the word okay yeah yeah by\nthe way before we let you go remind me\nto talk to you about intelligence about\nwhat Intel that has intelligence okay\nwell what were you numbing what were you\nusing to what was it what was it numbing\nI think kind of anxiety towards the\nfuture and anxiety about\nresponsibilities towards the future I\nhad and have a very fortunate upbringing\nand tons of opportunity to be a\nsuccessful person and I feel that I've\nsquandered a lot of that and that feels\nbad man so I don't like what what do you\nknown that what does that mean right so\nI understand that everyone who's\nwatching them understands that it feels\nbad and they know exactly what you're\ntalking about but let's work\nto it okay um I feel so I'm a really\nkind of philosophical person and I'm\nlike thinking really big and really deep\nand a lot of the times I feel like like\nevery decision made by all of my\nthousands of ancestors and your\nthousands of ancestors you know all the\ndecisions all the wars and everything\nfought has led to like this moment we\nare the latest addition we are like the\nyou know the newest model of human and\nwith that I feel comes a lot of\nresponsibility especially like I said\ncoming from you know a very financially\nstable background where I never had to\nworry about you know where the next meal\nwould come from or anything like that\nand yeah it just feels like squandering\nthat is squander like the opportunities\nthat have been cultivated and do you\nthink your opportunities that you've\nbeen given in life make your life easier\nor harder you cut out there I mean where\ndo you feel like the opportunities\nyou've been given in life make it easier\nor harder\num that's an interesting question\nlike like somebody who is who has to\nstruggle to survive every day is\nobviously gonna have a lot of difficulty\nbut they're gonna have like a mental\nfortitude that someone like myself is\nprobably not going to really have and I\nthink that's a very useful trait like\nlike there's there's kind of a downside\nto security because\nit makes you not really deeply\nsubconsciously concerned about a lot of\nlike survival aspects that a lot of\nother people are mm-hmm\nso we're gonna just dig into this a\nlittle bit more okay so so it sounds\nlike you view opportunities as\nadvantages that you've squandered you\ndon't view them as handicaps what do you\nmean right so like it sounds like you\nfeel somewhat ashamed or maybe guilty or\nsomething like that that you have all of\nthis privilege and that you haven't done\nsomething with it yeah so it sounds like\nyou view an opportunity as an advantage\n[Music]\nbecause we don't talk about it yeah I\nsuppose so\nright so until we had this discussion so\nif we if I say I've squandered an\nopportunity like that's clearly an\nadvantage it's like you know we're about\nto do some Game of Thrones spoilers here\nso if you guys want to mute yourselves\ngo for it\nbut one of the best things that I saw at\nthe end of if you seen Game Thrones yeah\nokay so if you one of the best the\nfunniest comments I heard was you know\nat the end of season seven when Daenerys\nhas three dragons we're about to see\nlike how Daenerys squanders a three\ndragon lead in a war right she's gonna\nthrow really really hard yeah so we\ndon't when we the word squander implies\nadvantage yeah so when you like beat\nyourself up for squandering your\nopportunities you're like oh I'm such a\n[ __ ] cuz all these people like they\ndon't even have like the opportunities\nthat I have whether they be financial\nwhether they be an uncle who's like\nactually motivated to like build cool\nstuff and like win contests it sounds\nlike you have people in your life it's\nnot just financial capital it may be\nsome amount of like family support or\nrole battles or things like that so you\nhave a lot of opportunities and then you\nblame yourself for not taking advantage\nof them right so therefore opportunities\nare advantages yeah duh\nnow the interesting thing is that when I\nasked you our opportunities advantages\nyou kind of changed your tune a little\nbit so what do I have to think about it\nyes that's the point right so I want you\nso like let's just let's just look at\nthat for a second when you say that\nstruggles lead to mental fortitude I\nthink that that's true but I think that\nit's not necessarily that they lead to\nmental fortitude I think struggles so\noperat when you have kind of like\nadvantages in life I think what they\nreally lead to is complacency yes and\nand so I think the interesting thing\nabout you know our people\nMilo which is like twitch at and gamers\nand Gen Z is that our people struggle\nwith motivation but if you have\nstruggles in life motivation\nyou don't need motivation because the\nworld is going to demand that you do\nsomething so we think about\nprocrastination like you know if you\nlook at it like if I have 10 days to\nwork on an assignment where I have one\nday to work on an assignment we view 10\ndays to work on an assignment as an\nadvantage as an opportunity you have so\nmuch time you can make such a good like\nyou can make such a good in-depth\nassignment you can do a wonderful job\nbut if we actually look at it the\nstruggle situation the person on the\nstruggle bus with just one day in some\nways that person's life is easier now\nI'm not saying that it's easier from an\nabsolute sense what I'm saying is that\nif we actually judge and look within\nourselves we're gonna discover some\nparadoxical stuff and that external\nmotivator external pressures are\ngenerally speaking what we need to\nsucceed and in a bizarre way if you're\ngiven opportunities and you have\nadvantages in a weird way like that's\nactually like more difficult because you\nhave to rely more on internal motivation\nas opposed to external motivation\nand external motivation is harder for\neasier is easier for our generation than\ninternal motivation mm-hmm what is that\nif we what do you think about all that\nyeah that resonates with me that seems\naccurate\nI think resonate motivation maybe\nshouldn't be the the goal or the like\noperating factor because motivation is\nsomething that is like fleeting\nI feel like internal motivation is\ndiscipline okay so we can more valuable\nyeah so okay I'm gonna do a video about\nwhat's motivation what's discipline and\nwhat's willpower okay and how do those\nthings affect our behavior but so what\ndoes this mean for your self judgment in\nterms of the like do you feel like\nyou've like so you view yourself as like\nhaving squandered opportunities right\nyeah opportunities are actually like\nthey may not actually are having\nadvantages you know so I just encourage\nyou to rethink that and for people who\nare watching also really rethink because\nother people look at your life and they\nsee oh he's so lucky\nmm-hm right and weak and and they kind\nof a part of it that's a big part of it\ntell me about that like that just adds\nto the kind of pressure you know of of\nfeeling responsible I guess you know\nlike if you're going to if you're gonna\nhave all this life in these\nopportunities then you should make\nsomething out of it mmm-hmm so let me\nask you something\nWow hello um so I want to talk to you a\nlittle bit about potential because what\nI'm hearing from here is potential I\nthink sense to you yes like Milo you've\ngot so much potential man you're a smart\nkid\nyou've got financial resources you have\nyou know it sounds like family that's\nsupportive you've got so much potential\nby the way don't forget you wanted to\ntalk about intelligence yep\nso that goes into this right cuz you're\nso smart Milo you have so much potential\nhave people told you that yeah how does\nthat feel\nI think it used to feel a lot different\nthan it does now how I did it used to\nfeel because I heard that when I was\nlittle yeah and maybe that's part of\nwhat led to like Carol coasting by and\nnot putting in the effort because it's\nlike oh I I have this advantage I don't\nneed to try as hard as elders you know\nhave you seen me smart so one of the\nfirst youtube videos that i uploaded was\nabout how intelligence leads to\navoidance have you watched that yes okay\nyeah if you guys haven't I think that's\nprobably the first video that really\nresonated with a lot of people and\nchanged the way that they kind of looked\nat themselves so I'd encourage you guys\nto check that out but let's kind of come\nback to you so you said that potential\nused to feel different so how did it\ngenerally feel to you when people told\nyou have so much potential I felt like I\nwas special mm-hmm and special in what\nway in that I had good things coming for\nme potential felt like an advantage or\npromise of the future or what um I guess\nI kind of looked at it like a promise\nand something that was just set in stone\nyou know and I wouldn't have to do [ __ ]\nabout who would just fall into my lap\nyep and looking at it that way is\nprobably what now makes you know after\nI've become disillusioned looking at it\nnow is what makes me kind of almost like\nreject that term and feel kind of weird\nand uncomfortable when when I hear it so\nlet's talk about that what do you mean\nby weird and uncomfortable when people\ntalk about your potential now what do\nyou feel a juxtaposition Zayn\nbetween like what could have been and\nwhat is like how does that make it by it\npretty disappointed sometimes kind of\nhopeless okay are you lagging am i\nlagging is it me\nhello did stream cut out folks\noh noes okay\nlet's see if he comes back all right\nare you guys is this useful can we just\ncheck in with y'all wait am i lagging or\nis it him lagging wait who who is\nlagging yes to both were all lagging\nokay [ __ ] oh we're back can you hear me\nyeah see you alright okay so alright so\nI was asking you cuz I'm I'm so have you\nseen the video on alexithymia we may not\nactually have one now that I think about\nit maybe in my head I know I've talked\nabout it I don't think so okay oh no no\nit's it's in a set of content that we\nhaven't uploaded yet so the other thing\nis I'm digging for your feelings because\nyou're giving me lots of cognitive\nanswers mm-hmm but how does potential\nfeel to you now what's the feeling you\nsaid a little bit disappointed and a\nlittle bit hopeless what are you\ndisappointed in my track record I guess\nyeah and and this is gonna sound kind of\nweird so I'm gonna try to make a couple\npoints Miley you gotta let me know if\nI'm being clear or not okay I'm gonna\nrely on Ben so the first thing is that\nyou said that xpect you used to have\nexpectations that you could coast and\nnow you are disillusioned mm-hmm first\nthing to understand is let's look at the\nword disillusioned so in order to be\ndisillusioned at some point you must\nhave been illusioned mm-hmm does that\nmake sense yeah right so illusion that I\ncould coast yeah so like disillusion is\nlike the loss of an expectation and and\nit's kind of like Minh interesting word\nbecause illusion implies that it's\nsomething false to begin with right and\nif we look at sort of your situation I\nthink that disillusioned is a great word\nbecause I think you had [ __ ]\nso we losing you okay there we go I\nthink you had a false expectation about\nwhat your life was gonna be like because\nit was fed oh [ __ ] okay\nyour videos like strobing yeah I don't\nknow anyway so I think you had kind of\nthis illusion of what your life was\ngonna be like that was based on false\nexpectation and so that's only going to\nlead to disappointment\nyou guys got understands I mean I've\ntalked about this a thousand times right\nlike if you if everyone tells you that a\nmovie is gonna be super awesome and then\nyou go and you watch it what's gonna\nhappen like how are you gonna enjoy the\nmovie like what do you think your\nexperience is gonna be diminished\nabsolutely there's to live up to those\nexpectations so when you describe eight\nto nine years of depression I don't know\nthat you actually have a biological\ndepression because that tends to be\nepisodic in nature what I hear from that\nis actually like a further and further\ndisillusionment about your life that's\nwhat I think has been going on that you\nstarted to have expectations about what\nyour life was gonna look like and it was\nkind of vague you just know it was gonna\nbe good and because Milo you're such a\nsmart boy oh he's such a smart boy you\nknow he's so clever and then life\nstarted to like get hard for you and you\nkind of didn't know how to handle that\nyou didn't have the mental fortitude\nbecause things were easy for you early\non yeah you became more and more\ndisillusioned in life became harder and\nharder and once again you were given all\nthese promises about how you're so smart\nand you have so much potential so now we\nget to the next point which is if I had\nif I gave you a blueprint for a Shack\nand I gave you a blueprint for a mansion\nwhich one has more potential\nI mean the the seemingly obvious answer\nis the mansion is I don't ask trick\nquestions man I'm not trying to trick\nanyone okay it's the mansion now here's\nthe next important question which one is\nharder to build the mansion absolutely\nso this is the biggest mistake that\npeople make about potential they think\nthat potential because potential is a\nmansion right that's what potential is\nlike that very definition is a blueprint\nof what you could be in life the biggest\nmistake that people make is that they\nthink that potential makes their life\neasy when in fact it makes your life\nhard potential is a burden it is a\nburden for greatness and it is a burden\nof success but it requires so much more\neffort than having low potential so if I\ntake someone who has cerebral palsy or\nDown syndrome or has had like a\nneurological injury if they add like\nhypoxia during childbirth which means\nthat they didn't get enough air to the\nbrain is something like that how much\npotential do I have do they have in the\ntraditional sense of the word probably\nnot very much exactly right so it's very\ngood that you said in the traditional\nsense so if we think about what they're\ncognitively capable of they can still\naccomplish great things because it's not\njust about your raw IQ but generally\nspeaking when we think about you know\nwhat someone is capable of and we think\nabout IQ is like you know the bar by\nwhich we measure and there are lots of\nother bars to measure things by and you\nknow we think of them as quote unquote\nlow potential and we think about smart\nquit kids as quote unquote high\npotential but I want you and everyone\nelse to understand this the higher your\npotential is the harder your road is or\nnot maybe harder isn't the right word\nmaybe longer your road is the more\nyou're going to have to invest in\nrealizing that potential right if I take\none acre of land and I say I'm gonna\nbuild a farm\nand I take a hundred acres of land and I\nsay I'm gonna build a farm one has way\nmore potential but the heart and the\nmore potential you have this is the\nmistake you made you thought that that\nmeans potential equals less work\nintelligence equals less work if you\nreally study it it means the exact\nopposite you have you have a great great\nburden on your shoulders Milo because I\nbelieve you you are capable of greatness\nI really do yeah but I think that that\nthought should not make your life easy I\nthink that thought should [ __ ]\nterrify you mm-hmm because the prospect\nof failure is like catastrophic that if\nyou have a hundred acres of land and\nthat you're supposed to build a farm\nwith that that if you [ __ ] up they're\ngoing to be a hundred times as many\npeople who go hungry then if you have\nlow potential mm-hmm that capability and\nresponsibility are one in the same this\nis the law of karma right to whom much\nis expected much is given much is\nexpected because that's the only way it\nworks it is silly to expect someone if\nyou have ten loaves of bread you can\nfeed ten people if you have one loaf of\nbread unless you're Jesus\nyou can only feed one person and so Milo\nif I had one kind of bit of advice for\nyou it's to re-examine how you view\nyourself re-examine what your\nopportunities are and re-examine your\nsense of disillusion and disillusionment\nor disappointment I need to I think\nyou've got to completely reformulate\nthis and think a little bit about\npotential as a burden think a little bit\nabout you know the reason that you\nfailed is not because and this also is\nkind of where ego comes in and what like\nyou compare yourself to other people and\npeople tell you that you're intelligent\nand all that kind of stuff is that in\norder for you to achieve you're looking\nat 100 acres of land and what you're\ndoing is you're saying I was unable to\ncultivate these 100 acres and you're\nsometimes kind of saying that it should\nbe just as easy as someone who has one\nacre of land some in some weird way I\ndon't know how else to\nplaying that but I think your mind is\nI'm actually making an unfair comparison\nI think that you should cut yourself\nsome slack because if you are smart and\nif you do have resources you know that's\nactually gonna require a lot more work\nfor you to like bring that to fruition\nmm-hmm and I think maybe the comparison\nthat you're making is you're saying that\nokay like cultivating one acre of land\nshould be easy if I have a hundred acres\nand so maybe you're making you're making\nsome weird comparison which I think at\nthe end of the day is unfair and I think\nwhat you should do is is really\nunderstand that like you're trying to\nbuild a mansion and if you have more\nresources that mansion is even bigger\nand let that sort of you know let that\nbe a struggle instead of an opportunity\nand the odd thing is that if it becomes\na struggle I think that that's going to\nlead to the mental fortitude that you're\ntalking about that's gonna lead to\nrealistic expectations of what you're\ncapable of and realistic expectations of\nhow far you need to go and hopefully\nit'll start to address your\ndisillusionment because the\ndisillusionment comes from the idea that\na hundred acres of land is is like\neasier to cultivate than one acre of\nland mm-hmm thoughts questions\nyeah that makes sense\nlike I think do a certain extent I don't\nknow like I don't you just cut out sorry\ncan you hear me yeah yeah I totally\nunderstand what you're saying about like\njust needing a shift in the way I view\nmyself sometimes I imagine if like like\nTerry Crews or somebody just like\npossessed me and entered my body like\nobviously my life would be a lot\ndifferent than it is now if they were to\njust start being me in my body so it's\nclearly just a matter of like mental\nexpectation and a certain level well\nwhere does that train of thought leave\nyou how do you feel about yourself when\nyou think about that like I mean this is\nsomething that I kind of intellectually\nunderstand but maybe something haven't\nreally embodied including a lot of what\nyou've been saying which is just that\nyou know a shift in perspective will can\nlead to a lot of hold on oh don't get\naway from my question how does it make\nyou feel about yourself when you think\nabout the Terry Crews inhabiting your\nbody Oh dad like like I'm not the same\nthing with like kind of squandering what\nI have you know that that same real\nhouse of like you know not not utilizing\nwhat I have and what\nI've been given yep so the hardest\nbattles that we fight are the ones that\nwe fight against ourselves mm-hmm and\nthe reason is because like we're always\nthe winner and we're always the loser\nyeah and I think you really need to\nrecalibrate how hard a mental shift is\nfixing something in the external world\nis way easier than fixing something in\nthe internal world and I don't think\nthat most people and are most of us\nright and I'm talking about twitch chat\nand and Gen Z or whatever we don't\nreally understand that or accept that we\ndon't accept we don't we do not\nacknowledge for ourselves that changing\nyourself is actually like really hard we\nthink that a mental shift because it\nsounds easy and it looks easy should be\neasy because we look at someone like\nTerry Crews and he makes it look so easy\nyeah and we look at ourselves and we say\nwe are not like him man it's so easy he\njust gets up every day like all you got\nto do is just do it I just need to get\nup every day mm-hmm right but it's hard\nand we don't we don't forgive ourselves\nand we don't practice any amount of self\ncompassion for failing to do what is\ndifficult we have a perception that it's\neasy but I'm telling you guys so just to\ngive you an example when I tried to\nbecome a monk at the age of 21 my\nteachers told me that I had to finish\nschool so they said we'd love to have\nyou but come back when you're 30 and I\nwas a little bit disappointed and they\nsaid you have to finish school and then\nyou have to go get a doctoral degree and\nthen I was kind of confused I was like\nwhat do I do I have to become like a\ndoctor of some kind so I had like two or\nthree mentors one of them was a\nneuroscientist trained at Cal Tech the\nother one was a quantum physicist and\nthese were my two spiritual teachers and\nI was like why do I need to get like\nthey're like you need to go get a PhD or\nMD or JD or something and then come back\nwhen you're 30 and I was like why\nand they said that anything that you do\nin the in the material world is gonna be\none-tenth as difficult as what you do in\nthe spiritual world any external\naccomplishment that you set your mind to\nis gonna be infinitely easier than any\ninternal accomplishment that you set\nyour mind to internal growth is actually\nthe most difficult thing that's why\nself-actualization is at the top of\nMaslow's hierarchy of needs it's the\nhardest to achieve it's not actually the\neasiest and we don't understand that so\nI set a goal to myself that I was gonna\nbecome the best physician I possibly\ncould and I set that goal not because I\nwanted to become the best possible\nphysic air about being a good physician\nI just realized unless I can become a\nreally really good physician I'm gonna\nfail at what my real goal is becoming a\nphysician is about is training for me\nit's not the end and I decided I wanted\nto become a monk and sure enough I did a\ngood job so you know ended up as a\nHarvard Andy and I will still tell you\nguys I know this is gonna be so hard to\nhear but I think accomplishing what I\ndid in the material world is still a\nfraction of the difficulty is like the\ninternal change that I had to accomplish\nright so when we look at someone who's\nmaterialistically successful we look at\nthat as hard but I want you guys to just\nthink about this for a second for Milo\nfor you to become a harvard-trained\nphysician is that gonna be what do you\nhave to change something on the outside\nworld or something on the inside world\nboth absolutely which one do you think\nis gonna be harder internal absolution\nbut do you treat yourself that way\nmaybe I mean because it's the it's the\ninternal kind of personality that I have\nthat gets the most [ __ ] from like my\nEgon stuff that's the one who's saying\nlike oh you've squandered these\nopportunities yep you know you're yeah\nyeah so you probably also have a some\nscar there which if we if we have a\nchance to talk again I think it's worth\nexploring where the origin of your\nyou're you're kind of complex around\nsquandering opportunity comes from\nmmm-hmm does that make sense yeah I\ndon't think that's that's not really you\nthat's like an emotional trauma that you\nhave that says Milos a [ __ ] who\nsquanders opportunities do you think\nthat's potentially from a past life ABS\npast life I have no idea that's why I'm\nsaying it requires a conversation for us\nto dig into yeah right but but I'm\nsensing within you like almost like in\nin the round table of your mind one of\nthe nights at the table is this complex\nof squandering opportunity yes that is a\nfunny image yeah so you've got like a\nbunch of Milo's who are trying to get\n[ __ ] done and then there's just one guy\nwho's just like [ __ ] you guys you\nsquandered all your opportunities and\nthen sometimes he just dominates the\ntable he's played by Danny DeVito\nabsolutely so good he's so physically\nsmall but fills up the room so so we're\nso profoundly yeah oh that's a good one\nyeah that's five had kind of stuff\nanyway thoughts questions are you\ntalking like wrap up questions or\nquestions of what we just how is he lost\nokay\nlet me first ask me where do you think\nwe are in terms of the you know this the\nconversation so look we're like do you\nfeel like you want to go for a while or\ndo you feel like we've kind of covered\nsome good stuff like where do you feel\nlike where are we between zero and and a\nhundred percent this has all been very\nuseful and nourishing for me mentally I\ncould totally stop here I do have a\ncouple things that I would like to\naddress and those could like potentially\nkeep us going for a while sure because\nthey're kind of very tangential to okay\nwhat we've been talking about so the\nfirst is about you you went to like an\nashram and you your Dharma right now is\nto just be an incredible position and to\ndo AoE healing for as many people as\npossible\ncorrect not really but sure so I don't\nthink that my Dharma is to be an\nincredible physician right so your\nDharma is not being about an incredible\nanything so first of all right so\nincredible has to do with the outcome\nit's not about action right so like like\nlet's just think about that for a second\nso my Dharma is simply to try to help I\nthink you guys more so than even be a\nphysician I think my my physician\ntraining has been has been training for\nthe final boss of my Dharma which is to\nhelp you all my autonomous impo it is to\nhelp you okay is there like is there\nsomething that that is building up to\nlike do you think you're gonna go at any\npoint and and go back to the ashram and\nand read about yourself yeah like is\nthere is there kind of\nmore of an endgame that you have yes so\nI think when my Dharma is complete then\nI will go back to the ash tree so my\nDharma being complete is gonna happen in\na couple of ways one is that if\nsomething catastrophic happens and I\nlose my wife and my two kids I'm gonna\nbecome a monk if I feel like you guys\nare doing okay or people arise who can\ndo the work that I am doing so that I\ndon't have to worry about doing it\nmyself then I could go in that direction\nI have multiple Donna's right so I have\nkids so I can't disappear because I'm\nresponsible for their upbringing and\nfinancial security and things like that\nI would love it if so in my heart of\nhearts I would love to go back to\nstudying and learning myself but I feel\nlike I don't have time for that so the\nother thing to understand is that when\nwe think about tottemo we think about\nfinding your tarma as if it's like one\nparma so the Dharma evolved over time\nmm-hmm so this is only my Dharma for now\nand for people who are looking for their\nDharma it's not like you have to find\nthe one thing that is your Dharma so\nwhat is your Dharma today\nwhat is your daughter my now so I think\nlike your and I think the majority of\nyou guys are in something called\nbrahmacari ashram so I gotta make a\nvideo about these which is that you guys\nare in the training phase you guys are\nin the learning phase because you're\nyou're not prepared to do [ __ ] like you\nguys have to understand that in order\nfor me to do this Dharma I had to train\nfor 15 years and during those 15 years\nlike I thought I was gonna be a lot of\nthings that I was not originally it was\na monk then it was a doctor and then\nbefore was a doctor was originally I was\ngonna be an oncologist and you know save\nlives and then I had to go through the\nstruggle of quote-unquote not being a\nreal doctor by being a psychiatrist\nbecause psychiatrists aren't real\ndoctors and I might you know had to deal\nwith ORS and things like that and then I\nwas gonna be a psychiatrist and now I\nrealized actually like psychiatrist is\nnot I mean that's just my background\nmm-hm but what I want to do is this yeah\nwell you're very good at it\nthank you\ndoes that answer your question\nyes it does\nquestion 2 I read this book about Kriya\nyoga okay and I wonder if you have any\nthoughts on specifically Kriya yoga what\nis your understand why don't we why\ndon't we start by explaining what Kriya\nYoga is so I am confuzzled about like a\nKorea is like a repetition okay that\nright\nsure so Korea has one root in the word\naction yes and and the the like it's\nkind of separate from hatha yoga hmm\nwhich is like the kind of westernized\nversion of yoga truth or the one that\nthe West is kind of adopted rather very\ngood good and like it seems to be\nprimarily about like it is very chakra\nfocused and very breath focused mm-hmm\nand it's been a difficult book to kind\nof digest there's a ton of like there's\na glossary in the back of all the like\nSanskrit words yeah and like half of the\nactual words in the book are in the\nglossary like half of the light weirdest\nyeah words so but I there's a there's a\nYouTube channel that I watch for\nspirituality a lot called actualize that\nboard and he talked about Kriya yoga as\nbeing kind of the like basically the\nmost direct no [ __ ] kind of\nenlighten\npath trip for yoga and that's something\nI'm very much attracted to is the\nconcept of spiritual enlightenment okay\nKundalini\nso let's okay so I don't know exactly\nwhat your question is but my guess is\nthat you just want general elucidation\nabout all of that yes right okay so so\nthis is good okay so what I'm making a\nlist of like videos I need to make so\nlet me try to answer your question let's\nstart with basics okay so Korea I think\nhas it's unscrew through tin the word\naction and really uh is the systematic\nprocess of refining and improving your\nconsciousness so we have this thing\ncalled consciousness and what is\nconsciousness so I I don't know how to\nput this but you know there are times in\nyour experience where you're able to\nwrap your head around an understanding\nright like you like it's like the light\nbulb going off or you fully understand\nsomething or you have this brilliant\nidea or you connect a couple of things\nand there are other times where you sort\nof like remember sort of what you\nunderstood but you don't quite\nunderstand it now does that make sense\nmm-hm and and so even today like you've\nsaid that intellectually you're\nbeginning to understand how maybe like\npotential is a burden instead of an\nadvantage and maybe you haven't really\nsquandered things and it's been hard for\nyou but your consciousness has not\nwrapped its head around that concept you\ncan understand it intellectually but you\ndon't sort of understand that like you\nuse the word is body yeah use the word\nembodied so you have an embodied to that\nconcept but you understand it\nintellectually so the first thing to\nunderstand is that consciousness is not\nthe intellect consciousness is that\nthing which allows you to embody that\nknowledge it's allowed it allowed a\nhigher state of consciousness allows you\nto quote-unquote get it\nif you think about how people change\npeople who get it start to change their\nbehavior and people who don't get it\nstart to not change their behavior or\ndon't change their behavior right when\nyou think about Terry Crews embodying\nyou and taking control of you what\nyou're essentially saying is that\nsomeone who gets it is gonna start\ntaking control of me and I don't get it\nso it's hard for me to change mm-hmm so\nthe hard thing about this whole process\nis that I can share with you guys\ninformation but I can't make you get it\nyou can lead a horse to water yeah you\ncan't make them drink so part of what I\ntry to do is like help people get it\nbecause that's where change comes from\nand sometimes what I basically try to do\nis cultivate like a certain kind of\nconsciousness and those are the\nquote-unquote breakthroughs that you\nguys see on stream right and everyone\nlike longs for that because when they\nlook at that they see like okay this\nsomething has changed in this person you\nguys can look at someone and you can say\nlike something has changed in this\nperson is that happen to you yet on\nstream today I mean I haven't had like a\nmystical experience like like that guy\nwho was the insel quote-unquote yeah\nthat was a [ __ ] wire broke down and\nhe was like sobbing and laughing at the\nsame time that was like very very\nbeautiful yeah so hasn't happened for\nyou right I think we'd all be able so\nit's not I've had this kind of like\nbuilding energy this whole time like it\nalmost feels like the sensation of like\nnervousness or excitement it's like it\nit's like a dispersed diffused version\nof that nothing of the so you were in\nthe process of coalescing right as it\nbuilds you're coalescing and\nconcentrating we're not there yet I\ndon't think we're gonna get there today\nwhich is fine so let's just first\nunderstand that this is what\nconsciousness is so Kriya yoga is in a\nsense it's a direct path because the\nfocus is not on something else the focus\nis on\nwhat are the practices that refine our\nconsciousness what are the practices\nthat enhance our consciousness that's\nwhat Kriya Yoga is about so in some ways\nit is a very direct path but I want you\nguys to understand that you know saying\none path of yoga is more direct than\nanother path of yoga isn't of itself a\ncomparison and therefore false there is\nno better path of yoga than they're just\ndifferent kinds of yoga just like there\nare different kinds of people it's kind\nof like saying which job is the best\nit's like there isn't a best job it\ndepends on the person so Kriya yoga is\njust kind of a systematic process of\nrefining one's consciousness and I think\nit is a relatively speaking a direct\npath it is also relatively speaking very\ndifficult yeah cuz you're directly\nengaging with the stuff it's kind of\nlike you know it there's a certain\npurity of it which makes it more potent\nbut that purity also makes it more\ndifficult like you can't it's kind of\nlike saying you know rock climbing is a\nmore direct workout than climbing stairs\nlike you're gonna like you're gonna get\nmore in shape by rock climbing than you\nwill by climbing stairs yeah but it's\nalso way [ __ ] harder to do and it\ndoesn't mean that it's actually the best\npath because climbing stairs is like\npretty doable and we can start low and\ngo slow and you can kind of get there in\nthe end\nyeah so is rock climbing better or is\nusing a stair stepper like better\nthere's just two different exactly so is\none more correct yes but it also means\nthat it's more difficult yeah so let's\ntalk for a second about hatha yoga so\nHut or Hut is translated the Sun script\nword for adamantite right so like it\nyeah right so Hut is is about severity\nHut is about directness\nit's about steadiness and it's kind of\nlike physical so hearty Yoga is also\npretty badass\nHachi Yoga is the idea that you can just\nuse your [ __ ] body to get enlightened\nall this [ __ ] consciousness [ __ ]\nand this thinking and contemplation and\nenlightenment and coalescing of energies\nand chakras and OH\nand be in touch with yourself in\nessential oils hotter yoga's like [ __ ]\nthat we are gonna train your body until\nyou become enlightened and that's enough\njust body body body body body the reason\nthat it's expanded so easily in the West\nis because Kriya Yoga is hard to do and\nwe are so spiritually starved is a\npopulation that hot to yoga gives us\nlike it's a very easy sequence of things\nthat you can start doing that helps\npeople like feel better in weird ways\nthat they don't even understand so hot\nyoga is very accessible I don't think of\nit as inferior I used to but I've come\nto realize that that's just [ __ ]\narrogance and ego and that there is a 26\nyear old woman named Stephanie who is\njust as likely at becoming enlightened\nby going to a yoga studio five days a\nweek as I am despite all of my extensive\nhardcore going to India [ __ ] right she\ncan just do yoga and not understand what\nthe [ __ ] she's doing she can still get\nenlightened not any better or worse than\nI am\nso hot yoga is good because it's\naccessible it's easy you don't have to\nyou know and it you can still go\nhardcore because like that's where all\nthe human pretzel stuff comes in right\nso to do the Basia for an hour I'll show\nyou guys a particular posture like\ntowards the end of stream right which\nyou guys can try that's gonna be our\nmeditative practice for the day so you\nguys can try to do the traditional\ntapasya which means penance posture\nwhich is a yoga posture or meditative\nposture which has to do with the\naccumulation of spiritual energy teach\nyou a relatively direct version of that\nokay so that's what hatha yoga is so you\nunderstand what Kriya Yoga is and what\nhatha yoga is yeah any questions about\nthat so far\num I I don't I think it was you who said\nthis in a previous video or stream but\nyou said that Yoga is like preparation\nfor meditation does that sound familiar\nyep so what that so yoga does not\nactually mean yeah so Yoga is not what\nis not Hutta yoga right so a Sun which\nis postures physical postures so when\nyou go to a yoga studio you're not doing\nyoga what you're\ndoing is a senora sauna mm-hmm we just\ntranslate that as yoga but that's not\nreally what yoga is the root word of\nyoga's video what is yoga the root word\nof yoga is huge which means union or\nyoke so this is kind of what I love\nabout Sun script is like you know a lot\nof the stuff a lot of realizations are\nkind of paradoxical like when you really\nunderstand something it's sort of\nparadoxical yeah like potential is not\nreally an advantage it's a burden which\nis kind of paradoxical and I think the\ncloser that you get to truly\nunderstanding something the more\nparadoxical it kind of becomes even\nthough you understand it so what is yoga\nso yoga is who comes from the Sanskrit\nword huge which means union or yoke and\nthat's kind of weird because yoke is not\ny ou LK it's y ou ke do you know what a\nyoke is like a yoke that pulls a wagon\nor exactly exactly so it's y ou ke like\nso a yoke is something that binds the\nwagon to like the cow or the buffalo or\nthe bull or the horse right it's yoked\nit's bound so yoga is and it also means\nUnion which is sort of bound or unbound\nany what what that means is is that Yoga\nis the process of becoming one with the\ninfinite so there's this idea and yoga\nthat we have an individual soul and that\nthe individual soul is a piece of\nsomething called Barham admin which is\nthe universal soul so that the basic\nunit of existence is consciousness and\nthat we sort of separate from the cosmic\nconsciousness to become an individual\nunit of consciousness which is like a\nself and the goal of yoga is to rejoin\nwith like a droplet that gets pulled out\nof the ocean\n- like rejoin with the ocean you know if\nwe kind of think about it like when a\ndroplet separates so are there droplets\nin the ocean yeah really I I mean\nI guess a droplet is defined by by its\ndistinction it's barriers excellent\nright yeah so that is a moment of\nconsciousness right so you repeat it and\nthen you stopped and you thought and\nyou've learned something so the droplet\nonly exists outside of the ocean and\nwhen a droplet goes back into the ocean\nwhat happens to the droplet non-duality\nwhat does that mean speak plainly it is\nreabsorbed into itself which is its\nnatural form yes so if I pull a droplet\nout of the ocean again is it the same as\nthe droplet before no is it different\nfrom the droplet before the individual\nmolecules possibly are possibly right so\nthe short answer is possibly so what is\nthe relation between two droplets maybe\nthere's something the same maybe there's\nsomething different so this is what they\nmean by Atman and Paramatma\nso you were an individual person and\nyou've kind of separated from something\nand yoga is the process of rejoining\nthat thing that's the true self okay and\nthat's why I like in any way hard to\nunderstand this stuff you really have to\nexperience it so yoga is the process of\nrejoining that thing that's what it\nmeans by Union and at the same time it\nis also the process of unyoke injure\nself so it's the process of B becoming\nunbound to this person that you are in\nthis life so when we think about the\nidentity and the ego generally speaking\nwe become happier as we become unbound\nfrom ourselves when you get caught up in\nbeing popular in high school you're very\nbound to your identity you're trapped by\nit and it [ __ ] sucks\nas you become unbound from your identity\nor your ego you start to chill out and\nyou start to enjoy things more so Yoga\nis the process of becoming unbound and\nat the same time becoming joined with\nsomething else\nso it's kind of like binding and bun\nunbinding at the same time mm-hmm okay\nso there are many paths to get to Yoga\nKriya Yoga is one hot - Yoga is another\nand you just have to figure out what's\nkind of right for you mm-hmm now chakras\ninvolve more Kundalini Yoga so Kundalini\nYoga is sort of the the path of so you\ncan think about it this way there are a\nthousand like how how many ways are\nthere for a droplet to get back in the\nocean basically right so you can become\nrain you can become river you can become\nmist you can you know there are all\nkinds of ways you can be carried people\ncan dump you in the ocean there are a\nlot of different ways to rejoin and\nthat's what the different paths of yoga\nis reine better than the river no it's a\ndumb question different yeah it's like\njust it doesn't even compute right so is\nKriya yoga better than hot yoga not\nnecessarily it's just you have to figure\nout what it is it sounds to me like\nyou're not ready for Kriya yoga yet so\nKriya Yoga is an advanced practice and I\nwould say that people should start with\nbasic practices even if you guys want to\nget to the hardcore [ __ ] which I'm with\nyou a hundred percent because I love the\nhardcore [ __ ] I have in like I mean now\nless so but for a long time I had kind\nof this ego thing where I want to do\nlike hardcore spirituality and go to an\nashram instead of go to a yoga studio\nwhere like Stephanie and Michelle are\ndoing their Osun and then getting like\ntheir bleach blonde hair dye hair right\nyeah that's like part of the paradox\nisn't it yeah all of it is the entire\npursuit is ego even the pursuit of like\nyou know removing your ego and yes\nreturning - yes\nso so I would say that for you Milo\nyou're your biggest step is actually\nprobably going to a humdrum yoga class\ngo into what you could humdrum yoga\nclass okay right so I think you need to\ngo there you need to do those practices\nnot only will it help you but you'll\nhave to grapple with your ego and you'll\nhave to admit that you have to go the\nslow route just the same as everyone\nelse instead of ordering that secret\npower book\nthe secret power that like that will\naccelerate a [ __ ] no man I'm all for\nforbidden knowledge and all that good\nstuff I love that kind of stuff but you\nknow just start low and go slow and I'll\nteach you a practice today if you want\nto go hardcore okay does that answer\nyour questions yeah 100%\nokay all right so shall we transition to\npractice sure okay so I'm gonna teach\nyou guys the bus yeah okay so this is\ngonna be hard to explain and I can't\nhear you now okay\nyeah so your your can you hear me\nnot oh you have headphones okay so your\nheel and leg should be above your knee\non your inner thigh good\nall right so practice that and then you\ncan go to the other side\nyeah so you guys should try this at home\ngive it a shot so breathe my little\nbreathe it'll make it easier deep breath\nin and deep breath out there you go just\nmake sure you keep breathing stability\ncomes from breath look at that all you\nhave to do is breathe [ __ ] weird but\njust keep doing it you guys see that let\ngo of the tension focus on your breath\nand see what your body is capable of\nbeautiful\nif you're having difficulty just focus\non your breath\nhold the position go ahead and switch\nover to the other side right so no\npreparatory practice for us today no\nbasic asana and breathe if you want to\nmake it easier on yourself you can open\nyour eyes because your your brain has\nthree different circuits that regulate\nbalance\neyes will help eyes open will help you\nbalance continue breathing and now relax\nclose your eyes let your arms come down\nleg come down and just feel your body\njust sit in the space of your mind\nnotice what your Brock is doing\ngo ahead and come back hardcore enough\nfor you yeah that'll do how was it a\nhardcore hardcore part is like doing\nthat every [ __ ] day doing anything\nevery pick [ __ ] day I think it's the\nreally tricky aspect so the Basia is\ngood because it is hard so I think this\nis a very good practice to train\nyourself to do something every day I\ndon't know how else do I feel like the\nBasia makes it the amount of focus that\nyou gained from doing that the bus your\npractice what you really are doing is it\nrequires like a full forced\nconcentration of the mind and that kind\nof XP gain like levels up your ability\nto like stick with something does that\nmake sense it's like a psycho somatic\nspiritual practice that I think like\nliterally boosts your like willpower so\nit's like it's a powerful technique that\nis designed to accumulate energy like\nspiritual energy and then the more\nspiritual energy you accumulate the\neasier it is to manifest things in the\nreal world and if we think about doing\nsomething every day like those those\nthings that are that are manifest when\nsomething when your intentions become a\nreality that requires where you smiling\nknow what don't worry well okay when you\nthink about manifesting a reality it\nrequires like focus every day so the\nbossiest sort of directly allows you to\nlike gets you closer to manifestation\nokay questions before we wrap up for the\nday\nall right one more so I meditate every\nday I've meditated before stream man I\nam like all I do is just sit and try and\nfocus on my breath to the point where\nlike I have no thoughts I used to like I\nused to kind of be in that space be able\nto kind of be in like a um\na mindful I think my bliss is better\nworth and mindful but a mindless a\nmindless state for like like three to\nfive seconds at a time maybe when I when\nI really have my routine going in\ncollege and lately I'm not sure if it\nhas anything to do with like the\nmedication I'm taking or anything but\nit's almost impossible to I mean I've\nbeen meditating every day for like three\nmonths and it's almost impossible to\nkind of return to that space yeah so\nwhat was your experience what was your\nmind doing what was happening within you\nduring that the Bastia practice during\nwhat we I don't know so I hang tension\nyeah so think about that for a second\nright when when are you not aware of\nwhat you're when can you not remember\nwhat your mind is doing when can you not\nremember what your mind is doing yeah\nwhen can you not remember what your mind\nwas doing let's put it that way to be\nmore precise uh when you weren't\nconscious absent the time right so when\nyour mind was not active or was not\nawake so I think that that the focusing\non the breath practice is too simple for\nyou like you can continue doing it if\nyou want but if you're interested in\nKriya yoga you need more intensive\nmeditation practices that\nforce the focus of your car the\nconcentration of your mind and I think\nyou were concentrating very very heavily\nwith very little mental activity during\nthat the bus your practice which is why\nyou don't really remember thinking about\nstuff right you weren't like thinking\nabout the weather or whatever your sly\nsmile a few seconds ago were like those\nare all false you weren't doing that it\nwas just a struggle and like your mind\nwas the position of your body was\ndemanding the focus of your mind it's\nlike we don't have time to think about\nanything we're trying to just keep it\ntogether and then you may have sent like\na direction to your mind you could say\nokay breathe and then as you breathe\nthings calm down but like that's exactly\nwhat you need you need a meditative\npractice that demands the attention of\nyour consciousness and your focus yeah\nand it's not\nyou shouldn't have to struggle to do it\nlike it's not a struggle because it you\njust you can't [ __ ] if I were to tell\nyou so get up again do that the bus your\npractice\nokay so like your mind is pretty active\nright now so close your eye never you\nneed to to hold it focus on breathing\nand now tell me about the last match of\nwar three you played when tauren\nchieftain with head honors what's\nhappening to you failing to balance good\nso let your balance return whatever you\nneed to good\nwhat was the enemy hero in that match\nhow did the match go I lost\ntell me about over the the history of\nwarfare have you had a favorite patch\nokay so what is your mind what do you\nnotice within yourself as I'm asking you\nthese questions a lot of tension my body\nokay so I would imagine that there are\nperiods of intense focus that it's\nalmost like like what you're doing is\nthrowing a ball up in the air and trying\nto do something like when I ask you a\nquestion it's like you're throwing a\nball up in the air and you're trying to\nanswer it before your attention returns\nto the body does that make sense yeah\nyep so come back down so it's\ninteresting right like that try as you\nmight to activate your mind your answers\nwere [ __ ] slow like you were saying\nlike one or two words and if I ask you\nabout like your experiences in War three\nnow I'm sure you would be fluent in it\nbut your mind is like you're trying to\nlike jumpstart your mom\nbut the practice is like no [ __ ] we\ndon't have time for your mind right now\nso that's what a meditative practice\nshould be the purpose of asana and this\nis why Austen is so good is because it\nautomatically you don't have a choice it\nmakes it easy for you to concentrate and\nthen like the second your mind starts\nthinking it's like you start wobbling\nand you were getting better at it\nbecause you were getting better at\nalmost throwing it up okay I'm gonna\nhave a thought and then back to focus\nI'm gonna have a thought and back to\nfocus and if you think about a\nmindfulness practice it's the opposite\nit's lots and lots of lots of thoughts a\nlittle bit of focus lots and lots and\nlots of lots of thoughts a little bit of\nfocus yeah and so meditation is not\nsupposed to be hard like if you\nunderstand meditation and so I think the\nbiggest problem with meditation is that\npeople learned a certain kind of\nmeditation and we're taught by gurus who\nunderstood meditation and then they\nbecame certified teachers and started\nteaching the protocol and they lost the\nknowledge of how to teach meditation\nbecause we care about certifications and\nif you get if you take this eight-week\ncourse then you are a meditation teacher\nand you can go and teach others and they\nall teach the same technique the same\ntechniques they inject the same\ntechniques because and that's what\nmindfulness is mindfulness is like one\nof the thousand different techniques of\nmeditation and if you learn the right\ntechnique of meditation you can [ __ ]\ntry to start your mind and it's gonna\nstop it's not gonna work it's like your\nbattery is dead so do the bus yeah all\nright okay\nquestions thoughts I love you love you\ntoo man\ngood luck well you're most welcome\nwe're rooting for you come back and be a\nsuccess story for us keep going oh thank\nyou\nalso last thing I was just I was\nsupposed to talk to you about\nintelligence I think you are intelligent\nI think you just need to understand that\nyou're it doesn't have to do with the\nego I think you're very smart\nbut that's separate it's just a tool\nit's like one of the stats on your\ncharacter sheet you know you don't have\nto get egotistical about it but you also\ndon't need to think of yourself as not\nintelligent because that too is\negotistical\nYeah right so like your intelligence is\nwhat it is in the same way that your\nheight is what it is and that your you\nknow your eyes are the color that they\nare it is just one attribute of you it\nis just a fact it does not need to be\nexciting nor does it need to be\ndisappointing neither of those things\nyeah I just wish it wasn't such a\nworshipped quality beautifully put what\ndo you mean by that can you explain that\nit's just like a dick swinging contest\nbasically sometimes just trying to seem\nsmarter than someone else and it's a\nwaste of energy I think the reason that\nit's worshipped is actually a little bit\nof a mistake because I think we use\nintelligence is an umbrella term for all\nkinds of capabilities that different\npeople have but really what we're saying\nis capable and we just call it an\nintelligent but it's all kinds of things\nit's hard work it's willpower its\nhumility its practice its intelligence\nbut we just call them oh he's so smart\nwhat that really means is good at\nsomething mm-hmm but anyway you know\nwhen you look at someone who's fluent in\na language they you say oh that person\nis so smart you don't see the thousands\nof hours that they put in it's not that\nthey're smart yeah I practice one quote\nfrom this cria book see if I can find it\nit was something like the dedicated\nperson of average intelligence is\ncapable of much more than the lazy or\nerratic genius absolutely right and\ntwitch at could have told you that\nbecause we're all erratic Eunice's and\nno one none of us have ever [ __ ]\nanywhere sure real yeah so we'll stop on\nthat sentiment thanks for coming on Milo\njust working and keep doing what you're\ndoing I think you're on a good path just\nkeep trucking all right thank you so\nmuch doctor take care"
