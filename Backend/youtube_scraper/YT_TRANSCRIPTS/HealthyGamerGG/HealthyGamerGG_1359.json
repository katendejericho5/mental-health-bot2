    "transcript": "yes I can see okay awesome and so let's\nget started we got now yeah\nso tell me how we're great about what\nwhat how would you like to be addressed\nby the way um unions call me dumb let's\ncall me dumb yeah\nall right Dom so tell me a little bit\nabout what we're talking about today and\nhow I can be helpful um I'm not sure so\nuh your assistant reached out to me I\nthink he wanted to discuss like I so I\ndeveloped panic disorder when I was like\n24 which is when I was in LCS which I\ndon't know if you're familiar with\nLeague of Legends but that's like the I\nguess the premier North American\ncompetition here so pretty much like I\ncame from there that's like how people\nknow me I played LCS for five years nice\ndream I developed like some depression\nso I went to like a psychiatrist and\neverything I was diagnosed with\ndepression and I got sober of last year\nso 2019 but I'm feeling like pretty good\nnow with like everything in terms of\nlike mental health but yeah I mean I\nobviously like still have some struggles\nbut definitely we're on the up right now\nI was just a man I'm so happy to hear\nthat yeah Thanks so so then in the in\nthat case Don Dom I want you to think a\nlittle bit about me as a resource right\nyeah so like what how can I be helpful\nto you or is there some and if nothing\ncomes to mind then I can you know I can\ntry to take the lead but is there\nsomething that you are struggling with\nor that you'd like to bet on I mean I\nmean I guess the main thing that I've\nstruggled with is similar to like LS\njust like negative feedback from\ncommunity like reddit Twitter stuff like\nthat okay so I think that that's like\nthe main thing that I like don't handle\nsuper super well um I had to look better\nnow than I used to obviously like I went\nto therapy like with a psychiatrist for\nI think I did like three or four\nsessions but I think that just even in\nthose three or four sessions it helped\nlike kind of like reframe how I should\nthink about things and then they kind of\nlike set me on the right path towards\nlike how you can become happier\nso yeah just just recently a good for\nyou I was I was able to like I guess\nlisten to their advice on things and\nyeah everything's been going a lot\nbetter now yeah cool so when you say\nthings have been going a lot better like\nwhat has\nwhat has changed in your life that makes\nthings better like what does better look\nlike um so just like generally like more\nhappy throughout the day I'm looking\ntowards by I'm looking forward to a lot\nof things okay um that I do also I think\nmaybe people are still saying them a\nlittle bit too loud okay\nthank you very much but uh yeah I mean I\nguess I guess happiness for me is like\nI'm looking forward to the things that\nI'm doing like like every day I wake up\nexcited for the day I was before I was I\nwas kind of just like I was like\ndreading streaming that was pretty much\nmy um inside looks like [ __ ] like I got\na stream today all right I'm gonna do it\nand then I wake and then like because\nI'm already expecting the negativity\nalmost it felt like almost focused on\nthe negativity coming out of my chest\nbecause like if you ever stream gameplay\nthere's definitely gonna be some\npercentage of people that are either\nbacks like seat gaming you criticizing\nyou criticizing like random things about\nyou\nand when you're in that negative mindset\nit's like super easy to just focus on\nonly those comments read only those\ncomments and just like have bad streams\nso just generally speaking like I just\nput things in place to just enjoy my\nlife more day to day so it's like the\nway I scream is different now than what\nI used to do just like the content I do\nis different\nand it's stuff that I look forward to\npersonally uh-huh and then I guess like\nI don't know I just I make more of an\neffort to see my friends in person you\nknow like just yeah just care about like\nwhat I'm doing with my time yeah so I\nguess that's what better looks like\nthat's awesome and so I have a couple of\nthoughts for you okay or a couple of and\nand maybe like directions we can go and\nalso thinking a little bit about what's\nmaybe applicable to our audience the\nfirst thing that I want to point out is\nwhen you talk about streaming so we\ngenerate you talk about streaming you\nsay that sometimes are you used to wake\nup every day and read streaming and now\nyou wake up every day and you look\nforward to it yep so that to me is\nactually in a bizarre way really really\nconfusing even though it makes perfect\nsense and so I can empathize with what\nyou're describing because I felt the\nsame way about activities in my life\nlike where some days I wake up and I'm\nlooking forward to one activity and\nanother day I look I wake up and I don't\nlook forward to that activity the thing\nthat seems really illogical to\nabout that is if we think about it most\npeople think about activities as\npositive or negative right we assign a\nvalue to the activity so like we'll say\nlike I don't like going to school I\ndon't like going to work I like hanging\nout with my friends I like going out and\npartying\nI like playing video games and so most\npeople conceptualize the activity as\nlike the source of goodness or badness\nright either it's fun or it's not fun\nchores not going but if we really stop\nand listen to what you're saying it's\nreally fascinating because even though\nthe activity may have changed a little\nbit here there that your experience of\nthe activity will be positive or\nnegative which implies that your\nenjoyment of life actually has is not\ndependent on the activity that you do\nbut is dependent on something within you\nmm-hm\nwhat do you think about that Oh hun\npercent agree so I guess the way that I\nlike rationalize that is the way that I\nstream is so drastically different now\nthan what it used to be in terms of like\nwhat the type of content I do in general\nthat it just gives me like a better\noutlook just inherently because I'm more\nexcited for the things that I'm doing on\nstream rather than what I was doing\nbefore so like because I and I think\nthat it also just feeds into like my\nchat interaction because I'm doing\nthings that I'm excited about for people\nlike sense that excitement or they sense\nthat like positivity and they don't\nreally want to like say anything\nnegative like they're just the odd man\nout if their relatives towards me in my\nchat so I think that that's it's kind of\nlike why it was so much better yeah so\nDom what I'm I'm hearing you say is that\nwhen you bring posit so the way the\ncontent has changed therefore you're\nmore positive and if you are more\npositive when you stream it creates a\ndifferent interaction which then also\nreinforces your enjoyment of the stream\nyeah exactly right but that's also kind\nof interesting because I'm I think the\nkey thing there you kind of talk about\nthe content change as where the start of\nof the cycle is right so the change\ncomes because you change the what what\ncontent you stream that's what you're\nsaying right but I wonder how much\nthat has to do with your attitude right\nso even though that the content has\nchanged your attitude is it possible to\nchange your attitude in and of itself\nand can that be the source of changing\nyour life so yeah that's pretty much\nwhat we're trying to do so before I\nguess the way I'll explain is I used to\njust stream only gameplay obviously I'm\nan ex pro player so people originally\nknew me for my gameplay and that's like\nwhere my first fan base came from and\nthen over time you know I wasn't playing\nas much I wasn't enjoying the game as\nmuch and I decided like okay maybe this\nisn't the right thing for me like I've\ndone the same things forever and it felt\nlike when you're just doing the same\nthing every single day for four years\nthere's nothing exciting to you anymore\nso after we developed like an idea for\ncreating better content we're starting\nto now try to apply that like good\nattitude I have in that content towards\nmy normal stream so I do do gameplay a\ncertain amount of the time now like\nright now our challenge on streams we're\ntrying to go because I'm known as like I\nlike toxic or like a flamer in game like\nI like talk [ __ ] in game right that's\nhow people perceive me that's pretty\nmuch like how I'm known in the community\nto some extent obviously there's there's\ngood and bad but that's definitely part\nof I'm characterized on the internet so\nwe're trying to go we're trying to do\nthe same type of like grind that we\nwould always do which is go from the\nlowest rating in the game for the\nhighest rating in the game but we're\ntrying to do that with only a positive\nattitude towards my teammates so I don't\nsay one negative thing to my team has\nthat were me so far we've we've not\nflames a teammate we're about 50 games\nit's a challenge we've not flamed anyone\nbut this is like the easiest part of it\nbecause when you're in lower rating you\nobviously win a lot more games it gets\nreally hard when you get like towards\nthe top and like one mistake and just\nlike lose you the game or put you far\nbehind and why do you flame so look okay\nso this is great man so I'm really\nexcited to kind of talk further with you\ncan I lay out a couple of other options\nand then let me know what you're\ninterested in or what chat is interested\nin so one is further exploring how\nattitudes so it's not the activity that\nchanges like interleague so the one\nactivity can we think about activities\nas positive or negative but what I'm\nhearing from you is that your attitude\nactually if\nfacts whether the activity is fun or not\nfun and so we can explore a little bit\nabout how you changed your attitude\nbecause I think a lot of people are\nstocked because they perceive an\nactivity like oh going to school is\nboring or going to work is boring and if\nwe can better understand how you were\nable to shift your attitude then maybe\npeople can start to do things that they\nnormally don't conceive of is fun yeah\nand and that can start to be fun for\nthem so that's one option okay\ndefinitely I mean I would like to talk\nabout that I mean it's obviously like\nreally basic stuff it's gonna sound so\ndumb when I say it but part of it was\njust that I wasn't taking care of myself\nlike in the proper way so I used to\nstream every single day so for four\nyears I streamed every single day\nstarting at midnight and I would wake up\nat midnight and I would stream until 8\na.m. so I changed my sleep schedule and\nI always felt like [ __ ] up doing that\nschedule like I always felt groggy when\nI woke up it felt weird going to sleep\nin the middle of the day like 4 p.m.\nyou're trying to go to sleep it's light\noutside it just feels wrong even when\nyou get enough sleep it still just feels\nfeels bad so I changed my sleep schedule\nI now start my stream at like 6 7 a.m.\nso I wake up in the morning this is like\nmainly through my like when I went to a\npsychiatrist these are like the glaring\nthings or it's like you need to change\nthis [ __ ] was my diet like now I eat\nthree times a day I try to like start\nthe day with like oatmeal and a coffee\nand then I just have like more healthy\nmeals throughout the day that's another\nthing that helped me a lot\nso diet and then just starting to\nexercise again which I've been pretty\nbad about recently but in the beginning\nI tried to implement that into my life\nso just like having just I guess a more\nhealthy body\nI think drastically changed my attitude\nso yeah dude-- yeah dude-- the the\nchallenge for me right now is that\neverything you're saying is something\nthat I want to spend an hour talking to\nyou about talking about the relationship\nbetween your body and mind the other\nthing that I just want to drive home is\nthat you know what part of happiness or\ncontentment or joy comes from you and\nwhat part of it comes from the outside\nworld\nright like let's just think about this\nfor a second because what you're saying\nis that your enjoyment of life\nand we generally tend to conceptualize\npain or enjoyment is coming from outside\nof us we think about our circumstances\nwe're like I'm unhappy because my\ngirlfriend broke up with me and so most\nhuman beings really think about the\nsource of their unhappiness and it makes\nperfect sense right if you get dumped by\nyour girlfriend like you're gonna be\nunhappy but we think about we don't\nthink about so let's take the case of a\nguy who gets dumped by his girlfriend\nlike the solution there is to you know\nmourn for a little while and then like\nfind another girlfriend because that's\nthe solution to loneliness like you know\nthe substitute for a girlfriend is\nanother girlfriend we don't think about\nthe solution as and I love it what you\nsaid you said eat three times a day\nright we're not talking about like\neating super healthy we're not talking\nabout like increasing like going vegan\nor eating like salads for lunch every\nday you're just saying like [ __ ] eat\nthree times a day like real real low\nbarrier trying to eat healthy is not\nwhat you said was successful for you you\nsay yeah I try to eat healthy try\nimplies that you don't succeed very much\nbut it sounds like what you are doing is\nactually just eating three times a day\nyep and\nthat is a fantastic example of like the\nbar for feeling better and enjoying life\nmore is actually not about changing your\ncircumstances it's not about graduating\nfrom college and getting a super nice\njob it's not about making more money\nit's about eating three times a day for\nme yeah yeah it sounds crazy because\nthat's not the way we think about it\nmm-hmm right yeah I mean it was all\nthings that I signed like really low\namounts of value to I was like yeah I\ndon't sleep enough and I know I have\nlike a [ __ ] up diet but that [ __ ] like\ndoesn't really matter to me like that's\nnot the reason why I'm unhappy it's\nbecause like all this other stuff what\ndid you so much what did you think were\nthe reasons you were unhappy I thought\nit was because I felt like reddit and\nlike Twitter and like all these big\nsocial platforms like what heavily\nmischaracterize me I thought it was\nbecause of you know like I would read\nlike threads about how I'm like this\nawful person like I'm a piece of [ __ ]\nwhich happens to like everyone and I\njust don't perceive people the same way\nthat those platforms do like a bunch of\nthe people you've had on here I've met\nin real life like like reckful for\nexample and Mitch Jones ls and if you\nread how people are\ntalked about like it's like these people\nare just like [ __ ] on the bottom of\ntheir boot that's literally how people\ndescribe these people on livestream fail\nly like League of Legends subreddit\ncetera and I just don't view like these\npeople as bad people I feel like they're\nall good people so I want to continue\ntalking about positivity but I also want\nto mention just another thing that we\ncould talk about which is like toxicity\nin general and you were sort of saying\nthat you know if you start to play\npoorly or you start to flame that like\npeople on twitch ad are gonna be toxic\ntowards you on people on LSM or toxic\ntowards you it sounds like you yourself\nare like I'm toxic right so it's like if\nI'm toxic or if they can label me as\ntoxic then it's like easy to be toxic to\nthe toxic sure feels like everyone wants\nthat outlet to be toxic on those but I\nthink we could also talk a little bit\nabout like where toxicity comes from so\nyou're saying that they mirror what you\ngive them which is also in line with\nwhat you were saying about your\npositivity or negativity on stream that\nthat you know people sort of follow\nwhere you lead but then this question\nstill be caught like we can still\nexplore the question of why were you\ntoxic in the first place and why are\nother people toxic in the first place\nlike where does toxicity come from you\nknow how does it affect us so we can\nkind of explore toxicity we can explore\nwhether happiness or positive like\nhappiness or dissatisfaction comes from\nreddit mischaracterizing you or eating\nthree meals a day which is also\ncollecting to me the last thing that I\nkind of want to just mention to you and\nit doesn't sound like we're gonna get to\nthis is it sounds like you haven't sort\nof said this explicitly but it sounds\nlike at some point you started changing\nthe way that you view your identity then\nyeah and and so I'm curious about how\nmuch of your suffering or positive\ntrajectory or negative trajectory comes\nfrom a sense like your definition of who\nyou are and how your life changed when\nyou started to view yourself in a\ndifferent way yeah so out of these three\nthere's part of our you know so like I\nguess one thing I was gonna say is so\npart of that came because I feel like\neverything really just lined up like I'm\npretty lucky in the way it all lined up\nbecause I I ended up changing my content\nright and I tried to change my attitude\nbut then really what happened is like\nbecause my content was\ngood or like at least in the League of\nLegends community people just liked what\nI was doing like I was doing certain\ntypes of like Co streams that was doing\nmore analytical stuff and people valued\nthe stuff I was putting out I started\njust receiving a lot more positive\nfeedback so I was somebody who was like\nmajority like majority hated on reddit\nor at least League of Legends reddit for\nlike a lot of years and then when my\ncontent improved you know all the cut\nall the comments changed so I think that\nkind of helped me feel better about\nmyself because I would read these\ncomments that are suddenly like you know\nsometimes Dom gets frustrated in game\nbut you know recently he's trying harder\nto be better and I really like him in\nthis format like there was just a lot\nmore positivity so it's because it feels\nlike everything kind of just lined up to\nlike yeah allow me to be happier so I\nyou know Dom respectfully I'm gonna\nactually bizarre as the sounds disagree\nwith you a little bit and what I'm\nreally curious about is I think your\nsuccess sure you got positive feedback\nin that fuel that but I think the key\nthing here is how did you decide to try\nnew content yeah so pretty much what\nhappened was before I was really\nmotivated by you know stream numbers\nlike I was super focused on stream\nmembers growth like everything like that\nand I thought that what I was doing was\ntaking a hit I was like I'm just gonna\ndo stuff that I want to do that I think\nwill get less viewership but it'll be\nmore fulfilling to me so that I could be\nmore proud of what I was putting out so\nyeah I mean that was pretty much like\nwhat happened in my mind I tried to like\nsacrifice the money and like growth of\nmy stream to do things that are\nfulfilling but it end up just all\nworking out so yeah so but I think\nthat's the key thing right so if we\nthink about what you were doing you\nactually made a sacrifice or you moved\naway you did something that on paper was\na bad idea\nmm-hm right you were saying like okay so\nI'm focused on viewership numbers and if\nI try something new people come to my\nstream because they're expecting\nsomething and and so in a sense you were\nproviding good content right like you\nhad a pretty stable viewership but you\nknow you had a good thing going and the\ninteresting thing that I'm hearing from\nyou is that you actually walked away\nfrom a good thing by trying to new new\ncontent yeah well yeah what was\nperceived as a good thing yet like I\ndon't I wasn't necessarily growing but I\nwas pretty stable but\nwith my view count yeah I'm with you I\nthink perceived as the key word here\nright so I think a lot of people do what\nthey perceive to be a good thing instead\nof doing what like feels right to them\nlike we have this formula for success\nand we have this idea that like okay if\nI do X Y & Z I'm gonna be successful if\nI continue streaming like you know\ngenerally speaking most most twitch\nstreamers know that like if you're a\nparticular kind of get like if you're\nlike let's say a hearthstone player or a\nlaw player and you try to play a new\ngame what happens to your viewership\nexactly right so it's kind of common\nknowledge that trying new stuff on\nstream is like an objectively a bad idea\nso what I think is really awesome about\nwhat you were doing what you were able\nto do is you had a particular formula\nfrom six for success which you actually\nwalked away from how are you able to do\nthat right how are you able to make that\nsacrifice um I think it like part of it\nwas just like talking to talking to my\nmom about things and just like being\nlike okay like have I made enough money\nat this point to like live modestly for\nthe rest of my life so once I'd like hit\nthat point where I felt like I'm gonna\nbe okay no matter what like I can move\nto a place that doesn't have high like\ntaxing like I can move to like an area\nand I could be fine I can raise the\nfamily like I can do that once I hit\nthat like that number in my head were up\nlike okay I'm fine forever\nthen I just stopped caring as much about\nthe success of my stream because I\ndidn't view that like I just want to be\nable to live the way that I like grew up\nwhich was not like particularly I was\nlike middle-class like not particularly\nparticularly luxurious but I have\neverything I need you know I always have\nfood always have like the ability to do\nwhat I want so yeah so it sounds like\nyou hit a particular amount of financial\nsecurity that allowed you to take a\nchance yeah yep at the same time I it\nsounds like your financial security\nwhile that gave you the kind of gave you\nthe security to take a chance it sounds\nlike your success does not actually have\nto do with your financial security Yeah\nright\nI think outwardly that's what that's how\nits\nbut yeah I think it's this is important\nto understand right so for people who\nare feeling stuck I I think that what\nI'm really like what this is by the way\ngoing in a completely different\ndirection from panic disorder and\ndepression which is great but I what I'm\nreally kind of fascinated by is that and\nI've noticed this kind of time and again\nthat I think that success doesn't come\nfrom taking good opportunities I think\nsuccess comes from walking away from\ngood opportunities what do you think\nabout that that's like I mean it's\ndefinitely an interesting way to it just\nsounds it sounds so so logical but I\nguess I guess that that does make sense\nbecause if you're walking away from good\nopportunities you're probably doing it\nfor a reason so if like the reason it's\ngood enough for you that sounds like so\nwhat kind of and spot-on right so here's\nthe point that I'm making and I think\nyou kind of embody this is that in order\nto walk away from it like what is it\nwithin you that allows you to walk away\nfrom a good opportunity like what do you\nhave to do to walk away from a\nsuccessful stream I mean I guess for me\nyou just have to convince yourself that\nthe benefits you're gonna get from\nwhatever you're gonna do in the future\nis going to be like you're just gonna\nhave some type of positive over what you\nhad before so it could be like what kind\nwhat kind of benefit so I think that's\nimportant right so what kind of benefit\nwhat were you what if we think about you\nstopping your loss stream there's\ntraditional rock little all stream and\ndoing like more analysis and other\nthings like that\nwhat were you moving towards within\nyourself um just like like more like\nemotional happiness I guess so is just\nlike it was trading off like security I\nguess for emotional well-being yeah I\nguess I even sort of answered so I think\nwhat I what I'm noticing is that\nactually when I say what were you moving\ntowards within yourself that's the key\nthing is that you stopped moving towards\nthe external world and you started\nmoving towards yourself mm-hmm\nis that fair to say yep and and it's\nawfully fair and and that I think is\nlike beautiful and I think it's critical\nbecause when most people feel stuck in\nlife where do they move\nI mean normally they move I would say it\nwould be like Alps it right like it\nwould be more like external they've\nmoved towards like more external success\nabsolutely right so the worse that you\nfeel about yourself the more that you\ngravitate towards an external thing you\nkind of come up with a formula for\nsuccess and I imagine that when you were\nfeeling shitty before you decided to\nkind of make this big change which\nsounds like it came through a lot of\nconversation and a lot of reflection\nright it's not like something that you\njust woke up one day and you're like\n[ __ ] it I'm done with this yeah it\nsounds like my friends and you know yeah\nso it sounds like you did a lot of\nsoul-searching to try to figure out what\nyou wanted to do before you went through\nthis process how did you feel about like\nlike when you were feeling shitty about\nlike what's a so how long ago were you\nin the LCS uh four years ago okay so\nlet's say like one and a half years\nafter leaving the LCS how happy were you\num I'd say I was pretty happy but that\nwas because like it was the first time\nwhere I had because when I was in the\nLCS of his complete different thing way\nI'd never experienced financial success\nand then I also was like traveling a bit\nand I like fell in love with a girl from\nAustralia and I just liked traveling to\nAustralia so I just like felt like my\nlife was so cool at that point it's like\noh I can work from anywhere like I've\nbeen you know up until this point for\nthe last five six years I've been like\nin a gaming house grinding and now I\nhave the freedom that I can just go to\nAustralia for three months and just like\nexperience all these new things so I'd\nsay I was pretty happy at that point cuz\neverything was just like different what\nhappened to your happiness um well I\nmean obviously like the start of a\nrelationship is always the best part I\nfeel like we're not necessarily always\nthe best part but there's like a\nhoneymoon phase obviously right I think\nyou start being more realistic with like\nyour flaws the other person's flaws how\nyou guys actually like wind up together\nso the relationship just ended up being\nyou know less and less beneficial for\nfor my happiness personally also like\nyeah I mean we were both dealing with\nwith our own things like we both had\ndepression at the same time which was\nlike kind of like and I think that's\nkind of like when you're when you live\nwith somebody that that's depressed I\nfeel like it's it's like\nyou become depressed too or something\nabsolutely right so like we both weren't\nlike in the best state and then also I\nthink that my career started to plateau\nbecause I think part of the reason why I\nwas so happy and like like a year and a\nhalf in it was like every like bit I\nwould be like oh I get to see my viewers\ngo for like 3k and a 3.5 to 4k like I\nwas very like focused on that being\nsuccess more viewers equals success\nthat's like what my mentality was so\neverything was going up and then my\nrelationship started to like plateau and\nthen maybe even decline and then my\ncareer started to plateau so then it's\njust like when when you start plateauing\nI feel like when you don't feel like\nyou're making any progress in your\ncareer and you don't feel like you're\nmaking any progress in your relationship\nit just it felt like I just wasn't like\ndoing anything positive like I didn't\nfeel like I was growing day by day it\nwas just like oh I'm just like existing\nyeah beautifully set right you're just\nexisting so you're not you're not really\nlike living life it's just life is just\nmoving around you you know and it's just\nkind of proceeding on its own and you're\njust kind of there day to day so I want\nto tunnel down into this a little bit so\nyou know how is your life different now\nand in terms of in terms of what in\nterms of like like feeling happy um well\nI guess like part of it is that instead\nof looking at view count for things I'm\nmore like proud of the content that I\nproduce so when I go back I feel like\nbecause I've started like now I have two\npodcasts that I do and they're well\nreceived in the community and I just\nlike doing them they're really exciting\nfor me I have like bodies of work where\nat the end of it it's like it's not like\noh I just grinded another year for no\nreason I can look back at like my\nYouTube videos or I can like put like\nlook at like a playlist of all my my\nvideos and be like that is like a body\nof work I did here's my show the crack\ndown season one there it is I did that\nI'm proud of it I'm happy about that so\nlike professionally I feel like I have\nsome gratification whereas before it was\nkind of just like month to month like\nlet's try to just do things that Cyprian\nmore viewership exactly so so I'm and\nDom you got to let me know if I'm like\nhammering at a point too much but I just\nhear you you lacing it into so much of\nwhat you're saying so I just want you to\nthink a little bit about where was your\nbarometer of success coming from when\nyou\nwere unhappy um just like average view\naccount exactly literally like the\nbiggest where is your barometer for hat\nfor success coming from now um just like\nwhen I'm done with whatever I produce\nfeeling good about it like if I if I\ndon't get any viewers and I'm hat and\nlike I do a piece of content that I like\nI'm just like okay that was good for me\nyou know that was beneficial so like\neven even things like coming on um like\nyou're surely I would are like yeah\nbeing able to talk to you this is\nsomething like before I'd be like last\nyear I'd be weighing that like in the\nmentality of like oh this like increased\nmy branding well like I'd be getting\nlike followers from this like it was\nlike a really like [ __ ] up way to\nthink but I think that just like when\nyou stream for so long and you talk to\nall these streamers it just becomes like\nso hammered into you so I'd be like\nthinking about okay I'm talking to dr. K\nis it better to the stream for three\nhours if I made more money streaming\nthrough it for three hours do I gain\nmore reach by talking to dr. K and that\nwould be just like the my like what I'd\nbe think what got in my head to judge\nwhether or not I sure that that does\nthat what's [ __ ] up about that that's\nhow I'm very intelligent to me well I\nthink it's just like so business II when\nthe point of talking to you is I get to\ntalk to a Harvard PhD psychologist that\nis extremely intelligent about you know\nabout these things that I'm that I'm\nthinking about you know so it's like\nit's an opportunity to talk to you it's\nnot an opportunity to grow my brand yeah\nso how do you think it is that you're\nable to change the way that you look at\na conversation right so like this once\nagain nothing has changed in the outside\nworld something has changed within you\nwhich affects the way that you look at\nthe outside world um yeah I don't know I\nguess it's just like that quest for like\nI guess I guess it's just like being\nconscious of like your own happiness and\nthen like questing towards that I guess\nit would be yeah and and so I think this\nso most people are conscious of their\nown unhappiness and and the way that\nthey quest towards it is on the outside\nright like and that's what you were\ndoing for a long time like you were\nthinking about the outside you were\nthinking about the outcomes you were\nthinking about viewership you were think\nabout monetization those are all\nimportant business decisions and I\nadventure that you actually still think\nabout that stuff right yeah definitely\nbut like I guess I guess the main thing\nthat I would say is like I assign value\nto other things before before I didn't I\ndidn't assign value to like hang out\nwith my friends for a night like it was\nlike oh that\nlike I don't gain anything from that\nmonetarily or business-wise so it's not\nvaluable so I think that my mentality\nchange like trying to find the value\nwithin like just your actions throughout\nthe day like come on spending two hours\ntalking to you like what is the value of\nthat what is the value of like having\nyou know a good conversation with my\nfriends like how am I gonna feel the\nnext day like just assigning more value\nto those types of things I think helped\nme like mentally a lot yeah\nbeautifully said right so if I I think\nif I had to find an answer to all of the\nquestions I've been asking you Dom I\nthink you just gave it to me so most\npeople who were stuck they have a set\nthey have like a chart in their mind\nabout what's valuable and they tend to\ngravitate towards the things that are\nhigh value right like you kind of think\nabout okay if I do this\nlike what's valuable is getting more\nviewership in making more money getting\nbuilding my brand that's what is\nvaluable and so what happens is all of\nyour actions you think about okay\nthere's high value stuff and there's low\nvalue stuff and you chase the high value\nstuff and you forget about the low value\nstuff the fundamental thing start go\nahead well I was just gonna say I also\njust like felt like I was being a [ __ ]\nif I wasn't pursuing that stuff so if I\nlike exactly went out and partied I was\nlike oh that's like a day I just lost\nstreaming like I'm just like [ __ ] up\nI'm being selfish is kind of how I\nviewed it yeah it's like good to be\nselfish in that\nyeah it's that way I would say so so the\nreason that you felt like it sounds like\nyou felt like a [ __ ] but that once\nagain is based on your perception of\nwhat's valuable and what is it like you\nfelt like a [ __ ] you felt like you\nfelt selfish and guilty for doing the\nlow value thing instead of a high value\nthing mm-hm\nwhat I'm hearing from you now this is\nthat I tried to jot down your exact word\negde because I thought it was it was\nexcellent\ntrying to find value and activities\nthroughout the day that's fundamentally\nwhat I think has changed about you yeah\nis that what you've done is instead of\nhaving a standard of high value and low\nvalue in gravitating towards high value\nstuff you tried to find value and so\ninstead of like your life being about\nups and downs like there's good stuff\nand there's bad stuff there's horizontal\nvalue across the board and so what it\ndoes is it allows you to do different\nkinds of activities which sort of\nenriches your life overall and what's\nhappened to your success over the last\ntwo or three years well I mean in the\nlast yeah in the last two or three\nmonths since I've been I guess or like I\nguess maybe five months six months now\nyeah it just all went up like\neverything's just been better\nso that's [ __ ] weird right so like if\nwe think about you started moving away\nfrom the high value things and your\nsuccess has improved yep so this goes\nback to and I'm convinced of this\nbecause I've talked to a lot of people\nwho've been very successful and and what\nit basically is is like I I kind of what\nI see in all of them they're not all I\nmean all is a lot but you know I think\nwhat I've observed the joys to them is\nthat most of them do essentially what\nyou did which is that they walk away\nfrom the high value stuff so success\nonce again comes away from walking away\nfrom good opportunities not taking them\nand oftentimes we think about good\nopportunities as like things that we\nreally need to be doing and we beat\nourselves up go ahead you look well no I\nwas gonna say like are they are there\nopportunities actually good if you're\nlike the better option is to walk away\nfrom them beautifully put right and in\nthe this is what's changed about your\nmindset because you used to think that\nthere are good opportunities and there\nare bad opportunities and and now what\nI'm hearing from you is is spot-on\nthat's like that's the next-level\ncomment is that when you look at an\nopportunity it can look good on paper\nbut it doesn't mean that it's good for\nyou right and in that that like when we\nthink about what someone says is a good\nopportunity we're using some kind of\nobjective or external criteria and the\nwhole point is that it's actually not a\ngood opportunity even though it looks\nlike a good opportunity if you asked a\ndozen streamers or a hundred streamers\nwould you consider like if you have a\nsuccessful viewership count\ndelivering one kind of content would you\nthink about decreasing that content and\ntrying something new what are they gonna\nsay I mean I guess it depends on the\nstreamer because I've had I have had\nfriends that have just like walked away\nfrom that but most people are just gonna\nbe like you know that's just a dumb\nbusiness decision like it's exactly\nright killing your so it is exactly\nkilling your career that's walking away\nfrom a quote unquote good opportunity\nand they're all [ __ ] wrong so I think\nthat you you have your business acumen\nwhich I'm sure you leverage to make a\nsuccessful podcast right it's not like\nyou just wake up one day and and you\njust decide to follow your heart it's\nusing all your business acumen but not\nsacrificing the person that you are of\ncourse I still click the [ __ ] out of my\npodcast right yes oh that's exactly what\nyou have to do so I'm not saying you let\ngo of that it's about sort of not being\na slave to that click mate it's about\nyou being in charge of the clickbait\ninstead of the clickbait being in charge\nof you and used to be like you know if\nit's if it's not click beta ballif I\ncan't get more viewership I'm not gonna\ndo it now you're saying like ok let me\nuse my click baiting skills to do\nsomething that I love and try to make it\nsuccessful and reach more people sounds\nbeautiful\nyeah it's all working out yeah man I'm\nreally really happy for you you you have\nany thoughts or questions I just\nrealized I've been kind of steering the\nconversation for a while no I mean I\nguess my thoughts right now err I think\nthe way that you've like spoken about\nthings has given me like a better idea\nof just like categorizing certain things\nlike because like I've thought of a lot\nof this stuff but I haven't really you\nknow had a conversation with somebody\nwhere I was like ok assign value to\nother things throughout the day which\nmakes a lot of sense because I um so I\nthis is gonna sound weird but I look\ninto like a rapper named Jay Cole I\ndon't know if you know Jay Cole but he's\na huge rapper and he was talking about\nlike kind of how he dealt with uh he\ndidn't really talk about depression but\nhe talked about something similar to it\nI guess like how he got out of like a\nfunk I guess is what what he said and\none of the things that he was talking\nabout his assigning value to random\nthings throughout the day so like if he\ntook out the trash you try to like be\nlike hey this is like has a purpose and\nlike like I'm taking out the trash and\nthen when he was\ndone with that task he felt good about\nhimself afterwards where before it would\njust be like yeah he's gotta [ __ ]\ntake out the trash so I think that that\nis like kind of that's like pretty\naccurate in what the like goal is of\ntrying to just be happy it's like\nassigning value to things and then like\nwhen you've completed them be allowing\nyourself to feel good about completing\nthem so beautifully part Dom because\nthis kind of goes back to this idea that\ntaking out the trash is an activity and\nmost people think that taking out the\ntrash is a chore no one looks at taking\nout the trash as an opportunity and so\nit is it is not actually the task which\nbrings us happiness or unhappiness it is\nour attitude towards the task and the\nvalue that we're able to assign to it\nthat's what I'm hearing from you and\nthat is something that I think very very\nvery few people understand because if\nyou think about like how do we live our\nlife it's like oh go to college get a\njob get married have kids these are all\nthings that we think about is like\nhigh-value tasks and so we gravitate\ntowards those things and then what\nhappens is that you end up is my patient\nwhich is like a 45 year old investment\nbanker who's very successful has a\nmillion dollar home and you know makes\ntons of money every year and feels empty\ninside because what he has done is chase\nthe high value task time and time and\ntime again instead of like as cheesy as\nthe sounds following his heart right and\nso he dreads going to work every day but\nhe does it because it's it's a good\nopportunity and when he thinks about\nquitting the ideas like like terrifying\nto him and he goes to his mentors in his\nbosses and his colleagues and he's like\nhey I'm thinking about quitting and\nthey're like man you're crazy like\neveryone wants to be like you know\nmanaging partner at Goldman Sachs and\nyou're one step away why would you walk\naway from this it's such an amazing\nopportunity I think that's one of the\nopportunities that streaming has is like\neven though you will have like a certain\naudience that is keen to whatever\ncontent you've produced originally I\nfeel like you can kind of do whatever\nyou want at the end of the day like\nthere is nothing that says like you have\nto like I don't have to just wake up and\nstream leads every day like I could do\nsomething else whereas like if you are\nan investment\nbanker it feels like you're kind of more\npigeon-holed into like like that is what\nyour degree is in like you should be an\ninvestment banker at that point why is\nwhy do you want why do you believe that\nhis situation is different from yours um\nI guess because of like the amount of\nwork he probably put in in like\npositioning himself within that field to\nto be successful so his like whatever\ncollege degree he ended up getting I\nassume that he has to get a master's\npotentially a PhD like all those things\nto grind towards one goal I feel like it\nkind of puts you in a yeah how old are\nyou don't mind me asking 29 okay so I'm\npretty sure that you have you have grind\nlike four years ago or three years ago\nI'm pretty sure that the amount of grind\nthat both of you had done was comparable\nor even yours is greater potentially\nright so IIIi don't I think that yes I\nguess what I was pretty much a meowt was\nlike my grind was essentially to like it\nsounds weird but it's like your grind is\nlike to become popular on the Internet\nwhere his grind was towards getting like\nqualifications to be able to perform\nwhatever job he's doing now yeah and and\nso so I think that you know this is\nsomething that I understand your\nperception is that way I don't really\nagree so I think that is capacity to\nbecome a streamer is about as high as\nyour capacity to become an investment\nbanker but I think that like you can\nsort of do when you say you can do\nwhatever you want you can't really do\nwhatever you want to what you can do is\nmove like one step laterally at a time\nwithin your field right so has you\nbecome a like an influencer or streamer\nyou can start to create new content but\nyou're still a streamer but you're just\nkind of moving laterally and he's\ncapable of doing the same lateral move\nso he can move from Investment Banking\ninto venture capital he can become an\nangel investor he can become CFO chief\nfinancial officer of like a company yeah\nhe can move that way and that's\nbasically what I did too I mean I'm I'm\na you know a psychiatrist and so I\ntrained for many many years to like\nunderstand psychiatry and neuroscience\nand so I can't become a pro gamer but I\ncan sure as hell start talking to gamers\nabout their mental health and how their\nbrain works that's like a really big\nlateral step if you think about it\nyeah that makes that make sense you're\ndefinitely right about that yeah and and\nso I think um you know as you understand\nthe individual field I think everyone\ncan make lateral changes you can't jump\nfrom like a to Z but you can definitely\ngo from like a to D and what I'm hearing\nfrom you is that you've branched out\nlaterally and I think this is also\nsomething that's leads to a lot of\nsuccesses when people start branching\nout laterally from there like one thing\nso to produce a podcast I think is like\na fantastic idea right because you're\nkind of there's some of your core\naudience and then you're kind of\nappealing to like slightly different\npeople you're kind of expanding your\nbase by offering a different kind of\ncontent there are a lot of people like\nso what percentage of League of Legends\nplayers have podcasts ah not sure that's\na very small amount exactly right so\nyou're also differentiating yourself\nfrom your competition because there are\nlots of people who are League of Legends\nplayers there are lots of pros lots of\nstreamers it's a very popular game but\nnot everyone has a podcast so you're\nkind of enhancing your brand by kind of\nexpanding that way so I mean yeah I'm\njust I'm really happy to am I just\ntalking too much because I'm excited I\nlove what I'm hearing okay let's make it\nyeah it's making perfect sense I think\nit's helping how is it helping I guess\njust like giving more definition to a\nlot of like the ideas I've had and like\nsome reinforcement on certain ideas some\nlike new opinions on other ideas like\nobviously like the what we just talked\nabout about like lateral movements\nwithin your field I think that's like\nsomething that I can definitely take and\nlike apply to whatever I do next if I do\nsomething next or just like a different\nway to kind of think about what I am\ndoing because I kind of just view it as\nlike oh I'm doing different [ __ ] but\nit's better to think about it as like\nlateral moves within your field I think\nthat's like a very like good idea yeah\nso I'm happy it's helpful and I'm a\nlittle bit curious why does defining\nstuff help um I guess it's because then\nwhen I think about the concept I can\nkind of just like jump to things so\ninstead of just thinking about like\nthings in so many words in my head or\njust like I don't have to be like oh I\nmove from this to that and like leave\nlike like I can just be like that's a\nlot of move within my field\nwhat's another idea like what so that's\nthe concept right so then if I like him\ndefine the concept to me\nI think that it just will like help me\napply it later on okay so sense makes a\nlot of sense Dom I'm gonna still push\nyou a little bit okay all right so now\nwhat I'm gonna ask you to do is define\nhow defining is helpful so right so so\nlike so I think defining is helpful\nbecause it gives you like a mental\nframework in which you can like apply\nthe concept to different things what is\ndifferent about problem-solving with a\nmental framework versus problem-solving\nwithout a mental framework what does it\ndo in your mind I think it's like just\nlike it's like driving when you have\nlike directions that's kind of how I see\nit it's just like having a map to\nsomething okay so this is gonna sound\nsome kind of like a dumb question but\nwhy is driving with directions better\nthan driving without directions I guess\nit just makes you feel more like calm\nand stable while you're while you're\ndriving like for me like I'll just I'll\nfeel better about it so I'm sure you\nfeel better about it but I think if we\nthink about the like pardon me for\nsaying so I just don't think that that's\nreally that's a piece of it but that's\nnot the majority of it right if I'm\ntrying to get from point A to point B\nexactly right it has nothing to do with\nhow I [ __ ] feel it's about like\nknowing where you're going right yeah\nand and so this is where I'm gonna pull\ndo you meditate by the way\nno okay I tried I've tried a couple\ntimes I think that it's super high value\nright I just I don't know I feel like I\nshould okay so like that's that's like a\nlong can we can we save a little bit of\ntime I'd love to talk to you about\nmeditation if you're interested in\nlearning I'd love to help you try to\nproblem-solve about how you can meditate\nin a way that feels comfortable for you\nyeah and is helpful so I'm gonna use a\nconcept from meditation so this is what\nI'm gonna say so if we think about\ngetting from you know where you are to\nwhere your destination is if you have a\nroad map it essentially focuses the\neffort of driving does that make sense\nso instead of driving across ten\ndifferent roads\nyou pick the one Road and so all of your\ngas is spent on getting from point A to\npoint B instead of driving all over the\nplace what a mental framework does\nessentially focuses your mental energy\nin a particular direction and so if we\nlisten to some of the language that you\nuse you felt like you were doing quote\nall kinds of random stuff if I had to\nuse a word to describe that it would be\nunfocused yeah does that make sense\nso I think that generally speaking the\nreason that defining our problems is\nimportant is because we are all\ngenerally speaking pretty smart people\nand we have a high amount of mental\nenergy when a lot of people feel stuck I\nthink that they start to feel stupid\nabout themselves or they start to feel\nunhappy or whatever and they start to\nthink that like essentially their stats\nare too low right they think like oh I'm\nlazy or I'm undisciplined or I have low\nwillpower so their wills power score is\nlike a three instead of like an eighteen\nand someone who looks at you and they\nsay like oh wow DOM is so successful\nhe's super disciplined do you think the\nreason that your success is because\nyou're disciplined I thought I used to\nthink a part of it was but yeah I don't\nthink that's a huge part of it anymore\nwhat do you think it is I'm not I'm not\na hundred percent sure I think\ndefinitely there was there was some\nelement of luck because I was in early\nand then I've never really thought about\nthat I don't know I think it might I\nthink it might be like so I mean I I\nthink it might be like uniqueness like\nbecause I was like I don't know I was\njust more vocal about my thoughts\ntowards things and I was more just like\nharsh or like you know it was very um\nextreme I guess with with my thoughts I\nthought that that might have been part\nof like the reason why people wanted to\nlike even if they don't agree with me\nthe fact that I would say things that\nother people wouldn't say we just like\ngravitate them towards me I'm not sure\nokay so I think it's worth exploring you\nknow to understand so a lot of times you\nspend a lot of time like understanding\nwhy we fail right so like if you think\nabout like if you're a law player would\nyou say that watching a replay where you\nlose or\nto replay where you win is more valuable\nI mean obviously watching yourself lose\nexactly right yeah but let's think about\nthat for a second because I don't think\nthat that's actually true tell me where\nI'm going what am I so this is kind of\nlike watching yourself lose within like\nyour career and analyzing that and\ntrying to learn from that it's going to\ngive you like a better like it's gonna\nhelp you grow more than like watching\nyourself be successful and what do you\nthink about that right that's definitely\nwhat's 100 percent right that you should\nbe viewing like like when you take Elves\nyou should be really trying to\ninternalize like and grow from those as\nmuch as possible and use them as like\nopportunities for improvement rather\nthan you know just feel bad about them I\ncompletely agree with that the other\nthing is the other point that I'm trying\nto make is that I think you can learn a\nlot from your w's as well right so I\nthink that learning why you lose is just\nas important as learning why you win and\nin fact we have a bias to focus on the\nlosses and instead like what we should\nactually do is like like understand why\nwe're winning so when I think about you\nknow when I talk to people most people\ntalk to me about their problems but what\nI think is just as important is so\nthey'll say oh I can't take out the\ntrash but I think what's just as\nimportant is have you ever taken out the\ntrash and the answer to that is yes and\nthen asking them what was different\nabout that day mm-hm right so that you\ncan study your successes\njust like you study your failures and\nthat if you really want to be successful\nyou should study your failures and\nsuccesses and understand why on on one\nday you make the right choice and on\nanother day you make the wrong choice\nmm-hmm right so yeah so anyway I think\nstudying your successes is actually very\nimportant and I think for us like\ndigging into why you've been successful\nI want to come back to one word which is\nuniqueness so I think luck is also an\nimportant word and I think there's a lot\nbehind these and and I think the reason\nthat uniqueness is important is from\nwhat I'm hearing from you is that you\nallowed yourself to be yourself yeah\nyeah I would say I would say so\nbut right it definitely been me in the\nass sure as well that's that's part of\nthe\nprocess but if you think about it I\nthink a lot of people are held back\nbecause they have a formula for success\nwhich is based on the high value things\nand the low value things and they\ngravitate towards the high value things\nbecause they think that this is an\nexternal formula for success because\nthis is what allowed Dom to be\nsuccessful this is what allowed dr. K to\nbe successful so I have to do what they\ndid in order to be successful and this\nkind of circles back to the good\nopportunities right they say like oh I\nneed operat like if I take a good\nopportunity that sort of this objective\nidea of like good for everyone it's like\na universal ranking does that make sense\nyeah and what I'm hearing from you is\nthat you allowed yourself to be yourself\nand I think that a lot of success comes\nfrom people instead of following someone\nelse's PlayBook understanding that your\nlife is fundamentally different that\nyour circumstances are fundamentally\ndifferent in that you are fundamentally\ndifferent from any human being who has\never existed you know no one has been a\npro of Law five years ago named Dom who\nproduces a podcast that you have a fully\nunique circumstance in life and that the\nmore that you base your strategy on your\nunique circumstance the more like the\nbetter off you're gonna do like does\nthat just logically make sense but yeah\nbut the crazy thing is that's not what\npeople do right like what do most people\ndo to try to be successful Dom they\nfunnel themselves into whatever mold has\nbeen created by other people that have\nbeen successful exactly and so if we\nreally look at your success it sounds\nlike you sort of found your own way to\nbeing a pro ballplayer and then you also\nfind the lido self into a mold based on\nother people which is he became the\nformer pro who became a streamer and you\nfound some success and it sounds like a\nlot of your enjoyment for the first year\nor two afterward because you had made it\nright and you're just posting and\nenjoying the fruits of your labor which\nit absolutely makes sense but ultimately\nthose kinds of pleasurable activities\nthat are really cool are not going to\nlead to your sustained happiness it's\nessentially like material pursuits that\nagree or disagree agree yeah and then\nnow what you're doing is living a life\nthat is dynamic Dharma is the Sun Square\nthe word for duty or responsibility\nand I think what you're doing is you're\nliving a life of like duty to yourself\nand to other people what do you think\nabout that does that make sense\nhmm I think it almost sounds like too\npure for what I'm doing but I agree with\nlike the overall yeah yeah it just\nsounds like a little too pure for me\nmakes makes a lot of sense so the Dharma\nis not actually as pure as people think\nit is\nit sounds pure toka but it's just a\nreally [ __ ] bumpy road right so it's\nlike it's like you're but you're living\na life that I think you find fulfilling\nand is aligned with the person that you\nare you're noticing that you have\ncertain advantages and unique qualities\nand you're like turning those advantages\nand you can equality's into like\nopportunities and the world is kind of\nlike meeting you halfway yeah yeah so\nI'm gonna just pause once again cuz I'm\nkind of at the end of a train of thought\nand I've kind of been monologuing for a\nlittle while so just give you a chance\nlike any thoughts questions um thoughts\nor questions I don't know I feel like as\nwe've been going most of my questions\nhave been answered like I felt pretty\nlike free to be able to just interject\nwith whatever I was thinking during it\nso I don't have any like overall\nthoughts that I haven't already stated\nso what would you like to do so we can\ndo a couple of things next alright let\nme just see how we're doing on time okay\nso we've been talking for just a little\nunder an hour I'm happy to continue\ntalking for a little bit longer or even\nway longer if you want to so I tend to\nstream for about forty five more minutes\nso there are a couple of things that we\ncan do one is we can we can talk about\nmeditation if you're curious we can talk\nabout why why people are toxic and why\nyou used to be toxic and what's changed\nor we can talk I think I would still be\nqualified as toxic okay so tell me about\ntoxicity I mean I guess like for me it\nseems to like start at frustration so\nlike the more frustrated you are the\nmore toxic you'll be and just in general\nI guess like being able to like handle\nthat frustration well is something that\nI still saw\nlike even if I'm not typing to my\nteammates anymore recently I still\nthinking what I'm saying work or I'm\nstill thinking and saying like what my\nissue is constantly so I guess like\ntrying to that's one thing that's really\nhard for me is like having a more\npositive mindset towards like even like\nin game doomed situations like well you\nknow you are like stuck in a negative\nsituation like how to find positivity in\nthose moments because it just for me it\njust feels like almost like the waste of\ntime\nmmm so trying to like find value within\nthat I think is something that I've\nstruggled with which is like why I\nconsider myself toxic so you you\nconsider yourself toxic because you have\neven though you don't speak toxic we\nanymore you still think toxic top\nthoughts you say toxic things and you\nhave a bleak outlook on the\ncircumstances of the game yes and what\nis a non-toxic person do in your\nsituations how are they different um I\nthink they're just like more okay just\nlike giving their best effort and then\nnot really caring about the result as\nmuch so if they like their I think\nthey're better at like finding value\nwithin situations that could be like\nunwinnable so if like they view it as\nlike hey this is this is a loss\nguaranteed they can still find something\nto like learn in the game but for me I\nthink that I'm at this point I'm very\nattached to the result and if the result\nis negative it seems like my like all my\nthoughts are negative towards myself and\nlike my teammates do you watch our\nstreams I do okay but I haven't watched\nlike every stream in sure entirely I\nthink the only one that I watched\ncompletely was the Destiny one I found\nthat one very interesting no it's just a\nlittle bit curious about some of the\ndialogue you use because it's the same\ndialogue that I use and curious about\nyeah interesting so so I mean I think\nbecause it's weird because usually when\nI ask people a question about toxicity I\nexpect them to not have the answer\narticulated so well right away maybe\nthat's because I'm under estimating who\nyou are and what you've discovered but\nyeah it's interesting because I think\nthat's basically I would agree with you\na hundred percent right and and so maybe\nthat's my arrogance but I think it's it\nalso kind of goes back to what you were\nsaying earlier about you know taking out\nthe trash right so it sounds like the\nbarrier of where your growth is is you\nhave learned how to find value and\nthings that you've changed the way that\nyou look at value when it comes to\neverything except for actually playing a\ngame with weak watch it's yeah it does\nto playing law you know you you know\nyou're really good at like finding value\nlike like discovering value and what you\nused to perceive as low value\nopportunities like going out with\nfriends when it comes to [ __ ] law\nyeah pretty much yeah\nso so let's think a little bit about how\nto help you find value in that so that\nonce again so I'm sure that I could\nlogically tell you and that you could\nlogically convince yourself that even in\na losing game there's something to be\nlearned of course right so what is what\nhow do you as a whole person respond to\nthat logical argument I don't know if\nthat request that's like if I guess I\nguess so for me the reason why I'm\nfrustrated is I just feel like I'm not\ngonna be learning enough to satisfy the\nnegative experience that I'm feeling\nlike it's not worth being pissed off and\nfrustrated for that amount of time to\nget whatever like small little like\npositive piece of information that I\ncould get out of the game\nyep so what so I think this comes down\nto and maybe we can kind of come full\ncircle you know playing a losing game\ncan can have a positive impact or it can\nhave a negative impact and it comes\nentirely to your attitude so why do you\nget so pissed off and weak watches I\nthink that just inherently it's a\nfrustrating game um you I know a lot of\nthe time use dota references right so\nit's the same type of situation where at\nthe end of the day right like you're\nonly 10% of the game right you're 1 out\nof 10 players in the game so so often\nyou're gonna have like other people\ndetermine the outcome instead of you\nright look you can\nput your team a little bit up a little\nbit down but overall it's going to be\nbased on like the performance of other\npeople and not yourself enemies and\nteammates for the situation so I think\nit's just like an inherently frustrating\nexperience also there's in the game I\nplay like I know dota has voice comms\nthere's no boys comes in this game so\nthere's almost no communication between\noh interesting\nwe have lighters doesn't have voice\ncommunication yeah yeah it doesn't have\nvoice communication so huh for me it's\nvery frustrating because like I\nobviously played a lot of team play like\nI screamed with a team I played\nprofessionally for years where I just\nfeel like it's so much of an of a better\ngame to play at so much of a better\nexperience where you're able to just\ncommunicate with your teammates so for\nexample in like the rare occurrences\nwhere I've been able to like find five\npeople and get them on discord together\nbut we've talked it's even if you lose\nit's almost always a better experience\nwhen you when you could like hear people\nsaw it like if somebody dies and they're\nlike hey my bad like [ __ ] I like [ __ ]\nup like whatever that always makes me\nfeel better than whatever people type\nlike I think that people are just more\nhuman over voice communication than they\nare if you're like text so so so how do\nyou view people when you're not able to\ncommunicate with them like how do you\nactually think about a league of Legends\nI don't even view them as like people\nabsolutely right mouth breather\nNeanderthals well I mean just just like\ncomplete waste of space just just toxic\nas BOTS right yep yeah and III know so\nyou know having played a MOBA myself so\nI started playing dota maybe like 10 or\n12 years ago and and absolutely man you\njust completely dehumanize them right\nand it's kind of interesting because\nlike when you dehumanize people like\nyour experience gets worse yeah it's\neasier to also be toxic to them because\nlike you don't view that like you don't\nreally like view the impact of your\nwords is meaningful because you don't\nview them as meaningful yeah hey you\nknow what you're describing kind of\nreminds me of like breaking an inanimate\nobject when you're frustrated like if I\nif I like you know if I step on a toy\nand I get angry like I'm gonna pick\nup the toy and I'm just gonna [ __ ]\nthrow it into the river and yeah and\nit's kind of like you can just unload on\nit because it's just this [ __ ] thing\nthat's making your life worse and it's\nannoying and it's bad and I don't like\nit great yeah so I think you know we can\nit's interesting because I think you're\ndoing a good job of actually I mean I\nfeel like I'm learning a lot about the\nnature of toxicity and just how much of\nthe toxicity comes from you know the\ndehumanization and that when you're\ndealing at humans it's harder to be\ntoxic what do you do you think that that\nsort of translates like why are people\ntoxic on like on your stream like why\nare your viewers toxic he said then\nthere are always some people who are\njust gonna be like so looking for so\nlike I'll go and say this I think that\nLeague of Legends viewers are innately\ntoxic like it's just because of the\nexperience of the game and also I think\nthey do human eyes you to some point so\nif you go out like any League of Legends\nstream I think you're gonna find some\ndegree of negativity unless you why I\njust I think that it's just because\npeople see only your perspective and\nthey're not and like they'll I guess\nover prioritize or under prioritized\nthings you're doing and not really be\nable to see the full picture of what's\ngoing on also I don't think that people\nare as focused on what's going on as the\nperson playing most of the time like\nwhen you're watching a stream you're\njust like oh I saw you make one mistake\nso that invalidates your criticism of\nthe team because you're making mistakes\ntoo and they have this like arbitrary\nsystem of all that all mistakes or equal\nall situations are equal like that I'm\nnot sure I think that's it's also that\nand then also like if you're more\nnegative if you're more frustrated\nyourself I think people feed off that\nbecause they're like hey this guy's\nalready pissed off I can get a bigger\nreaction out of him like if I am\nnegative that if I am positive based on\nlike how he is right now yeah so I think\nyou bring up a good point about sort of\nlike you know they don't look at the\nwhole picture what I'm kind of curious\nabout is why does someone watch a\ntwister and try to get a bigger reaction\nout of you like what's that about\nhmm I guess just like feeling the\nconnection with the streamer like if you\ncan get them to react negatively\nI feel like they feel like they've\ninfluenced you in some way they feel\nmore like part of the stream I guess or\nthey feel like it's a more real\nexperience and then also I guess part of\nit is also like just just doing it for\nhumor doing it for their own self\ngratification\nya know what it's fun like it's funny to\nmake somebody else angry it's funny for\neveryone else when I'm angry it's funny\nfor everyone else except for me feels\nlike most of the time yep\nso let's just think about that for a\nsecond okay what's up with that why is\nit funny for some human beings\nyou know to make other human beings\nangry like why do we enjoy life better\nresponse you get out of me yeah so\nthat's why I really wish I could look\ninto a chat right now but I can because\nI you know I'm on a laptop and my\npotatoes set up but I mean I'm reading a\nlot of your comments because we are\nsadistic as [ __ ] yes you'll read about\nourselves to make them so the question\nis why right like why are why is twitch\nat like what what are we tapping into\nbecause I I think it's not I don't think\nthat human beings are inherently bad I\ndo think that trolling comes from a very\ngenuine place deep within side or deep\ninside us right I would love to hear\nyour take on this and and but the\nquestion is why like why do we troll\nother humans and what is it about us and\nif we kind of thing if we kind of kind\nof give you sort of a little bit of a\nhint which is that what influences your\ntoxicity right so what within you\ncreates your toxicity I guess part of it\nis like not being able to like fully\nexpress my skill so like if you're\nlosing really hard right and I know\nthere's nothing I can do to win like no\nmatter if I play like perfectly I think\nthat not being able to like show people\nhow good I am really like [ __ ] with me\nso I don't know if that's insecurity or\nwhat that is but like that's really\nfrustrating that's a super frustrating\nthing it's like beautiful so let me ask\nyou something do you think that the\nmajority of people on\nchat are able to fully express their\nvalue as human beings mmm probably not\nI'd assume that they're dealing with\nwhatever same same situation whatever\nlife they have yes so do you think that\nthe majority of people who are toxic on\nstream or what do you think what do you\nthink about can you have any idea of how\nthey feel about themselves okay I'm not\nsure right because I would want to say\nyeah they probably like a lot of it is\nlike projection where people are feeling\nshitty about themselves so they want to\nmake somebody else feel shitty but I I\nknow there's those people that that\naren't like that necessarily good so I\ndon't want you to give me the right\nanswer I want you to give me the answer\nof your heart and the answer of your\nheart is that it's more complicated that\nsome people are just [ __ ] trolls Yeah\nright that's what I'm hearing from you\nis that there's supposed to be this\nright psychological answer but honestly\nsome of us are just [ __ ] trolls yes\ntoxic human beings I agree with you 100%\nmm-hmm right so I think that's there's\nthere's just something fundamentally\nhuman schadenfreude you know what that\nword means it's grown a lot recently but\nyou know so schadenfreude is the German\nword for getting deriving pleasure out\nof like the pain of others so it's not\nquite you say tis imboca Lee why trolls\nto do what they do right okay and I\nthink that too is like fundamentally\nhuman I don't think it has to be a deep\npsychological conflict but I do wonder a\nlittle bit about I mean so one so I do\nthink that you hit on something with\nabout fully expressing your skill so I\nthink that there's if we think about\nwhat makes you satisfied in life you\nknow what we were saying earlier about\nthe podcast it's like why is the podcast\nsatisfying to you because it's not about\nviewership yeah yeah because at the end\nI have like a body of work that I'm\nproud of yeah exactly right so you can\nlook at this and you can say I made this\nthis is me this is actually an accurate\nrepresentation of Who I am I can look at\na piece of work that I have produced and\nI can say that this fully expresses my\nskill in this moment and you can derive\nsatisfaction from that you can be fully\nyourself and you can create something of\nyours\nsalt and you can derive value of it out\nof it that has nothing to do with how\npeople perceive you has nothing to do\nwith how many people watch your podcast\nit has nothing to do with what kind of\ncriticism you get it's just about your\ninternal feeling of being able to\nexpress your skill and I think it you\nknow what you said makes a lot of sense\nI think a lot of people are toxic online\nbecause they can't full they don't have\na place to do that and so they feel\nfrustration and then they also find a\nplace where they can vent their\nfrustration and like you also said I\nthink that allows them to feel connected\nyeah the other thing that I just like to\npoint out is you were saying earlier\nthat that your toxicity originally you\nsaid comes from a sense of frustration\nso I've also found that most people who\nare angry or hurt hey what do you think\nabout that\nI'd agree to some extent so this is a\nkind of like most of psychiatrists like\ngoing to like my past or whatever and\none thing that one of them said that\nmade sense was so I dealt with like a\nlot of just like bad experiences early\nin my life one of them was so like this\nis gonna sound way worse than it is so I\nwas physically abused by my dad but it\nwasn't ever like it was sometimes like\nhe would lose control but I never was\nscared of my dad I never didn't love my\ndad it was just like I knew that when he\nwas triggered like I could trigger him\nand I knew that if I triggered him like\nthere's old be I was get [ __ ] up right\nso I dealt with that and then I also I\ngot robbed at gunpoint when I was like\n19 so pretty much a lot of the or the\npsychiatrist that I talk to you kind of\nformed that as like I have a problem\nwhen people are like hurting me and I\ndon't and I'm not able to like stand up\nto it I'm not able to fight it so\nthey're kind of tying that into like\nmaybe how I am with like comments\naffecting me or like in this type of\nsituation frustration because like if\npeople are saying mean things to me\nonline I can't do anything to stop them\nsaying like mean I could mute them but I\nactually do anything about it so it's\nlike a feeling of just like not being\nable to deal with the situation\nso I think if that makes some sense but\nI wasn't completely bought in but tell\nme about your skepticism um hmm I don't\nknow I'm not sure why I just feel like\nit's just not true but just like it just\nin hmm actually would have to think I'd\nhave to think more about it so so so I\nwant you to try to reconstruct july's\nmaybe this little okay is it okay if we\ntry to think through that together you\ndon't want to have this conversation we\njust come no no idea I don't think that\nI don't think what they said is not true\nI think what they said is much like what\nI say on stream simplistic so it feels\nmore incomplete to me than untrue what\ndo you think got that yeah I think\nthere's definitely truth within there\nlike I definitely don't like when people\nare hurting me and I can't do anything\nabout it sure no one does I feel like\nmost yeah I I don't know if my feeling\nof that is more extreme cuz of\nexperiences I've had in my life though\nthat's where I'm like kind of lost like\nI just I just feel like it's it's\nsomething that like psychiatrist one or\nlike the Lisa's like I just I I talked\nto it just felt like she wanted to find\nlike a reason behind like a reason in my\nearly childhood I feel like that's a lot\nof what it is like a reason in your\nearly childhood why that shapes you to\nbe a certain way yeah and and what I'm\nhearing from you is that they may that\nmay have influenced a bit that we're\nmissing something right so when we think\nabout like Reddit mischaracterizing you\nwe can sort of say like oh like this is\nthis is what we do then via in the\npsychiatry videos like the Sigmund Freud\none and we kind of say oh is that the\npeople on Reddit and the twitch chat is\nyour fossa and they are hitting you and\nsays nothing you can do about it and we\nlike causal connections and you say oh\nthat's wonderful it's so beautiful I\nmean it's not beautiful but via enamored\nwith the analytical part of it\nyep but it sounds like it's incomplete\nright so like like it when reddit\nmischaracterizes you III think it\nactually is quite different and let me\ntell you why so when your dad it sounds\nlike when when he used to hit you you\nsort of understood that like the weather\nlike it didn't actually I'm not hearing\nthat it evoke to that much emotion in\nyou it was kind of like you yet well I\nalways felt like I did it myself you\nknow\nlike I knew I think I was smart enough\nas a kid to identify like when I was\ndoing things that were going to get me\nlike hit like when I was triggering my\ndad's like I understood when I was\ntriggering him fully so I felt like I\nhad a decent out of control over the\nsituation in that respect so it's not\nlike I guess that's part of I guess I\nguess it's kind of ties in to what you\nwere saying before like why do I think\nit's completely not true because I did\nfeel like I had some level of control I\nfelt like I could say certain things\nlike like if I said to my dad I don't\nlove you anymore something like that\nlike the kids say to their parents right\nlike I would get hit yes so actually\nactually Dom this sounds very different\nfrom to me so I think we're talking\nabout two different things because when\nI think about what you're describing you\nhave agency in the situation with your\ndad Yeah right what I'm hearing about\nreddit and lul is actually the exact\nopposite yeah that you have no power to\nchange yes yes so that's what I'm trying\nto say he's like that's the that's where\nI think that there is like well I do\nthink I have some degree of power but I\njust think that it's really hard it\nfeels different to me it feels like\nwe're talking about two different things\nmm-hmm does that make sense yes so let\nme ask you this have you had it cuz via\nvia via going to talk about Sood's oh\nhave you had a period like his something\nhappened to you that you remember where\nyou felt really really unable to alter\nother people's opinions of you um where\npeople judged you or treated you a\ncertain way and you couldn't do anything\nabout it when I was a child or now or\nanytime\num where you were mischaracterized\nI'm not sure uh I think I think maybe I\nwas mischaracterized a little bit by my\nparents but I think if that's like\nnormal just in in terms of what just\nlike what I was good at you know like it\nalways kind of was like oh you're just\nlike you're not a hard worker because\nyou don't work hard in school but I felt\nlike I was always a hard worker at\nthings that I cared about right so like\nwhen I was when I was in high school\nlike when I had my first girlfriend you\nknow I felt like I put a lot into the\nrelationship because I cared about her\nand I cared about that experience um\nwhen I you know would play sports I\ncared a lot about the results of my team\nso I felt like I was I'm able to work\nhard I just don't have the capability to\nwork hard about things I don't care\nabout is what I would I would say hmm\nyeah so I think that makes sense does\nthat is the way that when they told you\nthat do you mean did you feel the way\nthat when they judged you in that way\ndid you feel the way that you do when\nsomeone shows something on Reddit and\nmischaracterizes you yeah it's like the\nwhole like you don't actually get me\nyou're like missing the point type thing\nyeah\nand is there is there been a particular\ntime where it's not so much about them\nabusing you but then like missing the\npoint like if someone is there been a\ntime in your life where you felt like it\nwas really important for someone to like\nunderstand you and they missed the point\num yeah I mean I guess with the whole\nreddit situation that's pretty much\nmainly what it is yeah like I feel like\nit's like okay you could over focus on\nlike it's like I said mean things true\nbut like the problem that I'm dealing\nwith like what I what I'm trying to get\nat like overall concept is just like not\nbeing attacked it's like I'm just being\nattacked just person because what I said\nyeah so are you still seeing a therapist\nor psychiatrist no okay so one thing to\njust think a little bit about is that so\nfirst of all I I agree with so I trust\nyour sentiment that you know if you feel\nlike what the psychiatrist's say which\nif we had talked about it I likely would\nhave come to the same conclusion because\nwe're trained to think in a particular\nway if I trust you though in the sense\nthat I've come to trust what people\nbelieve\nthemselves irrespective of how brilliant\nmy hypothesis and formulation is if it\ndoesn't fit with you I think it's just\nwrong I think ultimately you are the\njudge jury and executioner of knowing\nwhat is right and what is wrong and is\nknowledgeable or a studied as I am I you\nknow I don't [ __ ]\nI don't live your life so I can't no I\ncan't really yeah yeah I mean so just to\nclarify I didn't stop going to the\npsychiatrist because I felt like it\nwasn't useful I think that it was just\nkind of like I understood what I wanted\nto do like it was kind of like okay you\ntold you gave me a bunch of information\nI'm gonna try to like apply that to my\nlife and then like it's not like I can\njust see them every week and that's\ngoing to drastically change it's like I\nneed to actually have some time to live\nmy life differently and then based off\nthat like I still plan on potentially\nseeing her like again at some point it's\njust I just wanted to like kind of work\non this stuff it's like it's almost like\ninformation overload it's like okay\nyou've given me like all this stuff to\ndo takes a while to like set it up I had\nit up I feel better now so I probably\nshould go back at some point like even\nwhen I'm in a positive mental state like\nI don't feel like I only need to go\nthere when I'm not feeling well but um\nyeah just like I kind of just wanted to\nwork on things myself and just see the\nresults\nyeah I'm glad you clarified that I at\nthe same time I didn't get the\nperception I mean it sounded to me like\nyou had three to four sessions that were\nvery useful yeah it's very good yeah the\nreason the reason that you stopped going\nwas not because you were fixed or that\nit wasn't helping but just because like\nyou got a lot out of it and you needed\nto apply it to your life and and so the\nreason I kind of asked you is because I\nthink if you go back or when you go back\nthen you should consider sort of\nexploring this aspect and instead of\nattributing it to you know you being\npowerless against redit it sounds like\nlike your dad is actually a different\nsituation because you felt like in a\nsense you are in control and maybe\nthat's also why you said yes you know it\nwas you made an interesting discovery\nactually feel like their parents don't\nlove them or their parents are like\nalcoholics and do it and like they just\nlike they live in fear\nthe time like never left lived in fear\nof my dad yeah I never thought that he\nwas like just gonna hit me randomly it\nwas always like if we get into a\nconversation we get into like an\nargument and I say certain things I can\nlike like it would yeah I think that\npart of it was just like being like\nmanipulative like as a kid like I\nunderstood that like if my mom sees my\ndad hit me I'm Adam Attica Lee right in\nthe argument you know it's like oh then\nit's suddenly you never hit the kid like\nit's is that this whole thing so I think\nthat I was kind of like me being like\nyou know being a little [ __ ] so so I\nthink that what I'm hearing from you is\nthat what makes it not as bad as it\nsounds is that it sounds like you\nactually had a fair amount of control\nand power in that relationship despite\nbeing physically weaker yes and that a\nlot of times when people are in abusive\nsituations part of the most damaging\npart is not necessarily a physical the\nphysical abuse but in the lack of power\nor control in the relationship which I\ndidn't feel like I actually felt like I\nhad power like that yeah that's the\nthings I felt like I had power even\nthough he was hitting me yeah so that\nsounds completely opposite of the\nsituation on reddit like it so I guess I\nget that now that we've like talked it\nthrough more that's why I don't agree\nwith that yep discussion because it is\njust different\napparently I completely agree that's\nreally useful yeah well it helps to have\nsomeone who's very insightful and pays\nattention so I I didn't hear you because\nthey cut out well I said you can have\nsomeone who's insightful and pays\nattention try my best\nthanks man I appreciate it and so so I\nwas just gonna say I think if you visit\nthat psychiatrist again I think it's\nworthy exploring that dichotomy right\nthat like actually the feeling with your\ndad is very different from the feeling\nwith Rhetta and if we ever do a\nfollow-up and you want to talk more\nabout that we can talk more about that\nbut one thing that I mean cuz also it\nsounds like you had kind of a little bit\nof a light bulb there so fantastic so\nyou can play with that you know work\nwith it do whatever you want to I wanted\nto just give you I just I wanted to give\nyou the opportunity if you're interested\nto learn a little bit about meditation\nand that maybe we could meditate\ntogether before we wrap up we don't have\nto but I just want to make sure we have\nenough time\nfor that if you're interested sure yeah\noh I would love to like have some you\nknow direction with meditation so tell\nme a little bit about your experience of\nmeditation so far it's very very limited\nso like I took a yoga class a while back\nand we do meditation so I mean I like I\nunderstand like to having like correct\nposture sitting up trying to like\nconcentrate on your breathing and just\nlike like trying not to think like I\njust always end up thinking about\nsomething I'm trying not to think well I\nguess I guess that yeah that was kind of\nhow I understood it like you kind of\nwant to let like your mind like rest or\nsomething or you want to just yeah maybe\nI'm wrong about this but you are kind\nyou are wrong so I think that's why your\nhave got a faculty we can fix that okay\nbecause trying not to think if you're\ntrying not to think you're doing it\nwrong and you're never gonna be\nsuccessful and and most people it's a\nvery very very common misconception but\nyou can't try not to think trying not to\nthink is going to be the opposite of\nwhat meditation is so let's start there\nso when you're trying not to think are\nyou are you creating tension or\nrelaxation within your mind\nattention definitely absolutely and so\nso what are you doing within your mind\nwhat kind of tension what's on the two\nsides like so tension it implies like\npulling or conflict between two sides\nwhat are on the two sides of the tension\nI guess just like you're naturally\nthinking and then you're telling\nyourself don't do that exactly right so\nyou're fighting with yourself so as long\nas you're fighting within yourself\nyou're never gonna be able to meditate\nin fact it is the very opposite because\nwhat you're doing is you're fueling more\nthoughts mm-hmm does that make sense\nyeah so I want you guys to understand\nthat energy in the mind produces\nthoughts and thoughts in the mind\nproduce energy so if we think about you\nso that you've been diagnosed with panic\ndisorder so for example when you're\npanicking is your mind super energetic\nor low energy oh it's super super\nenergetic absolutely\nright and is there is or when you're\npanicking is there tension within your\nmind or their parts of your mind that\nare fighting oh yeah it's all a fight\nlike for me it was always like because\nmy main symptom was like breathing okay\nit's felt like I couldn't breathe so\nit's constantly like like like okay no\nyou are breathing you're definitely\nbreathing and then like the other side\nit's like no you're not breathing like\nsomething seriously wrong with you like\nyou're gonna [ __ ] die do something\nyeah so would you say that oftentimes in\npanic disorder when you were panicking\nyou are actually trying not to think\ncertain thoughts yeah definitely\nright so let's just think about that for\na second while you're in a panic attack\nyou are trying not to think certain\nthoughts and your goal in meditation is\nto try not to think certain thoughts so\nwhat you're actually doing is the same\nmode of activity so if we think about\nthe mechanics of the mind you're doing\nthe same mode of activity as a panic\nattack I'm not saying that it's actually\nthe same as a panic attack what I'm\nsaying is if we tunnel down into like\nthe function of what your mind is doing\nit's a what you're creating energy panic\nattacks or high energy and you're trying\nnot to think certain things so it's\nactually very similar to a panic attack\nwhich is why it hasn't worked for you\nright because essentially you're like\nsort of doing the same thing as a panic\nattack so what we actually want to do is\nis so this is also good because I mean a\nlot of times I really struggle when\npeople are meditating right\nbecause then it's hard to teach them but\nif they're doing something colossal E\nwrong and I say this with love Dom\nbecause at this point I have some\ngenuine affection for you you're doing\nit colossal E wrong so that's actually\npretty good because it's also better for\nme yeah exactly so the the first thing\nis to try to not try to think or try\nokay not try try not to try not anything\nyeah right so essentially what we need\nto do I want you to think about try not\nto think yeah and and so but that too is\ntrying so you can do that as much as you\nwant to and that's still gonna create\ntension so so what we actually need to\ndo is is stop the trying entirely and\nwhat we need to do is try to relax wrap\nit that's gonna you can't try to relax\nthat\nthe other thing you're ever having\ntrouble falling asleep you're like man I\njust really need to relax and go to\nsleep and what does that do does that\nlet you sleep no it's the opposite right\nso what we need to do is is train you\nhow to let go and there are two ways\nthat we can do that we can either\ndirectly try to train you how to let go\nbut you seem to me to be a Trier does\nthat make sense yeah you're a Trier so I\nthink it's a big part of your your\ncognitive fingerprint so the way the\nunique way that your mind works for\nthose of you who are interested in\nAyurveda Dom has a lot of bit that if\nyou watched anything about our Father\nyou know okay so that you can even see\nit in his name right so I will dominate\nis PIPA so you have a fiery mind\nit's about domination suppression\nargument trying effort passion conflict\nlike that's where you excel creation\nit's like a very very active mind so I\nthink what we actually need to do is\ndirect to your mind so we need to have\nwe need to give you we don't want to try\nto not think we want to give you\nsomething to focus on exactly we want to\ndirect your thinking because this - it\nsounds like what you you benefit I mean\nyour your intellect is actually quite\nprofound and you're very easily able to\ntake information and direct your\nthinking in a new way\nand and what I want you to do is just if\nyou go back and watch the vaad that's\nbasically what we've been doing for an\nhour and a half like when you talked\nabout reframing right like in looking at\nthings in a new way\ngiving your your mind a frame why does\nyour mind thrive with a frame because\nthen you can focus your energy in one\nway so frame allows you to focus your\nenergy and what you're really good at is\nactually focusing your energy okay right\nso what we need to do for you to\nmeditate is give you something that\nfocuses the full attention of your mind\ndo you do you have a reluctance to use a\nbreathing technique no okay\nI use breathing techniques to help my\npanic disorder so what kind of breathing\nhave you done it just likes really\nstandard into the nose out through the\nmouth deep breaths like that type of\nthing okay so I want to give you\nsomething that is going to be men\nto lead taxing okay so what we want to\ndo for you to be able to meditate what\nwe need is for the energy of your mind\nnot to be built up through tension but\nthrough dissipate through effort okay\ndoes that make sense yeah\nso Wigan we can try a couple of things\nokay so I'm gonna just I gotta sit\nacross like so so is it gonna be like\nmore complicated breathing techniques\nabsolutely require more attention\nabsolutely okay we're gonna try to\ncomplicate you to the extent of what you\ncan handle okay perfect yeah and so the\nfirst so if you've watched streams\nbefore you gotta let me know if you've\ntried this at home okay so the first\nthing that I'm gonna try to teach you is\nsomething called triphasic breathing so\nit's a relatively somatic experience and\nit should be like cognitively a little\nbit burdensome okay okay so what I'm\ngonna ask you to do is sit up straight\nand close your eyes\nmm-hmm do you know how to belly breathe\nyes okay so what I want like with your\ndiaphragm yes so the first thing that I\nwant you to do so I'm gonna just teach\nother people so I want everyone at home\nto do this - okay so close your eyes and\nI want you to breathe with your belly\nand what that means is when you breathe\nin expand your stomach kind of push your\nabdomen out and when you breathe out\ncontract your belly and pull in and what\nyou can do is kind of focus on your\nnavel your belly button and when you\nbreathe in imagine your belly button\nmoving away from your spine and when you\nbreathe out pull your belly button in\ntowards your spine try to decrease the\ndistance between your belly button and\nyour spine as you breathe out and so\nwhat you should feel is your belly\nmoving out during inhalation in your\nbelly moving in during exhalation\nand we're gonna go ahead and do that for\nabout 15 seconds before the next step\nand really try to focus on your abdomen\nas you breathe try to expand it to its\nfullest\nnow Dom what I want you to do is as you\nbreathe in and as you breathe out try to\nminimize the movement of your chest so\ntry to keep it as localized in the\nabdomen as possible\nyou may feel some chest expansion or\ncontraction that's okay but really try\nto direct all of your breath into the\nabdomen and minimize the chest we'll do\nthis for about 15 to 20 seconds\nand now we move to step two so after you\nfully breathe in with your belly I want\nyou to pause for a second and then try\nto expand your chest and breathe in even\nmore while keeping your belly still so\nfull breath into the belly extra breath\nwith the chest in sequence and then go\nahead and exhale and relax both good\npractice that full in with the belly\nfirst the second phase of breathing is\nexpansion of the chest and then\nrelaxation will do this for 15 seconds\nanother five seconds and now the next\nstep I want you to break down the\nexhalation the same way you break down\nthe inhalation so breathe in with the\nbelly expand the chest hold the belly\nstill contract the chest then breathe\nout the rest of the way through the\nbelly so now we have four discrete steps\nto the practice phase one breathe in\nwith the belly phase two breathe in with\nthe chest phase three relax the chest\nphase four relax the belly and you\nshould feel a little bit of a stop\nbetween each phase we're gonna do this\nfor fifteen seconds\nand now we're gonna do phase three\nexpand the belly expand the chest hold\nfor a moment and then push your\nshoulders up as you expand just a tiny\nbit more\nso belly out chest out shoulders up and\nnow exhale all together breathe in with\nthe belly breathe in with the chest\nraise your shoulders and breathe in a\ntiny bit more and then relax all three\ngood in with the belly expand the chest\nraise the shoulders and then out\ncontinue at your own pace for about\nfifteen seconds\nand now we're gonna tie it all together\nso we're gonna segment our exhalation in\nthe opposite of our inhalation so in\nwith the belly I'm sorry\nexpand the belly expand the chest raise\nyour shoulders really like hunch them up\na little bit to get as much in as you\ncan and then relax the shoulders first\nbring them down contract the chest let\nit relax and then the third phase is\nmove your navel towards your spine so in\na third in a third in a third out a\nthird out a third out a third and we're\ngonna practice for 30 seconds\nI want you to do three more rounds three\nmore breaths and after the third round I\nwant you to just sit relax let your\nbreath do whatever it wants to and\nobserve what your breath is doing after\nyou stop just notice it and sit with\nthat new kind of breath\nand now dumb let your eyes stay closed\nand let yourself come back right so\nnotice the return of your your mind and\nnow put your hands together in front of\nyou put your palms together in front of\nyou good rub them together rub rub rub\nrub rub rub rub feel that heat that\nfriction good cut them over your eyes as\nyou breathe in and exhale slowly open\nyour eyes with your palms over them and\nwhen your breath is complete let your\nhands come down yeah that's crazy really\ncool what what do you mean by crazy\nlet's die well I noticed that when you\nsaid to concentrate on my breathing\nagain like at first it was really\ndifferent so I feel like super more like\nway more awake than I did before so I\nfeel like way more like conscious but I\nguess my breathing like before that like\ndiaphragm breathing I was focusing on\ndiaphragm breathing but then once I\nstopped doing like the segmented\nbreathing my diaphragm breathing was\nnatural so then when I was like just\nbreathe however you want I went back to\nlike diaphragm breathing there naturally\neven though before I was breathing like\nhigher up like in my chest\nnaturally yep so yeah the breathing was\ndefinitely way different what was your\nmind doing just focusing on focusing on\ndoing it correctly each step feels like\nit was kind of hard to manage it so I'm\ngetting actually more air in each point\nbecause like those times route try to\nbreathe into my chest and then it's like\nokay now try to breathe more with your\nshoulders and I'm already like max\ncapacity capacity on air so trying to\njust do it correctly\nwell over and over what kind of thoughts\nwere you having\n[Music]\nI'm like very just like calm relaxed\nthoughts like and I was thinking I guess\npart of what I was thinking about was it\nlike made me feel like like a kid again\nalmost in a way because the last time I\ndid diaphragm breathing I played music\nand that was something that they like\ntrained you to do as wooden players like\nbreathe through your diaphragm so I was\njust like thinking about like Oh last\ntime I did this I remember like like the\njoy of being a kid so I guess I just\nfelt like joy so so hold on there's a\nbig difference between remembering the\njoy of being a kid and feeling joy\nmm-hmm\nwell I felt like happy like when I when\nI stopped doing this like I just like I\ncan't stop smiling right now for some\nreason yeah so I guess I am feeling some\namount of like happiness yeah so that\nalso means that you're meditating right\nso this is what happens when people\nmeditate they start to feel happy\nso like enlightenment or moksha is\nliberate is defined as liberation which\nsort of in platon implies freedom but\nalso bliss onon which it means bliss and\nso when people meditate they just feel\nhappier and so last question I have as\nyou can just see you can just do that to\nyourself every day meditation is [ __ ]\nOpie yeah it's absolutely thing that's\nwhat people keep on talking about the\nproblem is that they do such a shitty\njob teaching it that people don't like\nit's absolutely Opie like there's no\nquestion that you can just make yourself\nhappy every day yeah man so you so you'd\nrecommend doing that like before I just\nstarted my day like right like when you\nwake up like I win at a point or I would\nnot recommend that okay I would I\nwouldn't recommend anything for you you\ntell me yeah well like I guess when I\nwould wake up I would just feel happy at\nthe beginning of the day so probably\nlike that would be what I would\nnaturally think it'd be the best time\nfor it good then that's when you should\ndo it remember it's not about external\nformulas of success it's about your\nuniqueness yeah listen to yourself\nyou will know when to meditate perfect\nI'm gonna do that when I wake up yep\nso one thing I will tell you is that if\nyou can do it around dawn\ndusk there are lots of texts that are\nthousands of years old that say that\nyour yield from meditation will be\ngreater okay well it works for you I\ndon't know it sounds like you start\nstreaming pretty early so you may be up\naround dawn yeah yeah it'd be like 6 7\na.m. okay yep do you have a place that\nyou can see the Sun my balcony or I can\ngo yeah my balcony so I would consider\nwatching the sunrise or being exposed to\nsunrise and meditating in that situation\nif you want to go like hardcore and be\nlike a yoga hippy you can go do that you\ncould also do it while streaming in\nfront of a computer in bizarrely you\ndon't have to do it in a very special\nplace like that's what's cool is you can\ndo it wherever you are\nmm-hmm and you'd recommend I do it the\nsame way with the segmented breathing\nyou're like stuck would I do it the same\nway where I start with just diaphragm\nbreathing and that I do diaphragm to\nchest then to shoulder a bit and then\nlike back down and then diaphragm to\nChester shoulders like that same\ntechnique what do you think well I mean\nthat's just naturally what I'll do\nbecause that's what gave me that go for\nhappiness response go for it right so I\nthink the main thing here so the last\nthing I'll ask you Dom is what happened\nto your perception of time during that\npractice hmm I'm not sure was that a\nlong time I I don't know what happened\nto my perception I think I lost my\nperception of time excellent that means\nyou're doing it right right okay so you\nweren't trying to not think so if you\nlose perception of time so time happens\nwithin the mind right so like while\nwe're asleep we lose our perception of\ntime now that we're talking your\nperception of time is returned does that\nmake sense yeah and and so if you lose\nyour perception of time that means that\nyou're entering a no mind state and so\nthat means that you're also not thinking\nthoughts so it seems like you had\nthoughts from time to time but for most\nof the practice or maybe not most I\ndon't know how much but it sounds like\nyou definitely got to a place where\nyou're you're a tenth the attention of\nyour cut of your consciousness was\nfocused on you without thoughts so you\nwere a conscious but you are not\nactually thinking things and even then\nit whether you recalled whether you had\nthe thought of oh this is like being a\nchild that it sounds like you\nhad the experience of joy that was\nsimilar to you being a child but the\nthought of this reminds me of being a\nchild and that experience of joy are\nseparate things does that make sense\none is a thought one is not so I just\nprobably linked it in my head because of\nlike so we had the thought and then I\nhad the experience and I just linked it\nnaturally but they weren't connected\nyeah so you had the experience and then\nyour mind because this is what it does\nscans based on prior experiences and\nmakes connections okay like every time I\ngo to the bathroom and I flush the\ntoilet my mind connects that little\nhandle with the toilet flushing so\nthat's what the mind does but I'm any\nway we're kind of getting a little bit\ndeep but just understand that there's\nactually a lot of cool stuff that\nhappened within Dom that is not thinking\nis that okay like there wasn't that\nwasn't all just thought it's like weird\nexperiences so yeah so I think you're\ndoing it I think the main thing is that\nyou need something so in order for you\nto get to that state it's got to be\nchallenging mm-hmm okay it's like it's\nkind of like saying like it's easy to\nnot get toxic when you're playing noobs\nand loll because you're climbing because\nit's like NBD so you need to be at a\nhigh degree of competition with your\nmind so if it and I so I think you\ndecide kind of what the cognitive you\ncan do it whichever so eventually what I\nassume is gonna happen is over time like\nI'll be more practiced at that type of\nbreathing method and it will become like\neasier for me which will make it like\nyeah that I'm gonna need new challenges\nso how what do i do from there happens\nso that's why advanced meditation\ntechniques exist right so there's\nbeginner meditation there's advanced\nmeditation there's Expo meditation so so\nmy path of learning meditation I learned\na bunch of techniques for about three\nmonths when I was living in India at an\nashram came back to the u.s. practice\nthose techniques for a year went back\nand then went to the advanced class\nwhich are more engaging more cognitively\nlike more focusing deeper techniques and\nthen eventually you'll start to have you\nknow different kinds of experiences\nwithin meditation that are kind of cool\nand fun Wow\nI didn't even know this stuff was\npossible like I thought it was like a\nmyth I thought it wasn't like hippy\nstuff or something you know yeah I'm\nwith you that's because that's how it's\n[ __ ] taught most of the time so the\nproblem with meditation is that we to\nbecome a meditation teacher you have to\nhave a class right then cuz that's how\nwe determine someone's an expert it's\n[ __ ] dumb\nsomeone has to completes the class they\ngo through the motions they become a\nmeditation teacher know like meditation\nteacher is about experience and like the\ncompetence that comes from it and then\nif you're a good meditation teacher you\nshould be able to take someone and teach\nthem how to meditate properly right like\nthat's yep but good I'm very happy for\nyou yeah whatever I did before I don't\nthink that was meditation yeah I guess I\nhaven't tried meditation until this you\nhaven't tried so so this is where there\nare a couple of different words for\nmeditation so meditation is two things\none is a verb it's a practice that you\ndo the other thing is it's a state of\nmind I think you have tried meditation I\nthink you have not achieved the\nmeditative state of mind until today\nokay\nthoughts of lots of questions before you\nwrap up that I understood why it was\ngood and like I like I understood the\nreasoning behind it but I just didn't\nthink it was like that like I didn't\nthink that you actually liked so I'll\nlet you in on a little secret like\neveryone who talks about the benefits of\nmeditation or is missing the [ __ ]\npoint what you felt is the [ __ ] point\nit's not about reductions of anxiety\nit's not about improvements of in\ndepression this is why people meditate\nunderstand this very clearly but though\nwas not trying to treat people's anxiety\nwhich is what we do now right we use but\nlike oh you should use headspace oh\nyou've got panic attacks like Oh use\nheadspace that's not why blood though\nwas doing it would that was doing it for\nwhat you experienced today that's the\nreason you meditate perfect absolutely\nman\ngood I'm so happy for you I'm very very\nhappy for you\nthat's really cool okay well I\nappreciate that thank you\nof course man that's gonna that's\ndefinitely gonna change things going\nforward okay well good for you good no I\njust say you know if you run into any\ntrouble or anything like that\nfeel free to drop me a line or something\nyou know I'm happy to continue to help\nyou or guide you okay awesome okay I\nappreciate that a lot\nany thoughts or questions before you\nwrap up I'm good okay awesome and thank\nyou so much for coming on and thank you\nso much for sharing like everything that\nyou did because I certainly learned a\nlot and hopefully it was helpful to\nother people too yeah\ngood luck man take care all right thanks\nall righty\nokay so we're about at time for today\nand so I wanna yeah so he's a bit though\nabsolutely right so we just we get a lot\nof Bottas well what happens is like\nelectronics worse and Vata so we see a\nlot more Vata disturbance then then bit\nthat disturbance in gaming but i\nabsolutely think that toxicity is an\nexample of bit the disturbance but yeah\nso that was I don't know I mean how was\nlike I know that we didn't like you know\nhe didn't start breaking down and crying\nand stuff which I know is why how some\npeople gauged the value of a session I\ndefinitely don't think of it that way\nand yeah so I want to thank you guys\nhopefully that was helpful for y'all I\nreally think that so I think Dom has a\nvery very good experience allure\nintuitive understanding of a lot of the\nthings that I think hold our audience or\ngamers or Gen Z back Millennials which\nis sort of like you know he's orienting\ntowards himself like he's understanding\nthat activities are not good or bad that\nlike if you don't like school it's not\nnecessarily school's fault that you have\nan individual contribution to the way\nthat you live your life and how\nactivities are experienced right so like\na great example like he said was from\nfrom Jay Cole and taking out the trash\nthat you can change something in your\nmind that makes you enjoy things more\nand that is 100% been my experience so\nlike what I found is that you know I\nused to dislike life and that you can\nactually do some kind of process of\nreflection and observation that through\nreflection\nobserve a\nand understanding activities that you\nused to dislike are more able to be done\nnot necessarily saying that I like doing\nthem but that I'm able to do them and\nthen so that can then that gets to the\nquestion of how do you understand\nbecause watching someone else tell you\nthat conclusion it doesn't make it easy\nfor you to take out the trash so I think\nanother kind of meditative practice that\nyou all can think about is just take out\nthe trash right and when you take out\nthe trash or clean something and notice\nyourself before take a snapshot of\nyourself before notice that you don't\nfeel like doing it do the thing and then\ntake a snapshot after how do you feel\nafterward so study yourself in the way\nthat you read guides to like climb you\nknow rank and League of Legends or in\nthe way that you like you know read\nabout this and study other things in the\nway that you guys keep up with\ncoronavirus and understand what's going\non understand yourself and try to try to\nbe a little bit more unique instead of\nlike you know just following an external\nroad to success because following the\nexternal road to success [ __ ] doesn't\nwork and so stop doing it like look\nwithin yourself everyone is a snowflake\nright that's actually the whole point\nlike I have a video mapped out about\nthis that I want to do but but you guys\nyou are snowflakes and you should treat\nyourself as a snowflake because you are\na snowflake no one with your set of\nexperiences and your set of advantages\nand your set of disadvantages has ever\nexisted in the history of the universe\nand never will again so you are unique\nand you better start playing the game of\nlife that way you better stop playing\nbased on like what other characters with\nother stats do and understand like what\nyou are and how you are unique and what\nwe can hear from Dom very clearly is\nthat when he stopped gravitating towards\nobjective success and started\ngravitating towards being unique he\nbecame more fulfilled and more\nsuccessful and I did the same exact\nthing"
