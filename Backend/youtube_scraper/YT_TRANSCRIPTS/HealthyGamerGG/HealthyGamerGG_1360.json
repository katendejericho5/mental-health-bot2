    "transcript": "so the first thing is that I think the\nbiggest problem is that we were led to\nbelieve something that is actually\nincorrect and so I think the real\nchallenge here is that we've had to\nfigure out and I don't think anyone has\nreally I mean we're doing this but I\ndon't think anyone has I don't think\nmany people stop and really think a\nlittle bit about the fact that we have\nto find our own way forward in this\nwe're not going to find an answer from\nsomewhere else because those answers\njust don't work anymore\nwhy don't we start to somebody want to\njust tell us a little bit about who you\nare and and what we can help you with\ntoday on stream like what you go by who\nwants to start okay I'll start\nI basically volunteer okay I'm straight\ncut okay I'm very nervous because I have\nsocial anxiety so this is rough for me\nto say the least\nyeah well props for you for being here\nand in social anxiety can be crippling\nand terrifying yeah definitely so we'll\nwe'll see if we can sort of think about\nthat as we kind of continue and just pay\nattention to what your social anxiety is\ndoing we'll see if we can help so\nwelcome stray cat thank you\nmy name is ruin and ruin and I was\nmoniker to do her so I was invited on\nhere I'm not quite sure exactly what you\ncan help me with but I'm happy to be\nhere man okay cool well I'm happy to\nhave you here and I also don't know how\nI can help you and also don't know what\na Doomer is so we'll get to that in a\nsecond let's finish to a B maybe we can\nlearn and maybe we can learn that let's\nkeep going with introductions okay I\nguess I can go so mimes ill so like I\nthink I'm like a tumor because when I\ndid like read about read up about\nBuddhism I learned about mu within Zen\nBuddhism and talks about like nothing\nand like that kind of sort of like\nchanged my perspective on things and so\nlike nothing is there I always say like\nnothing is everything everything is\nnothing okay and I always have like\nother problems like sort of like bubble\nup as a as it relates to being a Doomer\nso okay I'm interested just to like\nlearn about things today okay awesome\nand welcome Zil can you tell us a little\nbit okay I'm just a little bit curious\nwhat kind of other bobble Bobble\nproblems do you think bubble up from mu\nyeah so like my my relation to friends\nlike I I don't I don't see myself as\nhaving like a best friend okay and like\nsaw relationships I always like I I feel\nlike as if because I don't need to have\nlike a special someone I treat everyone\nsort of like as special like everyone is\nspecial to me it's type of deal right\nokay and it's like a certain way it's a\nit's a weird thing that like that I have\nto like think about but yeah and that\nice you that makes you a du mer well\nit's like I can't have like a special\nsomeone right like like though like the\none I feel like you know because I'm a\neveryone I see so so because you treat\neveryone as special no no one person can\nbe special yeah okay okay that's helpful\nthank you very much for explaining that\nlet's get the other the remaining two\npeople can you please introduce yourself\nyeah I'm an SE at sama do me because\nmany aspects in life I feel like I'm\ndoomed to fail like education\nrelationship I'm isolated quite alone\nmost of the time stuff like that I'll\nsay okay social anxiety and depression a\nlot of the time so yeah it all feeds\ninto a feeling of isolation and\nhopelessness okay a lot of thinking that\nin the near future I'll probably be just\nthe lone sort of in the near future just\nin the future in general okay I I may\nask a little bit more about why I use\nthe word near there for a second but we\ncan you know thanks for introducing\nyourself in Aussie and I think we have\none more introduction hi so I go by\nLotus I was also monitored as a Doomer\nso that's why I've been invited onto the\nstream today okay um I guess my main\nthing and why I would actually kind of\nassociate with being a dimmer and it's\nthat\nI've I'm still fairly young I'm 21 but\nI've a seemingly failed over and over\nagain\never since my senior years in high\nschool where it's just kind of I stopped\ngiving a [ __ ] about a lot of things in\nlife and I even told myself that over\nand over again until it clearly became\napparent that that I can't live with\nthat attitude as a cook or going into\nhigher education which I actually fully\nwas drew from last term okay okay so\nthanks a lot for sharing that intro\nLotus so let's just start with with this\nbecause I'm you know I'm behind the\ntimes so what's a Doomer mmm Zil what\nyou got okay your time out this earlier\nwe're trying to pin this one down with\nMoses and it was tough it's a tough one\nyeah so I guess like my like there's a\nvideo on a Doomer and like I resonate\nwith it and in the video it said like\nfor adieu Marie right they believe like\nall the external [ __ ] like like their\nwalls gonna [ __ ] and so therefore it's\nlike why like we're gonna suffer no\nmatter what because like the world is\n[ __ ] and like we have to contrast and do\nit with like the Boomer it's like the\nBoomers like oh like if the world's\ngonna [ __ ] right pull yourself up by the\nbootstraps whereas the doom would be\nlike no you [ __ ] y'all [ __ ] it up for\nus like what can we do now so like\nthat's sort of like there's like\nexternal factors that sort of like\ninfluence the way that we sort of like\nbe in the world I think there's like I\nthink there's a dichotomy between like\nthe way that boomers a boomers are\nbasically just modernism and then do\nMurs are post-modernism I think is the\nbest way to look at it what does that\nmean\nmeaning like this idea of truth with\nlike boomers saw you have to work for\ntruth and you have to you have to sort\nof find your own variant of that and\nthen I think do Murs basically\nacknowledge that there really isn't any\nand your everything is kind of\nmeaningless and\nthat affects a lot of people in our\ngeneration I think it affects most of\nour generation like my generation being\nlike I don't know like 18 but like 25\nkind of in that span but it affects some\npeople I think negatively because they\nhave other [ __ ] and their past or they\nhave things are dealing with\npsychologically that make that lack of\nmeaning really oppressive to them\nokay so man so you guys know I touch my\nface a lot when I'm streaming because I\nthink and I have to stop touching my\nface because of kovat it's a very hard\nokay so so I'm just trying to understand\nis so first of all like anyone else on\nthe call I want to add what they believe\na Doomer is or do you guys think we've\nsort of captured it no I think it's\nabout right okay\nstray cat do you sort of identify with\ncertain features of what people have\nbeen talking about definitely like just\nlack of direction and just lack of\nmeaning really okay all right so let me\nI understand this okay so the world so\nand then we're gonna start to like\nunderstand a little bit about how this\nstuff works so let's just try to\nunderstand the relationship between\ndifferent pieces the first is that the\nassumption that the world is [ __ ]\nright that's like where this starts from\nand and so what I'm hearing is that like\nsince the world is [ __ ] that's what\nleads to suffering or the stuff like\nwhere does how does suffering relate to\nthe status of the world for you guys\nlike when you think about your life\nwhere does your suffering come from does\nit come from\nyour circumstances and that your\ncircumstances are unchangeable that's a\ntough question I think I tend to put a\nlot of my suffering on myself like they\nwere it was my responsibility I'm not\nsure if that's a Doomer thing or a me\nthing you know so let's think about that\nright so I'm gonna just point out what I\nheard from you guys that the world is\n[ __ ] and therefore they're suffering or\nthere's some tie between you know when\nyou guys were talking about a boom or a\nBoomer believes that in spite of\ncircumstances it is possible to continue\nto achieve by lifting yourself up\nthrough your bootstraps right so like\nwhat you're capable of as an individual\noutweighs what the world the challenges\nthe world offers so you can overcome\nchallenges\nwhereas what I'm hearing is different\nabout a Doomer is that you don't like\nit's kind of assumed that like there's\ngonna be like you're you're kind of\nhopeless and there's nothing you can do\nbecause the world is going to hell in a\nhandbasket and and so I'm still a little\nbit confused does that mean that the\nsuffering comes from the world because\nit's so bleak that no matter what you do\nthe world is like you're just not going\nto be successful\nso in roons case he sort of places a lot\nof the blame on himself but I think that\nlack of success is inevitable just the\nsame way but okay fine\ninevitable sure but why is it inevitable\nI'm curious what other people say who\nthink like or do you guys think that\nyour failures because the world basic\nis screwed or do you blame yourselves\ndefinitely play myself more than the\nworld okay so if I think I was another\nperson\nI think I'd succeed in a lot of\ndifferent aspects better than I\ncurrently do okay with like being on\nmyself but I think a lot of that is the\nsocial anxiety like I know I shouldn't\nblame myself for social anxiety but I\nfeel like people like me\naren't treated well like stigma is a\nhuge thing with people with mental\nillness and I feel like if I went out\nand tried a lot of people wouldn't look\nat it very fairly okay um this may sound\nlike a silly question stray cat but why\nshouldn't you blame yourself for having\nsocial anxiety uh because it's not\nreally part of who I am or what I am\ndoing to myself maybe okay so it's\nsomething that's outside of your control\nit's not a choice yeah okay and and zil\nwhat do you think do you blame yourself\nfor your situation in life or do you\nblame the outside world it's complicated\nbecause it's like yeah I recognize that\nit's the outside world that's so it's\nlike there are these variables that you\ncan't they're like independent that you\ncan't influence but I can't influence\nthe relation to those variables but\ndespite of that relationship is always\nfeel as if there's always like something\npushing me down so that's why I feel as\nif it's like kind of both external but\nalso like I could have done something\nbut something just pushes me down so I\ncan't okay I'm really curious to how\nmany people feel like like Zil they can\nrelate to Zil saying like when you try\nsomething pushes you down yeah\ndefinitely yeah yeah I agree that I feel\nlike I'm just pushing myself down and\nthat's why I kept feeling okay yeah I\nmean I think\nout of everything that you guys have\nsaid I think the image of you trying and\nbeing knocked down again and again and\nagain is sort of like what I'm feeling\nthe most from is is that how you feel\nyeah and so what what is it that knocks\nyou down usually it's different every\ntime\nit's complicated pretty quickly okay\ndoes somebody want to share an example\nof you know when they tried to do\nsomething and how life cut yeah actually\nI'm gonna go I tried doing therapy\nmultiple times like different therapists\nI don't know if you know Sara P works in\nCanada it's free like but it's not the\nbest if you're not paying you basically\njust get chosen someone and you have to\nwait like months between and yeah I\ntried like I think with almost ten\ndifferent therapists oh my god and yeah\nI kept trying and trying and I don't\nknow like no one really helped or like a\nlot of them didn't even do anything for\nme they just told me to go on drugs\ninteresting\nso I think that's a great example of you\nlike really gave it you know ten chances\nlike ten tries salata tries right that's\nthat's not like giving up after like you\nknow something doesn't go your way once\nlike ten is a lot and and for all ten of\nthose experiences it sounds like all of\nthem were were not really helpful uh I\ndid find one and she was a good\ntherapist but she stopped practicing\nso that's Doomer right there okay you\nfind the one person that can help you\nand they're like yeah I'm quitting okay\nyeah I mean that makes sense right so\nit's like when when you I think it like\nZil was saying like when you try to make\na change in your life life sort of says\n[ __ ] you\nand then no yeah and then pushes you\nback down okay that was very helpful\ndoes anybody else want to share like an\nexperience where they tried to you know\nmove forward in life and in life kind of\ndidn't let that happen I think mine a\nbig one for me is like education okay\nI ever since school it's always been 40\npercent 50 percents no matter how hard I\ntry study and stuff like that and I just\nkeep failing really and when I go sit\ndown to study I struggle to study\nbecause just for many reasons really and\nI just feel hopeless and sometimes it\njust results in may not trying in some\ncases okay cuz what the outcomes gonna\nbe already I just don't ever do well you\nknow what the outcome is gonna be\nalready yeah how many of you feel like\nwhen you when you think about trying\nsomething you know what the outcome is\ngonna be\nyeah what do you mean by rehearse it in\nyour head like I feel like I go through\nscenarios like of what's gonna happen\nbefore it actually happens okay you guys\ndo that yeah\nyeah I like running simulations China's\nlike like models right in your head yeah\nlike your brains like a computer so you\nrun models and try figure out what's\ngonna happen\nokay\neffect if any does running those\ncomputer simulation models have in your\nmind it's never a good one what what\neffect is it what's something I'm trying\nto prepare for whatever is gonna happen\nbut I end up just making myself anxious\nand nervous and not wanting to do it\nokay\nso it sounds like the more simulations\nyou run you've noticed a correlation\nbetween the more simulations you run the\nworse you perform yeah what do you guys\nthink yeah I think it just justifies it\nmakes you scared of what you're gonna do\nbefore it happens and then it sort of\nbecomes true because of that it becomes\na self-fulfilling prophecy yeah you know\nokay so you're you're telling me and I\nsee that the that the more you kind of\nthink about things it's sort of full it\nbecomes a self-fulfilling prophecy so\nit's almost like your failure is\ninevitable like the more you worry about\nit yeah guys agree or disagree I agree\nyeah yeah okay yeah like that that\nframing like I can agree with and like I\nresonate a lot with the with a nasty is\nlike trying like I'm always sort of like\ntrying right I like and I tried it sort\nof like don't have an expectations just\ntry and see if it works or not but it's\nalways like life [ __ ] slaps me in the\nface whenever I try it's like nope\nlike there's this variable that you\ndidn't count for even though you tried\nyou're [ __ ] out of luck\ndoes life feel abusive to you guys it\ncan like I'm empty like do you guys does\nit feel to you like life is almost like\na malicious force specifically I think\nit feels like there's a certain\nidealistic version of what I would\nreally like and then there's a like a\nhuge difference between what I would\nlike and what I want to achieve versus\nwhat I'm actually living and in a way\nthat can kind of feel abusive as like\nit's more extreme okay so a gap between\ntruth and fantasy a bit okay Anna sees a\nhas implications I don't like but maybe\nthat's kind of the point\nthe life that you want to achieve yeah\nwhat would you call that\nyeah fantasy I mean would you it sounds\nlike fantasy is not the right word no I\nthink I just said that so slightly\nuncomfortable with the conversation but\nthat doesn't mean it's not the right\nwhat connotation were you uncomfortable\nthe person kind of just living and some\nconjured Disney World of theirs is that\nmake sense yeah sure is that what you do\nno I don't think I do that completely\nokay so it's not going to I think\neveryone does it a little bit sure so it\nsounds like fantasy is not the right\nword so what is the right word rune\nhmm I can't think of a better one huh so\nlet's let's help let's help roon out\nlike when you guys think about the life\nthat you could live do you do you think\nfantasy is the right word or do you\nthink it's something else that's or to\ncall it a dream okay what do you mean by\ndream is like a dream something that you\nstrive to achieve our dream is like the\nstate of consciousness when you go to\nsleep and you can fly and you have the\nhead of a horse sawing I strive to\nachieve but I feel in my case sewing\nthat I'll never have at the same time\nokay so let's talk a little bit about\nwhat is it that you guys want to achieve\nwhat is that what is the world that you\nwant look like just living comfortably\nwith a comfortable job and people that\nyou know around you okay what is living\ncomfortably me mean you know worry about\nstuff like finances or so financials get\nya rid yourself of worries in general\nrid yourself of worries what other\nworries are there just like anxiety\ngoing to places stuff like that anxiety\ngoing to places what else I'd say\ndepression is part of that what does\nthat mean depression can you help us\nunderstand that and I see just feeling\ndown a little the time and I guess\nisolated in my case as well okay I enjoy\nbeing with others a lot of the time but\nI don't really get that opportunity what\nkeeps you from having that opportunity\noh I would probably say other people\nhave left me but I know for sure it's\njust me not going out of my own way to\nmeet people and stuff like that\ncan anybody help me understand what an\nAussie just said he said I I would say\nthat it's other people leaving me but I\nknow for sure it's it's me not going out\nof my way\nso like I'm confused about who's\nresponsible for his situation what do\nyou guys think so fear of putting\nyourself out and being vulnerable with\nother people okay what do you guys think\nabout other people leaving him does that\nhappen to you\nokay confused on what the thing about\nthat because in high school I had to\nleave one of my best friends to then\nsort of join my other best friend I was\nsort of like in a group of friends and I\nwas the kid in the middle and I had to\nchoose one or the other\nhmm and how did you choose well the\nreason they split up in the first place\nwas that one of them was kind of being\nan [ __ ] so then I had a friend just\nstopped hanging out with both of us\nright so I had to figure out why that\nhappened in the first place okay and\nthen when he told me that I thought\nabout it for a weekend didn't I really\ntell anyone I don't really tell either\nof them like what the what to do about\nthis but um I ended up sticking with the\nother friends he felt like he was being\ntreated poorly okay and then a few years\nlater he ended up ditching me in return\nso a few years later he ended up\nditching you yeah he was dealing with a\nlot of health issues of his own huh\nokay so so what do you think is the\nreason he ditched you\nhe mentioned loyalty which felt like a\nvery sort of fabricated Astra to me at\nthe time I feel like it wasn't the\ncomplete truth okay do you feel like you\nmade the wrong choice in terms of who\nyou went with in terms of friendship I\ndon't but I feel like you ended up being\nsomething that was slightly out of my\ncontrol\nand I could have known like at the time\nI don't think I could have done anything\nto sort of change the circumstances sure\nso I have a couple of questions for you\nguys okay this is gonna sound kind of\nweird so the first question is how much\nsense do you think the other people in\nthis chat or making I think a lot\nbecause I've had similar situations too\nand so like I I think I can understand\nwhere they're coming from I don't know\nfor sure but like a lot of the things\nthat they're describing has happened to\nme so I say it like the moving from one\nfriend group to another because the one\nfriend was being an [ __ ] yeah what do\nother people think do you think the\nother people miss chatter kind of like\nif you don't I mean if you think they're\nnot making sense please say so it's like\nI'm not trying to frame the question for\na particular answer I'm just curious\nabout what y'all's\nsenses of whether other people are\nmaking sense I feel like there's a lot\nmore that is not being said to whatever\nthey're saying like there's a lot of\nunderneath that is being kind of like\nbroached on through subtext and that's\nit can you help me understand what the\nsubtext is root\nI mean enough for other people for\nyourself like what you're reading so\nyou're feeling something you're reading\nsomething right so let's let's bring it\nfrom subtext to like text hmm I think I\nthink it's just there's like this\nunanimous feeling of isolation between\nall of us okay\nwell set what do you guys think yeah\n100% 100% okay so this is kind of\ninteresting right so my can I just share\na couple of thoughts and like you guys\nhave to you know guide me from here so\nmy first thought is that I was expecting\na bunch of people who were like I don't\nknow like do MERS like you guys don't\nseem like do mercy like I had this idea\nof a tumor as someone who is like you\nknow just full of cognitive bias and\nlike just has a view of the world that\nis really really like miss shapen right\nwho just like thinks like like I was\nexpecting someone who's not gonna make\nsense basically so I have this\nparticular view of the world and you\nknow I'm confident in my view of the\nworld and I understand it's not everyone\nelse's view of the world but the first\nthing that I was shocked by is like how\nactually like legitimate all of your\nperspectives are and and I think that\nyou know even in as we start to like\npick things apart a little bit\nI'm also very surprised and frankly\nimpressed by how much you guys are\nwilling to question some assumptions or\neven Express confusion about something\nthat I think is actually really really\nhopeful so I'll give you guys just an\nexample like so you know it started out\nwith the definition of a tumor which is\nlike anytime you try something the world\nis a [ __ ] place so you're you're\ndestined to suffer but when I asked you\nguys where is the origin of suffer\nsuffering is it because the world is\ngoing to [ __ ] or is it your fault like\neach of you is giving me sort of nuanced\nand complex answers right like it's\nactually kind of I mean it sort of makes\nsense like if we just take what stray\ncat said about therapy for example like\nif you've\ntried to see ten therapists and only one\nof them has been helpful and the one\nthat was helpful\nquit like it's reasonable to think that\nthe world is kind of a [ __ ] place and\nisn't gonna help you out does that make\nsense like that's not it's not that's\nnot depression like sometimes I work\nwith people who are depressed and people\nwho are depressed don't see the world in\na correct way\nright so they think like they think\nthoughts like you know my family would\nbe better off like my kids would be\nbetter off without me so I should kill\nmyself they think thoughts like that but\nwhat I'm really surprised by and maybe\nthat's a little bit of what I was\nexpecting what I'm surprised by is\nactually how rational all of your\nthoughts are you know like it's a little\nbit surprising and also that when I when\nI challenge some of your thoughts that\nyou guys are able to kind of like look\nat them as in kind of a new way and then\nI also think it's really awesome that\nthat you know you guys have kind of the\nsubtext here is isolation so what would\nyou guys say that the core of your\nproblem is that you're isolated for me\nyes yeah definitely feels that way yeah\nso okay so so great so like have you\nguys thought the core of your problem is\nisolation like before today\nit sort of fades into my I'll be home\nalone in the future sort of doomed\nmentality so what is the doomed\nmentality and I see mine is just the I'm\nset up to fill in a lot of aspects in\nlife and that in years to come I'll just\nbe in the same spot and won't achieve\nanything okay so I want to I want you\nguys to just think about that for a\nsecond and notice what he's saying right\nso this is exactly what I'm hearing from\ny'all is that the problems are in every\ndimension of your life that's the\ninitial frame that you're doomed in\neverything and you guys we're talking\nabout I think in aa see you men should\nlike giving forty or fifty percent at\nyour best in terms of Education\nyeah and that other people are sort of\nlike we're thinking about therapy we're\nthinking about isolation we're thinking\nabout social anxiety we're thinking\nabout education we're thinking about\nfailure we're thinking about financial\nsecurity it's like every dimension of\nyour life is screwed yeah that's the way\nyou guys pitch it at the beginning\nbecause I think that's the way that it\nfeels to you in your head that\neverywhere you look around it's like the\nworld is a bleak place and that's what a\nDoomer is everywhere you look there's\ndarkness but what I'm actually hearing\nfrom you guys is that this isn't\nactually like sixteen problems and part\nof the reason that it can feel\noverwhelming is because when you look\naround and you see thirty problems that\nis like literally overwhelming you can't\nfix thirty things you can't get a job\nand get an A and get a girlfriend and\nmake $100,000 a year you can't do all of\nthose things and so the other bizarre\nthing about being a Doomer apparently is\nthat I think your feeling of over being\noverwhelmed is not like an illness I\nthink it's just you look around and\nevery part of your life seems to be like\nsort of empty and bleak so you're like\nwell [ __ ] where do I even start\nthat actually is logical it's not yeah\nbut the interesting go ahead so like I\nthink so when we were looking at like\nwhat a dimmer is just like this video\nthat explains it and like that's very\nmuch what the video said it's like it's\nall logical things sort of like the\nhouse essentially like we are today or\nlike how today was set up from the past\nright so like everything like it's not I\nagree that's like a lot of things it's\nnot necessarily like something else but\nother things like kind of like the\nperfect storm when you say it was a\nperfect storm\nit's like these sets of such like\ncircumstances created this right if this\nis the external world yeah yeah so that\nalso like I I'm a little bit confused\nabout because when I asked you guys like\nwho is ultimately responsible so I\nunderstand the framework that you all\nhave laid out\nI understand everything that you guys\nhave I mean I think I do that\nthe external world is problematic and\nstuff like that the problem is that when\nI actually ask you guys about your life\nwhat I hear is not that the rest of the\nworld is a complete mess and things like\nthat what I hear is that I'm\nfundamentally isolated like that's\nthat's what I'm hearing first and\nforemost and also I'm hearing that it's\nnot that the outside world's fault it's\nlike my fault\nI'm gonna throw an idea here and\nRosario's everyone else here agrees but\nit's not so much that like all the\nprevious events of my life have created\nthis moment where now the world's going\nto [ __ ] me it's more like the previous\ninvent my life created me which can't\nsucceed a version of me that can't\nsucceed it was isolated yeah okay so\nthis is excellent right so this is good\nnow we're getting somewhere\nso so the world has turned you into the\nperson that you are and the person that\nyou are is [ __ ] yeah basically is that\na du mer huh\nin a way it is okay well so help me\nunderstand stray cat in what way are we\nwhat are we missing I think a lot of the\ntime people when they say boomer they\nmean someone who like looks at society\nis the issue and what we said but we\nkind of flip that around didn't we yes\nwe did\nthat's my point right so if we can flip\nthis around I wonder what else we can\nflip around that's very exciting\nthat's a very bloomer statement no I\nmean like seriously that's not I'm not\ntrying to so you guys know I tend to be\npositive right\nlike I'm a positive guy but like I\ndidn't come in here and say like oh you\nguys could turn your life around cuz I\ndon't actually know that I don't know\nthat you can maybe you guys are [ __ ]\nright but but what\nI think stray cat put it beautifully and\nthis is this is what this is actually\nwhat's giving me hope is that by talking\nabout this you guys are getting a new\nperspective like that's what I mean\nbecause what y'all are describing is\nfundamentally different from the picture\nof a tumor and that's what stray cat is\nsaying is that is that it's not\nnecessarily the outside world and I\nthink what rune said makes a lot of\nsense that the outside world has turned\nyou into the person that you are today\nand the chances of the person that you\nare today or bleak I'll accept that but\nI still think that if you guys have been\ntrying from a Doomer mindset and you've\nbeen failing from a Doomer mindset and\nyou change the way that you look at the\nworld and you change where agency and\npower lie then I think that there's a\nchance for you to change and it's not\nabout like just putting on a new mindset\nlike yeah like I can do it believe in\nyourself like ah that does that's not\nwhat I'm talking about I'm not saying\nlike adopt a new mindset just because\nthat's what the power of positive\nthinking is I think that that's dumb I\nthink the question is can you\nauthentically look at your life\nunderstand how you got to be this way\nunderstand why you can't move forward\nand then figure out a new strategy that\nis actually authentic for you I think\nthat's the crux of my problem\nspecifically and I talked about this was\nbed with rune so it's like I put\nessentially like I I acknowledge all\nthese things and I was like okay how can\nI move forward\nso when we talking about like financial\nsecurity and like education right and\nthen like coming from and so look at the\nfirst friction first generation\nbackground I had my parents tell me that\nlike oh go to college\nOh be an engineer oh do all these things\nso you have a you have a path forward so\nessentially what happened was I couldn't\ndo what you're suggesting of like the\nauthentic self and put myself on\nautopilot and I feel as if and this is\nwhat the duma comes in is like if i ever\ntry to take control or turn autopilot\nand take control everything like I'm\njust gonna turn everything the [ __ ]\nwhere's my autopilot like has sort of\npaved the way for me so I don't want to\nlose that kind of weight is the\nautopilot a good thing or a bad thing\nnot for me for me chill hold on hold on\nI'm asking other people what do you guys\ntalk about so being or Zil being on\nautopilot I feel very much that I'm on\nautopilot in my education as well I\nthink I can relate when I'm out in\npublic I think it's what gets me through\nlike that moment in time so what do you\nguys think about zil's fear of going off\nof autopilot\nI think he's sorry go ahead go Fortran\noh okay I'm just gonna say I think he's\nprobably because I don't I'm never on\nautopilot I really am very I mean I say\nthat everyone because I'm not on point\nsometimes but often times I try not to\nbe and I think it has given me a lot of\nopportunities through virtue of like\neffort that being another poet wouldn't\nhave given me what do you think about\nand I'm sorry somebody else wanted to\nsay something yeah my autopilot sort of\njust doing what I've always been doing\nin uni and not really straying from that\nand being pushed by my parents to do the\nsame sort of stuff like an education I\njust sort of follow that I I don't know\nif I always give my all but that's sort\nof why it just sounds like you never\ngive your all\npossibly you're the one who said like at\nbest I give 50% your words on uh\nsometimes I try but let's like all I get\nout of it in okay salts okay important\ndistinction okay what do you guys think\nabout zil's being afraid to turn off\nautopilot that's the reason I'm still\ndoing my uni course and stuff otherwise\nI might have ventured off and tried\nother thing Lotus I haven't heard you\nspeak up in a little bit anything that\nyou want to add you don't have to I'm\njust I would like to give you a chance\nto talk if I can I can really kind of\nbecause um I grew up with four\ngeneration parents as well and then I\nwas actually born in Canada but they\nnever really put me into autopilot\nI can't just went with the flow\nthroughout all my life and then I became\nsort of either heavily attached or\naddicted to gaming or just being on my\ncomputer and for me that's my autopilot\nright actually taking time to cook or to\nexercise or so just even in like walk\noutside is already a challenge sometimes\ndepending on how I feel okay can I just\nthink for a second yep how do you guys\nthink this is going by the way it's a\nlittle over the place yep anyone else\nfeel that way\nwe can still tie it all together though\nyeah yeah like like yeah like we can all\ntie\nyeah you can always like loop it back\nyou know because like I think we because\nyou said that like it feels as if like\neverything like everything is sort of\nlike feels overwhelming so like because\nof if we feel like it's everything then\nsomehow it will all tie back together\nyeah so I mean would you guys say that\nthis conversation is almost like a\nreflection of what your life feels like\nyeah yeah yeah neat how that happens huh\nright so like IIIi think stray cat\nthat's an excellent observation so I too\nfeel like it's kind of all over the\nplace I feel like we're talking about a\nlot of different things I'm not quite\nsure if we've made progress so that's\nwhy I'm asking for a few minutes to kind\nof stop and think and and try to figure\nout like how can we put some of this\ntogether in a meaningful way okay yeah\none more minute yeah I'm just not sure\nhow to answer that\nbecause I feel like I'm probably the\nleast dimmer person here I feel like a\ndimmer hat the time yeah they like the\nimmersing that mostly people have called\nme I don't call it myself myself at very\nmuch oh man there's so much here okay\nwhat did you say earlier about you said\nor something earlier about the whole\nmindset of like embracing positivity for\nthe sake of that will make you feel\nbetter on its own accord that that's\nkind of you said something like that's\nwhy I want you to react tick you ate it\nbecause I'm not I didn't run breathing I\nthink the power positive thinking is bad\nyeah so so I I think that there are a\nlot of people who try to be relentlessly\npositive and that's actually incredibly\ntoxic\nso I think that when you when you ignore\nwhat's bad in your life and you just\nfocus on the positive like you know if I\nif I have like a broken arm and I'm like\noh but I still have one arm that works\nand I'm like oh but like look this arm\nworks great like let's just focus on the\nfact let me be thankful for this arm\nbeing functional and it's like if you if\nthat's your strategy in life you're\ngonna go through life with one arm\nyou're not gonna try to fix with a\nbroken right so I and I think it's just\nI I think the the my foundation is not\nto try to be positive it's not to try to\nbe negative it's try to be where you are\nlike be where you are start where you\nare and move from there and whenever you\ntry to like be in a place that you're\nnot which by the way I think is like\nhalf of like some of y'all's problems\nright I mean III think like of anyway\nI'll get there but I think I think I see\ncouple people smiling so I think you\nguys know what I'm talking about so I\nthink I want to start with this like so\nthe promise of a generation so I'm also\nlike a you know my parents were\nimmigrants from South Asian country\nIndia and and so I kind of also feel the\nyou know for those I mean I don't know\nwhere Lotus is from but you know when I\nwas growing up I had a couple of options\nso my dad once told me that like I have\nan older brother he's like one of y'all\nis gonna be a lawyer and one y'all is\ngonna be a doctor and my brother is\nolder and he went to law school so in my\nmed school interviews they're like why\ndo you want to be a doctor and then I'd\nsay well my dad said that what he all\nhas to be a lawyer one a all has to be a\ndoctor and my brother was older and he\ngot to choose first so here I him and\nthen you know they would laugh because\nthat's obviously funny and what they\ndidn't understand is that you know that\nwas actually half the reason I was there\nbut but I I think you know we're so what\nI want to start with is that like our\ngeneration was given a promise right\nthat we were given a promise of like\nsuccess and happiness and we were told\nthat if you follow this formula this is\nhow you will be successful secure and\nhappy in your life and we were told this\nformula with with such finality that you\nwork hard you go to college you get a\njob\nyou leave yeah you you graduate with a\none of these like very specific degrees\nlike you don't major in liberal arts\nyou don't major in art history\nyou know you get yourself like a real\njob like engineering or like CS like CS\nwas sort of like the forefront of like\npeople are like we don't really know if\nthis is gonna work out and then you know\nthe dot-com boom happened in 2000 and\nit's like OCS became oh don't be done\nit's like completely acceptable along\nwith doctor engineer wonderful wonderful\nthat's the good one right so that was\nthat was what happened like we were\ngiven that we were given this path and\nwe were told by our elders that if you\nfollow this path you will be happy in\nlife and it turned out that that's like\nthe biggest scam of that's the biggest\nscam and it's not really their fault and\nthen they get really [ __ ] confused\nbecause they're like I don't understand\nwhy you just don't do what I tell you to\ndo like this is the way to be happy and\nthen you have conflict with them right\nyou're like no but this doesn't make me\nhappy they're like you're dumb you'll be\nhappy when you're 40 just do what I'm\ntelling you to do happiness comes later\nlike you [ __ ] kids trying to be happy\nit's not about happiness you'll be happy\nwhen you're 40 trust me and and that's\nwhat we were told so we were given the\npromise of a generation promise of a\ngeneration turned out to be a lie and I\ndon't really blame them for it I mean I\nused to but I think like that was that\nwas the formula that worked for their\ngeneration like if you wanted to leave\nIndia so my parent my dad grew up in an\n8 by 10 room that had eight people\nliving in it eight people lived in an 8\nby 10 room at nighttime they would pack\nup the kitchen and they would like lay\nout sleeping bags but not sleeping bags\nto put like mats and then one person\nwould sleep outside the door in like the\ndoorway like in the entryway right\nthat's where they grew up\ntheir life was different meaning and\nhappiness were irrelevant it was like\nwe've got to survive because there was\nlike rationing and like you had to stand\nin line for an hour to get like a pound\nof sugar and you could get another pound\nof sugar like a month later\nit's just a different world that they\ngrew up in and so all of these feelings\nbecame very irrelevant because it was\nabout survival and they saw opportunity\nto like come to the United States and\nlike they saw a particular way to do\nthat and they did that and then they\ncould do things like afford cars and\nthen they could do things like buy like\na thousand pounds of sugar for people\nback home and so that was that was what\nthey grew up with I mean I think\nimmigrants is probably a little bit more\nextreme but I think if you look at even\nlike Caucasian people or like Americans\nor Canadians from like 60 years ago is\nthe same way you could support a family\nwith like one income and a bachelor's\ndegree bachelor's degree doesn't get you\n[ __ ] now so the first thing is that I\nthink the biggest problem is that we\nwere led to believe something that is\nactually incorrect and so I think the\nreal challenge here is that we've had to\nfigure out and I don't think anyone has\nreally I mean we're doing this but I\ndon't think anyone has I don't think\nmany people stop and really think a\nlittle bit about the fact that we have\nto find our own way forward in this\nwe're not gonna find an answer from\nsomewhere else because those answers\njust don't work anymore it's like the\ntest has changed so the answer key from\nlike 50 years ago doesn't work anymore\nand what I'm hearing from you guys is\nlike autopilot so what is autopilot it\ncan be a couple of different things\nright like so gaming to manage your\nemotions and things like that but\nessentially like I mean it doesn't\nsurprise me that the best result that an\nAussie has ever gotten is 50% because I\nthink he's doing something something\nthat he gives no shits about and when\nyou take a human being and you make them\nlike give a hundred percent effort for\nsomething that they give no shits about\n50 percent is pretty good right and I I\nhear it from stray cat to that like\nthere is an assumption about how human\nbeings interact and relate to each other\nand she has social anxiety so those\nassumptions don't apply to her she's\nplaying a different game she was also\ntaught like a particular way to socially\nbehave with other people and what what\nyou're supposed to do she was also given\na formula go out make friends say hi to\npeople be more active just get out of\nthe house just get out of the house just\nbe more active\njust get out of it but stray cat just\nget out of the house you'll make friends\nit's the promise of a generation that's\n[ __ ] wrong right the world that we\nlive in is fundamentally different and\nso I think the biggest problem that all\nyou guys have is autopilot you know so I\nmean I'm gonna say biggest like several\ntimes because I think there are several\nbiggest problems so you guys I just so\nthe first thing is that I think you guys\nhave to stop living on autopilot and I\nthat's hard right so when Zil stopped\ntalks about not living on autopilot like\nwhat is the emotion that arises Zil you\ncan't answer by the way okay what is the\nemotion that arises for Zil when you\nstop living on autopilot panic\nabsolutely yeah right that's what's\nholding you back I mean so so stray cat\nwas saying that she has a lack of\ndirection and lacks meaning in her life\nwell let me tell you guys something\nif you major in something that you don't\ncare about and you have a life of thirty\nfive years of a successful career\nspending eight hours a day doing\nsomething that you don't care about your\nlife is gonna be meaningless just how it\nworks\nright you guys are looking for meaning\nin something that you fundamentally give\ntwo shits about so you're not gonna find\nit there now the challenge is like what\nkeeps you guys from moving forward I\nthink it's fear and panic absolutely and\nthis is where we kind of get to this\nwhole conundrum of like is the world the\nproblem or you the problem and I think\nrune put it beautifully that the world\nmakes you into the person that you are\ntoday but now this is where it gets\nreally tricky right because who\ndetermines who you are tomorrow\nI mean that sounds like a feel-good kind\nof answer do you guys actually believe\nthat more half right cuz my response to\nyou I mean I get and I get Lotus that\nthis is dr. K stream and we're supposed\nto be like positive and wholesome and\nhave breakthroughs but like if you\ndetermine who you are tomorrow like why\ndid you end up where you are today right\ndoes that make sense like who determines\nwho you are today if you're saying that\nyou control who you are tomorrow who was\nin control yesterday and how did you end\nup where you are today that doesn't make\nsense to me it's like putting the blame\nright so so hold on a second so now\nstray cat like now we got to be we got\nto be we got to be careful with\nourselves if we have blame then we have\npower you can't have one without the\nother so which is it does that make\nsense to you guys\ncan't have it was it good your turn to\nthink I think that's\nthe blame hurt though is because it's\nlike oh I was in charge if I was I was\nresponsible of the situation and I\n[ __ ] it up okay so then we come back\nto control right so like did you really\n[ __ ] it up usually feels like I do\nuh-uh hold on you do or you did big\ndifference\nare you referencing like\ntoday versus yesterday what do you mean\nyes the distinction absolutely that's\nexactly what I'm referencing I think it\ndepends on I guess how much resilience I\nhave when I wake up in the morning if I\ncan continue to fight that fight you\nknow okay so if you don't have enough\nresilience in the morning whose fault is\nthat I see what do you see help the rest\nof us see room well I think I've I think\nyou're just basically our to Hue\nanything how complicated these kids\nbecause it feels complicated it's like I\nit's it's still my responsibility I\nstill see it like that but that's at the\nsame time maybe give yourself a break\nevery now and then what are the rest\nyou'll think about that I think well\nlike give yourself a break\nlike for me that that feels as if like\noh if I'm giving myself a break\nthen like where the where am i\ndisplacing all that feelings to that's\nsort of like my my internalization of\nlike giving myself a break almost like I\nfeel like when you said like surviving I\nfeel as if in like autopilot like it's\nall connects like I autopilot so I can\nsurvive and so therefore I can't give\nmyself a break it's like I have to like\ndo these things yeah right so that's the\npanic in the fear because unless you\ncontinue living your life like you can\nonly like if you stop going on autopilot\nand you give yourself a break then like\nyou're afraid that the world is gonna\ncome crashing down stray cat said panic\nlike stray cat what do you think what do\nyou think the panic is like can you\ndescribe that for us\num well for me it's like literally a\npanic attack but uh and like a more I'm\nnot charlie it's really just uncertainty\nand like the unknown yeah so what do you\nguys think about like just think about\nthat for a second I mean with the doom\ner this is very different okay\nthe Doomer knows what's happening on the\noutside world the outside world is known\nit's fixed it's given that's why there's\nno hope does that make sense the outside\nworld has been solved for but what you\nguys are describing to me is very\ndifferent it's actually like the unknown\nthat there's there in a sense it's not I\nthink what this means is that there's an\nautopilot you and the autopilot you is\nthe Doomer and the autopilot you like\nlooks into the future and knows that\nthere is no hope for you and then\nthere's another part of you that\nunderstands that there is another\noutside world there that is uncertain\nand unknown but you guys are all\nactively choosing to go on autopilot and\npick the dimers world what do you think\nabout that\nyeah I think it relates to one part of\nmy life especially like in my education\nI've always just listened to what my\nparents say when I ask for help like I'm\nalways uncertain if I should keep going\nbut then I think of or if I stop doing\nthis course and go to something else\nI've never done this sort of I've always\nbeen sort of doing IT my whole life so\nthat's what I'm going into but if I'm\nbeing completely honest I feel like\nsomething else would be better but the\nuncertainty stops me from trying of\ndoing anything other than what I'm\ncurrently going down yeah so how much\nlike who here is living with unser is\nliving with Dakshina is afraid of living\nwith uncertainty right or like other\npeople do you guys feel similar to an\nAussie in the sense that there's another\npath that you could walk but you're\nterrified of what'll well like what's at\nthe end of that path because you don't\nknow how so\nLotus let's say even if I did you know\npursue your culinary arts or whatever\nelse in post-secondary even if it did\ncomplete all of that I don't know what I\nwould do is that afterwards I don't know\nlike I don't know out of all the paths\nthat I can take I don't know where any\nof it will lead me to how do you live\nwith that how do you live with\nuncertainty strike at what do you think\nhow do you deal with your panic I kind\nof don't it it feels like it takes\ncontrol of me instead mm-hmm so I tend\nto just avoid things that cause that\npanic in the first place yeah so it's\nkind of living without really doing\nanything yeah so I avoid things that\ncause the panic in the first place that\nis the [ __ ] definition of autopilot\nbecoming an engineer right what your\nwhole lives guys are built around the\navoidance of uncertainty of the road\nthat you have not locked and the problem\nhere is that when you look at the road\nthat you are walking you see doom and\ngloom at the end of it and the thing is\nthat's not a cognitive bias it's not\nbecause you guys are [ __ ] depressed\nit's because you guys are smart it's\nbecause every step along that road has\nbeen doom and gloom and then you're like\nI've been getting 50% like you know\ngoing back to annecy he's been given\ntrying really hard and the best he can\ndo is 50% and he's like if I continue\nstudying an IT the most I'm ever gonna\nbe able to get is 50% and so you look at\na life and it's it's a Doomer because\nthe best you could if you give a hundred\nall you're gonna get is 50 that is a bad\nworld to live in\nbut then we kind of circle back and we\nlike we think about this for a little\nbit and we see that there are a couple\nof core things the first is the\navoidance of uncertainty the fear of\nlike what is the world gonna look like\nand that's a reasonable fear - we can\nkind of get into how that is how that\nworks and then there's also like a\ncouple of other things which I can't\nhaven't been able to quite tie together\none is like what the sense of isolation\nis and the third is yeah a sense of how\ndid you get to be here and who's\nresponsible for be like where you are\nnow and who's responsible for what\nhappens in the future and you guys want\nto say that you're responsible but the\nmore I kind of like chip away at that it\nseems like you guys aren't actually so\nsure right and this goes back to like\nwhat rune was saying about being\nresilient he's like depends on how I\nresilient I am that day and I was like\nokay well what determines how resilient\nyou are like whose fault is that right\nso the first thing so let's like think\nabout so are those are those like three\ntopics that we can try to dig into does\nthat sound reasonable do you guys think\nthose are like worthwhile things to talk\nabout\nyeah cuz like if I see it as like sort\nof like a like a mom bro like those all\nthose three things fall under the\numbrella like the doom are kind of yeah\nyeah but I think it's more than one\nthing so I think there's uncertainty\nabout the road not taken' there's the\nsecurity of being on autopilot that's\none thing second thing is like what's\ngoing on with isolation and the third\nthing is like who is responsible for\nyour life\nnow the next thing I'm going to ask you\nguys is I see I sense a subtle change in\nthis group how do you guys feel right\nnow\nin a different way from the beginning\nyou know I'm actually a little less\nnervous to me events so what do you feel\nnervous about stray cat um just being on\nstream really okay so you feel a little\nless nervous but essentially the same\nquality of nervousness yeah and I see\nhow do you feel you don't know what are\nyou doing right now smiling why right so\nyou were smiling before I asked you how\nyou're feeling did you notice that no\nokay\nyou've been smiling for a little while\nnow any idea why that is I mean now\nyou're smiling coz maybe you feel\nembarrassed and you just noticed you're\nsmiling but yeah maybe because we're\ngetting somewhere\nis that what you think actually that's\nnot the right question is that how you\nfeel\nyeah I think with the three topics it\nsort of hits right well the things I\ndon't do you do you know how to describe\nwhat you're feeling right now really\ndoes anybody else have a sense of when\nthey look at when you guys look at an\nAussies face what do you think he's\nfeeling I think you've having a good\ntime yeah and I see how many\nI told you that maybe school is not\nwhere you should be\nI've brought that into because I feel\nlike a lot of people figure a lot of\npeople tell you oh so I know and now see\nand stray so I'm familiar with the stuff\nthey talk about so fight if I'm like if\nI'm asserting some things that's why is\nbecause we talked about it before but it\nwas like I know kind of feels like an\nAussie is told a lot of times just just\nwork harder at school just do school\nmore oh god that sounds like a terrible\nidea to me yeah just work harder is like\nthe worst strategy in the universe like\nit's like telling stray cat and just\nleave the house more just get on it like\nde precios not that bad just get out of\nbed jump out of bed I once had someone\ntell me that their solution to\ndepression was to jump out of bed not\nget out of bed leap out of bed and they\nsaid that if I can leap out of bed that\nmy depression is cured you should tell\nyour patients to jump out of bed\nthat's like alright man I'll do that\nit's [ __ ] dumb advice it's not how it\nworks trying harder so if at first you\ndon't succeed don't try try again if at\nfirst you don't succeed try it a\ndifferent way like you know I mean\nanyway that don't get me started on\nranting on another topic so let's let's\ntalk about uncertainty isolation and\nagency okay these are our three topics\nso let's kind of bang them out so we're\ngonna be a little bit more quick about\nthem so when you guys think about\nuncertainty like what do you think would\nhappen to your life if you started\ntaking the road that you're uncertain\nwhere it leads it's scary to think\nwhat's scary fulfilling\nscary about it we'll get to in\nrelentless positivity in a second so\nlike okay if I can't provide like a\ngamer analogy so it's like I put a\nlittle bit of dota so it's like who\nmakes like the guys for dota I forgot\nwho but like it's like if I play DotA\nit's like okay I know that I want to do\nwell so dota life right I'll make those\nanalogies right okay so I'll follow this\nguide\nhence the guy is sort of like the\nboomers talking down it's like hey just\nget these items and then get do this\nitem path you'll be fine right and so\nit's like okay I'll just follow this\nguide and see if I can win the dota\nmatch but and then like to think too\nlike veer away like sure this other guys\nlike to think that's like I can choose\nmy own items and play how I want I don't\nknow if it's gonna give me the same\nresults and so like that I have\nexperienced already the autopilot so I'm\ngonna I'm gonna give you sort of like\nI'm gonna modify your analogy a little\nbit okay so let's say you're playing\ndota so like what position do you play\nand donut so I always played support\nokay so I like playing support too so\nlike let's say that someone says like if\nyou want to win games like someone says\nlike here's how you win game a game of\ndota you play anti-mage you farm for 45\nminutes and then you go 27 oh and 15 and\nthey say this is the way to play yeah\nand then what happens is is you play\nanti-mage right there guy like you look\nat their guide and their guide is\nspot-on\nthey're like you're like wow and they're\nlike look if you want to just if you\nwant to see it happen you don't have to\nlook at my guide like just look at like\nlook at our TZ streaming and just watch\nhim do it like look at all these hard\ncarries like they [ __ ] own the games\nthey win like millions of dollars using\nthis strategy so you should use it too\nand then what happens when you play\nanti-mage though I tell my teammates so\nmuch yeah you know why you tilt your\nteammates cuz I'm probably bad at it\nabsolutely I'm like not doing what our\nT's is doing absolutely so I follow the\nguide I play a team agent I [ __ ] get\nowned\nI'm oh eight and fifteen at the end of\nthe game and then the the guy comes back\nand he's like dude you just got to\nfollow the guide man just follow the\nguide but your experience is causing you\nto like lose\nmm our Alec game after game after game\nyou're getting crushed what happens when\nyou play support he goes back up or like\nit's like it's more like one more\nenjoyable because I know I'm doing I\nguess so like following guys I think\nit's like I'm used to it but those are\nall like different also things too but\ngenerally the feeling is that I find\nthat hey I play better the feeling is\nthat you fit played bad when oh sorry\nphew if I play support I play better\nyeah you play better yeah\nand it's more fun yeah so so this is\nwhat you guys have to understand about\nlike the promise of a generation which\nis that it's it's a lie right like it's\nnot that it's like a pure lie it's just\nthat like I think your analogy was\nbeautiful though because it's like\nthey're giving you a guide for like a\nstrategy and a character that you do not\nwant to play and when you try to play\nthat character you find that you suck at\nit and and then the problem here is that\nyour whole life you've been playing so\nlike imagine you're playing dota and\nyou've never played before and like\nyou've never played support all you've\nbeen doing is like following anti-mage\nguides and you think that good dota is a\nshitty game because all you ever do is\nfirst pick anti-mage that's what your\nlife is like because all you've been\ndoing is picking antimage you've never\ngiven yourself the chance to like pick a\ndazzle or a lion or like an Oracle or\nwhatever like you haven't actually tried\nlike it because you're like butBut how\nam I supposed to carry a game with\nOracle like the guide says I have to go\n27 and no I've watched our TZ stream but\nlike how am I supposed to like win a\ngame with the support like I can't I\ncan't build like how does that even work\nand so your your your minds ability to\neven consider what is down the road of\nuncertainty like you can't even think\nabout you can't calculate it but it\ndoesn't mean that there isn't like lots\nof success possible that's just you have\nno idea how to predict it which is\nbecause you've never played a game as a\nsupport so then the next question is so\nfor Zil and sorry if this is a little\nbit dota specific will get more general\nbut so still like what do you\nlike what do you think about uncertainty\nnow like what's the solution to fearing\nthe uncertainty of your life oh I've\nbeen a lot introspection and like I had\nactually have not been able to answer\nthat or asked myself that question so\nit's like like a wall up for me first of\nall well I'll give you a quick answer a\nquick hint you're not gonna find the\nanswer through introspection right like\nif I'm a dota player so I'll ask you in\nanother way if I'm a dota player and I\nkeep on losing playing antimage and I\nsuck at it and I'm like losing and\nlosing and losing and losing and losing\nyou guys understand what I'm talking\nabout like even if you don't know who\nanti-mage's clear League yeah okay so\nlike you know so it's like ADC it's like\nthe way you win a game League as you\npick an ADC and then you just go 27 and\noh and then you pick an ADC and then you\ngo oh and it so what do you do like if\nlike so let's steer clear of suicide\nokay boys and girls so I'm asking you so\npractically Zil if I was playing dota\nfor the first time and I played 50 games\nof anti-mage and I won two of them and I\nsay this game sucks what is the\npractical advice you would tell me try a\ndifferent hero absolutely but then I\ncome to you and I say is but Zil like I\ndon't know how to win a game with that\nother hero my yes like but the Accademia\nis like I could deem assign means like\nwell just play the rest of the games and\nsee and compare the the win rates\nbetween the 250 game samples is that\nwhat you would tell me you tell me to\nplay another 50 games as an T major or\nas a support as like the the new role\nand but I say but but I may not win I\ncould lose dil what would you say\nmy gut reactions like just try and like\nthat's sort of like I don't know like\nthat's like disingenuous I feel like\nit's like I know that they want to win\nthe game but it's like you got try what\nwhat what is trying do gives you more\ninformation to see if you're good at the\nnew role that you're playing that's it\nman that's it\nright that's exactly what you need to do\nyou need more information about the road\nthat you have not taken because you're\nlike I don't remember if you're studying\nengineering or what but like I don't\nknow what you're studying or what career\npath you're on but like the basic\nproblem is that you've been following\nthe anti-mage guide and what you need to\ndo is play a few games is other things\nto see if you like it or see if it\noffers any chance of success and\nunderstand that when you play a new game\nyou're actually gonna be worse at it\nthan what you're doing now I guess like\nfrom a professional career like\nfollowing the anti-mage guide kind of\ndid work so like sure but I have other\nproblems or I have like other facets\nthat that analogy can definitely apply\nto you so yeah yeah what do you guys\nthink about like I don't know how much\nof this conversation y'all have been\nable to follow but all of it I'm on the\nsame page rune can you explain to me\nwhat we just talked about yeah basically\nif something is if you're unhappy with\nyou want it say it with the analogy or\nyou want without the analogy please okay\ndo you so basically if you are unhappy\nwith the way the strategy that you're\napplying to your own life or whatever\nyou're doing in your daily life if\nyou're unhappy with that you have to be\nwilling to go out on a limb [ __ ] up and\nget dominated which is the league\nanalogy you have to we want to fail and\nlearn how to do something that you will\nenjoy more\nwhat do you think about that it's worked\nfor me I do music so I spent a lot of\ntime like writing and producing music\nI've been doing it for like three years\nnow and in the past like three months\nI've decided to put more effort and more\nenergy into it and a little bit less\neffort into like school and it has its\nown like hardships but it's way more\nfulfilling what do other people think\nabout what rune just said sounds pretty\ngood what sounds good about it Lotus\nthat's you're finding something that's\nnew and fulfilling and that sounds like\nyou want to keep pursuing it so I want\nto just be a little bit clearer I don't\nthink that it was new and fulfilling so\nthis is an important distinction okay\nthis is part of the problem that gets us\nstuck we think something is new and\nfulfilling rune when you started music\nwas it new and fulfilling no I was\nconfusing and weird so would you say\nthat the less new it got the more\nfulfilling it became absolutely not\nin fact I think the more I stuck with it\nthe more fulfilling it's gotten okay I\nthink that's what I asked you but that's\nokay so basically is when it's new it's\nnot fulfilling and the more that you\nexplore it at the beginning gets [ __ ]\nconfusing and weird and you don't know\nwhat you're doing but fulfillment\ndoesn't come at the beginning it comes\nat the end yeah and there's a period of\ntime that has confusion and weirdness\nyeah right so like let's just think\nabout that when we're thinking about\nalternatives so this is where we kind of\nget into expectations and and fantasies\nand stuff like that there's this other\nidea that the Boomers give us that if\nyou try something you'll like it\nright they say like oh just go out and\nlike meet new people everything will be\nfine no it's gonna be [ __ ] awkward\nand awful that's not what they tell you\nthey tell you they say exactly what\nLotus said oh I should try something\nthat's new and fulfilling nobody you\nshould try something that's new and\ndifficult and awkward and overtime if\nyou're lucky it will become fulfilling\nand if you're unlucky then what do you\ndo now let me ask you guys something\nis what I'm was what we're talking about\nnow just try no it's about experiencing\nand learning right so like how is what\nI'm what we're talking about different\nfrom just go out and try something new\nor is it the same no there's more\nlenient in it and more like you don't\nhave to stick to it and keep trying you\ncan just find what fits I I think like\nthe like the education part right cuz\nlike you can try something but not have\nany sort of like wanting of education\nbut when you told me it's like you\nshould try something else to figure it\nout or like to learn something to me\nthat's like educating myself on this\ntopic so I can try and educate and I\nthink there's also a difference between\njust trying like I think that's how you\nhow you explain it right like I'm asking\nyou guys it's I don't care what I\nbelieve the question is what do you guys\nthink if I were to if I had started this\nand you guys were saying oh yeah I don't\nlike what I'm doing and I said just try\nsomething else is that the same as where\nwe are now right so what are the key\nthings so stray cat and and Zillah\nmentioned a couple of things right it\nchanges the perception around why you're\ntrying the just try is try for the goal\nof success\nbut now what what I think stray cat said\nit really well there's leniency in this\nthere's a presumption of failure there's\na presumption of [ __ ] up and there's\na presumption that the goal here is a\nthis is enough is own the goal is\nactually not to succeed what is the goal\nto learn absolutely so I think the\nproblem is that nasi wants to get a\nhundred on something that he loved\nrelating to school I think it's got to\nbe something that he gives a [ __ ] about\nright like that's like there's no way\nyou're gonna get a hundred if you don't\ncare about what you do and this is where\nyou know we were there that we've\ntouched on meaning and fulfilment and it\nsounds like rune has found some degree\nof fulfillment in music and that's also\nhow it works it's like you find\nfulfillment in playing the position of\nthe game that you enjoy and the problem\nis that we have all these guides telling\nus that if we want to win you should\nplay this position and that too is kind\nof interesting because if you look at\nthe game of life there are some\nsuccesses that are so much more\nnoticeable that people can point to them\nright and like for like the MOBA players\nlike think about this for a second the\nreason that the anti-mage is 27 and or\nthe reason that your ADC is having a\nwonderful game is because of like a\nsupports warding a supports position but\nnone of that no boomer can point to that\nand tell you that that's the reason that\nthat like that's not what you see right\ndoes that make sense that some paths to\nsuccess or subtle and difficult to\ndetect but the problem is that we get\nbiased by the overnight success stories\nwe get biased by like the so-and-so who\nlike became an investment banker and was\nyour colleague and you guys were you\nguys were neighbors and now he's so\nsuccessful and now you're a piece of\n[ __ ] and he's married and he's going on\na hunting like we look at some successes\nand we try it but we don't realize that\nthere are equally good successes that\nare just hard to detect and subtle and\nthat your path in life isn't going to\nlook like the fantasy that you come up\nwith in your mind so it's my fastest\nsuccess basically and trying something\nnew until I find the right thing for me\nfor example ask these guys I don't know\nthe answer that question what do you\nguys think he keeps mentioning : arey\nyou said that a few times I mainly\nswitch out of that because even course\nare telling me that maybe it's not a\nmaybe it's not something that suits me\nor maybe I'm not like cut out for it is\nit something that you're proud of or\njust something you actually enjoy it was\na little bit of both until I realized\nhow stressful it became and at the end\nof the day it's like it doesn't pay as\nmuch as I would like it to so what do\nyou guys do\nLotus should do he's 21 right\nare you America I'm I kinda in Canada I\nworked as a chef for a little bit and I\nhated it made the decision to stop but I\nalso was really bad at it and didn't\ncare about it so I think it kind of\nmatters how much do you care about it\nand how much do you want money so my\nplan right now\nshe just go back to school for trades\nprogram was just like completely\ndifferent right and the idea is to\nactually you just try it out see how it\nworked\nsee how I like it if I don't like it so\nI want to offer just a little bit of\nadvice here so the other thing that I\nwant you guys to understand is that so I\nthink going back and getting a trade\ngetting trained in a trade is like a\ngood idea but I want you guys to\nunderstand that getting trained in a\ntrade or going back to school is not the\ncareer that you're gonna do for the rest\nof your life like do you guys know what\nmy job is kind of funny question what's\nmy job what do I do you like a couple\nthings right it's like hi 'try faculty\nwhat is this\nthis is what I'm passionate about\nyeah is this what I trained to do\nexactly so understand that what what you\nso fulfilling a certain financial\nsecurity is one thing finding work that\nyou find fulfilling is something else\nso Lotus I think if you want to get a\ntrade degree and like get a job that\npays pretty well like an HVAC or\nsomething like that like by all means go\nfor it but don't stop there and\nunderstand what you're getting into is\nnot necessarily a fulfilling career that\nyou have some financial needs and that\nlike you should continue looking for the\nthings that make you happy I mean that\nover time so I do believe that the world\nrewards just from a Darwinian or\nevolutionary perspective people who\nreally really care about stuff because I\nthink the world is filled with people\nlike an Aussie who give two shits about\ntheir job and produce 50% quality work\nand so it's up every now and then\nsomeone comes along who genuinely cares\nabout what they do and there's like\nfinancial reward in that that's my\ngeneral belief in observation\nso I'd say for lotus-like you guys also\nhave to understand that fixing your life\nis gonna be a series of like missteps\nright but you have to take the step that\nlike you gotta take now so if you want\nto get like a a trade degree by all\nmeans go for it but don't assume for a\nsecond that the fulfillment that rune\ngets for making music is going to come\nfrom that it may come from that you\ncould end up being lucky but your\njourney does not stop there that's the\nother big lie that the boomers taught us\nwhich is that your education is your\ncareer and your career should be\nenjoyable and fulfilling like I don't\naccept that for a second\nlike I think careers can change wildly\nand that what you find fulfillment from\nis something that you should work on and\nthen like the other good thing that\nboomers like I don't agree with it all\nis that like boomers think that you\nshould have like a job and then you\nshould have hobbies no I think the world\nis quickly becoming a place where your\nhobbies are worth just as much as a job\nand what I mean by that is the barriers\nto publication or lower so like you have\nsolo dudes who will like create video\ngames and put them on Steam and will\nmake tons of money from it because\nthat's what they care about and they\nhave a job that whole time you have\npeople who work like you know overnight\nshifts at hotels and like write books\nbecause that's what they care about\nthat's what I think you guys should do\nif you need to do some kind of work in\nthe meantime like the reason I'm a\npsychiatrist is because I have to\nsupport a family I love talking to\ngamers that's what I love doing and this\nis also where right now I think the real\nproblem is that you guys gravitate and\nI'm sorry if I'm not getting to the\nother topics but I feel like preaching\nis that okay is that that's fine go for\nmy dude okay so I think the other thing\nis that you guys really have to think a\nlittle bit about you know right now\nyou're avoiding pain and seeking\npleasure but the way for you guys to\nlike study hard and even if it sucks is\nfor you to have studying be in service\nto another goal so like if an Aussie\nsays okay I want to like write you know\na fantasy fiction novel\nand in order to do that I have to\nsupport myself for some time I think\nthen his ability to study is gonna be\nway better does that make sense like\nI've got to support myself for some way\nwhile I like figure out what I want to\ndo but the problem is that right now\nschool is the goal for you guys it's not\na means your job is the goal it's not a\nmeans and it's a goal that you guys\ndon't care about so you're not gonna\ngive your best so I think you could get\na job by all means be financially\nindependent but understand that the the\nfinancial independence is just money so\nthat you can actually get on to living\nthe life that you want does that make\nsense\nquestions yes like the question I have\nit's like if we acknowledged I like the\nthe fulfilling the fulfillment and then\nlike the money like the financial\nsecurities are two different things then\nlike we're like the boomers isn't like\nreaction like remembers reaction to each\nindividual thing right\nor is it like do they just lump them\ntogether the boomers don't care about\nfulfillment like that's the basic\nproblem so I think like they lived in a\nday in time where like the stress on our\nmind and what we care about and stuff\nlike that it's changed something has\nchanged within humanity like over the\nlast 20 or 30 years I don't quite know\nwhat it is but fulfillment has become\nway more important I think there's a\nreason why there's been an explosion of\nyoga across the world and it's I think\nbecause people are looking for more\npeace and harmony and fulfillment and I\nthink part of that is probably because\nlike the clothes so what's actually I\njust maybe figured it out you guys know\nwhat Maslow's hierarchy of needs is\nmmm-hmm so like fifty years ago or a\nhundred years ago where were we on\nMaslow's hierarchy of needs as a society\nsurvive absolutely right so that's at\nthe bottom where are we now\nis the factorization absolutely right so\nautomation lab-grown food the universal\nbasic income belonging huh see all love\nand belonging you know what you guys\ntalk about so but my point is that like\nI think the stresses on humanity are\nchanging we're like we're not the things\nthat you we used to worry about her and\nlike we're closer to the top like\nshelter and stuff is like you know\nyou're for the most part isn't like as\nbig of a problem infant mortality a\nhundred years ago was like twenty\npercent just think about that you know\nlike not many kids died now and that's\nwhat they used to worry about and like\nnow the closer we are towards the top\nthe more like the things that we have to\nworry about become mental so the boomers\njust don't understand that and it's not\ntheir fault it's just we're living in a\ndifferent world so I got a run in about\nfifteen minutes so I'm gonna give you\nguys a choice do you guys want to talk\nabout isolation or agency I say\nisolation isolation so let's talk about\nit what what makes you feel isolated its\nloneliness having no friends okay so\nlet's think about this for a second okay\nso if you have no friends let me just\nthink for a second about how to try to\ndo something substantive in 15 minutes\nabout this I have two friends they're in\nhere yeah so do you feel I so let's just\nthink about that for a second how how\nmuch do online relationships matter um\nto me like it means a lot but for like\nyour average person who goes outside has\nreal friends I don't know do you think\nthat you don't have real friends no like\nno okay so buy real friends you don't\nmean like authentic friends you mean\nlike physical friends yeah\nI'm just thinking for a second what do\nyou think it is that makes you feel\nisolated for the other folks I spend\nlike all my time home alone okay\nwhenever a lot of unis it's I don't have\na job and even throughout school I'd\npremature always just come home play\ngames by myself just in my room it's\npretty much where well hold on are you\nplaying single-player games no normally\nmultiplayer but alone okay hmm I think\nthis may take more than 15 minutes\nunfortunately are - yeah I guess so\nI mean I I think I want to do this\njustice and I'm just not seeing I think\nthis is a whole different issue you know\nlike I don't think this is actually\nrelated to the like what we've been\ntalking about for an hour and a half I\nmean it's may be related but I think\nit's it's it's own thing like how I tied\nins like for me le it's like the\nautopilot also drove into the isolation\nwhere it's like okay in the autopilot\nlike algorithm it's like being alone is\nfine but like that's how I programmed my\nautopilot right mm-hmm\ncertainty of like Oh what if I let if I\nopen myself up right like what happens\nso it's like that's how I tie it yeah so\nI think we have to you guys know like\nhow you know going out and trying new\nthings as sort of a conclusion we came\nto but we didn't just say just try new\nstuff right there's like a different way\nof understanding like walking the road\nof uncertainty I think we have to do the\nsame thing with isolation it's not it's\nnot as simple as saying just go out and\nmake friends I think it's understanding\nand I just don't I don't I don't\nunderstand it so I don't understand what\nit is that makes you guys feel isolated\nand you guys are giving me some really\ngood answers but I think actually\nthere's more to it so I I think that the\nproblem isn't just that you know don't\nknow people I think the problem is that\nwhen you meet or a problem is that when\nyou meet people you can't show them who\nyou are and there's no point in like\ngoing out and being fake like that's not\nlike even if you guys have friends or\nhanging out with people I think if you\ncan't show them who you are it's still\nisolating so that their their different\nperspective their different layers to\nthis that I'm picking up right now I\njust I want to do it justice and I just\ndon't think we can do that in like\nanother five to ten minutes but so\napologies for that guys I've noticed\nsomething on the server i lurk around\nthe healthy gamer discord sometimes and\nthis seems like a really common theme on\nthe server actually just people who\ndon't have a whole lot of like real life\nconnections and you asked earlier\nwhether or not like online friends and\nreal life friends can be you know if\nthey're the same value I think they can\nbe but I think often times there's\nsomething about being in a room with\nsomeone that really isn't fully\nreplaceable\nI completely agree\nso I'll give you guys so in the last\nfive to ten minutes I'll give you guys a\nchance to ask questions or anyone have\nlike kind of closing thoughts or let's\nstart with actions so I had a question\nabout Lake back to like like the dota\nstuff where it's like like say it's like\noh I can't\nit's like my thing right it was like oh\nthey were winning because an item is\nbroken like like their success like the\nDoomer mentality where it's like oh\nthey're doing well not because they'd\nfall on the guy but it's like oh that\nitems broken or like that characters\nbroken like would that follow under the\nnoumic mentality kind of because it's\nlike it's not putting anything on you\nbut like something else something\nexternal I don't I don't quite follow\nyour analogy but my instinct isn't not\nreally I don't know that that's the\nBoomer mentality or you saying do I do\nme do me do me\nyeah so I think that that is so here's\nwhat I'm hearing you saying so I think\nthis kind of actually goes back to\nagency and like who's responsible and I\nthink a lot of times people attribute\nother people's successes to\ncircumstances and and I think that\nthat's not I mean some some of that's\ntrue right so some people have more\nadvantages than you do in life and so\nthey have a leg up and that's true is\nthat fair no is it equal no but I think\ngenerally speaking when someone talks\nabout something being dopey that's ego\nmore than anything else right that's\nlike you don't want to it like you don't\nwant to look at your own shortcomings\nand you want to just simplify and\nprotect yourself from where you fall\nshort so you call something dopey but\nyou know if you just think about it in a\nvideo game when someone calls something\nOpie what they really mean is this\nperson is beating me and I can't accept\nthat the reason that they're beating me\nis because they're playing better so\ninstead what I'm gonna say is that\nthey're ropey right that item is Opie\nand I mean sometimes things are Opie but\nyou know I think for the most part like\nif you're thinking in the mentality of\nyou know someone else has like an\nadvantage over you and that's the reason\nthey're successful like I think that\nthat's not really a it's not a\nproductive way of thinking whether it's\nright or whether it's wrong it just\ndoesn't help you because the issue is\nlike what do you have right and how do\nyou get to where you want to go\nand and sometimes you have to come up\nwith an unorthodox strategy to like move\nforward in your own life which i think\nis unfortunate because the boomers had a\nformula like that's the other big thing\nno one gave us like there's no formula\nfor us because this is new like the the\nepidemic of loneliness is like new like\nhuman beings used to hang out because we\ndidn't have technology to separate us\nlike we just you know now it's like\nbetween ubereats and like grocery\ndelivery and all kinds of other stuff\nlike I never have to leave my I can live\nin the middle of it a million people and\nnever see any of them and so I think\npart of the challenge is that we have to\nfigure out how we're gonna move forward\nand that's gonna happen from hopefully\nconversations like this cuz I don't have\nall the answers guys like you guys know\nI mean you guys know what it's like to\nbe in your shoes and and you guys have\nto help each other out because I don't\nknow I mean I'm in a different stage of\nmy life and you all need to help each\nother out in terms of figuring out like\nhow do you deal with isolation I'm not\nsure but I think we should continue to\ntalk about it I'm happy to play referee\nbut you all have to be the ones that\nplay the game other questions and we're\ntalking about the whole guy going out on\na limb and trying to new things and\nfailing and learning I feel like like\nover my I've been doing music since I\nwas like eight but I had took I've been\ntaking it more seriously for the past\nfew years and over that time it there's\na lot of moments or like I almost quit\nor almost gave ups and like this is I'm\nawful at this I'm just terrible at this\nI just hate everything I make go make a\nsong and then the next day I'll be like\nthis is the worst thing I've ever heard\nin my life and I think that comes on\ndown to a lot of like just\ndisproportionate self-love it\nself-loathing and it's something I still\nstruggle with and I don't I haven't\nreally found like a good way to deal\nwith it other than just to stop thinking\nabout that and go to the next song make\nCeline do you have any you like no\ninsight yes and no so I think you've\nfigured out the most important solution\nso I don't know if you guys I mean so\npeople think that I'm good at what I do\non stream and like I was a really bad\ntherapist for like three years and I\nreally started to become a better there\nit's not even therapy I started become a\nbetter therapist when I stopped doing\ntherapy so literally what happened is\nlike I would I got taught a certain way\nto do therapy and then I was bad at it\nand and I think that what you said is\nactually the most important thing which\nis to like don't let the way that you\nfeel about your performance affect\nwhether you try again right whether you\ntry again shouldn't be determined by\nyour performance it should be determined\nby your passion towards the subject like\ndon't just keep trying I mean it's fine\nto quit I think it's it's good to quit\nbut quit for the right reasons quit\nbecause you actually don't care about it\ndon't quit it's something because you're\nbad\nthis cycle every single time for me is\nlike I'll make something I like it for\nlike two hours and then and then I hate\nit I don't do any music for like 24\nhours and then I hear something that I'm\nlike holy [ __ ] that's beautiful and I\nhave to go do that oh he likes a new\nartist and like a new song out or\nsomething so it's like this like that\ninspiration that passion comes back and\ndrives me to do it again yeah so so what\nI hear there is that there's something\ninside you that longs to create music\nand like you said there's a some scar or\nlike you know ball of self-loathing that\ncomes out and likes to play from time to\ntime\nand understand that that ball of\nloathing is not actually you it's just a\nball of self-loathing that has built up\nover years and years and years as you've\nbecome like a Doomer you know some of\nthe time and and that's how it works so\nI want you guys to understand that the\nself-loathing that you have for yourself\nis not really the real you it's just\nlike up later than a cognitive pattern\nin your mind you know like when you get\na song stuck in your head and the song\njust kind of randomly pops up and like\nplays on autopilot for a while and then\nrandomly goes away\nthat's like a feeling of like\nself-loathing literally functions like\nthat\nit pops up there are times where you're\nfeeling okay and then the self-loathing\njust pops up and it's like hey you\n[ __ ] suck at life uh and then you\nfeel that way for a while and for some\npeople it's longer and for some people\nit's less and then it kind of leaves\nyour mind for a while and then you're\nkind of living and you're feeling good\nabout yourself you're able to get out of\nbed and that song pops up in here oh you\nsuck at life right so it just because\nthese we have these cognitive things\nthat exist within our mind doesn't mean\nthat they're they're true they're not\ncorrect it doesn't mean you actually\nsuck at life and so just notice that\nthat self-loathing arises and like\nnotice when it's there and noticed this\nis part of the pattern and take some\ncomfort in the fact that that's gonna go\naway and your inspiration will return so\nI think you're well on the right path\ngood could be here so I'm just gonna ask\npeople kind of for closing thoughts so\nwhat I'd love to hear is a little bit\nabout you know how you found the session\nand and if you learned something I'd\nlove to hear what that was if you felt\nlike there are things that you'd still\nlike to explore I'd love to hear what\nwhat that is as well so I think we can\nmaybe just go around the room\noh is that me starting sure um as far as\nlearning something I don't know it's\nreally just more a reflection of things\nthat I've kind of thought or guessed at\nmyself but uh hearing it from other\npeople I don't know it kind of confirms\nit\nI don't trust in my opinion as much as\nI'd say I trust in others\nexcellent point it's very nice to be\nable to sorry but you go you go I'm just\ngonna I'm kind of building on what\nStrait said it's really nice to be able\nto go into the nuances of these things\nin a setting where everyone is on the\nsame page already and it there's like a\nnice feeling of support I think just\nfrom that alone yeah like like you said\nlike because it's we're talking I like\nnuanced things like the Dumon mentality\ncan go so in-depth into these nuanced\nthings and so I guess like the\nrealization of like how much of like if\nyou said loneliness is a problem and\nlike all these like factors but in terms\nand I acknowledge that and in terms of\nsort of like the steps to go on a path\nof quote-unquote fixing it or dealing\nwith it I learned that's like I need to\nset myself in situations where I should\ntry not to look at like the success or\nfailure part but more of the learning\nand teaching part and things I try I\nreally\nthe phrase set myself in situations so I\nthink that goes to the balance we are\nstill haven't teased apart about what is\nthe environment responsible for and what\nare you responsible for right so like\nwhat I like about that is it's not like\nall you or all the environment it's not\nthat the item is opie it's not that you\nsuck at the game it's that there's a\nthere's an environment person\ninteraction and the better you set that\nup the more likely you are the more\noptimistic it sounds like you're gonna\nfeel so we can get to that maybe next\ntime better and ah see next time yeah\nit's pretty much the same what everyone\nelse said but the one thing I'd want to\ngo in tomorrow's isolation okay it's\ndefinitely a big thing for me what about\nwhat the other people said kind of\nresonates with you just being able to\nbounce off ideas and how are we all same\nin different aspects okay thanks for\nsure and lotus-eyed say that like it's\nreally reassuring to hear that whenever\nI fall into a cycle of feeling all these\nnegative thoughts and feeling very\npessimistic and not wanting to camera\nfed I don't have to leap out of the bed\nimmediately and try to just you know man\nup and like take it all head-on it's\nokay to sort of take it one step at a\ntime and you know all of this socially\nI'm gonna get a sauce with dissipate and\nmaybe I'll start feeling better over\ntime it's not some instant\ntransformation yeah very well set I\nthink like change in growth and progress\nis not like I think the other thing that\nI'm glad Lotus it sounds like you're\ngiving yourself a lot of time right so\nthat's the other big thing which I love\nit if you guys could take aways that\ngive yourselves time to build the life\nthat you want it's not like you're gonna\nswitch majors and you're gonna be happy\nit's it's like exactly what rune said\nthat he made music and it was actually\nshitty it was like painful and uncertain\nand weird and he stuck with it he he\nheld on to not held on\nhe listened to his inspiration and I\nthink each and every one of you has\nsomething that like has inspires you as\nwell it's just you've been taught this\nformula for success that has taught you\nto not listen to that part of yourself\nbut we live in a world where video games\nare the dominant form of entertainment\nthey've passed everything else right and\nlike that's actually really cool like\nI'm thrilled about that I'm thrilled\nthat we live in a world where there are\nindie game studios that can build games\nthat I like to play like really really\nremote games that like most people would\nnot care about and we live in a world\nwhere more people are writing than ever\nwe live in a world where with things\nlike Spotify I can actually listen to\nrunes music if he wants to upload it\nright we live in a world where someone\nmade the you know that the hog the [ __ ]\npong right in like like just think about\nthis for a second the person who made\nthe [ __ ] COG song is probably [ __ ]\ndepressed and isolated in a Doomer but\nthey had a flash of inspiration and they\ncreated something beautiful bro get them\nin here or they a dude it's but just\nthink about this this is coming from our\ncommunity it's coming from you guys and\nlike can't you see that no matter how\ndepressed or down that person is they've\ncreated something that is truly\nbeautiful and has brought a smile and\njoy to thousands of people beautiful and\nit's like 56 seconds of awfulness\nbut it's so wonderful I'm equal parts\nmortified and flattered I think goes the\nintention right like my kids are gonna\nlike hear that one day like can you guys\nthink about the amount of dad\nembarrassment like once my kid is gonna\ngo to school at the age of 15 and one of\ntheir friends is gonna play that on\ntheir phone it's terrifying anyway so\nlisten guys I I really loved talking to\ny'all I you know I clearly I feel like\nwe have more to\nhopefully this was helpful in some way\nand and I really appreciate you guys\ncoming on and and you know dealing with\nyour own sense of senses of anxiety or\nembarrassment about talking about this\nkind of stuff I really commend you guys\nfor doing this I'm sure other people are\ngonna find it very very helpful I\ncertainly learned a lot and I hope to\nlearn more and I hope I'll be able to\nhelp you guys more because I mean I\ndon't think we're done I haven't fixed\ny'all yet I don't think you guys are\nfixed but I really hope that you guys\nare able to sort of at
