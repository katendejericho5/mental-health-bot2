    "transcript": "um yeah so let me just okay so can you\ntalking about my sprigs not really\nexcited yeah we can talk about\nmyers-briggs do you like myers-briggs\ncan we oh my gosh I'd love ladies freaks\nsure what what do you love about\nmyers-briggs hmm\nI really like it because for me it's\nlike a gateway to talk about yourself\nand other people\nyeah absolutely hey do you know what\nyour myers-briggs type is yeah I always\nget infp yep sounds about right\nwhatever you i am i and TP make sense\nyeah so I I think I definitely make\nsense\nyou're not very like neither of us are\nsort of rigorous or hardcore which makes\nus more peace than Jays and then I think\nthe big difference between us is that\nyou're an F and I'm a tea feeling and\nthinking yeah\nso how have you been and we could talk\nmore about myers-briggs but um I've been\ngood much better yeah it's pretty good\nawesome I'm happy to hear that\num what's sinking what's changed um well\nokay there were like two things since\nthe last time we talked that really\nstood out to me personally great and I\nthink one of them was you said I was\nlike a sponge mm-hmm and learning that\nwas kind of useful like oh okay this is\njust how I am and I think it's more\nimportant that I learn what to do\nafterwards yep which was really cool and\nI didn't I didn't know what empath or\nwhatever the heck that was so I looked\nthat up too and all that stuff and the\nsecond thing was um you said you thought\nit was like a waste if I never found\nlove again or something like that I\nnever tried or something like that\nalong those lines right\nokay yes yeah I'm trying okay just cool\nokay cool so so um I was thinking maybe\nwe could talk a little bit since you're\nyou're feeling better I think a lot of\ntimes what this stream is is focused on\nis helping people who are down kind of\ncome back to baseline but I think what\nis just as important is like exploring\nhow like where goodness and life comes\nfrom so we spend a lot of time talking\nabout where badness comes from right so\nlike trauma and people hurt you and this\nand that but like I think it's just as\nimportant to understand like where does\ngoodness come from and how can you build\nlike goodness into your life okay so you\nsay that things are better and can you\nhelp me understand a little bit about\nyou know how those two things about sort\nof you know for a lack I'm trying to\nfigure out how to say this without\nsounding cheesy but I can't do it\nso not giving up on love for the lack of\nit how can I say that but that's Anna\nand and then also like like recognition\nthat you're kind of a sponge and that\nyou absorb in this kind of this\ninteresting thing about being a sponge\nis that like actually helps the people\naround you because you you kind of take\nsome of their negative energy and you it\nmakes you kind of a good friend but it\nactually costs you a lot to do that but\nso help me understand a little bit about\nthose two aspects those two things that\nwe talked about and have those been kind\nof like active and a part of your life\nor have you changed the way that you've\nstarted to live because of those I have\naccepted myself more so you know\nthroughout my life people have always\ntold me you're too sensitive or you're\ntoo emotional things like that I started\nto I guess yes I am very sensitive I am\nvery emotional I do take in literally\neverything around me and kind of\nacknowledging that helped me I guess\nyeah awesome man much and sometimes like\nI still don't know how to deal with it I\nguess yeah it's not perfect sometimes I\nstill get really upset over like stupid\nstupid\nokay yeah how do you do that how do you\nlike what does that mean acknowledge it\nwhat does that tell it because that's\nwhy good stuff in there um I used to\nthink it was not a good quality I guess\nlike oh I am really emotional I do take\na lot of things in personally and I\ndidn't know how to like just stop it\nyeah I don't think it's possible\num so by just acknowledging that this is\njust who I am and I need to learn how to\nwork around that instead of trying to\nchange myself for no reason I guess yeah\nbeautifully said and I'm just gonna kind\nof repeat back what I heard so I think I\nthink Lily like this is exactly what\nwe're here for\nmy mission in life is to try to help\npeople understand that instead of trying\nto live a life of someone that they're\nnot live that live your life with all of\nyour advantages in all of your\ndisadvantages and what I see people\ndoing time and time and time again is\nimagine you're playing poker you play\npoker so so like you know I think what I\nsee people doing is like you're dealt a\ncertain hand in poker and what people\ntry to do is they spend their entire\nlife wishing that they had a different\nhand and then trying to change their\nhand into someone else's hand and they\nthink that oh if I have like pocket if I\nhad pocket aces then I would be\nsuccessful because that guy over there\nhas pocket aces and if he's got pocket\naces then then I would be fine instead\nof playing the hand that they're dealt\nwhich let's remember that like pocket\naces doesn't always win even though\ntheoretically it's the best hand you\njust have to play the hand that you've\ngot and and what I really love about\nwhat you're saying is that like you're\nstarting to do that and and I think a\nlot of like success and and suffering so\nI think suffering and Happiness like\nthat starts to tip when you start to\naccept for yourself for who you are and\nthat also leads to success because\nyou're like you're trying to play a game\nfor which you're not like built you're\ntrying to play other people's games and\nI I don't think that you're too\nsensitive I don't think you're too\nemotional I think you are sensitive and\nemotional and that's that's a strength\nand a weakness and yeah I think it's\nwonderful that you're starting to accept\nyourself how but how are you able to\nstart doing that because I mean is does\nthat make sense like because yeah I can\nimagine there are a lot of people who\nhave trouble accepting things about\nthemselves because they've been told\nthat that thing is like not good it\ndefinitely helped because okay after a\nfirst session I had so many people\nmessaging me how much that helped them\nand like how inspired and I'm like wow\nthat's pretty cool maybe they're on to\nsomething you know maybe I I did help\nthem you know and then just even by\nstarting to accept it it shifted my\nmentality a lot because instead of just\nI guess the first step of just accepting\nyourself just really helps even if I\ndon't do anything else you have that\nmake sense\nyeah it makes perfect sense and it's one\nof the most mind-boggling things so I\nlike like the thing that's really\nconfusing is when I work with a lot of\npeople they keep on asking how do I\nchange how do I change how do I change\nand and the crazy thing is like your\ngoal is not to change it's actually to\naccept the person that you are and once\nyou do that like once you start\naccepting yourself what happens what\nchanges in your mind in your head in\nyour life in your behaviors how does\nthat affect you when you start to accept\nyourself for who you are\nfeels like the first step into I'm so by\navoiding things I just woke up hold on\ntake your time um it feels like\nsomething positive instead of something\nthat I have looked down on I don't know\nif that makes sense okay it just feels\nmore freeing like to accept that hey\nthis is just this is me this is who I am\nI'm going to live with it and this is\nhow it's gonna be\nit feels better yeah freeing yeah\nawesome\nI'm so happy was it hard yeah but even\num accepting is one thing too but it's\nstill like hard for me I guess yeah I\nstill have you know some given how I am\nand that I stream for a living and that\nmy life is exposed to thousands of\npeople it's weird like my friends often\njoke that I have like the worst\npersonality to be a public figure\nbecause I take things in so much all the\ngood all the bad yep and yeah so it's\nsomething I'm so you know I think I'll\nalways it's like a path that always be\non yep yes how very zen of you yeah also\nhow very zen of you right that's what\nzen is all about it is what it is and\nand mmm right that's what they always\ntalk about so I think that's what your\nwhat yours so the other thing that we\ncan call this is I think you're starting\nto live in the present\nso so instead of starting to live the\nimagined life of what you could what\nyour life could look like if you were a\ndifferent person is also something that\na lot of people do right so they imagine\nthemselves is a different person and\nwhat their life would be like and then\nthey like start building these fantasies\nabout my life could be this if only I\nwas someone else and what I hear you\ndoing is saying okay I'm gonna stop\nliving this imagined life of someone\nelse I'm gonna stop living\nyou know like alter ego like shadow\nuniverse Lily who is like not emotional\nand not sensitive and instead of\nbecoming your alter ego sit version of\nyourself you're just you've started to\naccept yourself for who you are and it\ncan be liberating because now you're no\nlonger like like think about why that's\nliberating it's because you're no longer\ntrying to live a life that doesn't exist\nit's really hard to live a life that\ndoesn't exist and we try to do it all\nthe time the other thing that you're\nnoticing which is also awesome is just\nbecause you accept yourself doesn't mean\nthat everything goes away\nsounds like kimmy14 to me is that Timmy\nTimmy penny penny sounds like Timmy\nagrees okay hey how long have you had to\nme oh I've had her since let's see like\nthree years now how do you like having\nit on it's amazing okay so I got Timmy\nokay I was in this super depressed state\nback then\nsuper super depressed literally did not\nwant to get out of bed and I hurt I\ndon't know if this is I don't know\nwhether it's the right or wrong reason I\ndon't care anymore but I heard that\ngetting a dog can motivate you to get\nout of bed huh and have something to\ntake care of and look forward to and\nthat's the reason I got her\nmostly huh and it worked like so well\nshe gave me a meaning and that's fine I\nfeel loved\nfor her no no no me yeah that's awesome\nyeah I think animals um you know can be\nreally awesome for us and we can be\nreally awesome for them and that\nrelationship can be really powerful also\nthey do things like reduce mortality\nlike so they oh wow yeah literally thank\nyou there's studies that show that\nanimals will literally reduce mortality\nand people who have animals live longer\nbizarre I love dogs I love her it's just\nit's amazing how much she makes me so\nhappy\nyeah so I just want to point out that I\nthink that too is because you're an\nemotional sponge right so like like the\ndog is going to be able to affect you in\na positive way greater than it would be\nable to affect someone who is\ninsensitive because you can open\nyourself up to like her joy and\ncompassion and licks so that's awesome\nlike dogs can make everyone happy yeah\nI'm not so sure about that I mean I hear\nthat they're these people called cat\npeople I grew up with three German\nshepherds so I'm not sure what the cat\nwhat's the deal with the cat people but\nthe more time I spend on Reddit the more\ntime I kind of like the more I find\nmyself wanting to get a cat they're like\nmore low maintenance right you don't\nneed to potty train them or anything\njust kind of there yeah but also\napparently some of them are [ __ ] not\nnot the cat people the cats themselves\noh yeah yeah if you're lucky you get a\ncat that acts like a doc Oh interesting\ninteresting anyway so just going back to\nyou mentioned that there's still some\nproblems is it okay if we just kind of\nlike understand those a little bit in\nthe context of what's changed and what\nhasn't changed yeah so can you give me\nan example of you know so it sounds like\nyou're you've turned over a new leaf\nyour check you're living your life\nslightly differently you're changing the\nway that you look at yourself and yet\nproblems still arise\num because even if I accept that this is\nwho I am I'm still going to be affected\nby it that's not gonna change\nabsolutely so now I'm dealing with how\ndo I better cope with it you know I\nbetter deal with it which is still I\nthink an ongoing process yeah so like\nI'm really glad that you recognized that\nso I'm gonna try to kind of explain this\nso acceptance doesn't really happen in\nour traditional mind it sort of happens\noutside of our mind so like I know this\nisn't gonna sound weird but like there's\nthere are different layers of mind and\nso what I think you've managed to do is\ngain some degree of acceptance that sort\nof exists outside of your mind and your\nmind can still have the roller coaster\nyou can still feel good things and bad\nthings but the more that you kind of\naccept all of the roller coaster the\nless impactful the roller coaster\nbecomes does that make sense or not\nreally anything okay\nthe other thing is that it doesn't\nactually change the fact that you still\nhave a roller coaster so I think what\nyou're still experiencing is that\nthere's still a roller coaster it's just\nthe roller coaster it's like you're more\nprotected against the roller coaster\ndoes that is that how it feels it's kind\nof I guess the fact that there's still a\nroller coaster yeah but there's still a\nroller coaster right that's what's kind\nof weird about this is that like what\nwhat you what you've grown and you\nhaven't so a lot of people who feel like\nyou know they're they are emotionally\nsensitive what they try to do is become\nemotionally less sensitive so that's\nexactly that's the equivalent of\nreducing the roller coaster it's like\nchanging the roller coaster into like a\nflat drive but that doesn't work so life\nis still gonna send you a roller coaster\nit's your ability to step back from the\nroller coaster and kind of accept it for\nwhat it is that actually gives you a\nsense of peace but the roller coaster\nstill happens and I think that's what\nyou mean by the problems like you don't\nyou haven't stopped becoming emotionally\nsensitive you're just better at\nunderstanding that you're emotionally\nsensitive and like more accepting of\nthat which makes the roller\nare less painful fair yeah okay that's\nme that's a good way to put it yeah so\nso there so can you give me an example\nof like what is like what's something\nthat you've experienced that has been a\nlittle bit more problematic recently\nokay um I'm a public figure yourself\nmost of my life is online I share a lot\nof things with my audience I'm very very\nvery very open about literally\neverything huh but I think sometimes\nthat gives people stuff to use against\nme okay because I'm so open though see\nthat and I guess form their own analysis\non my life my relationships etc that are\njust completely wrong but yeah and that\nbugs me because I'm like that's not true\nyeah\nyes absolutely right so people are gonna\njust they're gonna make all kinds of\njudgments over the Internet and because\nyou're open they're going to feel like\nthey understand you because you share so\nmuch but they're they're not really I\nmean they're missing crucial even though\nyou're super open it sounds like they're\nmissing crucial pieces of the puzzle\nwhich is like what your actual\nexperiences yes I mean I choose to be\nopen so and this sounds like I expected\ncuz it's the internet you know you put\nyourself out there people are going to\nform their own opinions about you and I\nunderstand that I guess it's just I just\ndeeply don't like being misunderstood\nthat's like the one thing that's why I'm\nopen and honest because I make if you\nneed to know something like I will tell\nyou don't make wrong assumptions on your\nhouse okay what do you think what do you\nthink it is that bothers you about being\ndeeply misunderstood it's it's like\npeople thinking you're this one you're\nnot and that kind of bothers me I guess\nbecause I'm not that anything so it\nalmost sounds like you it was part of\nyour openness is to prevent people\nmisunderstanding you yes sometimes and\nalso because I just like sharing things\nit's just fun yeah so I think they're\nlike those sound like no they sound like\nseparate mode\npatience to me yeah there yeah and even\nthough the so sharing like there's a\npart of that that I think is just\ngenuinely you you just like to share\nright and that's awesome I like sharing\nfeelings and talking about how I feel\nand malicious that's why I love my\nbrakes on my tray I'm like hey what my\nstrings are you all without muses and\nyou know we can get into a whole other\nconversation about that that's like\nsuper fun for me yeah and and also it\nsounds like you share part of the reason\nthat you share the degree with which you\nshare is to try to prevent people\nmisunderstanding you just a bit okay\nyeah yeah so and and when when they\nmisunderstand you how does that affect\nyou like what happens within you when\nwhen you see that happening and how does\nit happen like over Twitter or like what\na little wedding sometimes I get Dan's\nmost of it is just messages emails etc\nhey Shh are we are we going to dangerous\nterritory is Tammy should we switch\ngears no no no that's cuz she hears\nsomeone outside okay like no I mean it\nsounds like Tammy is very are you sure\nit's because she hears something outside\nor it's because she's sensing something\nwithin you because of what we're talking\nabout\nI think it's outside good\nshe's like growls what if she used stuff\neverything wolf um but that'd be cool if\nshe could send something inside me and\nthen like growl from that I've never\nseen her do that but that'd be really\ncool she probably does other things\nbesides growl she does when I'm like sad\nor whatever I think she can tell I'm\nlike she always like cuddles me like\nmore and it's like super super super\nhealing yeah\nwhat are we talking about though we were\ntalking about being misunderstood yeah\nso so but it sounds like most of what\nyour openness is just because you want\nto be open yes okay okay and we can talk\na little bit about more about being\nmisunderstood and why that's important\nto you although I suspect that that'll\nbe a little bit of\nless positive conversation because it's\nkind of like a negative sort of thing\ndoes that make sense yeah I'm free to\ntalk about mother okay so the other\nthing that you mentioned is that you've\nstopped giving up on love you're giving\nlove another chance and\nand I mean so we could talk about that\ntoo if I mean because that's what's okay\nso what does that mean practically you\nknow just kind of fell free someone I'm\nlying you know I try to convince myself\nfor like no I don't I don't actually\nlike you know it's and it's not gonna\nwork at all but I gotta try wait why do\nyou try to convince yourself that it's\nnot going to work out cuz I was afraid I\nwas gonna get hurt again initially right\nbut then honestly I think that's a risk\nthat we're all kind of willing to take\nokay um by the way I have trouble seeing\nyour whole face because of the\nmicrophone I'm sorry\nthat's okay yes I just rely on facial\nexpressions a lot it helps me\nbut if you want to hide behind the mic\nthen I don't want to take that away from\nyou well yeah I guess I'm just afraid me\nyeah you do have to be a little bit\ncloser you can move it back to to cover\nyour face that's better oh sorry no\nproblem okay great okay so so it sounds\nlike you [ __ ] sorry that's okay\nsay okay so so you fell for someone so\nthose are emotions right and then\nsomething happened in your mind where\nyou tried to keep yourself from falling\nfor them yeah and you think and you did\nthat to try to protect yourself yes\nmakes a lot of sense so this is great so\nI think Lily the other advantage of you\nbeing emotional is that I think you can\nwe can cover a lot more ground because I\ndon't have to explain like emotional\nstuff to you because like you're you're\nactually really in tune with your own\nfeelings I'm\nreally surprised honestly that you're\nable to piece together that you have\nthat kind of protective reflex in your\nmind to pull away from someone that you\nfell for what exactly does that does\nthat mean love just crashed okay\nI don't know yeah and and so are you do\nyou mind if I ask you a few questions\nabout that yeah are you so are you in a\nrelationship of some kind yeah how does\nthat feel pretty good I mean it's like\nyou take a journey another adventure you\nsort of feel yeah\nlike I'm willing to put my all into this\nI guess that's nice what that's awesome\nso that sounds so positive I don't know\nhow else just say that I mean it sounds\nlike you're not expecting too much out\nof it um yeah we're pretty much like\nlet's just go with the flow see where it\nends up I am very open like if it works\ngreat if it doesn't doesn't like what\nI'm willing to try it at the very least\nthat's how I feel about this yeah so it\nsounds like you're hopeful but not\nexpecting yes so that I think is the\nperfect way to be in a relationship so I\nthink we run into problems when you\nstart to expect what do you think about\nthat then you get disappointed\nabsolutely but sometimes it's hard it's\nit's very hard to be hopeful without\nexpectation that's true how are you I'm\njust I feel I feel like I'm very\nrealistic about this relationship though\nfrom all the things I went through in\nthe past uh-huh so I just I feel like\nit's just like a lot of communication\nlike I tell everything if there's\nsomething that is bothering me I dress\nit it's very very honey word that's like\nstraightforward okay so it sounds like\nyou're on top of it\nmm-hmm right like it sounds\nwhen when they're there issues that\narise in the relationship like either\nfeelings that you have or concerns that\nyou have that you're straightforward and\nlike you talk about them instead of\nletting them kind of fester we yeah we\nboth communicate a lot and I really like\nthat so it feels very free and very open\nvery honest and at the moment no\nchanging all honeymoon phase I know that\nso whatever hackin how long have you\nguys been together\nmonths okay\nit's very nice yes so that is relatively\nnew but it also sounds like y'all you're\nit sounds like the relationship is\nactually pretty strong yeah yeah nice\nyeah I don't have any problems I mean\nusually like it you know that that sort\nof open straightforward communication is\nis rare so early in a relationship do\nyou mind if I ask it did you know the\nperson before you guys started okay okay\nso I guess that makes a little bit more\nsense but because usually people are\nlike you know they're like all kinds of\nanxieties around and so I know that\nyou're an open person and I also know\nyou're a public figure so feel free to\nnot answer this question I'm just not\nsure how often I can call this person\nthis person so can I have a name Michael\nokay okay so tell me a little so it\nsounds like you've you've really given\nthis a shot and you're acknowledging\nthat you don't know where it's gonna go\nbut you feel pretty optimistic about it\nyes yeah so what's that like the you\nknow I I know the beginning of a\nrelationship is always like man that\nperson can do no wrong perfect it's like\nsweet and it's super cute I know this\nbut I'm enjoying it for what it is\nYeah right and I realize it will end\neventually well maybe well I don't know\nI've heard stories so but again it's\njust whatever comes at me I will I will\ntackle it then\nyeah so so yeah so Lily okay let me just\nthink for a second so I want you to just\nnotice what words you're using right so\nonce again you're creating distance\nbetween what your mind kind of like\nprojects and expects and you're saying\nlike you know that this is the honeymoon\nphase in that it very well could end but\nthat too is acceptance right so like\nyou're kind of accepting that this could\nbe the honeymoon phase and you're\nenjoying it for what it is that also is\nsuper zen so like that's the whole point\nright so like when so I'll just give you\nan example so if I walk outside so\nspring is coming and I don't know what\npart of the world you live in but I\ndon't know if you're gonna have flat are\nyou gonna have like flowers and stuff in\nbloom where you are I live in California\nthat's okay so I don't I don't know how\nmuch of a spring really hits California\nbut so I live in Massachusetts and and\nyou know winter is brutal here and then\nalso spring is like super super\nbeautiful and and so you know that some\npeople what they do when they have\nsomething good in life is they try to\nhold on to that and that I think holds\npeople is the more you try to hold on to\nwhat you have the more held back you\nbecome and what I'm hearing from you is\nthat you're not trying to hold on to the\nhoneymoon phase you're just trying to\nenjoy it while it lasts yeah and so so\nyou know the Zen master when they look\nat a flower that's in bloom they don't\ntry to hold on to the beauty of that\nflower for ever they don't try to\ncapture it they don't try to hold on to\nit forever and this is what we try to do\nwith like Instagram and cameras and\niPhones is we try to capture memories\nand moments in our lives forever but the\nZen master what they do is just\nappreciate the beauty of the flower for\nwhat it is and appreciate that it's\ntransient and that it will eventually\nwither and it doesn't mean that like\nthat to that like you know the plant\nwill still remain and there's a there's\na beauty within the plant as well and\nthat the plant will continue to bloom so\nyou just kind of accept things for what\nthey are instead of trying to hold on to\na particular like state in your life now\nand I'm hearing a lot of just just the\nnature of your language has changed\nsince the last time I talk to you it's\nhard to pinpoint but it's just these\nstatements like I acknowledge so that\ntoo is like you're acknowledging the\nroller coaster that right now this is\nthe high phase of the relationship and\nat some point the roller coaster is\ngoing to dip but you're separating\nyourself from the roller coaster and\nyou're saying I'm going to let myself\nenjoy this and if it ends so be it if it\ndoesn't end get fantastic what and and I\nthink it that's that's that's perfect\nthat's like perfect\nthat's what I want everyone to do is to\nunderstand that the good things in your\nlife they could go away or they could\nstay for a while and enjoy them why they\nwell they last and the more that you try\nto hold on to something yeah I think I\nthink this relationship is gonna work\nout thank you III really think it is\nyeah okay you know yeah I know I'm sorry\nfor creating an expectation but\nsomething about this sometimes I get a\nsense of things and and I I like the way\nyou're thinking about it and I like the\nway you're talking about it and and I\nhope that the guy isn't like decent dude\nyeah so but I think this is yeah so Lily\nthe other thing is that's all I'll tell\nyou like you know as much as okay so I'm\ngonna ask you a personal question okay\nin your heart of hearts and you don't\nhave to answer this okay you really\ndon't have to answer this because this\nis not helping you understand maybe I'm\njust really curious in your heart of\nhearts what do you think is gonna happen\nyou don't have to answer right no no no\nstop stop for a second this is not an\nexpectation what I'm asking you about is\nnot an expectation well what I think is\ngoing to happen what do you feel is\ngonna happen or not even gonna happen\nbecause gonna happen is like is\ncognitive it's heart ache I know what I\nwant to happen okay of course and I want\nus to work yeah okay do you feel like\nit's going to work long term not talking\nabout expectation I want to jinx it okay\nthat's fine so don't say anything but I\nwant you to just so this is another\nimportant point okay so there's\nexpectation which comes from the mind\nbut I think that there's there's also\nsomething that is I don't even think\nit's emotional I think it's almost more\nspiritual in terms of sometimes we have\na sense of things does that make sense\nso I think you're very good at it sort\nof having a sense of things so this is\nthe end for - breaks by the way okay so\nlike what is your intuition it's not an\nexpectation it's an intuition it's a gut\nand you don't even have to answer but I\nwould trust that right and so I would\nalso ask you because like my gut is\ntelling me very very strong things right\nnow\nand so we don't even have to ask I get\nyou to answer I know what your answer is\nbut and so that then I want you to go\nback in time and think about the other\nrelationships you've had and think about\nwhat was telling you to stay in the\nrelationship was it your mind or your\ngut or a fear or that you didn't want to\nbelieve or what are you feeling what was\nyour gut telling you then what was your\nintuition telling you then and what is\nyour intuition telling you now is it the\nsame or is it different\nno it's different very good very\ndifferent I like that's not surprising\nto me at all so I think and so that I\nfeel weirdly optimistic I don't even\nknow anything about this purse\nright but I have a sense of these things\nand and honestly like I don't know how\nelse to put this Lily but I see in your\nface and your demeanor what I felt like\nwhen I met my wife no that's that I see\nit and like as crazy as this sounds so\nlike as much as I think about\nrationality and god this is gonna be so\nbad if you guys break up because I'm\nstaking my entire reputation and and and\nstuff on horseback [ __ ] it it's what I\nbelieve like so I actually like this is\ncrazy I believe in true love like I\nreally do and and I think I think for\nall of the cognitive stuff in the\nneuroscience and psychology I think that\nsome things are just meant to be I think\nthis is garma Karma right I think that\nthere are forces in our life that shape\nwho we are in the kinds of life we live\nand I see that force very very strongly\nin my own life and I don't know how to\nput this but like I don't know how to\nsay this but there is no earthly way in\nwhich I have done something to deserve\nthe person that I'm married to yeah go\nahead go for it no I just say things\nlike that I guess\nno no but I mean seriously like and I\nthink the only the only way that this is\npossible is for a force greater than me\nto like be acting at it right cuz I'm\njust I'm just not that good I'm just not\nI'm just not I mean it's not it's not an\nissue of confidence or anything I'm very\nconfident the person that I am but I\nthink it's just she's just really\namazing and I'm really really lucky to\nhave her I mean she stuck with me\nthrough all kinds of stuff and and so\nlike in that I mean I can't and I see it\nI see it in you and there are a lot of\nthings that were hard for us but it's\nthere and so I you know don't stop\nbelieving that's really that's adorable\nwhat does that mean a door we have\nbefore you that's so cute\nthey\nbelieve in true love and you must love\nyour wife so much it's just it's really\ncute I really I'm enjoying this what are\nyou doing I'm happy thank you I'm happy\nfor me too\nwhat's enjoyable about it it's just nice\nthing you happy and talked so lovingly\nabout your life and no like it's just\nbeautiful to see I like it\nno I'm glad you're enjoying it no no no\nI mean what I said sounded weird to I'm\njust really curious about what resonates\nwith what I'm saying you know like like\nlike and and I'm really I really am glad\nthat that it's bringing you some degree\nof happiness\nI always feel happy when I see like a\nrelationship just work and seeing them\nbe happy for each other and the way that\nyou talk about each other and just\nseeing that kind of things makes me very\nvery happy\ncuz it's just I can tell they're happy\nit's it's very nice to see ya oh god how\ndo I wear this umm not creepy way it's\nyeah I'm happy that you're happy\nyes so now we come back to the\nadvantages of being an emotional sponge\nright so I think it's I think it's\nwonderful that the person that you are\nare you feeling embarrassed or something\nI'm confused I'm what are you\nembarrassed about I just say okay let's\njust let's ignore that I'm gonna keep\ntalking okay you ready yeah so I think\nthis is this is the upside of being an\nemotional sponge so I think this is\nwhat's fun and amazing about your life\nand also like really difficult is\nbecause when there's toxicity around you\nit affects you but also that you can\nlook at another person's joy and like be\nso affected by it which is beautiful so\nit's like it's like when you see like a\nflower in the sunshine and like you see\nlike warm ray\nof light on those pedals like you're\ncapable of feeling that warmth - which\nis amazing I said this in the first\nconversation but you really do make me\nsound very cool I really I really - very\ngood I know so I make you sound cool am\ni how can I make you sound anything yeah\nshouldn't affect that no I'm glad you\nsaid it\nno no I'm glad you said I'm really glad\nyou said it and I'm glad you recognized\nthat it's Lily - right so that's that's\nthe goal is to catch it when it happens\nand to notice it no wonder you're doing\nso much better because you caught it\nreally fast and this is this is\nsomething important like if you guys\njust have to catch it if you catch it\nand you notice it that actually weakens\nit because remember that Lily - gets out\nof control when you can't see her when\nshe goes in vis and then she starts\nwrecking your [ __ ] life it's like a\npoltergeist it's like you can't see it\nyou can't stop it but all you need is\nlike you need detection you need to be\nable to see her like you don't want her\nhiding in the bushes you know like you\nplay wall right there's like the bushes\nor whatever right so like Lily - is\ngonna own you as long as she's like\nhanging out in those places that you\ncan't see her and she's like attacking\nyou from the bushes or whatever but once\nyou see it once you detect her then you\ncould take her on man like you can own\nher like you can yeah it's good work in\ncontinues yeah I made like after that\nand maybe Lily one emailed and look to\neat now after this I'm gonna need to\nmake Ozen fully emotes yeah cool this is\nit's just it's cute it's very cute I\nlike to call it I really like the\nconcept a lot like separating it yeah\nseparating what so when I say something\nor I know it's coming from really to\nhaving that separation I guess even\nthough it's still me I know but giving\nlike acknowledging that all that's\nthat's really - talking yep yes that's\nhow our mind works and I think\noftentimes we forget\nthat just because like we think that\nLily too is like the speaker of truth\nright and whatever Lily too says like\nyou accept is true but now does that\nmake sense like when you're feeling bad\nyou accept lily twos statements or\nthoughts as facts but when you separate\nout Lily too you begin you you weaken\nher ability to convince you that she's\ncorrect because you recognize that she's\njust a part of your mind and that your\nmind is not infallible in fact it thinks\nwere stupid wrong thoughts all the time\nyeah and and so that's that's awesome\nLily I'm really happy for you I think\nyou've changed a lot since the last time\nI talked to you thank you I'm really\nglad we had our talk yeah I think\ninitially after the talk I was feeling\nembarrassed because I cried so much and\nthousands of people like some it\naffected a lot of people and I wasn't\nsure I was just embarrassed I guess not\nsure and then afterwards I was feeling\nhappy that it affected people in a good\nway in a positive way cuz I really did\nreceive so many private messages about\nthat conversation and thanking me and\nhow much it helped them and that made me\nreally really happy like super happy\nyeah and just yeah I'm really glad I had\nthat conversation and showed all that\nyeah I'm glad you did too I think a lot\nof life is hard because we like try to\nlive it alone you know and and we just\nall of the burdens like despite being\nsuch an open person I can imagine that\nyou probably share a lot but you're you\nprobably hold a lot of the burdens that\nyou carry like to yourself yes and and\nyou share a lot of the positivity which\nI think can be good in some ways like\nbecause you can be kind of inspiring and\ncomforting to people who are feeling\ndown but I think in a sense like you\nknow when you share something with\nsomeone else it kind of like\nlessons the weight on you and and I\nthink you were carrying a lot of burden\nof negativity like within yourself about\nI'm not quite sure what but and and so I\nthink it's good that you sort of let\nthat go a little bit and also let it be\nand let it pass and also I think part of\nthe reason that you're probably feeling\nbetter is because of Michael because\nthat sounds like it's calling me will\ncall me again I I know yeah it is what\nit is I say this a lot now yeah good\ngood it is what it is right and it\nsounds wonderful is it wonderful okay so\nyou don't know Jake said I get it\nright so you don't wanna okay fine\nobjectively no it is it is above average\nit is above average excellent I don't\nwant to be perfect because it's jinxing\nit and that's like you know just\nexpectations is up but it is nice yeah\nno I think being with a good person is\nreally really nice for your life also in\nmy experience some of that doesn't\nreally go away like the honeymoon phase\nI think the honeymoon phase is really\nonly applicable to relationships without\nthe one I think with the one the whole\nreason that they're the one is because\nthe honeymoon phase doesn't really stop\nWow I hope I mean do I hope yeah I hope\nI have or find what you have sounds\namazing\nyeah I guess wait I think it's it's\ndifferent for every person right so\nremember we don't want to play someone\nelse's handsome but I think I think it's\nfine to hope that you find something one\nday that describes sort of what I'm what\nI have\nyeah yeah I hope I think it's closer\nthan you think man but let's not jinx it\nokay let's stop talking about a singing\nI'm not sick but no no no you should be\ndude you should absolutely be\nsuperstitious when it comes to my stuff\nright because this is not the kind of\nstuff that\n[ __ ] around with oh no yeah I become so\nsuperstitious recently it's bizarre\nexpired I said once I had kids like I\njust it's weird it's like parts of my\nbrain woke up that were like dormant and\nnow it becomes like superstitious okay\nin our culture like we like my\ngrandmother used to talk about the evil\neye mm-hm and and like I was like that's\nBS there's no evil eye\nbut now I've so that's the evil eye just\nkidding I don't even know it's like when\nsome when people so in in my culture\nit's like when people when you're like\noverly happy or joyous and people become\njealous like bad things happen to you to\nput you back in line oh that's that's\nthe best I can think of that's the best\ndescription I see I didn't feel like at\none point I was too scared to be too\nhappy I guess we're cautiously too happy\nyeah cuz I what if something bad happens\nto counteract that yeah I don't know\nthat superstition or anxiety or whatever\nI always felt that yeah so like I know\nthis is what I'll say like I think that\nI don't think it's rational and yet\nsometimes I think that we encounter and\nexperience things that defy rationality\nand okay and I think that if you want to\nbe a real scientist you have to accept\nthat your view of the world may not be\ncorrect and that there may be forces at\nplay in the world that we just don't\nunderstand yet and if we just assume\nthat those forces are wrong just because\nthey don't fit into our worldview that's\nnot truly being scientific so what a\nscientist does is collects data from the\nworld and then form basis creates a\nworldview that accounts for your\nobservations it's not let's say it's not\nassuming a worldview and then\ndiscounting your observations because\nthey don't fit with what you believe the\nworld looks like and essentially what's\nhappened to me recently over the past\ncouple of years is like I've just like\nstarted to feel weird things like I\ndon't know how else to put it\nit's like making me think about this\nevil eye stuff which is not rational at\nall I have no idea how this [ __ ] works\nbut I feel it and so I don't know if\nit's just parental paranoia and just\npart of my psychology I'm not sure but\nyou know I start to I start to take\nthese things seriously like the knock on\nwood and stuff yes a little stop talking\nabout Oh Michael it's not even use this\nname we'll call it this person back to\nthis I think anyway so what I'm what do\nyou I'm not really sure where to go from\nhere what huh hmm well you doing today\nlike like how am i spending my day yeah\nso for today I I mean I worked in the\nmorning I'm gonna work after this and\nthen I will go home and hang out with my\nkids for a while and then may do a\nlittle bit of work after that or\nactually I'll probably just like watch\nsomething and hang out with my wife for\na little while and then are you watching\nright now I'm watching a couple of\nthings so I'm watching we saw we started\nwatching Curb Your Enthusiasm season 10\nrecently oh that's so funny yeah and so\nwe started watching that just a couple\nof days ago I'm also watching Marv\nChael on Netflix which is like a British\nlike crime kind of thing I like those\nlike I don't know if you seem like a\nLuthor or anything but I'm a big fan of\nyeah we don't sorry god oh my does it\nsound like a nice relaxing day cleanness\nyeah\nwhat's what's your day looking like um\nyeah I shoot up one I have a little\nvoiceover workshop at night one stream\nwhat does that mean shoot at one Oh some\nand part of the content cater house\nthingy right so we have a YouTube\nchannel that we run together and we have\nshoots so we film something I see I'm\nnot sure what we're doing okay he needs\ncooking I'm not sure it's always\ndifferent okay okay I didn't know how\nthat stuff um I may be awful Netflix\nlater yeah it's Michael the person this\nperson the person said the person the\nfridge he does have a name the person\nthe person\nlet's not invoke any kind of evil eye on\nhim okay yeah oh my god I feel like I do\nunderstand like that slight paranoia if\nI open up too much you know\nyep the point it yeah mmhmm yeah Wow so\nI like I think that if we're actually at\na good stopping place we can just stop\nif if you want or we can open things up\nto questions like what do you what do\nyou feel like doing should we do some\nQ&A I'll do whatever you do okay let's\ngo for like another can evil eye let's\ndo let's try to see if people have a\ncouple of questions and then and then\nyeah I mean sometimes we have long\nmeandering conversations that last an\nhour and a half but I think that we you\nknow I I'm very happy with where you are\nand I don't have any particular\ncuriosity or anything oh let me just see\nokay so\nwant to meet Michael okay freaky okay\nhey hey hey\nso people have questions oh crap okay\nlet's see\nfree what unmute we just talking about\nevil ID on dog no no no no evil eye on\nthe dog I'm I'm so confused\nwhat twitch had to say they're talking\nabout freedom uh you had it's uploaded I\nguess huh and then like if you if you\nput on sup lot only subscribers can talk\nand then when you disable it\nits freedom oh I see I had yes okay oh\nyou monster or someone else did say yeah\nI don't know how this stuff works little\nIan's about psychology spirituality or\nthe evil eye but okay here we go\nboomer murca invaded chat yeah okay cool\nthey're being cued up yeah so what are\nyou watching on Netflix ah\nI'm watching this anime about volleyball\nwhich is really cool it's it's yeah it's\njust an anime about volleyball it's\nreally fun um that's it I mean we\nwatched like a bunch of the shows\nalready um you've heard of I'm not okay\nwith this\nI've heard of it I don't know what it is\nit's like yeah it's a coming-of-age sort\nof story about a girl who has powers not\nbad hmm I'm always looking for stuff to\nbinge on Netflix yeah me too um okay I\nthink we're getting questions okay here\nwe go\nokay so let's go so people are asking\nabout Lily's dosha did you know anything\nabout Ayurveda Lily oh you'll you'll\nmaybe like this okay oh sure yeah so um\nyou know what myers-briggs is based on\nno so myers-briggs is based on the work\nof Carl Jung who was a psychoanalyst in\na contemporary of Freud's and Carl\nJung's a lot of his theories were based\non actually like Indian philosophy and\nwere actually based on Ayurveda in IRA\nas traditional Indian medicine\nand an Ayurveda sort of posits that like\nso Western medicine kind of says that\neveryone is the same\nso if you think about like what you\nstudy in Western medicine you study like\nheart attacks or the flu or a corona\nvirus right so a doctor learns how to\ntreat a disease they don't learn how to\ntreat a person with me\nso Ayurvedic swith kind of a different\nassumption it says that all people are\ndifferent and that we each have like\ndifferent elemental balances is kind of\nthey use elements to describe certain\ncharacteristics like personalities or\nphysical form or things like that and\nthose they have three kind of quote\nunquote elements which are called doshas\nand then based on someone's door sha you\ncan kind of understand how their mind\nworks so I kind of call it a cognitive\nfingerprint so we each have like a\nunique fingerprint and we each have a\nunique like way that our mind works\nso one exactly thing so there are all\nkinds of traits so for example you are\npredominantly gafas and I think you're\nprobably gonna and Vata so gafas is kind\nof think about earth and water so people\nwho are guffaws they they deal with\nstress when their mind becomes stress\nthey become kind of isolated and\ndepressive they start to think negative\nself thoughts about themselves so vadas\nare different because vadas become\nanxious and start thinking negative\nthoughts about the external world so\nthey start worrying about oh this is\ngonna happen and this is gonna happen\nand this is gonna happen whereas cough\nis when they get stressed say like oh\nlike I'm dumb because I did this I'm\ndumb because I did this I'm dumb because\nI did this the third element is fit\nthough which is kind of like fire and so\nwhen pit does get stressed they get\nangry at other people so they're like oh\nthis is dumb like this person is dumb\nlike these people suck in traffic like\nroad rage is a classic bit the\nphenomenon whereas like I would imagine\nyou don't have road rage like you just\ndon't understand why people wrote rage\nbecause that's just not how your mind\nworks right and and so you're\npredominantly kapha and I think you have\nVata as well and the other thing about\nAyurveda is that there are physical\ncharacteristics associated with these as\nwell so can you look directly at the\ncamera\nand can you take off your glasses oh can\nwe do that yes sir sorry okay so so the\nother thing is is there are some\nphysical characteristics which you can\nkind of us all do my face okay so my\nface tends to be like a little bit\nangular like if you look at my nose like\nmy nose is very like angular like your\nfaces has kind of a rounder quality to\nit if you look at my hands so my hands\nhave very prominent veins on the back of\nmy hands my fingers tend to be like long\nand thin these are all Vata\ncharacteristics so these are very wind\ncharacteristics so vadas are angular\nsharp cold so I tend to like get cold\nhands and feet very easily so there are\nall kinds of physical characteristics so\nyou have a lot of roundness to your face\nand it doesn't I'm not saying you're fat\nor anything like that I'm just talking\nabout like your your your nose is like\nrounded whereas mine is like angular\nright so there's like angular there's\nless angularity to your features has\nnothing to do with beauty or\nattractiveness or anything like that\nit's just like some people's hands and\nfaces and stuff just look different the\nother thing about vatta's is like\nsivadas have eyes that are bigger than\ntheir plate so what that means is that\nthey usually feel super super hungry but\nthen it doesn't take a whole lot of food\nto fill them up Gotha is kind of have a\npretty stable and steady appetite so do\nyou get filled up easily and feel hungry\neasily I eat a lot yeah so I think\nyou're predominantly Gotha so but your\nguff about that and I think the other\ntricky thing about this is that like I'm\nnot sure\nbecause all of this stuff was developed\nwith like Indian people so I don't know\nhow how exactly to translate this stuff\nto other ethnicities I think a lot of it\ntranslates pretty easily like mentally\nit's fine like I'm really good at\npicking out someone's mental dosha so\nother characteristics of gafas or their\nmind is resilient and also very stable\nso I know this is gonna sound bizarre to\nyou but your cup your capacity to\nwithstand emotional punishment is\nactually very very high so like cough I\nthink that before yeah so guffaws have\nhigh h peoples that's the other way to\nthink about it so yeah if I want to read\nup more on this what should i search up\num so give me like a week and then I\nwill send you a video about it okay\nthat's me I can actually I can link you\na video if you promise not to link it to\nanyone else because it's a rough draft\nversion but if you're really okay so\nwe're gonna try to make it like look\nbetter but if you're really curious\nso other features so the interesting\nthing about guffaws is like it's good\nbecause they're very resilient may have\nhigh HP pools but the downside of gafas\nis that they also tolerate negative\nsituations for a lot longer than other\npeople would because they can actually\njust they have high HP pools so they'll\nlike sit in piles of acid or poison for\na long period of time because they can\nhandle it and so understanding you know\nwhat your though she is is important and\nbasically everything I was kind of\ntelling you about being an emotional\nsponge comes from Gotham so gafas are\nalso emotional sponges so vodkas tend to\nget like very very deranged by like the\nemotions of others like they can get\nvery affected by them and they can't\nreally tolerate them bit those are sort\nof medium they get somewhat influenced\nby other people but like not so much\nthey tend to be like a little bit more\nnarcissistic or ambitious they're kind\nof like fiery so they tend to be\nargumentative and things like that res\nguffaws tend to absorb a lot of like if\nyou think about you know the wind like\nhow much like how much can the wind hold\nnot wait I know it's a bizarre question\nactually yeah like a strong wind could\ntotal line but yes sir how much\ngenerally not much how much how much can\nhold way more than wind yeah absolutely\nright\nso Gotha and this is why they kind of\ncame up with like gafas being earth and\nwater and Vata being wind it's not like\nthere's actually like wind inside me\nwith what the people did in ancient\nindia is they like looked at different\nelements and they realize there are\ncertain like qualities to those elements\nand they use those elements as\ndescriptions to help us understand like\ncertain qualities of people so it's not\nlike we can biopsy you and you're gonna\nfind like earth inside you and you're\ngonna find wind inside me they kind of\nso you're kind of stable you're\nresilient you're absorbent\nwhereas like i'm not absorbent at all\nlike people ask me how can i do this\nwork and it's because i don't absorb any\nof it because i'm just like the wind\nso i sit with someone and i feel things\nvery intensely with them and then much\nlike the wind i blow really hard in one\ndirection and then i just stop and then\ni blow really hard in this direction so\ni think a lot of people who are confused\nabout why I do this work I'm able to do\nthis work because I'm a Vata so stuff\ndoesn't sit with me because I just I\nfeel things really intensely and then\nlike I just jet like I just let it\npasses through me right and it's not\nthat it's like good or bad it's not\nbetter or worse than yours it's just if\nyou tried to do this work you'd probably\nnot be like a do a very good job at it\nbecause they're not it's nothing you\nwouldn't do a good job it's that you do\na different kind of good job whereas\nlike I would I think you'd be like a\nbetter like you're probably a better\nfriend than I am because I can I can\nmeet someone and like be super emotional\nwith them for one hour but like people\ndon't stay in my life because I just\nmove on to other things so I'm really\ngood at like brief interactions with\npeople even am I like in my practice\nlike you know a lot of psychiatrists or\ntherapist will see people for years I\nwork with people for like six months and\nthen you know I try to get him better\nand try to get him out the door\nand and so you know I mean some people I\nend up working with for years but a lot\nof people like they just get better and\nthen I'm like okay well you're better\nnow so wait go live your life man stop\nshowing up here and and so that's\nbecause I'm about that because I just\nyou know I get really excited to work\nwith new people and vodkas also have a\nvery tangential thought process so I'm\nsaying all kinds of random [ __ ] to you\nright now it's not like uniform does\nthat make sense I'm just talking about\nall kinds of rings yeah anyway sorry\nyeah so so your predominant door shiz is\nGotha certainly mentally and and\nprobably VAT the second and so what that\nmeans for you is basically everything\nwe've already said but I want you to\nthink about you know you're so in your\nworst-case scenario when you're Gotha is\nreally really bad you're gonna feel like\nmud so when you put water and earth\ntogether you're just gonna be sluggish\nand slow and not want to get out of met\nbad you're gonna be like this like mud\ncreature instead of like a human right\nwell not creature and there are gonna be\nother people who are like so like as\nsomeone who's a bit though who's a fire\nperson when they get stressed they're\ngonna be pissed off at everyone and it's\nlike the worse their life it gets the\nmore they take it out on like randomly\non other people and they're irritable\nand angry like you probably don't get\nvery irritable or angry you probably get\nwithdrawn and kind of pulled in and\nstuff like that and so I stopped moving\nyeah absolutely yeah so so I think that\nthat's your dough shot that's a great\nquestion okay so so we're gonna send\nsome of these questions your way okay\nLily yeah go for it see how question for\nyou don't - have you heard of tea\nEnneagram yeah and graham and a grammar\nyeah what number are you I don't know I\nhaven't oh I mean I I have a couple of\ncolleagues that use this\nbut I'm not sure I'm not too familiar\nwith it got it got it\nokay this wandering but all explored I\nlike personality stuff too\nso one of the things that I'm actually\ntrying to develop for people is like a\ncomprehensive cognitive personality test\nthat's based on like iron meta so it's\nkind of it's gonna be kind of like\nmyers-briggs but I'm trying to you know\nI kind of said like you're an emotional\nsponge so I'm trying to figure out how\nto like make a test for people to\nunderstand their Ayurvedic\ncharacteristics mmm yeah\nso another random example of how\ndifferent though shows are different so\nVata memory is also dosha dependent so\nvatta's learn things very quickly but\nthey also forget things very quickly bit\ndoes kind of learn things at a medium\nspeed and kind of hold on the things at\nthe medium speed and guffaws are\nactually like kind of slow to pick\nthings up but once they hit their stride\nthey'll be good forever does one of\nthose describe you feel like medium\nspeed what describe me I don't think I\nlearn things quickly or that slowly okay\nI'm not sure yeah so we all have all\nthree elements within us and they're\nkind of like at different levels but\nanyway so here's a question free for you\nso someone's asking you how do you stop\nthinking about your ex any ideas\ntime-space you could contact fully well\nmine was I don't know if this is true\nfor everyone but mine cheated on me so\nit was easy for me to kind of cut yeah\nlike a bad thing the more time and space\nyou have away from them I think the\neasier it gets\nyeah okay yeah that's that's all I can\nthink\nHaley so just to kind of echo what\nLily's saying I want you guys to\nunderstand that your mind is going to\nthink about what it gets exposed to\nright so like if you think about like\nwhy did we start talking about Tammy\nbecause Tammy was here yeah and Tammy\nBart and\ncan be presented and himself yeah he's a\nboy she's so so she presented herself\nand so we started thinking about her\nlike if you you know if you watch like\ntwitch and you watch gaming on Twitch\nand you like watch a game then like\nyou're gonna be more prone to play it\nbecause it's gonna be like kind of top\nof mind for you so in in I think Lily's\npoint is really spot-on that like time\nand space is very important because you\nwant to decrease the exposure that you\nhave to your ex now the other important\npart here is that you also need\nadditional exposures because if you\ndon't give your mind something else to\nfocus on it's gonna sit with the\nthoughts that it has from your ex and\nyou can just me in your room you're\ngonna be thinking about your ex all the\ntime so the more that you reduce contact\nand the more that you give your mind to\nother exposures the less mechanically\nlike your mind will automatically spend\nless time thinking about it so basically\nexactly what Lily said so another one\nfor you Lily so you ready to put on your\nyour Zen master hat okay how do you be\nvery happy but still understand it won't\nlast forever\num this is my opinion okay I'm just\ngonna if I if I'm happy and there's a\nreason to be happy I just want to enjoy\nit while it's there I mean I think the\nfact that it's not there forever it\nmakes it even more special and it makes\nme want to treat it even better does\nthat make sense it's like living freely\nhonestly where I'm gonna die one day\nbut sorry that sounded really weak you\nknow keep going but it's but it's true\nthat we're all living now and I'm happy\nnow so I'm gonna enjoy it while it lasts\nit's how I feel about living in the\ncontent creator house - with all my\nfriends I'm happy now I know it's not\ngoing to last so that makes me even more\nspecial cuz I know it's temporary yeah\nbeautiful [ __ ] [ __ ] beautiful oh\nand here I thought that for a moment\nthat that asking you to put your your\nZen master hat on would create in you a\nsense of expectation\nthat would prevent you from accessing\nyour Zen master\nbut you access to your Zen master I\ncompletely agree so I want you guys to\nthink about this how do you be very\nhappy but still understand it won't last\nforever the only way to be really happy\nis to understand that it's not gonna\nlast forever that's okay right so if if\nyou like if if you think that something\nis going to last forever and that's what\nyou expect you won't actually be happy\nhappiness exists in the present it\ndoesn't exist in the future and the more\nthat you think about holding on to\nsomething the more that you want it to\nstay this way like like them the less\nhappy you're going to become you're\ngonna become like a miser who's like you\nknow hoards a bunch of money but never\nspends it because they want to like be\nrich and that's not like that's not no\nway to live life right money is there to\nbe used happiness like these experiences\nare meant to be enjoyed for what they\nare in the present now they're not meant\nto be like you held on to for the future\nso then the question becomes why do\npeople try to hold on to things that\nlast forever so that's not an issue of\nhappiness it's an issue of security it's\nan issue of insecurity right why do you\nneed guarantees that something is gonna\nlast forever because you're not\nconfident that you will be able to find\nhappiness without it so if you are\ntrying to make your happiness last\nforever like you that's just not going\nto work it's an oxymoron happiness comes\nfrom being in the present just like Lily\nsaid it's actually the the temporariness\nof the flower that enhances its beauty\nit allows us to sit with it fully\npresently in the moment now and do what\nit is like appreciate it for what it is\nand I think that's what I hear from lily\nis like she's just living like in the\npresent and she understands this stuff\nisn't gonna last forever so be it but\nsomething has changed where she started\nto be confident about the future and\nbeing confident about the future is\nabout being comfortable with yourself\ntoday\nand that's really what I sense from you\nand that comes that goes back to her\nacceptance right so she accepts that\nthis is the person that she is and she's\nnot perfect she's emotionally sensitive\npeople are gonna hurt her it still\ncauses her problems but yeah I don't\nknow if you guys can see this but like\nher acceptance of that is what allows\nher to treasure that's what allows her\nto tolerate the transience of the\npresent because she's like accepting it\nand like that that's what gives her the\nstrength to appreciate and enjoy and\nlove what she has now it was great\nfantastic okay can we keep going cuz\nyou're doing a great job grace\nhow do you how did you learn how to\ntrust people again I can't imagine how\nI'd ever convince myself to trust again\neverything is a risk you only live once\nand every time I feel when we fall in\nlove with someone you're kind of\naccepting the fight yeah things can go\nbad but I don't that's just a risk I'm\nwilling to take [ __ ] it\nlike why not yeah so beautiful I like\nhim he likes me and we're willing to try\nthat's always I mean I guess yeah okay\nso beautiful so so when she says [ __ ] it\nthere's a Sun script word for that that\nword is Vairagya and Vairagya means\ndetachment so we've talked about this on\nstream before what I see Lily doing is\nnot trying to control the outcome of\nthis relationship you acknowledge that\nthere's a risk you acknowledge that\nfailure is an option and yet you give it\nyour all yes right so this is the\nessence of living in the present this is\nthe essence of focusing on the action\ninstead of the outcome a lot of\nsuffering that people have is because\nthey get caught up in the outcome they\nonly want a relationship if it's gonna\nlast forever they want an a on the test\nthey want to make a million dollars they\nwant to get hired they want to do that\nit's all about outcomes outcomes\noutcomes it's about something happening\nin the external world but here's the\ncrazy thing we actually don't control an\nof that there is nothing Lily can do to\nmake her relationship successful she\ncan't do it I know it sounds bizarre\nthere's no way that she can control this\nthe outcome of this relationship she\ncan't there's nothing she can do to live\nhappily ever after it's impossible all\nshe can do is live today she can focus\non trying to make she can focus on\nmoving her relationship in the direction\nit needs to go today you can have\nanother conversation to clarify\ncommunication so that you guys are\nbetter off for tomorrow but there's\nnothing you can do to control that\nyou're gonna be happily ever after right\nand I'll kind of say this about my own\nrelationship so I'm really happy for my\nrelationship and I've come to realize\nhow fragile of a thing it is that no\namount of years behind us means that\nwe've got it like in the clear that our\nrelationship has new challenges and new\nstresses and despite loving each other\nvery much that like you know bad [ __ ]\ncan happen in a relationship even if\nit's a really good relationship and\nrequires constant work you have to focus\non on your actions today instead of\ntrying to like secure an outcome for\ntomorrow and the more that you do that\nand that's what I hear from really like\nso Lily's not saying so her ability to\nbe like peaceful in this relationship\ndoesn't come out of her controlling the\nrisk of something bad happening it\nactually comes from her surrendering to\nthat risk she acknowledges that there's\na chance they may this may not work out\nbut you know [ __ ] it I'm gonna try I'm\ngonna try I'm gonna try so you can't\nconvince yourself to trust people again\nall you can do is trust people again and\nunderstand that you're gonna get hurt\nyou could get hurt but you have to let\nyourself be willing to embrace the pain\nand the biggest problem that I see from\npeople that I work with and to a certain\ndegree twitch chat is that people are so\nthen their fear of pain allows them or\nprevents them from living today they're\nso concerned about being hurt again that\nthey never engage in a relationship\nyou're stuck Ness comes from a fear\nof pain about what could happen it\ndoesn't come from actual pain it comes\nfrom the hypothetical possibility of\npain down the road and so then you won't\nyou won't let yourself trust again\nyou won't open yourself up you won't\ngive yourself over to someone else and\nlet them like give them the potential to\nhurt you and it's just not how how it\nworks like you're gonna be stuck and\nwhat lily has done is say [ __ ] it and\nshe has she has possibly opened herself\nup to even more hurt than she felt\nbefore and also is is enjoying it in the\nmoment right and and you know Lily we're\nhere to support you of things you know\nif you're struggling in some way by the\nway just that way but I think it's I\nhave a good feeling about this oh man if\nit doesn't work out you're the first\nperson I'm gonna mess up septic well\nthey're little you could blame me okay\nso okay so last question how do you move\npast the honeymoon phase and continue to\nmake it work we used to have open\ncommunications like Lily has has been\ntalking about but he has retreated back\ninto his more loner type shell recently\nand it's hard to get him to talk talk to\nme about deeper things anymore I was\nthinking the same thing I can't relate\nto this right now yeah it's hard because\nI mean in the beginning you think yeah\nwe're always going to communicate with\neach other we're always going to be\nhonest with each other but things can\nchange and that sounds really difficult\nI'm not I don't know I don't know if I\nhave a good answer for this yeah so so\nlet me try to take a stab at it so I\nthink the first thing is that when\npeople retreat back into their like\nprevious personalities like they're kind\nof maladaptive personalities there's\nusually a cause for that right and and I\nthink that trying to understand a little\nbit about like what has changed in that\nperson's life that's causing them to\nkind of go back to comfort\nso the loner type shell is sort of like\na comfortable place because he doesn't\nhave to let people in and and he can\nkind of you know isolate his negative\nfeelings from other people he doesn't\nwant to show anyone he doesn't want to\nyou know he wants to just kind of\nretreat into himself and um you know I\ndon't know exactly what the gender of\nthe asker is but I'm just gonna assume\nfor a moment that there that she's\nfemale and so I think that your ability\nto like be empathic and recognize that\nthere are deeper things that he's not\ntalking about he may not really\nunderstand that right so he may not be\nable to like put the pieces of the\npuzzle together in the way that you are\nthat they're deeper things going on and\nthat's why he's retreating he may not\nunderstand that he may just think that\nhe's behaving exactly like he used to\nand the really sad thing about this is\nthat there's not necessarily anything\nthat you can do doesn't mean that you\ncan't do anything but I'm saying like\nwhat we're talking about here with Lilly\nis that you can't control what happens\nin a relationship you can only try so\nthere's no magic answer here that's\ngoing to get him to open up you can\ncertainly try in their conversations\nthat you can have but the first thing\nthat you have to accept is that if you\nwant your communication to go back to\nthe honeymoon phase you can't do that on\nyour own it takes two people and we\nheard that from Lilly today right so it\nsounds like the person that we shall not\nname is also makes a sincere effort to\nlike communicate and be open and and it\ntakes two to communicate so the the best\nthat that I can kind of offer you is to\nlike start by asking an open-ended\nquestion so ask your partner like what\nit like how do you feel about how a\nrelationship is going are there things\nabout it that you're concerned about or\nthe things about it that you're happy\nabout like what what are we doing well\nand what are we doing not so well and\nthen be transparent with them about\nsaying hey I feel like you're kind of\nretreating into yourself and that we\nused to talk a lot more this is the\nreally tricky thing once you say\nsomething like that they're gonna get\ndefensive and the main thing that you\nhave want to do is disarm that defensive\nmiss in the way you disarm that\ndefensiveness is by making it an us\nissue and not a you issue right so\ninstead of saying you're retreating into\nyour loner shell can you please change\nsay like hey what's going on like how\ncan we understand like I used to feel\nmore connected to you and I'm having\ntrouble like feeling that way can you\nhelp me understand like how how can I\nfeel like I don't know if it's on me\nright because this could be on you too\nit may not be that he's a loner it may\njust be that you're suddenly like more\nneeding more emotional support and maybe\nyou're the one that's changed so\nacknowledge that possibility to them and\njust acknowledge that you feel like we\nused to commit communicate a lot more\nand you feel like we're not\ncommunicating as much and then ask your\npartner what they think about that and\nwhat can the two of you do about that\ntogether is there something that you're\nsaying that causes him to retreat or is\nhe frustrated by things but just make it\nabout us this is the big thing big big\nbig big thing and this is why I'm also\noptimistic about lily is because it\nsounds like the relationship is a\ntwo-way street it's it's not about two\nindividuals in a relationship the\nrelationship becomes the unit it's not\nno longer about me and you it's about us\nand we and the more that you kind of\nframe things towards like that I think\nthe less you'll disarm defensiveness got\nit\nalright last thoughts or questions Louie\nno this was a nice conversation yeah I\nreally enjoyed okay yeah was that is\nthat our goal is that I came very easily\nokay I almost cried when you were\ntelling you about your there were some\ntears coming up tears of joy yeah joy\njoy joy joy sadness joy yeah that's like\nokay well that's okay I mean you know\ncrying's not bad okay well thanks a lot\nfor coming on again and and I really\nenjoyed talking to you and I'm really\nhappy for like you know where you've\ncome and I'm optimistic for you and I'm\nrooting for you and if there's anything\nif there's any way that you know we can\nsupport you or help you or things like\nthat then then let us know and strong\nwork and good luck take care good luck\nin your work\nokay"
