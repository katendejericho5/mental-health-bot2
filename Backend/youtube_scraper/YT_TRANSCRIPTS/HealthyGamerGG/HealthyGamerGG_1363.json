    "transcript": "and what am i calling you by the way\nwhat do you go by uh you can call me\npull yeah Paul okay yeah okay so let's\nget started in just a second okay\nand Paul where where are you joining us\nfrom I'm currently in London UK okay\ncool\nyeah feeling nervous yeah so I might as\nwas lined up as maybe the backup last\nweek so I understood that I might be\ngetting on the show last week but since\nI didn't I had the whole week to sort of\nlike ponder it and be anxious about it\nyeah because obviously like airing your\ndirty laundry in front of a live\naudience as well as a nobody is is\nactually quite a daunting thing but um\nI'm super excited to be on I'm a fan of\nthe show yes kind of weird to be on this\nside of the screen you know are we a\nshow is that what we are I kind of feel\nlike maybe that's just how I rationalize\nit to make it seem less the one thing I\ndon't know okay no I mean I think it's a\ngood characterization it's just I didn't\nrealize it so Paul you're joining us\nfrom the UK right I think we're we're\nalive yay okay so our hypetrain did\nsomething can you explain to me what a\nhype train is me yeah like do you know\nwhat that is I got a line from from I\nmean the meme is it's a scam train so\nall I know is this twitches latest scam\nto draw more money other people who are\nfoolish enough to surrender it I guess\nbut okay I are constantly I've ever\ngotten on one myself okay so Paul so\nhelp us understand a little bit so for\nthose of you who saw an ad I apologize\nbut Paul was just filling us in a little\nbit about how daunting it is to share\nyour dirty laundry over the Internet in\nfront of thousands of people and I\ncompletely agree with you man it sounds\ndaunting so tell us help help me\nunderstand a little bit about what we're\ntalking about today and how we can be\nright so I mean when I submitted the\napplication I just put down in cell is a\nbit of an attention-grabber I don't know\nlike I don't really identify with that\nterm\nthe raw definition of it applies right\nso it stands for involuntary celibate\nwhich isn't just another way of saying\nbasically you can't get a girlfriend\nright and that's as far as that goes\nit's okay it's a it's a loaded term if\nyou look it up it's all kinds of\nnonsense or so you like to be an insult\nyou also have to be a misogynist you\nalso have to be part of a conspiracy so\nI I leave all that I'm not a so she do\nokay and and so you say that you kind of\ndon't you do identify with being in and\ncelery you don't identify with being no\nI actually don't okay it seems I don't\neven really know like the full\ndefinition but like sorry the raw\ndefinition applies but if you you I\nguess to be officially a member of\nwhatever that's all about you have to be\na whole bunch of other things which I\nhope don't apply because they sound\nterrible like what like a misogynist\nwhat I mean so I guess it's thought that\nin cells were a product of their own\nflaws which is that you know well they\nof course they can't be attracted to\nsomething they hate right so they hate\nwomen but also I guess they also want to\nbe with them I don't know okay um I\ndon't think that's the case I'm I hope\nit's not my case I'm sure you're sure if\nyou go down a line a questioning little\nreveal it one way or another but I don't\nthink that applies to me because okay\nsome there's some you know ladies I like\nand some I don't and isn't it it's not\nbecause they're female or or not it's\njust based on something else\nI'm confused what's based on something\nelse\nI mean whether or not I like someone\nisn't based on their gender is what I'm\ntrying to say got it okay so what do you\nidentify with so what what are we\ntalking about if we're not talking about\nthe whole complex of what it means to be\nan insult fine\nwhat are we talking about I guess we I\nguess we're just talking about like how\nis it that I have failed I'm like I'm 35\nin a couple of weeks and I've never had\na girlfriend like how is it that I'm in\nthis situation and how is it that I\ncan't seem to get out of it\nsure so I think that sounds applicable\nto twitch like yes so so I feel a little\nbit it's weird that I'm I was the one\nwho's picked I feel like this probably a\nlot of people in chat who envy the\nposition I'm in they would like to be\nhere instead but I'm hoping the AoE\nhealing thing is actually gonna be\nrelevant to more than just me right\nI hope so too because it looks like\nwe're not gonna be healing in cells\ntoday because you're not in itself so\nwe're gonna be young people okay yeah so\nI I just got to say we got it we got it\nI think this is gonna be really\nhopefully helpful for you and if you are\njust if you if you identify as a\nfull-blown insel with all of the\ntoxicity and hatred that I know that is\nperceived as I love to talk to you if\nyou're watching on stream is this\nsomething you can help with oh cuz it's\nnothing to do with being a healthy gamer\nright I don't even know if this is like\nis this something you specialize in or\nlike do you really is what something\nthat I specialize in not having a friend\nor or feeling itself you don't have to\nbe these things just as I specialize I\nmean you know how to\napproach this topic which one is being a\ngood because it's an insular or having\ntrouble finding a girlfriend the\nlaughter the one that applies in my case\nyeah so am I an expert in that no okay\nso so this may surprise people I'm not\nan expert in pretty much any anything\nthat I'm not an expert in any person\nthat comes on stream right so my expert\nin the person but obviously you you deal\nwith eggs X in your day job on a regular\nbasis you must be pretty good at dealing\nwith the kinds of issues they have and\nobviously you purport to be about being\nhealthy gamer so you must be pretty\ndecent at dealing with with gamers but\nso this this seems like the sideline to\nthat yeah so um so apologies if this\ngets kind of academic but I think it's\nkind of a good discussion AB so you said\nI work with execs so I must be good at\nthe issues that they have that I\nactually disagree with so I think the\nbiggest thing that makes me effective is\nthat I do not assume that a class of\npeople has a class of issues right so\nlike that's what's different like that's\na big part of who I am and I think part\nof the reason that I help gamers is\nbecause I don't think that their game or\nissues like the whole problem around\ngame or mental health is that the rest\nof the world treats them like they're a\ndifferent person and so we say like oh\nyou're suffering because you're a gamer\nit's a gamer issue and they kind of like\nmarginalize and get keep a community my\nwhole belief is that like there aren't\nexecutive issues there aren't gamer\nissues there are just people issues and\neach person is individual and each\nperson is unique and I'm not like an\nexpert in ADHD do I think I can help\npeople with ADHD absolutely do I think I\ncan help people who have trouble finding\na girlfriend absolutely have I struggled\nand had a lot of shame and and just been\nterrible around women absolutely okay\nright so like all those things are true\nbut I I think my whole point is that\nlike you shouldn't think about yourself\nas a class of person because you're\nright so like if you think about it you\nhave your own unique challenges and just\nbecause there's an AoE effect doesn't\nmean that someone who's watching you is\ngoing to learn from you like the AoE\nhealing understand this very carefully\nokay\nthe AoE healing happens because you see\nsomething happening you see something\nthat you think applies to you and then\nyou look within yourself and you go\nthrough it in here it's not that you\nlearn it from out there you actually go\nthrough it in here and then you change\ndoes that make sense it makes sense\nlogically I don't know if I can relate\nto it\nI can certainly honor but I think if the\nshort answer that you're at like short\nquestion that you're asking is do I\nthink I can help you absolutely sorry\nsometimes you guys have to remember that\nI'm an academic and if you ask me a\nsimple question I'm gonna give you a\nreally long answer that you didn't ask\nfor it so I apologize but that academic\ndistinct I mean I think it's important\nunderstand reasons my anxiety a little\nbecause I know we don't have a lot of\ntime sure why don't we have a lot of\ntime well I mean there's you've got a\nlike maximum a couple hours and then you\nhave to do something else right yeah\nyeah I mean a couple hours no time well\nto do what I mean it's me sure I mean\nlike part of me like because because\nwell you know I watch a show very\nregularly and a lot of a lot of time\nlike these pearls of wisdom\nsometimes even like profound pearls of\nwisdom they almost seem counterintuitive\nout of context come out of your mouth\nand they're they're amazing that's\nexciting to watch and it's interesting\nto learn from and I want something like\nthat for me that I can pin up on my wall\nand if as long as I remember it every\nday I'll never be an N so again you know\nthat's a lot to put on you it's probably\nimpossible but that battery you ready\nfor the first you ready for the first\npearl is ready the how is it that you\nalready got one I think well I mean\nbecause you gave it to me buddy so just\nthinking think about the way that you're\napproaching your problem right you're\nyou're thinking that some like I'm gonna\nsay something magical like so here's the\nthing you go by Paul right in your mind\nthere's the Paul before and there is the\nPaul after no no before before and after\nwas after me\nfor and after the wisdom right now that\nyou're gonna learn something here today\nthat you can stick on your wall and then\nyour life is gonna be different that's\nwhat I'm hearing from you I mean that\nwould be nice but I don't know if that\nmeans I'm two different people I think\nto absorb whatever wisdom there is is\nsomething that is not instantaneous but\nI completely agree good so let's just\nlet's just look at that right because I\nwonder if I'm with you and I think\nyou're us you're clearly a very smart\nguy I think you're clearly a very\nlogical guy and when I repeat back to\nyou what I hear you start to poke holes\nin it which is very good but also you're\nthe one who gave me the image of getting\na pearl of wisdom putting it up on your\nwall and then like that's like clearly a\nbefore/after moment right does that make\nsense like that image is like before\nit's on the wall Paul's life is a\nparticular way and if I give you the\npearl of wisdom if it happens and you\nare transformed I mean I would be super\nwouldn't it I don't actually believe it\nthat's a very feasible thing but I\ncompletely agree and just because you\ndon't believe it's feasible doesn't mean\nthat you don't want it or you don't\nfantasize about it\nit doesn't mean that targets high you\nknow set lofty goals okay sure yeah okay\nso let's just put a pin in that for a\nsecond so help me understand a little\nbit about so your corner quote problem\nis that it would you call it a problem\nis that you haven't been able to find a\ngirlfriend sure that seems like a\nproblem\nyou don't seem to be identifying with it\nuh what makes you say that\nOh or just your response mistake on my\npart\nso would you say that that that's your\nproblem yeah I think so okay so help me\nunderstand of hard to nail down but yeah\nit if you could go over the details and\na high level that is the problem yes\nokay so tell me about the details\ncome on you said if you gloss over the\ndetails then yes so that implies that\nthere's something a little bit more\ncomplicated to your situation that\ninvolves the details so let's talk about\nthe details yeah I don't already know\nwhere to start with that though okay\nso tell me to pause for a second okay\nokay can you just tell me a little bit\nabout where you grew up\nsure like from from like what we're\nstarting when not like where did you\ngrow up well I grew up in a few places\nafter I moved around a lot yeah I moved\naround a lot because of my dad's job and\nhe's the provider so we moved wherever\nit if his job is moving we're moving\nokay\nit's a little bit of a fragmented kind\nof so that mostly happened and like in\nthe primary school years which is I\ndon't know what you call that America\nbut like the first school you go to yeah\nsure\nso from like the first time we moved as\nwhen I was five and then the next two\nyears seven and then again it went\nonline so you sort of like you develop a\nfew friendships but then you have to let\nthem go and start again on us and I've\nquite you know every two years it's\npretty regular basis about eight Wow\nwhat kind of work was he doing um he was\na nuclear safety officer or something\ninteresting yeah I don't know the\ndetails but so worked in a nuclear power\nplant it sounds like it was hard to kind\nof like reset in terms of friends and\nstuff like that I think you grow some\nkind of detachment right you sort of\nlike get this idea that well friends a\ntemporary I'm kind of worried that that\nis actually like something that I\nsubconsciously learned from from that\nbut also I was never really that good\nwith people anyway it just made the\nproblem worse like whenever like yeah\nplease I just had this memory like from\nwhen I was in year 3 or whatever when\nyou're 8 years old it's pretty early on\nand I had like a group project and I\ndidn't I think I think my mother even\ngot called in like the some time later\nthe teacher was had a concern about my\ndevelopment\nlike I I I preferred I didn't want to do\nthe group project with other people I\njust I had my own ideas and I guess I\ndidn't want to like convince them to do\nwhat I wanted to do it would be much\neasier if I just took all the materials\nand built a thing myself\nwhatever we were doing no I'd rather do\nit might do it by myself\nwhich caused some some concern I guess\nI'm not even sure if I'm remembering\nthis accurately at all because it's so\nlong ago but I I guess I have that\nmemory so I must journal true so it\nsounds like you you know it was\ntroublesome to deal with other people\nand it was actually easier to just live\non your own and that's that's what I do\nlike in my idle life last since that\nsince I left home I I live very much\nalone yeah so what do you think about\nthat I think it suits me I completely\nagree then so then the question is sort\nof like well is it strange that I said\nthat no because you this is it's almost\nit's almost like a meme your personal\nmean you you always you always say that\nso would you like to understand why I\nagree please yeah so like for you just\nsaid right so like you said that in the\nwhen you were 8 years old when your\npersonality was beginning to develop and\nyou were starting to become the person\nthat you are it just suited you to work\non your own like you just rather prefer\nlike you were more comfortable yeah like\nit's not a stretch to then for like you\nto 30 seconds later say it just suits me\nto be on my own oh it's like yeah and\nlike you just told us well of course of\ncourse I mean that that much is obvious\nbut we just jumped from me being like\neight to me being 35 and they missed out\neverything in the middle and I don't\nknow they does it be even matter maybe\nnot I guess well as that doesn't pearl\nof wisdom number two so just think about\nthat for a second fall does everything\nin the middle matter\nwell if it doesn't they you know dig\ninto it right well just go just get\nstraight to the conclusion well yeah I\nmean so I think this is an important\npoint to make right so we're gonna dig\ninto it absolutely to see if there's a\npattern that emerges but I think my\npoint is that like the people that we\nare are formed in the past right like\nthat's kind of a no-brainer\nright yeah this is a recurring theme for\nsure from the other people you've seen\nvery good so what's the theme well the\ntheme is that how you're nurtured early\non someone's like the butterfly effect\nit sort of echoes stronger and stronger\nthroughout the rest of your life\nbeautifully sad Pro acquisitive number\nthree so this is this is gonna be great\nso like you know I was a little bit\nconcerned that I have to give you pearls\nof wisdom but it seems like we've\nswapped you I actually surprised myself\na little bit with that one but yeah yeah\nwhat was surprising about that I thought\nI'd be too nervous to come out with\nanything profound in this session to be\nhonest that usually huh so I think\nthat's the first letter on the thing\nthat you put on your wall right so\nthat's you actually understanding you're\ndoing it already my friend but but would\nyou hold on so these pros are just just\nlike minor revelations of almost things\nof the like kind of obviously I kind of\nalready know and putting them on my wall\nisn't gonna even be like one step\ntowards fixing my problem these these\nare not really okay Lisa don't I mean\nyou're kind of like smirking like gosh\nyou know they are so I'm not convinced\nof that okay so I want to ask twitch\nchat' question twitch chat and I can\nmute you if you want to because I'm\ngoing to ask him about you do you want\nto hear it or do you want to I'm just\ncurious if they're able to receive so\ntwitch chat is he's squirrelly\nwhat is this Corley is he like dodgy\nlike resisting dodging you guys see that\nis that clear to you\nwell what am i dodging he's slippery\nyou're slippery Oh does that make sense\nin what way so so what I mean by that is\nlike so here's the thing you come so\njust notice your behavior okay you're\ndoing good by the way do you feel\nnervous yeah probably yeah sorry that's\nwhy I wanted was thinking about meeting\nyou but I just I was a little bit\ncurious about whether other people were\nable to see what I was picking up from\nyou so I get the sense that you're\nconcerned that you can't be helped well\nthat was that was an initial concern but\nyou already you already told me that you\nthink I can absolutely right so does\nthat go away once I tell you I think you\ncan yeah I think it does oh I have a lot\nof know what I mean you know doctor take\nthe wheel I actually quite happy to let\nthe rings go and you just you can drive\nthis thing I don't okay so yeah that's\nwhat we're gonna do so I think the first\nthing is that that probably over time\nyou've started to think and I'm\ndetecting from you that there's a part\nof you that feels like it's it's gonna\nbe hard to help you or maybe that can't\nbe helped well I mean that's based on so\nI I briefly saw a guy a CBT guy uh-huh\ncharged me it was charging what I\nconsider quite a lot of money for his\nservices and and this was like six years\nago or so and he sort of laughed at me\nat one point when he yeah yeah that's my\nreaction to when he got the idea that\nmaybe I would only date a virgin and I'm\noh I don't know where he got that idea\nfrom maybe it was even true back then I\nsaw another case now but because I was a\nvirgin like oh I want someone who's like\non the same level kind of thing and he\nsort of laughed like from like like\nyou're gonna find someone like that in\nLondon you know I think yeah I don't\nthink so buddy kind of thing\nand so after the session for whatever\nreason you I didn't pay up front I don't\nremember what the arrangement was I\nthink maybe you like pay at the start\nthe next session for both or I don't\nknow what the arranged mode but for some\nreason I hadn't actually paid for the\nsession yet and he sent me packing with\nsome homework and this is the other\nthings like it's kind of like he'd\nalready prepared the homework so before\nhe'd even met me so it's like it seems\nlike a very standardized course and I\nsaid to him look I got a concern like\nbefore I come and see you again I'm just\nlike I'm not concerned I have a concern\nthat maybe you you can't like do you\nbelieve you can help me because I mean I\ngot kind of got some like Hinn's like\nFFT when he's like laughing I mean kind\nof thing like I have a doubt so I said\nto him can you can you if I'm gonna come\nback for more sessions can you at least\ntell me that from your point of view\nthis is it like you really believe\nearnest in earnest that you can help me\nand his response was well actually\nactually actually may don't don't bother\npay me I don't know I'm not gonna see\nyou again\num you can keep the money so yeah I have\na doubt that I can be helped because\nI've I've already failed to get help a\nfew times fail to get help\nno no no no my friend that's not what\nyou failed to do it sounds like an\nexpert thought that you were hopeless\nthat's not failing to get help that's\nhelp telling you that you can't be\nhelped does that make sense that's an\nexpert telling you that I'm giving up on\nyou yeah I don't know if I mean I don't\nif he's a charlatan or what but I mean\nhe's is that how did you feel when he\nsaid that\nI don't remember his like five or six\nyears ago I kind of and I was very\ndepressed at that time I was depressed\nclinically depressed and I was taking I\nthink so I'd tell a pram or something\nokay if you know if not exactly then it\nthen shortly before after I don't\nremember the timeframe exactly so how I\nfelt it probably actually made almost no\ndifference to my mood because my moods\nalready like rock bottom anyway okay at\nthat time so good now Paul I'm really\nsorry that that happened to you that\nactually sounds incredibly shitty again\nit's water off a duck's back at the time\n- honestly what does that mean like I\nwas like I would you told you didn't\nreally have an effect of that I recall\nat the time yeah but just because it\ndidn't have an effect then and also it\nwas like the fourth so like before that\nokay so definitely I was depressed I\nremember that at the time I lived a\nbetter now so before that had already\nseen like three or four therapists but\nbad ones because I since I was\nclinically diagnosed you're entitled in\nthe UK to free therapy so what happens\nthen is you go to a center and they'll\ngive you the trainees you know you know\nthe ones that are will actually do it\nfor free and they're terrible they don't\nthey don't listen they don't take notes\nthey don't like one of them I most I'm\nonly saw for one session and I was like\nnah this isn't going to work out one of\nthe mice office the full six though\nwhich is what you're entitled to at the\nend of the fifth session I said to her\nbut there's one burning thing I keep on\nit I've wanted to say it's in session\none which never got around to it but can\nyou please remind me for session six and\nI kind of I was kind of saying it\nbecause I kind of had the feeling\nbecause there was no like continuity\nbetween any of the sessions so I was\nkind of saying it kind of is a bit of a\n[ __ ] test so for the sixth session I\nturn up and it's the session concludes\nand she hasn't even mentioned that the\nburning thing I wanted her to remind me\nto bring up and I mean all I can say\nabout that really it's always just under\nunderlines like how bad this this\ntherapy was it was a complete waste of\ntime but I guess I hope I'm such a\ncheapskate I would have bought some I\nguess I can't afford 500 an hour but you\nknow I could have spent something and\nmaybe got better I wasn't like my heart\nwas like fully in it though I didn't I\ndidn't fully believe that it was would\ndo me any good either so that's another\nproblem I'm a look I'm hearing you say a\nlot of different things Paul on the one\nhand I'm hearing you say that they did a\nshitty job and on the other hand ear I\nguess it was mutual we both wielded a\n[ __ ] off yeah so then you're also saying\nthat right I'm also hearing that so this\nthis thread so Paul this is gonna be a\nlittle bit tricky I'm trained in this\nmost human beings are not to remember\nthe sequence of a conversation so I'm\ngonna try to point out some things to\nyou so this started when I asked you are\nyou afraid that you can't be helped\nwhich in turn started because we had\nthis weird conversation about are you an\nexpert in this so like let's just stop\nand think about that right so you start\nthe session by asking me are you an\nexpert in this\nthat's that starts that's not a neutral\nbeginning that's a like a skeptical not\nskeptical is not the right word that's\nactually a beginning that comes from\nfear because there's a part of you that\nbelieves that I can't help you\nI believe in the possibility that you\nmight not be able to so yeah so so Paul\nI think this is the other actually\nreally cool thing is that sometimes when\nI reflect things back at you you\nactually look at them objectively but I\nthink some of the statements that you\nmake are not coming from objective\nplaces so you're actually like you would\nbe very good at CBT because like I said\nas a patient or as a patient I would\nlove to have you as a CPT measure\nbecause you actually CBT is about a\ntherapist being a mirror for you in some\npeople when I repeat things back they\ncan't like they don't CBT is like\nhelping you understand your thoughts and\nthat and you actually your thoughts do\nchange so the tricky thing about CBT is\nlike your thoughts are malleable so when\nwhen I say you know I detect and I'm\ncurious of twitchchat detects this to\nessentially despair despair about your\nsituation and despair that whether you\ncan be helped or not right and and then\nthe interesting thing though is that\nwhen someone is in that despair like\nleaks out and it starts with do you\nthink you can actually help\nthat's the first opening that's the\nopening salvo to our session and and so\nthen but then I say yes I I can and this\nis the magical thing is you say okay\nthat means something to me\nfor a lot of people if I tell them yes I\ncan their despair is so rigid that they\ncan't even like see past that but it\nsounds like you can so that's fantastic\nwell I mean I yeah it's just I have a\nlot of love for you in the work that you\ndo and I genuinely believe that if\nyou're like one of the smartest guys\nI've ever known and if you say that you\ncan help me that's good enough for me\nhonestly okay good so I can't help you I\nbelieve that I've been wrong in the past\nbut you know so maybe I'm the red buff I\ndon't know yeah I think we're gonna have\nwe don't have to vote on who's the raid\nboss right so it's like you can't help\nme if you can't help me I am\nthat's we'll figure that out I guess\nokay so see there it is again\nlike you see that like there's there's\nthis there's a certain calcification\ndurst and that was a joke but like in\nyour mind like I think there's a part of\nyou that wonders whether you're the rain\nboss like I'm the you're the one guy\nthat dr. K can't help do that does that\nmake sense that's exactly that's nothing\nso that comes from a sense that you\ncannot be helped\ndoes that make sense it possible yeah\nand that can everyone be helped with\neverything I don't know okay so don't\nget don't get philosophical on me so so\nwe're talking about you like I don't\n[ __ ] know if everyone can be helped\nwith everything I know nothing about\nthat that's not what I do I don't help\neveryone with everything I try to do one\nperson with one thing but you have a\nquestion no okay sir so then I asked you\nabout you know do you feel like you can\nbe helped and then you tell me these\nstories and what is the point of those\nstories like what are you have it enjoy\nthe stories maybe not so much to therapy\nbecause I feel like if you just go in\nwith with trainees who don't like really\nknow what they're doing any kind of\nrecipe for disaster but\nI guess I didn't know that before I\ntried it but anyway a specially the CBT\nguy and he's chart he I was like eighty\ncritter time for him which seemed like a\nquite a lot of money to me at the time I\nkind of expected more out of that than I\ngot how did you feel when he said don't\nworry about it mate I'm not gonna see\nyou again how did you feel\nI told you that I was ready I don't\neither I don't remember or it was just\nneutral okay good to know and I also\nhave a terrible emotional memory anyway\nI like remembering emotions isn't really\nsomething I'm good I believe that you\ndid not notice or maybe even didn't have\nI I accept what you're saying that you\ndid not notice or even a notice implies\nthat it could have been happening eat I\ndon't think you changed much or you\ndidn't notice much of a change based on\nwhat he said but now expected it to even\nbe asking me in the first place\nasking what if I'm asking him do it does\nhe really believe he can help me I'm\nhalf expecting that he can't right so if\nyou're yeses say that you can't is just\nfirming what I have suspected anyway\nyes very good I'm not because I'm going\nto be devastated by that revelation yep\nand that's still going on here you see\nthat like that dynamic is here so you\nhave more faith in me which is fantastic\nbut just because you have faith in me\ndoes not mean that your attitude has\nchanged like so the faith in me is used\nto overcome your attitude and the reason\nyou can overcome your attitude is\nbecause you have a lot of faith in me\nbut that attitude that you cannot be\nhelped runs pretty deep and is pretty\nstrong yeah well I mean I've been on\nthis earth for quite a few years and\nprobably one of the oldest in cells\naround and I've tried a lot of things\nand none of them have worked so if we\nput away all the stuff that's related to\nmaybe your area like therapy and all\nthat stuff I mean there's plenty of\nother stuff that's more normal that I've\ntried like just hanging around in bars\nand clubs there's not a place I like to\nbe but I tried it for a while at one\npoint I I guess when I was depressed\nespecially I was like well gee you're\ndepressed and what are you depressed\nabout what you're depressed because you\ncan't go well why aren't you even doing\nthe things that you know traditionally\nno\npeople do like go to the ghost of social\nplaces and just hang out there I see\nwhat happens you haven't even tried it\nand you're like you're depressed but it\ndoesn't make sense try it well if you\ngot to lose at that point [ __ ]\nnothing because you're depressed so I\ndid I didn't work out I can't tell you\nthe long story short didn't work out\ntell me about what what happened I\nthought so I heard a little while I used\nto I just went to a bar and I'm teetotal\nbut I drank anyway because it's what\neveryone else does and I didn't meet any\ngirls but I met some guys eventually and\nthey befriend I would say they\nbefriended me around the other way\naround I'm not really like confident\nenough to like opens but they just\ndecided to chat to me and we actually\nbecame friends kind of\nthe they didn't seem to have a lot in\ncommon with me but we did anyway and I\njust hang out hung out with them and did\nthe things they like to do which\nincluded like more of that but also\ngoing clubbing which is like much harder\nthan just hanging out in a bar like I I\nhate everything about clubs just like\neverything about them\nbut yeah but as we did all that for a\nlittle bit until I got until I got tight\nwell actually eventually they moved so\neventually they one of them went off to\nAustralia and the other one somewhere\nelse at around the same time and we when\nwe split then but for a little while I\ntried I tried that and didn't it didn't\nappeal to me and it didn't work out for\nme but I was just I thought I'd give it\na go yeah very good right so once again\nyou're a smart guy you logically looked\nat your situation and you decided that\nyou were going to try something and so\nit sounds like you that have you tried\nthat a couple of different times or that\nwas sort of the main time uh yeah so I\njust went I just went on that little\nbinge it was like a few months of just\ngoing clubbing with them and drinking\nwith them\nokay um did you meet any did you meet\nany girls during that time no so no I\ndidn't although one of the guys was\npretty good-looking and he got off with\na few but for whatever reason his other\nfriend didn't and he was almost at least\nto me so you know my sis is attractive\nand the him and me didn't okay how do\nyou understand that\nlike if his body was also it sounds like\nhe's outgoing and enjoys clubbing and is\nattractive like why didn't he meet any\ngirls over those few months let's talk\nabout him for a second so what the other\nguy who didn't do any better than I did\nyeah why didn't he yeah I guess I never\nfigure that out I mean why didn't you do\nwell let's start there well I mean I'm\noverweight okay\nI'm balding I don't know if you'd know\nthat I don't know how clearly it comes\nthrough on the web\nyeah but sure I think you've got just\nstandard male pattern baldness that's\nright yeah yeah so like you have do you\nhave reasons for your failure right I\nimagine that he must have too but it\nwasn't really apparent to me maybe it's\njust that he was overshadowed by his\nfriend and there wasn't enough to go\naround okay\nso there's another option right which is\nthat the duration of your experiment was\nnot long enough to yield a result like\nif I go fishing and there's a very\nveteran Fisher know I should know I know\nwhat no no no so there was so so so to\nlook at them there wasn't much to choose\nbetween them but actually the other guy\ndefinitely was a much much looser\neven if they drank an equal volumes and\neven if they were equally like how to\ncall in that system he most definitely\nmore outgoing yeah\nyou step outside of your thought process\nand I want you to pay attention to an\nexchange that just happened you gave me\na scenario right you gave me the\nscenario you gave me data and then I\ndrew a conclusion from that data and\nthen what did you do with the conclusion\nthat I drew what exactly I saw you're\nkind of could so you said you said that\nyou know I was it was kind of weird\nbecause he was about as good-looking and\nthen we talked about okay why couldn't\nhe find a girlfriend and you said I\ndon't know and then I said okay why\ncouldn't you find a girlfriend and you\nsaid because I'm overweight and then I\nsuggested to you that perhaps there was\nlike something about the duration of how\nlong you looked which if he couldn't\nfind a girlfriend maybe maybe there's\nlike maybe it just takes longer than a\ncouple of months of clubbing to find a\ngirlfriend and then you came back and\nsaid what well I said but I know what I\nsaid but it's just because I read\nspontaneously remembered something that\nI forgot I thought I'm not disputing\nthat you spontaneously remember that's\nnot I'm not disputing that what did you\nsay\nwell I said that so that the guy who was\ndoing well actually did have a\ndifferentiating factor which was that he\nwas more outgoing absolutely so now so\nnow we're gonna jump into something so\nthis is a cognitive bias okay so like\nlike this is how a cognitive bias\noperates you are doing something that's\nvery subtle so most of the time what we\nwant our mind to do is we have a\nparticular opinion and the world gives\nus data and that data should change our\nopinion that's the reason that we\ncollect information from the world right\nlike if I walk outside like does that\nmake sense like you want your\nexperiences like the process of learning\nis you like have a particular belief and\nthen the world tells you something and\nyour your opinion about the world should\nchange based on the experiments that you\nperform in the world right sure yeah\nyeah something very common happens with\npeople we're instead of using the data\nto change their interpretation they use\ntheir interpretation to change the data\nwell you you thing and they're really\nroundabout way that I'm just making it\nup it's not that you're making it up\nit's true but it's that your mind is\ndoing this little slippery thing where\nwhen I present something to you that\ndoes not fit with your conclusion your\nmind scans your memory further and comes\nup with greater evidence to support your\nexisting belief I mean I just remembered\nthe other thing I don't know absolutely\nI'm not saying you didn't remember it\nyou're the funny thing is you're right\nso now I'm gonna give you an example\nhave you seen any of the videos about a\nhum car and woody do you know what those\nmean\nso those particular terms are not once a\ngroup okay group so so I'm gonna I'm\ngonna give you an example real quick\nokay because I know it seems freakin\nabsurd but it's not irrational what\nyou're doing is not irrational it's not\nstupid it's literally how our mind works\nokay so some so I'm gonna give you a\nscenario so let's say that this is a\nstandard one I use so hopefully people\nwill remember this one so let's say that\nI go into work one day and my boss yells\nat me for being late let's say I work in\nreal estate okay I go in for work one\nday my boss who's the manager so I'm one\nof the people who goes around and like\nsells real estate my colleagues go\naround in sell real estate manager\nmanages the office so he says hey I'll\nlook you're late again you're always\nlate like you got a you know you got to\nbe like on time and stuff like that and\nso like how do you think I feel when he\nsays that like he says in front of the\nwhole office well if he's gonna do it\nthat way you must feel a little bit\nmortified absolutely right something\nsomething happens where like when I feel\nmortified and humiliated sometimes my\nego can activate and I can start\nthinking things like who is he to tell\nme right does that make sense like like\nI sell real estate like what difference\ndoes it make if I show up half an hour\nlater at work or whatever like the\nimportant thing is that I meet my\nclients on time and I sell houses like\nI'm selling houses so like what does it\nmatter like what time I show up he's\njust some office manager he's not\nactually out there selling he's just\nhe's like making my life hard but like\nit doesn't matter like whether I show up\nat 9:35 an appointment at 11 o'clock\nlike who cares what time I get to the\noffice I get my work done I show up half\nan hour later and I leave half an hour\nlater does that thought process make\nsense to you that someone could think\nthat oh yeah some people for sure with\nabsolutely right that's my that I've met\nand these ones yeah and and so so our\nmind does something we're like like is\nthat thought process illogical\nNo\nyes good insubordinate sure absolutely\nso then but but our mind works in a very\nvery funny way it also is like super\nselective about how it retrieves\nmemories so in that moment when I'm\nfeeling that way and I'm thinking these\nthoughts about my boss I'm gonna gloss\nover all kinds of things like for\nexample that the reason that the boss is\nthe manager is because he's the best\nsalesperson in the office that's how he\ngot promoted but in that moment like my\nmind is gonna gloss away from that does\nthat make sense\nsure right and and so you hear all kinds\nof this is what we call a justification\nright so I was in a marriage and I had\nan affair because my partner worked too\nmuch so like our mind does all kinds of\nweird gymnastics to justify what we\nbelieve about ourselves right so like\nthat's that's the way that our mind\nabsolves our self and responsibility\nbecause we don't want to think that\nwe're a bad person so it does more\ngymnastics and if you go to that person\nwho says that they had an affair because\ntheir partner traveled too much for work\nand you try to talk to them and you try\nto like show them a different way their\nmind does the same thing your mind does\nwhich is that it comes up with more and\nmore data to support their existing\nbelief does that sound like can you\nimagine that happening does that sound\nreasonable to you like if I talk to an\nalcoholic and I say you're an alcoholic\nokay and they say you're trying to sure\nokay but are you trying to convince me\nthat I'm wrong of something different\nbecause if not then why are you pointing\nit out I'm pointing it out to you\nbecause I want you to understand what\nyour thought process is doing that your\nthought process has and will point it\nout to you later - okay that you have\nthis this option where like you know\nwe'll talk about something and then\nyou'll give me a set of data and I will\ninterpret that data and we'll send it\nback to you based on the data that you\nprovide and then you will invalidate my\nconclusion with additional data that's\ngonna be the process by which your mind\nworks and we're gonna see it half a\ndozen times over the next hour so just\nlook for it\nHey okay that's all I want to point out\nokay yeah you might be right I mean I\nhave a lot of like stupid mind loops I\nremember that from reckful show I really\nidentify with that thought yeah mostly\nmost of them come from the depression\ndays we sure that they stick with me\nsure so I think this is a little bit\ndifferent I I'm I'm sensing that what\nyou're talking about is a content of\nyour mind is like this like that the\nwhat I'm talking about is the process of\nyour mind not the content of your mind\nokay sure okay so let's just keep an eye\non that because I think that there have\nbeen many times where you've made\nstatements to me and I generally do this\nwhere I repeat back to people what they\nsaid in slightly different language and\nthen you kind of block so earlier if\nthat's what I mean by slippery but\nthat's okay it's not it's not your fault\nI just want you to notice what your mind\nis doing because why I need to notice\nthem huh why do I need to notice is it\nlike a fold or um it's not that it's a\nfault\nit's simply that you play video games\nI've been done - okay so what do you\nplay these days not so much okay what\nwas the last thing oh lately lately\nrimworld actually okay I mean I needed\nit to take my mind off things RIT this\nweek sure cool just came yeah so so like\nlike if you're thinking about rim world\nlike what's the point behind\nunderstanding the mechanics of rim world\nwhat's the point yeah why would you why\ndo you need to understand how the game\nfunctions like what the rules of the\ngame are to not die trust you do well it\nit you need to understand the mechanics\nright yep so why do you need to\nunderstand the mechanics of your mind\nlisten isn't a life and death situation\nthough no it's not but it's to do well\nat life right that's what the whole\nstream is about is that by understanding\nhow your mind works okay you'll get\nbetter at the game of life okay but yeah\nwhat do I need to do what do I need to\ndo differently about the thing you were\ntalking about though the first thing is\nto notice it because you can't you can't\nchange anything about your mind unless\nyou're aware that it's acting right so\nI'm\nand you and I'm learning that it in the\nface of a an opposite conclusion I just\nthrow more supporting evidence of my\nbelief yes thing you're right in saying\nyes that's exactly what I'm saying so I\nwant you to look for it okay and it's\nnot the tricky thing here is it's not\nthat you're wrong\nso that is it not like I mean obviously\nyou know why I do it though rice because\nmaybe if you had that a little bit more\nhe might be swayed you might reconsider\nI don't know absolutely because you're\nconvinced you're right and you're gonna\nkeep on giving me evidence until you\nshow me that I'm wrong that's how your\nmind is working but what I'm saying is\nthat like what you're doing is you're no\nlonger using data from the external\nworld to change your view that's a\nproblem right so this is where like case\nin point I think the reason that you\ndidn't find a girlfriend over three\nmonths okay it is because the same\nreason that your friend didn't find a\ngirlfriend over three months which is\nthat it's generally speaking hard to\nfind it a girlfriend over a three-month\nperiod that's the reason this no right\nbecause a three-month period is not a\nsufficient time span to find a\ngirlfriend okay\nwell what kind of is the rough reference\ngestation period of thought the sequence\n18 months Jesus Christ okay I'm going to\nspeed dating next simple as the point of\nthat so I think the other thing that\nmakes it hard for you to find a\ngirlfriend is that like generally\nspeaking like you're not gonna be happy\nand actively looking if you're blatantly\nuncomfortable and don't enjoy what\nyou're doing\nright like if if I'm a garbage man and I\ndon't like my job my chances of like\nhaving a successful interaction with a\nwoman while I'm taking out someone's\ntrash is gonna be really low so if\nyou're if you're in a bar in a club and\nyou hate being there and you feel\nuncomfortable because you it's it's it\nsuits you to play the game single-player\nand you don't like being in this large\ncrowded place with thousands of people\nand it like makes you socially anxious\nyour chances of meeting a girl not only\nthey like Lowe from a three-months\nstandpoint you're not going to show them\nthe attractive version of you you know\nif there even is one but yeah there we\ngo again can't be helped you see that\nthat's the core belief and now when I\nsay there it is again you can't be\nhelped give me the evidence do you feel\nlike telling me but I really can't be\nhelped\nsomehow you feel okay good good so let's\nsee it no because you keep you keep\ntexting me on this point you already\ntold me I can no I'm not trying to test\nyou on that point I believe you that you\nyou believe that you can what I'm\npointing out to you is the reflexive\nnature of your mind I'm not trying to\ncatch you I'm trying to point out to you\nthat you had the loss of flexion\nreaction to that ball huh I didn't have\na reflexive reaction to that though no\nno but you just said you just said I\ndon't know if I if I can if I can be all\nright yeah right yeah so so that that\nwere that phrase that came out of your\nmouth runs contrary to the belief that\nyou can be helped agreed well yeah I\nmean\nwe haven't yeah well at this point in\ntime yeah yeah so I just want you to\nnotice your mind that's all I'm telling\nyou to do okay we're gonna this is this\nlike super like heady so so like let me\ntry to make things a little bit more\nconcrete for you okay so thoughts\nquestions actually let's just pause for\na second I didn't have anything okay I'm\ngonna take a drink of water okay I\nsuppose the only thought I have is like\nwhen do when do we get to the when do we\nget to the fixing me part because it\nseems I don't know how is this is this\nis this is this this is part of it like\nI feel like we're correcting god I hope\nso\nI just feel like it's like how does this\nfeel to you feels like a lot of\ndigression into um random things yeah\nwhat what about what we're talking about\nis random what are we talking about\nwe're talking about Hawaii mines work\nwhich is group which would be fine but\nit doesn't seem like it's the way in\nwhich my mind works as it pertains to my\ninteraction with other people or even\nlike the opposite sex like it doesn't\nthat's not coming into it it's slow like\njust about just about anything like you\nare spot-on let my backstory or whatever\nso so can I tell you can I I'm gonna\nrepeat back to you now okay so let's see\nwhat happens so I'm guessing I'm getting\nfrom you that we're not necessarily here\nto talk about your mind in isolation and\nabout something random what we're here\nto talk about is how your mind\ninterfaces with meeting other people in\nrelationships and how the function of\nyour mind interferes with you like\ngetting a girlfriend\nsure\nwe're not talking about like your mind\nand isolation and random things that\nwe're talking about these patterns and\ncrap like that all the patterns we're\ntalking about have nothing to do with\ngirlfriends right is that what it feels\nlike a digression to you yeah I guess so\nyeah okay\nso another way so I'm now I'm gonna try\nto extend things a little bit another\nway to put it is right now like we're\ntalking about just you we're not talking\nabout anything in the outside world\nright okay yeah sure and and your sense\nis that the solution to finding a\ngirlfriend is to like talk about how you\ninterface with the outside world yeah it\nseems like it would be yeah absolutely\ndoes seem like it would be my belief is\nthat it actually isn't okay so I think\nyour biggest problem actually comes from\nhere because if you think about it\nstatistically you're like you like you\nmay be overweight but like lots of dudes\nare overweight lots of dudes are\npartially balding in their 30s you're\nnot a bad-looking guy right I mean you\nmay think so but you know I mean I'm\npretty sure I can generally like you're\nnot like you're just a normal-looking\nguy and and I think that the biggest\nthing that's holding you back is\nactually the stuff in here because in my\nexperience with gamers entrepreneurs\nexecutives housewives this is what I\nthink it's part of me part of me thought\nso too which is why I wanted to come on\nvery good right yeah it's not like I\nthought well I'm just coming on because\nI'm I like the show it's because I yeah\nyeah very good\nyeah yeah right so so I think that it's\nclear to me that you're a smart guy and\nthat you've tried lots of external\nthings I'm not an expert in dating I'm\nnot an expert in how to meet women\nwhat I'm an expert in is how your mind\nworks and I'm definitely detecting\nthings that I think would interfere with\nyour ability to find a girlfriend okay\nand at the top at the top of the list is\nthe idea that you're hopeless sure it's\nevidence-based but yeah absolutely right\nthere it is again\nabsolutely evidence-based it's probably\none day's mile adaptations as you call\nthem around yeah yeah so I don't doubt\nthat it's evidence-based but you see\nwhat you did there\nyou're giving me evidence you're gonna\ngive me evidence to make sure that I'm\nconvinced that you are hopeless you're\nlike but it's evidence-based I'm\nhopeless it's evidence-based that's what\nyou meant right I'm just I'm just\nletting you know where it comes from\nit's not like I just made it up I\ncompletely agree because I think it is\nevidence-based I think the reason that\nyou believe you're hopeless is not\nbecause you're weak but because you were\ntaught so and you were signaled that by\npeople like that CBT therapist for their\nbest to abruptly terminate with a\npatient and tell you yeah I'm not gonna\nsee you anymore is very damaging again\nnot really the damage had already been\ndone that that became way too late to\nreally have a significant impact so in\nin the then I completely agree with you\nI don't think it affected you that but I\nthink it affects you today because I\nthink it is another point of evidence so\nthat really think about it I don't have\nto think about it\nyou don't have to think about you know\nI'm sure you rarely think about when you\nwere eight years old and you didn't want\nto do a group project\nthat's the whole point behind the\nsubconscious is that the actions that\noccur to us and the things that happen\nto us affect our behaviors in our\nbeliefs about ourselves without any\nconscious knowledge that's like how the\nmind works\nhmm yeah but I guess what I'm saying is\nthis logged away with a bunch of [ __ ]\nabout the things that we probably will\nnever have time to discuss and maybe\ndon't need to but that's like a lot of\nevidence that stacks up against that\nwould make me come to that conclusion\nyeah I think so dick okay so I don't\nknow what you're trying to do but I\nthink you're so that so you are giving\nme more and more ammo for my hypothesis\nwhich is that your problem with meeting\nwomen doesn't come from anything that\nyou do externally but comes from the\nidea that you're hopeless and when I\ntell you that you say by the way dr. K\nthat's a very very logical conclusion\nand I have piles and piles of evidence\nto believe to make me believe I'm\nhopeless and I say absolutely it's\nbecause you have all of those piles of\nevidence that the hopelessness is so\nstrong that inner interjects into every\ninteraction you have with female human\nbeings yeah I guess it kind of its kind\nof like pretty much full oh my god I\ndon't think even any more evidence at\nthis point would even make any\ndifference but but that's not what way\nthat's not gonna be a solution is it\nlike how do we get rid of how to be like\nreprogram that absolutely so the first\nthing to understand how you feeling by\nthe way\nnothing's changed I feel like pretty\nmuch the same okay you feel that kind of\nneutral\nsure yes you could say I guess you could\nsay that yeah okay so the your question\nabout reprogramming right I guess I feel\na little bit hopeful though we're\nfinally starting to touch on maybe like\nyeah\nthis could this could go somewhere good\nyes so that's weird because I thought we\njust concluded that you have\noverwhelming evidence that you're\nhopeless in that well you know what\nwe've identified that you've identified\nthat as the thing that needs to change\nwhich is see the see I mean I look I\nhave friends and I have colleagues and I\nhave people tell me things like oh you\nneed to you need to dress smarter or you\nneed to you need to get like regular\nhobbies that are relatable to other\npeople or not you know blah blah blah no\none's ever told me you need to\nlike what you just said right okay\nthat's something new to think about this\njust infuriates me to no end Paul are\nyou a smart guy it's not a trick\nquestion how would I know the answer is\n[ __ ] yes the answer is yes right like\nokay but why are you asking me about\nright now well I'm getting I'm going\nsomewhere I'm going somewhere it goes\nlet's start let's just start with laying\nout or some shits are you a smart guy\nI'm not trying to trap you it's not a\ntrick question I know I look like I'm\nabout to trap you I'm not gonna trap you\nokay so you're a smart guy\nyou're a capable guy I have faith in you\nas a human being okay so if you is a\nsmart guy if you're given a thousand\nsolutions like dress differently and do\nthis and do this if you were given a\nthousand solutions to a problem of not\nmeeting a girl and none of those\nsolutions work what do we know about the\nlike what does that tell us\nwell the credible thing is like some of\nthem I don't want to try because they're\nlike they require changing fundamentally\nWho I am sometimes I get suggestions\nlike that so then I'm thinking do I\nhaven't even tried them so it's got that\nI might have to do this I might be gonna\nhave to I don't think you you are don't\nchange who you are\nno no exactly this will leaves it leaves\nroom for doubt well it's something\nyou've not tried then people are telling\nyou should do it yeah so like at the\npoint that I'm trying to make is like if\nyou try a thousand solutions and you\nhaven't tried a thousand sure there's\nstuff you haven't try and fine but\nyou've tried a lot of stuff right like\nyou've been struggling to like find a\ngirlfriend for years and like over a\ndecade it sounds like yeah well on and\noff a certain point I put it at some\npoint I put the whole thing to bed and I\njust you concluded that maybe it's just\nnot for me\nyep but I keep but I keep seeing there's\nthere what what is what is that it's not\nfor me that's the can't be helped you\nsee that you're hopeless like that yeah\nwell the it's a you can't keep chasing\nsomething that there's other things to\ndo with your time right it's kind of\nlike that fury 18 to like go after\nsomething that you're clearly not good\nat at some point you just [ __ ] give\nup yeah how does that\nthat's is that it conflicting because in\nsome ways it's therapeutic so you no\nlonger to think you know I could long\nhave to worry about it if it's not only\na goal to strive for something that\nseems hopeless\nthen that's therapeutic because well it\nrelease it's comfortable because you\njust couldn't use put it to bed you\ndon't but you keep relapsing and coming\nback to this idea like so like I lost\nlike ten kilos or fifteen kilos a couple\nyears ago and I saw and then I got like\nsome fresh new clothes I thought well\nyou [ __ ] put the two and put those\ntwo things together maybe I should give\nit another shot and it didn't work out\nand then like okay well [ __ ] I guess I'm\njust lose more weight I know I don't\nknow what I don't know what I need to\ntry and do but you keep relapsing and\nlike giving in them giving it another go\nbecause you get all these kind of like\ndata points from other people like that\nI really [ __ ] happy in their\nrelationships and like you never had one\nso it's like at least one I have one one\ntime just to see what it's like for me I\nmean they sing to you having a good time\nwith it but so now we get to the core\nokay because you have so being hopeless\nis protective do you get that giving up\ngives you comfort you see that and then\nevery once in a while your loneliness\nRises and you say I want that I'm gonna\ntry again you let yourself hope and wait\nyou let yourself hope you get smacked in\nthe face yeah yeah and and then being\nhopeless and giving up becomes even more\ncomforting because you have tried and\nyou have tried and you have tried and\nlife has smacked you across the face\nover and over and over again so why the\n[ __ ] why the [ __ ] even bother it's\nimpossible let me just accept that this\nis never for me let me be hopeless let\nme conclude that I can't be helped\nbecause if I tell myself I cannot be\nhelped I don't have to be hurt anymore\nif I accept it is a isn't is it's\nimpossible and it's if I can do that I\ncan live with that because I can live\nwith loneliness what I can't live with\nis hope and like trying again\nmmm no it's just that so like let's\nlet's suppose it\nlet's just entertain for a moment the\nidea that maybe actually I'm not\nsuitable there is no one in the world\nthat was made for me just let's\nentertain that thought for just a second\nif that was the case if you could\npossibly know that from the future then\nyou would go back and tell yourself well\ndon't even waste your time with it like\nfocus on the things you're actually good\nat and develop those even further excel\nat those right why the [ __ ] it's totally\nfutile to spend any of that effort you\nput into it if you could of course we\ndid week on though like he maybe maybe I\ncame super [ __ ] close maybe I just\nneeded to go a bit further than I would\nwho knows but like at this point you\ndon't know but like when you when you\nstart to collect so much evidence that\nthere seems to suggest that you just\n[ __ ] not bother than like yeah so I'm\njust pack it in III think I think you're\nI think you're right Paul I think that\nyour disease or your reason to pack it\nin is a very good one\nthis comes back to you your problem is\nnot that you're dumb your problem is\nthat you're smart your problem is that\nthe logical conclusions you come to have\nthe force of intelligence behind them\nnot ignorance this is what makes\ncognitive bias so lethal for you because\nthe smarter you are the stronger the\ncognitive biases which you have to\nunderstand about cognitive biases it's\nlike something hijacking your IQ so the\nsmarter you are the harder it is to\novercome your cognitive bias because\nyour capacity to make logical arguments\nand find evidence is very very high\nwhich in turn makes it harder for you to\nconvince yourself that hopelessness is\nnot the right path because you've\nlogically you do this philosophical\nthought experiment well let's assume for\na moment that like some people are meant\nto be alone which is like a reasonable\nassertion like not every billion not\nevery one of the seven billion people on\nthe planet like some of them have to be\nalone right just statistically well it\nworks it works out mathematically like\nif on average there's 50% male and\nfemale\nI just [ __ ] know so it was good yeah\nwhat are you doing right now what is it\ndoing right now pay attention giving you\nthe [ __ ] data is mind Lee\n[ __ ] good one I like this story but\nyou don't need to hear it actually good\nI'm glad that you recognize that you\nlike it this is why your mind keeps on\ngoing there you love that mind loop so\nmuch because it protects you from so\nmany things it that mind loop and this\nis why you have such a strong cognitive\nbias that you can't be helped because if\nyou can't be helped then you can just\nlet abandon it all you can you can let\nyourself go from the roller coaster of\nhope and rejection and hurt and failure\nokay but you've you've proved you've\nproved that several times but when can\nwe start on the like how do we reprogram\nit though this is how we reprogram it\nhow by noticing so awareness precedes\ncontrol ever had dental work done I had\na feeling yeah did you get numb they\nnever you up yeah yeah can you control\nyour mouth when you're numb well you\ncertainly don't want to control it\nduring the operation but uh yeah you can\ncontrol that what you mean you can't\nfeel it yeah so what happens to the\ncontrol of your mouth when you can't\nfeel it oh you you have to be careful\nyou can end up biting yourself you know\nyou notice you can injure yourself yeah\nso as your awareness return so why would\nyou bite yourself it's because your\ncontrol is imperfect\nit's impaired yeah by the degree of\nnumbness right and so if you had one\nfeeling it sounds like they numbed up\njust one part of your mouth yeah and so\nyou had control over you had good\ncontrol over the last bad control over\nhere and you can hurt yourself as you\ngain control as you gain awareness of\nthis part of your mouth what happens to\nyour control over that part of your\nmouth\nI mean we regain control I mean\nabsolutely how do you gain control by\nbeing able to feel your mouth how does\nthat work Paul I'm not unknown\nneuroscientist but I guess because\nyou're receiving signals from the nerves\nin your Union your mouth and yeah so you\nhave no you've no [ __ ] idea all you\nknow is that it's true right more or\nless it's like like you have to be a\nneuroscientist like it's not like people\nwho are neuroscientists are the only\nones that can control their mouth\neveryone can control their mouth sure of\ncourse in awareness precedes control if\nyou ever if you're in a relationship\nwith someone who's super manipulative\nand you don't realize what they're doing\nto you you're gonna get manipulated once\nyou start to become aware that\nmanipulation is happening from your boss\nor a co-worker or a partner then you\ngain control over it you're like oh yeah\nyes that you have to you have to learn\nthat in London because people will take\npeople will uh people will [ __ ] him and\nthey let you scammy whatever in they're\nnot travelling as well yeah if you\ntraveled and so as you become aware of\nwhat they're doing how do you gain\ncontrol over your life like how does\nthat work like is that is awareness\nenough pretty much yeah\nwell there you go you just have to see a\ncut you have to do you have to see it\ncoming uh experience this a little bit\nas well you have to not to deal with it\ntoo good yep so I'm gonna take the first\nanswer that you gave me which is pretty\nmuch you have to know how to do with it\nabsolutely but awareness is where people\nfall short and this goes back to my\nearlier point the reason that I don't\nthink you've been able to find a\ngirlfriend is because you've been\nsolving the wrong problem\nyou've been solving a problem that's\nexternal wear different clothes\nlose weight do this do that go to the\nclub all of your solutions have been in\nan external space I'm sure and I think\nyour problem the reason you can't find a\ngirlfriend has nothing to do with any of\nthat [ __ ] because you've tried all that\n[ __ ] and if that was your problem then\nlogically you should have found a\ngirlfriend yeah ergo you're treating the\nwrong disease yeah okay right so in\nmedicine we make a diagnosis and we\nprovide people with a treatment\nif the treatment doesn't work sometimes\nit's because our diagnosis is wrong and\nyou've been treating external factors\ntime and time and time again whereas I\nthink what's going on is you have this I\nwas about to say soul-crushing but I\nthink what it really is so here's\nanother pearl for you it's a very\nprotective hopelessness well it's not\nit's not a pearl because it doesn't it\ndoesn't state it doesn't state what you\nneed to do it just it is states of how\nthings are yeah which is still useful\nbecause I would never have phrased that\nI guess it is a pearl in a way it's not\nit's not a lot of resolution but now we\ncome back to the first [ __ ] thing\nthat I told you which is that you're\nlooking for the thing that you're gonna\nput on your wall that's gonna transform\nyour life not how it works buddy I mean\nI'm not gonna put on my wool that I have\na protective shroud of hopelessness but\nthere's nothing you can put on your wall\nthis process of growth is not binary\nthat's my point nothing is going to feel\ntransformative to you but is it huge\nabsolutely\nit's little things little things about\nthe way that you view yourself little\nthings about understanding that when you\ngo meet someone we are empathic human\nbeings and that's someone that the girls\nthat you meet are gonna sense within you\nsome degree of hopelessness that even if\nyou try to engage with them you are not\ngonna be carefree right are you saying\nthat are you saying that I worry about\nthat or that that's actually what's\nhappening that people can actually sense\nof it I think people can sense it\nbecause here's what I think people sense\nI don't think people sense you being\ncarefree and when someone is looking for\na mate the number of people who are\nattracted to people who are not carefree\nlike that's what's attractive like\nthat's when you're able to be your best\nself when you were unburdened it makes a\nlot of sense because like how can you\nbecause I went through a spree of speed\ndating as well like I'm like a dozen\nevents and you meet so many people they\nmust have met hundreds of people and\nthey like they will consistently reject\nyou it seems like well and you only meet\nthem like four minutes right so they\nhave to they have to pick up on\nsomething pretty [ __ ] fast so I mean\nthat does that does fit yeah because I I\njust don't know like I wear it on my\nsleeve like how how is it that [ __ ]\nobvious I don't know I I don't know I\ndon't know either I just know that as\nhuman beings were empathic and that I\nthink that like you you know when\nsomeone is carefree and when someone is\nburdened right\nI don't do you know it in the first four\nminutes of meeting them I don't know I\ndon't know worth investigating\nlet's ask twitch at twitch at is this\nguy burdened or is he carefree and did\nyou know in the first four minutes also\nfor you dr. K did I did I seem burned in\nthe first four minutes like absolutely\nokay right it's taken me an hour to\nconvince you that you believe that you\ncannot be helped but I've been trying\nfor an hour I've been trying to point\nthis whole thing out to you for one hour\nwe've been talking about the same\n[ __ ] thing for the last hour twitch\nat CPAC and why as though yes and no go\nback and watch the vine I will yeah for\nthe benefit that I don't have twitch\nchat on because it'd be too distracting\nbut I yeah I know what they're saying\ndon't ban anyone I want to know the real\nI want to know what a Jewett fish that's\nreally saying yeah right so I think\ntwitch at can tell that you're burdened\nokay and that's not your fault it's not\nyour dumb it's just what is right now\nand I think this burden of hopelessness\nhas built up within you and then I think\nlike generally speaking if I'm going to\nlike try to gauge the success of any\nendeavor a human beings belief in\nwhether they can succeed or whether\nthey're gonna fail tends to have a lot\nto do with whether they succeed or fail\na lot of people who say they can succeed\nstill fail very few people who believe\nthey fail success that was the that was\nthe message of a poem my granddad gave\nme\nthat's it that's something that I don't\nknow very well yeah I read it as funeral\nAshley let that exactly that message\nyeah\nyou sooner or later those who succeed\nare those who believe they can is the\nsort of ending of that poem yep you\nbelieve that and I believe it in my\nworking life I do I do pretty well like\nprofessionally sure I should like have a\ncareer in London is actually it's uh\nit's not for everyone to say that yeah I\nbelieve you're very capable but not\nknowing everything I disagree I think\nthe big difference between your\nprofessional careers that you believe\nyou can succeed and the big difference\nin your dating life is that you believe\nyou can't yeah I wonder why that is\nbecause it's it's not like it's not like\nI didn't face a schilit of adversity in\nmy friend actually I had real trouble\nholding down a job partly cuz I'm like\nnot very social as we\nI it's less for problem now hmm just cuz\nI've been through it so many [ __ ]\ntimes like but it was really rough start\nyep so what's the difference between a\nrough start like so what's the\ndifference that's you're asking so\nyou're doing a very good job Paul so now\nyou're looking at your life you're\nreflecting and I think you're actually\nchanging because you're asking yourself\nwhy is it that in my professional life\ndespite adversity I was able to like\npower through and succeed whereas in my\ndating life I have been unable to and so\nmy question for you is when you were\nfacing adversity Paul what did you think\nin your deepest darkest self what did\nyou think about your prospects of\nsuccess did you accept hopelessness\nfirst yes but it's a really hard one to\nanswer because actually the first time I\nlost my first job it wasn't just about\nthe job actually it was the two things\nintertwined it was the climb at a girl\nat work and she ultimately got me fired\nand I and I despaired about that for a\ncup for at least a year I didn't I just\nI didn't work I was unemployed I was\ncollecting the Jobseeker's Allowance\nwhich is what we have in the UK when\nyou're like eventually I obviously\nthrough through necessity more than\nanything I needed money I got back back\ninto the working world but I didn't get\ninto the okay remember you're making\nthis way too easy for everybody so I\nthink your absolute despair after after\nthat work experience I don't think you\ncan look at that as just a professional\nexperience because there was a woman\ninvolved you know so I said that I said\nit intertwined is that she's like both\nof those exactly at the same time right\nso that's a that reinforces our building\nhypothesis that you've never really like\nbeen hopeless about your work you may\nhave been hopeless about that situation\nbut I think that situation was\ncontaminated by a woman yeah yeah yeah I\nguess part of it is like I don't know no\nthat's completely correct after you so\nthis was like 10 years ago see it's easy\nto forget but actually the reason I\ndidn't want to go back into another job\nstraight away is because I was worried\nthat the same thing would happen again\nwith a woman like not so what you're\nright look is the thing it's not\nprofessional never was I've always been\n[ __ ] so that now you ask yourself the\nquestion why have I been able to face\nadversity in my job and been successful\nand faced adversity in my dating life\nand been unsuccessful it's because the\n[ __ ] adversity that you face in your\njob didn't come from your job became\nfrom women it's the same problem yes\nwell okay finds it whether it's not very\nhelpful revelation because it's just\nokay so that we're still concluding that\nmy work has been fine and my dating has\nnot been fine which is we knew that the\nwhole time\nno we did it right so this began when we\nauthentically reflected and scratched\nour heads and said why why did I face\nwhy did I get fired and I was\nunemployment on unemployment for one\nyear why did I not give up hope then and\nwas I truly hopeless and is work\nactually different from women because I\nfaced adversity in both now we have\nconfirmed our hypothesis it's not that\nwe didn't know like we had a suspicion\nbut we should still reflect and confirm\nauthentically so this still comes back\nto then what this means is that like if\nthe big difference between your\nprofessional life and your dating life\nis your internal sense of confidence\nabout whether you can succeed that also\nconfirms that your road forward has\nnothing to do with the shirt that you\nwear or how much you weigh it has to do\nwith your belief about whether you can\nactually be in a successful relationship\nwith a woman okay good okay it's more\nreinforcement I guess what are we doing\nabout it though okay so so I've answered\nthat question a couple times but I'll\nmake things a little bit more calm I'm\ngonna give you what you want which is\nnot what I think is gonna help you but\nI'm gonna give you what you want so the\nfirst thing is I've been saying to you\nseveral times that understanding that\nyour hopelessness is what I think really\nholds you back in terms of your\nrelationships with women\nuh-huh and that so now what I want you\nto do is train yourself to see the\nhopelessness right so when you when you\nyou're going to a speed-dating thing\nthere's the sign good so when you think\nabout the speed-dating thing how do you\nfeel yeah I feel hopeless doctor okay\nthat's changing and the fact that you\ncan laugh at it so this is exactly what\nI want you to do Paul when you go into\nthe speed-dating thing before you enter\nthe door to wherever this place is\nnotice that hopelessness catch it and\n[ __ ] laugh in its face just like you\ndid and when you're sitting across from\na woman and you feel that hopelessness\ncatch it\nlook at it in laughing's [ __ ] face\nand when you laugh like that it's such a\npure and beautiful laugh do you guys see\nthat dude chat and laugh in its face and\nwhen you smile like that you know what\nshe's gonna do gonna pick it up and\nleave no she's gonna smile there it is\nbeautiful you see that look at that\nthat's beautiful look at how much\nconfusing [ __ ] is there you don't even\nknow what's going on you're like what is\nthis but but I'm not in that moment I'm\nnot gonna laughter am i and this\nassuming that I even as you say catch it\nit's hard like what do you think it's\nhard to grasp like there it is\npay attention but in that moment you see\nwell I don't know what just happened in\nyour mind but there was something\nbeautiful and positive and there was\nsomething changed you're a different\nslightly different person now and there\ncomes the thought again like a [ __ ]\nboomerang but it's not gonna work dr. K\nit's really not gonna work I can't\nreally do it can i I can't do this there\nyou see that what do you mean what do\nyou mean that like catch catch the no\nstop for a second listen to what I just\nsaid what did your mind just do Paul I'm\njust I'm just asking you how do you do\nit okay I'm okay like Han okay you're\nasking me to do something I've never\ndone I think no I'm not asking you to do\nsomething you've never done\ncatch the hopelessness you said arrived\nI'm not asking you to do something\nyou've never done I'm asking you to do\nsomething that you did for the first\ntime just now more or less never more or\nless than ever and never very big\ndifferences there's a huge difference\nbetween you me telling you to do\nsomething that you've never done before\nand something that you've done once and\nif you've done it once you can do it\nagain how did you do it I'm not quite\nsure but you've done it once\na couple of times actually it wasn't\njust once you did it a couple of times\nin a row is like multiple orgasms I\ncollect it back there's nothing the only\nwomen have it depends on whether you\nlearn tantric sex is a man no I'm gonna\npretend to know that means but then yeah\nconversation I guess day gotta get you a\ngirlfriend first of all I guess I'm one\nof the lucky few men who also know what\nthat feels like\nhow you feeling I just I want I wanted\nto do what you say I want it to be that\nwhen I go there something is different\nand I just have a doubt that it will be\nyep let me hear that yeah so so be it so\nyou're doing a good job so even now\nyou're doing a better job than you were\nat the beginning of the hour because\ninstead of going and and so at the\nbeginning of the hour your doubt was\nmanifesting his resistance to what I was\nsaying but now already your doubt no\nlonger manifests as resistance instead\nwhat you say is I have a doubt you've\nactually made a huge difference there I\nwant everyone to see that you guys see\nhow he's different he used to just block\nand be slippery and now he says but dr.\nK I have doubt whereas that was the\ndoubt that was manifesting as evidence\nand argument and resistance and now he\nsees there as a doubt go back and watch\nand you've never said like I mean you\ndid sort of but it's very different so\ndo you have work to do absolutely is\nthis easy absolutely not\ncan you change absolutely are you\nhopeless absolutely not can you do it I\ndon't know is it possible I don't know\ncan you do it again yeah\nif you can do it once you can do it\nagain so you tell me how what just\nhappened what just happened man what was\nthat like weird laughing crying like\nwhat was that what were you feeling like\nwhat the [ __ ] was that man I don't know\nactually I don't know okay I I seems\nlike real true short-term memory\nproblems isn't the other no no no it's\nit's it's not short-term memory problems\nit's just you you have trained yourself\nto be unfamiliar with emotions and\nyou've suppressed them so I've just like\nyeah I'm bad with emotions I told you\nalready I have like I'm a bad memory for\nthem maybe it doesn't even have to be\nlong ago like yes sir have you seen any\nof our videos about alexithymia no watch\nthose there on our YouTube channel\nthey'll give you a little bit but but\nhere's the thing so I don't know that\nyou've been so I their hope for you\nabsolutely man convinced now more than\never if you can laugh like that if you\ncan look at your hopelessness in the\nface and [ __ ] laugh at it that was\nlaughing I don't know what you were\nlaughing at but it was something\nbeautiful I don't know it was pure why\nis it why is it what do you mean though\nlike why is it beautiful because it was\nunburdening it why is it beautiful\nactually don't know I don't know it just\nwas like why is this sunset beautiful I\ndon't know like I'm pretty sure twitch\nat loved it too but partly yes of course\nI mean the objective is always to make\nthe guests like [ __ ] break down isn't\nthat right makes a good show do you\nthink that's what the objective is well\nright makes a good [ __ ] huh hard to deny\nthat no I don't think it's about\nbreaking them down I think it's about\nlifting a mop dude this huge difference\nyeah there was something kind of um\nthere was something kind of positive\nabout it in a weird way yeah so here's\nthe thing I I don't think I I think\nlet's just take a break I think this is\nI'm gonna give you a chance to ask\nquestions but I think I know this is\ngonna be a little bit unsatisfying but I\nthink this is good for today right so\nyou want me to fix everything I can't do\nthat this is not something I can do\novernight all right I'll get you to your\nfirst breakthrough buddy but I think\nwhat you need to do now is understand\nwhat happened okay\nso like I don't know exactly how that's\ngonna work I'm gonna have to think about\nit a little bit I think maybe what we\nneed to do is have you come back on\nlater right so I think that if you want\nto work with a therapist again your work\nmay be different this time because now\nyou have something to kind of work on\npractically what I want you to do and I\nknow you don't believe this\nand it doesn't feel like it but I think\nthis is enough so as long as you\ncontinue to see your hopelessness and as\nlong as you can kind of notice it and\nlaugh in its face as you walk and you\napproach women the person that they are\ngoing to see is someone that no women\nhas ever seen before well it should just\nbe clear I don't normally walk an\napproach with it that's why the speed\ndating works is because it forces you to\ndo that I define so I mean I don't need\nyou to walk in approached women because\nyou're a smart guy and you're gonna\nfigure out the external solutions\nyou're probably problem is not in\nfiguring out external solutions like you\nsaid you've already figured it out\nyou're gonna do speed dating fine my\ngoal is in unburdening the pawl that\ngoes up goes its to speed dating and the\nfirst step to that is to recognize that\nthat hopelessness is there and that you\nhave doubt that you'll ever be in a\nrelationship and to just notice notice\nnotice notice notice\njust to notice it doesn't seem like it\ndoesn't see it doesn't seem I feel like\nwhat you're trying to do by notice is\nnot what I\nit's like it you do you have a different\ndefinition because I must have noticed\nit what do you mean no I don't think I\ndon't think you noticed it so what I\nmean yeah you're right I have a\ndifferent definition so what I mean is\nnotice it with distance what distance\nbetween you and the hopelessness instead\nof saying I I'll give you an example\nokay so what's the difference between I\nwill be alone for the rest of my life\nand I sometimes think I will be alone\nfor the rest of my life one is an\nabsolute and one is just a thought\nanother absolutely so another way to put\nit I'm going to be alone for the rest of\nmy life\nmy mind believes that I'm going to be\nalone for the rest of my life what's the\ndifference between those two well you're\ndoing this thing like that you teach in\nmeditation where it's like well you you\nand you and your mind or I don't know\nyour body in your mind or these are the\nlike disconnect what about listen to the\nstatements I will be alone for the rest\nof my life my mind believes I will be\nalone for the rest of my life you're\nright but just look at the statement I\nwould say this I would say the same\nthing again is like you're pretending or\nvery good that your mind is a different\nthing like it's not somehow it's not you\nyes so very good one is an absolute\ntruth and one is a thought so now let me\nask you something Paul when you believe\nthat you are gonna be alone from the\nrest of your life where does that come\nfrom well dude did I believe that that\nwas it just a thought I don't know if I\nreally believed it if I truly believed\nit why would I even be going to doing\nall these things so I I think the\nhopelessness is a something if you heard\nabout some scars if you were like that\nso you have a you have a some scar that\nyou are hopeless and that you will\nalways be alone so sometimes it\nactivates and sometimes it doesn't\nbut when it activates you believe fully\nin those moments that you are gonna be\nhopeless that you will be alone for the\nrest of your life so the first thing to\nunderstand is that the conclusion feels\ntrue to you right like this whole hour\nyou've been giving me evidence evans\nevidence no dr. kay it is true it is\ntrue it is true absolute statements not\nthoughts that's not how you treat them\nbut they are thoughts and thoughts come\nfrom the mind and the mind is not the\nknower of truth we treat it like it is\nbut just think about it for a second the\nmind is not infallible on the contrary\nit's fallible all the time but when you\n- when you believe that to be true it's\nyour mind that's doing it so create\ndistance between reality and whatever\nthe mind wants to do because you've had\nthese experiences at the age of eight\nfirst job that you got fired by a woman\nI'm sure there are other experiences\nbeing rejected by your therapist this\nand that all of these things might not\nfired by your women find because of\nbecause we're so start by noticing and\nwhat I mean by notice you're absolutely\nright may have a different definition so\nwhat that what that definition is is in\nthose moments when you know something to\nbe absolutely true take a step back and\nrecognize that this is my mind that is\ntelling me this doesn't mean it's true\nthat is how you notice to create\ndistance you can also meditate meditate\nis the practice of stepping back from\nyour mind and as you step back from your\nmind something like what happened today\nwill happen again and you will be able\nto laugh and you will be able to laugh\nbeautifully and you will be able to\nlaugh freely and when you were able to\nlaugh beautifully in front and freely in\nfront of a woman she's gonna think\nyou're a little bit crazy and 99% of\nwomen are gonna think you're a little\nbit crazy\n1% of them are gonna fall in love\nbecause that's how it works love is\ncrazy you're gonna feel embarrassed but\none person is gonna like like have you\never seen just like a woman just\nlaughing her heart out and it's there's\nsomething even if you know she's nuts\nthere's something just beautiful about\nthat right like the laughter of a child\nis just beautiful and pure and it's\nattractive or even just a smile but yeah\nyeah if it's an unburdened smile yeah\nand it's been a long time since you've\nhad an unburdened smile my friend I feel\nlike you're just guessing that but\nthat's very true if it's a guess a\nlittle but not what do you all I'm doing\nis guessing buddy all I do I don't know\nanything man well I know about you\nnothing\nit's just guessing right okay well it\nwas good guess\nI don't yeah I don't smile that much\nyeah\nshe smiled beautifully today Thanks\nthat's questions my only thought is like\nhow am I gonna catch my hopelessness\nwith practice so meditate\nmeditation right now because I think\nyou've been through a lot I don't think\nyou're in a good frame of mind to learn\nis that okay I mean I'm fine now but but\nif you know it's okay ya know what what\nI want you to just sit with what you've\nexperienced today and try to process it\nwhile it's fresh in your mind and I have\na I'm concerned that meditation may calm\ndown sure sure\nyeah does that make sense so sometimes\nwhen people have emotional stuff I sort\nof recommend that they don't meditate\nsure I'll take that under advisement\nyou're the expert on that yeah but I\nthink you know you could have you done\nalternate nostril breathing before no\nI've watched it I don't think I I guess\nI approach with a bit of skepticism so I\ndon't always follow along with that part\nokay so I want you to understand this\nabout meditation so you don't you don't\nhave to believe in it it's not about\nskepticism so like if I'm skeptical that\nexercising will cause me to lose weight\ndo I need to believe that huh so he's\njust doing it as sufficient you don't\nhave to absolutely think just do it okay\nyeah what makes it easier yeah you don't\nhave to believe in it it's just gonna do\nwhat its gonna do okay nice right I like\nthat yeah it's like I'm skeptical that\nthis water will produce urine you just\ndrink the water your body will yeah okay\nall right man strong work\nBrowdy thanks doc okay you have a little\nbit of a long road ahead but I think you\ncan walk it okay just sit with this\nwe'll we'll do round two later okay\nall right and I look forward to that\nyeah yeah take care of man good luck\nthanks Jase bye bye okay twitch at\nokay so yeah so like things can feel\npretty circular but that's okay right so\nwe just got to keep at it so I want you\nguys to understand you know for\nyourselves as well like don't give up on\nyourself right like just don't give up\non yourself and yeah just don't just\ndon't give up I don't know what else to\nsay like I don't have any other like\nwise words for you guys and just\nunderstand that that life is not about\nlike so we get so concerned about\noutcomes right we get so concerned about\nfailure we get concerned like heat like\nso he tries to ask out women it doesn't\nwork and then you start to like concern\nyourself with failure and then you start\nto believe things about the future life\nis not about the future it's about the\npresent like action happens in the\npresent and you can't predict the future\nso take the actions that you want to in\nthe moment and stay true to what your\ngoal is our goal there was not to make\nhim break down our goal there was to\nhelp him as much as we can and if he has\na pearl of wisdom fine\nif he doesn't have a pearl wisdom that's\nokay we're just gonna try our best\nyou don't shoot for a particular target\nand he says oh you know you want to\nbreak people down because that's good\ntelevision sure it's good television but\nthat's not worry to here for we're not\nthere yeah it's not what were there for\ncertainly not to break up them down\nsometimes does emotional expression do\npeople resonate with that yeah but I\ndon't think it's like it's not good\ntelevision when you see something\nauthentic and change in another person\nthat's like the reason we go for that is\nbecause that's like the crit heal you\nguys get that that's the [ __ ] heal for a\nOh a healing that's the crit you want a\nfatty crit man need a crit heal so just\ntry to focus on what you need to be\ndoing and focus lay and just keep doing\nso I'll leave this with you guys okay so\nunderstand that gutter ball gutter ma\nmeans action and gaddama has a fart\nwhich means fruit so generally speaking\nthere's actions we take in the fruits of\nour actions right there's like studying\nfor a test and\ngetting an A our society is overly\nconcerned with the fruit of our action\nwe're concerned with the outcome we're\nconcerned with quarterly reports we're\nconcerned with what the stock market is\ndoing we're concerned with the outcome\nwe don't care about the action we care\nabout the outcome if you give the people\nthe option to cheat they will if you\ngive them do you want to work your whole\nlife or you want to win the lottery\npeople say I want to win the lottery\nlike I'd fall into that camp - we all\ncare about the outcome we don't focus on\nthe action wrong way to live life focus\non the action it's not about getting an\na it's about studying as hard as you can\nit's not about losing weight it's about\ndoing ten push-ups every day it's not\nabout finding a girlfriend it's about\nworking on yourself and letting go of\nthe hopelessness that you feel it's\nabout improving your own life right\ndon't focus on finding a girlfriend\nfocus on you and doing what you want to\nthat's the goal and the cool thing is\nthat if we were concerned if guys if I\nwas really concerned about getting a big\nemotional response from Paul I would\nhave given up a long time ago because it\nwasn't happening it's gonna happen like\nI can't do that every time it wasn't\nhappening like it wasn't happening like\nwe're trying for an hour like nothing\nfine but that's not our goal our goal is\nnot to get him to do that our goal is to\nhelp him meet him wherever he is and try\nto move him one step forward so focus on\nthe action focus on where he is focus on\nwhere you are and focus on what you need\nto do today and as long as you do the\nright thing today today today today\ntoday today irrespective of what happens\nthen your life will start to turn around\n140 rejections from medical school\nbefore I got in really easy to despair\nfine.you despair fine I despaired notice\nthe desperation the next day apply to a\nfew more schools the next year apply to\nmore schools the next year apply to more\nschools 140 rejections over the course\nof three years people in my family who\ncared about me were like you should\nthink about Plan B man\nlike you've got a 2.5 GPA like you've\napplied to 400 schools\nno one has accepted you what do you\nthink is gonna happen to third time\naround I don't know right so thank you\nguys very much for coming hopefully that\nwas helpful to y'all\nand let's try to get a real in salon\nthat guy was too wholesome to be in it\nso he was like too good of a person\nlet's get some real like toxic from\nmalevolent hatred of the world let's try\nto work with that and see if we can help\nthat person"
