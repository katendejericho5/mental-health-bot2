    "transcript": "okay it's the first question that I have\nfor you guys control I mean I expect\nsome amount of trolling right so I\ndidn't ask if y'all were gonna troll me\nI asked are you gonna troll me\nconstantly okay just just like give me\nan answer though because otherwise this\ndoesn't work then I'm just like talking\nto myself and typing on a on a Word\ndocument okay so let's start with this\nwhat is meditation let's start there\nwhat is it what do you guys think okay\nbeautiful right so this is perfect thank\nyou guys for not trolling me when I\nasked you to you control now turn troll\ntroll switch back on so people are\nsaying focus they're saying no thinking\nthey're saying reduction of thought\nright so they're saying okay so state of\nmind focusing not thinking awareness a\nway to calm the mind being presence\nbeautiful okay so those those answers\nare good enough okay so let's just look\nat this for a second is this one thing\nor is this more than one thing does that\nmake sense like when I look at these\nthings are we talking about one thing\nare we talking about like more than one\nthing okay some people say one and some\npeople say more so I think this is a\ngreat way to start about meditation so\nlet's let's let's use parts of speech\nokay so state of mind what part of\nspeech is this what is a state of mind\nwhat are we talking about you guys know\nwhat parts of speech are like nouns\nverbs adjectives it's a now a state of\nmind is a noun right okay\nfocusing is what verb very good not\nthinking is what\nverb very good awareness is what now\nvery good right a way to calm the mind\nis what is yeah so so it is a sentence\nwell-played chat so like when we talk\nabout a way to calm the mind like what's\nthe what's the operative\nit's an action right so this is\ndescribing an action does that make\nsense so you guys control troll away\nfair enough\nit's a sentence but this is an action so\nlet's call it an action okay so like\nthis is defining a verb does that make\nsense and being present what is that ah\nnow we get some confusion verb noun so\nbeing is a verb right so let's just\nleave that one so cuz the first thing\nthat I want to point out to you guys is\nthis doesn't make sense this cannot be\none thing right because like if you're\ndescribing something it's either like a\nnoun or verb it's not both which is\nweird like when we think about\nmeditation okay we think about\nmeditation part of the problem is that\npeople talk about okay so like when I\nask people what is meditation they say\nokay like I sit down and I like try to\nempty my mind of thoughts and so that's\nkind of a verb and then other people\nwhen they talk about meditation they say\nlike I suck at meditation when I asked\nhim you suck at meditation what does\nthat mean they say like I can't empty my\nmind like my mind is unable to be\nemptied and then other times I talk to\nmeditation talk to people about\nmeditation and they say like oh yeah I\nhad a really fantastic meditation\nsession the other day and I said well\nwhat makes a meditation session\nfantastic and they're like well I really\ngot into the zone and I was like in this\nlike no my\nState okay talk to meditation yeah so\nthen the question is like well how is\nthat possible like how can it be\nsomething that you do and also like a\nstate of mind so this is where we go to\nSun script okay\nso hot or not be on someone okay so\ntyrannous focusing John is a state of\nno-mind and this is bliss slash\ntemporary enlightenment okay so Sun\nscript is a language so this is so what\nwe translate is the word meditation in\nsanskrit actually has at a minimum three\nwords that all get translated into\nenglish is meditation but these are very\ndifferent things and this is why when i\nask people like what is meditation i get\nall kinds of answers none of them are\nwrong but it's weird because like\nsomething can't be a noun and a verb\nright like that's just not how stuff\nworks either it's an object or it's an\naction it can't be an object and an\naction so now when we get to meditation\nthe first thing to understand is that\nwhen when i teach you guys to meditate\nmeditation is is being used as a verb\nright we say like i meditated for 15\nminutes i'm gonna teach you guys how to\nmeditate today that's a verb so what\nthat really means is that hot or not or\na focusing technique so that erna is the\nprocess of focusing it's a tech it's the\naction of focusing your mind on one\npoint so focusing mind on one point\nsometimes when you're doing Parana and\nwhen you get good at thought or not and\nwhen you focus your mind on one point\nthen you enter a state of beyond so this\nis the no mind state and this is what\npeople when they say like I get\nmeditation what they're talking about is\nthat they have trouble attaining beyond\nand when people say I had a really good\nmeditation session what they're talking\nabout is that they had like they entered\nbeyond relatively easily or they hung\nout in beyond for a while and beyond is\npretty cool because when you're Indian\nso like a sense of self falls away right\nbecause like sense of self comes from\nthe mind you're kind of like just\nchilling tranquil right cuz you're kind\nof just existing and you're peaceful and\nso it tends to be like region\nrejuvenative and if we think about like\na state of no-mind like let's think\nabout anxiety so how like anxiety is is\nlike a super active mind right so if you\nthink about what's going on in anxiety\nyou're having lots and lots of thoughts\nvery rapidly about all kinds of things\nso how is it that meditation is helpful\nfor anxiety well it's two things one is\nthat as you get good at totter now this\nis a skill by the way so Donna is\nsomething that you can like so tyrona is\nskill that can be leveled up through XP\nright so you can train your mind if you\nhave anxiety you can train your mind to\nfocus on something besides the thoughts\nthat it wants to think and if we think\nabout anxiety like anxiety is an\nuncontrolled mind like even people who\nhave anxiety know that it's useless to\nthink the thoughts that they are\nthinking and people want to stop\nthinking those thoughts they don't feel\ngood they don't do you any good it's not\nproblem-solving sometimes it can feel\nlike problem-solving but it's just\nuseless repetitive thought so through da\nda da you can train your mind to focus\nand keep its attention on one point so\nthat can help anxiety the other way it\nhelps anxiety is by entering a state of\nyoung because when you enter a state of\nBeyond you have no state like you have\nno active mind and if you have no active\nmind you can have no thoughts and so in\nthat place you're kind of chilling and\nlike this is exactly why people like\nthis is what people want when they have\nanxiety they want to be chilling right\nthey don't want to be thinking and as\nyou enter the state of beyond all kinds\nof stuff falls away so like when the\nsense of self falls away reduces ego and\nnarcissism right because if you're like\nyou're just kind of like chilling and\nthen when you're chilling like so\nreduces anxiety\nyeah select reduces anxiety like reduces\nthe internal experience of negative\nemotion does all kinds of other stuff so\nwhen we think about why met it like what\nis meditation the first thing is there\nis a verb component and during the verb\nif you're lucky you'll enter a state of\nyawn which is a state of mind so this is\nnot something that you can do you cannot\ndo the on ok so now let's go to the next\nthing so let's talk about the otter and\nbeyond and think of an analogy so I want\nyou to I want to ask you guys\nso who here slept last night anybody\nsleep ok so we're gonna play a little\ngame where I'm gonna pretend for a\nmoment that I don't know how to sleep\ncan you guys teach me how to sleep like\nhow do I sleep\nokay so just close your eyes okay great\nam i doing it they said just close your\neyes I'm closing my eyes am i sleeping\nthis is working this is sleep okay\ngood job okay so let's say I like I lay\ndown relax your head okay I can do that\nso I'm laying down right I'm chilling\nthis is sleep stop talking wait for it\nbe tired first right so you guys can\ntell me whatever you want like you could\nsay okay lay down but that's not sleep\nyou guys can say yeah you're so czar or\nhowever you say that is right like\nyou're pretend to sleep your mind has to\nshut off okay that's what fair price is\nsaying slow your breathing be tired\ncount sheeps so like what are all of\nthose things like so here's the thing\njust go to sleep okay perfect right so\nhere's the thing it is impossible to go\nto sleep you can go to bed but you can't\ngo to sleep sleep oddly enough is not a\nverb that you can do right so we think\nabout we define sleep as a verb we say I\nslept for eight hours last night but you\ncan't actually sleep like it's not\nsomething like I can pick up my phone I\ncan put my phone down I can unscrew a\nwater bottle I can drink the water\nbottle\ndrink the water in the water bottle I\ncan trim two of them right I can do all\nkinds of things so when people say like\nokay so they say lay down turn off all\nyour lights stop streaming close your\neyes and I can do all of those actions\nthose are all actions right but none of\nthose are sleep closing your eyes is not\nsleep getting on your blankets is not\nsleep laying down is not sleep so so all\nof the things that you guys are\ndescribing to me are verbs and beyond\nis a noun okay so this is like going to\nbed and falling asleep sleep is a state\nof mind it is something that happens to\nyou it is not something that you do and\nthat's what's so confusing for people\nright is like you think like okay how do\nI go to sleep because we confuse we we\nthink about sleep is a verb but it's not\nreally something you can do you can go\nto bed but you can't fall asleep so the\non the state of meditation the state of\nno-mind is achieved if cross your\nfingers and you're lucky when you are\ndoing the hot enough sometimes you will\nachieve a state of mind called Veon and\nthat's the meditative state of mind and\nit's just like going to bed and falling\nto sleep as people who have had insomnia\nhave discovered painfully which is\npainfully true is that you can't make\nyourself go to sleep it's not something\nthat you can do you can do a bunch of\nstuff and if you're lucky you'll enter\nthe state of sleep so the first thing to\nunderstand about meditation is that it's\ntranslated into multiple words in\nsanskrit one is a verb is a focusing\ntechnique is a dadada that's like a\nmeditation technique the second is the\ngoal of meditation is to use that\ntechnique to enter a state of mind but\nyou do not control whether that state of\nmind happens you can sort of increase or\ndecrease risk factors for that happening\nright so you can like light certain\nkinds of incense or meditate at the same\ntime every day or do it at particular\ntimes of the day and and so you can\nthere are a lot of things that you can\ndo to sort of cultivate and hope for\nbeyond in the same way that you can\ncultivate and hope for sleep but you\ncan't make yourself go to sleep you\ncan't make yourself enter a meditative\nstate you can just cross your fingers\nand hope there's some things you can do\nto facilitate it so like you know my you\nknow my treatment my personal treatment\nfor insomnia is to eat a burrito and\nthen listen to biochemistry lectures\ntends to work really well for me and\nbecause that's not I can't go to sleep\nfine I'm just gonna listen to\nbiochemistry lectures after eating like\na gigantic burrito and then the\nphysiologic stuff and then like the\nbiochemistry is just so God anomaly\nboring that you know fall asleep\nand so in the same way you can cultivate\na state of mind of Tyana Audion through\ndarkness so this is what meditation is\nokay questions so it's kind of like\nsleeping beautiful excellent question\nokay so we're gonna play this game again\ninsert table so consciousness have we\ndone this before chat is this familiar\nso let's talk about states of mind\nconsciousness and mental activity yes oh\nsorry wait you guys seen this before no\nmental I know mental activity let's say\nthis No\nokay with reckful very good okay so then\nyou guys can help out so let's think\nabout states of mind okay so the first\nthing is what do we call our current\nstate of mind if I have mental Act\nso what are our current state of mind is\ndo we have mental activity right now yep\nmental activity yay or nay actually yes\nright are we conscious yea or nay\nconscious yes yes okay excellent\nso this is awake okay so let's say that\nwe have no mental activity and no\nconsciousness what do we call that as\ndreaming a state of mind you're getting\nahead of yourself my friend sleep right\nor death sure unclear though right\nbecause we haven't been done you guys\nhaven't been dead so you actually don't\nknow what the state of death is like so\nwe're gonna delete that because we\nactually do not know will you talk about\nthe state of mind of death a different\nday\nokay so then let's think about dreaming\nso someone mentioned dreaming so dead on\nthe inside so what is dreaming are you\nconscious during a dream so we're gonna\nsay no consciousness ah I see now most\npeople are sakes of lucid dreaming okay\nwe'll get to that in a second\nare you so no consciousness is there\nmental activity during a dream let's not\nworry about lucid dreaming lucid\ndreaming is the exception not the rule\nright so your mind is active but you are\nnot conscious dreaming okay now let me\nask you guys something\nwhat is the consciousness state of a\ndaydream or like let's start with this\nwhen we use the phrase daydreaming\nare we talking is there mental activity\nyes or no there is mental activity in\ndaydreaming is there awareness in\ndaydreaming so the other way other thing\nthat we can call this is awareness right\nso this is kind of cool because we\nintuitively just think about this for a\nsecond we describe a particular state of\nmind that we experience why will\ntechnically awake and we call it\ndaydreaming because it's actually the\nsame box of mental activity and\nconsciousness is dreaming that's why we\ncall it daydreaming because intuitively\nwe recognize that this state of mind is\nlike a dream it's just happens during\nthe day versus happens at night like\nlike do you guys get that like it's\nreally bizarre that we use the phrase\ndaydreaming because but it's actually\nnot because we intuitively recognize\nthat your thought that you can be\nthinking without being aware so maybe\nokay so now comes the important thing so\nthinking and awareness are completely\ndifferent what goes in this box what do\nyou guys think meditate what do you guys\nthink for chat very good right so this\nis meditation it is to be in a state of\nmind or beyond very good for those of\nyou had young that's even more correct\nwhere you are aware but there's no\nmental activity excellent twitch chat\nisn't is playing oh I'm impressed too a\nchat thank you guys very much for not\ntrolling me okay next thing types of\nmeditation ok so the first thing is like\nsomeone give me a meditation technique\nwhat's the meditation technique ok very\ngood\nso third eye technique right so charge\nthe laser beam so if we think about that\nwhat are we doing we're concentrating on\na particular thing ok so this is a da da\nda so give me another technique\nokay so then people are saying\nmindfulness so let's talk about what is\nmindfulness let's think about this do\nyou guys know what mindfulness is right\nso mindfulness has a couple of\nattributes so it's focusing in the\npresent or being in the present present\nobservant oftentimes observing the flow\nof thoughts without engaging okay\nnon-judgmental awareness so the\ninteresting thing about mindfulness is\nlike like so let's talk about so let's\ncharging the laser beam is the third eye\ntechnique okay for those of you don't\nknow\nso concentrating on a spot between your\neyebrows so let's talk about alternate\nnostril breathing is you know\nconcentrating on the flow of breath\nbetween nostrils okay or in most rolls\nokay you guys with me yeah so and then\nso the first thing is that these\ntechniques are different right so in one\nyou are doing something so this is\ndarkness so these are doing doing\nmeditations and then these are not doing\nor just observing let's call it\nobserving meditations okay so now this\nis do you guys get how this is\nfundamentally different you all get that\nlike these are different right\nlike in this you're doing something\nyou're focusing your concentration this\nyou're just chilling you're sitting back\nokay now I have a question for you guys\nokay hold on so do you guys think that\nthese are different things you guys\nthink fundamental like are these are\nthese doing the same thing in your mind\nyes or no somewhat okay so now I'm gonna\nshow you guys really cool paper okay\nguys ready so this is a paper by a guy\nnamed David silver swag whose chief of\nPsychiatry at Brigham and Women's\nHospital self-awareness self regulation\nand self transcendence a framework for\nunderstanding the neurobiological\nmechanisms of mindfulness so this paper\nis fascinating and what people have done\nis they've done studies so like usually\nEEG studies so EEG is an\nelectroencephalogram so measures the\nelectrical activity of the brain and\nwhat they've done is they've taken\ndifferent types types of meditation and\nI think what they basically done like so\nhere are two types right so one is the\nthought or another doing meditation\nanother is the observing meditation so\nthis is so this is self-regulation as\nthe da da da self-awareness is the\nmindfulness kind and what they've done\nis looked at the EEG patterns of people\nwho are doing different meditation\ntechniques and what they've discovered\nis that actually like what's happening\nin your brain when you do these\ndifferent things is actually like\nfundamentally different creates\ndifferent patterns of electrical\nactivity in your brain so different\nkinds of meditation techniques are these\nare actually different and they do\ndifferent things in your brain okay so\nthe third kind of we can sort of further\nsubdivide things so if you guys want the\nreference we'll put it on our discord\nokay\nso this isn't I mean so this paper if\nyou guys really want to get to the EEG\npart so this is I like this paper\nbecause it's a framework so what these\nguys have done is they've like looked at\nall of the research and they proposed a\nhypothesis that explains why the studies\nare the way that they are Oh weird hold\non we try to scan or oh for there maybe\nI miss late otherwise you can just\nGoogle Scholar this you can Google\nScholar that okay it's the top it's the\ntop link if you do silver swag in\nmeditation\nokay we'll post this to our discord so\nthis is pretty cool because what this\ntells us is that like these techniques\nwhich feel very different right if you\ndo a mindfulness technique I'm gonna\ntell you to close your eyes and you're\njust gonna listen that's gonna be felt\nlike you're it's gonna be a different\nexperience from focusing your mind on\nsomething so then so that's one one\nchange so then now we're gonna talk\nabout meditation so I think the biggest\ndifference in terms of meditation\ntechniques is their observing techniques\nand they're doing meditations so and\nthen different how can I say this so\nokay so taught or not I'm gonna just\ndelete these okay doing meditations so\nthese tend to be sensory or grounding\nokay these are open so open awareness or\nmindfulness okay so now I have a fun\nquestion for you guys okay very good\npassive versus active okay so now I have\na question for you guys if someone is\nhaving a panic attack which technique do\nyou think is better\nah very good now we're getting\ndisagreement right so just think about\nthis so when someone has so you there's\na doing yes okay so this is what happens\nwhen you have a patient with PTSD okay\nor I'm so a good example of this I mean\nthe Mitch Jones is not a patient but\nlike what happens when Mitch meditates\nyou guys know y'all do y'all watch that\nyeah right so when someone is having a\npanic attack you want to use a grounding\ntechnique so a good at technical of this\nis ice diving so this is a really\npowerful grounding technique so I stive\na--take like you know like a you take a\nbowl of ice or like a bucket of ice and\nwater and you stick your face in it\nokay and so like if we think about\nwhat's happening when you stick your\nface in a bucket of ice like our ice\nwater or cold water it pulls your\nattention from your thoughts to the\nstimulus so alternate nostril breathing\nis another good example third eye is\nanother good example but do you guys see\nhow like this is gonna pull your\nattention more powerfully than alternate\nnostril breathing will which will pull\nyour attention more powerfully than\nfocusing on the third eye so grounding\ntechniques so if we think about the\ndoing meditations there are sensory or\ngrounding techniques which are gonna\npowerfully pull attention your attention\naway okay so the the sensation of hand\nso here's a really crazy thing okay you\nguys ready for this you know what else\nis on here\ncutting so if so I don't recommend that\nyou cut but if you talk to people who\nengage in self harming okay you talk to\nthem about\nthey cut so sometimes these people are\nsuicidal but if you actually ask them so\nI've taught meditation to you know\npeople who suffer from a lot of self\ninjurious behavior and I ask them\nquestions and I'm like what why do you\ncut and how does cutting make you make\nyou feel and what they inevitably\ndescribe is that when they cut like they\nfeel the sensation so acutely that it\nlike calms them down and something about\nthe pain focuses their mind on the\nsensation of pain and actually gives\nthem relief from whatever they're\nfeeling on the inside so I believe that\ncutting is actually like almost in a\nweird way like a negative like a harmful\nform of meditation but it focuses their\nattention on the present because if you\ntalk to these people their feelings of\nsuicidality are actually different from\ntheir desire to self-harm and as they\nstart to feel worse about themselves\nself-harm gives them an opportunity for\nrelief so since cutting is injurious\nright like we don't want people to cut\nbecause it's like medically a bad idea\nto do this you're gonna get scars you\ncan get infections this is not a good\nidea this is why we teach people who\nhave self injurious behavior to meditate\nand this is also why when you take the\npsychiatric conditions that have a high\ndegree of self injurious behavior so a\ngood example is borderline personality\ndisorder so these people tend to\nself-harm quite a bit the best\nevidence-based treatment for borderline\npersonality disorder has its roots in\nmeditation so the cool thing is that\nwhat you want to do for these people is\ngive them a replacement for the cunning\nso if you teach them\niced iving or alternate nostril\nbreathing or something else because\nthird eye stuff is a little bit too like\nhands-off for them to begin with they\nactually start to get better and they\nstop cutting because they don't need to\ndo the cutting anymore to like relieve\nthemselves of the mental pain okay yeah\nplease do not cut I'm not recommending\nthat you cut what I'm saying is that\ncutting if we analyze how it works it\nactually is like almost a form of\nmeditation okay now what happens when\nsomeone like so when we have so like a\npatient with PTSD or something like that\nor and\nattack we want to do doing meditations\nor grounding meditations or sensory\nmeditations so the way I want you guys\nto think about this is depending on how\nunharmonious\nyour mind is you want to do more of a\ngrounding or more powerful technique\nright so we're gonna do one right now so\nI'll give you guys an example of a\npowerful technique so we're gonna do\nbees breath or Sean mouki mood the red\nand brown muddy brown and I am okay so\nthis is the first step\nalright so pinkies on the corners of\nyour mouth you guys do this mmm ring\nfinger hit the groove right outside of\nyour nostril okay and then we're gonna\nput middle finger here on the inside of\nour eyes index finger here on the\noutside of our eyes and then thumbs are\ngonna go inside the ear canal so stick\nyour thumb in your ear and then you're\ngonna take a deep breath in and buzz\nlike a bee\n[Music]\nagain\n[Music]\nand one more time\n[Music]\nokay so that's hard because like if you\nguys are actually doing the practice\nyou're not gonna be able to hear me so\ndid you guys do it yes No\nso what happens in your mind when you do\nthat okay so we're gonna do this again\nlet's teach this to miss kif today and\nyou guys got a primer today we're gonna\ndo it again with Miss skipping a little\nbit okay we're gonna practice more we're\ngonna teach miss gift we'll talk to him\nabout how it feels the goal is that you\nknow generally if you stick your ears I\nmean your thumbs in your ears and you\nbuzz\nso do that five times for just a breath\neach one is one breath five breaths and\nso notice what happens to your mind\nyes oh this is hard because if you guys\nare doing it it's like the your the\nproblem with teaching you guys\nmeditation is because happy elbow foes\nactually meditate and the half who are\nnot actually meditating or the ones who\nare left in twitch at and so that just\nscrews us up because we get like like\nthe only answers I'm getting or for the\npeople who have no idea right it's just\nlike it's like setting ourselves up for\ndisaster okay so anyway so we're gonna\nteach miss gif and we'll ask him because\nlike you know [ __ ] you guys and so if\nyou guys did it you'll hopefully see I\nmean I say that with love hopefully you\nguys understand that a bit too far okay\nI apologize so really really I'm sorry\nif that hurt anyone's feelings it was it\nwas not intended to do that okay but\nhopefully you guys see that that's\ncompletely acceptable hold on crying\ncheck what does that mean I don't know\nwhat that means okay all right let's\nfinish let's finish talking about this\nokay III don't I don't know what that\nmeans I'm confused\ndid I make a mistake is it not a good\nidea to to be mean to twitch at okay but\nseriously if you guys did the technique\nlet's try to wrap this up because I\nthink we've got miss gif in a couple\nminutes so if you guys did the technique\nlike hopefully you'll see that it's like\nit's a powerful sensory stimulus right\nso it kind of like knocks the thoughts\nout of your mind\nso it's it's kind of like a force push\nif you're a Jedi you just like force\npart of your mind and like the thoughts\njust go they they pop off right the\ninteresting thing is that if you take\nsomeone with PTSD or a panic attack\nthese are the kinds of meditation\ntechniques you teach them because if you\njust teach them to calm their mind and\nopen it up if you teach an observing\nmeditation or an open awareness\nmeditation then what happens is like all\nof those negative emotions are going to\ncome up and they're gonna overwhelm them\nwhich in a sense is good because you're\nyou're kind of you know in a sense is\ngood because you know they're they're\nventilating that stuff but you don't\nwant to make it to be like a painful\nexperience for them right you want to\nlike walk them into it I think this is\nwhat we see with Mitch so mitch has so\nmuch stuff that's happening like right\nbeneath the surface that even if I tell\nhim to do like a sensory or grounding\ntechnique he's got so much emotion that\nonce you calm the mind you can kind of\nlike see what's down there\nyou kind of relieve the pressure of the\nmind and then all the stuff comes up and\nit can be overwhelming so meditation\nactually has some contraindications so\nmeditation is not like without risks so\nyou know you want to be careful like so\nyou want to do meditation like slowly\nand carefully if you experience any kind\nof negativity you know take a step back\nyou don't want to force yourself to do\nsomething that's extreme and and\ngenerally speaking you know just take it\ntake it easy take it slow there are case\nreports of meditation and do psychosis\nso let's show you guys that too\nokay so here's an interesting case\nreport that talks about meditation and\ndo psychosis so there are case reports\nof meditation actually you know leading\nto like psychotic episodes so you guys\ngot to be careful generally speaking\nit's gonna be fine but so psychosis is\nwhen you either like hallucinate or you\nlose a sense of self or you can feel\nlike like invaded by other people like\nthe the area between you and other\npeople starts to break down which is the\nbest way to describe it maybe I'll do a\ntalk about psychosis along with anxiety\nand depression ADHD and things like that\nso meditation to do psychosis is a thing\nso be careful alright so if you're doing\nany meditation technique and it feels\nlike dangerous or scary like just stop\ntake a break don't force yourself into\nit relax a little bit and then you can\ntry again later or do a different kind\nof technique so open awareness\nmeditation techniques are different and\nthen like there's another layer of\nthings okay so then they're also like\nthere's mantra so mantra so now we get\nto the so far everything that I've\ntalked about is relatively oh this is\nall relatively scientific right so there\nthere have been papers that have been\nstudied the stuff we've done\nIggy's things like that so then the\nother way to look at meditation\ntechniques is not actually scientific at\nall but as more spiritual and is\nactually how they're taught right so\nthere's like month remit so they're\nthey're are not on us focusing\ntechniques okay so actually let's start\nwith this they're Brown ions\nthis is non-scientific\nokay now we're going spiritual so these\nare breathing techniques that are\ndesigned to balance the flow of your\nlife energy and calm the mind so these\nare like purification techniques or\ncalming techniques the alternate nostril\nbreathing is a good example of a\npranayama the bees breath is a good\nexample of Bronn I am\nthen there are breath via Hadas\nwhich are sensory withdrawal techniques\nso these are things so generally\nspeaking our mind oh man I wish we had\nmore time okay we'll talk about this\nnext time\nso Pratt theorists are techniques that\nare designed to train you to withdraw\nyour attention from the senses and\ndirect your attention inward and if we\nthink about like procrastination and all\nkinds of other problems that like you\nknow people gamers have so if we think\nabout like you know staying up like\nuntil 4:00 in the morning and watching\nYouTube video after YouTube video after\nYouTube video even if it's our channel\nis like not a good idea right so if we\nthink about like why do you watch\nyoutube videos till 4:00 in the morning\nit's because there is a part of your\nmind that is sensory and is like going\ntowards a stimulus in the outside world\nand then it goes to the next stimulus in\nthe outside world next stimulus in the\noutside world next stimulus in the\noutside world I'm walking down the\nstreet I smell a hamburger oh I want to\neat a hamburger my mind like okay and\nthen I go and I end up eating a\nhamburger so like poor diet choices\nstaying up too late these are all\nconsequences of a weak mind that cannot\nrestrain so the attention of your mind\nfollows your senses instead of like you\ncontrolling the attention of your mind\nso these are a set of techniques that\nare designed for you to restrain your\nmind and direct it where it wants to go\nwhere you want it to go instead of where\nit wants to go these are kind of like\ntraining a dog to walk where you want or\nyou know use for potty training that's\nwhat these are like\nso after breath you hodda's come taut on\nus so these are like focusing techniques\nand then there are a couple of other\nversions of this okay so one is mantra\nso this is chanting a particular\nspiritual phrase to accumulate power\nokay so this is basically like magical\nspell essentially right and then we also\nhave like chakra sadhana that's really\nwhat it is like if you guys like study\nit academically it's like a magical\nspell like you\nchant something over and over again to\naccumulate a particular kind of energy\nand it's supposed to have anything\nremembered as is not scientific I'm just\nI'm relating to you guys what is written\nin the books about meditation in trying\nto organize this information I'm not\nsaying it's good I'm not saying it's bad\nI'm not saying it's right I'm not saying\nit's works I'm not saying it doesn't\nwork this is just explaining information\nokay so chakra sadhana is meditations\nthat purify the chakras and are aimed at\ncultivating a particular okay let's put\nit this way aimed at levelling up a\nparticular domain so a good example of\nthis is an odd chakra meditation so an\nAHA chakra is your heart chakra and your\nheart chakra you know when you do\nmeditations around the heart Chuck note\nit's my belief that like so you\ncultivate like compassion and empathy so\nit's different techniques that sort of\nwork on you and your mind - like\ncultivate a sense of like compassion and\nempathy okay so it's my belief this\nisn't supported too much by science\nactually not much at all but it's my\nbelief that is you do different kinds of\ntechniques it can enhance like different\nparts of your brain so and there's some\nyou know there's some very preliminary\nevidence like the EEG this is kind of a\nbig jump but we know that different\nkinds of meditation techniques do\ndifferent things to your brain it's my\nhypothesis that what they sort of\nfigured out like what the Yogi's figured\nout is they did a bunch of meditation\nand they sort of realize like okay if I\nmeditate in this way Mike my compassion\nor empathy increases if I meditate in\nthis way my intuition increases and so I\ndon't know if that's really like this\nhasn't really been validated through\nscience but that's just it's just\nanother option yeah so I think this is\nlike a good example of different kinds\nof meditations okay and then yeah so\nthat's our bit on meditation okay\nyeah so it's\nso Tantra is a part of mantra oh sorry\nmantra is a part of Tantra so this\nincludes Tantra right so okay alright\nlet's talk to miss gif so we're gonna\ntake a quick break while we get\nconnected with miss Kip how okay so\nactually first let me ask you guys to a\nchat what we like you guys like that\ndon't like that more of that less of\nthat like talk to me\nokay so what about the balance of like\nscience versus non science\nyou\nokay so so what I'm hearing so got\nbecause I've heard like different things\nfrom different people right so some\npeople say I want more science I want\nmore spirituality like I was surprised I\nwas never planning on talking about\nspirituality on stream like that's\npersonal for me but you guys seem to be\ninterested in and what I think is like\nwe can look at it both ways right so we\nshould just understand the limits of\nwhat information we present so like I\nthink it's fine\nto read text books on yoga I personally\nfind it like interesting and engaging\nand I learn a lot from it but we should\nunderstand that that's not like\nnecessarily scientific so when it comes\nto these different kinds of meditation\ntechniques if you guys are interested so\nI have some degree of faith in that you\ncan also like using those texts I\ndeveloped a meditation program that\ntargets neuroscience deficits in people\nwith addictions there's actually like I\nlooked at there's a lot of data about\nyou know what kind of meditation\nso here's an example of a paper okay so\nthis is what I did I sat down looked at\na bunch of information about\nneuroscience deficits in addiction so\ntried to figure out okay like what\ncircuits in the brain when someone is\naddicted what circuits in the brain\naren't working properly then what I did\nis I went to a bunch of these like old\ntexts on yoga and meditation and stuff\nlike that and I tried to map out like\nwhat kinds of techniques according to\ntheir theory will improve the\nneuroscience like will improve like a\nparticular capacity and like what part\nof the brain does a target basically for\neach meditation technique and then I\nlooked at the parts of brain the brain\nthat it targets and then I put all those\ntechniques together and then I made a\nmeditation program and then I went to a\nbunch of people with addictions when I\nwas working at a rehab and I taught them\nthis meditation regimen it worked\nwonderfully\nright so they normally learn meditation\nand mindfulness it's big they go to\ndifferent places and they learn\nmindfulness there are some issues here\nbecause like is it just learning\nmindfulness like mindful is in general\nwill help the question is if you create\na targeted protocol of meditation can\nyou correct neuroscience deficits in in\ndrug addiction my belief is yes and I\nthink it's possible and I think it sort\nof speaks to yeah I think it's possible\nanyway\nso and then we have like some data this\nso I want you guys to understand very\nclearly like what I'm saying so I'm very\nconfident in the science of the\nbackground of what I'm saying so there\nare basic science studies but the more\nand more the closer we get to\napplication for an individual human\nbeing the less I can speak\nscientifically because then it's\nclinical evidence right so it's my it's\nmy experience as a clinician but there\nhaven't been studies done on some of the\nstuff that I'm talking about and then\nsome of the stuff is like completely\nspiritual where it's like that's just\nwhat the texts say I'm not you know it's\nnot scientifically it hasn't been\nstudied yet but there is actually a guy\nwho was doing like an aha chakra\nmeditation studies and in trying to see\nif like you can improve people's\ncompassion and you can so some of this\nstuff actually has been studied anyway\nlet's take a break\nso what I'm hearing from you guys is you\nguys like this\nyou want more the balance of science and\nnot science is okay in terms of like\ndetail like do you guys like I tend to\nexplain a lot about like basic concepts\nbut I think you know you guys seem to\nlike that"
