    "transcript": "cool man how are you I'm doing well how\nare you um I am\nwell actually I mean well I I just had a\nI just finished a really bad stream but\nI think in general\nI'm actually really stressed for the\nlast like four and a half weeks I've had\non average about a hundred to one\nhundred and ten hour work weeks so it's\nit's been it's been pretty sick I think\non average I was on air like 12 to 14\nhours a day and at some points upwards\nto 18 like either casting or streaming\nso it really took its toll on my mental\nhealth\n[Music]\nokay let's go weird a question so I\nthink the ad is still running for some\npeople oh god okay it's running for 30\nmore seconds that's so long maybe we\nshould stop doing that but yeah why um\nso lck is the Korean League of Legends\nregional tournament the you know the\nKorean region there's four casters two\ncolor commentators and to play by plays\nand the other color commentator still\ndoesn't have his visa okay and so not to\nlower the the quality of the broadcast\nand whatnot I'm the only color\ncommentator so I was having to do five\nday work weeks okay so five day work\nweeks I have to be in there by 3:00 p.m.\nand then I wasn't getting out on average\nuntil about midnight and then I would go\nhome or I wouldn't go home I actually\ngot a hotel near the studio is like one\nminute walking distance and I'd go back\nto the hotel and then I would either\nlive view le c which is the european\nregional tournament or i would power a\nnap and then stream the North American\nregional why\num so coach streaming for North America\nis a new thing it just started this\nseason the first time like ever in the\nhistory that streamers are allowed to Co\nstream it\nit's the most successful thing that my\nstreams ever have so I think it's pretty\nsilly if I don't do it it's two days a\nweek the EU one I actually stopped doing\nthis past week as a means to try to\nbetter manage my mental health I guess\nso I don't do it this this last week\nwhat what effect does does 110 hour work\nweeks have on you um so I think the\nfirst week was actually pretty pretty\nokay I I managed the first week pretty\nfine the second week was a lot more\nstressful because the Korean the Korean\nLeague right now is it's uh I don't know\nhow to like talk about it without\nsounding really negative it's just not\nit's not doing very well\nnot not in terms of like viewership or\nanything like that the overall level of\nplay is not what people would expect and\nthen the games are what I think a lot of\npeople would call very boring\nthey're like average 35 plus minutes to\n40 minutes very dull meta state meta\nbeing like what champions keep popping\nup and whatnot\nlots of series are going all the way to\nthree games and so that extends the\nbroadcast makes it go a lot longer so I\nthink by week two that's when I started\nreally stressing out and I started\nhaving bouts of insomnia again which\nI've had on and off like the last couple\nof years and I was starting to get a lot\nof anxiety on the broadcast and I was\nfeeling sick without actually being sick\nlike body aches and fatigue and all this\nother stuff I ended up going to a clinic\nfor it I got like a cold like a banana\nbag or something like the the lack of my\ngrandson\nyeah yeah ended up getting like a banana\nbag I did like a spa thing to try to\nhelp de-stress and everything then the\ncoronavirus started popping up it's very\nprevalent right now in South Korea\nso that started adding stressors and I\ndon't know\n110 hour work weeks we're not healthy\nthis past week I I cut back the European\nlive viewing and I also missed one of\nthe North American ones because I woke\nup to do it and then I just thought to\nmyself like there's no way I can turn\nthe stream on I'm not in a good mental\nstate there's no way I'll be okay and I\njust went back to sleep and I just\nrested and and I did the next two casts\nand now here we are this is the night\nafter this is actually my first off day\nokay and you're spending yeah awake in\nthe middle of the night so let's let's\ntry to make this worth your here you\nknow let's try to make it work in a\nwhile and make sure we're not\ncontributing to the problem so Ellis\nwhat's your recollection of our last\nconversation like what do you what did\nyou remember about it or takeaways I\nended up thinking a lot more about my\nchildhood and adolescence in general and\nI remember thinking that the session or\njust the the talk that we had in general\nwas it was very relieving I guess while\nit was happening and also afterwards I\nthought about a lot of stuff for several\ndays following and then literally\nshortly thereafter that's when the work\nweeks started sure so I just I sort of\ndome it into everything else there I all\nI remember is just going down memory\nlane of my life talking about various\nstuff I remember talking about like the\nmeditation stuff I remember talking\nabout just my thought processes\nhow I arrived at certain conclusions\nstuff like that no I I I dwelled on that\nmore and more but I feel like ever since\nthat session so where we're at now I've\nbeen constantly on without basically any\ndown time so I think there's a lot going\non in my life right now as well as in my\nmental state that I am trying or that I\nwill process and filter once the noise\nstops yeah yeah so I have a lot of\nquestions for you but I also have some\ngeneral thoughts what would you like to\nstart with if you think the questions\nwould help you with your general\nthoughts then that would probably be\nbetter okay let me just think about that\nso sometimes LS I have a problem where I\ntalk to someone for five minutes and I\nfeel like I have a clear sense of what's\ngoing on and then I feel like I should\nask more questions because I really do\nwant to know more stuff but I'm inclined\nto actually just talk to you a little\nbit about my impressions of what I'm\nhearing yeah and okay so Alice here's\nwhat I think one of your one of your\nchallenges is I think you are in crap\nyou have an incredibly strong willpower\nand I think your capacity to take parts\nof yourself that are busted or cracking\nunder pressure your your capacity to\nkeep going in spite of signals from your\nmind and your body that you need to slow\ndown is actually really really high and\nI think what that does is puts you in\nsituations where like you just start you\nknow stuff just starts with kind of\nfalling apart\nyeah and and I think you know we saw\nthis a little bit so my recollection of\nour last talk was we certainly went down\nmemory lane but we also talked a lot\nabout sort of how one can look at\ndepression and that you struggled with\ndepression for a long time and I had the\nsense that your depression was a couple\nof things one is that it's anger turned\nagainst the self\nis so psychologically like when you're\nwhen you're learning to be a therapist\nthat's one of the theories that you kind\nof think about which is that depression\nis a manifestation of anger that's\ndirected towards you and I think part of\nthe part of the way that you view\nyourself is actually like really really\nbeneficial so when you're hard on\nyourself and you push yourself you're\nseeing the highest numbers that you see\non stream you're casting in the Korean\nLeague you know you're doing so much\nbecause you really like you push\nyourself really hard and I'm curious a\nlot about you know a lot of things that\nyou've said about you know you managed\nweek one well you're stressing out you\nkind of talked about stressing and\ndistressing and spa day and insomnia I'm\nreally curious about how much\nfrustration loathing or anger do you\nhave towards yourself in all of this\nstuff because you are working 110 hour\nwork weeks and I'm curious if there's a\nvoice inside you that says you should be\nable to handle this better there's there\nwas definitely many points I remember\ntalking to my producer she's really good\nshe's like she's really good at being\nsomeone that I can talk to she's like my\nboss and then there's someone that's\nabove her but she she runs the global\nproduction for the cast and I remember\ntalking with her about feeling very lost\nand what I was doing and feeling very\nparanoid and sort of confused at myself\nlike the in-between broadcasts or prior\nto a broadcast starting I think I talked\nwith her on two or three different\noccasions about this stuff there were\ndefinitely some points where I'd leave a\ncast and I was actually really angry\nbecause I thought like my mental\nfortitude wasn't strong enough to have a\ngood cast or I thought what the [ __ ] am\ni doing like what how what am I actually\njust going through and it became a\nbattle of yes just pushing myself\nthrough and if you remember the last\ntalk I think that a lot of it is like\nfear the motivator of not just fear in\nthe traditional sense of how people\nthink but fear of missing out\nyes Oh suddenly I would start viewing\nwell if I miss this stream I miss out on\npotentially all of this or then I would\nstart having anxiety about what if I end\nup losing out on certain viewers or\npeople that get ticked off because\nthere's a lot of other people\ncoach trimming too and so it gets into\nthis really weird mental state where\nit's like I become afraid to miss days\ndue to expectation and then I get lots\nof messages on Twitter or DMS or discord\nmessages where am I or am i doing the\ncoach stream etc and then I get very\nanxious about letting that stuff down\nbut sometimes I I just like I just want\neverything to stop I just want all the\nnoise to stop and this has happened a\nlot in the last few weeks but it feels\nlike obvious like I I can't and I feel\nlike I feel like I'm at the gym sort of\nI like the equivalency when when your\nbody wants to give up on an exercise\nthat you're doing but you know that it\nat the very end it's probably better if\nyou go through with it without obviously\nhurting yourself and so I keep [ __ ] I I\nfeel like I keep trying to trick myself\ninto thinking that everything's okay but\nall that I'm seeing is at the end of the\nroad like what what happens when we\ncomplete spring and summer and how is my\nstream gonna actually gotta push through\nright yeah that's literally that's\nliterally it's got it I think like so\nI'm halfway done with the lck where\nwe're uh we're halfway done now starting\nnext week and then there's offseason so\nthere's a two-month break and I was\nplanning about or I was actually\nplanning to go back to the States for\nlike a month or two and just stop\neverything because I've just been on too\nmuch the last few months and now the\ncoronavirus thing I have no idea what's\ngonna happen with travel regulations and\nall this other stuff so it's another\nheadache and I'm like ah [ __ ] that's\ngonna happen with Kuroda\neveryone's asking yeah and then uh it\nsucks so that's what I got thinking\nabout but I view these really big breaks\nthat are coming so April May or end of\nApril May is a big break and then\nthere's another break before worlds\ntypically there's like one one and a\nhalf one free and then obviously post\nworld's there's a big offseason so I\nfeel like these are just milestones that\nI have to hit sort of like reps or\nsomething mm-hmm yeah so I completely\nunderstand that that's how you feel\nabout things and I think you made a\nreally interesting caveat when it comes\nto the gym you said it's really\nimportant to push through provided you\ndon't hurt yourself\nyes and I think your problem is that is\nwhat I guess well not knowing whether or\nnot it's gonna hurt myself right or I\ndon't know I don't know man stressing\nout insomnia anxiety going body aches\ngoing to the clinic and getting a banana\nbag you know what a banana bag is\nbasically um it's a lot of like well I\nmean you said electrolytes and stuffs a\nlot of minerals and stuff that the body\nneeds nutrients yes you know do you know\nwhy most people don't get banana bags\nmost people are lacking all those things\nor they're yeah do you know why most\npeople aren't lacking those things\nthey're living a normal healthy work we\nall know so let's pause for a second\nlet's just understand this very clearly\nokay okay a lot of people live unhealthy\nlives\nokay right like a lot of people don't\neat healthy that's like yeah and like\nand they don't need banana bags people\nwho need banana bags are people who are\nseverely dehydrated and like people who\nlike a good example of people who get\nbanana bags or people who have severe\nalcoholism and don't do anything except\nfor drink alcohol they get all their\ncalories from alcohol they don't they\nlike literally like people who get\nbanana bags or people who do not eat\nfood and do not drink water or other\nkinds of things okay so like how's your\nfood bin I'm actually eating really well\nbut I actually gained weight\nso amidst all of this through the stress\nI've actually gained weight because I've\nbeen stressed eating\nyep so what about freaking fluids I\nactually drink quite a lot at riot\nthere's a lot of well the drinks suck\nbut there's a lot of stuff for the\ntalent next okay so okay I probably yeah\nhow often do you go through a lot of\nwater bottles tea etc how often do you\nurinate I would say several times a day\nwhat color is your hair it's yeah it's\npretty it's either\nalmost see-through or very light yellow\nokay so I know and I notice hydrate yeah\nokay there's problems yeah so I mean I'm\nlike what are you so I just wanted to\nmake sure that you know medically or\neven though I don't dispense medical\nadvice over the over the internet just\nwant to make sure that you're really not\nin a situation where there's something\nthat could be going on yeah so it sounds\nlike you're actually eating and drinking\nokay yeah I want to kind of so let me\njust stop for a second so I think LS\nthere a couple things we can talk about\ntoday one is that we can dig into what\nstressing out means what anxiety is what\ninsomnia is I think we can also talk a\nlittle bit about psychosomatic and what\nthat term means I think though that so\nwe can talk about each of those things\nand that's sort of like standard stuff\nright like stress anxiety all insomnia\nthe other thing though is that I think\nat the root of this is that you have\nthis fear or you have something that\ndrives you\nand the thing is that driver is like a\ntaskmaster with a whip and like you\ndon't need a banana bag unless like\nyou're like you whipped yourself into\nexhaustion yeah and and so I think going\nforward you know if you want like this\nis not a sustainable solution like\nworking 110 hour weeks for months at a\ntime and then taking a month or two off\nand then working another like 110 hour\nweek for you know a couple months at a\ntime and then taking another month off\nand then you also have to remember that\nlike during your month off like you're\nnot gonna be you're not another person\nyou're actually still LS so like during\nthat month off you're still gonna have\nlots of thoughts about like missed\nopportunities and should you be doing\nthis yes and so like it's not even gonna\nbe a month off like do you see that like\nthe month off is just an illusion\nbecause you're still gonna be you during\nthose times yeah I'm always connected\nI'm always lined in and it when I'm not\nlined in I feel anxious yep so it's like\nare you either you take a step back and\nthen you have to deal with your\ncrippling anxieties you like force\nyourself to relax right because it's\nlike that's just a weird paradox you\nknow yeah it's like anxiety provoking\nrelaxation is like an oxymoron and but\nbecause that's who you are so I think\nwhat we've really got to change is you\nman like this is not a good plan and we\nhave to we have to really dig into or I\nfeel you know this we have to dig into\nwhat it is that drives you like who's\nthe taskmaster and why do you have to do\nall these things why do you have to why\ndo you have to push yourself clearly\npast your breaking points and and the\nchallenge here is that you're so\nresilient that you like how can I say\nthis yeah I mean you're just so\nresilient that you like have gotten used\nto pushing yourself past the like a good\nlimit like you're at the gym but you\njust you injure yourself every time you\nwork out because you've just gotten used\nto injuries and like that's gotta stop\ndudes like you know yeah I don't know\nI guess I don't know what to say in that\nregard\nmostly I think a lot of that I think I\nthink we touched on it briefly last time\nwe talked where I feel like I'm\ncognizant that where I am right now in\nthe eSports community or the scene is a\nvery ridiculously fortunate position the\nposition that I'm in but I see how\nquickly things change in this industry\nand how quickly just everything gets\ncompletely thrown around and whatnot and\nI feel like due to the way that I got\nhere as well as how I stay within the\ncommunity right now it feels like III\ncan't afford to turn off and it creates\nthis really weird loop where at the same\ntime I think I mentioned this to you\nlast time that after eSports or\nsomething I don't know what I do yet and\nso that's a that's another scary\nquestion I just entered into a mid-20s\nbut that's kind of old and eSports if\nyou don't have anything else going for\nyou or going on and I feel like there's\na lot of expectations on me I feel like\nthere's a lot of people that want to see\nme fail and so that you know in a way\nthat's it is the thing so what's up what\nthat is well a lot well so I don't know\nhow much you know about my persona or\nwhatever from League pretty\ncontroversial yeah I think that most\npeople either love or hate me I think\nthere's no gray area I think that the\nway that I eye\nthe way that I talk in league setting\nmaybe you don't get it here or something\nbecause we're not in a league setting or\nsomething\nit's very agitated of people pisses\npeople off I don't know\nso anyways really what do you say that\npisses people off I don't know how to\nokay so okay I can know I know I don't\nknow how to describe this myself\nI agree so anger is a really interesting\nword you asked me last time if I get\nangry I don't yeah so I use anger as a\nway to describe it but I don't think\nthat's the emotion that I'm actually\nfeeling what is the feeling okay if I\nthink about this can I think it's sort\nof education it's like a vacation yes\ncan I guess yeah god is it [ __ ]\nridiculous what is is that lays it like\na sense of [ __ ] ridiculous\nyes well yeah sure yeah just that's not\ngood this is [ __ ] ridiculous\num is that what it feels like I yeah\nyeah so it\nI feel constantly on defense pretty much\nno matter what and I think that because\nof how much time I commit into the game\nwhether by working or spending time on\nit or spending time on others that are\nlike around me like pro players or\npeople that are like living with me that\nare trying to get careers or do certain\nthings in the game I feel like the\namount of commitment and time I spend\ninto it anything about the game almost\nends up becoming personal because of how\ndeep I am I don't know if that makes\nsense\nyeah I'm trying to make sense of it and\nso I take things really personal and I\nwas having a conversation with someone\nthe other day actually in I think\nactually I was gonna ask you like if you\nsaw someone go on television and you saw\nsomeone state something that was clearly\nuntrue and you have a way of showing\nthat it's untrue but but it's very\ndifficult yes like the earth is flat\nyeah like you've got messy oh that I use\nlately yes yes yes so like it's much\nridiculous right so if you can show\nsomeone the earth isn't flat but you\ncan't do it verbally there there's no\nway to get people to concede verbally\nright if you're confronted with a flat\nearther and you try to explain to them\nthe way that certain things work they\neither will or won't accept it but if\nthey come from the standpoint that\nyou're already wrong it feels like\nthere's nothing you can say verbally\nthat can ever convince them sure and in\norder to convince them you need to\nphysically show it in some way but if\nyou can never get the physical part it's\nlike a [ __ ] barrier that I just I\ncan't I yeah Jesus Christ I just wanna\n[ __ ] bash my head against the wall\nand then due to the nature of analysis\nin video games or strategy games or RTS\nis shrouded against realtime strategy\nverbal talks become extremely\nfrustrating and angering especially if\nthings are taken out of context or all\nthis other stuff so it becomes it\nbecomes very stressful and when I deal\nwith certain arguments or confrontations\nand stuff I don't think that I handle\nthem the best that I could especially in\nthe moment especially if what I'm\nhearing I think is nonsense and then as\na byproduct of that it feels like by\nstandards will only see me get angry\nright where they'll see me get impatient\nand frustrated and then I feel like it\nhas a negative recourse on me why so it\nis lesson to this um I'm sorry you were\nsaying it led you to a point the less\nsounded like you were\nyeah actually offering an important\nconclusion yeah so the the the so it's\nled me to a point where I basically only\nwant to interact with certain people\nwithin the community but I don't think\nthat's healthy because I want to\nprogress thinking within the game in the\ncommunity\nI want to progress the way that people\nsee strategy things and everything\nbecause I've been playing games all my\nlife started at you know H 2 & 3 and\nthen competitively I've been involved in\neSports since age 12 so if you know I'm\ngoing on two decades okay and it's my\nwhole life okay so that I oh yeah okay\nokay hold on okay\nI'm gonna need a minute okay you're just\nsharing so much that I think is actually\nreally like everything you say is laden\nwith importance and has been reflected\nupon and I think everything the problem\nthat I'm having is that like I can't I\ndon't know you're giving me a thousand\nroads to walk down I think all of what\nyou're good yeah I know yeah it sucks I\nfeel I'm actually nervous even saying\nwhat I'm saying right now why people say\nwell I don't know last video we did\nobviously I I would call it success like\nyou know got a lot of viewership on\nYouTube etc I think that there's a lot\nof people again in the league community\nthat will take what I'm saying right now\nis egotistical or overly arrogant or\nthinking that I'm always right or\nsomething like that and it has nothing\nto do with that and it just totally [ __ ]\nplease and I don't know I don't know\nwhat to describe it as it's a very\nawkward thing when I have to\nI I choose to live in a glass house\nbecause I feel like it's my only defense\nwhat I mean by that is like III I'm\nalways basically on air or I'm always\nopen to the public I've opened ESI\ndefends you against lies or lies\nfabrications from whom oh Jesus\nanyone really I guess it's just uh it's\nsomething I develop or I started doing\nyears ago eSports is a pretty weird\nindustry I think that lies fabrications\nhalf-truths etc can spread very a lot\nand then word of mouth is way too strong\nand things can be taken on a context way\ntoo easily especially clips for instance\nI mean you might know about that from\ntwitch like you see a clip on a context\ndoesn't really tell you the whole story\nand people can misconstrue certain\nthings and I feel like that's very\nfrustrating and then I get frustrated\nbecause I'm open to talking to literally\nanyone at any time\nand\nI don't know we've gone a lot of places\nright now you go ahead yes I'm sorry no\nI'm glad you're sharing so much so let's\njust start with where we ended off OLS\nokay let's just think for a second okay\nyep can I get water really quick yeah go\nfor it okay okay all right thanks I'll\nbe one side of all of the things you can\ndo get water is at the top of the list\nso I know that twitch app thinks that\nMitch Jones is the rain boss I feel like\nLS is the right boss man okay yeah okay\nhey so being misunderstood being\nmisunderstood really bothers you\nyeah yeah and and so if we think a\nlittle hold on a second hello\nwhat\nokay I was just informed that there's an\nad running right now because you went to\ngo get Walker look Jackson okay which is\ngreat because I need some time to think\nokay oh man it's so much okay let me\njust take notes okay okay I can do this\nokay I can do this\nokay so first of all you remember the\nlast time like so one of the big things\nthat I remembered about last time was\nthat I felt like you needed more you\nneeded to experience more anger like we\ntalked last time about how you\nessentially blamed yourself for all\nkinds of bad things that happen around\nyou instead of being angry with other\npeople yeah okay so my general sense I'm\ngonna use this phrase bursting at the\nseams okay yeah and what I what I what\nI'm getting from you LS is that you're\nbasically bursting at the seams I think\nyou have a lot of stuff that's going on\ninside of you that doesn't have a way to\nget out and so you're like bursting at\nthe seams and there's like leakage so my\nsense is that you have a lot of\nsuppression and this is why it like it\nfeels so\noverwhelming and multifactorial because\nit's like it's like firing on like it's\nso many different directions there's\ninsomnia there's physical problems\nthere's anger there's uncertainty about\nyour future there's a community that's\nhating you there's some kind of weird\ndefenses that you set up for yourself a\ncommunity that loves you there's\nexpectation there's you know like like\nstrike while the iron is hot and right\nnow it's the gold rush and you're going\nto California because that's where the\ngold is and like eSports and like soon\nit's all gonna be over there's just so\nmuch yeah like just listening to you is\noverwhelming like I can't even imagine\nwhat living and in your life is like\nlike it's like you can't catch a break\nanywhere and I think that that's that's\nsomething we've got to just figure out\nbecause that's just not I mean you're\nyou're screwed my friend if you continue\ndoing what you're doing and and going at\nthis pace oddly enough you may be very\nsuccessful but I think you're gonna pay\nfor that success and I do believe that\nyou can continue to be successful\nwithout bursting at the seams so let's\nstart with this you don't like being\nmisunderstood you're talking to flat\nearthers and they don't they don't\nunderstand you can't show them and you\njust want them you want them to\nunderstand you want them to understand\nyour viewpoint you want them to\nunderstand like what you're saying you\nwant like you want you want to be like\non the same team with them you don't\nwant to be oppositional with them\nthere's some amount of frustration\nthere's some amount of inability to show\nthem and then the other thing that I\nthink go for it now or I want them to\nshow me why the whatever it is that I'm\ntrying to say against their Flat Earth\nis actually wrong fine right that isn't\njust a versa I can get runs deeper so\nthat the other thing I said that this\nrolls into your identity so I want you\nto understand this very clearly okay so\nI'm getting the sense that you can't\nseparate an argument from you like it\nbecomes about you yes right it's not\nabout like convincing like it's not it's\nnot sterile it's not it's not like\nscientific it's not mathematical it's\nlike investment and who you are as a\nperson like there's your rolled up into\nthis does that make sense you're\ninvested yes yeah I think that that goes\nto what I was saying about how deep I am\nin eSports and yep\nI also won't and I well I won't say I\nwill but I think often times I won't\neven engage in a conversation if I don't\nactually feel comfortable talking about\nit I don't know if there's like a word\nfor that or phrase did you get what I\nmean like you're avoidant unless you're\ncomfortable unless I feel comfortable\nand competent in the material yeah so I\nthink this comes back to like you're\nyou're terrified of being misjudged yes\nwhere does that work from I mean I I\nwould imagine it obviously stems from\nsomething in childhood yeah we've talked\nabout four at the same time I don't know\nif it really does okay\nand the reason that I say I don't know\nif it really does is because I think the\nway that I thought of myself as a\npreteen and a dazzle as an adolescence\nwas the opposite of what like teachers\nand therapists and psychiatrists\npsychologists success have thought of me\nthey thought better of me that I thought\nof myself and so I guess that's a\nmisjudged thing but I don't\nI don't know okay so so I'm gonna just\ntoss a Hail Mary okay so first of all\nthings aren't as simple as I make them\nout to be okay so I think complicated\nthe first thing is as I'm hearing you\ntalk the thing that that I is actually\nthat you had some behavioral problems\nright am i mixing you up with someone\nelse behavioral problems in what sense\nlike did you get in trouble at school I\nwas true and forced to drop out of high\nschool yeah\nand so my education effectively it\nstopped in like seventh grade\neffectively yeah eighth grade so last\ntime we met we talked about\nokay so what are you as he mentioned\nthat what are you feeling what as you\nmentioned the truancy and what happened\nto you and um I don't really mind it I\nremember thinking that I wasn't gonna\nuse school or edu for anything and I\nremember thinking in like ninth grade\ntenth grade etc I would just wait for my\nclass to finish so that I could get the\nthat I could take the GED test because I\nthought the material on the GED was\nreally simple but there's the law that\nyou have to wait for your graduating\nclass or you can take the test but you\nhave to wait for them to receive the\ndiploma something like that I don't know\nI didn't want to go to school because I\ndidn't feel safe or comfortable at\nschool not because like anything like in\nparticular just a lot of things I guess\nI was true in all the time I don't feel\nanything in particular\nI guess so I'm trying to figure out\nmaybe this isn't related but you know\nthere was a powerful story that you told\nlast time about you know when you were\nlike going through the truancy hearing\nor something like that there one of the\nteachers kind of like stopped and was\nlike no one is asking everyone's talking\nabout punishing him yeah but no one is\nasking like why is he doing the things\nthat he does yeah is there anything\nabout that sentiment about being\nmisjudged judged by people held\naccountable for things that are that\naren't your fault\nthat translates to today I\nI would yeah I guess I would I would say\nso\nbecause I felt like I felt like speaking\nthe foreign language no one understood\nme and it felt like people around me\nthat didn't understand me didn't make\nany efforts to try to understand and\nthat was a very frustrating thing sort\nof like what we're talking about right\nnow where it's like this is [ __ ]\nridiculous like why don't these why\ndon't these things these this context\nwhy doesn't any of this matter to you\nbecause it should all matter and yet for\nsome [ __ ] on hilarious and it doesn't\num and it just it doesn't make sense to\nme who my whole thing is I try to run\nthrough so many scenarios and things in\nmy head and I don't understand why other\npeople don't do the same or they don't\neven attempt to understand yeah so I\nmean I think the [ __ ] ridiculous is\nkind of a good sentiment and and there's\nalso something let's a kind of like flat\nearther ish about this to me you know\nwhere it's sort of like people just\nreally do not try to understand it it's\njust and so I'm not sure if I'm if it's\ntoo loose of an association but\nsomething at one well I I guess I would\nask you what like so to add some context\nsome of the stuff that I come out with\nin the league scene right that has led\nto a lot of controversy is imagined\nbecause I don't know what games you play\nimagine that everything is the way that\nit is and then you come along and say no\nthis stuff's wrong I can show that it's\nwrong but then a lot of people will\noutwardly just dismiss it so maybe an\nanalogy I can make here is like in\nscience if it is they just talk about\nLeague\nokay so in in in league there's a lot of\nconcepts that I guess RT so\ninterestingly enough I I've had lots of\nconversations with RTS players and they\nthey accept it a lot better than mobile\nplayers do and it's the most [ __ ]\nbrain blasting thing in the world it\nblows my mind\nso in league of legends there will be\ninstances in pro play where there is no\nobjective on the map right there's do\nyou play league sure or no okay I\nunderstand now I'll play dota ok\nyou play dota okay so is there neutral\nobjectives in DotA yeah like big things\nokay so imagine there's very neutral\nobjective yeah sure like Baron great\nyeah so imagine there's no neutral up\nright and that means that there's\nnothing to really contest or standing\ngold on turrets can be about 500 right\n500 is about two and a half million\nwaves\nworth of gold without factoring in\nexperience okay so if you're winning\nright if the enemy shoves a wave too\nquickly for exams for example this can\nallow you to take that wave and pull it\nreally far up your lane and then freeze\nand then those minions can kill your\nincoming minion wave over and over\nseveral times it can actually net you a\nhigher gold value than a turret would\nlike it like a standing gold turret and\nnot even factoring an XP it also reduces\nthe amount of options both you have and\nyour opponent's have on the map because\neverything the variables are reduced it\nbecomes very clear-cut like using\ndeductive reasoning what can and can't\nhappen okay um so this is this is one of\nthe more like recent things that's\nhappened um what do you mean by freeze\nwhat does freeze me freezes they so for\ninstance if they had six minions and you\nand you had six minions and they sort of\nclash they killed your six minions you\ntake their six minions and you run it up\nyour lane without killing them yep now\nwhen the next waves come they'll have 12\nminions and you'll still have six so\nyour six minion\nwe'll die and if you can hold that by\nfreezing like keeping them at a certain\npoint and just constantly holding it\nthere they are forced to come and\neventually break it or they're forced to\ndo something else on the map okay but if\nyou're winning and your champions are\nstronger and you have more items\nobviously they cannot arbitrarily just\nteleport anywhere on the [ __ ] map or\nthey can't just randomly die of a turret\nbecause turrets are still really strong\nthe champions are still weak you can end\nup getting more gold in creating a\nlarger net difference between you and\nthe enemy team as well as experience by\njust freezing and then obviously you\nknow okay well you can only go into a\nfew places so I've had this conversation\nwith lots of RTS plays players it's\npretty easily accepted but with mobile\nplayers for some [ __ ] reason it's\nlike flattering and it just doesn't make\nany sense\nthe really weird thing is in the\ncommunity some people even even people\nwith high stature within the community\nwill say that you can't freeze or it's\nnot possible but wha\nI have so many examples of freezing at\nprofessional play from pro players and\nthere's also a lot of pro players that\nare on this in alignment that freezing\ncan exist but there are also pro players\nthat are like no you can't freeze\nbecause we can just do a b c and d and\nit's a very frustrating thing because it\nit feels very akin to flat earth where i\nsort of like the misjudge thing will\nnever assert that a team can freeze\nunless i really think that it's possible\nlike I'm not just gonna arbitrarily say\nodds they should just blanketly freeze\nso variables and conditions have to be\nmet for it to occur as like a\nstrategical maneuver and there's clear\nupside that is related to like economy\nan economy management is the thing that\nis very common in our TSS but not and\nwhen some not common in MOBA and in in\nMOBAs players tend to only think about\ntheir one champion but in RTS is you\nthink about lots of important champions\nin lots of different important locations\nand you're forced to make a you know\na major decision on how you're gonna\nallocate and do certain things and so\nbecause my first games we're Starcraft 1\nStarcraft 2 and whatnot and also playing\ncard games a call an economy and\nresource management and like how long it\ntakes units to move across the map\ntiming attacks how much damage they do\nhow little can you actually have and\nstill defend these are all RTS things\nlike like playing risk or monopoly or\nlots of board games and I just I want to\nblow my [ __ ] brains out when someone\nwith pretty high stature maybe in the\ncommunity will come along and assert\nthat it's not possible and I feel like\nI'm speaking a different language so\nthen there's the there's the problem\nwhere I can get certain other people to\nagree in certain other pro players and I\ncan also have clear-cut examples playing\nagainst some of the top like regional\nteams in the world right videos video\nproof tangible evidence things that can\nbe replicated quantifiable things still\nthere's just something too [ __ ]\nexists for people they'll throw they'll\nthrow blanket statements Hail Marys like\nthey'll say that vision is important or\nthey'll say that champions can just dive\na turret and it's an impossible argument\nto really handle verbally or that's how\nI feel\nEllis first of all this is way better\nfor them this is a glimpse you're just\ntalking about one thing now so this is\neasier for me to manage so now these\nplease don't get to we still get to just\nthe core issue which is why D why is it\nimportant to you for to you to convince\nthese people well I feel like it's a\npart of my job but also I want well my\njobs to analyze them coach fine\nso your your job is to Anna so hold on a\nsecond so analysis you're a coach\nwell I have Co I mean I still do\nfreelance coaching for various like LCS\nand all AC players so analysis is very\ndifferent from convincing people\nlike why do you feel like you have to\nconvince people okay so if you were a\nscientist and you discovered certain\nthings but the scientific board says\nthat you're wrong that can actually\nreally harm your career potentially it\ncan call into question your credibility\nterm then it becomes very frustrating if\nyou can quantify or replicate the things\nthat you're talking about like like a\ntest right like you can you mean that's\nhow it works in science that you can go\nand recreate if you talk about freezing\nand how it creates an economic advantage\nbar in certain circumstances like no\nneutral objectives on the map how does\nthat affect your career if lots of\npeople dissent against it some that are\neven prolific within the community that\ncan be really bad because then if I get\nlabeled as so some people genuinely\nthink I'm a contrarian I say things just\nto disagree dissent against the majority\nopinion etc that is very common and then\nyou tell them no I'm not then I tell\nthem no you were [ __ ] flat earther\nlike holy [ __ ] I get really I get really\nI think maybe you're familiar with the\nterm triggered yeah and I sit here in my\nhouse with some of the people I live\nwith one of them is actually one of the\nhe might be the highest ranked Western\nTerran Starcraft one player still in\nstock f1 Nyoka\nthere's WCG USA finalists a couple of\ntimes whatever in starcraft one anyway\nso anyways I talk with him I talked with\nmax person that I live with and we will\njust sit there for two to three hours\nand literally play devil's advocate\ntrying to figure out ways to strangle\nthese [ __ ] conversations and it's so\ninsufferable yeah man so look what I\nwant to point out to you is that the\nconvincing someone right like so\nconvincing the scientific board so\nyou've made it clear\nsorry I keep on having false starts with\nsentences that's okay my words can't\ncatch up to what my mind is kind of\nthinking about so let me just think for\na second so Ellis I think a big problem\nthat you run into is that your logic is\ngood so when we think about you know\nwhen you think about sort of the gold\nrush of esports right now and you think\nabout missed opportunities and\nuncertainty about the future your logic\nis good right so if if now for the first\ntime you can Co stream League events\nthat's not an opportunity you want to\nmiss out on because like once the field\ngets saturated and people like go to\nparticular streamers like it's hard to\nstart streaming later there's the\nproblem is that your logic is good and\nwhen it comes to the the potential\nimpact of you know being viewed as a\ncontrary Anor disrespected by other\npeople in the community how that affects\nyour standing and how that affects your\nprofessional situation that also the\nlogic is good not disagreeing with any\nof your logic what I'm curious about is\nyour personal investment right so if I'm\na scientist and I so I mean I I do this\nright so I I go to let's say like I have\na prospective collaboration with like\nMIT for healthy gamer and studying video\ngame addiction so I kind of go to some\npeople we've also had calls with you\nknow other institutions or organizations\nand we actually had a great call with\nRyan a couple of weeks ago so we you\nknow if I go to someone and I say like\nhey I think this is important and they\nsay no we disagree we don't think it's\nimportant that can be strategically bad\nbut like I don't have to get bent out of\nshape what I'm really curious about is\nwhy you get so personally bent out of\nshape like what what about this is\ntriggering or tilting like as people can\nbe idiots but what's your personal\ninvestment like flat like so flat\nearthers\nyou know or idiotic I think but growing\nup I was called a liar a lot because\nthere were phases of my life where I did\nhave to lie a lot because there would be\ninstances where with my family they\nwould ask me a question and if I knew\nthat if I responded truthfully or\nhonestly it would result in an outburst\nor it's something something physically\nuncomfortable would occur okay and so as\na means to defuse the situation I would\nlie instantly and I would develop ways\nto lie instantly and that stuck with me\nthrough preteen as well as teenage life\neven so even when I stopped lying once I\nfelt more safe and secure with my own\nidentity as well as just knowing how\ncertain situations weren't gonna go etc\nI think there's something about so this\nactually goes back to the living in a\nglass house recording everything etc I\nthink that if I present something and\nsomeone just says no it's wrong I feel\nlike that is very akin to being called a\nliar and when it's about a job that I'm\nso invested into emotionally and\nphysically with the amount of time that\nI sink into it\nit disturbs me on a really pretty deep\nemotional level that I think other\npeople with my same job titles wouldn't\nactually understand because this is all\nthat I do and it's not that I can't\nassert like you on an emotional level\nwhat gets disturbed\nit blows my mind that how how I don't\nknow how to answer it there's like a lot\nof different images in my head a night I\ndon't know how to translate them into\nwords okay yeah I think so let me Alice\nI think we're getting somewhere\nand I think the basic issue here is that\nyou're not fighting the individual\nbattle from today you're fighting a host\nevery conversation that you have with\npeople every disagreement that you have\nwith people about strategy like you said\nit makes you feel like a liar right and\nso what it's actually Avoca within you\nis like all of that stuff so so I think\nthe reason you're so invested personally\nin these conversations which frankly\nsounds kind of idiotic right so there's\na there's a saying in Sanskrit we got to\npass a guard Bhagwat or my language and\npast I gotta pass what means reading the\nBible to a buffalo and it's like it's\nlike you're just gonna get frustration\nlike some situations or the equivalent\nof trying to read the Bible to a buffalo\nand it's just dumb like it's like if you\ntry to do it you can try to read as\nbeautifully and as convincingly as you\nwant but at the end of the day you're\njust talking to a buffalo so they're\njust not gonna understand and and what\nwhat I hear are you doing is like trying\nreally really hard to convince people\nand and to me it sounds you know your\nyour arguments have logic but I don't\nthink that your need to convince them\neven though standing within the\ncommunity and stuff is like all\nimportant there's clearly something else\nthat's driving you because like Flat\nEarth earnest and standing in the\ncommunity or like completely separate\nissues the Flat Earth earnest about the\nthe ridiculousness of it the perception\nof being a liar the sort of living your\nlife in a glass house\nall of these things have nothing to do\nwith your standing in the community\ntheir adaptations or maladaptation x'\nand we can talk about that too like\nhelping you manage like whatever this\nthing is on the inside yes and I think\nwhat happens with you is that when you\nget into an argument with someone you're\ntrying to convince everyone in your past\nin that moment and this is kind of weird\nand messed up but unfortunately it's\njust how our mind works just the rules\nof the game you're trying to convince\neveryone who thought you were a liar\nright like everyone who judged you and\neveryone who said this kid is wrong this\nkid is crazy this kid is stupid and\nyou're trying to fight like all of those\nbattles in that moment because that's\nthe only way that you can get so much\nemotional energy into an individual\nconflict because it can't you just can't\nleave that bent out of shape arguing\nwith some noob on a discussion forum\nabout whether you're strapped like it\njust doesn't make sense right and like\nthat's the condition of the internet so\nif we look at like toxicity and anger\nand tilting on the internet like do you\nreally think every guy who gets super\nsuper bent out of shape is like deeply\nand personally invested in every single\nreddit thread that they posted know it's\nlike misdirected anger and toxicity and\nmisjudgment like in the rest of their\nworld and I see this a lot like the the\nmore ashamed you are of yourself in the\nreal world the more important it is for\nyou to maintain a respectable online\npersona because all of their shame like\nthey use like you know they teach noobs\non the internet like you Smurfs in law\nso that you could feel good about\nyourself and like generally speaking the\npeople who Smurfs you know like suck in\nlife are not confident in themselves in\nsome way right that's it that's my\npersonal toxicity towards Smurfs because\nI have an issue in it so I say ne suck\nat life right but anyway yeah yeah so\nthat's nice thing you brought that up my\npoint is that like like you know you're\nnot just talking to a person there's\nlike a whole pile of stuff and this goes\nback to like bursting at\nthe scene so like let me just tell you\nlike just listen to this okay so\nstressing out stressed insomnia fear\nabout the future anxiety it's my whole\nlife\npsychosomatic stuff physical stuff anger\nyou know flat-earthers you just can't\nunderstand it your whole life is caught\nup in this like esports like respect\nfinancial security like this all this\ndidn't this go I get impostor syndrome a\nlot sometimes yeah when I have these\narguments in these conversations and\nthen so in the first meeting that we had\nyou you asked if I end up blaming myself\nso at the end of this I blame myself\nbecause I think that there's a better\nway to attack the arguments and attack\nthe the problems yeah so but then I\nwonder if I'm [ __ ] crazy or something\nand you know like so it's it's a loop\nyeah absolutely\nso Ellis here's my point like when\nsomeone says there are 50 million things\nwrong I just don't think that there are\n50 million things wrong so one of my\nsupervisors when I was in med school or\nlike one of the psychiatrist I was\nworking with one of the people who\ninspired me to go to psychiatry once\ntold me that if any patient has three\ndiagnoses they're all wrong so sometimes\nlike we'd get these patients that have\nlike had this freaking alphabet of\ndiagnoses MD DG ad PTSD ad D\nyou know like it's like just a bunch of\nletters and it's like that's not like I\ndon't think that this person has four\ndiscrete processes that are going on in\ntheir like mind I don't think they have\nlike four different circuits that are\nbusted like there's one like link\nthere's common stuff there's something\nthat is manifesting his depression\nmanifesting his anxiety making it\ndifficult for them to concentrate and\noftentimes it's trauma like traumas like\nwhere all this crap starts and you've\nhad your fair share and so I think that\nwhen you have all of these like like\nissues around you know stressing out\ninsomnia like I don't think that's the\nproblem I think the basic problem is\nthat you've got some stuff from the past\nwhich like acts on the present and you\ndon't deal with the stuff from the past\nso another way to kind of say that is\nyou said the the first week went well\nlike earlier like at the very beginning\nof this conversation you said yeah I\nmanaged week one well week two is when\nthe problems started and I wanted to\nstop you right there and I was like no\nmy friend the mistake was in week one\nbecause week one is when you let that\n[ __ ] the problem is that the only time\nyou notice that there's trash to be\nemptied is when your trashcan is\noverflowing that's what your life looks\nlike in a nutshell like the problem is\nthat you're like oh there's like trash\non the floor oh maybe I like oh like\nthere's that my trashcan is overflowing\nso let me just take all of the stuff on\nthe top that's spilling out and throw\nthat away and we're gonna leave all the\nother trash in the trash can we're just\ngonna take all the stuff that's spilling\nover the top and we're gonna deal with\nthat but your problem is in that first\nweek you're kind of saying like okay I'm\ngonna do this I'm gonna crucify myself\nfor 1/10 hour work weeks because they're\nreally good opportunities here and then\nI'll take a break later and then I'm\ngonna go back to crusing find myself\nyour whole system of managing whatever\nit is that you're managing I think is\nnot working well and that's why it's\nlike you have stuff that's like seeping\nout it's like getting like tilting it at\nnoobs who don't understand like I don't\nI don't I don't get and I mean I do get\nbut I'm gonna just say like so you know\nif you really are\nsaying the validity of your argument and\nsomeone is too [ __ ] dumb to get it\nlike that\nmakes me feel like once you sort of get\nthat you don't try to convince them\nanymore because you realize it's a lost\ncause but you get tilted and then like\nyour body also starts giving out and you\nget like allergen and asthma problems\nand stuff like that and and so it's it's\njust like literally like you're you're\nbuilding up I don't know I wish there\nwas like some word for you know like\nDEET like not debuff it's like it you're\njust building up like stress it's like\nyou have a stress if you play darkest\ndungeon this is what it is no you guys\nplay okay so like in darkest dungeon\nit's a fantastic game by the way I mean\nif you're like in a competitive games\nit's not like it's a single-player game\nso darkest dungeon it's it's like cool\nso you have this party right and like\nthe idea behind this is like your party\nis gonna get screwed so you like your\ncharacters die there's perma death they\nlike get like they get like Pete they\nliterally get PTSD and they like can't\nfight properly and stuff like that it's\nlike an amazing kind of game and so what\nhappens so darkest dungeon introduced a\nreally cool concept in gaming which I\ndon't see very much which is we always\nhave like HP bars and MP bars we have\nlike resources that we use up and\ndiminish over time and then when we get\nempty we die right like when you run out\nof HP is when you die an agency starts\nfull and you kind of run out of HP so\ndarkest dungeon actually did the\nopposite to where they added this this\nstat called stress and as your stress\nincreases your character like gets\nscrewed so like you're in this dungeon\nwhere like people are getting like every\ntime you get a critical every time your\ncharacter gets critically hit everyone\nin your party gets like like stress so\nlike stress is like zero out of 200 so\nthey got like nine points of stress and\nthen once you win hit 100 they like they\nhave to make like some kind of check and\nif they like hit 100 and they don't make\nthat check properly\nthey get like some kind of permanent\ndebuff they get like a 30% missed chance\nor like they lose like you know like\ntheir disease resistance goes down\nsometimes they start to panic and they\nlike won't act\nlike instead of like attacking they'll\njust sit there and [ __ ] their pants and\nand like so I think it's a cool game I\nlove the game but in your case I think\nwhat's happening is you're building too\nop stress like there's some meter within\nyou that is filling up and it's like\nyour trashcan is filling up filling up\nfilling up and the only time you notice\nit is when it overflows and then what\nyou try to manage is the overflow it's\nlike I'm exhausted haven't slept let me\ngo get a banana bag that's like taking\nthe five bits of trash from the top of\nyour trash can and like taking them out\nand throwing them away and leaving your\ntrashcan leftover yeah and the trash can\nis filled up in week one like you put\nyour body like the the other problem is\nthat you're so resilient and your\nwillpower is so strong that you can\ntolerate like it's like your you know\nyour Constitution can tolerate rotting\nfood in your trash can whereas like\nother people can't tolerate that so they\nclean out their trash in a bizarre way\nyour capacity your Constitution and your\nresilience allow you to propagate\nunhealthy situations to the breaking\npoint and there's something really\nbizarre that I see in some people which\nis that some people suffer like\nconsequences you know when they're at 70\npercent 50 percent 30 percent and some\npeople don't bend some people only break\nand I think you fall into this category\nwhere like you you can function at a\nvery high level until your breaking\npoint and then you just snap yes in the\nsuit that happens the snaps happen\nabsolutely man\nthey know that they happen almost if I\ncould like pull in some of my roommates\nor something to like answer I mean no\nI'm not going to I'm just saying the\ncycles tend to be about nine weeks and\nthen there's a very big snap and then\neverything goes away and it's like it's\nback to zero the snaps are really scary\nnot like yeah I don't know how to\ndescribe them so yeah so this is\nimportant for people who are watching\ntoo so I want you guys to understand\nlike\nyour pattern is not uncommon in fact\nwhen it comes to gamers I think they're\nremarkably resilient so I think that\ngamers are very good at dealing with\njust gigantic piles of like a negative\nemotion and other stuff right that's why\nwe all procrastinate and like don't deal\nwith our problems and stuff like that\nand then like we have this you know it's\nlike you've got this basement that's\njust full of crap and in your case I I\njust don't think that your life is gonna\ncontinue to be sustainable and the\nchallenge the challenge is that none of\nyour logic is wrong right like so from a\ncareer standpoint it may be a good idea\nto scream LCS it may be a good idea to\nwork 110 hours a week but I think that\nworking 110 hours a week and at the same\ntime spending half of your energy\ntilting it noobs like you just don't\nhave the energy to tilt at news we've\nnot another working 110 hours a week I I\nthink um this most recent leak Saturday\nmy coke asterisms Brendan Valdez\nI remember before set to started I was\nactually welling up and I sort of like\nlaugh to him and I said I'm just gonna\nI'm gonna have a breakdown and he looked\nat me like what's wrong and I said I\ndon't [ __ ] know and I started\npanicking because usually when I'm in a\nwork mode I won't have a breakdown or I\nwon't have like a snap but five minutes\nbefore the cast went live I was welling\nup my legs were shaking and I'm like\nholy [ __ ] I'm just gonna start crying\nand I [ __ ] was just feeling so many\nemotions managed to get together\ncast the second series went home and\n[ __ ] it went right to sleep but that\nwas a very unsettling thing but\nsometimes there's just moments where all\nI want to do is cry and scream and I\njust want everything to stop\nso and we agree with you what do you do\nthen LS when you wanna throw in\neverything so you do pride scream oh\nyeah sometimes and I ask I ask roommates\nto like leave the house and stuff\nand it's like literally something\nhappens like a [ __ ] drama or like you\nknow something to watch on Netflix I\nliterally just have an emotional\nbreakdown and I'm like okay I'm reset as\n[ __ ] crazy is that sound like let's\ndo it again yeah man yeah so now we're\ngonna talk about we're gonna talk about\nadaptive and maladaptive okay so we I'm\nglad you're able to share all this stuff\nhopefully you know the noobs won't\nattack you for your freezing strategy\nbecause of what you're saying here today\nand and so well that's just so I want I\nwant people to understand this too so I\nso your body your mind and your brain\ndoes the best that it can with the crap\nthat you throw at it right like that's\njust how like and so what happens is as\nwe deal with emotions like we're not\nreally taught this stuff which is a huge\nhuge problem like we are not really\ntaught how to deal with emotions we're\nnot really taught like how our mind\nworks we're not really taught this stuff\nso our body just comes up and we come up\nwith the best solutions that we can\nwhich are sort of adaptive and\nmaladaptive its adaptive because if we\nthink about like an adaptive you know\nevolutionary trait it's something that\nallows us to succeed in a particular\nenvironment and in your case like I\nthink this sort of reset breakdown\nwhatever you have every nine weeks is\nlike it's actually like helps you\nsucceed like you like because you just\nyou know you have all these emotions\nthat kind of build up build up build up\nyou're like okay five minutes before\ncast im Welling up I'm about to break\ndown okay like let me just let me shove\nlike this is like when you take your\nhands and you like shove the trash you\npack the trash in your trashcan you pack\nit down so that you can put more trash\nin there we're gonna pack it down we're\ngonna pack it down more put more [ __ ]\nthey're more more trash in there and\nthen soot like that's the strategy right\nand then every once in a while like what\nhappens is your trash can starts to\nbulge and then it starts to ferment and\nit produces acid and then like one day\nlike just your trash can just breaks and\nlike falls apart and there's crap all\nover you know your your kitchen and then\nyou scoop it all up and you clean it all\nout and then and then you go and you get\nyourself another you know paper trashcan\nand then you you put it there and it's\nthe same trashcan that used last time\nyou're not gonna get a metal one you can\nuse the same one get yourself a trash\nbag money you put it in and then and\nthen you just you start shoving stuff in\nthere again so but that works for you\nright so like this is the crazy thing\nwhen we think about all of this stuff\nthat you're describing insomnia you know\nanxiety anger tilting break down it's\nlike we look at that and we say like oh\nthis must be mental illness incorrect\nthis is your system of adaptation\nthere's also something very important to\nunderstand our mind does the best that\nit can and so even situations like\nanxiety is it like an illness sure but\nin a lot of experience that I've seen\nanxiety serves a very very important\nmechanism\nso usually anxiety is protective\nso anxiety keeps us from doing the\nthings that are gonna make us like look\nand feel dumb right like it protects\nother people from ridiculing us if you\nreally stop and think about it like\nthat's what it's doing so anxiety is a\nway that we can protect ourselves from\nbeing like judged and viewed as idiots\nso if we really look at all of this\nstuff I mean not all of mental illness\nbecause I don't think for example\nschizophrenia has an adaptive mechanism\nbut in your case you know you have all\nthis stuff which people can like say is\nlike you know patterns of mind and it's\nlike actually like that's how you\nfunction cuz you you can work a hundred\nten hours a week and then have a\nbreakdown reset and then it's back back\nto working 110 now I think I think what\nwe've got to figure out is like do you\nwant to continue this are you happy with\nwhere you are or do you want to change\nI want to well I mean it goes it goes\nback to what I what I said well okay I\nguess I don't know how you're asking the\nquestion do you want do you want to\ncontinue doing what I'm doing or yeah\nlike like what am i my work and stuff do\nyou want something to change about your\nlife are you happy with things\ncontinuing at their current track oh\nJesus no I yeah obvious\nobviously in in private I always look\nfor ways that I think I think I\nmentioned this and the first time that\nwe spoke look for ways to fix or change\nsomething however difficult it is so\nthat this cycle stops breaking the cycle\nis like what do you want to change order\nI want the cycle to stop what is this\nlike the cycle is somehow convincing\nmyself to go beyond the breaking point\nyou know constantly working through\nwhatever right now I am in the best I'm\nfinancially and just work wise and\neverything I'm in the best place I've\never been like I'm I'm at a peak right\nnow maybe it's gonna even keep going up\netc and yet I have like a feeling that\nthe only way that I can describe it is\nhomelessness and it is a very it is a\nvery dark feeling obviously it's very\ndevoid of anything and it feels so empty\nand scary right and it's like sometimes\nI'll have a conversation with someone\nand they'll just remind me of so many\nthings and then it sort of helps\nalleviate the the feeling and stuff\nobviously I want that feeling to go away\nbecause I think that that feeling helps\nreinforce the cycle and it helps\nreinforce so I need to figure out a way\nto get my brain to accept and be content\nwith everything as it is right now\nwithout feeling over panicked anxious\nabout everything and feeling like I'm in\na constant like fear of missing out if\nthat makes sense yeah while\nsimultaneously feeling empty so you said\nthe feeling is homelessness it feels\nlike homelessness okay\nI wait to put it yeah so Ellis I think\nat some point okay now we get to the you\nknow psychoanalytic kind of stuff so\nthank you so much for for saying that I\nI don't know what you know I don't know\nwhat the perception of people who are\nwatching is I feel like we've talked\nabout a lot of stuff kind of tied stuff\ntogether but I think we're like at a\nreally good spot now\nGillies I mean I am in terms of I think\nthere's yeah you need to take a minute I\nI have had an anxiety no no I've had\nanxiety all week this is um like in an\nunhealthy kind of way this is the best\nI've been breathing in like a week\nso I actually thought it was asthma so\nlike just before we started this call\nactually I took my I took my albuterol\nand my advair yeah and just so that\nthere wouldn't be any breathing\ndifficulties whatever but now I'm\nrealizing that it's not as m''e and that\nthere was just a shitload of [ __ ]\nanxiety going on because I can breathe\nreally well right now\nso odd and it feels like you know the\nperson sitting on me just sort of got up\nso the conversations been helpful in\nthat regard all right but uh [ __ ]\nsucks man holy [ __ ]\nI can breathe it right now it's been a\nwhile you know it's coming back though\ncoming back you mean the elephant is\nstarting the fat guy sitting on you just\nsuckin the whale back that that whale\nwho plays lul and does it agree with the\nidea of freezing he says you just need\nmoney well it's just one it's all it's\nall one guy this is the thing Ellis it's\nall one guys like seriously when you\ntilt on them it's like so this is the\nthing the body and mind are linked right\nso when you say oh I didn't I didn't I\nrealize it's not asthma I actually\ndisagree so now we come to psychosomatic\nright\nthis is making me have asthma I the two\nare linked it's like your body and mind\nare linked so anxiety makes asthma worse\nso like so the the conditions that are\nautoimmune are significantly altered by\nyour mental state so rheumatoid\narthritis things like chronic Lyme\ndisease asthma IBS all autoimmune\nconditions are heavily influenced by the\nmind and what's happening is when that\nwhen your trashcan is overflowing you\nfeel it in terms of emotions but it's\nalso gonna manifest as asthma okay so\nthis is important I don't want you to\nthink because a lot of people think that\npsychosomatic means all in your head I\ndon't think the asthma is all in your\nhead I think the only way that your body\nknows how to process the stress it's\nlike your body is starting to give out\nright like well you've got five lanes\nand League and if you're under pressure\nsometimes one of the one of the your\nchampions is gonna give out so asthma is\none way of you giving out the breakdown\nis another way of you get giving out you\nknow yelling at noobs is a third way to\nfor you to break when those are all\nsigns of like fracturing right that's\nthe trash can overflowing and so the\ncool thing is that when you talk like\nthis and you start to get some sense and\nlike why do you think you feel better\nnow like what have we done um I don't\nknow I I think just having a\nconversation with someone helps a lot\nbecause I don't actually get to UM I\ndon't have to talk about cuz usually um\nsome people that I'll talk to about\nthese very things they'll just it's not\nreally a conversation it's like I don't\nknow how to describe it's sort of like a\nI don't know how to describe it okay so\nactually I'll tell you the way that I\ndescribe it to some of my roommates I am\na dog that everyone wants to be around\nuntil I start barking and then when I\nstart barking they want to lock me in a\nroom and until the barking stops they\ndon't want to treat the barking or why\nis the dog barking so that's that that's\nthe conversation with your teacher\nthat that's a similar conversation that\nthat's how I feel yeah I feel like a\nbarking dog and you know what actually\ncares what yeah yeah absolutely right so\nthat sounds way closer to me to this\nthis thing with your teacher when she\nwas like why is this kid having\nbehavioral problems and this is the\nproblem LS is that like deep down I\nthink your sense of identity that I'm\ngonna stop okay let's go back to the\nsources actually that while I am\nenamored with my ability to formulate\nand understand people I don't know how\nhelpful that's gonna be um so let's go\nback to why does this help like how does\nthis work we're just talking um there's\nsomething humane about it okay\nwhereas most times I think when I talk\nto people I am the idea or the\npersonification of my character within\nthe eSports community sure and that I'm\nnot me and that my problems are only a\ndetriment to whoever I'm talking to and\nit we move better if I go back to just\nbeing LS who they need me to be yeah\nright so I was saying deep down your\nidentity dot dot dot so we'll come back\nto that so good you went there so I\ndidn't need to go there but so I want to\nunderstand from a mechanistic so let's\nlet's think about mechanism okay so\nlet's pretend we're playing an RTS and\nthe RTS is talking to LS on stream with\ndr. k and and we noticed something which\nis that like LS is breathing is improved\nhe feels better what what did we if we\ngo back and we watch the replay like\nwhat's the mechanism tell me like how is\nthis happening using any of the language\nor any of the imagery that we've talked\nabout today like how is this helping you\nlike what's happening I think a lot of\nit is it's helping me feel or I don't\nknow if the phrase is less crazy but it\nfeels it's sort of like when no one\nwants to listen to you or believe or\ntalk about any of the things that you're\nsaying but then you have a conversation\nwith someone that's just willing\nit's sort of like a [ __ ] it's sort of\nlike when when someone says I don't even\nknow again I'm just seeing images I\ndon't can you dislike you know one of\nthe images is a girl breaking down and\nlike a diner she's in a booth and she's\njust talking to a waitress and she just\nstarts crying and says finally I know\nthat sounds really weird I I think in a\nlot of describe I just see lots of\nimages and I try to put them into words\nI think that was very illustrative thank\nyou so it just it it it feels like holy\n[ __ ] you know like everyone just doesn't\ncare or want to listen to her and then\nfinally the waitress or something is\njust willing to talk and it's just so\noverwhelming that it's like a [ __ ]\nfloodgate you know someone's you know\nyeah pretty much that that that's the\nimage that I think is the strong that's\na beautiful image thanks I don't know\nwhat it comes from yeah it's raining in\nthe image got that go absolutely I think\nit's I could have you know yeah I think\nraining makes sense to me you know it's\nit's I think it's a really good\ndescription of your life in a lot of\nways so I think I think twitch chat has\nfigured it out so twitch chat knows what\nwe're doing\nso twitch chat do you guys know how this\nis helping so I've seen it it pop up a\ncouple of times like what are we doing\nwith him yes you look at that they say\nare you on game can I tell you something\nyeah there's there's a couple of people\nin chat right now and I don't know this\ntilts me tells me out of my mind\nwhat is pathetic fallacy mean do you\nknow what the they might be saying I\ndon't know what that means I don't know\neither so I need to know okay good so\nwe'll get to that we'll get to that okay\nyeah okay so so what what did so aside\nfrom the few person sad pathetic fallacy\nbecause I don't even know what it's\ncalled and what what are the other\npeople in your chat saying\nbecause my cat has it figured out so I\ndon't know if it's just because by the\nway well I'm not streaming i'm not\nstreaming oh you're not suing okay no I\nknow I don't shrimp when I do this okay\nI would rather direct traffic so I'm\nreally impressed with like like cuz\ntwitch at dude like these guys learn and\ngirls and other other things you know so\nI think their overwhelming sense is that\nyou're taking out the trash okay\noh when we're having yeah make sense\nright and so that's how this works right\nso it's it's not when you kind of think\nabout like what's the effect of this\nconversation this is going to help you\nin the next week because you've managed\nand emptied out some of that trash so as\nyou build that stress in that trash\nyou've got to manage it by talking about\nit so seeing a therapist I don't know\nexactly what you know what therapy is\nlike in South Korea but you know talking\nto someone can certainly help I think\nthe other thing that's happening is that\nwe're helping you be and so this is the\nadvantage of therapy by the way right so\nlike we all have emotions and stuff like\nour trash can fills up throughout the\nday and I'll teach you a meditation\ntechnique that's kind of about unwinding\nat the end of today so remind me to\nteach you that the other thing so we\nkind of build up emotions and like\nnegative experiences feelings and stuff\nlike that and then we need some place to\ntake out the trash so if you take out\nthe trash the cool thing LS is that I\nthink all of this stuff will get better\nso I think your asthma will get better\nyour insomnia will get better your your\nanxiety will get better it's not gonna\nhappen overnight and needs to happen on\na regular basis because you have a lot\nof trash filled up like what you've been\ndoing is instead of a trash can you\nactually have a basement where you throw\nall your trash and so for years and\nyears and years you have a basement\nthat's just filled up the other thing LS\nthat I think you kind of really struggle\nwith and maybe we can talk about this\nnext time\nis I think your sense of identity is\nlike all warped so I think part of this\nwhole glass house thing you try to be\nlike super transparent but I think deep\ndown there's sense of emptiness I don't\nknow if you really know who you are\nI think that you're not confident you're\nnot confident in yourself so I think a\nlot of your uncertainty has to do with\nyou know you don't know that you're\ngonna land on your feet and and knowing\nthat you're gonna land on your feet\ntends to come from like a good sense of\nconfidence and who you are as a person\nlike being secure within yourself and I\nthink we see other signs of sort of like\na kind of a shaky identity which is that\nyou know the opinions of others start to\ninfluence you way more like so if I have\na clear sense of who I am and like the\nworld calls me an idiot like if I Know\nWho I am I'm gonna be able to protect\nmyself from that because I know it's\nkind of like you know the whole path I\ngotta Padma thing like if I know that\nother people are idiots and that my\nstrategy is a good one like I don't have\nto try to convince them of anything like\nif they're too dumb to realize it like\nfine I'm just gonna own them harder and\nharder and harder and the people who\nunderstand it will like improve and the\npeople who don't want to accept me like\nthey're just gonna like they're gonna\nsuck they're gonna keep on losing MMR or\nrank or whatever but in your case I\nthink there's something about needing to\nprove yourself to other people and\nimposter syndrome streaming all this\nstuff gets exacerbated because you've\nbecome this persona but essentially like\nthe person who needs to prove themselves\nis the person who like isn't confident\nin themself and so I think we've got to\ngo back to like you know when you like\nlike who are you really like who is ls\nand what is a less capable of like who\nare you yeah I'm curious I think yeah\num I don't know actually\nyeah this goes back to what I said in\nthe first conversation I don't really\nhave a purpose but because this is all\nthat I've done I feel like my only\npurpose is helping others it sounds so\nfun\nit sounds so stupid to say like\nappreciate strategy more inside of video\ngames but I think that strategy in\nitself is art and I think that there is\na lot of correlations or things that can\nshow themselves in other areas of life\nthat you can derive from strategy games\nno no see that's beautiful that is your\npurpose I think so so but this is this\nis the crazy thing right like so despite\nhaving such a pure purpose that no one\nlike people don't say that kind of thing\nman so like that is a sign of like\nthat's actually true purpose like you\nlove strategy games you love learning\nstrategy you love applying to strategy a\nstrategy to like other parts of your\nlife you love talking about strategy\ngames that's what you're on this earth\nto do my friend the question is why is\nit that you can't just accept that right\nlike so there's something within you\nthat like like I think you've actually\ngot your purpose figured out I think\nyour problem is like you don't know who\nyou are\nso when you say like my purpose is to\nexplore strategy to its fullest extent\nbecause I think it's amazing the second\nhalf of that sentence is fine I think my\nI think where you fall short is with the\nfirst word which is my and you don't\nknow who you are but I think what you're\ndoing is awesome I think like you love\nstrategy you love eSports you love\ngaming and if that's what you want to\nspend your life doing that I say go for\nit man and and see what happens is like\nyeah that there's more stuff I want to\ndo down the line that I need to grow\nbigger in order to do like in terms of\nlike setting up networks and other stuff\ngo like whatever\nokay I find a lot of probably very odd\noff things pretty or beautiful or\nexciting like art and stuff I'm sorry\nyou said odd off yeah like on like like\nthings that maybe most people wouldn't I\ndon't know I guess that's just my\nopinion yeah so so I I think going\nforward we've got to do some you know\nwork on like who you are but I think a\ncouple of concrete things do you have\nany questions by the way so I'm gonna\nkind of try to summarize because we've\nbeen at this for a little while now okay\ndoes this feel like a stopping point to\nyou yeah sure I mean I I don't really do\nanything so I don't like I don't I think\nafter whenever I was gonna be done\ntalking with you I was gonna watch the\nnew Walking Dead episode and then\nprobably sleep okay so I don't really\nhave a schedule right now okay okay yeah\nokay so um so let me let me try to just\nsummarize a couple of things okay so\nfirst of all I'm glad you came on again\nand I've thoroughly enjoyed talking to\nyou I think unless you are just a really\nawesome dude and I think that you know\nunderneath all the anxiety and insomnia\nand all that other kind of crap like I\nlove to hear that you are an artist when\nit comes to strategy like you'll love\nand appreciate strategy like art because\nI think that's we need people like you\nman\nbecause the problem is that like the\nrest of the world doesn't take the\ngaming community seriously they don't\nthey don't understand that you can have\na beautiful work of art that is like\nlike you know a book you can have a\nbeautiful work of art that is a movie\nand you can have a beautiful work of art\nthat is a video game like for many many\nyears when people ask me what kind of\nmusic I like I would say instrumental\nmusic but what I really meant is in my\nfree time I listen to like soundtracks\nfrom video games that's what that's what\nI listed to I listen to Chrono Trigger\ndivinity original sin usually\nsingle-player RPGs you know like that's\nwhat I listen to like sometimes some OC\nremix from Street Fighter 2 and some\nold-school stuff\num when my two-year-old like when she\nwas young I used to sing her the tearin\ntheme from Starcraft wanted to put her\nto sleep oh man it's just nuts but like\nthat's what she loves the Terran theme\nand and like that's out like that's her\n- lullaby like you know cuz like it's\nit's like 2:00 in the morning she's not\nfalling asleep I've sung everything that\nI know how to sing and I just try to\nthink about okay what can I sing for 30\nminutes without getting bored I won best\nbaby lullaby ever right nice it turns to\nget theme it's a great thing yeah yeah\nit's a really only one you can kind of\nlike sing to a kid you know like you\ncan't really do that with desert music\nno so I I think it's awesome that like\nyou really are devoted to strategy I\nthink you know what your purpose is I\nthink the problem is that you've\ndeveloped some strategies to help you\nsucceed in your goals but that those\nstrategies are actually maladaptive they\nwork but they're not ideal and the basic\ngist of it is that like you know whether\nwe talk about asthma or stress or\ninsomnia anxiety falling apart breaking\napart all that stuff is this I mean it's\nnot the same there's you know it's\ncomplicated and there are all kinds of\nstuff going on but I think basically\nlike your problem is that you're not\nemptying the trash and it doesn't take a\nwhole lot so I don't think like you need\na spa day once a week I think you need\nto you know it sounds like you're eating\nwell you hydrate really well that's\nreally great it sounds like you need\nsome kind of emotional support so I\ndon't know what that looks like if you\nhave you know therapists or something\nlike that I don't know well I'm gonna\nhave to think about that but I think on\nsome level it doesn't you have to be\nnecessarily talking to someone but like\nprocessing your emotions so now I'd like\nto teach you a meditation technique\naround that so we'll stop after the\nmeditation technique but a couple of\nother things so going for it I think the\nbig issue here is that somewhere along\nthe way you aren't even though you know\nwhat you like and you know what it is\ndue to fear of judgment or something\nlike that like there's fear of judgment\nthere's not being taken seriously for\nwhatever reason you cannot be confident\nin the person that you are\ncan't be comfortable in the person that\nyou are even though you know you want to\ndo a lot of stuff and you want to expand\nyour network you're afraid about your\nfuture right whereas like when you say\nthings like this it actually makes me\nthink your future is gonna be fine man\nbecause a lot of people like\ntransitioning out of eSports into other\nstuff is something that people are\ngetting better and better at it's\nbecoming more of an industry and you're\nactually thinking about it like I'm\nconfident that you're gonna do well\nactually but for whatever reason your\nsense of identity hasn't formed well so\nI think that's something overall like I\nthink we so I'm happy to do this with\nyou but what what you really need to do\nis try to figure out like when did you\ngo off track like when did you lose\nconfidence in the person that you are\nwhen did you fundamentally like when did\nthe default become failure instead of\nsuccess\nbecause I think once I started being\nmore aware of my my age okay so that is\na trash can that needs to be emptied the\nlast thing that I'll kind of share with\nyou before meditation is that I want you\nto understand that like when you get\ntilted or involved with like like that\neach individual interaction and this is\nfor people at home to like you're not\njust dealing with that interaction your\nhistory in the emotional weight from the\npast actually like plays into that\ninteraction so if you feel like\nuncomfortable about your appearance or\nyou're afraid about dating or something\nlike that like all of those anxieties\nfrom the past and like that like lack of\nconfidence and like fear that you're\ngonna be rejected or unlovable like all\nthat crap enters your mind and actually\nlike affects you when you ask someone\nthat you're attracted to out and so you\ngot to deal with all that crap from the\npast and then you'll be free from it and\nyour life is gonna feel way easier\nmy goal for uls is to feel like get that\nthat Elephant Man off your chest like\nthat's what we should do right and then\nif you live life I think you're gonna be\nyou're gonna be good okay\nTodd's questions I'm ready for\nmeditation yeah sure okay so sit up\nstraight I don't know if my chair hold\non okay like fully straight what yeah\nyeah totally straight back straight okay\nokay okay\nlet your shoulders relax a little bit so\nspine is different from shoulders no I\nknow yeah\ntry to bring your elbows weird you don't\nknow what I thought you just don't want\nto relax yeah that's really weird so\nthey're just tense it's actually I I\nthink this is this is just I don't want\nto describe my legs are tapping right\nnow yeah like I think this is just my\nbody is just very tense right now yeah\nokay so if you can't yeah so so what\nwhat I want you to try to do is let your\narms hang\nlet let gravity pull your arms down as\nlow as low as they'll go\nI have arm rests okay so scoot scoot\nscoot forward to the edge of your chair\nyeah okay sure\nright yeah okay okay and then now now\nlet your shoulders hang good better so I\nwant you to do this literally that yep\nand now put your palms in front of you\nlike like let them rest in your lap yeah\nokay let your shoulders relax\ngood okay trying yeah just let them fall\nto the ground right so this is this is\ntense this is like straight then just\nlet them down push them down yeah good\nnow close your eyes and now I'm gonna\nwalk you through a particular set I'm\ngonna give you some instruction on yeah\nwhat sorry well I I don't like closing\nmy yeah sorry you don't like closing\nyour eyes yeah\nwhat don't you like about closing your\neyes\nfeel vulnerable I don't know I don't\nknow um you feel unsafe something uh not\nunsafe there's something unsettling\nabout it not being pure black like I\nhave a you know the things that go over\nhmm just sleep yeah I've used those okay\nyeah I have to use those and whenever I\ntry to de-stress like on my own I have\nto use that I can't just close my eyes\nokay\nbut yeah I don't I don't know why okay\nso try closing your eyes\nmm-hmm okay so so I feel like the the\ntechnique for you today is actually not\nour technique it's just relax your\nshoulders and close your eyes that's\nwhat we're going to start but let's\nlet's try to give something for people\nat home so this is what I want you to do\nI'm gonna teach you kind of an unwind by\nthe way do you feel good in the morning\nuh depends what's the first thing I see\non my phone if I see that there's a new\nreddit thread or if I see there's tweets\nthat make me want to jump off my balcony\nand you know I mean okay it affects\nother morning we'll go okay okay so it\nsounds like but in the morning before\nhow often do you check your how quickly\ndo you check your phone after you wake\nup instantly so that needs slightly\nunder my pillow that needs to stop Ellis\nokay how do we get that okay so open\nyour eyes for a second so I know I'm\nsupposed to teach meditation right now\nand I've got to go in like 15 minutes\nbut this this okay so this needs to stop\nokay so when it comes to emptying out\nyour trash can so talking with other\npeople meditating you got to put your\nphone somewhere else and you got to give\nyourself like like half an hour or 45\nminutes before you check your phone or\nbefore you check reddit how do we how do\nwe make that happen um I feel like\nsuffocating if I don't know what's going\non as soon as I wake up\nI always feels like okay so there's a\nlot of people that will message me like\nwith them listening whether it be\nplayers that'll message me on discord or\nthough the M me or other people I feel\nlike because I'm operating on different\ntime zones that I need to try to reply\nas soon as I can and so like I know that\nif I wake up at 9 a.m.\nhow do you how often do you shower every\n36 hours usually okay so when you all\ndepending on castes so if I'm casting I\nshower every single day because they use\nhairspray and other stuff and I get\ntilted but yeah okay so so like I would\nsay like when you wake up do you shower\nit usually at night or in the morning\ndepends what I'm doing the next day okay\nso I you got to figure something out to\navoid avoid your phone for 30 minutes\nokay when you wake up like I was gonna\nsay an hour but like you got it like eat\nor or you know do something like go\noutside go for a walk like do whatever\nyou want to just no phone for 30 minutes\nyou got to make that really even go out\nthe corona though okay looks like a void\npublic place yeah I don't know a lot of\nplaces are out me or close it sucks yeah\nso so practically though I want you to\nthink about it this way LS the more time\nthat your mind spends in that space of\nstress and the more stress you're gonna\nfeel so you need to give your line you\nneed to learn how to break away from\nthat space for just a little while and\nno wonder you have no idea who you are\nbecause like you're never alone like\nNetflix huh what if I watch Netflix\nNetflix is fine just not on your phone\nokay\nokay so you can watch on your computer\nbut like no checking no social media for\n30 minutes after you wake up you can\nwatch Netflix you can lay in bed you can\nmeditate you can you know you can do\nwhatever you want to but just no social\nmedia for 30 minutes eat something yeah\ntake a dump be honest I think usually\nthings week\nlike discord calls or phone call or\nalarm okay so fine to alarm but like\nmute your discord when you go to sleep\nokay let's just talk about like Here I\nam trying to come up with all these\ncomplicated like psychoanalytic\nformulations for you and it's just like\nyeah just stay away from your phone for\nlike half an hour just see what it does\nto your mindset okay okay because you're\nstarting the day off like what you're\ndoing is you're giving your adrenaline\nsystem a big kick as soon as you wake up\nlike you don't need coffee\nit's like oh [ __ ] if that's like you\nwake up you check your phone you're like\noh [ __ ] that's not coffee that's the\nfirst thing I do okay fine so have\ncoffee and enjoy it and just don't look\nat your phone there are these things\nit's kind of weird like before you know\ngaming and computers they used to like\ninstead of Reddit they would like take\nlike a bunch of reddit pages and they\nwould like put them together on paper\nand they would like binders dinner huh\nnewspaper what a book no like yeah yeah\nit's a book a book you've read so so you\nknow sometimes it's kind of like a it's\nlike reddit threads that are all like\nlinked to each other it's actually\nreally cool and it's like they're all\nlike linked together so it's kind of\nlike if you were to like read like you\nknow it's kind of like a vlog like all\nof them are related but it's like it's\nlike one story so check one of those out\nyou know anyway so enough of me being an\nass seriously spend a half an hour in\nthe morning away from your phone okay so\nnow I'm going to teach you guys the\ntechnique okay so close your eyes and\nwhat I want you to do so you're in the\nhand position yeah yeah okay so what I\nwant you to do is I want you to think\nabout the kind of like the last thing\nthat happened before we started talking\nand I want you to think about any\nemotions that you felt with that event\nokay and then I want you to go to the\nthing before so so basically what you\nwant to do before you go to bed at night\nis you can do this technique and\nthroughout the day what's what's so\nfunny the dark humor in me the thing I\ndid before this\nit was there was a fiora and she's a\ndirty inter do you ever get someone that\nruns it down in your game and dota huh\nthey just intentionally feed yeah yeah\nyeah they just they make it so you can't\nplay well that what's the thing before\nthis that actually made me end my stream\nand the thing before her was a different\ndirty inter okay\ngood so now we're getting somewhere okay\ngood Alice okay so good so so okay so\nclose your eyes I want to go back to\nthose exactly so what I want you to do\nis acknowledge the emotions that you\nfelt without getting into it okay you\ncan laugh it's okay so like yeah like so\nyou said like I had a dirty fiora or\nwhatever and and she fed and then like I\nwas super pissed off and tilted and I\ndecided to quit my stream and now go to\nthe game before and so what was the\nsituation there like acknowledge to the\nsituation oh I felt super tilted yeah\nright and then what happened before yeah\nI think we opened an 8-minute served\nlike 10 minutes yeah what does that mean\nyou know opening is everyone just let's\nthe enemy push okay so I want you to\ncontinue going backwards in time mm-hm\nand try to get like to a pretty small\nresolution so I'll give you an example\nof my routine like before you know like\nlike when I do this meditation before\nbad so I usually do it before bed\nso like before I got into bed I changed\nmy clothes before I changed my clothes I\nbrushed my teeth before I brush my teeth\nI brushed my kids teeth before I brush\ntheir teeth my little kid had taken the\ncap off of the toothpaste and was eating\ntoothpaste again and I got pissed off at\nher because she really needs to stop\neating toothpaste and and then I had to\nfight with her about you know she wanted\nto open the toothpaste and she wanted to\ndo it herself and and I got kind of\nfrustrated with that and before that I\nchanged them into pajamas and before I\nchanged them into pajamas we were like\ndoing like a pillow fight dance party\nkind of thing and then that was a lot of\nfun and then before that I\nate dinner at 10 o'clock at night\nbecause I didn't get a chance to eat\nuntil then and then before that I did\nthis and then I did this and this is how\nI felt then and with dinner like I\nreally enjoyed the food because it was\nhealthy but I really wanted like a slice\nof pepperoni pizza cuz that's just like\nfatty and delicious and before that I\ndid this and I felt like this so you\njust kind of track back so the thing a\ncouple of important things to remember\none is that you don't want to dive into\nanything okay so I noticed that when you\nstarted recalling the game like you\nbecame pretty attached to the game and\nyou dived into those feelings quickly so\nyou want to acknowledge them and then\nmove back acknowledge move back\nacknowledge move back and try to go all\nthe way back to when you started your\nday and how you felt the moment you woke\nup I was tilted first thing in the\nmorning\nyeah okay I remember I yeah so try to\ntry to catch every major event of your\nday and even small event so like\ngenerally speaking this meditation takes\nabout five to ten minutes okay so but I\nthink you've got a handle on it and then\nand so hopefully what this will do is\nlike empty out your trash a little bit\nokay cuz you're trying to unwind as you\ngo through the day you wind up emotions\nyou have all this stuff that kind of\nbuilds up and the our goal is to help\nyou like kind of unwind and start the\nday on peaceful but apparently you start\nthe day off tilt like you woke up and\nyou were tilted yeah like you opened\nyour eyes and like you were tilted about\nwhat um I ran over to the door to see if\nmax was awake and I walked out and I\nsaid so I think I just said to him so\nwhat the [ __ ] are we gonna do and I was\ntilted about an argument that I had\nyesterday\nexactly him with someone nice so you\nneed to process that from the day before\nusing a technique like this so that you\ndon't wake up in the morning tilt it you\nsee how like it's all like like it's\njust a cycle like it's oh it's a ball\nthat's rolling downhill it's like a\nlittle snow it's a snowflake that's\nbecoming a snowball which is becoming a\nnovel\nand so you've got to deal with your\nemotions from the day before so that you\nstart the day off like you're already\nencumbered\nyeah I'm pretty often starting the day\noff and I wake up tilton okay yeah so\nthen you gotta get so so process that\nstuff the day before as best as you can\nusing this technique okay okay\ndots or questions before we wrap up for\nthe day no okay strong work man very a\npleasure as always\nonce again yeah yes man get some sleep\ngo to sleep man\nno I gotta I gotta watch the new walking\nbed I only watch it for Jeffrey Dean\nMorgan okay I don't know who that is\nwhat I think it's a pretty famous actor\nah look man he's lazy\ndo you ever watch The Walking Dead yeah\nI've seen like the first three seasons\nfor [ __ ] okay he's negan if you know\nthat let me know don't leave me one\nsecond Jeffrey Dean Morgan what famous\nmovies 2cn uh he's in supernatural he's\nin Grey's Anatomy he's in PS I love you\nI know this guy you know he's an act I\nmean not personally he is just so low\ncarrying a show at this point oh wow\nokay yeah so he's the only reason I\nstill watch okay cool\nwell he's a villain turned Jesus you're\nkilling me man\nnow you're gonna tell me I'll let you\n[ __ ] man okay all right take care of and\ngood luck all right all right bye okay\nthanks so much bye\nall right chat see now see now you now\nI've made a big big mistake because now\nwhat I've done is tell chat that I don't\nlike spoilers and now chat knows my my\nsoft soft underbelly\nand they're gonna spoil everything on\nthe universe so I can't read chat\nanymore okay so I'm curious how\napplicable was what we were talking\nabout like did did you guys like did\ny'all resonate with anything that we\nwere talking about with LS okay\nI wasn't sure cuz he had so many things\ngoing on I wasn't quite sure like hooter\nlike yeah\nand yeah man sometimes I try to make\nthings a little bit more applicable but\nin LSE's case there's just a lot\nyeah the trash can part so that's\napplicable to everyone right so I think\nI think I want you guys to like really\nthink about this for a second you know\nif you have a bad day if you guys\nwatched crucifix stream that's a good\nexample of this where he's a guy who\nwould like get a job and then after one\nweek he would get frustrated and walk\nout the thing about like the the issue\nis usually not the terminal cause so if\nwe think about like in medicine if we\nthink about cancer right cancer doesn't\nstart with like when you notice like a\nlump like cancer starts with risk\nfactors so if you you know lung cancer\nlike if someone has lung cancer like\nthat starts with with smoking usually or\nif someone has colon cancer that can\nstart with diet or low fiber or things\nlike that so you guys really have to\nthink about the risk factors that lead\nup to you know how you're managing\nthings before you actually see what the\nproblem is\nif you feel horrible every time you wake\nup then you should start by doing this\ntechnique the night before"
