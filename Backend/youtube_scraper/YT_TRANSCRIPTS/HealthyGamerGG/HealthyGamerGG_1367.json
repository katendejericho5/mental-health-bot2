    "transcript": "okay so Mitch can you any any first of\nall any questions concerns about today\nlike any thoughts I'm good I'm good yeah\nno like I've I got no concerns man okay\nso can you can first of all thanks for\ncoming on again I yeah I was really\nexcited to actually talk to Hank it I\nthink the last time we spoke really\nhelped me in a lot of ways actually it\nmay be see things differently and I feel\nlike it helped other people see a side\nof me I don't quite normally show that\nmakes sense yeah so can you help me\nunderstand what you what you saw\ndifferently after our last session yeah\nI definitely took into consideration\nwhat you said about the thinking black\nand white so I've been trying to work on\nthat and not like look at those things\njust like set in stone like I used to\nlook at them so I'm trying to have more\nof an open mind with that good and I've\nactually been taken like steps sometimes\nmom do you know just feeling overwhelmed\nor whatever I'm just like alright I'm\njust gonna think in the moment just like\nchill whatever and I've been thinking\nlike a lot about different things I\nguess it's it's hard to explain it's\nlike my like true calling for like who I\nwant to be is kind of like surfacing if\nthat makes sense\nyeah that sounds awesome can you tell us\nabout that yeah I said I I I definitely\nthink like I like I'm like really in\nit's like health stuff right and I've\nbeen thinking maybe I could like\ntransition into like doing that somewhat\nand maybe monetizing it somehow I don't\nknow how but like sure no no just like\ndoing something different and like\nhaving other hobbies that aren't just\nlike you know waking up and you know\nwish streaming or whatever I've done for\nthe last like 10 years you know you have\nliving a little differently doing some\nnew things maybe being some new normal\npeople that aren't involved in twitch\nand like finding out maybe flying some\nsuccessful healthy relationships outside\nof this industry if that makes sense\nyeah okay so so it sounds like you're\nconsidering things that you kind of\nhadn't considered as seriously before\nyes definitely and I've always kind of\nconsidered these things I just\nnever really was like acting on them and\nnow I think that I will do that because\nyes yeah and and so Mitchell what do you\nthink so you felt do you feel happy um\nthat's that's a that's a hard question\nanswer uh happy in which I mean I don't\nfeel happy like I would do when I was 18\nI gave him no Fox about anything you\nknow I don't feel that way anymore but I\ndefinitely feel as though I want to keep\ngoing to see where I can get in this\ngame that we call life right like if I\ncould get myself to a place of a peace\nof mind or whatever it is the people who\nare searching for yeah yeah so I I think\nthe answer is no which i think is a good\nanswer and it's very appropriate yeah\nyeah I wouldn't say that I'm blissfully\nhappy now\nyeah and and so you know it's\ninteresting I I don't really have a good\nrecollection of a lot of what we talked\nabout there were a couple of things that\nreally kind of stuck in my mind\nhelp me understand you know what do you\nthink so you've been so twitch and the\ninternet have sort of described you as\nlike super super depressed and and kind\nof feeling it's it's super hard to\nexplain I guess how the internet views\nme and how like reality is you know what\nI mean yeah okay sure where would you\nlike to begin with the so so how do you\nthink you're viewed by the Internet um I\nthink the internet views me off of just\nlike past experiences I've had and like\npast things have happened because I've\nbeen very open with my community and the\nwhole internet my entire career right\nlike I've shared every relationship I've\nhad every girlfriend all that's in\npublic you know what I mean so there's\nlike there's been this like fine line of\nlike\nweird atmosphere about my relationships\nright cuz when everything's public it's\nvery hard to have like normal lives yeah\nyeah so I feel like people view me\nalmost like always for my worst moments\nand it's like people don't\nit's like strange like it feels like as\na public person you know if you ever\nhave like a bad moment that's gonna be\nremembered 10 times more than any good\nmoment that you have you know yeah so I\ntruly think that people have this bad\ntaste in mouth from one like like I've\nbeen through some [ __ ] and I lost my\nmind or whatever like years ago and I\nthink people don't let that [ __ ] go you\nknow and they just kind of hang on to\nthat and it makes me also like not be\nable to let it go as easy as I could\nbecause it just reminded a lot you know\nsure sure but yeah I say the Internet\ndefinitely views me as like depressed or\nlike maybe manic you know definitely\nvery messy I'm not consistent very\nuncoordinated those guys okay and and\ntell me about who I mean who who do you\nfeel you are I feel as though I honestly\nhave trouble pinpointing who I am cuz\nI'm always kind of flip-flopping like\nwhat I'm doing you know like I'm very\ninconsistent I'm very like impulsive and\nI just kind of like be like all I do\nthis for and I go hard for it for a\nwhile and then I stop and then so Who I\nam it's kind of almost based off of who\nI'm around and like what I'm working\ntoward yeah yeah yeah so I I think that\nthat's so that's not that's not really\nthe real you right so like like and and\nI think what you're noticing is that\nlike until we understand who we are like\nit's almost like Nate you know nature\nabhors a vacuum and so if you don't know\nwho you are you're gonna fill yourself\nup with the things around you\nmm-hmm and the people around you and the\ngoals like you become the goal because\nlike you you don't know who you kind of\nare on the inside yeah for sure and I\nthink with twitch I I get so carried\naway man with like the goal right\nI get so carried away to the point where\nI just put everything about my\nwell-being on hold and everything I do\nis for the sake of entertainment and I'm\nnot even living for myself I've done it\nfor years you know yeah I'm not saying\nI'm doing that right now cuz I'm kind of\nlike half and half right now but I've\nhad moments of my life where I'm just\nlike [ __ ] it I'm all-in with this you\nknow like this is everything I have it's\nall you know like it's just easy getting\nto the that thought process we're like\nOh like I'm you know a mid-20s dumbass\nwho dropped out of college like how else\nam I gonna make this kind of money\nunless I go all-in with this or how else\nam I gonna find the success again in my\nlife I probably won't write so it's it\nfeels is like I almost feel justified\nand just like going all in it that makes\nsense I think you're very justified in\nit so I'd like to dig into that for you\nbecause I think that that's not healthy\nbut I think it makes perfect sense\nbecause I think you know you you have to\ngo all in to compensate for everything\nelse right so your only chance of\nsuccess is if you go all-in and then I\nthink I think when you go all-in you\nalso become more of Mitch Jones and less\nof David and I have a very hard time\ndistinguishing the two of those people\nright like yeah so tell me about Mitch\nJones and tell me about David how are\nthey different\nwell I'm a very sensitive person I mean\nwho like deep down to my core I'm I'm\nvery empathetic and sensitive and people\ndon't really know that or see that\nbecause I just wash it off yep I I\nreally I have always been that way\ncuz uh I don't know why I'm just I've\nalways been that way\njust like super sensitive and super like\nI can like almost like I'm like so\nsocially in tune with things that like I\nit's so weird like mm-hmm\nit's just very strange I had this like\nsocial gift almost but I'm very bad at\neverything else like I'm it's really\nweird it's aw it's so so I'm just so\nweird I'm weird I'm really weird yeah\nyeah I I think when you say you're weird\nI think that's a function of you not\nreally understanding who you are it\ncould be it could be I just know that\nI'm bad at almost everything except\nunderstanding emotions like I have this\nlike way of understanding people I'm\njust like getting them without even like\nknowing they don't have to tell me [ __ ]\nI just know you know\nand it's like it's really weird how but\nyeah I don't show that I don't show that\never like I don't show my sensitive side\nor I try not to I have before right like\nthere's been times in the past where\nI've gotten very emotional in stream and\nI like it's always ends poorly you know\npeople were just like you know like it's\nvery weird you know you either get like\na reaction of like oh man or like you\njust get a reaction of like [ __ ] you\nthey just keep you know this add fuel to\nfire whatever okay yeah showing emotion\non twitch is almost always bad from what\nI've noticed what do you why do why do\nwe wall off things [ __ ] am i calling\nyou mixer David by the way I mean\nwhatever you want to call me I've gone\nby Mitch my whole life but what everyone\ncall me is fine\nyeah so um why don't we wall things off\nMitch um of total - who - like Twitter\nto everyone or like well in general why\ndo why do we put up cuz it it just it's\njust easier like I don't think that\nDavid would be a good streamer you know\nhe says yeah like I would be way too\nemotional I would I would always look at\nthings like in this weird I would I'd\nprobably just sit there and talk about\nkey to all day you know what I mean like\nI would literally just like be like oh\nI'm working on this I'm working on that\nlike no one gives a [ __ ] like they want\nto see content they want to see this\nlike thing this character this person\nwhatever like they just want that's what\nthat's what twitch is it's an\nentertainment platform you know what I\nmean I'd say 99% of the streamers on\nthis website are personified in some way\nyou know absolutely yeah so it's like to\njust like to distinguish that from\nreality is like annoying and it's also\nvery frustrating when I get judged\nindefinitely on Reddit and everywhere\nelse based off of like almost like a\ncharacter's yeah it's like I'm doing it\nfor entertainment but it's like people\nassume that that's just how I am so like\nI'll meet people in real life and\nthey're like oh you're not actually an\n[ __ ] and I'm like what like what is\nthat supposed to mean you don't I mean\nlike yeah what does that mean like I\ndon't understand\noh yeah like I haven't seen a lot\nactually and I'm just it's just\nconfusing so yeah what's confusing about\nthat that people misjudged me because\neven though in stream I don't even think\nI come off as that much of a dingus I\njust think I\nhave like a very bad like reputation I\nguess okay\nall right not even bad just like\ncontroversial like whatever you want to\nsay like something this is like a\nnegative spin on things\nyeah so what happens sometimes so can I\njust kind of share with you what I'm\nhearing try to tie this all things so\nlike I think you know this kind of goes\nback to first of all your your thinking\na little bit more about like fitness\nbecause it is such a big part of you or\nhealth it's it's part of the real you\nbut it's not a part of the persona that\nyou show the rest of the world oh if it\nwas me I would love to be a monk dude I\nwould love to just like meditate find my\ntrue peace of mind and just like somehow\njust live the simplest life everyone\nlike a farm like I swear I would love\nthat maybe maybe I get bored of it but\nfor now that sounds like really good why\ndo you why do you think that why don't\nwhy do you think that you can't live a\nsimple life in the circumstances that\nyou're in now because there's how how\nwould I do that I live like in a\nstreamer house I live in a cesspool of\nlike circles of different I mean maybe I\njust don't see how I what do you think\none does they have very peaceful eyes\nright what makes them peaceful\nI don't know I think it's they did they\ndon't do like they don't partaking like\nstressful things that would like stress\nthem out and their mind and body or\nwhatever right so you know that's kind\nof interesting I mean I think in a sense\nthat's absolutely correct\nso monks generally practice in isolation\nto protect themselves of the influences\nfrom the influences of the outside world\nthat sounds great and I also think that\nmost of the work that monks do has\nnothing to do with the outside world\nit's about the internal world yes\nthey're inside of their mind and body\nright absolutely so I think that while\nit's hard to become a monk in the\noutside world I absolutely think that\nyou can be a monk in the outside world\nso I'm going to share with you one of\nthe you know the goals that one of my\nteachers taught me which is to be in the\nworld but not of it hmm what does that\nmean to you\nit means you are just existing in this\nworld this world is not your existence\nsomething like that right absolutely\nwhat do you think about that I think\nthat's a very true statement and I think\nperiod people get carried away in their\nown egos and ideologies all the time\nwhen in reality they should just look at\nit like you know like exactly the way\nyou're saying like I feel like when you\nlook at things I don't know I don't know\nI don't really want to get too deep I\ndon't know I think you are so I'm saying\nright I do understand what you're saying\nwhat's your reluctance to get too deep\ninto it I don't know I'm just I'm not\nvery good at articulating words that\nsound correct so I just rather not say\nbig words or get into like I don't like\nideals of like inner mind and all this\nstuff you know yeah so what's wrong with\nwhat's wrong with you\nif you're not good at something what's\nwrong with doing it\nwell I'd say I'm not the sharpest tool\nin the shed right so when I do it on\nstreem and I just get backlash for it so\nI just would rather not\nso make sense yeah so but do you think\nyou're getting backlash now I'm not even\nreading chat but I just would rather not\ngo into like deep like I just know I've\ndone this before we're like I'll say\nsomething like five heads stuff or like\nthings that I believe are true and it's\nlike no one will ever take me serious so\nthere's almost no point me talking about\nthose things yeah can I think for a\nsecond sure\nso Mitch I think you don't let yourself\nbe you that could be I don't think you\nlet yourself be you at all because I\nthink you're afraid that if people see\nyou they're not gonna like it mm-hmm\nand somewhere along the way you started\nto need people's approval oh that's a\nhundred percent when I had people's\napproval and made me like this god mode\nstreamer like I remember like back in\nlike a 2015-16 like I had the most\nloving crazy loyal community and like\nevery whoa\neveryone if anything ever was bad said\nabout me it was immediately downloaded\nevery but like you know like I had a\ncrazy cool fan base and that [ __ ] like\nmaybe like fired ups like given like the\ngood content you know like and then one\nday that kind of all changed and it's\nlike flipped on its head and like I got\na shitload of hate and I didn't know how\nto deal with that so I just like got\nsuper depressed and I had this like it's\njust like changed everything\nbut the approval was like a dick ting\nman like I'm not gonna lie like when\nyou're getting like go go go go no no\nI'm saying what are you getting that\nlike positive reinforcement for\neverything you do it makes doing your\njob so easy you know yeah so I I think I\nthink getting all that positive\nreinforcement in a weird way was one of\nthe worst things that happened to you Oh\nhundred percent yeah I was literally the\nmost spoiled streamer for so long like I\ncould ditch for like months and come\nback and still maintain like eight\nthousand viewers and like this was like\nfive years ago you know what I mean and\nit was nuts like I could literally go on\nhiatuses and just come back and there\nwas just no one back then that like was\nas good as like entertaining or whatever\nat the time I mean people were way more\nentertainment in me now but I think back\nthen I had a good nishan like it's like\nwhatever I was doing I was doing I was\ndoing right you know what I mean yeah\nand it was so nice to have that positive\nreinforcement for so long so I think\nit's nice to have positive it's nice for\nanyone to have positive reinforcement\nbut I think that you it wasn't just\npositive reinforcement for you I think\nit was oxygen and water in life blood\nwhat the the reinforcement was that yeah\nThursday Oh 100%\nyeah no I fed off that so hard yeah and\nso then the question is why were you\nhungry\nwhere are you needed to feed off of that\nI don't know it's almost like I build my\nidentity around it at that point right\nlike oh absolutely so I think your your\nidentity started to build around that\nthat's when Mitch Jones was born oh yeah\nyeah and then you started to become an\nicon and I think the more that you\nbecame an icon and the more that you\nbecame the stage presence the more you\nlost to yourself because you've shared\nwith us that you you don't want to show\npeople parts of David because they're\nthey're looking for Mitch Jones and if\nyou show up as David you're gonna get\nnegative reinforcement and somewhere\nalong the way you became dependent upon\nboth the positive reinforcement and the\nnegative reinforcement and you sort of\nyour life became tied to twitches like\nimpression of you you're worth became\ntied to twitch his impression of you\nmm-hmm and even though the positive\nreinforcement sounds good I think both\nof these are dangerous situations\nbecause who you are becomes determined\nby how you view your viewed that's so\nthat's exactly how I feel man it's like\nI just wish you could have that moment\nin the Sun like forever no that's bad\nthat's so great that those moments are\nso good though man no that's not I was\nwriting this high for like years\nMitch that is not where I'm trying to\nlead you okay so I know and this has to\nbe understood like why why do I think\nthat that's bad because it's not there's\nno realistic longevity with that and\nplus it's building its building yourself\nup on a false narrative anyways right\nexactly yeah no I understand all of this\nit was a [ __ ] damn good time though\nman\nyeah I'm sure so I'm sure you'll get\nthere again too good no sex with a good\ntime boys good yeah that's good and I\nand this is really important so I want\nyou to like really think about this\nMitch where I I think that and this is\ntrue for everyone who's watching too\nyou know I think that\nwe sometimes want just the highs from\nlife but that's not how life works peace\nfrom life does it like so you think when\nyou envision just having like your\nmoment in the Sun Shine forever right\nthat's not actually how a monk lives a\nmonk doesn't live with a moment of\nsunshine forever they attained their\npeace but how do they do it through\nhonestly being alright with boredom and\nbeing already with mediocrity and all\nthose things like just being alright\nwith whatever is is and they're okay\nwith the exactly so if you crave your\nmoment in the Sun that's the problem\nit's the crazy you of me though I swear\nthere's like the one there's a decided\nme that doesn't crave that and I can\njust throw it all away and I've done it\nbefore and then there's a side of me\nthat always comes back so it's like I'm\nlike almost internally like struggling\nyep like so I desire so now we have to\nthink about where was that second Mitch\nborn the second Mitch Mitch Jones let's\nsay right okay so think about this Lorne\nwho needs who needs like so like I I\nmean I kind of have I'm trying to lead\nyou to this because I have a hypothesis\nabout this so here's let me just be more\ntransparent instead of like you know\nkind of lawyer your my way to it so you\nknow I I think that the something\ngenerally speaking people crave moments\nin the Sun when there's something about\nthemselves or their life that is just\nlike really really hard to accept or\ndeal with so you need twitch to like\nmake you feel good because there's\nsomething within you that doesn't make\nyou want to feel that doesn't make you\nfeel good and while David overall feels\ngood like I think you like to connect\nwith him but there's something about\nDavid that you want to run away from by\nbecoming Mitch Jones\nand if you want true peace the the way\nto get rid of the longing for permanent\nsunshine like you crave the highs of the\ngood years of twitch once again the way\nto get rid of that craving is to be\nsatisfied with who you are yeah no I\nagree I agree with that and I've done\nwork to do that but doing that at the\nsame time as twitch seems almost\nimpossible I think that that's really\nhard like imagine trying to like be this\nthing and then having to like it's like\nturn it off and all and always it's just\nlike exhaust yeah it's it sounds really\nhard I don't know if it's actually\npossible but so I think that's why I've\nalways taken long breaks from twitch and\nI'm just like okay I gotta find out who\nI am again and I find myself again and I\nlose myself again and I find myself\nagain it's like a cycle so when we think\nabout David's life what is it that that\nbothers you the most about David's life\n100% not being able to connect to anyone\nanyone that's the most thing like I\ncan't connect with any people I don't\ntrust anyone am I like there's just no\nway I can like make meaningful\nrelationships because I truly think that\nthe only reason people come into my life\nanyway is for Mitch Jones not for David\nso make sense yep so so forth it's super\nhard for me to make meaningful\nrelationships like super hard right and\nthat sucks and I feel like it's been\nalmost every girl I've dated almost\nevery person I've interacted with like\nit's just it's it's a really sad lonely\nexistence when you know that you're just\na piece of meat you know like you're not\nanybody else but a piece of meat you\nweren't always lonely you're right I had\nreal friends and a bunch of cool people\nthat I grew up with until those things\nfaded and then you know I kind of had to\ndive into this world that is like almost\nlike Hollywood 2.0 yeah so I think I\nthink what you've got to manage and I'm\nstill sort of beating around the bush\nyou know so so you kind of mentioned to\nme before that there there's someone\nthere there have been people in your\nlife or one person in particular\nwhose really like known you and accepted\nyou yes yes there's been a few like I\nstill have like one really close friend\nback home but we don't keep in touch\nthat much but he definitely understands\nme and like has connected to me on that\nlevel as well but it's like that and my\nmom how old you were how old were you\nwhen Mitch Jones was born uh I'd say\ntwenty-one okay how old were you when\nyour mom got sick hmm like 18 19 yeah it\ndepends on what you like I was always\nkind of like a laughing click like Mitch\nJones isn't like a completely\npersonified made-up thing like it's like\nthat's hat then I can get into that\nplace like just being myself you know\nbut it's like we need to force yourself\nto that place then it's almost like what\nis this you know like this makes perfect\nsense so I think that it is a piece of\nmy personality it's just like I'm\nsitting you have today we're sit out\nDavid was a clown yeah 100% I was it's\nalways been a crowd I think that's a\npart of who you are I think that's a\npart of your authentic self\nyeah for sure and my general hypothesis\nMitch just so I'll kind of lay it out is\nI think that you know I I think a lot of\nthis comes down to your mom I think a\nlot of it does as well and I there's\nnothing I can do about that though you\nknow that's that's already done I guess\nI can maybe like what kind of thinking\nis that I I don't know I don't know what\nI can do yeah so I can't change what\nhappened you know you can't change what\nhappened but yeah a lot of it does come\ndown to that how so cuz I just truly\nthink like she was like the rock in my\nlife that just kept everything okay and\nthen I've lost that and I had to like\nand I tried to like what are you doing\nmink I'm just randomly shifting tabs cuz\nHD I'm just being ADHD I don't think so\nyou haven't been doing that very much\nIII don't know yeah I just really\nfidgeting I don't know why absolutely I\ncompletely agree what changed in the\nlast 60 seconds\nI don't know I guess we started talking\nabout something that's bothering me\nabsolutely right so what does your mind\ndo when we talk about something that\nbothers you it wanders and you're right\nit's wandering it's like trying to avoid\nthat doesn't like it yeah absolutely and\nwhat's the what's the perfect way to\navoid it\nfidgeting around and so I think Mitch\nJones is the ultimate fidget oh so you\nthink if I become Mitch I don't have to\nnone of these things surface and I can\njust what I can just carry on yeah I\nthink that yeah I mean truth yes\ndefinitely coz like when I'm streaming I\ndon't think about this [ __ ] I'm just\nlike in the mode I'm in the mode you\nknow absolutely right and you want a\nzone so here's the thing about giving it\nyour all\nwhen you become Mitch Jones you give it\nyour all right it requires a hundred\npercent of you yeah and you can't give\nit a oh your all without forgetting\nabout things you can't hold on to your\nmom even 1% you can't be Mitch Jones if\nyou're thinking about her like you know\nthat you get the this sort of and I've\nno doubt that like the clown within you\nis like a genuine part of who you are\nand I think that that even Mitch Jones\nis like actually like a really authentic\nthere's like there's an authentic\nthere's a really pure piece of you in\nthere there's the guy that like got into\nyour mom's car without wearing any\nclothing like that's like that was you\nthat was the real you\nright yeah that's really who you are and\nyou show that part to the Internet and\nthat's why they love you because you're\nnot putting on an act I think you're\njust giving them a slice yeah yeah no\nthat's true I think I got popular in the\nfirst place just cuz I was a dumbass it\nwas like a good Meijin Wow you know yeah\nI wasn't like anything I wasn't I don't\nknow like I wasn't really trying it just\nkind of happened\nand then what's it happened I started\ntrying because like it got more\ncompetitive and stuff like that yeah\nyeah so I mean I think all that stuff is\ncool I think you know you've had a like\na rollercoaster of a streaming career Oh\n100% I've had some crazy highs and some\ncrazy lows like it's\nso really weird and I'm if it's okay\nwith you Mitch I'm gonna come back to\nyour mom yeah no problem because I think\nyou've got to be like I don't think\nyou'll ever be a whether you're a monk\nliving in a farm or you're here I don't\nthink you're gonna find peace until you\nlike sort of like process that and deal\nwith that and you kind of look at your\nlife and you say there's nothing I can\ndo about it but I in a sense that's true\nlike you can't cure her of what she has\nbut I think that there's a lot of work\nthere to be done and how how do you\nsuggest that I heal that pain I think we\nstart by facing it right we start by not\nfidgeting we start by not opening tabs\nand sitting with it and understanding\nwhat it is I think I've been facing it\nfor so long though like I mean every\nonce in a while I'll just like face it\nlike it's had just happens no matter\nwhat like yeah yeah and what happens\nwhen you face it I get super emotional\nand then I could and then I just try to\nget back to normal and then I carry on\nyeah so I think the mistake you're\nmaking is in trying to get back to\nnormal so I shouldn't know I mean I\nthink that's that's what monks do right\nso the monks don't try to get anywhere\nthey just let it all happen yeah right\nto accept what is I I think what you're\nmissing is actually grief\nso I think the\nof grief is like if I had to put like\nyou know I had to use a word to describe\nwhat you need to do it's grieving\nbecause grieving is how we you know you\ncan't like you can't change anything in\ngrief does that make sense and it's\nstill really really important to do like\nthere are bad things that happen and we\ncan't bring people back from the dead\nand I don't know if you I don't know if\nyou realize this but like I think in\nyour mind like they're like your mom is\nlike not really like she's gone yeah\nshe's definitely she's not gone\nper se it's just like she's not the\nperson that she was or it's very\ndifficult to watch someone deteriorate\nyou know it's just yeah it's almost the\nworst thing ever when you like see\nsomeone's personality like be stripped\nfrom them and their speech be stripped\ntheir movement be stripped it's it's\nit's honestly the most heartbreaking\nthing I've ever had to see in my life\nand like when I witness when I did every\ntime I fly home I truly just have a hard\ntime functioning because of how like\ndistraught and like upset and sad I feel\nand I hate those feelings I hate them I\nhate them so much they make me\nunfunctional and then if I come on like\nlet's say I want to stream that day I'll\ncome on Twitch and everyone knows and\nthey can see the weakness in me they\nthey see it you know and like twitches\nthey're very uh good at seeing weakness\nfor it and like I get I get picked I\ncould I get torn apart and quite frankly\nI'm I'm like terrified of like crying or\nlike those type of like deep emotions on\nstream I I get very much so [ __ ] on for\nyou know like I've done it on stream\nbefore and like I've it's just people\ncall me victim Jones or say I'm a [ __ ]\nor whatever it's like [ __ ] so I'm gonna\ndo something that if this feels\ninsensitive or mean to you please let me\nknow but you keep on moving back to\ntwitch in a way that your mom so I'm\ngonna keep you there so like you see\nthat like I'm done so so I think I\nshouldn't think about to whichever no no\nyou can think no no\ncan think about whatever you want to so\nit's gonna be my job to keep us on track\nand I'm asking for your permission to do\nso oh I I give you permission okay\nwhatever you want so that you let your\nmind do what it wants to that's actually\nokay so like that that's the reason\nyou're tossing to me is it's always bad\nthat I keep going back to the that's\nlike maybe my healing no yes and it's\nokay right because that's that's just\nthat that's exactly what I'm saying so\nlike you see how your mind is fidgeting\nso as you start opening tabs and then we\nkind of go back because like in a weird\nway your mind is comfortable with\ntalking about the pain of twitch that's\na roller coaster that your mind is\nactually completely fine with even\nthough it's painful you can talk about\nthat you can access that what's really\nhard for you to sit with is your mom and\nby the way I think the reason that you\nknow you kind of say but I've dealt with\nit before I faced it before and you know\nI'm like it's like I'm not healed yet\nand I think absolutely that's true and I\ndon't think that you've not faced it\nproperly I think like if we really think\nabout this I think you've done a good\njob of facing it but I think your\nsituation is actually like really really\nheartbreaking because it's going on\nright so like when I'm when my dad\npassed away eight years ago he was gone\nlike all at once and then I could grieve\nhim and move on with my life\nin a bizarre way compared to your\nsituation I'm lucky because what I'm\nhearing from you is like every time you\nsee her like another part of her like\nkind of withers away and she's still\nyour mom and you still love her and you\ncan see the parts that are there but\nlike there's you can't it's not like\nit's not talking about grieving once\nit's like grieving like a like again and\nagain and again like every single time\nand so I don't hold you like I don't\nblame you at all for not being able to\nmove past it because this is [ __ ]\nlike it's hard man it's like watching\nsomeone I mean she had brain cancer\nright yeah yeah I mean so I've seen this\nwith people who have like cancer yeah\nit's like it's just has so much man like\ntwo strokes two brain surgeries just\nlike I spent my okay I'm having trouble\nkeeping it cool that's fine this is why\nI just hate talking about this I hate it\nthese feelings are so painful man yeah\nand I'm just feels so [ __ ] unfair\nthat I just don't understand yeah\nbecause it is unfair dude and and there\nisn't there isn't and there isn't\nunderstanding yeah and I get really sad\nlike I see I see all these like people\nthat I live with and everyone they're\nlike such like loving parents and like\nfamilies and I just feel so [ __ ]\nlonely man like I feel so [ __ ] lost\nlike I don't even all I have is like\nthis is why like put all my chips and\nlike all I have is this thing I've built\ncuz I don't have anything to go back to\nyou know like I just my mom is not the\nsame she never will be my brother is at\nthis point in like some assisted living\nbecause I don't even know why the hell\nhe's there but he is and he's not doing\nwell and then my dad is just focused on\nhis work and I I don't know I just feel\nlike I'm super alone I don't have the\ntraditional like sense of love and\nfamily and any of that [ __ ] is it just\ndoesn't feel like so I feel lone in this\nworld feel very alone and I don't trust\nanyone and it sucks yeah so Mitch let me\nlet me explain something to you okay so\nI say this with love you feel alone in\nthis world because you are alone in this\nworld I don't want to be alone man I\ndon't want you to be alone either\nbut I I think it starts with like\nunderstanding where you are right and I\nand I think that unfortunately you have\nbeen dealt one of the shittiest hands\nthat life has to offer and and that's\nlike I don't know how else like I'm not\ntrying to like I feel like there's a\npart of me that thinks that I'm beating\nup on you but I mean that's just the\ntruth right because you had one person\nin your life and and she's like\nwithering away and you're watching it\nhappen in front of you what you're\ndealing with is not like depression I\nmean sure there may be depression there\nbut I I think like this is what we call\nlike complex trauma right so in\npsychiatry like you know I'm not\nsupposed to diagnose things over the\ninternet but like there's this like\ncorner merging like there's a difference\nbetween one event like so simple trauma\nis like if you get you know like let's\nsay you get sexually assaulted or\nsomething like that like that's pretty\nbad but then complex trauma is when you\nhave like a loved one who like\ncontinually abuses you like over the\ncourse of years and it's a completely\ndifferent animal it's not just\nstraight-up PTSD it's like deeper and\nwhat I see in you is someone who hasn't\nbeen like life hasn't like you know\nsucker-punched you once it's just like\nyou take a beating every time you kind\nof think about your life and your loved\nones and stuff like that and then\nthere's this other weird thing that's\nhappened is like in order to protect\nyourself from that\nMitch Jones rises from the ashes right\nwhich allows you to access just that\npart of you which is like beautiful and\nfunny and clowny and amazing and it's\nlike it's your moment in the sunshine\nbut that sunshine is born out of like\nyou stuffing other [ __ ] into the shadows\nlike Mitch Jones is in the spotlight in\nan order for Mitch Jones to be in the\nspotlight he's got a push David out of\nit and then David is along [ __ ] the\nabsolutely that's what you've been doing\nright yeah because you don't like being\nDavid because it's hard to be David and\nI get that man I really do in a sense I\nactually don't I have no idea because\nyou know I mean I've lost a parent\nbut you know I still have people in my\nlife who love me and I'm really really\ngrateful for that and I think in your\ncase like the tricky thing about Mitch\nJones is then no opening tabs stay with\nme\nthe tricky thing about Mitch Jones is\nthen you become Mitch Jones and then\nwhat's frustrating to you is that when\npeople meet you on the street you want\nthem to see David Wright when you meet\npeople in real life I want to be myself\nyeah I don't want to have to be this\nlike clowny thing that's like\nentertaining people all the time you\nknow so in a bizarre way it reinforces\nyour loneliness because those are the\nmoments where David can be seen those\nare the moments where like other people\ncan like you know get to know you and\nyou can start to form a real human\nconnection but instead all they see is\nMiss Jones yeah that's true\nI feel like Mitch Jones is the thing\nthat brings me any type of it's brought\nme everything I have like you know I\nmean like if I was just absolutely if I\nwas just if I was just if I just let\nmyself be like David the sad Khan\nwalking around I would just be another\ndepressed boomer who's broken lonely or\nwhatever absolutely right and that's\nwhat makes this really hard so\nunderstand this Mitch you have not\ngotten to this place because you're dumb\nyou've gotten to this place because your\nstrategy works really well\nMitch Jones is your savior and and he's\nwhat's holding you back right because\nhe's what he's what prevents exactly I'm\nliving in a tug of war constantly\nabsolutely how does that alive it feels\nit feels bad man it feels bad because I\ncan't just like focus on one yeah I have\nto do both yeah so so the problem here\nis that like it's not David and Mitch\nunder the spotlight it's like they take\nturns and there are times where you turn\noff Mitch Jones you go home and then you\nbecome David again and you don't like\nDavid so you start to like move away\nfrom him so I think that it's not that I\njust like David it's more of just like\nhaving to sit in that mental for a long\nperiod of time drags me into it so deep\nthat I can't get out like I'll just\nstart just like I'll start getting very\nlike\nantisocial and just doing like you know\nwhatever like just not productive things\nyou know so it's almost like it's better\nto just not let that person come out\nbecause it's almost always negative\nexactly so now I want what now let's\nunderstand that right so how can you\nheal if you never let that person out\nwhich kind of makes sense because if you\nlet that person out he takes over leads\nto like all kinds of bad [ __ ] happening\non stream you become less successful so\nI think what I would like to really help\nyou do Mitch is teach you how to let\nDavid out how to let those negative\nfeelings out without spiraling out of\ncontrol\nmm-hmm I I would like you to be able to\nbe yourself and feel those negative\nfeelings and then also to like you know\nit's kind of we're gonna open the closet\ndoor we're gonna take out something\nthat's disorganized we're gonna organize\na little bit and then put it back in the\ncloset mm-hmm because I I don't think\nthat you're gonna I mean this is not\nyou've a strategy that you have is like\nmaterialistically successful but I don't\nthink it's gonna lead you to peace oh\nit's not and and you've gotta I mean you\ncan't you can't live like this you know\nyou've gotta you've got to learn how to\ngrieve and and and process those\nfeelings and then also like the more\nthat you do that the less you have to be\nMitch Jones and the more that you can be\nlike the authentic clowny David who's\nlike kind of like Mitch Jones and then\nmy hope my real hope for you is that as\nyou become less of this like caricature\nof yourself that you can start to form\nlike really authentic connections with\npeople and then my real hope for you is\nthat like at the end of all of this you\nit's not about success it's about you\nnot being alone anymore that's really\nmore than anything else in the world I\nwant you to not I have a question for\nyou yeah you think it's best for me to\njust find like my peace of mind to be\nable to make connections and that's more\nimportant than like the success of my\ntwitch channel I'm asking you because\nlike yeah they almost don't go hand in\nhand like if I'm working on myself and\ndoing my own thing like that person\ncould be a bad boring streamer you know\nlike so so I don't accept your premise\nbecause I think that\nthe way that so previously when David\nused to come on Twitch it led to a bad\nstream I don't accept that that has to\nbe true going forward yes I agree I\nthink the maturing could be a good arc\nfor my thing and also I think you should\nbe your clowny [ __ ] self like I think\nyou should be what twitch loves you for\nbecause I think that's a real part of\nyou yeah for sure\nand I am I so overwhelmingly I've worked\nwith a lot of people Mitch and a lot of\npeople are afraid because they this is\nhow it like this is how life works where\npeople come up with all these weird\ncompensatory mechanisms like like you\nknow I'll just give you an example so I\nwas working with someone who whose dad\nthe one time that their dad ever said\nsomething good about them is when they\nwere a normal weight they got set to fat\ncamp and they lost stuff and were at\nlike the bottom end of like like below\nthat is like when they start to become\nanorexic and when they came back from\nfat camp the one nice thing they're\nthere their dad ever said to them is you\nlook good rest of the time it was like\nemotional abuse and judgement you're\n[ __ ] this up and you're doing that\nbad and things like that\nso one one time in her life was like she\never got positive feedback from her dad\nand so her desire to like meet her dad's\nexpectations caused her to like study so\nhard and work so hard and take care of\nher appearance where she became\nincredibly incredibly successful entered\nthe world of finance made like [ __ ] tons\nof money married someone who is equally\nambitious and rich and so her whole life\nis based off of like this track of\nsuccess which is rooted in you know not\nto oversimplify things but essentially\nlike a pattern it's not that she was\ntrying to make her dad happy it's that\nin order to make her dad happy she\nlearned a certain way of functioning\nwhich was giving it a hundred percent\nwhich was going all-in which is what you\ndo to when you go on stream and she's\nafraid that if she lets go of that\ninitial wound that all of the ambition\nand hard work is gonna go with it that's\na gray\nwe're putting it yeah that's that's\nspot-on that's exactly I feel yeah I\nfeel as though if I were to actually get\nmy [ __ ] together quote-unquote that\ncould ruin me yep because a lot of what\nthe appeal of my channel has been is\nhonestly it's it's a [ __ ] tornado you\nnever know what you're gonna get it\ncould be some craziness or whatever like\nit's just always something ridiculous\nright and like that's good content it is\nyou know and it's just like if it's just\nlike normal David like you know then\nthen then what like I don't I don't have\na college degree you know what I mean\nlike I don't know what I do yeah so I\nthink it's a very reasonable fear and I\nmean the reason I shared that story with\nyou is because I think you know it's a\nreasonable fear\nthe other interesting thing is you\nwouldn't fear that unless deep down you\nunderstood that these two things are\nconnected\nyeah does that make sense it does yeah\nso what do you think happened is is we\nstarted working as I started working\nwith this person and she started to feel\nmore confident in herself what do you\nthink happened I'd say that her wound\nslowly healed and she stayed successful\nabsolutely yeah in fact she became more\nsuccessful yeah I don't doubt it because\nthose ideals don't go away especially\nwhen they've been they've been like\nthere for that long so healing her\nwounds gonna only just make her more\npowerful in the end of it yeah but what\nwhat is healing your wounds gonna do\nMitch\nI mean potentially the same thing\nabsolutely so that's what I've seen time\nand time again mm-hmm well I would love\nto do that and honestly if I could like\nbecome a different entity to where like\nI don't have to you know exert myself so\nhard you know is it make sense\nabsolutely that would be great yeah I\nwould love that I would love to be\nrespected for not being like yeah like I\nused to be respected for like for\nexample for like being very good at\nWorld War Craft like that was nice like\nnot just being like oh it's that guy\nwho's controversial and whatever you\nknow it's it's way better to be known\nfor something being good at something\nthan this just be be known big to be\nknown somebody yes absolutely so you're\ntalking about kind of like Fame versus\nnotoriety right\nyeah it's like I want to be sown for\nactually being good at something not for\njust being some [ __ ] jackass clown\nwho hits on girls and cringes around you\nknow yeah so let's be I'm gonna teach\nyou kind of how to process your emotions\nin a second but let's just talk about\nsuccessive twitch screaming for a second\nokay so here's the thing to understand\nher psychological wounds when I'm\ntalking about my patient her\npsychological wounds and her\npsychological healing has nothing I mean\nin a sense it has something to do with\nher her success in her job but like\nbeing good at your job is about being\n[ __ ] good at your job yeah for sure\nso if you want to be a successful twitch\nstreamer you need to do the things that\nwill make you a successful twitch\nstreamer don't think for a moment in the\nsame way that all this deep dark hurt\nand stuff that hasn't really made you a\nsuccessful twitch streamer like you've\nsort of sniffed out and evolved into\nsomeone who's become a successful twitch\nstreamer and in the same way if you\nbelieve that healing this is gonna\nmagically make you more successful\nthat's not gonna happen either oh of\ncourse not it don't work it just makes\nyou lighter to be able to work harder\nright absolutely so I think your life\nwill improve but being a successful\ntwitch streamer is about doing the\nthings that make you a successful twitch\nstreamer and if that involves being I\nknow that I know that left and right gut\nyeah so the next thing is that you know\nI think they come to you because you're\nkind of this clowny person and stuff\nlike that and I think you should\ncontinue to channel that and also if\nthey come to you because you're a little\nbit of a tornado you should also do that\nbecause I think naturally you're a\nlittle bit of a tornado a hundred\npercent yeah right I love a little bit\nof spice in my life is yeah so so then\nI'd say continue doing that like right\nso you don't want to be you don't want\nto be like wholesome like you you don't\nwant to be like wholesome because that's\njust not who you are oh right yeah but\nbut you also don't want to be a [ __ ]\ntrain wreck who disappears for months at\na time and is like you know like I think\nit's fine to display than the\nbeen there and and there's something\nabout I think there's something about\nyou know you being able to smile and\nmake jokes and also from time to time\nshow that you're like you feel alone and\nstuff like that I think that's actually\nwhy you became successful because I\nthink that like you got to understand\nthat twitch chat is like broken right\nlike we're all broken we're all [ __ ]\nman we're all broken and so what we love\nto see is someone who can smile and\nenjoy their life and like still be\nsuccessful and kind of clown around\nbecause I'm so good at hiding it back in\nthe day man I swear disagree hundred\npercent Mitch I think all of them knew\nyou know they knew and you put on such a\ngood front that they thought they could\ndo that too they thought they could\nbecome Mitch but deep down they [ __ ]\nknew yeah it's all a matter of time so\nDavid comes out of office they knew and\nthe fact the fact that you hit it so\nwell is I think what gave them so much\nhope right because they didn't see it\nyeah but they knew deep down nature I\nthink they knew I swear to God I just\nwhen I watch this but I even felt it man\nlike the way I felt was I'm just like\nall right like I'm I'm doing it like\nwe're out here like I don't have any\nproblems like let's just positive\npositive positive like I just radiated\npositivity for so long so [ __ ] toxic\ndude that is so toxic is it yes just be\na positive ball of fun that's bad yeah\nbecause I mean that's you pushing David\ninto the shadows right so I think it's\nfine to be a positive ball of fun but I\nthink you have to give yourself space to\nbe negative yeah no but I've been\nnegative now for a long time so like you\nknow like it went from like polar ships\nlike I'm talking like super positive\neverything was good to like depressed\nawful terrible you know like I'm talking\nlike so bad both of those are wrong\nright so this is something so so now\nmake sure this is this is exactly like\nso last time we talked about black and\nwhite thinking why do you think I've\nbeen like pushing you with black and\nwhite thinking\nbecause it's pretty obvious that's what\nI do it's like always pull they're\nopposites there's no ground exactly yeah\nand the monk is the one who walks the\nmiddle ground I need to get to the monk\nmiddle man I need at the middle so this\nis how it starts okay\nokay I want you to sit up straight okay\nyeah do that for your good treat your\nback with a little bit of kindness oh\nyeah okay so so you're leaning back\nbecause you've got like a gaming chair\nokay this what I want you to scoot your\nchair back you know a little bit grab\none of your pillows and I want you to\nsit on one of your pillows and I want\nyou to sit don't lean back into

overwhelming so we're gonna\nstop okay okay okay okay PEP guppy\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nyou\nI apologize seriously I'm so sorry\nfor what I don't know I just I just I\njust I just apologize I feel as though I\ncan't control myself it's embarrassing\nyou know sure I can understand that it's\nembarrassing but why do you need to\ncontrol yourself I don't know so we\napologize\ngo ahead no no it's cool\nI just I don't want to come off as\nthough like I'm in pain or victim or any\nof that [ __ ] I just got it you know like\nit's bad like I can't do that what keeps\nyou from doing that it's not good I've\nbeen here I just I feel uncomfortable\nwith like I get ridiculed or like it's\nit's just I've it's just not good okay\nyou're so Mitch a couple of things to\njust think about okay so the first is\nthat if you want to have a conversation\noff of stream I think I'm open to that\nso you just let me know so think about\nthat okay okay you know it's it's\ntotally fine I just I feel like I'm\nbeing opened up and that's good it feels\ngood it really feels like I'm like free\nbad negative energy but at the same time\nlike I just I've been very much so like\n[ __ ] on in the past for like doing so\nyou know like I've had I've been to very\nnegative experiences in in sharing my\nsadness absence yeah I'm with you so I\nthink that let's let's move\nyeah you good you got that way why are\nthe dogs in here\nthat's no I think that's actually\nexactly what you need\nI think they sense something yeah the\ndogs are just rolling around\nI appreciate you more than you know and\nthis has nothing to do with you like\nit's not like I feel so this is very\ngood I just I just don't want to put\nmyself in a situation where I'm gonna be\nperfectly opened up to be like attacked\nyou know yep yeah so I think if that's\nbeen your experience let's respect that\nlet's respect those boundaries I think\nMitch I'm gonna help you pull out of\nthis okay okay you want to pull out of\nthis whatever you whatever whatever you\nthink is correct\nI'm I'm okay I'm just letting you know\nlike I just had I just overwhelming a\nlot a lot of things like hitting me at\nonce and it's yeah that's all you know I\ngot I'd like I'd like to explain to you\nintellectually what's going on within\nyou right now what do you think about\nthat I would I would like to yeah okay\nso this is gonna have the added benefit\nof as we engage our intellectual mind\nyour feelings hopefully will calm down a\nlittle bit okay so Mitch this [ __ ] is\nright beneath the surface this is a\nhigh-pressure situation does that make\nsense like all we have to do is calm\nyour mind a little bit and like all we\nhave to do is like like you know in this\nis kind of like you know poking a hole\nin a dam and then there's so much water\nthat like a little bit comes out like\nall we're trying to do is approach in a\ntiny tiny hole and instead of just like\none little trickle of water coming out\nthere's so much pressure back there that\nall of these feelings are coming out\nYeah right all we have to do so\nunderstand this when we start to\nmeditate which by the way you're gifted\nat when we start to meditate well you're\ngifted at you're good at it when we\nstart to meditate what happens is our\nmind becomes empty okay is our mind\nbecomes empty it becomes somewhat of a\nvacuum and whatever pressure is built up\nwithin us starts to fill that vacuum of\nthe mind so there are some ways that I\ncan trigger emotion in you by asking\ncertain questions right so I can\npointedly ask you about your mom and\nthat can trigger emotion but even\ntalking about your mom the emotion is\npretty manageable stay with me listen\nlisten you with me yeah\nstay with the intellectual okay yeah I'm\ntrying to I'm trying hard my emotions is\npoor and man I'm trying okay do you\nactually so then let me ask you do you\nthink we should just sit with those\nemotions for a little bit or would you\nlike me to try to kind of put it put a\nband-aid I was enjoying you yeah I was\nenjoying the band-aid okay good\nso let's continue with the painting so I\nthink this is just there's just a pile\nof emotions that's down there and it\ndoesn't take a whole lot of emptiness to\nlet those emotions out so oftentimes\npeople who meditate for like extended\nperiod like you know once you get good\nat meditation people have these kinds of\nlike emotional breakthroughs where like\nsomething deep that's buried within them\nlike kind of comes out and the deeper\nit's buried the better you have to get\nat meditation the more you have to empty\nyour mind in order to let that out does\nthat make sense\nyeah it does in your case either you're\nreally really good at meditating which I\ndo believe you're gifted in or it's not\nburied very deep does that make sense it\ndoes make sense yes so I am yeah so\nbuddy like I just don't think like like\nI'm gonna just say to simply you see how\nmuch emotion is in there you see all of\nthe stuff that's in there the misery the\nsadness the anger the aloneness all that\ncrap is in there there is no way like\nwhat you longed for is peace there is no\nway you can attain peace while that is\nthere\nyeah the good news so what happens if\nyou you cut yourself Mitch what happens\nto the wound heals overtime how does it\nknow to do that well I'd say white blood\ncells going to the area and get very\npresent and started working their magic\nand yeah so the cool thing about the\nhuman body is that wounds heal over time\nthat's just how we work it's [ __ ]\namazing all we have to do though is let\nthem right so in your case you've done\nsuch a good job at building up walls\naround this stuff where it's like you're\nnot letting your mental white blood\ncells like get to the wound and start\nthe process of healing it whether you\nbelieve it or not like so you felt an\noverwhelming amount of emotion and then\nyou described as feeling good and bite\nyou\nit's kind of weird like so that's\nactually the healing it's like\nunfortunately healing doesn't look like\nwhat it looks like and Wow\nyeah it doesn't which is just green\nnumbers and then your health bar goes up\nyeah there's even some manna biscuits\nnew yeah yeah unfortunately that's not\nhow it works I wish it was man yeah me\ntoo man\nI feel like emotional healing is so\ndifficult and tricky and hard to\nunderstand absolutely man absolutely\nit's so hard and and and but I I think\nif you feel a little bit lighter you\nknow you talked about feeling heavy in\nyour head how does your head feel now a\nlittle better I just know that I very\nmuch so suppressed like that could have\nbeen a full-blown like yeah like I felt\nso heavy like so many things wanted to\nexpress themselves and I just don't I\ndon't want to feel those right now so I\nknow that like yeah yeah so this is what\nI hate about twitch so normally what I\nlike about doing this kind of work so I\ndo this kind of work with people in my\noffice and then what we tend to do is\nthey they can't because it's also\nprivate and then what I'll do is I'll\nhug them so generally speaking is a\npsychiatrist it's a bad idea to touch\nyour patients because people say you\nshouldn't touch your patients some time\nago I couldn't help myself and I just\nstarted hugging people like I hugged my\npatients because I feel like that's\nreally what like what you need what you\nreally need in that moment and this is\nwhat I hate about twitch I was talking\nabout this at the beginning of the\nstream that twitch feels fundamentally\nunsatisfying to me because what you need\nin that moment is to be held yeah and\nthe dog sensed it then Tillich's they\nreally did and and what you really need\nin those moments is to let that out and\nto be held and to not be alone which\nlike I know that twitch chat is with us\nand you're not truly alone but like\nphysically and like oxytocin levels and\nstuff like that like you just need to be\nnot alone yeah is it weird that like\ntwitch to me feels like my my only\nfamily it feels like my only thing that\nlike I can truly just talk to and just\nlike vent and whatever no I don't think\nit is I think it was weird until I\nactually started looking at it for what\nit\nwas instead of judging it from like\nboomer perceptions yeah so like you know\nthe boomer generation we fundamentally\nbelieved that human connection cannot be\nattained over the Internet\nlike there was a time where like online\ndating was not the norm it was what the\nrejects did and it was like shameful\nthat like you met your your partner\nonline like cuz you couldn't find\nsomeone in real life so you had to like\nto be online dating where the weirdos\nhappen but now like online dating is the\nnorm and there are some ways I think I\nyou know you say this is the really this\nis what pisses me off if I could if I\ncould take one thought out of your mind\nit would be the one where I'm afraid to\ndo this because people are gonna attack\nme I believe I have a very so I think\nyour history with uh like I with like\nshowing emotion with which I guess that\nmakes sense yeah so so I understand why\nyou feel that way and I think that that\nis an appropriate and logical feeling\nand I also think that twitches your\nfamily and I think that's what's [ __ ]\nbeautiful about it is that like like\nwhat I have seen is like you know I mean\nI you know I'm I watched which I\nparticipate in twitch I enjoy myself a\ndank meme from meme from time to time\ntink means you know just like just\nreally dank it like cut the kind of\nstuff that you who you missed out in the\ngood times man I'm telling you\nthose were the dankest memes no dude\nwatch it which then of course man no\nyou're a dank meme err in the back of\nthe day\ndude the dankest like so look man I was\naround I was around I was around when\nmemes were born okay\noh shoot true boom like true boomer like\nall your base are belong to us like\npeople don't even know what that means\nanymore they don't understand this right\nyeah like yeah ah you you know yet that\nno I don't know what that is\nsee this is like you [ __ ] with Z\nnoobs like you guys don't know like like\nman so like this is like back when memes\nwere born man like buffle axe you guys\nknow what I'm talking about\ncome on twitch you guys know about\nokay so we're a little bit over our head\nor out of our league here yeah so one\nday we're gonna have to do dr. K does\nthe history of memes and I'm going to\nshow you guys the sweetest dankest most\noriginal memes oh well anyway so but I\nwas surrounding the good old days and I\nthink it's not weird right so Mitch what\nI want you to understand is that twitch\ncan be your family and and that's why I\nlike you know I on the one hand you're\nafraid of what they're gonna do to you\nbecause in the past they have hurt you\nbut just like a normal family sometimes\nthey do things that hurt you and\nsometimes they do things that make you\nfeel loved mm-hmm that's all it was a\nlot easier that's for sure yeah but it's\nit's not real though you know like I\nneed to find like things that actually\nground me that aren't I don't know I I\nwouldn't say that it's not real I just\ndon't think that it's enough like so\nsorry I I think that the what the vibes\nthat I feel over the Internet are\nactually genuine but it's just not\nenough oh yeah no I feel it for sure\nlike I told you I have like a weird\nempathetic side of myself and like when\nI can truly feel that like that like\nlove power from the internet it like\nshoots me to like being a normal person\nfor like a couple weeks it's weird\nokay it's really weird all right okay\nso Mitch so practically do you meditate\ndo I\nI do sometimes yes I don't practice it\nall the time but like there haven't it\ndepends on the phase I'm in in my life\nyou know but I definitely have gone\nyears where I meditate at least once or\ntwice a week so I'm a little bit\nhonestly I'm a little bit lost as to how\nto advise you so generally speaking what\nI so I think what you did today with\nthat little bit of meditation was\nactually really good for you and I think\nyou need to keep doing it I think the\nconcern that I have is that I'm not sure\nthat you have the enough of a guardrail\naround you to keep from like really that\ndam bursting\nso yeah but is the dam bursting you're\nlike very bad\nwell that's spillover in two days and\nweeks or I should I hope not but the\nshort answer is I don't know in your\ncase right so I think there's a lot of\nemotion that's right underneath the\nsurface and so my generally what I'll\ntell people is I'll tell them to like\npractice a certain kind of meditation or\nsomething like that in your case\nunfortunately I just don't know if\nthat's like really like safer handleable\nright now I would say that if you're\ninterested in trying again you should\nthink about finding another therapist\nbecause you only went once right yeah I\nwent to a therapist once and I didn't\nreally get very far with them either\nyeah so I would really consider it like\nadd that to your list of you know\nblueberries and other things like\nsmoothies and things that you do to take\ncare of yourself because I think you're\nin a slightly different place now and\nyou may be able to get more out of it\njust a thought the other thing is I\nthink you feel this stuff deeply in your\nbody do you exercise uh very uh\ninconsistently but do you go to do you\nhave access to a yoga class I've never\ndone yoga but I do stretch from time to\ntime I see you got it okay done you got\nto go to yoga I do massages and like\ndeep tissue stuff just like nah yoga\nnever Taichi no never no touchy\nokay so you got a do yoga or Tai Chi one\nof those two okay I think that's like\nwhere you get super hot and then they\nlike stretch we're hot it's not about\nstretching at all it's also not about\nheat it is about mind body so the goal\nof yoga is not about stretching it's\nabout to put yourself in a physical\nposture in which you're stable and also\nbrings the attention of the mind to the\npresent that's the goal of yoga so it's\na meta to meditative experience absolute\nso than like a physical one absolutely\nso it is a mind-body practice so it's\nwas really that sounds like it could be\nreally good for healing like stuff like\nthis it is really good for healing am i\ncry in front of all the Q yoga girls and\nstuff like I don't really want to\nno you won't do that you may do that at\nthe end but that's exactly what we want\nright and if you crying for the key yoga\ngirls you need to learn how to let\nyourself be David instead of Mitch in\nfront of the cute yoga girls it's hard I\nswear when you have an audience it's\nalmost like you just immediately want to\nlike feel like good because you know\nit's like it's like yes I'm professional\nor whatever it something's bad there's a\nbad snake but to it that's what we gotta\n[ __ ] fix in you man like I know it's\nhard but like yeah so go and instead of\nbeing watched by thousands of people on\nthe internet it's just gonna be half a\ndozen cute girls and guys it's like you\nprefer yeah so so just give it a shot\nand then the next time we talk like\nplease do it at least once or ideally\nthree times so that you can tell me or\ndo you want me to do yoga three times in\nthe next couple weeks\nyeah like ideally in the next week and\nthen you let me know you know if if part\nof the audience makes this harder for\nyou then you let me know and then we can\nalso talk you know uh you know not on\nstream but if if you know but I I think\nit's gonna be good for you as I\nappreciate that I well if you if you if\nwe could do both like on stream and off\nstream because there are things that are\nvery deep and like would almost like\ncome off as bias for sure on stream but\nI would have to talk to you about it\nsense yeah yeah so we can we can we can\nset up a you know some time but I think\nin the short term here's why I think\nyoga is better for you so like when we\ndo meditation it's a purely mental\npractice so all of the emotions come out\nYoga is gonna give you a chance to let\nsome of that stuff out like physically\nwithout it sort of like mentally rushing\nin and try it a couple of times and then\nwhen we check in next you can just tell\nme how it's going whether you like it or\nyou don't like it and I can try to give\nyou some other suggestions in terms of\nguidance I assumed that I will like it\nso I think you're gonna like it I do\nlike I like anything that's like like I\nlove like things like that like saunas\nand all the kind of stuff it's good free\nyeah\nand who knows maybe you'll make an\nauthentic human connection but don't\nexpect Asians it's so weird man like I'm\nso shy and like unwilling to talk to\npeople off stream but then as soon as\nthe cameras on I'm just like talking to\neveryone right like it's just yeah it's\nso weird like yeah you should see me off\nstream and I roll around like a\ndepressed person I don't talk to anyone\nlike I'm so different it's so strange I\nbelieve yeah literally so strange yeah\nthat's because twitch is a wonderful\ntwitch makes people feel comfortable\nright that's what's so beautiful about\nlike twitch in this community like I\nknow that okay and stuff like that but I\nthink there's something about you know\nbeing a shy person who has trouble\ntalking to people and like but like\nyou're one of us like it's about us yeah\nit's us right it's not about the normies\nwe just always been that way man twitch\nhas always been this like it's like\namazing community in this corner of the\ninternet this is like such like a like a\ntight-knit community you know yeah it's\nnot like YouTube or any other or like\nplatformers where it's just seems so\nlike spread out and like just not as\nlike me it's a not a family you know\nlike twitch feels like it's like they're\nthe boys they're like half these guys\nhave been riding with me since like 2011\nyou know what I mean like they've been\nwatching and like playing the same [ __ ]\nlike they it's just it's truly amazing\nlike what has actually happened if you\nlook at it like that you know yeah yeah\nwhich is cool yes I I really really\nrespect those people man like any of you\nguys that have been like oh geez\nand like I've seen the ups and downs and\nall that stuff like I appreciate you\nguys man and I could truly you mean a\nlot to me man\nand like without you guys I probably\nwouldn't I'd be [ __ ] let's just say\nthat I wouldn't be I wouldn't have had\nany outlet for all my selfish\none last thing I'll leave you with okay\nso this is gotta mom yeah so in my mocha\nso I think that life has dealt you a\nvery crappy hand but you've got a couple\nof aces in there\nyou are alive at the right time right\nlike this didn't happened to you like 30\nyears ago before there was twitch and\nWow and before you could be a good mage\nlike we are alive today yeah like we're\nbeing a good mage involved Dungeons &\nDragons which is amazing and I love but\nalso it's like you know so like like I I\nthink that you know it's my firm belief\nand this may be a belief that's out of\nfear that life gives us challenges and\nsometimes life gives us a lot of like\nshitty stuff but life also gives us the\ncapacity like gives us the tools to do\nwhat we need to to like overcome the\nchallenges that we face so sure you you\ncan feel alone because of your brother\nand your mom and your dad and stuff like\nthat and also you happen to be alive at\na time where they're like thousands of\npeople who can be your virtual family\nand do genuinely care about you yeah and\nand so it's kind of like weird and so\nit's our job to sort of you know not\nlove I mean we can be upset about oh you\nknow it's unfortunate if this happened\nabsolutely you're allowed to be upset\nand grief and stuff like that but like\nlike it's not about black and white\nright it's not that you're [ __ ] or\nthat you're lucky it's that both of\nthose things are true at the same time\nmm-hmm\nthat there's David and there's Mitch and\nMitch is like this glorious guy who's\nlike you know doing this stuff on on\nTwitch and then there's David who's kind\nof like you know when he shows up like\ntwitch doesn't like it and stuff like\nthat it's about putting it all together\nit's about like being a whole person and\nunderstanding there are parts of your\nlife that suck and there are things\nabout your life that you're really\ngrateful for and it's been really\nawesome to hear you express genuine\nappreciation for the person that you are\nin your circumstances and also to beas\nlikes to see you be so at the same time\nlike broken because of like how messed\nup your life is and how alone you are\nthat you can be both of those things at\nthe same time and that's really what\nlife is and the goal of becoming a monk\nis to be able to sit with both of those\nthings that's where peace comes from\nit's not the sunlight it's not the\nshadow it's Twilight\nright by Stephenie Meyer and that's what\nI want to help you do right it's it's to\nface the bad and accept the good like\nboth of them it's not either/or it's not\nbeing perfect it's not about being\nsuccessful it's about the highs and the\nlows that's what life is\nmm-hmm and that's the journey that like\neveryone wants to see because that's the\njourney that they can relate to\ngood breath good sigh thoughts questions\nno I I really think talking to you is a\nnext-level experience for me I've never\nactually had any type of therapy that's\ndone really anything for me\nand it's very strange to give someone\nelse full control over like your\nemotions like I feel like you could just\nlike give me like a weird pressure point\nand just drop me and render me useless\nfor a week like I don't know yeah so the\nreason this works really well is because\nyou know display it's not therapy\nokay and secondly one of my teachers\nonce told me that I should use my power\nfor good and not evil yeah well you make\nme realize things that I kind of already\nknew but it's like you just like make it\nso right there in my face I have to like\nsee it you know yeah yeah that's what\nI'm here for and I also had one more\nquestion yeah before we go try soive how\nwhat is the best way of dealing with\nlike negativity and like people that are\njust negative right\nlike I really struggle with this because\nI always have this like weird righteous\nway of like wanting like the truth or\nlike you know karma or whatever you want\nto call it right like I get carried up\nin these dumb little mind games with\nlike irrelevant situations and I'm\nwondering how you would go about that\nyeah so I've got kind of a weird you\nknow nature analogy because we're\ntalking about meditation and stuff so\nwhat I'm what I'm envisioning is a\ngigantic wave or a wave that's hitting\nyou right that's their negativity you're\nthere's kind of there's a kind of like\nswept up Ness does that make sense to\nwhat you're describing\nso how do you withstand a wave you just\ndive through it you can dive through it\nabsolutely that's not what I was\nthinking but that does work that's what\nI do yeah so I think it in my case like\nI just have my feet on the ground just\nlet it hit you yeah absolutely right so\ndive through it let it pass through you\nlet it let it get past you like the\nimportant thing is to be stable within\nyourself so I think one thing is that if\nyou engage with them it doesn't work\nwell right that's like trying to push\nthe wave away yeah I have this weird\nthing where I just get so like I want to\nlike engage and I want to like I want to\nlike show them that they're wrong you\nknow yes it's so toxic so that's that's\nego right so you want to convince them\nthat they're wrong what you need to do\nis dive through it yeah so you need to\nmove past them not like don't try to\nstop the wave don't try to fight the way\nbecause that doesn't work hmm\nthe other way to think about it is like\nyou know how do you get like if I have a\nbucket of water or like let's say I have\nlike a bathtub like how do I get the\nwater to be still and calm down if it's\nlike display\nlike splish-splash late times absolutely\nright so the more that you try to like\nif I try to force all the waves down if\nI like see a wave I'm like no you stay\nstill this water needs to say so this\nwater needs to say and that's what you\ndo you engage with them hmm\nand then it's like trying to force water\nto be still yes did your analogies are\nalways spot on it I'll understand yeah\nso so what you let them do is let it\nwash over you so like understand that if\nyou want to show them that something if\nyou want to show them ah that's coming\nfrom you it's not actually coming from\nthem they're hitting a chord with you\nthat you don't want to be true mm-hmm\nright so like some people have\ncriticized me and I think the best way\nto handle criticism is to accept it\npeople like yeah I'm cool with criticism\nI get more so annoyed with like certain\npeople that have just like super like I\ncould get into it so that's a lot but I\nhave this weird thing that like attracts\nme to like negativity and like it's like\nit's like a continuing theme in my life\nso at Canter's yeah so I mean I'd say as\nbest as you can dive through it right so\nlet it wash over you like those people\nare negative so take stock and kind of\nwho you are and like understand that you\ncan't convince someone so like Mitch you\nknow so you were earlier saying how what\nI do is special and helpful right yeah\nam I trying to convince you of anything\nno I don't think so I think you're just\nreally learning yeah but how are you\nlearning without me convincing you of\nanything cuz you're unlocking the\nknowledge that's already there okay so I\nthink that's kind of the approach that\nyou've got to take for that right\nwhether they want to see what is there\nis up to them you can help them along\nbut if they're in a place where they\ndon't want to see it you've got to like\nlet that move past you let them wash\nover you\nhmm I understand that trolls are gonna\nbe trolls like that's what like you know\nyou can't like that's what's gonna\nhappen but you can't change a trolls\nmind like they have to want to learn\nand overtime like the people that you\ncan engage with I think it's about ego\nand stuff like that I think this is\nactually worth like kind of a full\nconversation so if we know I would love\nto dive into this yeah because so I\nthink they'd be dealing with negativity\nfrom other people and sort of this idea\nthat you want to show them and teach\nthem like how it is and like oh yeah\nlike yeah I have this weird like\nself-righteous like this thing in me\nwhere I'm just like I have to prove them\nwrong you know yeah I know I'm right I\nknow I'm right and like yeah I just and\nI just get so [ __ ] carried away with\nthat I ended up being losing myself in\nthose kind of situations as well you\nknow yeah it's it's a really common\nproblem especially like I don't know if\nyou've used this thing called the\ninternet but it's full of people that\nself-righteous and right and want to\nshow other people how they're wrong yeah\nI mean it's you know I check out the\ninternet because there are people who\nare full of that thing there mmm-hmm\nthere there's like they're these so that\nthe Internet has all these different\nwebsites but they're basically all the\nsame so like there's this website called\nYouTube that has videos and people argue\nwith each other about who's right and\nthen there's this website called reddit\nwhere they post something so they post a\nlink and then like right beneath it they\nargue about who's right and and they're\njust basically lots of these things\ncalled websites and they're all about\narguing you even have like reviews of\nlike restaurants where they argue with\neach other about whether the food is\ngood or the food is bad and so it's it's\nI mean there's a whole you know billions\nof people out there who are just like\nyou and trying to teach everyone that\nthey're wrong and we're self-righteous\nso you know we could talk about it next\ntime but I think it it you know in short\nas best as you can try to implement that\nimagery of just like dive through it\nyeah like the monk wouldn't care right\nlike the monk would just like let it\nhappen not get on developed in like my\nown ego of like trying to like prove\nsomeone wrong or whatever it doesn't\nmatter in the end of the day right like\nso I'll leave you with one last thought\nokay so yeah when you can when you\nshould convince someone is when you were\nrighteous but you are not talking about\nbeing righteous you were talking about\nbeing self-righteous\nso that's ego okay so like what is\nrighteous that's when you're completely\nunbiased looking at something right\nthat's what it's not about you it's\nabout them or about it it's about\nservice\nit's about righteousness to do what is\nright yes but I think what you are\ntalking about use the right word because\nI think you're yourself right just\nthat's about ego this is so should you\ntry to convince other people of things\nabsolutely I mean that I spend a lot of\nmy time doing that but I do so when when\nI actually am when my cause is just and\nit's not about me it's about that okay\nright so if you're like oh yeah just\nlike okay that makes sense for sure so\nlike what if you're like so certain like\nyou can teach people like you can teach\nsomeone like are you like no you're\nright right like you're like so sure of\nit\nthat's still self righteous right no not\nnecessarily so I think the issue is\nabout like what's important to you are\nyou serving a cause are you trying to\nprove them wrong and prove you right a\nlittle bit of both yeah so I think that\nneeds to be separated because I do think\nthat like you know sometimes I'll I mean\nsometimes I'll take a hard line with\npeople mm-hmm and you know I tend to be\nnice on stream and usually I'm a nice\nguy but sometimes if my blood gets up\nand I think that there's injustice being\ndone I will use my power to destroy\nothers that's kind of how I feel yeah\nand I think that that's okay okay\nI you know I I think it's hard so you\nhave to have your ego in check and in\nyour case I don't think yours is very\nhealthy right now so yeah yeah for sure\nall right well thank you dr. kay okay\nshe am in you're very welcome Mitch\nstrong word today I'm yeah definitely\ndefinitely you are yeah definitely again\nsome work with whatever the hell is\ngoing on good but I were to take care of\nI appreciate it I appreciate it have a\ngood one man you too\nokay so that was fun I really enjoy\ntalking to Mitch yeah no I'm not gonna\nknow so this is the thing right so like\nif you actually think about it like\nseeing into people's emotions we just\ngot it I gotta clear the air here so\nright so like seeing into people's\nemotions and understanding who they are\nis also like what's used by like super\nsuper toxic narcissistic people like\nwhen you get someone who can understand\nthings and is like narcissus and\npredatory they like destroy people so\nyou know but sometimes I think if like\nthere's injustice being done in the\nworld like you should like you know you\nshould stand up and fight and do what\nyou want like to do what's right\nand help other people okay so guys this\nis fun what we're gonna do I just want\nto thank everyone for coming on again\nand watching Mitch I think you know I\nhope some of that stuff was resonating\nwith y'all you know I think a lot of the\nstuff that Mitch struggles with is\nactually true for a lot of people right\nso like we wall off our emotions so a\ncouple takeaways when we have hurt we\ntend to wall it off and create like a\nversion of ourselves we create like this\ncharacter and we try to be that\ncharacter because being that character\nis better than like being like the hurt\nversion but the goal is to actually take\nthose walls down and like let that hurt\nout and process it so you can be free of\nit\nbecause the thing about walling off your\nnegative emotions is it's like you're\nencumbered like you know like what you\nguys know like in an RPG when I don't\nknow if this hasn't happen and Wow\nbecause you're like capped by space but\nyou know some like RPGs will have\nencumbrance so you can be like way down\nand it gives you a movement penalty and\nthat's what walled-off emotions are like\nit's like you're feeling like way down\nand sure you can still play the game but\nit's like kind of hard\nyeah your your can't fast travel like\nyou're just gimped in some way right so\nthe goal is to actually be like a\ncomplete person and a being a complete\nperson is about letting all that\nnegativity out and kind of dealing with\nit and accepting it and then you'll kind\nof feel better about yourself you'll be\nmore at peace like that's where peace\ncomes from and understand that peace is\ndifferent from fun so Mitch has done is\nhe's walled all that off and then like\nin order to compensate for the negative\nemotions he rides highs right like he's\nlike super super fun and clowny and all\nthat kind of stuff so he like has this\ninflated positivity to kind of balance\nout that like walled off negativity when\ninstead what you want is to like\nactually have both of those kind of\nthings be there at the same time sex\nsweet and savory and spicy"
