    "transcript": "so can we just start by doing\nintroductions again sounds good to me\nyou're gonna start off Richard yeah sure\nso my name is Richard I was on the\nprevious stream so I was going strong\nfor about ten days and unfortunately\nI've relapse yesterday was which I was\npretty bummed about maybe we can talk\nabout that today and it's it was kind of\nI don't know I I was pretty visibly\nupset with myself because I thought of\nthis great opportunity to come on stream\nand you know kind of talk about porn\naddiction and I thought like I tried to\nkind of rearrange it in my head to where\nlike I changed it from like a self\ndevoted interest to stop watching porn\ninto like kind of like a group Dharma\nkind of thing I kind of made it like my\nresponsibility to kind of step up and\nquit this addiction for like everyone\nwatching and to show everyone that's\npossible and I was I was kind of hurt\nwhen I figured out you know I'm only\nhuman and I just really left so I don't\nknow maybe we can get into that and some\nof the people were able to go strong the\nwhole time so I'm interested to hear\ntheir kind of techniques and how they\ndid that so yeah so welcome back Richard\nthank you\nwho wants to go next\nI guess I'll go next\noh my name is bear and I'm new to the\nstream yeah welcome bear thank you it's\na pleasure to be here it's an honor so I\nwatched the first stream and I couldn't\nrelate because I again to little\nperiodic episodes where I get into\nanalysis paralysis okay and I ended up\nturning to masturbation and gaming to\nkind of like\nwork my way through\nokay rather than it just being like\ntrauma yes okay so you said that you had\ndifficulty relating and you feel like\nmasturbation for you is is like tied up\nto like other other sort of cognitive\nthings as opposed to some kind of trauma\nyes\nokay okay so we can definitely talk\nabout that thanks for coming on man also\nhuge props to you know your gigantic\nballs for showing your face on a stream\nlike this they I'm nervous man yeah man\nI think I think we're all nervous who's\nnervous show hands okay so who else\nwants to go wants to introduce\nthemselves the cat in the corner you\ngotta go person now okay all right I'll\ngo I guess go for us I'm ghosts probably\nknow if you know me from the last stream\nglad to be back I think this will be\ninteresting\nyeah I hope so\nI'm Erin I was also on the live stream\nand I guess I hope that we get to cover\nsome extra bits that we didn't get to\nlast stream absolutely anything in\nparticular that I think you want to talk\nabout today um I'd like to just like\nfirst maybe catch up and reiterate on\nbriefly reiterate on so many things that\nwe touched on last time sure then maybe\na little bit more on like specifically\nrelationships okay that's great we did\ngorge on relationships at all that's a\ngood idea yeah yeah okay a fantastic\nidea great suggestions there and so I\nthink we have one other person in the\nchat\ndo you want to introduce yourself\nTony X Tony Communications mic issues\nokay oh all right so we'll see if if we\ncan get Tony to rejoin okay so um so I\nthink all fantastic ideas Aaron do you\nwant to just start by use kind of\nmentioned that you wanted to reiterate a\ncouple of things do you want to just\ntake a stab at that what would you what\ndo you think it's important to reiterate\num I think it's just because yeah this\npast week since the last dream I tried\nonce again to quit the yes resist the\naddiction and I tried a different\napproach this time where I just like\nRichard said instead of focusing on\nmyself and the benefits that would get\nto myself I thought more about the\nothers that uh we talked with before and\neveryone that has been like sending\nmessages through the discord or the\ntwitch chat saying how much it helped\nthem how much they could relate to it or\nmaybe they had some other issue like\nthere and there's just more like that\ncompanionship that sort of bond hanging\non to that almost like it was almost\nlike gripping on to a log while flowing\ndown a river and the river is like the\nurge is just continually splashing on\nyou go as long as you have that float\nyou can sort of barely stay above the\nsurface until you get to dry land\nthat's actually some really scary\nimagery I mean because I you know it's\nnot it's not like a life raft it's like\na log right it's so unstable the river\nis just pounding you and it's kind of\nlike you're holding out and I'm not even\nsure that success is guaranteed at the\nend like that sounds like you know\nfailure is more inevitable than success\nis that how it feels to you oh yeah yeah\nfor sure\nI'm expecting relapse at some point or\nanother just because it's happened to me\nso many times because I've tried\nsometimes over the years but I'm going\nto give it a very strong effort this\ntime and now that I have like being more\nopen about it and having like\ncompanionship with it it's made it a\nlittle bit easier but it's still of\ncourse extremely extremely challenging\nyeah so I'd like to just offer up\nanother topic for discussion well I mean\nwhen I say another I mean I think\nRichard sort of mentioned this already\nbut I think we should really talk about\nthis idea of relapse and quitting and\nand you know what is it what is our goal\nhere and what does it mean to have these\nexpectations for yourself and now that\nyou're sort of putting is Richard kind\nof mentioned you know there's sort of a\ngroup Dharma here so like your success\nor failure no longer just depends on you\nbecause people are this is gonna sound\nbizarre so that this dream is gonna be\nfull of like things that can be taken\nout of context so people are watching\nyou not fapping right let's go people\npeople are watching you and now you have\nan expectation to fulfill towards like\nother people to kind of inspire them and\nI think so I'd like to talk about that\nand just what kind of pressure that puts\non you what kind of pressure relapse\nputs on you what kind of pressure the\ninevitability of relapse puts on you how\nthat pressure actually affects you\ncognitively and does that actually like\nyou know how does that affect how does\nthe pressure of possibly relapsing\naffect you relapsing or not relapsing\nRichard um yeah I I kind of want to take\nit on like I really want to put it on to\nmyself and because I want to get rid of\nthis and I'd love to have the support of\neveryone here and everyone watching and\nI know I do it's just it's it's just\ndifficult and but I want to take that on\nI just I kind of like almost like in a\nsuperhero sense like yeah take take it\non and like give it everything I can try\nlike just die trying I don't that just\nseems so admirable to me and I'd love to\nbe a part of that but there's also you\nknow if like relapse comes then it just\nlike it comes to this point where it's\nlike oh Jesus Christ the superhero kind\nof like failed the world he wasn't able\nto save the world which is kind of scary\nbut at the same time I want to take it\non and that's kind of what I signed up\nfor joining the stream so I'm I'm ready\nfor it it's just the the stakes are\nhigher now yeah so how so the everyone's\ncounting on me\neveryone's counting on me to do that so\nlet's talk about being a superhero okay\nwhat help me understand or help us\nunderstand and you know anyone can jump\nin by the way it sort of it resonates\nwith me that Richard is kind of talking\nabout doing something superhuman right\nlike there's like there's like a part of\nus that strives to like overcome and\nachieve and be greater than what we are\nand is that does that like does the idea\nof becoming a superhero like no fat man\nyou know yeah yeah yeah that superhero\nit's actually funny because my Dischord\nname is Oh Superman so I've always been\na fan of Superman\nbeing able to like just achieve great\nthings so uh how are you gonna come to\nthis idea that like I'm only human and I\ncan't be a superhero or like I don't\nknow what would I get am I putting\nmy expectations too high for myself\nbeing like trying to strive for\nlike a superhero istic goal why don't\nyou ask your colleagues what do you guys\nthink what do y'all think about becoming\na superhero and is Richard putting too\nhigh of an expectation on himself I\nthink it's a lot of pressure I think\nit's a double-edged sword yeah going\nyeah it's a fine line to walk because\nthe more pressure you put on yourself\nwhen or if you do crack it or to\ncontinue forward because you're gonna\nfall that much farther so yeah we are\nunder a lot of pressure taking this on\nand it's scary but it is at the same\ntime the pressure facing that pressure I\ncan see what you mean by like it's\nalmost uplifting and that when you do\ntriumph over like a really bad day where\nyour urges are like intense and you just\nbarely manage to make it through it's\nvery empowering and so it's it's kind of\ndifficult to navigate that fine line of\nlike not putting too much pressure on\nyourself to where you can still like\nfunction but you still want to like not\njust given all the way what did you mean\nby double-edged sword ghosts I meant\nthat it's in a sense can be seen as a\npositive because the so of group dynamic\nmeans that people are relying on you so\nyou feel like there's some element of\nobligation it reminds me of what you\nsaid about Dharma and it's hard to clean\nyour own room but when someone else\nneeds their own cleaned you can do at\nthe drop of a hat\nit's like it's kind of in a sense easier\nwhen there are people counting on you\nbut also there is that overwhelming\npressure that makes it more difficult\nwhat do you think about what they have\nto say Richard uh matches yeah I would\nagree with them no you said something\nyou kind of like sort of tried to put\nyourself in my shoes for a moment you\nsaid are you gonna say something like\nwe're all just normal human like do you\nremember you made those defensive\ndeflective statement yeah what was that\nstatement let's let's understand that\nfor a second do you got you guys all\nheard that yeah I don't know I guess we\ncan kind of go into my dad sets really\nhigh expectations I\nhe really has a big relationship with\nword and if I say something I got to do\nit and and I've always had you know\nmotivation problems sometimes when I say\nI'm gonna you know an example would be\nlike if I say I'm gonna paint the garage\nand I paint the garage but I don't\ncomplete it all the way by the time I\nsaid I was gonna do it there's just like\na big disconnect there's I just get a\nlot of flack from him for that he just\ndoesn't like it mm-hmm\nand and when you fail after ten days\nwhat do you get from yourself\num just disappointment you get a lot of\nflack from yourself a lot of [ __ ] yeah\nwhere do you think you learned how to do\nthat\nit's gotta come from them right like\nthink about that for a second so when we\nbeat ourselves up and I'm sure you guys\na beat yourselves up how do you let's\ntalk about that like how do you beat\nyourself up\nI caught a grin from bear well I like to\nget stuck in my own head so that's a\nreally big thing for me and my conduct\ncoping mechanism I guess would be\nmasturbation and you know video games or\njust trying to find something to to\nclear my head and what happens when you\nget stuck in your own head I get this\nfeeling of being really overwhelmed and\njust don't really know what to do with\nmy I guess what is it that overwhelms\nyou ah just general thoughts I guess\nmore recently I've been in the Nene\nstage since I just graduated and\ngraduations I'm graduating thank you you\nthank you better than drop it out it's\neasier yourself up for graduating and\nthen you know not having a job or\nwhatever but then like it's also easy to\njust forget that you at least you\ngraduated but a lot of people actually\ndon't that's true that's true I also\nhave like a lot of pressure from my\nfriends and my family for for not being\nwhere I should be I'm like I'm a little\nbehind in terms of my age versus\ngraduation than jobs and and all that\nyeah okay I saw I saw that Tony managed\nto connect but it seems that he is fled\nso maybe if we if we can catch him we'll\ngive him a chance to introduce himself\nit's how we going to get an evil cap so\nI want to just pause for a second\nbecause I have a feeling that we could\nbe talking about a lot of things that\ndon't relate to porn addiction I think\nwhat you guys are talking about we could\nsort of take things in a slightly\ndifferent direction so I'll just sort of\nmention a couple of themes that I'm\nhearing right so the the need the want\nto be great sort of the need to be great\nand I think that has something to do\nwith the sense of you know only a soup\nbecause because when you guys are when I\nimagine the image that Aaron was\ndescribing which is like you know you're\nhanging on to a log in a rushing river\nand you know like you're barely staying\nafloat and you're you're gonna drown\nlike when I think about that scenario I\ndon't think a normal human can fix that\nright I think you have to be a superhero\nto fix that and I think part of sort of\nthe call to be a superheroes because of\nour perception about how insurmountable\nour problems are like it feels super\nlike when I think about how like how is\nAaron gonna get saved like literally\nSuperman is gonna fly out of the sky and\nlike scoop him out of the walk that's\nwhat's gonna happen right that's that's\nhow he gets it because there's a\nwaterfall and he's gonna about to go\nover the edge and there are rocks down\nbelow and it's like you know so there's\nsomething about being a superhero that\nhas to do with just the problems you\nguys face feel so large so it seems like\nthe only way to overcome them is to be\nsuperhuman\nand then and then something about you\nknow Richard is is you know voiced a\nlittle bit of frustration with kind of\nlike this what are you just gonna say\nlike we have to just be normal like you\nknow there's a little bit of frustration\nthere so I wanna I want to try to dig\ninto that do and then I think you know\nwe've talked a fair amount about\nmotivation and sort of setting ourselves\nup for success or failure holding\nourselves to high standards how we\nhandle ourselves when we do fail right\nso like what do you guys think so\nRichard started off this talk with and\nTony will give you a chance to introduce\nyourself in just a second okay\nso Tony just I mean sorry Richard\nstarted off this conversation he kind of\nsaid I went ten days without it sounds\nlike fapping and then I relapsed so he\nviews that as failure right Richard\nthat's a failure what are the rest y'all\nthink about that I've you and more is a\nstumble than falling over like if you if\nyou imagine the journey is like a series\nof hurdles it's more like you know you\ntook you cleanly got over ten and then\nyou kind of stumbled on like the 11th\nbut that doesn't mean that you've fallen\nover and you have to start again\nit just means you continue and that was\na bump in the road I think that's the\nmost helpful perspective because it\nfeels like this sort of guilt and shame\nthat builds with relapse can often sort\nof push you can just erase all progress\nyou've made because you start to hate\nyourself again and then that self-hatred\nfurther fuels you feel like maybe you\nknow maybe I shouldn't get better maybe\nI shouldn't get better maybe I should\njust go back to where I was because I\ndeserve it\nyeah so I think it's just helpful to try\nand not feel guilt or shame just accept\nthat you made a mistake but it's a\nstumble not other people have thoughts\nyeah I - I guess meditation in that when\nyour mind does wander you don't force\nyourself to get back in being centered\nbut you gently allow yourself to come\nback and it's part of the process that\nevery time you are able to come back\nthat's he a rat right and you need\nmultiple repetitions to build that\nmuscle so it's part of the process and\nyou're only it would be I guess a newbie\nmistake to think that the rule of the\ngame is to not relapse the proper game\nis to stay in a good connection with\nallowing yourself to have a good flow of\ncoming back as long as you can come back\nin the long that's that's the long\nthat's the real game or at least a\nhigher level game so I notice bear\nnodding but Tony you want to just take a\nchance to introduce yourself thanks for\njumping in by the way uh thank you yes\nmy name is Tony what should you just\ntell us a little bit about I mean if\nyou're comfortable you can just say I'm\nTony and that can be sufficient but you\nknow sometimes it can it's been helpful\nfor other people to hear a little bit\nabout what's bringing you here today and\nmaybe what you struggle with\nyeah so I've been it's sometimes I care\nabout my I guess my tendency to like a\nresort to porn and then that's been\ngoing on and off since I I think mmm\nI'm a great grade 5 grade 6 you know\nwhat I was like 10 11 12 years old and\neven more so ever since I got an\ninternet connection\nand I feel like it's just something I\nthink that's the point is not the\nproblem itself is just a symptom and I\nthink it's just holding me back i\nwhatever the root causes the root\nproblem is what do you think it's a\nsymptom of avoidance\nI think fighter seeking just shortcuts\njust I hedonism I think I've what are\nyou avoiding I think emotional pain ego\npain responsibility mostly those three I\nthink that's what comes to mind right\nthis moment what do you think about that\nbear so like in my opinion with Richards\nI guess instance is that when he does I\nguess relapse into masturbation that's\nthat's not a failure it's just it would\nbe a failure in my opinion if he was\nignoring responsibilities or trying to\novercome some some type of emotions you\nknow but I agree with Tony like\nwholeheartedly actually\nRichard what's it like to hear other\npeople say that they don't really view\nyou as a failure my first reaction I\ndon't know I I I'm not I don't want to\nsay I'm super hard on myself but I just\nI made this way to where when I started\nthis journey I failed other people I let\na lot of people down and that's what\nkind of is getting to me because I\nwanted again I want it to be that\nsuperhuman and you know take this on and\nshow other people that it's possible\nit's just I see it as a slight mist mess\nup in the road that was ahead of me not\nlike with ghosts instant with when go\nset the hurdling when you kind of\nstumbled but you didn't exactly fall you\ndon't have to start all over again\nyou could still kind of I do see it as a\nstumble but I still look at it as if I\nfailed everyone watching and it's just\nit sucks I mean I wish I I wanted to be\nthe person that came on stream and\nshowed everyone it was possible and I\ndon't know emotions they're starting to\nrise yeah I see that\nso first of all do you guys see how\nRichard for the first time and all the\ntime we've started we've been speaking\nis starting to not make sense but you\nguys see that like you can don't talk\nyou know I'll see what I'm saying like\nhis his words like so he because he's\nsort of acknowledging so what I'm\npointing out is that Richard Richard I\ndon't mean that as an insult what I mean\nis that there's a part of you that\nacknowledges and can view things the way\nthat other people are viewing them and\nthere's also this other part of you that\nis complete like doesn't give two [ __ ]\nabout that\nyeah it's steep steep routed yep it's\ncorrect looked and absolutely right so\nwhen other people are encouraging you\nhow are you feeling I always say that\nagain sorry other people are basically\nlike trying to encourage and support you\nright how do you feel when they do that\nI guess I guess what I would say is like\nthe superhero mentality has two sides of\nthe coin and when there's failure its\ncatastrophic and when there's\nencouragement like the reach when I'm\ntaking on the superhuman feat to show\neveryone it's possible I get energy from\nthe people encouraging me but when when\nI stumble and fail it still hurts it\nhurts a lot\nyeah so I'm gonna even keep him on as\nweak to kryptonite though say that again\nsorry goes can you say that Superman is\na weak to kryptonite everyone how's that\nkryptonite even the superhero\nyeah what does it like to hear that\nRichard that's it's hard to hear but\nit's a tough pill to swallow but I'm I'm\non the path to swallow it I'm gonna try\nto put some words into your mouth so I\nthink you sort of hinted at this that\nwhen things are going well and other\npeople encourage you it makes you feel\ngood right it fuels you and after you\nperceive that you've failed and other\npeople encourage you I think you\nactually feel worse\nyeah yeah it was hard hearing everyone\nsaying it's hard hearing that it was\njust a stumble when I'm trying to make\nit this ultimate fail yeah right so\nlet's just notice that for a second that\ndespite other people trying to help you\nand support you and I I think you know\nthat these guys care about you right\nlike yeah absolutely so how does that\nwork where like when when we when we do\nsomething let's say we mess up and it's\nunclear how much you've messed up or if\nthis was a stumble or you [ __ ] up\ncatastrophic ly in the world is gonna\nend\nlike let's just table that for a second\nand just understand that we it's unclear\nbut what do you guys think about you\nknow what's going on when when someone\nis receiving support was when people are\ntrying to support another human being\nand that makes the other human being\nfeel worse have you guys ever been in\nthat situation yeah so how do how does\nthat work like what's going on there\nit's like having the opposite effect I\ndon't know I like there's an element of\ntrying to just lone-wolf it figure it\nout myself\nI don't yeah for me it's pride I come\nback to the ego because I don't my\ninitial reaction is I don't like to\naccept help when I when part of me or a\nlot of me feels like I can do it myself\nand to accept help means that there's\nsomething wrong with me or it feels like\nthat way I see a lot of people nodding\nyeah yeah I think we relate a lot I\nthink\nwhat's that like\ncool feels kind of cool feels it's\ninteresting you know cuz I mean part of\nthe reason why I didn't mind opening up\nabout fluoridation is just because I\nknow it's more and more common now so I\nfeel like it's not only I'm not alone\nyes very houses yes yeah Terry Crews\nthat big time\nbig time yeah so let me ask you\nsomething this is a little bit more\ndirected at Richard and if you guys feel\nlike this is kind of monopolizing our\ndiscussion please let me know but since\nI think relapse this is all related to\nrelapse okay so Richard when these\npeople say it's just a stumble I would\nventure that there's a part of your mind\nthat understands that but that you\nactually feel like they don't understand\nyou as well when they encourage you and\nyou feel I would say elements of that\nbut it's more so I'm just pushing that\naway yep\nI'm pushing their input away I'm just\ntrying to UM why are you pushing their\ninput away and other people can answer\nto if they can relate to Richards\nsituation why let's put it this way why\ndo you guys let's give Richard a second\nlet's ask the group why do you guys\nthink he's pushing you away because we\ndon't understand his full situation\nmaybe because you can only you can only\never truly be your own certain see in\nlife I think there's probably multiple\nreasons but I think that it's really\ndifficult to accept help when help can\nfeel unstable and temporary and it's\nvery easy to go into the shell a feeling\nlike you need to be just completely made\nof steel because you're the only one\nyou'll ever be able to rely on so it's\npossible maybe that's an element but I'm\nnot sure\nyeah being able to stand on your own two\nfeet is really important to a lot of\npeople it's like it's been said before\naccepting help kind of acknowledges the\nfact that there is something like so\nwrong with you\nthat it's unable to be solved by\nyourself\nand that can be very difficult to admit\nyeah there's also a kind of weird double\nstandard the way you think of help as\nthis thing that other people should get\nbut when it comes to yourself you expect\nabsolutely everything you expect to be\nsuperhuman basically and it's a\ncompletely sort of irrational thing but\neven knowing it's irrational it doesn't\nit doesn't remove it it's it's still\nthere persist\nso Richard out of what people have said\nwhat resonates with you or if anything\nresonates I said it earlier before but\nlike this lone wolf mentality work\nthere's like a certain level of pride\nthat comes in when I just figure it out\nmyself\nyou know I have all these problems\narising and then I being the superhuman\nself is able to just figure it out\nmyself\nand it's just it's hard it's hard\nhearing advice from other people because\nI I'm on I feel like I'm on this journey\nalone but I'm at the impact of others\ntrying to I'm stumbling again I'm on\nthis like you've always sold your own\nproblems yes yes no I would say\nprimarily yes that's yeah that's why I\nexpected there why did you expect to\nhear that um I don't know that's sort of\njust how I feel in it it seemed like I\nsaw a pattern and it just made sense\nthat that would be the case because if\nyou learned that you're the only one you\ncan ever rely on then that's just how\nyou continue through life yeah so I'm\nnoticing this theme that's emerging\nright that nofap is a single-player game\nright and and that I mean that we talk\nabout superheroes we talk is it okay\nthat I make jokes like is that okay like\ndoes that yeah I'm hedging it okay going\nfor maximum number of clippable moments\nbut so but seriously like that that's\nwhat we cuz like seriously I mean it is\nright so like when we think about\nmasturbation like masturbation is like a\nsolo exercise the demons that you guys\nstruggle with are are like internal that\nlike all in here like it's you know it's\nnot about the external world it's not\nabout other people even going back to\nAaron's analogy which I'm gonna probably\ndo a thousand more times like he's\ntalking about one guy holding on to one\nlog in a stream it's not like a crap\nlike it's\nlike a crowd of people and like the\nTitanic it's just like you alone and\nthen the other thing that's kind of\ncrazy is that you know III know that you\nguys feel ashamed for failing but the\nother really crazy thing is that I think\nif we got if we actually stopped and\nlooked at it you guys are incredibly\nself-reliant and you're incredibly\nresilient and you have high reserves of\nwillpower and that what you guys have\ndone is adopt a strategy in life that in\nis like a single-player kind of like\nyou're you're playing like it's like\nyou're making an RPG at the beginning\nand you're gonna do like a single-player\nlike single character playthrough it's\nlike normally it's a party RPG but you\nguys have decided to do you know one\ncharacter hog mode absolutely that's\nwhat it feels like right you guys living\nare you guys playing game are you guys\nplaying the game of life on hardmode\niron man yeah absolutely absolutely\nright yeah\nno save scumming no reloading just\nwhat's that like I'm barely like\nleveling up I'm like not even getting to\nthe next level sometimes I you know have\na good kill streak but for the most part\nin the long run I I can do way better\nthan this so I think that says it all\nright if I'd say there's one thing that\nI think all of you guys overwhelmingly\nagree with it's I can do way better than\nthis yeah where'd you guys get that idea\nwhat's that where does that come from\nsocial pressures say more about that\nbear I mean I guess culturally my my\nfamily is always all about trying to me\ntrying to get me to get my doctorate or\nor just be successful and a monetary\nvalue but not emotionally I just kind of\nweighs a heavy burden on its own yeah do\nyou mind if I ask what your ethnicity is\nmy parents are from Pakistan okay yeah\nso I mean I don't know if you guys so\nSouth Asian parents and East Asian\nparents especially for people who\nimmigrated from our country of origin\ntend to be very very status oriented\nthey really believe that and I'm sure I\nmean this is true of not just those\ncultures but dr. Angelou yeah right so\nand and it's tough because what they do\nis they make you feel like your value as\na human being is related to things that\nyou check off on a list like bear have\nyou gotten your doctorate yet no I'm\nactually about to start my Master's\nburger oh my goodness that's just\ncompletely unacceptable yeah yeah right\nand and they they make you feel like I\nmean that's that's your measure of value\nas a human being like it's not that a\nhuman being can be more than that it's\njust you know the measure of value of\nyour degree for me like I can feel like\nmy inner critic and my image of I guess\nthe external critic is like it's so\nsimple just don't touch your peepee you\nknow and how can you how can you mess\nthat up you know so I think that I left\nthat inner critic unchecked for so many\nyears that you know until it more\nrecently I've been now we get the sense\nthat we're not alone\nyeah I still sort of even hearing that I\nstill sort of maintain the idea that is\nlike solo playing for me it's just sort\nof really deeply ingrained even though I\ncan intellectually resonate with that\nthe feeling within me is still this is\nsolo player yeah so what do you guys so\nin a sense it is right because\nultimately I think when we think about\nespecially addictions it's we kind of\nthink a little bit about you know\nultimately it's an it's an internal\njourney like no one is gonna slap a\nchastity belt on you right it struggles\nthat you have to you know deal with on a\non a day to day basis but at the same\ntime I think that there is some amount\nof you know there's there's a different\nkind of balance that has to be struck so\nI think at the end of the day these are\nyou know it's it's like the only person\nthat is how can I say this you know at\nthe end of the day the important thing\nis that Tony not touch his peepee right\nlike it's not about us not touching his\npeepee it's about Tony not touching his\npeepee and so and so that there is there\nis a certain amount of single player\nearnest to this like absolutely so any\nkind of substance or addiction that we\ndeal with ultimately is like is gonna\nhave a deep single like single player\nkind of component to it because no one\nelse is gonna fix this for you it's not\nabout other people fixing you and at the\nsame time I think that as people have\nkind of mentioned you know the way that\nyou treat yourself is like different\nfrom the way that you treat other people\nand something about that I think is like\nincredibly toxic right so like Tony was\ntalking a little bit about the way that\nhe left left his inner critic unchecked\nI think it's a beautiful way of putting\nit in the case of bear it sounds like a\nlot of his criticism is not actually\ncoming from internally it's coming from\nexternally but I'd say also in bears\ncase that all of those external\nstatements have created a standard that\nyou measure yourself against right so\nyou accept their premises and they\nbecome your premises it's internalized\nabsolutely so there is something\nincredibly singleplayer about this so my\nnext question kind of goes to primary I\nmean sort of Richard but anyone can\nanswer so Richard sort of he played a\nlittle game where he pretended to be me\nfor a second and and he sort of said\nlike you kind of envisioned almost like\nwhat I was gonna say so what do you guys\nthink my response is to what we're\ntalking about so like so it's like a\nsoft spot for me trying to defend it\ndefend what this idea that I'm not a\nsuperhero that I that I do have\nkryptonite that's what you think I'm\ngonna say no that's what I think I sorry\nyeah that's okay so I think yeah poor\nTony what I think when I think you're\ngonna say now is that a it's not exactly\na single-player game now you there's\ncomponents of single-player mode but\nit's like all of us are playing\nsingle-player mode beside each other so\nthe rules exactly tutorials we can share\nour experience we can route each other\nWow we could hold each other accountable\nbecause it's\nit's your own game but you're playing\namongst brothers who actually for the\nmost part know what you're going through\nyeah that's that's my inference yeah so\nI think that's a beautifully put\nI'm gonna add sort of another layer to\nit so I'm gonna just talk for a second\nabout the superhero complex because I\nthink that's something that I certainly\nhave felt from time to time like very\ndeeply I think it's something that\nresonates with our community a lot and\nso is it okay if I just kind of offer\nsome thoughts about that so first thing\nis like you know I get the sense that a\nlot of people feel like they have to\nmake up for lost time and in a sense\nlike what you've got to do is like the\nthe the more screwed up you are the more\nHerculean you have to be to sort of fix\nit\nso I remember like when I was failing\nout of college and also had had like a\nbad GPA so I graduated with like a 2.5 I\nfelt like the only way that I could hold\nmy head up with pride was to like do\nsomething that was superhuman like go to\nHarvard for medical school for example\nright so like the more behind you feel\nabout yourself\nthe higher the standard that you set to\nkind of like make things even does that\nmake sense\nI'm gonna jump in and ask a question\nyeah has anyone here watched the movie\nlimitless okay it kind of feels like\nthat in the sense that like you're like\nat the start of the movie he's a failed\nwriter and then he takes this pill\nunleashes his genius and he becomes God\nbasically you sort of feel like you have\nto do that yeah right so you feel like\nyou have to does it like so the more\nbehind you feel in life the more messed\nup you feel the more it requires\nsomething like really really huge to fix\nthat\nright because and I think this kind of\ngoes back to just the struggle and like\nAaron's like imagery at the beginning\nwhich is the size of the struggle that\nyou guys are dealing with is just so big\nand insurmountable that an ordinary\nhuman can't do it what do you guys think\nabout that well I think another part of\nit for at least for me is that sometimes\nmy ego feels like you know what I am\nsuperhuman I'm just gonna allow myself\nto [ __ ] up because I know I can catch up\nlater\nyou know I can fix this later you know\nI'm I'm a smart guy\nI have a lot of potential I'm just gonna\nsolve this problem later I know I could\ncompensate for it I know a miracle I can\npull off miracles and I can do this\nlater so that's another part of it I'm\nnot sure if other people relate to that\nit's like it's hundreds oh yeah I see a\nlot of people nodding when you guys go\nback and it goes back and forth between\nthe say shame and then pride so maybe\ntwo two sides of the same coin yeah what\ndo y'all think for me at least I guess I\nwas at one extreme when I was younger\nwhere I just continually thought that\nlike I I had a massive ego I was at the\ntop of the world it was one and big\nambitious I still have extremely big\nambitions for this have a different\nperspective on it now it's more like I'm\nscum but I guess I sort of think of it\nas anything that I'm able to accomplish\nas someone as low as I am if I can do it\nthen maybe I can demonstrate to others\nthat anything is possible if someone is\nbass and Lobos meet can do it as well\num I kind of resonate with the feeling\nof like I'm smart I can do this later\nand it almost feels like manic\ndepression where you can oscillate\nbetween feeling like I can't achieve\nanything in life - I can become God and\nyou can just keep swinging back and\nforth like that that's like when I was\nyounger my my teacher when I was about\nprobably 9 or 10 suggested that I be\nmoved up either 2 or 3 years in school\nand she didn't want to move me further\nbecause it would be disruptive because\nof the age difference like with\nteenagers but I refused because I was\nkind of afraid of that\nand she wanted me to go to Oxford and I\nfeel like I'm now at a point where I've\nfailed that but there's still a part of\nme that thinks I could put a miracle out\nof the bag and it's this constant\noscillation between thinking I'm gonna\nbe homeless or like a multi-millionaire\nand there's no in-between like it's just\none or the other all the time\nso Toni's laughing\nyeah absolutely I'm either gonna you\nknow become not even a billionaire but\nlike just partially like a Messiah\nComplex and or just oh my god I\nI just want to fade into nothingness and\nyou know if a hint of nihilism comes in\nwhen I'm at hello and then my sia\ncomplex when I'm at my high and that\noscillation between there is as real and\nand then sometimes the lows get lower\nbecause okay\nI've been oscillating between these two\nmodes for how many years now and if I'm\nbeing almost honest with myself maybe I\ndo need help\nso can't do this myself okay so we've\ncome far away from porn addiction but I\nthink this is really important to talk\nabout so I mean I hope people who are\nwatching find this useful so I'm gonna\ntry to offer once again a little bit\nmore kind of like of my opinion about\nthis subject so the first question is\nlike so let's let's just define what\nwe're talking about so I think that when\nyou guys we're talking about porn\naddiction this particular problem\nrecruits part of our psychology which is\nthis like complete failure versus\nsuperhuman amazing person like Messiah\ngenius versus you know no one who's\nsitting at home playing video games and\njerking off\nso this is a part of us that doesn't\njust rely like it's not just porn\naddiction that taps into this right it's\nlike professional expertise\nit's dating life which we should\nprobably switch to dating in a few\nminutes\nyou know it's it's like making money\nit's being respected it's no FAP it's\nlike all of this stuff where and and you\nguys are noticing that it you oscillate\nquickly between these two things whether\nthe two things actually seem to be like\nreally connected right so it's it's it's\nalmost like you know sort of saying like\noh I keep on oscillating between being\nawake and being asleep at night and it's\nlike yeah well that's because like\nsleeping and waking fullness are like\nfundamentally connected so these are two\nmodes that you operate between it's the\nfirst question is do you guys think that\nplaying this game of sometimes feeling\nlike a genius and sometimes feeling like\na piece of [ __ ] like is that a good\nstrategy to live life does it work so\nfar okay so then the question is how do\nwe free ourselves of what I call the\nproblem of escalating impossibility\nwhich is that the further you fall the\nmore you escalate what you need to do to\nmake yourself kind of feel better so\nlike at the beginning it's a little bit\nimpossible and then after you a year\ngoes by it becomes even more impossible\nand even more impossible so in in ghosts\ncase he had a chance to skip a couple of\ngrades and then it became Oxford and now\nit's like he has to do something even\nbigger right\nso how do we free ourselves from that\nany idea it feels like it feels like\narrogance maybe a play somewhere yes\nabsolutely it can it can feel like um\nI'm gonna give myself all these debuffs\nand watch what I can do\nyeah watch me succeed even with the D\npuffs yeah it feels kind of like some\nshowmanship and it's like making your\nlife harder than it has to be just to\nprove a point\nyep but I'm not entirely sure that comes\nfrom life go for Tony I for myself I\nthink my extreme side thinks that okay\nI just have to change everything I'm\ndoing because all that I've been doing\nhas gotten me the same results so I have\nto do everything differently or I think\nmy why's itself kind of this thinking\nmaybe I just have to change one key\nthing and it's very I do it very gently\nand you know I almost be effortless okay\nif I if I just find the right thing that\nI have to change so I'm gonna go back to\nghosts so what we'll put a pin in what\nTony said which is essentially change\neverything versus change one thing and\nghosts you kind of said that you don't\nknow where that arrogance comes from\nwhere do you think it comes from\nI think there's like a really just vast\nsupply of anger that's stored and it's\nlike almost I don't have to what it okay\nso you guys get that like the part of\nyou that wants to be super human wants\nto make up for the rest of you right\nlike that's why you you you are you\nswitch between being like ego to like\nlike super genius brilliant capable of\nanything and like nothing so that you\nguys see how there's like actually\nbalance there and the worse you feel\nabout yourself the more you begin to\nfantasize about what you're capable of\nso that's your your minds way of\nactually protecting you from that shame\nso it starts to build up this kind of\nfantasy that you can accomplish this and\nyou can do this and you're gonna show in\nand ghosts also mention let your gonna\nlike show something to someone that part\nof this like you know I'm gonna debuff\nmyself and then I'm gonna do it and then\nI'm gonna show them who's them\nyeah it's kind of bright sure like who\nare you who are you trying to do that\nfor what are you trying that's a\ndemonstration do you guys get that the\ngoals that you set yourself are a\ndemonstration and a demonstration has an\naudience right it's not actually like\njust internal you're actually you know\nno fapping for everybody else right so\nwhat what are you trying to demonstrate\nand who are you trying to demonstrate it\nto maybe could be for just looking for\nsomeone to like give you recognition and\naffection that you have been like\nmissing out on for a long time\nokay so recognition from others and what\nwill that do if you get recognition from\nothers there's the shameful part and\nthen there's the Massiah part right\nthere's the person whose level zero and\nthere's a person whose level 100 if you\nget recognition from others who does\nthat help it reinforces our image of the\nlevel 100 Pro but it feels like it helps\nthe little zero absolutely so you guys\nsee like the two are linked right\nbecause the person who's really hungry\nfor recognition man you could say\nthey're both hungry for recognition and\nthen there's one other person so like so\nwhen we demonstrate to the rest of the\nworld that we're capable of succeeding\ndespite all of our difficulties\nso that's important to show the rest of\nthe world and then who else are we\ntrying to show our case absolutely right\nso you guys like that's what you want\nyou guys get that like on the deepest\nlevel it's not actually about other\npeople it's it's like Richard said I\nmean he wants to be able to do it by\nhimself and and he wants to be you know\nhe wants to be an example to others but\nlike so I don't know I don't know how to\nsay this beyond just saying it he wants\nto be an example to others the focus of\nthat statement is actually not on other\npeople\nthe focus he's not saying I want to help\nothers he wants to be an example for\nothers it's actually a deeply\negotistical statement yeah right\nlike you want to be the inspiration for\nthem and there's there's a part of that\nthat is absolutely altruistic and\nabsolutely designed like wanting to help\nothers the problem is that there's this\nother weird complex that kind of like\nhijacks that a little bit like it's not\nabout helping others it's about being\nthe person who is Superman like he's not\ntrying to trick like if you know he\ncould very easily just lie to everyone\nand say that he's doing it and inspire\npeople that way right\nlike he can just tell everyone look\neveryone I'm doing it you can do it too\njust live his entire life as a live\npositivity and you can maybe inspire\ntons of people and so I think it's good\nthat you guys don't do that right\nbecause I think the other crazy thing\nhere is I'm gonna ask other people so do\nyou think that Richard if Richard had\nafter last week been transformed and\nbecome Superman\nversus Richard stumbling after ten days\nand then we continue to watch Richards\nyou know growth over over time which one\ndo you think is actually gonna help\npeople more definitely the ladder\nyeah the stumbling because if if people\nsee the example where it's just\ninstantaneous it's like look guys I did\nit I did this superhuman feat and they\nattempt it and then based on bull then\nthey feel like that different and that\nthey've failed in some way I say see a\nstumble\nsuccess story they say oh this person's\nhuman and they succeeded therefore I can\ndo it sit right because here's the thing\nif if Richard wakes up one day in a\nSuperman anything that he discovers\nabout his life in his playbook doesn't\napply to anyone else\nbecause they're not they're not supermen\nbuying exceptional means that everyone\nelse isn't is not everyone can be\nexceptional yes or yeah but I think\neveryone can be exceptional but I I\nthink we're talking about the same thing\nright so I I think the first thing to\nunderstand is that you know when it\ncomes to this kind of stuff so like all\nof us are flawed and none of us are\nsupermen so Richard is right in terms of\nyou know what he hypothesized I was\ngonna say but I think the trick here is\nnot letting go of the Superman it's\nactually letting go of the idea that\nyou're a failure because the Superman\narises out of the idea that you're a\n[ __ ] right so what you really need to\ndo if you want to be free from this\nwhole complex is don't try to be\nordinary just just understand that like\nstumbling is a part of life right and\nlike Tony was kind of saying that like\nyou know the game the goal of meditation\nis not to have a still mind the goal of\nmeditation is to be able to bring your\nmind back to a point where you want it\nto every time your mind wanders and you\nbring it back to where you want it to\nthat's doing a push-up because you're\nstrengthening the capacity for you to\ncontrol your mind\nand it's like excelling in spire floors\nrather than being flawless exactly so so\nif I have to pick a strategy in life\nit's not perfection it's damage control\nso just think about this like if you're\ntrying to like play a game like you know\nthere are different kinds of builds you\ncan do I don't know if you got I play\nRPGs so like you know there's like\nevasion tanking which is the idea that\nyou have a low HP pool and you never get\nhit and then there's also like damage\nmitigation with a healer like evasion\ntanking is like a super high-risk\nhigh-reward kind of strategy because if\nyou get a hit once you're dead\nthe more reliable strategy is learning\ndamage control\nso to accept that you're gonna [ __ ] up\nand learn how to fix it so I'd say that\nyou know a lot of my success comes from\nthe basic idea that I'm gonna just kind\nof suck at life and that that's okay and\nthat I can learn and I can grow and I\ncan improve so Richard says that I\nfailed after ten days I've been doing my\nbest to you know put my psychiatrist\nface on and not actually show my emotion\nbut there's a part of me that's like\nthat's amazing man you went ten days\nwithout jerking off yeah so like can we\njust like pause to just think about that\nfor a second like if you skydive man\nboom if you school like what if you\nscrew up once every ten days when it\ncomes to masturbation that's actually\njust a normal amount of masturbation or\neven less normal a naughty percent\nsuccess rate like that's what you're\nlooking for you're not looking for\ncelibacy I mean maybe you are no fab\nright so like whatever y'all's goals are\nbut like like it this is the other thing\nso people think I'm gonna just talk for\na second about sobriety and and relapse\nand all that kind of crap we can talk\nabout this too but I'm just gonna share\nsome thoughts so like you know people\ndon't get sober overnight even though\nthat's how they perceive it so like what\nhappens when you go to an a a meeting is\nlike you know you see a guy who's like\nyeah I'm here for my one-year chip and\nother dudes there for their five-year\nchip and so what people look at is they\nlook at someone and they see five years\nof sobriety that started one like five\nyears ago on the day they look at one\nyear of sobriety that started one year\nago and that's our perception of success\nbecause success is being sober for a\nyear for five years and the dude who's\nfive years sober do you guys know how\nold he is 55 you guys been to a meetings\nlike there a lot of old dudes at AAA\nmeetings right okay so it's worthwhile\nto go to an a a meeting like once in\nyour life I think it's a wonderfully\ninspirational experience probably one of\nmy best experiences from that school\nactually and so the interesting thing is\nthat like you know sobriety is something\nthat you practice so when I work with\npeople what I see is like okay they've\nbeen using for 18 months and then they\ngo like three months of sobriety and\nthen they relapse and they feel awful\nabout themselves and we work through\nthat and then they go nine months\nwithout using and then they relapse and\nthey feel awful about that over time the\nduration between their relapses\nincreases and the severity of their\nrelapses and duration of their relapses\nactually goes down\nso there are some times where I really\nlike stop and think because I feel like\nshould I actually so either I've even\neven patients that I'm considered sort\nof terminating with so like not firing\nbut sort of saying hey I don't think I\ncan help you because you keep on\nrelapsing and so as a provider I stop\nand I think like okay I'm not just not\ngetting through to this person but when\nI actually stop and I like go through my\nnotes I realize oh this guy has had two\nrelapses in the last 24 months and for\nthe five years before that they were\nusing pretty much every day so like\nunderstand that relapse is a part of it\nbut what you need to look at is like how\nlong does the relapse last how bad is it\nand how much how quickly can you kind of\nget back on the wagon does that make\nsense yeah and so you guys are gonna\n[ __ ] up but like that's normal like\nyou're you're learning you're like\nlearning how to control this thing and\nthey're gonna be periods of times where\nyou guys are gonna do a good job at it\nand they're gonna be periods of times\nthat you're gonna do a bad job at it and\nthere are gonna be times where you do a\ngood job and something really\nunfortunate is gonna happen in your life\nthat is going to emotionally wear on you\nand then your capacity for like\nwillpower and discipline is gonna get\ntanked because you're dealing with all\nthis emotional crap right so like the\nfirst question that pops into my I don't\nthink there's actually true but you know\nI someone like Richard I'd be really\ncareful about like the way that your dad\njudges you and whether that relates to\nyou fapping and when I talked to out\nlike some of you other guys like it\nsounds like there are other things that\ngo on like Tony sort of says he thinks\nit's a symptom of a problem\nwhen we talked to bear that too is like\nhis way of getting out of his like head\nin his analysis paralysis and his\nfeelings of like shame for not being\nwhat his like cultural group wants him\nto be and so if we really think about it\nlike it's not just the fapping it's like\nall this other crap in the real solution\nis to deal with all of those things\nright because if bear is like securing\nthe person he is if he learns how to\ntrain his mind a little bit better if\nTony not only stops trying to change\neverything all at once and then Tony's\ntrying to change one thing at a time\nwhat Tony really needs to learn how to\ndo is change nothing right so Tony needs\nto accept where he is and that mistakes\nare gonna be made and that he's exactly\nwhere he's supposed to be and that over\ntime he can change his life but that\nfundamentally there's nothing wrong with\nhim so if you feel like you have to\nchange something that means that\nsomething's not right but this is\nimportant to understand you can only be\nlike I don't know if this is this is\ngonna make no sense okay so you guys can\nonly be the things that you are you\ncan't be anyone else like bear you can't\nbe in a doctoral program right now like\nit's just not possible like like reality\nis like one thing a reality is not\nactually possibilities reality is not\nlike reality is just what it is does\nthat make sense\nlook I know this is gonna sound weird\ncan you reader iterate on the\npossibilities reality is not\npossibilities yes are you guys right now\nlike you can't be anywhere except for\nwhere you are like it is literally\nimpossible for you to be anything but\nwho you are where you are when you are\nin this moment only then now there's no\nactual future there's no past it's only\nthere now yeah and the present is the\nonly place in which you have agency you\ncan't change the past by thinking about\nit and you can't change the future but\nyou only have agency to change things in\nthe exact Karma\nyes and so since you let so this is\ngonna sound absolutely crazy but since\nyou do not have the power to go into the\npast and change your decisions you\nactually have no power to be except for\nwhere you are\nthat's like nearly impossible\nOh God just to share my experience I\nevery time I'm reminded of that I can\ntake a deep breath and accept that and\nthen maybe you know it could be an hour\nlater or a day later then I lose that\nthat that mindset of just allowing\nmyself to be me\nso I I in a way I relate that to\nrelapsing every time I forget that I all\nI need to do is just be myself\nright now that's a win but then when I\nforget that that's to me it's like\nparallel to a relapse yep yeah because\nbecause what so the thing that that\nresults in relapse so when you are able\nto be where you are now you enter sort\nof like a non-judgmental state you're\nfree from a lot of the things that you\nturn to pornography to protect you from\nfeelings of shame just wanting to\nrelieve what's going on in your head\nlike so sometimes just the process in\nyour head can be just so burdensome and\njust sucks it's like you know it's like\nso I used to hate PE class because it\nwas just dumb and it was like I would\njust run in a circle for like 30 minutes\nand I was like not very athletic and\npart of the other problem was I was\nyounger than everyone else in my grade\nso you know it's like seven and was\nplaying like sports with eight-year-olds\nlike you're at a huge disadvantage and I\njust never understood that so I thought\nI was just bad at it sports and things\nlike that but like PE just sucked and it\nfelt like I was just like it just felt\ntorturous like I'm just running around\nfor like half an hour and it's just\nawful I don't feel good physically I\ndon't feel good mentally and and you're\njust in your head and it just feels like\nreally really burdensome and you just\nwant it to stop and then along comes\nporn addiction or video games or any\nnumber of other or drugs\nthat can make it stop right and so why\nwouldn't you use it because you just\nwant to stop what's that whatever is\ngoing on in your head I mean what's\ngoing on in your head is coming from a\ncouple of places the first is you know I\nwas saying like you know the problem\nisn't fixing the Messiah the problem is\nletting go of feeling ashamed of\nyourself like if you can be comfortable\nwith the person that you are today you\ndon't need anything to make you feel\nbetter right if you can be what other if\nyou can tell yourself what other people\nin this chat are telling you if you can\nRichard if you can start channeling the\nvoice of these folks instead of your dad\nright if you can talk to yourself in\nthat way\nthen it becomes easier to be the person\nthat you are and if you can like if you\ncan be tranquil in the moment then the\nneed for porn addiction goes down not\nsaying it's just all cured right because\nthey're also like habits and other kinds\nof like like neurons play but I I think\nthat's really I mean all this stuff\ncomes down to just being comfortable\nwith where you are and accepting that\njust because you've made mistakes in\nlife just because you didn't jump ahead\nto grades just because you're not an\nadduct role program just because you\ndidn't go to Oxford just because you\ndidn't finish cleaning the garage on\ntime or any number of other things right\nthat like actually you're not in a\nstream holding on to a log you're in a\nkiddie pool and you can just put your\nfeet on the ground and you can get out\nof the water but that's not what it\nfeels like can I interrupt you really\nyeah of course um so I was yesterday for\nthe Miss gift stream you were talking\nabout ADHD and how he had certain\ntendencies like the need to be funny\nwhen he feels stupid is strengthening\nthat went what's the wind I or Vetta\nI ever yeah and so I'm trying to think\nof it now how I'm using this kind of\nlike superhero complex and you said\nsomething that I stopped you on it's\nreality\nyou can't you can't live in possibility\nyou can only live in reality when I'm in\nthose tough moments when like let's say\nwhen I get urges I like do this thing\nwhere you know how like the superhero\ncomplex there's the flip coin there's\nthat there's a superhuman and then\nthere's the the level zero screw-up and\nin my strengthening so like how misc if\nwas strengthening his relationship with\nhis ire Vetta like using that tendency\nover and over again am i doing that by\nliving in that possibility when I'm when\nI'm in this when I'm in this urge state\nand I live into the possibility of being\nperfect and being a superhuman am i\nreinforcing that complex when I live\ninto that possibility\nabsolutely so in my opinion yes so I\nthink the key thing that's why we\nstarted with so like when you when we\nthink about ourselves as a superhuman\nthat comes with the other side you guys\nsee that because a superhuman is born\nout of shame and that's why if you hear\nwhat everyone is saying everyone talks\nabout Oscillation no one here has said\noh I feel half of it but I don't feel\nthe other half like just think about\nthat for a second there's no look\nwithout lying exactly right so this is\nthe concept of something in sanskrit\ncalled Advait Vedanta which means non\ndualism that duality is fundamentally\nfalse and all that is is what is right\nyou're not Richard you're not good\nyou're not bad you're just you\nyou're not sufficient you're not\ninsufficient you're just you right like\nlike the only thing that you are is like\nwhat you are and where you are and\nthat's all there is and so in this\nmoment you either have the capacity to\nresist the urge or you don't have the\ncapacity to resist the urge and you have\nto be careful because if you have an\naddictive brain your addictive brain is\ngonna say oh yeah I don't have the\ncapacity to resist the urge and then you\nnotice that and you recognize okay is\nthat the addictive brain that's talking\nor do I really have the capacity to\nresist the urge and then you realize\nthat whether you have the capacity to\nresist the urge or not is dependent on\nyou because capacity is about the future\nit's not about the now it's a potentials\nthing which is it's a potential state\nwhich is yes and if I had to ask you\nRichard you know like how did you go ten\ndays without fapping or watching porn or\nwhatever you know like mmm oh this is\ngreat yeah I was I just filled my day\nwith doing stuff and then by the end of\nthe day I was already so exhausted that\nI just went to bed so like like you see\nhow that has no there's no capacity\nthere's no potential that is just doing\nmm-hmm what you filled your days with\nstuff that's your solution right that\nyou engage in the present time and time\nand time again and I don't know what\nhappened on day ten so there could be\nall kinds of yeah yeah I guess there's\nan element of like I was just exhausted\nI didn't like when I was doing stuff\nbeforehand on the tenth day I didn't\nhave that energy to do stuff and then\nwhat I did is I just I was just out of\nenergy I don't know yeah so and like\nthat sounds like so that sounds\nforgivable to me now I don't know\nexactly what a relapse looks like for\nyou guys right so like sometimes and\nthis is where you know how okay is it to\nrelapse I think it depends on what a\nrelapse looks like so I mean I I'm an\naddiction psychiatrist in my day job so\nI work with people who you know their\nrelapses look bad like and fatally I've\nhad two people I've worked with in the\nlast year have passed away unfortunately\nand and so like it's relapses can be bad\nand in your case like what does a\nrelapse look like like what relapses\nlook like for you guys for me it's just\nlike anywhere between a wasted\nhour to three hours and just a bad\nfeeling afterwards and then just wanting\nto be alone afterwards then not wanting\nto be productive afterwards\nand not wanting to be social afterwards\nfor how long so we have the the overall\neffect including the relapse itself and\nthe shameful afterglow anywhere between\nan hour to the rest of the day yeah okay\nit feels like the definition is really\nsubjective and it's kind of I feel like\nyou just have to be honest with your in\na sense of I feel like you sort of just\nknow whether you've relapsed or not but\nyou can lie to yourself and kind of\nrationalize that something wasn't\nrelapse with really arbitrary metrics I\nguess so it's just all about honesty\nwith yourself err did you want to say\nsomething\nyou've been yeah relapse for me it's it\ncan be wildly variant but like it can be\nas Tony said where it's just like\nhappens and then there's like a period\nof shamefulness and then uh when like\nfor example my depression was really bad\nit can like end up where the shame like\nfeeds into negative loop thoughts cycle\nand then like things get very mentally\nserious for me and then you can get very\npossibly lethal for me yeah right so I I\nthink you know that there is a lot of\nindividuality to this and also frankly a\nwide spectrum of severity right so I\nmean if you also suffer from depression\nor whatnot like it's you got to be\ncareful because all this stuff like\nfeeds on like they're all buddies like\nthis is the problem is like you guys are\nplaying a single-player game but like\nyour demons are playing multiplayer\nlike you guys are so low cueing and\nthey're like a five stack and it [ __ ]\nsucks\nif the solo carry yeah like you're\nplaying with a bunch of these pubs who\nlike you'd rather have bots on your team\nand then they're you know like your\ndepression being for an addiction and\nyour video game addiction and your you\nknow shame from not having a job and\nyour shame from not having a girlfriend\nlike the five of them queue up and then\nlike you know I don't know if you guys\nhave seen this like I play dota but like\nwhen people's like you know when they're\nlike the pictures next to their names\nlike line up to form an image you guys\nsee Matt and like that's when you know\nlike when it's like the bare bones of\nyour old Kim Jang Geun or something and\nthen and you know they're also like\ndifferent they're different ranks right\nso like some people have bad depression\nso it's like some like you know some\nhigh level player who's smurfing I used\nto play overwatch with a couple of\nbuddies of mine who were pros and they\nwould just it would be a [ __ ] joke\nwhen I would play tracer and he just\nkilled their entire team over and over\nand over and over and over again and so\nthe result was that I never learned how\nto play overwatch he would literally\nlike be like 27 and Oh at the end of the\ngame he would just give all of them\nand so I still don't know how to play\noverwatch but it's it's tough right so I\nthink when it when it comes down to it\nyou know if I have to summarize so the\nfirst thing to understand is that be\ncareful about your fantasies in your\nSuperman because is bizarre as that\nsounds like the reason that you guys\nbelieve in your Superman is because you\nguys actually are capable of that\nbecause Superman has existed for you and\nyou've gone the extra mile and you've\ndone things that are actually superhuman\nand so on the one hand I want you guys\nto understand that you know a lot of\npeople think about teams is there like\nlike who you are like you try to define\nby your weakest link like that's what we\ndo we define ourselves by our low points\nin life but what you should really do is\ndefine yourself by your high point\nbecause that's actually what you're\ncapable of right and it's not about the\nfuture it's not about hope it's not\nabout fantasy it's about what you've\nactually done before if you can go ten\ndays without fapping you can go ten days\nagain if you can go three years without\na drink you can go three years again\nlike if you've done it once you can do\nit again that's something that we know\nright like that's a statement of fact\nyou can do it again the second thing is\nto be aware that like you have to let go\nof your Superman complex and you have to\nlet go of your level zero newb you have\nto let go of the person who's [ __ ] up\nbecause like as crazy as it sounds like\nyou couldn't have been different before\nright you're not the person that you are\ntoday you're every day makes you uxp up\na little bit and you like learn things\nand you level up your skill like that's\nwhat happens in life do you guys like\nRemember Who y'all were five years ago\nlike you remember that kid yeah like\nthat kid didn't know anything right you\nlearned so much and just because you\ndon't have a doctorate or like your life\n- isn't moving forward in kind of a very\nnoticeable way doesn't mean that you\naren't getting better and this kind of\ngoes back to this idea of the ten year\novernight success so like you know\npeople think of all of these like\ninstitutions as overnight successes and\nI mean if you just look at them you know\nslates in progress\nabsolutely so like a good example that I\nuse with is Airbnb you guys know what\nAirbnb is so air B&B launched four times\nthey had three launches that were just\ncomplete failures and then their fourth\nlaunch was wildly successful like even\nwhen it comes to healthy gamer it's like\nyou know I used to get together on back\nin 2000 the end of 2017 and I started\nworking with gamers on discord there\nwere like 10 of us we worked together\nfor a year we were very very small and\nit was still fun and it was like really\nenjoyable and we helped people a lot and\nthen over the past couple of weeks like\nliterally weeks we've blown up but like\nthis has been a story that's like\ndecades in the making and you guys just\nsee like so this is where you know it\nalso comes back to being Superman so\nsomething that I try very hard to do is\nlike actually avoid the Messiah Complex\nof myself so people think I'm special my\nwhole point is that I'm not\nright like the reason that I can say\nthis stuff is because you know I used to\nplay playstation and jerk off all the\ntime when I was a freshman in college\nlike that's just what every day was it's\nlike skipping class jerking off playing\nPlayStation and apparently like making\ngirls cry when they try to give you\ntheir number right like I mean just how\nbad is that's just bad guys that's bad\nyeah I did all of that except for the\nPlayStation yeah so props dude so do you\nhave a time to get into relationship\nabsolutely let's do it yeah\nquicker wait um just I want to host like\none question gallon you mentioned like\ndoshas before I just wanted to I'm\ncurious if you have like a solid idea\nwhere everyone's doshas here after just\nlike an hour of talking to her\nsure do you have like a solid idea for\neveryone yeah I think so\nyou want another thing artists that\nwould be fun yeah okay so I think\nRichard is predominantly pizza I think\nbear is predominantly goof-up Aaron I\nthink you were Vuitton gufa ghosts I\nthink you're bitten maybe Vata and Tony\nmaybe I'm not so sure about Tony you\nhave you have fought the features and\nGotha features actually but hard to say\nyeah I think part of me just likes to be\nambiguous and not be pigeonholed so for\nsome reason I I think I subconsciously\ntry to mmm be everything you know like\nall the good time\nlike be amorphous yeah but let's let's\nmove on to relationships go sorry I I\nwant to just make sure we have time for\nthis but I'm always I would love to talk\nmore about my brother but that's my\ninitial instinct so who wants to so\nlet's talk about relationships well I'm\nnot sure if this is appropriate before\nwe move on I want to quickly say like\nyou know I feel good about this and I\nlove you guys for being here and thank\nyou for sharing you know yeah especially\ninto the hard parts yeah man and then\nwith that being said relationships right\nnow I feel like I'm avoiding\nrelationships because I feel like I\nthought I don't want a part of me feels\nlike I'm I want that I want to be you\nknow again the the level 100 pro first\notherwise bad things will happen\notherwise the other person will get hurt\nand I also afraid of rejection I think\nthat's where I'm at\nwho else wants to be perfect before they\nstart no surprise right so what does\nthat mean when I say who wants to be\nperfect before they start\nmaybe it's an idea go for it bear yep\nit's like oh we bought we want to be\nthat Superman that super super human\nbeing before we jump into something that\nmight make us more vulnerable why\nwhy is it important to be perfect before\nyou start okay will table it so first of\nall being perfect before you start is\nthat damage mitigation with healing or\nevasion tanking evasion very good guys\nsee that\ngood so we'll get we'll get to what that\nmeans okay so and then also Tony you\nsaid is that you you know you want to be\nlevel 100 before you start and then what\nwas the other thing that's keeping you\nfrom engaging in a relationship so what\nI feel really down when in wouldn't in\nthe past I've let people down and I'm\nespecially hurt when other people are\nhurt\nso those and I think I've been scarred\nfrom that you know I'm because I've let\nmyself down so many times I'm kind of\nthat to some degree but it really hurts\nwhen yeah thank you\nwhen other people that I care about are\ngenuinely hurt and then that's part of\nme can't forgive myself for hurting\nother people for being reckless or just\nnot being prepared or not being\nresponsible for what I am putting myself\ninto other people have just general\nthoughts about the way that they view\nrelationships my well I guess as of\nright now I'm just avoiding\nrelationships because last one I was\nthen I was cheated on and so like sorry\ntwo of them well yeah it's fine it just\ngoes further to reinforce like I haven't\nhad self-confidence issues in a while\nbut when something like that happens it\ngoes\nto destroy a lot of progress than making\nthat area and then also my relationships\nthat have always just been a mess I just\ncan't seem to find a healthy\nrelationship I've been in a relationship\nto where I was like I break up with them\nand then I was like harassed for months\nafter by them relationships or like I've\nbeen cheated on yeah it's just never\nbeen healthy interactions with me with\nrelationships that sucks man yeah and\nfor me like every time I hear horror\nstories from other people you know it\nmakes me feel like like [ __ ] I don't\nwant to get involved with that then you\nknow with all the bad news that I hear\nand you know I just I'm just filled with\nfear and and pain avoidance every time I\nhear something like that happens and on\ntop of that you know I didn't have my\nparents be in a best relationship as I\nwas going older and even to this point\nso that's for me that's a big part of it\njust not seeing a healthy relationship\nright in front of my eyes over and over\nagain so that I can be inspired and I\ncan model that down to my subconscious\nlevel I like that\nyeah I resonate with that too I actually\njust got out of like one of those horror\nstory relationships where it was a whole\nlot of gaslighting abuse to the point\nwhere I was beginning to become\ndelusional and my friends my family and\neven my therapist started to turn on me\nto a certain things\nit was it's a very crazy situation I\ndon't know if this is voyeuristic but I\nfind myself being very curious curious\nhow I yeah me too\nI'm willing to answer all questions I\nvery respect curiosity yeah bear I'm\nparticularly surprised that in a\nrelationship it sounds like everyone\naround you turned on you that's really I\ndon't think I've heard of that happening\neven including your therapist like\nthat's really strange\nso it was I'm a really highly empathetic\nindividual and I'm very agreeable and YX\nwas I mean I would label her as a covert\nnarcissist and she just kind of got\neveryone to turn on me I don't really\nknow how but they were they got to the\npoint where my friends in my family and\neven my therapist started to Gaslight me\nalong with with the same stories that\nshe would tell me it sounds awful man\nyeah for those who I mean maybe\nsomething you gather I know but from\nwhat I've heard and read when you're\nvery empathic you naturally attract\nnarcissists to know to take advantage of\nthat situation hundreds yeah and then to\nadd on to that like I think I'm\nnaturally empathic and then being afraid\nof being hurt by narcissist\nI kind of shove away my empathy\nsometimes and sometimes I'm a jerk so I\ndon't get taken advantage of and then\nsometimes if I'm not careful I'm\nparanoid of becoming a narcissist myself\nlike I'm swinging to the other extreme\nyeah you know I'm always asking myself\noh my god am I gonna become a narcissist\nand my you know cuz I want to be the\nother and like I shift what I'd rather\nhurt people or be hurt you know whereas\nI'd rather be just me I've been\ndescribed as um by like multiple girls\nas impenetrable in the sense that they\nfeel like when they try to get through\nto me someone said that they even if\nthey talk to me for years they feel like\nthey wouldn't truly know me like they\nknow other people and the as much depth\nas other people have they feel like\neveryone has a core but I've been told\nthat they feel like with me it's just\nmore and more less and then I was\ntelling this to one of my friends and\nthen he said that it seems like it's a\nshifting puzzle that you can peel back a\nlarren and the whole thing reshapes and\nthen you're even more confused and it's\nlike this subconscious thing where I\njust can't let anyone in and it's like\nI've never truly seen and I don't know\nit's or just terrifies me what terrifies\nyou there's a lot of aspects to it like\nfeels like I don't know the depth of my\nself which is quite scary and it's like\nmaybe I can never truly be myself in\nfront of anyone not even myself because\nof what what I may find that you know\nthat's so significant that I'm blocking\nit even for myself and then maybe I\ncan't ever\nunravel that puzzle so I'm gonna ask the\ngroup a question and I want to give\nRichard a chance to share if he wants to\nbut do you guys feel like you'll be all\nknow ghosts yeah kind of yeah yeah what\ndo you think about that Ghost\nwell actually two it goes just so you\nunderstand where I'm coming from I feel\nlike I like I know where you're coming\nfrom but you just take it a one or two\nsteps further but not that far not not\ntoo far from from my Syrian coast what\ndo you think of um okay I kind of I\nunderstand why you'd say that but I also\nfeel like there are multiple aspects to\na person in that you can have a persona\nand you can either sort you're getting\ndo you think we're getting a persona I\nthink you're getting hints of every so\noften there's like a moment of depth but\nthen it can kind of go back to persona\nlike there's a lot of things that I just\ndon't say sure and I would say that most\nof the people here know who you are how\ndoes that sit with you\nI'm not sure I agree because I feel like\nyep how would it sit with you\nwhat is so I know you don't agree but\nhow does it sit with you if people do\nknow who you are uncomfortable because\nI'm not sure that I know who I am yeah\nI'd like to be able to have people know\nwho I am and be my authentic self but I\nI kind of just it feels like I've my\nentire life I felt like a hurricane that\njust destroys anything that gets too\nclose so I try to keep people away and\nthat's sort of why I evade and that it's\na combination of not wanting to get hurt\nbut also not wanting to hurt others\nso ghosts I'm gonna interrupt you in a\nvery insensitive way just ask the group\ncuz I'm gonna just I'm gonna bludgeon\nyou with a hammer so so would you guys\ndescribe your experiences with ghosts\nwould you guys describe him as a tornado\nthat hurts everything in its path\ndefinitely not potentially to be honest\npotentially yeah what do you guys see\nhe's very insightful very very ins he's\ncaring he tries to uh it's always trying\nto rationalize things and ways and\nconnects to people in ways that way they\ncan feel more personal with what's going\non so very I guess little it's a little\nselfless thing to do but it's like\nappreciated stop ghost is cool as [ __ ]\nlook at him right now he is stoic you\nknow his accent he's in the shadow of it\nnow look at that that's so [ __ ] cool\nWow yeah ghost everything he said just\nhim like a u-turn it was completely\nalien to me I don't I don't see that I\nsee someone expressing an authentic\nvulnerable side to themselves on stream\nand I don't see any tornado I don't see\nany shifting puzzle and does anyone else\nsee that I don't see\nso ghosts like generally speaking like\nthe people on this stream tend to be\npretty right right\nlike when they say stuff I think that\nlike I I would I would venture that you\nthink that what they have to say or the\nway that you've demonstrated yourself\nmaybe you're you know putting on a\npersona is that you you tend to respect\nand value what other people say it seems\nlike a lot of what they've said has\nresonated with you and a lot of what\nyou've said is resonated with them would\nyou agree with that yeah I would agree\nwith that so how I feel like how do you\nexplain that these guys think that\nyou're this awesome person they also\nknow who you are\nthey're strangers across the internet\nyou guys have presumably been talking\nabout porn addiction for a couple of\nhours what how how does that work I\nthink I be caring but maybe it's that's\ndefinitely a destructive streak in me\ntrauma that can be quite unsettling\nbecause it like that definitely is this\ncaring part to me but when people see\nthat destructive element of me it kind\nof terrifies them because they wonder\nhow there can be such I'm almost sort of\nscared of that part of myself sure like\na like the Jungian shadow in a sense I\nguess yeah I also have that sort of\nsense that's why I'm not afraid of it\nseen it myself\nand I guess um I think I'm quite I'm a\nfew years older than you so I like I'm\nused to it more so that's why I'm not\nreally afraid of it like when you talked\nearlier about this like sea of anger\nthat you might have I resonated a lot\nwith me but uh yeah I'm not afraid of it\ncan you tell us about a little bit about\nhow your relationship with Aaron your\nyour sea of anger has changed over time\na lot of it was there was always like a\nfocal point to it when I was younger it\nwas like my circumstances and other\npeople and when I got a little bit older\nit turned into me and y'all just get\nstuck in like this whirlpool\nswirling around and it ends it's just\nalways centered on you and then I hit a\npoint in my life where I just like hit\nrock bottom so hard that it bounced off\nthe floor and kind of broke who I was\nand my ego and once that happens it was\njust like all the raging waters of anger\njust sort of like calmed down I was able\nto just be yes that that resonates Arlo\nin the sense of like you said that you\nsort of directed out yourself and I'm\nwondering if that's because you did that\ncome from you not wanting to hurt other\npeople so you felt if I'm gonna hurt\nanyone it's gonna be myself is that what\nokay yeah oh yeah that makes a lot yeah\nthat resonates like really deeply yes I\nwas so scared of hurting others and like\nI still have that like innate fear that\nI can be like a little insensitive or I\ncan like what the switch then all of a\nsudden I'm like this just evil person\nand I can just hate everyone and\neverything and I won't care about anyone\nbut I guess you start to realize that uh\nI don't know you everything just seems\nto calm down\nonce you find those connections with\npeople and the more that you find is the\nmore that it seems to like calm the\nwaters when I was uh when I was fifteen\nmy plan was like I felt like all I was\nwas just a ball of suffering and I felt\nlike a ticking time bomb and I thought\nif I go on living like this and I go on\ntrying to interact with people I'm just\ngoing to spread as much suffering into\nthe world as possible so the most\nproductive solution I saw in my fifteen\nyear old brain was I'm just gonna\nisolate myself completely from everyone\nsever ties be annoying because if I'm\nthis ticking time bomb the best thing I\ncan do is kill myself so to minimize the\nimpact of my death I'll just push\neveryone as far away as possible to the\npoint where everyone forgets about me\nbecause the further they are from the\nexplosion the less hurt they are and I\nthought this that in the short term\nsuicide would hurt other people more but\nin the long run I would prevent any\nfurther damage that I could do to people\nbut I've since kind of I've sat with\nthat that self-hate for so\nlong in like the last month I've kind of\ngotten just sick of it to the point\nwhere off like the first time in 18\nyears of my life I actually am trying to\nbe my own advocate and view myself as a\nperson that's worthy of happiness\nbecause I never thought it was yeah I\nwant to relate that to that just a bit\nlike yesterday there was events going in\nmy house that were triggering me and you\nknow usually I would just kind of\nabandon my inner child but then\nyesterday I just kind of like try to\nsoothe myself and be my own advocate be\nmy own friend and just like be there for\nmyself and kind of let the outer\ntriggering shitty world kind of fade out\nand just be there with myself and like\nyou know take care of my my inner you\nknow just take care of myself like my\ninner child like like Tony it's it's\nalright man I'm with you man I'm gonna\ntake care of you like it's gonna be\n[ __ ] shitty outside but I'm here for\nyou yeah yeah I'm glad to hear them\nactually and if you don't mind you said\nthat your ego you had to experience that\nbrokered ego and then everything calmed\ndown can you just give a um I'm not sure\nhow into detail I can go into it on\nstreem other than volts yeah it's um I\nhad two very near-death experiences and\nI guess that puts a lot of pressure on\nthe mind and it just sort of um it was\nalmost like flicking a switch and\neverything just seemed to calm down\nalmost like an apathetic state but\nbecause I wasn't like born apathetic i\nstoled like knew what emotions were I\nwas I've been able to like slowly like\nreintroduce myself\nmature way like how to process emotions\nout to you like be frustrated instead of\nlike raging you like be just like sad\nand be able to grieve instead of just\nbeing like writhing and despair just\nlike being able to tone back the\nextremities of those emotions and also\nturn back the Messiah Complex that I had\nthanks for sharing your I want to just\nkind of so I have man so many questions\nso first is like we're talking about\nsome dark [ __ ] how do you guys feel good\nSara oh good I feel good I feel great\nweird good yeah like this is some real I\nmean this is some dark stuff right and\neven ghosts even has his SIF lighting on\nso I mean we're talking about this you\nknow we're talking about the Maori\nJedi's okay\nso we're talking about you know\ndifferent we're talking about just a lot\nof bad stuff and yet have you guys seen\nthe comments from the YouTube the\ncomments to the YouTube video of our\nlast session\nnot particularly no so I don't usually\nlook at like our own social media cuz I\njust try to steer clear of it but that\nis some of the most inspiring [ __ ] I've\never seen can you give like in it's hard\nto describe just just the overwhelming\namount of positivity and hope that the\nlast stream is created from for random\npeople who comment on YouTube videos is\nstaggering and oh my YouTube comments\nare accessible so that's that's good to\nhit I've just as stunned as you are\nright so like you you take a place like\nYouTube and like you guys know what\nYouTube comments are like right it's\nlike worse than twitch at its the\nunderbelly of society it's the worst and\nthen you take a group of people talking\nabout porn addiction and you stick that\non YouTube and you expect you know just\nthe cesspool of the cessful like for all\nthe people who live in the cesspool\nyou go into their septic tank and that's\nwhat it should create yeah and yet\nsomehow something something very strange\nis happening here that you guys are\ntalking about some really dark and bad\n[ __ ] right you're talking about being\ntornadoes of destruction for the people\naround you you guys are talking about\ngas lighting and abuse and you know\nbeing angry and suicidal and and nearly\ndying and you know walking to death's\ndoor and cracking it open a little bit\nand peeking through into seeing what's\non the other side and yet you all feel\nok you all feel good we've got ghosts\nwho's terrified that no one is ever\ngonna understand him because he doesn't\nunderstand himself and then like the\nrest of us are just like scratching our\nheads were like we get you dude like we\nunderstand who you are\nand it's it's so confusing to him and I\nI mean I'm sure that all of you guys are\nreally good at bullshitting I'm sure all\nof you guys are really good at lying but\nI also think that y'all are really good\nat sniffing out other people's [ __ ]\nand I think if there was someone who's\nboth bullshitting in here we would be\nable to sniff him out pretty quick you\ncan't create what's happening here if\nthere's someone who's full of [ __ ] right\nso there's something really like special\ngoing on and by the way we're supposed\nto be talking about relationships so I'm\ngonna switch back there so I'm gonna\nquickly I think I'm gonna pat ourselves\non the back because you know the reason\nI think the reason why the cesspool of\nYouTube comments were positive is\nbecause when when you can own who you\nare it's respectable it means you have\nyou know you have balls you know so I\nthink it's that's why I think I love you\nguys because you guys own it too and\nthen we're doing it together so yeah\nthat's that's a win for me yeah man Tony\nthanks for your repeated suppose are at\nthe positivity dude sometimes I want to\nbe a therapist too but uh I guess my\nmoving lot moves on I think you'd be\ngood at attorney\nyou're like a calming presence so I just\nwant to acknowledge a couple things one\nis that you know so we've had some\nsupposed to topics that we're supposed\nto talk about but I just want to point\nout that we're like kind of all over the\nplace but I don't think it's really that\nwe're all over the place I think it's\njust that like things are not things\ndon't stay in their buckets so what when\nI when I when I hear you guys talk about\nrelationships what I really hear is\nthere's themes of fear first of all and\nmost predominantly and secondly like\nlike being afraid of like hurting other\npeople and probably something about you\ndon't want to subject people to the\nperson that you are\nI'm hearing that as well and you know in\nthe case of you know I think this\napplies to I'm not getting that from\nBayer which i think is completely fine\nso I don't think everyone has to have\nthe same experience but I think it bears\ncase it sounds like he was just really\nin a toxic relationship and it sounds\nlike you guys have all had toxic\nrelationships and also you know what I\nam I don't know if I'm really surprised\nby this or not but like a lot of times\nwhen we think about gamers or people on\nTwitter like our people like the problem\nis not that the relationships are full\nof hurt or fear or pain or toxicity it's\nthat they just can't find them and so\nI'm in that group you want to share a\nlittle bit about what that's been like\noh I kind of just did this self but now\nI'm kind of zoning out because I kind of\nput all my attention on the superhero\ncomplex we're trying to trying to kind\nof digest it have you yeah I'm\ndefinitely level one in that arena and I\nI definitely want to be that perfect guy\ngoing into it so um I understand that\nnow so I just accept the reality that\nI'm just level one and that I've also\nhaven't looked for any relationship so\nyou know I can't complain it's just\nsomething I might got to yet so that's\nthat's where I'm at and yeah so I'm just\ntrying to think about because we're\ngonna have to wrap up it a little bit if\nthere's something that we can try to\nlike tie together or take home about\nrelationships and I realize we haven't\nreally done it justice so I was gonna\njust kind of you know so we can do a\ncouple things and I'll leave it to you\nguys to decide we can just kind of\ncontinue to talk sort of open forum\nbecause I think there's a lot of value\nand we're uncovering a lot or what we\ncan do is you know pick one or two\nthings to try to like probably one thing\nto explore and really come away with\nsome sense of understanding about like\nhow that one thing works what do you\nguys think would be a better use of our\ntime\nmaybe focus on the one thing I think the\none thing and he is usually the one\nthing tends to be just a mindset or\nrecognizing or be mindful of a state\nthat we're in I want to tie it down to a\npractice so that we stick to that one\nthing and that we embody that one thing\nover and over again or that we you know\nmitigate any triggers that remove us\nfrom that one thing okay you know yeah I\ngot very practical mmm take away tying\nto that one thing okay yeah sure so I'm\na fan of trying to keep things practical\nas well so I'd like to offer something\nfor our one thing which is that why do\nyou feel like you need to be perfect can\nwe understand why you feel like you need\nto be level 100 before you enter a\nrelationship and what does that do to\nyou what does that do to your prospects\nfor a relationship like where does that\ncome from\nwhat do you guys think about that is a\ntopic I think that's a good topic does\nanybody else have suggestions for what\nto talk about works for me so let's\nstart with so why do you guys where does\nthat feeling so you guys so who here\nfeels like they want to be someone else\nbefore they engage in a relationship my\ncaveat is\nI just want to be myself again once I\ncould be myself again can I know I've\nbeen there like once I'm myself then I\nknow it can be a pretty decent guy but\nthere's just thing I just I'm in a\nsituation where I'm not for myself okay\nso why do you guys what is it that you\nwant to be before you enter a\nrelationship successful the idea why is\nit important to be what what if you were\nsuccessful bear what would that change\nabout how you approach relationships it\nwould change my mentality of status and\nhow I would value myself and how I feel\nlike other people would would value me\nuh-huh how would you change how would it\nchange how you value yourself\nI could reflect on all the there it'd be\neasier for me to reflect on all the good\nthat I've done knowing that it's it's\nactually viable it's a versus what I\nhave now\nokay and how would that change your\nperception of how other people would see\nyou well I'm I'm heavily influenced by\nhow people see me\nand the way they see me now is not I\nguess not the best and then once I get\nto that that point success surely the\nthat view would change but there's no I\nguess a hundred percent confidence\nbehind that what what do you mean by not\nthe best how do they see you now\nuh I just graduated no job just kind of\nsitting at home playing video games do\nnothing so how do they see what does\nthat mean unsuccessful I guess when you\nguys think about how do you get okay so\nlet's just leave it at that so I'm gonna\nask a couple other people right so\nRichard what would you like to be before\nyou enter into a relationship I get this\nsense that I'm not sure I I would love\nto be in a relationship it's just I\ndon't I don't know I'm not sure I'm no\nI'm just level zero at this point\ngood answer so I think if you're not if\nyou're not sure about something you\nshould just say that so I'm gonna just\nbounce around because I'm gonna try to\npull out themes okay so ghosts what\nwould you like to be different before\nyou enter a relationship I'm kind of\nthinking of two different answers okay\none of them is whole but that reminds me\nof when you were talking to reckful\nabout borderline personality disorder\nthat it's like it's hard to it's like\nthe whole kind of comes after but I'm\nnot sure I want to subject someone to\nmyself when I'm not whole and then\nthere's another part of me that's saying\nI'm not even sure that I want to be in a\nrelationship because I feel like I'm so\nI never want to be tied down to anything\nbecause it makes me feel trapped and I\nalways want to be able to take flight if\nI need to\nbut maybe that's something really\nunhealthy and maybe that's rooted in\nsomething yeah that's how I feel what\nhave you felt trapped before yeah\nyeah quite a lot I kind of um I'm\nrealizing that I'm really good at\nsetting boundaries without even\nrealizing like I just don't let people\nin because I I like unless they're\nstrangers on I don't like syrup\nyeah I don't know what that is I feel\nlike it feels like there's a part of me\nthat's dominant all of the time and then\nthe part of me that's not dominant seize\nthis opportunity and it's like well if\nthere's gonna be one opportunity like\nthis is the time to strike and regain\ncontrol of myself\nokay um yeah it feels like I'm I don't\nknow that I want to surrender control to\nanother person I like to be in control\nof my own life and I feel like I had a\nreally mmm okay someone I know will be\nwatching this but I don't care I'm gonna\nsay I had a really abusive upbringing\nand I had like really severe sort of\nlike strict like tyranny I guess and\nthat's sort of always fueled this need\nto feel free and I just I can't feel\ntrapped because it's the worst thing in\nthe world to me and I'd rather have\nnothing and be free than have something\nand be trapped sure\nTony you said that you want to be\nyourself again can you help us\nunderstand who you are now and how\nyou're different from yourself yeah\nsometimes like like go said like when if\nhe's if he feels whole again then you\nknow he'd be it'd be all right it I\nthink in relationship or it may be more\nopen to the idea of being with [ __ ] when\nhe's whole because for me it's like I\ndon't like it when I try to hide parts\nof myself you know I have my weaknesses\nor hide my mistakes or hide little\nthings that I'm not proud of I don't I\ndon't like the sense of hiding so once I\nand once I can overcome those things\nthat I'm trying to hide that I don't\nneed to hide anymore right then I could\njust be me absolutely authentic yeah\nfree you know and and I I want to be\nfree you know as opposed to be being was\ncalled chained down to little petty bits\nwith shame whether they're petty or\ndeep-rooted and I just want to be free\nand like she'll be me you know you could\nprobably enough yeah that's me yeah so\nthe first thing that I want to say is\nthat you know I'm just really surprised\nby how reasonable when everyone else\nwhat everyone is saying is right\nmaybe surprise isn't really the right\nword but like I just want to acknowledge\nbecause I think it's significant that\nyou know these are not these are very\nreal challenges that you guys face real\nexperiences that you all have had this\nis not like some kind of cognitive bias\nthis is I mean there may be elements of\ndepression and stuff like that but you\nknow when we're dealing with something\nlike depression or anxiety like the\nbasic problem is that the thoughts that\nyour mind has are wrong right so like if\nyou have social anxiety and you think\neveryone hates you like that's a wrong\nthought\nthe first thing that I kind of want to\nacknowledge is that I don't think that\nthey're like wrong thoughts here I think\neach of what you guys want before you're\nready for a relationship\nis very like legitimate and real right\nthis isn't pathology on your part it's\njust you wanting to be in a different\nplace in your life now I think there are\na couple of things that I would I'm just\ngonna start talking if that's okay\nbecause we've got about maybe 5 to 10\nminutes left the first thing is I think\nall of you guys are thinking that in\norder for you to have the perfect\nrelationship you have to be the perfect\nperson and I think the subtle thing that\nhas been unsaid all along here is that\nwhat y'all are looking for is a perfect\nrelationship right because you're\nenvisioning that if you are a certain\nway then the relationship is going to be\na certain way you guys see that y'all\nthink about that it's an unrealistic\nexpectation did you guys realize that\nthat was what your expectation was um\nkind of it reminds me of a scene from\nGood Will Hunting I don't know if\nanyone's seen it but like there's a\nscene where the main character is saying\nthat he doesn't want to call it go back\nbecause right now in his head she's\nperfect then he doesn't want to find out\nand ruin it and then his therapist says\nmaybe you're perfect to her right now\nand then he says it's not a matter of\nwhether you're perfect or she's perfect\nbut whether or not you're perfect for\neach other\nand whether or not you click with your\nimperfections so maybe that's like the\nmost authentic thing you can hope for\nyeah so I think the the subtle thing\nhere is that you guys are wanting to be\nperfect because you're envisioning so\nlike you're envisioning this perfect\nrelationship and for that perfect\nrelationship to succeed you have to be a\nparticular thing\nright that's what you're really because\nyou're saying like okay I'm there's this\nthing in my there's this fantasy in my\nmind and unless I am that thing I'm\ngoing to screw it up this is cue all the\nthoughts about I am a tornado of death\nand I hurt I don't want to hurt other\npeople if I'm not confident in myself I\nmay be attracting the wrong kind of\nperson who's narcissistic and gaslight\nme and all that kind of [ __ ] you know\nlike there are all of these like\nreasonable thoughts that are ending up\nwith this sort of like flawed premise\nthat you guys are looking for a perfect\nrelationship and for the record I don't\nI don't know that you guys are ready for\na real relationship yet but I do think\nthat it's important to remember that you\nknow good relationships in my opinion\nare defined not because the people that\nlike the good relationships are not the\nones that people and enter into when\nthey're perfect the good relationship is\nthe one where the person that you're\nwith helps you become the starting point\nthat you guys are looking for that's a\ngood relationship right so like I can\nrelate a lot to what Baer was saying\npersonally because my relationship\nstarted when I was in no one and and\nthankfully my wife like stuck with me\nlike so we started dating when I was a\njunior in college and then you know I\ngraduated after five years in college\nand then for the next four years like\nshe continued to stick with me even\nthough she had many better options and I\nwasn't making any money I wasn't you\nknow I was just a guy who graduated\nthree years ago with a biology degree in\na 2.5 GPA like that's a no one in life\nlike that like you know bear just\ngraduated it's just like three years\nlater I'm exactly where Bear is today\nand and she's stuck with me and so you\nknow was she perfect absolutely not was\nI perfect absolutely not\nand so I'd encourage you guys to think a\nlittle bit about you know when you are\ntrying to be this perfect person because\nyou don't want to hurt people this once\nagain is like as you guys said that's\nevasion tanking right so I think part of\nwhat a relationship a good relationship\nis about is that you actually do\nhurt other people like that's something\nyou have to accept from the get-go and\nthat other people are gonna hurt you\nthe question is what happens when\nsomeone takes damage you know do they do\nthey Gaslight everyone around you -\ndogpile you and make you feel like a\npiece of [ __ ] that's a relationship that\nneeds to end\nor do they apologize and like try to\nhelp you grow and try to grow themselves\nare they willing to stick with you while\nyou're exploring all the layers to your\nown onion because you don't know who you\nare and be sort of a stable force are\nthey willing to be patient with you\nwhile you figure your own [ __ ] out which\nI'm eternally grateful to my wife\nbecause she was I didn't know who the\n[ __ ] I was and she was like kind of okay\nwith that and and so I think the last\nthing to understand is that you guys are\nstriving to be perfect before you enter\nthis relationship you want to be level\n100 but you're actually setting like a\nvery dangerous expectation for the other\nperson which is to expect perfection\nfrom you that's a relationship that's\ngonna fail because this Thunder this set\nis up here yeah so then when you fall\nbelow it you're not meeting your own\nstandards absolutely it's gonna be false\nadvertising too because you guys are\nnever gonna be level 100 it's just not\ngonna happen\nyou can also like a full buck you could\neven go back they can release expansions\nand raise the level cap that's actually\nwhat happens right so as you get better\nyou become\nI mean dissatisfaction has nothing to do\nwith where you are in life like I work\nwith people that are wildly successful\nand equally dissatisfied is like you\nknow the people I work with on you know\non twitch like gamers and average people\nand neat people like any et people and\nstuff like that it's all it's all about\nattitude and self-satisfaction\nso I'd really encourage you guys to\nthink a lot about this idea of like you\nknow I want to be perfect before I enter\na relationship so I think it like I said\nso the first thing is it comes from a\nvery normal place that you guys really\ndo want to make some changes about\nyourself I think all of the things that\nyou guys want to accomplish are\nreasonable goals the only issue that I\ntake is that just because you haven't\nmet those goals doesn't mean that you're\nnot ready for a relationship actually I\nmean you're not ready but that doesn't\nmean that it isn't a good idea the last\nthing is I don't think you need to be\nright I mean I [ __ ] wasn't ready for\na relationship do you think you can ever\nreally be ready\nno and this goes this goes back to the\nidea of you can only be what you are\nright so the last thing that I'm gonna\nleave you guys with is something even\nmore confusing a little bit spiritual\nwhich is the concept of Karma\nso your karma did I mean so you guys\ndon't have to believe this but just just\nto think about it so I I don't think\nabout karma as being right or wrong I\nthink about it as a framework that can\nhelp us understand certain things about\nour life so like we were each given a\nhand of cards to play the game of life\nand that's our Karma I'm not saying it\nwas determined by God or anything like\nthat I'm just saying that our\ncircumstances are unique and our\ncircumstances form us into the people\nthat we are today and so you guys can't\nbe anything but what you were so ghost\nhas this issue about feeling trapped\nbecause you grew up in a tyrannical\nhousehold like you can't undo that you\ndon't get to re-roll right so that's\njust what you deal with\nthat's your karma and also to understand\nthat you can't expect yourself to be\nfree of that you can't hold yourself to\na standard of not being paranoid to\nbeing trapped because that's what you\n[ __ ] are you're paranoid of being\ntrapped so be it that's the hand that\nyou were dealt that's your karma so play\nthat hand it doesn't mean that you can't\nwin the game\nand so whether it's a couple of\nnear-death experiences a narcissistic\npartner who gaslighted everyone around\nyou you know non-ideal modeling for what\na relationship looks like or a fear of\nbeing trapped and paranoid or even not\neven knowing what you want from a\nrelationship because your level zero all\nof those are your gut Irma's those are\nyour unique set of circumstances you\ncan't be anything but what you are\nbecause that's the hand that you were\ngiven and you've made choices in the\npast but just because those choices were\na mistake before doesn't change the fact\nthat you made those mistakes and you\nhave to deal with that [ __ ] today right\nso you like even today every day you\nhave the hand of cards that you sort of\ndetermined the day before and the day\nbefore the day before and you can regret\nplaying that hand a particular way but\nyou still have to deal with the\naftermath of who you are today which is\nimperfect\nand not ready and completely ok thoughts\nor questions before we wrap up I was\njust a quick question on that yeah so\nthe conversation was unraveling I saw\nmyself really pushing forward to an idea\nof like a perfect loving family like two\nkids is uh is that a perfect\nrelationship or is it is I guess my main\nquestion is is there a difference\nbetween loving and perfect what do you\nguys think so is that like a good a good\npursuit a good goal a good maybe maybe\nthat's not the right link so I'm gonna\nsort of turn that question on its head I\nthink what's perfect is what is\nright so like if you walk outside and\nyou look at a flower that flower cannot\nbe anything but what it is it can't be\nin a different place it can't be a\ndifferent color so if you really look at\nit from a yogic perspective the idea of\nperfection is just a false thing because\nthe only thing that is is what is you\ncan't stop making it rain you can't you\nknow change the person that you are so\nin a sense you are perfect\nso is it like don't concern yourself\nwith that which you can't control like\njust release any ideas about something\nthat's out of your control completely\nyeah so just be the person that you are\nand do the best that you can and in\nterms of having goals I think generally\nspeaking we have goals when we have very\nlittle information right so my\nperception of what good and healthy\nmarriage is like when I started out I\nhad no clue and I think one of the\nbiggest mistakes that people make is\nthey like they come up with checklists\nright they're like I want my partner to\nbe a B and C and generally speaking the\nmore that they adhere to the checklist\njust what I've seen in terms of you know\nmy friends and people who are my age who\nget married and don't get married and\nend up in happy relationships and don't\nend up in happy relationships is the\npeople who are obsessed with checklists\nand like meeting a certain standard are\nthe ones who tend to get divorced or not\nbe married\nit's the people who actually like just\nabout every relationship so when I work\nwith people you know in in my practice I\nsee a lot of healthy relationships and\nall of them are like deeply flawed at\nthe very beginning it's like people\ngetting together with people that they\nreally should not get together with\nright so like you know asking an 18 year\nold to marry you when you work at\nChili's seems like a terrible idea\nand it is a terrible idea but bizarrely\nenough girl's parents were okay with it\nand they're like happily married now\nwhat is this something like eighteen\nyears later right so like don't expect\ndon't set up in your mind what a perfect\nperson or perfect relationship looks\nlike because you just don't know like\nwell the perfect relationship is the one\nthat's right for you\nand that that one you know I think\nyou'll know it when you see it but you\nhave to give yourself a chance the one\nthing that I would encourage you guys to\ndo is just if you're not ready for a\nrelationship that's completely\nreasonable you know if you have some\nstuff that you want to work on stuff\nlike that but I was I mean I started I\nmet my wife when I was convinced I was\ngonna become a monk and be celibate for\nthe rest of my life so that was just\nterrible I mean was a terrible idea for\neveryone involved\nand you were confused yeah I got\nconfused and it was great\nlike I'm so glad cuz man I just I if\nthat had not happened I would not have\nrecognized the depth of my idiocy and\nthat has gotten me to appreciate so much\nabout how stupid human beings can\nactually be and it also gives me\ncompassion for the dumbest human beings\non the planet which allows me to talk to\npeople on Twitch\ncuz that's usually yeah if you hadn't\nmet your wife and you had become a monk\ndo you think you would have lived a\nhappy life and that version of you would\nnow still be glad of making that choice\nI do you think you just have to accept\nwhichever path you end up taking I think\nthere's only one path okay right so I\nhere's our meditation practice for the\nday so we can do mula bandha again you\nguys remember mula bandha yeah so mula\nbandha is so we're gonna contract the\nperineum which you guys can you know try\nthis at home if you want to but\nokay so mula bandha is is so Tony and\nbare so you guys know how to flex your\npenis up so go ahead and pull that\nmuscle and notice when you pull that\nmuscle that your anus contracts this I'm\nnot trawling you guys seriously it's\njust it's really not trolling you kegels\nright giggles yeah kegels exactly\nso basically mula bandha is contracting\nthat muscle for a period of like three\nto five seconds and then relaxing and\nthen contracting and relaxing so let's\npractice so contract one two three and\nrelax and then contract again one two\nthree relax\ncontract one two three\nrelax good so continue practicing for\nlet's say another thirty Seconds good so\nI have another meditation practice for\nyou guys so this one that's a little bit\nmore contemplative this is gonna sound\nkind of weird but I want you guys to go\noutside and look at a plant and then ask\nyourself is that plant perfect\nand could that plant be anything else\nand I know you can think of an answer as\nyou sit here and you imagine the\nscenario but part of a meditative\npractices actually go outside and look\nat it and contemplate it and use that\nsensory experience okay\nhow you guys feeling good tom you guys\nhow do you all feel about your future\nconfident\nghosts are you ever gonna get to the\nbottom of the onion shark huh Shrek I\nthink yeah I think I am okay bear are\nyou gonna be successful just long as I\ntake the stuff Sunday - right yep the\nonly steps you can't take one layer at a\ntime one layer at a time\nnow I'll build donkey that'll do so\nhe'll do I don't have you know specific\nquestions for each and every one of you\nbut I think let me just see what I can\npull out so if for Aaron I guess my\nquestion is is death inevitable are you\ngonna drown be honest one day in the\nvery very very far future well when the\ntime is right but when the time is right\nperfect time because there's only one\nthought yeah I have too many things too\nmany ambitions good so try to\ntrying to fulfill what you can and then\nyou'll learn how to let go of the rest\ndr. K can I ask you a question was there\nanything that you wanted you noticed\nthat you were there any questions that\nweren't that we didn't have time for\nthat you wanted to bring up just so\nyelling a thousand but I think that's\nokay right so I I think we we got to the\nquestions that we needed to today and I\nhave Rosen ambitions as well I have all\nkinds of things that I jotted down that\nI wanted to ask you guys about and what\ndo you know those we didn't have time\nfor those those questions are\nunfulfilled we may never get to them and\nyet this conversation was perfect it's\nwhat it needed to be and you guys are\nwhat you need to be and that's that's\njust how it works so take comfort in the\nfact that that's just that's how it\nworks guys we couldn't have asked any\nmore questions and we couldn't have\nasked any fewer we asked them you'd go\ninsane if you tried to change like if\nyou try to really focus on those things\nand didn't just see it as perfect as is\nvery well said ghost why the [ __ ] do you\nthink everyone is going crazy because\nthat\nwhich you try to like that's what you\ntry to do in your life right just think\nabout that for a second you try to salt\nyou try to ask all the questions you try\nto fulfill all the ambitions you try to\nbe the perfect person for a relationship\nand then everyone goes insane like why\ndid why do you guys think this is so\nsuccessful on Twitch it's because\neveryone is doing what goes to sync\nright so the biggest problem with\nmankind is that their ambition is\nlimitless and their capability is\nlimited if always like before more\nchange change change go out and see even\nwith with Tony it's like change I don't\nneed to change a whole lot I just need\nto change a little bit still a problem\nso go out and look at your plant and\ngood luck guys and yeah thank you very\nmuch for coming on today thank you very\nmuch for sharing asking questions being\npresent being what you were supposed to\nbe yeah thank you thank you everyone\nactually I wanna hold you guys I'll\nmaybe I'll get in touch with you guys\nand maybe we can be accountability\nbuddies just to do our kegels and Bobby\nit it'll be fun\nthis is an invitational all right guys\ntake care\nstrong guys good luck everyone okay so\nguys thank you very much for coming I\ndon't know how much of that people were\nable to keep up with but yeah so I think\nyou know one thing that I just wanted to\nsay for a second is that I think that\nthis actually highlights a little bit\nabout why I think our coaching program\nis like actually gonna be pretty good\nbecause I think you know we have all\nthese problems that we think we have but\nthe solutions tend to be like a lot\nwider and deeper and broader I think\nthings are related in in terms of our\nmind and stuff and so my hope is that I\nmean so my question is how do we help\npeople explore this kind of stuff and\nand that's where I think like that my\nhope is that the coaching program works\nso we'll see\nbut you know if you guys are feeling\nstuck in a particular area of your life\ndon't be so restrictive is to think that\nthe solution to that problem is like\nfixing that problem when we talked about\nrelationships for example you know they\nyou know there are all kinds of there's\nall kinds of relationship advice you can\ngive people I think the real challenge\nis is in recognizing that you know what\nthese people are struggling with is like\nfear of who they are and that they're\nnot going to be good enough in a\nrelationship for someone else\nand they're not going to be good enough\nin a relationship for someone else right\nso successful relationships people grow\nand learn how to get better at them so\nyou're not like I mean you start off\nwith low XP and then you like level up\nwith someone and if things worked out\nthen you guys like stay with them and\nand that's great so if you guys think\nthat you know your problem is video game\naddiction or your problem is this or\nyour problem is that like do yourself\nthe benefit do yourself the benefit of\ndigging a little bit deeper and seeing\nif there's something related to it right\nis this an issue of confidence is this\nan issue of like you know I don't want\nto be successful because even if I'm\nsuccessful I'm never going to live up to\nthe fantasy that I have in my mind\nthat's a big one that people are not\nwilling to they say oh I'm unemployed I\ndon't have a job I sit at home all day\nand they can go out and get a job but\nthey don't want to get a job because the\njob that they're gonna get is gonna be\nshameful right it doesn't live up to\ntheir standard like yeah I'm happy to be\nan entrepreneur but I don't want to work\nfor someone else so be careful about\nyour ego and the standards that you set\nyourself and what you believe is is your\nproblem and what you believe your\nsolution is because it may be very\ndifferent from what you think\nso thank you guys very much thank you\nall for all of the support you know\nwe'll see what the YouTube comments for\nthis would look like if you guys did\ncomment on the YouTube video thank you\nvery much for the positive
