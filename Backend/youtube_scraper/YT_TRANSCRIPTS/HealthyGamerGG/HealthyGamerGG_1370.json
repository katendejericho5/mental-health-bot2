    "transcript": "so we have hid miraculously like eight\nweeks after we started streaming okay so\nguys like this this we have to talk\nabout actually so I just want to say\nfirst of all thank you guys very much I\nforgot about this\nso we've hit like 100,000 followers on\nTwitter like eight weeks or 10 weeks\nafter we started stream like we started\nstreaming in September or October or\nsomething and so it's been like three to\nfour months and our stream really picked\nup about two months ago\nso we've hit already a hundred thousand\nfollowers on Twitch and a hundred\nthousand subscribers on YouTube which is\namazing and so like I think that we so\njust so you guys know so healthy gamer\nhas been around for a little over a year\nand we've been like sort of a volunteer\nkind of project so we've got five people\nthat have been volunteering and we\nstarted with you know in over the course\nof maybe 2000 the first eight months of\n2019 we got a hundred subscribers on\nYouTube and we had an average of like 20\nto 30 viewers on Twitch and so and we've\ngrown a lot since then so first of all I\nwant to thank you guys for showing up\nsubscribing supporting us\nwe're number 135 on the fastest growing\nEnglish twitch streamers over the last\n180 days and number 47 in the last 90 so\nthat's been just absolutely crazy so\nlike our growth has been awesome and\nI've been really grateful for it because\nnow you know we've got a team of people\nthat are helping us like produce more\ncontent and like making other kinds of\ncontent that may not be related to\nYouTube it's been just an incredible and\nunbelievable experience\nso a couple of other things so healthy\ngamer has been so we kind of started the\ntwitch stuff around 2019 but we actually\nstarted our original alpha group back in\n2018 and what I had done is is started\nwith this was sort of after the reddit\nAMA I don't know if you guys saw this\nback in 2018 but I did an AMA about\nvideo game addiction and so I had a\ngroup of about 15 people that reached\nout to me and we actually started\nrunning a group so every week I spent\none hour with like the same group of\npeople and we would talk about video\ngame addiction we would talk about our\nlives and we talk about our minds we\nwould talk about meditation and I worked\nwith people every week over the course\nof a year and that was like our alpha\ngroup and so that group went really well\npeople I think really did a phenomenal\njob some of the volunteers that have\nactually joined healthy gamer came out\nof that group and so it was a lot of fun\nto kind of work with people\nlongitudinally and then we realized that\nlike over time you know so what I was\nworking with people presumably this was\na group about video game addiction but\nover time we began to realize that like\nit's not really just about being\naddicted to the game it's that people\ndon't understand like mental health that\nmental health the face of mental health\nis changing right so like the needs and\npressures that are on our minds have\nchanged because of things like social\nmedia because of things like being\nunable to escape bullies like when I was\nin school you know I would get bullied\nin school and then I would go home and\nthen I wouldn't see the bully anymore\nbut now thanks to social media and\nInstagram and Twitter and things like\nthat bullying is like 24/7 and so we\nneed a new perspective on mental health\nlike the kinds of challenges that people\nare facing gamers and also non gamers\nbecause I guess a bunch of non gamers\nare watching our stream now which is\nbizarre so I recently got a message from\nsomeone in India who is like not a gamer\nat all but has started watching our\nstreams and so we've just we're\nspreading really wide\nand so so this this stream has really\nevolved into really helping people\nunderstand like evolving issues and\nnuances around mental health that I\ndon't think that a psychiatric model is\nsufficient anymore right so it's not\njust about getting diagnosed with\ndepression and taking an antidepressant\nlike that's not going to fix your life\nso we as we sort of grew and as I began\nto realize that we you know wanted to\nlike reach a broader audience and that\nwhat we were talking about was really\nimportant we turned to twitch and and so\nwe started streaming which is insane so\nI got a lot of feedback for many of my\ncolleagues that this is crazy you can't\nbe a psychiatrist or doctor and like\nstart talking to people on the internet\nand so yeah so I think that that was you\nknow so we tried an experiment I think\nDevin Nash was instrumental actually in\ngetting us off the ground and helping us\ndevelop a stream and things like that so\nhuge thanks to Devin if you guys don't\nknow who Devin is he's been in the\neSports industry for many many years and\nproduces actually a lot of content that\nI have found more and more interesting\nas I've gotten into streaming so he\ntalks a lot about the scene the industry\na lot about kind of streaming he runs a\ntalent agency and Devin was amazing in\nsupportive and I sort of began to\nrealize or like he helped me realize\nthat like we can actually reach a lot of\npeople through twitch streaming and so I\nthink another thing that I kind of want\nto comment on is like that sort of\nstarted our journey and we've gotten so\nmuch help from a ton of people in terms\nof like advice like domination time has\nbeen awesome in terms of helping us like\nhe told me like what to order in terms\nof you know how to set up microphones\nand things like that and as we've talked\nto more and more streamers like the\nspread of our AoE has increased and\nthat's been awesome so like other\nstreamers that I just want to thank for\nsort of helping us understand twitch and\nhelping us grow destiny Athene and shout\nouts to like lily Pichu reckful Skye\nWilliams Mitch Jones Bobbi\nEthan Evans these people have been just\nincredibly\namazing and brave for coming on and then\nalso like all of the people who aren't\nstreamers right so whether it starts\nwith people like madame Fey or donut\nmuncher or boole's\nall of these people crus if I mean there\nhave been so many people have been\nwilling to come on everyone who came on\nfor of all things the porn addiction\nstream and and you know it this stream\nhas been built off of y'all so I think\nthat a lot of people think that healthy\ngamer is about dr. K but it's not\nactually about me like I don't I don't\nknow how else to say that so you guys\nrealize that like you know I'm basically\na facilitator but all of the things like\nthe AoE healing actually comes from the\npeople who come on stream like you guys\nget this like this is important to\nunderstand I'm not actually healing\nanyone right it's the people who are\ncoming on and sharing their struggles\nthe people who are being courageous and\noffering themselves up in terms of their\nmind and what they struggle with and as\nthey like work through that stuff that's\nwhat's helpful for people right so it's\nnot me like I don't you guys are not\nresonating with me you guys are\nresonating with the people who come on\nstream and so I think that that like\nhuge huge thanks to everyone who has\ncome on stream everyone who has\nvolunteered to come on stream all of the\npeople who have helped us get to where\nwe are people who edit our YouTube and\npeople who even like comment and stuff\non YouTube like that's huge people who\nyou know posts on our subreddit and and\nlike hang out on our discord like our\ndiscord is like an amazing place now and\nso like I want to stress this like more\nand more and more that healthy gamers\nlike really not about me it's not it's\nabout you guys and y'all are the ones\nthat are really making this happen and\nwhether your support is by watching\nwhether it's by subscribing or donating\nor anything like that whether it's\nhanging out on discord whether it's\nposting on on reddit like wherever it is\nwherever you guys like you guys are\nbuilding this that's what a healthy game\nwas really about and so I think a couple\nof other things it's been an interesting\njourney so the funny thing that started\nto happen is when we talk about\nstreamers like when I talk to streamers\nthey sort of\nabout the feeling of needing to perform\nand I also sort of felt that struggle\npersonally so I started like noticing\nthat my viewercount started mattering to\nme and I would check my viewer account\nand I would check like I would just log\non at random times to see like how many\nfollowers we have on Twitch and I\nstarted to like feel this pull towards\nlike wanting to be bigger and I think\nthat that's really dangerous and I\nactually don't I mean do I want to grow\nabsolutely but I don't think that this\nis about the growth of our stream right\nlike that's not actually what we should\ncare about and what I it's not what I\nwant to care about I think we've got to\nremember that healthy gamer is actually\nnot about how big we are not about how\nsuccessful we are it's really about you\nguys so healthy gamer is about the\nindividual person that each stream you\nknow we talk to you like it's about that\nperson and it's about you guys for\nwatching and so you know the goal of\nthis and I hope we really straight to\nstay true to our mission and don't sell\nout and all that good stuff is\nultimately to help you and it's to help\nthe people who come on it's to help the\npeople who are part of our community\nlike that's what we're really about it's\nnot about growth it's not about money\nit's not about subs I mean all that\nstuff is really helpful and helps us\ngrow so I'm grateful for that but at the\nend of the day like we got into this to\nhelp you guys understand how you work as\nhuman beings and how to be like more\nsuccessful and be healthier and happier\nin life if you're held back by\ndepression if you're held back by a lack\nof motivation if you're a NEET right so\nnot an education employment or training\nif you're you know a gamer and ER addict\nif you spend ten hours a day at home\nlike it doesn't all of those things are\ncompletely fine and we're here to help\nyou right or help be here to help you\nkind of come out of that so a couple of\nother things so since we're growing so\nmuch I was talking a little bit about\nthe coaching program so it's my hope\nthat I can offer support because there's\njust no way like so over the last month\nI've gotten 2,000 dm's emails messages\non reddit all this kind of stuff for\npeople like voicemails things like that\nI just got\ncall actually I got an email from the\npage operator at my hospital that my\nvoice box is full because people are\nsomehow like paging me or calling me or\ntrying to contact me through my Hospital\ndon't do that by the way because I'm not\ngonna get that message so you know we're\ngrowing a lot and I think this isn't so\nnow the challenge becomes like how do we\nhelp you guys more so this is something\nthat I definitely want to hear from you\nguys about so like I want y'all to\nunderstand that I I am I am a resource\nright so that's the way that I view\nmyself so I want to know what can I do\nto help you more and so a lot of people\nhave messaged me like I only have 24\nhours in a day you know eight of those I\ntry to sleep and then two to three of\nthose I try to spend with my family and\nlike those are important to me I have to\nyou know I have a job and stuff so I\nhave to spend like you know I spent\nabout six to eight hours a day working\nusually and then I spend like two to\nfour hours a day on healthy gamer and so\nwhat I want to know is like how can I\nhelp more and this is a question that I\nhave for you guys so you guys need to\ntell me what you want me to do like do\nyou want me to stream or do you want me\nto make more longitudinal content do you\nwant me to train coaches and all that\nkind of stuff so and this is something\nthat thankfully you guys have been\nawesome about so people have told me\nlike what they want right so here's what\nand so this is what healthy gamer is\nworking on so we're at a hundred\nthousand followers and subscribers thank\nyou guys very much for everyone who has\nsubscribed and donated and stuff like\nthat here's what we're gonna do with\nthat okay so the first thing that we're\ngonna do is train coaches because I've\nrealized that like I don't think that\nany amount of watching twitch and\nYouTube is a substitute I can get on\nhere and talk to you know I can talk\nabout how the mind works how the brain\nworks how spirituality works I can talk\nabout addiction and I'm gonna do all\nthose things I can interview people and\nthat's part of the AoE healing but I\nthink there's no substitute for if we're\nreally talking about like what\nscientifically constitutes change in\nsomeone's life it's working with someone\nright so what we want to do is like\nchange the way that people get support\nso mental health right now is too\nexpensive too old and too slow what do I\nmean by that so like if you guys want to\nsee a therapist\nyou know those appointments run anywhere\nfrom like 125 to like 500 per\nappointment right insurance will cover a\nportion of that things like that\nsometimes insurance is expensive\nsometimes insurance is crappy it's it's\ntoo slow so like getting an appointment\nwith a therapist can take time so I\nstill think you guys should try to do\nall of those things if you do have a\nmental health problem you should see a\nclinician so our coaching program is not\na substitute for mental health treatment\nit's not designed to diagnose or treat\nanything but it is designed to support\nyou and this is where there's actually\nsome really interesting research that\nshows that coaches are actually very\neffective is a group of people it's sort\nof helping people and so we're gonna\ntrain coaches and the average age of\npsychiatrist by the way in the u.s. is\nlike 54 or something like that so I\nthink the other challenge that I heard\nfrom you guys is that like when you do\nsometimes seek mental health treatment\nthey they may be able to handle the\ndepression but there are things about\nyour life that they don't understand and\nso that's why we developed our coaching\nprogram so our focus has really been on\nthe coaching program because like\nultimately I think that you guys you\nknow what I want to do is train people\nwho sort of follow my methodology and\nare able to like help you guys\nso we're also like trying to seek\nsponsors sponsorship and stuff like that\nbecause I know that you know a lot of\npeople don't have resources to pay for\nthis stuff so we're working on that kind\nof stuff so the next thing that we're\nworking on is more longitudinal content\nright so a lot of people have asked for\nlike more in-depth stuff about Ayurveda\nabout how do you find your Dharma how do\nyou understand addiction how do you\nunderstand your brain can you put\ntogether like a set of meditation\nexercises like a meditation curriculum I\nwant to build all that stuff out it\ndoesn't seem like Twitch's necessarily\nthe best way to deliver that content so\nwe may like you know if we're thinking\nabout like a course like if you want to\nlearn meditation start to finish theory\ndifferent kinds of techniques new\ntechniques for insomnia techniques for\nanxiety techniques for depression and\ntechniques for strengthening like you\nphysically strengthening use techniques\nfor enhancing your Chi or your prana\nyou know how can we sort of create a\nlongitudinal body of content like a\ncurriculum so that's the other big thing\nthat I want to focus on and then this is\nsomething that my team keeps on telling\nme not to talk about but I'm gonna talk\nabout it anyway and and so the other\nthing that I want to do in my heart of\nhearts is to like do like more retreats\nso this we probably don't have the\nbandwidth for and things like that but\nultimately we had a retreat in August of\n2019 and people gamers from like all\nover the US came and we want to do like\nI want to do that again because\nultimately as much as AoE is important\nas much as I love streaming on Twitch as\nmuch as I love teaching you guys the\nstuff and training coaches and stuff\nlike that the most of so I want to see\npeople in person I want to work with\npeople in person I want you guys to come\nI want to help you I want to help you\nlike in a group I want to help you in\nperson I want to talk to you in person\nand so okay [ __ ] ready great oh sorry\nbiscuit okay so all right let me just\nkind of wrap up it's the last thing that\nI wanted maybe not the last thing but\nyou know one of the things that I also\nwant to mention is this wouldn't be\npossible without our mods so like this\nis amazing like the coolest thing about\nthis whole experience has been our mods\nso I don't know where you guys came from\nI don't know how you became mods but\ny'all are doing an awesome job and the\nmods on our discord they like got\ntogether themselves they're so much more\norganized than we are actually they like\nthey're putting together a coding\nworkshop to help people like learn how\nto code right so there are people in our\ncommunity that are starting to like help\nother people acquire skills that will\nlike get them jobs and so that they can\nearn money and be financially\nindependent and these mods just came out\nof nowhere like I don't know where y'all\ncame from but y'all are amazing and I\nsat in on a mod meeting which happens\nevery week there's like a mod meeting\nthat happens every week so I like asked\nif I could come and see what they're up\nto\nthey're so organized and they're so\nawesome and there's so many times where\nwe've had guests who have actually\npretty toxic communities and they've\ndone a really really good job of like\nkeeping those talks of communities in\ncheck and remember\nthat like this is a stream so you guys\nlike understand first of all it takes a\nton of courage to come on here and\nsecondly like sometimes twitch chat is\nan [ __ ] like sometimes twitch chat is\nlike mean to people who show\nvulnerability and weakness and they're\nlike hungry for blood and our mods have\nbeen so awesome it's sort of shutting\nthat down and like creating a space\nthat's positive so like I get that I\nmean I get it's fun I get it's kind of\nyou know important to be like I know\nthat a lot of people like that kind of\nthing but this that's not what the\nstream is about right like it's not\nabout laughing at other people it's\nabout learning from other people it's\nabout growing yourself and so I just\nwant to say a huge thank you to the mods\nand yeah so like I guess there there are\nother things like music stuff like\npeople are teaching other people how to\nmake music they're teaching people how\nto code there's also like organic groups\nthat are happening within our discord\nwhere people are like forming\naccountability groups so those are like\nthese are like groups that are basically\nlike people are keeping each other and\ncheck in terms of like exercise and\nstuff like that and so huge like thank\nyou to that so and yeah so like I would\njust want to emphasize this and then\nwe'll get to miss gif so healthy gamers\nnot about me right so I'm dr. kay but\nit's not it's not dr. kay it's healthy\ngamer it's about our staff it's about\nour moderators it's about our coaches\nit's about our community it's about the\npeople who hang out on discord it's\nabout people who are on YouTube and\nreddit and twitch it's about you guys\nlike healthy gamer it's not dr. kay\nstream it's healthy gamer stream and you\nguys are the healthy gamers and I think\nit's just what I think is just amazing\nis that I live in a time where I have I\nrealize some time ago that like this is\nnot gonna work like I've spent I devoted\n15 years of my life to understand how\npeople work and how to help them and\npeople come to my office every single\nday not every day but you know five days\na week and I help them individually\nand like that's not good enough there's\njust no way there's no way that I can\nhelp everyone who needs help so we need\nlike AoE in like twitch right discord\nlike I I don't I didn't live like this\nisn't I'm not doing this 20 years ago I\n20 years ago it was like I seek you if\nyou guys even know what that is right\nit's like AOL Instant Messenger this\nwould not be possible 20 years ago so\nthe world is changing the challenges\nthat we face seem insurmountable\nmental health is like at an all-time\nhigh in terms of like how much it screws\npeople over you have Nene's in South\nAmerican eat that Abajo and knee\nestudiar you have meats not an\nemployment education and training you\nhave the lowest employment of like men\nbetween the ages of 18 and 25 you have a\nsuicide rate that is 50% higher among\nthat is growing by 50% amongst\nadolescents over the last decade you\nhave video game addiction that is at\naround six percent of the population and\nbelow the age of 18 it's like nine point\nfive percent the world is getting worse\nand we have the tools now like look at\nmy face like I'm smiling because we can\nfight this we can do this because we\nhave twitch right it's the very things\nvideogames keep you stuck and alone and\nstuff like that but there's also like\ndiscord keeps you at home because the\nyou I don't have any friends in real\nlife but they're people now on discord\nwho can teach you how to code there are\npeople on Twitter who will teach you how\nto meditate it's kind of like we're\nplaying hard mode version of life where\nthe challenges that we face are a lot\ngreater than they've ever been and we\ncan talk about why that is in terms of\nmental health but we also have tools in\nsupport in ways that we've never like\nhad them before so you can like become a\ngame developer from your home and you\ncan learn how to code from github and\nyou can do all this stuff like at home\nthere's so much power at your disposal\nthat has never been there before and I'm\ngrateful for twitch and YouTube and like\nall of these communities for like\nhelping me spread this message because I\ncouldn't do this 20 years ago so I'm\noptimistic and we're gonna keep going\nand you guys have supported me you guys\nhave said yes dr. K we like what you're\ndoing that support comes in terms of\nviewership subs all that good stuff so\nyou guys are supporting me so I'm gonna\nsupport you and I'm going to\nto bigger and better and more and like\nwe're gonna do this like I don't we're\ngonna do it we're gonna do it"
