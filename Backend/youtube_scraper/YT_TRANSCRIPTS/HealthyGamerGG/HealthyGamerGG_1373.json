    "transcript": "- I said I'm good to be here I'm good\nwait my cameras like flickering okay I'm\nnot gonna lie to you I'm like I'm\ndefinitely really nervous okay but I'm\nalso excited at the same time because\nI've really never spoken to like someone\nwho is qualified ever okay well so help\nme understand what you're nervous about\nwell um I don't know man a lot of things\na lot of things um just more so like I\nknow like these type of situations will\ndefinitely make me vulnerable all right\nand it's like being vulnerable is a kind\nof scary you know absolutely being\nvulnerable is terrifying yeah sure and\nwhen you say these kinds of situations\nwhat what is that what help me\nunderstand no just talking talking to\nsomeone like truthfully rather than it\njust being like some you know like like\nmost time I scream it's more of just\nlike it's a show you know it's like\nwe're just having fun constant whatever\nbut this is like a like a more real\nsetting if that makes sense even though\nthere is still chat spamming you know\nKappas and stuff so yeah I'd like to\nswear as well right yeah I think so okay\nlike if you don't want me to lie if\nyou'll just asking you like like how you\nwant the setting to be you know am I\nallowed to like be uh I'm very uh I like\nto swear so I'm just I think if you want\na sweater that's okay man okay cool [ __ ]\nalright we're good alright so um can you\nyou said you haven't talked to someone\nwho is like like you've never spoken to\na professional about your feelings is\nthat what you mean yeah I've never\nreally spoken to anyone man I've uh well\nI've spoken like friends and stuff\nobviously like I have friends that know\nme pretty well but I definitely have\nnever spoken to a professional before\nand there well that's not true one time\nI did speak to or tried to speak to a\npsychologist like two years ago but I\nremember they were having a very hard\ntime relating to anything I was really\nsaying I was trying to like help them\nunderstand like my life and like what's\nlike bothering me and like my job and\ntwitch ad and all this and like getting\nyou know getting backlash and hate and\nall these things and they can't like\nit's almost like when you get like a\nBoomer therapist they just don't they\ndon't quite understand any of those like\ndynamics right so they pretty much just\nsay hey yo take this pill you'll be good\nyou know so that's like is that what\nthis all just said uh well mostly\neveryone I've gone to is tried to put me\non some plate but some type of like drug\nyeah like whether it be a SSRIs\nor for depression anxiety just like\nrandom [ __ ] like you know whatever D are\nyou depressed or anxious well I've\ndefinitely had my uh I definitely had my\nrun-ins with anxiety and depression\ndefinitely a hundred percent I used to\nbe very very anxious but recently it's\nbeen better it's definitely been better\nrecently okay\nwhat's been better recently what's\nwhat's changed well I don't know I moved\nto Austin like eight months ago where's\nmy camera flickering for you is that\njust my son it's it know what's good to\nme man okay there's my son okay so I\nmoved to Austin eight months ago right I\nwas like doing this I did this whole\nstreamer house with a bunch of uh with a\nbunch of streamers there's like a lot of\ngirls we had like a big mansion or\nwhatever and we were all streaming\neverything was going good I don't know\nit's like when I'm streaming and like\nwhen I'm like like popping off on Twitch\nit almost feels as though my problems\nlike it's like I'm distracting myself\nfrom my own mind and I'm just like\ngrinding if that makes sense but then as\nsoon as I ditch and the cameras off and\nI'm just Mitch and whatever David in the\nmirror then I have to like truly see\nmyself for who I am and and it's like I\nhave a lot of baggage inside that just\nlike sits there you know and like sure I\nI haven't really found a good way of\nreleasing those things even though I've\nbeen looking for those looking for those\nreleases like for a long time now you\nknow I took like a year off - ish like\ntwo years ago to just kind of try and\nfind myself and all I really found was a\nbunch of pain and I was just like super\n[ __ ] up and I kept trying all these\nlike weird diets like I well I was like\nthe skinniest like I I lost so much\nweight and I was just trying all this\ncrazy [ __ ] to see how if I could like\nfix my mind or whatever and it's just\nlike I don't know I feel like go ahead\nsorry no I mean it sounds like you've\ngot a lot to say man keep going Oh trust\nme man yeah there is a yes yeah there's\na lot to talk about how help me\nunderstand so help me understand when\nyou when when the cameras often you look\nin the mirror and you see this guy David\nis your name that's you yeah yeah my\nname is yeah yeah my birth name is David\nyeah okay so when you see David tell me\ntell me what you see in the mirror\nuh well you know I just see a man who's\nbeen literally like trying so hard to\njust like play this like twitch like\nweird circus game for like ten years you\nknow I've been doing this forever right\nlike I've been on Twitch before it was\nlike a YouTube cloud chasing reacting\n[ __ ] hole that it is today you know I\nfeel like twitch like seven years ago\nwas actually just gamers chillin and it\nwas way different now than this like\ncloud chasing boomer or whatever Zoomer\n[ __ ] platform that it's become and\nnot only that not only the Zoomers\ninfiltrating it's also gotten a lot more\nstrict right since Amazon and all that\nbought it out blah blah blah like you\nknow it was kind of like the Wild West\nback in the day you could just like do\nyour thing and like that was it you know\nand it's just it's changed a lot so um\ntell me what you see when you look in\nthe mirror when I look in the mirror I\nsee a broken human being that has been\nliving up or Sona for 10 years and like\nI've always been real and tried to be\nreal with my viewers but that also like\nI I think opens me up to a lot of\nscrutiny and truthfully like I think\nthat I'm very [ __ ] broken of a human\nbut I like I I don't really like to show\nwell I do show that part of me but\nnobody really wants to listen to that\nright like nobody wants to go like\nlisten to somebody bitching about their\nbroken self you know whatever what about\nyou is broken\npretty much everything my identity like\nI've everything I've done has been a\n[ __ ] lie man like that's how I view\nit anyway right like like cool I was\nfamous I was making hella money like\nwhatever right like I had some hot girls\nlike I did all the things you would\nthink would make you feel like like\ncomplete or whatever the [ __ ] but truly\nI felt so dead inside and like I still\nlike um I don't know like I just still\nfeel that way but I know that like I\ncan't really let that person win like I\nkind of just have to keep going on with\nthe circus you know wait hold on but how\nis that strategy working for you so far\nyou know I I really don't I really don't\nknow I really don't know man satisfy\nhonestly don't sounds like grinding is\nnot working for you but like I have no\nother option you know like if I don't\nmake twitch work like I'm truly screwed\nso\nyeah man so so I don't think that I\ndon't think you have to quit twitch I'm\njust saying that it sounds like you're\nnot taking care of yourself so it sounds\nlike like you're thinking in terms of\nblack and white like either you you quit\ntwitch and then that means that like\nthis the other part of you wins or you\nkeep doing what you're doing like it\nseems like very like black and white to\nme yeah that's kind of I'm let's just\ntell I am I'm kind of like all or\nnothing you know\nyeah it's always been no way but what do\nyou think about that I don't know I\nthink that that's just like hardwired in\nme like I'm either in or I'm out you\nknow like I can't do this like like what\ndo you call it when you like good at\neverything uh like you're good at\nbalance I'm terrible at that like like\nI'm pretty much just like in one thing\nand that's all I think about and I just\ngrind that forever or I'm out and I'm\ndoing something else right like\nbalancing I suck at like keeping a\nschedule maintaining like if you suck at\nsomething what is that what does that\nmean for you like does that is you're\njust you are this way you're hardwired\nit's it's not possible to change or is\nit like help me understand well it could\nbe possible to change I've I've\ndefinitely tried I swear it sounds like\nyou've tried a lot oh I've tried so hard\nso [ __ ] hard man like that I swear I\nsee them wrong with me I have like an\naction deficit disorder where like I\ncannot act on the things that I\nunderstand because like a lot of people\nthink that I'm just like stupid but like\nI kind of understand most social\ndynamics and like like the things I need\nto do I understand them it just it's\nvery hard for me to act on those things\nand like I don't know no matter how hard\nI want to do it I just have trouble\ndoing it you know and I'm so messed up\nover it's so hard so okay buddy now\nwe're getting somewhere okay so if you\nwant to do something and you're unable\nto do it how the [ __ ] does that work I I\ndon't know you tell me I have no idea\nlike what do you think man like so if I\nhave an intention if I'm a human being\nand I have an intention what are the\nthings that influence my behavior right\nso if I want to do something like let's\nsay I want to get out of bed in the\nmorning what are the things that\ninfluence whether I get out of bed\nbecause what happens is sometimes it\nsounds like you\nyour behaviors are not aligned with your\nintentions that is very true yes and\nrecently I've tried to like I have this\nthing where like one day I'll wake up\nand I'm like all right I'm gonna fix it\nall right and then I'll like go hard for\na month and I'll really like be normal\nlike I'll be really making progress\ntoward my life for like one month and\nthen something happens and I'm just I'm\njust off and it's all progress that is\nthat is a terrible strategy my friend so\nlet me because I think what you're doing\nis so I think you're using you're just\nusing vast reserves of willpower to\novercome things within you and then you\njust run out of steam oh yeah no the\nburnout is real 100 percent yeah yeah so\nlike you burnout is not a sustainable\nway to change your life right like like\na you're overcoming stuff in order to\ntry to is you I mean you're using a lot\nof this like language like grind right\nlike so we're grinding to me is this\nlike streaming every day and trying to\nlike you know be trying good you know\nyeah yeah so you just you just you just\nuse like vast amounts of just willpower\nand raw energy to overcome whatever kind\nof like tornado of [ __ ] is going on\ninside you oh yeah yeah I like to just\npush all that away and just focus on the\ngoal you know yeah so I don't think that\nthat's like I think that strategy can be\nvery successful but I think it's gonna\nleave you tortured and broken well I've\nbeen that way my whole life so I really\ndon't know what it's like to be whole\nand not broken like yeah truthfully like\nI'm not saying that to like you know\nboohoo me but like I have had a weird a\nweird life like I've had a great life\nbut also we're coming at your life uh\nwhere do you want me to start I don't\nknow\nwell there's a lot there there's truly a\nlot like like there's a lot of things\nthat we could talk about man like I\ndon't know if you know the history of\nlike twitch tell me about like about me\nand my twitch stuff or like me just me\njust tell me about you you okay well I'm\na dude I was born in Baltimore Maryland\nokay um yeah I'm 27 years old now so I'm\nyou know again till the late bloomer\nstages\num I went to I have like a weird family\nsituation very strange family situation\nmy uh my mother was diagnosed with brain\ncancer when I was like 16 and she had\nlike a stroke and multiple surgeries and\nshe's like paralyzed on her left side\nand you know she it's done it's oh it's\nit's been the worst thing ever because\nmy mom was truly like the one person\nthat I actually loved me for like Who I\nam you know what I mean like I truly\nloved my mom unconditionally and I\npretty much lost her like eight years\nago like lost her mentally she's still\nshe's still doing great and fighting\ncancer but she lost a huge piece of\nherself because they had to remove like\nI think I think it was like 20% of her\nfrontal cortex to keep her alive so she\nlost like a lot of her personality and\nuh you know what I mean like it yeah\nit's almost like an Alzheimer's thing\nlike don't remember and she's just not\nshe's not all there at all there yeah\nall there anymore yeah and I've had to\nwatch her to terior it over the last\nlike eight years or so and I someone oh\nit's killed me honestly because I've had\nnowhere to turn like my father has\nalways been kind of like a hard-ass like\nmy dad's like a very successful like\nlawyer businessman whatever like he's\njust been that kind of guy like I he\nsent me to private school my whole life\nlike I've been spoiled in that regard\nlike money and whatever like I come from\na pretty wealthy family but my dad never\ngave me like uh like the like he never\nfilled the shoes of my mom if that makes\nsense\nsure of course yeah he never did and I\nnever felt like me and my dad have never\nlike hug or so I love you or any that\nlike there's none of that like I don't\nfeel like I had that relationship with\nmy father\nI don't feel like I've ever had that\nrelationship with my father and there's\nactually some really deep things I could\nget into you about about like like\nthere's a lot of [ __ ] up things I've\ngone on in my family but honestly I\ndon't want to like err that on the\ninternet if you want to join talk like\nprivately about that that's [ __ ] let's\ntalk about whatever you're comfortable\nwith me yeah yeah no I mean I'm normally\ncomfortable with telling uh I'm not\ncomfortable with like talking openly I\njust don't want to like say something\nyou know I mean sure yeah so that that's\npretty much my family situation I have a\nbrother as well I have a brother yeah I\ndo brother\nyeah he he was uh he has Asperger's\nsyndrome he's like pretty autistic and\nhe was also born with a face deformation\nlike he his jaw never grew properly so\nit grew like very crooked and he used to\nget like made fun of in school and like\nolder younger he's an older brother\nolder brother\nyeah and he's he's very different very\ndifferent you know like you've met\npeople with autism right like they're\nthey have very troubled like a lot of\ntrouble socially and my brother's very\nsmart honestly he's very good at art he\nused to kick my ass and halo back in the\nday like like straight he was just\namazing at everything he did like and it\njust sucks the heat when my mom got sick\nhe never really got that support anymore\nand he kind of went down the deep end\nand he now lives him like assisted\nliving and and I feel really bad for him\nman like I really do I feel really bad\nfor him\nthe last time I saw him I think he's\ndoing okay but let's just say if I had\never if I was actually good enough to\nget my [ __ ] together and I didn't really\nlose everything that I that I had going\nfor me I probably would have like you\nknow taking care of him and maybe my mom\nas well which is a lot of burden for me\nbut I felt like that was the right play\nand I truly regret that I [ __ ] up this\nwhole twitch thing because I really\ncould have been in a position to help my\nfamily and I feel like I let that I just\n[ __ ] up man for my own selfish reasons\ncuz I wanted to you know whatever [ __ ]\naround and be an idiot you know no I\ndon't what does that mean it means that\nI got so carried away in this [ __ ] when\nI could have just looked at it as a\nmeans to help my family instead I looked\nat it as a means to feed my own ego and\nyou know date hot girls and whatever\nspend a lot of money on [ __ ] I don't\nneed and you know what I mean like that\nkind of stuff like meet a bunch of fake\nfriends that tell me I'm through and\nreally they they don't give a [ __ ] and I\njust you know whatever they wanted was\njust not so you you myself for that Oh\nhundred percent I blame myself for that\nI'm stupid it's not that I'm even stupid\nit's that I was being selfish and I\nalways knew the right play and it's just\nit's it's easier said than done you know\nyeah so so help me understand that I'm a\nlittle bit confused if it's easier said\nthan done then why so much blame\nbecause I could have done it man you\nknow why do you think that why do I\nthink I could have done it yeah\nbecause I could I do what III know I\ncould have I could have actually switch\na positive thing for me and helped my\nfamily and you know been a support I\ncould have done but how do why do you\nthink that I just think I could have\ndone it how do I understand I understand\nyou think you could have done it that\nmuch is clear to me what I'm\nunderstanding is where did you get the\nidea that you could have done that I\ndon't know I guess when I thought about\nit long enough I realized I was chasing\nthe wrong things and maybe I couldn't\nhave done it yeah or maybe right maybe\nmaybe I needed to go through the [ __ ]\nthat I went through or something yeah I\nmean this I was just about to say cuz it\nsounds like you know you spent some time\nreflecting and thinking about the\nchoices yeah yeah yeah like I said sure\ngo but you're doing I learned a lot a\nyear ago I like I said I stopped I\nstopped streaming and I actually moved\nin with my mom for a while and I was\njust like they are taking care of her\nand I was living a very slow life for a\nwhile like I pretty much took a step\nback from all of twitch all of that for\na long time and I was like doing like I\nwas meditating every day I was trying\nall these new diets I was doing whatever\nI could to fix my broken self like\nstraight up I was trying everything you\nname it I was on the internet constant\nlike self-improvement blah blah blah\nlike meditation exercise sleep schedule\nthis that eat these vegetables you'll be\ngood eat this [ __ ] multivitamin\nyou'll be good right and I just realized\nthat like there's so much deep down pain\ninside of myself that to get to that\nsense of like enlightenment and feeling\nlight and free it's gonna take years and\nyears and years of work in my opinion\nwhich I really don't have right now\nbecause quite frankly like I put myself\nin a position where I am pretty much\nscrewed unless I continue to grind like\nyou know I recently it's gonna take\nyears and years and years for you to be\nso you can be fixed let's start but I\ncan be fixed but what I would need it is\na stress-free environment where I can\nactually work on myself right\nI that's one way to do it but I think\nthat too is once again your black and\nwhite thinking right so you think that\nthat fixing yourself is a full-time job\nthat you can't do anything else during\neither you're grinding or you're fixing\nyourself yeah well yeah that's true I\nthink that I I wish I could balance\nthings man I really do yeah so if some\nlike someone doesn't know how to balance\nthings what do we do for them like so\nlet's say that I'm time working with a\n15 year old kid who has trouble\nbalancing playing games and and like\nstudy mm-hmm tell him to stop playing\ngames right do you think that works well\nI mean if they're not gonna be the next\nninja they should probably quit anyway\nright yeah I mean do you think that\nthat's that's do you think that's an\neffective way to teach I mean I've I\nwould tell my kid like if they're going\nto like try to be as good as they\npossibly can be at the game and make a\ncareer out of it [ __ ] it keep playing\nbut if you're just playing to like jerk\noff then like stop like that's how\nthat's that's how I would make it I\ncompletely I completely are that makes a\nlot of sense to me because that is\nexactly the way that you approach life\nright so it's like black and white it's\neither/or it's like either you be the\nnext ninja or you [ __ ] stop\nthere's no middle red well not even the\nnext ninja I mean [ __ ] you could even be\ncool with my son being a shroud you know\nlike I mean anything\nI'm just I'm just messing around but\nyeah yeah like I think black and white\nlike that yeah like I wouldn't it's just\nit's like if you're not gonna make\nsomething of it why waste your time\ndoing it like you know yeah I mean I\nthink that's a good question\nwhy do something if you're not going to\nbe the best\nyeah and a lot of people do know I'm\nactually asking you well I don't know\nthe thing is like why do something if\nyou don't want to be I guess for fun\nright sure\nyeah it's enjoyable I'm not saying\neverything has to be I'm just saying\npeople should have their like main focus\nand they should really focus on that and\nthat should be what they love doing\nright so like if you love video games I\ntruly think that you should strive to be\nthe best at what you love and try and\nmake something out of it so you don't\nhave to do the other shady things in\nlife and you can actually work on your\npassion and some someday that might\nactually make you you know you can make\na career out of it right like that's I\nthink it's a good plan like doing what\nyou love\nshouldn't trying to make a career out of\nit that's why I would tell my son like\nif you wants to play games then play but\nbe better than everyone else\nyou know okay so I'm a little bit\nconfused like does so if I if I have you\nknow so I am careful about how my kids\nspend time in front of the screen and so\nwhen I try to teach them as some degree\nof restraint so I don't tell them that\nthey have to you know I tell them that\nyou have to do the things that you have\nto do and then you can also spend some\ntime doing fun stuff but that is not\nlike an either/or that you can actually\ndo both what do you think about that\nlike what if what if like your 15 year\nold comes home and then studies for a\ncouple of hours and does their homework\nand between 6 & 8 p.m. they get to like\nplay whatever they want to and then\nafter bad if they've been a good kid\nthey get to play for a couple more hours\nwhat do you think about that I mean if\nthey're 15 they're growing out there\nthey're living life there they're\nplaying with their friends I think\nthat's fine right but like you know I\nthink as people get older they need to\nreally Zone in on what they want to do\nyou know like rather than like [ __ ]\naround and like doing things for fun I\nfeel like that kind of ends at some\npoint it definitely did for me you know\nlike I used to skateboard and like do\nall these things for fun or whatever but\nI knew that they weren't leading\nanywhere right like like I used to play\n[ __ ] League for fun and I would play\nin silver [ __ ] too and it's just like\nit was never gonna get me anywhere I'm\nnever gonna be an LCS League player\nnobody's ever gonna watch my stream when\nI play league right sorry why the\n[ __ ] my time why do you have to be\nsomewhere why do you have to be\nsomewhere\nso like no because like for some reason\nit's something deep inside of me just\nlike urns for this like acceptance and\nlike it like tits is just doing\nsomething and like making something of\nmyself right like I don't know something\ndeep inside me feels as though I've\nfailed and like I have to do something\nmore you know yeah so let's just pause\nfor a second now we're getting somewhere\nright so understand that a lot of your\nworldview is being informed by this\nthing doesn't mean it's [ __ ] logical\ndoesn't mean it's rational you have a\nsense that you need to accomplish\nsomething and the older you get the\ngreater that sense grows the more behind\nyou feel the more you need to make up\nfor lost time hmm right the more the\nless time you have to take care of\nyourself and the harder you need to\ngrind because something within you says\nthat mitch is not good enough yeah\nsomething whoever me says that inside of\nmyself have you ever been able to\nsatisfy it no well actually for like\nmaybe like one or two weeks at a time\nlike let's say I have some crazy stream\nby like 20,000 viewers and made a lot of\nmoney or whatever I feel like if I could\nkept that keep that going and like I\ncould like make a living for myself and\nit's Mitch pause for a second okay I I\nknow what you're gonna say so just think\nabout this okay so you have something\nwithin you that even if you knock it out\nof the park for a week or two and you\nmake a ton of money and everyone really\nloves it that just sets a whole new bar\nyou can't be satisfied with it you you\nfeel satisfied for like one week and\nthen the hunger returns yeah yeah I\nguess that's true so what do you think\nabout living a life that is structured\naround this hunger inside you that\nyou've told me has never really been\nsatisfied like it will be satisfied\ntemporarily but then it all goes back to\nthe same [ __ ] and I truly sink I truly\nthink that the reason it's not satisfied\nis not because I never got like where I\nwanted to get it's cuz I never continued\nlike it's almost like this right like I\nwould get to where I want to be and then\nI would quit and I would get to where I\nwant to be and I quit and then I get to\nwhere I want to be in the neck Y never\nconsistently\nthey're like I've had so many\nopportunities had I have just stayed\nconsistent to be you know one of the\nbiggest streamers on the platform like\nyears ago you know like in 2014 and [ __ ]\nand I would just like take it for\ngranted and I would just play league\nwith my with my stoner friend all day\nand I would just say well like [ __ ] it\nlike I've already I don't know like I\njust never had the willpower to stay\nconsistent you know yeah that's because\nmothers no willpower is not how people\nare consistent willpower is not how\npeople are consistent so I think you're\nadopting a losing strategy because yeah\nyou so I want you to try to do something\nMitch this is gonna be hard okay I want\nyou to try to I want you to try to look\nat your thoughts the way that I see them\nso you have you have a really good\nreason to believe all the things that\nyou want to that you believe they're\nvery logical but I want you to try to\nlook at them from the outside mm-hmm\nokay so I am hearing that you have\nsomething within you that feels like\nyou're not good enough and that is what\nreally motivates you to success it\nmotivates you to grind right yes but can\nI can i elaborate a bit yeah sure I\nthink that why I don't feel good enough\nis because I've let so many\nopportunities go you know what I mean\nit's the fact that I could be somewhere\nif I just wasn't so goddamn stupid\nthat's what bothers me the most it's not\nthat I you know it's not that I'm like\noh I need to be successful it's that I\nhad the opportunity and I [ __ ] it up\nten times in a row it bothers me so much\nthat's what so why do people [ __ ] up\ngood things I don't know why did I [ __ ]\nit up cuz I thought it would be there\nforever I thought I was good you know I\nthought I thought I thought I would see\nit what do you think about someone who\nblames themself for something that they\ndon't understand\nthey're lost sure do you think they're\ndeserving of blame if they don't\nunderstand what the [ __ ] is going on\nyeah really yeah because I think\neveryone can it depends on the situation\nobviously but I think you can get to a\nplace where you understand right like\njust saying I don't understand is like\nalmost playing like dumb right sure but\ndo you understand at this point I do\nunderstand the mistakes I made in the\npast yeah I do I don't think you do I\ndon't understand yourself at all because\nyou're telling me that you have\nopportunity after opportunity after\nopportunity and you you squander it and\nsquander it and squander it yes and you\ndon't seem like a stupid person to me so\nI think that there's there are large\ntectonic forces within you that caused\nyou to do things that you beat yourself\nup for but you don't understand why the\n[ __ ] you how you work like it's like\nI've always noticed that I've always had\nthe that's true you blame yourself for\nnot understanding it's like it's like\nyou're you know you don't understand why\nthis why David isn't functioning\nproperly but sure as hell will blame\nyourself for it\neven though you don't understand so it's\nlike like I I mean what if you like but\nthat's dumb I don't think you can blame\nyourself like you can blame yourself if\nyou understand what's actually happening\nmm-hmm I think it's dumb to blame\nyourself if you don't understand you\nknow it's like if this is gonna sound\nkind of completely crazy but you know\nlike so kids blame themselves for stupid\n[ __ ] all the time and it's not their\nfault like they'll blame themselves for\nlike really crazy things like their\nparents getting cancer somehow kids will\nlike they don't understand how things\nwork but that doesn't stop them from\nblaming themselves does that make sense\nto you that makes perfect sense yeah see\nthat was an analogy I understood I got\nyeah that makes perfect sense\nI don't know I don't know how I can\nrelate that to myself like I'm not you\nknow I can relate it as a tad to myself\nbut I truly think that my problems were\ncreated by me not by cancer or something\nout of my control\nyou know yeah so if you can control them\nwhy aren't you\nwell I'm working on taking steps to\ndoing that I think I think I wasn't self\nliar why don't you give yourself any\nslack for that that's what I don't\nunderstand like I see I don't know I\njust don't\nso that just don't change my friend and\nalso it doesn't help that twitchchat it\nreminds me every [ __ ] day you know\nwhat I mean like they twitch a is very\nyou know they are I mean they're very\nlike whatever and they're gonna remind\nme of all my fuck-ups so like I have to\nbe aware of them I have to like soak in\nI don't think I don't think you\nunderstand what your fuck-ups really are\nbecause I I think all you I just tell\nyou all of them trust no no no what's\nthe etiquette - I'm sure that you can\npoint to lots of things externally about\nyour life that you think you made\nmistakes about but I don't think you're\nappreciating that what that a human\nbeing has all kinds of forces within\nthem that cause them to do things that\nthey don't understand\nlike when I see someone who screws up\ntime and time and time again I don't\nthink that the person is deficient\nbecause generally speaking I think most\nhuman beings are like not just Domon\ncrappy at life I think that there are\nreal psychological spiritual whatever\nyou want to call it there are forces\nwithin you that shape your behavior\nwhich most people are ignorant to I\nagree with that 100% it's almost like\nthere's like two people or something\nright there's like you and there's the\nthere's that like dry that like makes\nyou you know whatever yes so so I think\nyou're trying to live life like you're\ntrying to drive a car but you're blind\nyou're like driving blind and you're\nlike how do they how do I see perfect\nthat's the question oh I would like to\nsee so it starts with this okay okay\nyeah so when you sets yours so actually\nlet me just think for a second how can I\njust answer it for you let's start with\nthis\nhow long have you felt like you're a\nfailure um ever since probably like 2016\nthat's when I got really bad that's when\nit got really bad tell me when it\nstarted\nit started around that time honestly\nbefore all of that [ __ ] I really didn't\neven think about life the way I think\nabout it now like how did you think I\nused to I used to just like wake up play\nWorld of Warcraft she don't ever run and\ngo to bed and I was completely content\nwith that life I loved every second of\nit and I truly didn't think the way I\nthink now I really didn't have any I\ndidn't think I was a failure if I lost\nthe game I would just be like okay I'm\ngonna [ __ ] on them tomorrow whatever you\nknow like I never had that attitude of\nlike I [ __ ] up everything you know\nthat only really really started after\nlike twitch how old are you playing\nWorld of Warcraft like that well I\nplayed from like 18 to like 23 I'd say\nlike pretty religiously and that's also\nhow I became straight like a streamer on\nTwitch ones tell me a little bit about\nwhat middle school was like for you all\nmiddle school was amazing man I\nliterally love middle school everyone Oh\nmiddle school is [ __ ] great dude I\nhave so many stories I probably can't\nsay here but yeah like let's just say I\nwas pretty cool in middle school and I\nhad a very good social life I wasn't the\nbest in school but like I just started\nyou know experimenting with like women\nyou know my penis started working etc\nand like it was it was nice okay so you\nyou had fun and you didn't think you\nwere a failure and you felt good about\nyourself yes yes yes I I felt great\nabout myself in middle school but this\nwas also when my mom was still good you\nknow yeah so tell me about your school\nhigh school was uh okay so my my\nfreshman year I was kind of like\ntransitioning I actually went to an all\nguys high school I had to it was like a\nprivate school I had to wear like a tie\nevery day was very strict school right\nand that was different than what I was\nused to so I'd like a uniform and all\ndudes in blah blah blah and my dad\nreally wanted me to succeed you know\nlike my dad's always been giving me this\nlike hard-ass attitude like you have to\nmake something of yourself like you know\nlike so my freshman year I was really\nfocused and I would try my best to like\nyou know be on time do all my schoolwork\nI actually did pretty well my freshman\nand sophomore year and then my sophomore\nyear\nI think it was happy yeah I really think\nthat was the time in my life where my\ndad was probably the most like proud of\nme yeah you know I was playing sports\nand I I mean it felt as though I was\nliving I was living to please my father\nyou know like it didn't it's not\nparticularly I didn't particularly enjoy\ndoing those things you know like I\ndidn't feel like a grind yeah did it\nfeel like everyday you know like school\nis my the school I went to was was hard\nman like it was it was a difficult\nschool and my first two years I was\ndoing very very well and then and then\nmy mother got sick my sophomore year or\nlike that and myself pause for a second\nbut I just want to just understand what\nwas going on within you during your\nfreshman and sophomore years so sounds\nlike like you were working really hard\nyou were also delaying a lot of\ngratification yes you were being very\nconscientious and diligent yes you were\ngrinding yeah grinding yeah what\nhappened to the fun middle school kid\nIII I just I had to grow like my dad\nmade me know like I remember the summer\ngoing into my and into high school my\ndad told me like shit's gonna be\ndifferent you need to focus like you\nhave to make something you have to do\nthis like I want you to go to a good\ncollege like you need to focus this is a\nvery important time in your life and my\ndad instilled that in me like super\nheavily and that's what we're instilling\njust the fact that I had to stop you\nknow because in middle school I'ma be\nhonest my grades were trash like I was\njust I was having a good time sure and I\ndidn't really care about school I was\nkind of just like doing my thing and\nwhatever you know making friends having\na good time and then my dad told me\nthat's not gonna fly anymore like you\ncan't keep doing that like you have to\nhe said when he said that to you do you\nremember how you felt I felt as though I\nhad to I I really I really accepted it\nyou know I felt as though I had to\nchange I remember thinking about it\nabout yourself\num honestly it didn't really matter to\nme anyway like like I didn't feel any\ntype of way I was more of just like I\nlike doing I would have rather have\njerked off and [ __ ] around and and\ntrust me later on in high school I\nstarted doing that but like sure uh yeah\nlike it didn't it didn't I was just\nhappy that I was making my dad proud\nthat made that did that did make me feel\ngood you know\nyeah so you you enjoyed you enjoyed\nmaking him proud you also did it feel\nlike you were kind of getting your like\ndid what he said sort of sink in with\nyou like you felt like okay I'm kind of\na little bit of a [ __ ] so maybe I do\nneed to get my [ __ ] in gear yeah oh I\ndefinitely I definitely thought that way\nyeah like I went through a rough phase\nfrom when I switched I switched from\nlike a public school to private school\nin actually in middle school and I\nremember it was a rough transition for\nme because I was like moving away from\nall my other friends blah blah blah like\nI used to I I used to get my mom hell\nman like I would I would just go to\nschool and I wouldn't even put my\nclothes on cuz I told him I wasn't gonna\ngo there so I Lily get in the car naked\nand just just I'm not going I'm not\ngoing I swear I was not going should man\nthat makes me miss my mom so [ __ ]\nmuch yeah what did she do she was just\nso [ __ ] loving man I don't know she\nwould she would just try she was she was\nsuch a pushover dude like you know she\nwas such a pushover man she anything\nanything I wanted she gave me to me\nanything and then my dad was the\nopposite right like but my mom was just\nlike she was like almost like sneakily\nlike try and like give me my way without\ntelling her don't tell your father you\nknow what I mean you guys you guys were\nlike you guys were like thick as thieves\nyes yes yes my mom to this day is the\nonly person I ever trusted and I ever\nloved I will I will stand by that I've\nnever felt the same connection with\nanyone ever\nand I honestly don't think I'll ever\nfeel that way again with anyone I've had\nmajor trust issues since since since all\nof that like major major major trust\nissues which was that since all of what\nsince I think it's since I lost my mom I\njust went off the deep end man like\nsince I lost like the it's not that\nshe's gone it's just I lost her like\njust like her spunk everything about her\nman is just [ __ ] I just I just miss it\nI miss it man I wish I could have one\nmore conversation with her and be like\nlisten mom I love you and I need to\nunderstand like I just wish I could have\nthat that would be that would be so nice\nbut obviously it's not gonna what would\nyou say to her I would just tell her how\ngood of a parent she was and it's not\nher fault you know like anything that\nhappened is not her fault and that she\nreally really was she really still lays\nto this day the only reason that I\nactually have like any ounce of like\nhumanity left cuz I swear I've become\nlike a [ __ ] robot you know like I\nswear to god dude with all that [ __ ]\nwith twitch and everything I swear to\ngod I've become a [ __ ] robot man it\nsounds like she anything you alive yeah\ndefinitely for sure I didn't want to put\nit that way cuz you know whatever but\nthat's that's definitely true I've\ndefinitely had my moments of feeling\nthat way yeah yeah why can't you say\nthat to her honestly when I see her\nnowadays I I just can't I I so hard for\nme to deal with like I use in a\nwheelchair and she's yeah it's just so\n[ __ ] hard I can't explain it man I\nbreak down every time I see her dude\nlike I went back east actually a couple\nmonths ago and you know my life's been\npretty rough the last four months or so\nI actually lost my partnership with\ntwitch I don't know if you knew about\nthis but I lost my partnership with\ntwitch like four months ago I'm a boob\nand uh okay well yeah I lost my\npartnership with twitch four months ago\nand pretty much a lot of my income has\nbeen taken away from me which kind of\nsucks it actually really [ __ ] sucks\nnot it's my fault\nI made a I made a huge mistake I [ __ ]\nup but but yeah I've definitely I've\ndefinitely felt the repercussions of\nthat I mean [ __ ] like I I when I first\ngot I don't know where I'm kind of going\nall over the place but that's okay yeah\nI don't mean to like it off topic or\nanything\nI just okay on top of yeah that's okay\nyeah that'd just be what's that talking\nis it okay if I interrupt and direct you\nfrom\ntime oh yeah there's no problem with\nthat yeah I'm just asking you if you\nbecause I'll go off on tangents a longer\nbecause there's a lot of there's a lot\nof ground to make free for you you know\nfor us yeah no kappapride white what do\nyou think why do you think that there's\na lot of ground to cover\nI just think there is there's a lot\nthere's really is a lot my life has been\nvery eventful full of like ups and downs\nand craziness right so there's nothing a\nlot for sure yeah how much of how much\nof what do you think we've covered so\nfar do you think we've covered a lot I\nthink we've covered about yeah I'd say\nwe covered a good amount for sure yeah\ndefinitely but a lot of the things\nthere's still a lot we haven't covered\nas well but true is definitely stuff\nagain you tell me how you feel when you\nsee your mom\nyeah I feel helpless I feel helpless I\nfeel I can't help her and it eats away\nat me inside and I would honestly rather\njust avoid it like I'll go and see her\nbut I just put out this like mental wall\nwhere I'm just like alright I'm not I'm\nnot gonna feel anything\nyou know what I mean yeah very well\nright yeah I'll put up this wall where\nI'm just like whatever you need mom I\ngot you you need food I'll get it for\nyou you need this I'll get it for you\nlike I'll do anything for you know what\nI mean what's pretty behind the wall I\nwould just break down constantly man I I\ncan't deal with it I can't I can't deal\nwith it when I see her and in this state\nthat she's in it breaks my [ __ ] heart\nto the point where I\nI just can't function man like I would I\njust can't like I break down III I was\nfreaking out like I remember you know\nrecently I was there and I was just like\nit was just everyday I was just crying\nand lashing out and just unstable you\nknow what I mean sure so what do you\nthink happens to all those feelings when\nyou're not with her I try and suppress\nall of them and just focus on my job\nyeah and how do you think that they\ncontinue to like so like let's say that\nsomeone has you know what just let's\ntalk about someone else for a second\nokay so now I'm gonna ask you to step\noutside of your shoes like this is gonna\nbe hard for you but I want you to try\nokay so let's say that there's someone\nwho has you know all these emotions that\ncause them to like lash out at people\nand break down\nand stuff like that and then you know\nthat those emotions kind of get\ntriggered or come out in a particular\nsituation and then once they leave that\nsituation they're kind of like they\nappear to be functioning normally and\nand yeah do you think that that person\nwould be functioning normally I think\nthat they can put on the mask that\nthey're functioning normally even though\nthey might be very much so in pain\ninside but that's kind of like how do\nyou think how do you think that that\naffects what they try to like do you\nthink that that person will be very\nsuccessful\nI think some some some types of people\nin those situations could be and others\nthe weights too much and they crack\nright I think that's yeah how does that\nwhat does that look like what is well\nwhat's crack to look like like how would\nyou know when someone cracking cracking\nis just like throwing in the towel and\njust saying [ __ ] and giving in to\nyour emotions you know that's cracking\ncracking is what I have done the last\nfour months man\nlike that's cracking you know I got\nbanned on Twitch\nI lost my partnership I [ __ ] up I\nliterally became like a [ __ ] gambling\naddict for a while like I had a lot of\nmoney saved up and I pretty much lost\nlike every dollar gambling when I went\nback east like there's a lot of casinos\nwhere I'm from in Maryland and I've\nalways had a problem with like poker and\nlike blackjack and stuff like that and I\nwent back home and I just I was at the\ncasino 16 hours a day I don't know why I\njust didn't want to deal with my home\nlife because I knew I had to go back\nhome and deal with it and like I was\nlike [ __ ] like I'll just maybe I'll\nget lucky gambling and I won't have the\nstream and or something like yeah\nthere's something stupid and irrational\ncame inside of me but recently I\nactually put myself in a super financial\nhole that I've never been in in my life\nyou know I've never been in this\nsituation and I I did I did this I did\nthis to myself recently a hundred\npercent like I [ __ ] up\nyeah so that's not something I entirely\nagree with so it look can I help you out\ncan I share a little bit about what I\nsee and what I think is going on oh yeah\nsure\nso like you're I don't think this really\nhappens anymore but you know like wow\nyou used to have like a resurrection\ndebuff yes and like when you had the res\ndebuff like do you remember like what\nhappened to your stats and stuff yeah\nthey they got they got reduced by a lot\nlike a [ __ ] ton right like 90% yeah not\nyeah and and so what happens if you like\ntry to do like a raid and you have the\nrez debuff you feed and you lose okay so\nwhat I think is going on with you Mitch\nis that you were playing the game of\nlife and you're losing catastrophic Lee\nover and over and over again and you\nbasically have a rez debuff that you're\nnot aware of oh that's a good analogy\nwhat do you think about that I think I\ngotta wait 10 minutes and queue up again\nyeah but that's the thing right so you\ndon't do so 10 minutes is not how you\nactually get rid of the residue buff in\nreal life you actually have to get rid\nof that debuff and I think I think so so\nlet me tell you what I'm hearing right\nso I hear a guy who's pretty intelligent\nand pretty driven and when they put\ntheir mind to something they can really\naccomplish a lot and I also hear that\nyou have this wall within you behind\nwhich is all kinds of just bizarre\nabject feelings of of loss grief\nloneliness brokenness that you're a\nfailure\nand somehow you're actually functioning\nin life with all that [ __ ] behind the\nwall and then that's fair and then\nyou're you're confused when like you\ndon't understand why when your mind when\nyou try to put your mind to something it\ndoesn't happen properly and it's like\nyeah because you have this [ __ ] res\ndebuff on you and and I just don't I\nthink you grossly like underestimate\nwhat you're capable of not because\nyou're and this is the thing about the\nres debuff it's not like your stats are\nactually bad right like your stats are\ngood you're high level you have good\ngear all of it like alt meat you went\nwhen you look at someone who's got a res\ndebuff and you look at their\neverything looks normal and so that\nperson if I just took like a screenshot\nof someone's like gear in their level\nand they're like like hotkeys and stuff\nlike that and I looked at that that Wow\ncharacter I said okay this person should\nbe able to down this raid boss mm-hmm\nthen it's just one tiny little icon\nright because that's what the rez debuff\nlooks like it's a tiny tiny tiny icon\nbut boy is it worth a lot and you don't\nsee it on the character sheet and I\nthink you're going through life in\nyou're blaming yourself because you've\ngot this rez debuff that's like off in\nthe corner of your screen and you look\nat yourself you say oh I have all this\ngear I'm max level I have this I have\nthis I'm capable of this\nand then sometimes heroically the\n[ __ ] crazy thing is that sometimes\nyou actually down the raid boss with the\n[ __ ] rez debuff sometimes you're able\nto do it for like a month\nokay I can I can really really tall\nyou're saying this analogies yeah I\ntotally go we're saying right cuz you\nfeel that rez debuff it's there within\nyou the sense of you being [ __ ]\nbroken what do you think that is that's\nthe rez debuff yeah how on earth do you\nthink you're gonna be successful when\nthat [ __ ] is eating you alive from the\ninside it's definitely a lot harder yeah\nit's like it's amazing that you've done\nwhat you've done I think it's it's\namazing people will think you're a\n[ __ ] hacker if you're like downing\nbosses with the rest debuff they're like\nthis guy's [ __ ] hacker that's\nactually that's a it's a great analogy\nman it helps me really - yeah I get what\nyou're saying\nthat's what am I saying you're saying\nthat I'm pretty much living life with\n[ __ ] balls on my ankles and I'm\nsomehow still doing [ __ ] right yeah so\nwhat do you think what does that person\ndeserve right so if we're gonna judge\nthat person do we do we judge them and\ndo we say oh this person [ __ ] sucks\nat life or do we actually respect them\nwell if your twitch at you would just\ndon't worry about it okay if you're a\nhuman yeah\nokay so twitch chess not humans don't\nworry about twitch chat we're not gonna\nskate okay okay okay okay don't twitch\nthat alright so sorry can you it's can\nyou a happy what do you think that\nperson deserves from us what should we\nthink about that person I mean they did\nI I think help honestly I don't know\nthere's anything that people can do to\nhelp I can't help like when I see people\nthat are as broken as me I I gravitate\ntowards that for some reason like it\nmakes me feel like I'm not alone you\nknow so like I like to help those type\nof people in any way that I can yeah I\ndo like to help people do you try to\nhelp yourself oh yeah yeah I say i I\nmean I have in the past yeah like I said\nI took a year off twitch to try to find\nmyself and all I found was trash so I\ndon't know I've definitely had my\nmoments of trying to help myself yes but\nthen I put those on hold and try and\nhelp my you know my job or other people\nor whatever you know I'm happy to hear\nyou say that I'm also a little bit\nsurprised I think you treat yourself\nvery differently from other people with\nthe res debuffs wait why is that I think\nyou blame yours I mean I think you you\njudge yourself for I don't think you\ntreat I don't think you treat yourself\nwell yeah I definitely don't\nI definitely don't and I I try to like\nwell I try to do like the health stuff\nlike I try and eat well and you know I\ntry and keep the bare minimum to say ah\nvery good so so be not now now we get to\nthe crux of it right so I'm not saying\nthat you don't try to do things to make\nyour life better I just don't think you\ntreat yourself well I think you do a lot\nof things to try to improve your life\nand one may assume that just because\nyou're trying to improve your life that\nyou feel like compassion towards\nyourself but I don't think you do I\nthink you try to just improve your life\nbecause your life has to change but I\ndon't think you actually treat yourself\nvery kindly yeah I don't\nyeah that's true I do yeah I don't like\nmyself I don't like where I'm at\nI don't like what I've become and\nhonestly if I could do it all over I\nwould I wouldn't do what I've done\nthat's honestly how I feel yeah so what\nwhat are we what emotion is that do you\nknow like regret and like absolutely\nyeah\nso speaking of grief um I mean do you\nfeel like you're grieving right now I\ntruly think that I'm grieving every day\nof my life and you I know honey\nand I know how to put a smile on my face\nand I know how to be [ __ ] Mitch Jones\non twitch you know but when I'm all\nalone and the cameras are off it's it's\nnot good yeah I guess so I think so let\nme tell you something Mitch I think I\nthink you can get better so by the way\nfor some reason people are calling you\nthe raid boss apparently when it comes\nto with your the your my raid boss yeah\nyeah yeah you can't you can't you can't\nfix me dude I'm a hard boss bro I mean\nIFIF this is a raid boss its I am Mitch\nI think you can be I think you can get\nbetter I'm I'm more hopeful about you\nthan I am about many many people that I\ntalk to and I think it's just because\nyou've got such it so it's hard to fix\nsomeone who doesn't have a res debuff\nright like yeah because they're just\nlost in their own yeah like if you just\n[ __ ] suck it Wow and you like don't\nknow how to like push buttons then I\ncan't help you\nyeah but the thing is you don't suck I\nthink I think what's going on with you\nis that you have so let me just take a\nstep back so if we think about behavior\nI'm gonna just say a couple of random\nthings okay so my turn to be kind of\ntangential and all over the place yeah\nyou know first thing is we think about\nbehavior your mind and your brain has a\nlot of stuff that goes into whether you\nengage in a behavior yes right so like\nif I want to drink this water for\nexample like I can have an internal\nsense of thirst I can have some like\nlogical part of me that says oh I should\ndrink eight glasses of water and I\nshould stay hydrated there can also be\nthings like availability like so if the\nwater is right in front of me I'm much\nmore likely to drink it then if the\nwater was like in the next room right\nmm-hmm\nso there are a lot of things that go\ninto behavior\nand I think a big thing that goes into\nbehavior that people don't understand is\nlike emotions so generally speaking if\nwe want to do something like delay\ngratification and control our impulses\nand like all the stuff that we think\nabout is maturity like would you\ndescribe yourself as immature in some\nways yes yes it depends on which aspects\nI'd say 90% of aspects yes I'm immature\nbelieves that 10% of me that is very\naware and mature yeah so I think so I\nthink when I think about people who view\nthemselves as immature the number one\nthe reason they we call it immaturity is\nbecause there's a part of your brain\ncalled your frontal lobes which does\nthings like delay gratification and\nplans tasks over long periods of time\nand execute them in a consistent manner\nso that's like maturity it's like [ __ ]\nlike paying a mortgage that's your\nfrontal lobes so when I when I think\nabout things that interfere with the\nfunction of the frontal lobes suppress\nemotion is at the top of the list hmm so\ngenerally speaking when I work with\npeople who's like frontal lobes are just\nnot working properly ie they're behaving\nimmaturely like they're just not able to\nbe consistent in life they can do things\nthey can use willpower for brief periods\nof time or even days or weeks at a time\nto suppress all of their negative\nemotion but at some point that negative\nemotion comes up and actually like\nstarts affecting you yeah you get up\nI've noticed that person yeah sometimes\nI'm just [ __ ] like I used to have a\npanic disorder and I swear that was\nrelated to this like I used to have a\nvery bad anxiety very very bad yeah like\nI was the biggest hypochondriac you\nwould ever know like literally like I\nwas I was [ __ ] bad and so that that\nanxiety and panic disorder has now\nstarted to manifest in different ways\nyeah in the chats gone yeah\nso I anxiety for me is like weirdly like\njust like vanished instead it's more of\njust like yeah go ahead anyways yeah so\nI think that whatever it was that showed\nup as an anxiety problem for you is now\nshowing up in other ways the problem is\nthat those ways are subtle and you don't\nsee them but you [ __ ] blame yourself\nfor them right so like you don't you\ndon't see like you don't understand why\nyou do so\nand things but you sure as hell will\nbeat yourself up for it but I think the\nproblem is that you've got like you know\ncuz you're in trying to engage in a\nparticular behavior or you engage in\nlike gambling or something like that\nbecause you've got the idea\ngambling was my vice man gambling I\nswear to god when I was gambling all of\nit goes away and I'm just in the moment\nyou know what I mean\nyep so this is what we've got to do\nbuddy so like all this [ __ ] is pent up\ninside you and I think the reason that\nyou're sucking it life for lack of a\nbetter term is because of this stuff I\ndon't think it's because you actually\njust suck it like I think this is the\nrez debuff and I think you can see it\nthere are times when you notice it but\njust think about this for a second okay\njust think about this if you like walk\ninto a room and you see your mom and you\nbecome overwhelmed with emotion like\nwhere the [ __ ] do you think that goes\nwhen you leave the room I don't know I\njust think like does it just disappear\nis that how we work no it probably just\ngoes somewhere inside of me and some\nweird muscle and then yeah something\nyeah something that and then what it\ndoes is it it turns in so in when you're\nin the room with her it's like not a\ntiny deep off in the corner of your\nscreen that's affecting all of your\nstats\nit's like front and center and then when\nyou leave the room all of that front and\ncenter stuff becomes a tiny little\ndebuff in the corner of your screen that\nreduces your SATs by 90% and then you go\non living life and then you fail\nwillpower check after willpower check\nbecause like you're just debuffed\nlike really really bad yeah no I know\nthat feeling I mean I'm exhausted a lot\nof the time like just like [ __ ]\nexhausted so this is important because\nnow I'm gonna tell you something so the\nmind\nmaintaining that wall it's not a\npermanent wall it's like a spell that\nyou have to cast over and over and over\nand over and over again so you maintain\na mana all the time boom dude you're\nyou're and you've got a res debuff and\nyou're trying to live life like this\nbecause like no wonder you're exhausting\nbecause keeping that [ __ ] at bay like\nyou realize how much of like that's like\nit's like a burning hot Sun of emotion\nthere's so much of it just think about\nhow much your subconscious mind is like\nspending mana like keeping that [ __ ] at\nbay\nyeah like that's crazy man mm-hmm\nbut you get that so how how do I stop\nliving life boom yeah great so you got\nto actually deal with the feelings\nunderneath right so you've got actually\nClint so I want you to think about the\ndebuff is a pile of emotion that is just\non your back\nit's like baggage like literally like\nyou're just you're not only out of em\nyou like I have all this inventory space\nlike you can't loot anything because all\nof your inventory is filled with this\ncrap question though yesin good is it\npossible to just like reroll and like\nplay like a warrior no mana just rain oh\nno I mean I\nwhatever the resources I mean so it's\nnot okay I mean ruling in theory in\ntheory that's possible in some ways but\nno Kay not beyond the scope of this\nconversation we're not gonna have Yuri\nroll all right nobody rolling because\nyou're not still enough yeah you're\nyou're we're not done with you yet Mitch\nall right sounds good so what you've got\nto do is actually like process that\nstuff man so like like this is the thing\nwhere it's so painful to process that\n[ __ ] like you it's I think you probably\ndo get it like there it's just so it's\nso like when I process those things I'm\nbroken as [ __ ] and if I'm trying to also\nstream at the same time twitch chat sees\nthat I'm unstable and they feed off of\nit yeah yeah so you can try can do this\non door chat yeah but like how am I\ngonna continue streaming while at the\nsame time I'm leaking emotional baggage\nless than Errol so you don't wanna you\ndon't you don't want to leak emotional\nbaggage left and right you want to take\nsome time and effort and take time out\nof your day right so this is where we\nlearn some work/life balance where\nyou've got to start like like cleansing\nthose debuffs and cleaning out that\ninventory space and yeah you know\ndrinking your crystal water or whatever\nto get your mana back like you've oh I\ndo that attitude I I swear without my\nregimens of like my weird health\nregimens I'd be [ __ ] just because of\nthe amount of like [ __ ] yeah like dude I\nhave these weird-ass regimens where I\ndrink like veggie juice every day I\ndrink these massive smoothies of just\nlike massive em\nvegetables like I swear if I was eating\na trash diet and living I would be\n[ __ ] dead like right yeah so this is\nthis is how you're able to function well\nso let's just think about this you can\ndown the raid boss because you have the\nres debuff but then you also have like\nall these food buffs and then like\nyou've got people who are brewing you\npotions and then you get like you know\narcane intellect and like all that other\ncrap so like you're by yourself every\nday and if you stop but what this is the\nthing that's just a [ __ ] hard way to\nlive life [ __ ] like you you get that\nlike you can't live a normal life\nbecause you have to you do all of these\nthings like veggie juices and stuff\nbecause you have this gigantic pile of\n[ __ ] on your back yeah that's like my\nmana pots and like without them yeah\nyou're like Kane chugging and like\nyou're buffing yourself to be like\nfunctional yeah right but like the the\nproblem here the root of the problem is\nthat we have to deal with that negative\nemotion we've got to digest and\nmetabolize that and free you of that but\nthere's so many different like the\nnegative emotion is almost consuming to\nwhere I truly have a negative outlook on\nthe world like ice actually believe that\nlike people especially on Twitch like\nthe friends I made here etc I don't\ntrust and I like hardly any of them\nyeah no each of these things has to be\ndealt with right so the first one\nthere's one that I've been trying to\nhammer into you over and over and over\nagain today the first of your cognitive\nbiases that needs to be addressed do you\nknow what it is yeah the Resik miss\nright no no yeah so that that's more of\na deeper sense but there's a subtle\ncognitive I so I keep on talking about\nblack and white thinking okay so that's\nready to work on is my black and white\nthinking you need to work on a lot of\nstuff but yeah so what the first thing\nis that the world isn't black and white\nright like it's not I believe\nIII truly believe it is I believe I know\nyou there yeah like I do really think\nthe world has like it's just bad and\nthen there's some good and it's just\nlike most people are just selfish and\nout for themselves it's just the way I\nview life yeah so so that that's got it\nso Mitch this is this is gonna take time\nokay but I think that there's a lot here\nthere's the sense of failure so that\nneeds to be addressed\nthere's just the fact that you view\nthings in black and white and that's a\nreal problem because the\nprevents that that walls off your\nsolution space as long as you see the\nworld is black and white and as long as\nyou blame yourself for example which I\nthink you've made some progress on do\nyou see that do you feel like you're I\ndo yeah I do see that yeah what's\ndifferent between now and when we\nstarted talking in terms of your self\nflame well I can recognize it better\nvery good\nis anything else just hmm no I'll\nprobably still blame myself for a lot of\n[ __ ] I shouldn't but I definitely will\nrecognize I'm doing that but I don't\nknow if that matters being self-aware is\nsomething I've always I've I've always\nlike had a like I wouldn't say gift but\nI've always been self-aware like yeah\nsay that like I've always known so I\nwant you to listen I want you to listen\nto this [ __ ] stop this okay okay so\nyou see you just said a statement I\nblame myself for a lot of stuff that I\nshouldn't yes think about that for a\nsecond but I also blame myself for a lot\nof things that I should as well yeah but\nso don't just jump off the thought think\nabout the thought I blame myself for a\nlot of stuff that I shouldn't that said\nit sounds weird to me mm-hmm\ndo you have any idea what I think is\nweird about it\nhonestly I don't I think I I think if\nyou recognize that you shouldn't blame\nyourself for it that's a huge step\nforward mm-hmm right because at the\nbeginning you it was in like like you\njust said your mind tried to go there\nright and I blame myself for a lot of\nstuff that I should by the way mm-hmm so\nyour mind very quickly goes to things\nlike because you're comfortable with\nblaming yourself but the fact that you\ncan say I blame myself for a lot of\nstuff that I shouldn't is actually huge\nmm-hmm because you do blame yourself and\nnow you're able to see that you are\nactually not very kind to yourself\nthat what you really should do is cut\nyourself a little bit more slack right\nI'm not asking you to absolve yourself\nof all responsibility but can we can we\nagree that you should cut yourself like\na little bit more slack yeah yeah we can\ndo that how does that feel to you feels\nlike feels like it's gonna be difficult\nto start but once I implement the\nchanges and if I can do them\nconsistently it could have a big impact\non me wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong\nwrong wrong on that also future its\nfuture oriented thinking if I can be\nconsistent if I can do this then one day\nI will be the way that I want to be like\ndo you see that it's all at\nfuture-oriented consistent you're\nsetting yourself up for failure right\nthere the goal is not to be forgiving\ntowards yourself tomorrow and the next\nday and the next day and every day\nbecause that's where your mind jumps to\nthe goal is to be free forgive yourself\nand be kind to yourself when right now\nthat's it nothing more nothing less\nin the moment right now forgiving myself\nhow do you feel about that how do you\nfeel about just doing something in the\nmoment and not worrying about tomorrow I\nfeel as though that's a recipe for\ndisaster\nvery good so that also we need to change\nright because tomorrow tomorrow is just\nnow there is no thing except for the now\nyes true in the moment is always ever\nit's all we have and so now I'm gonna\nask you again if you can get good at\ndoing something in the moment what does\nthat mean for your future\nI don't know that's a tough question\ngood so think about it right so now\nwe're headed somewhere so we got to\nretain we got to reshape the way that\nyou view the world and the way that you\nview yourself and your perception of\ntime and all this good [ __ ] but this is\nwhat I want you go ahead sorry no no no\nI just yeah I agree with that heavily\nyeah yeah so we got to start by having\nyou so like like how are you like we got\nto teach you how to be nice to yourself\nlike now not tomorrow not consistently\nnot for the rest of your life just right\nnow just right now can you do that I\nmean sure I can try I can definitely try\nto do that what is what is being nice to\nyourself what the [ __ ] does that even\nmean how do you do that help me out\nhaving a good spank I don't know doing\nsomething you enjoy to do like right\nactually that's not what I'm looking for\nso I think when you do something that\nyou enjoy doing that is actually gonna\nstep away from the emotions right it's\ngonna be it's gonna help you step out a\ndistraction so that's a spank is just\ngonna be a distraction and like it like\nsometimes you're feeling down and hurt\non the inside and then you have yourself\na good wink and then as soon as you're\ndone what happens to the feelings of\nloneliness and dejection they're just\nstill there yeah absolutely\nright so that we don't want to do a good\nspank that's not what we're looking for\ntrue okay okay so good so nice Biggs\nokay all right so what I want you to do\nis is try to be okay I'm just gonna\nthink about how to say this so if\nthere's no distractions because you said\nwhat do you know what do you do to\nreward yourself not reward when you're\nfeeling when you're beating yourself up\nyou know when you're beating yourself up\nyeah I do yeah yeah okay so I want you\nto imagine what your mom would say to\nyou\nhmm you know I I honestly don't know\nanymore man like ii-i've lost that I've\nlost haven't I think you know what I\ndon't say you [ __ ] up before what did\nshe say to you when you [ __ ] up what\ndid she say to you when you showed up\nnaked in your car ready for something\nshe would just say that you know she was\njust saying the nicest way possible\nloving way possible about you know how\nto go forward right make she would just\nbe like and that's what you need to do\nfor yourself because that's the [ __ ]\nexact opposite of what you do yourself\nhmm because you don't say to yourself in\nthe nicest possible way how to move\nforward you do the exact [ __ ]\nopposite you call yourself a [ __ ]\n[ __ ] and you blame yourself yeah\nthat's yeah that's what you need to\nlearn how to do in the moment in the\nnicest way possible in the most loving\nand patient way possible encourage\nyourself to move forward because you're\nthe here's the amazing thing about that\nyour mom never asked you to like be\nconsistent about wearing clothes for the\nrest of your life right didn't care\nabout that what did she care about she\njust cared about that moment absolutely\nhelping me understand that moment\nabsolutely right she didn't say oh and\nyou've got to get dressed\nevery day for the rest of your life no\nshe was like how can we just get some\n[ __ ] clothes on you for now yeah yeah\nfor right now just to go to school yep\nyeah and that's what's got to change and\nthe thing is Mitch she's she's she's\nhelping you out way more than you even\nrealize you just have to let yourself be\nhelped by her right now yeah so I think\nshe's taught you what you need to do for\nyourself you just haven't learned it\nmm-hmm that's yeah yeah okay yeah man\nI've been distracting myself for so long\nyou know very good no wonder you haven't\nbeen getting better yeah but there was\nlike one year where I stopped\ndistracting myself and really looked\nwith inside myself and you don't\nunderstand like oh yeah\nI don't mean to make it seem like bigger\nthan any most his problems but it just\nto me it was like it was very difficult\nyou know oh I completely very difficult\nso yeah like every day was hard man like\nI had I don't know like I was definitely\ngetting somewhere with healing myself\nfor sure but it almost felt like to do\nthat I have to go through hell to get to\nthe other side you know yeah so I think\nthe big mistake you're making the big\nstrategic make mistake you're making is\nthat you spent a year trying to fix\nyourself and who was helping you no one\nno this is me that's the problem\nI was alone that whole year and I liked\nit I liked it so I liked it but but let\nme tell you something when it comes to\nproblems of this magnitude you need help\nyou can do it on your own and I agree\nwith you it'll take years but the thing\nis the thing is dr. K let me let me\nexplain to you another recurring problem\nI have okay so I understand what you're\nsaying and I understand exactly that\nthat is true I do need help but the\nanother issue that I do have is I will\nfind these people in my life that will\npaint themselves as the perfect help for\nme right\nand instead of actually giving a [ __ ]\nabout trying to help me it will almost\nalways be them being selfish and trying\nto get something from me and I always\nfeel betrayed afterwards and it makes me\nliterally feel like humans [ __ ] suck\nand I just I just [ __ ] give up you\nunderstand like I have had a [ __ ]\nissue with like trusting people that\npaint themselves as this almighty Savior\nfor me and like it just [ __ ] me time\nand time again like it's an issue I have\nbecause I always look for the easy way\nout right and when somebody paints you\nthe picture of the easy way out it's\nalmost like hell yeah let's do it\nyou know and I fall for this every time\ndr. K every single time yes so I think\nyou're doing the first step right which\nis that you're you see it was\ninteresting I wish I could I wish you\ncould hear things through my ears\nbecause I see so many solutions to that\nproblem in the way that you describe it\nbecause you recognize that there is a\npart of you that always looks for the\neasy way out\nand yes and I latch onto like other\npeople so now we get back to the that\nyou don't understand what's going on in\nyour mind right so there are forces and\ninfluences that eat despite this\nhappening time and time and time again\nsomeone offers you a salvation and the\neasy road out and there is something\nwithin you that is just so [ __ ]\nhungry for it that you can't help\nyourself\nI really can't that's very true\nand even though even it even if I'm\nsuper aware that it could be a negative\nsituation I still am like [ __ ] it like\nmaybe this will work it's like one of\nthose like get-rich-quick schemes you\ndon't mean yeah so then I I don't think\nyou're you're fully aware because that\n[ __ ] it maybe this will work is once\nagain something within you that is\nhungry that I don't think you fully\nunderstand okay because like like it so\nthis is the thing you're not dumb but\nyou keep on making this mistake so in\nAlaia\nit's like a self repeating prophecies\nyes I'll send you a paper called the\nrepetition compulsion very well\ncharacterized within the field of\npsychology and psychiatry okay so like\nthat people basically repeat something\nover and over and over again\ndespite the fact that it's dumb because\nthere's like a powerful psychological\ndriver the more stupid your behaviors\nare Mitch I want you to understand this\nthe more powerful the psychological togs\nare does that make sense because in\norder to get you to do something dumb\nover and over and over again there has\nto be something really really strong\nwithin you that's pushing you to do that\nthing that's fair right instead of\nblaming yourself I think what you need\nto understand is that you have some\ngigantic things within you mm-hmm\nand and you're you're and those things\nare driving you to repeat behaviors over\nand over and over again\nthat kind of screw you over and then\nwhat happens is like you're so busy you\nlike judging yourself for [ __ ] it up\nagain that you never stop in or like\ncurious about why you did this in the\nfirst place mm-hmm and when you are\ncurious because you are curious from\ntime to time you take time and you\nreflect on things it's clear to me that\nyou're very intelligent you reflect a\nlot which is awesome you just need some\nis that also bad to reflect too much is\nthat no no it's nothing\nnot if you're reflecting properly now\nsometimes people will get into thought\nloops which are unproductive so they'll\nthink the same thing over and over and\nover again and they'll think that that\nis reflection that is not reflection but\nyeah that's been calling those mental\nLucifer yeah so I think generally\nspeaking I mean I don't think you can\nreflect too much if you're really doing\nproductive reflection I think you just\nunderstand more and more about yourself\nand eventually you become enlightened\nyeah but in your case like oh my god to\nfeel not heavy every day would be\n[ __ ] amazing yeah so that starts so\nenlightenment is it you can do it now so\njust close your eyes close your eyes\nokay closing my others wait can I pee\nfirst\nyeah go pee okay thank you okay\nI'm gonna okay we're gonna take a\nbathroom break and then let me see I got\nto get more tea okay also guys\nthis is the final boss is that\nokay hold on [ __ ] midgets gonna be\nhe's gonna be I think he's gonna do okay\nlike we just need some time with him\nI'm gonna take a quick ad break I've\nbeen trying to not read chat so much\njust to have a genuine experience that's\nall so I didn't win a stream on my\nchannel as well because I know that I\nget carried away with like you know Chad\nstuff I'm trying to just really take\nthis serious and uh you know you don't I\nmean so I think it's the best plan of\naction hi feel enriched I'm feeling good\nI'm feeling good I'm feeling you know\nI'm feeling like what am I going to\nunderstand some things more so than I\ndid and I feel as though uh I I feel as\nthough I'm almost like locked like I'm\nlike hard stuck and like I need to fix\nthat\nyep that's what I've gone to yeah so so\nso this is so you gotta once again be\ncareful because you can't fix it you're\nnot gonna think so okay you're just\ngonna do different today okay what's the\ndifference the difference is right now\nin the moment I'm gonna try to work on\nthings you've said and not be myself up\nas much and there's something else\nyeah good yeah it was not blaming myself\nas much and try and work on it now and\nput my clothes on and go to school\nbeautiful okay God so and then we're\ngonna teach you how to meditate so you\nare you have some experience in\nmeditation oh yeah yeah I've I've and\nquite frankly when I meditate I just\nreally feel as though like\nit's almost like a negative experience\nfor me\nlike I don't know how to explain it like\nyeah tell me about it I like well I if I\nmeditate before sleep I almost always\nhave nightmares if I meditation for me\nlike I have like cried and it just it\nbrings out a lot of pain you know all\nI'm trying to say like when I'm just\nthere alone in my thoughts even when I\ntry and tell my thoughts to shut up like\nfor some reason emotion comes out\ninstead it's so it's so hard to explain\nyeah makes perfect sense okay it's not\nhard to know it yeah so I'm gonna teach\nyou a different kind of meditation\ntechnique that it's not going to quite\nhave the same effect I think it'll be\nmore pleasant for you but I think what's\nhappening in your case is any time you\ntry to meditate what essentially happens\nis you stop casting your wall spells and\nso the [ __ ] comes flooding out so\noftentimes in meditation whatever is\nburied comes up okay because you're just\nyou're you're like unraveling your mind\nmm-hmm\nfirst thing is you got to sit up\nstraight all right so you got to fix\nyour posture yeah so what kind of\nchaotic I don't know some type of a\nwheelchair thing is that like wheels on\nit it's like you know okay so this is a\ncomputer chair a shitty one okay okay so\nwhat I want you to do is you're like\nleaning back yeah don't lean back so sit\nup straight and kind of no no like yeah\nyou have pillows or blankets behind you\nyeah can you go get so I want you to sit\non something sit like with your bit on\nsomething yeah like I want you to take\nlike a pillow and put it on your chair\nand then sit on that okay yeah [ __ ] I\nreally want to help you get your [ __ ]\ntogether man\nyou're gonna what happened no I'm just\nfeeling good about you that's all okay\nall right okay so so now it is home\nwrong no no you're doing great so now\nclose your eyes and how do you do you\nnotice a difference once you're sitting\non the pillow with your back yeah I do\nyeah what do you notice is different\nwell I don't feel as my heavy I guess\nokay lie back feels\nyeah my back feels it feels easier to\nsit yeah good now I want you to fold the\npillow in half and then sit on that so\nfold it pull it on top of ya alright now\nhow do you feel more I feel very erect\nnow good right so close your eyes and\njust feel yourself okay you are\ncontracted before you're all compounded\nand like way down on yourself you feel\nthat yeah yeah I do\neyes closed okay okay now how do you\nfeel I feel I definitely I feel yeah I\nfeel a little lighter I feel as though\nit's easier to sit you know the teaser I\nfeel feel I feel good breathing is\nbetter easier yeah yeah weird huh yeah\nit's very strange so just sit with that\nlightness for a second just sit with\nthat just sit with the way you feel\nright this is you you're not so bad yeah\nI'm not so bad\nI'm not so bad right okay so notice\nthose thoughts of you being and you\nstarted to slouch again so no slouching\nokay good just maintain your your\nposture and then you know they're there\nit's okay for thoughts to be self\njudgmental it's okay for you to think\nthat you're bad and that you're broken\nand you're never gonna get better and\njust notice those things and then return\nto the sensation of your body right that\nall that stuff is kind of there but that\nstuff too can kind of be walled off if\nyou want it to and it's not so much that\nyou're walling it off it's just that\nyou're not letting it take center stage\nwe're gonna just let it we're gonna let\nit exist in our mind it's just gonna be\noff to the side a little bit and we're\ngonna put go see look at the way you're\nbreathing beautiful feel that just yeah\nbreathe man okay okay what is that what\njust happened I just feel weird I\nwhat was that sensation tell me I don't\nknow it's like I wanted to like be happy\nbut then I style myself and being happy\nbecause I can't do that right now cuz\nI'm I don't even [ __ ] know what it\nwas I don't know very good good good\nright so just think about that when was\nthe last time you wanted to be happy\nlike that when was the last time you\nfelt the buoyancy which you felt right\nthere was buoyancy does that make sense\nyeah I feel uncomfortable feeling that\nway absolutely that's your [ __ ]\nproblem man in a nutshell all right we\ngot to help you be buoyant when you feel\nnaturally like being buoyant eyes closed\nokay does that make sense\nyou felt that buoyancy it's just like\njust a spark of it and you knock it down\nyeah I immediately just I didn't want\nthat feeling yeah yeah which is weird\nright because I feel like it's nice it\nis nice it's yeah it's why the [ __ ]\ndon't I want those I don't want that\nyeah why because you don't think you\ndeserve it really what do you think I\ndon't know it's like a subconscious\nthing with me whenever I start feeling\nsome type of way or I'm about to smile I\nimmediately stop myself okay so well\nmaybe we'll dig into that but for now\nwe're gonna just it's good so if you had\na feeling of buoyancy we're gonna start\nto train you to like be able to just sit\nwith that feeling the next time it comes\nup okay and even if you have to suppress\nit that's okay\nbut just notice that you're suppressing\nit okay and don't judge yourself for it\ngood now how do you feel tell me what\nyou feel actually\nI feel loser good I feel loose okay so\nnow we're gonna begin the practice okay\nokay okay so I'm gonna teach you\nsomething called ohm chanting and this\nis gonna be hard yeah I know this is\nthis it's the heart chakra right uh\ndepends you can get whichever ohm you do\ncould hit different chakras yeah yeah so\nwe're gonna do own chanting I'm glad you\nhave some experience with it cuz I\nliterally don't know if I can chant but\nI think that's what you need right now\nokay so I'm gonna demonstrate one round\nneck up straight oh why do you do this\nyeah don't you have this weird thing\nwhere you tilt to the pelvis\nI have a posture issue yeah okay so we\ngot to get you to a yoga class okay so\nI'm gonna chant ohm it's composed I'm\ngonna try to chant ohm it's composed of\nthree syllables ah ooh and hmm and I'm\ngonna do it over the course of one\nbreath okay so we're gonna start with ah\nand then we're gonna go into ooh and\nthen end with them I'll demonstrate once\nyou just listen okay\n[Music]\n[Music]\nokay so I want you to just listen to me\nfor a second okay you got you got the\nhang of it you think you can do that\nyeah okay good so I want you to focus a\nmeditation I mean chanting is not about\nsound so it's not about your ears it's\nabout vibration so I want you to feel\nthe sounds in your body and you guys at\nhome should do this as well okay okay\nyeah so ready so deep breath in let's\nlet's chant together okay\n[Music]\nokay bigger mouth more energy let me\nhear you do it again there we go okay so\nyour your lips are not parting very much\nso I want a big mouth all the way open\nyeah good okay uh oh okay hold up I'm\ngetting coffee\nokay now I'm actually feeling anxiety\nfor some reason that's okay\nit's cuz it's [ __ ] weird what we're\ndoing anxiety's completely natural\n[Music]\nbig deep breath one more\n[Laughter]\noh okay three more breaths let me hear\nyou do it three more yep\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\nbeautiful two more\nOh\nokay last one\n[Music]\ngood now just sit and feel your body do\nyou feel the afterimage of vibration oh\nyeah\ngood just feel yeah yeah focus on the\nchest the belly yeah that's why I feel\nthe anxiety good notice it yeah it's\nstrange it's almost like it's just I\nfeel tighter and like it's like coming\nout or something yeah so in the post\nmeditative period the anxiety feels\ngreater no I feel I feel okay I could\njust feel that there's something that\nwants to express itself and I'm\nsuppressing it still okay I feel so\nwe're gonna chant three more times and I\nwant you to really open your mouth and\nmake an O for that first sound okay okay\nokay let's go yeah okay\nOh\n[Music]\nwith your next two breaths let whatever\nit is that's in there let it out\nbeautiful shilling my heart's racing now\nit's weird\nyeah last one okay\nyou can do it I'm with you okay\nokay open your eyes\nokay all right\nI feel very different how do you feel\nlike I just woke up yeah I feel I feel\nlike it's easier to breathe a bit it's\njust strange cuz like during that\nprocess I felt like chest pressure and I\nfelt as though like I can't explain I\njust felt anxiety which yeah I've been\ngood at suppressing it I'm very good at\ndealing with my anxiety and yeah I feel\nlike so I I don't I don't think this\nmeans your anxiety is coming back I just\nthink that remember how he's saying that\nyou're a something within you was\nmanifesting his anxiety and now it is it\non dormant or manifested in other ways\nand I think as you let that stuff out\nit's manifesting in some ways as like\nanxiety again but that'll pass over time\nokay okay yeah yeah I think if I were to\npractice more more often I could really\nmake headway on expressing these things\nsubconsciously right can't can't\npractice more often oh I can't do it\nmore often\nnope you can only do it today okay only\ntoday and then you can do tomorrow\nonce tomorrow becomes today but more\noften is of the future do you see that\njust thinking that now yeah and and be\ncareful so Mitch I think you've got so\njust a couple of things so there are\ncase reports of meditation induced\npsychosis\nso if feelings of you know like if the\nfeelings become dangerous or scary or\nthings like that you don't have to\nmeditate I'm very surprised that you had\nthis reaction because generally speaking\npeople don't have this reaction with\nchanting\nso oh yeah I felt I felt like rage\nduring it was more like anger just like\nexpressing itself in a way I couldn't\nquite understand yeah man\nso dude yeah you're like so it's not\ngonna take you years to get better you\njust have to keep working at it okay cuz\nwhat is within you wants to come out so\n[ __ ] bad and once it's out it's gonna\nbe out what you've just suppressed so\nmuch it's just it's like you're it's\nlike leaking from the seams oh yeah man\nsometimes I just randomly cry I don't\nknow why I just did crying so so we just\ngot to let so we need to give your brain\nin your body a time and space to let\nsome of that emotion out and once your\nbody gets used to that it's gonna be\nlike almost like a dog that gets trained\nto like pee in a particular place so I\nwould highly highly recommend that you\nsee a therapist because I think I'm\ngoing to celebrate this process and it's\ngood that you're meditating and and all\nthis other stuff because well right now\nwait there appease pretty expensive yeah\nyeah so do you have insurance no I have\nno insurance I like pretty much what I\nhave to do is just I need to stream and\nmake some money and then I can possibly\nthink about doing that but I have a lot\nof uh like I said I gambled myself into\na financial hole where I probably can't\ndo that right now okay that makes sense\nso okay so so we'll let me just think\nabout that for a second because I think\nyou could really benefit from therapy\nyeah and and and so in the meantime I\nthink continue drinking your veggie\njuices and stuff like that\nhow are your bowel movements well it\ndepends on my sleep schedule but if my\nsuit schedules consistent III [ __ ] very\nwell yeah I got some good shits okay\ngood um so another that shits are always\nthere always blueberry color because I\neat a lot of blueberries okay\nokay yep so how are you feeling about\ntoday I'm alright you know I mean I know\nI was I'm good I'm feeling good about\ntoday I there's I'm a little bit still\nhungover from two days ago but other\nthan that I'm good you know I drank a\nlot two days ago I don't even know why I\ndid I never drink either but\nI was with my buddy and I just decided\nto get hammered for some reason and that\nnever goes well with me I don't know why\ndrinking and me just don't really mix\nwell sure yeah so but I mean do you do\nyou think that so you were nervous when\nwe started how did you think we've been\ntalking now for almost two hours yeah\nhow do you how do you feel like this\nwent like are you were you comfortable\nwith what we talked about today oh yeah\nyeah I felt I feel as though it went\ngood I feel as though we definitely we\ndefinitely got somewhere hundred percent\nI helped me understand that where did we\nget we got I think you understand me a\nlittle more and I think I understand\nmyself a little more and I think that's\nwhat we did today what do you understand\nabout yourself that I'm always looking\nforward or back I'm never really like\njust in the now trying to accept\nresponsibility for what's going on right\nnow and instead I'm always living in\nsome somewhere else than right now and\nand then I beat myself up over something\nthat either happened in the past or have\nor I think will happen in the future and\nit's of doing that I just need to live\nin right now and do what I can to heal\nor get better yeah wow I didn't realize\nwe talked about that but it seems like\nthat's new right chat yeah that's just\nhow I feel though I feel as though that\nwas the that was like what I learned you\nknow okay yeah no I think I think you've\nlearned a lot it's just news to me\nbecause I think you really tied things\ntogether I think you you tied together a\nlot of the stuff that I thought we'd\ncovered some ground and I think you\nreally tied it together beautifully yeah\nso I you know so I think you know we\ntalked a little bit about regret and\nthings like that as well and I think\nregret is about the past anxieties about\nthe future and I I do believe Mitch that\nyou know I can understand why you think\nthat your unfixable or you're so broken\nbecause you've lived a long time being\nthe same level of broken yeah so it can\nlogically you can conclude that this is\nnever gonna get better but I don't think\nthat that's the case I think you're\ngonna get better\nI think if yes if you work at it and and\nyou try to channel so I want you to\nreally think about this\nI don't mean to make things emotional or\nstuff like that right before we stop but\nI want you to think about what your mom\nwould tell you when you're feeling down\non yourself because I think she's\nalready taught you like the kind of\ndialog like the way that you need to\ntreat yourself is the way that she\ntreated you yeah and I don't know why\nwhatever you mentioned my mom I get it\n[ __ ] sad it's like I get this like\nfeeling in my nose I got to sneeze it's\nweird yeah because you have pent up\nemotion about your mom and I also think\nyeah anyway we can talk more but I I I\nreally think that she did it just an\namazing job of treating you with\nunconditional love and that's actually\nsomething you need to learn how to do\nfor yourself\nyeah and if we're talk\nabout like why something doesn't healing\nit's because you like generally speaking\nunconditional love goes a long way\nclearing res debuffs and if you have\nnever I've never felt that with anyone\nelse I don't know if it's possible yeah\nwith expect especially with the res\ndebuff I it's hard to like yeah love and\nreceive love you know absolutely I'm not\nit's it's very difficult and it's\nabsolutely impossible and even though I\nI know you you feel like you're old and\nby twitch standards you maybe maybe the\nold man average but you know 27 is not\nbattled I mean there's still a lot of\nlife left to live there's a lot of\nopportunity for love and relationships\nyou're ever gonna have the same\nrelationship that you did with your mom\nno but doesn't mean that you can't have\nrelationships that are in the same\nballpark and can still be wonderful and\ncan be filled with unconditional love\ntoo yeah that's the questions before we\nwrap up for the day I don't know\nyeah I need a second hold oh okay\nquestions um nah man I'm Mitch Jones you\nknow we're good bro I'm good\neverything's good okay good it's nice to\nsee you smile\nis it a genuine smile yeah we're chillin\nman um I'll be RIT are you Nabire right\nnow I'm good yeah I'm good I'm good I\njust I'm good man I'm just [ __ ] high I\ndon't know like you talk about love I\ndon't know man it's like I think about\nlove and like people and I truly I don't\nfeel that way like yes something weird\njust happened you were in a way better\nplace like 60 seconds ago so sorry for\ndisrupting your nuts quit no it's\ntotally cool it's not your fault it's me\nit's like I you just made me think about\nlove and my mom and how she\nunconditionally loved me and then I\nrealized that the world is will never be\nthat way again for me you know that's I\njust had a moment of thinking like you\nknow I just don't I don't think I'll\never find that again I truly hate I have\na lot of hate inside of me you know and\nlike it's like coming out right now and\num I apologize\nno no don't apologize I I think it's it\nI think that's why I was a little bit\nhesitant because I think it is somewhat\nof an open wound for you for me to bring\nit up but I really am I really do\nbelieve that you should learn how to\ntalk to yourself the way that she talked\nto you and I think ya know was like\nabout when we talked about you know what\ncan you do in the moment that is like\nthe best example I can think of yeah\nyeah and I honestly think I I'm\nsubconsciously recasting that spell\nagain\nyou know mmm like right now yeah it was\nalmost like time for a half a second and\nthen it's just yep like I felt\nvulnerable and then I just put it back\nup you know I mean yeah when you said\nthis weird like I've never I didn't\nunderstand what the [ __ ] you were saying\nyou said yeah man I'm Mitch Jones we\ngood I was like what just that was you\nrecasting the spell yeah I think it was\nyeah it was me putting the mask back on\nlike everything's fine you know like\nyeah no no no no\nyou so he's so notice that like things\nwere actually fine before that yeah and\nthen things became like bad again and\nthen you put on the mask\nbut actually I say five minutes ago you\nactually felt pretty good yeah I did\nyeah I felt I felt yeah and now you can\ngo back there I can see you going back\nthere a little bit so just notice your\nposture again okay yeah good all right\nso now you're actually on the path to\nbeing good again yeah yeah really you're\ngonna or not really no no no I totally\nam I totally am I just know that I'm\njust gonna I'm gonna leak that's okay\nthat's okay leak but I want you to just\nnotice how easy it is to move between\nthe two easy come easy go right yeah\nlike at any time you can do that you can\njust all right like I'm gonna get back\nto this place right yes yeah that is the\ngoal of meditation to cultivate within\nyourself the capacity to go back to this\nplace and suddenly if you're in this\nplace the world is not so heavy\ntrue that's good there we go okay strong\nso much yeah yeah thank you I appreciate\nit yeah it was a\nI guess that very uh nervous and then\nunder I just didn't understand what we\nwere gonna do but I feel like we did a\nlot and I didn't yeah we did a lot for\nsure I think is I don't know if you\nwould like to speak again but I believe\nthere's there's so much man I would just\nI would just love to tell you my whole\nstory man like I don't know I got I got\nlots of stuff that I could just lots of\nstuff inside of me that I would love to\njust get off my chest you know sure so\nlet's let's set up another time sorry my\nvoice is really going out but Mitchell\nlook I think you did a fantastic job\ntoday really strong work and I'm really\nI I don't think yeah I don't I think\nyou're deserving of respect for what\nyou've accomplished\nnot thank you thanks a lot to me I\nhardly ever hear that and I really that\nmeans a lot to me thank you yeah because\nI think just because you've been living\nlife with a residue buff like that's\nactually pretty [ __ ] amazing that\nyou're able to do anything at all and I\nuh I think that you'll yeah so good luck\nwith everything dude and we'll set up\nanother time to talk okay yeah sounds\ngood man okay take care bye all right\nhave a great day you too okay so he's a\ngood guy man I and you know he's like\nlisten guys so I've talked to a couple\npeople now he like on twitch who feel\nlike they're unfixable so this is\nprobably just cuz I'm naive and\noptimistic but like I just don't think\nthat's the case man he's like he can get\nso much better so so fast so fast and\nand it's I know that it can feel really\nhopeless like because and it's not it's\nnot that it it's logical right that's\nthe really crazy thing is that it's\nlogical because if you have felt the\nsame way for like a decade he started\nfeeling bad he said around 2011 or 1 or\nsomething like that like something had\nhappened with twitch a year ago a couple\nyears ago but you know I think it\nstarted with him something changed like\nsomething got busted when his mom was\ndiagnosed with cancer and then for the\nnext 10 years if you're a smart guy like\nMitch's you're gonna think that like\nthis is aren't not repairable because\nfor 10 years it hasn't gotten fixed so\nit's completely logical and it happens\nto be wrong so if you guys are feeling\nhopeless about life it's not that you're\nstupid it's it's you're actually like\nyou're smart and logical too it's it's\nthat because you don't see your life\nmoving forward so you're gonna you're a\nsmart person you're gonna conclude that\nit's not gonna move forward but I just\ndon't accept that because I think that\nlife can be drastically different very\nquickly in terms of getting help from\npeople in terms of just one person\nentering your life in terms of learning\nhow to meditate in terms of learning how\nto take care of yourself getting a pet\nlike I don't know what it is but it life\ncan become so drastically different with\nsuch a subtle and what seems like a\nsmall change like one person enter into\nyour life so in my case I was\ndirectionless and hopeless and failing\nout of college and playing too many\nvideo games and stuff like that and then\nlike I met one of my teachers in India\nwhich just like blew my mind it changed\nmy life completely and I felt like there\nwas someone who understood me and could\nteach me how to understand myself and\nthen it's like it's like life is hard\nwhen you're blind like it's hard to\ndrive a car if you can't see but you\nwould be amazed at what you're capable\nof if you just take the blindfold off\nright and then it's like wow this [ __ ]\nlike sight is Opie it's like the world\nis being navigated everyone is driving\naround is wearing a blindfold and then\nthere's some people who've discovered\nhow to take off the blindfold they're\nlike the [ __ ] so P like site is so P man\nit's like I can drive around wherever I\nwant to it I don't have to bump into\nanything ever and it seems so\nmind-blowing ly different because that's\njust the way that we live like we've\nlost touch with understanding who we are\nand how we function like that part of\nknowledge which was I mean I use yoga\nand that tradition because that's where\nI learned it but there are traditions of\nlike not just psychology but Yoga is\nabout understanding yourself right so\nlike how do you as a human being work\nlike what are the ways in which your\nmind works what is it what are the ways\nin which the food that you put into your\nbody affects your mind\nwhy can't I do the things that I want to\ndo like what are the things that if I\nthink about the equation of behavior and\nengaging in a behavior what are all the\nthings that go into that equation we\ndon't know we don't we don't know but\nyou can learn you can study you can\nbecome aware and progress can happen way\nfaster than you realize like the good\nnews guys is that it doesn't actually\ntake like a decade to you know start the\npath of like transforming your life sure\nlike a decade later like you're gonna be\nin a very different place and it takes\ntime right so I started when I'm 21 when\nI was 21 and then started med school\nwhen I was 27\nso that was six years and that was just\nstarting med school and then it took me\nanother like eight years to really\nbecome confident in Who I am so that was\nwhat like 2018 2017 so like a 16 year\nprocess for me but it starts getting way\nbetter before it's not like at the end\nof the 16 years you're like oh like now\neverything's real like it starts getting\nway better way before that so start I'm\n37 okay so yeah you guys over 22 and you\ncan feel old as [ __ ] like I don't think\nyou guys get this like you're gonna be\naround for 60 more years right\nlike if you're 22 and you feel old as\n[ __ ] imagine where you were five years\nago\nlike gigantic right the difference\nbetween the 17-year old you and the\n22-year old you is like huge and so you\njust give yourself that amount of time\nlike that's so much time five years is\nsuch a long time and then you're just\ngonna be 27 like you're not a like B 30\nyet so so it you have a lot of time and\nthere's and it doesn't take that long to\nstart getting on the on the right track\nagain and with Mitch I'm hopeful like I\nthink you know I know he's supposed to\nbe the raid boss and everything but like\ndude you know if I mean helping someone\nwho is so intelligent and reflective and\ntries so hard and has such vast reserves\nof willpower\nlike and he wants to get better like\ndude we're gonna help him he's gonna get\nhelp and he's gonna be better like he's\ngonna do well anyway so thank you guys\nvery much for watching and and showing\nup and hopefully this was helpful to you\nall as well and yeah it was it was fun\nfor me I enjoyed really talking to Mitch\nI think he's a wonderful guy and I faith\nin him I think he's gonna do well cuz\nhe's just he's he's a fighter man he's a\nfighter and if he's like he's doing this\nwell with this [ __ ] gigantic res\ndebuff then imagine what he's capable of\nif we can cleanse that even a little bit\nlike he's gonna do so well just he needs\ntime needs time"
