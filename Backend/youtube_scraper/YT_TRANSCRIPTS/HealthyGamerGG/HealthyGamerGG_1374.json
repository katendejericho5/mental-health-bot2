    "video_title": "Talking with LoserFruit about Ego and Manipulation",
    "transcript": "yeah so the ego arises is a protective\nmechanism it's like the bouncer of your\nmind so for example if I ask someone out\non a date and they turn me down\nthen my ego says oh they're not actually\nthat pretty I was doing them a favor\ndoes that make sense that that people\nwill have those kinds of thoughts yeah\nwell i am i calling you loser fruit by\nthe way um yeah you can just call me\nKathleen Kathleen okay yeah\nbecause sometimes I you know I truncate\nwhen people have a compound name or use\nlike a first part of the name and it\nyeah yeah thanks for coming on Kathleen\nso help me understand a little bit about\nwhat we're gonna be talking about today\nand and how we can be helpful or\nactually should I ask you to it actually\nfirst let's introduce you yeah because\nI've been told I should ask people to do\nthat because I'm eager to dive right in\nbut can you just tell us a little bit\nabout yourself and so you're a streamer\nand yeah so and Kathleen loses fruit and\nAustralian streamer I used to live in a\ngaming house called okay Cass and now I\njust do YouTube and streaming okay\nawesome cool yeah and is there something\nin particular that you wanted to talk\nabout today um I think one of the main\nthings was panic attacks okay on stream\nand oh my gos and how I guess being\nopened with mental health and having an\naudience you know and then they come to\nyou to you with their problems and how\nlike that's a lot wow so people come to\nyou with their problems I mean yeah I\nmean it's like twitch chat like people\nare very openness so okay okay I'm glad\nthey're sharing it could be a lot to\nhandle and then yeah I guess the last\nthing was about um dealing with a few\npeople I think think I like gaslighting\nme and I just don't know how to do that\nwell say okay that's scary yeah so what\nwould you what would you like to start\nwith like panic attacks or panic attacks\nyeah yeah so help me understand what you\nmean by a panic attack um sometimes you\nget just super nervous and then\neverything just stops functioning and I\njust can't do anything for like about a\nhalf an hour or something like that it's\njust everything just gets really I guess\nLarry and too much and overwhelming and\nI just kind of just lay there sit there\nand just kind of take it it sounds awful\nyeah a very nervous person I think okay\nare you feeling nervous right now\nmmm-hmm yeah um yeah so let's just so I\nwant you to do me a favor\ncan you close your eyes for a second\nyeah okay so like there's something like\nthe panic attack actually happening\nright now right just nervousness so\nwhat's the difference um the difference\nis I guess I just I can't function when\nI'm having the panic attack I get breath\nis I can't breathe very well okay and\nyeah you know kind of like wanted I type\nthing yeah do you want to die or you\nfeel like you're gonna die and I say\nit's um like feel like I'm going to die\nyeah yeah but I yeah\nhave you seen some what about this like\na mental health professional hmm no it's\nonly happened to me like three times I'd\nsay in the past years sir Oh in the past\nyear oh that's not that much you say\nlast for about half an hour yeah but\nokay sometimes I could feel them coming\non and then I just try to help myself\nstop it oh you have stopped it I think I\nhave yeah okay that's pretty amazing how\ndo anything yet how do you do that I\ndon't I am focused on one thing and then\nI just like a pen or something and look\nat it and then it just yeah I hope it\ndoesn't happen yeah okay and so as you\nwhen you start to feel it coming on what\ndo you feel um you know like the world's\ncoming in on me I guess okay just being\nsearched into like a tight space okay\nyeah so like like there's not enough\nspace for you to exist and everything on\nthe outside is kind of pressing into you\nI'm kind of like that but it's also very\nmuch internally as well what do you mean\nby that like the chest chest is like\nthere's something around the chest it's\njust like grab hiding to it yeah okay is\nthere something in particular that\nbrings it on um I haven't really been\nable to pinpoint that to be honest with\nyou um I don't know if it's just stress\nso like something gets like there's too\nmuch attention or something like that\nthat's something like that yeah yeah I\nmean I guess if it's happened three\ntimes in two years it's hard to kind of\npick out a pattern yeah okay you know it\nsounds like you've had a couple of other\ntimes that maybe it was gonna happen and\nby concentrating on a specific object\nyou've been able to kind of keep it at\nbay yeah and sometimes sometimes I think\nit might have happened but I don't know\nif it was as bad as the other time so I\ndon't know if that count okay and\ndoesn't happen it has it ever woken you\nup from sleep no okay and are you\nnervous about something when these these\npanic attacks happen yes yeah yeah okay\nis something in particular\nhmm I guess I'm like not doing enough\nand not being good enough this is the\nmain thing that really I think triggers\nthem so I'm just yeah I guess because\nI've had it when playing games once too\nyou know it's just like not good enough\nand yeah I think it's a lot of that a\nlot of okay insecurities yeah it and so\nwhen you say insecurities you mean you\nyou feel like you're not doing a good\nenough job yeah I feel that a lot now\nokay and what does a good enough job\nlook like how would you know if you were\ndoing a good enough job I'm gonna just\nsee the cough drop okay okay um I don't\nI don't know um I guess when I see\neveryone surrounding me and like that\nthey're doing good enough and I just I\ndon't know if I ever am yeah only if you\nmean happy I guess lately it's how\nwell yeah you have been happy you said\nlike I really have a few times I've been\nhappy we like okay that was I was a good\nstream that was a good video I really\nhad that thing a few songs when he lost\nyeah put a lot of pressure on yourself\nyeah for as long as I know yeah I'd say\nyeah since you're a young kid yeah yeah\nI gotta do the best best I can do you\nhave to do the best that you can or you\nhave to do the best there's a big\ndifference then oh no I don't have to do\nthe best but the best I can\nyeah yeah because I know I've accepted a\nlong time ago that I know the best thing\ngood for you yeah and and so you feel\nlike you're you're not usually doing the\nbest that you can\nyeah I feel like I am just I don't know\nI guess when I see other people\nextremely and I see myself dream you had\ncompared myself which I know I shouldn't\ndo but I can't help myself because I\nlike to draw inspiration from other\npeople like anyone would so I see my\nfriend who I lived in in that gaming\nhouse which I just moved out of a week\nago um\nCray and I see him like he's so\nenergetic and loud and stream and I get\nso jealous cuz I'm more like I'm more\nvery relaxed than that and I'm just like\nI guess I'm like I found out that energy\nI'm not providing enough I'm not as\nfunny as he is with that and I just I\njust get that so I'm like what do I have\nto offer\nhow can I be good and what do you have\nto offer yeah that's that's a question I\nmean\nI'm prettier aquella duh keeping things\ngoing along when I'm streaming with\nfriends and like asking them questions\nand getting them like I think that's one\nof the things I can offer ya it's like\nokay kind of moving things along oh yeah\ncan I just think for a second yeah is\nthat gonna make you nervous if I just\nsit here quietly for just a second no\nokay\nso your people people like watching you\nright like people come and sometimes\nthey feel really really comfortable and\nthey will sometimes share things from\ntheir personal life because they feel\nsupported or they feel like it's a safe\nspace for them to talk about their own\nproblems yep yeah what do you think\nabout that um I mean it's really cool I\nlove I have a really like open community\nI feel and then yeah I've got a little\ncommunity at giving back and it's it's\nnice to say that um yeah I guess\nsometimes gets a bit too much when\npeople bring up particularly when I'm\ntrying to like you know I'm trying to\nmake stream I'm trying to like have this\nlike positive attitude I'm trying to do\nsomething and yeah I guess people often\ncome to the stream bring up their\nproblem sort of thing because it's more\nof it I guess quieter stream where you\nwould do it something like that yes\nnotice like very spammy type thing um\nand you think that high energy streams\nare better\num not necessarily I just feel like they\ngiving more I don't feel like people\nlike them more I guess yeah yeah do you\nfeel like you're light are you like yeah\nmm-hmm I think I'm like them don't know\nif I'm likeable no yeah I'm getting that\nso what's the difference let's talk\nabout that for a second is that okay if\nI asked you a few questions about that\nyeah sure what's the difference between\nbeing liked and being likeable and being\nlike - iam is just knowing that a few\npeople like you so you liked and\nlikeable is that you're easy to get\nalong with mm-hm I guess I'm not a bit\nmore standoffish not as like a wall not\nfor as friendly and some others okay do\nyou think\nexcuse me do you think that the people\nwho like you do you feel do you feel\nlike you're kind of like being how can I\nsay this do you feel like you're\nsometimes scamming them or do you feel\nlike you're you're genuinely like\nthere's something within you that is\ndeserving of being liked I guess like\nwhen it comes to like the internet and I\nsee people who say yeah I like what you\ndo and like you've helped me so much I\nfeel like you know I'm a bit scamming\nthem in a way I'm like but why you know\nyes sir yeah it's very I mean up what if\nI told you I feel exactly the same way\nyeah it's like I just talked to people\non twitch sometimes and then twitch chat\nsays that it helps a lot and I'm like\nI'm just talking to someone how does\nthat work\nyeah I don't get it but it does and I\nknow little things have helped me too so\nit doesn't even have to be a big thing\nthat someone's doing so I kind I\npersonally from the other side like\nsurely the small things do help um it's\nhard to think that I could help yeah\nyeah so where did you get the idea that\nyou can't really help people um I don't\nthink I can't really help people I just\ndon't know why people think I'm helpful\nI guess so so it it's a little bit\nconfusing to you but you do do you do\nthink that you genuinely believe that\nyou can help people um well people have\nsaid I've helped them there I believe\nthat yeah you you believe in their words\nyes yeah so this is kind of this is kind\nof weird can I tell you Kathleen what\nI'm hearing\nokay it's really hard to kind of tease\napart because it's very subtle\nso I hear so this is what I see I see\nsomeone who's actually really smart very\nlogical\nand interprets data and you look at\nother people and other people tell you\nthat they're there helped by you you\nhave viewers that really enjoy watching\nwhat you do it sounds like you're pretty\nopen and it's like kind of like a more\nchill stream where people feel really\ncomfortable it's not like the super high\nenergy like emote spamming kind of like\nyou know classic twitch it's like it's\nlike more chill people feel really it\nsounds like they feel comfortable and\npeople tell you that that watching you\nhelps them and that you've affected them\nin some way and you're a logical person\nso you kind of intellectually believe\nthat right yeah what I'm getting from\nyou though is like some subtle sense\nthat like that's not really you like I'm\ngetting some some deeper sense of for\nlack of a better word insecurities like\nthat you're not capable of helping\npeople even though you have evidence to\nthe contrary there's like a part of you\nthat doesn't believe that you can like\nreally make a big difference I mean yeah\nI mean the grants Gail he'll know I\ncan't make a difference but I mean even\nin the smaller thing yeah I don't I\ndon't see what I can do special to\nprovide that someone else couldn't\ncouldn't do better yeah so it's so\nsubtle\nright cuz you kind of say that there's\nnothing about me that's special mm-hmm\nis that is there a part of you that\nbelieves that mmm oh yeah and it\nhappened some stream all the time and I\nkind of go in on myself and I I really\nlike think I'm like I there's nothing I\ncan say right now I'm I'm really not\nentertaining her an interesting person\nso um and then I just get worked up in\nmy own head and I'm kind of good quiet\nmm-hm yeah I mean it sounds like you\nI'm gonna just think for another second\nso I'm trying to figure out where that\ncomes from because I just don't believe\nthat so I think that there's a part of\nyou so I think sometimes we feel\ninsecure about the person that we are\nand we feel like we can't help other\npeople or that we're not special or that\nwe're kind of like imposters do you ever\nfeel like an impostor mmm yes sometimes\nyeah\nand so but somewhere along the way I\nthink I would guess that you learned to\nlike that belief doesn't come from\nnowhere right the belief that like\nyou're not something special comes from\nsomewhere do you remember feeling that\nway as a kid mm-hmm I mean yeah I guess\nso I mean and there wasn't be no event\nor anything I just felt that way I\nsuppose and I never really wanted to\nfeel special that to be fair yeah sure\nyeah can you tell me a little bit about\nwhat what growing up was like for you no\nI had a great a great childhood single\nmother raised me my older brother and\nwe're just kind of like I know just kind\nof spent a lot of time like alone doing\nmy own things and ya know I had some\ngreat friends and I was just always\nreally the quiet one who never said\nanything um yeah I said him I felt like\nI had anything to add or anything good\nenough dad but yeah my childhood yeah\nokay what was school like for you um\neducationally it's easy it's fun\nsocially actually I had a really good\ngroup of friends so okay yeah you felt\nsupported yeah do you feel like your\nfriends valued you as a person\nyeah yeah and your what's your\nrelationship with your brother like oh\ngreat okay yeah yeah this is subtle all\nright I'm just gonna I'm gonna need a\nsecond to think is that okay so I want\nto come back to this you said that you\nfelt li you were always quiet because\nyou felt like you didn't have anything\nthat was worth saying or if I am said\nanything it would be stupid yeah Oh\ncorrect yeah do you remember actually\nsaying something stupid and like\nlearning that mm-hmm I mean all the time\nyeah yeah not specifically but yeah okay\nand what would happen when you would say\nsomething stupid yeah I just feel really\nembarrassed how did you know that you\nsaid something stupid looks like I guess\nwhen people laugh at you\nwell they say that's wrong yeah either\none did that happen a lot did people\nlaugh at you a lot when you spoke um not\nonly no no no but I was very fearful it\nwould happen cuz it didn't happen too\noften\nyeah okay so you were afraid of it\nhappening and you were really careful\nabout it yeah really careful about what\nyou said try to avoid sounding stupid\nyeah okay and is it okay if we switch\ngears for a second and you so you've\nmentioned something about gas lighting\noh yeah yeah yeah there you tell me a\nlittle bit about that yeah there's a few\npeople in my life that I you know I have\nto be close to you um like work and them\nseem to just\nI'm wrong a lot or like disagree with me\na lot or they try to just make sure like\nthings look fine they're like\neverything's fine everything's fine\nwhen it's just not and it's okay to\nadmit it's not okay and circuit fixing\nand so every time I bring up a problem I\nmean just feel like I feel like a\nvillain like that student trying to poke\nholes and you know things are trying to\nbring down the mood and I I just want\nthings to be better and I just I guess\nlike after dealing with it for a year\nI've just gotten really sick of being\ntreated like that you know every time I\nhave an opinion or I say something I\njust it's always it always has to be\nsomething else nice to be yeah so it\nsounds like they're kind of ignoring\nproblems yeah do you feel like you're\nthe one person who's kind of pointing\nout that things are not going well and\npeople are not taking you seriously um\nno I think I'm not the only person I\nthink there's heaps of people I think\nI've just been doing it the longest\nI guess as yeah okay doing it and is\nthere a particular person that is not\nlistening to what you have to say oh\nyeah yeah what's can you and if I don't\nknow like how public or private or drama\ninducing this is so if there's something\nyou don't want to answer you know by all\nmeans don't answer it yeah\nI'm just really taken aback by is that\nreally hard for you to kind of point\nthat out to people um what's what's\nwrong yeah like um no I've been I feel\nlike I'm pretty blunt person sometimes\ntoo blunt sometimes rude I guess but um\nI mean I get pretty worked up when I'm\ndoing it I get pretty nervous when I'm\ndoing it but I always feel like people\nneed to hear problems and I would like\nsomeone to tell me like sure he is\nsomething you could work on and and so\ncan you give me an example of what kind\nof problem you're talking um not too\nspecifically but if I care there was\nlike a um there wasn't like an idea that\nthey thought and they would okay so\nthere was an idea that they had they\nwere using our names for it and they\nthought it was some super detrimental to\nthem but I'm just telling them that\nusing our names is a great thing and\nthey kept being bashing me down for it\nthey're like no it's terrible it's like\nthings like that it's just they keep\nsaying no you're wrong and I know I'm\nnot wrong and it just annoys me that\nyeah I have other people around me who\nare just like no that's you you were\nright but what's annoying about that um\nit's it's just that it doesn't it's they\nseem to want to do whatever is right to\nthem they seem to want to make\nthemselves look good and seem to it's\nalmost manipulate us into thinking that\nwe don't know what's right\nyeah cuz I guess you don't sound like\nyou're being manipulated you sound like\nyou know what's right and what's wrong\nsounds like you're dealing with someone\nwho's kind of an [ __ ] or narcissistic\nI suppose you could say that yeah I\nguess I guess so but it's just I still\nhave to work with these people so it's\njust like how do I continue to work with\npeople who I don't really respect that\nmuch and who don't seem to respect me\nI'm confused by the gaslighting so what\nyou said to me just makes a lot of sense\nso it sounds like you're in a situation\nwhere you don't really respect someone\nelse's take on things and it sounds like\nthey don't respect your opinion on\nthings yeah and so so it sounds like I\nmean my um my understanding a sliding is\nits when someone sort of tricks you into\nbelieving something that is like false\nokay okay\nis that what you meant like I mean kind\nof because I'm going through my head I\nkeep pretending that they're good that\nthey that they're right I didn't think\nthat they're right but I'm like you know\nwhat maybe they're right maybe they're\nright there maybe that they are better\nat that job than I've been like saying\nlike I I so I do kind of convince myself\nthat it is via the case so that we\nshould definitely talk about where did\nyou learn how to do that where did you\nlearn how to convince yourself that you\nwere wrong\nit's not necessarily that I'm wrong but\nlike more like convinced myself that\nthat I don't know the full story and\nthen I don't know what it's like to be\nthem and they they might have something\nthat is valid that I don't know of so\nthat's yeah so it's just it's not that\nyou're wrong it's that there's there\ncould be more complexity this situation\nyeah hmm and and you're bringing this up\nbecause you'd like to better understand\nhow to be able to interact with them in\nlike a positive way yeah yeah okay I\nsaid yeah it's my best interests to keep\naround them in I know outside of like\nbusiness things they're good people\nI like to believe that I don't I don't\nknow but yeah I guess okay on a business\nlevel how do I keep yeah and and and\nwhen when you when you okay okay I just\nneed to think for a second okay\nso Kathleen here's what I find to be a\nlittle bit confusing about trying to\nunderstand your perspective mm-hmm so\nsometimes when I'm talking to people\nthere's like something like\npsychological that's that maybe is a\nlittle bit of a distortion or is like is\nsomething that is kind of like The\nSmoking Gun like there's something going\non in their mind which is like actually\nlike problematic and usually I can sort\nof sniff that out and try to help people\nunderstand it and a lot of times people\ncome on the stream because I help them\nunderstand kind of how their mind is\nworking so you're doing something that's\nvery interesting which is that you'll\nstart to say a statement and then all\nI'll respond to you with kind of like an\namplified version so I'll kind of say\nlike okay like for example I said\nsomething about okay so you're in a\nconversation with someone and you have a\nparticular belief and they disagree with\nyou and then you do some kind of mental\ngymnastics to bring yourself closer to\nwhat they believe right does that make\nsense yeah you kinda feel yeah exactly\nexactly my point so then what I would do\nis I will repeat something back to you\nright so I'll say oh so like like also\nlike I did make a definitive statement\nabout who's right and who's wrong and\nthen what you do is is it doesn't seem\nlike I'm actually right about when I\nmake an amplified statement then what\nyou always do is you add like more\nqualification in the middle like you're\nadding I'm trying to be a little bit\nblack and white with you and you're\nadding a lot of gray in the middle does\nthat make sense\nmm-hmm yeah so so like even now just\nwhen I said so I said you'll do some\nbecause like literally you just told me\nthat you know if you disagree with\nsomeone you'll think oh maybe they know\nsomething I don't\nor maybe I'm maybe they do know\nsomething that I don't understand like\nsomething happens in your mind where\nlike you have a belief and they have a\nbelief and then you like sort of move\ninto this grey zone which is actually\nlike closer to them\nthen then what you believe does that\nmake sense\nyeah I don't think I move closer to what\nthey believe thing I'm pretty sure of my\nown opinions of okay these particular\npeople so okay so yeah so and so when\nyou start to what is what is the result\nof you thinking well maybe they know\nsomething I don't um it just makes it\neasier for me to talk to them to make\nthem not believe that they're trying to\nmanipulate me cuz that's what I think\nthey're doing so if I kind of pretend to\nbe them I'm just like maybe it says\nsomething then they don't look so ya\nmean no I guess yeah wait wait say that\nagain what why do you need it hmm\nwhy do you tell yourself that why do you\ndo all that because it makes what easier\nit makes it easier to talk to them how\ndoes it make it easier to talk to them\num so I don't think that they're\nmanipulative people that I think that\nit's just normal people with different\nthings going on right and why do you\nthink they're manipulative people\nbecause they're always trying to push my\nopinions down and just yeah trying to\ntake conflicting opinions even though\nI'm even when I'm right even when I'm\nwrong that's fine too but like I know\nI've been right and they've done that\nand they certainly made me feel very\nsmall yeah so they make you feel small\nyeah so when you start to okay hold on\nlet me just see if I can follow you here\nokay so you share an opinion with them\nthey respond in a way that makes you\nfeel small and then you start to add\nlike more grey to the discussion you\nstart to put yourself in their shoes and\nthen if you put yourself in their shoes\nand maybe they understand something that\nyou don't understand then\nit's not like you're just wrong there's\nlike more to the equation and therefore\nyou feel less small um no I don't think\nI feel less small I just ma I mean I\nguess but like I am it's more like\nthinking about what their their opinion\nmakes them easier to talk to you I'd say\nmakes them easier to talk to in what way\nwhen you do that in your mind what\nbecomes easier how does it become easier\nto interact with them um because I think\nthat they am actually logical people\nbecause in my mind I'm like they're\nlogical people they had a reason to say\nthis the way they did they had a reason\nto to make me feel go to you know say I\nwas wrong or and really like stick to it\num so\nmaybe it justifies them making you feel\nsmall yeah yeah no that's a good way of\nputting it yeah there it is okay sorry\nit took me a little while to understand\nso so it justifies have you ever been in\nan abusive kind of relationship no no\nokay I've had very healthy relationships\nyeah because because now what I'm\nhearing you do so just just hear me out\nfor a second okay so and prepare for the\nshades of grey so it sounds to me like\nyou do some kind of thinking in your\nhead that justifies them making you feel\nthe way that you do yeah what do you\nthink about that hmm and I think it's\njust how I cope dealing them with them\nbecause I think it's probably the most\nunhealthy relationship I have is with\nthese individuals okay yeah I completely\nagree that that's the way that you cope\nwhat do you think about that way of\ncoping I think um I mean it works if I\ntry to tell them you know things if I\ntry to work it out I don't know if they\nwould agree I feel like again it would\nbe swept under the rug and again I will\nbe told I'm wrong so I just don't see a\npoint in ever confronting it of how they\nmade me feel for the past like yeah yeah\nyes sir\nhow would you describe this relationship\noh I completely mean it works at\nsomething it works in what way does it\nwork let's talk about this for a second\nactually um I just waxed helping me\nhelping me continue what I what I want\nto do which incidentally involves them\nso okay helps me continue that yeah I\nagree so it sounds like it\nit keeps the train moving on the tracks\nyep\nwhat is what does it cost you um I guess\nI mean just the injury just the\ninteractions with them in general cost\nme a little bit of time and then\nheadspace like sometimes it's all I can\nthink about and I hate that because I\ndon't want to think negatively of people\nbut you know I really do why don't you\nwant to think negatively of people it's\nnot fair to them really then oh they're\njust people like me like real floored no\nway he's so I don't want to be like\ndelving deep into hate or something I\ndunno if that's healthy for me yeah I\nthink I this is gonna sound completely\ncrazy I think it is so so yeah I I think\nI think you should let yourself feel\nmore anger so like you just said like\nyou just said that everyone has flaws\nright and sometimes people make mistakes\nand sometimes people say things that\nmake you feel like a small person yeah\nand how do you feel towards them I mean\nI I wanted you know just dry them yeah I\nwanted\nyeah I want to yell at them yeah but I\nwant to make them feel small yeah there\nit is\nokay now we're getting somewhere where\nare you aware that you feel that way\nyeah yeah no I've got a letter H in me\nyeah absolutely you do\nI think it's it's hiding and it's it's\nconfused the [ __ ] out of me because I\ndidn't understand why I was not able to\nconnect with what you were saying but I\nthink I finally understand I think\nyou're very very angry so like at first\nI thought it was like some weird lack of\nself-confidence that you know cuz you\nuse these words like gaslighting and you\nfeel manipulated but you're actually\nyou're not of yeah but I think it's I\nthink it's anger like are you angry with\nthese people yes and what do you do with\nthat anger that you feel i rant a little\nbit and I or I just put my anger back\ninto my wick just like hot or I write\nthings down I remember like it sometimes\nkeep a diary and one time I just write\nabout how I hate this is one person and\nI felt bad ever since I wrote it like a\nsoul out then yeah but it also sounds\nlike you judge yourself a lot for being\nangry with them yeah that you do some\nreally weird mental gymnastics too like\nI still don't quite understand this but\nyou do something weird because like it\nso let me understand if this makes sense\nor not okay so like there's something\ngoing on where they say something that\nmakes you feel a certain way and then\nyou put yourself in like when someone\ntreats you like crap you put yourself in\ntheir shoes and then you try to\nunderstand them better and as you try to\nunderstand the person who is hurtful to\nyou what does it do for you what happens\nin your mind when you do that I know I\nguess I could just continue on I I don't\nhave to think about them as much if I\njust I don't hate them as much I can\njust yeah so good what is this beautiful\nwhat is this what is that this mood to\nme that they're not as important\nokay so you make them small in your mind\nby understanding them yeah and then if\nthey're small then you're less hurt um I\njust it's not less hit but I just think\nabout them less I guess overall that's\nyeah okay do you feel comfortable with\nbeing angry with them I'm just I've\ngotten used to it so a little bit\ncomfortable yeah and so you've got like\nsome kind of volcano inside you right\nyeah yeah how long is that volcano been\nthere every year I'd say yeah yeah cuz\nyou're not actually like I'm not\ndetecting a lack of confidence from you\nokay do you feel like you're confident\nin yourself touch it go I guess no never\nbe told that and never been told why\nthat's huh like and I've seen actually\nnow I have been told I've seen confident\nconfident it just doesn't make any sense\nto me that people you don't feel\nconfident not overly no okay yeah so I'm\ngonna ask you a question Kathleen\nsometimes they're people and they're\nwrong right and you're right and you're\npretty sure about that 100% yeah a\nhundred percent not just pretty sure now\nyou're the one who's amplifying so here\nI am sitting in the grey and I say\nyou're pretty right and then you're\nsaying no hundred percent so that's not\nconfidence what is that\nokay maybe that's converted spit no it's\nnot you're right you're not confident\nit's something else very subtle very\nvery you're just subtle subtle subtle\nsubtle subtle kathleen okay when you're\na hundred percent right and there are a\nhundred percent wrong what is that\nthat's just it's arrogance and arrogance\nhow does that sound\nuh I mean okay I guess I think what\nmakes it okay is that I'm not the only\none that I have other people let's say\nyour same thing yeah yeah so I think\ntogether I think sometimes you're right\nI'm not disputing that you're right this\nis this is it I'm gonna just get another\nsecond to think okay I'm arrogant okay\nwhat do you think about that do you\nthink you're arrogant what once I said\nit does it sound kind of weird it's oh\nit sounds kind of weird but it's not\nlike it's not it's not so far from the\ntruth\nI don't think oh yeah yeah it's subtle\ncuz the thing is you're meek that's why\nI think people don't perceive you as\narrogant because you're me you're like\nquiet and you smile a lot and you speak\nsoftly but I think deep down you are you\nor really do not get like in your mind\nthere's like very clear people being\nright and people being wrong\nand you try really hard to try to\nunderstand them but you're trying what\nyou're trying to do is disarm your own\narrogance in a weird way does that make\nsense at all it kind of does yeah yeah\nhelp me understand it when you say yeah\nit kind of does what help me talk to I\nmean I guess that\noh sorry I'm just really throwing back\nabout the arrogant thing I know I am too\nI'm [ __ ] confused I mean I suppose I\nthought I mean yes but Kathleen but\nlet's pause for a sec cause I just I\njust could be wrong right I could be\nwrong about that you may not be arrogant\nso it sounded bad I I'm okay good but\ndoes it resonate with you do you think\nthat that could be the case I don't know\nI honestly don't know I've never thought\nabout it\nI don't okay let me tell you what I\nthink is going on okay so I'm gonna tell\nyou about something called the Oh hum\ngod\nthe Omkar is the son script word for ego\nand the ego is like a protective\nmechanism okay so the ego arises when\nyou start to feel bad and makes you feel\nbetter by pumping yourself up or putting\nother people down and I think you have a\nvery very subtle ego and so the other\nthing about a hum car is that generally\nspeaking the more build more confidence\nyou have the less egotistical you are\nthose are a lot of people think that\nthose are like similar they're actually\nat the opposite ends of a spectrum okay\nso just think about like if someone's\negotistical and you call them an idiot\nhow are they going to respond\ndefensively yeah and if someone's\nconfident you call them an idiot how are\nthey going to respond\nprobably just brush it off absolutely so\nwhich one do you do when they make you\nfeel small how do you respond um I used\nto like yell back at them always like\nwould you take them but and but now I\njust more like keep to myself\nand then just yell at them in my head\nlater yes very good right so I'm not\nhearing any brushing off\nYeah right so this is what I mean so I\nthink you have a subtle ah-hum car which\nis actually ego which is kind of like\narrogance because in here you're still\n[ __ ] raging at them you so rage at\nthem like this and that didn't work it\ndidn't get what you wanted which was to\nshow them that you're right and they're\nwrong right and so now you yell in here\nand then you also do some kind of weird\nmental gymnastics to like quiet all\nthose feelings to cope because you have\nto work with these people you have to\nwake up the next day and you have to be\na part of your life so you got to learn\nhow to manage your ego you've got to\nlearn how to manage your anger and you\nalso have to learn how to manage your\nhurt right because that's the other\nthing that's going on is that they make\nyou feel small yeah so the ego arises\nit's a protective mechanism it's like\nthe bouncer of your mind so for example\nif I ask someone out on a date and they\nturn me down\nthen my ego says oh they're not actually\nthat pretty I was doing them a favor\ndoes that make sense that that people\nwill have those kinds of thoughts yeah\ndo you see how those thoughts are like\negotistical and dumb yeah and also\ncompletely natural yeah yeah so like so\nthe origin of ego is actually hurt so\nlike if you got hurt in some way I think\nthis thing arises within you and then\nyou kind of yell at them a little bit in\nyour head you convince yourself that\nyou're right and then you also try to do\nthis weird thing where like you change\nthe way that you think about them so\nthat you no longer have to feel hurt\nmm yeah I guess so yeah\nI mean I'm still hurt in a lot of ways\njust a wish but windows resolve things\nyeah I agree so now hold on a second\ndon't run away from this okay so let me\njust look and you say I guess so I'm\ngonna tunnel down is it are we doing\nokay by the way is this okay\nam I being nice to you am I being\nhurtful or do I want you to so so when\nthey make you feel hurt and you put\nyourself in their shoes what does that\ndo\nlet's understand what's going on in your\nmind\nwhen you try to understand them and you\nlike expand the horizon of their thought\nprocess what does it do okay what does\nit do to your feelings of being hurt I\nmean it kind of protects myself how very\ngood how in that it doesn't make I don't\nhave an enemy I just like they just I\njust keep them in my head I think\nfriends are what they should be and I\nguess yeah so you see what your mind is\ndoing there is is protecting yourself by\nunderstanding their viewpoint but the\ngoal here is still to protect yourself\nfrom that hurt because you would rather\nthe more you can justify okay let me\njust think about how to say this and you\nKathleen you gotta tell me if I'm just\nlike way wrong okay because I don't I\ndon't actually know what I'm talking\nabout so I'm relying on you to let me\nknow are we doing okay does this feel\nlike it's actually we're getting\nsomewhere\nI feel like somewhere yeah okay\nso yeah it's subtle it's very very\nsubtle so when someone does something to\nhurt you or when you feel hurt by\nsomeone they can have a good reason to\nsay something that is hurtful to you or\nthey can have not a good reason and if\nthey have a good reason to say something\nhurtful or if they have a bad reason to\nsay something hurtful which one hurts\nmore bad reason I'd say actually very\ngood very very good this is heart very\ngood why it doesn't make sense to me\nyeah because like like it's so much more\npersonal if they don't have a good\nreason to be upset with you right like\nit's just like raw hatred if like if you\nforgot to pick someone up from the\nairport and they're pissed at you that\nsort of makes sense because you\nunderstand that you screwed up but if\nyou showed up on time and they're still\npissed at you and yelling at you which\none is more hurtful like one way you\ndude you show up in time yeah can you do\neverything right so this is subtle but\nlike so I think you've got to be careful\nbecause what you try to do when you try\nto understand them you're moving them\nfrom not having a good reason of being\nangry with you into the camp of having a\ngood reason to be angry with you does\nthat make sense yeah do you agree that\nyou're doing that I mean yeah I guess I\nmean that's what I'm basing that based\non what you've told me is that you try\nto understand their viewpoint and oh\nyeah like maybe they are right yeah\nmaybe they they do have a good reason to\nmake me feel this way\nbecause yeah yeah don't yeah I kind of\ncommitted myself of that a little bit\nI'd still don't maybe I do have a good\nreason so maybe no yes very good so so\nnow we're also now very good\nKathleen so now it's not that it's both\nof these things happen in your mind at\nthe same time there's a part of you\nwhich knows you're [ __ ] right and\nknows they're wrong and then at the same\ntime there's this other part of your\nmind that's doing this weird process do\nyou see that they're like completely\nindependent like you can believe that\nthey are have good reasons to say the\nthings that they do and also that\nthey're complete idiots like your mind\nactually believes both of those at the\nsame time agree or disagree I can't read\nyour military angry angry yeah so so\nthat's okay like that's so the first\nthing is I want you to just notice that\nyour mind actually has these parallel\nprocesses it's like you're running more\nthan one program at the same time and\nand it's protective and stuff like that\nbut I think I think that there's a part\nof you and this is the really bizarre\nthing is that deep down I think that you\ncan't handle someone being just me like\nlike there's something that's really\nhurtful it's not just you anyone you\nknow you have to have a good reason for\nsomeone to be angry with you and to\ntreat you like poorly like it's it's so\nmuch more tolerable when someone has a\ngood reason to treat you like crap\nyeah it is because otherwise the person\nwould be I guess a bad person and that\nthey've been doing this to make me feel\nbad and then oh they just don't like me\nwell they just yeah so so that's where\nwe have to be really careful because\nwe're what do you think about that\nsometimes I believe that I sometimes I\nbelieve they are actually and not a nice\nperson and I don't want to because I've\nknown them for so long\nbut um so for this to come up more\nrecently it's just well in the last year\nit's like yeah yeah so I think Kathleen\nthis is complicated I think your mind is\nfirst of all awesome but also incredibly\nincredibly subtle and I think you've\nlearned a lot of different ways to\nmanage a lot of different things that\nyour mind does in a lot of the ways that\nyou feel so you've learned some really\ninteresting techniques to manage your\nanger you also learned a lot of\ndifferent ways to manage your lack of\nconfidence because something about this\nmakes it so that you can't brush them\noff yeah right so like this this is the\nreally really subtle part which I could\nbe completely wrong about because it's\nit's almost like I'm sniffing around the\nedges but I think that there still is\nsomething within you that if I had to\nguess I'd say that something with it\nsomeone in your life probably when you\nwere young actually treated you bad in\nlike a completely like not excusable way\nlike there was no reason for them to\ntreat you the way that they did and they\ndid and it sunk in really deep has that\never happened to you where someone just\njust treated you like crap does that\nring a bell\nnot that I can recall I'm not sure with\nit I'm just like hiding it for myself\nbut like I no I don't think so\nif you don't think so we're just gonna\ntrust you and I just could be wrong it's\njust in my experience a lot of people\nyou know who deal with making\nexcuses for someone being mean to you is\nsomething that sometimes happens from\nabusive relationships does that make\nsense yeah like making excuses for\nsomeone who mistreats you and like\ntrying to put yourself in their shoes is\nkind of like textbook abusive partner\nkind of behavior yeah and so ah this\nwould be probably the first time which I\nwould have a relationship like this so\nis this the first time you've done\nsomething like this in your head where\nyou like someone's treating you poorly\nand then you try to like really go out\nof your way to understand their\nviewpoint yeah okay and this has been\ngoing on for a year yeah yeah bit longer\nyeah okay so I think then this could\njust be the way that you learned how to\ncope in this relationship right so this\ndoes sound okay so it doesn't have to be\nsomething from your past I mean if it's\nbeen going on from a year it can be this\nyou do you have any questions for me by\nthe way um I did but I've forgotten okay\nis this like kind of too abstract or\ncerebral are you like fault because I\nfeel like I'm barely understanding this\nno it's it's it's good if you wanted to\nmove on that's fine too but it is it's\ngood for me to realize I guess the only\none thing is that I don't know I still\ndon't know how I'm supposed to deal with\nam I supposed to let it just let it go\nis that what I'm supposed to do yeah\neventually but that's hard that's hard\nto learn how to do so let's talk\npracticalities so in my day job I do\nsome corporate consulting and sometimes\nin my corporate consulting I have to\ntalk to people and I try to like coach\nthem and help them understand like how\nto deal with difficult individuals or\n[ __ ] in the workplace so there are\ntwo angles that we can take one is that\nwe can like try to understand like\nwhat's going on in your head and we kind\nof did that okay and I'll be a little\nbit more concrete and hopefully helpful\nas we kind of sum that up the other\nthing we can do is just talk about\ntechniques to actually deal with this\nperson that's not usually what we do on\nstream but if that would be helpful to\nyou I actually want to help you in some\nway um I mean maybe it would so the\nfirst thing is that when you have a\ndisagreement with them can you tell me\nthe sequence of events in terms of how\nyou talk to them um I guess I can be a\nbit brash in how I talk to them so like\nthey would say like I think we should\nuse like I don't know it's just stupid\nexample like if like a yellow colored\nshop you know they're like no but like a\norange one is obviously the better way\nand more inclusive way to go and people\nagree with me I'm like okay yeah that\nseems smart and then they say no it's\nnot I really think that's my good idea\nMike that's fair and then they say no I\nthink maybe they've kind of really just\nkeep pushing their an idea constantly\nlike like where it well sometimes they\nyell sometimes they just keep it well\nit's a little bit yeah that's kind of\nsimply put okay so I think you're\ndealing with someone who themselves has\na confidence problem what do you think\nabout that hmm now they seem pretty\nfreaking confident in themselves I\ncompletely agree I totally they have a\nconfidence problem because what they\nhave is arrogance and not confidence\nmaybe right because they hand they can't\ntolerate that someone else has an idea\nthat's better than theirs because the\nconfident person if you're saying like\nlet's use a yellow sharpie and everyone\nelse is like let's use an orange sharpie\nyou're like yeah let's just use an\norange sharpie it sounds like I was\nwrong Beck does this person admit that\nthey're wrong no never\nmm-hm yeah so if you're confident can\nyou admit you're wrong yes yes all the\ntime very easily all the time right so\nnow you're using amplified statements\nand if this person never admits that\nthey're wrong either they're perfect or\nwhat\nyeah Aryan is absolutely right because\nthe arrogant person doesn't admit\nthey're wrong so I think first thing you\ngotta understand is that you're dealing\nwith someone who's got a big ego which\nI'm sure you figured out I'm sure you\nokay and so do like you with me that our\nconfidence in ego or actually like on\nopposite ends of the spectrum yeah yeah\nso so I think the main thing here is\nthat you know anytime you disagree with\nthem you're gonna be running up against\ntheir ego it's not about the ideas it\ncompletely doesn't become about the\nideas and this can be really frustrating\nfor people like you who actually have\ngood reasons for believing the things\nthat you believe is that you try to\nexplain to them all of the reasons why\ntheir idea is not as good as your idea\nand what happens when you try to explain\nthings like that to them and it's no\nmean like it greeted with a yeah I could\nsee that but I still think this way but\nhe'll still they'll still go out of\ntheir way to you know do their own idea\nto make sure it's executed in the way\nthey think okay they don't let go their\nan idea yeah okay so yeah so I think\nthat what you really got to do is first\nof all understand that you're dealing\nwith the ego and that has its own kind\nof script so it's not about logic\nanymore it's not about the value of your\nideas because this this person's mind is\njust not receptive like he doesn't care\nor they don't care what the merit of\nyour idea versus the merit of their idea\ndoes that make sense to you like they\njust don't examine the facts at all\nthey're just it's all about ego and it's\nlike my idea is better because this is\nwhat I believe and other people are\nwrong so I think if you try to convince\nthem with logic it's not going to work\nso if you want to be more manipulative\nyou can be ego stroking which is not\nsomething that I usually recommend but\nyou can appeal to their ego do you know\nhow to do that\nmm-hmm not exactly and okay okay some\npeople just sort of had an instinctive\nsense of it but I think the other thing\nthat you can try doing is try to ask\nthem what their opinion is and ask them\nto explain it and then there's like this\nis like a group decision-making thing\nI'm a little bit confused by this yeah\nokay and then you you so what you want\nto do is instead of put forth your\nopinion something you can try to ask\nthem for their opinion and then reflect\nback what they say so like if they say I\nthink we should use a yellow sharpie\nbecause yellow is the best color you can\nsay okay so it sounds like you think a\nyellow Sharpie is the best way to go\nbecause of this and this and then you\ncan ask other people what they believe\nas well and then like you can say like\nokay what do you think and someone will\nsay orange and what do you think and\nsomeone will say orange or you can say\nlike okay well I was thinking in\naddition to considering yellow we could\nconsider orange and here's why I think\norange would be better and then now this\nis a tricky part because you have to\ntake control of the conversation so this\ncould be hard then when you've put forth\nyour idea then you start asking other\npeople and I'm assuming this is like a\ngroup setting where everyone is talking\ntogether or no yeah okay then you ask\nother people then and there which one\nthey think is better and you kind of you\nsay okay like so you know we have two\noptions yellow or orange what do you\nthink we should do then you ask\nopen-ended questions and then you ask\nthe third person what do you think we\nshould do what do you think we should do\nand then you turn back to this person\nyou say okay so you mentioned yellow\nbecause of this this and these are those\nall sound like good reasons to me at the\nsame time don't say but never say but\nokay\nyeah at the same time it sounds like\nmost of the group thinks that orange is\nbetter or orange is should be the call\nthat we should go that for these what do\nyou think about that yeah and then\nthey're going to say okay yeah I hear\nwhat everyone's saying but I still think\nyellow is better and you could say okay\nso I it sounds like you still are\nconvinced that yellow is better we're\ngonna go with orange because that's what\nthe group thinks and then you just\nperiod\ncan you do that does that work I could\ntry okay what cuz like you can't do that\nif this person is your boss mmm no no\nthe bus yeah so like I think the main\nthing there is that that you know like\nyou you really have to like control the\ncon this is like some subtle kind of\nboardroom like dynamics kind of stuff\ndoes that make sense like do you do you\nsee what I'm saying so you ask for their\nopinion because the more that if you\ngive them a chance to speak and be heard\nand be recognized\nthen you're gonna disarm the ego and\nyou'll get less resistance but if you\nargue with them and you if you use\nphrases like but then it's gonna like\nmake their ego bigger because they're\ngonna fight and then they're not gonna\nlisten mm-hmm yeah do you feel like you\ncould do this okay I think I could yeah\nwhat do you think about this I mean it\nseems easy enough it's just I just wish\nthey weren't so disagreeable and so yeah\nso so that so that to you learn how to\nsit with that so now we're gonna talk\nabout you again okay so you wish they\nweren't so disagreeable mmm that sounds\nlike kind of like an understatement to\nme okay so it's fine for you to be\nsubtle and meek and understated to the\nrest of the world but you should be\nhonest with yourself\nyeah right so it's fine that you want to\npresent this meek exterior and all that\nthat's fine so I get that you're you\nknow your stream is chill and not a\nwhole lot of ocean but within yourself\nyou should be honest with yourself are\nyou honest with yourself\nand most of the time I think I mm-hmm\ngood so I would just encourage you to\nlike continue to be honest with yourself\nright and acknowledge the way that you\nfeel acknowledge the way that he makes\nyou feel and also if you want to do\nsomething to disarm his point of view\njust understand that it's like he's just\ntrying to make you feel small like\nthat's actually what he's trying to do\nbecause the ego pumps itself up and puts\nother people down because the smaller he\nmakes you feel the bigger he's gonna\nfeel and he's this big ball of like\njelly on the inside that is not\nconfident in himself so if he can make\nother people feel small then he can make\nhimself feel big and then he feels like\na big boy get support as being hands on\nand so just try to recognize that this\nactually has nothing to do with you it\njust has everything to do with him and\nif you I'm sorry if I'm torpedoing\nwhatever your work relations are by\ntalking about all the stuff but um you\nknow I think my hope is that that'll\nhelp you interact with him and also for\nyou to feel more confident in what you\nbelieve you know which I I know you\nalready feel confident but you feel a\nhundred percent right mm-hmm you okay\nany thoughts or questions um no I think\nthat's a really good yeah\nthat's a really nice way to put it it's\nnice to talk about it yeah do you feel\nokay being arrogant um yeah a little bit\nas long as I'm aware of it\nI feel beautiful right I can do with\nthat yeah very good yeah I completely\nagree so so Kathleen I think the main\nthing here is just so we're not perfect\nbeings right like our minds are just\nlike this complete mess of different\nlike processes and you know personality\ntraits and experiences and stuff like\nthat in your case here's what I would\nkind of sum up the first is that I still\ndon't really know if you if there's some\npart of you that's like insecure deep\ndown like I get those kinds of vibes but\nanytime I kind of dig in that direction\nit sounds like there's really nothing\nthere so I'm still kind of confused by\nthat so I'm just gonna assume that I'm\nwrong there and I'm not sniffing\nanything that's that's legit\nbecause you seem to me to be actually\nquite self-assured and like kind of who\nyou are and stuff like that\nI think I'm sorry maybe I just think I'm\nmore insecure than I am I don't know\nsorry\njust thinking about it just now I'm just\nlike maybe I just want to feel insecure\nor something I don't know you know what\nsay more about that help me understand\nhim I guess like I I wanted to believe\nI'm who insecure then I am mm-hm maybe\nbecause I mean it's it's easier to to be\ninsecure and then not pursue the things\nthat you really want to do because of\nthose insecurities um then actually go\nfor what you want to do she's just my\nfear we hadn't what do you think about\nthat what do you think about the words\nthat just came out of your mouth yeah\nit's um yeah maybe I'm holding myself\nback a little bit on things that I don't\nactually believe in yeah what do you\nmean by things you don't believe in\nmaybe I don't\nmaybe when I say I can't do things I am\nwrong and I don't believe that at all\nand I just like to tell myself that yes\nvery good why do you tell yourself that\nso I stopped myself from going for\nthings and failing at things very good\nyeah yeah how long have you been\navoidant a failure\nlong time yeah I family what say it's\ngay yes see see how it said parallel\nit's in parallel you see that there's a\npart of you that is actually confident\nbecause you recognize that you do fail\nand that's what we call brushing it off\nyou see what you did there\nlike sometimes I screw up and that's ok\ncool you're like you're okay with that\nright you're okay with failure yeah yeah\nlike you kind of have to be yeah right\nso you can kind of joke about it but\nthen there's this other part of you this\nis why it's so weird it's like playing\nit's like talking to like two different\npeople there's like this other thing\nwithin you that is this weird kind of\ninsecurity which anytime I try to dig it\nlike disappears it's like I'm trying to\ncatch missed and like I just close my\nfist and there's nothing there so it's\nlike bizarre but I I do think that you\nare holding yourself back in some way I\nthink that I would agree with you that\nyou probably have this thing going on\nwhere you have the comfort of not being\na failure if you really don't try yeah\nright like if you don't really try it's\nnot really that you're a failure it's\njust that you didn't try yeah yeah yeah\ngood and and so just notice that too\nbecause that thing too it's it's not\nthat that part of you is stupid that\npart of you is just insecure right it is\nafraid of what's gonna happen if it\nreally puts itself to the test if you go\nall out its afraid that it's gonna fall\nshort yep that sounds right yeah so what\ndo we do about that Kathleen ignore that\npart no no no no ignoring it as what\nyou've been doing okay that's why you\ndidn't know it was there hmm you trained\nyourself to not look at it just accept\nit I guess and just spend how do you do\nthat\njust become okay with the fact that it\nmight not work well that yeah I might\nhave been right that I shouldn't have\ngone for it but that's okay\nyeah so I want you to envision so like\nhow old were you when you first started\nto stop trying because you were afraid\nof failing um I never stopped trying\nokay keep trying but like I always have\nthat look I hold back a little bit I\nguess along the way yeah but I guess I'm\njust a young age yeah yeah so so like\nlike give me give me a number like\nenvision yourself like when you were\nwhen you started to hold back just a\nlittle bit right like you're at school\nand you know the answer but you don't\nsay it I do that look yeah I can tell\nyoung primary school eight years old\ngood so I want you to imagine that eight\nyear old person right mmm imagine she's\nyour little sister and she tells you\nthat sometimes I know the answer in\nschool and I don't raise my hand and I\ndon't want to say it what would you say\nto her\nI'd say I'm just you don't have to do it\nall the time but you can go for it once\nin a while and beautiful it's perfect\nbrilliant like okay right it's not go\nfor it all the time it's like every once\nin a while it's okay to try yeah like do\nyou guys the kid like I'm not the only\none that thought that was a perfect\nanswer right you guys yeah okay twitch\nchat agrees yeah cuz cuz it's because\nyou don't want to be fake you don't want\nto be like yeah go for it like you can\ndo it man that's not what you tell the\neight-year-old that's not what the\neight-year-old needs to hear the\neight-year-old needs here's what I'm\ngonna tell you what I heard in it first\nof all safety you're giving the\neight-year-old safety right you're not\npushing them into territory that they're\nnot ready to move into you're also\ngiving them encouragement\nright and you're also giving them like\nforgiveness for falling short and you're\ndoing it ahead of time you're saying\nthat you don't have to avoid failure and\ntherefore you can give it your all\nbecause if you fail that's okay you can\ndo that every once in a while you can\ngive it a shot you can put your toes in\nthe water like it's such a perfect thing\nto say that's what you tell yourself you\ndon't [ __ ] ignore it that's not good\nyou tell you something that what you\njust just go back and watch the vaad and\nlike write it down on a piece of paper\nand that's exactly what you tell\nyourself we just said it's okay to go\nfor it it's okay to be a little bit\nlouder it's okay to be a little bit more\nvocal it's okay to to go for it every\nonce in a while beautiful right so\nthat's if anyone is wondering if\nanyone's watching if you want to\nencourage an anxious person to like try\nlike that's what she just said is just\nthe perfect thing to say right you give\nthem safety you give them space you give\nthem they control it you're not pushing\nthem you're not like oh do it go do it\nspeak no it's none of that\nit's calmness it's space it's a little\nlittle pat on the back and a little\nshove but just a tiny tiny tiny one\nbeautifully play okay I forgot what we\nwere talking about but I just got\nenamored with what you just said so\nanyway what were you talking about oh\nyeah how your insecurity holds you back\nand your fear of failure and you don't\ntry and all that kind of good stuff good\njob by the way if you did you did you\nunderstand that about yourself um not\nnot really no no I just assumed I was\ninsecure about things yeah\nyeah but so that's the it's it's really\nit's subtle right because I think you\nhave this insecurity but I actually\nthink deep down you're very confident in\nfact you're your agreeableness is very\nlow there's a reef emitting called the\nBig Five personality model it's a\npersonality okay it's like a system of\nunderstanding personality traits and\nyou're very calm\nbut you're actually like you don't like\nonce you decide something it's like hard\nto change your mind right yeah yeah like\neveryone will think that you're playing\nalong and you agree with them but deep\ndown you're just gonna be like this is\nall dumb I'm just gonna be quiet but\neveryone is wrong kind of yes yeah yeah\nyeah so so there's that there's that\nkind of like deep set sort of I don't\nmean this in a bad way but there's that\nkind of deep set arrogance that's like\nkind of low agreeableness and it's just\nlike you're just not gonna you're like\nit's hard to convince you actually like\nonce you've made up your mind that's\nthat's the way I'd put it so that's what\nagreeableness is it's like people's\nwillingness to change their mind and\nyou're not actually willing to change\nyour mind so you managed to do all these\nother things to just manage your own\nfeelings and anger and all that kind of\nstuff but I think that yeah so is there\nsomething else that you wanted to talk\nabout are we kind of good um I think\nthat was um I think that was a lot of it\nI guess yeah I think I was really\nhopeful okay what was helpful about it\nI'm glad you I'm glad it was helpful um\nuh most of it ya know just dealing just\ndealing with the way I see people I\nguess it really does help me because I\ndon't really often yeah think about it\ntoo much and just what I can do about it\nI guess really really hope yeah me so I\nhope it helps and and feel free to just\nlike shoot me a message if that doesn't\nwork well and you want to talk a little\nbit more privately about details and\nstuff I may be able to give you some\nmore concrete advice about how to\napproach challenging people in the\nworkplace but you know it's it's\nsometimes details can be helpful but I\ndo a lot of this stuff with like\ninvestment banks and and people just\nplaces where they're just people who are\nreally not very open minded or nice or\ncare about other people's feelings\nbut you know I I think so a couple of\nother things that I would encourage you\nto just think about Kathleen so the\nfirst is that it's okay to be angry with\npeople\nlike would you describe yourself as an\nangry person I mean I feel like I do\nhave a bit of rage in me yep yeah I\nwould say definitely I think it's just\nburied pretty low and and you're you're\nreally good at putting on front so it's\nit's really tested my ability to like\npeek underneath today which has been fun\nand and so I think it's okay to feel\nthose those feelings of anger and it\ndoesn't make you right or wrong just\nacknowledge that you have them and and\nand then the other thing is I'd say stop\ndoing some of these mental gymnastics\nright so at the more that you feel the\nthings that you let your like the more\nthat you understand the way that you\nfeel about something and if someone\nmakes you feel small you know just just\nacknowledge that that person is making\nyou feel that way but the cool thing and\nhow old are you now if you don't mind me\nasking at 26 okay so like there's 26\nyear old Kathleen who's actually like a\ncomplete badass right sure yeah yeah\nyeah yeah yeah absolutely right see you\ndo have confidence and so just remember\nthat that 26 year old is actually there\ntoo right there's the 8 year old and\nthere's the 26 year old they're both\nthere and the weird thing is like they\ntake turns driving your mind and it\ncould be like really really confusing so\njust remember that there's actually a 26\nyear old who is like really awesome at\nwhat they do who actually doesn't need\nto be any better like you get that you\ndon't actually like need to be better on\nstream right like people come for you\nyeah but I could still beat bad out\nthere you can be a better but but you\ndon't need to be anyone else no no I\ndon't need it be anyone else no and do\nyou cut yourself some slack for not\nbeing the best version of you every day\nso that's the next thing okay so what do\nyou think about that I mean I had I cut\nmyself slack if I had that they always\nsay like be the best years like but I\nwasn't today mm-hmm\nyeah so this this this is gonna be a\nwhole other I'm I we're gonna have to if\nyou want to do a follow-up at some point\nwe'll dig into that but not to like look\nso just think about this right so here's\nthe eight-year-old who's thinking those\nthoughts and what is the twenty\nsix-year-old say to the eight-year-old\nwho's like no but I like I missed a\nquestion on the test and then the 26\nyear old is like but but the\neight-year-olds like no I could have\nstudied harder and I could have gotten a\nperfect score everyone tells me to be\nthe best version of myself and I'm not\nbeing the best version of myself\nwhat would I say to them yeah oh good\nthat there's always just another day\nanother task or anything and what does\nthe eight-year-old say in response to\nthem probably like but I'll be bad at\nthat one I'll say who might be the very\ngood yeah so that's not the right thing\nto say\nso you haven't figured out what to say\nso like your last time so I think you\ndid a really good job of processing a\nlot of what we talked about you came out\nwith something beautiful but what you\njust said the eight-year-old is gonna\nslap away yeah they're gonna be like\nthat works for other people but it\ndoesn't work for me right that's what\nthe it you know affects other people are\nallowed to make mistakes I'm not allowed\nto make mistakes you don't understand\nwho I am yeah yeah\nit looks like lady you're crazy you're\n26 what did you know I mean so that's\ngonna be so we'll get to that but do you\nsee that you see it what you're new into\nyourself like you hold yourself to an\nimpossible standard like at least tell\nme you see that you don't have to do\nanything with it\nbe yeah a little bit I guess\nsee you don't even see it yeah of course\nof course you could be better yeah\nother people hold themselves to\nimpossible standards you your standard\nis not impossible right you can do it if\nyou work hard enough and if you were\nbetter you could do it yeah yeah I think\nmaybe yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so I\ndon't think we're there yet that's okay\nokay so we'll just just deal with the\nrage deal with the you know the funny\nthing about insecurity and and letting\nyourself holding yourself back so that\nyou don't really have to be a complete\nfailure yeah right and and and get in\ntouch with the confident awesome 26 year\nold and then we'll leave we'll leave the\npart of you that can be perfect for\nanother day like the part of you that\nhas to be perfect I should say huh\nperfect perfect overrated I don't have\nto be yeah what do you have to be what\ndo you have to be what's the standard\nyou hold yourself to if not perfections\nbetter yeah right so that's dangerous\nbecause because what that also tells me\nis that you're not good enough like\nyou're not sure yeah it's dangerous\nbeing better the the endless pursuit of\nbeing better is one of the most\ndangerous things you can do to yourself\nbecause it always means if you if you\ncan be better it means you're not good\nenough and that's something that we have\nto figure out how to get that out of you\nwhat tear that out root step I thought\nlike everyone stripes like to improve\nthemselves soon yeah why do you think\nthe world is such an unhappy place\nseriously yeah I work with a lot of very\nsuccessful people who always want to be\nbetter and I try very hard to teach them\nto be okay with the person that they are\nright yeah but like then would they work\nis hard and it's very good very good\nright so a lot of people think that this\nthe desire to be better is the only way\nto motivate yourself to do the best that\nyou can which happens to be untrue so\nthere is a different way right there's\ndifferent way dr. MA duty so this is\nwhat I want you to do the next time you\nstream it's not about whether you can be\nbetter but you're gonna show up and\nyou're gonna do the best that you can\nfor the the people that are watching and\nyou're not gonna be perfect and could\nyou be better yeah but like it's about\nthem it's not about you so whether\nyou're better or not better has nothing\nto do with I mean that's all in your\nhead that's all ego does that make sense\nit's about that it's about being the\nperson that you need to be for the\npeople that are watching and you devote\nyourself to that and you devote yourself\nto them instead of yourself because so\nfar the the pursuit of being better is\nabout who myself I guess absolutely\nright it's all about you so that needs\nto change you can still put your best\nfoot forward and have it be about other\npeople yeah what do you think about that\nhmm that's a little bit confusing for me\nbecause it's yeah although it is for\nmyself like I just did this like amazing\nif I put myself to it and I was like hey\nI could do this amazing video I could be\nthis person who makes amazing videos and\nmakes this type thing and that was\nreally good for the audience to say I\nmuch like so but notice what you're\ndoing so the the main thing that you're\ntalking about is you could be an amazing\nperson the audience comes after ya your\nfocus is on yourself that needs to\nchange if you want to put your best foot\nforward and also forgive yourself for\nbeing what you are you need to put the\naudience first right so you can wake up\nin the mall\nstandards h-how'd if i think that what\nif i think they want the thing that's\nreally hard to do it impossible\nso you can only make them you can only\ngive them what you can give them right\nokay so if they have impossible\nstandards like they have impossible\nstandards but they don't yeah they\nactually have very reasonable standards\nI know this is absolutely insane but I\nactually find twitch chat to be quite\nreasonable and quite intelligent no they\nare yeah but you can't tell them that\nyeah I know that's go straight to their\nhead talk about it you go anyway so this\nis all sneak preview stop just chew on\nit a little bit but I think okay let's\ntry let's try a little bit of meditation\nis that okay yeah okay I want you to\nclose your eyes okay so you could be\nbetter right yes yeah I want you to just\nfeel that for a second is it thoughts is\nit sensations what is it sensations\nyoung yeah the the feeling of not being\ngood and often that you could be better\ncomes from where let's just talk about\nit it's kind of weird mmm where do you\nfeel instead where do you feel not good\nenough it's just all over no good okay\nso just just feel just take a moment I\nwant you to just take a snapshot of just\nwhat it feels like when I say like yeah\nyou're you know you could be better and\nthen you're like yeah absolutely\nabsolutely like you understand exactly\nwhat I mean so just take a snapshot of\nthe way that you feel and find that not\ngood enough miss\nokay yeah you got it mm-hmm oh yes sir\nokay okay so I want you to open your\neyes okay I want you to do this I know\nit's hard yeah it's happening\noh is it yeah very good good enough\ngreat okay so I want you to take your\nright right thumb and block your right\nnostril and breathe in through your left\nyou feel nervous no okay\nand now block the other side good\nbreathe out now breathe in through the\nsame nostril switch good breathe out now\nbreathe in again excellent switch out in\nswitch out\nokay keep going close your eyes remember\nto breathe in switch is it hard as your\nnose clogged no no no it's just like I'm\njust a little pressure yeah that's okay\ngood so just notice those feelings that\nkeep reading through them don't stop hmm\nyou okay yeah yeah so okay so breathe in\ngood switch and breathe out then when\nyou're ready in through the same nostril\nand then switch and then out in switch\nout in switch continue at your own pace\nsit up straight good\naren't you to do nine breaths that's a\nlot yeah oh it's okay just take it slow\nvery good\nslow down a little bit actually just\nkeep going for like I'll tell you when\nto stop okay okay focus on the air\ncoming in from one nostril and leaving\nfrom the other practice for about 60\nmore seconds\nvery good\nbig deep breath\nokay go ahead and let your eyes remain\nclosed finish the breath that you're on\nlet your hands relax and now notice the\nperson that you are try to find that\nsense of inadequacy you could be better\nright if you listen yeah it's persistent\nisn't it is it as strong as it used to\nbe known as much so though I was kept\nthinking about how stupid I looked nice\ngood good perfect alright so you got to\ndo this for like five minutes a day okay\nyou can open your eyes okay yeah so\nyou're gonna have to practice this a lot\nokay you're I say this with with great\nrespect but you're not a natural at this\nparticular technique I'm nothing\nI know it's hard for you I can tell you\nmust practice okay yeah\nall right so thoughts or questions\nbefore we wrap
