    "transcript": "I know what abnormal looks like I'm an\nexpert at the abnormal and y'all are\n[ __ ] normal you guys are just normal\npeople that had something [ __ ] bad\nhappen to you and then your brain is\nwired a certain way and then you use\nthese you build up these walls around\nall of these negative feelings and so\nnow you guys need immense courage\nbecause taking those walls down is\n[ __ ] it's hard\nokay good so let's start with\nintroductions and so if you guys just\nwant to tell me how I should refer to\nyou and what and once again guys huge\nhuge props to actually you know coming\non today and talking about this it's a\nreally sensitive topic affects a lot of\npeople and I really think that you guys\nare just doing an awesome job at you\nknow being so vocal about things that\nyou struggle with because a lot of\npeople struggle with this and to be able\nto put your face out there and and put\nyour name out there and live on the\nInternet is really like you're just your\nballs are gigantic so so let's start\nwith so let's just start a little bit\nwith like brief introductions so maybe\njust tell me how you want the rest of\nthe group to refer to you and then tell\nme a little bit about why you're joining\nthe group today or how we can help you\nout and let's kind of start in the top\nleft with the dude in the blue\nsweatshirt I I guess you can call me\nghost for the jury okay this dream\nawesome goes to welcome in I this is\nkind of surreal yeah tell me about it\nwhat do you mean by surreal I don't know\nit's it's kind of uh\nI've watched you as this sort of\nabstract person where it's a one-way\nshirt of thing that I'm watching you and\nnow you're here interacting with us is\njust it feels a little bit oh that's a\nreal I was there's a lot of like surreal\nthings there but okay and is there\nsomething in particular that you were\nhoping to kind of better understand\ntoday or something that we can help you\nwith um I just saw felt like it would be\na good idea I tried not to\nokay think it Charla something good\nwould come okay great\nwell welcome ghosts and and next let's\ngo to yeah I guess you guys don't see\nyeah exactly\nyeah awesome so my name is Richard I\nlive in California and first of all I\njust liked it not\nstock decay for letting all the viewers\non so I'm really really excited for this\nmy big thing with porn addiction is that\nthere's like I so throughout my\nexperience I've always placed a value\njudgment when I when I first got into\nthe act I was king of the animal kingdom\nand the two weeks went on and then I\nstarted to see it as like a shameful act\nand then more time went on I I don't\nknow I've like I've tried to differ a\nlot of different value propositions of\nlike what it is like I see like right\nnow I'm in a state of where um I see it\nas you know I see like a little bit of\nbeauty to it I like even though it's\nartificial I still think there there is\nroom for it in the world\nbut the one thing that I'm struggling\nwith is like the dopamine and like the\nrelationship with the frontal lobe\nthat's a big thing on why that's\nsomething that I kind of want to moving\nforward I kind of want to discuss the\ntopic of like like nofap and like just\nways that like not using porn as a form\nenix of escapism use it more as like a\nway to like create things in your\nreality I don't know maybe I'm kind of\nrambling now but I'm really excited to\nbe on and listen Richard let me hear let\nme tell you what I'm hearing I'm hearing\nthat you've thought about this a lot and\nalso you've tried a lot of different\nthings and you're curious about how\ndifferent ways to look at this you're\ncurious you have like some thoughts\nabout nofap you have some thoughts about\nyou know how you apply values to it and\nand so you're really here to just learn\nand kind of like like sort of sort some\nof this stuff out and maybe some of the\nother folks here myself included can\nlike help you sort that out maybe we can\ntry to understand this a little bit\nbetter to come to some answers together\nis that absolutely perfect perfect right\non the middleman and and next we have\nthe the dude yes hey so you can call me\nHarold\nokay and I guess I'm Harold the one\nthing the one thing things\nit's it's we're talking to you as as\nghost said because I just only watched\nyour stuff and now I'm actually talking\nto you welcome man thanks I guess the\nonly thing I've been really thinking\nabout is I've been trying to quit this\nfor four years so I guess I want to\nexplore reasons why it's been so hard to\nkick it because I mean for four years\nI've been trying to quit I mean I've\ngone lengths of time without it but then\nI just always come back and it just\nseems like super hard to kick for some\nreason I've tried lots of different\nstuff and can't really find the right\nway to get rid of it okay sure so so\nmaybe what we can do is is try to like\ncompare and contrast a little bit see\nwhat people have tried what seems to\nhave worked what hasn't and then maybe\ncome to some kind of consensus about how\nto help you guys overcome a porn\naddiction and so I think the next icon\nI'm seeing is myself right this the yeah\nand then down in the bottom left yeah\nwelcome dude yeah oh my name is Erin I\nguess my porn addiction is lasted eight\nyears now yeah okay I guess the one\nthing that I really wanted to address is\nthat the first couple times that I like\nwell I addressed the issue pretty early\non to myself but when I was trying to\nfind support and others there was this\nsort of stigma I guess that porn isn't\nan addiction that will share something\nthat just like hit me pretty hard and I\nguess that's one big thing that I want\nto bring up during this stream is that\nlike pornography can be a severe\naddiction just like others but in\ndifferent ways of course okay yeah I was\none of the main things that I want to\naddress so Erin it sounds like\nyou really looked for help in support\nand you you really sort of judged for it\nand and kind of you weren't really met\nwith a whole lot of support or\nunderstanding or and and that was that\nthat is a big problem absolutely so\nthank you for bringing that up and then\nnext I see like anime portrait with blue\neyes yes hello\nhey man welcome I am Virgil on the\ndiscord okay and welcome Virgil thank\nyou appreciate you having us here\nI've been struggling with this issue the\nissue of porn addiction since I was 14\nokay ballpark for us how long ago that\nwas uh about ten years okay probably 11\nactually okay so it sounds like you me\nstruggling with this for a long time\nyeah and knowing what I know now about\nhow porn affects your brain your\nconnections and everything it's been\nreally tough to quit it because it was\nintroduced to me by my by my oh sorry\nthat's okay man take your time it's\n[Music]\nabsolutely I can't I came across it in\nmy form of years and I think that's that\nit's it's damaged me in a way that's\nvery hard to sort of recognize and deal\nwith and it's just something in general\nthat I just want to be able to quit it\nbecause it's just it's something that's\nmore difficult to quit then maybe people\nmight think absolutely people people\ndefinitely downplay the issue more than\nthey should I don't think that they take\nit seriously absolutely guys absolutely\nso I'm gonna I'm gonna just jump out\nwhat something how many of y'all feel\ndamaged I do sorry I just see but in\nthis came a little quick what do you\nmean by damaged you kind of I'm just\ncurious if that word sort of resonates\nlike Virgil used the word he felt like\nyou know being exposed to such such an\nearly age completely damaged him and he\nused he used literally the word damaged\nand I was just thinking about how\npowerful that word is and I was just\ncurious how much what he experienced\nkind of resonates with the rest of y'all\nand just fun isn't a thousand percent\nand and can you can you share a little\nbit more by what you mean by that\nwhoever said a thousand percent okay my\nI thought I came across it when I was 11\nand I had a friend at the time and he\nyou know he talked about how amazing it\nwas I thought I thought about looking at\nit before and it sort of spurred me to\nlook at it and it was like tasting sugar\nfor the first time sure and because it's\nsuch a sort of new phenomenon in the\nhigh-speed Internet form that we have it\npeople don't really understand the risks\nand it's not really explained to you you\nknow you're taught not to overeat sugar\nbut you're not taught to over consume\nthis yet it's sort of from the moment I\nwas exposed to it it was like every day\ntwo to three times a day at least\njust from then on for about the first\ntwo years before I realized there were\nany negative effects and you sort of\nrealized it as you start to grow more\ndesensitized to regular stuff and you\nrealize it doesn't affect you like it\nused to and you get exhausted with it so\nit's kind of like moving to not to be it\nlike hyperbolic but like moving to\nharder drugs you can sort of keep\nsearching for that hi yep so it sounds\nlike you you have to go to more kind of\nmore extreme pornography to get the kind\nof dopamine response\nyeah yeah absolutely thank you so much\nfor sharing that goes so so I'm hearing\nfrom a lot of you guys that you all feel\nyou all feel damaged in some way yes all\nright so let's just put a pin in that\nidea for just a second let's finish\ndoing introductions and then you know my\nhope is that if nothing else I don't\nknow what we're gonna uncover about\ndopamine or neuro development or any of\nthat stuff but if nothing else I would\nlove it if if we could you know start\nyou guys on the path of I don't know\nwhat we're gonna do about porn but if we\ncan start to help you feel less damaged\nand in more whole that's kind of at the\ntop of my list for like like just first\nsteps that I don't know if we can solve\nthe rest of it but but if we can even do\nsomething about that that's just that\nfeels really important to me can we\ncontinue with introductions so down in\nthe in the middle right oh you're muted\nbuddy\ncan you guys hear him no no so I don't\nknow if we want to move to the\ndiscussion just right over to the right\nmove yeah we'll circle back to you buddy\nso then the other anime portrait yeah me\nyeah George you can call me George if\nit's easier to pronounce okay I've been\nstruggling with this addiction for like\nsix years okay a discovery really early\nage and like 11 C 11 or 10 years old I\ndon't really remember actually no it was\nlike 12 or 13 years old and pretty much\nI in the first years I didn't really do\nit too much but then when my life\nstarted became more difficult and I\nbecame more depressed and stuff I sort\nof used it as an escape tool and then\nyou just you just bite a lot of control\nI grew more desensitize\nto stuff and I started over sexualizing\npeople that's one way I feel damaged\nlike I started over sexualizing stuff\nokay and can you help me understand what\nyou mean by that\nlike for example I was in school and I\nwas in class and I looked at a girl that\nI was at a crush on and then I was\nstarted I will start thinking about\nthings I will do with her like stuff\nlike that even in the street when I\nlooked at her woman okay so like I\nstarted over sexualizing stuff and II\ngrew to a point where I was feeling\ndisgust to myself which didn't help\nbecause then it made me feel more\ndepressed and made me wanna jerk off\neven more\nsure so yeah that's something that I've\nbeen trying to drive is struggling with\nI tried doing nofap I actually did like\na month but then I just went back in\ninto it because I was struggling with\nschool and other surfing yeah okay and\ndo you want to try so thank you thank\nyou very much you said it's it's George\nyeah yeah okay and do you want to try\nthe one person that we had to skip are\nwe are we good you want to try\nintroducing yourself or you think it's\nOh\nstill not getting audio okay\nno audio yet okay do you want to try\nrejoining the call or yeah why don't you\ntry rejoining and if not then you know\nwe'll have you four thumbs up and thumbs\ndowns you're gonna be our our virtual up\nvote down vote machine depending on what\nother people are saying okay so okay so\nlet me just think for a second\nokay so I'm gonna just toss out a series\nof just thoughts\nokay topics and then you guys let me\nknow which direction you want to go so\nthe first is the sense of being damaged\nI think we should really explore because\nlike George was saying there's something\nlike a cycle right so we can also talk\nabout this about the effect when you\nmasturbate it it serves as like a\ndopamine release and helps us feel good\nlike so we release endorphins and other\nkinds of like endogenous chemicals that\nmake us feel good and so there's anytime\nyou have an addictive behavior there's\nlike the addiction in and of itself and\nthen there's using the addiction is a\ncoping mechanism for other things\nbecause basically like our brain learns\na surefire way to release certain neuro\nchemicals that we're going to make us\nfeel a particular way so if we're\nfeeling bad about ourselves and we've\nkind of got like this like guaranteed\nway to feel better\noftentimes we'll turn to that addictive\nbehavior and so there's something of a\ncycle of addictive behavior and feeling\nbad and then using it to make ourselves\nfeel better so we can talk about the\nsort of cycle of addiction in terms of\nfeeling bad and then making ourselves\nfeel better we could talk about being\ndamaged we should definitely talk about\nwhat other people understand or don't\nunderstand and how it sounds like the\nother thing that you guys feel is\nisolated right so we can kind of talk\nabout isolation and stigma and then we\ncan\nshould probably talk about nofap and\njust what you guys think about that and\nthen the last thing that I'm gonna just\nput on the table for is control of the\nmind so what I would like to do and\nmaybe this is where I can actually help\nis that our mind functions in a\nparticular way like we have certain\nimpulses and then we have certain\nfeelings and then those impulses and\nfeelings kind of do some sort of you\nknow inner calculation and then result\nin us engaging in a particular behavior\nand so how can we understand like what\nis going on in your mind to actually\ncontrol it in a way that you want to to\nachieve what you want so that's gonna be\nlike almost like a very engineering\nstandpoint and I'm gonna ask you guys a\nlot about like the sequence of events\nover like the span of five minutes of\nlike what you experience what happens in\nyour head you know how do you struggle\ninternally what ends up happening and\nand so that's something that I think we\nyou know hopefully I'll be able to help\nin that way because that tends to apply\nto all addictions so what exactly\nso cycle being damaged being isolated\nstigma nofap or controlling the mind\nwhat do y'all want to talk about you\nguys want to go down the line just like\nwe did for introductions or or is the\nmost poignant which one's the most\npoignant you damaged okay so actually\nlet's just take a step back so how would\nyou guys so let's say someone you say\nthat you tell someone that you're\naddicted to pornography and they say oh\nman that's like that's completely normal\nlike there's nothing like special or\nwrong or different about that can we\nactually just start by sort of defining\nwhen you guys say that you're addicted\nhelp us understand or yourselves\nunderstand like where do you draw the\nline like why do you think that you have\na problem and like what do you think is\nnormal let's just start by defining what\nwe're talking about are we going in an\nodor at all no just anyone just you know\njust jump in\nokay for me when I had the realization\nit was when it was like 4:00 in the\nmorning\nand I'm watching for like a few hours\nand and then like the next day I wanted\nto watch more it was just like the ever\nneeding like urge for that consumption\nokay and it just never went away it was\nalways there always it sounds like a\nhunger that cannot be satisfied\nabsolutely yep agree so that sounds like\nthat's a pretty universal experience yes\ndefinitely yeah can you share somebody I\nlike to know go for it sorry ghosts um\nyeah it seems like it's sort of this\nthing that overpowers all other things I\nfirst sort of realized it was a problem\nat around 13 and I did know that for\nthree months because I was starting to\nlearn about how it worked and I felt\ngreat and some of that like bad things I\nhad noticed when I was a child I was\nable to remember anything that I wanted\nto so if I watched a documentary and you\nasked me about any part of it I'd be\nable to tell you exactly what was said\nbut then once I started watching porn\nI know it's over a really sort of a long\nperiod of time my cognitive abilities\nwere sort of tapering off even though I\nwas meant to be growing and then I\nrealized when I didn't know FUP again\nthey start to come back and I was able\nto remember things again fast oh yeah\nand I realized they got really bad when\nI was 16 and in England we have these\nthings called GCSEs I seem like finals\nother trum sort of similar thing so\nbefore these big tests I was meant to be\nrevising getting eight hours of sleep\nand I was watching porn to the point\nwhere there were three days in a row\nwe're collectively in these three days I\ngot two hours of sleep and I was\nsleeping for around 40 minutes because I\nguess I was using it as like an anxiety\nand because I was so I felt so pressured\nby these tests that I was just\nconstantly consuming okay and that's\nwhen I sort of realized it was a really\nlike it was devouring my life Wow yeah\nso I think it was Aaron I saw you\nnodding like a madman\nwhen ghost was talking so does that does\nthat mirror your own is it okay if I if\nI just call attention to things that I\nnotice for you guys absolutely yeah hold\nout I'm good with that\nokay don't dr. kay just want to let you\nknow I don't have my voice but okay I\nsign that video my I'm sorry I did not\nsay voice on video you can call me\nSquatch I'm 24 I'm from South Florida\nand I had a significant traumatic\nexperience that happened in my life when\nI was a kid at 11 years old that ever\nsince then caused me to have a real\nsevere addiction to pornography and I've\nbeen struggling with it to this day so\nit's about all that honestly I fight\nevery single day and its really really\nrough and even though I don't have my\nvideo I you guys saw my face I'm very\nvery happy to be here and I'm looking\nforward to having this discussion with\nyou guys awesome and welcome squash and\nI'm sorry to hear that something bad\nhappened to you in your your teen years\nI'm also noticing a trend that it sounds\nlike for a lot of you guys like stuff\nstarted very very early yeah so we\nshould probably just I just got to think\nabout that in terms of the developing\nbrain but Aaron you were you were\nnodding along as his ghost was talking\nyeah I also experienced a pretty much\nthe same exact thing I actually managed\nto\nbreak the addiction for two years and\nduring that time I was like at my peak\nacademically and mentally and my\nhappiness was like through the roof\nbut uh then some things happens life\nhappens and I relapsed I guess I'll call\nit that and it's been just repeating\nthat cycle like you said over and over\nagain and if you I mean anybody else\ncurious about how Aaron broke the the\naddiction for two years I think that's\nincredibly curious about that because\nthere's so my thing is that I think you\nsaid step four there's like something\nthere's a conversation that happens in\nyour mind maybe left and right there\nthere's a point where when you're\ninduced in this like coma\nthis sex drive it's influencing your\nwhole mind and body and once you start\nlike bringing up like a conversation\nbetween like yes and though between the\nact of doing it or not it just seems\nthat like the whole like the feeling the\nwhole feeling inside your body is\ninfluencing your mind and what it's\nthinking and then you start making\nnegative rationalizations about it so\nand that's what gets to me most of time\nit comes down to a point where I start\narguing with it like this side of my\nbrain for you know maybe five or so\nminutes and then it gets to a breaking\npoint where like I just my\nrationalizations just make sense at that\npoint and then the act ensues so I mean\nI I'm hearing something that sounds like\nalmost like a very very physical craving\nyeah absolutely\nthat that's what it sounds to me like I\nmean it you know it sounds like it's not\nactually like your mind it's your body\nyeah the craving is huge yeah what is\nthat what is the craving feel like in\nyour body well initially so first of all\nit gets triggered so once it what if I\nsee some type of suggestive and\nyou know like a spark happens and then\nlike my whole body kind of tenses up and\nthen I feel it like deep inside my spine\nalmost my lower spine I feel it almost\naround my stomach and it feels like this\nwhat's the word you used it was a ball\nof undigested feelings what's the word\nfor that some scar some scone some scar\nyes it feels like I just yeah absolutely\nyeah good\nwell just feel I don't know it's just\nlike it kind of just starts enveloping\nand it's just like it's it has an\ninfluence over my whole body and it's\njust like it's it's something I don't\nlike because I really want to you know\nquit this addiction and I don't like you\nknow surging up this massive energy just\nto you know blow it out 40 minutes later\nand then have no motivation or more\nimportantly energy to do anything for\nthe rest of the day so so I'm hearing\nlike a buildup of energy or sensation is\nthat and then and then you you feel\nspent afterward yeah absolutely I've\nit's yeah I feel like I just I once it's\ndone I feel like I've given it\neverything and then I you know blow off\nthe rest of the day so I can't like my\nbiggest concern is when I do it early in\nthe morning and like at the end of the\nday I don't really see much of a problem\nbut I still see a problem with the porn\naddiction as a whole this is the value\njudgement of like how early in the day I\ndo it okay so Richard when you were and\nsorry if I'm bouncing around a little\nbit you guys are welcome to sort of if\nyou feel like we're moving too fast you\nall are welcome to you know invite us to\nkind of stay with a particular topic I'm\njust gonna kind of run with what I'm\nhearing and and so can I just think for\na second absolutely sure yeah\nso I'm just I'm struck by how not\nmentalness is like I'm struck by like\nthe the words that you guys use do not\nare not words of the mind like you you\nguys use words like damaged or hungry or\neven someone said coma I think did\nsomeone use the word coma yeah yeah yeah\nso so these are these are incredibly\nphysical physical words and and what I'm\nhearing is that that actually your mind\nsort of tries to fight against this\nalmost like tidal wave of like hunger or\ndemand and you can sort of like fight\nthat battle but it's kind of like trying\nto keep the waves from washing on shore\nlike you're like you're like you're like\npushing you're pushing the water back\nlike with your hands and like you're\npushing and you're like no water it's\nlike don't come on to shore don't come\non to shore but there's only like so\nlong you can do that before like you\nknow that wave is just it's it there's a\ncertain there's a certain like finality\nor futility or inevitability to like\nwhat I'm hearing you guys describe is\nthat can I jump in and ask a question\nyeah absolutely everyone else there do\nyou guys feel like your cravings are are\nmore or less re a less frequent when\nyou're out in public or when you're\nactively engaged in something with\npeople yeah for me it's like a more\npassive thing like it's still there it's\nlike being hungry almost oh yeah it\nfeels almost exactly like being hungry\nfor food like it'll be there but when\nyou're focused on something that\nrequires your attention that isn't it\nthat's a necessity it uh sort of forces\nit back with sort of like an equivalent\nforce it's like two tidal waves crashing\nagainst each other in that sort of\nanalogy yeah yeah go ahead sorry I feel\nlike when the that emotion is as strong\nthis is like when I'm really not doing\nanything like when I'm not being\nproductive with anything I'm just like\nsitting there\nand then I end up doing it mmm so Harold\nI thought I saw you or heard you say\nsomething like when you out or when you\nare in public it is easier to deal with\nyeah well actually me when I'm in public\nI probably most of the time I don't have\nany urges at all especially like in open\nspaces like when I'm out for a walk or\nsomething or on campus or something\nI just don't get actually almost any\nurges at all it's really just when I'm\nlike working at home alone or something\nor with a few people or something like\nthat but in public I just don't get them\nat all okay so so so for some people it\nsounds like it's kind of in the back of\nyour mind in public for other people it\nseems like being in public or being some\notherwise engaged is it really does help\nand and I'm hearing that idleness of the\nmind really is is like let's some of\nthose thoughts and feelings kind of come\nout it just opens the gate definitely\nokay what do y'all think about that I\nsee two sides to the coin I don't know\nwhat it is but I see I don't know maybe\nthere's a root cause to our different\nproblems between us okay what do you\nthink that root causes\nlet's hear it Aaron well I've been able\nto so I've been to a bit of therapy and\nstuff good for you man so I've been able\nto yeah thank you I've been able to like\nsort of trace back to where it came from\nI went through a a similar event when I\nwas seven years old was sort of forcibly\nsexually awakened and caused like a sort\nof innocent curiosity to sort of process\nwhat actually happened to me\nand once I exposed myself to the world\nof porn I was way too young to really\nsort of properly handle it and process\nit healthily and so it became like an\nobsession like when I first started out\nI didn't even masturbate I didn't really\nhave those urges at that age but uh once\nsaid um do you what do you remember what\nthe draw was but before you started\nmasturbating it was like I said almost\nlike a curiosity and then it was still\nlike a slight like dopamine kick and I\nguess it also helped ease some sort of\nlike social anxieties that I may have\nhad at that age hmm and ghosts I saw you\nnodding along yeah a lot of it resonated\nwhat resonated with you um what he said\nabout the sort of curiosity and need to\nunderstand and I feel like I also had a\npre-emptive sexual awakening when I was\na child but a lot of the memories are\nsort of blacked out and I've come to a\nlot of realizations about what that\nmeans but I remember on making like\nsexually inappropriate jokes but a very\nyoung age before most people know\nanything about it\nand I didn't really know where that came\nfrom and it feels like my mind is\nconstantly blocking out the source and\nporn is somehow my minds way of trying\nto go back and explore something that I\nsome sort of trauma that hasn't been\nresolved and it feels like when like\nit's filling a void and at tons in my\nlife where I felt wholesome or\nappreciated my urges have completely\ndisappeared like when I had a girlfriend\nI didn't I didn't have any edges at all\nwho who resonates with ghosts like\ndepiction of like is that what's\nhappening to you guys I don't actually\nresonate with that and actually the\ncomplete opposite and by the way before\nI keep talking is my mic okay yeah we're\ngood man\nwe're good squash does a lot better\nsounds a lot better good I actually was\nthe complete opposite because when I\nactually had a girlfriend around I found\nmyself when she wouldn't give me what I\nwant I would turn to porn more and I\nwould actually start to use it as a kind\nof scapegoat to get away from certain\nthings when she was annoying me or when\nshe was upsetting me and I wanted to get\naway from her and just worry about\nmyself and give in to my own selfish\ndesires I would turn to porn and porn\nwas really a safe spot for me in that\nregard but you know the relationship\nended bad and ever since then it's like\nit got wrapped up twelvefold so you know\nnow I'm at a place in my life at 24\nwhere it's like I want to reach out I\nwant to have more relationships and the\nrelationship I've had with porn when it\ncame to having a girlfriend it's like it\ndidn't matter like I still watched it\nand I still went to it you sound you\nsound like you judge yourself a lot for\nthat squash my doctor came I think way\ntoo much my friend I think way too much\nwhat do you think about yourself fur fur\nwhat's that judgment I hear I hear\nalmost self-hatred yes and it does stem\na lot from the incident I had as a kid\nbecause I never wanted anything to deal\nwith it and it never was something that\nI wanted and it kind of happened and\nthere's no turning back you know there's\nno change in the past there's no fixing\nanything or changing anything but\nhonestly I never wanted this you know\nwhen I think about the journey that I've\nbeen on so far I was 11 years old it's\njust it's it's very powerful what what\nwas powerful Richard I completely agree\nI saw\nlet me think there's a lot of power and\nbeing vulnerable to like what life\nthrows at you and I just saw like the\nway that you're dealing with it I see\nsorry can you guys feel my dog yeah a\nlittle bit let me take care of that\nreally quick right after a lot of power\nand being able to you know you know I\ndon't know I'm lost on this dr. Cammie\nthat's oh that's okay Richard so I think\nwhat I'm hearing squash so I thought\nthat was it so what I'm hearing is that\nlike people are affected by what you had\nto say something about squash just\nspeaking your truth which by the way I\nmean you say you've been dealing with\nthe witness for 13 years and it's hard\nit dude it sounds [ __ ] impossible\nlike heart heart is the understatement\nof the year man yeah it's it's one of\nthose things where I tell myself every\nsingle day that it's something I can be\nand honestly just so the stream knows\nlast night was I want to say the first\nnight in a long time that I had enough\nmotivation that it just never even\ncrossed my mind and we're helping the\nsame routine man for the past so long\nbut last night it was one of the first\nnights where I said you know what I'm\nputting myself first I'm gonna put the\nstream first tomorrow I'm gonna not do\nit and I didn't and it felt great but\nyou know I think what was powerful about\nwhat I said dr. kay is that you know\neveryone always has different\nexperiences and everyone's always going\nto experience things differently but the\nthing when it comes to porn addiction\nfor me that I want to tell the world if\nI could it's just that like it's really\nnot worth it in the end it's really not\nbecause it changes your relationships\nthat changes the way you see people but\nI know that will maybe get down to it\nfurther down the line but you know yeah\nthat's that's how I feel and it sounded\nlike Virgil did I did I hear you say\nsomething kind of aligned with what\nsquash was saying I thought I heard you\ncomment yes sir the the thing that it\nreally resonated with me with what\nsquash said was that you know I I didn't\nI didn't want this for myself I don't\nthink any of us here want this for\nourselves we don't want to view the\nworld through this this destructive and\ndamaging lens that just seems to never\ngo away it just it hangs over your head\nlike a cloud constantly and it's\nsomething that I wish I could I wish I\ncould fix it feels unfixable first yeah\nso so this is gonna sound kind of\nbizarre I think you guys can get better\nbut I don't think that this is something\nthat you can fix\nlike like fixing implies that there's\nsomething that I don't know how else to\nput this but I mean I think what you\nneed to be is is healed not fixed like\nyou're not broken like that so though\nI'm reeling to be completely honest guys\nbecause I have never I've worked with\npeople who have had sexual addictions\nbefore I've worked with people who have\nhad porn addictions before but I don't\nknow if they were just you know cuz it's\ndifferent because you're sitting in an\noffice and you're you're talking to\nanother person or there's some degree of\nshame or or what but you guys have\nreally just opened my eyes to first of\nall I've never thought of porn addiction\nis something that afflicts you like we\nthink about like diseases as things that\nhappen to you right like I got the flu\nlike I'm not the flu it's something that\nhappened to me and I I don't even myself\nlike when I think about you know let's\nsay like a marijuana addiction I don't\nthink about a marijuana addiction like\nhappening to someone it's not like\nyou're walking down the street and you\ncontract a marijuana addiction but what\nI'm hearing from you guys is that like\nactually you guys like contracted this\nthat there's a there's a disturbing\namount of commonality with your story\nabout being exposed to sexual images\nlike way before puberty before\nunderstanding what it was and like your\nmind almost having a non sexualized like\nbizarre like fascination with some\nimages or things like that and then\ny'all are kind of like off to the races\nand it sounds like in a lot of cases\nthere's actually like Frank trauma yeah\ndoctor can I ask you a question sure go\nfor it man you know it's one of those\nthings that it's like it was forced on\nyou it was not something that you wanted\nbut my question to you is how much of I\ndon't want to you know it to sound too\nweird but I guess I can just call it\nlike the human element of just trying\nsomething to try it\nhow much of that da truly believe comes\ninto play when it comes to things like\npornography and even going to it for the\nfirst time because even there sometimes\nthere's trauma there sometimes there's\nother things but for the most part\npeople go to it because they're\nfascinated by it they're like oh it's\nthis thing this thing looks so cool\nlet's check it out boy what do you say\nto the people who just had the curiosity\nand just went for it\num so oh so you're saying that that that\nwhat would I say to people who just\nbecame curious about porn there wasn't\nany kind of trauma or anything like that\nand they just went for it and because\nthey went for it they became addicted\nyes my situation was yeah so here's what\nI would say so I think just about every\nkid I would imagine or most kids at some\npoint get curious about pornography and\ngo for it\nlike that's a completely normal\nexperience right are we agreed on that\nand I'm so so remember that a disease or\nwhen I think of kind of problems or\naddictions especially is when something\nwithin you meets the environment in a\nparticular way that is like catastrophic\nright it's it's not just like kids get\nexposed to alcohol and marijuana all the\ntime some people become addicted why is\nthat other people do not become addicted\nwhy is that so there's something about\neither there's a biological\npredisposition or that exposure to porn\nor curiosity about porn happened in a\nparticular circumstance\nthat allowed the addiction to happen\ninstead of just like being a 15 year old\nkid and like finding porn and jerking\noff right which is like a pretty normal\nexperience so something is different I\nstill think that III don't this doesn't\nsound and I I don't mean to say you guys\nare abnormal but this doesn't sound\nnormal\nto me this sounds this sounds like an\naffliction like you guys are using this\nword these words like damaging right you\nguys like something is going on in your\nmind that is not really like even start\nit doesn't even sound start like it\nsounds out sort of sexual it's it's like\nsome kind of weird curiosity where\nthere's some part of your brain which\ndoesn't understand why this thing is so\ncool\nbut like it scratches a niche in your\nneurons and then before you know it\nyou're like scratching that itch over\nand over and over and over and over\nagain this I don't know how how many\nother people will feel this way but it's\nsort of you mentioned isolation\npreviously yeah and it feels like\npornography can kind of in a really\nperverse way sort of not satisfied but I\nguess placate that need for human\nconnection like when you feel really\nalone when I'm around people who I feel\ncare about me the the urge goes away and\nit's not because I'm sexually satisfied\nit's just that I feel whole I guess and\nit's sort of like it's just filling that\nvoid that you're numbing yourself like\nit's a sedative almost at times that's\nwhat I can feel like yeah I'd say very\nvery similar experiences and we both\nfeel very in the same way about it he\nbasically said everything that I wish I\ncould have said yeah in that squash\ntalking yes sir\nand\nwhat what about Virgil's experience\nresonated with you squash can you just\nname it what he said specifically when\nin the beginning when he was talking\nabout how porn addiction kind of just\nyou know it's and I'm listening and I'm\nhearing back what you said at dr. K when\nyou said it's a dopamine itch and you\njust keep scratching and scratching and\nscratching because I never thought of it\nlike that before\nand the way that I view and urge when I\npersonally want to watch porn\nit's that itch you know it's that issue\njust got to scratch it but with what\nVirgil said my point was just I agree\nwith everything of what he was saying\nwhat he was saying about how it makes\nhim feel I feel very similar along those\nlines and in Virgil how does porn make\nyou feel it's just um it's it's kind of\ndifficult to to verbalize for me but it\nfeels isolating it feels like it feels\nlike I I have some sort of itch that I\ncan't scratch like it feels like a like\na physical affliction like like it's a\npart of me and I can't necessarily but\nlike the trouble that I have is trying\nto that part of me that that's been\naffecting me for more than 10 years of\nmy life because I just I just want to\nfeel like normal I don't I don't feel\nnormal right now I know that sounds kind\nof oh no no it's okay guys I can I think\nfor a second yeah\nI think I'm understanding something I\njust need to understand what I'm\nunderstanding yeah so I think I think\nI'm hopeful okay that's I was confusing\nwhat I was feeling for a little bit but\nit was hope okay it's good and here's\nthe reason I'm hopeful so if we think\nabout medicine or mental health when\nwhen there are shared experiences\namongst people that means like\nscientifically like something's going on\nright if you have if you just have like\na one-off event science is gonna have\ntrouble understanding that it's when we\nhave a repeated observation over and\nover and over again that we can begin to\nunderstand something and if we can\nunderstand it I believe that you know\nthat significantly improves our chances\nof improving it or fixing it here's what\nI'm hearing from you guys this is not\nthere's a sense of hole there's a sense\nof warmth there's a sense of isolation\nthere's a sense of something on that\nspectrum which somewhere along the way\nwhen y'all were young something [ __ ]\nthat up it just came in and it [ __ ] it\nup and I'm not quite sure how and and\nnow what it is is you guys have this\nthis hunger the sense of isolation the\nsense of loneliness the sense of not\nbeing understood and then along comes\nporn which is your brains way of like\ntaking that away for a little while\nbird and and so you might imagine\nabsolutely and so you guys have this\nsense that okay and then we get into the\nsituation that y'all are in now where\nlike you can only like fight off hunger\nfor so long right and all of you guys\nare using this strategy of\nlike fighting off hunger which if you\nthink about it that's just not gonna\nwork right you can't fight off like\nhunger needs to be satisfied\nthe thing is though what you guys do\ndoesn't truly satisfy that hunger like\nthe hunger is partially for porn but\nit's like partially for something else\ndoes that make sense\nyeah it's like you're eating shitty food\nand it feels like it's the only food\navailable yeah I never cure hunger but\nyou can eat better food and so I think\nthat if you guys want to be free of this\nand I do believe and this could be a\nlittle bit you know stupid I do believe\nthat people's like mental health can be\nsubstantially like improved I don't\nthink it's a lifelong struggle I just\nkind of choose not to believe that I've\nseen enough stuff in my personal career\nto where I people I think people can\nreally like conquer what we call quote\nunquote mental illness right doesn't\nmean that they don't need to be on\nmedication or that it won't crop up from\ntime to time but I think you can\nbasically live a normal life like that's\nmy target I don't set my target any\nlower that and I think you guys can live\na normal life I think what it comes down\nto is understanding that this thing you\nguys can't fight the hunger you're just\nnot going to be able to so the question\nis how do you satisfy that in the way\nthat is like healthy and good because I\nI don't think that that hunger I don't\nthink your body is stupidly hungry right\nI think in each of y'all's cases\nsomething happened to you that you\nbecame damaged or busted in some way and\nand something within you is just\nstriving to be like whole again that's\nwhat I'm hearing from you all that is\nthat you all want to be whole again yeah\ndesandem oh sorry go for it buddy this\nmight sound wild I don't know if this is\ngonna resonate with anyone but there are\ntimes where I've it feels like you can\nbe so addicted to porn that I've\npreferred porn over sex which might\nsound crazy to some people but it really\ncan\nit feels like it because it's a solo\nactivity there's more I feel like I'm\nstill stuck in my head having sex\nbecause there's another person there and\nI can't get that same feeling of escape\nagree yeah it's almost like another\nelement of control that you have as well\nat least it's Saudis yeah yeah the\nsituation so so not to be indelicate but\nI don't think sex and what y'all are\ndealing with is the same at all they're\nlike completely different phenomenon\nright yeah and just because you not at\nthe end does not mean it's similar at\nall right and and and that's my whole\npoint is that I think we need to like if\nwe want to get better or make you guys\nwhole again\nwe have to like really understand what\nit is and what it isn't and let's take a\nstep back and not judge it and just\nassume that sex is gonna be a\nreplacement for this because that\ndoesn't sound like that's the same thing\nat all right it's not just about\nejaculation\nit's not about arousal it's not just\nabout sexuality but it does get muddled\ntogether with those things yeah when I\nwas doing no five before the Blacktip\nmonth every time I did that the geared I\nwill do push-ups and I was trying to do\n100 pushups a day and I felt like it\nhelped because I was sort of releasing\nenergy it's like I didn't feel like\nfapping was the thing that it was gonna\nbe it's kind of hard to put it in in\nwords but like Bucky transmuted it yeah\nyeah like I the urge wasn't really for\nthe fapping was more like releasing the\nenergy if that makes sense\nyep and I think because I was so\naddicted like the only way I saw of\nreleasing that energy was riffing off\nokay so\nHarold it looked like you wanted started\nnot Harold um Aaron it looked like you\nwanted to say something yeah\nwhen yeah I also in firmly an agreement\nthat it can be healed and it can be done\nlike I guess overcoming this because no\nbut I've done it before yeah I've done\nit before and what it required was sort\nof yeah fulfilling that void that is\nthere that sort of the porn addiction\nkind of just barely emptily feels what I\nfound was very helpful is just having\nthat like being able to be open about it\nand face it head-on\nactually during that time of two years I\ndidn't have I had a girlfriend but I\ndidn't have sex so it wasn't even like\nsex was a replacement for it was just\nbeing appreciated and being in a lot of\nhealthy relationships and also having a\ndharma to also mention that having some\nsort of like purpose that allows you to\npush forward that helps a lot as well\nthanks for sharing dr. Kato for what he\nsaid yeah please man go for it\nI for me own personally I related to\nthat because it really just takes a lot\nof energy to actually fight the urges\nand I realized that last night as I was\nlaying in bed it was like nine o'clock\nand I was playing in Grand Theft Auto\nand I'm sitting there and I'm thinking\nlike I totally can\njust yesterday there's no problem\nthere's no issue like how much porn it's\nnot a big deal but then I kind of\nstopped and I really paused and I said\nto myself like dude you don't want to do\nit there's no reason for you to do it\nbut\nthe amount of energy and the amount of\nstrength it took for me to just simply\nlike not do it it was really interesting\nto me to see it because I've never seen\nthat before in my entire life and for\nthe first time last night when I stopped\nI was just like wow dude like I'm six\nfoot seven and I'm a lot stronger than I\nthink you know it's like I I like to\nthink of myself is so small and I like\nto think of myself there's like so tiny\ndude but it's like I'm six seven like\nI'm a big guy I'm a strong dude I like\nto move I like to release energy and\n[ __ ] but it's like to stop it it just\ntakes a lot man it takes a lot yeah so I\nthink that's that's because the some\nscar so I'm [ __ ] amazed by also\nunderstanding of Sanskrit concepts so\nprops to y'all so I'm just gonna dive\nright in okay and if I leave someone\nbehind just please let us know so I\nthink that's because the some scar that\nforms that is hungry is not six foot\nseven it's like an 11 year old kid yes\nright so Harold I think you said yes\nfirst yeah well actually I said yeah\nbecause I thought it was interesting\nbecause for me it's not really it's hard\nto place the age of that some scar it's\nkind of like this it for me it's such an\nalien thing in my mind that I can't\nreally compare it to any age it's like\nthis thing I don't know it's it's hungry\nthing yeah yeah like a hungry beast kind\nof a thing like a blob I don't know yeah\nso how long has it been with you Harold\nuh well for me I started like around ten\neleven like most of these people uh and\nso at first it wasn't really that bad I\nmean I some some guy told talk to me\nabout porn like in elementary school and\nso I just looked it up and I didn't\nreally get hooked on it then then right\nthen but then\nI'm guessing it's because as I got into\nmiddle school and I I was like having\ntrouble with like finding friends\nespecially like good friends I was I had\nbad I was in this group of friends but I\nI just knew they weren't really you know\ngreat people for me but I I was just\nsort of lost in essence and so I guess I\ngravitated more towards porn like then\nespecially because those friends\nactually talked about it as well with me\nand so they just talked about as like\nthis cool thing and you know it just I\nthink that it helped to solidify my\nattachment to it and then I just started\nit Korea was kind of a gradual thing I\njust I started watching more and more\nbut super slowly cuz like throughout the\nmiddle school years it got worse and\nworse at but it wasn't really as often\nas some people have said again sometimes\nit was three times per day but usually\nwas like once a day I don't know where\nI'm going with this uh know I mean III\nthink it you know Harold so guys by the\nway y'all don't have to make sense okay\njust to be clear so like you're not here\nto make sense that's my job I'm supposed\nto take whatever you guys so don't worry\nabout making sense okay I'm just just\nthe more you guys I think share with\neach other so first of all you guys I\ndon't know if you all like how does it\nfeel to be talking about this by the way\num at first I was very nervous about it\nconsidering like the overall stigma on\nthe topic and it's it's really easy for\npeople to laugh at the issue but you\nknow you're in our position you won't be\nlaughing then but now it just feels very\nrelieving to me\nI agree go for it George\nokay so it feels really really thing\nbecause I've never talked about this\nsubject with anyone else like this is\nthe first time I'm actually talking with\nsomeone about this\nand so like hearing other people talk\nabout it just sharing my story like it\nfeels reliving it feels like unless how\ndo I put it\nI'm less closed off I don't think that's\nthe word like I'm not as constrained as\nI was like I yeah I cannot see that this\nis nothing not something that only\nhappens to me like all I can relate to\nthe to the people in this group and this\npeople probably can relate to me and it\nkind of makes like gives me a sense of\nhappiness because like okay I'm not\nalone within this all right\nabso-fucking-lutely so I I think I mean\nI you know do you guys feel like the\npeople who are on this call understand\nyou yeah\nwhat does that feel good like you're not\na freak yeah so so let me ask you guys\nthis the part of you that's hungry what\nhappens to that part when you're\nunderstood by others goes away it's yes\nright now it's gone completely gone it's\nsmaller so what do y'all think about\nthat it's it's it's just dr. K I've been\ndealing with this for a really long time\nand I'm not a social dude I don't have\nany like Facebook I deleted all my\nsnapchat like I'm on nothing man it's\nlike I work I go to school I have a very\nvery small circle like I have a very\nloving family and it's like I get really\nlonely sometimes and it's just I said\nyou know what I'm gonna try this I'm\ngonna see what this is like\nand it's just this whole experience\nchatting with everyone in the car just\nnot feeling like such a freak it's a\nreally rewarding thing and I'm very\nthankful for that\nyeah so I want you guys to just notice\nthis right cuz I don't think this gets\nbetter through control control matters I\nI think it gets better when whatever\nthat thing within you that is broken and\nalone and sort of like wants to be in\nthe darkness but also like thrives on it\nright like darkness [ __ ] feeds this\nship yes yes and and like you guys you\nguys need the [ __ ] light man and in\nthe amazing thing is that when you put\nlight on it it just goes away it gets we\nmentioned in the past that when\nsomething is kept within like a Sun scar\nit just grows until it eventually\nconsumes you and that's like a really\nrelatable feeling that that's that's\nwhat's happening here guys is that you\nguys have had this thing and just think\nabout how long you guys have been\ncarrying this how long it's been in your\nbasement and sort of like feeding off of\nthat darkness right like we're talking\nlike a decade or more for so it feels\nreally strong and you guys also go for\nit okay um like earlier we were talking\nabout physical feelings like mentally\nand I'm sort of I'm okay with talking\nabout this and I wasn't really that\nanxious but when you join the core it\nwasn't like a thought that hit me it was\nthis physical it felt like that got\nagitated and it was like this wave of\nenergy sort of overwhelming my nervous\nsystem like it was rushing through every\npart of me really intensely and as the\ncalls gone on up so I've been able to\nsit in the experience and my body is\nsort of calming down which is quite a\nrefreshing feeling yeah so okay anybody\nelse want to add anything I think it's\nall great yeah actually it it reminds me\nof a lot of these times where I mean\nI've gone sometimes without porn for a\nlong time like up to like 50 days one\ntime I think and then when you're\nwithout it for a while and then you come\nback to it you get like for me my whole\nbody just starts trembling like when I\nsee just one suggestive image like I\njust started trembling like super\nviolently you know that's kind of the\nsame feeling I got when I joined the\nstream as well it's like this thing is\nlike waking up it's freaky like it was\ndoing exactly yeah man this is some this\nis some demonic possession level [ __ ]\nman I don't know if anyone used the word\nanimalistic impulse but you know I don't\nknow if it's hardwired in our nature I\nremember there was something that\nsomeone told me humans are meant to mate\nhumans are made to survive that's it\nwe're married to mate and feed and then\nwe die and it's a really weird way to\nthink about that and I don't like seeing\nit in that light so the thing with me is\nI don't want to see it as like a monster\nanymore for me it's like I train after I\nmasturbate I don't have the energy to go\nto jujitsu I want to train then I\nhaven't gone to training in like two\nweeks because I've been on a really bad\nbinge so I'm going to go to training I'm\ngonna go to jujitsu and I'm gonna be\nfine then I'm gonna be able to put the\nenergy in different places and not have\nto rely on this crutch that I've been\ndealing with her so long\ncan I get a [ __ ] yeah absolutely man so\nso I okay I got a I just need a second\nto think is that okay guys yeah yeah\nokay all right I'm so I we could talk\nmore there's a lot of stuff we haven't\ncovered right so we haven't really\ntalked about nofap we haven't talked\nabout relationships I think all that\nstuff is gonna be you know super\nimportant to talk about but there's a\npart of me that wants to help y'all and\nI think we've done that already so I\nfeel good about that\nbut I want to help you guys more\nconcretely and so I want to talk to you\nguys about solutions is that okay\nyeah so the first thing is that this is\na physical thing this is not like you\nguys aren't like mentally ill I mean\nsure you I'm sure you meet some criteria\nsomewhere but like I don't I don't think\nof this as a defect in your mind okay\nIII think about I mean there's just this\noverwhelming sense that something\nhappened to you guys when y'all were\nyoung and something kind of got damaged\nand then that is a thing that is not bad\nit's not evil it's just hungry\nit's just unsatisfied and and whatever\nthat thing is that we call it loneliness\ncall it the beast call it a demon I I\ndon't think it's actually an evil thing\nI think it just it just gets you know\nit's gonna eat whatever it can however\nit knows best does that make sense it's\nkind of\nit's kind of like a yeah absolutely it\nwas like the Strega yeah and and so I\nthink much like this trigga you can find\nthe princess underneath right so I think\nthat's that's actually what needs to\nhappen it's a really good analogy\nactually wait what's this trigger people\nwho can explain this trick um but it's\nlike when does when the when a pregnant\nmother dies and the baby is like cursed\nand it comes out and it survives it just\neats the flesh of people and it's like\nthis one's the child pause pause for a\nsecond so this is a fictional thing from\nThe Witcher if you guys have played The\nWitcher if you all assume let's so\nghosts let's just start there right we\ngot to let people know it's not anyway\nso it's like a cursed thing that's just\nperpetually hungry so and if onlys is\nlike dead flesh then it's gonna be evil\nbut it doesn't necessarily have to be\nyeah so it's kind of like a baby that's\nyou know tragic circumstances and all\nthat and then it kind of becomes a demon\nsort of thing but so the first thing is\nthat I think that you know you guys are\njust missing something that is is not I\nmean it's not that y'all are like\nmorally defect it's that something\nhappened to you guys when y'all were\npretty young it sounds like and then\nthere's something within you that's just\nhungry for wholeness for more for beyond\nanything else what I'm sensing you guys\nneed is wholeness y'all just want to be\nlike whole and calm and like chillin in\nthe Sun and not like Hungary in like a\nhalf thing that's like half living in\nthe basement and then you guys are\nfighting this thing right because\nsometimes it comes out of the basement\nand sometimes you guys like you grab\nlike a chair and a whip and you guys\nlike drive it back into the basement and\nthen it's like down there and it's\nmucking around for a while then it\nbursts out again and then you guys are\nin this constant war which you're just\nnot gonna win like that's not gonna be\nhow it works but there are things that\ncalm it down right there are things that\ncause it to be like Morcant\nand and that's actually like talking to\nother people it's like recognizing that\noh there's like a half dozen dudes out\nthere who have like weird stringers in\ntheir basement and and and somehow like\nyou feel like at peace and as long as\nyou the more that we can cultivate that\nsense of wholeness and we'll get to how\nto do that\nand what I'm talking about is wholeness\nI'm talking about warmth I'm talking\nabout connection the less powerful this\nthing is going to become and our\nstrategy here go for it ghost oh sorry\nit sort of feels like the idea Jung's\nidea of like integrating the shadow if\nyou continue to just repress it it will\ngrow into this monster but it's a part\nof you it's like a part of your soul\nthat you're oppressing and assumes that\nyou learn to integrate it into who you\nare sooner you can feel holy yeah I\ncompletely agree so I'm a big fan of\nyoung and that's a big part of like my\ngeneral treatment approach right which\nis that we are just like go said that we\nhave parts of us and then like we have\nto bring those parts together because I\nthink this thing is not evil what it is\nis hurt does that make sense like this\nthing is just a gigantic ball of hurt\nand then what it's done is it's managed\nto find some circuit in your brain which\nmakes it feel a little bit better for a\nlittle while and since that hurt in that\nhunger there it's gonna like keep on\nmaking you fat because like that's the\nonly way it knows how to feel like a\nlittle bit better for a little for a\nlittle while and so the solution here is\nnot to get like really really\ncontrolling I mean we can talk about\nthat in terms of like resisting the urge\nto fat because there may be some value\nto that it's really in figuring out like\nwhat is this hunger inside you and like\nhow can we calm that down how can we\nhelp you feel like loved and whole and\naccepted because the more you guys feel\nthat way and this is the other trend\nthat I'm noticing is that that you know\nwhen you guys start to feel like\npositivity in your life the thing\nweakens so what we want to do is not\nconquer it we want to like make it weak\nwe want to tame it not like destroy it\ndoes that make sense yeah any questions\nabout that general idea like you who\nhere disagrees with what I'm saying and\nsort of thinks like oh no this is like\nwe're completely off\nI agree but um what one thing I sort\nwant to draw attention to I remember you\nsaid something on another stream about\nif someone is like anorexic and they're\ncutting and they have like academic\nproblems you can start to solve one but\nthen the problem will manifest with the\nothers no it feels like there been times\nin my life where I've been able to not\nkick the addiction but I guess keep it\nat bay for long enough to see that I\ncould live a better life without it and\nthat my life is better without it but\nthen it feels like I'm scared of my own\nsuccess and I get drawn back into it\nbecause you default that there's\nconflict and that's how it feels like\nbecause you can't fall further than the\nbottom of the pit yep so I was you you\njumped ahead a little bit but there's\nthere's one thing that I think is gonna\nbe really dangerous guys is that as you\nguys get better this thing is gonna\nstart freaking the [ __ ] out and it's\ngoing to be harder to resist because it\ndoes not want to die and as you put\nlight on to it it's gonna feel afraid\nthat is dying this some weird like\npsycho mumbo-jumbo kind of [ __ ] okay\nso like this is not scientific but like\nthere's something within me that that\ntells me that as you guys actually start\nto get better as we start to sometimes\nheal wounds they don't understand what\nthe [ __ ] is happening like there is some\npart of you that's gonna be primitive\nand it's gonna fight you tooth and nail\nto bring you back to where you were\nbecause the mind prefers what it knows\nto what's good yeah actually when it's\nespecially when it's something that you\nknow you've become so used to and it\nkind of gets part of your routine you\nknow\nyou do the same things every single day\nand you don't even realize it the same\njob the same school the same work same\nwife same girlfriend you know it's it's\nall a circle it's all one big circle\nabsolutely it's about breaking here's\nthe thing you guys have been struggling\nwith this for so long for so many years\nwe're talking a decade or more right for\nmany of y'all and so there's gonna be a\npart of you that says even though your\nlife is shitty right now at least you\ncan survive I know you can survive I've\ndone it for a decade I can do it for\nfive more NBD\nno big deal and there's gonna be a part\nof there's gonna be a time and place\nwhere actually I think you guys are\ngonna need another level of courage to\nactually like risk living a life without\nthis thing because then you don't know\nif you're gonna be able to survive I\nknow it sounds completely crazy and I\nhonest you guys get what I'm saying\nsorry cool so what I mean to say is that\nthere's actually gonna be a time where\nright now you guys want to be free from\nthis right you are gonna have to fight a\nbattle because one day there's gonna be\na thought in your mind where you don't\nwant to be free of it you actually want\nto go back that's gonna be a [ __ ]\nhard battle does that make sense yeah\nI've had literal flashbacks before when\nI've like abstained I've had sudden\nmemories come to me of the process and\nit feels like um like on its dying\nbreath it's desperately trying to pop up\none last fight and it feels like it\nfeels like a battle of forces within you\nand that the whole you is like the body\non which these competing forces is\nacting and you're just sort of watching\na war within yourselves yeah so you guys\nhave to watch out for this okay we're\ngonna I mean this is I do not envy you\nguys so up until this point I really\nhave not thought about this but this is\nthe one moment where I know\nArendt I mean I like I feel sad for your\nsituation because I think this is a\nheart like it's hard to let go and\nthat's what you guys need to learn how\nto do which is we're gonna get there but\nyou have to let go of wanting this thing\nright you have to say to yourself at\nsome point like okay that's a life that\nit's gonna tell you and you guys have we\nhaven't talked too much about\nrationalizations and all that but you\nguys know you remind relies all kinds of\n[ __ ] to you so it's not about convincing\nit that it's wrong because here's the\ncrazy thing it's not wrong that's your\nbuddy being controlled by the some scar\nand it's not wrong that's why it's so\n[ __ ] hard to argue against because\nyou guys are smart and the smarter you\nare the better it's gonna be at coming\nup with reasons to convince you so it's\nnot your self Bethell absolutely so it's\nit's not about convincing it it's not\nabout fighting it it's about letting go\nit's about saying yeah you're right\nthere are a thousand good reasons for me\nto go back to that lifestyle there's\nsecurity there there's safety there I\nget to be in control of the hurt inside\nme and that's what you guys have to give\nup that's what's [ __ ] hard because\nright now you guys have a light switch\nto control the hurt inside you you can\ngo to this thing in the heart inside you\ngets taken care of for a little while in\na shitty way but it gets taken care of\nand what you guys have to choose is a\nlife where you're no longer in control\nof that hurt you got to give up this is\nyour [ __ ] cheat code it's the coping\nmechanism for everything negative within\nyou what would you say if um if you feel\nlike there's immense sort of guilt and\nshame within you from let's say age four\nor five onwards and it feels like\nthere's this really dominant force in\nyou that feels that you deserve this\npain and you deserve to be in the pit\nhow would you say um yeah how would you\ngo about dealing with that\nI mean I think that's the crux right\nthat's the damage that's the thing so I\nthink you've got to figure out you know\nwhy you started believing yourself why\nyou started believing that about\nyourself and then as long as you believe\nthat so that's what you have to let go\nof so that that - and sorry if I'm\nspeaking abstractly because it's I mean\nyou weren't saying something vague but I\njust don't know if other people are\ngonna understand this\nI feel like hopefully you will but so\nthere's something very possessive like\nyou want to hang on to that right\nthere's something very jealous about\nyour shame you're like you you deserve\nthis this is yours to bear it's mine\nit's my precious right and you want to\nhang on to it even though it makes you\nfeel bad you want to hang on to it you\ngotta let go and this is the really\ndangerous thing when it comes to like\nletting go of negative feelings within\nyou like do you guys understand that\nwhen you all have that negative feeling\nwith with you know since the age of five\nyou've had this thing and then now you\nguys have walls that keep it at bay\nwhich is the porn addiction you guys\nbuild up walls to protect yourselves you\nguys are are y'all are [ __ ] good\npeople right like I look at you guys and\nI like each and every one of you I'm\nsurprised by how normal you are right\nlike you guys are normal people there's\nnothing wrong with you that means a lot\ncoming from you dr. K and I know that's\na giant I know what abnormal looks like\nI'm an expert at the abnormal and y'all\nare [ __ ] normal you guys are just\nnormal people that had something [ __ ]\nbad happen to you and then your brain is\nwired a certain way and then you use\nthese you build up these walls around\nall of these negative feelings and so\nnow you guys need immense courage\nbecause taking those walls down is\n[ __ ] it's hard because ghosts you\nhave to let\nthat shame run rampant through your mind\nyou have to open the door to that shame\nbecause right now you keep it walled off\nbecause you can control it is the fuss\nthough not just technology just breaking\nthe [ __ ] walls down and letting it\nflood you that's what you've got to do\nlike sit in the experience absolutely\nyeah I mean if you can observe it\nfantastic I think you're gonna get\n[ __ ] overwhelmed for a little while\nand then you'll you got to come up for\nair you know it's gonna wash over you so\nI think at some point there's got to be\nsome letting go and in that kind of\nstuff but I'm also like a really\npractical guy like I can tell you guys\nthis weird [ __ ] abstract stuff\nthere's a there's a voice in the back of\nmy mind that's like what the [ __ ] are\nthese guys gonna do with that like I can\nI can weave this beautiful symbolism and\nthen you know then you guys like log off\nthe call and then you know that what\nlet's talk concrete okay so we go into\nmore so like what it is to let go\ngood so first of all my approach to it\nhas always been rationalization and it's\nalways been an uphill battle what does\nit mean to let go like is it just to\nlike be in the experience of it or um\nI'm not quite sure yes you mean by\nletting yeah great so I'm gonna tell you\nguys so now we get to the concrete part\ngreat great question Richard the first\nthing is that this is something of your\nbody it is not necessarily of your mind\nfirst thing you guys got to do is\nsomething physical so who here goes to a\nyoga class who has access to yoga you\nguys do yoga all of you guys need to go\nto yoga or Tai Chi either ones fine okay\nand if you want to understand what\nletting go is Richard do yoga then\nyou'll understand yoga okay can I can I\nthrow in another example and see if it\nmight work\nso my I'm fairly blessed to have a sauna\ninside my house and I use it very\nregularly does it have the same kind of\neffects as yoga or is there something\nabout the the experience of yoga when\nyou're using your body complex to you\nknow do yoga stuff yoga superior one is\nmaking more receptive to endorphins\nso saunas fantastic I think if you have\naccess to a sauna\nfirst of all jealous much and then\nsecondly it is different okay so there's\noverwhelming scientific research that\nmind-body exercise practices are\nsuperior to other exercise practices\nokay so like there are lots of\nrandomized control trials that compare\nyoga to exercise so the control you guys\nknow what I like how a randomized\ncontrol trial works okay just real quick\nso what we do is we take we're studying\na condition let's say like depression or\nanxiety and then so let's just say\nanxiety and what we do is we take a\nhundred people and we put 50 of them in\na control group and so the control group\nis sometimes like an exercise class and\n50 of them in a yoga class and then we\nmeasure their anxiety like after eight\nweeks and we see like what's going on so\nyoga and Tai Chi have been shown to be\nsuperior to exercise and it's probably\nbecause they have a relatively mental\ncomponent so yoga and Tai Chi are both\nmind-body practices they're like both\nmental and physical practices they're\nnot just physical practices and for a\nlot of people who exercise they over\ntime incorporate a mental component but\nyoga and Tai Chi are like designed to be\nmind-body practices whereas a lot of\npeople will discover a mental component\nto their physical exercise but it's not\nlike baked-in like running is a good\nexample where people who are runners\nwill describe this kind of meditative\nlike state when they run for long\nperiods of time yeah but but I mean but\nthat's all\nI mean it's Yoga is like designed to\nsort of make you into a particular\nmind-body space which I think is gonna\nhelp you can I think question about yoga\nyeah I remember I saw you\nyou you did an exercise with someone\nwhere you had them buzz like a bee ah\nand it really fascinated me and it made\nme think about the connection between\nthe body and emotion and I was reading\nabout this idea that trauma is like\nphysically stored in the body I have\nthat Yoga is like opening a series of\nchambers throughout the body and it sort\nof allows the emotions to flow through\nbecause like you know I don't know like\ngo on a like a tirade here but like if\nyour nervous system gets overwhelmed\nlike your body floods with the emotion\nand they can just store it for years and\nit can make you like physiologically it\nincreases like your morbidity and\neverything and I was reading that Yoga\npaired with therapy is better than\neither one of them alone because Yoga\nallows the emotions to flow through your\nbody so they can more easily be so\nopened up and it was saying that memory\ntrauma and the body are all linked in\nthat way yeah so I believe most of that\nalthough most of that is not scientific\nright so so that there's like a lot of\npseudoscience around physical stuff and\ntrauma in my experience what I think is\nmuch more scientifically valid is simply\nthat men experience emotions much more\nphysically than mentally so if you talk\nto men like when you guys are talking\nabout like what are the words that we\nuse to describe this thing\nphysically it's like pop no we know we\ndon't use deceitful we haven't deceitful\nhas not been mentioned at all Mike point\nentirely what is the actual language\nthat you guys used to describe this\nhunger absolutely right you guys don't\nthink that's a [ __ ] emotion that's an\nemotion right but you guys don't\nunderstand what emotion it is but you\neveryone understands like one person's\nlike hungry and that everyone else is\nlike yeah man like that's an emotion\nright and and so with it I mean well the\nwhole point is that this is physical\nlike we've been [ __ ] talking about\ntrauma you guys have been traumatized\nwhen you're all like ten and you guys\ntalk about hunger now like this is my\npoint is that that it's not the children\ncry it's just like literally like this\nis how we're like we're socialized to\nexperience emotion this way so we are\ngoing to access this so I agree ghost\nthat Yoga is very helpful for trauma I\nagree that trauma has I mean I think\nanything in our mind has some kind of\nphysical manifestation or correlation\nand a lot of this stuff about you know\nusing like physical like knots and and\nenergy and chakras like I buy into a lot\nof that stuff but it's not actually\nscientific okay so we just got to be a\nlittle bit careful there so it doesn't\nmean that it doesn't help it doesn't\nmean that it isn't therapeutic and I'm\nadvocating yoga to you guys I think you\nguys must do yoga because you have to\nget in touch with your body because this\nis a physical thing for y'all and in\nyoga yoga is going to connect your\nphysical sensations with emotions\nand it's also just you know does good\nthings for your immune system and things\nlike that\nsecond thing yeah and so the goal of\nyoga is to help you guys be in your body\nand Richard when you say how do you let\ngo I mean so that's not something we can\ntalk about it more but my voice isn't\ngonna last very long but I think it's\nsomething that's merely something that\nyou have to you have to learn how to do\nright like so if I took like a\ntwo-year-old kid and I was teaching that\nkid how to let go like how do I teach\nthat kid mm-hmm so it's a good question\nI think as you do yoga you'll learn that\nlike getting into the right pose is not\nabout trying harder it's actually about\nletting go would you say that Yoga is\nfor the body what meditation is for the\nmind like it's almost this sort of\nmeditative process well yeah so\ntechnically what Yoga is is a\npremeditation state for it's like it's\nto prepare your body for meditation and\nDarren's the the when whenever you guys\nare doing yoga so I'm gonna teach you\nguys just a little bit about yoga\nbecause there seems to be some curiosity\nokay so the goal of yoga is to bring the\nattention of your mind to the present so\nwe're gonna do we need Richard for this\nbecause Richard has to okay we're gonna\nI'm gonna teach you guys exactly what\nyoga's so the goal of yoga is to bring\nthe attention of your mind to the\npresent and so the goal of doing all\nlike turning yourself into a human\npretzel is not to increase your\nflexibility it's to adopt a particular\nphysical like posture that you can't\nthink about anything else okay so we're\ngonna do this right now you guys ready\nhold your arms up yeah and tell me\nwhat's happening in your mind it's okay\nokay so I want you guys to just notice\nokay so arms up\nso you guys are having thoughts but over\ntime what's gonna happen the physical\ndemands of your body arms up no pushing\nto talk okay so just keep your arms up\nso as your arms get tired just keep them\nup there then it's gonna start demanding\nyour attention you guys feel that your\narms are like signaling to you now\nthey're like hey hey we're up here and\nthen the the further the longer we go\nthe more your attention is going to be\nstuck in your arms does that make sense\nthe arms are demanding the attention\ndemanding your attention demanding your\nattention notice what's happening in\nyour mind now close your eyes feel hold\nit good now continue to feel you may\nnotice thoughts arise you may notice\nperspiration okay now hold it hold it\nhold it and now let go you feel that\nRichard absolutely eyes closed\noh yeah that is [ __ ] letting go do\nyou understand now just feel that's\nletting go how do you all feel right now\nnow you can open your eyes and use\npush-to-talk peaceful like a weights\nbeen lifted incredible\nyeah relieved that jeez that physical\nthat physical exercise was such a\npowerful experience that the that my\nmind trying to like my arms trying to\nbring the attention to my mind was a it\nstarted to kind of build and then I was\nable to like\nmaintain that connection and then once I\nlet go it was just like okay hi I've\naccepted that it's time to just so\nRichard what is why that's letting go\nright like I can't [ __ ] explain it\nbut just got it you know you gotta let\ngo\nit's like field ring answering all the\nthe demands of your arms that are saying\nlike dude put me down please yes and\nyou're really answering right okay so\nyou guys alright I got um I got addicted\nto running in the past and it feels like\nI now understand where that feeling came\nfrom like I was letting go that is a\ngreat focus on when you focus on the\nenergy demand of your body and when you\nreally experience the sensation of\nrunning without you know suffering when\nyou just feel the sort of pain but\nneutrally it's this really peaceful\nstate yes dr. kay about the connection\nbetween yoga and why yoga was so\ndifferent and the way that I was able to\nput all of my attention up on my arms\nreminded me of my jujitsu training but\nthat was special I didn't realize how\nsimple it was when you take out a lot of\nthe complicated it's like you said\nyou're not trying to turn your body into\na pretzel you're trying to use your mind\nto get to a better place and I I think\nyo that's amazing\nokay beautiful I'm glad you guys like\nthat so sorry\nyeah I just have a personal concern\nabout yoga because okay my back a few\nyears ago and I was just worrying if\nthey're they're like more simple poses\nthat I can do or simple things like like\nwhat we just stated like raising our\narms up or something like that that can\nbenefit me because I have limb ability\nabsolutely so first of all if you have\nif you've broken your back you know\ntalk to your doctor about doing yoga or\nTai Chi\nsometimes people handle Tai Chi a little\nbit better than yoga if they've had a\nback injury but Yoga is actually really\ngood for back injuries so if you go to a\nyoga class and you guys have like a\nmedical condition you should let the\ninstructors know and also talk to your\ndoctor about it and just say hey and\nthen you know listen to your body so\ndon't like it's not about a pissing\ncontest it's not about who can hold\ntheir arms up the longest you guys\nunderstand that if you're comparing\nyourself to someone else in the room\nyour mind is not where it should be\nwhich is on you so don't do anything in\nyoga that is painful Yoga is not\nsupposed to be painful so if your back\nis signaling to you hey I don't like\nthis kind of stuff that's completely\nfine there are all kinds of postures\nthat you can do from a seated position\nthere are all kinds of postures that you\ncan do [ __ ] straight laying down you\ncan do all kinds of stuff with a back\ninjury and yoga so definitely you can\nalso you know have you seen a physical\ntherapist in recovery after your back\nafter you broke your back yeah I went\nthrough physical therapy for about six\nmonths it helped a lot and now I don't I\ndon't really need anymore\nyeah so if you don't need it you're\nprobably kind of back to normal so it's\ngood to know if you you know to be\ncareful about yoga but the other thing\nthat you can do is depending on how long\nago that was or if you have a\nrelationship with your physical\ntherapist you can also talk to them and\nsay hey I'm interested in doing a yoga\nclass what do you think are there are\nsome kinds of strengthening exercises\nthat I need to do or there's some things\nthat I need to avoid and and really like\nthis is exactly what you know physical\ntherapists and doctors are for great\npoint okay so coming back to this now\nearlier I was kind of talking about you\nknow the sequence of events before you\nkind of you know when you kind of feel\ncertain physical things or mental things\nyou try to rationalize and all that kind\nof stuff so the other thing about this\npractice is where was your mind\nit was mostly on my arms like I've had\nexperience experiences with meditating\nbefore I'd probably weren't the most\nread transformative experiences um while\nI was meditating a few years ago I felt\nlike it was it's very easy for me to\njust focus all the attention on my arms\ngood for right so go for me my mind was\nmy mind was blank and just experiencing\nthe sensation was I don't know if that\nwas in my mind or that was my body but\nthat's that's all I was doing I was just\nexperiencing this sensation so that's\nconsciousness right so it's\nconsciousness without mental activity so\nthoughts are the mind desires thoughts\nthat's all mine you guys were hopefully\nconscious so you were present and\nexperiencing without thought does that\nmake sense yeah yeah and when you guys\nstruggle against the the porn addiction\nis that within the mind or outside of\nthe mind that's it's outside of the mind\nis the physical urge that we have to do\nit okay and then what about the battle\nwhere does the battle take place in the\nmind yeah absolutely right so the other\nthing that I want you guys to try to do\nis is learn something called urge\nsurfing so as you feel that physical\nsensation notice the the the connection\nbetween the physical sensation and what\nit creates in your mind and then you\nguys fight in the mind sometimes you win\nsometimes you lose so be it if you can\nstep out of your mind and sit with the\nphysical sensation just see what happens\nand understand that that desire to turn\nto porn is going to be like it's like an\nurge that's going to come and you can\nactually surf on top of it it's not\nfighting against it it's not trying to\nkeep the waves at bay it's just riding\nit out surf I wrote that I read that\nmonks can hold their hand on burning hot\nobjects for longer\njust by focusing on the sensation of the\nbarn is that like a sort of similar\nfeeling that you're able to sort of\nquell the immense feeling just by\nfocusing in on it yeah so what once you\nexperience so don't hold your hand on\nburning things just there but what what\nmonks are able to do is to sit with a\nsensation without judgment right so like\nit feels bad to hold your arm up but you\ncan sit with that feeling of badness for\na longer period of time as long as\nyou're sitting with it purely does that\nmake sense\nlike with intention and focus you can\nsit with a negative sensation for a\ngreater amount of time than you\notherwise would so it's like decoupling\nthe emotional component from just the\nactual sensation it's up you beautiful\nit's decoupling everything not just the\nemotional component decoupling is the\npoint decoupling is via our detachment\nit's separating yourself from the thing\nokay now we're getting into advanced\nconcepts I want to like close off a\ncouple things to leave you guys you know\nwith like some kind of plan so yoga\nsecond thing is understand that when you\nguys do these practices you're trained\ntraining your mind to do what you tell\nit to which is to focus on what you\nchoose to do this is cool because once\nyou train this skill you can tell your\nmind hey I want you to go and think\nabout that and then your mind is gonna\nbe like okay because right now that's\nnot what it does right now\nyour mind is like oh porn and then\nyou're like no no come over here and\nthen your mind is like no no no let's go\nto porn and you're like no no come over\nhere no no porn so like train yourself\nto focus your mind where you want it to\ngo that is a skill you can level that\n[ __ ] up and this is how you do it right\nyou do this [ __ ] every single day not\nnecessarily that one but if you guys\nlike that one you can do that one now we\nget to one more yoga practice which I'm\ngoing to teach you guys I'm going to\nteach you guys a bunt up okay so number\none do any of you guys have a history of\na hernia\nokay if you have a history of a\nherniation - if this is unpleasant or is\npainful in any way or anything like that\nany of you guys have a history of the\nbase chakra thing yes that's exactly\nwhat it is so any of you guys have a\nhistory of like improper valves in\nsomewhere in your urinary tract or\nanything like that okay\nso rule number one if this is causes\nsome kind of pain or unpleasantness or\nanything like that just stop okay I'm\ngonna teach you guys something called\nAbunda which is a lock so bunda means\nlock like LOC k so what I want you guys\nto do you guys know where the taint is\nyeah okay\nso the taint is the area it's it's your\nperineum it's the area between your\nscrotum in your anus okay\nso I want you guys to try doing\nsomething I know this is gonna sound\nkind of weird but you guys know you can\ncontract that yeah so like you know\nthere's a muscle that you can do that\nyou can use to like lift your penis\nright to load the Kegel thing yes like\nthe Kegel thing focus boys and girls so\nyou know there's there's you guys know\nsorry just flex that muscle for a second\nyou guys know what I'm talking about\nflex it so you can raise the peanut and\nnow where as you flex it you should feel\na tightness in the perineum with me yeah\nyeah does anyone not have a [ __ ] clue\nwhat I'm talking about\nokay so now close your eyes and then I\nwant you to tighten one two three relax\ntighten one two three\nrelax tighten one two three relax\nhold on a second hello hello yeah they\ncan tighten the perineum but it's gonna\nbe different for them okay fine okay\nokay so so if you're a woman you can do\nthis too so this is the other way you\ncan find this thing is it's also the\nsame muscle that you do that you use to\nstop the flow of your urine midstream so\nthat make sense already badly can I go\nyeah yeah go go piss okay\nso but you guys you guys get the\nsensation that I'm talking about so just\nokay let's like just so tighten again\none two three relax and do two more\nrounds good okay fantastic\nall right so yoga class learn to\nconcentrate your attention right do this\nthis is called mula bandha mula is your\nbase chakra and what you're kind of\ndoing like so you can do this for let's\nsay like between one and start off with\nlike just doing five rounds because it's\nlike kind of hard right does that mean\nit's like difficult to do so you can\nwork your way up to doing like you know\nrounds that are maybe five seconds ten\nseconds for a total of like three\nminutes and you want to do this at the\nend of like a meditation practice or end\nof yoga class or something like that so\nif you guys go to a yoga class at the\nvery end that are gonna have you do\nsomething called shavasan which is\ncorpse pose so they're just gonna ask\nyou to lie down on the floor on your\nback and relax as you do shavasan you\ncan do mula bandha\nfor like a minute or two two minutes\nthree minutes is fine okay if you start\nto feel bad or it hurts or anything like\nthat don't do it last thing is that you\nguys were talking about idleness and so\nidleness is gonna bring this out so the\nother thing that you all have to do is\nfigure out how are you guys gonna like\nreduce the idleness\nin your life right like so what do y'all\nwant to do about that the way that I see\nit dr. K is I view it as internal volume\nis when I would get an urge to\nmasturbate or to go to porn I would get\na very strong feeling of just you need\nto do this you need to do this you need\nto do this and it kind of goes into what\nyou were saying a little bit earlier\nabout trying to surf and ride that urge\nand ride it away and go the thing that I\nwanted to ask you specifically was what\ndo you do when it gets to a point where\nyou feel like you know maybe medication\nwould be something that would be\nbeneficial for me maybe I cannot turn\ndown my internal volume yes so I think\nit's completely reasonable for you guys\nto get evaluated by a doctor or mental\nhealth professional for this problem\nthere are some medications that can help\nwith this they don't work great but\nespecially if you guys have some kind of\ndepression or anxiety or things like\nthat that are contributing to it because\nremember that\nso conquering this thing is not it's\nlike it's about probabilities right it's\nabout strengthening your ability to\nreduce its effect on you and that that\nbattle is fought like five percent at a\ntime so if you guys start going to yoga\nclass then that's gonna be like five\npercent if you start meeting with other\npeople and hanging out like that's gonna\nbe five percent and then you're gonna\nbuild up like five percent over time so\nI do think that if the urges are too\nstrong getting a professional evaluation\nis a great idea and the other thing is\nthat you know it's you're not gonna fix\nthis overnight so treat yourself with\ncompassion and forgiveness for like not\nbeing able to fix yourself\nI don't know dr. kay I had a quick\nquestion on that yeah so um I'm uh I'm\nin the circumstance where I recently\nbroke my computer right now I'm using my\nlaptop and I've significantly reduced my\nvideo game time and when my urges occur\nthey don't occur when I'm playing the\nvideo game so now that my computer's is\nnot functioning right now I do have a\nI'm in a state of I have a lot more\nidleness\nyou know just throughout the day so is\nthat more like do I just need to fill my\nday with more things outside of the\nhouse or and yeah yeah that's exactly\nwhat I'm saying guys it's like you guys\nneed to think about this right so\nunderstand that your forward progress is\ngoing to be influenced by your\nenvironment so like the two things that\nwe still need to talk about is idleness\nand secondly connection because when you\nguys are isolated things get worse and\ntalking about this I mean you guys\nrealize which we've been doing for two\nhours we can do this for two [ __ ]\nhours I had no idea right plumbs was\nlike that's crazy and and so you guys\nhave to structure time with other people\nand you have to structure time away from\nidleness because you're not gonna be\nable to fix this as long as your idle we\nheard it from squash earlier about you\nknow going to jiu-jitsu class and like\nfinding motivation and stuff like that\nso I don't know what exactly it looks\nlike but you guys have to figure out you\nknow what you want to do the other thing\nis y'all can come hang out on discord if\nyou guys want to you know figure out\nlike like if you guys want to meet and\njust check in with each other once a\nweek I don't think that's a bad idea so\nat some point you know I'm in the\nprocess of training coaches and maybe\nthe coaches can help you guys out a\nlittle bit we're just not there yet in\nterms of their training but I think you\nguys should get together because like\ny'all's camaraderie with each other is\nlike important right and you guys get a\nlot out of that so at the end of the day\nthere's all this deep damaged dark\nwhatever inside you but like yoga\nclasses mula bandha thinking about\nidleness and then companionship right\nnot necessarily like romantic or\nanything but just like other people like\nit's a multiplayer game you guys got a\nparty up so if you guys wanted that's\nwhat this discord is for so you know you\nguys can hop on discord but I I just\nthink that each of y'all has to think\nconcretely about what you're gonna do to\nreduce your idleness and it's not corner\ngo just getting out of house just think\nabout like one of the things when you\nthink about yourself three years from\nnow what's something that you would like\nto be different about your life you know\nwhether it's being in shape whether it's\nlearning a different language whether\nit's having a job whether it's being\nback in school or you know just think\nabout this like I don't I I think\nsometimes like this is gonna sound\nreally silly but you guys realize you\ncreate your life yeah absolutely\nabsolutely right like so so you can you\ncan actually like try to do something\ntomorrow in the next day in the next day\nand a year from now you will be a\ndifferent person and your life will be\ndifferent so think about what that is\nand start with like one thing don't\nstart it don't make it a wish list\nyou guys aren't magic genies just think\nlike take like one thing right like what\nis something that you want to be\ndifferent about your life what is\nsomething that requires time go for it\num something really like so hopeful it\nfeels like um when I was still like so I\njust turned 18 and it feels like being\nlike an adult now and having these\nfreedoms feels like maybe this time I\ncan actually so break the addiction for\ngood because I can go out and actively\ndo things rather than being considered\nlike a child so if I can actually create\nmy own life I think I can kick it yeah\nI'm sorry Harold\num just bouncing off word he said I\nturned 18 like a few months ago as well\nand I thought the exact same thing like\nfinally\nI'm in more control I can use that\nbetter so [ __ ] lazy yeah right on man\nI think the the problem that I have is\nthat you know like like for me\npersonally I'm financially well-off and\nI I'm in a relationship with someone so\nthose those things aren't necessarily\nsomething that is grading at me but the\nI think the core of the problem for me\nis that I just don't have a sense of\npurpose and I just feel kind of stuck in\nlife so when when I try to integrate\nthese these positive behaviors like you\nknow going outside something as simple\nas going outside for a walk or\nmeditating or something like that it's\nhard for me to stick with those things\nsorry for me to even integrate those\nthings in general even though I want to\ndo that you know yes I think that's\nsomething else and I struggle with a lot\nso Virgil that's Virgil right yes sir\nyeah so Virgil I I completely sympathize\nwith you man unfortunately I don't think\nwe have time to dig into that now\nbecause we're about that time for the\nday but I think you know that is a\ncommon problem for like everyone on our\ndiscord and everyone in our audience and\nit's central to the work that we do at\nhealthy gamer videogame sort\nsorry sorry button is it in terms of\nlike does it stem from a way are the way\nthat our brain processes video games and\nhow changes or is it are you asking me\nno I'm asking dr. K actually and so so\nwhat's the question\nyou said that like this is a problem\nwith you know it is an obstacle rather\nthat everyone is kind of suffering from\nfrom this discord is it because I know\nthat a lot of the discord comes from a\nvideo game audience yeah I guess I was\ntrying to hint at the idea is that is\nthat where it's stemming from video\ngames yeah\nthe process is like I'm having trouble\ncreating things I'm reading avenues yes\nand no so I mean I think that's I mean\nthere that's a lot of what I talk about\non other streams I I think that many\npeople who are directionless find in the\nsame way that for you guys the porn\naddiction you know how it like feeds you\na little bit but doesn't satisfy it does\nthe trick but it doesn't actually\nsatisfy what's missing in your life so I\nthink a lot of people who feel\ndirectionless get some degree of\nsatisfaction from the video game which\nis really not what they're looking for\nbut it's like close enough and it's\neasily accessible right because games do\nchallenge us they're like hard they're\nchallenging they give us a sense of\naccomplishment you know we feel like you\nknow when you're lay if you're playing\nlike a competitive game like you're\ngonna feel really amazing after like a\nreally hard game that you win and so\nit's it's hard for your brain when you\nhave such an easily accessible trigger\nfor some of those positive feelings it\ncan be really hard to invest all of this\ntime into like building your life\nbecause you don't know what that's gonna\nbring I have two questions yeah um so\nthe first one like earlier you were\nsaying when you were talking about the\nodds of hitting you and your mind\nbouncing around do you think that voters\nare more like predisposed to like\nfalling into that trap being like the\nwind element and like yes and no so I\nthink I think vatta's are gonna bounce\naround more but I don't think that\nvatta's like you know I think everyone\nis gonna have urges so and you guys are\nby the way a wide variety of different\nAyurvedic doshas but interesting\nquestion so vodkas are gonna have more\nfluctuations within their mind but I\nthink everyone is going to have the\nurges so vodkas may experience the urges\nmore quickly and more suddenly whereas\nother doshas are gonna like have kind of\na slow burn of an urge that starts to\nbuild up in the morning and then kind of\ncreeps up and then kind of overwhelms\nyou other\npeople are gonna be kind of like medium\nburn and vodkas gonna be like very\ndynamic in terms of when you experience\nthe urge and how hard it is to you know\nhow long the urge is gonna last\nso I'd say vodkas will have high\nfrequency of urges and low duration of\nurges that makes sense they're not gonna\nlast long since what they'll hit\nrandomly and more often okay someone's\nreally doing their homework\nokay this is unrelated I just want to\nlike quickly ask this um do you have any\nthoughts on like I think it's called\nBromwich Oreo in relation to NOFA okay\nso we haven't even talked about no fat\nso Bromwich Aria is why don't you start\nwith ghosts why don't you tell us what\nbromwich idea is I have like a really\nbasic understanding sure from my it\nseems like it's um this idea of like\ntransmuting sexual energy I like the\nidea of energy like climbing up your\nchakras to be more conscious and like\nlike okay it's about the way you conduct\nyourself\nI'm sure godly way so let's talk about\nwhat bromwich audio so brahmacari is\nfrequently translated as celibacy which\nis not really what it is\nso brahmacarya means to dwell in Brahman\nand Brahman is sort of the infinite or\ncosmic consciousness so in the east they\nbelieve that the basic unit of reality\nis like this cosmic consciousness and\nthat our individual consciousness is\nlike a drop out of this ocean and that\nwe kind of get that bit of consciousness\ngets wrapped around with a mind in a\nbody and that's what makes up a person\nand so Brahma chharia is the practice of\ndwelling in Brahman so to have your mind\nor consciousness be focused on the\ncosmic consciousness and not focused\nanywhere else\nso technically brahmacari is translated\nas celibacy so monks for example will\nengage in Brahma cheerio which means\nthat they usually don't have sex\ntechnically though technically\nbrahmacarya does not mean being celibate\nit\nmeans not being horny yeah right so it's\nto have your mind dwell in like whatever\nthe infinite is I you know it's getting\nhokey so if you guys want to understand\nwhat Ramachari is like if you want to\nunderstand what the infinite is I think\nyou guys saw just a tiny tiny amount of\nit like when you did the arm practice\nand then you relax there's just a moment\nwhere you're just like your mind is kind\nof off it you're just kind of like\nchilling like you're in just the\nstraight chillin mode and when you get\ncloser and closer to Brahman like you're\nin that straight chillin mode all the\ntime and when you're when you're\nenlightened that's like what your mind\nis doing all the time it's just straight\nchillin like all the time so nothing\nbothers you and like everything's kind\nof gel and fun did you survive it yeah\nokay\nso anyway we haven't had a chance to\ntalk about nofap or relationships but\nI'm gonna have to stop cuz also I just\ncan't keep going so I just want to offer\nhuh okay so closing thoughts guys go for\nthis was one of the coolest experiences\nI think I've had in 2020 starting it off\nwith Kobe Bryant passing away and it's\njust like this has really set me on such\na really good path and this is giving\nyou such a feeling of empowerment and\nI'm honored and I'm blessed the fact\nthat I got to be here so thank you guys\nthank you all and and can may I say\nsomething yeah so we went over a lot of\na lot of things\nrelating the porn addiction how\ndifficult the process of kicking it will\nbe for us maybe some more difficult than\nothers but I would like us to reconvene\nmaybe like once a week and just talk\nabout how things are going for each of\nus because I think one of the reasons\nwhy we're been benefitting from this so\nmuch is because we don't have a person\nto turn to in our personal lives to to\ntalk about this so I think this this\ntalk was more important that then it may\nhave seemed yeah this experience this\nexperience has been incredible the whole\nsession I thought it went really well it\nwas incredible to hear everyone's unique\ntake on this and and it kind of you know\nwidened my understanding of like what it\nis to be dealing with this and like that\nprobably the best thing my best takeaway\nI'm gonna be watching the vaad to you\nknow kind of you know look over it again\nbut probably the highlight of it was\njust to like hear dr. K's voices just\nbeing in like a total blissful state and\njust saying I have hope for you guys\nthere's there's something you know\nthere's something that it's just a\nsimple obstacle it's gonna be difficult\nto take on but it just comes with you\nknow setting that intention and you know\nsticking to it so I'm really excited for\nit I think I'm speaking on behalf of\neveryone that you know this this might\nbe the shift that everyone hears that\nwas looking for and yeah I'm just super\nexcited so this has been awesome yeah\nI'm just like this at it again like also\nI think I speak for everyone when I say\nthat like we all really respect you dr.\nK and thanks for the AoE healing and I\nhope you get some healing soon so you\ndon't feel as though\nyeah thank you so let me ask you guys\nthough like do you have faith do you\nhave hope for each other forget about\nyourself for a second do you hope for\nthe other people in here yeah just think\nabout that for a second man it's not\njust me\nyou guys have hope for each other just\nthink about that every single person in\nthis call has hope for you wild there's\nseven random strangers from the internet\nthat have hope after listening to you\ntalk about everything that you've\nstruggled with they have hope that you\ncan get better if you don't believe in\nyourself you can believe in the people\nthat believe in you\nabsolutely I'm glad my camera's off so\nyou guys can't see my tears that's\nwholesome yeah right and so just think\nabout what you had to show the other\npeople on this call to convince every\none of them I mean you don't even try to\nconvince them they just they've listened\nto the words that have come out of your\nmouth they've watched your face in some\ncases they've listened to the tone of\nyour voice they've listened to what\nyou've said they've listened to your\nstruggles and they are all concluding\nthat they have hope for you that is\n[ __ ] amazing\n[Music]\nalrighty anybody else want to share some\nclosing thoughts are we I just want to\nthank you dr. kay and everyone in the\ncall for sharing the experiences and\nlike talking about this subject because\nas I said never really talked about this\nand it's been really helpful like\nhearing your stories and just relating\nto them so yeah it like thank you and I\nhope you get better and thank you\neveryone need a call I just want to\nacknowledge this is completely off topic\nI just want to not acknowledge that the\nchat is saying I look like a guy called\nburger I don't know if that's how you\nsay his name and also talked from\nSantorini okay anybody else want to say\ngoodbye\nare we good I don't want to pressure\nanyone thank you so much all right guys\nthank you all for coming on this you\nknow\nFebruary 14th strong work guys and and\nonce again just huge props to the you\nknow the cojones to show up and talking\na bunch a sensitive topic because it's\nit's not easy and yeah good luck guys\nyou take care of make it I'm gonna make\nit"
