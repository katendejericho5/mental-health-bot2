    "transcript": "but I think the main thing here is that\nthe work is not just what we do together\nit's what you do in your mind after we\ntalk\nthere we go hello you got a haircut yeah\nyou like it looks good man clean\nI'll make I have to make it so bright\nfor you to see me see it's blowing out\nokay because we could go like this or\nsomething all right\nyou I want you to see my body language\nreally well you know this is this better\nthan the previous angle yeah doesn't\nreally matter to you just the straight\nchest no previous dreams I mean I I like\nboth of them\nokay I think I actually like the other\none a little bit more just because the\nmicrophone isn't in the way of your face\nbut don't worry about it let's just I\ncan move it yeah okay because how you\nbeen man amazing really good and I think\nit's pretty much thanks to you I think\neverything started working out as soon\nas we started talking it's not a\ncoincidence just everything in my life\nis just working all the time um feel\nvery confident uh a bunch of girls\nstarted liking me all of a sudden uh-huh\nyeah didn't I didn't I guess I'm\ndifferent somehow\nyes but doing a little better with\ntrading which I've always been good at\nbut now I'm actually really doing well\nbut the markets also being are crazy\nokay not necessarily better with like\nbusiness deals cuz of everything\neverything else that's about the same\nmaybe actually when I'm more sad I do\nthose better because I don't get excited\nit's important not to show any emotion\nif I get show that I'm getting excited\nor not or upset in a business\ntransaction it seems good to pokerface\nit okay right and I\nI got worse I think from being happier\nthat's the only thing in my life that\ngot worse so what do you mean by happier\nI wake up and I don't want to kill\nmyself\nthanks to you pretty service yeah yeah I\nmean that's a plus I I don't I don't\nknow so I I appreciate that you know you\nfeel I'm somewhat responsible for this\nI'm grateful for that I think is I tell\nmost people you know we spend\nwe've spent one hour a week together\nover the last what is it two months like\non average like we've spent like a total\nof six hours together over a two-month\nperiod right yeah so I I just don't\nthink that like as a scientist I don't\nthink that six hours invested in one\nwhat do you think has been your hand in\nthis I mean I've definitely done stuff\nbut you see you have you being there to\nguide me in the right direction even if\nyou just talk to me for five minutes I\ncould end up dwelling in thinking about\nit for one thing you say I could think\nabout for a hundred hours right for the\nwhole every waking hour of the week I\ncould think about it okay um so I got 16\nwaking hours a day 78 plus forty two\nhundred twelve hours right 112 hours of\ntherapy happening from one thing you say\nI take it through the with me through\nwhole week kind of thing yeah but that's\nthe key thing so that I all except in a\nmoment I mean I'll agree with that but I\nthink the main thing here is that the\nwork is not just what we do together\nit's what you do in your mind after we\ntalk that's where the real money is\nright that's where and this is what I've\nseen reckful like and I've worked with a\nlot of people is like some people take\nwhat we do together and they implement\nit and they think about it and they\nreflect on it in between our sessions\nand those are the people that get\ndramatically better so I want to commend\nyou while I'm getting dramatically\nbetter yeah so I mean but like if you\nthink about where\nthe grind happen it's like I may give\nyou the dps rotation but then you're the\none who's practicing it out yeah I'm\nreally good I'm really good at doing the\nmax DPS once I have the revision yeah\nyou're and so I think I think you should\ngive yourself a pat on the back man why\ndo i why do you think it's important for\nme to not necessarily deflect your\nappreciation but try to add some color\nto it or context you one you want me to\nfeel like I'm doing well working on\nmyself I think it's more than that so\nit's not just that I want you to feel\nthat way it's that I want you to really\nunderstand that I do believe that you\nare instrumental in changing your life\nlike I don't think it's an external\nforce that can create the kind of change\nthat you're talking about I just don't\nbelieve that about people like it can it\ncan be an influence absolutely it can be\na playbook absolutely I mean it's a\nmatter of semantics it's an influence\nsure but sure that your input without\nwhat's an example here so\nin my own head thinking about what is\nthe correct path of action to solve a\ncertain problem I have mm-hmm and I'm\ngoing between 1020 options maybe okay\nand every day as a struggle deciding\nwhich one and then I pick one and I see\nhow it goes if it goes well sometimes\nI'm like maybe that was just random that\nit went well try it again and it's kind\nof like this game of uh what do they\ncall the method where you just try\nthings and see if they work out brute\nforce no yeah but no trial and error\nJohn they're just a trial and error of\ntwenty options on how to deal with a\nmental problem and then when you give me\ntwo options like I was saying previous\nstream of the one before it makes it so\nmuch easier I'm just seeing the lines\nright and I'm just like oh I'll take\nthis one yeah\nif you you cut out like the eighteen bad\noptions for me and I'm just picking and\neverything is working great man I'm\nhappy to hear and that's whatever you\nwant to call it influence or whatever\nbut it was a key thing that changed me\ncompletely everything in my life's\nbetter okay well awesome man I'm I'm\nglad I was able to influence you or I'm\nglad you found our time helpful yeah\nkeep suggesting yeah\ncan we talk for a second about like\nwhat's going well and and maybe why you\nthink it's going well our friend\nokay I won't talk about her too much\nconstrained to be better not to ok she's\nlike super highly successful person\nwhich I\nfind very attractive like we missed the\nboat chat our chances our chances are\nover that's I could still day you on the\nside you know I think but you made this\nstatement that women are finding you\nlike more attractive now yeah it's true\nit happened all of a sudden how does\nthat repeat there's a more confident and\nthey like confident is whatever right\nthat's part of it absolutely why does\nthey keep auto adjusting it's triggering\nme stupid camera do it I want everything\nmanual hold on\nlisten to me camera I need to see the\nother side sorry the quality got worse\nokay that was weird\nI'm I'm obsessive about this kind of\nstuff I'm sorry I like photography [ __ ]\nI don't want to deal with it right now\nit's a really bad time and it keeps auto\nadjusting miss don't you agree okay okay\nso just it's fine so so reckful I agree\nthat you know there's the whole\nconfidence thing okay sorry I'm trying\nto focus it's just really choice but it\nbrights it lights up the whole screen\nit's very distracting good okay go ahead\nI just think you're ascending into\nheaven like every like 30 seconds but so\nI think that there's another piece of it\nwhich is your perception right your\nperception of how attractive what you\nperceive so I would I wouldn't be\nsurprised I should say that your person\nyou know you say Oh women find me like\nattractive because I'm confident now and\nI'm feeling better but like it's very\npossible that they find you attractive\nas well during your low times but that\nmaybe you're not able to see that what\ndo you think about that no well they\nmight but then if they do I ruin it when\nI'm because when I'm during my low times\nI'm very needy and I'll just like huh a\ngirl will like me it'll be obvious they\nlike me but then I'll spam her a wall of\ntext okay which I actually feel like I\nneed to do he's like no need I respond\nat that moment because I feel like I'm\ngonna explode in my brain I don't need\nto hang out I just need like a someone\nto talk to me okay\nyou don't talk to me and I've previously\ndated a lot of like gamer girls who are\nthe terrible responding the worst ever\nget I realized this was every gamer girl\nI talk to now they're all better\nresponds I'm so happy to not be dating a\ngamer girl no they're really bad at\nresponding is they're always playing\nsomething and they're never gonna\nrespond so I'd always liked white text\nlike [ __ ] actually 50 times I'm like\nI'm like dude please I'm losing my mind\nlike I need to talk Simon\nhello like you please it just sounds so\ndesperate and bad and even if they liked\nme originally then they don't I know I\ndon't sir like I need that right now\nyeah yeah so so I mean I just want to\nclarify so it sounds like people still\nyou know like you it's it sounds like\nsome of the feelings that you have\ntranslated into behaviors which kind of\npushes people away when you're not\nfeeling well\nsome of the feelings I have translate\ninto behaviors which push people away\nyes mm-hmm okay so if you're feeling if\nyou're feeling well right now is that\nlike emotionally well or like more\nholistically well holistically well I\nfeel like everything in my life is\ncoming together and it actually feels\nlike a cheat codes on it just feels like\neverything's working every time it feels\ntoo easy everything's working all\nanything I do just works and then before\neverything was really hard because a\nyear ago my mom and I were talking about\ndoing a suicide pact and both dying and\nnow like everyone's happy\nI'm happy my mom is happier now\nI think she's happier cuz I'm happy a\nchain reaction you guys sound close\nsounds like close emotionally but we\ndon't talk all the time hmmm yeah so\nreckful is there something in particular\nthat you'd like to talk about today no\nokay then let me offer like one or two\nthings so I'd like to help us understand\na little bit about how you're doing\nbetter and if there are certain emotions\nthat you feel that sometimes change your\nbehaviors and tend to drive people away\nis there some way that we can help you\nso if your overall like feeling well\nsort of like spiritually there gonna be\ndays where you know every day you'd be\nhappier that awesome I'm using it as a\nI'm using a guidance waking up I really\nlike that guy Harris\nyeah he's [ __ ] awesome he's got like\nhim yeah I like Samaras okay so I just\nwant to help us understand like if\nyou're doing well right now and your\nemotions cuz your emotions are gonna\nfluctuate over time right you're gonna\nhave something's gonna happen and then\nlike your neurons I think will be good\nall the time dr. kay already talking so\nso when when that happens how can we\nsort of buffer against those periods of\ntime because I think the issue now for\nyou reckful down that you're on an\nupward trajectory is like if stocks\ngoing down soon dude this is the peak\nwe're scared that's your thing this\nisn't the peak no no no buddy this is\nthe beginning of the elevator this is\nthe beginning of the the elevation oh\nwe're in an upward trend we're just\ngetting started\nare you sure my happiness is\ngot hired from here yes no way you're\njust starting to live life man wait I\ncould get happier than this sort of yeah\neverything's perfect right now\ndamn that's great if I really can well I\nmean I don't know about happier because\nthat sort of quantifies it but what I'm\nsaying is that like you're living like\nyou're living like a finding it I like\nquantifying everything is any numbers\nguy you notice I mean yeah so so this is\nwhat and I I don't think actually I need\nto stop doing that I need to just let's\nstart living like a cuz I don't when you\nthink it sucks I realized I was I was at\na club and I realized I'd never enjoyed\na club in my life and I'm gonna [ __ ]\nmeditate in the club dude like with my\neyes open and I'm just gonna like enjoy\nthis experience\nwith no thoughts and then I loved it\nthere was that people were dancing it\nlike moving their bodies and the lights\nwere nice and then I actually danced you\nknow I was like damn I could see why\npeople like this but I've always been\nthinking too much to enjoy it yes yes\nreckful you're getting it man this is\njust the start\nthis isn't me like being paranoid and\ndon't shatter this thing this is saying\nthat you are on a particular trajectory\nand there are going to be waves that hit\nyou from side to side what I want to\nhelp you do is figure out how can you\nbuffer those waves because the waves are\ngonna calm down on their own there's\ngonna be like a storm that happens and\nthen the storm will pass the main issue\nnow is that how do we keep you stable\nenough to when that storm hits to not\nforget that this is still the upward\ntrajectory that we will you want to go\nbecause if you can just get through the\nstorm you're gonna get back to this\nplace if I treat my happiness like a\nstalk maybe I'll be able to handle\nbecause I don't have an emotions\nattached to investing when things go up\nlike it when things go down no the thing\nis everyone else I know they're always\nfreaking out I'm just like yeah that's\nfine you know\nmaybe I could do the analogy with my\nemotions where I know the emotions are\ngonna come and go happiness and sadness\nand overall though I'm fine yes\nwhatever company I [ __ ] invest in is\nfine Byron's fine - exactly so that is\nsomething in sanskrit called Vairagya or\ndetachment d'etat yeah it's fine\nright like things are gonna happen and\nit's not like a good thing right like\nyou can lose money and you can\nexperience while you're talking ability\nyou can try - you're gonna have days\nwhere you're gonna feel bad and you're\ngonna have days where you lose money\nthose are all negative outcomes me\nlooking honey you sure no I don't know\nyeah of course I have to have it and and\nand so what you need to do is just\nremember that that that's just you know\nit's just part of what happens like so\nnegative emotions are gonna be a part of\nlife and they don't necessarily signal\nthat your life is falling apart or is\ngoing amazing\nhis bazaars the sounds they have\nemotions the signal my life is falling\napart of going amazing I can see that\nbecause today when I woke up with after\nreally bad dreams even though\neverything's perfect in my life I was\nactually feeling negative for a second\nI felt like 30 minutes and I was like\nwait everything's absolutely perfect but\nI don't feel good that's just weird\nbut then I I as the day progressed and I\nstopped feeling similar to the dreams\nwhere I'm dying then I thought I was\nokay I wish I remembered my dreams\nbetter to tell you but I'm always dying\nwhat was dying in a dream I wake up you\nhave recurrent dreams of you dying yeah\ndie alot are they different deaths\nusually falling bhavas have dreams of\nfalling do you actually die or you just\nhit the bottom and then you wake I never\nactually see myself die I just wake up\nyeah that's normal\nyeah for people of your Ayurvedic\nConstitution yeah for people of my\nConstitution was I mean Ayurvedic\nConstitution if we not talk about Vata\nyet I wish I could remember the terms\nbetter if it was all English I remember\nit better I am so so petha is one of the\nthree like elements so all human beings\nhave\nthree kinds of elements in them and some\npeople have higher levels of you know a\nparticular element so Vata is\nrepresented by wind and ether and so if\nother people like the word ether\nwhat does ether mean ether is the space\nbetween things so it's kind of like the\nbackdrop so it's also void is a space\nbetween things yeah it's like the space\nwithin which other stuff exists like so\nspace is not like methane right so but\nin which things exist is the ether yeah\nthat's how generally speaking\ntraditionally those can I see what let\nme see what Google says so like you\nexist within a space but that space is\nlike it's a thing but it's not a thing\nright you were smelling colorless\nvolatile liquids in a sauna for the\nclear sky the upper regions of air\nbeyond the clouds okay yeah I see so\nether ether is a cool word I have some\neath etherium cerium is it based on\nether I certainly think so yeah cuz it's\nbased on empty space let's do it I think\nI'm doing really well on it okay rekkles\nfocus my god all right I'm sorry\nso people like Vata or like the wind so\nthey tend to get interested in things\nquickly they also tend to get bored with\nthings quickly they tend to be like\nkites but tell me this no I mean yeah I\nget bored of things really quickly yeah\nyep so you're about that I'm Vata too so\nthe other features of Ava's or that\ntheir eyes are bigger than their son is\na type person yeah personality yeah\nincludes personnel also includes\nphysical things also includes mental\ncharacteristics\nwe're both vodka and how many are there\ntotal just three dart framing\nthree there are three types of\npersonalities one's about that there are\nthree elements and then people have\ndifferent levels of each element and\nthat sort of determines your personality\ntypes so some people are like equal\nparts of two of\nbut you and I are both of fatah your\nsecondary element to spit up by the way\nso that's fire B water yeah your Vata\nPitta i'm iron what any mire in water so\nif it does fire and water no no your\nfirst organism area and a secondary yep\nyour primary element is wind your\nsecondary element is fire we my\nprimaries wind yes I'm so okay I'm wind\nabsolutely and then secondaries water is\nfire fire is cool I like this wait wait\ndid you say fire fire and water yeah so\neach each this is why it is one this is\nwhat's confessing shot yeah so that so\npeople have all three doshas and then\neach Dora is composed of two elements\nokay but let me just tell you a little\nbit about vodka okay so people who have\nhigh levels of otha also are like a TD\ntheir mind tends to wander very once\nagain bata is the wind one yes the wind\none just imagine me yeah imagine a mind\nlike the wind blowing really hard in one\ndirection Oh what is my theory I'm doing\nright now blowing in this direction oh\nlet me fix my camera over here let me do\nthis over here over here over here over\nhere over here right so other features\nof Vata their eyes are bigger than their\nstomachs so I would guess that you get\nvery very hungry but then it doesn't\ntake a whole lot of food to actually\nlike fill you up yes I ordered way too\nmuch food and I've realized that so\nstuff so that's another Vata\ncharacteristic vodkas tend to be what we\ncall people with fast metabolism so you\ncan eat a lot and you don't won't really\ngain weight easily sometimes I've gained\nweight a few times but yeah mostly well\nsometimes I eat like a crazy person my\nshame is seeing it yeah so so highly\nfluctuate a petit SAR also consistent\nwith vodka and taking all this\ninformation yeah and so I actually want\nto hear okay I want to hear about the\nother ones okay so bit des is like fire\nis fire and water soap it does tend to\nbe driven focused argumentative my\ntextbook question for pizzas or do you\nhave a low intolerance for the idiot\nsee of others hmm when they do and bit\ndoes have well like they're just\nintolerant of the idiocy of others well\nsorry I I I wonder if I could change\ntheir view with just words because the\nway I think about it is the people who\nare really dumb just got very bad\norangey and we're born that way I really\nbelieve it or either we're born that way\nor their environment sucked and then I\njust thought their fault yeah but\nsometimes I'll see a really stupid\nperson and someone I'm with will be like\nlike we have to deal with this person\nsomeone with us like oh my god this is\nso [ __ ] annoying I hate like like\nthis person's [ __ ] sucks I hate them\nthat person is more bitter than you are\nyeah and then I'll say you should feel\nbad for that person dude he gets so\nunlucky but the brain does not work yes\nso but but so that's that's like do you\nsee how their classes of people who are\ntolerant of that in classes of people\nyeah I'm not sure if I'm on board yet\nbecause I feel like I could slowly\nconvince a bit sure that's lutely yeah\nyeah so I'm not talking about what do\nyou become a button no he wouldn't come\nbecome a Vata in the same way that a bit\nthat can keep you focused by like\nfocusing you so they can exert their\ninfluence on you and cause you to change\nin the moment but you still have a\nnatural predisposition to be like the\nwind and they have a natural\npredisposition to be more argumented I\ndo noticed these natural predispositions\nand people yeah thing but I mean it\ncould be attributed to it could be if\nit's changeable you don't believe in it\nbeing changeable no no it is changeable\nso so we have an option going from one\nto the you don't believe in it being\nchanged believe in it changing within\nthe spectrum of still being fire water\nbut not fire water becoming wind okay so\nthis is important to understand okay so\neach person has a door shot a door Shai\nis a level of Vata Pitta and kapha\nyou're you have an inherent door show\nwhich is called a prakruti and then your\ndoor shuts there levels can change based\non your environment and diet and other\nthings so it's kind of like like\nthings yeah so like let's say your Vata\nis naturally attend your bitthe is not\nrly a six in your Gotha is naturally a\nfor when you get my firewater one up to\na nine if I change some things\nabsolutely and you can also always be\nhigher not necessarily so over the line\nI could become higher than the wind I\ncould stop being the wind uh you could\nin theory have a dominant other door\nsiya yes in theory I just it sounds kind\nof academic but generally speaking\nyou're always gonna be the wind right\nlike so you're gonna have and so this is\nby the way borne out in genetics so\npeople have done genetic analyses of\npeople who are like vadas fit doesn't\nguffaws and it found that they actually\nshare like groups of genes it's specific\nplaces yes you and I yeah okay so if you\nlooked at our genetic analysis like for\nexample we're gonna share a remarkable\nnumber of gene alleles release because\nit's not really jeans but alleles deals\nwhat's an allele allele is a particular\nvariant of a gene at a gene list four\nletters no Leal is like so so like hair\ncolor is an allele at the hair color and\nwhen you're in certain learn about\ndominant recessive is an allele like\nbrown is an allele and yes yes exactly\nright so if you had double recessive you\nactually passes on right so so a gene is\nactually like one location within the\ngenome that governs a particular thing\nso like we have a hair color gene and\nthen some people will have a particular\nallele at that gene other people have a\ndifferent allele at that gene and so\nwhat people have people have done\nanalysis genomic analysis on Ayurveda\nyeah I really want you to say hi to my\nfriend sorry I'm windy I got ideas\ndragon table say how did dr. K come here\nokay this is the lead designer of Evelyn\nand my teammate for 10 years and Wow\nokay most important hey man hello how\nare you nice to meet you\nnice to meet you how much does he talk\nabout me you\ntalk about you a lot he talks to you\nabout you a fair amount I've heard a lot\nabout Talib Wow okay we had it for a\nlong time yeah yeah he's over there here\nhas it has development on Neverland\ngoing it's going great we're very happy\nwith how are things progressing you know\nI want to talk to like alright like\nstreams yeah like streams for you to\ntalk to him right now talk to another\ntime okay how could you\nsorry I'm really happy he's here\nvisiting I like um been my friend years\nwe still together actually more than 10\nyears\nyeah no it's 20 20 MLG was 2009 oh okay\nmaybe 10 okay sorry\nso reckful look I'm gonna have to get\ngoing in about ten minutes just because\nI okay I'm sorry I have another\nappointment but um so I just want to\nkind of so first of all I want to say\nawesome that you're feeling better I'm\nreally glad you're feeling better I'm\nglad that you felt like I was\ninstrumental or influential in your\nchange it's been awesome to be a part of\nyour journey I want to still talk a\nlittle bit about and I'm happy to help\nyou out you know after we talked today\non stream and stuff like that if you\nwant to continue talking and things but\nI just want you to know that like so be\ncareful because I want right now it\nseems like your feelings and your\ncurrent situation in life are very\nclosely tied they're entangled and and\nthat's it makes sense like as you start\nto feel better as you become more\nconfident you know the world becomes a\nrosier place what I would really like to\nhelp you do is is first of all\nunderstand that you're gonna have days\nof like negative emotion where something\ncould happen interpersonally something\ncould happen at everland you could just\nwake up on the wrong side of the bed\nlike it could be all kinds of stuff that\ncould happen and then in those moments\nyour neurons may go back to like oh my\ngod like that was all an illusion like\nit doesn't feel like that's the feeling\nI have so I'll tell you yeah like every\ntime I get sad again I think that that's\nthe reality is that the base reality is\nsadness and that I was just streaming\nexactly what you said my instinct is as\nsoon as I feel sad for a moment when I\nwoke up today after the death dreams I\nwas like oh this is this is what it is\nthis is what I am I'm this person the\nsad [ __ ] who wants to die this\nis me and then I slowly got out of it\ntoday though living life and being\naround my friends but I keep waking up\nin that reality trying to not yeah\nreally so I think you did awesome\nmeditating at the club I want you to\nmeditate yeah in in the same way when\nyou're feeling in that sadness right and\nsee if you can that's not the real you\nbut that's\nalso not the fake you the other crazy\nthing is this you is not the real you\nreckful the happy the happy you is\nactually just as false [ __ ] okay there's\nthere's someone it's the person\nunderneath all that stuff there's\nsomeone who's not independent of the\nemotions they're independent promotions\nthere's a consciousness there's me yeah\nand I think that's the person that you\nactually found at the club right because\nthat wasn't about emotions it was like\nI'm starting to believe in this [ __ ]\nabout note when you don't [ __ ] think\nand you just are conscious there's a lot\nto experience it's just like when you're\ndescribing the strawberry taste I don't\ncan't say it in words what it tastes\nlike unless I was really good at\ndescribing it but I can can't say it's\nabout the wait what did you where's the\nword the word for knowing what yah yah\nyah yah yah yah that's so cool I need to\nI need to just live in the experiences\nmore than less than sorts I've been\nholding me back\nI keep getting in loops of thoughts that\nare bad and thoughts really hold me back\nso rattled\nyes and now you need to be careful\nbecause you need to detach from the\nfeeling good as well you don't want to\nbuild it because this is this is\ndangerous because what you're doing is\nyou're building this castle around your\nlife right now which is reckful feeling\ngood and this is real and that was false\nand then like if you build this castle\naround yourself this is still shaky\nground\nyou're right usually someone wouldn't\nwant to hear this because they're in a\nhappy state so they don't want to be\ntold to settle down but I know you're\nright like yes and in the thing is\nhappiness is actually underneath all of\nthis bliss Anand is actually happiness\nas an emotion but underneath that is\ntranquility in bliss and peace and I\nthink you found that at the club right\nbecause at the club you had thoughts you\nhad emotions you had this prior\nexperience which which was dictated by\nyour thinking and once you get\nunderneath thinking there's just this\nkind of like chill sort of purse\nand even below excitement I want you to\nfind the same person just get really\ngood at finding the person underneath\nunderneath the sadness underneath the\nhappiness underneath it all there's just\nthe real something there there's Matsui\nI've never seen I've never felt in touch\nwith that just like you were saying I\ndon't have a self-worth last time\nyeah I'm attached to the emotions I'm if\nI'm happy I love that from jad oh this\nis who I am I'm the sad person but I'm\nnot I haven't experienced what it's like\nto just be alive exactly so the the the\nunfortunate thing reckful is if you\nattach yourself to the high points that\nattachment is gonna stick is your mind\nfluctuates back to the low you got it\nmake sense one of the hardest things\nthat I have to teach people when I'm\nteaching them how to meditate is to be\ndetached so everyone comes in and says I\nwant you to teach me out of meditate\nbecause I don't want to feel anxious I\ndon't want to feel depressed I don't\nwant to feel sad I don't want to feel\nall these negative things I don't want\nto feel shame the hard part is teaching\nthem to detach from the positive because\nthen you're detaching from the entire\nphenomenon hmm I'm trying right now good\nI can see that\nI just want to become a\nkomm unattached to the emotions\nfeel cool ok so I'm very attached for\nthe emotions so close your eyes and once\nagain worried ok I'll Express first that\nI'm a little worried about the timing if\nyou go really soon can I get it in my\nhead how soon the four minutes yeah five\nminutes okay a little stressful but I'll\ntry to detach from that emotion too good\nexcellent now you're learning so the\nfirst step of detachment reckful is\nacknowledgement of what you feel now you\nfeel the pressure right the pressure\ncreates thoughts\nit creates expectations it creates like\nconcerns good so now close your eyes\nfind the moment where inhalation becomes\nexhalation\nyou\nI love you dr. K good so feel that\nemotion right so you feel that\ntranquility that peace where did that\nthought come from good I think I think\nwe're getting there good right so feel\nthat now return find the moment where\ninhalation becomes exhalation and now\nreckful oh no we're running out of time\noh my goodness if you found it yet look\nat that mm-hmm look at that right cuz\nearlier yours it stuck oh my god how\nmuch long do we have how long do we have\nnow how do you feel right now what\nemotions do you feel this feeling of not\nthinking very much does it feel good\nyeah yeah does it feel good I'm trying\nto good as an emotion may be beautiful\nright so it feels like peaceful but it's\nlike not it's not an on an emotional on\nyour character sheet there's a like\nthere's a there's a place for status\neffects and those are temporary things\nand emotions that you feel are under the\nstatus affected box but what you were\nexperiencing right now doesn't go in\nthat box does that make sense character\nI'm just playing the character doesn't\nmatter if the status effect is sad or\nhappy at the moment or nervous or\nwhatever\nI am the character you're just something\nunderneath and it's just like it's just\nyou words are not used to describe it\nright I get it I actually get it the\nstatus effect thing it was good analogy\nI'm happy that was an emotion though no\nno no no so now we come to so I think\nwhat you are now so this is there's a\nword for this anand bliss so this isn't\nan emotion it's like kind of this weird\nthing that would the describes that's\nlike not quite an emotion it's sort of\nlike a stability yeah actually yes\nyes right so this is a glimpse of\nNirvana see I like it\ngood strong work man I'm so happy for\nyou\nthat's quick so the other thing other\nthing reckful is that you know you talk\nabout how good I am if you've been\n[ __ ] meditating every day every day\nthat's that's good that's why you feel\nthis way I was listening navall and he\nsays he meditates for an hour every\nsingle day and he says it changes his\nperception of time which and now I\nactually believe so then it feels like\nyou have more hours anyway even though\nyou spend an hour doing it yep I'm gonna\ntry to get to an hour a day slowly\n[ __ ] I'm only at ten minutes right\nnow a day yeah that's fine so remember\nthat ten minutes can be way longer than\nten minutes man this is it I get it good\nokay so now like I said this isn't the\npeak just the beginning buddy\nnow just crazy Park to me though I feel\nlike I'm peaking everything tells me\nthat I'm peaking right now nope just my\npast experiences when this has happened\nwhere everything's been perfect in my\nlife it was a peak but it doesn't\ndictate this one it doesn't mean that\nthis time this time I could go higher I\nsee that you're starting to rise in an\narea that is not you may have peaked in\nsome part of your life like there's like\nyour cuz your life has ups and downs\nright perfect my popularity and like\ntwitch stuff you can peek you can peek\nall you want to in regular life but\nright now you just started levelling up\na whole new skill you\nunlocked a prestige class and so in a\nsense like a presidency leveling up\nserenity dude yeah there's a level about\nwords it's like you've like just\nunlocked the advanced class so in a\nsense sure you peaked because you have\nto like max out your base class so it\nkind of feels that way but you're\nactually just getting started\nmm-hmm gotcha\nand so just keep at it buddy and uh when\nwill I see you again just message me\nlet's set up a time for like next week\nokay I do want to say on stream though\nis just so they know dr.
