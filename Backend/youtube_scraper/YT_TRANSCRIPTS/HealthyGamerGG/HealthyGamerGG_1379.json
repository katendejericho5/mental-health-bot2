    "transcript": "will I get a legit evaluation or will\nthey just think I'm depressed you cut\nout gaming and then you just replace it\nwith other crap people think that is a\nparticular thing that makes them bored\nno your mind isn't a pro boredom State\nok this is a great question I see you\nkeep flaming therapy is there a\nsituation which therapy is the right\nmove what alternatives do you recommend\nways to give back to the community so\nyou know you're welcome to get involved\nwith us so we're we're you know as we're\ntraining coaches and stuff what's\nhappening in the brain with you all of a\nsudden stop enjoying games and actually\nprefer doing more productive things is\nit still about dopamine levels do you\nfind spirituality conflicts with\nscientific research not at all so let me\nbe clear about a couple of things what I\nsay I'm on lightened know what at what\nage it hasn't happened yet\nI have a question if I try to get\nprofessional help for video game\naddiction will I get a legit evaluation\nor will they just think I'm depressed I\nreally think I'm an emotional I have an\nemotional dependency on games and I use\nthem to evade bad feelings to the point\nthat I can't get that get things I need\nto get done okay so will you get a legit\nevaluation or will they just think I'm\ndepressed so you will get a legit\nevaluation and they will probably think\nthat you are depressed so the first\nthing doctor says is that very few\nmental health professionals understand\nvideo game addiction or how video games\naffect psychology or neuroscience and\nthat's not their fault right like when\nwe were training like in my training I\ngot over the course of four years in\nabout twelve to fifteen thousand hours\nof training\nI got a grand total of zero hours of\ntraining on video game addiction and\nthat is at all places at the Harvard\nMedical School and so the first thing\nyou guys need to understand is if you're\ngonna seek a mental health evaluation\nit's not their fault that they don't\nunderstand video games it's not that no\none has been trained to ask are you\naddicted to video games so that's the\nwork that I'm trying to do with the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association so I'm\nputting together a continuing medical\neducation like a class for psychiatrists\nto educate them about video game\naddiction to try to get them I teach at\nvarious places to try to raise awareness\nso that people do like start asking\nabout it\nbut I think if you want to get proper\nhelp I think it is your responsibility\nto share this with them if you share\nthis sentence with them you walk in and\nyou say hey you talk to them they're\ngonna ask you so what are you what's\nbringing you in they're gonna I'll ask\nthat question they're like what's\nbringing you in today they're gonna ask\nthis open-ended question about why\nyou're coming to see them and if you say\nI really think I have an emotional\ndependency on video games and I use them\nto evade bad feelings to the point that\nI can't get things I need to get done\nthat's all you need that's the perfect\nanswer they should be able to handle\nthat because remember that what\npsychiatrists and psychologists and\ntherapists are good at is like not\nnecessarily understanding the nuances of\na particular addiction like if you go\nsee\nme for example so I'm an addiction\npsychiatrist and I work with people who\nhave like cocaine addictions but like I\ndon't know the ins and outs of like\nusing cocaine and what it does I'm not\nan expert I've never even tried cocaine\nso I don't I don't know really and know\nanything about it but I can absolutely\nhelp them with their emotional\ndependency on it and how they use it to\nevade bad feelings to the point that I\ncan't get things done because that's not\nspecific to video games right that's\njust normal like that that's what we\ndeal with like a therapist should be\nable to help you explore your emotional\ndependency on video games should be able\nto help you explore what it is that\nyou're using your video games to like\nemotionally avoid because we do that for\nall kinds of stuff like we watch TV we\nengage in unhealthy relationships we use\nsubstances of abuse all of that stuff\nhappens all the time and psychiatrists\nshould be able to handle that so I don't\nthink you're gonna get like a super\nknowledgeable person about video game\naddiction and what it does to you but I\nthink that's something that you have to\nkind of educate them about and that you\nguys can kind of like work on together\nand I think you can get help I think you\njust can't if they say like I think\nyou're depressed and and then I think\nyou should push back on that you can say\nlike yeah but I really think like video\ngames are my problem in that it may look\nlike depression but and so I think it's\nvery important if you're if you're with\na therapist that you say what is on your\nmind because that's what really helps\nthem if you just say what's on your mind\neven if you disagree with them that\nshould be fine and if they don't listen\nto you then you should find a different\ntherapist unfortunately some of them no\none's you know no perfect so\num thoughts on coronavirus II I think\ncoronaviruses Batman I don't know like\nwhat is going on in China where like\nthey're having all these like really bad\nviruses break out not quite sure like\nthere's some kind of public health issue\nthere what are their breeding bad\nviruses I don't know if it's because of\nthe way that they like keep their\nchickens or what because there's so\nlittle information about what's going on\nbut it's like that like it's not it's\nnot a coincidence that you know like\nSARS the corona virus and like other\npublic health catastrophes or like\ncoming like when you have public health\ncatastrophe after public health\ncatastrophe come out of a particular\ncountry like that's a problem right so\nthey they have something within their\nsystem of reporting or the way that they\ntreat things or the way that they house\nbecause these are all zoo and otic\ninfections right that's important to\nremember as well so these are all like\nlike I think most of them were coming\nfrom poultry so I think they've probably\ngot something going on in terms of like\nthe way that they're handling zoonotic\nstuff so let's use Anakim paracin so mad\ncow was a big deal you know like a\ndecade or more ago and we haven't really\nheard much about mad cow mad cow by the\nway is absolutely terrifying if you all\ndon't really know what it is it's a\nterrifying concept in medicine and mad\ncow isn't like as big of a deal now like\nwe don't hear about continual mad cow\noutbreaks I'm sure they're conspiracy\ntheorists out there who say that oh\nthey're outbreaks happening all the time\nbut the truth is that like people have\nmade I think the UK and the US have\nimplemented like very strong although if\nyou really look at it kind of terrifying\nlevels of oversight like it isn't how\nlittle oversight there is but they've\nimplemented sufficient oversight to\nprevent further outbreaks of Mad Cow\nwhich is really really great so my\nquestion is I don't know what China's\npublic health policies are I don't know\nif it's just they're unlucky but like I\nthink it's it's interesting and you know\nyou have to wonder why there are\nmultiple zoonotic bird related\ninfections that are like killing people\nin China is it is it so bad because they\njust don't have the infrastructure to\nsupport the health like I don't know I\ndon't know what's going on but I think\nfrom a systems perspective like that's\nproblematic\nthat's what I think I was wondering if\nyou could advise on recovering from\ndopamine exhaustion I'm finding that\nonce I cut out gaming I tend to randomly\nbrowse the internet and watch shows when\nI would rather be developing productive\nup hobbies and habits okay so fantastic\nyou and everyone else myself included\nright so like it's not just about\ncutting out gaming so this is a big\nimportant point so we'll talk about\ndopamine exhaustion in a second the\nfirst thing to understand like the whole\nreason that we did healthy gamer like\nwhy is it called healthy gamer is\nbecause I don't think gaming is actually\nthe problem right so people who take an\nabstinence approach to gaming abstinence\nonly approach to gaming like for some\npeople it's very successful but like\nwhat I think is way way more common than\nsomeone cutting out gaming and then\ntransforming their lives is this you cut\nout gaming and then you just replace it\nwith other crap so you got to get to the\nroot of why you're gaming in the first\nplace right you have to build a healthy\nlife for yourself what are the the\nemotions that you're avoiding through\ngaming because you can stop the gaming\nbut your brain is gonna find other way\nto avoid the emotions and it'll like\nyou'll Sprouse read it and watch TV\nshows to avoid your emotions you will\nfind a way to procrastinate if you\nreally want to procrastinate your mind\nis really good at procrastination mind\nis really good at avoidance so cutting\nout gaming is a good and significant\nstep but I don't I think it's like a\nband-aid it's like looking at the\nsymptom of the problem instead of the\nroot the root is like what is it in your\nlife why aren't you moving forward in\nlife what are you trying to avoid and\nwhat are you like afraid of about\nforward momentum so we had an interview\na couple weeks ago with crucify was kind\nof talking about having an invisible\nwall like when he tries to make progress\nhe runs to an invisible wall and we were\nI was surprised to discover that his\ninvisible wall it's a great interview by\nthe way isn't actually a wall it's\nactually himself holding himself back so\nwhen he starts to make progress like on\nif he gets a job like he quits it after\nseven days but on day three he starts to\nlike not want to go and like that's\nwhere the money is\nand so a bizarre thing that happens is\nlike the better he does in life the more\nhis depression happens and I'd be\nwondering\nhow common that pattern is so the\nquestion is you know what is it that the\ngaming is actually protecting you from\nand if you can deal with those feelings\nof shame or fear or social anxiety or\nwhatever like then you don't need shows\non the Internet\nright because this is a game of\nwhack-a-mole I see this also in people\nwho have borderline personality disorder\neating disorders and substance use\nthere's a group of people that I you\nknow work with that all have all three\nof those things so they have an eating\ndisorder they have something called BPD\nso they do self-harm at behaviors and\nthey have problems with substances like\nalcohol so this is like the the sort of\nthis textbook example of this like the\nquestion that you're gonna see if you\ntake a medical board exam is like a 17\nyear old girl who cuts uses alcohol and\nhasn't like is like underway and what we\nfind when we treat these people is if\nyou can control one of them the others\nget worse and if you can control two of\nthem the last thing gets worse so if you\nstop them from self harming and cut out\nthe alcohol they're eating gets worse if\nyou force them to eat or you engage in\nlike like anorexia treatment and you\nstop them from drinking then they're\ncutting gets worse I mean if you do\nanorexia treatment and stop them from\ncutting than their drinking gets worse\nso like it's a game of whack-a-mole and\nit can be really frustrating and\nengender a lot of difficult dynamics\nbetween you and the patient but the\nissue here is that like all three of\nthose are coping mechanisms to deal with\nnegative emotion cutting is actually a\ncoping mechanism it's almost like a\nmeditative practice when you really talk\nto people about it it's not they're not\ntrying to actually hurt themselves it's\njust the pain focuses their mind and\nlike relieves them of emotional tension\nif you talk to people who engage in\nself-harm behaviors that's actually how\nthey describe it and so the cool thing\nis that they get better when you start\nteaching them things like meditation so\nwhen you teach the meditation they have\nsomething else that they can go to for\nthat emotional relief so you can play\nwhack-a-mole with Netflix Reddit and\ngaming all you want to\nand gaming I do think is like more\ninsidious because it engages our brain\nin a more profound way then let's say\nreddit or Netflix does like you have no\nsense of like online identity or\naccomplishment when you're well maybe\nwhen you browse reddit and you get\nuploaded we'll see there you go\nthat's why read it's addictive so like\nNetflix is the least addict addictive it\nsounds like reddit is a little bit more\naddictive in gaming is even more\naddictive so the issue is what's at the\nroot now the second thing is this person\nis talking about dopamine exhaustion\nthere's got to be like YouTube videos on\nour channel about this I hope if not\nthen I'll make one but this is just a\ngeneral concept that's important to\nunderstand in terms of playing a lot of\nvideo games when I work with people who\nplay excessive video games they talk\nabout like being bored and if you really\nask them like what's what they hate the\nmost and what they're trying to avoid\nmore than anything is not any kind of\nemotion or anything like that is boredom\nthey hate boredom and when they stop\ntrying to play games they feel bored and\nso I feel like the biggest enemy like\nthe biggest challenge is just straight\nborder like that's the challenge that's\nthem it's not some complicated\npsychological your dad did this or\nyou're afraid of death or you know it's\nnot anything like that it's just boredom\nso let's think about what boredom is\nand we're gonna jump to the interview in\nabout five five minutes okay so when you\nplay video games your your mezzo limbic\nthe mesolimbic circuit of your brain\nreleases something called dopamine and\nthe bezel limbic circuit of your brain\nis is that's one of the dopamine\ncircuits that governs pleasure and\nreward so there are other dope there\nother dopamine circuits for example that\nregulate movement and things like that\nso people who have Parkinson's disease\nthey also have like they have a dopamine\nshortage in their brain so there are\nlots of dopamine does a lot of stuff in\nyour brain it's not just pleasure and\nreward but the Meisel limbic circuit is\ndevoted to pleasure and reward so when\nyou play a video game you dump a lot of\ndopamine and on a regular basis in your\nmieze olympic circuit with spikes of\nhigher reward so if we take a drug like\ncocaine cocaine causes a large amount of\ndopamine to be dumped into your reward\nsystem like very quickly whereas gaming\nis like slow steady dopamine with spurts\nand that's why you can play a game for\nlike 12 hours and then they're like\nmoments in the game what do you feel\nsuper excited and it's very kind of\nactivating and engaging so how does the\nbody respond to constant stimuli it does\nit responds by something called\ntolerance and so what what tolerance is\nis like if you drink caffeine every day\nlike at first it kind of wires you and\ncan keep you up all night but if you\ndrink enough of it your your brain\nactually down regulates caffeine\nreceptors and what that means is it\nnumbs itself to the signal of caffeine\nso when you needed to drink one cup of\ncoffee and that would have kept you\nwired through the night if you drink\ncoffee every day like one cup of coffee\nisn't gonna keep you wired because your\nbrain has kind of numbed itself to the\neffects of caffeine and so if we look at\ngaming people who game a lot their brain\nalso adapts same principle so it numbs\nitself to dopamine and that's what I\ncall dopamine exhaustion you just like\nrun out of dopamine and the dopamine\ndoesn't have really much effect and your\nyour body it's really a tolerance\nprinciple but and then you kind of\nso things like become less fun so then\nif you stop gaming so gaming remember is\nlike a steady stream of dopamine with\nspikes but then if you try to do\nsomething like read a book reading a\nbook just releases less dopamine then\nplaying a videogame does and so when\npeople start to like to try to do other\nthings they find them boring and the\nreason they find them boring is because\nyour brain is built up such a tolerance\nto dopamine it's numbing that signal of\nenjoyment that's literally why\neverything is boring because your brain\nnumbs the sensation of reward and\npleasure because you've dumped so much\ndopamine into your Me's Olympic circuit\nbut that's how your brain is gonna adapt\nso what you need to do is just\nunderstand that for two weeks if you cut\nout gaming you're gonna be bored you're\ngonna be really bored and that overtime\nthat boredom is gonna go away in and of\nitself and this is the problem that a\nlot of gamers make is they conclude that\nthe activity is what's boring right you\nremove yourself from the equation you're\nlike oh I don't like to read a book\nbooks are boring I don't like to garden\ngardening is boring I don't like to go\nfishing fishing is boring I don't like\nto work out working out is boring I\ndon't like to go to job my job job is\nboring I don't like to go to my classes\nclass is boring so you associate boredom\nwith the activity without acknowledging\nthat your neuro chemistry is actually\nwhat's causing it boring when you find\nyour job class fishing working out\ngardening and reading all boring that's\nnot everything in the world being boring\nthat's you right so you have dopamine\nexhaustion so what you need to do is\nstop exposing your brain to dopamine for\na long time so take a period of like two\nweeks do something like a gaming cleanse\nand just understand that for two weeks\nI'm not gonna be sad I'm not gonna be\nshamed I may have low energy level but\nthe main challenge that you have to you\nhave to survive two weeks of boredom and\nif you survive two weeks a Bourdon\nboredom something magical happens all of\nthose things that you used to be boring\nthen start becoming fun\nthen the even more magical thing happens\nwhat gamers want more than anything else\nis to enjoy the things that they should\ndo\ngamers look at themselves and they say\noh like I like playing video games and I\nfind school boring I wish I was like\nthose people who found school fun\nbecause if I found school fun\nthey'd enjoy it then I could study and\nthen I could get a job and then I could\ntake control of my life\nI wish I was like those people well\nhere's the thing you can be like those\npeople you can literally do it all you\nhave to do is alter your neuro chemistry\nthrough a two-week like gaming cleanse\nthirty days is better and as your brain\nrewires and like recalibrates and as\nyour tolerance level goes down then\nyou're gonna enjoy things better and\nthen you will become the very thing that\nyou want it to be and once you become\nthat thing and you enjoy school like\nthat means you're gonna do better in\nyour classes that means you're gonna\ngraduate like you're gonna enjoy working\nout more your motivation that intrinsic\nmotivation that most gamers are missing\nwill start to come back and as it comes\nback like that's how you become a\nhealthy gamer like that's my whole point\nis that like as you build things in your\nlife that you also find enjoyable you're\nliving a healthy and fulfilling life and\nthen you like also get to play video\ngames the crazy thing is is that even\nthe best part the games even become more\nfun like the gaming becomes more fun\nminute to minute hour to hour when the\nrest of your life is in order it gets\nbetter\nokay I just watched the video with\nreckful and hearing the four states of\nconsciousness got me thinking and\napologies for what will probably turn\nout to be a wall of text apology\naccepted is game okay so if you guys\nwant to y'all can go back and look at\nthe video with reckful I also talked\nabout this with Devin Nash on one of our\nearlier streams about the different like\nfor states of like consciousness and\nmind it's a pretty interesting way to\nunderstand how your mind works as gamers\ndo you know that feeling when you're\ncompletely immersed in the game and\nenter into sort of a trance where your\nmind stops thinking you and you become\none with the carrot\nyes I do that's called a flow state for\nexample when playing a shooter you no\nlonger feel even you no longer even feel\nmoving your mouse or pressing buttons or\nyour keyboard no thoughts or anything\nyou just automatically react react to\nwhatever's on screen get in your groove\nand just play yeah absolutely so the\nfirst thing let's just pause here so\nthat's a flow state right so a flow\nstate is a period of time where your\nmind is like ultra focused and you lose\nsome sense of self and you kind of like\nbecome one with the activity so in a\nflow state your performance improves you\nfeel better and like you're not plagued\nwith stuff like anxieties I find that I\nperform exponentially better in that\nmindset both in in a game environment\nand when attempting to be productive yes\nso this is correct\nokay so let's pause this for a second\nthis is exactly what I'm saying\nso your productivity has nothing to do\nwith like whether it's a game or school\nor your cooking or whatever the quality\nand state of your mind determines your\nproductivity it goes back to what we\nwere saying last time about boredom\npeople think that is a particular thing\nthat makes them bored no your mind is in\na pro boredom state and if you can get\ninto a flow state it doesn't matter what\nyou can do you can be playing to music\nyou can be singing music you can be\nhanging out with your kids you can be\ngardening you can be playing a video\ngame it all gets better everything gets\nbetter and that's because you change\nright like this is about remember guys\nlike in when you're playing the game of\nlife like you have a character and your\ncharacter influences things it's not\njust the environment so like it's like\nwhen your character goes into like you\nknow flow mode you are gonna perform\nbetter it's like a buff to all of your\nstats and all of your skills 20%\nimprovement to all of your stats and all\nof your skills when you're a flow state\nis that actually it's way more than 20%\nit's probably 100% is that State of Mind\nsimilar to the place I'm trying to enter\nwhen meditating yes and no so the goal\nof this the meditative mind is to have\nconsciousness with no mental activity\nthe goal of a flow state is to have\neither consciousness with one pointed in\nfocus mental activity or focused mental\nactivity without consciousness that may\nactually be a flow State I'm gonna have\nto think about that and explore that\nmyself so the question is like do you\nlose track of time and awareness of self\nwhen you're in a flow state because a\nflow State may be one pointedness of\nmind not a variable mind with actually\nno consciousness I'm not sure or whether\nconsciousness is there or not or not and\nwhat what I will tell you is so I I\nteach people how to get into flow States\nand these include physicians surgeons\ninvestment bankers professional gamers\nNFL athletes and I teach them and train\nthem how to get into a flow state and\nlike I teach all of these different\npeople because the activity doesn't\nmatter it's the state of mind that\nmatters right so when I work with like\nan eSports team I teach them how to\nenter flow States so that like when they\nstart to tilt and their anxiety like\nraises through the roof and it affects\ntheir performance I teach them how to\nrecalibrate their brains so that they\ndon't they get out of that state so it's\nvery similar to end the way I teach that\nis by teaching meditation and then we\nkind of do additional things as well but\nmeditation is a great way to facilitate\nflow States not exactly the same but\nit's like moving you in the general\nballpark I've been chasing that state of\nmind since I break out of thought loops\nand just simply do very good does anyone\nelse enter such a mindset when doing\nwork absolutely very productive people\ndo\ndoes anyone else even experience what\nI'm describing or am I just crazy no\nyou're not crazy the reason that you\nfeel like you're crazy is because this\nis a hard state of mind to duplicate\nright so you have these flashes of\ninsight where you're in this state of\nmind and you're like whoa that was\namazing like I played a better game I'm\nable to study and then you try to chase\nit right and you even said you chase it\nthe problem is that the act of chasing\nreduces the chance that you'll enter a\nfront flow state so the more that you\nchase the flow state the harder the flow\nState is to attain\nand then you think you're crazy because\nit happens once and it's like brilliant\nand wonderful and then like you try to\nfind it again and you can't find it\nagain so then you start to question\nyourself you're like kind of gaslighting\nyourself like did that really happen is\nthat really possible does this happen to\nother people this is kind of weird\nbecause 90% of the time or even 95% of\ntime or 99% at a time you're in the\nthought loop state where your mind is\nsuper active because most of the time as\nwe live our day our mind is active\nthat's what it does it's active it's\nthinking about stuff that's how we do it\nand then rarely you enter a flow state\nkind of naturally but that absolutely\nworks for other people and I'd say that\nthe more successful people that I meet\ntend to enter flow States better and if\nyou think about like where I was when I\nwas failing out of college and where I\nam now like one of the biggest things\nthat's changed is my ability to enter a\nflow State so I consistently enter flow\nStates and that's what makes me\nsuccessful right it's my state of mind\nbut this is what I keep telling people\nlike my personality hasn't changed I'm\nso lazy I still procrastinate I still\nlike watch the Leipzig major instead of\ndoing my work but the difference is that\nI enter flow States on a pretty regular\nbasis and since I enter flow States I\ntend to be productive enough and I do\nwell in life it's not crazy\nso I'd say absolutely try to cultivate\nflow States then your question is gonna\nbe how which is a fair question so we'll\nlet me just think about how to teach you\nguys how to that's like a long thing\nthough\nI can't just explain that in five\nminutes beyond meditating but I don't\nthink that's sufficient so let me think\nI'm just gonna have to add that like I\nhave to so we're developing a curriculum\nof like start to finish stuff about\nmeditation and Tyrel and Ayurveda so I'm\ngonna have to add a segment on flow\nStates then how to cultivate them so I'm\njust gonna have to make a mental note to\ndo that okay\nby the way so you guys know sometimes I\ndo what I just did and I pause on stream\nand I like stop doing whatever I'm doing\nand sometimes when I'm talking to people\nit's kind of awkward but I'm gonna say\nI'm gonna just think for a minute that\nis literally me trying to go into like a\nlittle mini flow state like it's like me\ntaking a step back in reducing my\nthought loops and if I'm really really\ndesperate then I'll really try to go\ninto a flow state because if I'm\ndesperate and I don't know what to think\nlike I literally what that means is my\nbrain is picking up on something that I\ncannot logically process and it's too\nmuch so I have to pause and I have to\nlike get into the flow state and then\nsomething like some answer comes out and\nthat's part of what makes me effective\nlike if you guys watch my interviews\nwe'll see if it happens today so keep an\neye out so actually this is what we\nshould do today so I want you guys to be\nmore active viewers today okay I want\nyou guys to look watch me and try to see\nwhen I enter a flow state and when I\ndon't and try to see when is my thinking\nlogical and when is it not logical and\njust because it's not logical doesn't\nmean it's wrong but I think you guys\nwill be able to see some of the stuff\nthat I do is logical in a product of the\nanalytical mind but some of it is not\nthe analytical mind and I'm trying to do\nlike this crap like I don't know how\nelse to describe it but like I it's\nsomething like meditation something like\na flow state something like intuition as\nopposed to analysis and try to see if\nyou can tell the difference okay and\nthen we'll talk about it a little bit\nafter the interview okay this is a great\nquestion I see you keep flaming therapy\nis there a situation which therapy is\nthe right move what alternatives do you\nrecommend so I I think therapy is\nfantastic so I was sharing with you guys\nmy personal beefs with therapy right but\nthat's like\nI think it's important when you engage\nin a practice to understand its\nweaknesses it doesn't mean that the\npractice is bad right you can also say\nthat like college sucks for all kinds of\nreasons it doesn't mean that college is\nbad but college sucks because people are\nclick is sure like you know people their\nfraternities or like you can say\nwhatever you want to about things being\nnegative so I want to thank you for\nanswering this question because I think\ntherapy is actually really good and like\nI said I recommended therapy to him so I\nthink that you know I was being critical\nof a therapist was just really unfair\nbecause I didn't understand you know the\ntherapist may have been making their\njudgment based on all the information\nthat Jake was sharing with them so the\ntherapist may be correct too\nso it does sound like the dad is\nemotionally unavailable to be fair right\nbecause we can sort of infer that it's\nnot like rocket science so it's kind of\na dick thing for me to say I think\ntherapy is actually very good I mean I'm\na therapist in my day job so I think\nit's very effective I think a lot of\npeople could benefit from it I think\nmost people could benefit from it but I\nthink like with anything that you do in\nlife you should understand what the\nshortcomings and downsides are because\nthat allows you to protect against them\nso the funny thing is that I think that\nsomething like what we do on stream is a\nvery good adjunct to therapy so I think\nif you want to correct your life you\nshould meditate watch stuff like this\nstream work out you know watch like\nprofessional streams and stuff to like\nlearn how to make a resume and go to\ntherapy I think it's actually oftentimes\nthe right call and very rarely is that\nthe wrong call\nwhat's your opinion on Kundalini Yoga so\nI think Kundalini Yoga is an incredibly\npowerful spiritual practice that should\nbe done under the guidance of a guru\nso Kundalini Yoga can like literally\nmake people go crazy so I was talking a\nlittle bit I don't know if I mentioned\nthis but there are you know there case\nreports of meditation induced psychosis\nmeditation is also practiced that comes\nwith risks and Kundalini Yoga is\nactually one of the more riskier kinds\nof yoga now if you go to like a yoga\nstudio and they'd have a kundalini yoga\nclass that's not real Kundalini Yoga\nthat's all of that is hot day yoga and\nit's all awesome awesome is yoga\npostures so 99% or 95% of what they\nteach it in yoga classes yoga studio is\nlike in the West is not true inauthentic\nKundalini Yoga so true and authentic\nKundalini Yoga involves a couple of\nthings leak shock which means initiation\nthe second thing so it involves ASSA and\nit also involves prana I am so certain\nbreathing practices it also involves\nvery specific modernist mood the resin\nBundys pattern are specific meditation\nor focusing techniques mudras or\nparticular hand signs or locks and\nBundys or locks so you lock certain\nparts of your body to shift the flow of\nyour branagh so true Kundalini Yoga\ninvolves like all of that stuff and if\nyou do that under without the guidance\nof a guru like I really don't think that\nthat's safe but I think it's really\npowerful I so a big part of my personal\npractice very early on and what I felt\nwas somewhat transformative was\nKundalini Yoga okay hey dr. K just\nrecently found your channel I'm starting\nmy internship this year and will soon be\nwrapping up my clinical psych PhD as I\nmove into my career I think at some\npoint it would be awesome to do\nsomething on the side that benefits the\ncommunity I grew up in a lot of mmo's\nand fighting games any suggestions for\nways to give back to the community have\nyou ever thought about collaborating\nwith other mental health providers and\nprofessionals with this stuff yeah so\nfirst of all I think it's great that\nyou're pursuing a psych PhD and that you\nwant to give back to your your gamer\nbros and girls and everything in between\nso I think\nways to get back to the community so you\nknow you're welcome to get involved with\nus so we're we're you know as we're\ntraining coaches and stuff I'm we're\nexploring a lot of other kind of options\nand I think if you're especially a\ntrained psychologist that would be cool\nso you could try to help us because\nwe're trying to help people and they're\nmore people than I can help and the\nsecond thing is have I thought about\ncollaborating with other mental health\nproviders and professionals absolutely\nso I you know I have a couple of\nprofessional connections that are you\nknow all over the place so like there\nare other therapists and psychiatrists\nthat I talked to about what the work\nthat I'm doing some of them find me\nbecause their YouTube algorithm sent me\nsend me their way and then I'm also\ntrying to educate psychiatrists and\nsoon-to-be psychologists about video\ngame addiction and stuff like that so I\ndo some national stuff I teach a lot\nthrough residency programs and through\nHMS I I'm doing stuff with the American\nPsychiatric Association so I have like\nthis whole academic side like part of\nthe reason that I only stream like six\nor seven hours a week is because you\nknow I do all this other kind of\nacademic stuff clinical stuff things\nlike that I mean if you're interested in\ngetting involved with that you know we\nhave a prospective collaboration with\nMIT going on so we'll see how that goes\nto actually like study neuroscience and\nthings like that so you know if you're\ninterested in getting involved in any of\nthat stuff reach out I think we're gonna\ntry to add a link at the bottom for\npeople who are interested in\nvolunteering or getting involved so yeah\nyeah if you guys want me to quit in\ninstream full-time you got it I got to\nget those sweet sweet subs and I've\ntransman dr. K has bills to pay do you\nthink we shouldn't listen to music 24/7\nbecause our minds are overstimulated\num no I think the bigger problem well I\nguess yeah maybe maybe the answer is yes\nso I'd be really curious why you listen\nto music 24/7 like what do you get like\nif you're listening to something 24/7\naren't you basically drowning it out\nlike do you really listen to it I mean I\nfind music to be incredibly impactful\nfor my mental state like I really like\nit to get me in the right kind of mood\nto work or facilitate a flow State or\nget pumped up but I find that like them\nyou know you you have to be intentional\nI mean if I intentionally listen to\nmusic it pumps me up if it's playing on\nin the background as less of an effect\nso I listen to certain music before I\nstream and I think it puts me in like a\ngood mindset and do I think your mind is\ngonna be too stimulated yeah so I think\nthat you should give your mind a break\nfor mental activity so remember that\nyour mind is sort of like a cow and\nlikes to chew over things so it's like\nit wants to like chew cud and things\nlike that so it wants like chew over\nthings so I think if you I found that in\nmy life like I noticed one day that you\nknow I would listen to an audio like I\nlisten to audio lectures and stuff in\nthe morning when I was in med school and\nthen on the train I would listen to an\naudio lecture when I was walking to the\ntrain when I sat down on the train I\nwould study I would listen to an audio\nbook or something like that when I get\noff the train and walk into class then\nI'm in class and like basically like the\nwhole day my mind was occupied by you\nknow audio lectures or audio books which\nI listened to a lot of and there was\nthis phase in my life where I felt like\nI didn't want to waste a moment I always\nwanted to be learning something so a lot\nof audiobooks in between studying and\nthen I realized like actually I'm just\nmy mind is just I need to give my mind\ntime to just be itself because I think\nsomething you guys have to remember is\nthat sure you can learn a lot from other\npeople and reading things and stuff like\nthat but do not underestimate what your\nmind can discover so if you give your\nmind enough like\nspace it will process things and help\nyou understand things and make\ndiscoveries of its own it'll give you\ncreative ideas like just think about\nthis for a second you know like I don't\nknow if you guys are Game of Thrones\nfans and I'm talking about the show\ntalking about books but you know if you\nthink about that like how did george RR\nmartin like his mind came up with that\nright if he was constantly listening to\nstuff and constantly occupying his time\nhe would not be able to create new ideas\nnew ideas and creativity requires space\nfor them to happen and if you feel stuck\nin life if you feel uninspired part of\nthat may be because you're not giving\nyour mind the space to actually like\nfigure out what it wants to do so I\nthink you should be careful about me\nlistening to music 24/7 and really try\nto understand what is it doing for you\nand what is it doing for your mind\nwhat's happening in the brain with you\nall of a sudden stop enjoying games and\nactually prefer doing more productive\nthings is it still about dopamine levels\nthe short answer is I don't know and no\none does okay the long answer is I don't\nthink so so I think that over time if\nyou feel stuck in life or if you engage\nyour mind in other ways that's gonna\nlike create intrinsic motivations or\npulls away from video games the other\nthing that happens over time is that\nyour frontal lobes and prefrontal cortex\nmature so frontal lobes and prefrontal\ncortex are responsible for impulse\ncontrol and being able to delay\ngratification so when you're like a\nfive-year-old\nyour capacity to enjoy investing a lot\nof work and getting out of it versus an\nimmediate reward is like really skewed\nlike five-year-olds don't get much\naccomplishment out of growing a tomato\nplant over the course of months and like\ngetting value out of like getting that\ntomato it mean like when spring comes\naround\nright they don't have that capacity\nbecause their prefrontal cortex so\nthey'll eat the tomato they'll enjoy the\ntomato but the idea of like invested\nwork and like reaping those rewards is\nnot something that their brain enjoys as\nmuch as like impulsive activities as we\ngrow older\nso our IQ can top out relatively quickly\nbut our brain involves so much more than\nlike analytical capability so our\nfrontal lobes develop until about the\nage of 30 and some people even say like\n30 to 35 I suspect in gamers they\nactually continue to develop because\nthey're like sort of delayed in their\ndevelopment until like 32 to 35 and so a\nlot of that change in enjoyment is\nbecause as your frontal lobes develop\nyour capacity to enjoy activities that\ninvolve delayed gratification and your\nsense of accomplishment from a hard\nday's work is actually actually changes\nso that's just one circuit in addition\nor one neuro scientific principle that\nin addition to dopamine can explain your\nresponse but I think there's all kinds\nof other stuff that goes on like other\nkinds of psychological things and stuff\nlike that but the short answer is it's\ncomplicated and no one really knows but\nI do think it's way more than dopamine\nand the simplest thing is you know as\nyou grow older your capacity to delay\ngratification and enjoy high investment\nactivities increases dr. K I've noticed\nquite a few references so we'll do like\ntwo more questions then we're gonna wrap\nup okay dr. K I've noticed quite a few\nreferences to spirituality in the videos\nof yours that I've seen so far do you\nfind spirituality conflicts with\nscientific research not at all\nso let me be clear about a couple of\nthings so the reason that I talk about\nspirituality is because you guys asked\nfor it right so the early phases of our\nif you guys like go through our healthy\ngame or like the original YouTube list\nlike the twelve videos for the first\nworkshop that I did and we've got about\n25 other videos that are just collecting\ndust\nI talked very little about spirituality\nit's all psychology and neuroscience\nwell referenced the interesting thing as\nI've started interacting with my\ncommunity and as I've started streaming\nwhat I see\nso let's just take our inner what I see\nis like Adam like what's missing is not\nthe science it's like this the stuff\nthat we call spirituality so if we think\nabout our last interview with Jake we\ncan talk so we did a lot of like\npsychology stuff at the beginning we\ntalked about emotions we talked about\nalexithymia we helped him find his\nemotions and that's like that helps him\nbut it's not like the full story for him\nright the full story for him I didn't\nfeel like the interview was complete\nuntil we talked about Dharma so I think\nwhat's missing and what people ask for\nis like I mean the most questions that\nI've are about Dharma and so that's\nwhat's missing you guys lack purpose\nit's not just depression and anxiety and\nthat's also why this isn't therapy\nbecause therapy is about treating\ndepression and anxiety\nit's about diagnosing and treating a\nparticular condition this is this goes\nbeyond that right like we started with\nsome psychology and then like we\nabsolutely moved on to spirituality with\nthe end so I'm talking more about\nspirituality because that's what I'm\nsensing people need and science I mean I\nthink they're both great I don't think\nthey conflict at all so I think that\nover time science and spirituality are\ngonna get closer and closer and closer\ntogether so the more that we understand\nlet me just think if I could find a good\nexample of this so this is gonna be kind\nof a stretch but how to explain this\nbecause they're just some assumptions\nthat we take for granted which we think\nare logical and scientific but are not\nactually logical and scientific so let's\ntalk for a second about okay so this may\nnot make much sense and I have to\nprobably formulate this argument better\nbut I'm gonna just try\nso karma is a spiritual concept right\nlike people think about God Amara karma\nis a spiritual concept it's not a\nscientific concept but if you really\nlook at this the definition of Karma all\nkarma means is cause and effect\ngarma just says that there are causes\nand their effects and that if you see in\neffect now there is a cause in the past\nthat explains why things are the way\nthat they are that is really all the\ntheory of karma says that's the essence\nof the theory of karma and so we look at\nthat and we say okay the theory of karma\nis kind of like not scientific right you\ncan look at something like physics and\nthen as people discovered like law like\nso Yogi's have been saying that all\neffects are preceded by causes for\nthousands of years before we understood\nlike Newtonian physics that was not\naccepted within the scientific community\nNewton was the one who discovered like\nthe laws you know his laws of physics\nwhich is that every action has an equal\nand opposite reaction that became\nscience and we now all accept that is\ntrue but after Isaac Newton but before\nthat garma was saying that all along\nlike karma and Isaac Newton are saying\nlike basically the same thing and now we\njust assume that that scientific so in\nour minds a concept that used to be\nunder the umbrella of spirituality has\nnow been moved to scientific because of\nscientific exploration right like that's\nwhat's happened now we regard that\nconcept is not spiritual anymore but its\nscientific even though it's been talked\nabout by spiritual people for thousands\nof years so here's the next example of\nthat is genetics so people said okay\nfine in the realm of physics we can say\nthat every action has an equal and\nopposite reaction but when someone is\nborn a particular way is that random and\nthe answer is no that the genetics and\nnow we sort of all accept genetics we\nall understand genetics but you have to\nlike think of like put yourself in the\nshoes of someone like in the 1800's and\nlike how radical of a concept genetics\nis\nthat your physical form is not\ndetermined by like is determined by like\nsomething that is like not under your\ncontrol at all and has nothing to do\nwith this life like your choices or\nanything like that that genetics is\nessentially like the process of some\ncause that creates a particular effect\nand that's kind of like a no-brainer\nright like that's like a no-brainer like\nDalek genetics means that my hair is\nblack because both my parents have black\nhair but that was actually like a\nrelatively revolutionary concept like\nover a hundred years ago and gadhimai\nhas sort of implies that and you can you\ncan make an argument that karma doesn't\nimply that and that's a fair argument go\ndown that road but I I think that\nactually what's happening is that the\nmore we investigate science the closer\nthe more we're finding scientific\nvalidity for certain spiritual concepts\nso I'll give you guys sort of the last\nexample which we don't fully understand\nyet\nso I talked a lot about Dharma Dharma is\nduty or responsibility and it's my\nbelief that Dharma is the thing that\nallows you to face difficult things in\nlife and choose the right thing despite\nit being hard so in addiction psychiatry\nresearch what we've realized is that for\npeople to quit in addiction so people\npeople took a bunch of people who were\naddicted to substances and then tried to\nunderstand how is it that one person is\nable to quit and another person is\nunable to quit so we did qualitative and\nquantitative research on people who are\naddicted to substances and we tried to\nlook for the sweet secret sauce like\nwhere's the magic like what is it that\nallows one person to overcome alcoholism\nand another person to not overcome\nalcoholism and the answer is something\ncalled a competing interest or that's\nnot the answer it's one of the variables\nright there are a lot of variables we\ndon't know and so competing interest is\nlike a good reason that makes it worth\nyour while to quit the substance and\nthat is Dharma like those are that's the\nsame thing so like science it talks\nabout a competing interest\nYogi's talk about Tata MA and it like\nthe end of the day a competing interest\nin the tournament it's like a good\nreason a duty or a responsibility if you\nactually look at what are examples of\ncompeting interests and I've talked\nabout this before but I'll give you guys\nan example so I was like working with\nsomeone around smoking cessation and I\ntried to inform them of all the dangers\nof smoking cessation like lung cancer\nheart disease stroke etc and as much as\nI hate them week after week after week\nafter week after week they didn't quit\nsmoking and then one day I decided to be\na dick and I said do you ever want to\nsee your daughter graduate from college\ndo you ever want to see her get married\nand do you ever want to meet your\ngrandkids that got him to change because\nthat's his Dharma\nthat's a competing interest same thing\nso I don't think that spirituality and\nscientific research conflict at all in\nfact I think the more that we advance in\nscientific research the closer we will\nvalidate certain spiritual concepts the\nreason I say certain spiritual concepts\nthis is very important because I don't\nthink all spiritual concepts are correct\nI think as we investigate some we will\nnot find any evidence of them and as we\ninvestigate others we will see what's\ntrue and what is it because that's\nwhat's cool about science science tells\nus what's true the thing that we have to\nbe careful about though is that we have\nto understand that science is still\nprogressing in our capacity for science\nis still in its infancy in some areas\nespecially when it comes to psychology\nand neuroscience like we understand like\nNewtonian mechanics pretty well we're\ngetting a better sense of things like\nquantum mechanics we have a pretty good\nunderstanding cardiac physiology we have\na pretty good understanding of\nendocrinology we have less of an\nunderstanding of the immune system less\nof an understanding of the brain and\neven less understanding of psychology\nright so what that means is that we have\nto remember that just because science is\nnot discovered or validated a particular\nspiritual concept is that concept\nrelated to something that is in the\nneuroscience or psychology round because\nif so we're gonna suck at investigating\nthat so you have to have you have to\nremember that some spiritual concepts\nare gonna be wrong and that you\nshouldn't accept spirituality just for\nits own sake that spirituality should in\nand can be tested by science but also\nthat science has limitations\nthat science is not going to be\nappropriately equipped to test for\nthings like reincarnation we just don't\nhave the scientific capability of that\nyet so is it logical to believe in it is\nit scientific to believe in it\nabsolutely not but it is my hope that\none day we will progress science to the\npoint of somehow being able to test\nreincarnation because if it is real that\nmeans that science should be able to\ntest it at some point that's like that's\nhow the world works right and I know it\nsounds absolutely crazy today but I\nthink you guys just have to remember\nthat like a thousand years ago we didn't\nunderstand how electricity worked we\nsure as hell didn't understand the brain\nwe didn't understand like something like\nwe couldn't send someone to the moon a\nthousand years ago\nwe couldn't send someone of the room two\nhundred years ago those would have been\ncompletely ludicrous we didn't even know\nwhat the moon was a thousand years ago\nso it's like so there are things that\nsound absolutely ridiculous and I\nunderstand that it sounds absolutely\nridiculous to be able to test\nreincarnation like what the f are you\ntalking about how do you even go about\ndoing that short answer is I don't know\nI don't have any idea but we should be\ncareful not to have scientific arrogance\nthat our capacity to test and understand\nthe world right now is like anywhere\nclose to complete because there is\nnothing that I can there I've seen no\nevidence although our capacity to\nunderstand is growing at an asset a\nexponential rate I have no idea where\nthe asymptote is if that makes sense to\npeople like I don't know like we could\ncontinue growing at this rate of\nscientific understanding for 2,000 years\nand be like ten thousand times as smart\nas we are today and still like not\nunderstand half of what goes on in the\nuniverse so I don't think that those\nconflict at all and what I actually\nreally like is like what gives me a lot\nof personal like comfort and confidence\nis when there are scientific points that\nvalidate spiritual concepts and in my\npersonal life and also like in my\ntreatment what I try to do is find the\nareas where spirituality and science\noverlap and it's those things that I\nrecommend the strong them the most like\nwe're\nin the best example of that is every\nstream I don't talk about iron mother I\ndon't talk about reincarnation I sort of\ntalk about Dharma because that's what\nyou guys want but what is the one thing\nthat I recommend on every single stream\nyou guys know absolutely and why is that\nit's because there is overwhelming\nspiritual support for it and\noverwhelming scientific support for it\nand let's remember so meditation is the\nlast example that'll leave you guys with\nlet's remember that meditation was\nthought is like hokey silly stuff that\nyoga hippies did back in the 60s it had\nno scientific validation and so people\nassumed it was false because it had not\nbeen studied and now like meditation is\nlike they're just gigantic Institute's\nthat are studying the effects of\nmeditation so let's remember let's be\nhumble and not practice scientific\narrogance and remember that just because\nsomething has not been scientifically\ninvestigated does not mean it is false\nso reincarnation is where meditation was\na hundred years ago just because we\ndon't know how to study it and haven't\ntried does not mean it is false which is\none of the biggest mistakes that I see a\nlot of people who are like prosigns and\nanti religion make right it's like we\njust don't we haven't studied it\nappropriately so am I asking you to\nbelieve in it no but it doesn't it's\njust like we haven't studied it yet like\nI don't even know how to study like I\ndon't even know how that works but\nanyway great question okay last question\nwould you say you're enlightened if yes\nat what age did it happened and can you\nget more enlightened what I say I'm\nenlightened know what at what age it\nhasn't happened yet and then can you get\na more lined sort of so there are many\nstages of consciousness that apparently\nlike you can purify so there's like a\nlevel one enlightenment level to\nenlightenment level three enlightenment\nif you read but then Julie's yoga system\nis he talks about some of this stuff I'm\nnot quite sure about all that stuff\nbecause I haven't I haven't experienced\nit and I haven't seen scientific\nevidence of it so I don't really like\nI don't talk about it much so I've\nstudied it and I can talk about it but\nthe things that I tend to rely on are\nthings that are based on my personal\nexperience or clinical experience and\nthat which has scientific validation so\nthere you know there's Samadhi which is\na stage of temporary enlightenment and\nthen there are like other stages of\nenlightenment supposedly after that and\nthen there's the complete enlightenment\nwhich is at the end and I just don't\ntalk about it because I don't really\nunderstand it and I'm not enlightened so\nI think one thing one good example of\nthis is that I do think for example\ndifferent stages of enlightenment or\ndifferent faculties that they describe\nto ascribe to enlightened people do map\non pretty cool with like different parts\nof the brain so I think as we understand\nas people meditate it's not just because\nenlightenment is sort of like a global\nlevel up right it's not like leveling up\none skill it's just like it's like like\nSuper Saiyan form it's like a different\nform of human being where everything is\nboosted and that's what we actually see\nso that's how spirituality and yoga\ndescribes enlightenment or Dao or\nBuddhism and we actually see that in\nscience that as you meditate you get\nyour attention gets better your\nconcentration gets better your memory\ngets better your capacity for empathy\ngets better your narcissism goes down\nyour capacity to delay gratification\ngets better your capacity to for impulse\ncontrol gets better so if we look really\nlook at it scientifically meditation is\nlike a buff to everything which is\naligned with what people actually have\npeople describe enlightenment is like a\nglobal improvement I mean there are very\nfew things in medicine that actually\nhave global improvements right so I mean\nI think that meditation and and\nspirituality and science are like not\nexclusive at all in fact I think that's\nit's the areas that they overlap which\ngives you guidance on both so if there's\na scientific concept you know if there's\na bet if there's a spiritual concept\nwhich has no validation in science then\nlike it's less valuable than the ones\nthat do have ala Dacian science\n[Music]\nokay okay guys thank you guys very much\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap up and I\njust want to thank everyone so I saw we\nhad some gifted subs from"
