    "transcript": "I can be as I could train or study as\nmuch as I want to and like what do I\nknow about your life like I don't know\nanything about your life right but I had\na question about how to keep the\nrelationship flame going I mean I so I\nthink that people need to understand\nthat you don't have to have like a\nparticular problem to go to therapy\nhe can get there and you can to that I\nthink is a very important lesson right\nthat's the final boss when the final\nboss shows up you don't just like say oh\n[ __ ] [ __ ] this I'm done with that so\nthat's [ __ ] twitches problem right is\nthat like half y'all or giver uppers\nthis is the other thing is that a lot of\npeople live their life based on the\nimagined emotions of other people but\nsometimes I feel I can do everything and\nsomeday soon I feel I can't because I\nhave a fear of failure how do I deal\nwith this right it's just not meditation\nto remove yourself from the negative\nit's meditation to remove yourself from\nthe positive too\nuh what about listening to music while\ndoing intent doing brain intensive work\nlike studying coding algorithm questions\nI like to listen to techno while doing\ncoding practice but recently I've\nstarted to experiment with not listening\nto music to see if it will help me focus\nbetter so I think here's the thing so oh\nwow thank you for the the gifted subs\nconfused monkey and keep our scam train\ngoing guys so I think the key thing so\nthis person saying like I listen to\ntechno while I'm doing coding practice\nbut recently I've started to experiment\nwith not listening to music to see if it\nwill help me focus better what do you\nthink um so I think the more most\nimportant thing is that you experiment\nright like the it's not about what I\nthink is right or wrong so like you guys\nhave to understand this okay so people\ncome to the stream and they think that\nthis is about expertise right but it's\nnot like I can be as I could train or\nstudy as much as I want to and like what\ndo I know about your life like I don't\nknow anything about your life right not\ntrue um when it really comes down to it\nit's like you guys should experiment\nwith the stuff that I do like don't take\nwhat I say is gospel like this isn't\nthat's not what we're trying to do here\nlike the goal is to give you guys\noptions for you to experiment and then\nlike figure out what works for you so\nI'm the same way sometimes I like to\nwork while doing music I tend to work\nreally well in some ways some kinds of\ncognitive activity I think go well with\nmusic other kinds of cognitive activity\nI like silence or I work best in silence\nand so you know I think you should\nexperiment for yourself like so when I'm\nwriting some kinds of stuff I like music\nor I like silence when I'm doing other\nkinds of work like if I'm building a\nto-do list I like to do it in silence I\nlisten to something upbeat if I'm\nfeeling low and especially if I'm gonna\ndo something like stream or teach so\nwhen I put on like a stage presence\nand when I sort of need to be in the\nzone I'll like listen to some kind of\nupbeat music I have like a playlist of\nlike stuff like das mala Fitz\nand it sort of depends so I think kind\nof figure out what works for you\nquestion for doctor came yeah now the\ndisclaimers over y'all can y'all can\njust ahead how high my doctor came my\nname is Sabina\nhello Sabina I live in Europe so I watch\nyour streams after they are done airing\ncuz sleep good for you but I had a\nquestion about how to keep the\nrelationship flame going okay I moved to\nGermany for my girlfriend and we are\ntogether now for six months and it's\njust perfect respect trust time to\nourselves going on dates being able to\nchill together at the moment I feel like\nI have the perfect relationship we want\nto move in together after she is done\nwith school the summer do you have any\ntips on how to keep a relationship\nreally good after moving in or generally\nafter being together for long I watch\nall of your streams so if you include\nthe question I would be very grateful\nthanks for helping me procrastinate less\nby the way really helped okay so first\nthing is I don't know if this question\napplies to many other people who are\nwatching right so like how do you keep a\nrelationship good or keep it going is\nprobably going to be confusing for most\nof the people who are watching so and\nyeah sorry I can't help myself so you\nguys know I love y'all right and I\nactually do respect you and I know many\nof you guys are in relationships but\nlet's be clear like I'm envisioning so\njust so you guys know in my mind when I\npicture my viewer I picture myself at\nthe age of 19 like that's who I'm\ntalking to and at that point if you guys\nwant to hear a super cringe story I'll\ntell you guys the most cringe thing that\nI've ever done in terms of asking a girl\nout or actually not even asking a girl\nout I'll tell you guys on Valentine's\nDay so remind me to tell the story most\nmortifying thing I still get emotional\nabout it when I think about it so let's\nsay answer this question though so okay\nso how do you keep things good in a\nrelationship so the first thing to\nunderstand is that you know I'd be\nreally curious how old this person is\nbut the thing to remember is that like\nrelationships are gonna change over time\nand people are gonna change over time so\nif you're trying to preserve what you\nhave now that's not going to work the\nfirst thing to understand right so\npeople are gonna change people are gonna\ngrow so it sounds like you're dating a\nstudent right now and that person soon\nmay not be a student so their life is\ngonna change their pressures are gonna\nchange their stress is gonna change\nthey're gonna be exposed to different\npeople so I think the best way to keep a\nhealthy relationship is to understand\nwhat's happening in your relationship\nand also not try to hold on to it so\ndon't try to hold on to a particular\nthing because understand that people are\ngoing to change over time and that your\nrelationship is going to change over\ntime and that you have to like kind of\nroll with the punches so as as your as\ndemands on each of y'all changes you\nguys grow as people like be really\nproactive about it\nbecause I think what the the reason that\nrelationships fail over time is because\npeople are growing and changing without\nactually talking about it or realizing\nit and then like five years down the\nroad you're like in this situation where\nyou've been engaged for three years and\nneither of y'all is really sure if you\nwant to get married but you have so much\nmomentum you just kind of stay in the\nrelationship he's saying the\nrelationship out of momentum instead of\nlike growing together and then over time\nyou start to resent each other because\nyou're not the person that they used to\nbe they're not you're not the person\nthat you used to be they're not the\nperson they used to be and that's okay\nit's just the more you guys are aware of\nhow you guys change and like if you\nshare that with your partner they can\nkind of you guys can like work through\nit you don't end up in as a situation\nwhere you're like 40 married with a\ncouple of kids and one he wakes up one\nday and it's like I want an open\nrelationship because I want to sleep\nwith other people like that's just if\nyou get to that point without all of the\ndiscussion that's happened then just\nunderstand that like you're kind of like\nit's gonna be really tough at that point\nright so most people wait until\nrelationships are on the verge of like\nhaving real problems before trying to go\nto marriage counseling or things like\nthat which sort of make sense but I\nthink you should be really proactive\nabout understanding how your how your\nrelationship is evolving and as long as\nyou continue to have conversations like\nevery six months or every year about\nokay where are you going where am I\ngoing where are we going what's working\nfor us what isn't do I need to make\ncertain sacrifices for you do you need\nto make certain sacrifices for me so\nlike I had those thankfully\nthose conversations with my wife sort of\nautomatically because after I finished\ncollege she was still in Austin and I\nhad the opportunity to like move to\nBoston to do research and so we kind of\ntalked about what that meant for us and\nlike whether she was gonna come or\nwhether we gonna try a long-distance and\nthen she eventually moved to New York\nbecause her her company got acquired and\nthen we were kind of like long-distance\nin Boston New York and then like that\nwas another conversation like when are\nyou gonna move when are you not gonna\nmove like do we want to be together how\nlong do we want to do this and then she\nwas basically like I'll move if you put\na ring on it and I was like okay so then\nit was kind of up to me and so I put a\nring on it\nand then she moved and we're at not\nreally that happily-ever-after part but\nwe're pretty happy right now so okay\nokay so I think it's reasonable right so\nif you have demands and things that you\nwant in a relationship you should share\nthem with someone demands doesn't sound\nright but okay so so how do I know if I\nshould seek therapy for a specific\nproblem\nI just turned 24 and I haven't had a\ngirlfriend I've been with girls but I\njust can't seem to be able to build a\nrelationship what do you think reckful I\ngot this okay so I really critically\nthinking that answer I just spit out was\nJim spit out dude\nokay so the nice thing about therapy is\nyou you'll have all these thoughts going\nthrough your head back and forth of like\nam i doing the right thing here am i\ndoing the right thing here maybe this is\nbad maybe that's bad but then you'll\njust say all your thoughts and then the\ntherapist old would kind of lead you in\na healthy direction maybe give you a few\noptions still but this is the healthier\none so you could cut out the ones that\naren't healthy so it's like you're\nplaying Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\nthere's ABCD I just thought of this\nanalogy and then you do the 50/50 thing\nthe therapist gives you the 50/50 thing\ninstead of you picking four four options\nand then it's your whole life seem a lot\nsimpler so it sounds like you think this\nperson should go to therapy for this\nyeah yeah I agree so first of all\nreckful beautifully beautiful analogy\nthere and I mean I so I think that\npeople need to understand that you don't\nhave to have like a particular problem\nto\ngo to therapy because part of what\ntherapy is about is like reckful said\nhelping you narrow down like what the\nissues are right so if you're 24 and you\ndon't have a girlfriend is it because\nyou just have had bad locker because you\ndon't leave the house or because you're\nlike so it sounds like you've been with\ngirls and so you date but you may have\nsome other kinds of psychological issues\nkind of going on that prevent you from\ngoing getting into a relationship and\nalso like it could just be that you just\nhaven't met someone that you think is\nworth having a relationship with right\nso I think going to therapy is like a\ngreat idea if you're if there's some if\nthere's some place in your life where do\nyou feel stuck and you're not quite sure\nwhy or how to move forward I think\ntherapy is a great option so I mean I I\nunderstand what you all mean so I think\nthe question is would it have been more\nproductive if he was not on psilocybin\nso first of all we don't know what he\nwas on or what he wasn't done right so\nlet's just be clear about that that we\nperceived something and we can have a\nhypothesis and we can have a pretty good\na high likelihood of I don't know how to\ndo that okay anyway I don't know how to\ndo that but so so we can have a\nhypothesis but then the other thing that\nI want to share with you guys is like so\nbe patient right with yourselves and and\nwith him and that we take we take people\nlike the way that they are on stream and\nthat can mean happy that can mean sad\nthat can mean what I mean unless it\nbecomes like a really problematic but I\nI think the other thing that was so I\nhere's so you could say like I could\nhave gotten upset right I could have\nsaid oh like like he's [ __ ] high like\nit's this is a waste of time he keeps on\ngetting distracted that's really easy to\ndo and there's a good reason you could\ndo that you could sort of say like hey\nif you're not gonna take this seriously\nlike whatever you could do all of that\nstuff but I don't think that's what\nwe're here for right we're here because\nsometimes people show up and they're not\non their a-game and when they're not on\ntheir a-game or he may think he's on his\na game I don't know so you guys decide\nwhat what's a game and what isn't but\nlike that's how you aren't like\nsometimes you're not on your a game and\nlike you should cut yourself some slack\nand like don't give up on yourself or\ndon't give up on someone else for not\nshowing their aching\nyou take people where they are you meet\npeople where they are that's where you\nstart you don't expect them to be what\nthey are not right that's not like help\nis not conditional based upon someone\nbeing where you want them to be or\nsomeone being where they should be like\nyou meet people where they are that's\nthe only way that change happens so do I\nthink it's productive absolutely so I\nthink like we learned an important\nlesson today right which now I'm gonna\nsound arrogant but I hope you guys\neveryone who's judging him for being the\nway that he was that you can be\nproductive if you stick with it that you\nshould not give up because I think that\neveryone would have been fine if I said\nif I cut off the interview after 15\nminutes I said hey this is just not\nworking like everyone would have been\nfine with that right so like put like be\npatient\nit's not about perseverance it's not\nnecessarily about never giving up\nbecause I think you know at some point\nthings are futile but be patient be\npatient with people be patient with\nyourselves most of all and like\nunderstand coz what do you guys do like\nwhen you don't show up with your a-game\nfor yourself in your own life how do you\ntreat yourself you cheat yourself\nterribly you give up on yourself so\neasily you beat the crap out of yourself\nyou're lazy you're stupid you're\nundisciplined not stupid because you\nguys think you're smart right you're\nlazy so don't do that don't give up on\nyourself it can be productive be patient\ngive yourself a chance and despite any\namount of like stuff that's floating\naround in your brain like you can\nactually find a productive something at\nthe end of it if you just stick it\nthrough so I mean I think another\nversion of this question is that like do\nI think the session would have been\ndifferent or arguably more productive\nabsolutely right so if someone's not\ndistracted but like dealing with\ndistraction is like actually really\nimportant so on the other hand like just\nthe fact that you can I mean despite\neverything that was stacked against us\nin terms of emotions ADHD a dude doing\n[ __ ] construction he can get there\nand you can too that I think is a very\nimportant less\nright that's the final boss when the\nfinal boss shows up you don't just like\nsay oh [ __ ] [ __ ] this I'm done when the\nfinal boss shows up you [ __ ] you\nlevel up and you rise to the challenge\nand whether it be construction or\npsilocybin or emotions or trauma or\nwhatever the [ __ ] it is you do what you\nshowed up to do\nthat's what you got to do so don't\n[ __ ] give up okay how do you grow up\nfrom being emotionally neglected for a\nlong time so I think you it takes time\nso the first thing is yes so someone\nsaying i'ma give up er yeah like that so\nthat's [ __ ] twitches problem right is\nthat like half y'all or giver uppers and\nwhen I say half of y'all what I'm\nthinking of once again is my 19 year old\nself I was definitely give up er like I\nwas a giver-upper and be patient with\nyourself because it took me eight years\nfrom being on academic probation to\nstarting med school like eight years\neight years is a long-ass time like long\nlong long time and starting med school\nby the way was ten years ago\nso starting med school is eight years\nafter being a giver-upper\nand then it takes another decade to get\nto where I am today 18 years of my life\nhave been spent on this journey so don't\njudge yourself for [ __ ] around for\ntwo or three like two or three is\nnothing man give yourself time stick it\nthrough to the end so how do you grow up\nfrom being emotionally neglected for a\nlong time so I think it happened slowly\nokay and I think that unfortunately like\nyou can't fix all of the emotional\nneglect yourself I think what you can\nfix is like if you have so emotional\nneglect is going to result in certain\npatterns that affect your current\nrelationships the real solution is to\nnot be emotionally neglected right to\nengage in relationships there's no\nsubstitute for love so if you weren't\nlike appropriately loved what\nyou were growing up like you can't just\nbe a pillar by yourself like human\nbeings need love so you have to engage\nin a relationship where you like a\nhealthy relation to be romantic but it\ncan be like with a mentor or a friend or\neven like you can adopt or have a kid or\nwhatever like you can there are all\nkinds of healthy relationships through\nwhich you can undo emotional neglect the\nreal challenge is that as a result of\nthat emotional neglect you are going to\nexhibit certain behaviors and have\ncertain cognitive biases that are gonna\nmake it hard for you to successfully\nengage in a healthy relationship so your\njob is to understand yourself go to\ntherapy learn to meditate do some yoga\ndo all of the above and notice those\npatterns notice the way that you solve\nsabotage because when you're emotionally\nneglected you're going to sabotage\nrelationships not all the time but like\nthat's what happens for a lot of people\nand then that's really the problem so\nonce you stop the self-sabotage then the\nrelationships will naturally grow\nbecause generally speaking I don't care\nwhat you think about yourself like most\nhuman beings are actually pretty cool\nlike I don't know if you all realize\nthis but like most people are actually\npretty cool and like all you have to do\nis like hang out with someone to sort of\nrealize that most people are pretty cool\nand so if you just give yourself some\ntime and some space like it'll work out\nwell so really work on those behaviors\nand how your emotions influence the\nthings that you do\nokay\nokay so I hate to hurt people how do you\nbreak up with someone you genuinely care\nfor and you're the reason they get hurt\nI hate to hurt people I love how do you\nbreak up with someone you genuinely care\nfor and you're the reason they get hurt\nokay that's an interesting question so I\nmean so I I think your compass should\nnot as bizarre as the sounds whether you\ndo something or don't do something\nshould not necessarily be dictated by\nanother person's feelings that's my\nshort answer right so if I don't like my\njob but I respect my boss and he was\nloyal to me and if I left that would\nhave hurt his feelings it doesn't mean\nthat I should stay in his job right so\nlike I this is gonna sound really\ndangerous so I don't want you guys want\nyou guys to really listen carefully to\nwhat I'm saying so I mean hurt feelings\nare a part of life does that mean that\nyou should go around and be an [ __ ]\nno but that also means that like it's\nnot your responsibility really at the\nend of the day like you can't control\nthe way that someone else feels if the\nrelationship is not working for you I\nthink it's reasonable to end the\nrelationship and do it as\ncompassionately as possible and do your\nentire by in the relationship right so\nlike don't just like be an [ __ ] to\nthem and leave them hanging but let them\nknow but I think honestly I mean if\nyou're in a relationship with someone I\nthink part of your Dharma is to like\ngive that person the opportunity to be\nin a relationship with someone who wants\nto be in a relationship with them and if\nthat involves a little bit of pain along\nthe way I think that's fine I think it's\na far bigger sin to stay in a\nrelationship that you don't want to and\nhave them be in a relationship with\nsomeone who doesn't want to be with them\nlike that's gonna breed way more subtle\nresentment passive-aggressive stuff and\nall kinds of crap that's like incredibly\ntoxic and under the surface so I think\nthat\nyou just got a you know I understand\nthat you hate to hurt people that you\nlove but I think sometimes you have to\ndo things that they may find hurtful\nthis is the other thing is that a lot of\npeople live their life based on the\nimagined emotions of other people just\nthink about this for a second right you\ndon't know what they're actually going\nto experience but the reason that you\nstay in the relationship is because when\nyou imagine their reaction you imagine\nthat hurt and you're actually living\nyour your life based on your imagination\nof someone else's reaction like what the\nactual [ __ ] is that that is no way to\nlive life\nyou are controlled by hypothetical\nemotions in future human beings like so\nwhat's up with that right so this is\nsomething that I work on a fair amount\nthis is part of our curriculum by the\nway that I'm developing because this is\na common thing right so this is a quote\nfrom like a lecture or a class or\nsomething I'm putting out a series of\nlectures that a lot of people live based\non the imagined emotions of others and\nthat's actually how you live your life\non the imagine you live your life based\non hypotheticals so don't do that right\nwe'll explore like how that what that's\nabout and I can talk more about that but\nyou know also understand that like\npeople can be disappointed and be hurt\nand also be happy for you because people\nare multi-dimensional like if you tell\nsomeone hey I just don't think this is\nthe right relationship I love you a lot\nbut I just don't see us together like\nlong-term and I'm sorry like I've been\ntrying to not be in this room\nI've been trying to not do this because\nI care about you so much and I don't\nwant to hurt you\nbut at the same time like I just don't\nthink it's fair to you for me to\nactually say in this relationship out of\nloyalty and I think we should end things\nand then you listen to what they say and\nif they have like really good arguments\nfor you to stay or they want to give it\nanother shot and they want to give it\nthree months and see where it goes like\nyou can have that conversation my point\nis that like that conversation needs to\nbe had\nright so you break up with someone and\nyou you be honest with them because they\ndeserve your honesty they don't deserve\nyour like obfuscation and you hiding\nyour feelings and and if you have some\nif there's some reason that the\nrelationship isn't working out like\nthat's the way you repair it you start\nwith a conversation you want to break up\nwith them for a particular reason right\nbut you that's got to come out in the\nopen because if you have a grievance you\nhave to give them a chance to solve it\nthat's otherwise the relationships not\ngonna work okay how do you deal with\nself-doubt sometimes I feel I can do\neverything and someday soon I feel I\ncan't because I have a fear of failure\nhow do I deal with this okay\nso how do you deal with self-doubt\nsometimes sometimes I feel I can do\neverything and someday soon I feel I\ncan't because I have a fear of failure\nhow do I deal with this okay so there's\nlike a short answer and there's a long\nit so the first is that you actually\nfail is that you just fail right because\nif you fail and if you survive and you\nget used to failure it's kind of like\nreckful right he's actually okay with\nrejection\nhe gets okay handling rejection he's\ngotten good at it just fail and survive\nand then like you fail a couple times\nand you fail a couple more times and you\nfail a couple more times so I had\nsomething like a hundred forty\nrejections from med school before I got\naccepted the first five hurt a lot\nthe next twenty hurt a lot the next ten\nnot so much and then the next year the\nfirst five so like forty forty through\nforty five hurt a lot and then they\nheard a lot and they heard a lot and\nthey heard a lot and then he get used to\nit and then you just keep going so oddly\nI think the the the solution to fear of\nfailure it's like how do you overcome a\nfear of heights or a fear of dogs is\nlike exposure therapy right like you go\nand you hang out with a dog you manage\nyour fear you see that you're alive you\ngo to the Empire State Building and you\nlook down and you feel like oh my god\nthat's so scary and then you look out of\nyour airplane window and things like\nthat you do things in a safe manner but\nyou expose yourself to your fear and you\nbegin to realize that actually just like\nreckful the fear of rejection\nis more dangerous than rejection itself\nand that generally is true like fear of\nthings is actually like worse often\ntimes than the thing itself you know\nobvious caveats like that's not\nblanketly true like I think it I mean\nI'd rather be afraid of cancer than get\ncancer right so like it's not like\nblanketly true but generally speaking\nfear of a thing is worse for us than the\nthing itself fear is absolutely the mind\nkiller right Frank Herbert so the the\nlonger think there's more to this\nquestion though because I want I want to\npoint something out to you guys\nfear of failure and failing is like one\nsolution although that's a potential\nchallenge right because you don't want\nto just run around failing everything\nlike that's not good but I want to point\nsomething else to you guys how can I can\nI copy this okay I'm gonna just which\nthis this is gonna be our last question\nby the way okay so what I want to do is\njust I want to point something out to\nyou guys okay very important not to\nscore\nStreet labs not street lives here we go\n[Music]\nhow do you deal with self-doubt some\ntime we're gonna just add some grammar\nokay\nin punctuation I feel I can do\neverything and someday soon I feel I\ncan't because I have\nso let's start with this so the first\nthing is what is this what's that what\ndo you guys think what does that mean\nyeah colors right it's great right so\npeople are saying fear right so this in\nand of itself is not necessarily true so\nwe can see that this person has a\ncomplex in their mind some scar right a\ncognitive bias that failure is\ninevitable and they have this pattern\nwhere they feel like they're doing\neverything right and it's all going to\ncome crashing down very common pattern\ndo you guys see that\nit's like success 6x success and failure\nthey feel like the failure is inevitable\nso this pattern needs to be dealt with\nbecause this isn't necessarily true like\nyou can just like this this sentence\nright here actually speaks to a lot of\nlike cognitive bias about how this\nperson deals with the world\nthis is their self-doubt the next thing\nis that this this problem is not going\nto be fixed until this portion goes away\nso the pathology here is not that\nfailure is inevitable but that they they\nactually like they don't stay stable\nthey like they have high highs and they\nhave low lows so you feel like you're on\ntop of the world and you're amazing and\neverything is great and then you\neverything crashes and that's because\nlike this feeling is gonna end because\nthat's not how real life is right you\ncan't feel like you're gonna do\neverything like that feeling is gonna\ncome with like the other side of the\ncoin which is like the feeling of\nfailure so interestingly enough what\nthis person needs to do is be a little\nbit more even and what they try to do is\nthey deal with the self cottan\nself-doubt right but if\nyou guys want some real 5head [ __ ] what\nthe question should be is how do I deal\nwith unrealistic overconfidence do you\nguys see that you can't have one without\nthe other\nso in a subtle subtle but important way\nthis is the big problem because I think\nthis is why they've failed because they\nhaven't correctly diagnosed the problem\nbecause they keep on focusing on fear\nand self-doubt\nthey don't actually realize that like\nthis is a problem and this is a problem\nbecause if you have unrealistic\noverconfidence your hopes are gonna be\ndashed right so you have to see that and\nso what this person needs to do is not\nmeditate when they're feeling doubtful\nright so the other thing we're about\nreckful is it's not just meditating\nthrough bad emotions I want you guys to\nunderstand this does anyone understand\nwhy so I don't know if you got caught\nthis but like when he asked me to say\n[ __ ] POG why did I say it does anyone\nunderstand this okay so I think so so\nyou guys for those of you who think that\nI'm trying to distract him from the\nnegative emotions that is partially\nright okay the other reason that I said\nit is that I wanted to teach him to\nbreathe through the highs and the lows\nright it's just not meditation to remove\nyourself from the negative it's\nmeditation to remove yourself from the\npositive - it's finding equilibrium in\nface of the highs and in space of the\nloads because reckful - suffers this\nthing where he gets super excited and\nthen super let down so detachment or\nvital yeah which is the Sun Squidward is\nabout being detached from the good and\ndetached from the bad and so I trained\nmyself for the moment where there's this\nthing called match day what do you\nfigure out where you're gonna do your\nresidency training and I went there and\nI sort of knew I knew I had a pretty\ngood shot of getting into Mass General\nHospital in HM at Harvard Medical\nand I trained myself for that moment and\nI meditated and I said whatever this\npiece of paper says I'm not gonna feel a\nlatent and I'm not gonna feel\ndisappointment both of them are off the\ntable I do not want either one the paper\nsays what it is going to say and that\nwill determine my future so be it I'm\ngonna do the best that I can no matter\nwhat the piece of paper says and then\nyou open the piece of paper and then I\nsaw a Mass General Hospital McLean\nHospital Harvard Medical School I smiled\nyay\nmy wife was overjoyed everyone else was\noverjoyed it was like great so be it so\nbe it tranquility and equilibrium\nthrough the positive and the negative\nbecause if you get disrupted on the on\nthe top end you're gonna face the low\nend tranquility is not just about\navoidance of negative emotions it's\nabout avoidance not I mean it's not\navoidance of negative or positive its\ntranquility in the face of both so you\nshould meditate when you're happy and\nyou should meditate when you're sad you\nshould meditate during all of these\ndifferent times and be able to find that\nplace within yourself it is not just an\navoidance of pain right does that make\nsense so it is being with yourself and\nthis is how you really develop\nconfidence because if you can be\ntranquil within yourself and not be\nbuffeted by the winds of success then\nyou also will not be buffeted by the\nwinds of failure the problem is that\neveryone tries to use meditation is a\ntreatment to avoid negative emotion and\nthey're missing the point is a treatment\nto avoid attachment to all emotion to be\nable to live life in a tranquil state\nand enjoy what comes at you no matter\nwhat comes to be able to face it no\nmatter what comes whether the person\nthat you're trying to talk to is high on\npsilocybin or not high on psilocybin you\nare there for a reason and you do the\nwork that you need to do whether they\nbreak down in 15 minutes and make\ninflate your ego because that's what\neveryone wants to see or they don't\nbreak down in 15 minutes you are there\nto do what you want to do so be tranquil\nwithin yourself meditate in face of the\ngood and the bad and don't just chase\nsuccess and don't try to avoid faith\nfailure both of those things are eat\nbad do the best that you can do what you\nshowed up to do and like just that's the\ngoal and success will come should you\nstrive to accomplish absolutely but\ndon't get caught up in it"
