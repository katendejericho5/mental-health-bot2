    "transcript": "the amount of time that you spent on a\ntangent was greater that so how did you\ndo that did you have a thought just now\noh I need to stop talking about this no\nyou didn't you just stop talking about\nit\nokay so um I even know how am i doing\nyeah you know today's great but yeah I'm\nhappy you're really you're kind of good\ndirection honestly I have a [ __ ] do I do\nthis okay so here we go I like so doctor\ncan't I had an off stream talk two days\nago and I was sober I said I was sober\nbecause I take something that I consider\na medication for depression in most days\nsure but I was sober when we talked and\nI actually I want you to describe it\nwhat was your experience cuz here to\nexperience something clearer than mine\nof the conversation yeah so how much\ncontext do we want to share about the\nconversation because I know there are\nsome things in the conversation I don't\ncare about anything in there is fine for\nme to share so I'll to you well at one\npoint we talked about something where I\nhave to sign an NDA right so we\nshouldn't talk about that okay just that\nyeah right so okay but we didn't I\ndidn't go in-depth so it's fine okay I\njust so I I wanted to just so what was\nmy impression of the conversation no you\ncan actually say anything you want to\nsay about anything in the conversation\nbecause we didn't talk about the part of\nthe NDA because you haven't had you sign\nit yet okay so whatever whatever you're\nsaying so but what was your question\n[ __ ] I forgot that this point okay I\nwant to update the viewers on what\nhappened off stream because they missed\none therapy session that isn't therapy\nit's not therapy right so that's\nactually what we walked about right so\nso I think my impression was we were\ntalking about clarifying what our\nrelationship is yeah and whether this is\ntherapy or this isn't therapy and what\nour options are in terms of how to form\na relationship and I think that you know\nthe last time we talked on stream we had\na conversation about abandonment and\nthen I made a very bold claim because I\ngot emotional as well and I felt like I\nwanted to be there for you so that you\nno longer felt this way and I think\nsometimes what\nhappens amongst people is that they have\ndifferent kinds of complexes and I have\nthem too and one of the things that\nhappens with me is when I see someone\nhurting I want to make them better and\nsometimes I will in that moment\nsay whatever I think they I can to make\nthem feel better but sometimes that's\nirresponsible and I'm not I mean I think\nin a sense it was irresponsible but I\nthink from our perspective we're trying\nto understand you know like what is this\nfor you what is this for me what are we\ndoing on Twitch this is like kind of a\nnew thing and I think a common\nperception is that if you're talking\nabout feelings with someone then that is\ntherapy but I think we can kind of say\nlike so so reckful also shared with me\nthat he had a great conversation for\nseveral hours with poka main am I saying\nthat right now mm-hmm right where he\nalso talked about feelings and things\nlike that but I don't think that I don't\nthink that poka main is your therapist I\ndon't think I'm your therapist I think\nyou can talk to another human being\nabout feelings and you can explore\nthings that are authentic and important\nto yourself and that doesn't necessarily\nmake you a therapist and so we were also\ntalking about the other options in terms\nof like what are we are we like\ncolleagues like that that stream on\nTwitch together we'd sort of talked a\nlittle bit about you know things like\nviewership and stuff like that I raised\nsome concerns about favoritism so I want\nto try to treat people equally and I\njust wanted to kind of acknowledge that\nif one person is coming on stream over\nand over again are we doing a disservice\nto other people which I think you are so\nI think I shouldn't come on stream over\nand over again with you every week yeah\nso I think and and so I think that that\ntoo for me feels like it's closer to a\ndoctor-patient relationship which I\nthink becomes really complicated if\nyou're kind of working with someone week\nafter week you know and I think the\nother thing that we expressed is that\nlike so I want to be rectals friend\nright so but if I'm if I'm your friend\nthen can I be your doctor do I want to\nbe your doctor do I want to be your\nfriend and I think the the reason that\nthis kind of relates to reckful is\nbecause I think reckful has I think he's\na very warm open and caring person and\nalso tangles up\nrelationships with people and it's\nsomething that I actually do too so I\ntend to tangle up relationships with\npeople I tend to not see things in terms\nof black and white and that's the reason\nI sorta like clean sure that's part of\nthe reason I started streaming anyway\nbecause like no no one talks about\nfeeling like you know no therapist or\npsychiatrist has come live on stream to\nlike talk to people about mental health\nor the feelings I or maybe it does\nhappen and I just haven't heard of it\nbut I think that's a little bit\nunorthodox and so we basically had a\nconversation about like what are the\nbounds of our relationship what's\nacceptable what isn't acceptable I don't\nthink I mentioned this to him explicitly\nbut this was kind of running in my mind\nso people forward me this clip forwarded\nme this clip where reckful said that he\nwould pay a million dollars to to see me\ndo psilocybin and we didn't talk about\nthat right right yeah and so I think\nthat's a good example of like you know\nwhat does that mean and like what what's\ngoing on there so like what are you\nlooking for and like so our relationship\ncould get real money real fast right so\nwhen people start and it's not the first\ntime this has happened where people will\noffer me vast sums of money for X Y or Z\nand and that just kind of makes me\nconcerned because like what are we\nreally doing so we just had a\nconversation that was you know since in\nthe spirit of relationships and you know\na couple weeks from Valentine's Day we\nhad a DTR conversation you guys know\nwhat that is\nisn't a DTR what's a DTR DT I'm a sauce\ndefine the relationship right and and so\nI think it's important right because\nlike people like I want to be careful\nabout what we're doing on stream I want\nto be our here to help people but I also\ndon't want to send the wrong message and\nI also don't want to leave people\nhanging and I think at times\nI'll let reckful share sort of what he\nremembered about it but I think at times\nthe conversation did get pretty\nemotional and but that's for him to\nshare yes my piece he was saying that he\nwanted to be there for me for the next\nfew years and then he but but the\nproblem\nthat kind of said it in a flurry flurry\nof emotion I don't know if Larry's good\nword uh while streaming he was getting\nemotional himself he wanted to be there\nfor me so he said it but he hadn't\nactually thought it through and what\nthat entails because he that is not a\nlicensed therapist in Texas and just a\nlot of things you know how you'd have to\nlive in Texas to be my therapist in\nTexas is how it works yeah so we also\ndid talk about you know whether you want\nme to be your actual therapist and what\nthat would entail and the other thing is\nthat bit of research which is important\nto remember is the the research on\npeople on BPD it's two years of someone\nwho's actually a romantic partner so\nit's unclear whether a friend but yeah I\nneed to get in a relationship with a\ngirl for two years and have it actually\nwork out and that might cure my BPD with\nyes and so this is this is what we also\nkind of talked about I don't know if you\nremember but like you know you know it's\nnot about curing and in the relationship\nworking out it's about developing a\ncouple not thinking in these terms yeah\nokay yeah so so exactly so that's what\nwe need to change right so you think\nabout things in terms of working out or\nnot working out I think we had talked\nabout so what's gonna happen is you\nenter relationships is that there are\ngonna be stressful parts and not\nstressful parts and if there is a\nstressful part where you're some scar of\nabandonment gets triggered then you may\nact in a different kind of way and we\ncan talk about that like I'm curious\nabout you know your prior relationships\nand things like that and as that some\nscar activates it causes you to do\nthings that you normally wouldn't do and\nthose are kind of driven by that that\nfear of abandonment process trauma\nunprocessed trauma great way to put it\nright so so some of the trauma of losing\nyour brother one brother and then\nanother brother like you're terrified\nthat like you'll lose someone else and\nso you try to my other brothers still do\nthis means yeah around yeah and and so I\nthink what we need to help you do is\nlike use meditation or psilocybin or\nhowever you want to but to gain\nperspective on those moments and\nessentially ride out those emotions so\nthat you can like not do something that\nnegatively impacts the relationship\nso we need to help my my mind is stuck\non certain things right now yeah tell me\nso I'm stuck on I like to get these\nthings solve they guess I'm I don't like\nto be in detention so much beautiful\nyeah so I'm in the tension of is he\ngonna be my therapist or are we gonna be\nfriends because he said if he's my\ntherapist we can never travel together\nanywhere like it changes how it is so I\nthought was I was thinking I'd be cool\nit'd be cool to go to Japan with with\ndr. K sounds nice yeah feel nice yeah\njust see how he experiences things and\nhave fun I don't know yeah so I\nI really want a friend but you know that\nI I'm thinking longer-term I'll have\nfriends so what I need is a therapist\nmaybe yeah so I think rather than\nresolve that issue reckful I think the\nimportant thing is that you said\nsomething really really beautiful right\nwhich is that you do not like the\ntension it's a big problem in my life\nyeah yeah I don't like the tension every\ntime I'm around a girl I like to just\nhave it resolved right away that okay\nthis is not gonna be anything romantic\nfor sure or it might I just want to get\nit out of the way\nlet's is it okay if we talk about that\nyeah that's a big problem for me in my\nlife sure so so why do you need to get\nit resolved right away let's think about\nthat well okay let me know what don't\nyou like about being an attention I\ndon't know I have to figure it out I've\nnever know so absolutely right so so\nlet's think about this because like\nhere's the thing if she if the girl\ndecides to date you how can how things\nit's really funny that I wanted you to\nfigure yeah I think they're pretty\nlaughing okay I mean I have an answer\nfor you but I'm gonna try to get you\nthere on your own yeah you want to give\nme there yet yeah so so if you are so\nhow comfortable are you if she says yes\ndude there's some problems hold on I'm a\nboomer how the [ __ ] you scroll up into\nwhich I know they changed something\nI can't scroll up it just keep scrolling\ndown what is this and also someone said\nmy mic is too loud press control now\nhere's my mic too loud\ncuz this is important to get fixed right\naway and someone said I'm cutting him\noff too much okay\nyou're cutting me not too much I don't\nthink I'm cutting you off too much okay\nI need to stop reading it okay so I'll\njust close it yeah everything's working\nwas close to a child chat okay I'm good\nhello okay so reckful tell me how\ncomfortable are you if she says yes very\ncomfortable yeah I was really thinking\nthrough how comfortable are you if she\nsays no also comfortable actually\nthere we go right so this is important\nto understand you'd think and the word\nthat I'm using is is important right so\nthere's comfort so why are you\ncomfortable with her saying no is that I\nhave to think about it anymore it's not\nwhat I want to happen it's not my\ndesired result but at least my mind\nisn't in attention I'm just like okay I\ncan write it off as something yeah you\ncan write it off but what she's\nrejecting you right yeah and you're\nsomehow okay with rejection\nyes what life's not my it's not your\ndesired result I completely agree how\nare you with it because it's [ __ ]\nbetter than sitting there and wondering\nall of them that is a griphon right so\nthat we're saying that the tension is\nthe problem but why is rigid outright\nrejection better than then being left\nwondering which I think a lot of people\ncan relate to this but let's just think\nabout it logically it's worse\nyes logically it's worse because I have\nno chance exactly that's what one would\nthink but but actually actually I love\nthis I love this conversation let's\nthink about it absolutely think about it\nthere's no hope if she leaves if she\nsays no right at least like in the\ntension in theory there's hope and one\nwould think that hope is better than\nrejection that's what one would think I\nknow why let's hear it okay cuz then\nyou're going through your days and\nlittle events happen like a certain text\nor like cutting the moat or like you\nstupid things or just like that person\nyou see them if it's a real life thing\nand then you wonder like this means\nsomething did that mean something and it\nclogs up all this mental effort for you\nto be wondering all the time\nand then for it to just be a no actually\nmakes your life easier in all those ways\nbecause you can think about other things\nI completely agree that that is still\nnot there [ __ ] you're there you're\nyou're there so that's what's bad you're\ndefining what's bad about being in the\ntension and how you feel relief when you\nget rejected so I'm not disagreeing\nyou're completely right I think you're\njust missing one thing and the question\nis why in particular reckful are you why\nD why are you afraid of hope in okay\nwith rejection right because that's\nanother way to define this that sounds\n[ __ ] up it does that's me yes [ __ ]\nwhat do you think okay I'm afraid of\nhope and I'm okay that's the tech\nbecause the tension so sure there's like\na mental burden of you wonder if it's\nright I'm afraid of hope but okay with\nrejection\nI'm afraid of hope and okay with is you\ncomfortable with rejection okay okay\nit's a nice word I'm afraid of hope why\ndo you prefer certain failure to\nuncertain success that's another way to\nthink about it right close my eyes and\nthink about it and see why do I prefer\ncertain failure\nnow should I go back in my life of\nreally far many years or should I just\nthink recently wherever you want to go\n[ __ ] I want to do all right why do I\nprefer certain failure to uncertain\nsuccess\noh man it's kind of like when I just\nstopped streaming on Twitch for long\nperiods of time\nmm-hmm and I passed what I was like I\njust wanted to be a streamer as my main\ncareer but I did the whole tension of\nthe numbers going up and down and not\nlike valve your accounts and not knowing\nit was too much so I'd rather just run\naway and closed at all not stream oh so\nI prefer gutter yeah okay that's I did\nthat so you're right well I know you're\nright I don't know why yeah I'm just\nlike I said this though I prefer I\nprefer why am I afraid of hope but okay\nwith rejection\nI'm not tweet that and let's see if\nanybody knows okay can i tweet it sure\nthis is not helpful at all I just I want\nto I want to see what people say yes why\nam I afraid of hope but okay with\nrejection so another way to think about\nit that's how you worded it right why am\nI afraid of hope but okay with rejection\nyeah\nsure so another way to think we did it\nI've treated everyone answer okay so\nanother question is is why are you so\nwhy are you okay with rejection but not\nokay\nwhy are you comfortable with rejection\nbut uncomfortable with conditional love\nright so like unclear love that's the\nother way to think about it okay\nagain why are you okay with rejection\nbut I am okay with it not okay with\nconditional love I'm not okay with\nconditional love right so like like\npossible love does that what conditional\nlove means all right no it's it doesn't\nmean for us so like let's say like\npossible like so let me put it this way\nthe uncertainty possibly getting\nrejected for you is worse than actually\ngetting rejected I can see that this is\na conversation you've had with people a\nlot of times and it's not super\nstimulating for you and that's\ndistracting me so I'm closing my eyes no\nsorry I've just got a call and I need to\nmake sure it's not an emergency okay so\nmaybe my I just assumed a lot of things\nyeah my thought process is better that a\nsecond to [ __ ] got a lot of problems\nokay so let me ask you another question\nokay yeah\nhow much XP do you have how what if we\nhad to say you have different skill\nlevels right like you've gained XP at\nlike being in a relationship being\nrejected and being in the tension how\nmuch XP do you have in each of those\nenvironments Oh a lot of experience\nbeing in a relationship very good I've\nexperienced being single mmm-hmm\nactually more experience being in a\nrelationship though and then\nvery little in attention it's right on\nbelow level I'm bronze at being into\nattention okay if we're using a for some\nreason I like using the League of\nLegends things the bronze silver gold\nyou know but diamond they dead dad and\nStarcraft you yeah so sorrowful also\nokay I'm bronze at being in attention I\nmight be like gold or high silver at big\ninterrelationship I'm not very good and\nI'm man I'm not that good at being\nsingle I'm not really good any of these\nthings okay so but I don't the worst at\nbeing in attention for sure no no so but\nbeing single is not it's being single is\nnot what that what we're talking about\nwe're talking about rejection that's not\nthe same as being single right I'm okay\nwith rejection yeah I'm chilling yes\nbecause you have you have lost about a\nlot reckful absolutely right because you\nhave lost people before and you have\nsurvived yeah I'm fine\nI think so yeah not because I mean so\nthink about that for a second be you've\ngotten used to it right like you've\ngotten used to people leaving yeah and\nyou can handle a [ __ ] okay yeah you're\nright does that make sense so the\ncertain rejection is an area that you\nactually have a lot of experience that's\nit is it's very sad right I'm gonna put\nyou in the headphones okay I want to\nhear you closer okay when it's tangled\nover here okay\nI'm realizing that it's silly for me to\nuntangle this at this time\nokay done now hello yeah so like if you\nthink about it your XP with with\nrejection and losing people is actually\nlike you're super high level later right\nso it hurts there's no question that it\nhurts but your capability to deal with\nit is good actually I'm [ __ ] diamond\nat getting rejected absolutely thanks\nbro but like you started learning that\nat a very young age right you started\nlearning rejection and loss when you\nwere super young and then each time it\nhappens you get you level up a little\nbit and so you become more comfortable\nwith it yeah\nwhat's terrifying is like you don't know\nif people are gonna stay or leave like\nyou can deal with either camp you can be\nin a relationship or you can be rejected\nfrom relationship you can have someone\nsay I never want to see you again and\nit's painful and you but you survive\nbecause you know how to do that because\nyou're actually really resilient and you\nhave like like you know like winning and\nlosing is doable it's it's the hope\nright because this is like you can only\nlike let yourself hope for relationships\nso many times and like each time someone\nends their relationship with you it\nhurts like more and more and more and it\ngets harder and harder and harder to\nlike try to love again you're right\nright so it's like\njust need to know because like the\npossibility like the possibility that\nthey're gonna say yes is just so\nterrifying because the flipside of\nuncertain acceptance is also uncertain\nrejection so the possibility of\nrejection is worse than rejection itself\nmm-hmm it's the not knowing yes right\nand so even now like I like some a girl\na girl told me really recently that or\nshe was telling another girl and she\ntold me that she did this that that I'm\nreally weird in the 10th in that tension\nspot she didn't use the word tension\nbutton and like that I want to just know\nright away that it's not a relationship\nthing she was telling another girl that\nI'm weird like that and other people are\ncomfortable just being hey maybe this\nwill be and maybe this won't yes yeah\nthat is that that's what we have right\nnow she had to do yeah I want to do bill\nto it okay so I'm tempted actually ask\nyou to meditate because I wonder if\nlet's do it in your state of mind this\nwill something maybe something you can\nappreciate if we took our talked about\nthe moment where inhalation becomes\nexhalation before you seen this I talked\nto you about this the moment when\ninhalation becomes inhalation wait wait\nso I'm having one of those waters I know\nthis is weird a moment you know you know\nwhen you're looking at a word for a long\ntime and it starts to look like it isn't\na word I've had that happen before I\nnever had happen your life where I look\nat a word for a long time and I stare at\na word for a long time and you're like\nwait is this actually a word that's how\nyou spell this word you've never had a\nhappen I don't can't believe you never\nhad that up and I mean maybe maybe I\nhave I've I've I've had that experience\nwith things besides words okay but just\nmaybe not with a word okay I don't know\nif I've just stared in elation inhale\nexhale in elation exhalation there well\nyou have inhalation and you have\nexhalation right so close your eyes sit\nup straight yeah and find the moment\nwhere inhalation becomes exhalation\nI'm sitting up straight and I'm finding\nthe moment when inhalation becomes\nexhalation is this straight this is not\nthat straight is it straight enough for\nyou your spine should be straight you\ncan be leaning back that's okay but your\nspine should be straight it is straight\nI think yeah that's the most impotant\nRIE this at home too so we're going and\nthen there's this moment here the\nproblem yeah so funny find the moment so\nthat in the parabola there is a smaller\nparabola right because at the beginning\nof the parabola yeah so zoom in and find\nthe moment okay got it\nI found it okay so you found it so so\nare you finding a point or is it a\nparabola it's a parabola so then then\nhow can you find the moment if it's a\nparabola because a parabola describes\nthe refuge I found the range find the\nmoment because at one point its\ninhalation at one point its exhalation\nright there must be a trap we must we\nmust step back here and discuss this ie\nfinding a range to me is identical to\nfinding a moment because there's we can\nkeep dividing moments into infant s amol\namounts of time forever there's no\neven if you find a moment it's not I\nmean it could be divided further right\nso we're just looking at it as a range\nhow comfortable are you with it being a\nrange and not a moment super comfortable\nsuper comfortable yeah because a moment\na moment is the same thing a moment is a\nrange also a moment is arranged\nyeah sure a moment is arranged okay I\nmean logically yeah no I guess I forget\nit logically just I'm asking about the\nconviction of your belief I'm not trying\nto poke holes in your argument yeah\nmoment is a range between her saying yes\nand her saying no is what between her\nsaying yes and her saying no is tension\nand what is that tension a rain between\ninhalation and exhalation there is what\nand you are you are looking for you\ncannot sit in that range so you must\npractice sitting in the wrench because I\nknow you're capable of it I see but it's\nnot exactly my issue my issue is I know\nthis range exists and I'm uncomfortable\nknowing it's arranged and don't have to\nknow any further so with most people\nmaybe that would be the issue that's not\nmine what's your issue\nwhy are you uncomfortable with the\nuncertainty I don't know and we're still\ntrying to figure it out right so I I\nthink I think it's because you can be\ncomfortable with a range when it comes\nto the breath but you are not\ncomfortable with the range that's what\nthe very definition of the uncertainty\nis you want it to be a moment but I want\nit to be my camera got so bright why\ndoes it auto adjusting like that much\nit's not good I'll just be dark I want\nit to be\nI want to know I'm accepted absolutely\nI completely agree it's simpler than\nthen what yeah I just want to know I\ncomplete so getting rejected then\nbecause you just want to know it's not\nabout being accepted or rejected you\njust want to know because in this\ninstance you are not uncomfortable with\narranged right you're the very\ndefinition if you say I just want to\nknow you want to be squarely in an\ninhalation or squarely an exhalation\nyou're fine with either side of the\nmiddle of the parabola but it's in that\nmiddle area where you are just intensely\nuncomfortable does that make sense\nof course it makes us the problem is\nthat when you become attached to a\nrelationship you cannot see what\notherwise you understand that didn't\nmake sense when I become attached to a\nrelationship I cannot see what life you\notherwise understand so you are\ncompletely comfortable with the idea\nthat there is no inhalation and there is\nno exhalation and that there's something\nin the middle which is the parabola and\nthat if we think about that the parabola\nis like the uncertainty of the breath\nokay does that make sense yes but right\nnow your mind is calm and clear so you\nare able to live in that uncertainty\nwithout it torturing you it's just\nsimple there's nothing to worry about\nthere's no inhalation you're not\nstressed out about it it's just it's a\nparabola and use say that with utmost\nconviction that there is no moment it's\njust a range and you're comfortable with\nthat range yep and range is uncertainty\nright like that's like it's like kind of\nthe same thing with that's what you're\nsaying\nis that you cannot define it it is like\nit's a race not this doesn't mean it's\nuncertain though it's there\nthere's the range absolutely and and\nwhen we think about her saying not\nsaying yes or not saying no there's a\nrandom certainty that's uncertainty she\ncould say yes she could say no because\nthere is a binary answer at the end\nwhereas my breath with the breath there\nreally is something in between when you\nsay Oh an exhale then I encourage you so\nI do not think both of those statements\ncan be true so I'd say zoom into the\nparabola even further and look for the\nbinary answer that's the whole point\nright so the point of the exercises\ndon't find find the moment where\ninhalation becomes exhalation oh I guess\nit's a it's a fun thing to help you zoom\nin on the breath of an anchor right sure\nthat why we do it okay we do it for all\nkinds of reasons that's one right there\nokay I mean I can find the center of the\nparabola it range the range that is in\nthe center of the parabola so zoom in\nfurther then there's another range\nabsolutely and another range in another\nrange in another edge but you know at\nsome point like from this very simple\nlike physiologic standpoint at some\npoint you are not inhaling or inhalation\nbecomes that oh [ __ ] you're right yeah\nyeah yeah right right okay yeah at some\npoint we're doing the other thing yes\nthat's the point like if it vacuums\nearth odd or exactly right at some point\nyou're no longer inhaling in you're\nexhaling I see you smart\nso then there must be a transition and\nyou can detect the range of the\ntransition but this is why you have to\npractice this technique but we can't\nfind we okay then I got counter that we\ncan't find the point right because it's\ntoo small a range of time that if we'd\nhave to go to slow down time to find it\nexactly so this is where if we think\nabout it right so like if we think about\na practice skill when I play Wow\nbattlegrounds my perception of time is\nway too fast watch I was about to say I\ndidn't not stop saying pay but I would\n[ __ ] love dude so funny please I used\nto play warlock and I used to be on the\none hand really bad but also on the\nother hand at times close to being a top\ntop of my server but uh but also really\nbad like nowhere near like someone who's\nactually better battlegrounds I would\nlove to not top of my server what's the\ntop rank okay I mean what the [ __ ]\nyou're talking about\nthey're like echelons right no sorry not\nbattlegrounds in arena arena yeah you\nwere gladiator I know I was gone doulas\nthe one under yeah I was like duelist\nand had an option so I invited I had a I\nhad a claim that was gladiator that\ninvited me to join cuz I thought they\nwere good enough to join their PvP team\nbut I just didn't at the time so I turn\nthem down but I think I could have\nlistened I didn't have the time thing\nthat's that's a cop-out okay maybe you\ndidn't fine with the amount of time you\nhad you weren't good enough to do it\nabsolutely completely agree and may have\nnot never been you at the time you might\nhave not made it either completely agree\nokay so you shouldn't talk like that\nfair enough\nalright yeah there we go but case in\npoint so it's my first that stuff makes\nme want to be your friend and not your\npatient\nyeah so let's okay we have\nto that in a second but let's let's not\nget distracted so my perception of time\nand battlegrounds is way faster than\nyour perception of time sorry but also\nPvP arena all right so it's going fast\nfor me physically it's going so slow\nyeah I'm just like oh my god this games\nI'm just waiting for I've listened to a\nYouTube video of you playing\nbattlegrounds and I was amazed arena\narena arena sorry I was amazed by your\nability to describe what is happening\nand what is gonna happen next\nit felt like it was slow-mo like when I\ngo into PvP arena it's just like I feel\nlike I've I'm being dropped from a\nskyscraper and then before I know it\nlike my fell Hound is dead and all of my\nman has been drained fell hunter yeah\nI'll explain it it's because you just\nget to know all the abilities well you\nalready know you already know this but\nyou get to know all the abilities of\nevery character and their cooldowns so\nyou get to know that there's nothing\nthat can happen to me in the next 10\nseconds because Rogue doesn't have\nkidney shot and he doesn't have vanished\nright now and I cannot be stunned I'm\njust chilling so I'm not in tension\nbecause I know it's guy goes back to the\nother thing\nI just know nothing can happen to me so\nI'm chilling you know and then I think\nbut I know all their abilities of all\nthree and yeah so your ability you learn\nyour ability to process who is using\nwhat abilities on the enemy team\nrequires a slowing down of time that I\ndon't have so I have I can't keep track\nin one second you can track three\nabilities from through IVs whereas I can\ntrack half of one this would annoy me\nactually through add-on so just do it\nfor you but in tournaments at the time\nyou weren't allowed to use that on\nswitch I liked because then everyone was\nhonest fair playing field but we're\nadd-ons are just tracks in the middle of\nyour screen all the abilities other team\nuse and I didn't have any play with any\nof that I had zero add-ons and then the\npeople were basically cheating in my\neyes yeah to have it you know because\nthat you're I mean unless everyone has\nit on then you're cheating so so reckful\nlet me let me just go back to the point\nso I think the issue is you're saying\nthat you have to slow down time and I\ncompletely agree right so you need to\nincrease your resolution to be able to\ndetect the transition of the breath the\nmoment when inhalation becomes\nexhalation okay\nthat comes with practice oh you can do\nit yes are you sure\nyes I like that you took some time to\nanswer maybe more comfortable with your\ncertainty so um I have a question there\nokay so I hear a lot about how\nmeditation will get people into a state\nof mind\n[Music]\nwell you tell me a lot\nno it'll get me\nto a state of mind that where I want to\nbe really and then it'll translate into\nmy day to day walking around life not\njust wall and meditating right mm-hmm\nnow what makes it so when I meditate and\nwhen you meditate we're doing the same\nthing I completely have no sometimes I\nget to the point where I'm not thinking\nat all\nmm-hmm okay and that's where you are how\ndo you go farther than not thinking how\nare you getting somewhere farther\nbecause not thinking is just the first\nstep right so that's kind of like so but\nit's hard to describe because so like\nlet's say that it's dark outside and I\ncan't see anything and I turn on the low\nlight and so when when there's a low\namount of light or the rods in our eyes\nactivate and are sensitive to low light\nwhereas the cones or not so when it's\ndark outside the perception that I learn\nthis the the perception of color is not\nthere even though you can see like\nshapes so think about when it's dark\noutside like you don't see the green of\ntrees they look the same color as the\nbark right which is like gray or brown\nand then as the my god tonight that\nalways sees at all the same color\nhe's color bud but okay I wonder so he's\nprobably red-green color blind or is he\ncompletely colorblind so does that mean\nthat his cones or rods aren't working\nthat is if your dad is called so cones\nperceive color and rods perceive black\nand white\nso his cones of green are not working I\nthink he sees a tree is one color yeah\nso I don't know particularly what's\ngoing on with oh yeah oh man men are\nusually red-green color blind because\nthe the gene for color is on I think\nactually one x chromosome so what is red\nand what does red green mean they can't\nsee red and green that they can't tell\nthe difference between red and green\nwhat yeah you tell them\nin red and green okay yeah I'm uses\ndifferent okay I get it okay that sounds\ncrazy now bill tell difference of red\ngreen goddamn I'll guess some people are\nlike that that's a common one yeah for\nmen red and green are [ __ ] different\nyeah see I feel bad yeah I get it let's\ngo back to your question yeah which was\nwhich was how is something possible\nbeyond shutting off the mind so I would\ndescribe so I'll use an analogy first\nthen I'll kind of give you a simple\nanswer so like if we think about the\nperception of light there's complete\nblindness and then there's low-level\nlight and qualitatively being able to\nsee or not see shapes is different from\nqualitatively being able to see colors\nas the amount of light in the room\nincreases you start to differentiate\ncolor where before between black and\nwhite I mean between darkness and light\nall you could see was shapes you with me\ndarkness and light all I could see was\nshapes I'm trying to follow you but I\nkeep thinking about other things and I'm\nreally not wanting to do that I really\nwant to focus okay while you were\ntalking I was thinking about how it'd be\nnice to get tell but are in a call on\nstream sometime my friend and I'm the\ndesigner I'm a game\nyup and then I was also thinking about\nhow he wouldn't know how to fix my chair\nso I could be more comfortable and then\nthere's construction and then I'm really\nhaving a hard time focusing and I've\nseen I thought f2p and I was thing about\nI wish I could overcome all these\nthoughts and just focus on what you're\ndoing and then I was thinking about how\nyou could probably do that kind of stuff\nbecause you've meditated a lot\nokay good so it's good that you notice\nthe floor you did fonts yeah but did you\nlook you weren't listening at the very\nend sure I was you sure you were I think\nyeah oh okay\nIII just don't just because you involved\nme with the last statement doesn't mean\nI'm gonna treat any of the other that\nstatement is different from any other\nthoughts right those are the thoughts\njust random thoughts some of them\ninvolve me some don't that's fine yeah\nyeah yeah that's not what I was talk\nabout yeah let's keep going okay I'm\n[ __ ] I'm messing us up okay so okay\nthat's what I always thought my see I\nkeep messing us up the [ __ ]\nconstruction dude okay what do I do\nso you can you drown out this\nconstruction noise and can you help me\nmeditate through it and just littéraire\nsaying yeah but if you're if you're\nmeditating you're not listening to what\nI'm saying\nright cuz only meditate meditate now\nmeditate now and then it'll help me\nlearn to focus okay let's go I can focus\nand then I can if you want to focus and\nyou want to calm down an act of mind\nwe're gonna give you a different\ntechnique okay so this is one we've done\nbefore\nit's alternate nostril breathing this I\nthink will calm down your mind okay so\nsit up straight let me see this symbol\nokay okay that's okay you can't be like\nthat it's not for the record for anyone\nwho's confused about not being able to\ndo this the tendons in your hand are not\nall individual forefinger control so\nlike there's one tendon that controls\nlike these two fingers which is why like\nit's hard to not do it's it's just\nbecause your fingers aren't actually\nindividually controlled by the ten comes\nvery sad that this is the farthest I can\ngo I know I get it the tendon yeah I get\nit yeah yeah so so it's it's really\nactually complicated so you have like\nsome tendons that control multiple\nfingers then you have smaller tendons\nthat control individual fingers so it's\nnot like a deficiency it's just how\nwe're wired so yeah\nsit up straight so thumb on the right\nnostril and breathe in through the left\nthumb on the right nostril and breathing\nthrough the left yeah and then switch to\nthe other side block the other nostril\nand breathe out\nI'm blocking it with these two uh-huh\n[ __ ] [ __ ] why is that my\ninitial thought there's somebody is just\njob to do construction on the one above\nme to make it look nice and my thought\nwas this [ __ ] [ __ ] that's not\na good the hut it's not think that yes\noh okay we'll keep going\nokay so rectal I'm really sucking it I'm\nreally terrible I'm sorry let me take a\npiss so I guess the question chat\nbecause we talked about this last time\nis does psilocybin produce the same\neffect as meditation and I think my\ninitial answer to that is that I think\nthat you can have similar experiences of\nconsciousness in terms of D realization\nand depersonalization but it was my\nbelief that a big difference between\npsilocybin in the practice of meditation\nis that meditation also teaches you a\npractice of being able to focus your\nmind and I believe reckful felt like in\nstates of psilocybin he was also able to\nfocus his mind right that he learned the\nsame thing so I'm curious about that I\ndon't know because I've never tried and\nI think that sometimes the mind is\ndistracted right so we have to meet\npeople where they are and if your mind\nis distracted that's okay it's not the\nend of the world\nso a lot of people are asking or want me\nto ask reckful whether he took shrooms\ntoday right well people are asking about\nmy opinion some people are assuming that\nhe did take shrooms I want you guys to\nreally stop and think about what the\npurpose of asking that question is like\nif the answer that question was yes how\nwould you feel about it what emotions\nwould come up because I'm damn sure\nemotions would come up for you guys and\nif the answer was no what would come up\nhow would you feel\ncan anyone does anybody know\nyeah right so like exactly so notice\nthat within yourself and ask yourself\nwhat do I do I stream what are we here\nfor and does it matter at all whether\nreckful is on psilocybin right now or\nnot for what our goal is\nreckful a lot of we don't have to talk\nabout this I'm just sharing with you the\nI don't know how much of that\nconversation you got I heard a little\nbit some speakers uh yeah you reckon oh\nyou know why they are so curious yep\nso supply line why are they so curious I\nthink there's a certain voyeurism to\nwhether you're on shrooms or not so like\nI think people will feel people like\nfeeling right okay so so like I think\nand a lot of times like when you have a\nhypothesis it's very satisfying to feel\nright I just don't think that that\nquestion is relevant at all to like what\nwe're actually doing here what do you\nthink I agree with you\nI was now that especially now that we've\ndone it on and off I think there are\ncertain topics that can be explored\nbetter on so Simon and certain topics\ncan be explored better off because maybe\nI'd actually be uncomfortable or not go\ndeep into a certain topic off of it but\nthen ah but then off off I could also\nyou'd be better at commenting now that\nyou've seen me both ways I think it's a\nlittle different but either way we can\naccomplish a lot yes I do not think we\nwill accomplish the same things yeah I\nthink we can accomplish a lot\nI completely agree and I think it's\nimportant I know so like this is like\nwe're you know we have to take a step\nback and ask ourselves what's more\nimportant do we want to be entertainers\non Twitch or do we actually want to help\npeople because if we weren't able if we\nwant to be entertainers then we go down\nthe road of asking reckful whether he's\non psilocybin or not and then we laugh\nor joke about his ability to be\ndistracted and whatnot and I don't think\nthat that actually serves our purpose at\nall I frankly I don't care I think\neveryone should understand that at times\nmind is distracted whether you on a\nsubstance whether you were emotionally\nupset or anything like that at times\nyour mind does not do the things that\nyou want it to do so in my mind there\nmay be also be people who are tuning in\nbecause they want to see some kind of\nemotional explosion from reckful and\nthey want to see him have an aha moment\nand stuff like that and I I get that\nright that's good that's good twitch\nit's like good streaming and it's fun to\nwatch but I want everyone to understand\nthat like right now reckful I mean I\ndon't think it's good or bad it's just\nat this moment he is noticing with\nhimself that he is distracted and yeah\nat home does not struggle with the same\n[ __ ] thing exactly so I noticed I'm\ngetting distracted a lot and I want to\nfocus and I know that you would be able\nto train me and to focus better yes yes\nso that site it I'm excited to learn how\nto focus better so let's try one more\ntime and if not we'll try a different\nmeditation technique sure let's do it\nyeah so sit up straight I'm over here\nactually try this just use can you do\nthis link your thumb and your ring\nfinger thumb and ring finger yeah not\nnot index finger ring finger thumb and\nring thing oh there yeah that you can do\nokay so now I have a just just so you\nknow because I get uncomfortable about\nit I haven't actual like I'm\nsignificantly below average at certain\ntasks it may be like um I have an 80 IQ\nat like shapes and I don't remember\nexactly the okay there's certain things\nsome certain things I have like 80 IQ\nwith and let's say one of them's like\nshapes and seeing rotations and like I\ncan't my brain can't do that so I'm just\njust these things are take really long\nfor me that I just want you to know\nthat's all okay so let's just talk about\nthat for a second do you feel insecure\nabout lacking that capability I'm not\ninsecure as long as people know no I\njust don't want people to wonder why\nit's taking me so long\nalways with these kind of things I just\nrather they know hey I'm like I'm\nchallenged with okay so did I tell you\nhow I feel about that yeah yeah okay so\njust real quick I can\ncareless the important thing is that we\nmeet you where you are and we get you to\nwhere you need to go if you're impaired\nif you're brilliant if you're cut like\nwe just have to meet you where you are\nno judgement and just get you to where\nwe want you to go yeah we try things and\nI try let me agree okay\nI completely agree just sometimes people\nwhen I'm streaming for eight years I've\nnoticed people are like how the [ __ ] can\nhe not do this like I can't and I'm just\nI always have to feel like I have to\nexplain if I don't have to yeah okay\nlet's go okay so you can so we're gonna\ntry a slightly different method okay so\nI'm gonna do so this is gonna be hard\nfor you to see so I'm gonna do thumb and\nring finger we're gonna go like this\nokay instead of doing this so doing this\nbecause this can be challenging for\nsomething yeah good and so the only\nother thing is I'm gonna raise my hand a\nlittle bit so it's gonna be like you're\nnot gonna be able to see my face but so\nbreathe in\nso thumb over here Bri then ring finger\nto block the other one to breathe out\nbreathe in through the same nostril\nswitch and out in switch out\nin switch-out good now close your eyes\nsit up straight and continue at your own\npace okay keep going no keep going\nand everyone who's watching should do\nthis to only switch on an exhale sweep\nwhich after inhale yeah yeah switch with\na full breath yeah it's a matter of\nwhere we're defining in the beginning\ngood reckful you're learning so i've\ncautious about that sound\nyou\nkeep going you can stop I don't feel\ngood okay really nice yeah\nhow's your mind yeah come I don't know\nif I can focus better yet but I know\nthat I'm very calm although I must\nmention he shut up for a second the\nconstruction can you hear the\nconstruction so he happened to shut up\naround that time shut up his Abed\nworking out and stopped so it helped me\nbe calm but way am I still calm okay if\nthere's construction I'm calm I got this\nokay by the way our long-term is very\ndark now yeah it kept auto adjusting I\nneed a check I need to mess with I don't\nwant it to auto adjust that's perfect\ndown yeah that's right how do you feel\num I I feel I feel hopeful that I can\nlearn to overcome distraction from you\nand that would be amazing for me because\nit's a major problem in my life that's\nall good so I'm I'm wondering do you do\nyou feel like you're talking differently\nthan before mmm-hmm I wouldn't have\nguessed it but now that you mention it\nI'm probably more calm they talking\nabsolutely right so you were saying\nthree or four different things that were\na little bit disconnected and you were\nmoving around from place to place now I\nexpect that to return over time which is\nokay so what was it yes\nthat's sort of part of it yeah okay\nand so help me understand how you would\nlike to spend the remainder of our time\ntoday let's say like we have another 20\nminutes what would I like to do yeah so\nwhat are you cuz we've opened allotted\nokay okay yeah let's let's focus on how\nto focus okay but with active I want to\nuse an active thought method maybe\nthat's not the right way well what do I\nactively think to tell myself to focus\nor do I have to stop thinking so focus\nis not tell about telling yourself\nanything it is about doing something\nwith the attention of your mind so\ntelling yourself something is thoughts\nthis I I'm really doing obviously this\nstuff I'd love for you to explain so\nlet's just start by like if you tell\nyourself something that as a thought yes\nfocusing your mind is not about thoughts\nit's about directing the thinking\nmachine in a particular direction got it\nokay so we're the controller here this\nis us and then we think thoughts okay we\nthink thoughts and then there's a lot of\ndisconnected thoughts happening we need\nto learn to direct this though to just\ngo in just one direction yes but it's\nvery good that you're first of all\nrealizing so like the production of\nthoughts cannot if we're learning to\ndirect to this I've actually okay I read\na book called mind hacking no it's about\nhow can your own mind and it kept\nmentioning that there's this who are we\nare we this thing or if we're able to\nfigure out how to direct this thing then\nworse than something a higher the\nconsciousness okay it's interesting to\nme we'll talk about another time anyway\ngood what did you just do reckful trying\nto direct ourselves back to the\nconversation very good and you weren't\nable to do that about 60 seconds ago\nright it was harder for you I'm not a\nweren't able was harder for you the\namount of time that you spent on a\ntangent was greater that so how did you\ndo that did you have a thought just now\noh I need to stop talking about this no\nyou didn't you just stop talking about\nit\nNo do you see that so that wasn't a\nthought I don't understand it though\nthat's how he was yeah but but you you\ndidn't you under self you didn't\nconvince your son Durst and all this\nyeah that's awesome that's a guess I\nshould have ever heard in my entire life\nI completely agree okay like I think\nit's the coolest [ __ ] ever as well yeah\nso I want people like so like this is\nwhy I loved going to India so like I\nlived my whole life not understanding\nhow the [ __ ] I worked like I don't\nunderstand like when I wake up one day\nwhy do I skip class and when I wake up\nanother day why do I go to class yeah I\nwant to know on some days why do I fall\nasleep it why do I go to bed at 10:00\np.m. like I'm supposed to like a good\nstudent and other days why do I stay up\ntill 4:00 in the morning playing\nWarcraft 3 yes and not even just regular\nwork after me but Warcraft 3 like custom\ngames like UMS like that's not even real\nwar 3 it's like thrashing war 3 no no\nthe custom games a [ __ ] awesome yeah\nyeah but even even I felt like playing\nlike like grinding ladder was like\nactually doing something right like\nplaying costing games is just wasting\nyour [ __ ] time you know what I mean\nno that I don't like how you're thinking\nat all ok anyway I enjoy it I loved it\nright but no just driving ladder being\ndoing that's a toxic thought process I\nthink I used to be on that thought\nprocess what writing a lot it means\nyou're doing something and oh I'm seeing\nthis number get bigger but it's all it's\nall just an abstraction of it you're\nplaying a game to have fun\nif custom games are fun you should be\nplaying those if you need the number to\nbe growing to have fun there's a deeper\nproblem you need to step back from I\ncompletely agree but I absolutely had\nthat deeper problem right where my sense\nof value or self-worth was tied to like\njust like even today you asked me what\nrank was I in PvP right that has found\nits annoying yet the thing is I I\nwouldn't have been able to overcome this\nproblem and I'd still be stuck in the\nloop of wanting to have a higher rating\nif I didn't reach the highest rating yes\nthen there was nowhere else else to go\nit was a point where Blizzard had to\npatch the game so I could go higher\nrated because I hit the cap first 9000\nyou couldn't go higher and they had to\nactually make do up make a patch so\ncould get high rated I completely agree\nI was actually person there this little\nyeah yeah and this goes back to your art\ngallery why would the I'm not trying to\ndo it just to brag I'm trying to say no\nno I'm trying to say that I getting\nthere allowed me to step back and\nrealize oh I don't need to be on this\ngrind for the higher number forever I\nshould just play the game to enjoy it\nit's really difficult\nI completely claim because then you\ndon't end up playing as much if you're\nnot playing for the number to get bigger\nyou don't end up playing as much and\nthen you don't end up being as good and\nmean when you're not as good you can't\nplay with those same teammates who are\nreally fun oh well my team has just\nhappened to be good as well I don't know\nso reckful I'm gonna pause first and ask\nask you to apply what we're talking\nabout to what you're talking about okay\nso when you came to this I'm trying to\nfigure out how to say this without you\ndidn't you understood this first in\nterms of like why the grind is futile\nand not a good investment of your time\nand then you understood the logic of it\nlater right yeah like you came to a\nrealization and then afterward the logic\ngot into place but essentially the\nrealize you're right you're right okay\nso now we get to like this issue of how\ndo we direct attention because it\ndoesn't come from the mind so you\nrealize something without actually using\nyour active thought process the reducing\nit doesn't come from the mind what what\ndo we define where it comes from how is\njust a word so we could have a go to\nwork consciousness simplest word\nconsciousness\nokay so consciousness is the director of\nthe mind and yes and what so I think\nthere are different pieces but I think\ngenerally speaking the mind so the\nconsciousness is the controller of the\nmind consciousness is the controller of\nthe mind but we can be conscious without\nmind when we meditate is what yes right\nyeah okay so when we're conscious\nwithout mind oh the consciousness never\ndirects anything other than the mind\nthough so just as it directs the one\nthing and that thing can sometimes be\noff with the other thing being on yeah I\nmean so you could say that the\nconsciousness can also direct the body\nbecause it's\nour body functions without mental\nthought right so there's directs the\nbody and the mind I've never really\nthought about it like that but I I mean\nI'm I like look about like this is very\ncool right so we have consciousness\nwhich is are actually consciousness\ndoesn't really uh it's true a sense\nconsciousness actually does not direct\nanything all it is is consciousness is\nour capacity for awareness consciousness\nis our capacity for awareness\nconsciousness is where it sounds\nintelligent as [ __ ] but I have to\nunderstand what it means hold on\nconsciousness is our capacity for\nawareness so reckful I'm starting to get\nit I kind of a little bit get it I don't\nokay so so so I want you to rub your\nbeard and just close your eyes and rub\nyour beard for a second and just feel\nthe sensation now you're noticing of the\nsensation is that a thought I didn't\nthink anything but you're still\nexperiencing something right so that is\nconsciousness there's no thinking\nthere's no one analysis can come after\nso you can have thoughts about it like\noh man like this feels raw for this\nfeels soft\nall of those analytical thoughts are of\nthe mind but the actual noticing thing\nis only the consciousness now I here's a\npart where I'm not sure you're right\nokay\nI keep me mentioning on my stream all\nthe time that goes back to the split\nbrain experiment again he goes back to\nthe split brain experiment I could be\nnoticing things without thinking them\nyou'll see what the split brain patients\nthey'll like try to pick out their\narticle of clothing they want to wear\nfor the day and then the other hand will\nknock it out and they'll pick something\nelse it's really yeah insane yeah then\nit could just be that other side of the\nbrain though that is what is noticing\nthat I'm the right side of the brain\ncould be noticing that I'm rubbing my\nbeard\nit doesn't thinking thoughts though\nbrain and mind in consciousness right so\nto a conscious we're abstracting past\nthe brain we're not thinking about the\nbrain no because because consciousness\nand mind are words that we use to\ndescribe the experience of what goes on\nin our head right there has nothing to\ndo with so I have no doubt that there is\na part of a brand alert I'm cocky but\nsorry it's really hard so there's\nabsolutely a part of brain that\nconsciousness comes from and there's\nabsolutely a part of thoughts that\nconsciousness comes from okay\nright we know that because when you\nmeditate we don't know where we I mean\nyou can't figure out what the [ __ ] does\nconsciousness come from that's the hard\nproblem right it's called the hard\nproblem well sort of but like I mean we\nknow that if you take a eg electrodes\nand plug them up to your brain and as\nyou enter a state of meditation that\nstate is distinct from the state of\nmental activity which is distinct from\nthe state of sleep which is distinct\nfrom the state of dreaming right so we\nknow that these are all physical\nrepresentations those are the four\nstates that's it\nI mean dreaming dreaming meditation\ndreaming meditation sleeping and with\nthe normal\nnot consciousness thinking consciousness\nokay thinking thinking is better not\nconsciousness so conscious consciousness\nwithout thought is one so let's just\nthink about this you can have your\nconsciousness active and you can have\nyour mind active or you can have him\nvictim like I thought it again I thought\nthis [ __ ] [ __ ] but it's not\nhe's not a bad person why do I keep\nthinking that what are you talking about\nthe construction there's a guy [ __ ]\ndoing construction above my head yeah\nyeah right\nreckful right now your mind is something\nthat that we call stimulus bound which\nis that generally speaking your mind has\nthe capacity to filter out stimuli that\nare not relevant to what you're doing\nand as you as you become more stimulus\nbound your capacity your minds ability\nyour brain's ability to filter out\nstimuli it does it better when it's\nregular and not irregular though you\ncompletely agree so the stimulus found\nis is attenuating a stimulus so if you\nlike walk into a room you'll notice that\npeople are talking and if you're in that\nroom and there's background chatter your\nbody your brain will acclimatize to that\nstimulus and you'll stop noticing it\nright that's normal that's actually how\nmeditation works by the way so what you\ndo with meditation is that I'll take\nyour headaches but yeah so as you know\nas you put your attention on just one\nthing so you can't empty your mind what\nyou can do is force your mind or try to\ndirect your mind to just notice one\nthing and you can use one thought or one\nsensation to push out everything else\nand then over time your mind acclimatize\n--is to that last thought and then that\ngoes away and then you're left with an\nempty mind got it does that make sense\nso as we we use the\nto knock out all of the other thoughts\nand if we do the practice long enough\neventually we'll even lose track of the\nbreath in the same way that you\nacclimatize to other things and then\nyou're left with nothing but\nconsciousness so getting back to the\noriginal question then how when you're\nmeditating do you go further than just\nnot thinking what is the next step the\nbest way I can describe it or what's\nused as higher levels of consciousness\nright so consciousness is not one thing\nthey're different in the same way that\nmind has different states right so it\nhas anxiety fear excitement a high level\nof activity a slow level of activity\nlike sitting back like enjoying things\nbeing stressed out the mind has a lot of\ndifferent fluctuations and consciousness\nin that way has different levels of\nfluctuations I mean I wouldn't call them\nfluctuations I think they're more teared\nthan just like lateral fluctuations but\nthere are different states of\nconsciousness so ok I know I would think\nthis is complete mumbo-jumbo except that\nI've actually experienced a higher state\nof consciousness so I'd know he's\ntalking about yeah so anyone who hasn't\nexperienced this so this goes back to\nlogic and knowledge right so you had\nthis realization about the wow ladder\nand the grind and stuff like that and\nthen that realization can't come from\nthe mind it actually comes from\nsomewhere else and then your mind\nunderstands that afterward if you think\nabout the breath practice and sorry if\nI'm bouncing around too much but in the\nbreath practice you noticed something\nabout the breath and then you recruited\nyour mind to be able to explain it and\ncome up with the word parabola yes does\nthat make sense so that is consciousness\ndirecting the mind to be like hey I want\nyou to tell me what this is or let's\nthink about this like let's understand\nwhat we already know gross we got to\nfigure this out\nexactly but you already have the answer\ndo i yeah because you but but the it's\nnot it's not the product of logic right\nyou figure it out first and then your\nlogical mind understands it afterward no\nfigure it out first you you feel like\nyou're close to figuring it out you know\nthe conclusion and then yes I mind to\nclarify to make it very good because\nfiguring it out the that verb is more\nmental activity but like you said you\nyou start with the conclusion which like\nis actually kind of mind-blowing [ __ ]\nhim love talking you by the way is so\ncool okay sorry that's okay I appreciate\nthe compliment it's just so for you\nhere's a big disconnect I think for\npeople on Twitch and you see you've\nprobably been talking to people similar\nto you for a long time because you went\nto I didn't go to it you went to a good\nschool and you're talking to colleagues\nor you call them colleagues I don't know\nyou're in tears you're talking to peers\nat a good school all the time\nnow with I went to UT Austin which is\nlike a pretty good school but it's also\nlike you know so oh you weren't here\nyeah okay but we regard I'm regardless I\ndropped out of high school right okay so\nthe only people I'm talking to are all\nsitting at home playing games which is\nfine but [ __ ] what am I trying to say\nit sounds like you're making a\ncomparison of some kind of why is way\nall of us gamers sitting on here on\nTwitch we haven't heard we haven't\ngotten to experience conversations like\nthe ones you have regularly I think okay\nand then it's really nice as soon as I'm\nin it Wow like I'm stimulated my mind is\nstimulated I'm learning and you're\nmaking it fun to learn for me and\nusually it wasn't fun\nwell I'm glad you feel that way I would\nalso be I mean to be honest reckful I\nthink some of the most profound and\nawesome conversations that I've had her\nwith gamers who are going nowhere in\nlife like you know III don't think you\nneed to be at a top-tier institution and\nI firmly believe this like part of the\nreason that I stream on Twitch it's\nfunny so I talk more about what I truly\nbelieve on Twitch then I do at HMS\nbecause I think the people here are more\nopen-minded willing to listen and able\nto learn than people in like a top to\nyour academic institution do you think\nyou've learned anything from us for most\nwhich people taunts really every single\nday man cool you're learning something\nfor me absolutely you're not just saying\nthat\nno okay so reckful think I probably a\nsecond yeah I mean other than I think\nit's something useful other than how to\nuse but you know the technology so\nreckful let's pause for a second how am\nI able to do what I am doing what makes\nme good at this you can relate okay what\ndoes that mean like how does one lot\nthat's not really what it is though I\ndon't [ __ ] know why you're good I\njust know you are it's because you're\nteaching me in this moment I don't I\ndon't believe that I maybe I have low\nself-esteem or something no no you do it\nmaybe you have low self-esteem but\nunderstand so like like this is me\ngetting XP for all of the other\nconversations every response you give me\nhelps me understand like a future\nconversation in a slightly different way\nevery person that I talked to helps me\nunderstand the condition of humanity all\nI think if I weren't me I could believe\nyou yeah and then we got to get to the\nissue of like why you can't believe that\nabout yourself right why do you need\nvalidation why do you talked about right\nso where where despite all of your\namazing successes and being rectal\ngladiator and doing this and doing that\nand\nand all the other stuff that you've done\nsuccessfully why is it that you cannot\nvote is restful gladiator that that's\nthe video that I saw that was six\n[ __ ] old yeah that's mm yeah nine\nmaybe they got taken down from YouTube\nyeah\nso despite all of these things despite\nBlizzard having to patch the game so\nthat you can continue to grow why is it\nthat you can't believe this about\nyourself why is it that you I believe\nI'm good at I was good at that game why\ndo you not have inherent value and\nyourself as a person I would love to\nknow that how long have you felt that\nway my whole life I don't think long as\nI can remember as long as I can remember\ndo you feel like your so you don't feel\nlike you're good enough it's not like\nI'm going in for a test that I need to\nbe good enough for it it's just that I\ndon't I don't feel my value being added\njust situations I feel like if I were\ndead it'd be the same just one guy 7\nbillion people maybe almost 8 now who\nknows I think we're sitting at 7.5 I'm\njust gonna I'm gonna think for a second\nokay\nneed more water - I know what happened\nhere but I didn't understand it right\naway it's drinking almond milk yesterday\ndidn't clean this cup drink water out of\nit and there's some gross looking [ __ ]\nin here I was debating whether I show\nyou guys probably nobody wants to see\nI'll just go clean the cup and drink yes\nso I when you guys say something like\nlow self-esteem that's not a reason\nthat's a sin in them right like I mean\nso not enough meditation is also\nsomething that that's not the reason why\nthat's a solution potentially but it\ndoesn't help us understand like this is\nan issue of diagnosis not of treatment\nso possible right so the easy answer is\nthat this goes back to abandonment and\nhim losing his brother like that's\nsomething that you know us psychiatrists\nand therapists love to come back to is\ndefaulting to the answer of oh that's\nthe cause of all of his problems but I\nthink defaulting to his dad\nI mean his brother is actually like\nintellectually lazy and possibly doing\nhim into service\nso arrogance deep inside it's not the\narrogance that's deep inside so\nunderstand this when you have low\nself-esteem\narrogance isn't deep inside arrogance is\non the outside and the low self-esteem\nis on the inside that's what narcissism\nis right a belief that other people\nshould treat you like you're the best in\nthe world and the belief in yourself\nthat you're the worst in the world\nthat's narcissism arrogance is on the\noutside low self-esteem is on the inside\nso it's not he's not deeply arrogant I\ndon't think so you very I don't know\nwith that if anyone's deeply arrogant\nits me see you're not gonna see it\nso bullied right open rifles chat okay\nit's open okay so I could just not do\nthe construction but then I was thinking\nabout whether it's better to try to deal\nwith a construction you know what I'm\nsaying like to try to get used to it and\novercome what I'm hearing it okay what\ndo you think I crash in awhile I think\nyou should use noise cancelling\nheadphones I think you should be where\nyou are and don't confuse where you are\nwith where you want to go because those\nare very different things and it takes\ntime to get to where you want to go I'm\nconfused where I am right so one day in\ntheory you would be able to do this\nwithout noise cancelling headphones we\ndon't know how bad the construction is\nbut you shouldn't blame yourself for\nwanting to use it I think it's smart\nreckful do you know why everyone in your\nand your chat is talking about [ __ ] wait\neverybody might shut is talking about\n[ __ ] yeah anyway what's Chuck can you\nguys what happened today are you guys\nokay\n[ __ ] mm-hmm anyway let's date nobody I'm\njust what you just did they they're so\nhappy that this happened what's now that\nyou noticed that they were spamming [ __ ]\nthat was the goal that's like they were\ndoing it okay\njust they got you nice\nit'll be the first not the first time\nand not the last I'm just I'm still I'm\njust a sad boomer trying to understand\ntwitch and I think I've discovered I\nthink I've di think I I don't I think\nI've finally decoded pong by the way I\ncan't believe how many times you stutter\ntry to say that's really funny\nabsolutely alright so POG is just\nsomething that you add randomly to the\nend of other things right randomly yeah\nI'm insulted it's like like so now I\nwould say insulted pong doesn't that\nwork yes but that's not random it\ndoesn't work to do it you could so that\nI could say it's not random POG that\nworks too right yeah but okay the thing\nis do you know do you know what being do\nyou know what being me on Twitch feels\nlike it feels like being in AI trying to\npass the Turing test that's funny it's\nlike I'm trying guys don't know that\nTuring test is something to tell if an a\nif something passes the Turing test me I\npass the Turing test it means you can't\ntell it wasn't a human so I'm trying\nreally hard to not be a boomer and I\nthink I can mimic it but I really don't\nunderstand it because at the end of the\nday I'm not human and I'm just an AI so\nthen I would say just an AI POG they\nalways think I'm the one on psilocybin\nthat sentence was crazy right to it yeah\nanyway so let's let's go let's try to\nactually help you a little bit so so you\nhave this belief that you know you don't\nhave Val value I had value right now\nteaching about twitch it's a little bit\nright a little bit sure but I don't\nusually feel like I have much value\num I wonder if it'll change as I do\nbigger things but it's not doesn't seem\nto be so like I've done a lot of things\nin my life now especially now still\nisn't changing that I don't feel like I\nhave value oh the only reason the only\nreason why I'm sad I don't and I no\nlonger consider like jumping off the\nhedge is because I think when I'm sad I\nthink about other people who would be\naffected okay I'm glad that's keeping\nyou going and I want to actually this is\ngonna be in a sense maybe way harder but\nin a sense those people so those people\nI'm adding value yes but I let's forget\nabout all that for a second I was gonna\nsay something that I think was a little\nbit more complicated and harder to\ndigest but I will say this so there is a\ndifference between having value and\nfeeling like you have value yes mm-hmm\nright so do you have value or do you\nfeel like you lack value I know\nlogically that I have value but I don't\nfeel it okay there are times when you\nfeel it right once in a while someone\nwill say man you really like I'll get\nthese even long emails actually like man\nyou really get you a lot recently\njust tell him people tell me I changed\ntheir life in a good way and then uh\nwhile I'm reading it I'll feel valued\nbut then if I got a bunch of them that\nday and they kind of blended together\nthen on the fifth one I read I wouldn't\nfeel value okay so now fine so I want\nyou to just notice that your sense of\nvalue determines on is determined based\nupon your feelings it's dependent on my\nfeelings my sense of value is dependent\non my feelings yes because you're\ntelling me that when you read something\nI think it's dependent on other people's\nfeelings well that's true as well but\nother people so I don't think it's\ndepend on other people's feelings\nprecisely so if we understand how the\nmind works other people's behaviors make\nyou feel a certain way other people's\nbehaviors make me feel a certain way and\nif they're giving me a positive feedback\na lot that I'm having a sense of\nself-worth\nyeah but the feeling is on your end it's\nactually not their feeling it's your\nfeeling okay feeling was the wrong word\nfor it yeah right so so I first of all I\nwant you to stop and think for a moment\nabout whether one should can whether one\nshould base what they know on their\nfeelings whether one should base what\nthey know on their feelings no they\nshould not\nokay so that's the first thing right so\nthere are different sources of knowledge\nthere is the there is something that I'm\ngonna call intuition or realization or\nconsciousness or experience like that's\none bucket of knowledge that's called\nneon so the Sanskrit word is neon G&Y\na.n okay the what word Sanskrit Sanskrit\nyeah so for example reckful can you do\nall that so I just remember Si and SK\nRIT\nSanskrit yes that's in that word so do\nyou know what a strawberry tastes like\nyeah what does it taste like\ncouldn't tell you in words but I know it\nis\nexactly that's neon right so when you\nwhen we're thinking about whether\ngrinding to get to gladiator rank is\nimportant or not important you had a\nrealization one day where you understood\na bunch of stuff you understood some na\nwhat nya n g + y EI n g n yn it's a yawn\nyeah there's like a weird sound you know\nit has like nut that doesn't exist in\nthe English language chat notes or J and\nJ and yn is the other way they they get\nstrands to hit Y yeah I like the G okay\nso yeah yes yeah it's like yin yang yang\nwe bowed Yan Yun but so one source of\nknowledge is neon right so that's like\nexperience realization and sometimes\nyour mind catches up your thoughts catch\nup once you figure something out like\nyou know that you figured it out it\ntakes some time for your mind to catch\nup and be able to explain it or fully\nunderstand it or like break it down into\npieces that the logical mind can\nunderstand another source of of\nknowledge is Vidya so Vidya VI dy a is\ninformation is objective and is\ntransmissible so it's information is\nsubjective and it's transmissible yes\nright so in a text book is full of Vidya\nyou can read a textbook through from\ncover to cover and never understand\nsomething yeah right you can memorize\nwithout understanding\nyeah just shitty videos in there right\nand so the person who has neon can write\na textbook so you can have equals\nmc-squared and understand what that\nmeans and then you can write an entire\ntextbook does that make sense I can have\ne equals mc-squared and our Senate that\nmeans and I get right into our textbook\ndoes that make sense\nNo\nit does not okay so like you know we\nhave physics textbooks\nand physics textbooks are designed\nthrough doing video over and over again\nas you do problems and equations and\nstuff at some point hopefully you get a\nlight bulb when you're studying\nsomething and then you get it it clicks\nI mean once you it clicks you no longer\nneed the textbook in fact if a student\nis struggling to understand it you can\ngo to them and you can explain to them\nin a way that's better than the textbook\nright yes\nso neon is about like understanding the\ncore thing like you can explain this\nconcept of chase 11-ton actually neon is\nthe best neon is completely the best\ncompletely agree our site yeah I always\nfeel like someone asked me what does\nthat taste like like what you did with\nthe strawberry and microphone was so\ngood at describing what something tastes\nlike it was so frustrating cuz you would\nwant me to describe in words what it\ntasted like I'm I don't [ __ ] know I\nknow what it tastes like dude but yeah\ntell you yeah so so now what we need to\ndo so that idea there's I want I want to\ntransfer a neon to someone else you\ncan't I know that be sick so so remember\nI always said in technology Vidya is\nobjective transmissible and\ninformational said you can't I'll figure\nit out 50 years from now I'll make a\ntechnology you'll be like okay you have\nto find so beyond is subjective not\ntransmissible although if you want to\ndevelop a technology go for it I I'm\ninterrupting a reckful dude you guys are\nso mad people think I'm so rude I\ninterrupted all the time it's just how I\ntalk\nshould I not do it wait let's like let's\nsee here his opinion what's your opinion\nI think we should try to finish the\nconversation instead of talking about\nwhether to interrupt or not that's funny\nokay after so right so like we can say\ninterruption POG\nknow before but now we can god and\nthey're telling you the Boomer within me\nis masquerading as whatever it is set to\nit genna's and I'm pretending and I'm\nhoping that no one notices\nno one notices POG you just take a\nrandom ass thing and you just Adam and\nhe said hog at the end it's not random\nonce you're actually good you can't say\nlike I think you could as soon as I say\nit that'll be funny you can't say like\nyou can't say like clock from Santorini\nPOG but wouldn't that be a great but you\ncould that's the great POG clock from\nSantorini Prague is the best part if\nsomething is going to become a meme from\nthis show it is clock from Santorini POG\nright maybe maybe he's right that you\ncan actually take anything I maybe I was\nthinking too deep it like specifics you\nweren't thinking deep enough my friend\nyou're not deep enough\nyou're too shallow baby you gotta go\ndeeper to the essence of POG have neon\nof POG reckful no no oil wait when you\nsay deep here's a question when you say\ndeep sometimes I mean deep into the\nspecifics and then there's a high level\nversion of thinking and there's\nspecifics but that there's depth to the\nspecifics you know what I'm saying yeah\nand there's depth to the big picture\nthere's depth in both right yeah yeah\nanyway so let's go back to or maybe this\nis just a you know we can just call this\naborted fetus what it is but no Yong\nYong yeah so when it comes to you you\nyou don't have me on a value of yourself\nso no amount of convincing will work and\nhas worked okay that hurt but it was\ntrue right so what we need to do for you\nis give you Y on a value of yourself\nbecause once you have me on a value of\nyourself no one can convince you\notherwise every they did that hurt okay\nokay anyway I'm getting distracted I'm\nclosing the chat you guys fun okay okay\nI closed it\nso yeah I don't have the feeling um when\nI eat a strawberry and I could tell you\nwhat it tastes like I can't tell you\nwhat it tastes like but I can I know\nyeah I know it I can remember the taste\nright now I don't have a memory of value\nfor myself in my head it's not memory a\nreal is a memory onion onion so to get\nthis thing out root and stem you must\nhire and I don't believe that I will\never have it of course not\nI mean of course you would believe you\nwould never have it because you've never\nhad it right it's like it's not as\nsimple like it's hard to understand or\nbelieve that you will ever know what a\nstrawberry tastes like I don't have\ntaste buds that so there's another piece\nof this so the first is that we can\ncultivate a practice for you where you\ndevelop a sense of self outside of mind\nand hopefully have a realization of your\ntrue self that's something we can do the\nsecond thing that we can do is\nunderstand if you've had some kind of\nexperience or nyaan or some scar of\nbeing value less weight other people\nfeel a value of themselves what does it\nfeel like the same way I mean like how\nwhat does strawberry taste like it's you\njust know that you have a value yeah so\nand this is complicated but close your\neyes it's kind of it's kind of painful\nto think that I don't have this thing\nyou really have a thing you can feel a\nvalue of yourself you can just taste it\nyou know yeah analogy yeah I don't have\nit here's the thing it doesn't taste\nwhat people think it tastes like that's\nwhat I would say right so people\nbuild up this image of what it feels\nlike but I absolutely have neon of of my\nvalue and the thing is it's not really\nvalue value isn't even the right word\nbut like value is like the closest thing\nin the mind so I want you to close your\neyes I'm not ready\nokay I'm ready what were you feeling\nreckful I don't know I was feeling sad\nthat I don't have any value to myself\nthat is something must be sad about yeah\nand I close my eyes now and do the thing\nthat's okay let's just talk for a second\nif that's okay with you\nI just it's hard for me to just let that\nslide of this you really want me to\nlet's let it slide for another okay so\nclose your eyes I want you to find the\nmoment where inhalation becomes\nexhalation and I want you to try for\nnine breaths and make them as slow as\npossible good\nnotice the feelings as they arise and\nreturn your attention to the breath\nthere's a tsunami of sadness inside you\nand I want you to breathe and notice\nthat in between space you don't have to\npush the tsunami away you can let it\ncome and just breathe\nfind that moment between inhalation and\nexhalation find the parabola\nbe patient with yourself if you have\nfeelings let yourself feel them and then\nreturn to the breath push nothing away\nlet it wash over you let the feelings\narise there you go now you're doing it\nright so continue to find the parabola\nand zoom in a little bit more slow down\ntime for yourself reckful what I'm\nseeing is someone who is sitting in a\nplace where they are meditating and\nlooking for their breath and all around\nthem volcanoes are erupting earthquakes\nare happening lightning is striking and\ntsunamis are happening feel all of those\nthings in five the breath\nit's okay give yourself some time feel\nthem find the breath good eruptions will\ncome let him come it's okay we're here\ntwitch chat is with you I'm with you\nthey are with you they are with you you\nare not alone so return to the breath a\nray of sunshine [ __ ] bug\n[ __ ] puck now return to the breath I'm\njust gonna mention it's very hard not to\nget distracted by Harvard [ __ ] PhD\npsychiatrist saying [ __ ] [ __ ] it's\npretty funny good fine rattling [ __ ] bug\nagain\nsure listen yes listen to the sound of\nmy voice close your eyes close your eyes\nI'm sorry dude I so this dragged it\nagain\nyou gotta close your eyes and listen\n[ __ ] Punk console usually usually um in\nbetween the emotes and the phrase you\nwould put a little [ __ ] hog you know\nthere's like a rooster\nlike that's what we're talking about\nright no there's there's a bit of a\npause to let it be known that don't\nthink about what I'm saying listen [ __ ]\npug okay not [ __ ] pug cuz [ __ ] pod could\nbe one word it's not a [ __ ] pug it's a\n[ __ ] hog okay now return good now return\nto the breath gotcha\nbeautiful so notice notice the parabola\nright there's the inhalation and the\nexhalation the inhalation and the\nexhalation you really like that I use\nthe word parabola are you just using it\nover and over for fun I think it's a\nvery good way of describing with Vidya\nYan that means you understand that that\nmeans you have young\ndude is feeling focus repple eyes closed\ndon't reflect on yon just focus on the\nparabola okay and in the middle of the\nparabola zoom in now this is your three\nmore breaths in the middle of the\nparabola ask yourself if the person that\nis noticing the parabola does that\nperson have value my answer was no\ntwo more breaths okay I think now open\nyour eyes I think it's hard\nsomeone who's attempted suicide to find\nvalue in yourself what did you feel\ndon't presume an answer tell me what you\nfelt I don't feel anything so this is\ngonna sound kind of weird did you find\nvalue in yourself yes or no no no no I\nstopped feeling geez I always feel like\nthings there was erupting like you said\nand then I stopped feeling anything and\nyou were unable to find value in\nyourself correct mm-hmm is that a\nproblem you're telling me it is that I\nknow no I'm not just what how does it\nfeel in that moment to be unable to find\nvalue is that a problem in that moment\ndid you feel distressed no I was okay\nhow is that possible how can you be okay\nwhen you look within yourself and you do\nnot find value because I'm just\nconscious and not thinking so if I'm\nthinking it's not okay but if I'm not\nthinking\nworry about that yes it doesn't mean\nthat you're worthless it doesn't mean\nthat suicide is a good idea it doesn't\nmean that you won't hurt people but at\nits core what you were feeling\ntranscends the concept of value or lack\nof value it is just what is\nconsciousness pure and simple there are\neruptions all around you and there is a\nperson who is meditating on a rock and\nyou can find that person and you cannot\nfind value because value in and of\nitself is of the mind true and you can\nbe peaceful in the absence of value hmm\ntrain yourself to be peaceful in that\nplace and whether you feel value or you\ndon't feel value underneath you will be\ntranquil you don't need value because\nvalue is a feeling it comes and it goes\nit is not gone what you just experienced\nis just a fraction of yon practice this\nevery single [ __ ] day get good at it\nand you will be a changed person find a\nplace of tranquility and stability\namidst everything that is erupting\naround you and you can [ __ ] find it\nso let's say I'm alone\nthat's okay most of my day times I\nreally enjoy the day I wake up it's nice\noutside and I go for a walk and I've\nbeen I've been taking the little\npictures and videos and you know I like\nphotography and just just loving good\nokay and then I come back from my walk\nand I just work on everland for a while\nand I love that too and all the people I\ntalk to you I love them all the\nnighttime roll\naround and people stopped working on the\ngame which is reasonable then I try to\ntransition into a different I mean I\nhave to transition into enjoying\nsomething else that's not walking\noutside and it's sunshine which I like\nor working on ever led which I like and\nthen I don't have anything to do when\nit's night time so I'll message reach\nout to a lot of people to hang out with\nme and I'm really overbearing about it\nI'm just like please hang out with me\nlike I'm so [ __ ] bored like I was\nmessaging Greek my friend just like\nplease [ __ ] hang out the police and\nhe's like I'm really busy like tomorrow\nI have that do something I have to do\nthis I'm sorry like I really love you\nbut I can't right now you know that's\nreasonable what are you saying what I'm\njust like so desperate to hang out I\njust want something to do at nighttime\nit's scary to be there and I'd love to\nbe able to go into my own world like\nthis and be okay with being alone I\ndon't know that I can reach achieve it\nyou know well I beg to differ because\nyou say like this right you can't use\nthat with guidance yeah yeah but but the\npoint is that you're doing it you're not\nsaying you useless believe it myself\nI don't believe myself to buy it alone\nforget it forget it forget about all\nthat the one thing that I want you to\npoint out is before you were talking\nabout hypothetical you were saying I\nwish I could find a place like that I\nwish I could have what you have and it's\nsad to not have it you're saying I wish\nI could be like that I wish I could have\nthat and now you are saying like this\ntrue it's a good stuff very important\nstuff in fact it is the only step oh I'm\ngetting somewhere\nyou're getting everywhere reckful well\nthis\nalready there do you understand what the\nword this means this means right in\nfront of you it means not far away\nthat's true you've just felt it you need\nto cultivate within yourself the\ncapacity to get to the state over and\nover and over again that takes practice\nyes it's why for me to get myself to sit\ndown and just breathe when I'm feeling\noverwhelming loneliness it's just like\nmy brain yes knowing all these thoughts\nare so strong there's just so many but\njust telling me like why are you alone\nand why does no one want to hang out\nwith you all thoughts all thoughts all\nthoughts not consciousness not\nconsciousness right so train yourself to\nbe in consciousness practically go to a\nyoga class do you do yoga\nno but there's actually a yoga class\nimmediately next to me so go to the yoga\nclass and if you want I want to go with\nsomeone I don't want to go by myself\nwell you have a friend okay so start\ngoing with a friend but at some point\nyou got to start going by yourself I\ncan't do it yet okay that's okay so\nyou'll get there

need to relax\nbe patient with yourself be forgiving of\nyourself be compassionate of yourself\nand remember that within you I I really\nhope people watching benefit it also yes\nschool just remembers people makes me\nfeel cool it it's such a shitty thought\nbut it makes me feel cool that I'm\nbenefiting someone else I think which\nare maybe feeling sad about is that\nthat's the way that you you can't see\nvalue for yourself in order for you to\nlike make this worthwhile like it has to\nhelp other people which I'm the one hand\nis noble but you know you're so I just\nwant you to have this
