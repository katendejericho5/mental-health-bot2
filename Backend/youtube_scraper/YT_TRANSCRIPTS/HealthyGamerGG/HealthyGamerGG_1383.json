    "transcript": "so you are actually primed for\nspirituality now because now this is\nwhere blood does so what people think is\nthat spirituality like you know can be\ndone at any time and you have all these\nlike yoga studios where you have people\nwho are not materialistic and feel like\nthey devote themselves to spirituality\nand forget materialism they're missing\nthe point they're also deeply unhappy\nmost of these people the time for\nspirituality is when you've won the\nmaterial game not because you're losing\nthe material\nso welcome back Ethan how are you doing\nman I'm great I'm excited for today I'm\nso wound up to follow up actually okay\nwhat would you like to help me\nunderstand what that means well so I'm\nsure by the way oh thank you well I\nthought this was this is a twitch\nHawaiian shirt it actually let's see if\nI can turn the right way here it's\nalways hard off screen it's like there's\nthe twitch logo hiding on the back it\nwas built for some of the twitch folks\nwent to a conference in Hawaii hmm so\nyears ago they made Hawaiian shirts and\nI got like the last one off the shelf a\nfew years ago cool it seemed more casual\nthan the blue button up look from last\nweek so I went a little more twitch so\nyou think you might yeah\nso you mentioned you're excited about\nsort of picking back up so help me\nunderstand what your week has been like\nand what you're excited about oh\nabsolutely\nso I reflected a lot on what we talked\nabout and I also heard a lot of feedback\nfrom people who watched it they got a\nlot out of it\nbut then what I noticed so I'm excited\nthough to follow up on how to take it\nfurther how did how to take both our\ndiscussion further but also specifically\nmeditation further because I feel a\nlittle bit like I don't know if this was\nsubjectively true from your end but I\nfeel like we talked and had such a great\ntalk and then you're like oh right we\nshould meditate boom here do this by\nwhich okay maybe not your intent but I\ndidn't go that's fun guys what happens\nso I kind of before we got back into\nsort of excavating my interior I wanted\nto learn just a tiny bit more about the\nmeditation practice you recommended okay\nso yeah yeah go for it so my first\nquestion is there's this joke like half\na dozen people have told me which is if\nyou can't find time if you're too busy\nto meditate for 30 minutes you need to\nmeditate for an hour yep\nand so my my week went by with me\nmeaning like oh I'm gonna get back to\nmeditating and actually doing almost\nnothing and so I wondered this can't be\nunusual because you coach bankers\ntwitchchat he's one of us\nah so I know that you you're you also\nwork with like Wall Street folks and I'm\nsure you must have run in before to\npeople who nod to you and it like yeah\nyeah I'll meditate yeah and then like\ndon't yeah what's what's what's your\nrecommended way to break that cycle\nbesides gut up and do it if there is\nanything else yeah so got up and do it I\nthink is never my answer okay so that's\nnot like that's not a real answer like\nif people could got up and do it they\nwould be doing it\nyep so there are other kinds of things\nthat are getting in the way okay so we\ncan talk a little bit about behavioral\nchange and how behavioral change happens\nokay um and we can also talk\nspecifically about meditation so let's\nstart there the first thing is I think\nthe process of learning how to bake\nmeditation into your day is half of what\nyou want from meditation to begin with\nbecause that involves you being\nreflective about like who you are how\nyour mind works how your day works and\nhow all of these things fit together\nwithout you being able to do what you\nwant to right so that's fantastic and I\nthink a lot of the progress that I make\nwith people is in the process of\nfiguring out why they can't find time to\nmeditate okay so that in and of itself\ntells you like you know what are your\npriorities like what do you focus on why\ncan your mind not let go of something\nthat you feel is so vital to do\nsomething that is quote-unquote less\nvital but more important so even in that\nprocess you're gonna have to detach a\nlittle bit you'll gain a lot of the\nbenefits of meditation awesome that\nmakes sense\nso we'll talk about that the other\npractical thing is that I mean so a lot\nof it is just a practical discussion so\nsometimes it's just about sort of\neliciting behavioral change and this is\nkind of like psychology research or even\nlike behavioral economics kind of stuff\nwhere it can be like I work with the\ndifferent people you know the different\npeople I work with we try to find like\nan easy way to fit it into their day\nwhich is almost like problem-solving so\nI'll give you just one example so there\nwas a physician I was working with and\nhe was having trouble finding time to\nmeditate and he actually had an\ninteresting experience happened where he\nwas chanting\nand he had an infant child like a young\nchild and the child one day started\nlaughing at him because he didn't\nunderstand like you know what was\nhappening like that he was just sitting\nthere with his eyes closed and making\nthese funny sounds and the kids started\nlaughing and triggered actually a lot of\nshame for this person sure and so he\nfound it very difficult to meditate at\nhome so we sort of figured out okay like\nso one thing that I recommend is that\nyou find something that you're already\ndoing within your day and you try to\nanchor in so you already have a\npre-existing anchor and you just try to\nadd meditation to it so for this person\nthey would take a jog every morning that\nwas a thirty minute jog and halfway\nthrough their jogging route there was a\npark bench and so what they decided to\ndo is they're gonna jog for thirty like\nyou know they're gonna do their normal\n30 minute route they're gonna stop on\nthe park bench for somewhere between\nfive and 20 minutes and it started with\nfive minutes which you can definitely\nbake it like you can find in a store\nfive minutes yeah and it was sort of\nthat behavioural anchor that they would\nsit there every day on the park bench\nbecause they're gonna be there anyway\nand and kind of meditate for a few\nminutes and then finish their run for\nanother person it was kind of you know\nmeditating on the subway and we sort of\ntaught techniques that they can do like\nat their desk so they would feel fine\nduring the day but when they go into\nwork they would start to feel really\nreally anxious because they were\nconcerned about doing a good job and\nliving up at into expectations they just\nsort of made a kind of a career\ntransition and it was a really great fit\nand they really like liked being there\ntheir bosses really valued them but\nthere were just a little bit concern\nbecause they had a different background\nfor most of their co-workers so for them\nwe actually taught them when they sit\ndown at their desk there's a silent\nmeditation practice that they can do\nthat you know they could do at their\ndesk for five minutes that kind of like\nreset those feelings and then sort of\nstarted the day off right\nso my first thought so my first thought\nis like there's two things that we can\ndo one is sort of a behavioral like\nproblem solving how can we find a time\nin your day that you can try and when\nyou try it you're gonna succeed or\nyou're gonna fail and either one is fine\nyou know and as you fail we explore\nwhat's the nature of your failure why do\nyou fail did you just bite off more than\nyou can chew or use someone who just\nexpects more of you than you're capable\nof\nyou know do you just hold yourself to an\nunreasonably high standard we dig into\nthat and then over time people\neventually start meditating and I'm not\nquite sure how or why so that's one\nthing is we can kind of talk about\nbehaviorally how to do things ii think\nwe could talk about is why is it that\nyou can't find five minutes to meditate\nin terms of what is it that's so\npressing and we kind of can get a little\nbit about your attachments because your\nattachments i suspect to keep you from\nmeditating yeah I think that might be\nmore interesting I think so agree so I\ncan kind of jump to that I did some\nreflecting on what you had said and I\nrealized from our session a week ago\nfrom our discussion a week ago one of my\nissues we didn't get into that I think I\nfeel is driven from some of the\nchildhood issues we talked about is now\nI have the opportunity to do many\npleasurable things right I have friends\nI can travel I can play sports all of\nwhich I enjoy but I get into having a\nfear of missing out in other words it\nwould not be it too many negatives it's\nvery like me to plan a weekend that has\nlike nine activities in it and I\nactually consider it bonus points if I\ncan construct an activity that does like\nthree things at once so like I'm gonna\ngo skiing and I'm gonna meet my friends\nskiing and we're gonna talk on the lifts\nand eat lunch together and I'm like I'm\ngonna manage to pack in hanging out with\nfriends with physical activity with with\nintellectual discussion and for me like\nI run a victory lap if I can cram in\nthree or four value propositions to one\nblock of time okay and so obviously that\nwell maybe not obviously but I think\nthat fear of missing out like oh it's I\nwill overload my schedule they you\nprobably know this thing not having\nenough empathy for your future self I\ncreate a schedule that's like well I\nhave three dinner invitations so I'll\ndrop by the first one for appetizers the\nsecond one for main course and catch the\nlast people for after-dinner drinks\nmy mind doesn't see the problem with\nthat when I'm planning it but then of\ncourse I experienced the problem with\nthat when I'm trying to excuse myself\nfrom the first dinner to get to the\nsecond dinner to get to the third dinner\nokay I may go in a slightly bizarre\ndirection though for it has a high\nchance of just completely missing are\nyou afraid of death terrified I've been\nworking on that my whole life well I\ntalked about that last week that started\nyeah yeah I said I'll refresh your\nmemory really early I said at 5:00 I\nasked my father what happens when you\ndie yeah fear of death I've recently\ncome closer to being okay with it but\nthat has been my life long tap root\nterror okay so let's just understand do\nyou ever do you have a sense of why I\nasked you're saying that I have FOMO and\nthen I asked you are you afraid of death\nyeah I get it I believe I get it\nso explain it to the rest of us um I'm\ntrying to cram in as much life as\npossible and a time as a signal that I'm\nalive and the death like if death is\nnothingness then if I'm doing seven\nthings at once I'm very alive well done\nbeautiful right all right so I I think I\nthink this comes back to I mean you\ncould talk about FOMO and you can talk\nabout all that kind of stuff but that I\nthink is the essence of it Oh guys that\nyou feel and I think if you if you want\nto stop doing this to yourself so this\ncomes from what do you think the emotion\nis or the feeling is that drives you to\npack your weekends full of just high\nvalue proposition social activities fear\nthe emotion is is I mean the root\nemotion is being afraid of not the root\nfear of being afraid of death I said\nlast week was being afraid of life going\non without me of things happening that I\ncouldn't see or participate in so I'm\njust transporting that to daily life\nbecause if there's a dinner of my\nfriends and I'm not going to be there I\nfeel dead to that dinner\nright yeah it's not that conscious yeah\nbut absolutely so so I mean what I'm\ndetecting from you is desperation sure\nright there's like every weekend is\npacked with desperation well I'm not\narguing it there but it's sad yeah so I\nthink it's it's interesting because so\neven this is gonna be challenging\nbecause you're so smart that you can do\nall this like Freudian kind of stuff in\nyour head and you're gonna arrive at\nconclusions for yourself which are valid\nthe challenge is that when you do your\nanalysis you're like missing something\nand what I'm missing from you here is\nthe like the desperation like you are\ndesperate so the way that you need to\nlook at yourself is someone who is like\ndesperate that life is going to end\nokay I know and and we so you have kids\nare you mind if I ask ya I've tits I\nhave a blended family 17 16 14 8 ok so\nwhen you're 17 year old was 2 or 3 and\nyou like dropped them off at daycare or\nwhatever\ndo you remember what their reaction was\nor like let's say you had to go to work\nin the morning they have separate uh\nyeah they cry there you go being\nintellectual yeah I I caught myself\nthough right yeah but what what does\nthat mean like what are they feeling\nabandon absolutely right they're\ndesperate for you they're hungry for you\nyeah and and so this thing like it's not\nI mean sure it's FOMO\nbut there's just hunger for you that\nthere is not enough life to be lived no\nand you've got to try to pack in as much\nlife as you can into every moment which\nsounds so positive to fill your life to\nthe fullest you know and live every\nmoment as if it was your last\nand like that sounds so positive there's\nin fact shelves full of advice books\nthat tell you to do that and that's what\nyou're doing and that's why you're\ntorturing yourself okay because you are\nlistening yummy you're probably one of\nthese self-help junkies totally and and\nso you want to pack life to the fullest\nno no man you got to just chill out\nright you got to understand that like\nthere is no way that you were going to\nexperience\na fraction of what life has to offer\njust not going to happen\nthat's very hard to hear yes it's\nlogically true but sucks yeah so what's\nhard to hear about it let's talk about\nthat that there's cool stuff in life\nwhatever we can redefine cool but\nthere's stuff I won't get to do how does\nthat make you feel\num sad like yeah yeah okay so we're\ngonna so but what emotion are you\nmissing there you're missing one I think\nthere's some anger or frustration very\ngood right so you're so good at\ndetecting the sadness but you push that\nanger away so easily what are you angry\nabout\nI want the world to conform to what I\nwant I want whatever it's a tantrum I\nwant what I want\nyes beautiful it's a tantrum beautiful\nright because here's the thing Ethan\nit's unfair\nit's unjust isn't it I have trouble you\nlike the the two-year-old in me feels\nthat I as an intellectual I have trouble\nsaying well it's unfair that you can't\ndo everything that seems like well duh\nbut yes the two-year-old in me wants to\nthrow my toys and be like dammit I get\nto do everything yes very good\nand now we come to another part of your\nproblem which is the the the adult Ethan\ndoes what to the child Ethan tells him\nto suck it up there you go right you\nwere a big big bully towards yourself\nI've never heard it put that way I might\nhave been called a bully but not towards\nmyself well I mean if other people are\ncalling you a bully where do you think\nyou learned that yeah sure right maybe\nfrom your parents but probably from\nyourself and that's just how I mean so\nwe are making so much progress that I\njust have to stop for a second and just\nlike just sit with this and let me know\nlike what is what's sticking what's not\nsticking well the first thing that super\nstuck was just the connection that my\nwild desire to do everything is driven\nout of the root cause problem of fear of\ndeath so solve the root cause solve the\nrest yeah and the second thing was yeah\nthe the tantrum part like the damn it I\nwant it might you know and the fact that\nI do suppress I have all these\nbehavioral layers over top of the child\nthat says you can feel that but you can\nnever show it because it's not mature\nyes and here's the thing who wins at the\nend of the day the two-year-old or the\nadult always the two-year-old\nyes very good right so the two-year-olds\ngonna get us do yeah it's a dolphin\nit's the elephant and the writer if you\nknow that yes very good yeah so why\ndon't you explain that analogy to other\npeople so the elephant the writer I\nlearned about in a book called switch by\nChip and Dan Heath but the the idea is\nyour intellect is like the writer of an\nelephant and it can like pull on the\nelephant's reins and maybe guide it a\ntiny bit for a short time\nbut your emotions are the elephant in\nthis case the child is the elephant and\nit will wear the rider out and go where\nat once so the only way the rider can\nreally get where it wants to go is to\nhelp the elephant want to go that way\nlike make it emotionally appealing\nbecause that's where all your energy\nsource comes from yeah so I would say in\nin your case what you've got to do is\nalign the two-year-old with the adult\nright you have to instead of bullying\nthe two-year-old because then what\nhappens is that the two-year-old goes\nunder the surface and then starts to\nexert his baleful influence on you and\ncloaks it in positivity cloaks\ndesperation in just pure positivity yeah\nwho can argue that dinner with your\nfriends is a bad thing exactly right who\ncan argue that three or four what you\ncalled social interactions value\npropositions I don't think so but I\nmight have you said you want to get as\nmany value propositions as you can into\none activity yeah like as many sources\nof enjoyment right so so I like to talk\nto people I like to I like to do a bunch\nof things so I try and add them all into\nlike one activity yeah and and so I\nthink you just got to be careful about\nthat because you know that's just I mean\nthat you know that that's not gonna work\nright and the way to do that is not by\nwillfully bullying yourself to not do\nthat so like I think the answer that a\nlot of people are looking for is that\nyou just need to learn how to not do\nthat right just stop it\njust do less just change change your\nbehavior plan less meditate more but\nthat that's not gonna work like if you\nwant to be free of this because be free\nof it if you want it to stop of its own\nvolition that's the goal is not control\nnot willpower but sublimation okay\nremove the root right and that comes to\nfirst of all like you have to let me\njust think about how we can do this so\none way to do it is to a conquer your\nfear of death which can achieve through\nmeditation but you know the other thing\nis is to think a little bit about like\nso usually a fear I mean all human\nbeings to a certain degree have a\nfear of death but in your case I would\nguess that the reason you have FOMO is\nbecause you actually missed out so what\ndid you miss out on yeah so I was\nthinking some I was prompted by someone\nelse to think a little bit about this I\ngrew up on a farm and my parents were\nolder I was the last child the youngest\nmy parents had spent a whole generation\nraising kids my brother was 18 years\nolder than I was and the other kids in\nthe middle\nso by the time they got around to me\nthey were kind of done with it I was\nwhat we call a bonus baby my mom\nfamously said I'm what\nso between living in a rural area with\nno other kids around and my parents kind\nof being ready to move on I mostly had\nto entertain myself like I read tons of\nbooks and I got into I played a lot of\nD&D and I played a lot of video games\nbut they were all solo activities\nbecause I didn't have siblings near my\nage and I didn't really have neighbors\nor neighborhood near my age so in\nthinking about it what I missed out on\nand I also grew up overweight so I\nwasn't like a big sporting outdoors\nperson like I am now so I pretty much\nsat at home and read books and I didn't\nbecause you don't know any different I\ndidn't have a conscious feeling of\nmissing out but between the social and\nthe physical isolation I think I\nprobably did miss out a lot okay so if\nyou oddly enough so that once again\nwe're gonna have to try to like how can\nI say this we're gonna have to try to\ndismantle that because I don't that that\nsounds intellectually beautiful like\nthat sounds like something that we call\nlike a psychoanalytic formulation right\nwhere you sat down and you've studied\nyour life and you come up with this\nbeautiful poetic you know he grew up and\nhis parents were not ready for another\nchild and he's spent in a time by\nhimself that's beautiful and and if this\nwas therapy I would be elated my sense\nis that that has no emotional teeth to\nit because it sounds like your actual\nexperience\nthis is you isn't it I was lonely my\nactual emotional experience is\nloneliness is that how you felt yeah\nwhen when I wanted to do things with\nfriends and that meant convincing my\nparents to drive somewhere and they\nweren't available or frit you know right\nand and how old were you do you remember\na specific instance no I remember like\nevery Friday night I had a couple of\nfriends that I would call their houses\nlike can I come over can you come over\nand I can't pointer like a specific\ninstance but I know that if I got a\nbunch of nose I was disappointed like oh\nanother day alone and again it wasn't\nthat well formulated but I know that\nlike whether or not I got a yes and\nsomebody was coming over was a huge deal\nto me was there a day that you stopped\ncalling uh no I don't think I ever gave\nup hmm but there was a limited set of\npeople I felt close enough to call like\nI didn't have a big circle of friends\nhmm and and were there situations where\npeople said yes and then your parents\ncouldn't like drive you over no because\nI would have always checked that first I\nsee and mmm let me just think for a\nsecond yep stumped him\nit's one way of putting it do you feel\nwhen you were thinking about your day\nnow on the weekends yep here comes i\ngave him time to think and he's loaded\nup he's get you you think i stopped you\nbut it's it's actually the exact\nopposite yeah I know let's dump me\nI see the [ __ ] in the armor and here we\ngo I got it but it was funnier yeah\nabsolutely absolutely and it's funnier\nnow and now you know I'll miss because\nthat'll do you the best entertainment um\nso but here's the thing that I'm trying\nto get a sense of when you plan a day on\nthe weekend yeah and you have that\nfeeling of missing out no does that feel\nlike you the feeling that you had when\nyou were growing up and you reached out\nto friends on a Friday night does it\nfeel the same yeah it feels even worse\nnow like tell me what it feels like now\nyou're planning your weekend so like yep\nit's Thursday right yeah today it's\nFriday yeah so have you already planned\nyour weekend abnormally no not\ncompletely\nokay and that's because of weather\nconditions okay so like when did you\nstart planning your weekend early this\nweek yeah so get to it huh what you\ndon't get to it no I love my job but I'm\njust a planner um okay\nrevealing like I say without irony or\nany joke that I know what I think I'm\ngoing to be doing I have a google\ncalendar that shows\nwhat I'll be doing every weekend now\nthrough November okay not in varying\ndetail but like I keep a rolling plan of\nyeah travel and gatherings and and when\nyou're kind of putting together your\nweekend mm-hmm what is it\nwhat what are you feeling excitement\nabout some of the stuff I'll do but also\nlike what are the trade offs of stuff I\ncan't do so I feel disappointment or\nstress about things I can't do what do\nyou mean by stressed what is that what\ndoes that mean\nwell I could just be super practical I\nlike to ski and I have two sets of\nfriends who are going to ski at\ndifferent ski resorts this weekend and I\ncan't be with both sets of friends in\nboth places and I want to and how does\nit make you feel to not be able to be\nwith them like I'm missing something I'm\ndoing for a deeper feeling hold on uh I\nfeel like a failure actually like\nsomehow I that somehow if I were smarter\nor more clever I could have made it all\nwork\nwhat are you failing at\ngetting as much as I possibly can\nfilling the hole like feeling like I\nhave had it all I've eaten the cake and\nI still have the cake and I get to talk\nabout the cake it's like an avarice for\nexperience or life yeah right a Hunger\nthe hunger isn't being met yeah and and\nwhen have you felt that hunger when did\nthat hunger start within you ah I can't\neven remember I don't know I can't put I\ncan't immediately put it like that\nstarted it's grown on my life because my\nability to do things is grown and so you\nget it you have more consciousness of it\nI don't know I mean I I point again to\nthat event I described last week of like\nthe feeling the black hole and inside\nmyself as a five-year-old of oh wow when\nI die I won't be able to do any of these\nthings yes my fear of death was about\nnot being able to do stuff with people\nokay it was about not existing\nit wasn't about like oh death will be\npainful or death is metaphysical it\nwould be lack of ability to interact so\nI want to point something out to you\nokay so the first is that despite your\nability to eat more and more and more\nwhat happens to the hunger gets worse so\nhow does that work\nperverse well yeah but what like what\ndoes that mean you adapt to it it in\nother words what satisfied before no\nlonger satisfies you you ratchet up your\ndesires because you become accustom you\nbecome accustomed to whatever you were\ndoing okay\nso I'll put it a slightly different way\nso what happens so it's almost like the\nmore that you feed the hunger the hunger\nis like an organism within your mind\nthat\nnow then does what with food\neet's it makes it what happens yeah and\nthen you shake it out the things that\nyou feed they grow absolutely right so\nlike it's strange because you'd think\nthat if you have a black hole within you\nif you have hunger or desperation for\nsomething and you satisfy that desire\nthat that desire should be satisfied but\nwhat you're actually what you've been\ndoing your entire life through the\npursuit of positivity and and packing in\nvalue propositions and making every\nounce of life you're squeezing the juice\nout of every ounce of life right for\nkids successful career lots of friends\npacked social calendar more social\nevents your life is just so full of\neverything but not full enough it's\nnever gonna be full enough okay because\nthe more you feed it the more it what\ngross absolutely\nI passed the quiz you passed the quiz\nbecause now we have to try to understand\nwhy you make jokes and what that means\nright cuz you weren't making jokes last\nweek you're making jokes this week okay\nso I'm not quite sure what that means\nbut usually it's a sign of some kind of\ndefensive nasaw\ndo I feel defensive no if it's any kind\nof defensive 'no sits embarrassment yep\nit's embarrassment you know to sit and\nsay oh yeah poor me I do all these great\nthings and ice it's not enough and I\nhave problems with wanting more yeah\nwell I'm glad you're able to see it yeah\nright so what are you doing to yourself\nthere that's me telling the two-year-old\nwho feels embarrassed to put up with it\nor get over it\nright I don't know if it's quite the\ntwo-year-old but I definitely think\nthere is someone within you who's doing\nsome bullying okay right so I think\nyou're bullying multiple children within\nyourself Wow by the way my Chad just\ntotally glommed on to the the bullying\nthe two-year-old they're like all about\nit my channel like newsflash Amazon VP\nbully's two-year-old okay footage at 11\nbut anyways it's okay it's good yeah I\nmean I but I think this is what we do to\nourselves so one thing is is do you feel\nI see this a lot so do you feel guilty\nfor having so much and being so\nunsatisfied totally yeah\nyes I I I feel like I've been incredibly\nlucky in my life and so I think a lot\nabout the I'm a Christian so I think a\nlot about the Christian responsibility\nof that right the to whom much has been\ngiven from him much will be required so\nit's another performance standard to hit\nand I certainly think about it\nwhat was the question I asked you you\nasked me I don't know you asked me um do\nyou feel guilty for a lot yeah do I feel\nguilty for having a lot so there are a\ncouple of things that I want to just\npoint out so the first is that I think a\nlot of people in our chat hope to one\nday be in your shoes in a lot of\ndifferent ways right yeah I think they\nhope to be married they hope to be\nprofessionally successful they hope to\nhave go skiing with friends they hope to\nhave families they hope to be lose\nweight they hope to you know that they\nthey actually it's bizarre they long for\nthat part of you that bullies yourself\ninto success they crave that I feel like\nif I could give them one thing that they\ncould sign up for it's they wish they\ncould beat the [ __ ] out of themselves to\nget themselves out of there their room\nand away from the computer and out of\nbed they long to be like these people\nwho are disciplined and who can wake up\nevery day and work and go to work and\ndrive themselves they're looking for to\nbe driven which I certainly am and and\nthey long for that right so the first\nthing that I want everyone to pay\nattention to is that this guy he has a\nlot of reasons to be happy in life and I\nthink there are parts of him that are\nvery happy but also deeply deeply\nunsatisfying true right and and so this\ngoes back to this core idea that would\ntalked a lot about which is that\nsatisfaction contentment don't come from\nthe outside they come from within and\nthat I know gets put up on calendars and\nstuff like that and like everyone's like\noh like peace and contentment come from\nwithin man but like it's not like that\nit's like scientific we have a test case\nhere of a guy who has gotten more and\nmore and more in life and it's never\nenough it's never enough right you can\nhave two people who want to go skiing\nwith you there used to be a time where\nyou would call and no one would say yes\nI can hang out with you or I want to\nhang out with you and you would think\nthat that kid would be satisfied if he\ncould get one person to say yes I want\nto hang out with\nin 30 or 40 years later your challenge\nhas become the completely different\nthing of what it was when you were a\nchild you didn't have enough attention\nfrom your parents you didn't have enough\nattention from your friends and you were\nplaying well D&D is a group thing but\nyou were reading a lot of books and\nplaying a lot of video games now you\nhave a family that I presume loves you a\nlot\nmm-hmm no you were loved you know\nsuspected you were feared and people\nlonged for your company and still it\nisn't enough Wow harsh but fair right\nyeah and and that too I'm just kind of\nyou know thinking about what you're\nsaying about the culture of Amazon\nyou're a great fit for Amazon because\nthey don't be good and great and\nexceptional and an Amazon you're still\nnot enough yep right when they say high\nstandards relentlessly so you know and\nand so if you hit a home run their next\nquestion is it's there's no victory lap\nor maybe there's a victory lap I don't\nknow I mean I don't know but their next\nquestion is when's the next one hitting\na single good job next time hit a double\nhit a double good job\nnext time hit a triple hit a triple good\njob next time it's a home run hit one\nhome run next time you need another home\nrun and then it's three home runs in a\nrow in four home runs in a row and\nthat's what you do to yourself it's same\nthing so I think you're a great fit I\nthink it's it's good in terms of you\nknow performance like because you've\nsucceeded yes\nand Amazon clearly has is successful I\nthink it's you know it's gigantic and\nsuccessful so we can't dispute that but\nthey're suffering with it and in your\ncase I think you've got to learn so\nfirst thing to understand is that you\ncan feed the beast as much as you want\nto but the more you feed it the more it\ngrows and the hungrier it gets that's\nincredibly valuable right I will\nremember that and yeah second thing is\nI'm going to share with you sort of a\ncore like basically the same thing but\nin Inwood this sort of metaphysics\nthere's like earth there's something\nlike heaven in there's\nthing like hell but they have this layer\nbetween earth and hell called the realm\nof hungry ghosts I've heard of this I\ndon't know much about it and it's it's\nnot quite hell but it's basically a\nrealm where souls who are hungry go and\nthough they eat and they eat and they\neat they never feel full and they don't\nquite call that hell but it's kind of\nlike hell ish right it sounds pretty bad\nyeah and so it's just a kind of a\nnever-ending hunger and and that's what\nwe we see in you so I think that\nsomewhere in here when it comes to\nmeditation so now we're going to talk\nabout meditation so I think you need to\nyou need to learn to be comfortable with\ndeath okay and the way that you're gonna\nlearn to be comfortable with death is\nthere some so I think that's gonna carry\na lot of things right so the first is\nthat you have the sense that time is\nrunning out and you haven't accomplished\nenough you haven't gone see enough times\nyou haven't done this enough you haven't\ndone this enough like dude if you do not\nget this in order every year that goes\nby you were gonna get more and more\ndesperate and more and more screwed\nbecause this age I see that's toll and\nthe end of the movie is coming up it's\njust gonna get more and more terrifying\nso now is your time to do this and now\nyou're ready so this is the other thing\nabout wouldthe so you know Buddha\nstarted his spiritual journey out of\ndesperation as well like I don't know if\nyou kind of know this but I'll share the\nstory with you so like you know Buddha\nwas a prince and he was powerful and he\nwas respected and he was loved he was\nmarried he had a healthy young son he\nhad everything in the world and then he\nwoke up one day and he's like it's not\nenough for I want more he and\ndesperation and that's why he turned to\nspirituality so I think this is a subtle\nchallenge but most of the people who are\nwatching I don't think are as successful\nas you are to be blunt and I'm place no\nvalue judgment on they're also a lot\nyounger so we were going to be but they\nhave this idea that if they can have all\nof the things that you have they'll one\nday be happy the source for their\nhappiness is because something is\nmissing in their life and they think\nthat if I have a job or if I have a\nfamily or if I have this and if I have\nmoney and if I have this and if I have\nthis then I will be happy right it's\nsame as when you were a kid and you said\nfive someone to hang out with on the\nweekend I will be happy and I want\neveryone to understand this it's not\ngonna work like it's just not gonna work\nand you guys can see it when you when\nyou look at Ethan that it's not working\nlike sure he has all those things I\nthink you should pursue all those things\nI think you should strive to be\nsuccessful but it's not gonna make you\nhappy\nso you are actually primed for\nspirituality now because now this is\nwhere blood does so what people think is\nthat spirituality like you know can be\ndone at any time and you have all these\nlike yoga studios where you have people\nwho are not materialistic and feel like\nthey devote themselves to spirituality\nand forget materialism they're missing\nthe point they're also deeply unhappy\nmost of these people the time for\nspirituality is when you've won the\nmaterial game not because you're losing\nthe material game and because once you\nget to the point where you're at you're\nactually screwed because other people\ncan chase after a material goal and they\ncan believe that that material goal is\ncan bring them happiness and that is\nenough to pull them in the right\ndirection of growth in your case you've\nachieved that and now you've got nothing\nleft to pull you right and so you're\nscrewed\nand Buddha was screwed too because he\nachieved right he had everything and\nthen he wakes up one day and he's\nunhappy and so you don't even have the\nillusion of happiness from a material\nthing to like Drive you forward and this\nis why you need spirituality\nspirituality is not born of positivity\nit's born of abject desperation and\nterror okay so you're ready for it buddy\nso now you're ready to meditate because\nthe only thing that is going to give you\npeace the only thing that is going to\nsatisfy that hunger within you is going\nto be meditation and that's hyperbole\nthere could be other things spirituality\nis maybe a better way to put it so you\ncan find your own path that doesn't have\nto be meditation and in your case what I\nthink you need is shoonya meditations\nkurosu shunya is the Sanskrit word for\nvoid it is also the concept of zero okay\nso people sort of claim I don't know\nwhat's true or isn't true that the you\nknow the the concept the numerical\nconcept of zero was discovered in India\nand and that like you know it's my\nbelief that the people who sort of\ndiscover this mathematical concept\nI'm sure when Maeby was discovered\nelsewhere that you know the historian\nwithin me wonders about things like that\nbut basically like this sense of like\nnothingness and void in a complete\nabsence of self and I think for you to\nbe able to be comfortable with death you\nwere afraid of nothingness right you\nwere afraid of this thing that is\nincapable of experience because you\nbelieve that experience is what leads to\nhappiness like doing something out there\nis what leads to contentment it's when\nyou call you pick up the phone and you\ncall someone to say yes I am coming over\nthat you feel happy and so you're not\nwrong and thinking that that's just the\nway that your life has been no so in\nyour case what we need to do is give you\nan experience of death give you an\nexperience of shoonya and the more that\nyou can experience that I'm not asking\nyou to just to be very clear and for\nmedical legal reason I'm not asking you\nto die I'm so clear don't do that I will\nassert back I'm clear on that what I\nmean is that you need to have an\nexperience of self that is not even okay\nwe need to have an experience of like\nvoid and blankness and a lack of\nexistence of who you are and I believe\nyou will find that experience to be\nincredibly comforting because there is\nnothing as comforting as like wrapping\nyourself in the void and I'm not asking\npeople to commit suicide like don't do\nthat so you don't have to die to\nactually have that experience I actually\ndon't know what happens after death but\nwhat I do know is from a psychological\nperspective there is something called\nannihilation of the ego which is where\nyou have an experience of self that is\noutside of who you identify as and those\nmeditation practices are shooting your\nmeditation and unfortunately there is\ngoing to be a series of things that I\nhave to teach you before you do showing\nyour meditation okay so the sooner your\nmeditation practice that I'm going to\ntell you and this by the way so I have\nto do a couple of medical legal things\nhere too so there are cases of\nmeditation induced psychosis so\nmeditation is not a practice that is\nnot without risks and the especially\nshoonya meditation practices are\ndifferent so there is an issue in your\nmeditation practice that I'm willing to\nteach you but I'm not gonna teach you on\nstream because I don't want people at\nhome to do okay it could be dangerous it\nneeds to be done under the guidance of\nsomeone who knows what it what it is and\nit could be kind of it's funny someone\nasked at the beginning of the stream I\njust saw a question in chat about like\nsometimes when I feel when I start to\nmeditate\nI feel like this vast emptiness and it\nterrifies me and then like I get scared\nand I stop meditating absolutely this\nperson is doing it right it just needs\nto be done with guidance\nso the first a part of meditation that\nI'm gonna teach you is through cuca or\nfixed-point gazing and this you can do\nat home okay we'll kind of get to the\nyou know once you learn how to do this\nso fixed-point gazing is simply that\nthat you gaze at a particular thing\nwithout blinking for an extended period\nof time and I think a good thing to\nstart with as a candle so gleich candle\ngazing is a good practice I've just not\nfigured out how to\nhow to teach this over the internet\nbecause oftentimes it requires a candle\nI think looking at a real candle works\nso instead what we're gonna try to do is\njust we're just gonna try to do the\nfixed-point gazing part I'll explain\nwhat you guys should do at home with a\ncandle but the idea is to just gaze at a\ncandle flame for an extended period of\ntime without blinking but I guess what\nwe can try is to soulfully gaze into\neach other's eyes without blinking\nalright so so I'm gonna just kind of\nwe're gonna close your eyes for a second\nEthan okay and do you have actually do\nyou have a source of soft light anywhere\naround you uh sure I mean I have I have\nmy streaming light up here that's gonna\nbe too bright too bright then no okay so\nwe're you just gonna try this I I don't\nknow how this is gonna work but we'll\njoin so what are we can just look at I\nwant you to look at this point on my\nface okay and I'm gonna look at that\npoint on your face so that was your eyes\nokay and I want you to just first feel\nwhat your eyes feel like sort of feel\nthe wetness feel the comfort of having\nyour eyes closed and now what I want you\nto do is slowly open your eyes to kind\nof like half lit at gaze and what I'm\ngonna do is turn off your streaming\nlight actually is it gonna be completely\ndark in there without your streaming\nlight completely dark okay good this is\nbetter okay so now what I want you to do\nis to look so so close your eyes and\nthen slowly open them and go to half\nlidded gaze and stare at this point and\nwhat we're gonna do you can open a\nlittle bit more so what we're gonna do\noh discord here we go chat something\njust did we\nokay your internet connection is\nunstable are we still alive broke the\ninternet internet doesn't want us to do\nit that's alright it came back okay so\njust gaze over here mm-hmm and then just\ntry not to blink so the first thing that\nyou're gonna feel I'm gonna walk you\nthrough some sensations okay the first\nthing that you're gonna feel is some\ndegree of itching or burning mm-hmm and\nit can help to squint a little bit if\nyou need to and then try to relax after\nthe squint so go into a squint and out\nof a squint okay and then you're gonna\nfeel the tears start to come so let the\ntears come it's a sense of lack of\nlubrication in your eyes so the tears\nare gonna want to come and lubricate\nokay and what we're gonna do is try to\nhold this for between 30 and 60 seconds\nwithout blinking\nand now close your eyes so feel the\nrelief feel the slight burning and now I\nwant you to look at the screen of your\nmind so you're gonna see almost like\nthat your visual receptors are still\nactive and do you see something within\nthe blackness of your mind yeah you okay\nso I want you so there should be\nsomething central that you see does that\nmake sense\nmm-hmm so focus on the central thing\ntell me what you see\nit's it's the after image of your face\nmostly like the lower half of your face\nokay so what does it look like to you\ndescribe what you see not not what it is\nlooks like two points in the middle of a\nblack outline beautiful so I want you to\nconcentrate on those two points in the\nblack outline and try to keep them as\ncentral as you can in your in the screen\nof your mind or your Chi Akash just what\nit's called and let me know if you lose\nit time is it trying to move no but it's\nit's blurring out over time focus on it\nconcentrate look closer\nokay yeah it's coming back some good\nstill have it mmm not really it's okay\nso let's just faded away so open your\neyes good so that's what you need to\npractice so take a candle okay\nso tell me how do you feel right now\ntired like a little wrung out good I\nmean was that you didn't feel that way\nbefore the practice right no no yeah\nso this so this is what I mean so this\npractice is like intensive meditation\nright so there are a lot of times when\npeople do like when we do breath\noriented techniques those are\ninvigorating energizing they increase\nyour prana or your Chi this practice is\ngoing to take it out of you it requires\na lot of effort and it's like not a\ncommon experience of meditation most\npeople feel energized when we do\nmeditation this practice is gonna drain\nyou which is what we want okay\nin your case okay okay so this practice\nis also called the rocker or fixed-point\ngazing tra ta ka I can send you some\ninformation about it yeah I'm interested\nand what I want you to do is do it with\nespecially a long stomach candle if you\ncan't not like a long long stem yeah I\nwant to see the stem of a candle right\nand what you want to do is over the\ncourse of 30 seconds start at the base\nof the candle and move your way up to\nthe the flame and then stare at the\nflame for maybe another 30 to 60 seconds\nwithout blinking and then close your\neyes and then hang on to the after image\nand put your concentration on the after\nimage that's phase one kind of guys do\ndid people at home do the practice do\nyou guys want to try it again okay\nso thoughts questions uh well of course\nright like you've promised secret\nknowledge that that has to be you know\ngiven offline like of course I'm\nimmensely curious right like yes sorry I\ndidn't mean to do no no I I get was an\naudit I I didn't I didn't mean to try to\ncreate a call to their no no it's just\nI'm serious so like some of the stuff\nthat you do in meditation like literally\nthere are case reports of meditation and\ndo psychosis and one of the biggest\nthings that I've learned being both a\nmedical doctor and someone who's been\nteaching meditation for 15 years is some\nof this stuff it's not just a it's not\nmindfulness we're not doing mindfulness\nright right I'm sure you've done\nmindfulness I have this does not feel\nquite like that this is something\ndifferent this is taking something out\nof you and if you give it too much\nyou're gonna go nuts Wow all right right\nand you you know what I mean like when\nyou do mindfulness like how do you feel\nat the end of mindfulness rested and\nfocused centered yeah you feel how do\nyou feel at the end of this I said I\nfelt wrung out yeah right so this is\ndifferent like this is this is like\nspiritual growth level stuff that we\ndon't talk about anymore like somewhere\nalong the way when mindfulness crossed\nthe pond like we left a bunch of stuff\nin it like India and we brought the\nMcDonald's version that's absolutely\nokay so this isn't Mickey D's the Happy\nMeal yeah but do you other thoughts or\nquestions no not I don't know it I feel\nlike where I was at the end of last week\nwhere now you've taken me in a direction\nwhere I'm like I don't know I need time\nto absorb that to figure out what\nquestions I would have good that's our\ngoal\nright what yeah I guess yeah well I yeah\nit's definitely the goal in terms of\nprogress because you definitely left me\nwith two or three things that I'm like\noh [ __ ] he's completely right and why\nhaven't I seen that and oh my god that's\nlike a you know that\nthe I'm feeding the hungry beast and\nthat makes it bigger\nI've always known and agree with\nintellectually the the way to have\nenough is to want less not to get more\nbut then you've pointed out where I'm\ncompletely not living that and I'm like\noh [ __ ]\nand then how do i unwind that because in\nmy case I've like I've built not only\nmuscles at doing it but like pride in\nthe sense of I'm capable of scheduling\nanything I can make I could actually ski\nin two places at once I just need a\nhelicopter like that's how my mind works\nand yeah you're telling me like you've\nspent 20 or 30 years honing an ability\nthat's actually bad not not that it\ndoesn't have uses but that in his aspect\nis is maladaptive maladaptive that's the\nword yeah so that's okay so you don't\nhave to unravel it what we're gonna do\nis just unplug it okay okay and even\nbetter that yeah so so let me ask you\nthis so you it may be hard to recall but\nlike what were you trying to optimize or\nget out of the practice that we were\ndoing while you were doing it when\nyou're trying to hold on to the\nafterimage what are you trying to feed\nthe only thing I was trying to feed was\nbeing able to do it like success focus\nso you're gonna ask you in a different\nway yeah are you actually trying to feed\nsomething no right so you're wondering\nhow do I stop feeding this thing well\nyou just practice not feeding things and\nyou just did it you just took the first\nstep okay that's for a moment your mind\nis not trying to feed anything\nthere's no FOMO there's no feeding\nthere's no hunger there's just you and\nwhat are you in that moment\nyou're not anything there we go that is\nshoonya that is jr. you are not anything\nand the more that you become comfortable\nwith that person there's no need for\nFOMO\nFOMO will go away on its own you don't\nhave to conquer it you don't have to do\nanything it's just gonna go away be gone\nthey'll wake up one day done\nthat'll be awesome so the only other\nplace I get close to this is really hard\nphysical activity yeah are the two\nrelated like when I play hockey right\nice hockey's very demanding I play with\npeople half my age so the the art of\nkeeping up with them leaves me\nno time to think or worry about anything\nelse seeing it achieved a different way\nabsolutely right because what did you\nsay you can't do when you're poor work\ncan't think or worry\nso we once we disabled thinking and\nworrying it all so it's all the same\nplace okay\njust two paths to the same door or yes\nit's about a state it's about eliciting\na state of consciousness got it right\nwhether you fall asleep whether you are\nknocked out or whether you were\nanesthetized yeah if you are unconscious\nyou are unconscious\nso you can lead to consciousness like\nstates of consciousness in different\nways a lot of people on stream ask me\nabout you know psychedelics and things\nlike that so like meditation I'm not\nsaying that they're exactly the same but\na state of consciousness is a state of\nconsciousness so there are different\nroads to getting there so intense\nphysical exercise is a form of\nmeditation because the goal of\nmeditation is to attain a particular\nstate where your mental function is\nactually turned off but your\nconsciousness or awareness remains high\nreally this I need this so badly because\nyou know the notes I'd written before\nthis and I said up front it's like I I\nfound I'm more and more grasping for\nthings and I'm no longer grasping for\nlike economic stuff so much is\nexperiential but that the hunger for\nmore is it is a problem\nyou were saying that you had you had\nasked you had made notes or wanted to\nask questions about grasping before we\nmet today yeah yeah I mentioned it right\nwhen we started that's why I said the\nFOMO was myself that's a place I kicked\nbutt but I've noticed it in I'm several\nfear missing out was like the easiest\nway to summarize it I did think about it\nand let me just see what I actually\nwrote in my notes was I realized that\nwanting to feel loved our topic from\nlast time has generally made me grasping\nfor lots of pleasant things activities\ntravel time with friends food I'm\npleasure-seeking and that was I\nsummarized that to you as FOMO because\nthat was like the the fastest way yeah\nso yeah so that you know I so first of\nall Ethan I think you've done a great\njob of kind of reflecting I think I\nthink it's good that you're at a place\nwhere you're not quite sure what to ask\nbecause that means we've moved past\nwhere your mental patterns have already\nfigured everything out does that make\nsense yeah yeah we want to move you\nbeyond what you already understand which\nis a lot yeah and and you know this is\ngonna become harder as you as you learn\nmore and then you're gonna explore more\nand things like that but that's okay so\nany I'm gonna just ask real quick any so\ndo you have any other questions or do\npeople on your stream have questions uh\nlet's see\nno looking at their questions the the\nonly one which I know you've answered\nbefore is what do you charge an hour\nwhich I already know the answer to so I\ncan answer for them offline okay you've\nsaid before right it's four and a\nquarter right that's your normal like\nBilly went up in 2020 so I increase my\nrates every there you go I'm getting\nyeah so and my only question is man you\ncan't leave me hanging I want to follow\nup on this shun\nShinya meditation like I'm super so will\nfollow so but so here's the thing you\nhave to practice the rocket ah yeah I\ngot it will so interestingly practicing\nlike mindfulness meditation was only\nmedium interesting to me this one i mike\ndamn it there's a candle in the house\ni'm so on this because i because i do i\ndirectly see the connection to something\ni want to work on\nso the that's interesting you've been or\nit almost sounds as if the concern that\nyou had at the beginning of the session\nwhich is how do i meditate is no longer\na concern\nwe'll see how i do this week but it\nfeels much more meditation last week\nfelt a little bit like and in in the\npast my life felt a little bit like oh\nthis is a good thing you should do like\neat broccoli do sit-ups it's a good\nthing but why exactly am i eating\nbroccoli why exactly am i doing situps\nyou know like ohm or health\nthis seems much more like you said I get\nto pull the plug out of the anxiety to\ndo everything and out of the fear of\ndeath out of the wall that's motivating\nbecause it's a specific goal good that's\nthat's our goal right so now we'll go\nback so you can talk as much as you want\nto about behaviorally fine and get\nbehaviorally how to do it but I think\nthis is how meditation happens it's\nabout Karma it's about time in place and\ninspiration and what you kind of saying\nearlier that you know part of the the\nChristian ideal that you try to live up\nto is that of whom much is given much is\nexpected\nyes and similarly God will provide that\nwhich you need when you need it so don't\nworry about it those words are\ndon't worry about it is it's very hard\nfor me yeah I'm an excellent worrier\nyeah\nworld class yeah so you need a little\nbit more faith right absolutely\nokay so all right um thanks a lot man\nyeah that was thank you\nlike I am I am deeply grateful actually\nfor today's last week I was intrigued\nand and and like interested this week\nI'm like honestly I wanted to tell you\nI'm blown away right the the rate of\nyour ability to get inside quickly and\npull out something deep impressive and\nvaluable so thank you well it helps what\nyou have a willing participant and are\nintelligent and dedicated and thoughtful\nso then yeah a lot of people followed up\nwith me through the week and we're like\nholy [ __ ] I could have never done that\nin public\nyou'd be surprised for all of those\npeople you'd be surprised that I've been\nsurprised by how many people are willing\nto come on and talk and and how well\nthis is working I think that's a big\nproblem is that we we we hide the worst\nparts of ourself and thereby we prevent\nthem from being like helped or fixed\nresult in sunlight is an amazing\ndisinfectant yeah and that's that's what\nI told him as they said well for the\nbenefit you know sure I said earlier I\nfelt embarrassed about stuff well\nthat's okay right if it if it helps me\nget better because you you had I don't\nknow if you realize this but you had a\nreally good terrifying line which was\nthis is only gonna get worse for you\nyour your 50 as each year ticks off if\nyou're desperate to feed the beast I'm\nyou're afraid of death it's only going\nto amplify and that was so obviously\ntrue because what you don't know is that\nI've had conversations with my wife\nabout like well I need to do this this\nand this activity over the next five\nyears because I like I like to play\nhockey I mentioned that but it's not\nsomething you do in your 70s and so I\nhave like a mental clock of only so many\nhockey games left and yeah you hit right\non it like if you have that thinking as\nit it creates a desperation cycle that's\nself reinforcing so yeah alright my work\nman all right thank you thank you very\nmuch\nall right until next us yeah take care\nand"
