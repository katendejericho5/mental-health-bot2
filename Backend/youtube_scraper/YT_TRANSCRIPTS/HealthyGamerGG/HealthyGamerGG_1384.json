    "transcript": "is that BPD there there's actually some\nvery interesting data so a lot of people\nthink of BPD is being incurable but\nthere's a there's some really\nfascinating data that if you can get in\na stable relationship for two years and\nhave someone not abandon you then\nthere's a 50% chance your BPD will like\nactually go away\nyou sound good to me you sound good to\nme too man good good so how you doing\nman I actually had a few days where I\nwas helping a friend with depression uh\nwhich was kind of therapeutic for me\nyeah and I kind of I was using some\nthings you taught me and it seems to be\nworking it was nice\nwell hold on can i Hanson about this I\nmean I want to preserve this person's\nprivacy and everything yeah but I think\nthat's awesome\ncan we talk about that for a second I'm\nexcited sure so tell me tell me a little\nbit about someone that you know and\nobviously care about was feeling sad or\ndown or depressed yeah um\nthey're in a spot in life where they\ndon't really know what path they want to\ngo down they have a lot of minor\ninterests but no big overwhelming drive\ntoward one specific thing uh-huh and\nthen I was able to relate to that I was\nin felt like that before and how good it\nwill feel to find the specific drive or\na motivator a dark Dharma you call it\nright yeah and just trying to search\nwith them for what they could do what\nwhat they're passionate about and asking\na bunch of questions it was fun for me I\nwas excited to help them find it and we\nwere seeing we seem to be getting\nsomewhere that's awesome man I'm so\nhappy to hear that yeah so here's the\nthing I don't think you need to like\nhave a degree or be like a licensed\nprofessional to like help another human\nbeing and I think it's yes I can't see\nyou in discord because you have to turn\nit off Moebius wait or is it me no maybe\nit's me hold on you haven't pressed the\nlittle camera button tomorrow there we\ngo\nokay there we go sorry parrot oh good\nyes so I think that's that's awesome and\nI'm so happy that you were able to do\nthat for someone yeah yeah I I noticed I\nvery much enjoy trying to help people\nfind something they're passionate about\nand I took that uh myers-briggs sixteen\npersonality test uh-huh what do you\nthink about that by the way so I think\nit is a useful tool to help people\nunderstand themselves in terms of like\nwhat resonates and what doesn't there's\na lot of non independent research on\nmyers-briggs so myers-briggs has not\nbeen to the best of my knowledge very\nindependently verified I'm so there's a\nmyers-briggs Research Institute and they\ndo a lot of research but I don't think\nit's been studied as well as something\nthat is like let's say the five factor\nmodel which doesn't mean is it isn't\nuseful it just may not be as scientific\nas people think it is okay interestingly\nenough myers-briggs is in my opinion\nbased on iron meta which not many people\nknow tell us about that a little\nso myers-briggs is it was developed by\npeople who are studying Carl Jung so\nCarl Jung is the one who came up with\nthe term introvert and extrovert I think\nand so they sort of took some of Carl\nJung's teachings and then tried to\ndevelop a system of personality\nassessment based on Jung's\nwork the interesting thing is like\nJung's work is heavily influenced by\nEastern philosophy and Eastern\nperspectives on the mind so for example\nthe idea that there are different mental\ntypes which is I think myers-briggs has\ndone the best job of sort of sharing\nthis concept with with the West which is\nthat like your mental type is not the\nsame as other people's mental type which\nis generally like when we think about\npsychology like if you study a\npsychology textbook they talk about like\nthings they talk about principles of the\nmind as if they apply to everyone yes\nright but myers-briggs says oh there are\nfundamentally different kinds of minds\nand that concept I think is different\nfrom like it's not actually a Western\nconcept that's actually like a concept\nthat comes from Eastern medicine because\nWestern psychology and science and\nmedicine is about the standardization of\nall human beings so like when we you\nlearned cardiac physiology a heart is a\nheart is a heart yeah it's very\nbeneficial to realize that the minds are\ndifferent so that you can try to when\nyou're communicating with someone you\ncan realize that their perspective is\ndifferent one than yours that they see\nthe world in another way that even the\nthings they enjoy or care about can be\ncomplete opposites or I I hadn't\nrealized that so much I guess I guess\nthat's what I was liking about a friend\nof mine talking about the myers-briggs\nyeah yeah and I think just as a\npractical point so I did a trained a\nmyers-briggs training where we did like\na personality assessment through like\nthe official institution as part of my\npsychiatry training and I thought it was\nwonderful like there were all kinds of\nlike there was actually a medical doctor\nwho's a myers-briggs trained person who\nwas teaching it so she was explaining to\nus how a lot of the interactions we have\nwithin the field of medicine can be\nbroken down\naccording to myers-briggs personality\ntyping and I actually found it to be\nquite helpful mm-hmm\ndo you know what you're do you feel\ncomfortable sharing what your type is\nyeah so I took it a long long time ago\nand back then I got INTP but then I took\nit two days ago\nI had a completely different one so I've\nchanged I guess but I have to look up\nwhich one it was ah I watched a YouTube\nvideo on what it was afterwards I look\nat my history did you take the official\ntest or you took like an online version\nso I took some online version it was\npretty long though what's the official\none in comparison I mean you have to pay\nmoney for the official one usually and\nhow long how many questions is it I\ndon't know I don't remember maybe like\n150 or something\nokay um and I'm having trouble finding\nthis I got I got one that when I went on\nthe YouTube video about it it said that\nthis personality type enjoys trying to\nhelp people find what they are\npassionate about\nyeah Oh II nfj I think that is wildly\ndifferent from I MTP yeah let me make\nsure ENFJ oh wait maybe it was ENFP hold\non hold on\nI was watching this video hold on hold\non it was this the one yeah okay I think\nit was ENFP yeah so in the my official\nmyers-briggs test they also give you\nlike what percentage you are so for\nexample like you can be a strong tea or\na strong F or you can be kind of in the\nmiddle and a couple of other things\nabout myers-briggs typing so you can\nlike fluctuate over time and you can\nadopt different attitudes in different\nsituations yeah so right now this seemed\nreally fitting for me because it said\nthat I like to start things and inspire\npeople and give broad ideas and then\nother people will go in and do the\nspecifics which is really accurate for\nwhat I'm doing on Everland\nyeah yeah cool how are you feeling um\ntoday yeah so today I haven't taken\npsilocybin I mean okay if you can tell\nI'm feeling okay I you know I have my\nusual low desire I've had some wavering\nconfidence recently it's just coming and\ngoing like sometimes there'll be moments\nwhere I'm very confident myself and\nwanting to talk to people\nI'll be going on a walk outside by the\nriver and I'll i'ma start conversation\nwith with with random people and and in\na way that I was never able to do before\nI'll I used to maybe think oh how would\nI even talk to someone I'll say hello\nand then I'll run I have nothing else to\nsay but somehow I'll always think of a\ntopic of something pertaining to exactly\nwhat's going on in the situation or I\ndon't know and the conversation just\nflows and it makes me feel confident\ngood that I can do that yeah but then\nother days that I feel a low self-esteem\nscared to look people in the eyes even\nmm-hmm\nso it's going back and forth a lot and\nmy how good I'm feeling is a lot has a\nlot to do with the validation I'm\ngetting from others and I'd love for it\nto be more independent but if one person\nfinds my one person finds my hmm my\nconversation or whatever uninteresting\nor uncomfortable for them it'll affect\nmy mood a lot and I won't be able to\nfocus or feel good about myself yeah\nokay\nout of curiosity the first time we\ntalked do you know if you had used\npsilocybin that day I had but it would\nhave been like five hours before we\ntalked before we began talking so was\nnear the very end okay\nyou know okay how does it feel sorry go\nahead\nyeah go ahead how does it feel to sort\nof not have control over which reckful\nshows up well I do have control cuz I\ncan take it or not take it that's in my\ncontrol right yeah okay so do you feel\nlike the confident reckful shows up when\nyou do take it yeah when I take it\nconsistently\neverything's consistently better and\nevery single time I'm like maybe I can\nbe interesting without it\nand maybe maybe I prefer being out\nwithout it today what if I decide to\ntake it then I do feel better every\nsingle time it hasn't ever happened\nwhere I don't um it's interesting so I\nwas I was talking with Gary my brother\nhe said he was watching our talks and um\nwell he was really happy for me anyway\nthat uh I'm feeling better nowadays but\nhe wanted me to mention to you that I've\nbeen missing him also in my life because\nhe ran away and went backpacking in\nSouth America fifteen years ago and\nnever came back\nsince then he came back he streamed with\nme like one a couple days like in 2012\nand uh he came for a few days here and\nthere to the US but he's just been\ntraveling the world and staying in\nhostels for like 15 years uh and he said\nhe ran away because it was overwhelming\nfor him all the responsibility he had to\ntake on in the family that he felt like\nhe had to be my dad when he was my\nbrother you know I actually wanted to\nbring him on he said he can't today but\nnext week he said he could come on if we\nwant to talk okay we three yeah maybe\nthat'd be good right yeah absolutely\nyeah\nI mean no what do you think what do you\nthink about that reckful about what he\ndid and why do you think it's relevant\nhere well why did he mention it or why\ndo I think it's relevant why do you\nthink it's relevant I think it's\nrelevant because it helps paint a fuller\npicture of the story of a family and\nactually his experience was probably a\nlot harder than mine because he was 16\nwhen it happened and it's a more more\nformative years I guess I I guess so I'm\nnot sure yeah\nand he suddenly his personality shifted\nyou know 180 degrees when it happened he\nwas texting me talking about how he\nfeels to blame that my brother died and\nhe feels like he knew he was gonna kill\nhimself and that he could have stopped\nit and he feels like my brother didn't\ndirectly tell him but he knew and you\nknow this that when you go down that\nthought process it's really hard what's\nhard on that thought process for him\nit's a field to take the blame on for it\nthat's very hard and I was telling him\nthough that it would have happened\nregardless if it didn't happen that day\ncuz I know what it's like to be sad for\nyears and it's just it's really hard to\navoid trying to kill yourself at some\npoint yeah now unless he had found a\nreally good therapist or some medication\nI think he would have happened regard\nfor psilocybin or psilocybin yeah which\nI that's medication I think yeah but uh\nor meditation maybe I think the problem\nwith meditation even if it gets you\nthere a really depressed person won't\nput in the time required that's the\nproblem that completely I believe you\nfully that it would meditation can get\nsomeone there I just don't go anywhere\noutside out of depression okay but I\nthink it's really hard to get a\ndepressed person to start meditating and\nstick with it similarly to how I feel\nit's very hard to get an anxious person\nto go to therapy because they're too\nanxious about going I completely agree\nwith you yeah\nso so I think the the tricky think about\nmeditation is while I you know it is an\nevidence-based treatment for a lot of\nmental health issues it requires a lot\nof I don't think it's a good acute\ntreatment right so when we think about\nmedicine their acute treatments and then\nthey're like non-acute treatments so I\nthink yoga and surgery are both good for\nyour body but if you've been acutely\ninjured in a motor vehicle accident you\nneed surgery not yoga and I think Yoga\nis good for like you know the healing\nprocess and to make sure you maintain\nmobility and things like that afterward\nthat kind of think about meditation the\nsame way so I actually dislike it\nsometimes when some people come to me\nand they say I'm super super depressed I\ndon't want medication I don't just want\nto meditate my way through it and I'm\nhappy to have them try that but I think\nthat science has given us a lot of tools\nincluding you know psychoactive\ncompounds like medications and then if\nyou know things go I mean I just saw a\ncouple of other things about FDA\nfast-tracking MDMA and other of these\npsychoactive compounds because I do\nthink that they're therapeutic yeah what\nkind of is it okay but can I push you\nright into the experience they well at\nleast they open a door for you and it's\nreally easy to go in that door I heard\nit MDMA helps with PTSD I think we\ntalked about that a little bit so\nreckful if we were to just think a\nlittle bit about what direction you want\nto go so you've feel like we have a\ncouple of open doors that we can explore\none is that you know if you want to\ncontinue talking about psilocybin and\nhow it makes you feel and when you use\nit and when you don't we can talk about\nGary and what it was like you were sort\nof putting yourself in his shoes a\nlittle bit and sort of imagining what it\nwas like for him and we can continue to\nexplore that or we can talk about what\nit was like for you to have Gary leave\nand I mean I think all three of those\nare good what do you think we should\nspend our time on today it's interesting\ntoday all of those sounds scary to\nexplore maybe it's because I'm not on so\nSimon but I just I\nthink about it and it sounds like a\ndaunting task to go down any of those\npaths okay um I don't know which one we\nshould go down I prefer so josy okay\nsure so III am gonna actually offer\nnumber four so how do you face life when\nlife gives you daunting tasks mmm right\nso like let's not go down let's not\nforce ourselves through any one of those\nroads and let's try to find you where\nyou are because I'm glad I'm glad I'm so\nglad you said that reckful because I\nthink a lot of the challenge like you\nsaid like it's hard to meditate when\nyou're feeling a certain way and the way\nthat you're feeling instead of just\npushing you down a path because it's\nquote-unquote good for you or you know\nhelps you understand things or whatever\nlet's try to meet you where you are and\ntalk about what is it what does it feel\nlike\nI like this oppressor to live where you\nare right now yeah what is it like when\nwhen you have a choice in life to take\nsome some substance and then for things\nto no longer be as daunting and then to\nlike not take that substance some days\nand then like life feels daunting like\nthat sounds terrifying to me maybe a bit\nit's more terrifying to not have the\noption to take anything because then\nyou're hopeless okay but I I agree with\nyou that most people wouldn't like the\nfeeling of reliance on anything like\nthat I also get often get the feeling of\nreliance on other people yeah I do well\nalone and I'll be very overbearing for\npeople sometimes because sometimes I\nfeel like I just need someone to talk to\nI can't be in my thoughts like I'm yeah\nlosing my mind in my room I just can't\nhandle it so I'll just message someone\nand\nthey won't respond and I'll message them\nagain and I'll have this huge wall of\ntext and then they'll be like oh this\nperson is just too much for me even if\nit's a long term friends might hang on\nfor like seven years yeah this big and\nthen they'll notice they'll start\ntalking to me less and less because of\nthese situations where I was overbearing\nor just needed them at the specific time\nand tried to push them to go outside\nwith me or you know spontaneously I\nalways want to do these spontaneous\nthings and people most people like to\nplan more I've always had trouble\nplanning I I never bought a round-trip\nplane ticket yeah what what is it what\nis it within you that what are you\nhungry for in those moments where you\nneed someone else connection I really\nwant I want to hear someone relating to\nme in some way well I think I do but\nthen if I actually reach out to someone\nvery depressed then we bounce off back\nand forth about how much life sucks and\nit just gets darker at darker so and\nthen if I reach out to someone happy I\ncan't relate to them hmm sounds like\nyou're damned if you do damned if you\ndon't\nyeah so so it looks like you're looking\nfor something but I mean are there\npeople that you can connect with that\nsort of have the balance that makes you\nfeel better once in a while and it's\nreally incredible when I find that and\nthose people means so much to me I'm so\nscared for them to disappear because\nthough there'll be people who have been\nthere but are currently okay and I think\nthose are the ones when I talk to them\nthey can relate but they can also be\noptimists yep yep yeah I think that's a\nreally important realization so I'm\ngonna just repeat back some words at you\nand so it sounds like you're looking for\nconnection yes right and that you're\nlooking for a particular kind of\nconnection someone who understands where\nyou are but at the same time isn't where\nyou are yes and when you find someone\nlike that you feel\nsome think within you feels really good\nso what how do we describe the way you\nfeel when you find someone like that I\nwant to find someone like that oh well I\nfeels I guess I was smiling just\nthinking about it I III think I'm\nlooking a little bit for family in my\nfriendships and it feels like I have a\nfamily member at that moment have you\nthought about that before no that was\njust now I go ahead yeah I mean I'm\nsurprised that you got there that quick\nI think you're learning fast yeah I\nwonder if I can process these thoughts\nbetter sober\nI feel so there's this disconnect that\nI'm not interested in my own thoughts\nright now you know cuz I'm have no\ndesires because that's how I am and I\nbut I assume that if I'm on psilocybin\nsince I'm having more fun since I'm\ngetting provoked but thought that my own\nthoughts are stimulating my my mind that\neveryone else is more interested in what\nI'm saying as well which isn't exactly\nalways true I can't tell because I'm\nlocked in my experience and if my\nexperience is better I assume other\npeople's experiences better usually as a\nstreamer that is the case if I'm\nlaughing other people are laughing it's\nbeen true but there have been a couple\ntimes I've been really happy and there\nwas this really strong disconnect with\nmy chat they would we're not enjoying\nyeah me and not\nthat doesn't seem like a profound\nrealization but it was anyway I can't\ntell right now if I am thinking or\ngetting to the correct conclusions\nquickly or more slowly than usual I feel\nlike I'm talking slowly right now you\nare talking slowly you're saying I'm\nless animated so there's also another\nlayer of something going on is like when\nwe're talking about you and suddenly you\nstart talking about your interactions\nwith your viewers mm-hmm right so the so\nthis we have to be careful about because\nhow much of the person that you try to\nbe is about being you and how much about\nit is like being what your viewers want\num well I've had a moral in my head\nsince I started streaming and I guess\nsince I've started living really said I\nalways want to be true to myself I want\nto yeah it's one of my favorite ones\nbecause the because is a\nharder to define I've always noticed\nmyself getting annoyed with other people\nwho are putting up facade mm-hmm an\nalternate persona I also think it's\ndamaging to society in general for\nanyone to be pretending to be happy when\nthey're not actually sharing your pain\nhelps others relate if people are just\nwatching happy people all the time\nthey wonder what's wrong with me you\nknow I think that adapt slates a lot of\nwhat's the damage of social media yeah I\nagree and even on get on social media\neven I'm guilty of it because I don't\nfeel like tweeting hey I want to die\nright now doesn't really don't really\ntweet that but I\nif I'm having a good thought a happy\nthought I'll tweet that if I'm a live\nstreaming I'll share the negative and\nthe positive but on social media you\ntend not to out of curiosity if you\ntweet I feel like dying right now and\nyou get a bunch of likes for that what\ndoes it like mean yeah does that mean we\nlove you and please don't hurt yourself\nor does it mean I don't know we can\nobviously it's like so good music I\ndon't even know what that means like I\nwouldn't know how to interpret that I\nthink all the UH I think all the\nemployees of Everland would be a little\nworried about their job not good for me\nor for anyone else\nso reckful is it okay if I kind of go\nback to sort of you and and the way that\nyou experience things and take a step\nback a little bit from some of this\nsocial commentary sure so this all\nstarted with a question that I asked you\nabout you know what does it feel like\nwhen you find that connection and then\nyou paused and you were thinking for a\nlittle bit and that he said you know\ntook the words out of my mouth and you\nsaid it feels like I'm trying to replace\nfamily with friends and then we went off\non this track of sort of like I don't\nknow if if you know I I don't know if I\nunderstand things better or worse when\nI'm on on psilocybin or you know and so\nyou kind of went off on that tangent and\nwe can explore that too about like you\nknow what is the nature of your\nunderstanding that you gained what does\nit feel like one of the advantages and\ndisadvantages of being able to swim in\nboth worlds or should we just pick one\nor the other but if it's okay with you\nwe can run with this thread of\nconnecting with another human being\nbecause I think there's more there sure\nso can you help us understand what you\nmeant when you were a fivehead or six\nhead and you said I feel like I'm trying\nto replace I mean I feel like I'm trying\nto I'm treating my friends like family\nor something yeah so how did you get to\nthat conclusion\nwell it crossed my mind this feeling I\nhad when I was five years old and came\nhome and saw laughing and smiling faces\nit on the couch something I never saw\nagain after I was six\num I've been thinking about that a lot\nrecently\never since we started talking and I\nrealized that to come back to bring that\nback and a couple times I've I tried to\nfacilitate situations with friends where\nthis would happen and I lived with a\nbunch of friends and I like a gamer\nhouse and I'd want to come home and see\na couple friends around the couch\nyeah sometimes we'd be playing Mario or\nsomething and coming home to that gave\nme some deep satisfaction that I needed\num I guess from my childhood but maybe\nnot just from my childhood I mean people\nneeded as adults to even if they had\neven so high so what is that\nsatisfaction that you're looking for\nwhat is that feeling that you're like\nwhen you connect with someone and they\nunderstand you just\nI can feel what it is right now but I\ncan't describe it\nmy right way knows what is it what does\nit feel like in your body it's that\nfeeling where you when you really want a\nhug don't know how else to describe it\nyeah a what I'm seeing in your face is\nan aching loneliness just an abject\nsense of just being yeah in it it like\nhurts right it's like not just being\nlonely like lonely doesn't describe it\nit's like hurts it feels like\nsomething's missing and the only thing\nthat can like you need someone else to\nfill that in because you've tried for a\nlong time to like fill it yourself and\nyou just can't yeah\nbut they keep it keeps happening where\nthe people I'm trying to fill it in with\nthink I'm crazy ya know cuz they're not\nas needy as I am for soon now there's a\nwhole other layer to this you need a\nminute or can we keep going no we can\nkeep going so I think there's there two\nfears here one is like the feeling of\naching and loneliness and the second is\nwhen you find those people the fear that\nthey're going to leave to that you're\ngonna do something and then they're\ngonna stop returning your to me do ya so\nit's not an irrational fear right so\nwhat do we call that\nhmm what do we consider when you're\nafraid of someone leaving\nand then you call it fear of abandonment\nyeah yeah and in your case reckful this\nis this needs to be understood very\nclearly so some people when they\nrecognize those things within themselves\nthey blame themselves right they say I\nshouldn't feel this way or this is\nweakness or I should be able to be\nindependent do you have those thoughts I\nused to because everyone I talk to would\ntell me oh I don't know why you're in a\nrelationship when you can't even be\nhappy alone or you know that's a very\ncommon line I hear and I would say well\nif I wasn't in the relationship I'd want\nto die okay obviously not a healthy so\nit would I'm gonna ask you a couple of\nquestions okay now if I if you have\nsomeone who's lonely or not even lonely\nhow does someone get comfortable how can\nI say this how does someone get\ncomfortable with being alone like what\nhas to happen for them to feel\ncomfortable with like separation from\nother human beings and this may be a\nlittle bit of a reading my mind\nquestions so sorry I don't know how to\nanswer ask it well well I mean that void\nthat you're talking about needs to be\nfilled but I don't know how to fill it i\nif I had a family maybe it would be okay\nbut in my situation what can I do know\nyour situation what you can do now oddly\nenough I I think you're on on the right\ntrack and I want to stop there because I\nwant to talk about someone else let's\ntalk about someone besides you right if\nyou have a person who feels lonely and\nfeels like they have a void within them\nwhat is the solution because there's a\nthere's all that there's the camp of\npeople who says why are you in a\nrelationship if you can't be happy by\nyourself right they're saying like okay\nthe first thing you need to do is fill\nthat void and then you can be with\nsomeone in a healthy and productive way\ndoes that make sense yeah that's what\nthey say that's what they say right but\nlet's just think about that for a second\nis that actually correct because if you\nhave that void within you and you feel\nloneliness within you if you're afraid\nof abandonment how do you get someone to\nstop fearing abandonment\nyou don't abandon them absolutely so\nthis needs to be understood reckful you\ncannot fix this for yourself that's a\nbit scary yeah right so it's not that\nthe relationship has to happen after you\nfix this for yourself or I mean maybe\nyou can't fix it for yourself maybe\nthat's unfair for me to say it's kind of\nlike a blanket statement so I think\nmaybe you can generally what you've seen\ngenerally when I think about people who\nhave been abandoned\nthey fear abandonment and that's what\nhappened to you right like cuz\napparently you weren't abandoned by just\none brother Yeah right how old are you\nnow thirty okay so when you were fifteen\none brother left when you were six one\nand the other brother left when you were\nfifteen yeah yeah\nand that's hard right and so like this\nis this is like so I mean I don't wasn't\nlike it wasn't just like he left for a\njob or you know to school it was he left\nthe country and never came back\nyeah so if he left for like college or a\njob like that I don't think is the same\nas like he just ya up it like straight\nup left yeah cuz when he had left for\ncollege it was okay we would come back\nsome weekends and we would play Final\nFantasy so don't take turns sir\nsome things like that yeah yeah order\nChinese food I remember yeah and and I\nmean it was bad enough without one and I\nthink you were maybe getting your sea\nlegs under you and then like round two\nhits and and then what happens is you\nhave this thing that's that's afraid\nthat other people are gonna leave you\nand I think the problem is that you're\nsmart and and something probably very\nvicious happens and I can a\nself-fulfilling prophecy that absolutely\nthey're gonna leave me then they will\nleave me because I'll be overbearing in\nthe capsule and you can see it happening\nand it terrifies you because you can't\nstop it and you know what's gonna happen\nyeah and each time it happens it's\nanother abandonment another abandonment\nanother abandonment yeah yeah I've had\nabout there been a like three or four\npeople just in the last few months that\nI've started to talk to you regularly\nand then I was quickly too much they\nliked me at first my company and then I\nwas quickly too needy or too much for\nthem and they started feeling like they\nshould ignore me which is doesn't even\nfeel unreasonable I can't no matter so\nwhat it comes down to so I'm gonna share\na little bit of data okay I want to be\nvery clear about this I'm gonna talk to\nyou about something called borderline\npersonality disorder I don't think you\nhave this by the way and it's really\nokay a lot of people think I do have\nthat maybe you do I don't know so I\ndon't have enough time I don't know so\nI'm gonna just talk a little bit about\nborderline personality disorder because\nI think that there's some features of it\nwhich are irrelevant yeah and also like\nsome very interesting data that some\npeople don't know so the first is that\nborderline personality disorder a lot of\ntimes these people have a fear of\nabandonment and so they do get overly\nclingy and as they get overly clingy\nthey sort of like force people away and\nthen it kind of like reinforces their\nfear that like they're unlovable yeah\nand then that sort of and each round\nmakes it worse because once you do to\nthe first person your sense of being\nunlovable increases and then when you\ninteract with the next human being like\nthat\nthat wolf has become hungrier and so\nwhen when they sort of treat you well\nthey feel really good about themselves\nand when the person starts to I kind of\nslip away it gets like stronger and\nstronger and stronger and each round is\nlike a becomes as you put it a\nself-fulfilling prophecy and makes it\nharder mm-hmm now what many people don't\nknow about BPD is that BPD there there's\nactually some very interesting data so a\nlot of people think of BPD is being\nincurable but there's a there's some\nreally fascinating data that if you can\nget in a stable relationship for two\nyears and have someone not abandon you\nthen there's a 50% chance your BPD will\nlike actually go away so it's really\nfascinating and I think the opposite of\nyou shouldn't get in a relationship\nuntil you're yeah so a lot of people\nstruggle with BPD but it's it's a really\nfascinating little snippet of research\nwhich I don't think is like well\nunderstood by many people disputed by\nmany people but the truth is that the\nmajority of people who have BPD never\nsee a psychiatrist they just live their\nlives and then some people were they're\njust like kind of crazy until like their\n30s in their second marriage and they\nfind someone who's like stable enough to\nlike not abandon them and also deal with\ntheir like neediness and then like over\ntime they get better because they start\nto like recognize oh this person\nactually isn't gonna leave and then like\nif you realize that someone isn't gonna\nleave you then what does that do to like\nthe hungry like that aching loneliness\ninside I I heard you but your camera\nfroze oh [ __ ] sorry yeah this is\nfreezing but okay what the last couple\nwords went a little robot so so what\nwhat was the aching loneliness inside\nyou if someone doesn't leave you and you\nhave faith and confidence in that I\nbecome more stable and go through my\ndays feeling\nlike my presence was desired I'd be able\nto go in my room alone and work on\nsomething and not feel like I needed to\nbe near someone at that moment because I\nknow they'd be there for me later\nexactly that's the key thing right you\nknow they're gonna be here for you later\nand the problem right now is when you\nstart texting people a little bit much\nand they can't handle it you don't know\nthat they're gonna be here therefore you\ndon't yeah and that's what terrifies you\nso the other way so like even if you\ndispute the research on BPD and I don't\nknow if you have BPD or you don't have\nBPD but think about it this way if a\nchild feels insecure about like being\nabandoned like what do you do like when\na kid probably hug them a lot and you\nspend time with them yeah absolutely\nright so like I'll share a little bit\nfor my personal life so when I had my\nsecond kid my first kid was like really\nconfused and she was like super super\nclingy to me because she didn't\nunderstand what was happening so like I\nwent to the hospital with my wife and we\nwere like at the hospital and and my\nin-laws so her grandparents were staying\nwith her they did an awesome job and she\nlikes them but she was two years old and\nshe literally did not understand what\nwas going on she did not understand like\nwhy my wife and I would not come home\nyeah and she would come and see us every\nday in the hospital and she would be\nlike excited when she saw us and she\nwould actually be okay leaving because\nshe's like a pretty you know confident\nsort of loving kid but she just did not\nunderstand like why mommy and daddy were\nlike not coming back and so she got\nsuper super clingy for about a year and\nthat was like doubly so because\nespecially towards the end of my wife's\npregnancy she used to do some things\nlike she would Bollywood dance with my\ntwo-year-old but as she was like eight\nand nine months pregnant she like can't\nlike she can't pick her up and throw her\nin the air and things like that and so\nthe tumor was already like noticing that\nsomething is different\nand then she liked what it was attached\nto me at the hip even at that age\nthere's that perceptive huh\nthat perceptive yeah right\nso then then for like for a period of\nabout a year and she didn't understand\ncuz like my wife would have to feed the\nnewborn right so she was like tired all\nday and things like that\nshe couldn't be like the person that\nthat my two-year-old had come to know\nand love and expect the level of\nattention she had come to expect who had\ndiminished yeah and so she did not feel\ngood in herself right the two-year-old\njust didn't because she didn't\nunderstand why these people are not\ndoing the things like is something wrong\nwith me she didn't understand why they\nwent away because when you're - or\nbecause when you're five and someone\ngoes away like you don't understand why\nthey did that you don't have the\ncapacity to understand that they did\nthat because of them and not because of\nyou yeah I still never believed that\nsentence yep right because like you you\ncan't believe it because you didn't have\nthe capacity believe it and that thing\nstill exists within you and so what did\nshe need to get out of it so she's -\nit's not that complicated\nright she needed 50% sorry a third of\nher life to have someone who did not\nlike abandon her in a very like\nintentional way so my wife and I we had\nthis like conversation when she was like\nyou know we had these several\nconversations that like okay your bond\nwith the new kid is not the same as your\nbond with the old kid because you're\nspending all the time with Vee Revere's\nour older daughter our younger\ndaughter's name is avi and so she was\nlike saying that like you know you're\nnot spending time with avi the way that\nyou used to spend time with Viren and we\nwould kind of like talk about it and\nit's like well yeah that's because like\nVeera needs me more and so we're really\nconcerned about sort of playing\nfavorites and stuff but I think in her\ncase it all Kurt huh that's tough I\nhaven't thought about the intricacies of\nhaving multiple children and how you\nwant it to be balanced where you give\nthem both equal time but what if one of\nthem needs you more you\ncuz they're yeah like this yeah then\nthen then you start to give one more\nattention than the other one might be\nsubtly losing confidence or yeah that's\ntough I wouldn't know what to do there's\nno obvious logical solution well I mean\nso when you talk to people I think\nthey're they're solutions that seem that\nare simpler that tend to do the trick so\nfor example like we made it a point to\ndo like one-on-one time like each of us\nwould swap traditional things so like\nfor example my wife would usually give\nveera bath and then I'd say like okay\nfor this month I'm gonna give her a bath\ninstead of you let's just swap the\nthings that we do so they're a couple of\nactually pretty easy like low-hanging\nfruit turns out to be because it's\nsomething it's not exactly balanced yeah\nit's Joe yeah like some one-on-one time\nconsistently but the point here reckful\nis I think like your solution is not\nthat like you need to learn how to be\nindependent I think like I don't know if\nI'm painting this picture for you\nappropriately but like what do you think\nneeds so like what what did we manage to\ndo for our two-year-old that never\nhappened for you gave that gave you gave\nthe two-year-old enough attention\nabsolutely yeah and I think that's what\nyou need you need you need someone in\nyour life who's not going to turn away\nfor a period of at least two years and\nyou may be terrified that they'll turn\naway at two point five right I might\nnever get it yeah I mean there's no\nguarantee I will but I look for it him\nyeah so sure there is I would not say so\nI there's only one I've gotten some\nreally unhealthy situations because I'm\nso desperate for human interaction that\nI'll have you know paid people's rent\njust so they'd be my roommate said have\nsomeone around you know done it a few\ntimes just a lot of dumb things like\nthat or try to get them to quit their\njobs and I give them a new job that\nrequires less time so I could have a\nfriend\nand obviously I've realized that these\nthings are unhealthy but I was just in\ndesperate situations where I needed\nhuman interaction so reckful I am\nconfident and okay\nI'm confident there's gonna be someone\naround in your life who will be there\nfor you most of the time when you need\nthem hopefully for at least a period of\ntwo years okay how can I be confident in\nthat how can you be confident yeah well\nyou probably you find me stimulating I\ntalk too and I'm not demanding too much\nof your time or spamming you with walls\nof text and even if I were you'd feel\ninclined to answer me because it's you\nyou love helping people it's it's your\npassion so from your perspective maybe\nyou can feel confident but then if you\nput yourself in the shoes of any other\nhuman being I don't know that they'll\nreally spend two years with me unless\nthere's it's erect well I'm not I'm not\ncounting on them to spend two years with\nyou what are you counting on I'm\ncounting on myself see oh there you'll\nspend two years with me hey yeah that I\nbelieve that I can believe yeah so I\ncan't trust any of them true so I'm\ngonna come to you every week like this\nI'm gonna try to love you for two years\n[Music]\nso this is a the other thing is that I\ndo helping people but I also like\nhelping you and I want you to understand\nthis reckful this isn't I'm not even\nhelping you like this isn't help I don't\nlike the phrase health help implies like\ncharity right it implies that you have\nsomething and that you have nothing and\nI have something and I'm like helping\nyou I'm not helping you this is just me\nbeing human and you being human\nI don't know if that makes any sense I\nthink it's one of the hinged by human\nit's just like it were just being\nawesome an it's not something fancy\nyou're doing what you enjoy\nit's not about a joy it's I'm being who\nI am and you are being who you are and\nthat's the most that we can expect of\nourselves yeah I I want to say that I\nfully understand but I don't yeah and if\nyou do spare me with walls of text I'll\nget back to you as soon as I can\nno actually I like this this is good\npractice that I have to wait the week\nyeah because that's what other people\nwant me to do\nthey want me to plan ahead and wait to\nsee them when they have time and not be\nlike oh I need hang up right now I need\nyou know let's go outside I need someone\nto talk to you please\nyou know yeah and this is the other\nimportant thing reckful very important\nvery very important okay we have to be\ncareful about our relationship yeah\nbecause the challenge is that when you\nstart doing things to get people to be\nwith you you can do that but it taints\nwhat they mean to you and it taints the\ncolor of what that person does for you\nbecause then something like goes into\nyour mind and and it's kind of like are\nthey doing this because I'm paying their\nrent or are they doing this because they\nlike me\nyeah yes listen it's very important that\nwe're very careful about like not\ntainting and for you to go forward you\nknow if there's someone that you want to\nform a relationship with don't taint the\nrelationship don't try to get me just be\naware of that because what you really\nneed is someone who wants you to who\nwants you for you yeah and you make it\nhard on them by giving them things that\nthey may need in life\nyeah but recently I try to make it\nmutually beneficial at least I hope so\nI mean things can be you can engage in\nmutually beneficial relationships that's\nfine I'm just saying like be careful\nabout when your loneliness there's a\ndifference between helping someone out\nbecause you're they're your friend and\nyou like you care about them as a\ngenuine person and you're just trying to\nhelp them out and there's a there's a\ndifference between that and trying to\nkeep someone close to you because you're\nfeeling lonely yeah I've done both for\nsure yet more and sometimes those get\nmuddled yeah so I'm not saying anything\nelse breathing so just going forward you\nknow just be careful about that and try\nto notice that loneliness within you I'm\ntrying so it keeps happening where I'm\nhiring people on Everland\nthey're very talented but I also like\nspending time with them so it's getting\nclose to that muddled area but it really\ndoes seem like the correct play I'll ask\nyou know Mike I lost Talbot or my lead\ndesigner if this is a good hire say yes\nit really is they're amazing\nI know but I think I think this is a\nsituation where it's mutually beneficial\nthat's what I actually really like about\nthis whole game development thing is\nthey're getting a job God my first\nthought was I'm getting a friend but\nthis is fine they're getting a job I'm\ngetting a friend I'm getting someone to\nand I'm also I mean the project is\nprogressing because of it and it's\nforming a sense of community in our\nworkspace yeah so I mean I think that\nmakes sense and and I think that you\nknow it's it's challenging to navigate\nthose relationships and what I want you\nto do is like cut yourself some slack\nokay cuz you have and well yeah you have\na you have a big void of love and and\nthat's gonna that's gonna you know\nthat's gonna cause you to do a couple of\nthings and that's not like it's not your\nfault right like you're just you just\nneed more love man and that's okay and\nat the same time I think you should be\nintentional about giving yourself the\nopportunities to be cared for\nappreciated and loved by other human\nbeings who are not your employees and to\ncultivate those relationships yeah I'm\ntrying I I have a few now yeah my old\nfriends from Lao are the best examples\nbecause we just met online and played\ngames together and\ntalked every day for years you know\nformed a deep sense of community it was\na little sad for me\nit's similarly to how after high school\nyou and all your friends go to different\nplaces or pursue different walks of life\nafter world of warcraft all my friends\nwent to different games or job careers\nyou know even if we went to the same\ncareer if it happened to be streaming\nit's actually such an isolating job most\nof the time not for you because you're\ntalking to someone every time but most\npeople that they're streaming on their\nown just playing a game right so it\nwasn't the same as when we just spend\ntime together online yeah good how you\nfeeling right now\nPhil uh I'm happy that I was able to\ncome on here without psilocybin and\nstill deep dive some critically some\nthoughts critically think\nget somewhere learn something also I\nthink the my viewers probably like\nseeing the other side of me here because\nI've been on psilocybin every stream for\na while I'm scared to be this version of\nme in front of people now a bit a little\nbit I just I mean they used to see this\nversion of me all the time but I'm just\n[Music]\nidentifying more with my happy side\nI like being happy me I mean who doesn't\nright I wonder what people think\nactually I lost them at the end so I\nlike your oath means I think you're\ndoing a really good job reckful because\nI think you're right I mean who doesn't\nlike to be the happy version of\nthemselves but I think that the real you\nand you know is not all happiness that's\nnot what life is like life is not just\nlike you know just the happy side of\nlife and there are a lot of people who\ntry to chase that part of themselves\nwhat I would advocate for you to do\nalong with just about everyone else is\nthat you like you be both of these\npeople and you learn how to be sad\nreckful better because I do believe that\nyou can be this person and it not be as\nhard or as painful as it is for you to\nexperience like day to day now like I\nthink that if you have someone who\nconsistently loves you and demonstrates\nthat they're not going to leave you for\na period of two years like being this\nperson is gonna be completely different\nin the sad and difficult thing is that's\nnot something you can do you can't make\nsomeone love you like that's just\nsomething that depends on your governme\nsomeone has to come into your life and\nyou have to like create this time and\nspace for that relationship it makes\nsense what you're saying cuz there have\nbeen times in my life where I'm just\ngiving everything up for a relationship\nand now I understand why I'll just stop\nstreaming and now\ngo anywhere do anything to be closer to\nthe person yeah and cuz yeah and so this\nis the hard thing this is why I guess\nmaybe I'm shooting myself in the foot\nhere but I'm I guess I'm volunteering\nand and the reason is because I think\nthat that person needs to also I mean\nthey don't need to understand this but I\nthink that person needs to not let you\ndo that as well yeah right so that I\nrealized that don't let you like if you\nwant to move to Boston I'm gonna say no\nright right and it doesn't mean that I\ndon't care about you but it's just you\nshould continue to live your life and\nhave some degree of constancy from\nsomeone and it sounds like you're in a\nromantic relationship so I mean it\ndoesn't have to be right now I'm not no\nokay\nI was though I did it a twitch streamer\ngirl and we met in Japan that we were\nboth IRL streaming in Japan now and it\nwas so exciting to meet like that and we\ntraveled to other places together but\nthen when life's kind of settled in slow\ndown I you know was slowly giving up\neverything just to spend more time with\nher at one point I had actually deleted\nmy twitch channel which my viewers\nthought was insane because I just I\ndon't know I can't even explain why I\ndon't know\nokay well a conversation for a different\nday yeah do you feel like meditating for\na few minutes do you yes yeah I yeah I\nfeel like I need a break from thought\nyeah good you do you want to take a\nbreak for a few minutes first and then\nmeditate on how clogged does your nose\nit's pretty good I'm getting over the\nsickness finally I think I've been sick\nthe whole time we've known each other\nmaybe that's a first session yeah so\nnowadays I've been on a chanting kick\nI've chanted with a couple of people how\ndo you feel about trying that I saw you\ndo with Lily by the way I love Lily and\nI'm really happy you talked to her and\nI'd love to see more of that yeah more\nmore of you talking to Lily I mean oh\nokay it made me happy\ngood I'm sorry do the chant again feels\nsuper awkward I like the whole thought\nprocess behind it was like that that she\nhas to overcome as our Curtis I like I\nlike that yeah so I think we're gonna or\nyou feel up to changing yeah let's do it\nokay on it so remember that chanting is\nand you guys should do this at home as\nwell so chanting is composed of three\nsyllables or we're gonna do own chanting\nso\n[Music]\nokay and thanks for the subs Andy\nMilonakis\nAndy Milonakis hmm I know him oh yeah so\nhe's a famous person right he is a\nfamous person he just gifted a bunch of\nsub so thank you very much man okay so\nwe're gonna do ohm Jan ting so I'm gonna\ndemonstrate one round and then I'm we're\ngonna do one round together and then I'm\ngonna hear you do one round\nokay so I'll demonstrate once\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\none round together\n[Music]\nI messed up at the Doublemint second but\nI got it now I get it okay so now let's\nsee here you do it on your own\nokay okay so I think the second two are\ncutting out just like they did with Lily\nwhich is fine\nso I'm gonna give you one or cutting\nhouse yeah they're cutting out so maybe\ntry to be louder the second thing is I\nwant you to open your mouth more so eyes\nnot I don't hear that everybody\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\nah\nbeautiful okay now eyes closed\nremember that chanting is about\nvibration not about sound so I want you\nto try to feel the vibration in your\nbody and I'm going to ask you reckful at\nthe end of it where you felt the\nvibration which part of your body so pay\nattention to the sound the the each\nsound is gonna feel slightly different\nin your body and we're gonna ask you\nabout that afterward we're gonna do five\nbreaths together okay\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\nagain\n[Music]\nagain\n[Music]\nokay I think I feel it here we're gonna\ndo two more\nno talking two more just hands down two\nmore so deep breath in\ntwo more after that\n[Laughter]\nOh\nlast one big deep breath\nOh\n[Music]\nand now sit with your eyes closed just\nfeel alright reckful come on back how do\nyou feel i I really drifted away during\nthat I was not so the first one I was\nself-conscious of giggling a bit in the\nnight I was gone I was just immersed in\nit which is surprising to me that I was\nable to do that ma'am yeah yeah how do\nyou feel\nI really enjoyed turning off my brain\nfor a bit we had talked and usually I\njust said I love stimulating\nconversation back and forth but then I\nfelt I felt burnt out and then\ntransitioning into consciousness without\nthought was amazing so I want you to do\nsomething\nI won't you just look at your face like\ngo back and watch the vaad and look at\nyour face now and look at your face at\nthe beginning of the interview you're\ncompatible give it it's gonna be happier\nyeah right yeah so you can be happy this\nway just give it give it some time I\nthink I can i yeah we can go more into\nthat later I think I think I can\ndefinitely the feelings of the fears of\nabandonment and the my desires might\nwhen I'm actually consciously thinking\nlife is a lot worse right now when I'm\nnot thinking it's pretty similar I mean\nI guess by definition which is what\nyou're trying to get me to the not\nthinking right yeah yeah yeah but my\nthoughts go in loops a lot more negative\nones if I'm thinking it's like there's\nthat analogy with the the sleds on the\nsnowy mountain you heard that one\noh maybe yeah I think yeah when when you\nyeah so this is the thing like I mean\nthe one I tell is the game trail so like\nyou know if you think about like a field\nand a deer walks across it like the\nwhole field is the same but the deer\nwalks across one path and that grass is\na little bit trampled and so the next\nanimal that goes by takes that path\nagain and it becomes a little bit more\ntrampled and then over time you develop\na trail and this trail is what your\nthoughts are following over and over\nyeah that's how your neurons work to\nthat once you get used to thinking in a\nparticular cycle like your thoughts like\nkind of they love going down that\npathway again how do we break how do we\nuntrim pull the grass or how do we break\nthese loops without medication so\nmedication doesn't break the loops let's\nstart there okay really so yeah so let's\njust think about it so if I were to if\nyou were to say let's say we have a\nfield of grass and we've have a game\ntrail because a thousand animals have\ngone down it and I were to ask you\nreckful how do we make a different game\ntrail\nwe'd have to repeat new thoughts in our\nhead over and over there it is so we\nactually think my people do the\ngratitude journals yeah a little bit\nmaybe yeah absolutely so I think that's\none reason they do grab it so I think\ngratitude is one way to do that but I\ncome on huh I just said talking to you\nis fun and so the other thing is we we\nthink about things in a new way right\nand once you learn something like once\nyou start like recognizing oh okay\nand I think you recognize\nthings within yourself so you recognize\nokay there's a thought my mind is about\nto go down this game trail but in uh you\nknow I've also started this other game\ntrail so let me see if I can redirect\ndown there\nthat's what reframing a cognitive bias\nis about so when people tell you like Oh\nreckful you're you're lonely and and you\nshould learn how to be independent and\nthen you beat yourself up for feeling\nlonely and you feel like you should be\nindependent because there are other\npeople who are your age and look at how\nindependent they are you all of your\nthoughts those are a bunch of game\nshells but then you say no hold on a\nsecond I'm different and and I I do feel\nlonely I'm allowed to feel lonely and\nI'm gonna feel lonely until I get enough\nlove I love it you telling me that's cuz\neveryone else has told me I've said in\nmy whole life\nyeah and how has that worked for you no\nno I'm good hahaha there we go yeah\nright so I I just I mean that's like the\nclinician within me says if you give\nsomeone a treatment for thirty years and\nit doesn't work maybe try something else\nyeah it's like the UH trying the same\nthing over and over is the definition of\ninsanity right so it doesn't work if at\nfirst you don't succeed\ndon't try try again try it a different\nway yeah and it in your case I don't\nthink I mean like it's not a complicated\npsychological thing I think you're just\nI mean maybe it is but like I think at\nthe end of the day like you just needed\nmore TLC than you got and it doesn't\nmean that your parents did a bad job or\nthat anyone else be tender love and care\ntender love and care\nand and you move our terminology reckful\nis that band TLC does that what it means\noh I don't know I don't know anything\nabout bands okay yeah anyway so any\nquestions for me before we wrap up\nspecific thoughts questions what do you\nthink about me on enough psilocybin\nwhat's your take on it I mean my take is\nthat you are where you are right now in\nan order for you so I mean I place a\nvalue judgment on psilocybin and\nsubstance use because of like my life\nbut I try not to judge other people like\nI don't know if I've shared this on\nstream but you know one of my patients\nwho has a lot of physical real problems\nlike confessed to me that they use\nmarijuana from time to time and they\nwere afraid that I would was gonna be\nupset because they like because I teach\nmeditation and yoga and they come to me\nto learn all this like healthy natural\nkind of stuff and I was like look you're\ndoing everything right you know you're\ngoing to you do yoga five days a week\nyou meditate every day you're eating\nhealthy and and sometimes life just\ngives you pain and if you're if you're\nsaying that you use marijuana from time\nto time like twice a month because there\nare just days where it just really\nreally sucks and you need a break like I\nthink you know that's fine like you have\nto decide for yourself\nyou know choices that I make in my life\nabout what I choose to use and the value\njudgments that I place or for me they're\nnot for you\nnow I think the only thing that I would\nreally oh wow so learn gifted just a\nbunch of subs so thank you very much\nlearn so the only thing that I would say\nfor you reckful is the only thing the\nonly mistake that I think you can truly\nmake is to not be reflective about it\nokay\nif you go through an honest process of\nexploring alternatives and seeing how\nthe way you feel and trying to live is\nsad reckful as opposed to happy reckful\nlike explore that and then come to your\nown conclusion and whatever conclusion\nyou come to I'm behind you just don't do\nit on autopilot that's the only thing\nthanks that had more of an emotional\nimpact than I was expecting\nsame I was in
