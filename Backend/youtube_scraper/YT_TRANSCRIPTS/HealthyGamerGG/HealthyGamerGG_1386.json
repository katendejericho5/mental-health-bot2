    "transcript": "oh no this is good that's great okay\nperfect\nso now I'm gonna ask you guys so we're\nso a big question is how do I figure out\nmy thermal right so people are asking\nthat and and so I want you guys to tell\nme we're gonna start with like what is\nwhat do you guys think my Darla's your\nDharma is to help other people figure\nout their Dharma okay what do you guys\nthink Jake you're you're typing with\nthem sorry my brother so what do you\nguys think is is my Dharma to help other\npeople figure out their Dharma I mean\nyou also have a duty to your family\nright at this point I'd like to raise\nyour children too\nyeah absolutely your wife absolutely\nokay so and then someone else said\nsomething like like before you know the\nn-bomb started flying somebody said\nsomething about I do you guys remember\nwhat that other dude said because that\nthat was like I thought a pretty good\nanswer no okay that's okay\nso what other people do other people\nthink that there's like an additional\nDharma about AoE hewing right and and\nyou've talked before about your your\nparticular mission to help people who\nhave suffered from video game addiction\nbecause you feel like other\npsychologists and particularly experts\nin the field have not been able to\naddress the problem hey sorry you guys\nhear me yep okay finally my mic was\nmalfunctioning yeah I was the one\nspeaking with you about Dharma early and\nwhat did you say so I think it's\nessentially again I'm really new to all\nthe vocabulary especially with you I\ndon't really know much about like can do\nspiritualism\nbut it's effectively like your greater\nsense of purpose in life your meaning\nyour sort of spiritual essence as well\nyeah sure great\nvery good inference so you said\nsomething else like what do you think my\nDharma is so I think that you have this\nplace in society now where we're\nencountering a lot of problems right now\nespecially with people being like very\nhedonistic in an irrational way people\nbeing very not nihilistic but just like\nirrationally\nconsidering like all the opportunities\nthey have in life and not really being\ncapable of dealing with the modern world\nand you're sort of here to help people\nsort that out because you've done it\nyourself how to deal with the modern\nworld and its lack of meaning okay so\nnow we're gonna check in with twitch at\nwhat do you guys think you guys think\nthese guys have a good sense of my\nDharma can we get like a thumbs up if\nyou think it's okay I know yeah so so\nthen the question becomes like how do\nyou guys think I got into this Tarbell\nlike how did I discover my Dharma\num well going in line with what I was\nsaying I think you have a lot of\npersonal experience with this and you'd\nlike to mirror it onto other people it's\njust a natural empathy response you know\nso you struggled a lot I'm assuming in\nthe earlier life you've talked about\nyour struggles in college and such and\nso overcoming those experiences was\nreally fulfilling and you want other\npeople to experience it it's kind of\nlike how xqc everyone likes him when he\nreacts to videos and you know you like\nsharing your ideas your thoughts your\nJoy's with other people it the same way\nso that's my idea yeah so okay so you're\nsaying that at the beginning there was\npersonal experience right and that these\nare related and that I had right so in\nthe past but how did I so at what point\nlike how did I get from personal\nexperience to my current Dharma so like\nI started playing video games like I\nfailed out and almost failed out of\ncollege you know when I was like 18 and\nit's been not that was 19 years ago so\nlike how did I get from here to here\nyou're spot-on dude that like my\npersonal experience is central to what I\ndo now so\nthat maybe we could conceptualize us as\nas your personal experience plus the\nrecognition of a need for sort of a hole\nto be filled okay\nso I I agree so wreck it all got how do\nI even boomer okay so recognition of a\nneed to be filled right so how does that\nhappen how does this happen so what with\nyou you said something more along the\nlines of your parents or your dad sort\nof kicked you to go to India yeah well\nthere yeah so was it that sort of like\nsupport structure that kicked you and\nmade you do that sort of the start of\nyour journey to transition absolutely\nright so that falls under personal\nexperience though right that has nothing\nto do with recognizing that the the\nmodern world has its has a lack of\nmeaning you with me yeah you're spot on\nthat that was crucial to my journey but\nthat was part of like making me who I am\nso then ones are the meditation itself\nnope\nright so meditation falls under this too\nso so you guys are saying that like okay\nnow I'm trying to help other people\nthat's my Dharma I agree a Oh a healing\nlack of like someone said something\nabout how young men are directionless in\nlife right now and so that might harm us\nto help them but how did I get from\nmeditating to in India to all of this\nstuff right so you can even say med\nschool Harvard and II it's a truth right\nthose are all personal experiences how\ndo this is this is the key thing you're\nall are spot-on recognition of a need to\nbe fulfilled yeah I'm sorry I really\ndon't understand the question that sorry\ndid you really I used to talk about how\nyour Dharma has changed and how you know\nso this is good I'm glad you cuz this is\nwhat everyone is missing when they think\nabout Dharma right so I want you guys to\nthink about so I was this person right\nthis is me like five years ago\nI was oh I know I know\nso for one I'm sure that you absorbed a\nlot of media and like from there you\nsort of derive like a lot of yourself so\nlike maybe you identified with\ncharacters in certain games maybe you\nidentified with like certain motifs and\nmovies and stuff and then like from\nthere you sort of derived like oh this\nis who I ought to be in life you know\nmaybe I want to be like this healer\ncharacter oh he'll be like this I don't\nknow that's nope that's actually\nincorrect right so the and it's it's a\nweird question I'm not trying to get you\nguys to feel stupid I'm really not but\nit's it's something that we've never\ntalked about on stream before and it's\nsomething that's a gaping hole when it\ncomes to Dharma so I'll tell you guys in\nthe moment that I realized that this is\na need that needs to be fulfilled so I\ndid I posted on reddit and I did an AMA\nlike back in 2000 19 or 18 I forget now\nbecause it's blurry I think September of\n2018 and after that AMA I decided oh\nthere's a need that needs to be\nfulfilled so what do you guys think like\nhow does doing an AMA result in my\nrecognition that a need has to be\nfulfilled you get a lot of response to\nthat AMA in both itself and in personal\nmessages afterwards and you realize it\nthat so you've talked about your\nexperience with a mentor of yours saying\nthat that the need to play video games\nis similar to they need to get a tattoo\nand that didn't make any sense to you so\nand then that combined with the fact\nthat gamers seem to mmm seem to mostly\nbe searching for some sort of help okay\nso spot-on right so like what do you\nguys think so from the other people who\nheard capture God's answer what do you\nguys think is the most important thing\nout of everything he said in terms of\nhelping me discover my Dharma didn't\nknow no people reaching out to you and\nyour your site into how many people\nneeded help so this is very important\nthis is karma okay so karma is karma\nwhich is the principle of cause and\neffect so in its simplest form is if I\nthrow up all\nup in the air the ball is gonna come\ndown that's just all that karma says but\nthe big thing that most people are\nmissing when it comes to their Dharma is\nthat Dharma is not a sole endeavor if no\none upvoted the ama and it just never\ngot any traction we would literally not\nbe here right now\nthe world has to give me something to\nlet me know what it wants you guys get\nthat like without this critical step if\nwe take this away this never gets\nconnected these two things never get\nconnected in addition to that in\naddition to that isn't there the the\nreckful interview which should give that\na lot of people want which specifically\nwanted to hear what you had absolutely\nright so just think about this for a\nsecond so if I'm sitting at home and I'm\ntrying to figure out my Dharma how\nsuccessful am I gonna be probably very\nunsuccessful but why\nwell because you know it's this\nprinciple of karma that you're talking\nabout now you're not getting positive\noutreach not getting any feedback that\nwill allow you to change anything here\nyes so now I'm gonna give you guys\nanother question so if I'm a doctor and\nI'm working in the emergency room how do\nI know what my Dharma on that shift is\nwhat's my time on that shift to have a\nmore firm and actually to serve other\npeople and help me so serve other people\nabstractly like am i sitting there and\nI'm saying specifically that you're\nassigned and how do but how do I know\nlike how do I figure out my Dharma huge\neat\nlike by their responses by what they\ntell somebody comes in and needs Oh\nexactly Jake exactly so you guys have to\nunderstand that Dharma is not a sole\npursuit right Dharma is about what the\nworld tells you it needs so if someone\ncomes in after a motor vehicle accident\nthat is a different Dharma from someone\ncoming in because they're having an\nallergic reaction\nmy daughter Maude depends on what the\nworld sends my way and this is the thing\nthat everyone is currently missing\nbecause I haven't explained it because\nwe just haven't gotten that far but it's\namazing that we're able to get here\nbecause I get thousands of questions\nabout how do I find my Dharma and I'm\ntrying to I don't know how to explain to\npeople besides doing something like this\nthat you guys understand so my Dharma is\nclear but who discovered my Dharma was\nit something that I found out like by\nmyself world discovery Dharma for you\nyes right that my Dharma is is a is a a\nmeeting between who I am and what the\nworld asks of me that's Donna so if you\nthink about Rosa Parks or MLK or Mahatma\nGandhi right these are people that were\njust like certain like or relatively\nlike normal people because at the end of\nthe day we're all normal people and then\nthe world shows up and ask something of\nyou and then the question is are you\nprepared to actually do it yes so what\nif you're not prepared so then what do\nyou got where do you think you should\nstart now let's go back in time and you\nguys be my teacher and you take 18 year\nold me who's failing out of college and\nI come to you guys and I say what is my\nDharma and what do you tell me it's\nimpossible to know honestly can I like\npose a question because I don't know if\nI fully understand the concept here sure\ndo you think that like your purpose in\nlife your Dharma is what you call it is\nnecessarily dependent on what society\ndemands of you and like what people like\nand the reason I say this is because so\nmany of the people that I admire and\nlook up to especially in history they're\nthey seem to be like totally independent\nfrom their time right so like so many\ngreat artists and stuff they weren't\nmaking art to make other people happy\nthey made it to make their like own\nSouls fulfilled I don't know yeah that's\na great question so I think that that it\nI don't think that your Dharma has to\ncater to what society wants I think that\nin that moment they were doing their\nDharma because actually what society\nneeded especially if you look at\nsomething like art the whole point about\nwhy important art is important is\nbecause it changes and pushes society\nforward right it's not accepting where\nsociety is it's pushing things forward\nif we think about what my Dharma is it's\npushing things forward and karma doesn't\nhave to be grandiose because you guys\nlike you know I'm glad someone mentioned\nthis because at the end of the day if I\nhad to rank my Dharma this is how I do\nit right and then this is two plus so\nlike so what about the people that\nhundreds of millions of people that we\nare not going to have a huge impact on\nthe world so that's the thing is people\nare confusing Dharma with like grand\nthings but karma is not grandiose and\nthat's just because the examples that we\nuse tend to be grandiose like Rosa Parks\nor MLK or whatever right like AoE\nhealing but you guys have to understand\nthat like that doesn't my first term Oz\nto my family and the only reason that my\nDharma got big is because the world\nasked it of me but at the end of the day\nlike this in this if we take this out\nand we delete all this that's enough\nright it's enough for me to just be a\ndoctor and try to help people who come\ninto my office with depression every day\nit's enough to like raise my kids and\nraise them to be decent human beings\nit's enough that's something you're\ngonna have to figure out on your own but\nI don't want to I don't want to keep\nbutting in but go for it I'm just like\nvery concerned that this all seems like\ntoo much like adherent to society in a\nway that I think could be really\nnegative like for instance you put like\nfamily up there's number one I don't\nhave a very strong connection to my\nfamily and I think disconnecting myself\nfrom my family has actually been like\none of the best things that I've had to\ndo in my life so instead of like\ndeveloping my sense of meaning from\nother people around me ask of me I think\nrationally like about like oh what are\nthe things I enjoy to do most in life\nwhat do I think people need the most in\nlife I don't let other people make that\nfailing for me\nI sort of like derive it on my own using\nlike logic and reason is that like I\ndon't know you might be saying the same\nthing but phrasing it differently just\ntell me about it yeah so I think that's\na great thing because here's the thing I\nhad a loving family right digital\ndystopia you did not so like how many\npeople out there do you think have a\nloving family like what percent on\npeople\nit depends obviously on the location but\nI mean like half the people are divorced\nnow right I'm pretty sure like that's\nway less than what it should so we\ntalked earlier about how my personal\nexperience\nhelps me do a Oh a healing at this point\nso when it comes to someone who has a\nbroken family who do you think has a\nbetter\ngarma in order to help them me or you I\ndon't know I really can answer\nuse I mean you because you're more\nestablished in your in a situation in\nyour life where you can't help them\ncomfortably right so I think that if\ndigital dystopia thinks that like so I\nI'm not saying that family should be at\nthe top of everyone's Therma that's just\nthat what's at the top of mine because\nI've chosen to have a family and in your\ncase your experiences are different and\nif you don't want to live based on\nsociety what society is telling you I\nthink that's fantastic I think that's\npart of your Dharma I think part of your\nDharma is to figure out okay for all the\npeople out there for whom society's\nformulas do not work you can be an\nexample to those people yeah you can\nhelp me those people it's not Dharma\nthat's bothering me it's Karma because\nyou were telling me you have to derive\nyour Dharma from like what other people\nare demanding what other people are\ntelling you and sometimes what other\npeople demand is wrong and it's not\nactually good and right absolutely right\nso when Rosa Parks was sitting at the\nfront of the bus sorry I don't know how\nmuch you guys know about like the\nAmerican civil rights movement garma was\ntelling her you got to go sit at the\nback of the bus because you're black\nthat's what society was asking her what\ndid she do\nyes she sat in the front because\nobviously it was better for society in\nthe long term it's irrational in the\nservice so she decided that I'm gonna\nsay I'm gonna flip the middle finger to\nsociety and I'm gonna do what I want\nbecause I think it is your I think it is\nright and what I'm hearing you say\ndigital dystopia is that like you are\ndoing that same thing you are not\ntrusting society you are not trusting\nsociety's values and you are figuring\nout your own way forward and that is an\nincredibly important journey not only\nfor yourself but I suspect for other\npeople should karma show up one day and\nsomeone is gonna ask you for help you're\ngonna open your mouth one day and people\nare gonna be listening and then\nsomeone's gonna be like hey man I really\nliked what you said can you tell me a\nlittle bit about like how you learned\nhow you figured that out\nthat's your so your your suggestion to\npeople who are in very toxic situations\nwith their family or with their loved\nones or whatever is to just focus on\nthemselves and and be as morally right\nas they can be and the people in their\nlife will eventually\ncome along no no I mean so I think I\nagree with everything except for the\nlast part right so doing your Dharma if\nyou're in a family situation that sucks\nI think it is important to do your\nDharma in that family situation but this\nis where doing your Dharma in the family\nsituation doesn't mean repairing the\nfamily sometimes like you have a Dharma\nto yourself and you haven't ARMA to your\nfamily and there's a difference between\ndoing the best that you can and then\nletting them go if they're not willing\nto meet you halfway and like sacrificing\neverything that you are to make your\nfamily happy which I don't think is a\ngood idea\nright so I think doing your Dharma is\nnot about a particular outcome it's like\nokay I gave so my family is [ __ ] up\nand I did the best that I could to like\nreally try to make a relationship with\nthem but my dad is narcissistic and my\nmom has borderline personality disorder\nand they're just not willing to meet me\nhalfway then you let them go and you go\non and you live your own life and you\nfind someone that you care about and you\nbuild your own family of people that\nyou're loyal to you cannot fix your\nfamily dynamics and it is not karma is\nnot about an outcome it's about your\nactions right did you do enough and if\nyou did enough you should be able to\nwalk away without regret you walk away\nwith peace you say you know I did the\nbest that I could but like it takes it\ntakes two to make a relationship work\nantara is about doing your part and once\nyou walk away for the next five years\nyou tell yourself okay on Christmas in\ntheir birthday I'm gonna call them and\nI'm gonna send them a card and you you\nset that up in your mind you say that's\nwhat I'm gonna do and over the next five\nyears you do that thing and you stick to\nyour Dharma and they never call you on\nyour birthday and they never send you a\ncard on year six done you did your part\nand you walk away with it peacefully\nthat makes okay I have a slight question\nand this is gonna be controversial go\nfor it\nso so what about how do you know that\nyour Dharma is right so the the\nsituation I'm thinking of is a person\nwho believes that their Dharma is to\nconvince the world that races should not\nbe equal something like that right which\nis going to be very controversial but\nsomebody could potential\nbelieve that and believe it very\nstrongly and believe that that is their\nDharma so how can you tell if that's the\nwrong thing to be doing great question\nso let me put it to you this way uh when\nwhenever we think things we think we're\nright right like so like I wouldn't say\nthat okay so I think you're in the\nminority but generally speaking when our\nmind comes to a conclusion most people\nrespond to that conclusion as if it's\ncorrect like when I walk to the bathroom\nI have the assumption that if I flood\nlike pull the handle on the flush that\nthe toilet will flush and I operate\nthrough my day in most of the time like\nmy mind is like giving me off like\nhypotheses which I just sort of trust to\nbe correct and most human beings think\nthat their thoughts are correct I'd say\nit depends but in general I'll follow\nyou and say yeah yeah so I think it's\ngood for you to say that you don't think\nthat way because but I think that's rare\nI think if you just like go on Reddit\nand you post an opinion most of the\nresponses that you're gonna get on\nreddit are not gonna have like some\ndegree of self reflection they're gonna\nhave people telling you that that you're\nwrong in there right right and to be\nclear my question is oriented towards\nthe direction of how do you convince\nthose people who you believe are clearly\nin the wrong but they believe they're\nclearly in the that okay so I'm their\nDharma correct because it applies to\nthem like if they honestly believe that\nthey should pursue this like racist\nideal is that actually their Dharma even\nthough it's objectively bad for society\nbut they okay if it's correct you're\nchanging the question Captagon\nthe question that you asked is if I\nbelieve something how do I know that my\nDharma is correct that's different from\nif I believe if someone else believes\nsomething is correct how do I convince\nthem otherwise those are two separate\nquestions right no I don't think they\nare I think they are so I think figuring\nout your Dharma is very different from\nconvincing someone else of their Dharma\none is subjective one relates to another\nhuman being do you with me um I think it\ndepends on how you classify ideas that's\nnot bullying you if you treat all ideas\nas equal to begin with and then evaluate\nthem sort of depending on their validity\nthey're the result they give then you\ncan come to different different\nconclusions than if you try to take a\nmoral stance okay I I don't know what\nyou just said you just lost me but I'm\ngonna try to I'm not sure either so okay\nso so this is what I understood your\nfirst question to be let's say that I\nbelieve I haven't ARMA and that that\nadharma is negative or positive how do I\nknow whether like my Dharma how do I\nobjectively reflect upon whether my\nDharma is correct or incorrect that's\nwhat I understood your first question to\nbe it wasn't about changing anyone's\nmind about anything it was about like\nintrospection and figuring out your own\nkarma right I guess it's that there are\ndifferent sets of ideas which appear to\nbe self-evident if you believe in them\nand if you fall within one of these sets\nof ideas then you can believe one thing\nto be morally right sure whereas another\nset of ideas will have that thing to be\nmorally abhorrent fine so capture God\nthe question that so you're talking\nabout something that sounds a little bit\nphilosophical my main question for you\nis I heard two separate questions one is\nabout within you and one is you\ninteracting with another human being\nwhatever constructive ideas or whatever\nyou want to talk about is fine but like\ndo you see that those are fundamentally\ndifferent things that when I figure out\nfor myself and be trying to convince the\nworld of something else\nthose are like different endeavors sort\nof I seem is different\nokay so like what I'm talking about is\nis figuring something out for yourself\nand trying to convince another human\nbeing are like two completely different\nthings like to me those are\nfundamentally different and I'm just\ntrying to get a sense of whether yeah\nit's it's a two-way relationship you\nknow like right there's a but this way\ncapture God there's a difference between\nme figuring out what do I want to eat\nfor dinner tonight and me convincing my\nwife that we should eat something else\nright right so I guess my my my main\nthing that I'm latching on to for no\nparticular reason is that there are\ndifferent sets of ideas in the world and\nnot necessarily that you should try and\nconvince someone else of their ideas or\nnot not that usually convince someone\nelse that your ideas are correct over\ntheirs but rather how do you how do you\nmake those ideas fit with each other how\nhow is there some sort of one dharma\nwhereas there are a lot of different\nideas in the world there isn't one\nDharma okay so I I really don't I think\nyou're you're I don't know what you're\nso I hear what you're saying I think\nit's it's a slightly separate direction\nfrom when where I was hoping to go sure\nI'm just raising questions that I think\nwill be relevant yeah I appreciate you\nraising the questions but I mean I think\nthe first question you asked was the\nclosest to the relevance of what we're\ntalking about is like which i think is\nlike how do you know whether your dharma\nis correct dr. kay can I ask a very\nessential question to this sure okay\nthis is like really the crux to my my\ndiscussion here at all I might be\njumping the gun here but like what's the\nutility of the karma aspect I think\nthat's a prime aspect where you get the\nadmiration of other people because like\nI've lived my life thinking that I have\nto make up my goal is totally\nindependently from the others around me\nand that's like what I seem to hear from\nbasically everyone right that you want\nto derive your own purpose from reality\nnot that like you want to let other\npeople influence you but that you use\nyour mind your reasoning your logic to\nfigure out what you enjoy most and then\nyou pursue that what's the utility of\nlike\nallowing other people to determine that\nfor you partially yes so I I don't I I\ndon't I sort of disagree with the\npremise of your question so the first\nthing is use the word admiration as a\ncorrelation with government right karma\nis not about admiration as nothing that\nadmiration is about ego so I don't think\nthat you should develop your Dharma\nbased on the admiration of others I\nthink you should develop your Dharma\nbased on Karma which is your\ncircumstance so in my case you know when\nI did the reddit AMA like people said\nlike hey so I mean I definitely got an\nego boost from it but then I noticed\nthat ego and I was kind of like okay at\nthe end of the day like let's just set\nthe ego aside a lot of people think I'm\nsmart that's kind of cool but if I stop\nand really think and I set my ego aside\nthe bigger issue is that a lot of people\nneed help and I don't think that has\nanything to add narration I think it's\njust like they need help and so that\ndrove me feel like you're determining\nthat on your own you're not determining\nthat because you're like because you\nknow like you're determining whether\npeople actually have a demand for\nsomething totally independently right so\nRosa Parks made the decision\nindependently that racism yes and even\nhas a sequencer did okay but you're\nstill saying that I mean what if someone\nthis might sound crazy but like what if\nsomeone doesn't really find much\npleasure in like serving others in this\nway yeah that's fine that's that's okay\nlike I'm not trying to attribute a value\njudgement towards doing something I\nthink we're getting a little bit I\nappreciate y'all's questions I'm I love\nthese kinds of discussions but I'm\nwondering if like we're going a little\nbit too far afield of the main topic\nwhich is how good and yes let me just a\nlittle cab on screen yeah sure so let me\njust try to let me try to just summarize\nbecause I think you guys basically gave\nI mean I'm not trying to say y'all are\nallowed to give me the answers that I\ndon't want but I think you guys you guys\nfilled in the main gap which I think you\nguys did a good job of okay see that\nhelps a lot now it's duty it's not I\nthought it was purpose in like your\nindividual sense no so so and I think\nhere's the main thing to remember so if\nyou're looking for your Dharma the first\nphase is to prepare\nright so this is what brahmacari ashram\nmeans it's like to be a student so you\ndon't know what life is gonna throw at\nyou you don't know what life is gonna\ndemand a view or in digital dystopias\ncase you don't know what you're gonna\ndemand of yourself right and so you\ndon't know like ten years from now if\nyou come to a particular conclusion that\na certain thing is good or a certain\nthing is bad you need to prepare\nyourself for that eventualities so\neveryone's first thought MA is to\nthemselves that you should learn and\ngrow and understand how you work and\nformulate thoughts about who you believe\nwho you are what you believe the rest of\nthe world is and to prepare and this\nisn't just this doesn't mean getting a\ndegree it doesn't mean becoming a doctor\nit doesn't like I'm not trying to put a\nvalue judgment on helping other people\nor things like that\nbecause at the end of the day there are\npeople who become monks and go and sit\nin a cave in the Himalayas for their\nentire life and that's their hanuman\nthey're not helping anyone they're just\nhanging out there because that's what\nthey've determined they need to do in\ntheir life I do not judge them I do not\nsay that my Dharma is better than theirs\nso your Dharma does change over time\nthough absolutely because okay just like\nI said no it didn't and so I was\nconfused and then I had to listen for a\nwhile to see like why house yeah I was\nokay but I'm back on it and then what\nhappens as you prepare life is gonna\nsend you some stuff right if you\ninteract with the world life is gonna\nsend you things like it's gonna give you\nbosses it's gonna give you job\nopportunities it's gonna give you family\nmembers it's gonna give you friends and\nsometimes in my case it's gonna give you\nthe Internet that wants to know more\nabout what you think and then you have\nto rise to that challenge but that's\ndetermined by karma and everyone's got\namaz different right so my Dharma is\ndetermined by my Karma but digital\ndystopias karma is different his family\nis different his upbringing is different\nhis skills are different that's all\nencapsulated with Dharma that\ncircumstance that is your Karma\nyes chad is my karma oh and then what\nhappens is if you're thoughtful you come\nup with your Dharma\nso this Terramax I had before I had this\none right so so like a Oh a healing is\nlike a relatively recent thing but I had\nit when I first came back in 2015 and\nthen the reddit was in 2018 and so your\nthought about changes over time\nand so absolutely so I'd say that the\nfirst thing that you guys need to do if\nyou're looking for your entitlement is\nprepare just understand that it doesn't\nmatter what life throws at you if you're\nphysically fit you're gonna be better at\nit if you're mentally fit you're gonna\nbe better at it that you should learn as\nmuch as you can you want to learn coding\ngo for it because if you learn coding\nthat may influence your government and\none day you may have the opportunity to\ndevelop an app but that's only gonna\nwork if you learned how to code and the\nother way to think about it is like now\npeople are asking me for help and like\nthat depends on this if I had not done\nthese things I wouldn't be able to help\nanyone\nor maybe I would but the capacity that I\nhave to help is determined by my\nexperiences and is determined by what I\ndo and also the shortcomings that I have\nbecause I'm not able to help everyone\nright there are some people that are not\ngonna understand what I'm saying or not\ngonna agree with what I'm saying and\nthat's perfectly fine I'm not saying I'm\nright but that I'm gonna have\nlimitations too because I can't do\neverything and that's determined because\nwhen I was in India at the end of the\nday like after I came back from India\nand I was in the u.s. I still played\nWarcraft 3 I still play dota if I had\nstudied harder maybe I would be able to\nlike do a better job today on stream if\nI had studied harder at any point I\ncould have done a better job with any of\nthe people that I've talked to it's\npossible but at this point I think the\nmain thing you need to do is prepare\nprepare the third strength-building for\nthe raid and it doesn't because here's\nthe thing if you guys are playing the\ngame of life it doesn't matter\nlike what you are like ultimately when\nyou play a game you have to play the\ncharacter that you're playing so like\nlevel up your character because the rest\nof it is all circumstance whether you're\na doctor an engineer a monk a father\na truck driver it doesn't matter at the\nend of the day you still are like\ncontrolling player1 right so we're gone\nplayer 1 that's Dharma number 1 it's\nlike make player 1 level up player 1 the\nbest that you can and then yes yeah so I\nrecently found myself in a situation\nwhere I think my Dharma has changed or\nI've gotten a new responsibility per se\nI don't have the background to deal with\nthat is it now my like responsibility if\nthis is something that I want to do to\nprepare to go through those steps or\nshould I push them off to someone who\nyou know might have uh who might be able\nto help them now I'm gonna let the rest\nof the people in the in in this\ndiscordant I'll try okay so I mean this\nis from a totally outside perspective\nwith like no connection to like Hindu\nspiritualism or anything just like\nwhenever you encounter a new challenge\nin life right you want to gradually\nbuild up your strength so that you can\novercome it eventually right so take\nincremental steps to like improve your\nability to cope with it right now and\nobviously don't expect perfection of\nyourself immediately so I don't know for\ninstance if you're putting like a huge\nsocial environment like maybe you go to\ncollege and you're struggling to be\noutgoing well maybe the first day you\nshould look and you smile and wave at\npeople but that's it and then the next\nday or like a few days later you can\nmove that up to like starting new\nconversations with people and eventually\nyou can become totally socially that\nit's just self-improvement\ndoes that answer your question flapjack\nuh yeah a little bit I mean it does have\nan answer and passion what was that what\ndo you say I'm just wondering if someone\nelse has an answer for flapjacks\nquestion I think flap said something but\nI cut off oh I was just talking you know\nthat this this is a background I think I\nwould want to pursue so what you're\nsaying makes sense just like slowly\nlevel up but I'm wondering if it's worth\nit to just sort of drop what I'm doing\nand really try to go that well what do\nyou want do you want to achieve it or\nnot that's what you have to determine\nand you can only determine that like\nthrough really really critical thinking\nmaybe meditation you know I'm like more\nof a secular person this so I don't\nreally suggest that stuff as much but\njust like you know consider the things\nyou value most figure out what you like\nin life what you don't like and it's\nit's a tough decision but you have to\ntake risks like this in life so either\nyes or no either you know I'm going to\npursue this goal or not\nlet's see you so I said go for it\ncapture gun well I think it depends on\nexactly what we're talking about but it\nsounds like there's sort of a family\nmembers in need or someone closer yours\nin need who you feel like you could help\nbut if you do so it might be at the cost\nof your own personal development is that\nsound correct at all yes I mean that's\nactually pretty spot-on and I've\nactually already taken steps I think I\nhad contacted dr. K on reddit earlier\nthis week asking like how to become a\nrecovery coach just say well I want to\nlike take steps toward down that path if\nI can and the only thing I'm not a\npsychologist and I'm not qualified to\ntalk about this but I think the only\nthing that really matters is helping\npeople understand themselves and sort of\nin order to do that you have to be able\nto understand them okay I think that\nnecessarily confliction I want to just\njump in for a second because I need to\nget going first in a few minutes but\nfirst of all I think this is great that\nyou guys are have\nthis discussion and I think this is why\nwe built this discord right so like for\npeople to work through their Dharma to\nask questions of each other to help\nsupport each other I'll sort of offer\none or two kind of last thoughts and\nthen I'm gonna bounce but you guys by\nall means can continue the discussion\nthe first talking on stream no I'm gonna\nstop the stream but you guys the first\nthing is that you know if you're not in\na position to help someone cut yourself\nsome slack\nbut at the same time that maybe your\nkarma telling you that you should\nprepare in a particular way right so I\nthink if you want to like do something\nand you feel like okay I really do want\nto help this person but I'm not able to\nthat's not your fault that you can't\nhelp them the last thing is I generally\ntend to avoid statements like drop\nthings entirely because I think usually\nthere's some middle road so I just be\ncareful about that like you could\nprobably do more than one thing at once\nand sacrifice is oftentimes you know it\nshould be the last resort not the first\nresort but I think it's great that you\nguys are thinking about this the last is\nthere was one question that people were\nasking about like how do you know if\nyour Dharma is right or comes from a\ngood place and I thought capture or my\ninterpretation of capture God's question\nI thought was a good one which doesn't\nmean that his wasn't a good one it's\njust I liked his question because it's\none that I wanted to answer we need to\nmisinterpret but I was trying to be yeah\nso how do you know whether your Dharma\nis like right or wrong like if I'm a\nracist and I think that like you know\ngenocide needs to happen for a\nparticular race how do I know whether\nthat Dharma is correct or incorrect and\nI think this is an excellent question\nbecause it comes down to how do you know\nwhen to trust your mind or to not trust\nyour mind so your mind comes up with\nconclusions all the time about what you\nshould or shouldn't do but how do you\nknow whether that like whether to trust\nwhat your mind is telling you or not\ntrust what your mind is telling you and\nI think the short answer is you have to\nfigure out like where you got that\nbelief and for a lot of people who want\nto hurt the world or do damage to other\npeople\ntheir beliefs about inequality or that\nthings should be a particular way or\nrooted an anger and in turn that anger\nis oftentimes rooted in hatred I'm sorry\nthe angers we didn't hurt so people who\nI've noticed that a lot of people who\nhate in the world have liked like the\nsource of their hatred is some kind of\nhurt and until you fully understand and\nexplore that I don't think that you can\nreally understand your karma and\ngenerally speaking I think people who\ndetermined that they're their course in\nlife is based out of being hurt in some\nway you've got to be really careful with\nthat because I don't think that's a calm\nor clear mind that's making that\ndecision okay I was just gonna say like\nit's not necessarily true I think you\nactually said this yourself that like\nsomething rooted in hate is necessarily\nlike irrational because I think like a\nlot of the things in my life that are\nrooted in I mean not hatred for other\npeople but like hatred of some aspect of\nreality like those are some of the\nthings I'm most proud than that like\ngive me the greatest sense of purpose in\nlife so it's not just the source but\nlike it's whether it's rationally\ndeveloped from that source of what\nyou're saying yeah so you should reflect\nand understand I mean I I think I think\ndigital to Sophie I think you know\nyou're you're you you sort of set up a\ncircumstance or you're describing a\ncircumstance of your life in the way\nthat you approach things that I think\nare a little bit unique which is cool\nbut I think in general what I would tell\npeople is if you're trying to understand\nwhether your Dharma is correct or\nincorrect try to try to find like the\nthe origin of where you got the idea\nthat you're thinking about pursuing and\nif you reflect upon that goes if you\nreflect on it and then you decide okay\nthis is like this is the result of like\nhatred or this is the result of like\nrational thought or this is the result\nof X Y or Z then then you'll kind of\nknow how to move forward and this is\nsomething that even I struggle with\nbecause I'm trying to understand like\nwhat is my Dharma to like the people on\nStreet like what should I do with my\nlife now because I have a job I have a\nfamily how do i reconcile the Dharma's\nthat I clearly have to my patience with\nthe Dharma's that I have for like twitch\nand streaming and helping all these\npeople because there's ego and what I've\ndiscovered is that there's ego there\nright so part of when I say oh I want to\nquit my job and I went stream full time\nego is a big part of that because I get\nloved through stream in a way and by\nmany more people than I get loved in\nregular life and so I should be careful\nabout what I determine my Dharma to be\nas long as that ego is active so what's\nthe calculation or whatever you do to\nfigure out what you ought to do then I\nmean so I think so I use a systematic\nprocess of you know things like\nmeditation to reflect within myself and\nsee where the origin of things are\ncoming from and the more that I align\nwith helping an individual person or\njust doing the best that I can on a day\nthat's what I really go for so it's not\nabout whether a streamer is big or small\nlike we struggle with this um in terms\nof like okay if a big streamer comes on\nlike what do we do do we bump someone\nelse who is on our schedule do we push\nthem back like how do we do that like\nwhat feels good about that what feels\nbad about that how much of that has to\ndo with like you know ego and all kinds\nof things so I think it's an ongoing\nprocess there isn't a simple answer I\nthink the main thing is that you kind of\ngo back to this which is training\nyourself right training yourself to\nunderstand things training yourself to\nunderstand yourself studying different\nkinds of texts whether they be man's\nsearch for meaning by Viktor Frankl or\nthe Mahabharat or a Harry Potter to like\ngo and learn from different places and\nthings and like try to like figure out\nhow what your compass is gonna be based\non and the more that you learn about\nyourself and the more that you acquire\nfrom the rest of the world like lead\ncounter Montecristo if you want to talk\nabout Dharma and the struggles with what\nyou should do like read count of\nMontecristo it's an amazing book read\nthe maha part learn about this stuff\nbecause it is an individual journey for\neveryone and no one has all the answers\nleast of all me yeah exactly yeah\nexactly I think that's something really\nimportant to mention I don't want to be\nrude but like it seems like in a lot of\ntimes I'm like discordant which it seems\nlike a lot of people are developing this\nsort of like I don't want to be rude but\nlike cult of personality sort of around\nyou we're like oh what you're saying is\nthe necessary and proper guide to them\nit's like what happened with Jordan\nPeterson I think it can be really toxic\nso I'm glad you're taking steps to kind\nof that\nokay thanks for the feedback all right\nso thank you guys very much I'm gonna go\nahead and sign off discord but thank you\nguys for hopping on and appreciate the\ndiscussion and you know I'm curious what\npeople thought like how did that go\nis that good do you guys want to do that\n[Music]\nlike do you guys want to hop on discord\nfrom time to time like if it seems like\na good thing to do"
