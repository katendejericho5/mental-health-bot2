    "transcript": "so how do you make yourself\nuncomfortable enough to facilitate\nchange I don't think the challenge is in\nmaking yourself uncomfortable although\nyou can say that discomfort is a good\nindicator for change so in my experience\nthe process of change itself is\nuncomfortable and is like hard right so\nlike I'll give you guys an example so\nwhat I was telling crucify think the\nchallenge like it's kind of weird that\nwhen he starts to make progress he\nstarts to feel depressed and suicidal\nlike what is up with that right like how\ndoes that work and I'm sorry guys but\nthat's just how our mind works our mind\nprefers the comfortable to the good this\nis important to understand your mind\nprefers that which you know to that\nwhich is good so if you think about why\nare people in abusive relationships like\npeople who get into abusive\nrelationships often times get into\nanother abusive relationship they have\nstrings of abusive relationships and\nit's because it's something that they're\nfamiliar with it's comfortable even if\nit's painful it's comfortable and so for\ncrucifix and the pain that he inflicts\nupon himself if he doesn't do anything\nthat he knows he can with saying that he\nknows he can survive it even though it\nmakes him depressed he can survive it\nwhat he doesn't know is what's gonna\nhappen if he gives it as all what's\ngonna happen if he actually tries\nbecause he has these aspirations and if\nhe starts working at a call center he's\nnot moving towards his aspirations is\nworking at a call center the same as\ngiving up on his aspirations that's the\nchallenge he has to face so you know my\nsense is that you try to change and then\nyou notice that when you try to make a\nchange you start to become uncomfortable\nright that's that's the issue\nokay I identify a lot with cruces\nproblems I read and research a lot about\ndiet but I still fall into the pit of\ngrabbing the comfort foods off the store\nshelf even though I try not to keep it\nin my house I still go to the\ndrive-through two to three times a week\neven though I have good food at home and\nhaven't done anything to really earn it\nokay so I think that this is a problem\nonce again of like minut understanding\nso when we think about crucifix gives us\nthe big picture and the big picture is\nokay I make progress and then I give up\nand then one day I go to work and I want\ny'all to just think about this\nso he's like one day I go to work I do\nit for a week and then I just quit but\nwhen did cruces to something new about\nhimself when did we make progress it\nwasn't looking at day seven it wasn't\nlooking at the end it was looking at day\nthree it was looking at like what\nhappens to him when he starts to make a\nchange and then he's like wait wait a\nminute when I start to make a change I\nstart to actually like feel more\ndepressed like the more the better I do\nfor myself the more I feel depressed and\nthat's not something that he saw because\nhe was looking at the end result he was\nlooking at the end right it's kind of\nlike saying I mean what's that you know\nit's sort of like if my house burns down\nI can say like oh my house burned down\nbut like when the house is fully on fire\nand you're saying like my house keeps\nburning down like that's not the problem\nthe problem is like first of all where\ndid the fires start and secondly like\nhow did the fire spread so the question\nI mean so this person says I identify a\nlot with cruces problems I read and\nresearch a lot about diet yeah that's\nintellectual I still fall into the pit\nof grabbing comfort fruits off the store\nshelf even though I try not to keep it\nin the house so the question is like\nwhat happens in that moment right the\nquestion is when you go to the grocery\nstore how are you feeling how hungry are\nyou like that's where the money is what\nmindset are you in when you go to the\ngrocery store is it like advertising\nthat suckers you in what I still go to\nthe drive-through two to three times a\nweek even though I have good food at\nhome the question is like what happens\nbefore you're at the drive-through\nare you at home and then you're like I\ndon't want to eat any of this and then\nyou get up and you go to the drive-thru\nare you driving home from work and you\nsee it you're feeling hungry because you\nskipped lunch that day and then you kind\nof like pick something up right that's\nwhere the money is so you've got to like\nreally and this is what I was saying the\ncrucifix you have to you need\nunderstanding understanding and\nawareness awareness of what is going on\ninside you because what I'm hearing is\nthe end result I'm not hearing the\nprocess and if you want to make a change\nin your life it's not about focusing on\nthe end result you have to make a change\nin the process if you want a different\noutcome you need to change your process\nthere's no process in this question so\nthat's what you need to look at look\ninto right where is that where did it's\nwhere did the decision to make bad food\nstart did it start by skipping lunch did\nit start start by skipping dinner and\ndid it start by working too much did it\nstart by not packing your bag to start\nby not waking up early enough where did\nthat start didn't start because you are\nin love with someone and they don't text\nyou back it can start in all kinds of\nplaces right so you have to look at\nwhere the process starts and how it\nprogresses that's how you make a change\nin the end how can you overcome the ego\nthat arises within great question so the\nfirst thing is to recognize what is ego\nand what is not ego right so in it as we\nsaw today like arrogance what we think\nof as standard arrogance like if someone\nis nice to other people in kind and\ncompassionate we think of that person is\nnot arrogant but that person still has\nego and that's because our understanding\nof the word ego is not as good as like\nwhat the Yogi's understood right there\nare subtle kinds of ego there are\ndifferent kinds of ego is the first\nthing that you've got to do is recognize\nwhen your ego is active right recognize\nwhen you have thoughts of I'm too good\nfor this or I'm better than other people\nso here this the here of the clues of\nego ego pumps yourself up and knocks\nother people down and ego makes\ncomparisons so anytime you make a\ncomparison between two people that's ego\nso the first thing you've got to do is\nsee it arising\nso see it arising and then notice it and\nthen as you notice it you begin to get\nthis capacity of saying oh that's my ego\nI'm not gonna do that right but you\ncan't do that if you're on autopilot\nlike you have to notice it and say like\noh that's my anxiety like I know you\nguys have done this where everyone's\ndone this where it's like I don't want\nto jump in the water and I'm anxious\nthat I'm gonna feel cold and you\nacknowledge that you don't want to jump\nin the water and then you're like okay\ntime to jump into the water like you can\nseparate a part of your mind aside and\nchoose to act independently of it but\nyou can't do that without the separation\nso you've got to do that thank you for\nthe host Melina so okay do people I\nguess I okay so the other thing about\nego let me just do a quick introduction\nbecause we have a host so my name is all\nakeno's I'm a psychiatrist practicing in\nin Boston Massachusetts this is a\nhealthy gamer GG stream our goal is to\nhelp people understand themselves better\nand therefore like make improvements in\ntheir lives so we do interviews we talk\na lot about some kind of psychology\nspirituality things like that and we\nalso like I teach meditation on stream\nbecause I think that's important and\ntoday we had an interview about sort of\nsomeone who felt super stuck in life and\nfelt like they quote/unquote suck at\nlife and how they couldn't do anything\nwell they weigh like 500 pounds and\nthey're not able to lose weight and\nthings like that and what we kind of\ntunnel down to is that he's got some\ninteresting patterns of wanting to stay\nstuck and that he actually has a problem\nwith his ego so right now we're kind of\ntalking about ego and what that means so\nthe other thing about ego this is\nanother cure for ego is spend time in\nnature so you guys have to understand\nthat when you ego relies on comparison\nright so like when when like when\ncrucifies making a statement he's like\noh yeah I'm a nobody like that's an ego\nstatement that's coming from his ego\nbecause he's he's comparing himself to\nother people so if you want to get away\nfrom comparing yourself to other people\nwhat you need to do is get away from\npeople so when you spend time in nature\nlike that's not going to build ego\nthat's gonna build confidence and\nconfidence and ego are actually like on\na seesaw so the more confident you are\nthe less your ego is active and the more\nyour ego is active the less confident\nyou are because the sense of confidence\nisn't something isn't a sense of self\nthat's based on comparison it's a sense\nof self that's based internally so\nmeditation leads to confidence like\nunderstanding yourself irrespective of\nother people let go for a hike or like\nyou know go swimming in a lake or the\nocean or something like that and\nspending time with nature when you're\nnot near other people like if I if I go\nout for a hike and I say I'm gonna climb\nto the top of that Boulder and I succeed\nand there's no one around like I can\ncelebrate but I'm just celebrating for\nmyself I'm not showing off for anyone\nthere's no chance for ego and then if I\nfail like that's also like my failure\nthat's personal it's just like okay I\ndidn't do it there's no shame it's just\nlike I said it I set a target for myself\nand I didn't do it it's like success or\nfailure becomes internal it doesn't\nbecome external because Nature doesn't\ncare Nature doesn't care what you decide\nto do nature's is gonna be nature but\nother people care and that that sort of\nengenders ego and then you start making\ncomparisons and how what do people think\nabout you and how do you feel about\nyourself and and so just spend time away\nfrom people and I personally have\nbenefited a lot from spending time with\nnature so when I was like you know I\nstarted like doing some like hiking and\nlike climbing and stuff like that\nclimbed a bunch of mountains and in\nColorado climbed Kilimanjaro like I\nthink those are all wonderful\nexperiences and I think you should spend\nmore time in nature if you want to\novercome your ego because nature will\nput your ego in check real quick how do\nI get\nover my fear of establishing a permanent\npersonal identity because I feel like\nnothing is good enough okay how do I get\nover my fear of establishing a permanent\npersonal identity because I feel like\nnothing is good enough okay\nproblem number one is you don't have a\npersonal permanent identity identity is\nnot permanent right identity changes\nover time so if we think about like my\nidentity it was like I thought I was a\nsuper smart kid right like I was a smart\nkid and like the other kids were stupid\nand I got bullied a lot in high school\nin middle school in elementary school so\nI had my thing which was like I was\nsmarter than these kids so I became a\nsmart kid and then like in college like\nI was afraid of being stupid so I didn't\nstudy because if I didn't study and I\nfailed a test then I'm not stupid I'm\njust lazy but heaven forbid I do\nanything if I studied for the test and I\ngot a B that would be freaking\nhumiliating\nso then like my identity became\nsomething bad right I was like oh I'm a\nsmart kid I'm too good for college I\ncould get a 4.0 if I want to but I just\nchoose not to or I'm lazy that's what my\nidentity became then I went to India and\nit became oh I want to become a monk\nbecause screw this world there's ego\nthere too it was like oh I can't cut it\nin the real world so I'm gonna say I'm\nbetter than the real world all these\nother materialistic noobs I'm a\nspiritual expert and everyone else is a\nmaterialistic noob so I'm gonna become a\nmonk and then I finally noticed my ego\nand I was like well that's kind of silly\nso then I went to medical school and I\nbecame a doctor and I started helping\npeople and now then I was like a Harvard\nAndy right so I'm a Harvard trained\npsychiatrist and I was like that Andy\nfor a little while and then now I'm not\nnow I'm just like a streamer on Twitch\nand I'm just another noob on Twitch\nright it's like and and so your your\nidentity first of all changes over time\nand that if you think nothing is good\nenough that too is like ego why don't\nlike you guys understand like you're not\ngood enough that's what crucifies to\ncrucify talking about having aspirations\nthat are far above what he's capable of\nright now so that's not good enough so\nhe chooses not to do it so what you need\nto do is first of all understand that\nidentity is not permanent and secondly\nlike it's not about what's good enough\nlike good enough is always gonna be a\nfailure you just have to do what is like\ndo what you can do what you can today\nand as long as you do the best job that\nyou can today you will be amazed at\nwhere you end up in the best job that\nyou did today may not live up to the\nexpectations that you set for yourself\nbecause of your ego which is fine but\nyou just keep on working today today\ntoday today today and then one day you\nmay feel good enough because I know I\nmean it's it's surprising people think\nthat once you you know end up as a\nphysician at the Harvard Medical School\nyou probably think you're good enough\nyou guys would be stunned how many\npeople here feel insufficient and like\nImpostors and like they need to be\nbetter because they're not chair of the\ndepartment they're not chief of the\ndepartment this person got a five\nmillion dollar grant and I only got a 1\nmillion dollar grant\nso if you think that good enough comes\nfrom an external source you're just\nwrong\nno matter what you do in life it's not\ngoing to be satisfactory if you're\nlooking externally for satisfaction it's\njust not gonna happen\ntemporarily maybe but being good enough\nis not about anything you do out there\nit's about what you feel in here and\nthat's not some like Oprah level BS it's\nlike actually true right it's actually\ntrue like that's literally how our mind\nfunctions that contentment really does\ncome from within and that learning to be\ndetached from the outcomes of your\nactions and accepting yourself for who\nyou are is like actually how you become\ncontent what ask Rousseff's next step so\nI think we talked about this so I think\nhe needs awareness of the processes that\ngo on within his mind so he's focusing\non the like the last terminal thing he's\nfocusing on the outcome where he's he\nneeds to really see these forces arise\nwith him notice them because once you\nnotice them then you get distanced from\nthem and once you have distance from\nthem you can control them that's how it\nworks it's like you become kind of a\nyeah I mean it's simple you once you are\naware of something then you can start to\nexert influence over it right and when I\nwork with people they even say to me oh\nlike I was sitting there and then I\nrealized oh that's my anxiety again\nthere goes my anxiety silly anxiety why\nare you thinking that okay that's just\nmy anxiety okay I don't have to listen\nto it and once you're able to do that\nit's not that the anxiety actually goes\naway it's just like you're like oh\nthat's my anxiety there are some days\nthat you the anxiety is so loud that you\nhave to listen to it there are some days\nmost days as you meditate and you get\nbetter and you learn yourself that you\nknow you'll learn how to control it so\nawareness is the next step how do you\nadvise shakings I okay\noh man I wish I had caught this question\nso crucify did you give up on YouTube\ncontent you just need to keep doing it\nif the content is good you can work on\npromoting that work so I hope crease its\nthis let me just see if I can I'll DM em\nlater that's a good thought thank you\nfor sending that so how much meditation\ndo I need to do before I see legitimate\nchanges a month a year so I'd say two\nmonths so the clinical studies on\nmeditation tend to tend to show like I'm\njust simplifying right so they're like\nhundreds or thousands of studies on\nmeditation here's my general conclusion\nfor people who want a simple answer the\nstudies on meditation whether you're\nlooking at arthritis anxiety IBS all\nkinds of different stuff blood pressure\nshow that to get a clinical improvement\nin symptoms that is statistically\nsignificant\nyou need to practice for 20 minutes at\nleast three times a week if not five\ntimes a week for eight weeks so the goal\nthat you should shoot for is 20 minutes\nof practice five days a week for eight\nweeks to see a clinically significant\nbenefit now practically so a clinically\nsignificant benefit over the course of a\ntrial is different from like individual\nchange right so a lot of times all see\nchanges with people like over the course\nof minutes so when you meditate here on\nstream how do you feel at the end of\nthat like that's pretty cool so\ngenerally speaking I think over the\ncourse of eight weeks is what it takes\nto start to see neuroplasticity and\nchange in your general level of function\nnot just the post meditative state but\nlike the way that you feel all day so if\nyou take people with anxiety and they\nrank their anxiety as a seven out of ten\nand they meditate for eight weeks it\nlike drops down to a four so eight weeks\ntwenty minutes a day\n[Music]\nhuh okay can you explain the elitist\nmindset and how to overcome it so the\nleanest mindset is ego right like that's\nit's everything that I've been talking\nabout it's ego if you think you're\nbetter than another human being that's\nego now you can be better at certain\nthings but like if you derive solace or\na sense of identity out of you being\nbetter than other people that's ego so\njust notice it notice that your least\nnotice that you have these thoughts and\ntry to figure out where these thoughts\ncome from the other question about the\nelitist mindset is what triggers it so\nthis is also huge when I'm talking about\nnoticing the patterns of ego ego is\ntriggered by things usually by negative\nemotion so the more negative emotion\nyou're dealing with the more egotistical\nyou're gonna become so the more that you\nfeel hurt or ashamed or that someone\nelse is like better than you the more\negotistical you're going to become and\nso the root of ego is actually negative\nemotion most of the time at least in\nthis scenario so I think everything I've\ntalked about ego is like the elitist\nmindset I think those go hand in hand\nso someone says I have a friend who I\nsuspect may be going through the same\nthink rusev has been going through how\ncould I address it for my friend so two\nthings right so I think you could get\nprofessional help and and you could also\nhave them watch the video because like\nthat's why we do videos right and by the\nway I just got into one of my mods just\nsaid that we got some donations oh wow\nso obligatory ham thank you very much\nfor the hundred dollar donation\nstolt Meister for 10 bucks and then\nank's uh for five bucks BM davis for 50\nbucks mic for a hundred bucks and\ndefender Shea for twenty\nWow guys thank you so much like that's\namazing\nand Clarence $20\nKhaleel Wow 11 bucks some guy $5 and the\nsubs that's that's awesome yeah calm\ndown guys I'm not here to earn money I\nreally do appreciate the donations they\nhelped fuel the things that we're trying\nto do which I'll talk about in a second\nlet me just finish this question okay\nokay so you know you can tell them to\nwatch it because that's why we do it and\nhopefully they'll understand something\nand then they can go see a therapist and\nif you want to help them you can also\nwatch what we do and you guys can watch\nmy videos you could start doing what I'm\ndoing you can also sign up to be a\nrecovery coach once again or you can\nbecome a clinician but if you want to\nhelp someone you know those are my\noptions the whole reason that we did the\ncoaching thing is because a lot of\npeople are like hey I'd like to help and\nI was like okay so you can go become a\ntherapist or you know you can become a\npsychologist and they're like yeah but I\nwant to help like sooner than six years\nfrom now so I scratch my head and I was\nlike okay they're a bunch of people that\nneed help they're a bunch of people that\nwant to help can we put that together in\nsome way and actually train people who\ncan help I don't know but we're gonna\ntry so that that's something you can do\nokay last question and then we need to\nfigure out who are we who okay box box\nokay\nso last question is going to be\n[Music]\nokay is being disinterested when seeing\nsuccess a form of ego is being\ndisinterested when you see success a\nform of ego no I don't think so it\ndepends on what you mean by disinterest\nso there is detachment from success\nwhich is the opposite of ego that is\nvital yeah Vairagya is detachment from\nthe outcomes of your actions by Wragge\nis awesome that's the goal Vairagya is\nto be able to do your best and then\nleave the result up to I mean\ntraditionally they say God but you know\nlet go of the result so vairagya is to\nsay I'm gonna study as hard as I can and\nif I get an a fantastic if I fail that's\nfine to that I'm gonna study as hard as\nI can and that's what I'm gonna focus on\nand the result is gonna be what its\ngonna be if that's what you're doing\nthat's fantastic if you see someone\nelse's success and you don't feel happy\nabout it\nthat could be different because you may\nactually be saying like oh I'm not\ninterested in that out of a very subtle\nego there may be a subtle form of\njealousy that you kind of like turn into\ndisinterest when you see success like oh\nI don't care about that like that guy\ndid something amazing like oh that's\ncool he could have done nothing would\nmake no difference so\nthat that is those are different things\nit just depends on subtly like what's\ngoing on in your mind it's a good\nquestion because I mean it's a it's a\nsubtle difference but very important one\nright so are you detached because\nVairagya has nothing to do with other\npeople at all has to do with like\nexpectation and letting go of\nexpectation yourself and just devoting\nyourself to the action as opposed to the\nresult"
