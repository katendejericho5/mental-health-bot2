    "transcript": "it's you that goes backwards it's you're\nnot telling me that you fail you're not\nyou've never said that to me right you\nsay that when I am actually making\nprogress this weird things happens in my\nmind where I come back to the center\nso what am i calling you buddy anything\nfrom me Rick if you want what do you\nprefer indifferent okay so should I call\nyou crucifer or Rick again industry\nwhich do you prefer I guess I'll go with\ncrucifer project because that's that's\nwhat I in my mind what I have yes so\ntell me how what are we talking about\ntoday cruson oh I'm not sure I have a\ngeneral idea you know I I guess\ngenerally addiction okay feelings of\npowerlessness and weakness I suppose in\ndaily life in getting out of that\nsure so is that tell me is that how you\nfeel\nuh generally yeah I mean I've been doing\npretty good right now\nI guess I never really last for long and\nthen I tend to feel pretty powerless and\nthen what he was what do you mean by\npowerless and hopeless like no matter\nwhat I do in my life it doesn't matter\nno matter how hard I try to fix\nsomething it's it's never fixable you\nknow no matter how much effort I put\ninto it ya don't want to Thanks ah\nthere's so many things I'd like to fix\nI'd like to get independence in my life\nI'd like to fix my health I would like\nto just get you you know I don't have\nbig aspirations I just like to get to a\nplace where I'm comfortable I'm happy\nyou know you know I'm nervous to be\nhomeless or offering myself [ __ ] yeah\nthat actually sounds like being\ncomfortable and happy i think is\nactually a tall order that's not it oh\nyeah yeah perhaps I guess not\nimmediately at risk of of decently happy\nI suppose having more days that are\nhappy than not yeah so you know couse if\nyou come across as very reasonable and\nvery collected very calm very\nintelligent thank you you too yeah thank\nyou\nI'm not you're talking about these\nemotions of powerlessness and\nhopelessness but I'm not getting those\nvibes from you\nyeah it's very complicated and strange\nyou know mentally I think I've got it\nthere I know what I have to do and I\nthink I'm intelligent enough to do that\nthe best way to explain that I suppose\nis it's a bit like an invisible wall you\nlike using game terms i suppose it's\nlike finding that invisible wall you\ncan't go any further in the game yeah\nbut you know I think that's that's a\ngreat analogy can you help us understand\nwhat that means in real life like what's\nthe invisible wall what does that mean\num I guess for me it's that part where\nyou know I know what I have to do but I\ncan't do it\nand it's I can't put my finger on it I\ndon't know what needs to be done or have\nthe resources or yeah absolutely so you\ncan you can see it's like you can see\nexactly where you're supposed to go but\nas you start walking there you run into\na glitch and you're like well I need\nthat you know this is on the Waze keypad\nI'm hitting the W and I should be moving\nforward but I'm just not able to move\nforward and you're able to kind of see\neverything and you just yeah so so let's\ntalk a little bit about that and see if\nwe can understand why is it that when\nyou know what you need to do you can't\nseem to do it and my sense is that you\nknow most people don't understand that\nthere are forces within them that are\nactually trying to keep them in place\nand maybe we can try to understand what\nthose are or their obstacles that\nthey're not able to see which means that\nthey aren't it's not that they're not\nthere it's just you're not able to\nrecognize it so well let's dig into that\nso tell me something about what I mean\nwhat do you feel powerless about so you\nsaid that there are a lot of different\nthings and you're not asking for much\nyou mentioned health and stuff like that\nso let's pick something and dig into it\num I don't know if I could pick\nsomething specifically it's just general\nlife I seem to suck at even though I\nknow what to do you know little things\nthat everybody else seems to define that\nI tend to struggle with yourself so here\nwe have problem number one right which\nis what I asked you for something\nspecific like I asked you what direction\ndo you want to move in you say\nwhat I'd no idea\nIII don't know I can't pick anything\nspecific there's problem number one\nright so like what you're talking about\nis sucking at life which I too have\nsucked at life in in my life it's it's\nsomething that I think is quite common\nand the first problem is that like\nyou're trying to fix something that is\nso broad and you don't know you're\nsaying that you see an invisible wall\nbut I think the basic problem is like\nare you hitting W a s or D right like\nwhich direction are you trying to go in\nyou're not able to give me a clear\ndirection so that's problem number one I\nsupposed to use that analogy it's like I\ncan't go in that direction\npressing WASD and I can't move yeah but\nso so I'll ask you one more time and I\ndon't know if this is gonna be kind of\nlike oddly stubborn but pick something\nsure let's say it's a health okay so\nlet's talk about health\ntell me about your health yeah I'm very\noverweight I I'm not sure how much I\nweigh now but uh she's a good example\nI've been going to the gym I've recently\nstarted going again that hasn't been\ngreat but before then goodbye I was\ngoing figure I was going for like three\nyears straight now yeah that's what time\nshould be it is she was the kicker I\nreally didn't lose that much anyway\noh thanks because I'll say I'm watching\nthe right things but I know what to do\nin fact I'd say I know probably more\nabout about you know healthy diet than\nmost people\nyeah I absolutely have knowledge but I\njust can't but it in place for some\nreason I gained a tremendous amount of\nstrength and muscle mass but and I found\na passion for working out but that's\nthat's an example of an invisible wall\nfor me okay so you're saying that you\ndidn't make progress or you did make\nprogress I made progress\nand I gained like something silly like\n20 pounds more muscle in a year so I\nmade massive progress I gained a\ntremendous amount of strength and size\nbut you know in my peak even though I\nwas working out I still weighed and I\nhave wait I weighed myself in that time\n520 pounds okay yeah and so I can't wait\nokay so I think that the natural thing\nto do is to ask you about the other\nthings that you were doing to work out\nright like what are you eating right and\nthings like that so they're like that's\nthe direction that instinctively we\nwould go I'm actually gonna steer clear\nof it because I don't think that's the\nissue so yep go ahead there's no you're\nabsolutely right I it was dyed\nabsolutely and I know what it is but I\ndon't okay so that's what we want to\ntalk about right the issue here isn't\nthat you know you need to fix your diet\nthe issue here is that you're not able\nto fix it so yeah what what gets in the\nway of what what is it let's so let's\ndefine things so I think this is like\nproblem number one that people have is\nthat when you're saying that you suck at\nlife like I don't think that that is a\nproblem that is solvable that's not an\naction there's no action you can take so\nthis is important to understand Chris so\nI'm gonna just talk for a little bit\nokay all right so if you want to fix a\nproblem it requires a human being to\ntake an action agree or disagree agree\nso the first problem is like what is the\naction to fix sucking it life but to do\nsomething about it\nwhat does that mean to do something\nabout it that's not an action to take\naction towards fix yourself whatever\nyeah what is that like I'm asking you so\nI come to you crucify nice a I suck at\nlife what should I do\ngood right that's a goal that's not an\naction right do you see that you see the\ndifference here sure you hear so I think\nthe first problem that many people\nsuffer form gamers especially is that\nthey pick they focus on goals\nand don't define their problems in terms\nof like actionable solutions yes yeah\nyeah right so so that's the first thing\nthat we've got to change because the\nhuman mind cannot you're talking about\nan invisible wall but I what I'm getting\nfrom you is not just a wall we'll get to\nwhat that wall is but a sense of like\nlack of direction about what what you\nwant to go you know that you want to\nachieve a goal like this is like saying\nlike I want to be a millionaire one day\ngosh right that's and then but what's\nthe action how do I become a millionaire\nYeah right so I think the first problem\nis that your your prob the way that you\ndefine your problem is not a definition\nthat leads to a solution you're defining\nyour problem like you can't fix someone\nwho sucks at life that's not something\nyou can fix\nyeah does that make sense you with me\nyeah totally\nso this is what happens when we so the\nreally interesting thing about this you\nplay video games oh yeah yeah a lot no\nI'm pretty pretty controls it accounts\nthe video games how many what do you\nplay anything recently I've been\ninstalled eval you cuz my girlfriend's\nbeen playing it a lot have a bit of fun\nwith herself okay I've been playing that\nmuch okay that's something that we got\nto explore at some point why you need a\nbetter farm than your girlfriend to run\nin her face yeah did you did you play a\nlot of games when you were growing up\nyeah yeah I think so like what oh I was\nsuper into you my show again Motown be\noblivion when I was very young yeah it's\nawesome yeah I I didn't have a game or I\ncouldn't afford the game for longest\ntime I just remember watching YouTube\nvideos every single day on it and then\nwhen I eventually got it I think you\npretty much everything about the game\nand I loved it thanks funny I remember\nthe first time I played the Battle of\nkawatche yeah because I hadn't I didn't\nknow anything about it I was like this\nis insane\nit's it's like one of my best gaming\nmemories ever the\nBolivians fantastic so I think you know\nlet's just talk about oblivion for a\nsecond so like how does oblivion tell\nyou have you played morrowind\nintroduction okay so this is gonna be\nkind of obscure and I I don't think most\npeople are gonna get this but do you\nunderstand like what do you like how do\nyou how can I say this so the problem\nthat gamers have is basically like the\ndifference between morrowind\nand Oblivion they're used to playing\noblivion but real life is like morrowind\nit's not like oblivion and I'll tell you\nexactly what I mean by that in in\nmorrowind\ndo you know what a quest looks like in\nmorrowind No so this is kind of weird\nbecause they don't make quests like this\nanymore morrowind was a game where they\nwould tell you like hey I want you to go\nto this cave and get this thing just\nlike in Oblivion and all of the other\ngames like Wow and stuff like that the\ndifference is they would tell you no\nthey wouldn't give you any information\nor they give you like bizarre directions\nabout how to get there there are no\nquest markers they tell you like you\nneed to leave from the South Gate and\nfollow the river until you cross the\nriver and once you cross the river\ninstead of getting back on the road you\nneed to head east and then there's gonna\nbe a fork in the road and then you need\nto head south and then there's gonna be\na big rock and then from the big rock\nyou go there what is oblivion do when it\ngives you a quest\nit gives you an objective marker yeah\nright so gamers are really good at\nfollowing a quest marker but the problem\nis when you say you suck at life like\nwhat is the quest marker for that ya\ndon't have one exactly right so you say\nyou know what you need to do because\nyou're kind of saying like okay I need\nto improve my diet but improving your\ndiet is not actually a quest marker it's\na goal it's like a nebulous objective\nyeah the question is what are the\nactions that you need to take because\nsucking it life is like I don't I mean\nthat's not something you can fix\nyeah right so like let's\nlet's talk about so what is something\nthat you want to change like like define\nsomething for me you want to go with\nback to wait we can go back to wait\nthat's fine uh sure\nokay let's just wait because we've\nestablished it it's okay so what if I\nwere to tell you crucify can't lose\nweight it's impossible what I say being\ncorrect right okay so tell me what is\nthe action that results in weight loss\nuh eating healthy foods eating less okay\nso if I if I so this is important to\nunderstand what is the verb so weight\nloss is not a verb right but what is\nweight loss like what is it I get what\nyou're saying I mean explain it to\neveryone else\nsure sure is I'm not making something no\ndid I lose weight you can't just say you\nknow I'm gonna lose weight and then not\ndo anything you have to go you have to\nbuy healthy foods you have to stock your\nshelves at home with only healthy foods\nright so do you do that you don't\nhealthy no yes No okay right see now\nwe're getting somewhere right so now\nthere's a difference between losing so\nthis is important you can't lose weight\nthat's not an action you can go and buy\nhealthy foods and stock them on your\nshelf that is not weight loss agreed jr.\nbut that is how you get to weight loss\nmmm so in your mind I think part of your\nproblem is that you're thinking in terms\nof goals and you're not thinking in\nterms of actions but as a human being\nyou cannot actually accomplish a goal\nyou can only take an action\nI see you krinkle your eyebrows which is\nperfect so tell me what's what are you\nthinking um I'm thinking in general I\ndon't like I know that it takes actions\nand I know what I have to do but perhaps\nit's an issue of motivation rather than\nthe not taking action\nbecause I actively make an attempt to\ntake action\nokay okay so I think that's a piece of\nit too so step one is to first of all\nrecognize that sucking at life is not a\nsolvable problem so we have to define\nsomething in a way that we have to set a\nquest marker that you can move towards\nso some people struggle because they the\ngoals that they set for themselves are\nso nebulous that they don't know how to\nstart and when you say you suck at life\nthat screams to me I don't know where to\nstart because you say that every\ndimension of my life is a problem right\nso that is a problem of ill-defined\nproblems so yeah totally get you to\nshorten this a little bit I guess I\nexplained it badly I mean I untie can\naction I'm going to the gym that's a\nform of action I'm doing yep\ngreat attempting of my best to eat\nhealthier by filling my shopping with\nhealthier foods meat and veggies I you\nknow bindery also it makes it easier for\nme to cook takes less time things like\nthat great\nyeah so it feels like that's not the\nissue\nokay so let's yeah let's move so what do\nyou think is the issue\nso that's the issue I don't know what\nthe issue is and I can't put my finger\non it okay but I don't think it's it's a\nmatter of I get what you're saying you\nknow you have to focus on each step\nyou're taking instead of yeah when you\nend up and yeah I'm not sure it's okay\nso what happens when you try to take a\nstep so you're saying that when you try\nto take a step you've defined that you\nneed to take one step forward\nsomething gets in the way of you taking\na step forward and what what goes into\nthat\nsure here's another thing right I\ncurrently not working I would like to\nhave more money by getting a job is\nworking but whenever I do try to get a\njob and work and I've been anywhere from\nIT support at a school to coca-cola\nsalesperson I end up getting depressed\nand suicidal\nin fact I I'm on disability because\nwhenever I go into a job I I don't care\nabout my life anymore\nso it's strange yeah what's strange\nabout that I I think it's strange\nbecause I don't have the motivation to\nmaintain my life I guess I mean if you\ntold me you need to get a job right now\notherwise you're homeless you know\nyou're gonna die I don't think it would\nchange what I did on a daily basis\nhmm yeah okay and I tribute for how i\nlost thinking perhaps maybe that has\nthat's a lot of the issue maybe yeah so\nI think it's strange that when you start\nto actually move towards your quest\nmarker you feel depressed and suicidal\nyes that's really strange I think we've\ngot to figure out what's the deal there\nbecause I think part of the reason that\nyou're not making progress per se is\nbecause when you make progress you start\nto feel worse that's what I'm hearing\nfrom you that's very it's not as strange\nas people think but I'm gonna call that\nstrange so let's understand what the\n[ __ ] is going on there\nright I never thought about that but\nthat actually is pretty accurate that's\nnever clicked with me before but that's\nokay so are you thinking about other\nthings in your life for which that's\ntrue yeah tell me about this I will\nfitness it seems to be whenever I get\nwhenever I'm making progress it goes\ndownhill again worse now let's be clear\nwhen you say goes downhill are you\ntalking about the physical progress that\nyou've made or you start to feel\nsomething similar to when you get a job\nI'm soon mental accident right so now\nwe're on to something we're on to a\npattern where when crucifix one step\nforward something in his mind awakens\nand makes you feel worse and stops you\nfrom moving forward\n- strange yes so now we are\nspray-painting the wall right there's\nthis wall and you haven't seen it before\nand now we're spray-painting and it's\nlike hey there's something here let's\nfigure out what this is\nso what other parts of your life do you\nthink that happens\nspecifically I mean we can we can say a\nlot of things with this generally\nlooking after myself day-to-day you know\nthe motivation to get up in the shower\nwhen I run like you know keeping my\nhouse clean and I'm getting better so to\nspeak getting out of that slump yeah\nlooking after myself\nit comes back and I get more and more\ndepressed and more progress I made yeah\nlike isn't that weird man yeah\nso now you're describing something that\nis not the original problem you were\ndescribing you were saying when you try\nto move forward there's an invisible\nwall that prevents you from moving\nforward but what I'm hearing from you is\nsomething else it's like you're attached\nto a spot with a rubber band\nand the harder you run away from the\nspot the harder the rubber band pulls\nyou back yeah yeah right so the first\nthing is like that's very different from\na wall\ni muted no no like what are you thinking\nhey yeah okay oh okay there we go\nwhat was that I don't know I think we\njust broke something okay\nwe're we were making progress and\ndiscord rubber-banded us back it was the\npower of my brain clinking yeah that's\nwhat happens we just it just blows it\nblows our internet connections out the\nwazoo\nokay so let's talk about the rubber band\nokay so let's tell me how so let's pick\none of these things so now so the\ninteresting thing is you know earlier I\nwas saying that if you suck at life\nthat's like too big of a problem to\nsolve but what I'm recognizing now is\nlike maybe that was actually idiotic of\nme because what I'm seeing is that you\nhave one thing one pattern that prevents\nyou from moving forward in lots of\ndifferent directions\nand that maybe the problem isn't in\ndefining you know it doesn't matter\nwhether you're trying to move north\nsouth east or west the problem is that\nyou're attached by a rubber band and so\nlike that your instinctive\ncharacterization of the problem was\nactually better than mine and it was and\nwe're seeing something different which\nis that what you were saying originally\nso let's talk let's dig into one of\nthese and try to understand what that\nrubber band is so pick something [ __ ]\nokay let's pick the job saying yeah yeah\nafter about a week I feel suicidal can't\nforce myself to go to the job anymore\nand I'm just not showing up okay so tell\nme about how do you feel when you apply\nfor a job excited\nconfident it's not something pleasant I\ndon't really like traditional sort of\njob but it's something you have to do\nand I feel a bit of pride I don't feel\nparticularly know\nand the the first week is usually you\nknow fun at some day and then\nimmediately yours down in what way and\nso one day I just can't [ __ ] do this\none day I can't get out of bed one day\nbefore that happens like so tell me what\nday three of your job is like starting\nto get kind of sick of this okay and\nwhat kind of thoughts do you have when\nyou start to get kind of sick of this I\ndon't want to do this [ __ ] why\nshould I yeah why should I be working\ntowards someone else's success wasting\ntime sure I'm not gonna get this time\nback the average person spends a massive\nmajority of their life working instead\nof living yeah yeah so that's good I'm\njust trying to think about how to\nexplain this okay so so the first thing\nthat I want you to notice is that when\nwe think about being unable to follow\nthrough with a behavior there's another\nlike minor misdiagnosis that you made\nwhich is that you say that one day I\nwake up and I just can't do it anymore\nright so like that's like the rubber\nband snapping back into place but the\nmain thing to understand crucifies that\nthe tension in that rubber band actually\nstarts way before the snapback like if\nI'm moving against a rubber band I'm\ngonna feel it pulling against me pulling\nagainst me pull against me on day three\nday four day five day six by day seven\nyou snap back yeah so if you want to\nstay in your job you have to figure out\nlike that's that's tension that's\nbuilding up over the course of the week\nand you're not doing anything about an\nintention so of course it's gonna\noverwhelm you at some point yeah so I\nwould hypothesize that you are\nneglectful of your thoughts and your\nfeelings up until the breaking point\nyeah that you power through you're a\npower through kind of guy like you just\ntough it out and you're like okay I'm\ngonna go I have to pull myself out of\nbed I don't want to work for someone\nelse's [ __ ] success like people waste\ntheir time but I'm gonna I gotta work so\nI'm gonna get up\nI'm gonna go to go to work I'm gonna\npull myself out of my bed I'm gonna use\nwillpower to you know go to work the\nnext day and then overtime what's\nhappening is you've got this mental like\ntrash\nthat's like building up in your mind and\nthen at some point the mental trash\noverwhelms you and then you know you\njust ghost them so what do you think you\nshould do about that I if I knew I think\nI'd fixed it yep\nokay so so I think the problem here is\nthat is that mental trash enters you\nneed to like offload it like as it's\nhappening perhaps a large part of me\ndoesn't want to [ __ ] work though that\njob you know yep like that\nthat's the trash so here's the problem\nis that you don't want to let go of your\ntrash yeah I don't I don't want to\n[ __ ] work shitty jobs that mean\nnothing there you go\nright so now we come to the heart of it\ncrucify is your problem is ego your\nproblem is arrogance it's not\nhopelessness it's not powerlessness\nit's [ __ ] ego what do you think about\nthat\nuh-huh I I don't think I think I\ndisagree but I'm wrong that I disagree\nno no I'm not sure I been right once\nbefore today and I've been wrong so let\ngo ahead and disagree I could be wrong\nmaybe I want to disagree because the\nmatter but possible that's some real\nFreudian level stuff you've got going on\nthere I feel like I don't feel\nparticularly arrogant but I feel like\nthat's what an arrogant I think perhaps\nso this is important I don't think\nyou're arrogant in the standard way I\nthink you're arrogant in a son script or\nyogic way and I'll tell you specifically\nyou have a very subtle arrogance you're\nnot mean to other people you don't think\nyour other your other people but I think\nwhen you get one of those jobs you start\nto think lots of thoughts like you are\nbetter than this this job is too lowly\nfor you and so you don't want it anymore\nand you can only subject yourself to\nthat for a certain amount of time\ntotally accurate I wouldn't say the jobs\ntoo lowly for me I would say it takes I\nadmire people who could do a job like\nthat because they're hard workers than\nme and they can deal with [ __ ]\nbetter than I can\ndoes that make sense yes so I think\nthere are subtleties here okay so I\nthink the first thing is that you do\nhave some ego around this job because I\ndo think that you feel like you're too\ngood for it the other thing is that you\nhave a very defined sense of who you are\nand who you aren't and your problem is\nthat you're not willing to let go of\nthat\nyou\nlike you're not you're not the kind of\nperson who can work a job like this\nhow does that statement resonate with\nyou it resonates a lot well so I think\nyou go ahead go ahead\nI feel like that applies to nearly every\nsingle job available to me on the\nstandard sort of job market so this\nlet's I completely agree and this is\nyour problem so I want you to just\nunderstand this so I don't think you're\narrogant in the standard sense but I I\nshouldn't be working a job like this\nthis is not the kind of job that I\nshould have that's a statement of\narrogance yeah does that make sense what\nwe you agree with that yeah sure that's\nthe problem so you have to like let go\nover the fact that the only thing that\nyou can get are shitty jobs and the\nproblem is like you get excited about a\njob you go there and then every day that\ngoes by that ego starts to pile up right\nand says like this is stupid\nI can't do this this is boring this is I\ndon't think you quite think this is\nbeneath you because but I think there's\na lot of like shame and ego involved\nwith like the jobs that you can get and\nso like you don't want to work because\nthose are not the jobs that you want to\nwork yeah totally but that's that's the\nproblem it's not that you're not willing\nto work it's that you don't want it's\nnot that you can't work it's that you\ndon't want to work this is not the kind\nof [ __ ] job that you want yeah yeah\nthat's right that's right I think I'm a\nvery hard worker actually I think you\nare too I think your problem is not that\nyou're stupid is not that you're lazy in\nfact I think you have an immense amount\nof willpower people may look at you and\nthey may think you're lazy they may\nthink that you're not hard-working I\ncompletely disagree I think your problem\nis that you're your ego I think your\nproblem is that you're not willing to\nwork that job for longer than a week\nyeah it's straight ensuring this when my\nentire life I've been totally obviously\nyou know ya can told that you're lazy\nnot working hard enough you need to just\ndo it and it doesn't feel that simple to\nyou and then you just try to do it and\nfail\nI suppose so this is why I think you\nactually have a lot of willpower because\nyou try to do it despite these heavy\nheavy forces pulling you back you can\nget up and apply for a job again and\nagain and again that actually is\nincredibly resilient\nyou know your stamin is actually really\nhigh I think you have a lot of willpower\nbecause walking around inside your head\nis like it's hard to overcome those\nforces within you but you're able to do\nit for stretches of time like that's\nactually pretty amazing\nthink your problem is that you're not\nwilling to accept where you are right\nnow and that getting out of your\nposition is going to involve some pretty\ndemeaning stuff\nyou're gonna have to start huh you tell\nme are you telling me to stop kami\nstop what are you telling me to stop\ncamping on my three cans or something\nI'm not a mother but Sir what little\njoke little joke go ahead sorry help I\ndidn't understand yeah that's okay I I\nhave to like bring the mood up a little\ndoes get a little bit emotional because\nyou're a you're a wholesome man\nso so what what let's talk about that\nwhat were you feeling emotionally why\ndid you have to break them up\nI I don't want to try on your [ __ ]\nStreet okay what makes you feel like\ncrying\nnot sure it's it's nice to know that\nyou're not just a piece of [ __ ] and that\nyou're kind of working really hard we'll\ntry so just think about this screw so\nthink about this these are not bad tears\nthese are good tears and what are you\ndoing holding back moving away from them\nyou have gotten so used to the idea that\nyou are lazy and that you're worthless\nthat when you start to realize that\nyou're not it becomes unfamiliar\nterritory and you run no wonder you're\nstuck because the parts of you that are\nactually there within you that can help\nyou move forward that are amazing and\nintelligent and full of willpower and\nstamina when you see them something\nabout that like scares the [ __ ] out of\nyou and you move away from it don't move\naway man move towards it look where did\nyou get this idea that you're like lazy\nand and worthless like where does that\ncome from oh I think you know maybe my\nfamily growing up you know I guess\nthey're not psychiatrists right so they\ndon't know any better they just want to\nhelp you but they you know but there is\na small part of me that says that this\nis [ __ ] and that's not true and that\nI am just lazy you know and that you're\njust telling me what I want to share\nmaybe why I'm accepting that because I\nwant to share it so this is important\nhow does that part of you make you feel\nand I'll tell you after you I mean I\nhave the hypothesis but how does that\npart of you make you feel the pocket\ndoubts yeah yep the part that thinks\nthat you're lazy yes see that's weird\nit makes you feel comfortable so like\nlet's just pause and look at that the\npart of you that keeps you down makes\nyou feel comfortable and now you're even\nlooking all over the place the part of\nyou that makes you feel hopeful about\nyourself\nyou retreat from you have to break the\ntension by making a joke so like just\nlook at your mind for a second you\ngravitate comfortable is like okay if\nI'm lazy like I can deal with that I've\nbeen told that in my entire life\nthat is comfortable territory it's a\ngame that I played before I know how to\nplay that game and I'm asking you to\nplay a different game we say and if you\nwant to change your life you have to you\ncan't play the game where you gravitate\ntowards the comfort of being lazy and a\nfailure you've got a risk\nyou've got to risk the possibility that\nyou're actually worth something that you\ncan accomplish a lot that if you go to\none job you're terrified that one job\nwon't lead to another better job and so\nyou're not willing to play that game\nbecause you don't know if you're gonna\nwaste your whole life in a call center\nthat thought is terrifying to you and\nyou don't know if you're gonna be able\nto move beyond that and so if there's\nthat chance of failure you would rather\njust quit here's the thing you've got to\ntake a chance that you are better than\nwhat you think you are and that's a\ndangerous game\nwhat are you thinking what are you\nfeeling it's uh it's hard to process\nmm-hmm talk to uh to agree with you and\nI feel bad for not being able to yeah\nthat's okay you don't have to agree with\nme so can we agree on one thing so I\nwant to just track back on what's said\nwhen I said something to you that made\nyou feel good about yourself how did\nthat make you feel relieved but also a\nlittle bit ashamed for some reason yep\nright so and then you you moved away\nfrom it can we agree on that yeah okay\nand when we talk about you being that\nwhen there's that doubting voice in the\nback of your mind that says actually\nthis guy is just telling you this\nbecause he's a nice guy and he says this\nto everyone he's not really talking\nabout me he doesn't really understand me\nhe's just saying that because that's\nwhat he does how does how does that\nvoice make you feel do you move towards\nit or do you move away from it away no\nno towards it towards that right so like\neven if we even if we don't even if I'm\nwrong can we at least agree that your\nmind is doing something kind of funny\nthat it's moving away from the things\nthat actually make you feel hopeful and\nit's moving towards the things that make\nyou feel hopeless there's safety and\ncomfort and being lazy and hopeless and\nsucking at life yeah and there's\ndiscomfort in the possibility that\nyou're something more like those are\nyour emotional reactions right that's\nnot coming from me yeah and now we have\nthis other idea which like kind of\nparallels with the wall in the rubber\nband that the weird thing is it's not\nthat something's holding you back it's\nthat when you try to take a step forward\ninstead of embracing the possibility\nthat you're worth something and that you\ncan accomplish something that rubber\nband pulls you back to that corner of\nyour mind that says that you're lazy and\nmakes you\noverleaf that's you see that it's the\nsame thing so we're we're seeing a\nmicrocosm of what's happening is\nsomething going on are you okay uh no\nI'm okay okay you're just like looking\naround a lot and I'm trying to figure\nout am I making you uncomfortable no no\nno no this is weird yeah\nwhat's weird tell me what tell me what\nthat means I didn't think I was I mean I\nI always thought there was something\ndifferent and I was sort of [ __ ] up\nand I needed help yeah I didn't expect\nthis to be the issue I suppose some sort\nof strange that such a it feels I don't\ndeserve to have this issue it seems like\nit feels like I'm being told the issue\nis that you're actually really great\nperson and you just need to apply\nyourself or something or have faith in\nyourself and that feels unworthy and\nstupid yeah absolutely you know why it's\nstupid so this may be confusing for\npeople right the reason it feels stupid\nbecause like if that was the issue\nyou're even more of a failure because\nthis means that you always had the\noption to do a good job you just chose\nnot to yeah right like this is important\nthis is ego too because if it was\nsomething so simple as this then you're\na real idiot because you didn't have to\nlive this life but if the issue is\nsomething much larger much more grand\nand much more devastating then you have\nan excuse for the life that you live and\nthis is scary because like this is\nsomething that you need to understand\ncrucifer I mean this is gonna sound kind\nof cheesy but with great power comes\ngreat responsibility and what I see\nwithin you is great power and it's\nabsolutely your responsibility\nyour problem is like it's not one of\npowerlessness it's like the opposite and\nwhat did you feel when I said that\nyou like uh you were I I feel really bad\nbut I still feel like it's [ __ ] but\nwhat do you mean by feel really bad I\nfeel bad for thinking it's [ __ ]\nthat's okay you're allowed to think it I\nwant to believe it so much I feel like\nit's too good to be true and I can't get\nover this hurdle that's fine that\nbothers me that's okay don't don't try\nto get over the hurdle I wouldn't I\nwouldn't beat yourself up for that I\ndon't think you need to get over the\nhurdle it makes me it feels like it's\njust like you telling me that I'm not\nconfident enough in myself but I feel\nlike I'm very confident\nbut I feel like it's probably [ __ ]\nthen that makes you right and I don't\nwant you to be right because that means\nI'm wrong yeah so what do we call that\nah\nI'm not sure is this like a some twitch\nchat twit twit chat understands ego\nright that's your [ __ ] problem man\nwho tweet chat and these guys these guys\naren't trained right they're there\nthey're like they're noobs because\nbecause I'll tell you that here's the\noperative words I don't want you to be\nright I want you to be wrong and I want\nto be right because it would be easier\nand more comfortable for me if you were\nless and I could keep sort of just\nthinking I'm a piece of [ __ ] yes\nsee now you're seeing\nso let this be a lesson to everyone that\nif you want to grow it's not easy right\nbecause growing is abandoning the things\nthat you believe about yourself growing\nis actually the process of abandoning\nwhat works it's hard growth isn't easy\nbecause this has worked for you you've\ncreated a comfortable life right and\nit's kind of like you're just kind of\nlike existing right now and you've\ncreated a life that's like decent in a\nlot of ways and what I'm asking you to\nduke rusev is risk it\nif you really want to change you've got\na risk you've got a risk because right\nnow you have like you have this like\nlittle little got this little safety\nyou've got this trump card in your hand\nwhich is that you're not really giving\nit your all and you're bowing out so you\nhave some excuse your ego has this\nrefuge right it's like there's a\ndifference between the shame of working\na dead-end job and not getting promoted\nand like working a dead-end job and\nquitting after a week you protect\nyourself from the possibility you\nprotect yourself from so many things\nthat would be so devastating for you\nbecause like what if you worked at the\ncall center and you're smart right cuz\nyou're a smart guy like I can tell that\nyou like a very smart guy and as smart\nas you are if you don't get promoted\negos not gonna like that\nya see you say I'm a smart guy but I I\nmean I also dropped out of school\ndropped out of college you know I\nactually that's a pretty big trend huh\nyep yeah why did you drop out of college\nMike's\nit's sort of different I suppose because\nmy my lecturer at the time did kind of\n[ __ ] me over a lot and she was a [ __ ]\nprobably still is a [ __ ] okay just so\nmen out there if she's watching I hate\nyou okay something there yeah well I\nmean yeah no I we came to like the last\nweek before I was you know graduated\nnice way I guess well sure he gets go\nover that but uh I was sick for a week\nfried of that and she took me out of my\ngroup that I was working with for like\nan entire year and then when I said well\nwhat do I do now I put all of my work\ninto the screw rod scripts recorded [ __ ]\nand I did a lot of stuff most of it was\nmy idea\nshe said guess you're gonna do years\nworth of work in a week and so I walked\nout and didn't come back to the cost\nyeah boy did you get screwed over yeah\nyeah and high school yeah I got bullied\nquite a bit it was really unhealthy time\nI was in fights every day that wasn't\nbecoming a very good person that was\nquite a bad person and suicidal every\nday and thankfully my parents pulled me\nout so that's a different situation too\nyeah I'm feeling like that's different\nyeah both different yeah so maybe it's\nnot I still think there's a lot of ego\nwith the teacher yeah right you see that\nyeah yeah I saw it in general maybe\nokay yeah what do you mean by that uh\ngrowing up I always seem to have an\nissue with authority figures like as you\nknow maybe I don't have it so much now I\ndefinitely did I never got along with my\nass of lecturers or teachers disagreed\nwith them a lot\nokay I said that's arrogance right and I\nthink that's pretty typical growing up I\ndon't know I I don't think that's the\nego that I'm talking about\nit could be but I think so crucify you\nwhat are you thinking about what we've\ntalked about today so we're we're gonna\nhave to wrap up in like maybe five to\nten minutes or see if people have\nquestions so let's just let's try to\nfind some kind of I mean I feel like\nyou've made progress today I've kind of\nmore lost today yep yeah I guess\nprogress yeah\ntell me why you found us know what to do\nwith myself I don't know this is really\noverwhelming I suppose yeah I see that\nthat's why okay so let me try to help\nyou okay so I I think I can see why you\nfeel overwhelmed because what I'm doing\nis I'm taking away I'm pulling the rug\nout from under you yeah right you've\nconceptualized your life in some way and\nyou're telling me that you suck at life\nand so then what I'm trying to do and I\nthink what we've done is change the\nconception for which you're you have\nabout your life and I think that is a\ngood but painful experience that we've\nleft you lost because like I've told you\nthat the narrative that you've built\nyour life on is actually untrue\nand that instead of being lazy in\nsucking it life you're actually\nintelligent and capable and you were\ngiving me this evidence I'm not just\nsaying this because I'm a nice guy when\nyou say I've been working on a project\nfor a year that I've been directing and\ndoing most of the work for and I got\nkicked out of it one week from\ncompletion what I hear is that maybe\nthis guy has like interpersonal problems\nand doesn't understand like like what\nhappened in that situation there seems\nto be another side of that story but I'm\nalso hearing that you were able to like\nrun a project for a year where you did\nmost of the heavy lifting which is\nactually consistent with what I think\nabout so I don't think that you're\nincapable but that's dangerous because\nif you're capable then whose fault is it\nthat you're in this situation I don't\nokay I know I know you don't so then we\nget to this so this is what I want you\nto focus on is that there are some\nthings in life so I want you to stop\nthinking so the invisible wall is a lack\nof capability right those two things are\nthe same but the rubberband is not like\nyour focus on you being capable is the\nor incapable is the rubberband pulling\nyou back and we can see evidence of that\nbecause when you actually start to move\nforward what happened\nI go back yes it's you that goes\nbackwards it's you're not telling me\nthat you fail you're not you've never\nsaid that to me right you say that when\nI am actually making progress this weird\nthings happens in my mind where I come\nback to the center yeah that's not a\nlack of capability that's like something\nyou pulling you back to the center\nthat's that's like something within you\nso if you want and the other thing is\nthis is pervasive in your life you see\nit in working out you see it in school\nyou see it in jobs there's something\nabout you and they're like the one\nemotional moment that you just you know\nhead like you just made some kind of\nweird joke I I still understand but like\nyou know I'm sure it was and and so like\nthat's the one time over this interview\nI mean I've called you all kinds of\nthings that people may find offensive\nand none of that you had to block you\ndon't have to block any of it right you\ndon't even realize I was saying this\nstuff some of the stuff that I've said\nto use it like could be mean in other\ncircumstances yeah the thing that you\nhuh I think I'm wrong yes I think so I\nwant you to watch this interview right\nand see what it is that you retreat from\nwe see you running away from it and\nthat's actually the feeling of hope and\nand it's not as simple as like you're\nsaying I think you're saying that I just\nneed confidence and believing in myself\nno man like that's it's not that simple\nit's way harder than that\nwhat you need to do is like what budva\ndid in his life which is like become\nenlightened like you'd that's the road\nyou're walking it's a hard road it's\nit's a road about grappling against\nyourself the search for enlightenment is\nit has nothing to do at the external\nworld it has to do it the final boss of\nlife is yourself\nit's not anything else it's you and\nyou're saying like oh I just need to\nhave content no man like you don't\nunderstand like how big this like\nTyrannosaurus Rex of yourself is that\nyou have to overcome but I have faith\nthat you can do it you just need to\nstart trying\nso through it not just do it awareness\nwhat your problem has never been your\ninability to just do it in fact you've\ntold me time and time again that you're\ncapable of just doing it you pull\nyourself out of the gutter and you apply\nfor a job and you show up there and then\nthe next day you just do it and the next\nday you just do it and the next day that\nyou just do it and eventually you just\nrun out of energy and you quit your\nproblem is not just doing it your\nproblem is a lack of awareness about\nwhat are the forces inside you that keep\nyou from doing it so this is what I want\nyou to pay attention to I want you to\ntry something you pick what it is Jim\njob whatever and I want you to look for\nthis this dichotomy look for this\nconfusing thing look for this sense that\nas you start to move up you pull\nyourself back notice that force within\nyou notice the force of the rubber band\nand see it happening and then recognize\nthat it's not actually a lack of\ncapability it's you yourself are telling\nyourself to retreat to the safety of\nyour life of nothingness see that thing\nit's like a gravitational pull and see\nthat thing happening within you if you\ngive in to it that's fine if you don't\ngive in to it that's better but the most\nimportant thing is awareness awareness\nawareness understanding understanding\nunderstanding the reason that you can't\nsee the wall is because it's not there\nman it's a rubber band it's not a wall\nso the solution to the issue is to\nunderstand when it's happening what's\nhappening and you can try to push don't\neven try to push through that's even\nlike let it happen just watch first okay\npushing through is what you do what I\nwould say is see that it happens and\nthen actually don't push through it\naccept it and move on despite it okay\nunderstand that that is a part of you\nunderstand that you have this little\nthing that's sitting on your shoulder\nthat's gonna be with you\nand it doesn't mean that you push it off\nyou don't fight against it you\nacknowledge it and you move forward\nthat's actually a solution it's not\npushing through because pushing through\nis like I know it sounds like this is a\nsemantic thing but good but you don't\nwant to just pushing through implies\nblindness to me yeah right you want to\nacknowledge it and understand that you\nmay not be ready to push you may not be\nready to accept it what you actually\nneed towards yourself is not pushing\nthrough also implies like a certain\nsense of combating or antagonism it's\nlike you versus it that's not a battle\nyou can win the games that you play\nagainst yourself only have one loser\nsure right so like you don't want to\nplay that game what you actually need\ntowards yourself is compassion\nacknowledgement/recognition and\ncompassion not willpower not energy not\nintelligence see that thing happening\nwithin you you'll be amazed if you\npractice this yeah and then if it\nhappens you cut yourself some slack\nright you can say okay day three I don't\nwant to go to work I feel like this is a\nwaste of time and then you say oh this\nis that part of me I don't know what it\nis it's bitter it feels like this is\nbeneath me it's egotistical like that's\na piece of me that is activating within\nmy mind because it's not there right now\nit only happens when you like leave the\nhouse and try to do something with your\nlife like you see that means like a trap\nthat it's like the ego trap that arises\nwhen you try to do something with your\nlife yeah and if you fall victim to it\nthat's fine other things practically you\ncan do do you see a therapist\nI would like to okay do you not live\nwhere do you live I live in the UK okay\nso mental was kind of horrible okay so\nas best as you can try to find a\ntherapist because I think if you can get\nsome assistance if you could party up\nwith someone and work through this stuff\nas it's happening I think it's gonna\nhelp\nI see a consultant psychiatrist every\nfew months but last conversation I had\nwith them was pretty a pretty ridiculous\nin the band I've asked them for to see a\ntherapist but they don't seem willing\nthat's strange I don't understand the UK\nhealth system sorry you're in that\nsituation yeah um I mean I I know that\nsometimes you know psychiatrists they\ndon't do a great job and I'm sorry\nyou're kind of in that situation but I\nthink that as best as you can try to\nfind someone to help you work through\nthis stuff the last thing is meditate so\nif you really want to get good at this\nmeditation is the practice of noticing\nthings within yourself so that they do\nnot have control that is what meditation\nis about yeah so as you meditate you\nwill notice forces like as you train\nyourself to meditate you train yourself\nto focus your attention on the thing\nthat you choose to focus your attention\non and literally the reason that I want\nyou to meditate is as this specter Rises\nwithin you as this like trap rises\nwithin you that's thinking all these\nthoughts if you are a trained meditator\nyou can actually tell your mind I'm not\ngonna look over here all of these\nthoughts about how this is worthless and\nmy boss is an [ __ ] and I'm working\nfor someone else's stuff in capitalism\nis bad you co you look over here and you\nsay I'm gonna work because this is what\nI've decided for myself yeah and that\nthis is what I want to do what would you\nrecommend for me\n- do you know I looked at John Marcin\nand I really hate the idea of doing\nanything I have my own aspirations that\nI'd like to do yep but I felt like I had\na lack of focus and I lost interest and\nmaybe that was just this rubber banding\nnow that I would like to try out again\nyes I think ego exists in the space\nbetween your aspirations and the job\nthat you can get so this is important\nthe wider the job that you want is from\nthe job that you can get the bigger your\nego is going to be yeah and you just\nhave to understand like you have to see\nthat that's ego and you just don't want\na go to be running your life so if you\ndecide to get a job I think get a job\nand just recognize that you're gonna\nfeel bad for a while and recognize that\nthe reason that you're getting the job\nis not to get a job not to get a career\nnot to make money the reason you are\ngetting a job crucify you can have an\nexperimental laboratory for yourself in\nthe feelings that arise that that\nhappened within you when you try to move\nforward in life that's the reason you\nneed to get a job if you get a job\nfantastic if you make money fantastic if\nyou get promoted fantastic you need to\nstart living your life as a laboratory\nbecause your problem is a lack of\nunderstanding and really I mean I said\nthis earlier but I think the the reason\nif the wall is invisible because it's\nlike that's not what's holding you back\nthat's why you can't see it so you have\nto understand what's holding you back\nand the only way to do that is to like\nget in the ring and like get into the\nwater and feel your feelings see what\nhappens within yourself and ideal it's\nvery hard to do on your own by the way\nso like really good if you can find some\nkind of professional help even if you\nenjoy like a meditation center or\nsomething like that and have that\nmeditation centers yeah\noh well I don't know where you live but\nmaybe there's I live in Wales in the UK\nit's kind of a pretty shitty where I\nlive in swarms that we don't have many\nlike sounds like that but I can\ncertainly try meditating yeah so so\nmeditate on it before okay so we're\ngonna do we're gonna do meditation now\nunless you have questions hold on one\nsecond let me just see if other people\nhave questions\nyeah I'd love time so any course I have\nany questions I\nI have a chat thing boomer into my way\ninto how do you get anyone without\nlearning about all this technical oh\nit's it's it's great I mean I have so\nmany people to help me so okay let me\njust see\nokay\nokay I'm seeing lots of questions I\ndon't think\nI don't think any of them were really\ndirected towards you per se\nyou\nokay\nokay so like here here someone's asking\nwhat kind of work would you burn to do\nwhat are your aspirations that's a good\nquestion\nvoice acting is something I'd love to do\nwell dude twitch chat was talking about\nthat they think that you'd be a great Oh\nexhibit yeah yeah I saw it the entire\ntime yeah I think I do I think I'd be a\nreally good voice actor but I guess\nthat's the issue right if I felt like I\nwas a gonna be a [ __ ] voice actor I\nguess I'd be one by now isn't that my\nissue yes so that well I mean on a\npractical sense there may be like how do\nyou become a voice actor I have no idea\nit's kind of difficult I suppose it\nwould just be trying out for different\nroles getting your voice out there yeah\nwell that's great man so I think you\nshould try that let's just move to LA\nokay mm-hmm all right so so I think some\nof these questions are relate to you but\nI think they're more directed towards me\nso that they're questions like how can\nyou overcome the ego that arises within\nwhat you're saying sounds good to him\nbut his problem is ignoring what should\nbe done how can he change that so like\nthese are questions that I think or if\nhe if he tries to improve and then gets\npulled back by the rubber and says screw\neverything we talked about I'm going to\nmy comfort zone what should one do to\nprevent that and still stick to what one\nknows is needed to improve okay these\nare all questions that I think are\nrelated to you so first of all Creuset I\nreally want to thank you for coming on\nbecause I do for having you gave me the\ntime of day on nobody I I did reach out\nto you when you had like 200 years in\nthe stream so didn't expect reckful then\nyou know sky and then destiny to come on\nso that was great\nin my time today why do you think you're\nnobody\nhaha [ __ ] I am like it why wouldn't I\ngive you the time of day because I have\nnothing to give back to you well I guess\nI have to give me something back huh\nyeah yeah well I guess I'm wrong how\ndoes that feel pretty shitty ha\njudgement yep\nso hard to admit that you have Worth and\nvalue and you've helped other people man\nthere's your [ __ ] problem I'd like to\nhelp people more good start by helping\nyourself sure yeah see like it's all\nwrapped up in there like this sort of\npervasive sense of lack of self-worth\nand inability to help someone that I'm\nis someone and you're and no one like\nwho do you think is helping more people\nright now me are you but you definitely\nI disagree\nif I if I just came on stream and\nstarted talking I don't think I'd\nhelping you you being sure no I couldn't\ncome to it I wouldn't have figured out\nwhat this situation was yeah but you're\nthe like who are people learning from me\nare you both sure I think they're\nlearning more from you than they're\nlearning from me I think they see\nthemselves within you and I think it\ntakes a certain amount of courage to\ncome on here and to air your dirty\nlaundry and to speak honestly and\nauthentically about yourself and I don't\nknow if you recognize this but crucifer\nyou watch this stream like it's not\nabout me talking it's about the people\nwho come on that's what you resonate\nwith like you get that like people are\nhere\nand that so that's like I know it's hard\nfor you to accept and I know you keep on\ndefaulting to this you're wrong I'm\nright I mean you're right and I'm wrong\nlike forget about that just just sit\nwith the idea that you're actually\nhelping people and that you're like a\ndecent person and that just try sitting\nwith it for a little I know it's gonna\nmake you uncomfortable and then try to\ndo something and when you do something\nnotice those two voices within you if\nthey're little bits that are gonna say\noh you're actually like good at this and\nyou can actually accomplish things and\npeople care about you and they value you\nand there's gonna be this big voice that\nsays no no no no no no no no no no I'm\nworthless [ __ ] this I'm just gonna go\nhome because I can't do it I'm disabled\nlisten to those two voices and recognize\nthem yeah that's how you get power over\nthem yeah if you're if you're a dental\nwork done uh yeah you ever been numbed\nup with like lidocaine or anything yeah\nI had no idea was coming to yeah how's\nyour control over your mouth when you're\nnumbed up pretty cool and what happens\nwhen you can start to feel again um\nshould I know
