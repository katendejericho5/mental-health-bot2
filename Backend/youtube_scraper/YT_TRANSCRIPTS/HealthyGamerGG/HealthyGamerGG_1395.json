    "transcript": "and I had a lot of grief and stuff not\nreally so much for my loss of him but\nthe thing that I was the most upset\nabout is that he was I remember the day\nthat I got in medical school he just\nstarted crying because I'd been\nstruggling to get into medical school\nfor a while and he was kind of worried\nit's really cute like that and I hadn't\nseen him cry like that I mean he just\nlike broke down and he said that you're\ngonna be amazing\nhe's like nothing is gonna stop you now\nyou are amazing yeah you're really good\nat what you do you helped me a lot\nyeah I've talked to a lot of I've talked\nto a lot of psychiatrists and so he saw\nthat right he saw that like you know\nwhen I mean I had a 2.6 GPA and was\nstruggling to get into medical school I\nnever thought I'd be faculty in Harvard\nMedical School and and he said like\nnothing is gonna be able to stop you and\nthat you should do good and you should\nhelp people that's really cute yeah and\nso what what I was sad about is actually\nthat he didn't get to see that so eight\nmonths after I got into medical school\nhe passed away and and so the the thing\nthat makes me sad like I remember like\nthe day that that I match that worried\nday what would that is see me happy I'm\nsorry I want my dad to see me happy\nbefore he does\ngood Whoopie see me happy now yeah\nyeah so um thanks for coming back on man\nhow are you how's your new year I don't\nsee you by the way\noh not sharing video okay hold on let's\nfix that very windy outside actually\nAlexa what's the wind speed 9.2 miles\nper hour\nI hear that doesn't sound like that's\nthat's fast but you're crazy okay can\nyou see me now uh yeah\ndon't I don't see you know Oh turn on I\nhave to hit the turn on camera button ok\nBoober that's an important button there\nwe go\nby the way uh uh so I don't know if this\nis still the case but one of my\ndevelopers uh-huh who watches your\nstream ah he said he was looking at he\nwas watching you look at your own chat\nand that he it looked like people were\njust typing boomer and all caps to you\nbut they're doing an emoji but you don't\nhave the extension better twitch TV or\nyou didn't have it at the time to see\nthe emoji they're not actually typing\nboomer to you in all caps oh I thought\nthey were typing boomer to me in all\ncaps is it that a pretty thing because I\nsee yes I see what's actually happening\nis they're doing this a Moute you need\nto get\noh it's frankerfacez EW I think maybe I\nthink somebody just enabled that because\nI see lots of like faces man this is\nlike the black and white boomer yeah but\nyeah now you see it okay good now you\nwant for me they used to type boomer to\nyou in all caps yeah yeah yeah I thought\nthat was just what they typed yeah that\nwould be really I think I mean it's this\nlesser I mean I thought it was endearing\nyes okay I I sort of feel like I'm I'm\ntwitches pet boomer yeah twitch loves\nwatching you try to use technology it's\nvery funny no it's I feel like a you\nknow like a three-legged dog that people\nare cheering on that's yeah that's funny\nso I mean I feel loved you are loved I\nwe were missing personality like you in\nthe space because if it's just a bunch\nof streamers talking interacting with\neach other are they're giving you hearts\nin the show when it's just a bunch of\nstreamers talking interacting with each\nother and we're all living in this\nbubble uh-huh then uh it's I don't know\nthe best way to word this but we\ndefinitely get more caught up in all the\nnegatives that result from being exposed\nto large groups of people yeah and\nforget to step back and think about it\ncritically yeah I mean I think there's\ncertainly a certain degree of myopia\nthat happens right like so people kind\nof get super zoomed in on their life and\ntheir sphere and it's really easy for\ntoxicity to kind of get built up like\neven if you look at spiritual\ncommunities like if you go to a\nmonastery and stuff like a lot of that\nlike Mayan is kind of yeah it's a\nnearsightedness yeah okay I looked it up\nyeah so so it's it's kind of like you\nknow everyone just kind of sees what's\nin front of them and it can get to be I\nmean it can just become really toxic and\nlike even when I went to these ashrams\nand stuff in India like a lot of times\nthere's just a lot of toxicity there and\na lot of ego and wait the wind is so\ncrazy that's like I couldn't hear you I\nthink my thing isn't close all the way\nokay OCD\nokay okay\nokay we're gonna yeah so how was your\nhow was your new year okay\nso this whole going into the holidays I\nwas worried because most years when I'm\ngoing into the holidays it's a lonely\nexperience and it's a lonely experience\nbecause some lonely experience because\nwell we never celebrated any holidays\nand my family and I have very little\nfamily so I just have my parents and my\nbrother right so actually like a lot of\npictures of other people having fun with\ntheir family and it always makes me feel\nleft out so most years I'll go visit and\njust we will hang out and to suck like I\ndon't know we usually just go to dinner\nor something but mmm so I don't feel\nthat as much but I was sick also and\nthen I kind of I was I've been really\nsick and then I needed to stay here I\nthink I tried to get them to come here\nthey didn't want to and then but then I\njust tried to avoid looking at social\nmedia and seeing all heavy pictures and\nstuff like that mm-hmm\nand it wasn't it wasn't too bad so it\nsounds like you were sick and it wasn't\ntoo bad is how the holidays well yeah\nyeah but even if you do go home it\nsounds like even if you're with your\nfamily you feel what exactly mmm we're\ndiving right in by the way unless you\nwant yeah I see that what do I feel\nfeels like something's missing yeah\n[Music]\nhuh wait why is everyone doing this face\nyou guys scared okay for a second yeah I\nknow I mean I maybe I'll close it\nyeah get more immersed because I saw it\nin peripheral this sense of community\nthat people usually get or in family\nfrom the holidays I've I guess I've been\nenvious of it yeah\nand even if we get together it just\nfeels like our family is really small\nand then it's not as a happy experience\nas the bigger families who have more\nthan just their immediate family yeah\nwell so and how do you feel when you\nlook at pictures of other people over\nthe holidays what's the main thing that\nthe FOMO feeling yes so what what so\nlet's talk about that for a second right\nso fear yeah yeah Oh mo FOMO is like\nsure it's fear of missing out but what\nis it about those pictures that you're\nmissing because FOMO can mean different\nthings to different people for some\npeople it's like a particular place for\nsome people it's like Sun which is what\nmy FOMO is like as I'm in Boston right\nfor some people it's like there's I just\nwant to see a lot of smiling faces\naround me yeah I guess and you you keep\npeople on close to you with people I'm\nclose to yeah so you keep on talking you\nuse the adjective that you're using has\nto do with size I don't know if you can\nif you're noticing that what is that I\ndon't it doesn't seem like size is that\nimportant\nyep for family yeah mm-hmm but that's\nthe words that you're using you see that\nyou've said small like three or four\ntimes when we talked about your family\nand going home for the holidays like my\nyeah is small so are you seeing pictures\nof like 15 people smiling together\nI am but I guess that's not it's\nprobably just that my brother's missing\nyeah from the picture yep\nwell not me right so like if we think\nabout when you go home go ahead I was\ntrying to figure out if I can put you on\nthe right side of my monitor is there a\nway to switch this it's okay keep going\nyeah yeah so let's think about that\nright so when you go home you feel like\nsomething is missing like the people\nthat you're seeing are too small like\nit's like not in our family right it's\nnot it's not the full family yeah\nbecause the whole family reckful isn't\nthe full family it's not the full family\nyeah yeah so let's just think about that\nfor a second right so the reason like\nyou feel like something is missing\nduring the holidays is because something\nis missing during the holidays sure\nyeah um this reminds me I wanted to\nshare with you because I thought of this\nmy dad wrote a book he actually wrote\nseveral but in the book he had a\nfictional character mm-hmm who was based\non himself I had a different profession\nbut the same backstory with my brother\nwho you know his kid who commits suicide\nand then he wrote the experience of the\nactual experience of what it felt like\nfor him when my my brother committed\nsuicide and I wanted to read it to you\nsure thought maybe yeah and I when I was\n16 I actually edited the book for my dad\nso I read it all the way through back\nthen huh cuz he didn't get an editor I\nwasn't very good at editing I could\nactually do it much better now while I'm\nreading it I would want to change some\nwords around enough anyway just read it\nbut yeah sure\nso let me pull\nokay okay so because\nso some of this is fictional I'll give\nit a little bit of preface um now I'll\njust go right into it I tossed and\nturned in bed but couldn't fall asleep\nas every night since my personal tragedy\nhappened in midsummer of that same year\nmy son had been suffering from a severe\ndepression for several months and I did\nsome time fear the worst so when my wife\ncalled me at work on that evening and\nsaid that his room was locked and he\nwouldn't respond to calling his name and\nknocking on the door death immediately\nreared in my mind and my heart\npalpitated with a pang I shouted my son\nis dead and I started sobbing savagely\nand uncontrollably my secretary drove me\nhome someone climbed to the rear window\nof his room and broke it then\nimmediately screamed to call the\nparamedics Leora her name's really judy\njudy ran to guys room the secretary\nfollowing on the steps Judy came out of\nthe room crying hysterically her paint\nthrobbing around me the paramedics came\nand she reentered the room with them but\nthey could only confirm guy's death I\nheld even more but did not have the\nstrength of mind to even think about\nentering guy's room I ran up and down\nback and forth in the house i sat I\nstood up against at again lay down on\nthe floor and twisted in all forms and\ndirections but I could not escape the\nterrible situation I screamed for my son\nand hope that he would immediately come\nout of the room I saw Judy breaking out\nfrom guy's room dashing past everyone in\nthe corridor ripping out her hair and\nrushing to her bedroom door slamming\nbehind her and I still twisted around in\nfrenzy this is not true how do I get out\nof this nightmare my mind raged where do\nI hide now for eternity at nights I\ncould not sleep\ndaydreaming deliriously about my son\nconversation and activity with me during\nthe day I had to face all those annoying\nfriends and colleagues who honestly with\ngood intentions were torturing me with\nthe meaningless words all of them\nrepeated endlessly as if they had\nrehearsed together you have your family\nto take care of as well as your police\nwork\nbe strong\nwhat's calling me but that one\n800-number is worse thing as if I needed\nto be told all this we're not for these\ncursed obligations I would emulate guys\nsuicide and be immediately released from\nthe pain and anyway how could i betray\nhis memory by tending to things as\nmeaningless and trivial as personal\nachievement status and career the\nconstant unbearable relentless pain\nweighing down on my chest like a hundred\ntanks parked on it and the need to\nperform work and other daily duties was\nnow utterly meaningless to watch people\ngoing places coming back talking and\ntoiling for reasons that now completely\nescaped me what is the meaning of all\nthis hassle and tussle I'm dead and\nthese people continue their daily\noccupations and I have to watch them and\nthey're utterly stupid ambitions and\nactivities to get rich to be powerful to\ndo this and that\nwhat for as life has already ended and\nwhy is it that I'm dead and they're\nalive and why is it\nthey have sons to continue their\nexistence after they're gone and where's\nmine while performing my duties as a\nlawyer here at police inspector when\nit's lawyer really I would feel sad\nenraged empty-headed and exalted\nconcurrently or alternate are\nalternatively why can't I also depart\nafter guy maybe I will find him\nsomewhere when I call him back in my\ndreams he only signals that it was time\nfor him to go on with his passage and\nnot for me I have family duties a city's\npopulation to protect here the same\npopulation who couldn't honestly give a\n[ __ ] about guys death anyone understood\nthe city's treatment of beat\nthe weeks and months passed black horror\nsettled in my mind my own darkness\nengulfed sucked it suffocated me\ninescapable misery constantly bashing my\nheart\ndashing wounds of unbearable pain\nmemories of my son melted my brain like\nbutter and boiling vapor driving me\ninsane and the worst was the\nimpossibility the absolute impossibility\nto run away and to vanish it disappear\nthere was nowhere to hide accept it\nbless his sleep came to me some nights\nafter many hours of twisting in my bed\nno appetite for food for sex your\nachievement whatsoever no ambition to\nmake even the slightest advance only the\nburden in my chest getting heavier every\nday and the nagging dread that in time I\nwill forget Gaia desert him that's why I\ncontinued living his dump like a zombie\nhorrific not only the loss of my son but\nmainly the loss of my old securities of\nthe confident man I used to think I was\ntougher of it I carefully read it take\nyour time slowly I began realizing that\nI was separated from life because my son\nwas my life and he would never return\nI'd lost my connection to the part of\nmyself that could not we thought my son\nsatisfied I'm more than that part of\nmyself which my son had reflected I'm\norange for me this was the unfolding of\nthe simple realization of why I felt\ndead among the living I went to the\nkitchen took a sleeping pill sagged back\ninside my bedroom and sank into a\nwelcome dreamless sleep\nthanks for sharing Batman yeah\nsomeone has to wrote that my dad wrote\nthat it's it's $0 on Kindle if you\nwanted I'll link it in the check so you\nwant a second to process and feel like\nwhat are you Oh someone said ad no I\nhate that people would think that no I'm\nnot trying to make you buddy dude anyway\nwhat were you feeling is that is you\nwere reading that it's hard to explain\ncuz uh you I think we talked about you\nknow there's a split brain experiment\nright with the left brain right brain\nit's not my analytical side of my brain\nit's not the left brain going off it's\nthe right brain and it doesn't speak\nyeah so I just feel I'm just it just\nhappens\nit just go like I just just start crying\nI can't control it I don't even think of\nthought consciously\nso I don't know exactly what I'm feeling\nI have to try to figure it out yeah so\ntell me what but I'm kind of just yeah\nso the first thing is I mean so you've\nread that many times before right yeah\ndoes this happen every time you read it\nyeah and does this feel let's start with\njust wide swaths does this feel good or\nbad\nwell when I was really depressed it it\nwould feel good because I felt better\nfeeling something and she's crying then\nbeing completely blank right now it\nfeels bad cuz I've been happy you've\nbeen unhappy I've been happy actually\nokay I've been happy these last few\nweeks I've been happy yeah except for\nthe around the holidays a little bit\nyeah and so do you so what I get from\nyou is a profound sense of sadness and\nloss and I Thea the thing that I don't\nunderstand is how much of that loss is\nfor you how much of that loss is for him\nand how much of that loss is for your\ndad my dad for sure I don't know I don't\nknow it's reckful I have a crazy-ass non\nsequitur question for you okay\nyeah sure do you want to have children\none day\nI always thought no scared they kill\nthemselves\nso this is important you're doing good\nby the way\nThanks and I was ready to jump into the\nwater but boy did you take the high dive\nyeah I thought I wanted to do I wanted\nto do it so there are a lot of different\ndirections I can go right now but I\nthink I'm gonna zero on them this one\nthing and we can explore the others\nlater in terms of what you're feeling\nand how to process those like that's\nthere's a part of me that says that we\nshould talk about helping you through\nthose feelings but there's another part\nof me that says I want to go to the core\nof this so when you think about having\nchildren that is a choice between life\nand not life living yeah and not living\nright and it's the same choice that your\ndad makes that's the same choice that he\ncan't make because he lives as a zombie\namongst a world of regular humans and\nhe's like dead on the inside and\neveryone around him is alive and living\nwith their petty ambitions and joys and\nfears and you just can't engage in that\nlife he can't and there's a really\ndangerous thing because if you move\ntowards life again that means that\nyou're leaving guy behind what why do\nyou say leaving behind I think that's\nhow your dad feels and if you go back\nand kind of read through it there's I\nsaw that that's how he feels yeah that\npart I don't I don't fully comprehend a\npart yeah yeah so I I think to a certain\nthe only way that I think that that\noverlaps with you is in sort of the\ndesire to have children or the lack\nthereof because you're saying that like\nthis is a part of life that I do not\nwant to engage in yeah right and his\ndifficulty is is that he like want he\ncan't engage in life because his son is\ndead\nyeah\nwhat are you feeling I had a thought\nthat I thought I'm still here how do you\nfeel about that no a little bit it was\ngot to stay hydrated chat you guys feel\nlike crying you should cry just let it\nout man it doesn't do any good staying\nin there\nwe'll talk about why I smile will ask\nreckful not a robot\n[Music]\nlong nosed break huh I washed my face -\nokay I'm good\ncan you hear me or you need headphones I\ndon't I don't know I can hear you\nwithout ya I have it set up where I have\nis always on the speakers and also on it\nbut yeah I was I forgot I didn't have\nthem on yes I didn't know if I was\ntalking to no one\nyeah\nwhat do you help me understand why you\nshared that today I think it's great\nthat you did it I'm really happy I\nthought it would give you a lot of\ninsight on my past and experiences and\nfrom a perspective of an adult at the\ntime because I was young and then like\nmaybe what my childhood might have been\nlike after that mm-hmm I think it says a\nlot and at the same time but that's not\na perspective on your childhood right\nthat's a perspective on your dad and we\ncan sort her what things were like yeah\nthat's what I'm saying yeah but I'm just\nI'm a little bit surprised\nto be honest that he asked you to edit\nthat at the age of 16 like that's some\npretty heavy stuff yeah do you remember\nwhat it was like reading it at the age\nof 16\nno got maybe I shut it out of my mind\nI mean I'm sure I felt summer Li mm-hmm\nI don't I mean those are the first seven\npages it's like a maybe 200 pages that's\nthe opening it those that's like page\nfive or something yeah okay interesting\nfeels like a climax you know just from a\nnarrative perspective yeah but and how\ndo you how are you feeling now what are\nyou feeling um a little\nor something feels nice to have shared\nit\nfeels like I uh feels like I got\nsomething off my chest\nyeah what did you get off your chest\nyou\nyou\nhmm I wonder\nyou already know I don't know try to\nfigure it out yeah something something\nso let's think about that so the first\nthing is you've read this before right\nbut when you read it before you don't\nlet's try to start actually by helping\nmaybe trying to understand like what is\ngoing instead of sort of defining\nspecifically what you got off your chest\nor how you're feeling better or what is\nfeeling better let's try to understand\nhow you're feeling better like what's\ngoing on inside you not from a specific\nsense but like what are the mechanics of\nokay generation so you've read this\nbefore and it evokes feelings of\nnegativity usually right and sometimes\nwhen you're feeling depressed it can\nfeel good because you say it feels you\nfeel something but I suspect that when\nyou're depressed and you read that part\nof what feels good is resonance it's\nkind of like when you when you have a\nbreakup and you listen to like breakup\nsongs they hurt but they also feel good\nbecause it's like resonant with the way\nthat you feel does that make sense\nokay so it's possible that it you know\njust feeling anything I mean very\npossible just the feeling of you're\nrelating to something yeah so that that\nlike you're not because if you think\nabout depression you're kind of alone\nand to know that like someone else out\nthere shares your sense of like abject\nhopelessness about the rest of life can\nsort of feel good and the fact that it\nwas your dad yeah and feel good too\nright because it's like at least your\ndad understands or you understand yeah\nand it makes sense it also I listen to a\nlot of musicians who shared some of\ntheir thoughts when I was in high school\nyeah so we look as human beings we look\nfor resonance but that's not what's\nhappening here right so sometimes you\nread it and then you feel these negative\nemotions but there's no metabolism I get\nthe sense that you're metabolizing\nsomething so I have a sense what do you\nmean by that yeah so that you have this\nthing inside you right like this thing\nthat is\na zombie I think that's a great way to\ndescribe it so for your dad losing a son\nZomba thighs him entirely but in your\ncase you were just a child and we sort\nof saw that there was a piece of you\nthat was zombified and that like this is\nlike sure maybe you have bipolar or\nwhatever I I really have no idea because\nI haven't like clinically assessed you\nfor that nor am i interested in doing\nthat that's not what the stream is about\nbut that you have something within you\nthat like changes the way that you carry\nit like you started carrying something\nthat day and you've carried it with you\nyour entire life and it's heavy in it's\nshitty and there are times where you\ntake it out of your satchel and you're\nlike you see it you hold it in your\nhands and those are the times that\nyou're depressed and so what I think me\nbelieve I disagree at the last part okay\nonly what I'm holding in my hands you\nthink I'm depressed no no no I don't\nthink only when you're depressed is when\nyou're holding it in your hands I don't\nthink if those are necessarily the same\nbut okay I think that some of your\ndepression relates to that or when you\nget into that depressive mindset that\nyour mind gravitates towards those\nthoughts or feelings or that those\nthoughts and feelings lead to your\ndepression I think there's some kind of\nconnection there but it's not it's not\nexclusive if that makes sense okay\nand so what I so I call this thing to\nsome scar so some scar is a ball of\nundigested emotion that's like kind of\nlike unprocessed and if we think about\ntherapy a lot of times the goal in\ntherapy is to process our experiences\nand so not have them with us in kind of\na raw form but to like understand them\nand kind of like process them so they no\nlonger like weigh on us in the same way\nand I think something about this very\nlike public sharing and not necessarily\nthat it has to be public I mean you\ncould have read it just to me but I\nthink there is there is some strength in\nsort of like you sharing this and in\nbringing this thing within you to light\nbecause it only it really thrives in the\ndarkness it doesn't thrive in the light\nand if we think about experiences of\nwhat do you mean by thrive for this\nthing I mean I think it grows and it\nsustains itself as long as it's hidden\nand that when you share if I if I share\nit then it can help it go away yeah so I\nthink I mean if we think about for\nexample funerals in the grieving process\nthe grieving process is semi public and\nsemi private but for some reason human\nbeings have evolved in basically every\nculture that when loss happens we share\nthat grief and that somehow has like a\nbetter impact whereas when you have a\nloss that's very private and no one else\nknows it like digs deeper so I don't\nknow exactly how that works it's just\nsort of like anthropologic principle\nyeah I like that analogy\nyeah the funeral and and so I mean when\nI think about your family I think when\nyou guys go there the reason that\nsomething's missing is because something\nis to be blunt and secondly because I\ndon't know if you guys ever talk about\nit right but there can there can be like\nUnion and community and strength in all\nof you guys sharing your feelings and\nlike actually acknowledging that you\nmiss your brother and that he's gone and\nthat it's shitty that he's gone\nand your dad you know God I'm curious we\nwere gonna say less Lester first and the\nlast thing is that you know I think that\nyour dad lost his son but he also lost a\nson and I think it's fine for you to not\nbe able to live for power or promotion\nbut I think there's plenty to live for\nwith you and your other brother and\npresumably his wife your mom right I'm\nnot saying that he is not allowed to\nfeel devastated and destroyed and like\nhe wants to escape but like let's\nremember that because I remember feeling\nthis way when when I actually so when I\nlost my dad\nmy grandmother kept on wailing about how\nshe lost her son she lost her son she\nlost her son at some point I got pissed\noff because I was like you still have\nthree children that are alive and you\nlike one of them is your son and and\nit's sort of like she never kind of and\nit was almost I don't know how much I'm\nyou know interpreting things but I could\nalmost see the pain in my uncle's face\nthat like she don't like she had lost\neverything make sense no and and so I\nthink that there's you know I get that\nyour dad is feeling grief and devastated\nand I can't really know what that's like\nand it's easy for me to say you know\nthere's a way forward but I think\ndefinitely in your case there is and\nhopefully in his case there is and\npeople have lost children before and in\nin my grandmother's case like I know\nthat she can still find joy in the world\nwith my dad passing away because I'm\nalive and my brothers alive and she\nlikes my kids a lot so she happens to\nthink that my oldest daughter is my dad\nreincarnated I don't know she's a\ngreat-grandmother yep okay so she's old\nand and we just saw her over the break\nwhen I was at Houston actually uh-huh\nand and so I think that there's still\njoy and people in in chat were wondering\nwhy I was smiling when you were like\ndevastated like what do you feel when I\nsmile reckful\nI assume that when you're smiling\nsomething clicked in your brain a\ncertain way to treat my situation okay\nthat is sometimes true but most of my\nsmile doesn't come from clicking because\nthat's like analytical and it also\ndoesn't come from treating I don't smile\nbecause I think I know how to help you I\ndon't smile because of a particular\nthought I smile because I have hope I\nhave smiled because when I look at you I\nsmile because when I look at you I see\nsomeone who's starting to like UNH's\nAmba fie mm-hmm I smile because I am\nstarting to exam if I yeah and I smile\nbecause I can see it happening and it's\na beautiful thing\nThanks I smile because I ask you the\nquestion are you gonna have kids one day\nand I hope the answer is yes because\nyou're gonna know a joy that I don't\nknow that it's gonna outweigh any grief\nbecause I haven't lost a brother yet but\nit sure outweighs the grief of losing a\nfather and that your life can be full\nbut what you were saying about how your\ngrandma thought she lost everything when\nyour father died yeah and that your\nuncle was sad I don't feel sad about my\nthat because if your uncle had died\nmaybe she would have I assume she would\nhave also felt like she lost everything\nI think she could have lost any son any\nor daughter and feel like she lost\neverything same with my dad if he had\nlost me he would also feel like you lost\neverything or if you had lost Gary he\nwould also feel like I lost everything I\nthink each of us is everything you know\nyeah\nbut that's why I smile why are you\nsmiling\nyeah because I'm relating to you what\nare you relating to loss of a family\nmember\nyeah I'm curious have you ever talked to\nyour dad about that when he says about\nthe dream is that you said something\nabout like when he says he has a dream\nwhere he sees your he sees guy and guy\ntells him that it was his time yeah\nthose those kind of things I not more\ninterested in now that you mentioned it\nbut usually I dismiss it all try not to\nthink things like that but dreams why\nnot why do you dismiss it not sure I'm\ntrying to think about it there's a lot\nof things I dismiss in my life all the\ntime and avoid or ignore and I recently\nstopped started doing it less I kind of\nwant to talk about that like I that's a\nbig reason why you may be feeling better\nyeah just just little things are\nchanging so I'm able to like clean my\nroom and you know like do laundry and I\ndon't know put things away and just\nthings were always very hard for me like\nit would weigh on me to do it and I do\nit I'm like oh I see the benefit of this\nit feels better in here now yeah\n[Music]\nbut uh why did I bring that up I brought\nit up for a reason yeah I think it's a\nvery important so rifles I think what\nyou're starting to do is become whole\nyou're starting to become a complete\nperson and so far in your life you've\nlived a life of two-faced in this\nbecause you've got the zombie miss\nwithin you and then you try to live this\nlife outside of it right like there it's\na struggle between pushing that grief\ndown and pushing it away and trying to\nforget and trying to twist away in a\ndirection that you can never twist away\nand then you try to build this life that\neveryone tells you you have to build but\nit's not authentic it's not complete\nit's like on or off and so life is not\ncomplete or whole and what I see that I\nthink is actually like what I'm hoping\nfor and I think I see it is that you're\nstarting to integrate you're starting to\nlet these feelings kind of come out and\nyou're you're accepting them you're\naccepting your loss in a way that you\nknow you kind of didn't have a choice\nlike I don't know that you've ever\nreally accepted it and I think you're in\nthe process of accepting it having a\nchoice I think would be even harder\nbecause if I feel like if I felt like I\ncould have saved him that way on me more\nno I mean I don't know I didn't know I\nfelt like I was too young well yeah so I\ndon't\nyes I I mean so you don't have a choice\nin losing him but you do have a choice\nin letting him go yeah right I don't\nknow if that makes sense but it and it's\nnot that letting him go means that you\ndon't love him and it's not that letting\nhim go doesn't mean that you miss him\nand that you envision a life where\nbecause I mean this is the thing right\nevery time you look at a Christmas photo\nof like the four of you guys and\neveryone's smiling there's like one\nperson missing and that's gonna make I\nmean you're you're empathic and you're\ngonna look at those smiles and you're\ngonna be able to tell that in that\nChristmas photo no one is smiling\ngenuinely and when you look at other\nphotos and you see those people smiling\nyou can tell the difference between snow\nif their eyes yeah right\ngenuine fake smile fake smile yeah\nwhat's this it's our it's hard to look\nat it that's really yeah and so when you\nare home and everyone goes through the\nmotions it's because there's the thing\nthere's this like miasma of something\nmissing before we continue is there\nanything wrong with the microphone I can\neverything's perfect I haven't checked\nyeah usually I check more yeah I think\neverything's fine on my own\nokay good okay um so where was I going I\nwas talking about how I can start doing\nlaundry and things I'm yeah okay so I\nwas listening you talked to destiny and\nyou were talking about how everyone has\nbeen asking you about psychedelics and I\nwas swimming it's cuz I brought it up\nand that it's it's a little bit annoying\nfor you actually that everyone maybe\nthat everyone's asking about\npsychedelics cuz you don't view it as\nthe way to climb the mountain right it\nwas an out yeah yeah uh because it just\nkind of gets you to the peak of the\nmountain right away and you want people\nto more slowly learn with meditation and\nsome other ways to how to calm their\nmind something I thought took the condom\non yeah I heard you explaining to him\nyeah probably not saying how you said it\nexactly but I want to say that I think\nthat's so Simon saved my life because\nsince I wouldn't have had the pain\nfrom a state of depression to to believe\nthat I could be happy and since it got\nme to the top of the mountain right away\nand I saw happiness and I realized it\nwas possible then it uh\ngave me hope yeah that's why I was\nwondering what you think I was wanting\nwhat you think about that I mean I I\nthink that's great that that happened to\nyou I think so to be clear I don't want\npeople to use psychedelics or not use\npsychedelics I think so here's so here's\nwhat I think about psychedelics so the\nfirst thing to understand is that\nthere's a new wave of treatments being\nstudied in psychiatry psilocybin MDMA\nketamine these are traditionally like\ndrugs of abuse but they're not like\nnecessarily euphoric right so ketamine\nand psychedelics aren't necessarily like\neuphoric MDMA can be done dimma is but\nand so we're starting to realize like as\na scientific psychiatric and neuro\nscientific community that these have\ntherapeutic value so I don't dispute\nthat at all I've had patients of my own\nwho have had so one of my patients has\nhad an opiate addiction or just all\nkinds of addictions since the age of 13\nand he's like around 30 now and he's\ncomfortable with me sharing this general\nstuff on the Internet because he wants\nto you know let people know and and so\nhe's been struggling with all kinds of\ntreatments has seen like all kinds of\npsychiatrists and stuff including myself\nand was still struggling and then went\nto down to like Costa Rica or something\nin a got treatment with ibogaine and it\nwas like transformative for him and so I\nthink these ibogaine is like another\nit's like an herb that is like sort of\nhallucinogenic but ayahuasca sort of but\nthe other thing that ibogaine does is\nreduce the severity of opiate withdrawal\nsymptoms which can make people feel like\nthey're dying\nso opiate withdrawal is a really really\nlike painful process but it also has\npsychedelic qualities I'm not advocating\nfirst for its use it's not fda-approved\nthere really aren't many studies around\nit or anything like that but I\nit's not that I want people to do\nsomething or I don't want people to do\nsomething I think there's clear evidence\nthat there's value and I think that\nthere are shortcomings so for example I\nwent and I hung out on my discord the\nother day which is actually really cool\nso I didn't realize that our discord had\nit now as like thousands of people in it\nand yes yeah and so I was like I was\nlike wow like let me just go hang out\ncuz I used to hang out on my discord all\nthe time when there were like eight\npeople there in like 2019 but um and and\nso I went on there people were talking\nin this one guy mentions he says like\nyeah I think like the psilocybin is\ngreat because this one guy lost 200\npounds after using psilocybin I thought\nthat's so cool and he was a friend of\nmine oh okay yeah so he so yeah I think\nthey mentioned something about that and\nand so they were kind of talking about\ndebating like the benefits of like\nmeditation or psilocybin and if you can\nget there with psilocybin and lose 200\npounds and this guy lost 200 pounds from\npsilocybin I introduced them to it yeah\nso then why why why bother meditating\nand I think that's fine too so like I'm\nnot disputing that people have had\npositive experiences in fact the data\nsuggests that people have positive\nexperiences with some of these\nsubstances the question is what is the\nprobability that someone if I take a\nhundred people who are overweight and I\ngive them psilocybin what is the\nprobability that they'll lose weight\nyou're asking me yeah I mean I think\nthat's the question III think because\nyou're asking this question that it\nseems like you have never tried it I've\nnever tried so incitement\nyeah so if you had you would think it's\npretty high no I'm not you step back\nyeah yeah maybe you're not saying it\nslow yeah yeah as it helps you step back\nfrom your day-to-day perspective and day\nto day you might be thinking something\nlike oh I really want cheesecake or a\nSnickers bar but then if you are on cell\nSymon\nyou're looking at your life is a little\nmore long-term and you're thinking oh if\nI don't eat a Snickers bar or cheesecake\nright now I'll feel better in the future\nand you can really feel it you really\nsee that that's true and that's why it\nhelped my friend lose 200 pounds yeah so\nI'm not I don't mean that question so I\nrecognize that often times people who\nask those kinds of questions imply that\nthe number is low I'm not implying that\nthe number is low I'm actually I was\nthinking you I wasn't necessarily okay\nso for example I think the number would\nbe I mean I have no idea I think the\nnumber would be I don't know okay we\nhave we need a base I think would be\nhigher than if you gave them any other\ntreatment possible so for example like\nthere's one study on MDMA where they\njust took normal healthy people and they\nin a controlled substance old\nenvironment they give them it gave them\nMDMA and they had therapists like\nprocess whatever they experienced\nthrough the MDMA yeah and then something\nlike they it was a small sample size so\nlike 25 people but like 80 or 90% of the\npeople thought it was one of the most\npositive experiences in ever in their\nlife and I think none of these were at\nany history of MDMA excuse so they I\nmean use so they kind of like they\nranked it up there with like the birth\nof their children and things like that\nin terms of like how significant it was\nyeah you mind opening I think it helps\nyou remember how much you love other\npeople things like that but MDMA you\ncan't really take that all the time so\nyeah be like a once in a while\ntransformative experience but if you\ntake it all the time I think it destroys\nyour serotonin receptors\nwhereas with mushrooms there haven't\nbeen enough studies but you can take it\nway more often and it doesn't have\nadverse effects that have yet been\ndocumented right yeah so so I mean my\ngeneral take first of all is that we\ndon't know but there does seem to be\ngood suggestions of therapeutic and\nuseful indications I mean I have lots of\nfriends who have used to Lucinda gins\nand stuff like that and really love them\nand and swear by the experiences so I\nwant you to try psilocybin at least once\nbecause then I give you so much\nperspective I mean it is getting\nfda-approved right then you need to know\nwhat you're dealing with if you're\ntalking to a patient who's gonna try it\nafter it's after it's completely legal\nfor the pressure uh-huh then for you to\nreally put yourself in their mindset you\nwould have to have tried it once and I\nthink if you try it and I it would make\nme really happy because then I feel like\nI can dive deep with you and relate so\nlet's just unpack that for a second do\nyou think you'd be open to that um I'm\nopen to talking about it okay okay so\nlet's first start with do you think that\nlet's start with this you're you're\nassuming that you you have a very\nimportant assumption right which is that\nif I better if I haven't experienced\nmyself my ability to help other people\nis improved yes so I agree with that\nassumption in I agree with that\nassumption so part of the reason that\nlike I work and resonate with gamers as\nopposed to people who are addicted to\nheroin or alcohol is because I know what\nit's like to play video games for like\n16 hours a day and have my life go\nnowhere whereas I haven't had quite that\nexperience with alcohol and I think that\nthose experiences are different so I\nagree with that and at the same time\nthen you've also related to to loss of a\nfamily member and that helped me talk to\nyou sure but I think the loss of a so my\nexperience of losing my dad was very\ndifferent from you losing your brother\nso I would say yeah but yeah I think it\nwas actually very very different so this\nI think is one of the dangers right is\nthat you assume that my loss was similar\nto your loss but I don't think any were\nsimilar at all because I barely grieve\nfor my dad at all\nand it was kind of a weird so I was I\nwas very sad for a brief period of time\nand it was a grief but I kind of watched\nmy grief in a very detached way and\nreally wasn't very I mean I was upset\nlike I felt the sadness and I felt the\nloss but I also was bizarrely detached\nfrom it in the same way that you're sort\nof describing in psilocybin you're like\noh I don't want to eat a Snickers bar in\nyour power like the power of that\nSnickers bar to alter your life and your\nthinking is low and that's how I felt\nabout my dad's grief that I was grieving\nbut you know I saw everyone around me\nbeing affected and I just actually felt\na deep sense of peace underneath all of\nthe grief I felt like a really profound\nand it was one of the most positive\ntransformative experiences for me in\nterms of like securing me in my\nmeditation practice why did you feel a\ndeep sense of peace but did you feel a\nsense of peace because you were able to\ndeal with it so well I don't think I was\ndealing so dealing with it is of the\nmind so the thing that the reason that\nwas so powerful for me is because there\nis something that I found within myself\nwhich was calm and neutral and peaceful\nwhich sometimes when you meditate like\nif people have been meditating on my\nstream and stuff like that and even when\nwe meditate sometimes you can find some\ndegree of like this weird like no mind\npeaceful place and I thought that that\nwould be shattered by grief because\ngenerally speaking the more emotional I\nbecame positive or negative the more you\nshatter kind of like this peaceful\nmeditative state does that make sense\nmaybe not okay no it does because the\nuse you talked about how the meditative\nstate is when the mind is often omit\nyeah so the really fascinating thing is\nI saw that that that thing within me\nthat felt like blissful and peaceful was\nthere despite the grief so my whole\nunderstanding of like mind in this thing\nbeing separate I had read about it and I\nhad experienced it in a lot of different\nways but really crystallized during that\nthat part of my life when I watched it\nwhen I first saw my dad's corpse and\nlike I was overwhelmed that like that's\nit he's actually gone and you can see\nhim and I remember like touching his\nface and he\nwas like cold like an ice cube and it's\nsuch a strange experience to like have\nsomeone who you don't even realize like\nyou touch people all the time especially\nyour family members and they're always\nlike warm and soft right like it's kind\nof weird like when you shake someone's\nhand their hand isn't cold it's like\nthere's life in there and like when I\ntouched him I remember thinking like\nthat life is gone in such a shocking I\nmean it sort of hit me there I I saw him\nbut it was really when I touched him\nthat I was sort of like it hit me that\nthis guy is gone and that he will never\nbe here again and I'll never be able to\ntalk to him and I had a lot of grief and\nstuff not really so much for my loss of\nhim but the thing that I was the most\nupset about is that he was I remember\nthe day that I got in medical school he\njust started crying because I had been\nstruggling to get into medical school\nfor a while and he was kind of worried\nit's really cute like that and I hadn't\nseen him cry like that I mean he just\nlike broke down and he said that you're\ngonna be amazing\nhe's like nothing is gonna stop you now\nyou are amazing yeah you're really good\nat what you do you helped me a lot yeah\nI've talked to a lot of psychiatrist and\nhe saw that right he saw that like you\nknow when I mean I had a 2.6 GPA and was\nstruggling to get into medical school I\nnever thought I'd be faculty at Harvard\nMedical School and and he said like\nnothing is gonna be able to stop you and\nthat you should do good and you should\nhelp people that's really cute yeah\nand so what-what I was sad about is\nactually that he didn't get to see that\nso eight months after I got into medical\nschool he passed away and and so the\nthing that makes me sad like I remember\nlike the day that that I match Tennessee\nbe happy I'm sorry I won't my dad to see\nme happy before he does good hope you\nsee me happy now yeah so I come back to\nmy earlier question reckful is do you\nwant to have kids\nthink now if I could stay happy then and\nlet's say like five years go by and I am\nstill stable mmm\nand yeah I would want to yeah yeah so\nI'm not you know pressuring you to have\nchildren but I think it's it captures a\nlot of I think if you decide that that's\nthe right thing for you and you have\nchildren one day I think a lot of the\nthings that we're talking about in terms\nof your dad being able to see you truly\nhappy you know it's gonna bring up a lot\nof sense of sorrow and loss but there's\ngonna be like the other side of the coin\nand and you you know the goal here is to\nlive like an integrated life where you\nhave sorrow and pain and suffering and\nyou also have not just endurance because\nmost people just tank their way through\nit right but that you have like you have\njoy and and accomplishment and that all\nof these things like life is about all\nof those things and the more that you\nbring all of those things together the\nmore complete your life will be and the\ngoal of life is not to not the avoidance\nof pain and suffering right because\nthat's what we gravitate towards we want\nan easy job we want more money we want\nmore comfort we want people to love us\nwe want to be like respected and loved\nand all this kind of stuff but you want\nthe whole spectrum the shitty and the\ngun yeah I feel that because like I was\nsaying before well yeah the days that\nit's hard for me to put it to words but\nthe days where I'm crying about\nsomething make life feel meaningful for\nsure what I really want from life I want\nto feel a wonderful connection with\npeople i working on Neverland it's been\nmaking me feel like I'm with\ntogether to accomplish a goal that feels\namazing and I don't you don't get that\nas much from streaming cuz streaming is\nmore of a solo job for most people and\nit's isolating whereas the game\ndevelopments a wholesome and happy I\nlove it so that's why I've tried to\ntransition a little bit yeah still like\nstreaming once in a while though because\nsharing emotion feels great yeah and and\nso like this is the thing that really\nblows my mind it's like we've always\nthought that I mean this isn't therapy\nbut that generally speaking the this the\nsharing of emotions and like airing you\nknow our deepest darkest feel feelings\nand thoughts and stuff should be done in\nprivate like what the [ __ ] man doing in\na public that's really yeah it's the\nworst to just keep it private yeah I\nthink so I think in in my mind like this\nstuff grows and this is kind of what I\nwas saying and and you would express\nsome confusion because I don't think I\nwas being clear but that like these\nthings like our negative feelings when\nthey exist within us and we don't show\nthem to the world they actually compound\nand there's a really interesting example\nof this that two sides one is that if\nyou think about trauma so when I work\nwith people who have a history of trauma\nand they like you know if they've been\nlike abused as children and the abuse is\nongoing its private and it kind of like\nlives inside them and no one ever sees\nit and it just eats them alive in the\nlonger time that goes on and the more\nthey keep it within them like the worse\nand worse it gets even if the trauma\nstops at some point as long as that\nthing is within them it just grows it's\nlike a cancer the other really\ninteresting thing is if you look at the\nspiritual practice of mantra or mantra I\nthink that actually operates under the\nsame principles so a month or is\nsomething that is chanted in secret so\nyou're given a month row by a guru and\nthen you chant it you don't tell anyone\nwhat it is in my experience of mantra\nhas been like the more private that I\nkeep it like the more it sort of grows\nwithin me and it's kind of like it\ndoesn't I don't let it out the only\ndifference is that it's positive instead\nof negative which is kind of like really\ninteresting but I think that\njust this general principle about human\nbeings in psychology that like what is\nwithin us like we don't let it out it\nkind of compounds yeah and I think that\nthere's a big difference between even\nthough the emotions that you feel when\nyou read that thing because I think I\nmean you knew what you were getting into\nbut something within you gravitate it\nlike you just pulled that out right like\nyou were like you're like I mean I'm\nsure you've thought about it but like no\none else at least I mean I had no\ninkling I don't know if you told me you\nknow it's kind of like I didn't tell you\nyeah so like no I knew I wanted to share\nit yeah so like you shared it and then\nyou there's some part of you that knows\nit's kind of like you know if you give a\na 1 year old like a glass of water and\nthey're thirsty they're gonna drink it\nthere's some part of you that is hungry\nfor licious and to share yeah and to not\nhave it be like stuck within you because\nit's been stuck within you for a long\ntime yeah it really is and so I think\nthis is different this reading is\ndifferent this reading has the sense of\nmetabolism to me that you're turning it\nfrom one thing into another thing\nturning it from one thing into another\nthing so I'm trying to turn this ball of\ngrief and loss into into what I mean I\ndon't I don't think that it stops being\ngrief or loss to be clear it's just it\nbecomes like a positive grief or loss\nlike I don't know how else to put it so\nwhen I think about you know the work\nthat I do like I was directionless and\npurposelessness purposely did not\npurpose and in that direction and we do\nwe do need to think of a way to wear\nthis because it's it makes sense to\nshare the grief it becomes a positive\nthing that we don't know where it right\nyeah so I mean I I can tell you kind of\nwhat I I don't know specifically about\ngrief but I think like what happens is\nthe negative parts of us and this is so\nwhat I've come to realize is the things\nthat we view is negative become a part\nof who we are and that allows us to be\nthe person that we need to be and the\nperson that we need to be is what doing\nyour Dharma is tautomerize duty or\nresponsibility I could not do my Dharma\nunless I was the summation of all of my\nexperiences up until this point right so\nI don't think now I feel like part of my\nduty is to help other depressed people\nwho have been in my experience\nabsolutely right so yeah and it wouldn't\nit wouldn't have happened yes this is\nwhat's important about Dharma it's not\nabout pain it's not about comfort it's\nabout like when the first time we talked\nreckful my life was a summation of\nexperiences where I needed to be\nsomething for you and I could not be\nthat thing for you unless I take in my\nnegative experiences and turn them into\nsomething that you could relate to or\nthat I could relate to within you that I\nyou know I took the person that I am\nincluding all of the good and all of the\nbad and that's what allows me to be the\nperson that I am because I do understand\nher and I do understand loss and I do\nunderstand directionless and in your\ncase grief and loss you know seem like\nnegative things and they absolutely are\nnegative things but they're also not\nnegative things they're just a thing and\nwhether it's negative or positive is a\nvalue judgment that the mind places upon\nit which you should understand since\nyou've done psilocybin that negative and\npositive is not real it's what we\nattribute to it and that a thing is just\nto think somebody just gifted as\nbazillion subs on my stream I don't even\nknow Charlotte ninety-three thank you\nfor that by the way yeah people people\nsupporting uh dr. K and content like\nthis I think it is very important and\nsince dr. K has decided to yeah you sent\na lot of your colleagues we're doubting\nthat this would be a good idea for you\nto go online and do this and I'm really\nhappy you did it because you're a AoE\nhealing instead of single target yes\nthey still don't know yeah they'll find\nout yes that'd be ridiculous\nbut I right before that right before I\nsaid that I had something to tell you\nwhat were you just talking about well so\nearly are you asking me about psilocybin\nand then we kind of got off on on the\ntangent of grief and loss in parma\npurpose like understanding that things\nare just before just before someone\ngifted about you so that there is no\ndifference between positive and negative\nthat like those are valid only apply\nyeah this gets a little difficult for me\nbecause we can start you can you could\nsay that about more and more things in\nlife that there's no such thing as this\nright there's no such thing as the\nUnited States we made it up right there\nborders we made up in her head right and\nwe just wrote it down that it exists or\nthere's no such thing as money it's just\nnumbers that we write down that exist\nbecause we wrote him down and companies\nno such thing right I mean sort of right\nyeah we could say there's no such thing\nyou can keep saying there's no such\nthing about a lot of things but these\nthings are inter subjective things that\ndo they exist for us but objectively\nthey don't exist no so what I'm talking\nabout so I'm not talking about right\nright I know I know I know it's a little\ndifferent you're saying there's no such\nthing as a positive or negative\nexperience it's at what we attribute to\nit so and somebody else sorry it\npeople are just gifting just gigantic\namounts of subs so thanks low DPM thank\nyou\nlike people are gifting with fifty or\nhundred subs so that isn't say thank you\nguys so though such things a positive or\nnegative experience so reckful yeah yeah\nI'm trying to think it through I have to\ncritically think about it don't think\ndon't think close your eyes\nsit up straight now before we do this\nokay notice keeps reading anyway I can't\nblow my nose but I'm also sick I'm sick\ndon't worry about it next time go to\nnext go I want to do it I want to do\nthis bridge I just we won't do breathing\nthat no I want to do it I love it was\ngood but I just keep my feel bad I keep\ngoing I hear but you'll have things to\ntalk about with them well I've got I'll\nget a drink I'll think so by the Solow\nDPM dude you have gifted like gigantic\namounts of subs several times so I'm\nvery grateful for your support and also\nlet me I don't know how to delicately\nask this but do you need help because\nlike something tells me that if\nsomething is resonating with you and\nthis deeply and you need help just let\nme know right so I'm not trying to say\nthat I don't appreciate your support but\nlike there's a part of me that just\nwanders a little bit about\nyou know what like is it just that\nyou're just a super positive supportive\nperson who wants to see the world become\na better place like I can completely\nunderstand that 90% of the chance is\nthat that's what's going on but there's\na small part of me that sometimes says\nthat the people who go out of their ways\nto help others are the ones who have\nfelt hurt really bad\nright so if I think about like people\nwho do like trauma support and things\nlike that there are people who have\nexperienced trauma before and and so\nthere's a part of me that actually like\nfeels some strange sense of compassion\nlike I'm very grateful for all the\nsupport you're providing and stuff like\nthat but at the same time like I just\nwonder you know because a lot of times\npain and suffering can turn into\nsomething really positive I mean that's\nexactly what we're talking about but if\nyou do need help you know let me know\nand it's okay to need help and thank you\nso yeah I'm talking I'm talking to\nreckless chair yeah so I think we did we\ndid what we did we did the hype train\nand now we're getting lots of subs\nokay so diagnose the chair so in order\nto diagnose this chair we must use this\naccent or should we do the Indian one we\ncan talk about it okay so the chair has\nis an Everland chair do you see that he\nhas it he sees the video game yes to\nsurround himself this is the video game\nand we will do the meditation well now I\nfeel like I felt inspired to do\nmeditation but now reckful is gonna come\nback and I don't know what to do now I'm\nuninspired\n[Music]\nbecause I feel like sometimes I get\ninspired to like teach meditation but\nnow it's like the rhythm is broken I\nknow right we talked about this last\ntime it's like he spends a lot of time\nin the bathroom blowing his nose he was\nwashing his face last time so I mean\nhe's probably just peeing also I think\npart of the reason that reckful could be\nfeeling better is because he has\nsunlight now do you guys remember the\ndungeon that used to stream from before\nit was like dark and now there's like\nlight which is amazing do you guys feel\ndepressed you should get your vitamin D\nchecked go talk to your primary care\nphysician about that very common\nespecially in northeastern climate like\nnorthern climates also if you're\ndark-skinned so if you're like have dark\nskin like your Indian or Hispanic or\nLatino or African or african-american or\nwhatever or Southeast Asian Filipino and\nyou live in like the northern hemisphere\nyou have to be careful because our\nbodies are very inefficient at producing\nvitamin D because we lived in climates\nwhere there was a lot of sun exposure so\nif you live in a climate where there's a\nwhole lot of light chances are you're\nmore vitamin D deficient than your\nCaucasian friends so if you're like\nScandinavian like Scandinavian people\nhave like a very good vitamin D\nproduction because they just don't get a\nwhole lot of light whereas like people\nwho are brown like myself have very poor\nvitamin D per production so get it\nchecked\nyou\nso someone is up dojo blue thanks for\nthe subs I guess while we're waiting for\nreckful I'm just gonna thank people for\nsubs Andy Milonakis\nthanks for the subs bro\nAndy\nwhere I'm confused\nwho's Andy Milonakis it sounds are they\njust saying that because your name is\nAndy or you like the Andy from like\nHarvard Andy and CEO Andy is that the\nAndy that all Andy's are so you're here\nat the Andy Andy yeah that's what I'm\nwondering like anyway you seem to be a\nfamous person so thank you for your\nsupport and I mean I don't know like you\nguys tell me that someone is someone\nAndy so I just assumed and then people\nare going nuts so so welcome to the\nstream my dude and you're the Andy Andy\nI mean what are you best what are we\ndoing but I just spilled orange juice on\nmy carpet so once okay how does one go\nto blow their nose and spill orange\njuice on the carpet like can we just I\nwas gonna get a drink after blowing my\nnose\nokay\noh [ __ ] sorry it's just cuz I wanted to\nread chat and anyway I was gonna like\nget all ready to meditate but now I just\nI I feel like my rhythm is broken we can\ngo we can finish our conversation about\npsilocybin then maybe we can meditate\nyeah I think we're talking 2ls soon okay\nokay umm sorry but I I was gonna\nmeditate in a particular way but I\nforgot what that was cuz I just got\nthrown off base I was thinking maybe we\ncould just finish our conversation about\nso psilocybin and that way before I've\nbeen doing that breathing exercise you\ntold me this is up yeah good how do you\nlike it I'm not sure I'm doing exactly\ncorrectly okay so can you do it one time\nyeah sure so show me what you're doing\nactually let's let's start there you\nshould stop at like 33\nyou\ngood yeah so are you contracting your\nstomach are you abdominal breathing\nbecause I see a lot of chest movement so\nso when you breathe in Tibet yes sir I\nmean like not like bad but like Bali\nbreathe so you want abdominal so you\nwant abdominal contraction more than\nchest how do I do that so this is what I\nwant you to do sit up straight and I\nwant you to as you breathe in push your\nbelly out as far as it'll go\nokay sit up straight as I breathe in\npush my belly out as far as it will go\nokay here we go\nwait I said breathe in push my belly up\nyeah you feel that you can expand it\njust pull\nyeah that's right good so so okay try\nless hard just in a more relaxed manner\nso just as you breathe in just your your\nnavel is going out your bellybutton is\nmoving out right so imagine that your\nbellybutton is pulling out and you're\nsucking the air in through a vacuum does\nthat work better\nyeah well he's worried I'm getting\ntricked into thinking I'm doing it but I\ncould stick my belly out or whatever you\nknow so like like you know imagine\nyou're letting your paunch hang out and\nyou're just taking like a nice big\nbreath like you've just eaten you know\nlike some good Texas barbecue you just\nwent to the Salt Lick and then you're\nlike if I stand up can we know if I'm\ndoing it better yeah you have to turn to\nthe side though\nokay sure okay so I'm gonna turn to the\nside okay yeah\ncan't see my face does it matter no no\nwe don't see your face we need to see\nher okay here we go\ngood okay so here's the okay so okay and\nwhen you breathe out close your eyes\ndon't look close your eyes imagine\nyou're pulling your belly button towards\nyour spine as you breathe out and you're\nexpelling all of the air out of your\nchest I'm pulling my belly button\ntowards my spine okay does that make\nsense or is the imagery confuse does it\nmake sense it's not like I have a [ __ ]\nit's not like I have a solid frame of\nunderstanding of what you're saying but\nI could kind of try and yeah yeah I'm\njust I'm just saying so breathe in and\nout and let your belly move in when you\nbreathe in let me start belly move out\nyou okay oh someone has a good\nsuggestion lay on the floor you put a\nbook on your stomach\nthat's a great suggestion all right\nis it bad if I don't own a book just put\nput something on your stomach something\nthat we can see yeah that great that's\nokay\njust lay down good we can see you good\ngood and out there we go let him let him\nall the way down all the way down all\nthe way down there we go this has gotta\nbe hilarious for people who are just\ntrying to don't like what the [ __ ] is\ngoing on okay we're gonna kill right\nokay no breathing no breathing reckful\nthat's enough so this is a horrible\nattempt at meditation is what this is\nokay that's okay just bring the chair\nback you shouldn't you shouldn't do\nbreathing meditations when you're sick\ndude it's not good yeah it's okay okay\nalso people are like super super\nconfused about what's happening which is\ngreat sure what were you talking okay so\nwe're talking about getting you to try\npsilocybin yes so let's just so let's\ntake a step back the reason that I was\nasking you to do this so we can we can\nwe're gonna or both of your nostrils\nequally clogged the right ones a little\nmore clogged okay so we're gonna do that\nsame left gang right gang thing that we\ndid last time yeah at the end but we'll\ntalk about psilocybin and the point that\nI was going to make with meditation is\nthat when you meditate you experience\nthe sensation the sensation is not good\nor bad\nright like so life is just experiences\nand we tend to I mean my argument falls\nshort even in my own head whenever I\nthink we tend to pick one experiences as\ngood or bad yeah so I would I would\nassociate it with good the meditation\nexperience because it's calming and I\nthink it releases endorphins maybe it\nseems like it does you you it's\nsomething something feels like it's\ntingling in my brain after I meditate it\nfeels really yes so I mean this is an\nassociation work we're deciding that\nit's good no no but I think the reason\nit's good is because we sit with an\nexperience without associations that's\nwhat feels good like we what we feel\nwhat feels good is when our mind is not\nassociating or placing value judgments\non things\nmonka hmm right and and so when we\nmeditate it actually we're just sitting\nwith an experience fully and that's why\nI'm like mindful eating or like mindful\nlike instagramming or mindfully like\nwatching the sunset is so great because\nlike the more that you just do something\nwithout like your mind a tributing a\nvalue judgment to it so my favorite\nexercises that I ask my patients to step\nin dog [ __ ] so we work our way up to you\nreally\nyeah barefoot so what we do is like I\nlike that because because the thing is\nlike if you think about the experience\nof stepping and dog [ __ ] is not bad\nright like the actual sensation of\nstepping in dog [ __ ] is not bad yeah\nactually it's probably kind of smushy in\na nice way\nit's just like it's just like if you\nstick your toe in the mud but stepping\nin dog [ __ ] is but yeah but the\nexperience is different from the value\nthat we apply to it so you don't they're\nlike safety concerns too because if\nwe've got a caught on your foot or\nsomething you could get infected but my\npoint is that like the that we apply a\nlot of attributes to the experiences\nthat we have yeah and in my experience\nmy experience has been that the more you\ncan sit with an experience purely the\nless bad it becomes and that's sitting\nwith an experience purely is sort of a\nrelatively like enjoyable blissful State\nand when you decide I'm saying that\nsitting with an aren't you saying that\nthe experience of sitting with an expiry\nwithout thinking about whether it's good\nor bad is a good experience yes yes\nthat's exactly what I'm saying\nand I would argue that when you think\nabout the way that you describe so for\nexample I just got a $100 donation so\nthank you all tomorrow and and so I\nthink that that's a good thing but if I\nwere fully tranquil that would be no\ndifferent than getting a $1 donation\ntotal my dad said you broke my brain\nreckful broke I think that's what he\nmeant ready yeah so that he broke my\nbrain I mean if you just think about it\nlike even-even and you can try this that\nyou can take experiences that you\nnormally so my the example that I use is\nlike also I take like this very bitter\nlike Indian herb so I don't know if you\nguys have ever heard of neem yeah but\nneem is is a particular plant and it's\nlike super super bitter you just eat a\nneem leaf it's an awful experience until\nyou do it fully mindfully and then if\nyou do it fully mindfully like it's\nactually not that bad it's just super\nit's like the most bitter thing you've\never tasted but bitterness in and of\nitself is not necessarily bad right okay\nso on psilocybin you'll do everything\nyou could do everything very mindfully\nand you'll just taste something to be\nlike oh actually why why is it that I\nnever enjoy this exactly you'll you'll\ndrink you'll drink it and you'll think\noh yeah yeah exactly exactly so you so I\nthink psilocybin creates separation\nbetween the mind and the self yes right\nand and so that people find to be\npeaceful and blissful and enlightening\nso like not only do you gain more\nknowledge but you gain peace and you\ngain some degree of enjoyment mm-hmm and\nand so that's also like I've always\nthought it's weird that like moksha\nwhich is the word for enlightenment like\ngets translated as different things it\ngets a little translated as bliss it\ngets translated as liberation or freedom\nand it gets translated as enlightenment\nand so one is like huh Nirvana is\nNirvana moksha same thing yeah it's also\na Nirvana right yeah\nyeah and so it's just weird that like\none word has like you know if you think\nabout it like freedom and happiness or\nlike two different dimensions of things\nright it's not like the same category\nbut in this state of mind if you've done\npsilocybin like you kind of know what I\nmean that like there's sort of bliss and\nthere's like you know more things and\nyou feel better and knowing and feeling\ncan kind of like there's a state of mind\nwhere knowing and feeling can like Co it\nlike peace and knowledge sort of come\nhand-in-hand which is not usually how we\nthink about peace and knowledge I know\nwhat you're talking about yeah yeah so\nas to my personal take on on meditation\nversus psilocybin so I think that\npsilocybin\nis has less research to support it so\ngenerally speaking when people meditate\nregularly for a long period of time it\ndoes a lot of things to your brain yeah\nand I think that those things are\nprobably more reliable based on my\nexperience of hearing people talk about\npsilocybin then then yeah but you need\nto have the experience too okay so I\nthink it's probably very similar I don't\nknow I agree with you though there's\nthousands of years of people have been\nmeditating for thousands of years so and\npassing down the knowledge right so I'll\ngive you so I'll give you a prime\nexample of why I think meditation is\nprobably better than psilocybin so the\nstate is the same so I think once you\nachieve is the same is the same or\narguably people say that in meditation\nyou can get two states higher than\npsilocybin although you know unclear\nwhat that means but the one thing that\nyou don't get from psilocybin is a\npractice at concentration and the focus\nof your mind so I don't think that's so\nthat's not true\nI got to stop you there okay you do get\npractice in concentration and focus of\nyour mind because house has you stepping\nback and realizing all the time that you\naren't being mindful constantly you're\njust like you're it makes you present no\nso I get the making you present okay god\nyou're getting I need you to try it I\nneed you to try it that's why yeah\nyou'll do it okay so we can go to\ntwitchcon is in Amsterdam and we could\nyou could borrow the car saying I'm\ngonna do psilocybin I'm saying\nokay please stay we can we can legally\npurchase it it's truffles\nover-the-counter and Amsterdam okay we\ncould we can in a twitchcon and I'll\nhang out with you we'll talk\nit'll be great we could stream I don't\nknow if I can stream it off to a switch\nif they think it's okay but that'd be\ncool so some people are saying this\ncan't be real\ntell me more about tell me more about\nwhy you think that you train your\nconcentration through psilocybin okay um\nso okay so after I take so Simon here's\nmy experience I will wake up feeling\nI'll wake up feeling a bit empty every\nday a little bit I wake up with low not\nnot too much motivation and all those\ntrying to really put myself there I\nguess I have time to think about it okay\nand I'll take it and then after it hits\nI take it every single day so I'm on it\nright now\nalways on it it's not a big dose it's\nnot I don't get high I take a 1 gram\nwhich people get high on like 3.5\nusually and I probably built the\ntolerance um once I'm on it then I'm\nable to do the tasks that I usually\nwould find impossible to do I wasn't\nalways able to do them it also took me\nchanging my mindset so now I'm able to\nclean or do laundry or organize my room\nor plan ahead in ways that were hard for\nme before ok and just just like I told\nyou my friend Greek took psilocybin and\ndecided to lose 200 pound or decided you\nwant to lose weight and lost hundred\npounds or you heard that elsewhere I\ndidn't even tell you then I'm able to\nthink oh if I do this if I clean my if I\norganize my room it will everything will\njust feel better in the future I'm not\nthinking moment to moment I'm able to\nzoom out and also yeah and I think yeah\nI'm able to also think I'm also hired\nI'm not I'm not quite getting it the\nexplanation there I can't do it so it's\nreally hard to explain yeah go ahead\nso so let me let me try to tell you what\nI'm hearing and how I'm interpreting\nthat which could be wrong because I have\na tried solicitor so I think what you're\ntalking about is the after-effects of\nsomething called Samadhi\nso Samadhi is a state of temporary\nenlightenment and when people have\nSamadhi they change and their outlook\nchanges which means their behavior\nchanges and what they can accomplish\nchanges it's like a moment of\nrealization that changes the way that\nyou move through the world so like with\nmy patient who was on ibogaine they had\nan experience where they saw like the\naddiction within them is like this\nserpent that was like coiling around\ninside them and like eating different\nparts of them and like they took that\nserpent out and they like they like shed\nit and it wriggled and it fell off of\nthem and then they formed like felt like\nand then like there\nit changed the way that they interacted\nwith substances in the future from that\nsingle moment in time is that what\nyou're describing like their behaviors\nchange and they're the product of their\nmind in terms of what it decides to do\nand doesn't do changes from this\nsingular experience there's so much more\nto it than that okay could be because\nthat singular experience gives hope the\nsingular experience makes you realize\nyou can be happy because when you're sad\nyou think it's impossible you can't see\na reality where you would be happy I\nwould feel doesn't matter what I do I've\ntried traveling I've tried streaming\nI've had a lot of fans you know I've got\na lot of money I've I've tried to live\nin a nice place and no matter what I do\nit doesn't feel good I can't feel\nhappiness I've had a girlfriend who I\nreally felt close to and loved and we\nwere traveling together in Japan which\nis my favorite place to be and I still\nwasn't happy and now if I take\npsilocybin all those same experiences\nbecome meaningful and I feel like I'm a\nfull whole human being I feel like there\nwas something missing in my my brain and\nit connects it and it makes it work and\nit makes me feel these feelings that\nother people must be experiencing okay\nso that's very useful to hear I think\nthat that's a broader conversation so\nthat concerns me because in order to\nengage in life it sounds like you need\npsilocybin so that just bothers me right\nso my hope is that there is a way for\nyou to engage in life without psilocybin\nto have those fulfilling experiences\nwithout it right that would be great\nthat's a value judgment that I place but\nlet me just would be great but I don't\nmind then some people are like oh I want\nto feel reliant on any substance or\nsomething yeah so but I mean I'm also\nreliant on eating food every day I will\ndie if I don't do that so eating one\nextra food every day a mushroom\nI don't yes I don't want to go down that\nroad right now what I want to focus on\nis what I was saying about training your\nconcentration so this is something that\nI'm not sure that psilocybin doesn't\nmaking fun of my logic that logic\ndoesn't work\ncome no let's forget about forget about\nthe logic please everyone's calling me a\ndrug addict can we address that dog that\nthey're all calling me a drug addict I\nfeel like it should be addressed I mean\nwe can I think it's gonna take more time\nand energy than I have the inclination\nfor right now okay um do you think I'm a\ndrug addict what does that mean what do\nyou mean by the word addict that I'm\ndoing something over and over that will\nhave an effect on me long-term I think\nwhat you're doing is not healthy I'll\nput it that way okay so I don't know\nwhat effects so like scientifically we\ndon't know know what the chronic effects\nof psilocybin use are right we just\ndon't know and we all have different it\nmy legend you don't think it's not\nhealthy you don't know because they\ndon't know yeah so I think what you're\ndoing is not healthy I don't know if\nwhat you're doing will have oh there's\ndifficulty no no no but you don't know\nif it's not exactly so I think what\nyou're doing is unhealthy for a whole\nhost of reasons but that doesn't\nnecessarily have to do with you being\ndependent on a substance because\ngenerally speaking psilocybin is not a\nsubstance that you form a physiologic\ndependence to right so like when we\nthink about addiction we think about\nsomeone whose determinant developed a\nphysiologic tolerance to a substance so\nI'm addicted to caffeine because if I\ndon't have caffeine I have withdrawal\nright drink caffeine I don't drink\nalcohol so the other problem with this\nthis conversation the reason that I'm\nhesitant to engage in it is because it's\nnot about logic right there there's way\nmore here than logic there's there's\nvalues there's judgments\nthere's perception yeah there's sense\nI'd like to explore all those but for\nall of those yeah\nnext week because that's a long\nconversation what I want is zeroing on\njust because and maybe no one else gives\na [ __ ] about this but I feel like it's\nimportant because you have people ask\nquestions about the difference between\nmeditation in psilocybin okay so the\nmeditation offers lots of benefits and\nit's not just the state of Samadhi so\nthe state of Samadhi is I think what\npsilocybin gives you which is sort of\nlike a state of self outside of the mind\nwhich gives you a sense of peace and\nrealization fine arguably meditation\nleads to other kinds of benefits right\nso they're like spiritual powers which\npeople claim that you can gain through\nmeditation I won't comment on those\ntoday although people are super\ninterested about that we can have a we\ncan talk about that I don't know if\npsilocybin lets you do those things the\nthe thing that I will be very concrete\nabout is that there is a particular\npractice of meditation the first stage\nof meditation is dhaarana which is not\nactually a state of mind it's a practice\nso when I sit down and I say focus on\nyour breath and my mind starts to wander\nand I train my mind to come back to the\nbreath and it wanders again and I\ntrained it to come back and it wanders\nagain and I train it to come back every\ntime my mind wanders it's like doing a\nmental pushup to focus my attention back\non the thing you're getting better at\nfocusing your attention I agree and it's\nso it's like basically like going to the\ngym for your mind because you're going\nthrough a particular redirection of\nattention time and time and time again\nand what that means is that when I\nintend my mind to go in a particular\ndirection I get better at training the\nmind to follow my commands yes so I was\narguing that I do the same thing on\npsilocybin because I start my day and\nI'll train my mind - okay here's\nallocate my time in a certain way I need\nto here I need to work on Everland for\ntwo hours right now I need I've never\nbeen able to like you know schedule\nthings or because because I started\ndoing it I'm able to schedule things all\nthe time so I mean I can have every\nsystem because here's the not on\npsilocybin are you still better at that\nstuff\nyes it's lat having some lasting effects\nwhen I'm not on it\nso I am still a little better but no I\ndon't I can't like clean my room or\norganize things or stick be a super\npunctual but when I'm on it I can be\nreally punctual yes for this meeting\nthen we were you were right yeah you\nwere absolutely yeah and so I think that\nthat's so that I don't know I mean cuz\nit's kind of like you're saying like I\ncan function on caffeine right but I\ncan't function so more it's a very\nsimilar effect of caffeine actually yeah\nso but that implies to me so that's not\nhow meditation works though because\nmeditation like no but right so it's\ngiving me the caffeine feeling of I can\nfunction but it's also giving me the\nperspective feeling the step back\nfeeling that I can direct my attention\nfeeling maybe you can also direct your\nattention on caffeine better yeah\nprobably\nlet me put it this way there is some you\ndon't think I'm doing the mental\npush-ups\nI don't push ups that's IIIi I'm trying\nto figure out if I am yes yeah so I do I\nwant you to try it maybe you'll know I\ndon't know yeah and if you're doing the\nmental push-ups that'll help advance\npeople's knowledge of the connection or\nthe similarities between suicide and\nmeditation just by you trying it once I\ncan figure it out\nyeah so we also need to have a\nconversation of why it's so important\nfor you that I try psilocybin right so\nlike what does that mean to you because\nlike I'm getting these a lot I can see\nthat right so yeah yeah yeah and why\nit's so important to you and I because I\nwant I want to know if I'm going on the\ncorrect life path by trying this\neveryday\nbasically yeah right now you're in a\ndisagreement that I am okay and then the\nthe FDA approval is leaning towards\nmaybe this will be a yeah right but you\nthink I'm doing something on a healthy I\nwant base I think if you try it but\ndidn't we just have a notion about how\nthings like make us the people that we\nare and that things that may be\nperceived as negative yes we did so I\nthink that you're on the wrong path you\nasked me a question and I'm not talking\nto you about psilocybin I want to know\nyeah I want to know I wanted you're the\none who's asking me do you do I think\nit's unhealthy you're the one who wants\nme to try it's alright I value your\nopinion I value your opinion so much on\nthis topic and the only way I can really\nget your opinion is if you try okay so I\nthink we should have two conversations\nnow one is about why it's so important\nto you that I tried psilocybin and the\nsecond what's we're having or no in the\nsecond is you know this whole issue of\nwhether you're an addict or not and if\nyou want to talk about that those may be\nrelated okay\nbut anyway I think yeah I mean I think\nthose are both full conversations I'm\nmore than happy to have I'm I'm thrilled\nthat you're very interested in it and\nI'd love to have those conversations and\nit sounds like we've got more stuff to\ntalk about I just kind of have to wrap\nup in a little bit and I was gonna see\nhow that makes sense yeah it's been\nthrough hours people want to have\nquestions do you do people have\nquestions let me just look real quick\nlet's uh let's answer to a question\neverything yeah I can look at some\nquestions too anyone have any questions\nI'll read them in here fastest four\nhours of your life yeah sorry okay guys\ncan you\nbe fun of me for trying to get a\npsychiatrist to take drugs please I'm\nsorry I don't I'm not offended and I\ndon't think it's an appropriate thing if\npeople want to make fun like you know\ntwitch chat is twitch chats they're\ngonna make fun of what they want to make\nfun of I know it's kind of funny it's\npretty funny\nI think it's actually a really important\nconversation but I do think twitch chat\nis picking up on something that there's\nalmost there's a very amused this word\nbut it feels right there's some\ndesperation within you for me to try\npsilocybin like that's what it feels\nlike\nlike I feel yes because as soon as you\ndo I I and I don't want to be too pushy\nwhich I being them too pushy for sure\nbut I know that as soon as you try it\nyou'll be able to tell me if I am doing\nthese mental push-ups if you tell me I\nam doing the mental push-ups I'll feel\nbetter every single day so here's the\nproblem that I like this in in two\nseconds reckful you need to stop living\nyour life based on my validation you\nhave to decide for yourself right that's\nthe fundamental problem so I've already\ndecided for myself I want to do it I\ndon't think you have then then the\nreason I'm here outside for other\nopinion because you see addict to do the\nsame thing I'm doing\nI'd like some actual heroin addict would\ndo what I'm doing and decide for himself\nexactly so there's a part of your\nopinion there is a part of you that has\ndoubt and you were looking for me to\nsettle that doubt I'm not gonna play\nthat yes\nno I didn't present this right so it\ndoesn't mean that we can't talk about it\nagain but my initial reaction is that\nyou're looking for a green light from me\nwhich the problem with that is not\nwhether I give you a green light or the\nred light the problem that I have with\nthat is that like reckful you need to\nstop looking to me for green lights this\nis a decision like you have to come to\non your own huh I kind of like looking\nat you for green I know and I'm gonna\ngive you the green lights that I'm ready\nto give you but for the rest of it let's\ntalk about it later\nlet's do Q&A okay dodj sure Q&A I'm\ngonna stealth and disappear\nI'm getting him to try it by the way\nyou'll see which gun so I have a few\nquestions here that I can ask so\n[Music]\nlet me just see if these are for\nI really think some don't don't worry\nabout it reckful seriously I think you\nso I think twitch chat is on to\nsomething and we're gonna explore that\nin our next interview because next week\nyeah I think we should talk about it but\nit's not I don't think we do Sundays\nfrom now on yeah we can let me try can\nwe do can we talk about that do Sunday's\nyeah if you can't do Sunday's I'll do\nFriday's it's no I I think I should be\nable to do something okay it's just\ngonna have to be not this time right oh\nwait do you guys like Friday's shot you\nguys really like Friday's I guess that's\na good QA what day do you guys like the\nbest for this oh they love Fridays okay\nwell do Fridays if he's what Friday\nlater in the day work better for you\nknow this was great timing okay so some\nwhat we kind of talked about this a\nlittle bit how are you not crying after\nreckful read that so people are\nwondering if I'm because they were\nnoticing I was smiling and I was\nsadistic here yeah so reckful I'll kind\nof ask again I know we kind of talked\nabout it but what are you person like\nhow does it feel to you when I smile you\nknow what we're talking like how does\nthat feel to you well the way I answer\nit last time was I thought that when\nyou're smiling it means that something\nclicked in your brain that you realized\nyou're gonna be able to help me but you\nsaid that what you when you were smiling\nyou feel hope for me yeah did I see a\nlecture you feel hope for me do you\nlet's hope for me now nothing I'm a drug\naddict I think it's all it's all part of\nit so reckful it's all part of your road\nman it's all part of your yeah right\nokay I mean it's it you know I I do my\nbest not to judge and like this whole\nlike addict or not I yeah so I think\nsometimes I do like click right so\nsometimes it's kind of an intellectual\nlike it's like right before I like it's\nlike AG Adam like it's right before yeah\nand so sometimes it is that sort of like\nintellectual things clicking into place\nbut a lot of times it's just hope and\nit's kind of bizarre cuz like I\nsometimes I used to get bothered by it\nwhen like people would come into my\noffice and they'd like start crying and\nstuff and I'd be sitting there grinning\nlike an idiot and then I've asked them\nhow does it feel to you that I'm\ngrinning like an idiot while you're\ncrying and they're like it actually\nfeels really good okay and so their sake\nI could see it could be interpreted the\nwrong way but most people who know you\nwould not interpret throw away yeah so I\nhave a question for you that you can ask\nyour your uh your base and your own time\nas well I uh so I was gonna surprise you\nbut I think it's actually better if you\nend up telling me and talking about it\nI'm gonna put you in Everland\nokay you're gonna be in the game cool\nand you can have your own building or\nyou could be meditating on a mountain I\nwhatever you prefer and if you have a\nbuilding what would it be what would you\nwant it to be and you could talk you\ncould talk to your chat about it and\nthey can help you decide in another time\nokay so I feel like I already have an\nanswer for you\nokay what is it and it's and if this is\na cop-out I'm gonna ask chat because I\nfeel like I don't think this is a\ncop-out but I think I think it should be\nwhatever you think it should be I won't\nokay I want that I want you to build it\nso like whatever you whatever inspired\nme to put you into the game like put me\ninto the game in the image that you feel\nis appropriate okay great I got it okay\nyeah great thank you nice so I have a\nquestion here is it okay to meditate\nafter smoking weed\nso marijuana I think is a whole\ndifferent ballgame so marijuana I'm not\na big fan of I'm not either\nI marijuana also has a lot of good\ntreatment uses so for example like the\nbest evidence for marijuana I have some\nlegend coma right\nnot just glaucoma so like the most\nimportant clinical benefit that I've\nseen from marijuana is people who have\nopiate addiction and start using\nmarijuana reduce their dependency on\nopiates okay and so like from a public\nhealth standpoint like people are dying\nlike I said they think 76 people every\nhour died from opiate overdose or 176 or\nsomething like that and so any any\nsubstance that causes people to use less\nopiates I think there's there's room for\nI have some patients that have\ndepression and use marijuana from time\nto time it's kind of funny because they\nlike they you know they come here and we\ndo like meditation and all that kind of\nstuff and then one day like months after\nwe've worked together like by the way I\nsmoke pot from time to time it really\nhelps me feel better and yeah then I ask\nokay how much do you smoke and I'm like\nokay like what you know you're gonna\nlive your life I think you can get the\ndownsides of it or it's difficult to\nhave motivation yes so yeah this is the\nreal problem with with marijuana is that\nmarijuana is a cannabinoid and a lot of\nthe receptors around behavior and habit\nI have to do with cannabinoids and this\ngets like super complicated but\nbasically when we look at and so I think\nthe real problem with chronic marijuana\nuse is that it it destroys your\nmotivational circuitry and so like if\nyou have trouble finding a job or you\nhave trouble studying or things like\nthat by destroys it's unclear how much\ndamage it does and what that what that\nlooks like but it really hampers\npeople's abilities to have an intention\nand follow-through with that intention\nfor productivity I've seen that\nfirsthand a lot of my friends and so the\npeople make counter arguments right\nbecause they say like oh you have like\nso I I have someone you know I work with\nsomeone who I'm sure this is not going\nto be identifying but I've worked with\npeople that like major places like\nGoldman Sachs and Google who use\nmarijuana on a daily basis and the\ncounter-argument is but there are super\nsuccessful people who were\nthese institutions in use marijuana on a\ndaily basis and I say yes that's correct\nthat's true at the same time I think is\na clinician and you have to is a\nclinician you play the odds right so the\nquestion is it might take a hundred\npeople and I give them marijuana and I\ntake a hundred people and I don't give a\nmarijuana\nwhat are the likelihoods that they'll\nend up in certain places I would bet\nanything that they'd be more of them\nwould be less motivated and that's what\nwe see so there's data to suggest that\nright which doesn't mean that an\nindividual it doesn't like and this is a\nbig problem is for a long time people\nthought that marijuana affected IQ they\nlike kills brain cells or whatever I've\nnever seen a situation where I think it\naffects like raw IQ I think what effects\nis executive function which is like your\nfrontal lobes which is like being able\nto plan and execute complicated tasks\nand it affects motivation it engenders\nsort of habitual circuitry in your brain\nso when we and I know that I said this\nis complicated but I'm gonna go into it\nbecause I can't help myself\nso when we first start to do an action\nand that action feels good that is\nmediated by dopamine in something called\nthe meze olympic circuit so early on\nactions like when I wake up and I have\nmy first cup of coffee ever in life or\nlet's not use copy let's use alcohol for\nexample and maybe this is a bad example\nbecause alcohol does things to your\nbrain so forget about the effects of\nalcohol in the brain actually let's use\nvideo games video games so when I first\nplay a video game and I say like oh this\nis lots of fun that's dopamine acting in\nmy mind in my brain okay so dopamine\nreinforces a behavior the experience of\npleasure but what happens when people\nbecome addicted to games as they play\nthe game for like 10 hours a day and if\nyou ask them an hour 7 are you actually\nhaving fun they say no like they don't\nremember yesterday where they played 14\nhours of Diablo as being like one of the\nbest days of their life but I do\nremember like land parties where I still\nremember like the land party where I\nplay left 4 dead and it was like a\nlast man like I remember that it was so\nmuch fun I was with my friends we were\ntrying to survive from zombies it was\nlike a blast\nI remember specific gaming experiences\nof my life because they release dopamine\nover time a games on a couch feels with\nfriends is so fun and I ever lay maybe I\nwant to make some sort of my lead artist\nFrank is really passionate about this to\nmake some sort of game that gets people\nto do couch co-op's again cool because\nyeah I hang out to friends but so so at\nthe beginning of a behavior it gets\nreinforced by dopamine over time that\nneurotransmitter changes and it becomes\na cannabinoid so endocannabinoids have\nto do with actions related to habit\nformation so once something becomes\nhabitual you don't enjoy it anymore but\nyou do it anyway right so if we think\nabout like a behavior everyone thinks\nthat behaviors are reinforced by\ndopamine and pleasure circuitry because\nby now gamers are pretty smart and\nthey're into neuroscience and they're\ninto drugs of you know so like the study\nabout the brain and the reading about\nthe brain everyone knows about dopamine\nwhat people don't know is that if you\nthink about a bit habit so if you think\nabout a habit like you don't enjoy the\nthings that you do habitually and the\nreason for this why gaming's become less\nfun yes because what happens is it\nstarts to engender\nthe the neurotransmitters involves or\ncannabinoids which have to do with\nhabits and no longer have to do enjoy\nwith enjoyment so I think when you flood\nyour brain with cannabinoids now this is\nmy theory we don't really know so we\nknow that that marijuana reduces\nmotivation we know that marijuana is a\ncannabinoid we know that there are some\ncircuits of the brain and I'm gonna have\nto brush up on this and get back to you\nguys because I'm a little bit rusty so\ntake this take what I say with a grain\nof salt and we know that so we know the\nneurotransmitters of cannabinoids and we\nknow that marijuana reduces motivation\nso my hypothesis is that since you're\nflooding your brain with cannabinoids\nyou're reinforcing a habit cycle around\nwhatever the marijuana behavior is which\ngenerally speaking is not productive and\nso my sense is that like cannabinoids\nare not good because alright it's not\neverything everything in medicine and\neverything is what in your body has like\na benefit\nrisk analysis well in this situation\ngood for you you want people to be\nmotivated in whatever if someone wanted\nto just you know chill yes forever yes\nand that would be good for that yes yeah\nI I be but I don't think yeah I mean I\ndon't think that would be good for them\nbecause I think what they would be doing\nis chilling and now this gets back to\nthe question should I use marijuana\nbefore I meditate so let's think about\nwhy someone would want to use marijuana\nbefore they meditate chances are the\nreason that marijuana before meditation\nmakes meditation way more productive\nwhich it does for many of the people\nthat I've taught is that it quiets your\nmind for you right so then what happens\nis when you sit down to meditate you\nfeel like you have a more productive\nmeditation session because the marijuana\nis reducing the activity of your mind\nbut if we think about it part of the\nbenefit of meditation is being able to\nwrestle with your mind in its current\nstate so it's basically like what\nmarijuana does is it's like if you go to\nthe gym and you're trying to train your\nattention and concentration and your\nability to follow through and I talked\nabout this last Sunday I are not last\nSunday but the last sunday stream I did\nwas all about tadhana\nand tadhana is basically like why I\nthink people struggle to accomplish\ntheir goals and it's it's not what's hot\nona means is focus and just as an\nexample so if I wake up on January first\n2020 and I say I have a new year's\nresolution and I'm gonna lose a hundred\npounds and if you stop and you look at\nthe mind in that moment their resolve is\na hundred percent it's not like\nhalf-assed it's a hundred percent right\ntheir passion for their goal is like\ncomplete and pure and wonderful what\nthey're lacking is concentration of the\nmind its focus because the next day then\nthe mind is a hundred percent towards\nworking out and the next day you're no\nlonger pointing in that direction you're\npointing in this direction so I think\nwhat people think of is a lack of\nwillpower is not actually willpower it's\nnot the ability to overcome willpower is\nthe ability to like overcome your\ninternal impulses I think it's actually\na lack of focus so a human that the\naverage person does not get to choose\nwhat direction their mind points so you\ngot\nabout your mind as a flower with you\nthere and so on January 1st rain the\nrain the ability to focus it with\nmeditation yes so on January 1st my\nflashlight is pointing towards weight\nloss and on January 2nd I move my\nflashlight to pictures of cats on\nYouTube and the pattern uh is the\npractice of training your mind to put\nthe flashlight where you want and so if\nwe think about meditation why do people\nwant to use marijuana with meditation\nit's because it it's less trouble to\nfocus your flashlight which in turn\nmakes it easier to get to states of\nSamadhi and people think about\nproductive meditation as states of\nSamadhi right which is like the no mind\nstate or whatever so people think like\nmarijuana assists their meditation in a\nsense it does because it is easier to\nfacilitate that but I think what you're\ndoing is you're missing out because\nyou're going to the gym and instead of\nlike lifting a 50-pound weight you're\ntaking all the weight off and you're\nmaking it easy for you to do Carl's got\nyeah so I don't think marijuana is is\ngood to use in terms of an assistive aid\nfor meditation but I fully understand\nwhy people do it because people don't\nunderstand that you know meditation is a\nlot of different stuff and it's not just\ngetting to the state of no-mind and\nblissed-out that that's not all that\nmeditation is for there are a lot of\nother benefits of meditation yeah\nanother thing marijuana also helps you\nfall asleep but I think it's the same\nthing it's just you can use the same\nanalogy it's you're getting worse sleep\nwhen you you sleep after we die don't\nthink you get to REM as often i watch\nthe Matthew Walker and some sleep expert\ntalk about it and it's it when you're\ntrying to sleep from wheat with weed\nkind of feel like it's very difficult\nfor a talker when trying to sleep with\nweed it's also like you're taking all\nthe weights off at the gym and just\nfalling asleep but yeah you're not\ngetting good sleep you like my mind's a\nlittle exhausted yeah - - so I'm gonna\ndo - yeah questions yeah I have a before\nanyone forgets uh-uh\nyou guys should follow him yeah so he's\nhe\nthat healthy gamer GG it's here I\nactually think you should rebrand this a\nlittle and have like a picture of\nyourself somewhere yeah at least people\nhave told me that maybe maybe your name\nyeah I'll talk about it with you but I\nthink maybe your name because you\nalready have healthy gamer GG once and\nnow it's twice I think maybe your name\nwould be better like dr. kono ji all\nright okay sure\nhow do you pronounce your last name Cano\nGia Cano Gia\nyeah okay and yeah what else so I'll\nlink it in the chat here and that's and\nalso follow him on Twitch is here okay\nboom boom oh I hurt myself I don't like\nthat cuz I opened his twitch stream and\nthen I assume most of you already follow\nme yeah so you guys should follow\nreckful I mean everyone knows who you\nare maybe his fans don't so yeah if you\nguys are interested I mean dude half of\nmy rep not in half 80% of my fans came\nfrom you how do I link to you boomer you\nyeah you're trying to forget the link to\nme yeah my mods are and figured it out\nokay\nyeah so you guys should reckful is\nawesome so I'm actually a fan of\nbreakfast I use it so if you wanted to\ntype in a URL to get to my channel could\nyou do it yes okay okay just making sure\n[Laughter]\nTV slash reckful right yeah you got it\nyeah but I I know how to find I just I\ndidn't know what your actual name on on\ntwitch was right cuz like a lot yeah\nlike cuz I know your reckful cuz I mean\nI remember watching your PvP videos from\na decade ago which by the way or still\ntaken down from YouTube I know I saw I\nlooked at your YouTube channel yeah\nthat's all I told I told so I was on it\nwasn't on my channel the video you've\nseen I guess reckful 3 is probably the\none you saw is 5 million views yeah\nyes it wasn't on my own channel it was\non a small channel with like 20k subs\ncalled complexity gaming it's my sponsor\nat the time but they apparently got\ndude for some intro they used some\nsounds of something on there so and it\nwas cool dealing with yeah it'll be back\nup something can we just do two or three\nmore questions yes you do it okay so\npeople are saying that why do yo keys\nand India smoke cannabis regularly and\nreligiously so this is a great question\nso not all Yogi's in fact I'd say the a\nvery small minority of Yogi's use\ncannabis and it is used as part of their\nspiritual practice so the Yogi's who use\ncannabis are part of a kind of tradition\ncalled aghori sadhana Gor means fear ah\nGor means without fear so they do things\nthey live what they basically do so this\nis actually a great question because we\nwere talking earlier about how that\nexperience is just an experience and it\nisn't like good or bad and good or bad\nis what we attribute to it so the goal\nof their sadhana is to do practices that\nnormally engender fear and to do them\nwith tranquility so the the the Gauri\nBaba's who are also apparently really\ngood at giving boons and cursing people\nso they do use marijuana sometimes\nthey're like Himalayan Yogi's that use\nmarijuana as well but I think most of\nthe pictures that people see are often\ntimes of naked Yogi's who are covered in\nash and are smoking pot and are unclean\nso these people live in cemeteries they\ncoat themselves with the ash from\ncremated bodies and they also do things\nlike eat meat drink alcohol and\nsometimes practise cannibalism so like\nthere in the reason that they engage in\nall of these things is to like do these\npractices with like complete tranquility\nof mind and it's kind of like stepping\nand auction so stepping in dog [ __ ] is\nmy like version of a gory sadhana the\nother thing about a gory sadhana is it\nis recommended by a guru for a\nparticular period of time so you don't\nyou're you're not a Nagori you don't\nbecome an Agora sod that and I could be\nwrong about this just based on my\nexploration let's do it for a small\namount of time yeah not a small amount\nI'm usually a decade so they're they're\nlike lifelong Oh\nso they like they'll spend 23 years\ndoing like regular practice right at the\nage of 40 they go and they live in a\ncemetery for about a decade and smoke a\nbunch of pot and then they come back and\nthen they give up on again okay yeah\njust NBD ten years of eating people so I\nI don't think that generally speaking\nYogi's use Janice which is marijuana\nregularly okay so if I if I wanted to\nwatch you step in dog [ __ ] you'd say yes\nsure that'll do okay awesome adoption is\nthat something people are interested in\nseeing no yeah where do you where do you\ndraw the line so you won't eat people I\nassume that's correct yeah\nwhat would you do that they do I mean I\ndrink alcohol and I eat meat but I don't\nI don't do it as part of my sadhna I\njust do it because I you know enjoy it\nfrom time to time so I'm not interested\nin doing it gory sadhana that's not my\npath my path I decided I would go for\ntea sad that I was something ever\nhappened to my wife and kids and like\nall of my material attachments were gone\nI'd probably I'll become a monk again\nand their Gauri is not gonna maybe a\npart of that but see but yeah can I do\none more question reckful this one's\nkind of about you know of course I'm\nenjoying this listening do you think\nreckful is looking for an easy way out\nof his depression if so do you think\nthat his approach to his depression\nultimately leading to the route if so do\nyou think that is his approach to his\ndepression ultimately leading to the\nroute of his depression I understand\nokay\nso I think the question is do you think\nreckful is looking for an easy way out\nof his depression and do you think that\nlooking for an easy way out of your\ndepression is the root of why you're\ndepressed that's what I think the\nquestion is I hope it's a no what do you\nthink do you think you're looking for an\neasy solution to your depression I was\nlooking for any solution so that part\nhe's right but it's not the reason I'm\ndepressed I was depressed to start with\nyou\nso I don't think that you're looking for\nan easy solution in fact even though\nthis solution feels good and remember\nboys and girls were not treating or\ndiagnosing any medical illness I think\nthat what you're doing would you\ndescribe this as easy no I mean I've\n[ __ ] cry my eyes out yeah so I think\nlike people need to remember that right\nlike so what reckful is doing requires\njust gigantic\nballs of steel like it's not easy I have\nreally big balls yeah are they made of\nsteel blows the question I hope so I'll\nhave to pound hate them in a non-medical\nway when we meet an instrument we're\njust gonna kill him right now but okay\nso what here's what I think is going on\nwith ruffle I don't think that there's\nan easy solution to his depression and I\nthink that what he's doing is hard not\njust because he's doing it publicly\ndoing it publicly sure is hard but I\nthink the really hard thing and what is\nreally amazing and what I respect and\nwhy I'm invested in continuing to work\nwith you is because you're grappling\nwith the things that are difficult to\ngrapple with right like you're zoning in\nto the raid and you know that there's\nlike a gigantic raid boss on the other\nside and you're zoning in and I don't\nthink that like yeah I've always wanted\nto be challenged in that way yeah and\nwhen I play games I try to do the\nhardest thing in the game and I try to\nbeat it right and I think so I'll try to\ndo that with my own life absolutely and\nso I think that what you're trying to do\nis not easy in fact it's hard it's very\nhard so grappling with like the dark\nparts of ourself grappling with that\ninner thing that you know is painful and\ndifficult because it's safe right like\nit's it's safe to actually just continue\nto be depressed and you psilocybin and\nkind of like hang out and but but\nactually like dealing with your feelings\nand facing your feelings and talking\nabout your loss and also like talking\nabout their they're like undertones of\nstuff that we haven't even explicitly\ntalked about which is like what is the\nconversation that you're gonna have with\nyour family because that's gonna have to\nhappen at some point yeah my one\ndisagreement with what you said is it's\nsafe to continue just being depressed\nand yeah\nyou hadda doing psilocybin to the list\nyeah there's this feeling where you can\njust stay in bed over and over day after\nday and just watch a show and only get\nup to pee and just do it or we'll just\nwatch twit should just do it\nmmm a month in a row you know and you\njust like can't get out of this you just\ndo it over and over but I disagree that\nit's you can't you can't it's not\npossible to do suicide but in that\nsituation and then not get yourself out\nof it\ncool from my experience for me it\nwouldn't it be possible it's not the\nsame for everyone\nyeah for Greek it wouldn't be possible\neither and for any of my other friends\nwe've tried it it's now like 20 or so\npeople so 20 years money would not be\npossible to just stay in bed and be\ndepressed okay cool that's Mike yeah so\nI don't think it's an easy you need a\nclinical trial of a couple thousand\npeople would be great I mean and I don't\nthink that his depression is ultimately\ndue to you know him trying to look for\neasy outs for his depression I don't\nthink so at all I mean I don't even know\nthat what we're talking about is even\ntruly been depression because anyway but\nI think you've definitely got a some\nscar so you have some kind of a lot of\npent up emotions around you know the\nloss of your brother and and the zombie\non the inside and stuff like that so\nanyway okay so let's meditate and then\nwe'll wrap up for the day you said I\nshouldn't meditate when I'm sick yeah so\nyou can meditate I'm gonna try to do a\nmeditation that has no breathing though\nso it's not a breath oriented meditation\nokay or at least let me think about that\nhow can I do a non breathing meditation\nwhat am I gonna do okay we're gonna do\nthat we did this one a couple weeks ago\nwhat we're gonna do this one again it's\ngonna be a sound meditation yeah yep\noh the third eye let's do third eye\nmeditation great that one's even better\nwe're gonna charge our laser beams okay\nso I want you guys yeah let's do third\neye meditation okay so I want everyone\nto sit up straight so your back should\nbe sorry here we go chat we're doing it\nyou guys do it too okay sit up straight\nso I want you to just take a so I'm\ngonna ask people to close their eyes and\nthen I'm gonna ask them to open them\nafter a few breaths and then I'm gonna\nask you guys to watch what I do\nactually let me think about how am I\ngonna do this okay I'm gonna teach you\nguys the third eye thing first and then\nbut don't do it now I'll tell you guys\nwant to do it so I want you to take your\ncan I get banned for using my middle\nfinger on Twitch you know not if I do\nthis right can I do this you got some\nsupportive finger there that it's giving\nso normally I mean you guys at home\ndon't have to use these two fingers\nbecause this is the middle one is the\noperative one so the main thing is that\nthe middle one is out and what I want\nyou middle there needs to be up yeah so\nthere's a spot that's like just right\nabove your eyebrows and in the middle of\nyour forehead and I want you to just\nhover don't touch no touching hover\nhover your finger you're wiped just just\nlike a centimeter away from your\nforehead so just that spot but don't\ntouch\nyeah so you guys just find that spot\nokay a little bit hot little bit higher\nreckful a little bit higher yeah a\nlittle bit lower me you see from the Sun\nyeah I can see from the front okay so I\nwant you guys to just train yourself to\ndo that okay but you don't want to touch\nnow put your hand down so now what we're\ngonna do put your hand down now what\nwe're gonna do I want you guys to just\nremember that because I'm gonna ask you\nto put your finger over your third eye\nin a second we're gonna do some deep\nrelaxing breathing first and then we're\ngoing to do the the third eye thing and\nthen so what I mean by that is like so\nput your finger over your third eye so\nI'll ask you to do that and then we're\ngoing to stop the\nso I'm gonna ring the bell to signal the\nstart of the practice and ring the bell\nto signal the end of the practice and at\nthe end of the practice you should open\nyour eyes okay so go ahead and close\nyour eyes right now when the bell rings\nclose your eyes okay now what I want you\nto do is take a deep breath in and out\nin\nout in out\ngood now continue breathing slowly and\nfeel the straightness of your spine and\nwith each breath in feel your body\nexpand your shoulders expand your chest\nexpand and with each exhalation let your\nbody relax\nso I want you to envision your spine\nlike a pole and your body is like\nclothing that's hanging on the pole and\nwith each relaxation with each\nexhalation let your body sort of hang\noff of the pole\nbut the poll should remain straight Paul\nacknowledges\nyou\nyou\nand I want you to take a moment to hear\nthe sound of your breath\nyou\nyou\nand now place your finger on your third\neye\nremember not to touch keep it like a\ncentimeter or two away ideally not\ntouching hair or any skin\nand focus on the sensation of your\nforehead\nyou\nyou\nfocus on that point on your forehead\ntry your best not to think about what\nyou're doing or what's happening you\njust focus on the sensation keep your\narm there\nyou\nwe'll practice for a bit\nabout two minutes\nyou\nyou\ndirect all of your attention towards\nthat point\nyou\nyou\nand now let your hand come down and\nrelax and continue to focus your\nattention on your third eye direct your\nconcentration into it you may notice\nsome residual feeling just feel what it\nis\n[Music]\nI'm calm doesn't have to be breath boys\nand girls so not have to be breath was\nthat like for everyone they loved it\nyeah what a prising huh surprising I\nwhat suit I said relax surprising\nawesome\nwow I'm know I'm reading what they're\nsaying I don't know what was surprising\nfor him yeah relax ask people what's\ngonna awesome yeah what was surprising\nfor you guys the feeling generated it\nwas surprising absolutely perfect for a\nFriday after work feel renewed actually\ncalmed me down I leveled up that weird\nheadache for a moment okay so not all\ntechniques work for all people some\npeople in my chat so one person\ndescribed it when I you know when I did\nthis when the stream was relatively\nsmall and I could actually read the\nmessages one person described it as\ncharging a laser beam does that make\nsense to anyone so people are just\nsaying weirdest feeling I've ever had\nsome feeling some people are saying yes\nsome people are saying no some people\nare saying kinda\nand so some people experience something\nlike a tingling sensation which is fine\nand if you don't feel any of those\nthings that's fine too don't worry about\nit there are a hundred and twelve\ndifferent techniques of meditation one\nof which each supposedly is going to be\nlike natural and give people sort of an\neasy access to Samadhi which is a\nspiritual experience and so if this is\nnot the one that works for you that's\nokay it doesn't mean that you're doing\nanything wrong it's just different\nthings work for different people and so\nif you did experience a sensation I\nwould say that this is a good technique\nto practice so do it at home do it for a\nfew minutes at a time\nyou okay reckful yeah okay\nno there's um there's a video 112 is a\npopular number in gaming space okay yeah\nthere's a video of ryan lockwood is a\nguy speedrunning Goldeneye 64 for n64\nand his best time before this began I\nthink was 114 and he he gets really\nexcited that he skipped 113 and he got a\n112 and he's like screams I'm a legend\nand stuff like that it's good a video\nyou feel their emotion cool you should\nwatch it on your own time I will alright\nlet's watch it boys okay well I was\nactually it's such a weird a transition\nfrom being this calm to watch that video\nyou should watch a different timing okay\nsure so who should I rate reckful are\nyou streaming or you"
