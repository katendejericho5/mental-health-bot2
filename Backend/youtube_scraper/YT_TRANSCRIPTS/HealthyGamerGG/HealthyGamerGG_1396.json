    "transcript": "yeah okay can you explain how people\ncame up with meditation techniques they\nseem to be very specific and come from\ncertain people but how did those people\nfigure it out amazing question okay so\nhow did people discover meditation so no\nman okay\nso supposedly meditation techniques were\nrevealed knowledge so like someone was\ndoing something and they sort of claim\nthat they were shown or that this\nknowledge is revealed to them and I\nthink what's happened since then is that\nlike once you understand meditation it's\nkind of like like once you understand\nthe principles of the body the mind the\nsoul whatever whether you believe in it\nor not whatever you know you start to\nunderstand like how things work and then\nuse the people started to realize like\nokay there's a certain practice for a\ncertain kind of mind so there are some\nprinciples about the mind for example\nyou know the way to calm a mind is not\nby like holding it in place oddly enough\nbut is to let it run out of energy so if\nyou have like an ADHD mind\nyou can do a particular kind of\ntechnique that sort of slows it down so\nlike once you understand the principles\nof the mind like you understand how the\nmind works then you can come up with a\nmeditation technique to guide whatever\nyou want so I think about it this way\nlike if you guys play dota or Starcraft\nor whatever like they're they're builds\nright like you have video games where\nsomeone has a build order or like you\nhave a certain like set of like talents\nor itembuild or whatever you're like an\nitem progression and so how did someone\ncome up with like a build order in\nStarcraft 2 like they understood the\nfundamental like components of the game\nthat's being played and then they sort\nof figured out okay if I want to get\nfrom A to Z like and this is this is\nwhat I can work with how can I get to Z\nhow can I get to D how can I get to G\nhow can I get to H so it's kind of that\nway they started by first like\nunderstanding that like the core of of\nlike how human beings work and they\ndeveloped techniques to sort of function\non these different levels so I'll give\nyou guys kind of a couple of other sort\nof weird esoteric\nanswers to that so that people say that\nShiva so Shiva is one of the three Hindu\nTrinity so Hinduism has a bunch of gods\nbut one of the three main gods is this\nguy named Shiva and Shiva people say\nthat Shiva's basically the first yogi so\nShiva is the the is the person or God\nwho gave human beings meditation in the\nscience of yoga so if you look at Shiva\nlike he's like he's not you look at like\npictures of Hindu gods like they're\ngonna be doing all kinds of stuff like\nlaying down and like random stuff she\nwas like usually meditating that's what\nhe's doing\nand so who Shiva was I'm not sure I mean\nmy sense is that historically there was\nprobably like one teacher or maybe like\nthe concept of one teacher got kind of\nlike mo memorialized or\nanthropomorphised\nis like Shiva and he's like the original\nyogi some people claim to have been like\ntaught Shi by Shiva directly like\nthey're wandering in the Himalayas and\nthey're like going to a cave and there's\na guy there who's just like sitting\nthere and that that person will teach\nthem meditation and they think that\nthat's Shiva there is like there's\nstories about that I mean I don't know\nwhat to believe there but so Shiva\napparently is the first teacher of\nmeditation in a more let me just think\nfor a second if there are other ways to\nanswer that question yeah I guess that's\na good answer so that's sort of like\nwhat what the meditative traditions say\noh so I guess this is another chance to\ntalk about something so like for example\none way that like mantras are developed\nis there's this idea that when people\nmeditate they sort of heard this basic\nuniversal hum which is ohm so like oh my\nsort of the primordial oscillation of\nthe universe and then if they looked at\ndifferent sort of versions of ohm and\nthey came up with these twelve things\ncalled bija mantras which are like seeds\nand then if you combine each of those\nbeach mantras has a particular kind of\nenergy and when you combine those\nenergies and different combinations you\nsort of get like a dish right so it's\nsort of like if I combine different\ningredients like I get a\nand so those are mantras so when people\nlike chant like mantras is a form of\nmeditation\nthose are combinations of these\ndifferent ingredients but at the end of\nthe day someone understood the\ningredients I don't know who that is or\nhow they discovered it or what but when\nyou do meditation you'll you'll see what\nI'm talking about because when you\nmeditate for example oh actually the\nweekend yes I'm just relating like this\nis like the theory from the tradition\nthat I learned I'm not saying it's true\nor not true but yeah we're gonna do\nmeditation questions today we're gonna\ndo all meditation so I'll give you guys\njust one example of how someone\ndiscovered two of the beach mantras so I\nwant you guys to close your eyes and\nlisten to the sound of your breath so if\nyou listen to the sound of the breath\nand you like what are you so like the\nfirst thing is that there are two\ndifferent sounds right that the sound of\ninhalation is different from the sound\nof exhalation and then if you're\nbrushing your teeth listen to the sound\nof brushing your teeth and see if there\nare two sounds there as well and then as\nsomeone in chat points out it literally\nthe sound of the breath is the same as\nthe sound of the ocean so now go and\nlisten to the sound of the ocean and let\ngo listen and see if that's the same\nsound okay next time you're at the ocean\nlisten close your eyes listen to your\nbreath and listen to the sound of the\nocean and so then just like pretend your\nprimitive human right and then you're\nlike well that's kind of weird like\npretend you're like a live five thousand\nyears ago and you're like\nit sounds the same does that mean that\nthere's some kind of connection between\nmy breath and the ocean and so what the\nway that they discovered the beach\nmantras is they listen to all of the\nsounds this is my theory they listen to\nall of the sounds and they sort of\nfigured out that they're like twelve of\nthem that represent all of the\nphenomenon and so those are the beach\nmantras and then they listen to those\ntwelve sounds and they found one sound\nthat's sort of like underneath all of\nthem and that's oh now I don't know what\nto make it out like I don't think like\nas a scientist I don't know I mean these\nare just these are the the teachings of\nthe traditions that I study I think at\nthe end of the day I tend to gravitate\ntowards like science and like the first\nhalf of the stream was like lecture\nright so that's what I believe in I\nbelieve in like studying the quality of\nmind seeing the way the mind works\nlooking at it for yourself and trying to\nunderstand it like analyzing the nature\nof mine all of this other stuff like I\ncan give you guys answers although it's\nlike it's a different kind of tradition\nright because this is all like do you\nhave faith in it or not which is not\nwhat I'm about but what I try to do is\nlike explore this stuff for myself and\nsee what I can figure out so I do think\nit's kind of cool for example that the\nsound of the breath if you listen in the\nworld you'll hear it in a lot of\ndifferent places I don't know what like\nI don't know what to make of that like I\ndon't know if it's just you know the\nnature of our ears are like restricted\nwith the wavelengths that they can hear\nand so we're gonna hear a common sounds\nlike in the same way that our eyes like\nit's kind of like saying like oh if I go\nout into the world I can like see the\nsame colors everywhere I go like there's\nseven colors that I see it's all like\nseven colors man like it's like\neverything is connected man seven colors\nand it's like yeah duh it's just because\nour eyes have a limited visual spectrum\nand we can't see infrared and so that's\njust how our eyes perceive color so like\nmaybe the same is true of sound right\nlike let's be scientific about it so\nlike this stuff is like the spiritual\nstuff I think is like cool and\ninteresting cuz I like fantasy games it\nsort of like fantasy game\nlike it's like ffs like Naruto and\nchakras and and all that kind of stuff\nlike I think that stuff is cool but\nlet's be scientific about it right so\nI'm just gonna answer questions cuz\nthat's what we're doing today that's\nquestion number one so it took me like\n12 minutes to answer one question we've\ngot 60 so okay so dr. kay mentioned a\nform of meditation called yoga in the\nmid row to which he adds a positive\nreinforcement at the end I was wondering\nhow to do that also is there another\nmeditation for losing ego other than the\nlaser beam one it doesn't give me any\nsensations anymore okay good excellent\nokay so the first question is if you're\nchasing meditate if you're chasing\nexperiences so on stream we did this\nmeditation called charging the laser\nbeam in charging the laser beam like\neveryone loved because they did it and\nthey're like woah it's like I have a\nlaser beam that's like charging up in my\nforehead right and then what happens is\nyou run into the first problem of\nmeditation which is that you create an\nexpectation so as you look for the laser\nbeam your mind is no longer focused on\nyour forehead your mind is focused on\nlooking for the laser beam and so like\nthen you don't find the laser beam\nbecause in order to find the laser beam\nyou have to be focusing fully on the\nforehead so it's like the most common\nproblem in meditation is that if you\nchase an experience in meditation you\nwon't be able to find that experience\nagain most common problem so people will\nmeditate and before they understand what\nthe f they're doing they have some kind\nof really cool experience and the next\ntime they meditate they want that again\nthey're like okay like we're gonna do\nthis this time but expectation just\nruins it expectation makes it difficult\nfor you to focus the mind because your\nmind is hanging on to that expectation\nso you can't focus on the practice your\nmind becomes weak it becomes dissipated\nyou're no longer concentrated therefore\nno more experience so let go of the\nexpectation focus on the forehead just\nfocus on the forehead focus on the\nforehead the more you focus on the\nforehead the better your meditation will\nbe\nand newsflash folks charging the laser\nbeam is just the first sensation in that\npractice you do that practice for 15\nyears all kinds of cool stuff is gonna\nhappen stuff that I can't even describe\nbecause no one is gonna understand what\nthe f I'm saying like if I told you guys\non stream for those of you guys have\ncharged the laser beam you know what I'm\ntalking about but if for those of you\nguys who are relatively new and you're\nlike what on earth does it mean to\ncharge the laser beam in your forehead\nlike just think about that for a second\nlike no one is gonna understand what\nthat means so I can't even tell you what\nhappens because it's like literally not\ngonna make any sense\nso just charge the laser beam just focus\non the practice and stuff will happen\ndon't try to chase the sensation of the\nlaser beam okay all right so we can also\ndo yoga nidra at the end hey can you\ngive me any advice how can I find my\nmantra to do month or meditation month\nor is need to be given by like someone\nwho has a certain amount of spiritual\nexperience like you just don't find your\noh I mean I guess you can't find your\nmantra but I was given my mantra by a\nteacher and I've been doing that month\nor for 16 years and it has helped me\nfocus a lot it's a very good one and\nthen like I've sometimes given month\nrows to people which is not something\nthat like I can do on a regular basis\nbecause it all depends on the state of\nmy mind so I like there's one person for\nexample I tried to like find a month or\nfor them for like one year and I just\ncouldn't because my mind was just not\ncooperating other people I feel like I\nfigure it out so month rows are\ngenerally like given by a teacher so you\ndon't find it so sorry you don't just\nfind it so you have to find a teacher so\nwhat would you recommend for breathing\ntechniques for someone that has a\ndeviated system septum\nreally interested in what you were\ndiscussing with raffle today regarding\nthe notice on change in nostril openings\nso if you have a deviated septum you\nshouldn't do anything that requires you\nto breathe out of one nostril but there\nare a lot of meditation techniques that\nhave nothing to do with your nose or\nbreathing so Caius theorem is a great\nexample like so you can do any\nmeditation technique that doesn't have\nto do with breathing you can also do\nmeditation techniques that have to do\nwith breathing just not a nostril\npreferential technique so one technique\nthat I teach for example is like\nkapalabhati which is forceful exhalation\nso it's kind of going like this like\nthat so you can do forceful exhalations\nlike that doesn't deviated septums don't\nmatter so let's do kapalabhati together\nset up straight okay\nokay okay back straight voice wait do\nyou have you ever I taught you guys how\nto sit up straight and we talked about\nthis okay I'm gonna teach you guys how\nto sit up straight it's easy easy peasy\nlemon squeezy I promise you easy one of\nthe most broken things so that I ever\nlearned or discovered I don't know if\nany when I've taught me this or I mean I\njust sort of figured it out but easy\ntrick to sitting up straight okay let's\njust do it now yeah absolutely there's a\nproper way I'm gonna show you guys okay\nI'm gonna have to do this I need to know\nwhether y'all can hear me okay\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nokay you guys can see me right so I'm\ngoing to teach you guys a trick\nhow's it up straight okay so if you guys\ncan't grab a pillow grab a pillow so if\nyou can sit cross-legged I want you to\nsit cross-legged and then notice what\nhappens like what does your body feel\nlike doing you guys sit like this I\ncan't read twitch chat so okay I'm gonna\nhave to just like talk to Andrew so like\nif you guys see like when I sit\ncross-legged like what do I feel like\ndoing slouching right and so it's gonna\nbe hard to see but try this again this\nchair like what I feel like doing it\nright just left that's normally how we\nsit okay now how can I teaches so what I\nwant you guys to do is feel so feel the\nslouch and then I want you to stand up\nand notice what happens to your back\nwhen you stand\nright so you straighten up so now what I\nwant you guys to do is sit like this\nactually so if you have a chair I want\nyou to move to the edge of the chair and\nthen cross your legs in front how can I\ndo this okay so I want you to sit at the\nedge so like if you sit back you're\ngonna slouch okay nipple spotted okay\nso if you sit like you're gonna slap\nright so I want you to sit at the edge\nand then put your feet out in front of\nyou and then what happens to your what\nhappens to your back is if you sit\nforward with your feet straight in front\nof you and then move back and slouch and\nsit forward then what happens your back\nstraightens right so now what we're\ngonna do I'm gonna show you guys this\nbusiness okay cross leg and then we go\ninto half Lotus what do you guys notice\nabout my back so here's cross leg\nokay here's half of us what happens to\nmy back you don't have to do half Lotus\njust watch me okay and then full Lotus\nwhat happens right so you guys see this\nso this is full Lotus you don't have to\ndo full Lotus I'll teach you guys how to\ndo this without full Lotus okay\nso what's happened so if you want to sit\ncross-legged and then sit on a pillow\nand then notice what happens to your\nback if you sit on a pillow and then do\nhalf Lotus that works great\neasy now I'm gonna show you guys okay so\n[Music]\nslouched right take the pillow\nokay sit on the pillow what happens to\nmy back half Lotus easy so this is very\nimportant to understand anytime so if we\nlook at the progression of no Lotus so\nlook at my knees my knees are up here my\nhips are down here right so left hand is\nabove my right hand higher lower as I go\ninto half Lotus what happens they're\nabout the same and as I go into full\nLotus this is lower than this hand so\nall you need to do to sit up straight is\nto have your knees\nso here's him here's new budget awesome\nThunderbolt pose right so when our knees\nare lower than our hips our back will be\nstraight so let me show you guys the\nlast one so when I'm sitting in a chair\nhips are back here knee is up here as I\nsit forward knees go down hips stay here\nthat's simple when I stand knees are\ndown here hipster up here it's easy to\nsit up stand up straight right so if you\nwant your back to be straight all you\nneed to do is have your knees lower than\nyour hips that's it\nso if you're sitting I know and so this\nis important right it's physics it's not\nmath it's physics so like if you guys\nsee like like if you sit on a court with\nus so if you're in a chair like sit on a\ncushion and elevate your butt and then\nit's like easy sitting up straight is\nnot about posture it's about physics and\nif the weight of your body is\ndistributed through your spine and into\nthe ground it'll be easy you won't use\nany muscles if your center of gravity is\nnot along your spine then you'll use\nmuscles to prop yourself up and keep\nyourself from falling over and then\nyou'll get tightness over here your\npostures all messed up that's it\neasy-peasy okay all right well this is\ngreat I don't have to wear headphones\nbecause I'm not talking to anyone okay I\ncan't tell if the person who's asking me\nto demonstrate again is trolling me\nbecause that's annoying\nokay so okay you guys got that so just\nkeep your knees below your hips and like\njust just try it okay just try it at\nhome so if you're in a chair like put\ntwo pillows or three pillows under your\nbutt but not under your legs and see\nwhat happens to your back when you put\nthree when you sit on three pillows take\nlike two pillows and stick them on a\nchair and then sit in the chair and\nwatch what happens to your back okay all\nright armatures yeah armchairs are\ncomfortable to sit in but terrible for\nposture sitting on a stool is good\ndepends are your hips gonna be lower\nthan your knees when you sit on the\nstool okay all right so I'm getting a\nthousand questions but we've done like\nthree out of sixty so we're gonna go\nback ok-ran so like one or two more okay\nokay so actually this is another\nmeditation technique just sit in\ndifferent like degrees of ratios of hips\nto knees and pay attention to yourself\nand just see what your body feels like\nlike that is actually amazing meditation\nlet's just sit and feel so use one\npillow use two pillows use three pillows\nand just feel your body stand up sit on\nthe edge of stairs so like if you take a\nstaircase the second step from the\nbottom or the third step from the bottom\nsit there and let your feet be down the\nstairs and see how your body feels got\nit so she so go ahead and just do that\nlike do that on your own time easy peasy\nokay can you just clip your meditation\nportions of videos and make a youtube\nplaylist of them I shall ask my mods to\ndo that regarding meditation with\nmeditation I can focus my mind and stop\nit from wandering what if I enjoy\nwandering in the dream world I think\nthat's why I'm not motivated in doing\nmeditation yeah of course you must enjoy\nmotivation in the dream world let me\nexplain something to you guys so we're\ngonna we're gonna this is the last\nquestion we're gonna do okay this person\nsays I enjoy like letting my mind wander\nin the dream world like should I stop\nlike meditation doesn't let me do that\nso first of all you can enjoy the dream\nworld the rest of the time when you're\nnot meditating but I want to talk for a\nsecond about fantasy so when you guys\nfeel bad and you start to fantasize\nabout something like let's say that I\nfailed a test and unlike my mind wanders\nand I feel bad right and then my mind\nwanders to like the day that I'm gonna\nbe valedictorian and then everyone's\ngonna see then and then what is that\nwhat does that do to my emotions so when\nI fantasize like and I'm feeling bad I'm\nso confused okay\ntalking about fantasy right okay so this\nI'm gonna say okay so what you need to\nunderstand is I know she's just gonna\ncontrol you [ __ ] oh one day one day\nI'm gonna destroy I'm gonna just end\nstream okay so oh man I'm gonna troll\ny'all so hard\none day the boomer comments won't get to\nbe too much and my hatred from you and\nI'll fantasize about one day I'm gonna\ntroll them I'm gonna teach twit to a\nchat who's a Boomer now who is the\nBoomer now fantasy about revenge\nabsolutely so let's talk about fantasy\nokay what you need to understand is that\nthe motivation to change and the energy\nto create fantasies in your mind comes\nfrom one bucket so when I like get\nhumiliated at school I feel a lot of\nnegative emotion and if I channel that\nemotion in the right way I'm gonna\nactually change my life like I'll be\nlike oh man like I'm just like out of\nshape and those guys like run me down\neveryday so I got to work out and like\nget better and get healthy but if I\nfantasize it decompresses all of that\nnegative emotion the negative emotion\ngoes away like cuz you fantasize right\nthen you feel good at the end of the\nfantasy that's what the fantasies that's\nwhy it's so addicting so the energy to\nmake a change in your life in the energy\nto fantasize comes from one bucket so\nyou have to decide where you which which\nway you want to use that energy do you\nwant to use it to fantasize about your\nfuture or do you want to use it to make\na change and just notice this notice the\nthings in your life that you fantasize\nabout are those the things that you get\nstuck on or those the things that you\nmove forward on the more you fantasize\nthe more it saps away your energy to\nactually make a change\nyeah of course they feel really good\nthey make you feel really good and\nthere's actually some neuro scientific\nevidence to support this theory this has\nbeen sort of my understanding based on\nmy own like looking at my mind and yoga\nand meditation but if we look at the\nlearning circuitry of the brain if we\nlook at the behavioral change circuitry\nof the bank brain learning circuitry is\nvery closely tied to your amygdala and\nlimbic system so our brain is wired to\nlearn lessons from pain so like if you\nyou know we're walking down the street\nand then like you slip on the ice and it\nhurts a lot you are going to learn very\nquickly to pay attention to like ice on\nthe street right like pain is like the\nthe greatest teacher so if you like\nlet's say so I mean this happens\nsometimes where I'll work with someone\nwho's has to do with like deal with\ninfidelity in their marriage and if\nsomeone has to deal with infidelity in\ntheir marriage if someone's like partner\nis unfaithful there they learn to like\nnever trust anyone again it's very hard\nfor them to trust people in the future\nand so like pain like teaches us and\nchanges our behavior they're like [ __ ]\nthis I'm never gonna date anyone again\nlike I'm never gonna fall in love never\nit changes that person it changes their\nbehavior and it all comes from pain and\nwhen you have that pain from a negative\nexperience when you have shame and stuff\nlike that and then you fantasize it\nshuts that part of your brain off which\nis the same thing the same thing that\nvideo games do when you experience\nnegative emotion and you play a video\ngame it shuts off that negative\nemotional part of your brain which\nchanges your motivational Drive and and\nchanges like deactivates the part of\nyour brain that causes you to learn from\nyour mistakes just think about that for\na second\nthat our brain is wired to teach us how\nto learn from our mistakes and that\ngenerally speaking the way that we\nperceive mistakes is through pain right\nlike when you do something dumb or\nstupid or you hurt yourself or you hurt\nsomeone else you feel bad and then you\nlearn a lesson from it like think about\nthe lessons that you learned and think\nabout whether pain were involved and\nthen understand that like if you turn\noff the circuitry that has you\nexperience pain like how are you gonna\nlearn and so now we understand really\nimportantly like why people who play\nvideo games make the same mistakes like\nover and over and over again like you\nknow you should go to class you know you\nshould study harder you know you should\ngo to the gym but you don't have any\nreinforcement from it because those\nnegative emotions are being turned off\nit's not your fault you're not dumb it's\njust you're shutting off one of the\nbiggest parts of your brain that teaches\nyou to change and fantasy does the same\nthing that fantasy like calms the those\nnegative parts down it sort of soothes\nyou makes you feel better and then\nyou're stuck\nyou're stuck\nso do your best not to fantasize or be\ncareful with what you fantasize my life\ngot a whole lot better when I stopped\nfantasizing about when I started\nfocusing on doing things instead of like\nhoping and like wishing like oh like one\nday I'm gonna do this or one day I'm\ngonna do this I just stopped I mean I\ndidn't just stop I would continue to do\nbut I started changing the focus of my\nmind I used thought or not to change the\nattention and to focus the concentration\nand to concentrate on one thing and then\nas I focused and concentrated on one\nthing I batted fantasies aside when\nfantasies would arise you just nope I\njust focus on the thing that you're\ndoing your life will change\nyour life will change just in your mind\nyou've got a certain number of stat\npoints right\nlike actually not stat points let's call\nit like minerals or vespene gas like you\nhave a certain number of minerals and\nyou can spend those minerals on creating\nchange or you can spend those minerals\non fantasizing\nsame pool of energy same pool\nI still play dota whenever I can okay\nokay last question\nokay so I built up a routine of daily\nmeditation it's been good however I feel\nit's a bit simplistic and hasn't changed\nin over three years currently I'm most\nmostly just doing a type of mindfulness\nmeditation where I just breathe and try\nto notice my thoughts and bring my\nattention to my breath what resources\ndifferent techniques can I investigate\nto expand where I am watch our steam\nstream I was gonna say bro or a woman or\na person just watch the stream we're\ngonna go through a lot of different\nmeditation techniques okay so let's do\none last meditation technique so I think\nyou guys have like we're gonna do Sean\nMookie mudra and bro Marie Brown I am\nwhich I know some of you guys liked and\nsomebody all didn't but this is gonna be\nlike a very intensive meditation so\nwe're gonna try it's gonna look [ __ ]\nweird and you're gonna feel [ __ ] we\nwere doing it until you actually do it\nso this is a meditation called bhramari\nmudra and Sean Mookie I mean sorry Sean\nMookie mudra and bhramari pranayama so\nSean Mookie mudra is like this I type it\nstop typing chat I'm gonna type\nsomething if you guys if you guys type\nyou're gonna lose it no no it's going no\nno ok so Sean Mookie mudra is Sanskrit\nfor closing of the nine gates okay so\nthis is Sean beaucoup mudra so we have\nthis thing called the pinna of our ear\nso push the pinna up and then thumb\ninside the ear canal\nokay so thumb inside the ear canal\nso this is what's on will ki-moon deter\nit looks like so corners of the mouth\nright outside the nostrils inside of the\nthe eyes outside of the eyes okay and\nthen bra Marie Brown I am is where I'll\ntell you guys how to do it so Brahma\ndeeper that's just the first phase\nthat's a mudra that's a hand sign that's\nlike going like this like you guys know\nlike these kinds of hand signs that\npeople do when they meditate that's a\nmudra it's not the actual meditation but\nI'm buddy piranha I am is Bea's breath\nso you're gonna buzz like a bee or hum\n[Music]\nokay we're gonna put them together\n[Music]\ngot it so I'm gonna walk you guys\nthrough it we're gonna do five breaths\nokay and it's gonna be hard to tell what\nI'm doing because you're not gonna be\nable to see me or hear me so I'm gonna\njust do it you guys do it okay okay\n[Music]\nyou\nyou\nyou\nokay\nthe finger part I probably should have\ndone slower okay so we're gonna do I'm\ngonna try to teach you guys again\ngot it so we'll do again corners outside\ninside side\nand the thumbs pin pin of the ear in the\nend-of-the-year canal plug it up okay\nyou\nyou\n[Music]\nokay\nyou\nyou\nall right\nokay if you guys want an easier version\nwe'll do this\nyou could do above the eyebrows and been\nbuilt below the eyes\n[Music]\nyou\n[Music]\none
