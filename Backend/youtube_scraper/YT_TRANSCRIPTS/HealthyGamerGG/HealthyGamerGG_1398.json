    "transcript": "you need to be closer to the listener\nbecause if you're the listener you can\ndo it the person who doesn't do it is\nyou with all your [ __ ] psychological\n[ __ ]\nso this is a sound meditation so what I\nwant you guys to do is listen I'm gonna\nring the bell okay and what I'm gonna do\nis ask you guys to listen to the try to\ndetect is subtle of an oscillation as\nyou can okay close your eyes yes set up\nstraight close your eyes we're gonna\nbegin\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\njust listen to the oscillation and now I\nwant you to ask yourself who is doing\nthe listening think about the person\nthat you are\nthink about your gender and ask yourself\nis a man a woman or something else\nlistening\ncontinue to listen listen for the\noscillation and now think about the\nlocation that you occupy and where are\nyou when you listen to this do you even\nhave a location how would you know where\nyour location is as you listen what do\nyou feel where are you just focus on the\nlisten\n[Music]\nand now ask yourself who is doodles you\nmay identify with a particular name but\nas you listen are you that person or are\nyou just the listener\ncontinue to listen to the oscillations\nnotice that your mind activates that you\ntry to answer my questions that you\nthink and will ring the bell three more\ntimes\nand now I want you to just listen to the\nsound of the self just hear whatever you\nhear within yourself and just listen and\nnow let yourself come back\nokay so who was doing the listening all\nright so like when you say me like who\nis me right so like this is what I like\nso first of all not every technique\nworks for everyone okay but this is this\nis what I want you to just stop and\nthink about like that person who is\nlistening is is you but that's not like\nthe person who lives your life the\nperson who lives your life is different\nright like the person that like lives\nyour life has thoughts and fears and\nfeels stock and has anxiety and like is\na failure and can't launch and stuff\nlike that but the person who's listening\nis someone else like none of that stuff\napplies to them\nso some of y'all get this some of y'all\ndon't which is fine and now think about\nthat for a second you have a person or a\nplace within you that is free from all\nof that and think about why your life is\nhard your life is hard because you don't\nall of the problems that you have are\npresent all the time but those problems\nare like they're sort of real but\nthey're also like not really real so you\ncould like all that stuff is in the mind\nand you have a place within yourself\nthat is like free from all that like\njust think about that like think about\nwhere you're stuck in life like what you\nshould do and ask yourself what would\nthe listener do like the listener can do\nstuff relatively easily because the\nlistener actually doesn't really give a\n[ __ ] about much\nokay so some of y'all are gonna get this\nand some of you don't and that's fine so\nthis is the important thing to remember\nfor those of you guys who do get it the\nlistener would just do it but you don't\njust do it right so if you want to start\ndoing it in life that's what she said\nthen you need to be closer to the\nlistener because if you're the listener\nyou can do it the person who doesn't do\nit is you with all your [ __ ]\npsychological [ __ ] the listener just\ndoes just listens it can just do and so\njust like think for a second okay that\nif you can become the listener than\ndoing is easy it's not hard doing is\nhard for you it's not hard for the\nlistener so if you spend time if you\nactivate listener mode you can do\nwhatever the [ __ ] you want listen it\ndoesn't give a [ __ ]\nBlizzard is like I'm just listening like\nI'm just here to do the thing that needs\nto be done I'm not worried about the\nfuture I'm not worried about the past\nand you think about what paralyzes you\nit's the future in the past not the\npresent future paralyzes you past\nparalyzes you not the present listener\ndoesn't know anything about the future\nof the present or the past listener only\nknows about the present it's all\nlistener understands if you try to even\nask the listener what's gonna happen the\nfuture the listeners like I have no\n[ __ ] like there is no such thing as\nthe future this is just the sound that's\nall I am and that's all there is\nso listen listen to the sound of your\nbreath and listen to the sound of waves\nare they the same are they different\nstart listening\nokay so I'm glad that this meditation\nworked for some of you guys I'm\nstruggling with trying to understand how\nhonored I can teach meditation over the\ninternet because some things are hard to\nteach over the Internet\nbreath stuff is really easy sound stuff\nis like I'm gonna have to figure it out\nI love sound so maybe I'll study and\nI'll try to find out if there are more\ntechniques that we can do over over the\nInternet but thank you guys very much\nfor coming we're gonna be streaming on\nFriday from 3 to 5 and you know if you\nguys have people that you want to come\non let them know let us know and try to\ntry to make it happen"
