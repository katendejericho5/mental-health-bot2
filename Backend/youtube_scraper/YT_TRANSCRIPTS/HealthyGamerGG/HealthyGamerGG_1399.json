    "transcript": "but I think the basic problem is that\nyou have a lack of experience in life\nlike just experiencing different things\nand what you need to do is just go out\nand do something like go do different\nthings they don't have to be good they\ndon't have to be bad but as you start to\ndo different things you are going to\ndevelop a different sense of self from\nthe one that you have now and as you\nchange your sense of self your ability\nto move in the world is going to change\nso tell me a little bit what are we\ncalling you Andrew uh entry sign okay so\nAndrew tell me a little bit about what's\ngoing on and how we can help okay\nso sorry I'm like really nervous right\nnow it's like a really fantastic yeah\nyeah antastic\nlet's start there okay yeah let's start\nthere okay so what are you feeling when\nyou feel nervous uh my heart's beating\nreally fast I kind of excited okay I'm\nshaking okay yeah\nso let's let's just think about that so\nthe way that you're feeling right now\nhow does that affect your actions like\nwhat is it making you want to do it's\nmaking me not want to open it absolutely\nright and I don't know if you were\nplanning on opening up or whatever but\nso let's just notice that right so what\ndo you feel like doing\nuh I mean just talking like there are\ndefinitely things that I want to open up\nand I want to talk about things but it's\njust kind of it's like stick it stop\nbeautiful okay beautiful so stock is a\nfantastic place to start I mean it's it\nI'm just noticing I do this thing where\nI you know I say it's been - I'm glad\nthat you're noticing where you are\nbecause that's where we have to start so\nthe progress like the the path to moving\nforward starts where you are and if you\nif there's a part of you that doesn't\nwant to move forward like that's really\nimportant to acknowledge because until\nwe recognize that like we can't move\nforward if we just ignore it which is\nwhat we do a lot of the times right\nwe're like I should move forward so let\nme just like ignore this part of myself\nand let me move forward but that's not\nhow it works so great so now we've got a\ncouple of options Andrew so you don't\nfeel like opening up right I I do but\nit's hard I think I could like like just\npower through it yes what I usually end\nup doing that kind of stuff yeah so I'm\ngonna give you an option okay I'm gonna\ngive you options one is we can try\nmeditating actually right now and see\nwhat happens to those feelings of not\nwanting to open up see what happens to\nthe feelings of nervousness\nor I can talk to you in a way that\nfacilitates you opening up and kind of\neasy into it uh let's do number two just\nkeep it moving okay so tell me a little\nbit about what's going on and what\nbrings you on stream well I think the\nfirst time I saw you was a clip on the\nlive stream fails subreddit and it was\nit was really funny so I I just wanted\nto check it out and I just ended up\nreally like liking the content and I\nwent on YouTube and watched all the\nvideos have been here maybe like since\nfrom up announcer yeah\nso what resonated with you about our\ncontent um I mean just like a lot of\npeople who came on like I feel like I\ncould relate to a lot of their problems\nso like what um I mean I think it\nstarted off with like with like the game\naddiction but just I mean just like life\nthings in general\nit's kind of hard for me to I think of\nlike exactly like he's out sir so yeah\nwhat is it that you'd like to talk about\ntoday hmm maybe just how to move forward\nin life great fantastic so I want to\njust point something out to you do you\nwant to move forward in this\nconversation absolutely and yet you\ndon't there's there's there's two parts\nof me there's one part that that\nabsolutely wants to and I know that it\nneeds to be done but there's another\npart that's like very hesitant to\nfantastic so I think you are doing\nsomething that's actually really cool\nand gets me like psychologically excited\nwhich is that like your problem in life\nis that you're stuck and you're actually\nfacing a microcosm of that problem with\nthis conversation I can kind of see that\nyeah that's funny like you see that yeah\nlike you you know you need to but you\ndon't feel like it does that mean tribe\nmaybe I feel like it but maybe I'm\nscared absolutely so what are you scared\nof in life\nuh maybe like moving out of my comfort\nzone\nokay stepping up okay so what is\nstepping up look like to you\nthat's a great question I I don't think\nI know the answer that I think I feel\nlike there's things that I need to do\nbut I don't really know like what the\nright thing to do is yeah so let's just\nthink about that for a second right okay\nif I go to a restaurant and someone asks\nme what would you like to order and I\nsay I don't know what am I gonna get\nyou're gonna get stares and they're\ngonna wait for you to pick something out\nyeah but like you don't know what you\nwant right right so you don't know what\nprogress even looks like maybe I have\nlike an idea of what progress could look\nlike and maybe I've tried some things\nbut sure yeah okay well I started to\nrecently go to the grocery store and\nlike buy fruits like ever were you\nmentioning like pineapple is good and\nyou know that isn't stuff like that so\nyeah just trying to eat a little better\nand where you drink more water to do\nthat yeah I think I've been doing it for\na couple weeks now just buying buying\nfruits at least you can start eating so\nbuying a fruit is like actually not like\neating the fruit is what we're going for\nyeah it's it's it's definitely like a\nmulti-step process like leaving the\nhouse going to the grocery store and\ntaking the fruit home and then eating it\nyou know it's yeah how do you feel about\nthat uh I feel good but maybe I feel\nlike I could do more\nabsolutely yeah so I'm gonna say I'm\ngonna tell you what's on the other side\nof\nI could do more so there's another side\nof that coin and I could do more is\nmaybe like a little bit optimistic can\nyou imagine what the pessimistic side of\nthat coin is um maybe like what I'm\ndoing doesn't matter absolutely right so\nit I could do more the flip side of the\ncoin is I'm not doing enough okay yeah\nis that how you feel sometimes yeah\nactually no I think yeah for sure yeah\nyeah I think so too yeah okay so you're\nnot like you're not cutting it right\nlike you should be cutting it you're not\ncutting it you're just not yeah you're\nnot making it yeah yeah like Oh like\nthese are like baby steps like I should\nbe taking like big boy steps yeah so\nyeah what I'm getting from you is that\nthe amount of progress or change that\nyou need to make in life is far greater\nthan what you're doing yes so it feels\nlike the progress that you're making on\nthe one hand seems like kind of cool and\non the other hand seems woefully\ninsufficient yes how long have you been\nfeeling that way mmm\nfeeling like just insufficient mm-hmm\nlike you should be doing more I think it\nmight have started after graduating\ncollege but maybe even before that okay\nbut it didn't really start to sink in\nuntil like much later yeah so that's\ngreat I mean that it's not great I think\nit's good that you noticed that this\nfeeling started in college which is very\ncommon let me put it that way\nmm-hmm so I Andrew like do you know what\nwhat the age group what the most common\nage group is of people who reach out to\nme probably people around age like in\ntheir mid-20s I would imagine yeah so\nlike the earliest is like 2021 why don't\nyou 16 or 17 year olds reach out to me\nvery much what do you think they don't\nthink about those kinds of things\nthey're still they're still young like\nthey're in school and they kind of have\nlike a path\nand they can kind of like to have things\nto do yeah so what starts to happen\naround 20 or 21 did you start to think\nabout the future\noh sorry what are you saying yeah yeah\nyeah right good yep and and so I'll tell\nyou like what I think it is is that when\nyou're 20 you're on the same path as\neveryone else in college you may have\ngreat upset or batter or grades that are\nworse but when you're 21 like\nsomething's there's like this little\nlike like the hair on your neck starts\nto back up there's this little tickle of\ndoubt that starts because even though\nyou may be going to class like you're\nnot getting internships right yes you're\nnot doing like the extra stuff that\npeople are doing that you should be\ndoing yes yeah it kind of describes me\nin school yeah yeah right and that\nstarts to scare you a little bit because\nyou're like oh like maybe I should be\ndoing more\nbut like I'm kind of going to class and\nI'm gonna graduate but like these other\npeople are doing this additional stop so\nyou start to worry and then as you start\nto get older so that's the first time\nthat you start to see that there's a\ndivergence between you and other people\nyes and as you get older like what\nhappens\nit's the gap gets bigger if there's a\nthere's a big difference and how is how\nold are you now Andrew I am going to be\n26 and about two months and how big is\nthe gap now injured it's pretty big so\nwhy are you coming on stream today\nAndrew um well that's very clever I like\nhow we're opening up here just to get\nfigure out what to do next you know like\nI knew yeah I feel like I need help yeah\nyeah but I mean can you be more specific\nI guess like I feel like you're trying\nto go somewhere yeah I am trying to go\nsomewhere twitch at is where I'm going\nso yeah that's good so yeah when I was\nthe answer that I'm looking for is like\nyou're here to close that gap yeah right\nlike if it's if that's not it then let\nme know like we sometimes make\nhypotheses right we arrive at\nconclusions you gotta let me know like\nis that what you're here for is to close\nthe Hat um I feel like we can roll with\nthat yeah I'm like I feel like there's\nlots of things that I'd like to fix but\nwe can start there yeah\nlet's turn okay let's talk about the\nother ones sure\nwhat else do you want to fix um I don't\nknow I think that's it like it just\nboils down to like I don't feeling like\nI'm like on track all night like I feel\nlike I'm uptight wait so is that what it\ndoes boil down to or it doesn't because\nif I mind our being off track and\ngetting on track is the same as closing\nthe gap yeah yeah it is yeah but yeah\nyeah but then you're saying there's\nother stuff I think the other stuff\nboils down to that if that makes sense\nokay sure so it all gets to down to that\nit all comes down to that I think I'd\nlike to think that yeah so I think that\nthere's more so I think as good as\ntwitch Etta's and as good as we are I\nthink that there's a part of you that's\nactually going towards that answer out\nof safety okay is there something that\nyou're like kind of concerned about like\nemotionally is there something that\ngives you a lot of anxiety or concern\nthat you don't feel comfortable talking\nabout on stream um maybe some things but\nthey're not I don't think they're that\nrelated I'm not sure yeah so Tom can you\ntell me a little bit about those sounds\nlike the answer's no not right now\nI feel like we can get there I feel like\nwe can get there yeah okay okay okay so\ngood so Andrew yes we can talk about\nclosing the gap but I don't think that's\ngonna be what you need okay so I think\nthat that like we've got to explore this\nout like with the other thing like I\ndon't know what it is I don't know\nthere's other things I guess but yeah\nokay yeah because I don't know because I\nI think you're right it all kind of\nboils down to closing the gap but like\nlet me explain this to you so to get on\ntrack in life you have to deal with all\nthe things that you don't want to talk\nabout yes agreed yeah so like let's talk\nabout one of those specifically instead\nof this abstract concept so this is also\nsomething to understand when we're\ndealing with abstract concepts\nwhat does that do to us like what does\nthat do to our mind okay yeah okay no I\nI think I just had trouble like thinking\nof like things so I went to school I'll\nsee this as Gracie I like that we\ntransition right I went to school and\nready to write out it when I graduate as\n2012 sub up for three years and I\ngraduated with a degree in game design\nand I came out the back end of it\nthinking like oh [ __ ] like actually\ndon't know how to do any of this stuff\nand I just for a year like I didn't do\nanything I didn't work I just stayed at\nhome and played games all day and then\ndid you have fun I think um it's fun for\na little bit and I think it's fun when\nyou're playing it but like thinking\nabout it like I don't know if I\nnecessarily regret doing it okay yeah\nbut I ended up just taking up a retail\njob and that's what I still do and I've\nbeen doing that for the last three years\nso I feel like you know like I went to\nschool and it's like I had this big\nvision and this is the thing that I\nwanted to do for the rest of my life and\nthen I finish it it's like wait I\nactually don't know if I want to do it\nor if I'm cut out for it or if I even\nlike to do it so yeah okay yeah you're\nvery good\nI like this that was good well what\nwhat's how we got there that we got\nthere\nit came what's there how about me person\nwhere we are where we're uh we're\ndealing with the issues directly no I\nsaid what's the issue requested the\nissue is I don't have a sense of purpose\nI guess like career-wise\nyeah I think there's more to it than\nthat\nI think that's that's your abstract\nthat's a saw I think here's the\noperative words right so I don't know if\nI want to do it I don't know if I'm cut\nout to do it I don't know if I'm able to\ndo it yeah so I think that there's sure\nlike sense of purpose is once again an\nabstract but I noticed something about\nyou Andrew which is that you go to\nabstract concepts for like a feeling of\nsafety okay I can see that right so\nthis is sort of like and it's very\nCommons because if we can make something\nintellectual like if we start using our\nintellectual or analytical mind what\npart of our mind do we get to ignore the\nfeeling part absolutely\nright so so I thought I didn't realize\nyou made some kind of breakthrough but\nit seems like you made some kind of\nbreakthrough and I think I did yeah but\nI think which what should what what I\nwhen you said that I think the main\nthing is you got in touch with like\nsomewhat like you put words to your\nactual fears and what I'm hearing from\nyou is that you're conflating or\ncombining a sense of purpose with a\nsense of capability\nyou're like mixing the two in your mind\nright you're saying there's a difference\nbetween I don't want to do this and I\ndon't think I can do it and I think your\nreal problem is that since you're not\nsure you can do it you're not willing to\nlet yourself want to do it\nmmm okay right so I'll give you guys\nlike just think like I think that was a\nlittle bit confusing the way I said it\nwhat did you understand\num well I only want to do it if I'm good\nat it if I'm gonna be good absolutely\nyeah absolutely right\nyeah and what does that mean for you\nlike like just think about that as a\nstrategy it's not a very good one\nbecause why not you don't do like you're\nonly good at the things that you know\nhow to do and if you don't try to do\nthings you don't know how to do you're\nnever gonna like you just you're not\ngood at things that you that you just\nstarting at it absolutely\nso Andrew what's your [ __ ] problem\nman I you're there you're gonna it's\ngonna be that I need to try and do it\nright I need to go and do something just\ntry it just do it\nyeah sort of right so so like that's the\nproblem right so the problem is that you\nlack confidence in yourself so you want\nto do the thing that you know you can do\nbecause like you don't have faith in\nyourself that you'll be able to handle\nit so you don't want to like go out so\nlike if I go hiking in the wilderness if\nI have faith that I know how to find\nfood and water and navigate and build\nshelter\nI don't need certainty about what I'm\ngonna encounter does that make sense\nlike I have faith in my skills to\nsurvive what I'm hearing from you is\nthat you don't have faith in your skills\nto survive so you're not willing to try\nand then the most devastating thing that\nyou do to yourself is since you're if\nyou're afraid that you're not good it's\nsomething you don't let yourself even\nwant and that's where the lack of\npurpose comes from because you don't\neven know what you want like I asked you\nlike what is like a good life look like\nand you're like I don't know I think you\ndo know what you want I just don't think\nyou let yourself want what you want okay\nyou don't like myself okay so I think\nfor me like my experience was that I\nwent to school for three years for like\ngame design and then I came out the back\nend and it's like I don't know how to do\nanything and it's like okay well I kind\nof tried in school and like maybe that\nwas proof to me like oh like\nactually don't know how to do anything\nor if I do if I don't I don't like it\ncuz I did try right I tried for three\nyears but maybe I just didn't like I\ndidn't give it my full effort you look\nif you give it your full effort I don't\nthink I did but I can't I can't I don't\nknow if I can say for sure like if I\nfeel like I did or not I feel like there\nare times in school where I did and\ntimes in school I did it but even when I\ndid even when I did I don't think I\nnecessarily enjoyed it like it wasn't\nwhat I thought it was going to be okay\nyeah period um I'm just gonna think for\na second is that okay yeah I'll just\nthink out loud for a second I'm trying\nto get a sense of like we were talking\nabout something that wasn't game design\nlike I'm trying to move you away from\nthinking about game design and you keep\ncoming to game design you keep coming to\ncollege and so I'm trying to figure out\nlike what the significance of your\ndesire to talk about the way that you\nfeel around colleges I I think that\ngrowing up as a kid like I always had\nvideo games and that's what I grew up\nthinking like all I wanted to do\nsomething like game related like I do\nsomething you know it's playing games or\nmaking games or whatever and then I\nactually went to school for it like like\nmy whole life like I'm climbing like the\nmountain that's like like video games\nlike I'm gonna base my whole life around\nthis and then I get to the top and what\nI get my kicked off like didn't blanking\nlike when with us is like he's coming up\nin scar like kicks him off the mountain\nyeah it's like that like I die does that\nfeel feels like I died like my like like\nthe Rudd guts whipped up from under me\nlike I got kicked like you watch I've\nbeen watching people play jump King it\nfeels like that like you get to the top\nand you fall off off the side of the map\nand you you just hit the bottom okay\nyeah that's some pretty powerful imagery\nyeah do you feel like someone did that\nto you\nlike myself I don't know I'm asking so I\ncame in the image it's all it's not like\nMufasa tripped and fell right it's like\nhe climbs to the top of the mountain and\nthen scar like sinks his claws into\nmufasa's like hands and then flings him\noff were you to flog off or did you just\nslip I don't know\nmaybe a part of me wants to say that\nlike I set myself up for that like\nthere's a part of me that like wanted to\ndo it and then there was another part of\nme that was like maybe you should try to\ndo something else instead because I\nwasn't fully enjoying it\ndid someone [ __ ] you over me I guess\nokay yes some something else that gets\nme psychologically excited right because\nlike you are the scar and you are the\nMufasa yep yep I mean is that how you\nfeel like you feel like you did this to\nyourself like I let myself down like I\nkicked myself off is that how you feel\nyeah kind of a little bit what's that\nlike it's almost kind of relieving in a\nweird way how so like like it's within\nmy it's within my power to like to like\ntake action until I kind of do something\nabout it how do you feel about that\nI think risk I think I'm still back to\nnot knowing if it's the thing that I\nreally wanted to do or if I should just\ntry to do something else yeah I'm gonna\nthink it for another second\nyeah so Andrew I'm a little bit\nsurprised because you're making\nrevelations that I'm not I mean it's\nclear because I was surprised when you\nsaid it it's helpful or it feels good to\nrecognize that which I believe that's\njust not the answer that I was expecting\nso I'm trying to recalibrate a little\nbit and try to understand your\nperspective and on the flip side there's\na part of me that's like I don't have to\nunderstand it seems to be helping the\nguy so let's just tell you me anywhere\nactionable it's like okay like these are\nkinds of things like I feel like I've\nhad this conversation with myself that\nmaybe like not out loud with another\nperson okay yeah\nwhat are what do you tell yourself what\nare the conversations that what do you\ntell yourself when you talk to yourself\nhey well you know I tried I tried to\nkind of succeed in school with the thing\nthat I really wanted to do and it didn't\nreally work out so maybe we can try to\ndo something else and I might end up\nliking that more or that might be like a\ndifferent path that I could take in life\nokay yeah and how do you feel about it's\nnot working out\nit sucks mm-hmm like I mean like I was\nsaying like it's it's the thing that I\nkind of imagined myself doing like\nthat's pretty much like the one thing\nthat I always kind of had going for me\nor that I thought that I had going for\nme and it's like well now I have to kind\nof like just like look for something\nelse yeah so now now I think I mean it\nsounds like you've gotten somewhere\nwhich is great but no I feel like I'm\nunderstanding you a little bit better so\nthank you so much for you know answering\nmy questions so I think I want everyone\nwho's listening and for you to just\nthink about this Andrew so like you've\nput all of your eggs in one basket\nyes right and then like what happened to\nyour basket Hey someone took my basket\nor the eggs went bad\nyes see once again there's like there's\nlike a villain somewhere in your\nsubconscious mind\nyeah it's not I lost the basket drop the\nbasket the eggs broke look they're all\nkinds of weird [ __ ] you can say which is\nwhat I was expecting\nyou said someone took the basket and\nthis is like consistent with the Mufasa\nimagery and scar so like who took the\nbasket and I don't think it's yourself\nlike did someone take your [ __ ]\nbasket it's gonna be my parents isn't it\nthat's that's where this is going no I\ndon't know I think it might I don't know\nanything about your parents like you're\nthe one your subconscious mind is\nproducing all of these like faint like\nbecause you can say I mean I give you\nsuch a broad analogy of eggs in a basket\nyep and and like I thought like in my\nmind the analogy is that the eggs are\nfragile so they break easily so if you\ndrop it all the eggs break like that's\nwhat's in my mind like I don't know I've\nnever even thought about it okay it's\nconsciously me maybe maybe like like\nlike who took it away from you Andrew so\nI don't think that stolen I think just\nthe okay eggs my bed the eggs aren't bad\nI like that better because it's like I\nkind of I kind of like skated by like in\nschool but in life too I feel like just\njust enough to get by and like I had the\neggs all along like I was able to keep\nthem safe but I guess they were able to\ndo anything with it\nwell I guess don't have the eggs they're\njust really there there they went\nthey're spoiled okay yeah all right so\nlike let's just be transparent for a\nsecond if you I don't want you to try to\nchange what you say but can we just\nacknowledge that if there's some other\nlike open-ended weird Rorschach kind of\nlike statement that I make and if\nsomeone does something bad to you then\nwe've got to talk about that like I can\nlet two out of three fine like the\nimagery of Mufasa and like it's not like\nyou fell off the mountain the eggs went\nbad like fine but if we hear it again\nwe're gonna think about that a little\nbit more okay okay so okay I mean so I\nthink that let's just go back to the\neggs in in the basket and so so you have\nyou know you've put your entire life\ninto video game design like with how how\nearly on did you decide you wanted to\nmake video games I don't know if I\nnecessarily wanted to make video games I\njust knew that I wanted to be involved\nbut I just making games is kind of like\nthe most like involved involved in what\nI could think just like you know I like\ngo to work and do video game stuff and I\ncome home and I play video games so okay\nit's like I went to school for video\ngame design and then somewhere along the\nway you you what why did you think that\nyou weren't so like as you were in\nschool for video game design did you\nlike what you were learning kind of well\nthat's the problem I think part of it I\ncan't necessarily put the whole blame on\nmyself I think there are parts of school\nwhere I was never able to like kind of\ndo what I really wanted to do in terms\nof like game stuff if that makes sense\nhold on when you say you didn't put the\nwhole blame on yourself does that mean\nwe're putting the blame on someone else\nno I feel like there's so there are\nparts there definitely things that I\ncould have done to kind of make to make\nmore use of my time but I feel like the\nenvironment that I was in was not\nnecessarily like helpful either okay\nwhat does that mean um tell me about the\nenvironment well it's kind of like goes\nback to like putting like just like\nhoping for the future like when I was in\nhigh school like I had an idea of what\nlike college is gonna be like and\nactually got there and it was it really\nanything like I imagined it being okay\ndid you feel like you got taken\nadvantage of maybe a little but I feel\nlike I feel like I probably could have\ndone more to kind of prevent that like\nthe tools were kind of available to me\nbut I never really made the most of it\nokay I hear what you're saying\nokay did you feel like college could\nhave done a better job of preparing you\nfor your career like for most people\ncollege prepares them for their career\nright yeah I kind of feel that way but\nat the same time the people that I've\nseen that we're successful coming out of\nschool which is very little like it was\na really small school but most of the\npeople who did well we're people who put\nin a lot of work outside of class like\nmost of their creative endeavors were\ndone outside of class and for me like I\nspent most of my time outside of class\njust playing games yeah yeah yeah so I\nthink that's the divergence right and so\nwhen did you decide that like your your\neggs were like that\nwhen did you feel like the boat sailed\nI think towards the end of it like\ntowards the end us will not listen\nreally like at the end but it was like\noh like okay like we're finishing up now\nthere are some people who kind of like\nwell like I'm looking at my peers and\nit's like oh these people are so much\nmore like equipped they're more practice\nthey've done more than I have and I just\nplay games all day so like in my I guess\na part of my mind wanted to conflate\nlike playing games as like doing work\nbecause\nI don't know but no this is not really\nthe case that's not how it works yeah so\nso and you finished college and then you\nthought like it's over well I had like I\nhad sort of like an internship and I\ndidn't really do a lot like there's a\npart of my mind that's like I'm not\nreally like doing a lot of work here and\nI'm not like this isn't what I imagined\nmy life to be like okay but actually\nwell the other thing that happened to\nsays I live in Hawaii I went to school\nin the mainland so I ended up moving\nback home with my parents and I feel\nlike that kind of like you know like\nmaybe if I stayed in the mainland like I\nstill would have been able to be around\nlike my peers and I could have like\nworked with them and stuff like that but\nlike moving to like we think that come\nkind of like killed it like I did part\nof the internship online but it was just\nnever really I kind of fell off like I\nfeel like I'm onto that cuz just wasn't\nit didn't feel like it was going\nanywhere right wasn't like I wasn't I\nwasn't being like challenged or\ninterested by the work like I didn't\nreally like didn't really gel with me\nand and\nokay.i Andrew I'm gonna just need a\nsecond to like recalibrate because I\nstill can't escape from this thought\nthat like this is just weird to me okay\nbecause this is a real real weird dream\num so so so I think that I'm not blame\nI'm please don't feel blamed I'm I'm\njust trying to help you think about so I\nhave lots of things that I can say that\nI feel like are somewhat generic right\nso we can explore for example what it's\nlike to move back what it's like to you\nknow how do you start moving forward why\ndid you feel like it didn't gel with you\nthere are all these kinds of questions\nthat I could ask yeah right I feel like\nI could answer Holden - yeah yeah and\nthat's I think the problem because I I\nthink I think there's there's something\nhere that I feel like we're moving\naround that you're not willing to say\nokay I feel like there's something here\nit's like you have all of those answers\nand that's not where the money is then\nand the money isn't in the answers you\nhave it's in the answers that you don't\nhave okay and and there's just some\nthere's just some weird theme about and\nlike the other thing is like you're\ncreating this weird kind of like you're\nbaiting me like that's what it feels\nlike I'm not blaming you for this but\nlike you're giving me all this like\npsychologically juicy [ __ ] like I am the\nMufasa and I'm the scar right but I I\ndon't like that's true but and you kind\nof you keep on accepting responsibility\nfor your situation which sounds super\nhealthy right you're saying like oh yeah\nI could have done more I could have done\nmore I could have done done more great\nand you're saying that I think that\nmakes sense so like maybe this is just\nlike maybe I'm just I just got off on\nthe wrong track is that happens I'm not\nperfect I'm not psychic I know people\nthink I am sometimes I'm just [ __ ]\nwrong but to me it feels like there's\nsomething here like do you\nhas someone has someone taken something\naway from you like even before all this\nCollege stuff like I know it's a\ngenerator of course people have taken\nthings away from you but it's something\ndoes something in your mind like pop out\nwhen I ask you that question\nI think my mom loves it okay yeah\nwhat did she take away from you um I\ndon't know if she took anything away for\nme necessarily but maybe like so growing\nup I did play a lot of video games and\neven as like in like middle school in\nhigh school like I definitely like like\nI did okay in school but I ended up\nplaying a lot of games and I think that\nkind of like detracted from like other\nparts of my life and I remembered like\nthere are times in my life were like I\nwas playing lots of games no my mom\nwould tell me like oh like you're only\ngonna be good at games and stuff like\nthat like all you can be was like you\njust sit around play on the computer\nholy [ __ ] yeah what did she take away\nfrom you I don't know what she took away\nlike my ability to like to do other\nthings\nabso-fucking-lutely just think about\nthat for a second yeah so I feel like\nI've known this yeah yeah go ahead good\nno keep going I feel like I've known\nthis and I feel like like maybe like\nlike the 25 year-old Landry kind of\nknows this but maybe like the younger\nAndrew he's kind of like you still hurt\nso some start right what's been doing\ntheir homework yeah so tell me about the\nyounger Andrew uh I feel like he is kind\nof hurt he's really hurt by that and you\nknow it's kind of weird it's like well\nlike I like to play video games and\nmaybe I do play too much but it's like\nwell now I'm hurt so now that I'm her\nI'm gonna play more videos\nso what were your choices to major in\ncollege um well actually it was a it was\nspecifically for game design like I\nunderstand that yeah\nno choices like okay yeah like like so\nso like this is the thing right so you\nhave this idea that you've got like one\noption in life yeah right where did you\nget that idea\nit's probably like when I was younger\nlike for my mom right but it's kind of\nweird cuz it's like I always like video\ngames but then I guess something got in\nmy head like I can only do video games\nyeah right so I'm just gonna jump in for\na second so thanks for the raid a theme\nlive well we really appreciate it\nand so we're gonna pick up in a second\nAndrew cuz I just got to think about\nthis and I'm just gonna introduce people\nto what this is so this is the healthy\ngamer dot GG stream I am a psychiatrist\npracticing in Boston Massachusetts this\nis a stream all about sort of helping\npeople understand themselves why they\nfeel stuck helping them kind of think\nabout how to move forward so we're\ntalking with Andrew and Andrew feels\nlike he's sort of I would describe your\nsituation Andrew is something that I'd\ncall failure to launch I really like\nthat yeah yeah right so like look\nfailure to launch is like everything set\nup like everyone's on board the plane is\nis fueled and just something happens and\nthe plane just can't get off the ground\nyes and so I think we're actually\ndealing with two separate things here\nshould one is the failure to launch\nwhich is like why hasn't your video game\ncourier picked up why don't you really\nwant to make video games because I don't\nthink you want to make video games like\nyou haven't we've asked you what you\nwant and it's always been like oh like I\nlike video games so let me make this my\ncareer but I did the real devastating\nthing is that actually maybe what you\nwant and this kind of goes back to\nconfusing what you want with what you\nthink you're capable of maybe what you\nwant is something else but somewhere\nalong the lines somewhere along the way\nand you got convinced\nthat the only thing you can possibly be\ngood at is videogames sounds right and\nso if we want to help you move forward I\ndon't think we want to and this is we're\nnot you know I'm sorry if I was like\nlike I'm just not excited about the\ncollege and the inability to find a job\nin the video game industry that just\nfeels in me like it's like a red herring\neven though it's soon or not it it sucks\nbecause it's like three years of my life\nbut yeah right so then we also have an\nelement of like grief because you in a\nsense corner quote wasted your time\nwhich I don't think you did but we'll\nget to that okay but I think now the\nquestion becomes like you know what is\nit that when you did you have any idea\nof like what you wanted like when your\nmom told you that how old were you by\nthe way oh well those happen a lot it\nhappened a lot yeah well I feel like it\nhappened on it and how did she make you\nfeel I mean it kind of hurt but I feel\nlike I was just kind of able to ignore\nit because it's you know it's happening\nit's happening when I'm playing my game\nso it's like okay like just show like\nI'm trying to focus like yeah yeah and\nwhat happens to feelings that you ignore\nAndrew oh they don't they stay right\nthere I mean what are they they'll come\nup later yes and in what way so what\nwhat is the feeling that she's creating\nyou are in you every time she says that\nto you I mean it's like her I don't\nreally know like what the feeling is\nyeah so it hurts to have your mom say\nthat and what does it make you start to\nbelieve about yourself like maybe she's\nright and if she's right what does that\nmean she's right about what and I'm\nscrewed only do video games yeah that\nI'm screwed because it's like the only\nthing that I can do is a thing that I\nlike to do yes right and also they do\nscrewed yeah so I think part of the\nreason like why are you stuck right now\ninjury\nbecause I'd never know what to do I feel\nlike that's half of it yeah okay like I\nfeel like anything that I would do won't\nturn out well exactly yep so this is\nimportant to understand it's not that\nyou don't know what to do\nit's that doing anything is futile yeah\nlike I feel like I've tried to like kind\nof pick up other things but it never\nreally like never really panned out or\ncaught my interest or is anyone ever\nable to like say like Oh like I could\nsee this as a replacement for like doing\nvideo games\nabsolutely and so you say this is all\nsurface level language right like it\nnever panned out no I think the problem\nwas that you never gave it a fair shot\nbecause in your heart of hearts you\nnever knew it would succeed yeah I feel\nlike there are times that like maybe I\ndid kind of give them I'll but those are\nlike wait I'm just trying to like it\nnever lasts you know like yes because\nthat so this is important to understand\nyou can use willpower to temporarily\novercome like your internal\npsychological stuff but as long as that\ncore belief that you're just not gonna\nsucceed is there you're only gonna get\nlike spurts of activity you're not gonna\nbe able to create anything sustained so\nif you want to do something in life you\nhave to believe in yourself right like\nyou have to believe that this could go\nsomewhere like you can force yourself to\ndo anything for a short amount of time\nright but like if you really want this\nsustained so what I'm hearing from you\nis that you have no sustained momentum\nyeah you're not you're not a fire you're\na firework sure like a small if I ever\nget that - there we go right wait a\nlittle sparkler what is that what does\nthat statement tell you about yourself\nput yourself in my shoes what do I think\nabout you when you insist on telling me\nthat you're a small firework or sparkler\nlike like this guy's not gonna go dear\nin life that's what you think about you\nall right Wendy what do you think about\nme I think that that's a guy who\nbelieves he's not gonna go anywhere in\nlife that is correct\nyeah sorry what's the what's the\nquestion yeah yeah that's fine okay okay\nconfusing question sorry\nbut yeah I think you're absolutely right\nso like so you're like some somewhere in\nyour mind like do you see that like you\ncan't even sit with a random ass analogy\nlike you have to correct me you have to\nlet yourself and me and the rest of the\nworld know that you're not gonna amount\nto anything okay that's harsh but yeah\nbut that's what you're saying like\nyou're tell--you're correcting me okay I\nwish had to see my face right now I wish\nI could - how do you feel I mean hearing\nit I mean there's like there's like a\nsense of sadness but it doesn't like\nit's not like anything new it's not like\nnew information to me there's a sense of\nsadness what else is there like\nhopelessness yeah right so I think this\nis the problem I mean I don't think it's\nabout not knowing what you can do I\nthink it's just like you don't think so\nthis is something you got to understand\nabout yourself Andrew your brain is like\nvery good and your brain is not gonna\nwaste time doing things that it doesn't\nthink are worth it okay right like\nyou're not gonna like your brain is not\ngonna let you wake up tomorrow and start\npainting for six hours a day for the\nnext five years if it doesn't believe\nthat you can be a good painter right\nand so I think this comes back to like\nyou're just you have some fundamental\nsense that you're not able to accomplish\nyour not able to succeed yeah and this\nis pervasive it's like you know the\nfirework I think is a really good\nexample because you're kind of saying\nlike it's not even a big firework it's a\nsmall firework it's a sparkler your\nfaith in yourself is just is completely\nlike it's like you believe you're\ncapable of little little things okay\nhow long have you felt that way about\nyourself it probably started her own\ncollege like I feel like in like before\ncollege like in high school and when I\nwas younger like I feel like I could do\nthose things but the only thing that I\nwanted to do was to play video games\nokay and I feel like I did it okay job\nat that yeah right so it sort of makes\nsense why you gravitate towards video\ngames because you have this belief about\nyourself and there's one thing that's\nyour beacon of hope right right you have\nlike one thing that like you can believe\nfor yourself\nthat you can that can be different yeah\nand so you gravitate towards it you put\nall your eggs in one basket so now\nAndrew we've got to start thinking about\nI want to sort of shift gears for a\nsecond and start thinking about like\nokay what do we do about this yes right\nso what thoughts you have about that\nlike what to do mm-hmm give any any idea\nyou don't have to I'm just wondering\nnothing like concrete like the part that\ncomes to mind so now we're gonna do a\nlittle bit education and and I'm gonna\ntell you what I think you should do okay\nokay so the first thing is that like\nbeliefs about yourself let's just think\nabout this so it's it's clear that\nyou've done your homework so you know to\nsome scara's so can you explain to our\naudience what are some scara's so I\nguess kind of like a traumatic\nexperience that you've had before in the\npast and usually when you're younger and\nyou don't really have the capacity to\nkind of like process emotionally\nabsolutely you get older right and it\njust it just sticks with you like yeah\nso I think your sense of inadequacy is\nnot of a 25 year old like the reason\nthat you feel the way that you do is\nbecause you're like a 15 year old inside\na 25 year olds body yes\nand like that disconnect is hard to deal\nwith because you don't feel 25 you feel\n15 yes are retains the age at which it\nwas formed yep okay so what forms the\nsome scar like a traumatic experience\nokay so this is an important point not\nall some scars are negative okay so so\nif I have a some scar that is positive\nwhere is that gonna come from a good\nexperience\nabsolutely so what's the common element\nbetween so it's the root of a some scar\nit's is what like you're saying on the\none hand it's a traumatic experience on\nthe other hand it's a good experience so\nit's like a powerful emotional\nexperience exactly okay so just think so\nsome scars shape your behavior right you\ndon't get to control them they're not\nlogical\nthey just exert this subtle influence in\nyour subconscious mind that shapes what\nyou do every day when you wake up like\ndo you get that you don't like every\ntime you wake up and you think about\nwhat you want to do in life there is a\npart of your there's a part of you that\nsays it doesn't matter what you do\nbecause you're gonna fail you with me\nokay yeah so there's no point in\napplying for a job there's no point in\ndoing this there's no point in trying\nthis there's no point in trying this\nbecause at the core of the problem is\nthat like you think you're gonna fail\nlike you agree with that or not I'm a\nlittle bit like I feel like I can kind\nof I can kind of do those things for a\nlittle bit and then I get to a certain\npoint and I just stop good okay so so\nthat's also accurate right because you\ncan use willpower to overcome the\ninfluence of the some scar does that\nmake sense\nyes yep for a brief period of time but\nthe some scar is there and it's active\nit's like the some scar is like uh I\ndon't know like Auto spawns bad feelings\nand like you can use some amount of like\nmanna to like lightning bolt whatever\n[ __ ] it is popping out but at some point\nyou're gonna run out of man and it'll\ncontinue like spawning like [ __ ] in your\nlife yeah so like you're just gonna run\nout of mana if you use willpower so we\ngot to do is we got to like destroy that\nlike enemy generator from like gauntlet\nwhich is probably not a game any you\nguys I played hopefully I would okay\nright so you can't you you just have to\ntake take care of the route if so you\nwant it but this is kind of a little bit\nof a tangent but I play League of\nLegends but you can use dota as you see\nlike okay great yeah okay I don't know\nhow to translate this new dude okay so\nso yeah blue Izzard is about to die\nright okay so let's just think about\nthis so if a some scar is kind of like\nautomatic and exerts its influence on\nyou like automatically and there are\ngood to some scars and negative some\nscars and good some scars form and the\nfundamental root of some scar is\nexperience what do you need to do have\ngood experiences exactly and it is that\nsimple\nit is not to have a particular\nexperience it is just to have good\nexperiences\nyeah and I are what you guys to know I'm\nsaying okay some scar is sa msk\nARA ya is the a silent is it like a\npronunciation thing it's a commission\nokay so so this is the important thing\nlike I want you guys to just think about\nthis for a second if we think about what\ninfluences your behavior it is\nexperience right that the natural\nimpulses that cause you to do things are\nformed by experience not by logic but by\nexperience if you want to change the\nperson that you are automatically so\nthat you don't have to use willpower if\nyou're a lazy [ __ ]\nlike I am and you don't want to like be\ndisciplined and you don't want to be use\nwillpower and you don't want to be a\ntry-hard you just need to have different\nexperiences so I'll give you just a\nsimple example so let's say like I go to\nuh what's that dump like let's say like\nI go to like some like seafood place\nokay okay and if I go to a seafood place\nand I get sick what happens the next\ntime someone tells me like hey let's go\neat at that seafood place I'm gonna\nprobably turn them down right and is\nthat does that require willpower no it's\nvery easy it's automatic right so\nbecause a negative experience\nautomatically shapes our behavior it I\nthink you will power to go back\nabsolutely\nnow let's say that I go to a restaurant\nand I have an amazing meal and if\nsomeone says oh like hey let's let's go\nback to that restaurant how easy is that\nin a heartbeat I'm there absolutely and\nwhy is that because I remember the\npositive experiences exactly so\nexperience is the great teacher right\nright like that's the that's the big\nthing that I want you guys to understand\nit's not about logic it's even not about\nemotion although emotion has a lot to do\nwith it in its essence Yogi's say it is\nexperience that creates change okay so I\nthink what you need to do is experience\nbecause right now what I'm hearing is\nabsent in your life is experience not\nlike a particular experience but just\nexperience in general\nlike I'm curious but I would bet money\nAndrew that if I looked at the last\nmonth of your life compared to six\nmonths ago compared to one year ago that\nthe raw nature of your experience is\nbasically the same Li sorry can you try\nthat again\nso like that basically if we think about\none year ago versus six months ago\nversus one week ago like the kinds of\nthings that you're experiencing are\nbasically the same I would say that's\npretty accurate yeah and as long as that\nas as long as that is the case your life\nis not gonna change okay because\nexperience is what creates change right\njust think about this for a second I\nmean uh because I think this is a good\nexample and I use it a lot but it leads\nto lots of live stream fails right so\nlike I was about to ask you if you've\nhad sex but I'm not gonna ask so okay\nyou know like once you have sex you have\nthis experience of sex and then it like\nreally makes you want to have more sex\nwell if it's a positive and then if\nyou're like a traumatic experience of\nsex that really makes you not want to\nhave sex yeah but like you have to have\nsex once to really get fuel to do it\nagain yeah that's true and so I think\nthe basic problem you're saying that I\nfeel stuck I don't know what I want and\nthat's because you've got no fuel in\nyour tank and so what you're trying to\ndo your mind is trying to substitute\nlike logic and plans for fuel you're\ntrying to figure out in your mind like\nokay if I try to do this or if I set\nthis up or what if I live life this way\nwhat if I live life that way but that's\nnot gonna actually motivate like you can\ncome up with and I mean I don't know why\nI think this but I think that you've\nthought a lot about like all these\ndifferent things that you could do and\nyou've even taken a couple of steps\nforward in those ways even though\nthey're all good ideas that never leads\nto anything because you're operating in\nthis like abstract area of ideas you're\njust like I could do this or I could do\nthis or I could do this let me try this\nlike let me wake up in the morning like\nI'm gonna like give it my best because\nthis sounds like a good idea but like\nyou're not getting any fuel like you're\njust it's a firework right like you need\nto stick logs in that fire and you need\nto let it burn for a while in those logs\nwere just experienced\nso what I want to know from you andrew\nis like what can you do tomorrow or\nyou're in Hawaii yeah\nso what time is it it's 11:20 a.m. right\nnow okay\nso what can you do today that is gonna\nexpand the scope of your experience\nlike something different so what is that\nthat's a great question I don't know I\ndon't know okay if I have an answer yeah\nso think about what is it available in\nyour general area that you have never\ndone before\noh man that's a great question I don't\nknow I feel like when you live in Hawaii\nthere's only so many things you can do\nI completely agree yeah and that's why\nyou turned out games cos we're\ninteresting yeah so like what is in your\ngeneral vicinity so I want you to Clark\nyeah pull up Google Maps sure and like\nlook at your general location okay I am\nlooking kind of okay and just like I\ndon't know how to I mean I don't want\nyou can use and I like my address and\nchat not in chat is send it to me over\ndiscord I'm just I'm just you're just\nyour city I can just you know my address\nyou like the FBI no just give me give me\nyour so yeah they're in discord yeah\nyeah okay there you go because we don't\nwant these people doxxing you yeah well\nif they Doc's me I get to go on a trip\nif they don't to snipe me\nhey guys hang out\nokay so I see lots of beaches yep oh so\nI see that there's a rifle range oh\nwhere are you seeing that it's like you\nlive here have you ever shot a gun a\nreal gun no okay right so like I don't\nwant you to go and shoot people yeah I\ndon't have any plans own good but I\nwould explore the rifle range because as\nsomeone who has shot guns before it is a\nvery unique experience\nokay I'm not advocating that you should\ngo out and buy a gun nor am i advocating\nthat you shoot people you should not do\nthat\nbut in terms of like they're just the\nbroad range of human experience I think\nlike shooting a gun is something that's\nvery like it's very different yes\nbecause I I also see that there's a\nthere's a gym so the other thing that\nyou could do is you could go take a\nclass at a gym that you haven't taken\nbefore if you've ever done yoga\nI have not okay great so that's probably\nhealthier than shooting a gun but I\nthink you should actually like go to\nyour agency what am I to do both\nyeah well which gym are you seeing it's\njust search for gym in your [ __ ] city\nlike there's good okay doesn't matter\nwhat yeah yeah I got pain money there\nactually you see what it is room and\nthen I stopped okay so so go do\nsomething at a gym or go find yeah yeah\noh I'll probably do the rifle range good\nthat sounds like a nice like one-off\nthing but the gym sounds like a good\ninternet cousin yes so you may want to\ncall them and figure out like you know\nwhat you need to do to go there yeah\nis there like a military base near where\nyou live um maybe there's a couple of\nthose yeah near is kind of objectives\nfor employee like if it takes more than\nlike 50 minutes it's for okay so so yeah\nso like call them up and then like go\nand do something real and then like go\ntake a yoga class which is that's that's\nyou know like let go and have an\nexperience okay okay yeah I've tried\nlooking up things on meetup but I never\nreally considered looking at Google Maps\nreally stuff to do that makes sense yeah\nokay and seriously like just be clear\nI'm not like advocating violence it's\njust never like I think he doesn't even\nneed to be a real gun have you ever\nplayed paintball I done paintball I've\ndone air riflery in high school yeah\nyeah so so I mean I think like a broad\nrange of things like I think going\nunderwater is like a wild thing you can\ndo like going skydiving is a wild thing\nyou can do like it doesn't even have to\nbe wild like going to a yoga class is\nlike a very different experience you\nknow like having an orgasm is like a\nvery different experience like watching\nan animal stumbling upon an animal in\nthe wild is like a very different\nexperience and and like these are just\ndifferent experiences right like going\nto a crawfish boil is a different\nexperience if you've never eaten sushi\nbefore having sushi is a different\nexperience if you've never played a\nvideo game before like enjoying a video\ngame is like a wildly different\nexperience like I've tried to get my mom\nto play video games for the last 20\nyears and like she finally had fun\nplaying a game can anyone guess what it\nis oh can it be dude oh yeah someone got\nit\nnope it's it's overcooked okay\neverything's great\nshe played overcooked it she liked it\nwas a riot\nnice and and so that's what I want you\nto do like I know it's like a [ __ ]\nI'm gonna get banned now because I told\nyou go to a rifle range but I'm not\nsaying [ __ ] like really like everyone\nunderstands that right I'm not and by\nthe way I mean like yeah I mean we can\ntalk a little bit about feelings of\nwanting to be violent towards other\nhuman beings because that's a big\nproblem yeah um so yeah so if I really\nwanted to get banned and I wanted to\npunish people I'd tell them to play Dark\nSouls if you have to play Dark Souls\nbefore that's another not novel\nexperience that you can get and so I\nthink like you're so so Andrew just to\nsum up so I think that like it can be\nvery hard to figure out how to move\nforward in life when you feel so stuck\nand you don't know what to do right like\nthat's where you are like you don't even\nknow where to start\nso like the instinct is to tell you like\noh if you like studied like video gaming\nlike why don't you try to break into the\nindustry and why don't you polish up\nyour resume and why don't you find an\ninternship those are all suggestions\nthat may be good suggestions but I think\nthe basic problem is that you have a\nlack of experience in life like just\nexperiencing different things and what\nyou need to do is just go out and do\nsomething like go do different things\nthey don't have to be good they don't\nhave to be bad but as you start to do\ndifferent things you are going to\ndevelop a different sense of self from\nthe one that you have now and as you\nchange your sense of self your ability\nto move in the world is going to change\nokay questions a couple actually kind of\nI don't know if this is taking some\nsteps backwards but I have an\nopportunity with my work to to do online\ncollege and I'm also I was also trying\nto look for a new job I'm wondering what\nyou think would be good like if I should\nstay with that and like it's like super\ncheap schooling\nand that's kind of a new experience but\nwhat are you thinking it it's hard it's\nlike well one hand if I go to my job if\nI stick with the job that I have now\nit's like well we're kind of suck\nsometimes but then I'd like to be going\nto school but at the same time I could\nget a new job and then like I don't know\nlike I feel like that might not be any\nreading yeah so Andrew I don't really\nknow how to advise you about whether you\nshould change your job or not because\nthat's I mean I don't know anything\nabout your life I don't know what your\nfinancial situation is I know you work\nin retail you have the opportunity to go\nto college so this is all like in your\nhead level thinking does that make sense\nlike you're doing analysis you're\nweighing projects like I don't think you\nhave a problem with that\nthat's not where your problem is yeah so\nI I don't know anything about your life\nI don't know like where you live I don't\nknow how much your rent is I don't know\nif you're somebody doesn't know where\nyou live now yeah yeah I mean I don't\nknow like what your living situation is\nwhether you live it alone whether you\nlive with roommates whether you live at\nhome I don't know I mean all of those\nlike those are the kinds of things that\nweigh into a decision like this I think\nthe way that you need to start is by\nlike so you can figure out whatever that\ndecision is but frankly Andrew I think\nyou spent too much time thinking about\nthat stuff because that's not you've\nbeen thinking about that kind of [ __ ]\nall four years and it's like hasn't\ngotten you anywhere you know like you\nneed to just go out and like do\nsomething like if there's there's an\nanimal shelter like go and volunteer do\nyou have a pet no okay so like fine like\nis are there animal shelters nearby now\nyou think there might be so like go out\nand like volunteer at an animal shelter\nokay spend time with like animals it's\nlike crazy it's fun and will make you\nfeel different about yourself yeah we\nused to have a dog in the dog died and\nit's like that's it we're done with that\nSarah okay sorry to do that that's okay\nI just I don't know I think like there\nare a lot more details that are involved\nin terms of answering that question so\nI'm sorry okay really like giving like I\nI don't that's this way okay questions\nyeah how does one go about getting\ntherapy great\nokay so let's talk about therapy yeah so\nI think it is a good idea if you feel\ndepressed or sad or especially like\nsuicidal because that's been cropping up\nfrom time to time one or discord you\nshould definitely get therapy like so\nyou should go and get a mentor in fact I\nthink everyone should get like a mental\nhealth evaluation I think it's a good\nidea to just be in a physical evaluation\nto if you haven't seen a primary care\nphysician go and see a primary care\nphysician so start there and in terms of\nfinding a therapist here's what I would\nrecommend so if you have health\ninsurance you can start depending on\nwhat your financial situation is so\nabout a third of therapists within the\nUnited States don't accept health\ninsurance if you have health insurance\nyou may have an out-of-network benefit\nand if you have an out-of-network\nbenefit they will reimburse a percentage\nof what you pay to to your therapist or\npsychiatrist so for example I see people\nmy rate is 450 an hour out of that\npatients who have good health insurance\nget reimbursed about 350 per session so\ntheir out-of-pocket cost is about $100\nper week okay so depending on what kind\nof insurance you have you'll have an\nout-of-network benefit or you won't if\nyou don't have an out-of-network benefit\nI would call your insurance company and\nask for a list of providers who accept\nyour insurance then you start googling\npeople and you start calling people and\nyou read about the therapist because\nnowadays a lot of therapists sub\nwebsites and you try to find a couple of\npeople that you like and then what you\ndo is you reach out to them and you try\nto schedule appointments and then you go\nand I would recommend that you meet with\nthree pairs Arabists and if you meet\nwith three you just pick the one that\nyou think like you enjoy meeting the\nmost like who do you like the best and I\nthink that sometimes people forget that\nlike you know you don't just buy the\nfirst car you see you go and you\ntest-drive things and you see which one\nworks for you and that's especially\nimportant for a therapist so the\ninsurance stuff aside the other thing\nthat you can do is just Google like\nthings in like therapists in your area\nor you can go to a website like\nPsychology Today or you can go to\nsomeone like rise above the disorder\nlike rad I think is a good resource they\nconnect people with therapists they'll\ninterview you and try to find a good fit\nfor you\nstuff like that so they can really help\nyou with that um and so that's I think\nthat's how you find a therapist what\nmodality and stuff they use is I think\nlike that can be important but at the\nend of the day like you're probably not\ngonna know much i mean i guess you can\nread about psychodynamic versus CBT or\nwhatever you can find something that you\nthink you're gonna like but ultimately I\nthink fit is way more important and it's\nbeen my experience that oh a lot of\ntherapists do way more than a particular\nthing like even so the person who taught\nme CBT I was really confused because I\nthought she was gonna be teaching BC BT\nbut she kept on like talking to me about\npsychodynamic stop it and it's just like\ngood therapists use like everything\nunder the Sun right make sense what do\nyou think about online therapy I mean I\ndo telepsychiatry with some people I\nthink I like meeting with people in real\nlife better but it can work okay\nI am very confused as chat you guys are\nright I don't know what anyway\nother questions does that does that make\nsense yeah like sense uh okay another\none this is like a cushion I submit it\nto the question but but since I'm here\nsure figure might as well ask it so I\nhave something relating to like I review\ntalking about it like having like Dharma\nto like different people or different\nthings in your life like it's normal\nlike a singular thing or it's like I\nhave like a Dharma to my family or have\na Dharma to like my community or haven't\nDharma to myself like how does that work\ngreat question\nI'm gonna start actually by asking a\nquestion to chat because I think I think\nyour question is good so chat I need\ny'all's help or we need y'all's help and\nyou feel free to weigh in to Andrew\nwe're trying to think about like how we\ncan help you all the best\nyes and you spent one of the things that\nI'm thinking about is like we're\nthinking about taking a step back from\njust doing interviews and like doing\nmore start-to-finish content because we\nget a lot of questions I talked a lot\nabout Dharma but it's like patchwork I\nget questions about it I interview\nsomeone about it and then sometimes\npeople like will ask and chat like\nwhat's the deal with herma so one of the\nthings that we're thinking about doing\nis like doing like a stream devoted to\nparticular topics so\nI'll do one day just talking about\nDharma from start to finish another day\nI'll talk about psychedelics which is\nlike start to finish\nI may not probably won't do an interview\nbut we'll just like do one day about\npsychedelics one day about Dharma like\nanother day about Ayurveda which people\nseem to like a lot and so do you guys\nwant us to expand beyond Q&A and\ninterviews okay so then we're gonna do\nthat okay so the next question that I\nhave for you guys is that the other\nthing that I was thinking is we start\nwith people right so we had this this\nsession with Andrew and I'm still not\nsure if this is helping or not helping\nor whether this is useful to people a\nlittle bit yeah\nso so we'll see though because I think\nyou're not gonna have a psychological\nbreakthrough that's gonna change your\nlife Andrew you like you need to go out\nand start doing [ __ ] like that's really\nJeannie okay and cuz I think it's all\nabout combating that some scar and we\ncan talk more about that but here's the\nother thing that I've been wondering so\nwe have a waiting list of people who\nwant to come on stream and at the same\ntime I'm wondering so I sometimes get\nfollow-ups from people and like I'm\nwondering if actually it would be\nhelpful for people to see for example\nAndrews journey right so he goes out and\nhe does this but then the next time we\nmeet we dig a little bit further so\nwould you guys do you guys like to see\nlike different people every week or\nwould you guys think it is better or\nmore useful just to watch someone's\njourney from start to finish\njourney okay so we're gonna do both okay\ncuz I think the main reason we haven't\nbeen doing journey is because I feel\nlike it is unfair to all of the people\nwho want to come on first a few people\nto monopolize like our time and and the\nhelp that we offer so I think we're\ngonna try to do both so we're gonna pick\na couple of people and I think reckful\nis gonna be one of them because he wants\nto come on again and then we'll try to\npick like a couple of other people and\nwe're gonna try to see because there are\na lot of challenges that come up so if\nyou guys have seen the interviews with\nthe sky so sky like DM me the other day\nand like brought up in a maze\npoint which i think is like really\nimportant but like is something that\nhappens two or three steps forward that\nlike as you start with your first\nrevelation you start with your first\ngame plan but in the progress of growth\nyou have challenges that arise and like\nthose challenges are also very common so\nSkye asked me a question and he's like I\nwas wondering if I should start changing\nmy life today or I should like pick a\ndate in the future to like start this\njourney and like that's such a beautiful\nquestion to ask because it's like so\nimportant and there's this big problem\nso people everyone says like oh you\nshould just do today you should do today\nyou should usually that's defeating the\npoint right so the purpose of the stream\nis not to give him the answer the\npurpose of the stream is to help him\nunderstand what in his mind makes him\nwant to put it off and what in his mind\nmakes him want to do it today that's\nwhat you guys have to understand there's\na part of your mind that wants to push\nthings off and where is that coming from\nand how do we understand that because\nthe solution to doing things today is\nnot just to say today is the better day\nto do it it's understanding why you want\nto push it off until tomorrow right it's\nnot about the right answer like I'm not\nhere to give you guys answers I'm here\nto help you understand like what's going\non inside you okay so we're gonna do\nlongitude like we're gonna do like more\nlongitudinal streams so we'll follow up\nwith particular people and we're\nprobably gonna do like between four and\neight weeks so apologies to the people\nthat we're not going to be getting to as\na result of that we're gonna do the best\nthat we can we're gonna continue to do\nnew people because I think that's\nimportant too yeah and okay and then\nyeah so the other thing is if you guys\nknow someone that you think should come\non stream by all means let us know and\nif you guys are members of other\ncommunities let them know too\nlike so if you guys want like so you let\nthat like cuz I don't know I mean I yes\noh so like whoever it is like you guys\nhave to help us get those people right\nso someone messaged me the other day and\nthey were like PewDiePie is taking a\nbreak from YouTube he's super stressed\nout and like PewDiePie is huge and all\nthat like I'm happy to talk to the guy\nbut like I have no way of getting\nPewDiePie to come on like I don't know\nwho all these people are ls messaged me\nand they said okay fine I don't know who\nls is like a theme rated us thank you\nfor the rate of theme you're welcome to\ncome on I don't know who that is I don't\nknow who any these people are people\nhave been talking about Mitt jones since\nday one and that's fine like I'm I think\nwe're gonna I think Mitch Jones\nI don't know I'm I can't say anything\nabout that but like so you guys tell us\nwho you want us to see and you also tell\nthem because reckful actually we didn't\nget reckful on the stream you guys got\nreckful to come on the stream so someone\nin our community said hey reckful you\nshould do this and reckful was like okay\nand it was a kind of a last minute thing\nso whoever you guys want to come on you\njust let me know and you let them know\nand we'll make it happen and we're\ndefinitely gonna reserve time for pardon\nme for saying this but like the people\nwho aren't big streamers right like\nthat's fine it's not this isn't like a\nlike celebrity psychoanalysis stream\nthis is just a helping regular people\nstream and like everyone is a regular\nperson in my book okay so you guys let\nus know who you want so lemme just hear\na like so a couple of takeaways so the\nfirst is that you guys want to see more\ncontent streams so I'm not gonna\ninterview someone I'm just gonna get up\nhere and I'm gonna [ __ ] talk at you\nfor like 45 minutes which I feel we're\ndoing but I'll do the second thing is\nwe're gonna do more like fall ops with\npeople and follow someone's journey from\nlike start to finish I don't know about\nfinish because I don't know but we're\ngonna follow people over time and we'll\nsee how that goes and the third thing is\nthat if you guys want someone else to\ncome on\nI'm happy to and then y'all let me know\nhow to make that happen cuz I'm a boomer\nright I claim boomer I claim boomer who\nis LSI don't know okay\nnow getting back to so so this is the\nthing you guys are telling me to ask\nthis person to ask this I don't know who\nany of these people are you guys need to\nask these people like [ __ ] like\nsomeone here is telling me that I need\nto be streaming more you guys have to\nunderstand this I have a limited amount\nof time in my day and if I'm asking\npeople to come on stream that is like\ntime that I'm not spending actually\nstreaming it sounds like I need be\nstreaming more not streaming less so if\na theme great lazy dog absolutely hey\nlet's be clear I never claimed to not be\nlazy okay okay so let's get back to poor\nAndrew who has been waiting patiently\nfor an answer to his question and let's\ntalk for a second about Dharma okay so\nthe karma is the Sanskrit word for duty\nor responsibility and it is my belief\nthat like living in accordance with your\nDharma gives you an immense amount of\nstrength to tolerate the difficult parts\nof life and so if you don't feel like\ndoing something like doing your daughter\nlike Dharma is what lets you like give\nyou the strength to tolerate the bad\nstuff so class I mean not classic but\nlike one example that I use is like if\nI'm working in the emergency room and\nsome guy comes in with like a heart\nattack like or actually let me give you\nguys a real example that happened to me\nso that's happened too but so when I was\ninterviewing for residency before I was\neven a doctor I was a fourth-year\nmedical student and I was flying all\nover the country to do interviews I was\non a flight where the dreaded thing that\nall doctors dread happens which is that\nsomeone said is there a doctor on board\nthere's someone one of the passengers is\nhaving a problem so I'm a fourth-year\nmedical student I'm not even a doctor\nand so I kind of wait and I'm like let's\nsee if there's a doctor on board and\nthen like about 60 seconds later the\nannouncement happens again and no one\nsays anything\nand then I'm like well [ __ ] like I'm not\ntechnically a doctor I'm terrified right\nbecause I don't actually know how to\nsave anyone's life but I may be the most\nknowledgeable person on the plane like\nI'm a medical student and so like what\nshould I do\nlike I'm afraid that I'm gonna kill\nsomeone I'm afraid that I'm like I'm\nfeeling anxious I'm feeling scared and\nwhat do you think I want to do Andrew\nsince we still have you on let's use\nwhat do you want to do yeah what do you\nwant act was you want to help the person\nyeah but what do you I want to do\nsomething more which is not do anything\nokay right yeah all right there's a part\nof you that wants to help live in a part\nof you that wants to do nothing right\nabsolutely which part do you think is\nstronger the part that doesn't wanna do\nanything absolutely I just want to stay\nquiet and I want to pretend this never\nhappened\nlet the guy die so what is my Dharma\nwhat is my duty or responsibility in\nthat moment Andrew Tigers help the\nperson absolutely right and so the more\nthat I orient towards that the more its\nI'm able to deal with my negative\nfeelings because when you sit with\nnegative feelings this is important when\nyou sit with negative feelings the\nnegative feelings control you right like\nthis is gonna sound really weird but\nwhen you're in your negative feelings\nand you're fighting against yourself\nyour negative feelings control what you\ndo does that make sense\nyeah but when you incorporate someone\nelse when you start acting for other\npeople like you become less important\ndoes that make sense yeah it's like you\nlike I've been able to kind of dump does\nthat work - it helps and and then like\nthe less important you become in the\nequation then it doesn't matter what\nkind of [ __ ] you're dealing with what\nyour some scars are whether you have\nanxiety or whatever like it becomes\nabout the other person and then you have\nthe strength to act it's almost like a\nhack\nit's like Dharma's like a hack to let\nyou overcome the [ __ ] that goes on\nwithin you because in that moment like\nit doesn't [ __ ] matter what I what\nfear I feel like this guy could be done\nand I may be a medical student I may be\nit like I may be incompetent I don't\nknow how to save lives I don't know what\nto do\nbut like I'm it\nso what do you think happened Andrew any\nidea uh I I'm hoping that you save the\nguy yeah so I muster up my courage I\nthink about my Dharma I hit the call\nbell flight attendant comes over he\ngrabs me and I say you know I just want\nto say like I I may be able to help I'm\na fourth-year medical student so I'm\ngonna graduate in a couple of months but\nI'm not actually a doctor but I'm happy\nto try to help with what I can\nso she says please come with me sir we\ngo back to the airplane I see a guy on\nthe floor and next to him I see an older\ndude who's kneeling over and I\nintroduced myself and the guy says oh\nlike thanks for showing up I'm glad\nyou're a medical student you can go back\nto your seat I'm a cardiologist and this\nguy's going to be fine he's having a\npanic attack\ngreat\nturns out there was a [ __ ] doctor on\nthe plane and like their wires were\ncrossed and I was like oh my god almost\ndied but you didn't but you went up you\nwent up and you stepped up which is just\nright yeah right and like that's that's\nwhat karma is about Dharma is about like\nthat thing within you that helps you\ncombat that fever that helps you\novercome it in the fear is there it\ndoesn't go away we don't numb it that's\nwhat video games do that's what drugs do\nthey make it go away so what I want you\nguys to do is I don't want to take away\nyour fear I don't want to take away your\nanxiety I don't want to take away your\nsadness I don't want to take away your\ndepression I don't want to take away\nyour shame what I want to do is help you\nlive the life that you want to in spite\nof those [ __ ] things right like\nthat's what life is about it's not about\ntaking away that [ __ ] it's about like\nliving a life where you can do the\nthings that you need to do and want to\ndo in spite of that [ __ ] and that's what\nthe autumn uh lets you do\nso Andrews question do you have to harm\nus to multiple people absolutely right\nso you so this is what what I think is\nfun about the Mahabharat so this is a\nstory about like karmic conflict so that\nyou have Dharma's to different people\nand sometimes those Dharma's like\nconflict and how do you resolve the\ndifferent thermals that you have to\ndifferent people and so for example you\nknow if you're if you're you know I\ndon't know how what to say but like you\nknow you mate you have a certain\ntournament to your parents and sometimes\nthat conflicts with your Dharma to\nyourself yes you have a Dharma to you\nknow maybe your boyfriend or girlfriend\nand that can sometimes conflict with\nyour Dharma to yourself you have a\nDharma to yourself that can conflict\nwith Dharma to your family I mean to\nyour job or your boss and I think like\nthis is where a lot of people get bent\nout of shape because they don't live in\naccordance with their Dharma they try to\nmake their family happy and you can't\nmake your family happy but you can do\nyour duty to them right and this is\nwhere a lot of people get bent out of\nshape because they try to make their\nparents proud you can't make your\nparents proud you can just do the most\nthat you can to make them proud and\nwhether they feel proud or not is up to\nthem so there's a lot of strength in\nDharma too because there's a lot of\nsurrender in Dharma so like now Andrew\nyou have a Dharma to go out and\nexperience something that's your Dharma\nto yourself and whether your life gets\ntransformed or not like that's not\nsomething you can control and I know\npeople come on the stream thinking that\nI'm gonna transform their lives guys I\ncan't [ __ ] do that it's impossible\nlike literally think about this you\ncan't talk to a guy on twitch for an\nhour and your life be transformed it's\njust not going to happen but you do have\na tournament to yourself and that\nthermos\nto go out and experience something go to\nyoga class or a shooting range no\ntrouble okay but I don't advocate gun\nviolence in any way just against targets\nright yeah so you have a dharma to\nyourself and this is like really\nimportant because I think most people\nthat I talk to on stream and like gamers\nor human beings in general the Dharma\nthat they fail the most is actually the\nDharma to themselves just think about\nthat like like you'll do amazing things\nfor other people like if your friend is\nsick you'll make them chicken noodle\nsoup and you'll like take them something\nthat's healthy and nutritious and tasty\nbut you won't make healthy and\nnutritious and tasty food for yourself\nyou'll do it for them but you won't do\nit for yourself and that's a [ __ ]\nproblem like the biggest person that\nyou're failing in life is not your\nparents not your boss not well maybe\nyour spouse maybe your kids actually\nyeah but is to yourself right yeah other\nquestions\nAndrew or we-well I get any kind of\nexpanding on that like should I be\nholding like the Dharma to myself above\nother things or how does that like\nwhat's the what's the hierarchy like I\nmean there isn't a set hierarchy and\nthat's why you need to do things like\nstudy certain texts to understand the\nnuances of Dharma so I think you just\nhave to understand like how can you do\nand I think a lot of times people\nconfuse like I said they confuse\noutcomes with doing your Dharma so I\nfind it rare that true Dharma comes into\nconflict and that usually there's like\nsome kind of karmic road which involves\nfulfilling all of your responsibilities\nokay so just like try to do everything\nthe best you can yeah and just\nunderstand like what target you're\nsetting because your target shouldn't be\na particular thing happening it should\nbe a particular Dharma like I'm doing\nthis I'm doing X thing for X reason and\nnot worry yeah okay right so like I\ndon't know like what kind of conflict do\nyou mean but you know rarely does it\nactually come into conflict\nokay in my experience just you just need\nto think through it and and talk through\nit oftentimes it seems like it comes\ninto conflict but the more that you\nreflect on it the more you can find that\nmiddle road can it can it be a kind of\nspecific done sure feels kind of weird\nbut it's like a part of me like wants to\nstay at my job because I feel like I\nhave a responsibility to my co-workers\nbut at the same time I have a\nresponsibility to myself to kind of like\nseek better appointment so what is your\nresponsibility to your coworkers I know\nthey just kind of feel like like I feel\nlike that they've helped me a lot and I\nadd value to like what they do what does\nthat mean you add value to what they do\nuh or like like I feel like part of a\nteam like I feel like part of a family\nlike I really like like the people that\nI work with okay\nso what is your paramount to your\nco-workers wait to help them in one way\nto show up to work and do my job okay so\nif you don't show up and do your job\nwhat happens to your coworkers uh well\nit kind of sucks more for them because\nthen they have more stuff to do okay\nlike that's not your Dharma yeah so that\nsounds like a failure of Dharma on your\nboss's part does that mean can you try\nthat over time yes so like it's not your\nresponsibility to ensure that your\nco-workers are not overworked okay\ndoes that make sense yeah so that can\nfeel different from feeling like you owe\nthem so you have a Dharma to them if\nthey've done something good for you you\nhave a Dharma to do something good for\nthem so that's just a conversation it's\nlike hey guys I'm quitting but I really\nappreciate when you did X Y & Z and if\nyou all need help down the right and\nroad if you like need help moving or\nwhatever like let me know I'm happy to\nhelp you out you can do Dharma to those\nindividuals yeah but like making their\njob easy is not your Dharma this is\nexactly what I mean like Dharma's pretty\nsim\nit's your boss's thumb but to make sure\nthat their employees have manageable\nexperiences\nthat's the therm of a boss it's not the\nthermal of a co-worker okay yeah the\nkind of puts it into perspective right\nlike it's not your a job to make sure\nyour co-workers have a good experience\nthat's the boss's job yeah like that's\nthe role of a boss like that's the\nDharma of a boss if I employ people it's\nmy job to make sure that they don't get\noverworked it's my job to make sure that\nthey don't that they feel fulfilled it's\nmy job that they feel that that that\nthey feel like they're growing as human\nbeings and like they have a certain\nbasic trauma to treat you treat each\nother with respect but you don't control\nlike the work environment and the\nworkloads of your coworkers that's not\nyour Dharma okay that can be hard to\naccept but to me it's pretty simple like\nyou're taking responsibility for things\nthat are not yours that's not your\nresponsibility that makes sense\nokay okay uh I guess okay yeah I mean I\ndon't know how much more time that you\nhave but well I'd like to get to other\nquestions but if you have like like if\nyou have like a clarifying question or\nyou don't understand by all means ask no\nI think I think that's good I think I\ngot it okay awesome and thanks for\ncoming on Andrew strong work today all\nright and you know try to make peace\nwith your inner scar because remember\nguys there there are some battles that\nyou can't win because those are the\nbattles that you play against you fight\nagainst yourself\nthat's a game you can't win when you're\nplaying against yourself so don't do it\nokay good luck Andrew and check in with\nus by the way like I do a bad job of\nlike not following or not mentioning\nthis on stream but I don't know if you\nguys remember we had someone on a couple\nweeks ago or maybe a month ago we were\nlike telling them to make food and they\nlike made some kind of stew it was\namazing I don't even remember who they\nare\nJoro took a walk yeah I forget who who\nit is but anyway so people are actually\ndoing stuff you guys remember Joro he's\nlike taking walks and [ __ ] so that's\ngood oh I get I guess real quick I said\nokay after I take my yoga class and go\nshooting guns like what I do after that\nwhat's next message me we'll figure it\nout okay continue doing things yeah okay\nokay all right sounds good gizmo right\ngizmo made the stew she made some bacon\nand vegetable stew it looked good mm-hmm\nall right take care Andrew okay thanks\nright"
