    "video_title": "Should You Question Your Perception? @destiny",
    "transcript": "human beings generally speaking do not\nquestion their perception their\nperception is very atrophied or\nunderdeveloped can you be a little bit\nmore when you say perception do you mean\nlike how we introspect on ourselves um\nhow we understand how other people are\nthink feeling yeah go ahead literally\nhow we perceive so so there's a great\nyogic concept called glisha glisha means\ncoloring so if you look at the way that\nyou interact with the world the world is\nlike objective but then your mind adds\nsome color to what you see or what you\nperceive if I text you and you don't\ntext me back within 10 minutes the fact\nof the matter is that you haven't texted\nme back in 10 minutes but then what\nhappens is my mind attaches a\nsignificance to that yeah and what\nhappens on the Internet is that we're\nreacting to all of this stuff like\ntweets or whatever so we judge something\nwhen we say this person is bad because I\nsee their tweet what we don't pay\nattention to is what is all the\nambiguity that my mind fills in which is\nactually a lot especially on places like\nTwitter"
