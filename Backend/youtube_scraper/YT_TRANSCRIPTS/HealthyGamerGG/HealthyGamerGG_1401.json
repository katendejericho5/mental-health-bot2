    "transcript": "I used to have a passion competitive\ngaming and I can't really transition\nthat into anything in real life trying\nto find my thermo doesn't really work\nfor me because I don't feel like I care\nabout anything else\nwhat can I do great question okay so I'm\ngonna tell you guys a story about Tyra\nmine a little bit and then because\neveryone's wondering how do you find\nyour Dharma okay so I think that the\nproblem is that your options to\ntransition and real life are\ninsufficient they're like to low level\nso generally speaking when people are\ncompetitive in gaming they tend to be\nvery skilled they're very dedicated very\nintelligent and their options in the\nreal world don't actually like challenge\nthem sufficiently so I think that the\nbiggest thing the first thing that you\nshould do is try to find the hardest\nthing that you can do in real life like\ndon't just get a job I mean if you need\nto get a job bagging groceries like get\na job bagging groceries but I would say\nlike you know likes like there are all\nkinds of certifications and stuff that\nyou can get now so I'd say like get\nGoogle Analytics like certified like at\nGoogle Analytics SEO certified or\nsomething like that you have to decide\nwhat it is for you but find something\nthat's actually difficult and actually\nengaging you know like there may be like\nyou may be able to find like one of\nthese like day trading sweatshops like\ngo hang out there go like see what those\npeople are doing go challenge yourself I\ndon't know where you are but if there\nare any startups in the area like reach\nout to startups and say like hey are you\nguys looking for an intern go and do\nsomething that actually challenges you\nand don't worry so much about finding\nyour autonomy right now like it's this\nis also you know we were talking to sky\nand sky sort of has this idea that like\nonce he loses weight then he can create\nall this content so in this person's\nquestion I used to have a passion and\ncompetitive gaming and I can't really\ntransition that into anything in real\nlife trying to find my Dharma doesn't\nreally work for me because I don't feel\nlike I care about anything else what can\nI do this person has this idea that once\nthey find their Dharma everything is\ngoing to be easy it's delaying action\nuntil the perfect set of circumstances\nwhich is something that gamers do all\nthe time right I'm gonna apply to\ncollege when I know I can get into\nHarvard and until that happens I'm not\neven apply\nright I'm gonna go to the gym this is my\nfavorite I'm gonna go to the gym once\nI'm in shape that's the best one that's\nmy favorite right I'm gonna go to the\ngym once I don't feel embarrassed to be\nthere\nbrilliant right I've thought it have you\nguys thought it it's [ __ ] crazy it's\nstupid but we all think that way we all\nthink like ok my life begins once I get\nto this point no your life begins today\nit's just a waste shittier version than\nwhat you're envisioning that's the\nproblem but that's ok so do something I\ntell this person to do something and do\nsomething challenging try to find the\nmost challenging thing that you can and\ndo that thing I think like I mean so\nGoogle and like Microsoft and a couple\nof these other companies no longer\nrequire college degrees they just want\npeople who are able to do [ __ ] and cool\nthing is like we live in this world I\nknow I'm a Boomer so this may be news to\nme like apparently all you kids know\nabout this thing called the Internet and\nyou can learn all kinds of stuff on the\ninternet like you can learn finance you\ncan learn economics you can even learn a\nlot of medicine you can learn a lot on\nthe Internet you can learn marketing you\ncan actually like actually do this thing\nwhere you just make this thing called a\nwebsite and then you can learn some\nskill and you can start charging people\nfor the skill you can just make it like\nyou can just learn something and create\na business there are all these kids\nnowadays that are like entrepreneurs\nlike back in my day being an\nentrepreneur involved like brick and\nmortar and building something and having\ntrucks and workers but all these kids\nnowadays they're just like making tens\nof thousands or hundreds of thousands of\ndollars without any professional\ntraining like there's one guy that I\nworked with like Believe It or Not who\nwould sell figurines on eBay after\npainting them and made like 5 grand a\nmonth just [ __ ] selling figurines he\nbuys them paints them and sells them\nlike that's crazy so start doing\nsomething\nand try to do the most challenging thing\nthat you can right now I'm trying to\ntransition it so next question right now\nI'm trying to transition out of gaming\nso I'm just kind of curious about this\nokay\n[Music]\nyes so like I'm seeing I'm just looking\nat I just did a search for like\nWarhammer\nand there's like there's three adept\ndisgusto DS Verta spray ders which are\nselling for $80 I don't even know what\nthat is but the three figurines that are\nselling for a hundred bucks like I'm not\nsaying it's like a lucrative market it\nmay have like you know evened out in\nterms of supply and demand but like you\ncan make money in all kinds of ways okay\ngoing on to question four\nokay so right now I'm trying to\ntransition out of gaming into learning\nmarketing so I can actually make money\non my own perfect so this person is like\nthis is great whoever's cueing these\nquestions up because this person is one\nstep after the last person I've kind of\nstruggled with this problem my whole\nlife but I basically really get really\ninto something for a few months to a\nyear and then I stopped caring and\nlosing and lose motivation I don't\nreally like the idea of relying on\nmotivation because motivation doesn't\nhave to be the only factor in taking\naction but I don't know why I always\nhave this pattern of getting good at\nsomething but before I master it or get\nsuper good at it I lose interest I'm not\nsure if it is a fear of failure or what\nbut I would seriously love your thoughts\non this because it's been a problem for\nme for awhile I've had this happen in\ngames too where I get a really high\nlevel close to low tier Pro and then\nlose interest this is a fantastic\nquestion I'm just going to think for a\nsecond about the answer\nokay so there are two there are two\nlayers of answers to this question\none is why it happens right so if we are\nif we start to ask the question of why\ndoes this happen and then we can\nunderstand the root of it and we can\nsort of dissolve it as its root the\nsecond is like how to deal with it on a\npractical level\nso in today's interview we talked some\nabout like you know weight loss and\nstuff like that we ended with like\npractical stuff because I think you have\nto practically do something so the first\nproblem that this person has I think is\na problem of what I call orbit so the\nproblem is that his motivation he's\nrelying on he or she is relying on\nmotivation to be the primary thing that\nkeeps them on track and they've noticed\nthere it's good they're reflecting and\nthey've noticed that their motivation is\nnaturally fueled for a while and then\ngets like like fizzles out so this is\nvery important so I think that the orbit\nthat you surround yourself with is very\nimportant for sustaining motivation the\nsimplest way to create and sustain\nmotivation is by orbit so like what are\nyou orbiting around what are you\nspinning around who's in your orbit and\nwhose orbit are you in what is your\ncommunity so in meditation there's a\nsaying that one of the crucial things\nthat you need to succeed in meditation\nis something called Sangha si ng H a and\nSangha means community and they say that\nlike successes or spiritual growth\nrequires community which is kind of\nweird because like spiritual like\nmeditating is like a solo practice right\nit's a single-player game so why on\nearth do you need a community if you're\nlike playing a single-player game and\nthe simple truth is that like if you're\nmeditating all by yourself over time\nyou're gonna fizzle out but if you go to\nlectures if you go to talks if you go to\nsits now that anchors you to continue\nmoving forward on your path because\npeople around you are doing it my\nfavorite example of this is something\ncalled NaNoWriMo which is National Novel\nWriting Month so in the month of\nNovember there's this thing called\nNaNoWriMo which is National Novel\nWriting Month\nwe're a bunch of people who want to\nwrite novels and never have gotten\naround to it decide that they're gonna\nget together and write a novel in 30\ndays so what these people do is they set\nup like things all over the world where\nlike you go to your city and people in\nyour city who also want to write novels\nget together at random places at random\ntimes so they like build up a schedule\nsomeone says like you guys can come over\nto my house I'll be here from 5:00 p.m.\nto midnight anyone who wants to come can\ncome and write we're gonna be at this\nlibrary we're gonna meet at this coffee\nshop and then like a bunch of people who\nhave wanted to write novels the entire\nyear actually managed to write a lot\nduring NaNoWriMo why is that it's\nbecause their orbit changes in terms of\nmy spiritual growth like I didn't start\nby like meditating at home like I didn't\ndo that I went to an ashram where I was\nsurrounded by people who were there to\nmeditate and for 90 days every day there\nwere like structured meditations so it's\nnot habit it's not motivation it's\n[ __ ] structure structure structure\nstructure and when you think about like\nso when this person says I've been I've\nbeen learning marketing my question\nwould be who are you hanging out with\nbecause eight months into this when your\nmotivation fizzles if you're surrounded\nby people who are still interested in it\nthey're gonna pull you back in\nso if you think about even addictions so\nwhat is the most successful alcohol\ntreatment to date is Alcoholics\nAnonymous more people have quit alcohol\nthrough Alcoholics Anonymous than\nanything else\nway more than doctors therapists\nmedication actually may be the most\nsuccessful thing is quitting it on your\nown but there's not good date about that\nin terms of interventions AAA is the\nbest thing and so a is whole thing is\nabout Sangha community so my first point\nto this person is that it you have to\nunderstand that motivation is going to\nwane and what you need to cultivate is a\ncommunity who are you hanging out with\nright I think that's the problem I would\nguess that this person is not hanging\nout with people who continue to push\nthem and inspire them to be better and\nso you're thinking about like why is it\nso easy to like continue to play dota\nit's because all the [ __ ] people on\nmy friends list play dota and so when I\nlog on like they're playing dota and\nthen I feel like playing dota if no one\nhonor my friends let's play DotA like if\nit had if I didn't have anyone to play\ndota with I wouldn't play DotA like\nnearly as much right think about that\nfor a second and I don't know if gaming\ndevelopers like did this on purpose but\nthey recognized at some point that\ngiving you a feature to create a\ncommunity online will keep you playing\nthe game and I don't think it's like\nabout addiction I think it's just about\nlike that's how human beings work when\nwe have a community that drives us to do\nsomething we're gonna do more of it so I\nthink the first thing if your motivation\nwanes over time is to think about how\nmuch of your motivation is like soullow\ndriven are you being inspired and pushed\nby the people around you and if not then\nthat's your problem so the simplest\nthing you can do rather than getting to\nthe root of your problem and all this\nkind of [ __ ] that I do on stream the\nquick-and-dirty is like create a\ncommunity that supports you join a\ncommunity that supports you that's what\nactually I mean our whole bit like model\nour business model or model in healthy\ngamer business is weird because we're\nnot really making money but is to like\ncreate a community for gamers right it's\nlike we that's why we have a discord\nlike\nI think that this helps like watching me\nstream randomly once is fine but when\nyou guys come back and you're with other\npeople like think about what we're doing\nand why this stream is helpful it's\nbecause there's a community it's because\nyou're not going alone this is not you\nreading a book on your own and just like\nlistening to all my thoughts it's you\nguys come here and oh [ __ ] this person's\nquestion resonates with other people who\nare watching that's community and now\nyou guys are interested in this because\nthis person asked this question there's\na there's a benefit of like people\nworking together towards a common goal\nand so build a community for yourself\nthink about the community that you want\nto join that's the first thing orbit\nSangha so there's like a scientific\nversion of this which is orbit and then\nthere's a spiritual version of this\nwhich is sungki so this - there have\nbeen studies in terms of like\ncommunities and stuff you guys wanna\nknow about science so researcher Andy\ncoming prepare yourselves there was a\nstudy that showed like that was looking\nat factors for teen age of marijuana use\nand what do you guys think the most\nimportant factor is for teenage\nmarijuana use right it's your friends if\nyour friends smoke pot you're way more\nlikely to smoke pot it's not even social\npressure it's not peer pressure it's not\npressure it's just [ __ ] monkey see\nmonkey do\nlike when I log on to steam and my\nfriends are playing dota\nI don't feel pressure it's not like oh\nman if I don't like play dota those guys\nare gonna make fun of me it's not\npressure sometimes there's peer pressure\nsometimes there's bullying but most of\nit it's just like they're playing dota I\nlike I'll play some dota 2 like oh\nyou're smoking - Jon joint give me give\nme a hit that's that's what it is so\ncreate a community for yourself and\nyou'll be amazed at what you're capable\nof so I got lucky because like I joined\nthis community where I peers and\ncolleagues who were very motivated to do\n[ __ ]\nand so like it helped me because then I\nstarted doing [ __ ] they were all like\nresearchers and like studying like the\norigins of schizophrenia and like\nstarting businesses and stuff like that\nthese are the people that I would be\non-call with then it's like well [ __ ]\nlike I like to play video games like I'm\na gamer and all these people they're\nlike MD PhDs in an institution on in the\nNortheast which I shall not name and\nthen like I was like well [ __ ] maybe I\nshould do something and I was like I\ndon't want it so I tried doing things\ntheir way I was like let me try doing\nresearch students like this [ __ ]\nsucks and I was like I like to play\nvideo games maybe I can do research on\nthat maybe I could do something for\ngamers I was like oh this is pretty cool\nbut if I hadn't been at that institution\nI probably probably would have entered\nmy mind to do research or and/or start a\ncompany that's devoted to helping a\nparticular problem so create your\ncommunity okay so let me think about\nthis so I've struggle with this problem\nI basically get really into something\nfor a few months to here and then stop\ncaring and lose motivation I'm not sure\nif it's feeling or failure or what I\nwould seriously love your thoughts yeah\nso I don't think it's fear of failure I\nmean it could be but I would guess that\nyou just get bored right today actually\nuse the word bored yeah so I think what\nwhat motivates you is like learning a\nnew problem right it's like something\nthat's new and exciting and so I think\nthe problem is that you give up when the\nend is in sight like it's sort of like\nand that's not because and that's just\nbecause you figured stuff out at that\npoint I would be really curious about\nwhether this person gives up motivation\ntowards the end because like they\nfigured it out like the fun part is the\nfiguring it out so it's kind of weird\nbut this is I was planning on becoming\nan oncologist and part of the reason I\ndidn't become an oncologist and this\nisn't to diss anyone but I just found\nthat like figuring out medicine was fun\nlike figuring out how the heart works\nwas fun figuring out how cancer works\nwas fun figuring out like how the\nkidneys work was fun but once I figured\nit out I started to get bored of it\nI was kind of like well like now it's\njust the same thing okay like if their\nheart works this way then I do this it\nworks this way I do this that all these\nprotocols because we use evidence-based\nmedicines there of all these big trials\nand it's really like figuring out okay\nlike which is the best treatment based\non all this available data and what I\nliked about psychiatry is like I have no\n[ __ ] idea what to do\nthere is no like protocol it's like when\nsky shows up like I don't know what to\nsay like I've talked to him once before\nlike I don't know what like he's a\ndifferent person now like I don't know\nwhat to do that's fun for me\nI get bored easily too so I like I'm\nlike I don't know I don't know if I'm\ngonna do a healthy game for 20 years\nlike I may just stop in a year like I\nthe same thing happens to me I like get\ninterested with stuff and I move on and\nthat's fine so I think that what the\nsecond thing that I suggest is that it's\nnot that you're like lazy it's that you\nget bored easily right I'm not gonna\nleave you don't worry but\nyou know I'd say that this person kind\nof gets bored easily and so like if\nthat's your problem then I would say\nlike try to do a couple of different\nthings at the same time this is gonna\nsound kind of weird but if you get bored\nof marketing like start a marketing\nthing and then shift 80% of your focus\nto something else but maintain 20% to\nfocus in marketing because the way that\nyou're gonna grow is when you get bored\nlet's say you want to learn piano and\nyou like marketing so like oh like I'm\nkind of done with marketing let me go to\npiano and then if you maintain the\nmarketing a little bit when you get\nbored of piano you can come back to\nmarketing it'll be just as fun as it\noriginally was\nso you can kind of juggle a couple of\ndifferent things so one one of my\nteachers once told me that like your\nproblem is that you get bored easily and\nso you should try to do multiple things\nand when you get bored of one thing then\nyou can move to the next thing and where\nyou get bored of that thing you come\nback to number one so now I do like two\nor three things and that's just how my\nday is like I can't see\nI saw patients for a few hours this\nmorning and then I stream like part of\nhealthy gamers because I couldn't just\nwork with people in my office all day\nthat's [ __ ] boring it's not that I\ndon't like him it's just I get bored and\nso I try to create a life in which I'm\nlike stimulated so like I do I do\nstreaming and then like I'm gonna like\nmaybe make some videos or something like\nthat and then I work with some patients\nI like talk to researchers and I'm\nthinking about like doing some research\nso I try to do like a few different\nthings and so like I'd say don't just do\none thing but like keep it on the\nbackburner and do something else and\nthen once you have like three things\nthat you're kind of committed to then\nyou rotate between the three and you'll\nbe amazed at how much you can accomplish\nwhich porn\n[Music]"
