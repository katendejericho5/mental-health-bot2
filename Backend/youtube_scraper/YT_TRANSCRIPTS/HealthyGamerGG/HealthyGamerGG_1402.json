    "transcript": "it expands quite a lot yeah I know I'm\nso the first thing what should I call\nyou buddy\nCohen okay that's the first thing Kevin\nis I owe you an apology because I know\nwe were scheduled to talk on Friday and\nthen I kind of bumped because I had a\nbunch of family in town and then we were\nscheduled to talk at the top of the hour\nbut reckful wanted to come on and and it\nactually sounded to me like what he was\ntalking about was maybe a little bit\nrelevant to what we were talking about\nso I yeah I was close to crying it was\nyeah yeah and so I'm sorry for you know\nbumping you a couple of times and it's\nfine it's really not but it's okay to\nsay it's not - so tell me a little bit\nthis but as you know from stream like we\nkind of had you on last week kind of\nimpromptu so I try to do things a little\nbit and prompt you from time to time and\nsometimes people get the short end of\nthe stick for that so I'm sorry about\nthat that's totally fine I mean that um\nso tell me a little bit about you know\nwhy don't you fill in people because we\nhave 3500 people yeah why don't you want\nto just help him a little bit about what\nwe talked about last week and kind of\nyou know what felt relevant to you we\ntalked a lot about pain versus suffering\nthe act of feeling pain and the act of\nexperiencing so yeah and a lot about\nactually how then the nihilism the way\nthat Brecht fulfilled it versus how I\nfelt it was very comparable I feel what\nwas comparable about he also it felt\nlike he had a childhood trauma that\nreally shaped his his his reality for\nyeah and and and that's completely the\nsame and to catch people up I almost\nlost my father when I was 12 and that\nreally shaped how I felt about the world\nand and we got around to me feeling that\nthe that experience was was me feeling\nthat nothing was worth anything because\nwhen something can end in such a moment\nthat that shapes your life yeah\nand and with the samskaara with the kid\ngetting bit and stuff like yeah so so\nKevin can we actually back up a little\nbit because that's not actually what\nwhere we started right where did we\nstart what did you first say to me you\nhad a question uh yeah my question was\nhow do you distinguish between the\nfeeling of wanting not wanting to die\nbut not not wanting to live yeah so so I\nI personally feel that I don't want to\ndie but I really don't want yeah\nbeautiful and that was and what was it\nthat brought that on\ndo you remember what we talked about\nfirst you jump into the punch line yeah\nthat was yeah I'm sorry that was my\ngirlfriend yeah and that shook up how my\nexpense expectations were of the future\nand I feel like it has only gone worse\nbut what's gotten worse but that was\nreally the trigger I found out today\nthat she might be already seeing someone\nelse and I feel like like reflecting on\nthat I feel like the far I I had about\nmaybe trying to get it to work or in any\nshape of form trying to get it to work\nit might have been shattered now and and\nI've I build all my expectations of\nreality and and all my joy in in a life\nwith her yeah okay so we're gonna take\nit we're gonna take a step back okay so\nthe first thing to understand is that so\nmy recollection Kevin from what we\ntalked about last time is that you know\nyou had said that you're not quite it's\nnot that you're suicidal and you want to\nkill yourself but you just don't see\nanything worth living in life it's that\nlife sort of lacks purpose or zest and\nthat fir yeah and go ahead and we we\nactually talked about I actually had\nbeen feeding that that like that before\nI met her five years ago so that's a\nthat's a long time of a feeling that\nthat she was\nthe only thing worth living for\nabsolutely and I had that feeling before\nthat and the the feeling goes goes way\nback into yeah my teenage so I think a\nlot like reckful so so from what I\nremember from our conversation you had\nfelt like you know life was purposeless\nand then you met her and once you met\nher then suddenly like you can start to\nbuild a life you can start to move\nforward because you can live with her\nyou guys are gonna get married you're\ngonna have kids blah blah blah yadda\nyadda maybe maybe not but that you can\nsort of start to construct a life that\nhas purpose and meaning but the truth is\nthat that's actually not like a real\nlike purpose that's just a distraction\nright and so you start to build this\nlife you kind of put all your eggs in\none basket and and that's I absolutely\nand and then what happens is once you\nbreak up then you feel like your life is\npurposeless but the truth is that the\npurposelessness began way before her so\nwhat do you want to talk about today do\nyou want to talk about the origin of the\npurposelessness do you want to talk\nabout the prospect of her like dealing\nwith sort of the feelings that she may\nbe dating someone again and what that\nbrings up for you because even if you\nknow that she's not really the root of\nthe problem it can be really hard to\nshake all of the negative emotions yeah\nI think I feel like especially today I\nwould have said talk about my past and\nwith my dad and stuff like that but but\nthe feeling I got today was quite\nintense that talk about today buddy yep\nhave to strongly yeah yeah I found out\nthat she she was saying like we haven't\ndivided anything we've been living\ntogether for three years so so so it's\nquite a lot and I found out that that\nshe's been she was buddies with this one\nguy while we were dating and now that\nthat we're not she's gotten too lonesome\nsome transportation card or whatever you\nand I gonna find out essentially by\nchecking that not stalking I was just\nchecking to make sure it is system in\nDenmark but that she was going to his\naddress it just showed him I thought it\nwas my card I have to so she could have\none when we were together and I found\nout essentially that she's been going to\nthis guy and after we talked I kind of\ntried to make my mind aware that that we\nmight not ever again be be together and\nI I think the the little tried to make\nyour own aware of that or the mind\nstarted thinking that automatically I\ntried to make my mind figure that but\nlike a mom I'm still sleeping 20 hours\nok a day and and I'm still like not\neating and yeah and essentially that\nshattered like before a hundred percent\nof my life was trying to get this to\nwork and I tried to like put my mind\ninto the like I'm gonna try like 20\npercent of it it has to\nI thought makes made sense of trying to\nget this work and maybe she needs time\nand stuff like this but I feel like the\nthe chance has diminished so much that\nyeah I think it gives me a sense of new\nmeaningless yeah so what is your okay so\nlet's just think about this for a second\nso in the one hand it sounds like you\nrecognize that your your lack of purpose\nhas nothing to do with your relationship\nyeah if you at the same time you've\nbuilt up the sense of purpose which your\nmind has gotten used to right it's\nbecome a part of you that you were\nderiving a sense of purpose it was sort\nof like you're you're thirsty and you're\nmoving through a desert and there's no\nwater anywhere and you find an oasis\nwhich is her and she's giving you water\nthis relationship is keeping you alive\nand then the relationship ends and then\nsuddenly you're back in the desert again\nand not only that but you're thinking\nmaybe I can find that oasis again like\nmaybe if I put effort into it we can be\ntogether again and then you find this\nthing on the transportation card which\nsort of tells you like oh like actually\nlike the Oasis is probably never gonna\nbe there\nyeah like the chance is slim and I\nreally feel that the thought that I\nmight not ever find this oasis with\nwater again it's like I want to be with\nher like logically and and I think she's\na kind sweet person I love her a lot of\nobviously and but I think the only thing\nthat has given me any form of Drive\nlately has been like she would come over\nlast week and divide some stuff and and\nthat was the first time I showered there\nwas the first time I ate it was the\nfirst time I actually clean how do you\nfeel about that it makes me really sad\nwhat's sad about that because I think\nit's the fart of maybe never again\nexperiencing that the way she made me\nfeel like and be the prospect of a\nfamily and the prospect of a family with\nher I think the connection we made we\nwere both when we were sitting and\ntalking when we met last like we weren't\nmad at each other we burned and we told\nand we got the saying that maybe we\nshould have been friends before we\nbecame before we got together and I\nthink yeah the prospect of going forward\nwithout that really really hits me it's\nyou in what we're yeah I think it goes\nback to feeling fulfilled being happy\nokay so I think you've grown attached to\nthis relationship right which is normal\nand we talked last time about how like\npain\nyou can't avoid pain a negative emotion\nin life but attachment is what leads to\nsuffering\nso it's expectation that leads to true\nsuffering yeah right it's like when I\nwhen I'm opening a present and I think\nit's gonna be a new iPhone and it turns\nout to be an Android well I would\nactually be happy but you know other\npeople but app apps and it's like when a\nwhen a movie that you've heard\neverything about you've heard everyone\nsays it's awesome it's awesome it's\nawesome and it disappoints that's\nbecause expectation is actually the real\ndevil but in your case I think there's\nway more going on in sadness\nso you're she made you feel a certain\nway fine\nis there grief that should happen over\nthe relationship absolutely but I think\nthat there's more than sadness dare are\nyou detecting any other emotions\nhopelessness okay tell me about that we\ntalked last time about how everything I\ndid in my life was really revolved\naround building this expectation like\nbuilding the like I I'm looking forward\nto getting my degree so that we can have\nmore money and we can have we can go on\nadventures together and the when I was\nat school the only reason why I would\nwant to get through the day was to get\nhome to her and that feeling yeah yeah\nsounds like you had really become\ndependent on her to motivate you yeah\nand most of the time I would skip school\njust to relax with her and I think that\nand I have a lot of guilt over over yeah\nsorry someone messaged me um\nI have a lot of guilt about me not\ntrying hard enough that's really I'm\nvery susceptible to the feeling of\nfailure and the feeling of missing out\nthat hits me really hard\nwhy so that's absolutely so we're gonna\nget to that because I think that's\nactually the real problem so we're gonna\ntalk about this in a second okay\nso tell me why do you think you're so\nsusceptible to the feeling of failure\nthat's a hard one yep I'm sorry my voice\nis quivering I'm really trying really\nhard to speak cleaned out the river\nbeing Danish and it's okay the first\ntime I wanted to kill myself was five\nand a half years ago and that was\nbecause it was I was fulfilling the I\nwas trying to do an education that I\nknow my father would be proud of which I\nreally didn't want to do\nalthough I think I've been saving this\nacceptance of love from my father all\nthis time\nyeah sounds like someone's been doing\nsome thinking over the last week I have\nI've known these things for years I'm\naware of them but I have a really hard\ntime opening up about it\nbecause he knew that I would cry now if\nyou'd like this how do you send this\nfits like [ __ ] okay so you feel sad\nright now what feels bad tell me every\ntime I cry it feels like physical\npencils in my head and in my chest and\nyeah okay so we're gonna help you with\nthat physical pain for a moment there\nand then we're gonna we're gonna talk\nabout the psychology of it okay\nso the first thing that we're gonna do\nthat we're gonna try to calm you down a\nlittle bit so sit up straight close your\neyes\nwe're gonna do another kind of\nmeditation so I'm gonna teach you\nsomething called triphasic breathing\nokay just sit up straight I want you to\nclose your eyes and I want you to try to\nkeep your chest still but as you inhale\nmove your abdomen so move your belly\npush your belly out as you breathe in\nand as you breathe out pull your belly\nin breathe in\npull push the belly out as you breathe\nout pull the belly in\nso with each breath I want you to move\nyour bellybutton out and then in out and\nthen in so just do that for a moment\nyou\nyou\nyou\nand now what I want you to do is when\nyou breathe in pull the so breathe in\nwith your belly first and then expand\nyour chest\nthere you go expand it out wide and then\nbreathe out and bring your belly in\nagain get that last bit of air out\nbeautiful and now one more breath and\nthen the last phase has raised your\nshoulders pull your shoulders up up good\nlike that and then out so first the\nbelly\nthe chest and then the last little bit\nis with the shoulders and then out\nand one more breath\nnow just sit\neyes closed\nfeel your head\nfeel your chest\nwhat do you feel\nmuch Boko okay yeah\nso Kevin point number one you got a stop\nstop running away from the feelings\nthey're piling up they're overwhelming\nyou yeah the reason that you feel for\nthe business like you can't feel meaning\nin life because any time so the place\nthat meaning comes from\nis the same place that negative emotions\ncome from because remember this whole\npoint about Dharma is that Dharma gives\nyou purpose despite negative emotions\nthe problem is that you can't find\nTherma because you're running away from\nthe negative emotions Dharma is the most\npure Dharma that you can find is when\nnegative emotions exist that's when you\nfind the real meaning of life right not\nwhen you're like partying on and yacht\nit's like when you're in a concentration\ncamp or you're like Martin Luther King\ngiving a speech about civil rights or\nyou're like trying to like save the\nworld like when you're trying to save\nanother human being when you're in the\noperating room and you're performing\nsurgery and you're tired and you're\nsweaty and you're afraid that they're\ngonna die like that's when you find your\nmeaning the biggest problem that so many\npeople have is that you run away from\nyour negative emotions you're so afraid\nof the way that they make you feel that\nyou can't go to the place where you're\ngonna find the purpose\nthe first thing that we've got to help\nyou do is to face those negative\nemotions sit with them breathe through\nthem and accept them because your\nproblem isn't sadness your problem isn't\nan empty life your problem is fear\nyour problem is that you've been living\na life like you don't have purpose in\nyour life because you haven't been\nliving for yourself for decades you\nstopped living for yourself a long time\nago so no wonder you can't find purpose\nbecause you like you've forgotten you\nnever learn how to live for yourself\nhe's started by living for your dad and\nthen you started by living for your\ngirlfriend so you move from person to\nperson to person that can give you\nmeaning you pick a career that would\nmake your dad happy instead of one that\nwould make you happy so it's like you've\nleveled up like living for others and\nlike your ability to live for yourself\nhas become completely buried and why is\nit completely buried because anytime you\nthink about your life like sure your\ngirlfriend made you happy but the real\nproblem is here is that somewhere along\nthe way you never learned or you forgot\nthat you can be happy with other people\nthat you can be happy on your own that\nyou actually don't need another human\nbeing to make you happy but you never\nlearned that so we've got it this this\nis a problem of uncertainty about the\nfuture the reason you're so attached to\nthis oasis is because you don't have\nfaith that if you trek out into the\ndesert you won't find water\nthat's the problem it's about fear\nsure you feel sad like I think anyone\nwho has a breakup is gonna feel sad I\ndon't think that those feelings are bad\nno and and I I connect I feel like I can\nseparate those feelings and and I really\nknow how you mean because I think for\nthe last almost two weeks now I've been\nlike I can't have have quiet quietness I\nalways have to have things if it's in my\nheadphones or when I'm lying in bed like\n90% of the time I have to get my iPad\nand and have something going like a\nstream yeah oh yeah and I fall asleep\nabsolutely so this is the thing right\nnow your head is a terrifying place you\ncannot face what is going on in your\nhead it's overwhelming\nI've described it yeah I've tried to use\nart at one point to describe it to to my\nlittle girlfriend and when I just\ndescribed it to her it was like all the\nnegative things I have it's like a\npandora's but absolutely sitting in a\nbasement and I'm even too afraid to even\nenter the person you have to try and I\nknow I mean I sort of know how you feel\ncuz I was in the same place so when I\nwas like failing out of college like I'm\nthe child of two doctors and everyone in\norder like social circle is like very\naccomplished and all that kind of good\nstuff\nand so like I knew I was failing at life\nand I felt so ashamed and I knew I was\n[ __ ] up and I could do nothing to\nstop it and every day that went by I\n[ __ ] it up more and I [ __ ] it up\nmore and I [ __ ] it up more and I was\njust like on this like downward spiral\nand I couldn't stop it and so the only\nthing that gave me relief is that I\nwould play video games until I was so\nexhausted that I would just pass out no\ntime for my mind to think the scariest\ntime was when I laid was when I was\nlaying in bed and I could not distract\nmyself because all of that shame in that\nnegativity would come boiling up\nbut here's the thing Kevin you think\nit's scary down there and it absolutely\nis scary but that's not gonna destroy\nyou\nit can't destroy you I don't believe it\ncan destroy you you're afraid of it\nbecause you don't know what's down there\nright so fear understand this Kevin fear\nlives off of a lack of information the\nless we know the more afraid we are\nright like if I'm a six year old kid and\nI'm afraid there's a monster in the\ncloset do you know is that door open or\nclosed when I'm afraid there's a monster\nin there it's always absolutely\nabsolutely right and why is that okay\nbecause it's finger scary yeah and what\nhappens if the door opens you're afraid\nof what's good yeah but what happens\nafter the door opens so like let's say\nthat I have a six-year-old kid and the\nkid is afraid that there's a monster in\nthe closet and then I'm the parent and I\nwalk in and I open the door what does\nthe kid do and then do they stay scared\nonce the doors open I said no they can't\nthey learn that yeah they learned that\nso it's an absolutely traumatic when I\nreach my door when I reach to open the\ndoor handle absolutely the kid is gonna\nfreak the [ __ ] out they're like no no\ndon't open it don't open it don't open\nit don't open it and they're tear\nthey're terrified and then I open the\ndoor and there's nothing back there now\nin your case there's something in the\nbasement but you've got to understand\nthis fear thrives off of a lack of\ninformation it can only exist in\nhypotheticals fear is not about reality\nit is about the hypothetical\nyeah that's the only thing I've been\nthinking about all day it's the\nhypotheticals yes trying to use I'm\ncrazy to like what if she just went\nthere to get somewhere so forget you\nneed to stop living in hypotheticals\nyeah and and really start living with\nwhere you are and the beautiful thing is\nthat like so I want you to understand is\nwhen you push the emotions away that's a\nhypothetical - that's not a reality\nyou're keeping the emotions in the\nhypothetical zone because you're not\nliving them as you start to live like\nhow bad was it to cry Kevin just now\nboth good and bad I'm actually crying\nright now when you were so like news\nflash you step down into the basement\nand you survived so this is the big\nlesson that you somehow have not learned\nis that you are [ __ ] indestructible\nlike you just don't know that and like\nhere you're doing it you're crying in\nfront of 2458 people right now I was\nafraid it was still funny yeah thanks I\ndon't have this three-month on purpose\nyeah right it's hard enough to cry by\nyourself there crying in front of like\n2500 people and like hey guess what\nyou're still here and I think the really\nhard part about thinking about this\nbreakup was that that I am going to live\nand I think maybe even more that I might\nreach a day where she isn't a part of\nthis and where I'm with someone else and\nI'm I invested these five years into\nsomething that might be like gone\nforever\nthe thing about something being\npermanently gone because of something I\nmay have done it's world reg yes to me\nso this is because you're arrogant\nyou're so arrogant you believe you have\nthe power to control that relationship\nwhere do you get the nerve believing\nthat if you did things differently that\nrelationship would still be alive that\nis the depth of arrogance you need to\nunderstand that in this world you only\nare entitled to what you do you are not\nentitled to what happens there is\nincredible freedom in this that you\ndon't get to control what happens in\nthat relationship that's your problem\nyour problem is arrogance that if you\nhad done this if you had done this if\nyou had done this or even today if you\ndo this tomorrow if you do this tomorrow\nthat you can repair that relationship\nthe relationship is not yours to control\nit's just not the faster you accept that\nthe faster you can try you can try to be\ncivil you can try to tell her hey I want\nto get back together but that's all\nyou're entitled to you're not actually\nentitled to the relationship and the\nother thing is that I I do think that\nyou know you'll have invested five years\ninto this relationship and it could end\nand that may seem like a waste but I can\ntell you that I don't think it's a waste\nbecause I think that the lessons we\nlearn in life are invaluable\nso I started medical school at the age\nof 27 which is like one year after most\nof my friends from college graduated so\nwhen they were graduating I hadn't even\nbeen accepted yet and it was like\nincredibly shaming and so I think like\noh I like wasted five years of my life\nno like did I like waste five years of\nmy life yes and it's made me the person\nthat I am today and I need it to waste\nthose five years of my life because now\nI can get on Twitch and I can talk to\npeople like you because you feel like\nyou've wasted five years and is it a\nwaste yeah but it's also like it's\nmaking you the person that you are and\nyou have to live you have to live like\nwhere you are you can't live in a\nhypothetical world like you have to you\nhave to play the character that you\nroles right like once you make a\ncharacter like that's the character and\nif you like screw up and you wipe you\nhave to like you have to start like you\nhave to respawn and then you gotta like\nplay from where you respawned you just\ndoesn't matter like you can't you can\nget upset about wiping as much as you\nwant but like you got to play like if\nyou respawn you respawn and then you\nzone back in and then you try to take\ndown whatever raid boss like you try\nagain\nthe problem is that you don't like\nyou're in the process of respawning and\nyou don't like you don't think that you\nyou just think you get one shot but you\ndon't you get many shots that's what's\ncool that life is you actually get to\nkeep trying until you die yeah and I\nthink I've been overthinking this\nbecause every time I I think about this\nI I think about but what what I what am\nI going to tell her how am I going to\ntell her what words would I use to make\nthe the outcome fail maybe getting here\nyeah to try again and stuff like that\nbut what makes the highest percentage of\nsuccess so I want you to notice Kevin\nthat that thing is like a little like\nparasite in your mind that there's a\npart of your mind that's because I know\nfrom acting absolutely and it does from\nacting how I how my true self really\nwants to act there you go so heaven\nyou're doing it because you just [ __ ]\nfigured out that you have a true self\nthat's beautiful right now that you see\nthat that thing is trying to hold on to\nthis false sense like the second you\nbegin to realize that you have a true\nself and you're already realizing it so\nthis is the cool thing about yawn so\nyawn is the Sun is one of the Sun script\nwords for knowledge which means\nunderstanding you can't shake\nunderstanding once you understand\nsomething you can't understand it once\nyou understand that two plus two equals\nfour then you always understand that two\nplus two equals four you can forget but\nyou can't stop understanding once you\nknow what a strawberry tastes like once\nyou know what cheese tastes like once\nyou know what it's like to take a hot\nshower once you know what it's like to\ntake a cold shower experience cannot be\ntaken away from you and your salvation\nlies in the fact that you started to\ndiscover that there is a true self under\nthere I don't know how you found it but\nyou know that something is not your true\nself and that gives me hope yeah because\nyou used to think that the the part of\nyou that craved a relationship with her\nthat needed a relationship with her was\nyour true self but what if I feel like\nthat still\nthat maybe becomes what I want what\nbecomes what you want but I have a I\nhave a hard time like coding those two\nfeelings away from each other because I\nthink it's it's so melded together I\nknow that I have so a true self and a\nway that I would act without thinking\nbut if I would like tell you how I feel\nwithout thinking I would still feel that\nI would want this to work the best way\npossible\nso trying yeah so I want you to\nunderstand that that's actually not like\nthat's a part of you right so your\ndesire to have her be a part of your\nlife again is very real and that you've\ngrown attached to that right like that's\nwhat happens you've grown attached and\nso like detachment can be a painful\nprocess and it's fine to want to be with\nher and just recognize those thoughts\nrecognize that there's a part of you\nthat that no matter what you do or what\nyou think or how much you grow there's a\npart of you that's always gonna want to\nwant to try to control her and\nmanipulate her into getting back with\nyou yeah and and that's the really hard\npart because how do i how do I try to\nget her back without essentially as you\nsay manipulating her because I don't\nwant her to be sad I don't want her to\nactually be in a relationship that that\ndoesn't fulfill her either way I love\nher very much and that's I mean that in\na very deep way so I don't want to\ninfluence her in any way that would make\nher life less see yeah so that's\nconflict right because there's a part of\nyou that's saying if she can be happy\nwith someone else I want that for her\nbecause I love her and there's a part of\nyou that's saying oh hell no I wanted to\nbe with me so the first thing to\nunderstand is that there are these two\nwarring parts of you that one of them is\nattachment and one of them is love those\nare two different things and they\noftentimes get confused attachment and\nlove but what and those conflict when I\nand this is a very I don't I hope I\ndon't get too much hate for saying that\nbut\nI truly think that she could be happy\nwith of course so let's be clear the\npart of you that is attached is not\nwrong it's not incorrect\nit's just attached of course she could\nbe happy with you that's not incorrect\nso the way that we defeat that part\nactually we don't defeat it but the way\nthat we don't defeat it by proving it\nwrong which you can try to do so\nsometimes when you have a war within\nyour mind like you try to fight against\nyourself and that's exhausting so this\nis what you need to do I want you to\npretend so let me ask you this you lost\nyour dad I didn't do some I was close to\nlosing him and I've been close to losing\nhim two more times after that so the\npart of you that is afraid of losing her\ndoes that feel but I can does that kind\nof give you an example my um my\ngrandfather was essentially my second\ndad because if because my father was a\nlittle bit absent and I lost him some\nyears ago so we can use that so when you\nthink about losing her does it feel like\nthe same do you feel like you're 12\nyears old again and your dad is sick\nyeah it actually feels very much the\nsame it feels like my whole life is over\nso that's the Sam Scottie I I feel I\nfeel a very strong feeling of panic we\nwe were scheduled to actually see each\nother today and when she called me and\nsaid she were sick that and that I could\nI've known her for five years she wasn't\nsick that made me panic very much\nbecause now I'd lost my chance too so so\nthis is important okay so I'm gonna just\ntype this out in chat first\nso the some scar gets activated when you\nwere about to lose someone where there's\na prospect of losing someone so I want\nyou to understand this very carefully if\nyou actually lose her at some point\nthen you're gonna feel fine like you'll\nfeel sad but the some scar won't be\nactive so thing is you guys have broken\nup but you don't feel like you've lost\nher right you actually feel like\nwell so do you see I feel like this yeah\nso as long as that that's the feeling\nwith your dad because you didn't\nactually lose your dad so the fear is\nabout the possibility of loss in your\nmind is actually in the place where\nthere's a possibility of loss you feel\nlike there's still hope in the\nrelationship\nthat's the some scar the weird thing is\nlike it's sort of like if you get bit by\na dog and you walk down the street and\nyou see a cat you don't feel scared so\nonce you know that the relationship is\nfinally over the some scar is actually\ngoing to deactivate in a bizarre way and\nyou'll feel better because then it's not\nthe same situation it's not it's the\npossibility of loss that you're the most\nscared of so what do you do about this\nthe first thing is you got to stop\nfighting\nthat doesn't mean give in I want you to\npretend so how old are you now Kevin ok\n26 so I want you to pretend that there's\na 12 year old you and there's a 26 year\nold view and the 12 year old you is\nterrified of losing your dad so imagine\nyou're you're your own older brother\nwhat would you do with the 12 year old I\nhave no idea yes that's the problem\nright because you don't know how to\ncomfort that that person you don't know\nhow to help that person that person\ndoesn't need to be proven they're wrong\nthat person needs like compassion and\nhelp you need reassurance you need\nsomeone to say hey buddy\nlike sure this person may pass away or\nthis relationship may end but I have\nfaith in you and I'm gonna be with you\nand we're gonna figure this out together\nthat's what you need to learn how to\ntell yourself right that loss can happen\nand it's scary and it's not what you\nwant and I'm not saying it's fair I'm\nnot saying it's Pleasant it's gonna be\nshitty but it doesn't have to destroy\ndo you believe it's going to destroy you\nlogically no but it feels like it it\nfeels like I only have like one month to\nlive so understand that you're you're\nallowed to feel that way\nyou're absolutely allowed to feel that\nway right and you don't have to argue\nagainst it\nbecause that's how you feel and as best\nas you can\nlike just pause and try to find that\nCenter so I think you should meditate\nyou have a way that you can learn\nmeditation like TrueView - yeah I want\nyou to go something I don't know you\nhave a yoga class that you can go to no\nno I'm a poor student I don't I can't\nreally buy anything thank you Jim have a\nyoga yeah so look into that they might\nhave so the other thing that I want to\nexplain to you and everyone who's\nwatching is that so men especially feel\nlike emotions in their body like they\ndon't understand mentally like what\nemotion they're feeling but they\ncertainly feel it in their body and the\nexample that I like to give is like you\nknow when someone gets like when I get\ndumped by my girlfriend I don't know\nwhat I'm feeling like I don't know how\nto say like I'm afraid that I'm never\ngonna find love again like that's not\nwhat you tell your friends you say like\noh yeah man she hit me and like she\nkicked me in the nuts like that's what\nyou say and like everyone understands\nthat you mean you guys under all\nunderstand what that means you don't\nunderstand like what that is emotionally\nbut you understand it physically like\nthat's how it feels so what you need to\ndo is work on your body so if you have\nthe option to see a therapist or\nsomething like that I definitely think\nyou should do that especially if you've\nbeen I have a yeah already have a time\nactually I don't have time it's the\nother thing you need to do is understand\nthat emotional processing for you if you\nwant to if you want to clean out the\nbasement without ever going down there\nyou must use your body yoga tai chi is\nbest exercise is good but apparently\nyoga and Tai Chi is better\nso it science us so as you start to move\nyour body you're gonna feel that\ntightness and then like just like we did\ntoday is you breathe into the tightness\nit starts to feel better and that's not\nsuppression that's not forgetting that's\nnot distraction that's you actually\nsitting with and feeling and processing\nyour emotions you're doing it physically\nwhich is really cool that you can do\nthat because the body and the mind are\nconnected and if you feel mentally\nbummed out up here your energy level is\ngonna drop and if you use caffeine\nyou're gonna feel activated up here body\nand mind are connected and you need to\nuse them both so I think therapy is good\nI think Yoga is good do Surya Namaskar\nthe Sun Salutation I'm gonna type it in\nchat okay yes you are while DM YouTube\nchi gong is good too Qi Gong is like\nbrown I am so Brown I am and Qi Gong as\nwell as asan and Tai Chi it's a sequence\nof yoga poses if you do three Surya\nNamaskar Xin the morning and three Surya\nNamaskar before you go to bed I think\nyou're gonna feel way better oh sorry I\nsaid if you feel like if you do three in\nthe morning three rounds of Surya\nNamaskar in the morning and three rounds\nof Surya Namaskar at night you're gonna\nfeel better can you get all messy I'll\ndo okay all right\nbecause I don't okay sure cool so\nquestions Kevin like one thing I have is\nis more practical now because I know we\nreached very much the core of the\nproblem but when I'm these passages we\ngonna have been sleeping 20 20 hours out\nof 24 and I haven't been outside much\nand yeah even eating I've lost 15 pounds\nin this time\nthe only question I really have is how\npractical like practically to do stuff\nhow can i hack it because I also feel\nlike if I like one reasoning I have\nbetween this and I'm thinking clearly\nhow I want if I were to get her back was\nthat I have to be in another place I\nhave to be good like yeah I have to get\nbetter and and and also for myself like\nthat it's not just for that relationship\nbut I have to get better so I don't know\nhow to to get know so so I think that\nsometimes human beings forget that we're\ncommunal animals and we try to do\neverything ourselves\nso in sanskrit there's a word called\nSangha Sangha means community and Sangha\nis critical for success in meditative or\nspiritual practice so I think the\nproblem like the simplest way is that\nyou have to figure out do you have any\nkind of community that you can engage\nwith I actually don't only have my\nfamily I moved to this town because of\nher okay yeah and I have a few few\nfriend okay so a couple of things the\nfirst is you know so part of what we do\nlike part like so I stream but then we\nalso do a lot of other stuff with\nhealthy gamer so one of those things is\nwe're training a group of recovery\ncoaches and you guys can sign up at\nhealthy game or gg so I think that like\nyou should maybe think about joining\nsome of our groups and stuff and then\nlike start talking to people working\nwith people who are sharing like similar\nproblems that you guys that you have and\nyou guys help each other the other thing\nis you've got to find community because\nyou're not it's like really hard neuro\nscientifically and behaviorally to just\nlike turn your life around\nso I think it's good that you're going\nto the doctor like you you're in your\nstudent right so there are people in the\nclass\nI'm just about to graduate and I\nactually have lit ru and I don't have\nany anyone around me okay so like are\nyou gonna get a job I hope so what's\nthat process looking like it looks very\nhard right now or it looks I can't find\nthe the word in in English\nit looks exhausting to actually do that\nprocess and yeah and I'm not looking for\nya so I'm glad that you're seeing a\ndoctor tomorrow because you actually\nsound like you're clinically depressed\nhow long have you been feeling this way\ndid you say clinically depressed it cut\nout yeah yeah this way yeah all my life\nI would say but that how long have been\nsleeping 20 hours of the other got sick\nif my girlfriend permitted it I would\nhave slept 20 hours a day\nmost of our relationship yeah so I think\ndefinitely get an evaluation and I mean\nI I don't know I mean I think you've got\nto find something to do right so I don't\nknow like what you're interested in and\nit sounds like you're you're graduating\nand so I don't know if you guys have job\nfairs or things like that but like I\nthink you've got to find a community\nbecause the community is what's gonna\nhelp you out when you're in your darkest\ntime like when I went to the ashram sure\nI did a lot of yoga and meditation but\nthere were other people there that were\nalso doing yoga and meditation or try to\nfigure out who they were and what's\ngoing on in their life yeah so if you go\nto the gym and like they do a yoga class\nlike you should go every week because\nyou're gonna be meet people and then one\nday one of them is gonna be like hey do\nyou want to go grab a coffee or\nsomething\nfine and I absolutely it's actually\ngoing it's funny that they after we\ntalked I had this and it's funny but now\nthat we listen to Rachel and I listen to\nyou about saying that you want to help\nas many people as possible\nI had the very intense feeling of I\nwanted to do this school what's the call\nwhen you come up and speak to people in\nlike like a motivational speaker I'm\nlosing her\nnot motivational speaker but but a a\nperson who like visits to school to talk\nabout the people who have had these\nproblems and maybe trying good help yeah\nI had a very intense feeling of that\nthat they have so I think that's that's\nthe how Dharma is born right when you\nstart recognizing that like the reason\nyou can sleep 20 hours a day because the\nis it because the only person you're\nscrewing over is yourself and yeah I'm\nso much that's the person we don't value\nyourself yeah so I think therapy will\nhelp with that and I think you you know\nhaving someone else in your life like\nthat that you're beholden to is really\nimportant like it's 9:20 I've been in my\noffice on a Sunday since 3 o'clock and\nwhy is that like this is not how I want\nto spend my Sunday I mean it is but it's\nyou know this is my day off I know what\nyour main like right so I get like two\ndays off and I work a lot that week and\nand this is what keeps us going this is\nwhat allows us to tolerate suffering and\nso I think you should absolutely find\nyour Dharma but it starts with little\nthings so I'd say like go to the gym and\nsee what kind of classes like it doesn't\neven matter if they don't have yoga\nclasses go to a class in or interact\nwith other human beings and expand your\norbit because as human beings we're\nwired to like do things and care about\nthings that other people care about like\nthat's what peer pressure is when\neveryone at school when you're 15 and\neveryone has like a certain backpack or\ncertain kind of jeans that's what you\nwant so your problem is that your peer\npressure you know who you know what peer\npressure means like where are you\ngetting peer pressure from no no correct\nfrom from the people around me but\nriding on you around right now right now\nI'm probably being around people in your\nlife who are your peers it's kind of a\ntrick question\nyeah you're around yourself you're your\npeer you're in your head you have\nmultiple versions of you you talk to\nyourself all the time so all of the\nthings that don't so much\nso like the hot new jeans at your school\nis your girlfriend that's the only thing\nthat matters because that's the all the\npeople in your head all of the different\nversions of you the part that would be\nthat's sad the part of you that's\nfearful the part of you that wants to\ncontrol the part of you that's hungry\nfor a better life all of those people\nthey all want one thing and that's her\nso you've got to spend time around other\npeople you guys have to understand that\nyour head is not like monolithic your\nmind is not one thing your mind is like\na whole host of different voices and\ndesires and feelings and logic and\nrationality and emotions and that they\nall fight against each other for\nsupremacy habits wanting to play video\ngames wanting to eat certain kinds of\nfood wanting to eat other kinds of food\nwanting to change wanting to say it's\nstay the same your mind is a whole\nOrchestra of different people the\nproblem is that all of your peer\npressure just makes you value her so\nyou've got a you've got to find other\npeers because when you're with a bunch\nof yoga people like they're gonna all\ncare about like self development and\ngrowth and being spiritual and not\npolluting the earth and all that kind of\ncrap like you like your brain is just\nwired to care about that stuff if you\nhang around with other people who care\nabout that stuff so you got to just\nspend time with other people I don't\ncare how you do it like you're a smart\nguy like I'm sure you can find something\nJim is a great place to start so go to a\nclass can be CrossFit it can be like\nZumba it can be yoga can be Gemini got\nwhatever and then as you start applying\nfor jobs like see if there are career\nevents like if there are job fairs or\nthings like that make a resume and start\ngoing to places like ask your counselors\nor whatever your resources are and like\nfind yourself a [ __ ] job because\nbeing depressed is bad being lonely as\nbad being dumped as bad\nall of those things and a broke is horse\nyeah okay and the last thing is that\nJulius Kevin I don't think you're a\npiece of [ __ ] man I don't think that\nyou're a waste of space\nand I I don't think that your life is\nhopeless and I think that that the\nbiggest problem the reason that you feel\nthat way is because you actually don't\nunderstand who you are is because the\nversion of you that exists is the one\nthat you discovered when you lived your\nlife based on other people so the only\nyou that you know is actually not the\nreal you\nyeah questions maybe that's why I yeah\nmaybe that's why I have to have\nsomething running all the time because\nthen I have it there's a chance of\nhearing my own thoughts because you\nthink your thoughts are scary but you've\ngot it they're not that I mean they're\ngonna be bad don't get me wrong and\nsometimes if you do feel suicidal or\nsomething like that you should go talk\nto someone\nyeah I've talked to a hotline and I know\nwhere I can go if if I'm there so yeah\nyeah questions for me buddy yeah I'm\nfeeling overwhelmed I don't think\nthere's nothing pretty good racing yeah\nso you're gonna feel overwhelmed because\nthe amount of transformation so let me\ntell you why you feel overwhelmed you're\nat the base of Mount Everest and you're\nlooking up to the top and you're saying\nwow that is a really far away to climb\nand you know what you're right and you\nshould feel overwhelmed but whether\nyou're climbing a mountain that's thirty\nthousand feet high twenty thousand feet\nhigh or 300 feet high how do you climb\nthat mountain\nonce the all you can do right now you\ncan't meditate for 10 years you can't be\nsober for 10 years you can't be in a\n10-year relationship you can only\nmeditate today you can only work out\ntoday you can only eat today you can\nonly apply to one job today you can only\nask a girl out today that's all you can\ndo\nthe rest is up to I don't know God Locke\nentropy karma whatever you want it to be\nas a human being you only control what\nyou do you don't control what happens\nand the more that you recognize that the\nmore free you will be and the more chill\nyou will be and the more your life will\nstart to turn around now so\ngoodnight my friends in twitch chat good\nluck\n[Music]\nThank You spunk and thanks for being\npatient\nof course it's so you you're making such\na immense difference and just listening\nto this
