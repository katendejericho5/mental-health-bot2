    "transcript": "so let's talk a little bit more about\nmeditation how to choose a meditation\nform just one I feel comfortable with\nare they're in meditation forms for\nspecific things like in Qi Gong one form\nis good for your heart one for your\nliver yeah so okay how do you develop a\nmeditation regimen fantastic question so\nthe first thing to remember is that\nmeditation actually has two words in Sun\nSwift more than two but let's start with\ntwo\none is thought or not and one is Dionne\nskipped my question what question\ncomplacent the one about complacent yeah\nI'm gonna get I'm gonna get to that one\nit's just I'm trying to link them\ntogether so that they like it's like\ninstead of answering them randomly I'm\ngonna like make a chain so you guys\nbuild up understanding and then we get\nto that one so so how do you choose a\nmeditation how do you know what you're\ncomfortable with it's not that I could\nskip the question it's a good one it's\njust I want to lay some foundation which\nwill make it easier to answer so one is\ngood for your your heart one is good for\nyour lungs things like that fine so the\nfirst thing to understand is there are\ntwo Sun Squidward's for meditation one\nis da da da which means focus so that\nErna is a verb so it's something that\nyou do and the other one is V on which\nmeans a state of mind that you achieve\nthe first thing that people get confused\nabout in meditation is they say like oh\nlike the I'm not good at meditating and\nwhat do they mean by that what they mean\nby that is that when I do this\nparticular practice I do not enter the\nstate of mind that everyone keeps\ntalking about I don't feel this inner\npeace or a no mind state or things like\nthat right and I would bet that niz may\nnot have gotten there today just based\non how he was talking\nso it's this is how I kind of describe\nit so people say like oh how do I find\nthe right technique of meditation it's\nthe one that gets you to the state of\nmind so you can sit and you can meditate\nwe can do alternate nostril breathing\nthis is a torn-up actually it's a brand\nI am but it's a dire enough there's\nsomething that I do so while I'm doing\nthis my thoughts can be all over the\nplace but the hope is that when I do\nthis right that the focus of my mind on\nmy breathing will stop any extraneous\nthoughts and then eventually I'll enter\nthe state of mind where I basically have\nno thoughts that's the state of Beyond\nand that takes practice but essentially\nthe kind of meditation technique that\nyou should choose is one that gets you\nto be on as quickly as possible so if\nyou're doing this and your mind is\nwandering all over the place that's not\nthe right technique for you practice\ndoes make perfect but in my experience\nif you try different buckets of\ntechniques there are some things that\nwork for someone's cognitive fingerprint\nbetter than others so we each have a\nbrain and our brain has different kinds\nof cortices and some people can focus\nthe attention of their mind through a\nparticular cortex so either through the\nvisual cortex somatosensory cortex audio\ncortex and so like they're different and\nwhen we think about a focused mind\nthere's some stuff that's going on on\nthe front in the frontal lobes but that\ndifferent people have like so that we\ngot to think about this like we each\nhave a unique face we have unique hands\nwe have unique fingerprints but no one\ntalks about the uniqueness of our mind\nlike no one [ __ ] talks about this\nblows my mind everyone's mind is\ndifferent and so everyone's mind has a\ndifferent regimen of meditation\ntechniques that is going to be ideally\nsuited for them there are 112 meditation\ntechniques out of which one will work\nrelatively easily for in theory every\nhuman who has ever been born is alive\nnow or will be born that this covers the\nwhole spectrum of different people's\ncognitive fingerprints\nand so you should do different\ntechniques based on what that is for\nsomeone who's ADHD\nI recommend this sound meditation and\nthis is the first one that I teach\ninside meditation we can't really do it\nhere because it's not loud enough but\nyou go to you go to any kind of loud\nplace where there like people and things\ngoing around so like a train station or\na cafeteria you close your eyes and you\ntry to listen to as many sounds as you\ncan as rapidly as you can don't engage\nwith the sounds but just have your mind\nmove from thing to thing to thing to\nthing to thing because the mind of an\nADHD person is moving very fast and so\nthe way that you get a mind to calm down\nis the same way that you get a baby to\nsit still like you guys know how you get\na toddler to like sit the [ __ ] down you\nhave them run around a whole lot if you\ntry to force them into one place they're\ngonna wriggle and things like that so\nyou just haven't like you exhaust them\nyou take them to a playground then the\nchild will calm down and the ADHD mind\nis like that and so when like I tear my\nhair out when I have people who have\nADHD and we were like trying all this\nmindfulness stuff they're trying to like\nbrute force like have their mind set\nthere no no no man like exhaustion move\nfast move from stimulus to stimulus to\nstimulus to stimulus I hear someone\ntalking cell phone ringing someone\ndropped a fort someone dropped something\nover here someone opened a box there's\nsomeone walking by another cellphone\nlaughter crying cell phone clinking\nthat's the way you do it and you push\nyour mind as fast as it can go as many\nstimuli as you can cover and eventually\nyour mind will slow down and it will\ncalm down right\nthat's the Tecna\nfor people with ADHD hard to do here and\nso someone says yeah I don't think that\nwould work for you fine there are\nbunches of other techniques right so\nmaybe try an investigative technique so\nthese are some of my favorites so we did\nthis a couple weeks ago with or like one\nweek ago with the court so take a moment\nyet in the middle of Ironforge is a\ngreat place to do this technique now you\nguys understand so take a moment to\nnotice your breath in the temperature of\nyour breath what do you think so\nwhat do you notice about the temperature\nof your breath\n[Music]\nso where do you feel the temperature\nso now what I want you to do is follow\nthe coldness right see where that\ncoldness goes do you only feel it in\nyour nose where in your nose the tip of\nyour nose the middle of your nose the\ntop of your nose your sinuses your\nthroat right so now like think about\nthis so now what I want you guys to do\nso this is actually trickery I'm sorry\nI've tricked you now I want you to pay\nattention every time you breathe what\nhappens in your mind\nas you focus on the temperature of the\nbreath your thoughts cease for a moment\nand then you analyze it and then\nthoughts return so as you close your\neyes for a moment no thoughts and then\nafter the breath thoughts thoughts no\nthoughts thoughts no thoughts so you're\ntraining yourself to enter the no mind\nstate and now what happens is you start\nto breathe slowly and then as you start\nto believe slowly the space of time that\nyou have no thoughts increases\nright and then some of you dumbasses are\ngetting upset with chat like let chat do\nwhat it wants to it's not going to work\nfor everyone the goal here is not to get\nchat in line just think about that for a\nsecond for those of you who are raging\nits chat like what are you trying to do\nthere what are you hoping to accomplish\nwhat do you think happens when you yell\nat chat does chat listen are they going\nto be shamed into listening to you know\nso notice that within yourself that\nyou're like holy [ __ ] this stuff is\nworking and chat why don't you like so\nforget about them that's what we talked\nabout for the last hour and a half\ndon't worry about other people now\npractice it notice your rage at chat and\nthen notice how is you rage at chat\nyou feel worse go back to the [ __ ]\nbreath let that thought go let the\njudgment go let the frustration go just\nfeel the breath where does it go\nyou\nyou\nright there we go that's your practice\nso now you express gratitude towards\nchat because chat has now helped you\nunderstand how your mind gets off track\nhow your mind experiences judgment how\nyour mind feels disturbed how you can be\nin a place of peace from meditating and\nthen rage a chat and then come back\nright we can't blame chat for what it is\ndo you blame a rain cloud for raining on\nyour parade like you can but chat is\nchat we can't you know like let's not\nblame them for being who they are it's\nnot their fault that they're you know\nconfused in Peppe hands and more Peppe\nhands and kacct\nI don't even know what that what\nattacked w-why is there a w lull w I\ndon't even there like some kind of\nhorrible bot that doesn't know what it's\nsaying right can't blame them for that\naccept them for they who they are okay\nso I've been practicing the meditation\ntechniques you've showed they've been\nvery therapeutic was wondering where to\nfind a good source for more of these\npractices I don't think there is a\nsource right so the meditation\ntechniques like I studied for seven\nyears to become a monk and I learned a\nlot of different techniques from a lot\nof different masters and it's kind of an\namalgamation of like lots of different\ntexts and books so unfortunately I don't\nhave a good source but I'm gonna make\none so I'm gonna I'm gonna cover like\nhopefully one day I'll cover all 112 and\nthen you'll have all of them okay so now\nwe're gonna actually go back to\ncomplacent verses content I think was\nthe question right so now we so I okay\nso if if we were like paying attention\nto mrs. interview earlier he was talking\nabout being determined right so\ndetermination comes from ambition and\nambition is like kind of a desire and\nlike a desire is sort of like a goal so\ngenerally speaking we think about\nourselves as being motivated by goals by\nthe accomplishment of a particular thing\nand complacency happens when you\naccomplish that goal and you kind of\ndon't have another goal complacency\nexists with a goal and achievement\noriented mindset like if you just think\nabout the word to be complacent is to\nlike not strive for something right like\nthat's what the word means so if you're\ncalm\nthen you're like you're not striving for\nsomething and so it implies that in\norder to achieve something you have to\nstrive and to strive is to try to\nachieve a goal and to achieve a goal as\na particular outcome orientation and so\nlike if you're content\ndoes that mean that you become\ncomplacent actually no because you start\noperating on a completely different axis\nso you start operating on the axis of\naction not goal so when I show up on\nstream I'm not complete like am i\ncomplacent no am i content like yeah I'm\nnot not Kentucky I'm not discontent like\nI show up and I enjoy myself and I have\na good time and I'm content with where I\nam and I'm not trying to achieve\nanything particular right I mean like I\nam in the sense that there's someone in\nfront of me and I try to talk to them\nand I try to answer questions so I'm\ntrying to like do goal like goals in a\nvery microscopic sense but I'm not like\ntrying to achieve anything and so I I\nthink the the way the simple answer is\nservice so complacency is about ambition\nand goals and service is not I mean\nservice can have goals too but like it's\nkind of like a different mindset right\nlike I'm here to help and I'm gonna help\nthe best way that I can and I could be\ncontent with that because I'm not\nexpecting to change anything I'm just\nhere to help and offer what I am I show\nup and I say this is what I am how can I\nhelp and for some people it's gonna help\nand for some people that's fine that's\ncontentment but I'm still motivated to\ndo it but I'm just motivated out of\nservice the other word for service is\nthe Dharma right so I do by Dharma so\npeople think that personal ambition is\nwhat leads to motivation and once you\nachieve that ambition and then you are\ncomplacent but you can operate from a\nplace of Dharma which is not about\npersonal ambition it can look a lot like\npersonal ambition but it's to serve so I\nshow up and I say like how can I help\nand then I try my best to like actually\ndo a good job and to grow but that\ndoesn't lead to complacency but it also\nkeeps me content because I'm trying to\njust do the best job that I can\nso Dharma is the Sun script word for\nduty or responsibility and I think\nrather than thinking about morality in\nterms of right and wrong I try to live\nmy life according to the anima to my\nduty or my responsibility and Dharma is\nkind of like it's it's complicated it's\na very complicated thing\nto figure out your Dharma the other\nthing about Dharma that I think is\nreally important is that Dharma allows\nyou to tolerate the hard things in life\nso most of the time we tend to gravitate\naway from pain and towards pleasure\nright like I don't want to apply for\nthis job because they could reject me I\ndon't want to ask this girl out because\nshe may say no so the avoidance of pain\nkeeps us from doing a lot of things\nthat's just how human beings work but\nDharma sort of says like I don't [ __ ]\ncare how you feel you have to do it\nbecause it's important right so like if\nI'm trying to impress a girl like let's\nsay I'm in medical school and like I'm\nattracted to someone and I want her to\nthink highly of me and so that's gonna\nshape all my behaviors in all kinds of\nweird ways like I'm gonna be like dress\na certain way and act a certain way you\nknow if I'm working in the emergency\nroom my favorite example of late and\nsomeone comes in with like with a\ngunshot wound and I have to like get in\nthere and do chest compressions and then\nafter I do chest compressions I'm gonna\nlike walk back to the call room and\nshe's gonna see me and I'm gonna be like\ndisheveled and covered in vomit and\nblood and I'm gonna look [ __ ] awful\nand smell awful but I don't [ __ ] care\nabout that because like I had to do the\nchest compressions like everything all\nof my personal [ __ ] goes away when\nI'm doing my enema like it just doesn't\nmatter you just do the thing that you\nneed to do so anonymize is just helps\nyou like helps you do the tough thing\nbecause it's more important than you so\nyou guys have to also understand it's\nlike if we think about like why you\navoid things in your life due to pain\nit's paying for you that's what causes\nyou to avoid right it's not paying for\nother people it's like paying for\nyourself that causes you to avoid and\nnot do the things that you need to do in\nfact most of the people that I work with\nmost of the gamers that I work with they\nwill do ten times as much for another\nhuman being as they're willing to do for\nthemselves if someone says hey man like\nI need to clean out my place and move\nout can you give me a hand they're like\nabsolutely dude I'm there can you clean\nyour own [ __ ] room no [ __ ] way\nbut you'll help someone else clean that\nroom because you're a good person it's\n[ __ ] weird right so why are you able\nto do that why is it so easy for you to\nclean someone's room if they ask for\nyour help but it's so hard to clean your\nown room it's because that's part of\nyour dogma you have a tournament to that\nand what gamers don't realize is that\nthey like don't have they don't have a\nDharma to themselves you owe this to\nyourself you owe yourself a life where\nyou get better you owe yourself a life\nof peace and contentment and happiness\nand success you owe that to yourself but\nyou're not willing to do it for yourself\nbecause you don't realize that you owe\nyourself that you blame yourself for not\nhaving it but that's not what the\ndynamic person says the dynamic person\ndoesn't say why the [ __ ] haven't you\ncleaned your room your dynamic person\nsays if you need help I'm there to help\nyou but as a gamer do you help yourself\nno you [ __ ] blame yourself like [ __ ]\nyou you suck at life\nwhy can't you beat Arabic to yourself\nwhy can't you be like hey man it looks\nlike you need some help you feel bad\nabout yourself like let me help you out\nlet's go to the grocery store why don't\nwe like eat something healthy so we feel\nbetter about ourselves why don't we do\nsome exercise like why don't we like\nclean up our room a little bit like you\nowe this to yourself man come on dude\nlike be your own best friend you don't\nknow how to do that that's because you\ndon't realize you have a Dharma to\nyourself you have learn about other\npeople but you don't understand your\nThommo to yourself\nso Dharma is an incredible source of\nstrength\nit's an incredible source of like power\nand tolerance for the negative\nokay\nall right so\nokay so now we get to the next question\nis the harm of the same as Dow or tau or\nthe way in doubt a chain is it the\ncurrent life the way of things of nature\nof universal patterned currents is it\nconnected to the flow State is it\nindicated by our emotions help us\nunderstand the Irma better okay so Parma\nis the same as doubt so I think that's\nthe same concept at its root it has\nslightly different manifestations\nI do think I you know it's been a long\ntime since I've studied the daodejing so\nI'm not quite sure exactly what the\ncurrent means but generally I think that\nall that [ __ ] is the same like it's\nthere all talking about the same stuff\nso I think like in the Sun script system\nthere's the Ottoman there's karma and I\nthink Dao kind of encapsulates both of\nthose because there's a part that's duty\nand then there's a part that's like kind\nof circumstance or environment and and\nmy sense of Dao is that like it's kind\nof like a combination sort of my meets\nkarma so Carter bar is like\ncircumstances it's the principle of\ncause and effect so it's like current so\nyou haven't thought about but then there\nare influences in your life that you\ndon't control which is your karma so I\nthink that's how those are related\nso when you say of nature of universal\npattern currents like that sounds like\noprich to me I don't know what that\nmeans like I don't I'm not saying that\nit's not a real thing it's just like\nsometimes people toss around these like\ngrandiose terms like universal patterns\nlike I don't know what is that I don't\nknow what that means\nso I use the Sun squits terminology\nbecause I think it's a little bit more\nprecise I mean it could be related to\nthat but I just don't I'm not familiar\nwith that terminology so I don't know is\nit connected to the flow State no so\nflow state is a state of mind karma is\nnot a state of mind Dharma is about like\nduty or responsibility or a guide for\naction Hana is a compass a flow state is\na state of being and while Dharma\ngenerally speaking allows you to\nfacilitate getting into a state of mind\nthey're like apples and oranges flow\nstate is a state of consciousness it's\nlike sleep wakefulness dreaming flow\nState right that's the category Dharma\nis not in that category\nDharma is about duty or responsibility\nit's sort of like a concept flow say to\nsome\nthat happens in your brain and karma is\nnot something that happens in your brain\nis it indicated by our emotions no\nDharma Dharma is what allows you to\ntolerate negative emotions but emotions\nare also a product of the mind or the\nbody they're not like Dharma sort of an\nabstract concept so these are good\nquestions because I don't think we think\nabout like what stuff is in my mind and\nwhat stuff is my life and what stuff is\noutside of my mind what are my emotions\nwhat are my thoughts all of this stuff\nhas to be understood like you have to\nunderstand like how this person that you\nare works you have thoughts you have\nemotions you have flow States you have\nstates of consciousness you have states\nof beings you have goals what's the\nrelationship between all of this stuff\nhow can we understand how emotions\nrelate to motivation how can we\nunderstand how states of mind relate to\nmotivation how can we understand how the\nanima relates to motivation how can we\nunderstand how karma relates to\nmotivation that's the goal of this\nstream is for us to unpack all of these\ndifferent things because we don't get\ntaught this stuff it blows my [ __ ]\nmind we get taught algebra but we don't\nget taught what the relationship between\nour mission and life a calling in life\nour emotions and our mindset we don't\nget taught that but I think that's\nreally like basic stuff that everyone\nneeds to understand what is the\nrelationship between a calling and your\nemotions yeah because we don't get\ntaught this stuff infuriates me no\nwonder no one knows what the [ __ ]\nthey're supposed to do in life like we\ndon't get taught how we work like we get\ntaught you can learn macroeconomics so\neasily\nyou cannot go outside and learn a\ndefinitive way in which your emotions\naffect your Dharma in which your\nemotions affect your behavior you you\ncan't they don't teach you that\ninteresting so they did social and\nemotional skills training for students\nthat accounted for they took a study of\n15,000 students half of them got we're\ngiven a class called social emotional\nskills training social emotional skills\ntraining is worth 1.1 GPA points\nmore than a whole letter grade they\nlooked at the GPAs of these students who\nare taught how like social and emotional\nskills and they get one letter grade\nhigher than the people who are not\ntaught crazy-crazy"
