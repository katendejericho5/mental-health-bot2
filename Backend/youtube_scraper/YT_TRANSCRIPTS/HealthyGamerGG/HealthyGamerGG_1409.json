    "transcript": "the strategy is not to let go of\nexpectations the strategy is to make it\nimpossible to have an expectation and\nthe way that you make it impossible to\nhave an expectation is to live in the\npresent to exist in the present to focus\non action instead of outcome\nwhat are your thoughts on nofap does\nHindus promote that and health or mental\nbetter\nI mean look so so I think that there\nthere was a question about Brahma Katya\nso well I'll get to know fat in a second\nokay let's switch to meditation okay\nafter passively meditating is a\nlifestyle for a long time is it normal\nto feel the inside of your brain the\nspot that is close to the reptilian\ncomplex also a sense of oneness and high\nintellect after passively meditating as\na lifestyle for a long time is it normal\nto feel the inside of your brain also a\nsense of oneness and high intellect the\nshort answer is sort of so it is\ncompletely normal after meditating\nproperly for years to feel things that\nother humans are you yourself have not\never felt before and to also have a\npersistent sensation of those things so\nI have some sensations which if you guys\nhave seen like okay we're going to just\ndo this we're gonna do this the third\neye meditation alright so we're gonna do\nsome meditation so you know in the\nspirit of like gorks\ninterview and sort of emphasizing\nexperience in order to answer this\nquestion because i imagine that many\npeople don't understand what the [ __ ]\nthis person is talking about let's just\ndo a meditation and see what happens so\nI want you all to sit up straight\nand do this\nokay and I want you to sit up straight\nand then hover your middle finger just\nlike a centimeter from your forehead and\nclose your eyes\ndon't touch\njust focus on the sensation of your\nforehead\nto see what you feel as you hold your\nfinger there not touching not too far\naway you can move it a little bit closer\na little bit further\nonce you feel something maybe you'll\nknow\nand what I want you to do is relax let\nyour hands come down and just focus on\nthat spot on your forehead\nyou\ncontinue focusing on the spot between\nyour eyebrows see if there are any\nlingering sensations\nyou\nyou\nokay\nso go ahead and come back\nso tell me guys what did y'all feel\nyeah man\nso this is like this is what's [ __ ]\nso like this is the thing you guys got\nunderstand when I went to India right so\nI was like failing out of college and\nall this good stuff when I went to India\nit was this stuff that made me fall in\nlove with meditation\nright like what is that like what what\nthe [ __ ] just happened\nlike what the [ __ ] is that like when\nGork breathes and feels warmth in his\nshoulders\nlike what is that\nlike what's going on here\nand if you guys didn't feel anything\nthat's perfectly fine so different\ndifferent feelings the different\nmeditation techniques are going to work\nfor different people\nright so like this is why we have\ndifferent kinds of meditation techniques\nbecause not all minds are the same not\nall people are the same so different\ntechniques are gonna work for different\npeople in different ways\nand if you guys felt something like what\ndoes that mean like is that the third\neye like I don't know like they're I\ndon't know I mean I I have ideas about\nwhat it is I have beliefs about what it\nis but there's no scientific evidence\nfor something being the third eye like\nthere's no such thing as the third eye\nright so this is what I would tell you\nthis is what we know about the science\nof meditation so there there is stuff\nabout what that is and if you guys\nreally want to know what that is we can\ntalk about it but yeah right so\nbut you guys feel something so this is\nimportant so you guys have to like think\nabout how did someone discover this\nconcept of the third eye with someone\nlike sitting down like there was a yogi\nlike thousands of years ago and he's\nlike you know what I'm gonna come up\nwith like this [ __ ] anime level\nconcept of something called a third eye\nand then like all these emotions in high\nschool are gonna watch it and think that\nthey're badass and then that's gonna be\na third eye no that's not how it works\nright so what happens is people meditate\nand then they start to experience things\nand if you guys had some kind of\nsensation they're like how would you\ndescribe that to someone that's where\nthe the phrase third eye comes from so\nthird eye is like a yogi sit sound and\nexplores that sensation I'm still blurry\nyeah I know I don't know why I'm blurry\nthere so it and so they try to come up\nlate and then what they do is they do\nthis practice over and over and over and\nover again okay and so this is what you\nguys do if you had a sensation you need\nto do this practice every day and as you\ndo this practice you'll start to learn\nmore you'll start to understand more so\nthe first thing to understand is that\nfor before you did the practice you had\nno idea what this was and your level of\nunderstanding sorry I gotta move because\nthis is gonna so you had no idea what it\nwas and you you didn't understand\nanything and then like you understand\nsomething now you don't even know what\nyou understand but it's like night and\nday the amount of knowledge or\nrealization that you've gained is like\nnight and day\nand as you continue to practice you'll\nstart to gain more things that are just\nas big you'll start to understand things\nyou'll start to like figure stuff out\nyou'll learn more about yourself and\nthen as you practice for a long time\nthen like this person is it normal to\nfeel the inside of your brain you're\ngonna start to experience things that\nyou don't normally don't experience\nokay and then can you say can you have a\nsense of oneness and high intellect\nabsolutely you can also get all kinds of\nother sensations I would say start with\nthree to five minutes a day okay yeah\nright so like this is what I love about\nstream is someone can ask a question or\nif I just sit here and I [ __ ] answer\nit after passively meditating as a\nlifestyle for a long time is it normal\nto feel the inside of your brain and I\ncould answer I could say yeah but like\nthat doesn't help anyone doesn't help\nanyone right this is where like if you\nguys want to understand meditation I can\nanswer questions or you guys can just\nsit and meditate and then you'll get all\nthe answers yourself how can you get\nshining on you do third eye practices so\nthis is I'm gonna let you guys Center on\na little secret\nso sixteen years ago I started doing\nthird eye practices and I did them very\nvery religiously for lack of a better\nterm and also let you guys know\nsomething else I'm actually a mediocre\npsychiatrist I'm not actually a very\ngood psychiatrist the reason I think I\ncan do what I do on stream is because I\ndo third eye meditation so I think it\ngives me an advantage over my colleagues\nright like you guys just think about\nthis like who can come on stream and\njust like talk to someone for 45 minutes\nand and like understand them and\neveryone thinks it's because I'm a\nHarvard Andy that's not Harvard it's\nbecause I do like honestly I believe\nit's because I do third eye practices I\nthink it helps me understand people\nthat's part of the reason because I\nstarted seeing things about people that\nlike my other people didn't see and I\ngot curious about it yeah and so I think\nas you guys start to meditate and\nthere's some preliminary evidence of\nthis that meditation does improve EQ\nright and improves emotional quotient\nand all of this like like so like how\ndoes that work so there's some\nneuroscientific I'm sure there's\nsomething going on like I don't think I\nhave like a mystical power although you\ncan talk about that kind of stuff I\nthink all these things that people talk\nabout in terms of like mystical powers\nhave neuroscience cordless so if you do\nheart chakra meditation your capacity\nfor compassion increases I'm actually\nlike not a super compassionate person\nand I just I do a lot of meditation\npractices are out understanding because\nI want to understand that's what I care\nabout okay all right I'm genuinely\ninterested in meditation and have tried\nsome of the pointers that you've given\nin the past but I don't know if I'm\ndoing it wrong or not mostly because I\ndon't know what indicates that I'm doing\nit right okay so the first thing is you\ndon't have to feel so some of twitch at\nfelt something right and this is like\nthe first time I taught this practice I\nthink the best description that someone\ncame up with is it feels like I'm\ncharging my laser beam you're charging\nup your laser beam so the first thing to\nunderstand is that just because you do a\npractice and you don't feel something\nmystical or spiritual doesn't mean that\nyou're doing it wrong okay what we're\nshooting for is not necessarily\nspiritual experience because that's not\na good reason to practice the most basic\nreason to meditate is to control your\nattention and if you can keep your\nattention focused on one thing for a\nprolonged period of time then that's\nreally the goal and even if you can't\nkeep it focused on one thing then you're\nstill actually doing a good job because\nlike if you do a practice like let's say\nI'm telling you guys to concentrate on\nyour forehead and my mind starts to\nwander and then what happens is I\nremember and I'm like oh I'm supposed to\nbe concentrating on the forehead so I\nbring the mind back\nthat's like doing a push-up the mind\nwanders and I bring it back the mind\nwanders and I bring it back the mind\nwanders and I bring it back so even if\nyou can't keep your attention focused\nevery time you bring the mind back to\nwhat you want it to you're you're\npracticing controlling your attention\nit's like doing one pushup and so oddly\nenough even people who don't think that\nthey're meditating properly because\ntheir mind wanders a lot they're the\nones who are actually like working out\nthe most because you're like bringing it\nback you're bringing it back you're\nbringing it back and eventually you'll\nget good at keeping it there so ideally\nyou'll have some kind of weird like\npsycho spiritual experience which is\nlike cool and trippy but at the end of\nthe day what you're trying to Train is\nyour attention the other thing to think\nabout is if you've entered a no mind\nstate like if your mind kind of shuts\noff you're not asleep but you're aware\nand like time seems to cease to exist\nthoughts seem to cease to exist that's\nwhat you're shooting for as well so\nthat's really what you're going for\nthese concentration of attention and\nenter in no mind states the spiritual\nstuff is like unreliable next question\nwhat's a good meditation practice that\ndoesn't involve focusing on the\nsensation of breathing the one that I\njust taught go back and watch the vaad\nso focusing on your third eyes good you\ncan focus on meditations on sound if you\nwant to so you can do chanting I guess\ntechnically I mean that involves\nbreathing but you know so I'd say third\neye practice is good yoga is also an\nexcellent form of meditation so if you\nguys do yoga and you don't like breath\nmeditations that's fine if you guys want\nto do another practice a hard practice\nthis is one that I've taught before it's\ncatch the moment of sleep so this is a\ndifferent brand of practice this is like\nan investigatory practice and for some\npeople who don't like to just do\nsomething there's another kind of\npractice that you can give them where\nthey have to figure something out\nlike Gork is one of these people where\nhe's gonna respond really well to\ninvestigate a practices\nso if I give Gorka meditation practice\nin order for him to focus his mind he's\ngonna respond well if I tell him to\nfigure something out to pay attention to\nhimself and tell me what he discovers\nbecause that's gonna restrain his\nattention and he's gonna like look\nbecause he likes to be good so I would\nsay that I would say that catch the\nmoment of sleep if you guys want a hard\none so you're laying down you close your\neyes and you're awake you're awake\nyou're awake you're awake and then you\nfall asleep right there's a moment\nyou're awake and there's a moment you're\nasleep\nso catch that transition where you feel\nyourself falling asleep and find the\nprecise moment of sleep haha everyone's\nasking that's a paradox is that even\npossible what if I were to tell you guys\nthat like if you hover your finger over\nyour forehead you'll start to feel like\na warm sensation or a trickling or a\nvibration or energy it sounds the same\nright so this is the thing this is the\nwhole reason I'm giving you guys this\npractice because everyone in this world\nright now is hyper ly analytical we use\nour minds and our logic and our\nreasoning to figure out everything so\nwhat I'm trying to teach you guys is\nexperience that's what Gork needs right\nthat's what you guys need if you want to\nchange it starts with experience so\ndon't tell me it's a paradox go and try\nit and then try it again and try it\nagain and try it again and try it again\nthen you'll learn then you'll understand\nthen you'll see okay so once saying I\ntried that as a kid [ __ ] is impossible\nhuh I wonder what else was impossible\nwhen you were a kid do you think that if\nsomething is impossible when you're a\nkid\nit remains impossible for the rest of\nyour life do you think that like maybe\nsomething changes as you get older hmm\nnah you tried it as a kid I'm sure\nnothing will change so you might as well\nnot try yeah like you know when I was 13\nI asked this girl out and she said no so\nI might as well never ask anyone out\nagain\ncuz I had acne and I didn't know how did\nI try to do surgery once I remember\nthey're like you know like this is\nactually no longer funny but you have\nsomeone around you is like dying when\nyou're a kid and you tried to save their\nlife and it didn't succeed it's like I\ntried that once as a kid that didn't\nwork right so yeah so like you tried it\nas a kid try it again if it didn't work\nas an adult try it again try try try\nokay\nso here's here's the no.5 question so\nsomeone is asking about brahmacharya so\nI saw this question on brahmacari and I\ndecided to table the no fat question so\nbrahmacarya is usually is a Sanskrit\nword that's usually translated as\ncelibacy but it doesn't truly mean\ncelibacy so brahmacarya is like a lot of\npeople think it means celibacy because\nin other religions there's a word for\ncelibacy there's really not a good\ntranslation for Brahman in English the\nclosest thing is celibacy what Brahma\nbrahmacarya really means is to dwell in\nBrahma\nso to dwell in the infinite\nconsciousness and so what brahmacharya\nreally means as it relates to sex is non\nlustfulness so it means keeping your\nmind in a state where you don't have\nlust so and actually someone can be a\nbrahmacari and still have sex according\nto my interpretation it's just you can't\nbe lustful so Brahma acharya a lot of\nspiritual strength in a lot of\ntraditions comes from bromwich Arya\nthat's why like if you look at like many\nreligions have kind of celibacy as a\npart of their spiritual path you know so\nI I mean I think that there's a lot that\ncomes from that I mean there's some\ntheories about you know if you think\nabout like the life creating force of\nsemen is like an energy that we expend\nwhen like that's the capacity to create\nlife I'm not saying any this is right or\nwrong I'm just sharing with you guys a\nparticular view so that like you know\nsweat like men for example like so we\nhave the capacity to create new life\nthrough semen\nand then so if we think about like\nBromwich Aria if you stop like sending\nthat energy out then it stays within you\nand then you kind of like can become\nspiritually powerful as a result I'm not\nsaying that that's right or wrong or\nindifferent but that's the idea behind\nBromwich Aria and I think that you know\nfocusing your mind outside of lust can\nbe very helpful because you can focus it\non other things so okay so then the\nquestion now we go to the nofap question\nright so he's asking like what do I\nthink about no fat so let me think about\nthere's no fat ah can't find the no fat\nanyway someone was asking about no fat\nokay\nso here's what I think about no fat so I\nthink like you have to understand that\nas a human being\nyou're controlled like your behavior is\ncontrolled by all kinds of things and\ngenerally speaking when you have in the\nbasic problem that a lot of people have\nis that they have like intentions in\ntheir ability to make their intention or\nreality is like weak so if you put your\nmind to something it doesn't get done\nthat's the basic problem so I think the\nbiggest advantage of no fat is it gives\nyou a chance to grapple with that part\nof your mind which wants to do something\nit gives you a chance to conquer your\nmind it gives you a chance to fight with\nyour mind so if we were thinking about\ngorks interview you know like he has\nthese forces within him which drive him\nto do things like the sense of\ninadequacy the anger towards himself and\nthose forces control him so I think the\nbiggest advantage of nofap is that it\ngives you a chance to understand how you\nwork where does the desire to jerk off\ncome from what does it gravitate towards\nlike does it gravitate towards\npornography but like is it the porn that\ncreates the desire or is the porn a\nsatisfaction of the desire\nright so if we think about like if I'm\nhungry and I want to eat a hamburger the\ndesire to eat the hamburger in the\nhunger or independent things so with no\nfat you know like I think it's useful\nbecause you start to ask yourself these\nquestions you're like where does the\ndesire to jerk off come from what do I\ndo with that desire how do I feel\nafterward I think it can be a good\nexample of something that you can\nexplore to help yourself understand how\nyou function as a human being as far as\nthe health benefits and stuff I honestly\ndon't know like I haven't looked at any\ndata that's that really suggests you\nknow like what kind of physical or\nmental health benefits happen with\nmasturbation or lack of masturbation\nwhat I do know is that generally\nspeaking like masturbation is a\nrelatively normal like matically is like\nviewed as a relatively normal part of\nyou know human behavior this is for boys\nonly no so I mean when I say jerk off\nsorry you know I should say masturbate\nbut it applies to women too okay so what\nis Kundalini so here's another question\nso let me just actually ask so we're\ngonna talk about Kundalini Shakti in a\nsecond okay so what's happening we're\ngetting graded\nhmm okay no you don't have to be an\ninterview to us I mean you don't have to\nbe a streamer to interview most like 90%\nof people that we interview are not\nstreamers or maybe that's not that high\nmaybe it's like 75 rated present but I\nwant to say like like three out of four\npeople that we interview or not\nstreamers yes so thanks for the rain who\nraided us xcalibur II thank you do you\nguys have business person have a\nquestion\nCX boggers thank you\nthanks for the right welcome to the\nhealthy gamers stream my name is all\nokay noise I'm a psychiatrist and what I\ndo on this stream is not actually\ndispense medical advice and you guys\ncame in at a weird time because some so\nwe talked a lot about mental health and\nhelping people understand how they work\nhow their minds work I interview people\non the stream people who are struggling\nin some way and tried to give them an\ninsight into like how they can move\nforward in their life we talk a lot\nabout meditation and if you guys just\njoined the stream it was weird it's no\nwe don't usually talk about sexual stuff\nbut someone had asked about celibacy in\nthe context of meditation and there was\nanother question about nofap and what I\nthought about that so I was kind of\nexplaining like how celibacy works from\nan Eastern spiritual tradition and then\ndoing you know talking a little bit\nabout masturbation because there's a\nquestion about no-fat so I do QA and we\ndo a lot of meditation on stream and\nthings like that so what is Kundalini\nso Kundalini is this so there's this\nidea that we have the spiritual energy\nthat's seated at the base of our spine\nand the imagery for Kundalini is it's\nlike a serpent that's coiled and as you\ndo spiritual practice the the kundalini\nshakthi Shakti means energy so it's to\nrise along the back of your spine it\ngoes through your different chakras as\nit goes through a chakra it activates a\nchakra and when it reaches the top of\nyour head you become enlightened that's\nthe basic idea behind Kundalini\nKundalini Yoga is about sort of\ndeveloping and harnessing different\nkinds of energy so the third eye\npractice that we were doing earlier is a\nis a Kundalini practice I really like\nKundalini Yoga because I've get to feel\ncool things when I do it and I just I\nlike the way yeah it's cool I feel like\nI gained a lot from it but kundalini\nyoga and meditation should really only\nbe practiced under the guidance of a\nguru and can be one of the things that\ncan be very dangerous so I don't think a\nlot of people realize this but\nmeditation can be dangerous\nthere actually case reports of\nmeditation induced psychosis so people\ngoing crazy from meditating and we're\ngonna be research nd again\nokay so meditation is dangerous so you\nshould be careful and one of the and I\nthink Kundalini Yoga is a good example\nof stuff that like you have to be\ncareful about so its chakra and real\nnote so in Naruto they refer to chakra\nbut without what I think they really\nmean is like chi or prana that's like\nthey're not using the right word they're\nusing their like garbling the lingo a\nchakra is actually like a gate that chi\nor prana travels through\n[Music]\nokay\nnerd took POG yeah absolutely the Chunin\nexam is fantastic man\ntreating an exam is some of the best\nanime I've ever seen really good falls\nlaughter that might be\nyeah you guys don't think yeah I know\nsome stuff about thumb throw I do some\nthunder it practices so yeah like so I\ndon't think you guys understand who\nyou're dealing with\nall you guys see is the research Andy he\ngot something that the Naruto Andy\nand yeah Rock Lee he's the guy with the\nweird hair right\nseminal kung-fu and semen retention no\nidea man I don't know what that is okay\nlet's do so we're gonna do like 10 or 15\nmore minutes and then I got to stop\nbecause I got to work tomorrow so let's\nsee okay let's go to procrastination\nexpectations\ncommitting to long-term okay\nso how do I stop procrastinating my life\nis in ruins because of it okay\nso the first thing to understand is that\nso a lot of times when we talk on stream\nI try to explain to people that like the\nthings that they think are wrong with\nthem or actually like right right so\nprocrastination you guys have to\nunderstand this procrastination is not a\nproblem it's a solution so let's just\ndefine procrastination for a second what\nis what is procrastination mean\nprocrastination is waiting until the\nlast minute to get things done right\nit's like doing a half-assed job with\nlike too little time at the end so but\nif you think about it like\nprocrastination is actually an\nincredibly efficient way of going about\ndoing things because let me just think\nabout this let's just think about this\nfor a second so if I have the option of\nlike studying hard every day and getting\nan A on test or I can cram the weekend\nbefore the test and get a B like which\none do you think is actually more\nefficient like your brain is like okay\nwe could do all this work for an A or we\ncould do like a third of the work for a\nB let's just let's just do the beat\nright or the C\nlike let's just pass man so\nprocrastination is actually a very very\nefficient way to move through life your\nbrain is kind of telling you like I\ndon't have to worry about that now like\nwhy don't I just worry about it when it\nmatters and instead of that like I'm\njust gonna do what matters now like I\ncan play like I can either two ways that\nI can do this I can work on this project\nevery day or I can wait until the\nweekend and just play World of Warcraft\nor overwatch or dota today like that's\nthe better route so the cool thing about\nprocrastination so that like this is how\nI dealt with my procrastination is that\nI stopped fighting against it and I\nstarted doing it more so if you guys are\nstuck in procrastination what you need\nto do is procrastinate more not less and\nlet's just think a little bit about what\nthat means I don't mean like wait until\nlike closer and closer to the end what\nI'm saying is have more things to\nprocrastinate about so if you only\nrequire if if it doesn't take you like\ninstead of studying for one week for a\ntest if you only need to study for one\nweekend instead of taking one class what\nyou need to do is take three classes\nbecause every three days you can study\nfor a test so you need to increase the\namount of work that you do and make it\nso that every day is the last day before\nsomething\nmake it so that every day it's like\nsomething is due the next day so I'll\ngive you guys an example for my own life\nI'm telling you it's [ __ ] crazy\nso my second year of college I was\ntaking half a normal course load so I\nwent to the University of Texas at\nAustin and a normal course load is 15\nhours okay so my sophomore year I took\nnine between six and nine hours and I\ngot like cease cease basically and I was\nthinking like okay if I have a lighter\ncourse load I can do better right and\nthen like my last year of college\ninstead of taking the 15 hours I took\nthirty or twenty-eight one of the two\nand I was a research assistant and I\nstudied for the MCAT and took the MCAT\nand was it and was doing research so I\nwas like a TA and I was doing research\nand like you guys may think like oh my\ngod that's terrible\nand oh this is important so you guys\nthink I'm wicked smart right but that's\nactually not true it's actually not true\nthe difference is that like I just\ncouldn't procrastinate like I had no\nchoice no I'm not a [ __ ] genius this\nis important you guys so this is listen\nto what you're doing right you guys are\nanswering with logic instead of\nexperience you're doing it again you're\ndoing it again this is wrong so what I\nrealized is that I'm gonna I'm not gonna\nstudy before like the weekend before the\ntest and now I would have been a genius\nif I got a 4.0 like my GPA was like a\n3.0 I ended up getting a B and just\nabout all my classes and that that's the\nthing right like if you guys are waiting\ntil the last minute just do more [ __ ]\nlike that's the solution of\nprocrastinating\ndon't stop procrastinating the problem\nis that you guys don't have enough\ndeadlines like understand this\nprocrastination is waiting until the\ndeadline to do it so set yourself up\nwith a deadline every three days\nactually try it actually try it and then\nget back to me now a lot of people are\nsaying oh like it's so stressful you're\ndamn right it's stressful but are we\ntalking about stress are we talking\nabout productivity are we talking about\ngetting stuff done or having an easy\nlife let's be clear I'm not saying that\nyour life isn't gonna be stressful I'm\nnot saying that it's gonna be\ncomfortable I'm not talking about that\nat all I'm talking about productivity\nproduction how much you accomplished in\na short amount of time\nah so someone asks a beautiful question\nwhat if I have four deadlines in three\ndays so let me ask you guys what has\nactually happened when you guys are\n[ __ ] procrastinating and you have\nfour deadlines and if you finals week\nright like what do you do for finals\nweek\nyou don't actually wait until the day\nbefore even you're procrastinating\n[ __ ] brain will start studying like a\nweek in advance because you have you\nknow that well if you guys are not\nshowing up like I did that too like I\ndidn't show up for my fan of Spanish\nfinal my freshman year but as you start\nto procrastinate more and more like as\nyou as you pile on stuff you'll be\nsurprised try it and see what happens so\nand and if you guys are feeling like\noverwhelmed and stuff and you don't show\nup I think there are different problems\nso that I don't think it's a it's the\nreason for I don't think it's the reason\nthat you I don't like its\nprocrastination that causes you to not\nshow up but I do think that one of the\nsimplest solutions to procrastination is\nto actually stagger your deadlines more\nand to do more and then you'll\nautomatically become more productive so\nif depression and stuff like that are\ninvolved if not showing up is involved\nif shame is involved like that's the\nreason I didn't show up to my Spanish\nfinal it's not because I procrastinate\nit's because I was ashamed there are\nother reasons why you don't show up to\nfinals\nand I would just I'd say try it so if\nyou if you procrastinate this is what I\nwould concretely recommend that you do\nyou try doing 50% more try doing 50%\nmore and see what happens okay next\nquestion last question how do I let go\nof expectations so I don't set myself up\nfor disappointment\nokay great question so understand that\ndepression comes sorry a disappointment\ncomes from expectation there can be no\ndisappointment without expectation right\nif someone tells me like oh this movie\nis super awesome this game is super\nawesome and it gets pumped up a lot and\nthen I go and play I'm gonna be\ndisappointed\nyeah procrastinating those expectations\nabsolutely so here's what I do so\nremember that expectations are about\noutcomes right so an expectation is like\nan outcome so like I want to get an A in\na class I want this I want to ask this\nperson out and I want them to say yes\nthat's what an expectation is it's an\noutcome so the way that you free\nyourself from expectations and the other\nthing to understand about expectations\nis that they they were in no man's sky\ndamn right\nyou want to talk about expectations no\nman's sky yeah but so people could say\nexpect nothing but how do you\npractically do that you can't just say\nlike okay I'm gonna wake up and expect\nnothing no it doesn't work like that\nit's the other thing to understand is\nthat expectation is about the future\nright you can't have expectations about\nthe present it's literally impossible\nexpectation is about the future so how\ndo you get past expectation some someone\nsaying you expect the worst\nno you focus on action not on outcome\nyou focus on doing not getting because\nyou can't stop your mind from doing\nsomething but you can change your minds\ndirection right the way that we meditate\nthe goal of meditation is to clear our\nmind but you can't tell your mind to be\nclear you have to focus it on something\nand then the\nclarity comes so the way that you get\naway from expectation is by focusing on\naction so I want to get an A in the\nclass how can we reframe that to an\naction I'm gonna go to class everyday\nand I'm gonna study for an hour every\nday that's an action it's not about an A\nit's about doing I mean even then that's\nan expectation right because I say every\nday so every day is about the future\nthat's expectation you're sending\nyourself up for an expectation so you\ncan't study you can't go to class every\nday it is literally impossible to go to\nclass every day it is not possible you\ncan only go to class today\nyou can only study now right action can\nonly take place in the present action\ncannot take place in the future can only\ntake place in the present and so what\nyou need to do is focus on today go to\nclass today study for an hour today\nyou can't even study for an hour that's\nin the future what you can do is go to\nthe library you can get up right now you\ncan walk away from the stream and then\nyou can go to the library and as you go\nto the library you can sit down you can\nopen the book and you can start to read\nyou can do that you can't study for an\nhour you can't study for a year you\ncan't study for a decade you can only\nstudy now and the more that you focus on\nyeah adios because we're gonna be\nshutting off soon so the more that you\nfocus on the action the more that you\nfocus on the present the more impossible\nit becomes to have an expectation the\nstrategy is not to let go of\nexpectations the strategy is to make it\nimpossible to have an expectation and\nthe way that you make it impossible to\nhave an expectation is to live in the\npresent to exist in the present to focus\non action instead of outcome you can't\nlose 50 pounds it's impossible to lose\n50 pounds you can go to the gym today I\ncan do a push-up today right you can\nonly focus on the present\nso remember that"
