    "transcript": "okay so I'm gonna read a couple of\nquestions okay and then we're gonna try\nto talk about all of them together so\nthe first thing is can we talk about\nfear how does it work I noticed fear\nmight be related to the subject\nabsolutely next question is I've dealt\nwith a feeling of apathy towards new\nthings and I want to do or try and when\nI do start something I quickly lose\ninterest how do i combat this how do I\ntell if I'm truly unhappy or just bored\nor used to the way things being the way\nthey are and then this is kind of the\nlast question I'll kind of lump together\nhow do you get past coming up short with\neverything in your life I'm 26\ndropped out of college at a good\nuniversity with one semester left we\ndecided to start a successful business\nand I'm now debating on selling my\nshares to my friend and business partner\nwith nothing lined up after one year\nit's the slow season I haven't left my\nhouse in two weeks video games bla bla\nbla bla okay so how do you get past\ncoming up short in life how do you deal\nwith fear how do you function if you've\ndeveloped apathy towards something how\ndo you tell if you're unhappy or just\nbored or used to the way things are so\nthese are all great questions and\nthere's just like a common theme here\nand I'm gonna have to think about how to\npiece this stuff together okay so what\nwhat gets us to do stuff in life like\nthat's the common question right you\nhave this like idea of something that\nyou want to do and like how do you\nactually do that thing like you say that\nokay like I'm I'm enjoyment doesn't move\nme forward I've gotten used to things\nI've become apathetic about stuff\nI don't want to move forward because I'm\nafraid I don't want to move forward\nbecause I regret and the answer is like\nyes\nyes all of that is true so the first\nthing to understand is that moving\nforward in life is like going to be an\nindividual exploration\nright that like you guys can come on\nstream and like I can try to answer\nthese questions and I do answer these\nquestions but that at the end of the day\nlike you're gonna have to do actual\nreflection to figure out what is getting\nin your way\nso generally speaking so I'm gonna just\naddress one part of this right because\nthere are a couple of questions about\nyou know feeling apathy towards a new\nstuff getting bored or getting used to\nthings so I want you guys to understand\nthat one of the things that motivates\nhuman beings is the satisfaction of\ndesires okay so like if I want to eat\nlike let's say I'm hungry and I want to\neat a hamburger I have a desire\nI eat the hamburger and then the desire\nfrom the for the hamburger is satisfied\nand once the desire for the hamburger is\nsatisfied\nthere's nothing motivating me to like\ncontinue eating like sort of makes like\nit sounds kind of simple and duh but\nlike just think about that for a second\nso anytime you're motivated by the\nsatisfaction of a particular desire that\nmotivation is not going to last you'll\nend up in apathy you'll end up being\nbored you'll end up being used to things\nif you're looking for like the\nsatisfaction of a particular desire then\nyou're gonna end up being bored or\napathetic and it's not a sustainable way\nto build your life but the interesting\nthing is that's how we do structure our\nlives right we tend to think that like\nthe way for me to move forward is by\nlike satisfying my desires by striving\nfor things whether it be a hamburger or\ngraduating from college or like to get\nsomething external\nso there's another kind of motivation\nwhich doesn't come from the external\nworld so desires come from the external\nworld the roots of desires are actually\nthe indriyas or the sense organs and we\ncan debate about this if you guys want\nto but if you think about basically\nanything in there I've talked about this\nbefore on streams but if your source of\nmotivation is the external world once\nthe external world is satisfied or\nunsatisfied your motivation is going to\ngo away because it's dependent on\nsomething external so fundamentally you\ndon't get the option to control like\nwhat you're doing because your\nmotivation comes from the outside so the\nkey here is to understand that like\nmotivation can come from the inside as\nwell not just from the satisfaction of\nan like a desire by an external thing\nand there are even a lot of things that\nwe think are going to be like that we\nthink of as internal like let's say I'm\nattracted to someone and I like want\nthem to be in in my life in some\nsubstantial way like I want them to be\nmy girlfriend or a boyfriend or whatever\nand so I like I'm drawn to that external\nthing and\nlet's say that I asked them out and they\nsay yes and we enter a relationship and\nit's like going great for a while and\nlike sometimes you get bored of it right\nlike you become apathetic and that's\nbecause the thing that is going to\nsustain a relationship is not the\noriginal desire for the relationship\nit's like if I think someone is hot and\nI like I want to get with them like once\nI get with them then I'm going to get\nbored because the satisfy it's the\nsatisfaction of an external desire the\nthings that sustain relationships are\ndifferent right it's sort of like this\nsense of like it's not a specific\nexternal thing it's I mean so I think\nthe best thing about being in a\ncommitted relationship is that you've\ngot someone in your corner\nthat's not like an external thing you\ndon't like look at someone on the street\nand you say like oh man like I want that\nperson to be in my corner like that's\nnot how a desire works that's not really\na desire you can say I want to sleep\nwith that person I want to make out with\nthat person I want to walk into my\noffice Christmas party with that person\non my arm those are all desires\nbut if you want to create sustained\nenjoyment or motivation in life it has\nto come from within and I don't mean\nthat in like a yoga hippy kind of like\nOprah sort of way like you have to find\nthe answer within I mean like literally\nthere are things that that pull you\nforward in life and some of those things\nare external and some of those things\nare internal because when it comes to\ncreating something meaningful in life it\nrequires sacrifice and the problem is\nthat most desires are not enough to\ngarner sacrifice\nif we talk if we think about Derek and\nother people on stream like the reason\nthat they grow is because they go within\nand they do the hard thing they talk\nabout the hard thing they deal with the\nhard feelings and if you guys were\nwatching today like you'd see Derek do\nit like go back and watch the vaad and\nyou'll see there are lots of moments\nwhere he's at the fork in the road and I\ntell him hey man we can go there or we\ncan not go there\nand he chooses to go there so he chooses\nto dive in word and so if you're getting\nbored in life if you're feeling\napathetic chances are it's because\nyou're you're living a life of\nsatisfaction of desires and once you\nsatisfy a desire it goes away for a\nwhile and then it returns again it\ndoesn't leave you satisfied forever and\nso if you want to find a way to like\nmove forward in a sustainable way to\nfind like real motivation that causes\nyou to - you know sacrifice things and\ngive up things and do make the harder\nchoice to close out of the video game\nwhen it's time to go to bed you have to\nhave a good [ __ ] reason it's not a\ndesire it's like an internal driver\nso in my case like you know I you know\nI'm lazy like I've I keep on saying this\non stream I don't think people like\nbelieve me but I'm lazy like I'm really\nlazy but I get out of bed every morning\nI get out of bed every morning at the\nlatest possible minute like I should\nwake up an hour earlier and work out but\nI just I'm [ __ ] lazy so why do I get\nout of bed it's because I have an\nappointment and someone's gonna show up\nat my office and I care about that\nperson and like because I care about\nthat person and like Jack I'm genuinely\ninvested in them I have to get my ass\nout of bed I don't care about my son\nmyself\nso I don't wake up and like work out and\nstuff because those are the things that\nI kind of want for myself but I actually\ndo care about that person\nright so that can motivate so what I\nwant you guys to understand is like\nstart by thinking a little bit about you\nknow what are the things that\nokay\nokay so start by understanding like what\nabout you is being motivated by\nsomething external and what about you is\nbeing motivated by something internal\nand chances are\nfor those of you who are apathetic and\nbored your motivation is an internal\nit's something it's coming from the\nexternal world"
