    "transcript": "and so we're about to do QA so this is a\nweird question but let me just think\nabout okay so let's do some questions\nabout meditation because we just\nmeditated I always thought meditation\nwas some kind of [ __ ] where people\nsay they reach some whole new level of\nholiness and all of that can you put it\nin a simple way why should regular\npeople meditate once in a while yeah\nabsolutely\nso if you guys want the simplest reason\nto meditate the goal of meditation is to\nactually be conscious without the\nfunction of the mind so to be conscious\nwithout thinking so understand that your\nmind is the thing that thinks the mind\nis the thinking machine and this may\nneed more questions I mean you guys may\nhave to ask more questions I'm happy to\nexplain more but the simplest reason to\nmeditate is because you need to spend\ntime outside of your mind so understand\nthat anxiety sadness depression all of\nthose happen within the mind right those\nare products of the mind and so\nmeditation gives you a state of being\nthat is completely outside of mind so\nall of the stuff that comes out of mind\ncannot exist when you're in that state\nof meditation hopes dreams love\nattachment expectations desires sadness\nanxiety all of that [ __ ] gets wiped away\nwhen you meditate that's why you should\nmeditate because your brain deserves a\nbreak from you\nthat's why you should meditate right\nthat's the simplest reason about the\nsimplest reason that's it so let's talk\nabout that for a second we think we are\nour minds and if we think we are we our\nsense of identity has to do with our\nmind so I identify certain things like\nI'm a doctor I'm a Boomer apparently I'm\na gamer I'm a father I'm a psychiatrist\nI'm a slacker I'm a legend to scrub on\ndota these are the ways that identify\nwith myself right and each of those\nthings comes like brings attachments\nwith it and those attachments can lead\nto like comment some kind of suffering\nso to meditate is to be like neutral is\nto find like a part of like the truest\nversion of yourself because each of\nthose statements about myself are can\nlike change over time like those are not\nthe real me like one day I may not be a\nlegend to scrub I may be like an ancient\none scrub I used to be ancient by the\nway before I you know had kids and stuff\nfor K MMR back in the day like 5 years\nago back when I used to play dota and\none day I may not be a physician one day\nI may not be a father one day I may not\nbe a Boomer right I may learn how to use\nthe internet one day and so all of these\nparts of our identity are fluctuating\nlike they change like I feel like I'm\nsuccessful I feel like I'm a failure\nlike maybe one day I get banned from\ntwitch and then I'm like I'm not a\ntwitch streamer anymore so all of that\nwhen we think about ourselves we think\nabout a lot of things that we believe\nare permanent but aren't actually\npermanent they're temporary so how do\nyou find out what you really are how do\nyou find the thing that is completely\nstable and is the real you because all\nthe others all the other [ __ ] can change\nsense of identity like even things that\nwe used to think we're super stable like\na sense of gender identity is fluid\nright people like grow up thinking that\nthey're a man and then one day they wake\nup and they're like I'm a woman trapped\nin a man's body fine so identity\nfluctuates so how do you find the real\nyou you meditate because all of that\nstuff exists within the mind and when\nyou meditate all of that stuff goes away\nand you see the fundamental experience\nof who you are\nand that changes you so I'll tell you\nguys something like so this was kind of\nmy journey to understanding this as I\nlearned how to meditate and then um my\nfather passed away and I remember being\nlike really really sad this was about\neight years ago so I was like filled\nwith grief and stuff cuz he's my dad and\nhe was super proud like he won he was a\ndoctor and he wanted me to go to medical\nschool and then I got into medical\nschool and like the day that I called\nhim and I told him I got in and he like\nwept he was just so happy for me\nand then about eight months later he\npassed away so when I was a first year\nmedical student so I remember like\nflying back to Texas from Boston and I\nwatched his so I went to the funeral and\nso then there's his corpse right and I\nsaw his corpse and I broke down crying\nand then like while I was crying I was\nlike let me try to meditate real quick\nand sometimes when I meditated I I had\nthis sense of like vast emptiness within\nme it was kind of comforting but it was\njust like this vast like ocean of just\nlike nothingness it's hard to describe\nthe way I would describe is I felt like\nI was a star in the sky which doesn't\nmake any sense unless you've experienced\nit it's like trying to explain an orgasm\nto someone who hasn't had sex they're\njust never gonna get it right so I had\nthis experience and then I I was I was\nlike okay right now like this is like\nI'm filled with grief can I still find\nthat thing so I meditated and then sure\nenough like that part that I felt that\nwas meditating was exactly the same it\nwas like exactly the same and I felt\nlike completely peaceful and on top of\nthe peace I felt like this overwhelming\ngrief it's a really bizarre thing to\ndescribe and then one month later I got\nmarried I mean the wedding was planned\nit wasn't like you know I was like so\nlike grief distraught that I proposed or\ngot someone pregnant so I was gonna get\nmarried\nit's like planned and then it was sort\nof a you know people were like it was\nkind of bittersweet because obviously my\ndad had just passed away and then I like\npresumably I was super happy like I was\ngetting married I was having a lot of\nfun and then when I was like supposedly\nwhat like one of the happiest moments of\nmy life I stopped and I meditated and I\nfound that same sensation\nthat there is a part of me that is\nconstant and that that is the real me\nand that everything else above all of\nthe experiences of life sadness\nhappiness success failure devastation\njoy underneath all of that is something\nthat is constant that's why you should\nmeditate so you can find that thing\nbecause most people go through life\nwithout any kind of constant everything\nabout their life is subject to change so\nwhen people talk about [ __ ] like the\ntrue self they say like meditate to like\nfind your inner self man find that true\nself all manly\nyeah like Lululemon pants and Oprah\nWinfrey like find yourself yeah like\nyoga studios yeah like they're no that's\n[ __ ] stupid there is a part of you\nlike oh that's true but they don't\nunderstand what the [ __ ] they're talking\nabout there's a part of you that is\nliterally unchanging and once you\ndiscover that part of you life becomes\nway easier\nso I remember a couple years later I was\nin the operating room and there was this\nvascular surgeon I was doing a vascular\nsurgery for a carotid endarterectomy\nwhich is you have this thing called the\ncarotid artery and the carotid artery\ngets blocked too with like [ __ ] and then\npeople have strokes because it's blocked\nand that's the main artery that feeds\nyou know the front side of your brain\nand so what you do is you go in with\nsurgery and you pull the gunk out so not\n[ __ ] yeah I mean it gets filled with\nlike cholesterol and stuff like the same\nstuff that hardens the arteries of your\nheart and gets inflamed and things like\nthat so so I was in this surgery right\nand surgeons are not the nicest people\nand so this guy is doing the surgery and\nthen he like cut something that he's not\nsupposed to cut and the [ __ ] starts\nbleeding and like the field of vision\nfor a neck surgery is like tiny it's\nlike you've got this little patch of\nlike maybe you know one and a half inch\nby one and a half inch of like the neck\nthat's open it's very small so it\ndoesn't take a whole lot of blood to\nlike fill it up and he doesn't see what\nthe he doesn't see where the\nLEED is coming from so he's on one side\nof the table I'm on the other side of\nthe table and then he's like looking for\nthe blood like he's looking for like\nwhat he caught in what's bleeding and he\ncan't find it and so he's kind of an\n[ __ ] so I tend to stay quiet but I\nsay like hey this guy's been a [ __ ]\nstroke out and so I make the mistake of\nopening my mouth because he can't see it\nbecause he's on this side of the table\nand it's like spurting out like down\nhere like over here so I'm on the other\nside of the table I can see exactly\nwhere the blood is coming from and so I\nmake the mistake of opening my [ __ ]\nmouth and I say dr. so-and-so I think\nthe bleed is on this side and what do\nyou guys think his responses medical\nstudent when I want your [ __ ] opinion\nI will ask for it right\nso most medical students in this\nsituation would be devastated but I\nlaugh inside myself and I was like fine\nlike you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] I can see\nthe bleed if you don't find it this\nguy's gonna like be brain damaged\nyou're a dick and like most people are\ndevastated because it's a high-stakes\nkind of thing and he's like yelling at\nyou I may have even said something snide\nbecause other people in the room started\nlaughing I don't remember but and and so\nlike when you find that thing underneath\nyou like normally getting yelled at by a\nsurgeon in the o.r there's so many of my\ncolleagues that would like start crying\nand like because like you get deficit\nthey like these [ __ ] [ __ ] people\nthey yell at you and then you feel like\na piece of [ __ ] because they're all high\nand mighty and you're like a lowly\nperson like getting yelled at by someone\nis like not nice it's a stressful\nsituation the emotions are running high\nbut if you find that core of yourself\nthat is not like sad or happy or\nanything like it gives you so much\nstrength you just go to that thing you\ngo to that thing and you find it\nand there are times where you know like\nlike I don't know if it's so sometimes I\nhave a cup of tea in the morning and\nlike when I drink my tea like for a few\nmoments I'm like nothing I'm just like\none with the tea and you're drinking\nthat team it's [ __ ] delicious\nyou have no hopes you have no fears you\nhave no anxieties you're just like one\nwith no he ended up finding the bleed\nand the guy was okay\nhe found the bleed because I told him\nwhere it was I was like it's over here\nand then he like mopped it up and then\nfound it and sewed it right and you have\nthat being fine I ended up getting a\ngood grade in the rotation too by the\nway I ended up getting honors so they\nactually tried to convince me to be a\nvascular surgeon and I thought about it\nfor a hot second they said I was too I\nwas too smart to become a psychiatrist\nthat's what they told me at the end of\nthe rotation like you'd be [ __ ]\nwasted in psychiatry you should become a\nreal doctor I was like thank you\nso I'm seriously that that was their\nfeedback honest to god so you know I\nthink fine like so the reason you should\nmeditate us to find that thing within\nyourself right to find the part of you\nthat's constant and doesn't fluctuate\nand once you discover that thing and you\nhave access to that thing you can kind\nof like you're kind of like floating\nabove the rest of your life it's like\nyou know I don't know how else to\ndescribe it so that's why you should\nmeditate and I think what happens when\nyou find that thing is you become like\nholier so we have this concept of\nholiness which is like I don't know\nexactly what that means but I think\ngenerally like things like compassion\nbecome more easy like patience becomes\neasier compassion becomes easier dealing\nwith sadness becomes easier dealing with\nhappiness becomes easier you become like\nmore like level which is I think part of\nwhat they mean by holy so I'm gonna\nrelate this to another question how do\nyou gain confidence as a clinician\nthat's another question that I got and I\ngained confidence because I find this\nthing like and so sometimes I do a bad\njob as a clinician and sometimes I do a\ngood job as a clinician because\nnot a perfect clinician right just like\nwe were talking about I try to do the\nbest job that I can every day and I come\non stream and I just try to do the best\njob that I can which is sometimes it's\nlike if I stop and think about coming on\nstream it's [ __ ] terrifying just\nthink about this for a second when you\nguys show up on stream like what are you\nlooking for\nyou're looking for salvation that's why\nyou guys come right and just think about\nthis for a second like what the [ __ ]\nisn't like for me to come on and be like\noh [ __ ] Friday at 3 p.m. time to give\nout some dad salvation time to transform\npeople's lives like I can't do that [ __ ]\ncome on right like I can't like you\ncan't expect that of me and I can't\nexpect it it myself but somewhere along\nthe way I start to think like oh my god\nlike I better save someone's lot like I\ngot a I got to help these people today\nand then then it's like oh [ __ ] if I\nstart thinking that then it's gonna be\nhard so then I just like I meditate and\nthen I recalibrate and then I focus on\nthe person sitting across from me and I\ncrossed my fingers and I pray to God\nthat it's going to help you that's\nthat's the only way to do it\nright so meditation is about like\nforgetting all that stuff it's not about\nsaving the world like it's like sureiy\noe healing is cool and all that's what\nI'm trying to do but I can't expect that\nI'm gonna transform the world with my\nstreams like it's not an expectation I'm\njust gonna show up and try to help in\nthe way that I can and like if people\nget transformed great if they don't\nthat's okay too\nand it's like no big no big deal no big\ndeal\nNBD okay so that's why you should\nmeditate I hope that's good enough of an\nanswer and simple enough of an answer\nand the reason that you become holier\nand compassion is cuz you get out of\nyour [ __ ] head so it's like you know\nI didn't like you can be in more decent\nhuman being because you're less caught\nup in your own [ __ ] and like being a\ndecent human being people start calling\nyou like holy or and a saint like that's\njust because it's hard because you're\nnormally caught up in your own stuff\nokay"
