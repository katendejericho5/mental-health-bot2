    "transcript": "so today what I think I'm gonna do\ninstead of a meditation is I'm gonna\ntell you guys a story about Dharma so\nmeditation can be a lot of different\nthings but one of them is reflection and\nso this is kind of like a substitute for\nmeditation so I'm gonna tell you a story\nabout a guy named pshhh ma and what I\nwant you guys to do is just think in\nbecause people are asking about the\nTomasz so this is a this is a story\nabout Dharma and the goal here is people\nare asking like how do I find my Dharma\nso let me tell you sorry about pshhh\nmind then let's see like what you guys\ncan understand about Dharma so the first\nthing is that how drama means duty or\nresponsibility and it's my belief that\none of the best ways to move forward in\nlife is to like live your Dharma and\nfind out what your thought Imai is\nbecause that gives you strength so there\nwas a guy named Shantanu I think it was\nChandan\nand he got married and he had a kid\nnamed Peshwa and then he ended up\ndivorcing his wife for reasons that will\nbe another story for another day\nand so it's like father and son so\nfather's King and then his son Bheeshma\nis gonna be Crown Prince and so Bheeshma\nis like a really fantastic son he's very\nwise he's very talented he's a good\nwarrior he has good judgment he has good\nmorals so he's like a wonderful he's\ngonna be a wonderful Crown Prince and so\nhis dad is very content because his son\nis like growing up to be the man that he\nwants him to be so everything is fine\nand dandy\none day Shantanu is out hunting\nand he actually takes like a barge so he\ntakes his chariot on a barge and the\nbarge gets like like he takes the barge\nacross the river and the barge like the\nbarge person the person who pushes the\nbarge is a young woman who is very very\nattractive and he falls in love with her\nand so he sees this hottie and he's like\nman she is amazing and he hasn't like\nBheeshma is like 25 at this point so\nhe's all grown up and and so then he's\nlike but she's also like bhishma's age\nso he's like oh that's like silly I\ncan't get into that but he's like he's\nsmitten right and so then he goes back\nand he's like he finishes his hunt and\nthen goes back and then over the next\ncouple of days like patience and\nobservant and dutiful son so I noticed\nis that his dad is\nyeah barge like a boat it's like a boat\nwoman so he notices his dad is\ndistracted right and so he says hey Dad\nlike what's up it seems like you're not\nall here and then his dad is like oh\nit's nothing it's nothing it's nothing\nand then he's like no really dad like\nwhat's going on what's going on so he\npushes his daddies pushes his dad and\nthen his dad finally says hey so I'm\nlike I know this is a little bit\nshameful but like I like met this woman\nand I can't get her out of her head and\nshe's completely like it's completely\ninappropriate for me to like want to\nmarry her\nyou know my first responsibility is to\nyou but like you know I know nothing can\ncome of it so don't worry about it but\nthat's what's on my mind and then what\ndo you guys think pshh Moe says\nyou\nthat's what I get for asking to it chat\nyes so he says what I think most of you\nare saying which is which is this is\nlike hey man that's fine by me like you\ndo you you know like follow your heart\nand if you wanna if you want to like go\nfor it\nlike go for it like I have no problem if\nyou want to get married like you haven't\nhad a wife for many years and if it\nmakes you happy like go and do it with\nmy blessing so as that is actually\noverjoyed he's like yeah right so dad\ngoes and goes to the the woman her woman\nis like the the girl's father is like\nsort of like head of the boat people and\nso he goes to the boat king and he's\nlike hey so I'd love to get your\ndaughter's hand in marriage and then the\nboat king set is like overjoyed because\nthis is a huge step up right and so he's\nlike oh like I'd love it if my daughter\nmarry you like thank you so much for\nshowing interest in her I'd love it if\nyou married her you're welcome to marry\nher but I have some conditions and then\nthe king is like what conditions and so\nthe boat king is like well look so I\nunderstand that you love my daughter but\nI can't bear the thought of my daughter\nbeing a second-class citizen in anyone's\nhousehold even the Kings so like I I'm\nhappy that you want to be like like that\nyou want to be you know married to her\nbut if you marry her I need you to\npromise me that her children will\ninherit the throne and that you need to\npass over Bhishma as Crown Prince\nbecause a queen whose children are not\ngoing to inherit is like no Queen at all\nso I need my daughter to come first in\nyour household and that's just what I\nhave to you know that's just those are\nmy conditions so what do you guys think\npshh Moe's dad says\nyou\nwhat do you think\nabsolutely right he's like [ __ ] you [ __ ]\nthis I'm out of here\nso pshh miss dad goes and then he's like\nso pshh was dad is like super depressed\nnow he's like solid emo you know like\nwearing his goth makeup and stuff like\nthat and pshh my notices and he's like\ndad what's wrong what's wrong he's like\nhe seemed more bummed out than even\nbefore and he's like no no no like I'm\nfine I'm fine there's no big deal no big\ndeal no big deal and then this time his\ndad refuses to tell him it's like not\ngonna say [ __ ] so then pshh boy goes to\nhis charioteer and he says hey man like\nmy dad we had this conversation my dad\nseemed really upbeat because I was like\nyeah man go follow your heart\nand then he woke up the next morning he\nwent out hunting and like what happened\nbecause he came back and he's been\nwearing his goth makeup ever since and\nand then the charioteer is like well I\ndon't know what what happened but I can\ntell you that like you know I took him\nto go see the boat King and he was\nreally happy before he saw the boat King\nand then when he walked out of the boat\nKings hot he was super upset and soapy\nshe was like okay let me go see what's\ngoing on so Bheeshma goes down to the\nboat King and he walks in and he says\nexcuse me sir\nI'm pshh moe and the boat King is like\nyeah I know who you are he's like well\nI'd like to I'm curious can you tell me\na little bit about what you and and my\ndad talked about and the boat King says\nwell sure I can I can tell you and I'm\nsorry but you know I'm happy to share it\nso your dad asked for my daughter's hand\nin marriage and I said I'm happy to to\nhave her marry you but I have conditions\nand then Bhishma was like well what\nconditions and he's like it's nothing\nagainst you bro I think you're fantastic\nbut I can't have my daughter be a\nsecond-class citizen in anyone's\nhousehold so I asked your King I asked\nyour dad that if he marries her her kids\nhave to be in line for the throne and\nshe has to be like number one in the\nhousehold and then your dad turned me\ndown which is fine no hard feelings and\nthen P Sh'ma says but wait wait wait\nactually like I have no problem with\nthat like I understand that my dad was\nnot willing to pass me over but I have\nno problem giving up the throne\nand so if I give up the throne will you\nlet your daughter marry my father and\nthe guy says yeah absolutely\nbut I have some additional conditions\nand Bheeshma is like what do you mean\nadditional conditions like I said I\nwould give up the throne he's like yeah\nI get I get that you would give up the\nthrone but here's the thing one day\nyou're gonna have kids and my daughter's\ngonna have kids and they're gonna be\nabout the same age and sometimes this is\nhow civil wars start right because your\nkids you're willing to give up the\nthrone but your kids may not be eight it\nmay not be willing to they may have a\nchip on their shoulder because you were\nsupposed to inherit and you gave up the\nthrone and they could actually start a\ncivil war with my grandchildren so what\nI need you to do is swear to never get\nmarried and never have children and what\ndo you guys think Bhishma says he says\nso be it and he vows to never have he\ngives up the throne vows to never have\nchildren and never get married\nand so pshh MA in Sanskrit means one who\nmakes a terrible vow I don't know if\nterrible is like a pun if it means like\na shitty vow or like a like a big vow\nand so now this is a story about\ntomorrow okay so now I'm gonna ask you\nguys so you guys think that the the boat\nking is an evil guy right so let's think\nabout Dharma so the big problem is we\nthink about good and evil in Western\nsociety we think about an absolute\nmorality of good and evil in Eastern\nstuff they think about Dharma so let's\nthink about who is doing their Dharma so\nwho are the different people in in the\nstory there's Shantanu there's Bhishma\nand there's the boat king arguably the\ndaughter but right so let's start with\nshock-like let's start with P Schmid's\ndad is P Schmid's dad doing his Dharma\nwhat do you guys think what is his\ntournament\nwhat is that what is that Shawn thenews\nDharma the king so do you guys think do\nyou think the king is doing is the\nDharma yes or no okay so now I want you\nguys to look at twitch chat right so\nthis is why the Dharma is confusing\nbecause for such a simple question\nthere's a lot of like confusion about\nwhat the answer is so this is why\nstories are important so I want you guys\nto think about this and think about what\nsays done so let's move on bow king the\nvillain of the story right can we all\nagree that the boat king is the villain\nright like people are people are see now\nthat was even confusion because earlier\nif you guys when I was talking about the\nboat king when I was like ah but I have\nadditional conditions everyone's like\n[ __ ] that guy [ __ ] [ __ ]\n[ __ ] that guy\nYeah right so what does the boat Kings\nDharma so like I want you guys to go\nback and like if you want to watch the\nvadouvan watch your emotional reaction\nto the [ __ ] area of the boat King but\nwhen we talk about Dharma do you guys\nthink yes right so the boat king is\ndoing his Dharma his thermos to look out\nfor his daughter now we come to the hero\nof the story because Bhishma is a\n[ __ ] hero in all these stories\nwhat does pshhh Mazda herma and did he\ndo his Dharma he's the one who\nsacrificed right he gave up everything\nfor the sake of dad yeah man sacrifice\nmasculinity right like those are all\nlike is he a good let's start with this\nis Bhishma a good guy is he a good guy\nis he good dude\nwhat's his alignment you guys play D&D\nwhat's his alignment\nwho here plays D&D so everyone agrees\nBheeshma is a good guy\nand absolutely right he's [ __ ] lawful\ngood right low int low wisdom but lawful\ngood good so he's a good guy he's\nBhishma doing his Dharma\nso what why isn't he doing his Dharma\nyou're right paladin\nhe's sacrificing for his family why\nisn't that isn't that doing your Dharma\nhe's giving everything up is it that\nnoble and wonderful and shouldn't we\naspire to be Noble and wonderful and\nsacrifice for the people that we love\nyes you guys are right so his first\ndharma is to the kingdom this is the\nother thing a son does not sacrifice for\na father or father sacrifices for a son\nthat's the direction right and it's not\nentirely correct it goes somewhat both\nways but in general when it comes to\nlike who takes a bullet for who like I\ntake a bullet for my kids not the other\nway around\nso Bhishma does not do his turn so this\nis why things are confusing right\nbecause we're saying that like oh like\nthe villain in the story the [ __ ] in\nthe story is so what's the boat king's\nalignment let's play this game this is\nfun game I've never played this game\nbefore right what's the boat king's\nalignment\nhe's not neutral\ntraditional you guys think really\nokay I kind of envisioned it as lawful\nevil but if you guys think true neutral\nyou all have the boats right\nso this is why Hana is confusing so I\nwant you guys to take a step back and\nthink about this right so the hero of\nthe story is not doing his thermal and\nthe villain of the story is doing his\ntime\nso the problem is that when we think\nabout what we should do in life how do I\ndiscover what I'm supposed to do in life\nwe think about an axis of good and evil\nwe think like oh like I should do this\nor I should do this but don't think\nabout good and evil think about in Tana\nMO what's your duty what's your\nresponsibility it may not be good it may\nnot be evil\nso think about your Dharma\nyou\n[Music]\nokay\nall right I'm gonna just take a look at\nfeatured chat and see if we have any\nquestions okay\n[Music]\nyou\nokay so here's a question so what if\nyour Dharma in life is something\nnegative is they're not supposed to be a\nbalance between good and evil so there\nhas to be evil people as well some\npeople's Dharma has to be evil no I\ndisagree so my point here is that like\nevil and good or sorta like I mean I\ndon't think that they're just\nconceptions but that it's more\ncomplicated than that and I think what\nyou should always try to do is live here\nat the anima and oftentimes that's good\nthings but you should understand that\nblind goodness and blind evil are not\nactually better that sometimes your\nDharma is to look out for yourself\nand that you shouldn't like ascribe to\njust a standard set of morals in my\nopinion or like the standard set of\nmorals is doing your Dharma but that\nthings are actually more complicated and\nthat life is not black-and-white and\ntheir shades of gray so to think about\nwhat your responsibility is right so\nlike if your parents are like if your\nparents are pissed at you there's a\ncertain amount that they may have that\nis right and there's a certain amount\nthat they may have that is wrong in that\nif you have conflict with your parents\nlike are you doing your entire mode to\nyour parents if you're living at home\nand like not earning money and living in\nlike your parents basement\nplaying video games all day you're not\ndoing your Dharma to that you're not\ndoing your autonomy to yourself\nlike what is your tournament like start\nthere and it doesn't have to be\nsomething grand like when I think about\nmy diorama it's to help gamers and that\nsounds like grand and like Oh like but\nit's just like I just like I get up and\nI stream right that's just what I do and\nI just open my [ __ ] mouth so like\nwhat's your dharma like it doesn't have\nto be grandiose like in Skye's case it's\nnot to like repay all these debts it's\nto take care of himself\nit's to live a life without regrets\nright it's not about success or failure\nits to live a life without regrets to\ngive it your all and to go for Mount\nDoom come hell or high water that says\nthem and that's your tournament to start\nthere start by taking care of yourself\nforget about the rest of the world\nstart by taking care of yourself\nstart by eating healthy start by\nmeditating start by polishing up your\nresume start by cleaning your room\nstart by understanding that you deserve\na better life that you're owed a better\nlife that it's your government to have a\nbetter life and that you are doing\nyourself a disservice you are not living\nup to your Dharma to not take care of\nyourself\nso start by doing you're talking about\nto yourself forget about the rest of the\nworld that comes later\nI spent 16 years or 14 years taking care\nof myself and putting myself first now I\ncan help you because I'm you know I have\nto take care of myself I had to do\nsomething\nI had to gain skills and power and\ncapability and knowledge and then you\ncan go help the world you're gonna save\nthe world like you know what sure you\ncan be a hobbit but like it sure as hell\nhelps if you're [ __ ] Gandalf or\nAragorn or Gimli or Legolas like they\nspent their time learning and training\nand then they can do something in the\nworld so start there\nyeah you got a level up first okay so\nI'm gonna sign off but it was great to\nsee you guys again thank you all for\ncoming and thank you to sky"
