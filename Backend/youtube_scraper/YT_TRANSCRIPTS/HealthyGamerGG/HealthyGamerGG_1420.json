    "transcript": "um let's talk about some scars for a\nsecond so a some scar is a ball of\nundigested emotion and what I mean by\nthat is like generally speaking we have\nexperiences in life and we have some\ncapacity to digest emotions and we have\nsome capacity to not digest emotions and\nthen what happens as a result of like\nundigested emotions is they kind of like\nthey continue to affect us so I'm gonna\ngive you guys okay thank you guys very\nmuch for rating and thanks direct full\nfor the rate but I'm gonna keep talking\nI'm gonna just plow for it cuz I it's\nhard for me to engage with chat so I'm\ngonna give you guys my classic example\nto understand the some scar so let's say\num I don't know how do I do this chat in\nslow mode I don't even know how to do\nthat okay I don't know how to use twitch\nguys I'm a Boomer like absolutely boomer\nmillennial boomer so I'll give you guys\nan example so let's say like I'm walking\na side of a four-year-old kid and let's\nsay that I walk I'm walking down the\nstreet with my four-year-old and she\nsees a dog and she goes out and Pat's\nthe dog and then the dog like gives her\na little nip so she starts to cry and\nshe gets like really really scared and\nthe first thing that happens in her mind\nis she gets like very afraid right\nthat's the first emotional response and\nthat emotion sort of creates like she\nhas this ball of fear around a dog and\nthen I kind of check her out make sure\nshe's okay sort of calm her down a\nlittle bit and then what happens is I I\ntake her like let's say there's an ice\ncream store so I take her and get some\nice cream and then she's eating her ice\ncream and after eating her ice cream she\nfeels way better and so like where did\nthat fear go like all of that fear that\nshe had seems to disappear and she is\ncompletely happy she's laughing she's\neating her ice cream and then what\nhappens is she's walking down the street\nand she sees a dog the next day and then\nshe starts to cry because when she sees\nthat dog all of that fear which had\nlived within her the day before\nre-emerges and she kind of had this\ntraumatic experience\nright that's the way that we think about\ntrauma and so that fear like pops back\nup and then she starts crying again and\nthen I have to calm her down and maybe\nthe next day if she sees another dog\nshe'll get she'll get re triggered so we\nthink about that as trauma and so that\nthat ball of undigested emotion is in\nsanskrit the yogis called that' some\nscar so let's pretend that i'm walking\ndown the street and i reach out to pet a\ndog and it bites me so i too will feel\nfear but there are other parts of my\nmind like my intellect my\nrationalization capability that step in\nand are able to like help me metabolize\nthat emotion i don't need ice cream to\nhelp me forget i can actually think\nthrough stuff and as i think through\nthat stuff i start to think to myself oh\nman like that was kind of stupid maybe i\nshouldn't have you know talked to like\nmaybe I shouldn't have pet that dog\nmaybe I should ask people if they're\nfriendly it's okay like I was kind of a\nstupid thing to do and about half an\nhour later I feel fine and the next day\nwhen I see a dog like I don't get\ntriggered I may get a little bit of an\nemotional response and may get a little\nbit of adrenaline may get a little bit\nanxious but I'm good I don't get\ntriggered the same way that a\nfour-year-old does so what's the\ndifference between a four-year-old and\nme it's because my mind is more well\ndeveloped and I'm able to metabolize\nthat emotion instead of distracting from\nit and the more that I digest that\nemotion the less the some scar exists\nthe more to the some scar gets dissolved\nso what we saw with reckful today is\nthat he still has that some scar right\nit doesn't take like I mean you have to\nask the right kind of question you have\nto get to the some scar so like part of\nwhat I do is like I've been trained in\nthis stuff so I sort of know how to ask\nquestions to get to the some scar and we\nget to that some scar and there's that\nfive-year-old that's still like\ntraumatized by losing his brother and so\nhe can distract himself with ice cream\nhe can distract himself with photography\nhe can distract himself with video games\nbut that emotional block is still there\nand that needs to be metabolized that\ndebuff is still there the debuff has to\nbe cleansed right you've got to heal\nthat ship\nand the way that you cleanse it is by\nfirst diagnosing it because let's\nremember that good diagnosis precedes\ngood treatment so the first thing you\nhave to do is like understand that\nthat's what the problem is and that's\nwhat we help direct full do today we\nhelped him diagnose it so now at least\nhe's got a clue like he thought that his\nlife was full of depression and his life\nhad no meaning and that's because it's\ntrue in a sense he lost his meaning when\nhe was when he was like six like his\nlife lost meaning because that's what it\nwas his meaning was to go home and like\nplay games with his brothers and then\none of his brothers left forever and he\nsays that he's forgiven but I don't know\nif he's fully forgiven to be honest I\nthink that the 30 year old reckful has\nforgiven I don't know if the\nsix-year-old reckful has I'd be very\nsurprised if there wasn't like some part\nof the the six year old or the ten year\nold who still blames his brother I don't\ndoubt that the 30 year old one has but I\nthink that's tough tough worth worth\nhaving another conversation about"
