    "transcript": "so how do you deal with social anxiety\nokay so the first thing to understand is\nthat social anxiety is a learned\nresponse okay so social anxiety happens\nwhen somewhere I mean so there's there\ngenetic predispositions to it but when I\nwork with social anxiety what I really\nthe most successful I've been is in\nhelping people understand that like\nsomewhere along the way your mind\nlearned that to be watched and to be\nonstage and to be seen is actually to be\nin danger so if we think about what\nhappens in social anxiety when you're in\na room full of people you have a\nsympathetic nervous response you have an\nadrenaline response your mind and your\nbody feel like you're in danger okay\nlike that's what's going on your\nadrenaline is pumping your heart is\npumping really fast your blood pressure\ngoes up you get diaphoretic\nyou get sweaty right so that's what\nhappens in social anxiety so your your\nbrain has realized that being seen is\nbeing in danger so you want to be\ninvisible right you don't want to be\nseen by anyone you just want to be like\nhim and when you get seen that means\nyou're in danger so I had social anxiety\ngrowing up because I was bullied a lot\nas a kid so when I was like 6 years old\nand 7 years old I would get bullied so I\nstill remember like being on the\nplayground and being like I don't know\nif this has ever happened to you guys\nbut being like literally surrounded by\nkids like you're in the middle of a\ncircle and then there's like the bully\nand then they're all the bullies friends\nand you're like the target you're under\nthe crosshairs and my body and my brain\nlearned that the more eyes that are on\nyou the more [ __ ] you are and that the\nway to be safe is that like no one is\nwatching you right that's that's so my\nbody like learned like it was a survival\nmechanism because being bullied like\ndoesn't feel good my body was like oh\n[ __ ] we're gonna get we're gonna get\n[ __ ] again and the more people that\nare laughing at me the more people that\nare watching me the more likely I am to\nget screwed and that's a lesson that\nyour mind and brain learns to try to\nprotect you\nso when you're like seven years old and\nyou get bullied a lot like what happens\nis like you learn you're like I better\nnot be seen so I learned how to become\ninvisible\nI learned how to crack jokes I learned\nhow to be self-deprecating because when\nsomeone's like making fun of you if you\nmake fun of yourself you kind of take\nthe bite out of the bully like bullies\nare [ __ ] stupid usually and they're\nlike if you start making fun of yourself\nthey don't know what to do so I started\nto be like self-deprecating because what\nI realize even though I'm making a joke\nand everyone is watching me what I\nrealize is they're not really seeing me\nthey're not seeing me they're seeing\nlike the mask that I put on and then\nlike that's like that sort of started as\nmy is my like protection against social\nanxiety so the first thing to understand\nabout social anxiety is that's not your\nbrain trying to [ __ ] you over your brain\nisn't trying to keep you from making\nfriends although that's the result right\nit's not trying to make you feel bad\nyour social anxiety is trying to protect\nyou\nbecause somewhere along the way you\nlearn the lesson that being seen is\nbeing in danger\nso what you've got to do is actually\ntrack back and first of all like figure\nout that understand that your body's\ngonna do this to you and it's not that\nyou're wrong like it's not your body's\nlike stupid\nit's just your body doesn't understand\nright like it got bit by a dog and you\nsee a dog and it's gonna freak the [ __ ]\nout because that's all it knows how to\ndo so the first thing is to understand\nthat it's trying to help you out and\neven if you understand that it's trying\nto help you out that can give you some\npower over right you can start to notice\nthe social anxiety so cultivating the\nobserving self cultivate that part of\nyou that recognizes oh this is my social\nanxiety acting up again be prepared for\nit just acknowledge that it's happening\nsee that it happens and recognize that\nthere's a part of your brain that's\ntrying to help you out it's like Leroy\n[ __ ] Jenkins\nLeroy was trying to help he was like\nalright guys let's go Leroy let's charge\nlet's sound that raid boss Leroy's\n[ __ ] everything up but he's trying to\nhelp he's just helping as best as he can\nthat's all he knows how to do right so\nlike that's what your social anxiety is\ndoing the second thing is to understand\nthat that you can shut off okay so this\nI can think about social anxiety is as\nyour adrenaline system kicks in\nit speeds up the rate of your thoughts\nso when you have adrenaline going on in\nyour brain it adrenaline flowing through\nyour body once the danger response gets\ntriggered then what happens is your\nbrain gets like confused by that and it\ngets activated so adrenaline does a\ncouple of things to your thinking it\nstarts to make you think in black and\nwhite because our brain evolved that\nwhen we have adrenaline going on we need\nto make snap decisions and those\ndecisions need to be treated not as\nhypotheticals but as reality so when\nyou're experiencing social anxiety you\ndon't understand the difference between\nhypothetical and reality and that's\nabsolutely evolutionary so like\nthousands or tens of thousands or\nmillions of years ago when our brain\nevolved and we saw a tiger or a snake or\na lion like we didn't give a [ __ ]\nlike what the lion was thinking like\nthere was there's no hypothetical our\nadrenaline signed to make us have snap\njudgments and assume that danger is real\nwe start treating hypothetical danger is\nreal danger right our mind doesn't sit\nthere and start thinking about oh maybe\nthe lion will attack maybe it won't\nattack maybe I'm actually okay like\nmaybe it ate recently like let's just\nstop like and think about this calmly no\nthat's not the way that adrenaline is\ndesigned Adrenaline's like that lines\ngonna attack us let's get out of here we\ngot out we got a fight or we got a run\nso adrenaline is doing that too you're\nthinking it is making hypothetical feels\nfears feel like reality and that's what\nit's designed to do that's what's\nhappening in your brain it's happening\nneuro scientifically that hypothetical\nbecomes reality so the second thing you\ncan do is learn how to meditate because\nwhen you meditate so if you start to\nhave a social anxiety response if you\nengage in a meditative technique what\nhappens is your mind you're gonna you're\ngonna recruit your vagus nerve and\nyou're gonna recruit your\nparasympathetic nervous system so\nmeditation shuts off the adrenaline\nresponse so you're just gonna shut it\noff and as you shut off the adrenaline\nresponse adrenaline has a half-life of\nlike 1 to 5 minutes so if you can really\nshut off your\nresponse then your mind will start\nthinking more clearly you'll start\nthinking in hypotheticals you'll start\nunderstanding in the best technique to\nshut off the adrenaline response is\nanything that slows down the rate of\nyour exhalation so when you start to\nbreathe deeply slow down your exhalation\nso breathe in for three seconds do it\nwith me\nbreathe out for seven in four three slow\ndown the exhalation right my adrenaline\nwas spiking because this is like you\nguys are bombarded me with questions and\nI can't keep up it's really disturbing\nmy fatha good get dizzy right so now\nslow down so stop after three breaths\nthe reason that I say focus on\nexhalation there are other techniques\nthat work do but if you're socially\nanxious you have to do something that's\nnot gonna make you look like weirdo\nright you have to do something that like\nyou can do in a group of people so you\njust slow down your exhalation you can\ndo that without anyone noticing it's got\nto be something you can do without\nanyone noticing and as you slow down\nyour exhalation as you slow down your\nbreathing your co2 level will increase\nyour o2 level can decrease and your\nparasympathetic nervous system will\nbecome active your vagus nerve will\nbecome active when the vagus nerve\nbecomes active it slows down your heart\nrate lowers your blood pressure causes\nyou to chill out and the thing about\nsocial anxiety is once you start\nchilling out then you can potentially\nbreak the cycle because social anxiety\nis a cycle right the more anxious you\nbecome the more adrenaline you feel more\nadrenaline you feel the more your\nthinking becomes reality the more your\nthinking becomes reality the more you\nyou it's not that they could be judging\nyou it's not that they they could think\nyou're an idiot\nevery\ndoes think you're an idiot right in\nsocial anxiety your fears become reality\nand you've got to break that cycle and\nthere's a physiologic technique that you\ncan use to break it the last thing you\ncan do about social anxiety so the first\nthing is to notice that the second thing\nis to meditate and specifically slow\ndown your exhalations as much as\npossible the third thing is to get to\nthe root of your social social anxiety\nright when did you learn that being seen\nis being in danger because if you can\nget to the root of it and you can\nmetabolize that some scar if you can\ndigest it if you can unlearn that lesson\nso in reckless case he's got to unlearn\nthe lesson that life has no meaning\nbecause his meaning was destroyed when\nhis brother killed himself so you've got\nto unlearn what you learned before but\nin order to do that you have to\nunderstand like what it is that you want\nlike you have to find that specific\npoint you got to find that point within\nyourself that brings up that emotion\nthat is like a geyser like for reckful\nit's a geyser like I'm just like asking\nhim questions then one question happens\nand he starts crying right and it's like\nwhat's that\nlike what's going on there"
