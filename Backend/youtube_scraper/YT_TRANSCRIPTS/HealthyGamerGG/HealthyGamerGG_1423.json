    "transcript": "people are asking so there are three\nquestions about reheating stuff in\nnutrients okay so the first thing is a\nyear ago I did was like so I had heard\nthis stuff right like people and I like\nAyurvedic doctors will say like don't\nuse microwaves and so I was like okay is\nthere any data behind this st. John's\nwort you have to be careful about for\nsure especially because you can get\nserotonin and overdoses if you're taking\nregular antidepressants as well I don't\nrecommend really medical marijuana in\nmost cases\nyeah your thumb stick if you take benzos\nthat's right so let's just talk about\nreheating food for a second okay\nno serotonin overdose doesn't lead to\nburnout you're gonna [ __ ] start\nshaking and like I don't think you can\nhave seizures but it can be really bad\nlike you're gonna have an elevated heart\nrate you're gonna [ __ ] up reflexes\nit's like really bad so we're gonna just\ntalk for a second about the reheating\nfood okay so a lot of these like\nalternative medicine folks talk about\nlike eating freshly cooked food and\nstuff like that like I personally think\nthat that has validity that's anecdotal\nso about a year ago I sat down and I\ntried to like understand like what\nstudies have been done about nutrients\nand food and the best that I could find\nis like most of the studies about\nnutrients and reheated food actually\ncome from like the 1970s when microwave\nstarted to become popular so when\nmicrowaves became popular there were a\nbunch of studies that were done on like\nthe nutrient impact of microwavable like\nmicrowaves and reheating food on\nnutrients the short answer is that these\nstudies basically found a minimal amount\nof difference between microwaved food\nand like a reheated food and other\nthings the problem is that they really\nonly looked at like macronutrient\ncomponents so they looked at like grams\nof carbohydrate so what they did is they\ntook like let's say like a lasagna and\nthey like measured the amount of grams\nof carbohydrate grams of fat grams of\nprotein in a lasagna and then they\nmicrowaved it and then they measured the\ngrams of carbohydrate the grams of\nprotein in the grams of fat and they\nbasically found there's very little\ndifference so from a macronutrient\nperspective that the raw number of like\nthe grams of protein and stuff are\nrelatively the same the problem is that\nit doesn't look at any of like the more\nsubtle things that we've learned to\ndetect right so it doesn't look at what\nthe inflammatory state of that that\nlasagna is it doesn't look at\nmicronutrients doesn't really look at\nvitamins and minerals and things like\nthat like like vitamin C has a half-life\nof something like 12 hours so like you\nknow a lot of a lot of vitamins have a\nvery low half-life and the other really\ninteresting thing is that if you like if\nyou pick up a piece of fruit\nit's cold like fruit a piece of fruit at\nroom temperature is gonna feel colder\nthan the surrounding objects and the\nquestion is why it's because the fruit\nis actually still alive right like do\nyou guys get that when you have a fruit\nand a vegetable that that those are\nstill like living organisms like you can\ntake the bottom of like a head of\nlettuce you can stick it in water and\nit's gonna start to grow like if you\nhave a potato that's sitting in your\nyour closet or in your pantry net\npotatoes gonna start sprouting so you\nhave active metabolism going on in like\nfruits and vegetables and and so the the\nnutritional capacity of like an orange\nthat's sitting on your shelf is like a\nhundred percent because that vitamin C\nhas not started to decay because the\nthing is actually alive whereas if you\nhave like a bottle of orange juice they\nfortify it with vitamin C but then that\nvitamin C is going to start decaying\nbecause there's nothing alive in there\nso I think that that the the data\nactually doesn't do a great job at\nsupporting the view that I'm propagating\nwhich is that you know healthy food I\nmean that that reheating food negatively\nimpacts it but like if we just stop and\nthink about our human experience of\neating reheated versus freshly cooked\nfood it tastes wildly different so what\nI wonder is like what is it that yours\nyour taste buds and your senses or\npicking up right so there's got to be\nsomething that they're picking up and if\nyou think about like you know when you\neat like a piece of really old food and\nthen you get an upset stomach like why\ndo you get an upset stomach like that's\nnot mental and and something in your\ntaste buds is warning you before you\neven get the indigestion that it's like\nhey man like maybe you shouldn't really\nbe eating this like if you eat like\nfreshly cooked baby back ribs that [ __ ]\nis delicious and you're like I want to\neat more I want to eat more I want to\neat more whereas if you have like baby\nback ribs that have been like sitting\nout on the countertop for like four days\nand you start to eat it your body is not\ngoing to tell you I want more I want\nmore I want more right it's gonna be\nlike this is kind of nasty and like\nmaybe you shouldn't eat this so your\nbody is able to pick up a lot of signals\nthat we don't even scientifically\nunderstand and it's it's my opinion that\nthose signals correlate with like\nnutritious nosov food which is why\nthings like cooked vegetables taste\nbetter because they have more like they\nhave more available nutrients so my\nsense is that we're picking up on all\nkinds of different like changes in the\nnutrient density the nutrient quality\nwhich cause us to enjoy cooked foods\nless so I do think that\nthat that reheated food has less\nnutritional value than freshly cooked\nfood and I think that that net nutrient\nvalue isn't simply in terms of like\ncarbohydrates proteins fats and isn't\nnecessarily just in terms of vitamins as\nwell there's something about I don't\nknow how it works but like there's\nsomething about it that just makes it\ntaste good and so I think you know I'm a\nbig fan of like meal prep Sunday because\nlike I think it allows you to make\nhealthy food choices throughout the week\nso I'm not saying that you shouldn't do\nmeal prep Sunday because like if you\nhave a choice between eating like\nmeatballs and french fries and doing\nmeal prep prep Sunday and like making\nyourself like three days of stir fry I\nthink you should go with the stir fry at\nthe same time you should try to eat as\nmuch freshly cooked food as you can and\nlike try to portion things and then try\nto use things like slow cookers and\nstuff like that and and like there are a\nlot of like there are a lot of really\nquick things that you can make like you\ncan take a piece of fish sprinkle it\nwith salt pepper seasoning breadcrumbs\nPat it down heat up some olive oil in a\npan and you can be start-to-finish\nwithin 25 minutes you can have like\nprepared like prep the fish cook the\nfish eaten the fish and wash the pot\nright like you can do that so people are\nasking like\nit's the balance between meal prep and\neating fresh food I'd say like do what\nyou can so if your choice is between\neating like unhealthy food like burgers\nevery day right like a freshly cooked\nburger I don't think is as good is like\non a daily basis as as like a stir-fry\nmeal prep but I'd say that if you're if\nyou're really like and you just have to\nfigure out what your own personal\nthreshold is and and what you like what\nyou you know what you want to prioritize\nlike how much of your time is it worth\nsacrificing to eat freshly cooked food\nso in my case like I try to eat\nsomething fresh at least everyday\nlike usually at twice a day and it's not\nthat hard I think if you guys have\nroommates and stuff it becomes way\neasier even if you have co-workers like\nI used to do this thing with my with my\nmed school classmates were like there\nwere some days and we're like like one\nof us would cook for everyone so like I\nwould wake up and I would like make food\nfor like four of us and then like we'd\nall have lunch together and I like have\nfreshly cooked food like that day and\nthen like the next day someone else\nbrings something it doesn't have to be\nsuper like fancy like sometimes it's\njust sandwiches and stuff\nso I think you should just find your own\npersonal balance with what you have like\nI think it helps if you're like I'm\nmarried and I have two kids and my mom\nlives with us so like there are three\nadults that can cook freshly cooked food\nevery day we're really careful about\nfeeding my kids freshly cooked food so\nwe try to like really give them fresh\nfood every day um yeah so as someone's\nasking like what if you don't like some\nwhat if you don't like someone else's\ncooking well I mean so I think you\nshould learn how to do things that you\ndon't like right so like why don't you\nlike it and like what's the reason for\nthat I mean you guys are you guys are\nlike you're assuming that if you don't\nlike your your actions are dictated by\nwhat you like and what you don't like\nwell that's a shitty way to go through\nlife my friend if your actions are\ndictated by your intentions as opposed\nto what you like or dislike then you're\ngoing to be in a far different place\nif you like reheated food I'm not sure\nso I think there are some foods that\nimprove with being like old right not\nold but like so for example I think if\nyou if you cook a soup a lot of the\nflavors will like blend like hours after\nthe soup is cooked and the second day\nthey're like they like kind of reheat\nbetter and things like that there are\ndefinitely cases of that but\nI think that I'm not sure why your your\ntaste buds would prefer that\nyes so the other thing is you know the\nother reason why you may like reheated\nfood is because your taste buds have\njust grown accustomed to it right so\nlike if you grow up eating something\nlike I've had some people like you know\nI I hear about some people who like like\neat steak that's like well-done and\ncooked like shoe leather and that's just\nthe way they grew up eating it so that's\nhow they like it and so that could have\nsomething to do with it I mean if you\njust eat a lottery heated food then\nthat's just how it is\n[Music]\nokay\nsomething that helped me eat healthier\nwas prepping all my meals would you say\nit's worth the effort to try and cook\nmore fresh foods I worry I struggle to\neat as healthy as I am now if I were to\ncook yeah so I think prep is great right\nso I think it's like a good idea to like\nprep whatever you can ahead of time but\nyou can cook whole meals or you can prep\nstuff and this is where you know like\nfor example what I was telling gizmo\ntoday is like when you wake up in the\nmorning while you're making a cup of tea\nor you're making your cup of coffee like\nliterally so this is literally just grab\na bell pepper wash it and slice it up\nthe process of grabbing a bell pepper\nwashing it and slicing it into like nine\npieces is like 60 seconds I think a lot\nof people grossly misunderstood\noverestimate how long it actually takes\nto cook food and prepare food like\ngrabbing a piece of fruit washing it and\nslicing it is like a 60-second endeavor\nyou can spend five minutes prepping\nstuff and you will be amazed like you\ngrab a piece of fish wash it pat it down\nsprinkle salt take three or four things\nof seasoning sprinkle it on there and\nthen you're done that that whole process\nis like 90 seconds yeah so I think this\nis also where there's this beautiful\nthing called YouTube and on YouTube\nsometimes there are people on there it's\n[ __ ] weird there's just like people\nwho have like cooking experience and\nthey just show you how to like prep\nthings and they show you how to like\nslice and it's like really easy like if\nyou're if you're I don't know how to\ndescribe this but if you're having\ntrouble with the seeds in a bell pepper\nyou need to like if this is the bell\npepper you need to cut down from the top\nright so you just cut you make four\nslices you pull off the top and that's\nall the seeds and then you're done\nlike there's no bother with the seeds\nthe other thing if you have trouble with\nwith seeds and a bell peppers you wash\nit after you cut it all those things\njust come out you're done easy"
