    "transcript": "if you're not going anywhere in life\npeople just automatically assume that\nthe way to move forward is to like work\nharder or be more bitna but the reason\nthat you're not going anywhere life may\nnot be a lack of ambition it may be\nbecause you're spreading yourself too\nthin\nokay let's talk about solo queue so much\nmore toxic okay so let's do let's do\nsomething about habits what's my opinion\non the 16 personality test what is the\n16 personality test I don't know what it\nis\nmyers-briggs so myers-briggs is is I\nthink a useful descriptive personality\nassessment that is not that is not like\nindependently validated so I think it's\nlike a useful lens to understand\nbehavior but I don't think it is a good\nway to like make predictions so it's\nfunny actually I just saw this in reddit\nso the first thing to understand about\nmyers-briggs this it's not like\nindependently validated so there's a\nmyers-briggs Research Institute which\npublishes a lot of research but it's a\nproprietary model and like there really\nhaven't been independent studies on\nmyers-briggs that show that it it is\nvalid I think the virus Briggs can be\nvery useful so why are it is actually\nbased I think on Ayurveda because\nmyers-briggs is based on the work of\nCarl Jung and Carl Jung's ideas were\nheavily informed by our Venna\nso I think it can be a useful way to\nunderstand yourself kind of like and I\nlike this top end so that someone says\nthat it can be like a useful way to like\nlook at your own behavior and understand\nit much like a horoscope like you know I\nmean a horoscope is probably I think\nmyers-briggs is a little better than a\nhoroscope but when I talk about Lavazza\npit then gufa those are all useful ways\nto understand those are useful ways to\nunderstand like how you are as a person\nand understand your strengths and\nweaknesses and structure a life in your\ninteractions to play to your strengths\nand weaknesses so a couple of other\nquestions are there any personality\nframeworks independently a validated\nabsolutely so the big five I think is\nthe best the five factor personality\nassessment is the the best validated\nlike system of personality and the big\nfive so we can talk a little bit about\nthe big five so the big the five factors\nso what the big five says is that most\npeople can be sort of put on on five\ndifferent axes so the axes are\nintroversion versus extraversion which\nis exactly what it is in myers-briggs by\nthe word by the way extrovert and\nintrovert were words that Carl Jung I\nbelieve invented or coined the next is\nagreeableness so agreeable this is like\nhow willing you are to go along with\npeople\nthe third is openness so how open you\nare to new experiences versus how shut\noff you are Democrats in the u.s or\nliberals score higher on the openness\nstraight and then conservatives score\nlower on the openness straight\nagreeableness then the next one is\nneuroticism so neuroticism is your\ntendency for internal worry so how much\nyou get like bothered by things and\npeople may think that like being highly\nneurotic is bad or is worse than being\nlike having low neuroticism whereas like\nif you think about someone who's super\nlow on the the low neuroticism scale\nthere the traditional pothead\nso they don't care about anything\nthey're just gonna chill and relax they\nhave no ambition that's low neuroticism\nis that nothing bothers them they're\nhappy to just chill out and hang and\nthen high neuroticism is like people who\nare super anxious the interesting thing\nis if you look at medical students they\nscore very highly on the neuroticism\nscale and then the the fifth factor is\nconscientiousness which is how driven\nyou are towards a particular goal like\nhow conscientious you are how much you\ntake things seriously\nso medical suit are actually median\nincome so if you want to be rich the two\nbest traits are high neuroticism and\nhigh conscientiousness you have to be\nvery goal-oriented and driven towards\nsuccess and have follow through and be\ninternally very worried about things you\nhave to be scared or like you have to be\nanxious about skip failing the task so\nyou study extra hard and then you have\nto be like you have to study for the\ntest can people change I think so so you\ncan also like learn different ways you\nhave an intrinsic personality but then\nyou can like adopt different things you\ncan be naturally tended towards\nintroversion but as we were talking\nabout you can learn how to fill a room\nyou can be highly neurotic and then\nthrough meditation and psychotherapy\nlearn to be nothing less neurotic you\ncould have low conscientiousness and\nthrough some amount of emotional\nprocessing and reflecting and growth you\ncan become more conscientious you can\nbecome more open to new experiences you\ncan become more agreeable you can learn\nhow to get along with others better yeah\nso Alex Croft has it right so the\ntraditional pot head is low\nconscientiousness low neuroticism so\npeople are asking about okay so when\nshould someone change their personality\ntraits when they interfere with your\nquality of life yeah so I want you guys\nto understand this so your personality\ncan be what it is I think the most\nimportant thing is that you play to your\nstrengths so for those of you who\nunderstand poker like I think the\nproblem is that is a society and\ngenerally speaking gamers are very\nguilty of this they think that certain\nthings are objectively better than other\nthings\nlike they say that like in poker and ace\nis better than @n like that's just true\nand yes in theory it's true but if\nyou're playing poker and you've got the\noption for a flush draw like you don't\nwant an ace right you want like whatever\nsuit if you've got like if you paint\nplaying Hold'em and you've got like four\nten of hearts like your strategy to win\nthat game like you can beat someone\nwho's got an ace or even pocket aces you\ncan still win even though the other\nperson objectively has a way better hand\nthan you do the problem is that when we\nwhen when people rank things in a linear\nscale which is what Western thinking\ndoes we think about better and we think\nabout worse right we think about like\nthis person earlier was saying that like\nthe workplace is structured to\nextroverts that could be true but it\nsort of doesn't [ __ ] matter because\nyou should just understand like where\nwhat your personality strengths and\nweaknesses are and then play to those\nstrengths and weaknesses if you've got a\nflush draw go for a flush like just\nbecause the dude next to you has pocket\naces and can get like four of a kind\nwith aces doesn't mean you should even\ntry because it may be impossible for you\nbut you can still win if you just oh\nsorry my mic isn't exploding [ __ ] okay\nso so so I think this is the biggest\nproblem that people make is like you\nguys are talking about personality I'd\nsay don't worry about having the right\npersonality or the wrong personality\nunderstand what your personality is and\nhow you're gonna be good at it so if you\nhave low conscientiousness and low\nneuroticism you may think like okay that\nmy chances of being promoted are gonna\nbe lower than the person who's like\nworried about promotion all the time and\nthe person who's hard-working well\nthat's true and if you have higher\nopenness and higher agreeableness\nchances are your path through promotion\nis through like social standing so\npeople are gonna like you way more than\nthe person who's highly conscientious\nand highly neurotic\nso your path through promotion is gonna\nbe through charisma and once you\nunderstand that then you have to\nunderstand like okay like how much\nconscientiousness do I need to exert and\nhow much neuroticism do I need to exert\nand then how can I play to my strengths\nthen smeag ale 96 asks if it's possible\nto alter our door shut somewhat\nshouldn't we try to maximise our fitness\nif we want to be successful yes so if\nyou're fit does low so remember that\nproblems in Ayurveda arise when your\nlevels are too high or too low so if you\nfeel like you're not ambitious or not\nmoving anywhere in life I do think it\nwill help you to increase your pipa\nand more importantly like you have to\nincrease your Rajas but if you're\nthinking about like why you're stuck in\nlife it may not be that your bit does\ntoo low it could be that your vato is\ntoo high and this is this is the other\nproblem so I just think about this for a\nsecond guys if you're not going anywhere\nin life people just automatically assume\nthat the way to move forward is to like\nwork harder or be more bitna but the\nreason that you're not going anywhere\nlife may not be a lack of ambition it\nmay be because you're spreading yourself\ntoo thin so this is a classic Vata\nproblem where vodkas get stuck because\nthey think they need to be more\ndisciplined it's not that they need to\nbe more disciplined it's that they spend\ntheir energy in too many different\nplaces so if you're the solution isn't\nisn't necessarily to increase your bit\nthough it's to reduce your vodka and\nthis is exactly what I'm saying is that\ndepending on your individual personality\nmakeup there isn't a way to be\nsuccessful you just need to think about\nokay what isn't what is getting in the\nway of my success do I need to be more\nconscientious do I need to be more\nsocial is the problem that I'm having\nthat like I don't get opportunities that\nother people get because I'm not social\nenough\ncan I answer questions on suicide sure I\nmean I can't dispense medical advice\nI may have to advise you to go to the\nemergency room but I can answer\nquestions on suicide like I'm here to\nanswer serious questions yeah so if your\ncough is too high then you should lower\nyour cuff up right you can increase your\nfit though but you can also lower your\ncuff up is viewing spreading oneself\nthin as a successful poor mindset I\ndon't know what that means\noh [ __ ] my bad okay should I switch to\nthe other let me just switch to the\nother I don't know how to lower anything\nI'm gonna just switched to my Yeti so\nokay let me just think okay so the first\nthing is what is Ayurveda so I last\nSunday we talked about Ayurveda which I\nthink a lot of people found very\ninteresting but thanks for linking DANC\nso no No thank you guys for letting me\nknow we just we're trying a new mic\nsetup so it's important to you know find\na good mic setup so this is what you\nwhat Ayurvedic\nis all about so our Veda believes that\nhuman beings are fundamentally different\nand that there are three types of human\nor three sort of qualities of human\nbeings and the best analogy that I can\nuse that's kind of very accessible is\nthat like there are some people that we\nsay have fast metabolisms these people\ntend to be thin and like even if they\neat whatever they want to they can do\nlike fried chicken every day and they're\nnot gonna put on like that much weight\nit doesn't mean if they're gonna be\nhealthy but that that like they just\ndon't balloon up whereas other people\nare big-boned and even if they eat\nsalads every day they can still be\noverweight and so\num Ayurveda sort of says that like\nunlike Western science which kind of\nsays that everyone should eat a 2,000\ncalorie diet that these are like\neveryone should have five servings of\nfruits and vegetables and the kinds of\nfruits and vegetables don't matter that\nyou should have X amount of protein it's\nor Western medicine has a common\nprescription for all people it assumes\nfundamentally that people are the same\nif you have pneumonia you need a\nparticular antibiotic to treat the\npneumonia who you are or how tall you\nare or what your body type is or how\nyour stool is or how your skin is\ndoesn't matter at all Western medicine\ntreats disease with medicine the person\ndoesn't enter it's just a disease\nmedicine relationship Iyer VII that\nstarts off by saying that people are\ndifferent and that the the right\nmedicine for one person may be different\nfor the medicine from the medicine and\nfor a different person depending on what\nkind of people they are and there are\nthree general kinds of people or the\nthree forces in our body which are Vata\nPitta and kapha and that depending on\nthe levels of your Vata Pitta and kapha\nit's they're gonna manifest in different\ntraits personality aspects mental\naspects psychological aspects physical\naspects all of these things relate to\nVata Pitta and kapha sovath --is learn\nthings very easily but also get\ndistracted very easily they have kind of\nlike an ADHD mind whereas guffaws like\nlearn things very slowly but also forget\nvery slowly\nand so if you understand what your door\nShai is then you can sort of adjust your\ndoor shots first of all if some are to\nhire or some are too low the other thing\nis that if you understand your door shy\nyou should play to your strengths so\npeople think that\num you know like if you're not driven\nand focused and ambitious that you're\nnot gonna be successful in life and like\nI look at my colleagues who are like\nresearchers and stuff like that and like\nI'm amazed by how much they can like go\nto work every day and just do the same\ndamn thing and then they get grants\nbecause they write these like 50 page\ngrant proposals that are just the most\nmind-numbing ly boring documents in the\nworld and then since they get grants and\nthey do research they apply for\ndifferent like fellowships and\npromotions and things like that and they\nget them because that's what's valued in\nacademia and so I look at them and I say\nlike oh man like it's so hard for me to\ndo research it's so hard for me to write\na grant proposal and so I think a little\nbit about like oh my god you know I I'm\nnot as good as they are but my strengths\nare simply different I'm Ivana so I'm\nWay more dynamic so if I want to be\nsuccessful I need to do like a few\ndifferent things like I suck at just\ndoing one thing but I do really well if\nI'm doing different things if I see a\nfew patients today and then like I\nscream in the evening and then I spent\nsome time writing and then you know I\nspend some time filming then that's like\na great day for me like today is a good\nexample so I took it easy in the morning\ndid some writing I we work together the\nrecovery coaches and I met for a little\nover an hour and a half and so I taught\nfor a couple of hours and then I\nstreamed for a couple of hours and I\nlike wrote like a manual like a chapter\nfor the recovery coach manual and that's\nwhat really\nworks\nright like that's what works for me like\nI can't do the same thing every day\nbut I'll do a better job if I'm doing\ntwo or three different things so I think\nthe main thing to understand about\npersonality is like when you when you\nlook at your personality doesn't matter\nwhether using five factor or\nmyers-briggs or IRA\nand\nwhat it really doesn't matter the main\nthing is that you understand like for\nthis\nsystem whatever system you're using to\nto understand yourself like just\nunderstand what the system says about\nyou and then develop a strategy based on\nwhat the system recommends play to your\nstrengths okay"
