    "transcript": "you can love your child with addiction\nyou can't get them to quit you can love\nyour mother you can support your mother\nyou can't keep her from losing it you do\nnot control that it's [ __ ] arrogant\nto think that the depth of human\narrogance is to think that you can\ncontrol another human being let alone\nyour own life\nokay so there's a question who has\nthere's someone who has a question about\nthe holiday season so the holiday season\nis here it's extremely stressful my\nfamily doesn't do a traditional\nChristmas celebration this puts me at\nodds with all of my extended family I'm\nlooking for a way to sort of bridge the\ngap and make any gathering at the very\nleast tolerable what are some steps to\ntake or a good way to show family\nmembers that we respect their traditions\nbut we don't wish to follow them so I\nthink that's a great question I think\nthat's the kind of thing that I can't\nsort of answer open-ended so I think if\nthis person wants to come on stream we\ncan talk about how to manage the\nholidays and the difficulties of\nmanaging the holidays so the holidays\nare a really tough time for a lot of my\npatients because like [ __ ] just gets\nstirred up like trauma and like\nexpectations and disappointment and\nshame and all that kind of stuff is\nfront and center so I think that's a\ngreat thing to come onto stream and talk\nabout if the person who posted that\nquestion is willing to talk okay\nso I have another there's another\nquestion here which I think is really\ngood but is also kind of off topic and\nsomething that I can answer yeah so many\ngood questions okay we still have to\nteach you guys how to meditate today\nright don't get hammered through the\nholidays not really a good\nrecommendation okay let me ask you guys\ndo you guys want sort of like I'll ask\nyou do you want to ask you want me to\ngrab okay so here's the next question\nso you guys tell me do you want me to\nanswer this question or do you guys want\nme to move on to something else\n[Music]\nbecause that's also pretty in-depth\nquestion okay I'm a bit in over my head\nI have a younger sister who was born\nwith cerebral palsy she's in her mid-20s\nnow in 2015 she was diagnosed with a\nrare blood cancer she's had two\nbone-marrow transplants the treatments\nshe's getting don't seem to be working\nI've always prepared for the invention\nthat once my parents passed on she would\ncome live with me I don't think this\nwill be the case I don't know how to be\nsupportive for my mother who is handling\nthe daily doctors and treatments I don't\nknow how to prepare myself for her\npotential passing and what what I would\nneed to do for my mother to keep her\nfrom well just losing it she shrugs my\nsuggestions for counseling for her with\nI've survived this long without it okay\nthis is a good question so this question\nhighlights a lot of principles that it\nis very important that you live your\nlife by that's why I love this question\nthere's a lot here okay the first\nquestion which I'm going to dodge for\ntoday even though this is about\nspirituality is how do we understand why\nsome people are born with cerebral palsy\nand like get rare blood cancers like how\nthe [ __ ] does that work how do we live a\nlife and which terrible things happen to\npeople that we love that is a very\nimportant question one that definitely\nneeds to be discussed but is worthy of\nan entire stream so we'll talk about\nthat one day I've always prepared for\nthe eventualities that once my parents\npassed on she would come live with me so\nnow we get to the first problem that the\nmind creates which is expectations so\nthe first question is where did you get\nthe idea\nand how attached are you to this idea\nthat this person is going to come live\nwith you\nright so we tend to have a moral compass\nwhich tells us that we should do certain\nthings but oftentimes that moral compass\ngets clouded by emotion so there's just\nsort of this idea that when parents pass\nthis person is gonna come live with me\nbecause I'm family and I'm the only one\nthat can take care of her so I'd stop by\nreally I'd start by really stopping and\nreally examining that statement so it\ncan feel like an [ __ ] to say that my\nsister with cerebral palsy is not gonna\ncome live with me you can feel like\nyou're letting her down but for someone\nwho has cerebral palsy I genuinely\nquestion whether this person is going to\nget the best care that they can if they\ncome live with you because a lot of\npeople their homes are not really\ndesigned to live and support someone\nwith special needs the best that they\ncan right we have to really think about\nthat like just because you feel guilty\nfor having not having her come live with\nyou if you feel like you're abandoning\nher if this person comes and lives with\nyou doesn't actually mean that you are\nthe best person to take care of her this\nis the first thing to understand what\nyou should think about is what it what\nis in the best interests of your sister\nand to recognize that it is possible\nthat your guilt is making you\nautomatically assume that the best thing\nfor your sister is to come and live with\nyou and then you feel guilty because\nyou're like oh my god like if this\nperson comes to live with me that's\ngonna be such a [ __ ] show I have to do\nthis I have to do this I have to do this\nI don't know if I'm gonna be able to\nhandle it but I have to it's the first\nthing I ask you is really do you have to\nis that really the best thing for your\nsister one of the most difficult things\nto realize is that you are not the best\nperson to help out people that you love\none of the most important things and I\nunderstand this because I work with\npeople with [ __ ] addictions and it\ntakes so much time for me to get through\nto parents and tell them that love is\nnot enough you can love your child as\nmuch as you want to that\ndoesn't mean that you can help them\nblows their [ __ ] mind\nthe parents who end up okay are the ones\nthat realize that love is not enough\nthat in our life circumstances are\nimportant resources are important\nchoices are important the choices of the\nones that you love are important parents\ncan bend over backwards to try to love a\nchild with addiction as much as they\nwant to doesn't mean it's gonna fix the\nchild that the child or the person with\naddiction has to take responsibility for\ntheir actions has to take responsibility\nfor their their life has to take\nresponsibility for their treatment love\nisn't enough you can't you can't love\nsomeone in your family to wellness I'm\nsorry\nyou just can't I know I try I tried when\nmy kid get kid get sick I try to bend\nover backwards to make give them every\nsingle comfort they can and sometimes\nthat's actually bad for them because if\nI say up all night patting them and then\nI'm a zombie the next day and I'm\nshort-tempered and I don't make them\nlike food and the food burns and it's\nnot delicious like taking care of\nyourself is sometimes really important\nbecause then you can better take care of\nother people there's a lot of research\non physician burnout you know how good\nwhat what the quality of medicine that a\nphysician who's burnt out practices they\npractice bad medicine they make mistakes\nthey're not compassionate if they burn\nthemselves out take care of yourself\nfirst then you can take care of other\npeople right simplest analogy that I\ntell people is that if you're trying to\nsave someone from drowning it's really\neasy if you're standing in the shallow\nend like if there's a three-year-old\nwho's like struggling for breath and\nyou're in the three-foot pool and you\njust stand up and you hold them they're\nnot gonna drown they're never gonna\ndrown you can just hold them it's easy\nno effort if you're in the deep end\nthen it's tough take care of yourself\nfirst establish a solid foundation first\nright\nwhy can I help you guys because I take\ncare of my [ __ ] at home it gives me\nstrength\nI'm calm thankfully I have a wonderful\nwife who's taking care of my children\nright now that I can be here on a Sunday\nbut my [ __ ] is taken care of at home she\nhelps me she supports me I'm supported I\nhave my feet on the ground five my feet\non the ground I can help you the first\nthing is where did you get that\nexpectation and understand that a lot of\nour suffering comes from the\nexpectations which we automatically make\nfor ourselves and that those\nexpectations and standards that we set\nup for ourselves are based on our\nemotions in the moment guilt guilt\ndoesn't make you think right shame\ndoesn't make you think right fear\ndoesn't make you think right everyone\nknows this yet we do not question the\nconclusions that come out of these\nemotions so the first is question that\nconclusion the first is is your sister\nactually better off with you I don't\nknow how to be supportive for my mother\nwho is handling the daily doctors and\ntreatments\nI don't okay so the first important\nquestion point to understand is just\nbecause you don't see the effect of your\nsupport and love doesn't mean it doesn't\nhave an effect right and so this person\ngoes on to say I don't know how to\nprepare myself for her potential passing\nand what I would need to do for my\nmother to keep her from well just losing\nit she shrugs off my suggestions for\ncounseling with I've survived this long\nwithout it so this person thinks I am\nmaking a suggestion the suggestion is\nbeing rejected therefore I'm not able to\nhelp my mother do you guys see that\nlogical chain make sense right what does\na psychiatrist do what does a therapist\ndo do we make suggestions no good ones\nusually don't I make a fair amount of\nnumber of suggestions but a lot of times\nwe don't make suggestions what do we do\nhow do we help people right when someone\ncomes in and says I'm depressed because\nI don't feel good about myself if I tell\nthem hey you should just go to gym\nchange your dye\nget yourself a stool transplant from a\nnun depressed rat and you'll be good\ndoesn't work right doesn't work what do\nwe do what is this person doing so this\nperson is so remember that in order to\nhelp someone they don't necessarily need\nto take your help I think one of the\nmost important things that you can offer\nanother human being is the knowledge\nthat you care about them that you love\nthem and that you support them they just\nhave to know that their I even have to\ntake your help so one of the most\nimportant things that I think people\nunderestimate is like you don't think\nyou're helping someone because they\ndon't seem to be changing but you don't\nrealize how much of an effect it has on\nthat person I don't know if you guys\nhave read like manifestos of school\nshooters but those people are like\nutterly alone utterly alone they have no\none right and so when you offer when you\ndemonstrate concern for someone you love\nand you say hey maybe you should get\ncounseling you don't realize that that\nperson feels less alone because you're\ncaring about them you're demonstrate is\ndemonstrating you're caring and so the\nother interesting thing is the mother\nhasn't lost it yet right think about\nthis for a second this is a mother who\nhas a child who has cerebral palsy\nmultiple blood cancers we're treatments\naren't working their life is a is\n[ __ ] his heart as hard as you can\npossibly imagine and then harder and the\nmother hasn't lost it yet why why I\nthink it's because this person is\nhelping because they're saying hey I see\nyou I see that you're struggling and I\nwant to help how can I help right that's\nwhat they're doing that's the signal\neven if they're turning down the help\nit's just enough to know that you're not\nutterly long and I don't know if you\nguys have ever been suicidal I imagine\nthere's a fair number of people in chat\nwho have been suicidal but like when\nyou're suicidal you just feel really\nreally alone right and if there's one\nperson who can make you feel not alone\nthat helps so much\nand so I think this person is doing a\nbetter job of taking care of their\nmother than they realize\nright now practically you can ask so I\nwould say that like practically you're\ndoing a better job than you think and\nalso I would consider using this\nphrasing which is I know that this is\nlike dealing with my sister is really\nhard and that you must be going through\na lot how can I best support you instead\nof suggesting something ask them ask an\nopen-ended question of how you can help\nso a lot of times when you try to help\nsomeone you give them suggestions you\nsay hey man I think you have a drinking\nproblem you need to go to [ __ ] rehab\nand they say no [ __ ] you\nright say hey man you should go to a you\nhave a [ __ ] drinking problem and they\nsay no hey man you're overweight you\nshould get your ass to the gym and stop\neating Cheetos and they say no so try\nthis hey I see you're really struggling\nright now this is stressful for me and\nI'm not even the primary caretaker of my\nsister what can I do to support you how\ncan I help how are you handling it and\nlet them run the show right instead of\njust making suggestions\nsee what they need and then ask them\nquestions instead of suggesting\ncounseling have you thought about\ngetting counseling and then if they ask\nthat if they say I've survived this long\nwithout it have you ever been in\ncounseling what do you think counseling\nis about do you think it could be\nhelpful\nwhat does counselling do for people\nright you can ask these kinds of\nquestions start exploring things with\nthem see how they feel ask them how they\nneed support and now the last part which\nis possibly the hardest I don't know how\nto prepare myself for her potential\npassing and what I would need to do for\nmy mother to keep her from well just\nlosing it okay now we come to the\nbiggest source of suffering in the world\nbiggest source of suffering in the world\nwhich is your [ __ ] arrogance that you\ncan control things for another human\nbeing that you can actually control your\nlife that you can control outcomes when\nI apply for a job and I really want that\njob there's a part of me that says that\nif I work hard enough I can get that job\nincorrect you do not control whether you\nget the job you just don't control it\nyou can work as hard as you [ __ ] want\nyou not saying you shouldn't work hard\nwhat I'm saying is be careful about the\nexpectation you create in your mind\nabout the result you can love your child\nwith addiction you can't get them to\nquit you can love your mother you can\nsupport your mother you can't keep her\nfrom losing it you do not control that\nit's [ __ ] arrogant to think that the\ndepth of human arrogance is to think\nthat you can control another human being\nlet alone your own life as a human being\nyou're entitled to your actions not the\nfruits of your actions I'm entitled to\nask a girl out I'm not entitled to her\nsaying yes I'm entitled to apply for a\njob I'm not entitled to get it I'm I'm\nentitled to my actions the more you\nrecognize that the more your life will\n[ __ ] turn around because people get\nso caught up in the outcomes of their\nactions when that girl says no I get\ndevastated I get [ __ ] depressed I\nfeel ashamed I don't leave the house why\nbecause you felt like you were in\ncontrol if I was different she would\nhave said yes if I was more studly she\nwould have said yes if I was a [ __ ]\nChad she would have said yes right if I\nwas dot dot dot dot dot she would have\nsaid yes I'm not good enough because she\ndid not say yes that's the [ __ ]\nproblem devote yourself to your actions\nyou don't control whether she says yes\nyou don't control whether your mother\ntakes your help you don't control\nwhether your mother loses it you don't\ncontrol whether your loved one gets\nrecovery from\ndiction or not you do not control that\nall you control is what you do you get\nto control showing up that's all you get\nyou get to show up today I showed up\ntoday you guys showed up that's what you\ncontrol Joro\nthis morning showed up right he doesn't\ncontrol whether he finds a job he\ncontrols whether he takes a [ __ ] walk\nboolie us a couple weeks ago controls\nwhether he cleans his room it's all he\ncontrols he doesn't control the number\nof people who log on to his twitch\ndoesn't control anything all you control\nis your actions the problem is that\npeople get so caught up in the\nconsequences of their actions they get\nso pissed off and disappointed and a\nshame that the world didn't turn out the\nway they want and they don't even\n[ __ ] understand you don't have you\ndon't have control over that you don't\nyou don't get to do that you don't get\nto decide whether you were born with\ncerebral palsy you don't get to decide\nwhether you were born with lupus you\ndon't get to decide any of that you have\nso little control in life and the more\nthat you understand that the better your\nlife will go because then you focus on\nthe action right you stop worrying about\nthe result you focus on the action I\ndidn't apply for a job oh that means I'm\nnot good enough [ __ ] it\nI'm ashamed I'm not good enough what's\nthe point in applying that's what\nhappens when you focus on the result if\nyou don't focus on there's a line I was\nnever entitled the job to begin with I\napplied I didn't get it what am I gonna\ndo today I'm gonna apply for another\n[ __ ] job\nthat's how you change your life so for\nthis person I don't know how\nher potential passing and what I would\nneed to do for my mother okay so this is\nimportant I don't know how to prepare\nmyself for her potential passing that is\nwhat you control is to prepare yourself\nfor the eventualities that's what you\ncontrol and what I would need to do for\nmy mother to keep her from well just\nlosing it you cannot do that you cannot\ndo that can't do that at all whether\nyour mother loses it or doesn't lose it\nnot your choice how you prepare for the\npassing that is your choice and so if\nyou feel like you're not moving forward\nin life if you're stuck do you feel like\na piece of [ __ ] I don't think you\nunderstand you don't control you're so\n[ __ ] arrogant you don't control at\nnearly as much as you want you just\ncontrol yourself that's all you are all\nyou have a Jinsu over right if you're\nplaying a game you don't control the\nNPC's stupid we don't assume that you\ndon't get to control the NPC you don't\nget to control\nwhat's inside the loot box you control\nthe PC right you control your character\nwhen you play dota or an MMO you just\ncontrol your guy right so how do you\nclimb MMR in team games you you climb\nMMR like if you're playing overwatch or\nLal or whatever how do you climb MMR you\njust rage and get your teammates give\nyou MMR no but everyone loves to do it\nright you love to rage at your teammates\ndoes it make you better at the game\n[ __ ] mill you want to get better\nthink about what you did wrong think\nabout yourself think about what you\ncontrol you don't control them you\ncontrol yourself you can influence them\nright you can be a toxic [ __ ]\nin-game you can be as toxic as you want\nto that'll influence them but whether\nyou respond to toxicity with toxicity\nthat's yours to control whether you get\nbetter at the game whether you climb MMR\ndepends on your actions that's all you\nget\nyou can play the best game of overwatch\nor dota or Lal or whatever you play pvp\nand an MMO and you don't actually get to\ndecide whether you win or lose because\nwhen you queue up your with four to five\nrandos right and depending on the randos\non your team in the randos on their team\nlike you're just 10% of the game that's\nall you are and that's how it is with\nlife - and you focus on that 10% your\nlife will start moving in the right\ndirection"
