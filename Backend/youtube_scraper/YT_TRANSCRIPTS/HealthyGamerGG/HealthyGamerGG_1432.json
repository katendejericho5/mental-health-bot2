    "transcript": "how would you help high achieving people\nlike pre-meds pre-law pre farm who\nstruggle with self-worth is a certain\nmeditation you would describe I got\ndrunk with a lot of pre meds that we\ncould go and they were telling these\nstories of therapy drugs with not\nsuccess they were happy with they were\nstruggling with their issues okay so\nhere's the thing so a lot of times so I\nhad a buddy who went to Harvard Law\nSchool and I asked him like after his\nfirst semester at Harvard Law School\nlike how he was enjoying it and he\nactually said like it's kind of crappy\nand I said like what makes what makes\nHarvard Law School so crappy and he's\nlike one of the work like the people are\njust awful and I said what do you mean\nthe people are awful and he says one of\nthe worst things you can do to someone\nwho has always been the best in their\nclass is to make them feel average and\nso what happens with a lot of these high\nachieving people is that they're used to\nbeing high achieving like in middle\nschool they had straight A's in high\nschool they had very good GPAs and so\nthey end up in in like a competitive\ncollege right you go to like an Ivy\nLeague school or something like that and\nyou're with a bunch of other pre-meds\nand then suddenly you have this identity\nbuilt on being smart and smarter than\neveryone else and suddenly you're\n[ __ ] average and the funny thing is\nthe more high achieving you are the\nworse the problem becomes because I want\nyou guys to envision someone who ends up\nat Harvard Medical School so not only\nwere they've at the top of their class\nin middle school and then in high school\nand then in college when they went to\ntheir Ivy League university and then\nwhen they wind up because you you rise\nhigher and higher and higher and you're\nalways the best and then you end up in a\nplace like HMS and then suddenly your\n[ __ ] average so you've been used to\nnot being average for even longer and\nit's becoming even no greater part of\nyour identity so the biggest problems\nyou see in self-worth or with the people\nwho are the highest achieving the higher\nachievement goes the bigger the problem\nis with self-worth it's that simple\nright\nthat's simple so what do you do about it\nwell that's a great question so I think\nthe best thing to do a couple of things\none is to understand that a lot of\npeople's identity is based on comparison\nso your sense of self worth is in\nreflection to the people around you that\nneeds to change you need to start to\nhave an identity that's based on\nyourself in isolation not in relation to\nsomeone else and if you think about\npeople who are like falling behind right\nso a lot of people that I work with a\nlot of people on Twitch gamers things\nlike that are upset because they're\nbehind so like I remember when I start I\nstarted medical school at the age of 27\nwhich means that the people that I\nentered school with who were pre-med\nlike when we were twenty I had a group\nof people who were pre-med right my\nfriends from pre-med classes and then at\n22 they graduated from college and they\ngo to medical school and they finish\nmedical school at 26 so I remember when\nI was 26 years old and they were moving\non Ravis residency and graduating they\nwould ask me hey man what are you up to\nnowadays and when they're graduating\nfrom medical school I would say I'm\napplying to medical school I didn't even\ntell them that because that's [ __ ]\nit's so shaming six years ago we were in\nthe same shoes and now I'm still\napplying to the school that you are\ngraduating from that's the comparative\nmindset and then you feel shame right\nand so you just got to stop comparing\nyourself there meditation techniques\naround that will do that today okay yeah\nso then then\nthe second part of this question is that\nthey were telling me stories of therapy\ndrugs etc that we're not succeeding yeah\nbecause like a drug is not gonna fix\nthat you guys get that like if you're\nused to being the smartest kid in the\nroom and that's what your identity has\nbeen based on since you were the age of\n10 and suddenly at the age of 22 the\nentire person that you are gets called\ninto question because your average a\nmedication is not going to fix that it's\njust not going to fix it so like a\nmedication can help with some of the\nsymptoms of that but it's not gonna fix\nit\nso what you've got to do is give people\na sense of worth or a sense of identity\nthat is based on themselves as opposed\nto not on comparison and if you could do\nthat they're gonna be fine"
