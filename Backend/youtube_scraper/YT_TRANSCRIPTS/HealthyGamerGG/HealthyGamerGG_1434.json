    "transcript": "okay hi would you ever want want to or\nbe willing to do an informational type\nof interview on stream we've talked a\nbit about your history and how you got\nto your point as a psychiatrist but I\nand probably other people have several\nquestions on what led you to your path\nwhy the medical field why psychiatrist /\npsychologist thoughts on psychotherapy\nversus medication what factors do you\nthink led you to being accepted to\nmedical school\num yeah so I can talk about that now so\nit sounds like people are interested in\nmy bio in my background\nwhat led me to my path so I'll start\nand there are a couple of so the\nquestion is what led me to my path why\nthe medical field why a psychiatrist / a\npsychologist thoughts on psychotherapy\nversus medication what factors led you\nto think that you think led you to being\naccepted into Medical School so let's\nstart with\noh okay let's just start with with the\nfirst question okay so how did I get\nhere so I think my journey starts with\nplaying a bunch of video actually I mean\nif you guys really want to get into it I\nthink my journey starts with playing\nvideo games because I was a year ahead\nso I went to this like very like small\nschool that had a very high teacher to\nstudent ratio\nand so in the span of being like in in\nthat school for two years I basically\nlike skipped a grade and so then what\nhappened as I entered the first grade is\nlike a five year old and a six year old\nI guess a second grade is a six year old\nor something with that I was one year\nyounger than than all of my classmates\nand so the first thing that happened is\nI sucked at sports because I was like a\nfive-year-old competing against\nsix-year-olds if you think about that\nlike a five-year-old is just not gonna\ncompete on any level with six-year-olds\nand so I think that you know what what\nhappened is like I started off being bad\nat sports and then I gravitated towards\nvideo games because like in video games\nI could be just as good as my colleagues\nand the reason that I was I started to\nbelieve I was bad at sports and I was\nunathletic but the truth was just I was\njust a year younger so there's no way\nthat a five-year-old is gonna be able to\nrun as fast as a six year old six year\nolds ROP absolutely correct unless\nyou're a six year old competing against\nseven year olds\nand then so I started playing a lot of\nvideo games and then like started sort\nof become directionless fall behind had\na bunch of ego and stuff like that in\nhigh school and then basically was\nfailing out of college and then ended up\ngoing to India at the age of 21 because\nmy life was going nowhere I had like\nless than a 2.0 GPA was failing all that\ngood stuff\nand when I was in India like discovered\nyoga and meditation and really loved it\nso I loved that like so we study stuff\nright like we study mathematics and we\nstudy science and we study neuroscience\nand we study economics and sociology and\npsychology and we formally like sit down\nand say like I can get mastery over this\nfield of the world if I sit down and\nsystematically learn\nwhat I found with like yoga and\nmeditation and Ayurveda was a system to\nunderstand myself in like a methodical\nway then I can sit down and study Who I\nam and how I work as a person and then I\ncan get better at like being me and I\nlove that like I I found answers to so\nmany questions like everything that\nwe're talking about on stream like these\nurges that we have like I feel like\ncleaning more after I clean like how\ndoes that work there is a principle\nunder which that works like why you feel\nlike claiming cleaning why you feel the\nshame why you want to ask someone out\nwhy you can't ask someone out why you\nplay video games why you can't stop\nplaying video games why you can't like\nstart writing a 10 page paper why you\ncan't start approach reading a really\nlong text book this is all random crap\nbut there's a system to understand how\nall of it works right this is the system\nof understanding a human being which is\nliterally what yoga is\nYoga is about understanding eat not like\nAsin which is what they do at yoga\nstudios but true yoga in its original\nlike form in its truest form which\ndidn't really get translated over to the\nWest didn't really cross the pond mostly\nstayed in India it's about understanding\nhow human being works because there are\nlaws and principles that govern your\nphysiology or neuroscience psychology\nright and so then like getting back to\nmy life so I was like okay this is\nreally cool that I'm learning all this\nstuff from a yoga perspective but I'm a\nskeptic by nature and I like references\nso I'm gonna understand the sign so I\nbecame a researcher as I started to have\nlike experiences in meditation that were\nsuper trippy and like really cool I was\nlike what the f is going on in my brain\nduring these times like I have a brain\nlike how does that work so I started off\ndoing EEG studies on meditators so this\nis measuring the electrical activity in\nthe brain\nduring meditation I was like that's\npretty cool I like that and then I\nstarted doing neuroscience research I\ndid that for a couple of years and then\nI decided that like I wasn't gonna\nbecome a monk because I met my wife fell\nin love et cetera and so I was like well\nI have to do something so what do I want\nto do\nand I decided to become a doctor for a\ncouple of reasons the truest reason I\nbecame a doctor is because my one of my\nteachers told me that unless you can\nsucceed in in material in the material\nworld you're not gonna succeed in the\nspiritual because anything you do in the\nmaterial world is gonna be way easier\nthan what you do in the spiritual world\nbecause the real world is like like for\nnoobs and the spiritual world is for\nexperts pros go to the spiritual world\nthat's what he told so it's like okay\n it I'm gonna just set a goal for\nmyself and was kind of arbitrary to be\ncompletely honest it was really somewhat\narbitrary I was like I'm gonna become a\ndoctor just because it's hard because\nit's hard and I have a 2.5 GPA but so\nthat seems impossible so I'm gonna do\nthat because if I can do that then I'm\ngonna succeed in meditation that's\nthat's literally how it worked and there\nwere a couple of other factors so one\nwas that I didn't while I loved kind of\npsychology in the mind I didn't so I\nread that doesn't de Voort like doesn't\nseparate different fields of medicine\nlike they don't think that you don't\nhave a psychiatrist and a cardiologist\nyou have one person who does everything\nand the reason that they do everything\nthey specialize more in terms of methods\nbut not like organs\nand so what I what I liked about like so\nI just didn't believe that like you can\nunderstand the mind without\nunderstanding the body and that's why I\ndecided to become a psychiatrist instead\nof a psychologist sort of it's kind of\nlike it's not quite like that because\nthe order of operations was a little bit\ndifferent but that's why I like becoming\na medical doctor and I didn't shift\ngears because I wanted to understand the\nbody as well as the mind and and I know\nthat psychologists don't get a lot of\nbodily training and I know that that's\nkind of how our system works but I think\na lot of emerging evidence around like\nbrain got stuff clearly demonstrates\nthat there's a link between the body and\nthe mind and I ultimately the end of the\nday I feel like if you don't understand\nthe body you're depriving yourself of a\nlot of tools to help them on\nI just a fact it doesn't mean that\npsychologists aren't good at what they\ndo it doesn't mean that they can't do a\nwonderful job it's just in my opinion I\nwanted to understand it all\nlike I like understanding spirituality I\nlike understanding neuroscience I like\nunderstanding everything I don't like\nunderstanding just one part of something\nlike that feels incomplete to me so it's\nfine to have a trippy experience in\nmeditation what's it doing to my brain I\nwant to know that neuroscientific I want\nto understand how things work that's why\nI decided to become a psychiatrist sort\nof when I went to medical school it was\nstill sort of this idea of like okay I'm\njust gonna like set a target and it's\ngonna be kind of arbitrary so I actually\ndecided to become a oncologist first and\na switch to psychiatry in my fourth year\nhow do we fix brain gut stuff we'll talk\num so I decided to become a psychiatrist\nactually in my fourth year because I\nrealized that like actually I don't know\nwhy I didn't realize this sooner but I\nactually really liked the mind and\nthat's always been what's interested in\nme so I decided to do psychiatry um but\nI you know I some thoughts that\npsychiatrists aren't real doctors and\nall that good stuff because like my dad\nwas an oncologist and I sort of\nidealized him and things like that and\nlike I wanted to be a real doctor\ndoes I still had a lot of ego right so I\nwanted to be someone that saves lives\nand like treats heart attacks and like\nI'm gonna cure cancer I'm gonna be a\nsurgeon I was like debating becoming a\ntrauma surgeon for a little while and\nwas like leaning towards oncology\nbecause I wanted to be like a holistic\ncancer doctor use like herbs treat\ncancer and then like teach them yoga and\nteach them how to meditate and like help\nthem become what connected with their\nspirituality before they died and like\nall this good stuff\nand so that's kind of how I became a\npsychiatrist"
