    "transcript": "blows my [ __ ] mind but meditation\nliterally protects you from heart\nattacks literally physiologic mechanisms\nit's like anyone a fourth-year medical\nstudent if I took the time if we were\ntalking on chat I could walk a\nfourth-year medical student through this\nprocess it's not BS it's just literally\nhow our body works\nas well learn something new we're doing\nphysical meditation dadbod or do you\nguys want to do something a little bit\nmore mental how about I teach you guys\nhow to breathe okay so I'm gonna teach\nyou guys how to breathe so so thanks for\nthe sob gizmo so here's here's what\nwe're gonna do I want you guys to just\nbreathe in we're gonna start with\nabdominal breathing so I want you to do\nis try to hold your chest as steady as\npossible and as you breathe in I want\nyou to push your stomach out and as you\nbreathe out I want you to pull pull your\nstomach in and pull your navel towards\nyour spine sound on notifications is\nvery loud alert box okay I'll teach you\nguys how to sit - we'll teach you how to\nsit posture is easy so I want you guys\nwhen you breathe out so I'm gonna stop\nreading to it shut\nso stop typing because if you're typing\nyou're probably not breathing so when\nyou breathe in let your navel come out\nwhen you breathe out pull your stomach\nin\nnow I want you guys to watch regular\nbreath so watch my shoulders\nthat's right dealer breath right you\nguys see how much my chest and shoulders\nare moving abdominal breath you guys got\nthat\nso Valley comes out when you inhale and\nbelly moves back in when you exhale okay\nso now we're gonna add the second phase\nof what this practice is called\ntriphasic breathing so now when you're\nfully inhaled with your belly then what\nI want you to do is mindfully expand\nyour chest and then breathe more so\nthere's gonna be like a second phase you\nguys feel that so valley first then\nchest and what you'll find is that you\ncan actually breathe more than you can\nwith just your belly if you do the chest\nbreathing after so let's practice that\nfor three rounds\nand then what we're gonna do the is the\nfinal phase the third phase of triphasic\nbreathing which is gonna be you're gonna\nraise your shoulders which is gonna be\nclavicular breathing so you have three\nareas which kind of control in the\nexpansion of your lungs your valley\nwhich is your diaphragm your chest so\nchest expansion is gonna be like your\nyour muscles around your rims and the\nthird area is actually your clavicles so\nwhen you breathe in expand the chest and\nthen lift up your shoulders and you'll\nbe able to get just a little bit like\nfive percent more breath in and then do\neach phase at a time so start with\nabdomen chest clavicles abdomen chest\nand clavicles if you feel dizzy take\nbreaks between your breaths dizziness is\nfrom elevated co2 I mean a co2 that's\ntoo long\nif you're yawning that's fine just go\nahead and yawn don't suppress it and\nthen go back to the practice so now\nclose your eyes and do five rounds on\nyour own\nstart with the belly transition to the\nchest raise the shoulders and then out\nI'd say you should do this practice\nbefore you charge your laser beams but\nI'm going to stop talking for a minute\nwe're going to do five breaths\nyou\nokay I'm going to answer a bunch of\nquestions that I see okay so the first\nthing is can you change the way you\nsubconsciously breathe during the day\nyes so if you practice breathing you'll\nstart to breathe less from the chest and\nmore from the abdomen you can train\nyourself to breathe deeper you can train\nyourself to breathe slower absolutely\nsecond question domination time asks co2\nto low it equals dizziness what about\nco2 too high is that the same thing\nabsolutely not so spiritual experiences\nin meditation are believed to be due to\nsort of like toxic levels of co2 in the\nbrain so when you start to get a trippy\nexperience during meditation the most\nprevailing or at least I think the best\nneuroscience theory for why people feel\nlike an expansion of consciousness and\nother things like that is is due to\nelevated levels of co2 so what happens\nwhen you meditate on a very regular\nbasis is your body acclimatize --is to\nlow levels of oxygen in high levels of\nco2 and a very low respiratory rate okay\nso if that means is that for a normal\nhuman so I see someone understands\nrespiratory physiology and chat and says\nco2 too high equals acidosis equals more\nbreathing yes that's the standard\nphysiologic response when your co2 is\nelevated your brain tells you to breathe\nmore so that you can breathe off that\nco2 the interesting thing is when you\nmeditate your body becomes acclimatized\nto high levels of co2 to where it\nrecruits other kinds of mechanisms that\ndon't require rapid breathing and when\nyou meditate up for a very regular basis\nyou begin to have a very low respiratory\nrate but it doesn't damage you you\nshouldn't try to restrict your\nrespiratory rate it's just like when you\nguys meditate like I don't know if you\nguys realize this but your respiratory\nrate is dropping right when you do like\ntriphasic Barre\nlike it's not hard to do like five\nbreaths a minute like it's really not\nlike each breath that was like a\n15-second breath like maybe 12 or 15 and\nso if I if it takes me if I breathe in\nfor seven seconds and breathe out for\nseven seconds\nthat's a respiratory rate of four per\nminute that's four breaths a minute\nright which is like not that hard to do\nI can tell you breathe in for seven\nthat's a 15-second breath so what\nhappens in meditation is that you your\nbody becomes acclimatize to high levels\nof co2 in the brain and what people\nbelieve is that when you have high\nlevels of co2 in the brain for prolonged\nperiods of time you actually start to\nhave like a trippy spiritual experience\nthe other thing that's really\nfascinating is one of the ways through\nwhich meditation protects you from heart\nattacks is the other thing so it does a\nquestion for chat does anyone know what\nyour heart does when it becomes starved\nfor oxygen who let's test people's\nphysiologic knowledge what is your heart\ndo when it it doesn't get enough oxygen\nyou guys know\n[Music]\nokay it dilates the coronary that's\ncorrect\nand what is the long-term effect of\nchronic hypoxia on the heart\nvasodilation is a temporary effect so it\nsends signals to create collateral\ncirculation right so when you're when\nyour heart is starved for oxygen so this\nis what happens in the heart as your\narteries get clogged the heart\nangiogenesis that's correct so as your\nheart as your arteries get clogged the\namount of space through which blood can\ntravel to nourish your heart goes down\nas you get a blocked artery your heart\nstarts to become starved for oxygen as\nit becomes starved for oxygen it does\ntwo things it sends immediate signals to\ndilate the artery so if we dilate the\nartery we increase its it's like how\nwide it is which facilitates more flow\nthe other thing that it does is sends\nsignals to create more blood vessels\nangiogenesis right so when you meditate\nfor prolonged periods of time your\noxygen levels start to go lower but not\nin a damaging way because it's like a\nchronic thing your body acclimatize us\nto it and it sends signals to your heart\nto create collateral circulation which\nin turn means that if you've got a\nblocked coronary artery in your\nirregular meditator the damage from that\ncoronary artery is going to be way less\nbecause your body has developed\nalternate paths of circulation through\nmeditation blows my [ __ ] mind\nbut meditation literally protects you\nfrom heart attacks literally physiologic\nmechanisms it's like anyone a\nfourth-year medical student if I took\nthe time if we were talking on chat I\ncould walk a fourth-year medical student\nthrough this process it's not BS\nit's just literally how our body works\nas our breathing rate goes down our\noxygen level goes down and you can't\nnormally meditate like for 20 minutes a\nday until you get really good at it and\nthen like you have these stories of like\nthese Yogi's in the Himalayas that go\ninto like semi semi hibernation states\nright and like I don't know if you guys\nhave heard about this stuff then you've\ngot other stuff like wim HOF who does\nlike you guys heard about wim HOF the\nIceman so this is a guy that like\nlearned this nepalese like this\nHimalayan meditation technique which is\nwhat they do to stay warm so you have\nlike these Yogi's that are living in the\nHimalayas that are like not wearing\ncoats they just like hang out there in\nlike a simple shawl and the reason that\nthey can sustain that is because they do\nbizarre things to their physiology and\nlike wim HOF is a guy who learned this\nstuff and then it has like all these\nlike like physiologists like testing him\nthey stick him in like sub sub-zero like\ntemperatures and he like doesn't get\nfrostbite or die he just is fine\nso like meditation has a lot of profound\nimpacts on the human body okay so we've\ngot a couple of other questions so let\nme just get to these okay so Tom you\nshouldn't be anteriorly translating your\nt3 t4 vertebra your clavicles should be\ngoing up not forward if that makes sense\nokay so people are asking questions\nabout when I try to made it say I worry\na lot about it not going as well as it\nwent before that makes it very hard to\nclear my mind any advice congratulations\nMatt the Strummer also asked is it\nnormal for meditation to go really well\nat first but then get more difficult\nafter a while absolutely so the tricky\nthing about meditation is the way that\nyou enter the know mind state of\nmeditation is by having no expectations\nright so like the first time if you guys\nwere around for charging the laser beam\ntechnique we did a meditation technique\nand I ask people what does it feel like\nand one person to chat literally said it\nfeels like I'm charging a laser beam and\nthe cool thing is like when I don't tell\nyou what to expect your mind cannot have\nan expectation and therefore you could\nsit fully with the experience once you\nsit with an experience and you feel like\nyou have some kind of experience in\nmeditation then that creates an\nexpectation to have that experience\nagain and that expectation makes it hard\nto meditate so the most difficult\nspiritual experience to have in\nmeditation is the second one not the\nfirst one the first one is actually easy\nand then once you start expecting then\nit becomes hard because then you're\nattached to that meditation then you\ncreate the thought oh this isn't working\nit's not I'm not feeling the way that I\nused to feel it's not working the way\nthat it used to this isn't working\nthat's what you tell yourself when you\nmeditate and that thought in and of\nitself is why you don't get into\nmeditation the state of meditation so is\nit hard for it to happen is it hard for\nlike you to do it after a while\nabsolutely that's the most common\nchallenge in meditation and the cool\nthing is once you recognize that okay\nthe reason I'm not able to meditate is\nbecause I'm trying to meditate and the\nreason I'm trying to meditate is because\nnow I understand what meditation is\nbecause I did it before\nthat's a bizarre and paradoxical and\nwonderful hilarious challenge and so I\nwould say like Matt and this person who\nasked this question is it hard\nabsolutely just recognize that recognize\nthat for some time it's gonna be harder\nfor me to get that meditation going\nagain and then also to return to the\ntechnique so your thought is you're\ngonna have all these thoughts right\nyou're gonna be like oh it's not working\nit's not working just go back to the\ntechnique just focus on your breath\nignore whether it's working stop trying\nto make it work if it's working that's\nfine if it's not working that's fine to\njust focus on the technique just focus\non the technique focus on the technique\nfocus on the technique the more you\nfocus on the technique that's what got\nyou there in the first place that's what\nwill get you there again"
