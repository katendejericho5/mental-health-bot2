    "transcript": "okay so I'm getting more votes for ego\nso this is what I want you guys to do\nokay okay so we'll start with ego but\nit'll help with it so everything helps\neverything so it's not okay there now\nthings are evenly divided buddy\nso this is what I do you guys have a\ncandle anyone have a candle\nokay I know candles are becoming extinct\nso I want you guys to take your I mean\nthis is gonna be weird so I use the\nmiddle finger but I'm not trying to flip\nyou guys off it's just\nlet's do this\nokay so normally I curl in my thumb but\nthen maybe I'll get banned from my Jesus\nif we use more than one thing and I want\nyou to take your middle finger and put\nit\nI'm trying to think about maybe like a\ncentimeter like a tiny tiny amount away\nfrom the area between your eyebrows\nand then\nI don't know how else to say this but do\nyou guys feel something\nlike don't touch it\nbut just leave it like very close\nright and then so\nso it's kind of weird like it's [ __ ]\nweird so just close your eyes and just\nfocus on that sensation\nyou\ntry to keep your hands study just focus\non patient\nyou\nnow with your eyes closed I want you to\nrelax your hand put your hand down sit\nup straight and just focus put all of\nyour concentration on the spot on the\nforehead where you felt something\nor the spot kind of between your\neyebrows\nyou\nright adjust if you're having trouble\nconcentrating on the spot just feel that\nspot\nyou\nyou can concentrate on the spot you can\nfeel the spot and then this is gonna\nsound kind of weird too if you're having\ntrouble or not having trouble try to\nmove towards it like try to imagine that\nyour attention is like a ray of light\nand that it's like moving towards that\nspot or even out of that spot\nyou\nwhen you're ready go ahead and come back\nslowly exhale prize how do you feel\nYeah right so your your ability to\ndetect color\nChangez\ngo calm\nnow I'm gonna ask you guys I almost feel\nlike we should do perfect that's good so\nI feel like we should do like a group\ndiscord voice thing because when I teach\nmeditation I like to ask people about\ntheir experiences and I just don't like\nthat's okay so I like to ask people\nabout what they felt so I'm gonna ask\nyou guys like what did you feel over the\ncourse of that did you feel any\nsensations how would you describe what\nyou felt\nfinger\nhow did how did it feel when you closed\nyour eyes\nright so like\nnow see this is cool right because let\njust look at twitch at like something is\nhappening\nsomeone felt tickling someone felt like\nit shined a light on their skull someone\nfelt like an eye ripple like a wave like\nit's [ __ ] weird but this is what I\nlove about meditation is that when you\ndo a good meditation technique like a\nproper meditation technique you start to\nfeel really cool stuff\nand\nand so what I love about it is like when\nyou so people think that like meditation\nis just like Oh calm your mind like\nobserve your thoughts like no man like\nthat's not what meditation is about\nmeditation is about experiencing like\nwonderful and amazing things it's about\nlike feeling sensations like like you\nknow if you have like an out-of-body\nexperience with meditation in like\nsomeone said like it felt like charging\nlike I was charging up a laser beam\nthat's like that's [ __ ] cool like\nthat's why I meditate like I got into\nmeditation not to attain inner peace\nlike what I loved about it when I went\nto India's people were teaching me stuff\nthat gave me like cool experiences\nbecause I like laser beams I liked\nplaying video games with laser beams and\nI like the experience of charging up a\nlaser beam like that's just cool and so\nif you guys are doing this stuff like\nthat's awesome I'm glad you guys felt\nthis stuff because over time as you\nstart to practice more and more this is\njust the first time you guys have been\nmeditating you learn this you learn this\ntechnique like 60 you did it for 60\nseconds and this is what you felt you\nfelt yourself charging up a laser beam\nafter 60 seconds of meditation now you\ngo you walk down the street and you ask\na dozen people that you meet hey have\nyou ever felt like you're charging up\nyour inner laser beam like people aren't\ngoing to know what the [ __ ] you're\ntalking about but how cool is that that\nthat's actually your experience\nlike it's insane this is what meditation\nis about it's cultivating inner\nexperience right and the like people are\nalso talking a little bit about you know\nso one person says bad boy killer gaming\nsays during all this time I couldn't\nstop giggling lurk nervously and then\nlike it also said like all I could feel\nwas my anxiety fighting to keep itself\nalive like absolutely so the first thing\nis that if sensations come out in\nmeditation like let them come out that's\nhow it heals you so you guys have like\nyou know we were talking about anger\nbeing depression depression is anger\nturned against the self anxiety and\npanic is like his bipolar tendencies of\nlike energy and movement being\nsuppressed so when stuff gets suppressed\nlike it comes out in a maladaptive way\nand so the other cool thing about\nmeditation is that when we start to\nmeditate like some of this weird stuff\nthat's buried starts to come up and the\ncool thing is sometimes what's buried is\nactually positivity\nif you felt like giggling and nervous\nlike that's cool like you should be\ngiggling like giggling is so people talk\nabout meditation cultivates bliss the\nfirst step of bliss is giggling giggling\nis something that people don't do enough\non like if we think about children who\nare like innocent and pure and happy in\nthe simplest way they giggle very easily\nand you think about people like\nourselves like gamers who are you know\ngamers may laugh they'll laugh at the\ndankest of memes right you'll laugh at\nmaulding but giggling is different\nlike there's no schadenfreude and\ngiggling like you when you know\nschadenfreude is like you know maulding\nis about schadenfreude there's like\nsomething vicious about that it's like\nlaughing at someone else's expense it's\nmaking fun of them it's a really like\nyou know nice and baked and burnt burnt\nlike dank mean like that's you know\nthat's a gamer humor and that can be\nfunny but giggling is something simple\nin its pure so if you start to\nexperience that during meditation let it\ncome out and then the other thing is I\nmean so bad boy killer gaming says all I\ncould feel was my anxiety fighting to\nkeep itself alive absolutely so what we\nwanted we want to teach you something\nwhere the negative causes of your\nsuffering are struggling to stay alive\nwhereas most of the time your anxiety\nisn't fighting to keep itself alive\nyou're fighting the anxiety to keep\nyourself alive so in 60 seconds if we\ncould create a situation where your\nanxiety is struggling to stay alive and\nyou're charging up your [ __ ] laser\nbeams like I'll take it that's why you\nguys should meditate forget about all\nthis like neuroscience stuff it's not\nabout Neurosci like sure we talked about\nneuroscience we talked about physiology\nwe talked about cortisol we talk about\nbuilding creativity and focus and\nempathy and all that stuff is important\nbut that's not the real reason we\nmeditate the real reason we meditate is\nbecause of all of this it's for the\nexperience and in the effects of it down\nthe road or great but it's really about\nthe experience\nyes Oh artificial intelligence says I\nthink I'm ready to come on entrepreneur\nburnout you can fix this we can talk\nabout it but remember I can't I can't\nfix anything right because I'm not\nallowed to dispense medical advice over\nthe inter I'm happy to talk to you about\nit so go ahead and sign up\nyeah so one thing I would be careful\nabout\nso digital dude one asks so that was the\nego meditation as the anxiety one a\ndifferent technique yes\nthe anxiety ones a different technique\nyou because okay we can do that one\nlet's do that one too I've taught this\none I think on screen before so the\nfirst thing you guys need to do is sit\nup straight we're gonna do an anxiety\nmeditation that I'm gonna talk to you\nguys for a little while\nis to set up straight\nso it's important that your back be\nstraight\nand one day I need to teach you guys how\nto set so we'll do that one day\nand\nyou\nwe're gonna do an anxiety tech yeah you\ncan lie on the floor uh it's going to be\nhard to lie on the floor for this one\nso donut my desk is anxiety good is\nmeditation good for anxiety so\nmeditation is good for all kinds of\nthings like there's studies that show\nthat anxiety is helpful for insomnia\nit's helpful for anxiety it's helpful\nfor depression but what I think Western\nscience doesn't understand is like they\ndon't understand the specificity of\ntechniques so like if you go to India\nand you learn so I studied for several\nyears and I learned like lots of\ndifferent kinds of meditation from\ndifferent people in different traditions\nand my experience has been that\nmeditation like different kinds of\nmeditations are good for different\nthings and yes that first one so the\nthird eye' meditation is is for ego"
