    "transcript": "the instinct when you feel overwhelmed\nis to actually do less but the other\nsecret solution is for you to be doing\nmore to take on more\nstudy zero okay so let's talk about what\nit means to feel overwhelmed so I want\nyou guys to think about\nbeing overwhelmed so we have two kinds\nof challenges in life one kind of\nchallenge is something that I call a\npassive challenge which is a challenge\nthat we don't get to choose so passive\nchallenges happen to us\nand\nactive challenges are the things that we\nchoose to do so passive challenges is\nwhat life throws our way and active\nchallenges are what we what we kind of\nthrow it ourselves so if I decide that\nyou know I'm gonna like write a book one\nday like I get up every day and I like\nwork on a book or let's use a real\nexample so I decided that I was gonna\nstart streaming and as I made the\ndecision to start streaming that's a lot\nof work and in theory it should be\nexhausting but in actuality like I find\nit enjoyable and invigorating at the end\nof it sure I'm tired but it's like a\nchallenge that I choose to take myself\nand a passive challenge is like\nsomething that happens to me like when\nI'm prescribing a medication and the\ninsurance company denies it and then\nlike I have to spend hours with them on\nthe phone to try to get a patient of\nmine a medication that they need that's\na passive challenge like I didn't choose\nto do that it's a challenge that I have\nto overcome that like life threw at me\nand what I want you guys to understand\nis that when you feel overwhelmed in\nlife there's a disconnect between your\npassive challenges and your active\nchallenges when your passive challenges\noutweigh your active challenges is when\nyou begin to feel overwhelmed so Lucy\nwas talking about a maze right and like\nwe feel overwhelmed because there's too\nmuch going on and the funny thing though\nis that the feeling of overwhelmed comes\nfrom a discrepancy between active\nchallenges and passive challenge so when\nlife is throwing more at you not more\nyou than you can handle but more at you\nthan what you throw at yourself is is\nwhen you feel overwhelmed so the\nfascinating thing is that there are two\nways to stop feeling overwhelmed the the\nwhat most people think is that I need to\nlife is throwing more at me that I need\nto handle so I need to reduce the amount\nthat life is throwing at me right that's\none way to fix being overwhelmed and the\nother thing to recognize about being\noverwhelmed is people who feel\noverwhelmed feel like they're not in\ncontrol of their destiny those two\nthings are synonymous being overwhelmed\nis not being in control\nthe funny thing though is once you\nunderstand this relationship between\npassive and active challenges the other\nthing that you can realize is the other\nway to stop feeling overwhelmed is to\nactually add active challenges to your\nlife is to bite on like choose more\nthings about your life that you want to\ndo and the crazy thing is that is you\nstart to do that your sense of feeling\noverwhelmed starts to go away\nand if you think about like what what\nthat's practically doing to your\npsychology is you start to take control\nover your life because if I say like\nokay so I have a bunch of stuff I should\nbe doing right I have a private practice\nI have academic work I'm trying to put\ntogether a study I'm doing some\nconsulting work and so you and then\nthere's like all this insurance stuff I\nhave to do I have to do stuff around\nlicenses I have to pay parking tickets I\nhave to get my car registered life is\nthrowing a bunch of crap at me\nand so the funny thing is when I feel\noverwhelmed like one solution is to\nactually choose something that I want to\ndo and just work on that and as I add\nact of challenges to my life I start to\nfeel less overwhelmed even though I'm\ndoing more the instinct when you feel\noverwhelmed is to actually do less but\nthe other secret solution is for you to\nbe doing more to take on more to start\nto take control over something that you\nget to choose in your life and when you\nstart taking on active challenges you\nfeel in control you start to feel\naccomplished you start to feel good\nabout yourself and then you\nautomatically feel less overwhelmed it's\nlike a mathematical principle of\npsychology\nas we as our active challenges go away\nwe start to build up energy because\nactive challenges is one way that we\nexpend energy right if I decide that I'm\ngonna start twitch streaming I'm gonna\nfeel exhausted in about 10 minutes but\nit's a way in which I'm expending energy\nand all anxiety is is unused energy so\nas you adopt an active challenge you\nstart to expend energy and then your\nmind has less energy left over for\nanxiety and if we think about like what\nis anxiety anxiety is just energy\nbouncing around in your head it's just\nthoughts bouncing around in your head\nthat never go away anxiety is a disorder\nof excess mental energy those you adopt\nactive challenges you start spending\nyour energy you start to feel like\nyou're in control of things and then\nlike the feeling of going feeling\noverwhelmed just goes away\nand that's that's it\nlike the more you get control over your\nlife relates to like how much active\nchallenge you take on and the more\nto challenge you take on like the less\noverwhelmed you're going to feel\nand I feel like I should keep talking\nbut that's it and it's simple\nright so how do you actually get\nyourself to actually do things so you\nactually decide to do stuff\nright so like Lord Ghoulia's is doing it\nhe started cleaning his room\nguys remember like hooli has started to\nfeel better about himself when he\ncleaned his room like why because before\nhe cleaned his room like life was\noverwhelming right Ghoulia's that's\nanother way to describe like so we\ntalked about a lot of feelings but I\nwould say that you felt overwhelmed by\nlife and you felt less overwhelmed by\ncleaning your room so how does that work\nwe can use the frame of passive and\nactive challenges\nto to recognize that all it takes is for\nyou to expend energy and accomplish\nsomething that you put your your mind to\nto feel like you're less overwhelmed and\nmore in control and then everyone talks\nabout downward spirals and there's some\nkind of like upward spiral too or if you\nstart taking care of you're gonna\nbe able to take care of way more\nthan you realize"
