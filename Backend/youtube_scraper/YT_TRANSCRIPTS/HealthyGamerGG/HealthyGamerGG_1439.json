    "transcript": "so thanks for coming on Jane no worries\nit's been awhile since we last talked\nlet me do that for the week but ya crazy\ntime since then yeah kid can you fill me\nin on on so I think the last time we\ntalked you were with Dallas fuel right\nmhm yeah so I'm still as far as I can\nannounce I'm still with Dallas okay yeah\nso I am going to be moving to Dallas in\nNovember okay and then right now I'm in\nToronto for the Team Canada boot camp\nokay so over active media and Bell\nCanada sponsored us to come up to\nToronto to just a one week before the\nWorld Cup to get ready for the\ntournaments down in Anaheim California\nthere Team USA has had Nvidia as a\nsponsor the last two or three years and\nthey've had a pretty nice boot camp set\nup so actually being in person and\nhaving the full team there instead of\ntrying to practice remote which is you\nknow usually standard fare especially\nfor not just basically everyone except\nthe league teams practices remotely but\nit is really quite a big jump up once\nyou are able to get everybody in the\nsame location you know live together eat\ntogether practice together that whole\nthing so yeah the we're on day three the\nfirst scrim block starts in about an\nhour and a half mmm oh yeah so this is\nday three and then we're gonna have\nmedia day tomorrow one final kind of\nprep day to simulate the actual\ntournament itself and then we're down to\nAnaheim túcume to compete at the World\nCup that's awesome\nand how have you been oh I've been doing\nI've been really really busy there's a\nyou know normally people know me for my\ntwitch of my youtube stuff but pretty\nmuch the only social media that I've\nbeen active on recently has been Twitter\nnot because I like I'm feeling a lot\nbetter I had that I stepped back from\nsocial media because I was having a\npretty high period of stress I guess you\ncould call it social media earlier in\nthe year but the reason that I haven't\nfully returned to it yet is yes there's\nthese things with like World Cup where\nI'm up at the bootcamp but I'm also\nworking on some still secret projects\nthat I want to\nfinish off and hopefully I can announce\nthe some of those in November but yeah\nlooking to return to the actual twitch\nand YouTube stuff probably late November\nearly December it's one of those things\nwhere there's there's a lot of things\nthat can be done in the overwatch\necosystem I suppose the best way to put\nit you know if you're looking at like\nthe National Hockey League or something\nlike that they're still figuring things\nout after a hundred years now the\noverwatch league has sprung into\nexistence we just finished the second\nyear and so while it it's quite large\nand impressive with a lot of franchise\nteams there's still a lot of things that\nneed to be done down kind of like the\nthe foundation is the overwatch league\nyou know there's a lot of there's a lot\nof just checks and balances that aren't\nin place yet um you know there's no\nUnion for developers of games there's no\nPlayers Association and for players\nwhether it's whether you're talking\noverwatch Blizzard or any Activision\ngame things like that you know the major\ndifference between you have like the NBA\nwhere you know anybody like if you play\nlet's take baseball for example if you\nwanted to go play a game of baseball all\nyou really need is a bat a ball and you\nknow white spray paint in a grass field\nbut overwatch League in any sport really\nany and every eastward is a little bit\ndifferent where in order to have the\npermission to play the game you need to\nhave a license to the game access to the\nserver's which means you need Terms of\nService and user license agreements and\nthen those legal protections also extend\nto the point where companies have\ncontrol over running tournaments and\nevents\nyou can't like even if you and all of\ntheir friends own overwatch at the game\ntechnically you can't run a tournament\nwithout blizzards permission so there's\nsome differences in legal structures\nwhere although we're modeling the\noverwatch League and we being not me\npersonally but although the overwatch\nLeague is being modeled after these\nlarge franchise sports leagues there are\nsome very key structural differences\nwhich I don't feel you know they haven't\nbeen figured out yet we're still you\nknow we're going for broke we're\nfiguring out as we go along but yeah\nthere's there's more to be done\nthat could make the league a lot better\nyeah so I mean I think you know the last\ntime we talked I got a substantial\nappreciation for just how different\nthings are in terms of players as well\nlike I didn't realize sort of the\ncognitive impact of becoming a\nprofessional overwatch player at the age\nof 18 and kind of like what that does to\nyou and I remember kind of at that\nworkshop you know a lot of people were\njust talking a lot about sort of\nmanaging teams and how that's difficult\nis there is that so generally speaking I\nguess people on this stream like we tend\nto try to talk a lot about people's\npersonal experiences because I think\nthat's what people find helpful and you\nwere saying that things have been\nstressful can you tell us a little bit\nabout what's been stressful\n[Applause]\nthat's a very blood I mean everything\nhas its own level of stress you're doing\nyeah you know for you know it's I've got\nthe Team Canada thing going on we're\nobviously competing on the world stage\nliterally next week I work for Dallas as\na coach I'm doing other duties that I\nhaven't announced yet\nand then there's their stress behind\nthat obviously it's an organization\nthat's trying to make basically the\nfuture of sports in general and then on\ntop of that I have my my side project I\nwouldn't even really call it side\nprojects I start up organization that's\ntrying to support kind of the more\nsemi-professional the path to pro\nhelping people focusing on education\nthrough eSports so you know I wear a lot\nof different hats because I'm super\npassionate about the stuff and I want to\nmake it better and I want to make it\nwork so is there any specific component\nof that that you'd like me to delve into\nit yeah so let's start with this one\nyeah so like let's let's start with I\nguess a couple of things one is you know\nhow you balance different things so like\nthere's a particular stress from trying\nto do more than one thing yeah so so\nwhat when you say you're really bad at\nthat what does that mean well\nlike basically that for myself I was\noperating for quite a long time\nundiagnosed bipolar - and I didn't\nrealize that that's still something\nthat's relatively new to me and I'm\nstill trying to figure out how to cope\nwith it but whenever I would be on the\nelevated side of bipolar - you know it\nwouldn't be like a full-blown mania and\nyou know no delusions of grandeur\ndisassociation nothing like that it was\njust elevated mood elevated productivity\nmotivation passion like just super\nenergetic all the time and that's one of\nthe reasons that if I just like saw a\nproblem or saw something that I could do\nI just like jump right into it with with\nno regard to my health at all\nyou know there's a lot of people I think\ndo that that get really really\npassionate or really really competitive\nand you know you do hear about these\nguys grinding 8 to 12 hours and honestly\nthat's kind of the conservativeness\nthere's definitely people who push kind\nof like 16 20 hour sessions especially\nwhen they're grinding really really hard\nyou know just like the guys here at the\nTeam Canada I was like you know working\nin person and we're making sure that\nthey're fed and they have asleep and\nwe're all kind of do go to bed at same\ntime but there are some people who play\nuntil like 4:00 in the morning or\nsomething with that and then they're the\nfirst ones up and the first thing to do\nafter they do their morning routine is\njust hop right back on and keep going so\nwe've got these really intense days\nwhere we're doing you know three blocks\nof overwatch and review and prep and\ndiscussions and then they're putting in\ntwo different sets of our play sessions\nbefore and after not the boot camps\ncompletely voluntarily so Jane I've I've\ngot a question for you if I wanted to\nfind\nI if I had if I wanted to find so\nthere's an average rate of bipolar - in\nthe US population and if I wanted to\nfind a group of people that had a rate\nof bipolar - three three times the rate\nof the average do you know where I could\nlook like where am I gonna find people\nwho who are three times more likely to\nhave bipolar - no actually Harvard\nCollege really yes\nthat's it think about that for a second\nyeah it's a like I'm obviously not a\nprofessor of psychology but you know\nit's it comes to myself I was went to\nthe military college and sometimes I see\nit where people kind of compartmentalize\nespecially in mission oriented tasks\nlike people who you know in the military\nit's all about the mission it's like you\naccumulate stress while you're doing\nyour job or doing what was assigned and\nyou do that and then afterwards you kind\nof like decompress and you can just like\ntry and get yourself back to normal so\nyou can take the same mission and I do\nsee that same kind of drive sometimes at\nleast within the realm of eSports as\nwell and that people especially when\nthey get into the mindset that like they\nyou know they need to win it's not that\nthey want to win it's not like they want\nto be the best they want to win and\nthat's a never-ending mission to them\nand they really do you know push\nthemselves well past what anyone would\nconsider healthy at least in terms of\nphysical limitations how do you think\nthat affects their their performance\nthis is one of the things that I'm\nreally interested in is I think that it\nnegatively affects their performance\nquite a bit you know you had super in\nSinatra going on The Tonight Show with\nJimmy Fallon and Jimmy Fallon did this\nreally brief kind of super\ncommercialized formatted interview with\nthem at the end he asked them if they\nhad any advice for like people who\nwanted to also become pro gamers and\nthen super as a piece of advice was you\nknow you need to keep your life in\nbalance like you know he had a pretty\ngood answer but then Sinatra kind of\nadded to that he's like yeah but in\naddition to keeping your life in balance\nif you really want to be the best need\nto grind eight to twelve hours a day on\ntop of that and it was like that math\njust doesn't work out so you're these\nkids you know like they're you can get\ninto the overwatch League on their 18th\nbirthday and the superstars usually do\nbut that means that these guys have been\ngrinding this game since they were 15\nand they've been spending you know eight\nto twelve hours you know you most days\nof the week grinding to be this good\nthat's before they start getting on\nteams and it's really all they know and\nnobody has really taught them life\nskills or soft skills and especially\nwhen you're looking at like a field like\naviation you know my background is in\nthe Air Force as a pilot\nthe stat I think the most common staff\nthrown away is that you would do four\nhours of prep work for one hour of\nperformance or one hour of flight time\nand there is this component where you\nknow the eight to 12 hours it's its\npractice yes but there's also a\ndifferences where it's like practice\ndoesn't make perfect perfect practice\nmakes perfect and I think that the\nefficiency and just the way that people\nare going about trying to improve at the\ngame is really incredibly inefficient\nand I feel you know even things like\ndrills review focused practice on\nspecific areas different ways of\nthinking like paradigm shifts rather\nthan what's the best way to explain this\nyou know I was I've worked with an\nindividual who\nI didn't finish you know it's kind of I\nwould love to see a statistic it's\nprobably the one statistic the league\ndoesn't really want public but it's the\namount of people who either dropped out\nof high school or who finished high\nschool online it's kind of like you know\ngiven either course loads that you can\npursue your passion whatever it is\nthat's fine but you know I've had I've\nworked with pro players who don't know\nhow to take notes things like that you\nknow looking at the game footage and\nasking them to take notes of things that\nthey want to look after things that they\nnoticed or something and like they don't\nthey can't they don't know how so Jane\nwhat what I'm hearing you say is that\nlike people don't know how to learn yes\nwell nobody's taught them you know yeah\nit's a skill problem-solving is a skill\nthe scientific method wasn't developed\nuntil the Enlightenment period before\nthat you know nobody really knew that\nit's the same sort of thing scientific\nthinking learning how to learn learning\nhow to fail gracefully learning how to\nimprove all those things are not skills\nthat are taught and right now there is a\nsignificant number of people I think who\nput in so many hours into the game\nwithout thinking that they become purely\ninstinctual creatures or machines in the\nfact that if they can do some pretty\nincredible things and they'll you know\nflank at the right time or do some\naction that's a you know something that\nI was like I don't see the connection\nthat they saw in order to actually pull\nthat play off but they don't either\nthey just know it was the right thing to\ndo at that time they can't articulate it\nthey can't explain it something about\nthe context of that play made sense in\ntheir brain but it wasn't a focused\neffort in order to figure out a play and\npractice it through repetition it was\njust kind of like over the multiple\nthousands of hours I have in this game I\nknow that this is the right thing to do\nat this point in time so it's it's very\nweird kind of working with you know I\nwork in the world where or I worked\nprevious in the world of standard\noperating procedures and workflows and\nthings like that where you know flight\nsafety if a plane goes down we review\nall of our procedures and you never\nassume that the pilot is at fault\nthere's things like your planes\nthemselves or to find no sign to not\nonly be triple redundant but also to fly\ndespite the best intentions of the\npilots that's the joke so something\nfails and something goes wrong we\nusually blame\nthe training we blame the workflows we\nblame procedures we blame hardware the\nlast thing we blame as the pilot it's\nhow is that different from esports well\nit's it's almost the exact opposite in\nthe fact that not only do we not blame\nthe training or anything like that but\nthere is no really defined way or an\naccepted way of training educating and\ncoaching teams you know at the at the\nleague level sure some people okay what\nis that what does that blame look like\nso like let's say that you guys like\nlet's say that there's a team that you\nknow you guys had a disappointing\nperformance or you guys are screaming\nand things aren't going well or you know\nduring like a particular run or\ntournament things don't go well how does\nthat how does that look terms of you\nknow when you say like you blame\neverything in in the Air Force you guys\nblame everything except for the pilot\nand in eSports and this has been my\nexperience as well that a lot of blame\nfalls on individuals there are\npersonality conflicts players will blame\nonce again they won't blame the system\nin which they approach things they'll\nblame each other organizations will\nblame players like people will dogpile\nsome players like this is stuff that\nI've seen like how does that play out\nI mean you said it yourself all those\nthings have happened I don't want to\ntalk too much about the league level\nthere's any time I talk about the league\nlevel people automatically assume that\nthe things that I'm saying are thinly\nveiled references to the fuel so like I\ndon't mean to avoid topics I've got I've\ngot a lot of friends in both at the\nplayer level and staff level for other\nteams you know it's we talk sit we know\nwhat's going on on other teams in terms\nof like the you know it's not like\nleaking confidential information or vods\nor anything like that but you know\npeople know and people are having a\nrough time or when there's conflict\nbetween individuals and it's pretty\ncommon yeah so let me ask you this then\nthen and and thanks for letting me know\nyou know what's okay or not okay to talk\nabout because I understand that you know\nat the end of the day you're working for\na team and you're trying to be\ncompetitive and you're trying to train\nthem to win then you don't want to you\nknow give up that competitive advantage\nand or talk trash let me ask you this so\nwhen you're dealing like is it can we\nask you a little bit about how you deal\nwith that like as a person like if you\nnotice that people are not like so you\nhave this Air Force training and other\npeople are instinctively moving towards\nlike blaming each other how do you how\ndo you try to move people from their way\nof thinking into this other way of\nthinking is that we're fronting do you\nwant it do you want this theoretical\nlike how I would do it because\ntechnically the league level I'm an\nassistant so there's you know I don't\nget to fix things myself is that my way\nof thinking my military background the\nway that I would approach these problems\nis subservient to Aero and the fact that\nI'm there to assist Aero so sure what he\nsays in his approach to the team goes\nbut then there's times where like to get\ninto the league this is also kind of a\nan interesting is that a lot of people\nwow how much of a tangent do I want to\ngo on here go on the tangent baby go for\nit okay so not far far away there is\neverybody has a different approach to it\nsome players have different approaches\nof games some coaches have driven to the\nplays\nand think I cut out there didn't I yeah\njust for a second you're back okay but\ntier two looking at it sometimes feels\nalmost like a lottery in the fact that\nyou know people try and assemble the\nbest ways that they can but there's a\nlot of teams at the at the tier 2 level\nthat just kind of end up player coached\nand then it almost feels like the\ncoaches themselves who are attached to\nthe teams are playing lottery and the\nfact that when you have eight teams\ncompeting one of them has to win and if\nyou're the coach of that you know team\nthat happened to win even if it was a\nplayer-coach team you get to take credit\nfor that victory and then the next tier\nup kind of looks at you so there's it\nkind of like there's a lot of almost\ngoing through the motions and that's\nlargely because there is no one accepted\nway of coaching a team and any kind of\nteam that does feel like they've figured\nout how to run a team and how to\nactually work on player development\nthey're obviously not going to share\nthat information so player development\nis something that is talked a lot about\nbut in the league and of the\nsemi-professional player it RN at the\nsemi-professional level it feels like\npeople are almost playing the lottery or\ntrading stocks where they're kind of if\nyou're not good enough they'd rather\njust trade a player for a better player\nand then instead of trying to work on\nthat player develop them or build them\nup into order to be you know a dynasty\nof a team there's very little focus on\nplayer development and it's more of like\nif you're not working and they're good\ndevelops interpersonal issues just get\nthem the hell off my team so that we can\nstart again script start again fresh\nabsolutely I this yes this this\nknowledge just isn't here it's not\nendemic there's no institutional\nknowledge you know what that sounds\nactually a lot like so this sounds a lot\nlike Investment Banking to be completely\nhonest\nso investment banking it's pretty much\nwhat it is investment banking for you\nguys don't know as a field that has a\nreal problem with retention so like\npeople go into Investment Banking they\nwork crazy hours and I think it's\nbizarre how similar investment banking\nis to eSports and is even more similar\nto eSports than actually real sports so\nI work with a few NFL players and the\nNFL is like\ncompletely different from esports the\nfirst thing is that in the NFL you have\nphysical limitations on how much you can\npractice right so like people train for\nlike 4 to 6 7 hours a day the people who\nwork really hard will watch a lot of\ngame tape and things like that but it's\nstill like basically like an 8 or 10 or\nmaybe 12 hour day but for some people\nit's like a four hour day and people\ntrain really hard and they're very\nthoughtful and especially like good\nquarterbacks will spend a lot of time\nlike reviewing game tape and things like\nthat but what this release and the other\nthing about the NFL is like you don't\nhave like rampant player trading right\nso you'll have like people will trade\nand things like that but generally\nspeaking like you look at you know and\nthe NFL is about building dynasties just\nlike like Jane said Jane's like you know\nin eSports people don't focus on\nbuilding dynasties the NBA is like\npeople like it's about building like a\ncohesive team that you can run with like\nthink about Brady I mean I'm from Boston\nso Tom Brady and the Patriots is about\nbuilding like a dynasty like a team of\npeople that will carry you to win title\nafter title after title after title\nand in investment banking it's actually\nthe complete opposite so what happens is\nyou have a bunch of people who and I\nthink this happens in eSports as well\nwhere you basically have an astronomical\nsuccess curve where like you'll have\npeople who like finish college right and\nthey've like they'll be like they have\nessentially no net worth and they'll\nmove to New York City and they'll start\nmaking like 200 to 250 K a year and\nwithin 5 or 7 years they'll be making\n700 K 800 K and then hopefully within a\ndecade or a little over a decade they're\ngonna be making like seven figures so\njust the the the\nthe difference between like 22 and 23 is\njust astronomic and I see that in\neSports as well whereas like you've got\nthis eighteen-year-old kid who's like\nbailing out a call like school right\nhe's like struggling to graduate because\nhe plays a game all day like whether it\nbe lul or overwatch or whatever and then\nhe lands a contract for like one 25k a\nyear or two 50k a year and this is a kid\nwho like doesn't have expenses like he\njust sits at home and plays video games\nand so that has its own stress and then\nwhat happens is you start to get this\nsort of situation where like an\ninvestment banking you have a big\nproblem with retention so people feel\nlike they're undervalued or they feel\nlike they're not being treated or\nutilized correctly and so they move and\nso banks have a big problem with sort of\nkeeping the good people and losing the\nbad people so they want to keep all the\npeople they perceive as good but the\npeople they perceive as good or are\ngonna want to be shopping around a\nlittle bit because they feel like they\ncan get a better offer elsewhere and the\nflip side of it is they'll fire the\npeople who they think are bad but then\nthose people will travel to another\norganization and either do bad there or\nthey'll find a right team they'll find a\ndifferent system they'll find a\ndifferent approach they'll have like a\nmanager who's a little bit more\ncompassionate and works on them as a\nperson and then they'll rise to the top\nand they'll do really well so there's\nthe kind of this bizarre situation where\npeople are like looking at a system plus\na person and they're making a judgement\nabout the person instead of like\nthinking at all about the system because\nthat is generally speaking in investment\nbanking like people are you know there's\na bell curve but like most people are\npretty good\nand I've seen so much variance even\nwithin an individual person like if you\nstick one person their work product on a\nparticular team is gonna be way better\nthan the work product on another team\nand that's because of the way that the\nteam functions like the way that the\nreporting structure functions the way\nthat so I'll give you guys just one\nreally simple example so when you have a\njunior team member\nsometimes senior people will schedule\nimportant meetings without them and one\nof the simplest things you can do in\nInvestment Banking to get the most out\nof your junior people is just not leave\nthem out like it's such a simple thing\nbut it like happens so rarely where I\nwas talking and and just include the\njunior people on your team and then they\nfeel like they're a part of the team\ninstead of feeling like they're like a\nmonkey who's just they're like building\nfinancial models in the basement for you\nand then they're gonna give you that\nextra mile and your team will do way\nbetter but a lot of people in banking\njust don't think about that they're just\nlike oh I wasn't invited to meetings\nwhen I was junior person so I'm gonna\nignore my junior person and like and\nthen they start complaining when this\nperson doesn't seem to be doing a good\njob because you haven't inspired them to\nwork and that sounds a lot like what\nyou're describing where people are in\nlike go ahead no if you can yes yes yeah\nso I mean I think one thing to just\nremember which which I really come to\nappreciate is that if you want to get\nthe most out of a team member or\nemployee just remember that - like\npeople value - things people want to be\nappreciated and people want to be\nutilized\nI think that like one of the biggest\nproblems is that like when people don't\nfeel like they want to be pushed they\nwant to be challenged they want to feel\nlike they're doing like the best work\nthat they can do and they want to be\nlike they want to feel appreciated for\ndoing that and anytime I see like a\nleader do those two things for their\nemployees they do really really well and\nwhen one of those two things is missing\nie not not keeping junior people not\nloving them letting them live up to\ntheir potential and then not expressing\ngratitude leads to problems\nyeah one of the one of the things it\nsounds like in your examples and one of\nthe things that I've kind of identified\nas one of the main problems that causes\ninterpersonal issues to arrive\nespecially on the more competitive teams\nis just a lack of empathy for teammates\nthat seems to be other case you know\nit's when you grind ranks so much\nespecially at the higher levels you kind\nof become psychologically ingrained when\nyou're a professional player to you know\nbe that you are better than every one of\nyour teammates and every one of your\nopponents and resources need to be\nfunneled into you in order to be\nsuccessful you know this happens when\nyou have grandmasters tall five hundreds\nand pro players bidding getting put into\ngames with like masters players or\nsomething there's you know when you\napproach that last edge of the bell\ncurve every little tiny improvement is a\nmassive you know exponential increase in\nboth skill and knowledge and I feel like\na lot of pro players and semi-pro\nplayers to really really struggle to get\nout of that mindset because they have\nput so many hours into the ranked ladder\nbefore they actually transition into the\ncompetitive mindset on a team and when\nyou do that out of all of the issues out\nof everything that's gone around when\nyou see kind of teams going up and down\nswinging dramatically it's usually it\ncomes down to kind of trust\ncommunication teamwork and just\nconfidence in the ability to win I\nthought it was so funny that the Houston\noutlaws which had like a really really\nrough year here pretty much as soon as\nthe it was announced that they were\nbeing sold like the organization was\nbeing sold to immortals they look like\nwon some games and it was to me you know\nnothing else changed on the team but\nit's like hey we're being sold maybe to\nsomebody who actually has money like\nthat you know maybe it gave the players\nhope or confidence and when they were\nfeeling stuck otherwise that but just\nthat kind like mental shift might have\nbeen enough to like get them to win some\ngame so now that's complete speculation\nI don't know anything on the inside but\nyou know that lack of empathy for trying\nto understand something from another\nperson's perspective especially treating\nteammates as equals isn't something that\nis very common it's actually quite quite\nrare I think within the overwatch League\nitself that infuriates me like because\nbecause that was yeah I mean I like not\nto\nI'm not blaming anyone but I think like\nthe thing that infuriates me is that\nthat the theme of I think our or I guess\nthe view that Jane you and I share is\nthat things can be taught and and so I\nthink a big part of of what I do is I\ntry to teach people how to be empathic\nlike I try to teach people and I think\nthis is where you know the Yogi's\nrealize that like just about everything\nabout the mind any Faculty of the mind\nor anything that a human being can do\ncan be understood and improved so that\nour capacity for empathy our capacity\nfor creativity our capacity for\nconcentration you're talking about we're\nnot talking absolutely we're also not\ntaught how to concentrate that's just\nsomething we just kind of take for\ngranted like oh like I'm having trouble\nconcentrating on studying for this test\nI guess I'll try again later like no one\never looks at like why am I having\ntrouble concentrating how do you\nactually concentrate how do you train\nyour mind to focus how do you elicit a\nflow state how do you learn how to be\nempathic how do you learn to dissolve\nyour ego so I'm developing that's to\nteach people especially because you can\nsolve problems that are binary like\nshould we do this yes or no but like the\nclassic problem that always disrupts a\nteam and you know if you as a team that\ncan figure out whether or not it was the\ncomposition that is the problem or the\nexecution of that composition so if you\nkind of if you're coach presents a new\ncomposition and you run that composition\nand you lose the argument always arises\nwhether or not the composition was wrong\nor whether the execution was wrong and\none of the things that it just seems to\njust not be in people's heads it's all\nit's what does it call it's not a tooth\nnot to fact your problem but it's it\ndoesn't have to be one or the other both\nof them can exist but people will always\ntry and you're they're gonna split in\nit's gonna be tribal to you know we just\nneed to play the comp better or you know\nwe need to change the comp we executed\nit finally first of all you never\nexecuted anything perfectly and even if\nthe composition was good it's gonna\nchange and shift in a week anyway\nbecause that's what them that is like\nwhile people are developing and\nI still get a rating on each other's\nweaknesses yeah Jane you know what the\nfascinating thing is there there is a\nvery clear neuroscience reason why that\nhappens and there are also very clear\nneuroscience ways so there's certain\ncircuits in your brain that activate\nthat caused you to be black and white\nso like when our limbic system in our\nstress system activates our brain is\ndesigned to think in terms of black and\nwhite so normally like when we calmly\napproach a problem like we're talking\nabout this and we're sort of\nappreciating all these shades of grey\nand I think your main point is that it's\nnot like strategy or execution they're\nelements of both right and and but what\nhappens is people say like oh like we\nhad the by composition I assume you mean\nmore general sense strategy right like\nwhat your comp is going into the game\nyes yeah and then in an execution you\ncan maybe think about as tactics or just\nhow people played and so the fascinating\nthing is when people get stressed out\ntheir mind shuts off the ability to\nappreciate shades of gray and that's\nactually a survival mechanism so when\nwe're when we're faced with stress our\nbody like thinks were under attack\nand when it thinks were under attack we\ndon't want to appreciate shades of gray\nwe want to make snap judgments and like\ngo like all in on one thing or another\nthing like when we're faced with a tiger\nin the jungle we want to go into do we\nrun or do we fight\neverything in between is completely\nirrelevant and for the human beings who\nsat and appreciated nuance and Shades of\nGrey when they faced a tiger you know\nwhat happened to them absolutely they\njust they just got gobbled and so what\nhappens is over millions of years of\nevolution our brain is designed to be\nlike tribal or black-and-white thinking\nand the cool thing is that there are\nmany ways that you can actually disable\nthat circuit of your brain so one thing\nyou can do is like actually reduce the\ncortisol level in your body because\ncortisol is gonna encourage black or\nwhite thinking and cortisol is a stress\nhormone this is also really fascinating\nso adrenaline is so when when people get\nheated and they start to argue and they\nstart like saying like oh it was\ncomposition oh it was execution so\nanytime you start arguing your\nadrenaline level is gonna go up your\ncortisol level is gonna go up and this\nis fascinating so adrenaline actually\ncauses your peripheral vision to\ncollapse so our normal field of vision\nis a hundred eighty degrees when we have\nadrenaline in our system our field of\nvision reduces down to thirty degrees\nlike our physically you can't see\nanything except for what's in front of\nyou and the fascinating thing is that\ncorrelates in my opinion there are fewer\nstudies about this to cycle\npsychologically as well and you're\nunable to see like your peripheral\nvision when you get pissed off and you\nzero in on one problem and you collapse\nto like a thirty degree field of vision\nand then all you can see is what's in\nfront of you oh the problem is this\nother guy and you can't see anything\nelse and the really fascinating thing is\nwhen I work with especially groups of\npeople like I also work with resident\nphysicians so this is a class of people\nthat is sort of like you know is the the\nnuts and bolts of like what's running\nthe hospital so myself and my co\nresidents like we're running like we're\nthe ones who are taking all the call\nshifts so one of us is working every\nnight or two of us are working every\nnight to cover in 960 bed hospital and\nso what like there's all kinds of stuff\nthat happens like in terms of the person\nthat you're on with like if you feel\nlike they're not pulling your weight\nyou're gonna feel swamped or if you feel\nswamped you reverse engineer the answer\nand you say oh that guy's not pulling\nhis weight because I\nfeel swamped right like there's there's\nlike kind of this dyad and if you feel\nstressed\nyou're gonna automatically like blame\nthe other person for your stress and\nthen you get into all kinds of other\nthings like if one person calls in sick\nand that stresses everyone else so\nthere's a fascinating thing that happens\nin residency that if one person calls in\nsick it makes everyone else more likely\nto call in sick because if I have to do\nextra work because someone else is sick\nwell [ __ ] that I'm gonna call in sick\ntoo and it gets to the point the worst\nthing that I've ever seen is that when\nwhen people start calling in sick people\nstart pretending to call in sick to\n[ __ ] go to concerts that happened\nonce in my class and I was livid when I\nfound out we didn't say anything about\nit but like someone's like well [ __ ] I\ngot called in so like other people can\nget called in too it can become super\nsuper toxic so fast so what do you do\nabout that Jane sure let's switch gears\nfor a second so I I appreciate that\nso let me ask you this and if you're if\nyou're comfortable talking about this so\nyou said that you were diagnosed with\nsomething like bipolar - yeah yeah so\nyou get like a hundred percent\nconfirmation that that's the case but\nit's the working theory and it seems to\nfit pretty well so far yeah so I think\nthat actually a lot of people like\nresonated with that actually on on\ntwitch at and I was kind of curious what\nwhat were you experiencing because I\nthink a big problem that a lot of people\nface is that you know people think that\nsomething that's happening to them is\nnormal and in a sense it is because\nthat's just how they've been their\nentire life like your entire life I\nwould guess that you've just had periods\nof time of like superhuman productivity\nthat other people have even been envious\nof and then your body has had to like\ntip like there's that balancing effect\nright so after a period of superhuman\nproductivity you kind of like your body\nhas to crash\nand that's just who you are it's the way\nthat you've always worked and so people\ndon't realize that like just because\nyou're working that way there's a way to\nunderstand that there's a way to\nactually capitalize on that there's a\nway to balance that there's a way to\noptimize it there's a way to take\nadvantage of it and there's a way to\nlike suffer less Oh certainly the like\nthe hypomania side that bipolar too is\ndespite being a mental illness as by\ndefinition or something like that it is\nvery beneficial in cases you know it\ndoes as you describe it at his\nsuperhuman productivity one of the\nthings is that when I was first trying\nto kind of understand the whole bipolar\nto nature and you know I'm trying to\ndeal with it just through\nself-regulation and healthy living\ninstead of I don't want to like medicate\nmyself I want to understand you to\nunderstand my brain and all that so\nbut the hypomania side when I was\nworking on it I was having when I\nstepped back from social media I was\nhaving some pretty crippling social\nanxiety which is really strange because\nyou know I've given thesis presentations\nin front of the Prime Minister of Canada\nand like never been nervous about that\nbefore so for me to get anxiety and like\nworry about things it was like this was\nnew it was that's [ __ ] literally an\nanxious person just pause and\nappreciating how cool that is\nthere was the military college it wasn't\nanything that's that's [ __ ] cool man\nwhat was your thesis I'm not to derail\nme but I can't help myself\nI studied aeronautical engineering at\nthe Royal Military College of Canada and\nthe fourth-year thesis in that program\nis to design an aircraft so what we did\nwas we took a look at one of the current\nplatforms that the Air Force used and\nwe've redesigned it for modern times in\na way that a company could take and\nactually produce it and I was the\naerodynamicist on that project that's\ncool anyway and now I'm playing eSports\nyeah so on when I was working with\nworking with my therapist to trying to\nfigure out what was going on with this\nanxiety one of the things is that I had\nI had well let's start back I'm like\nwhat Beiler bipolar ii looked like to me\nand why I didn't figure out that I was\nbipolar like why I couldn't tell and why\nI never like realize it because it you\nknow I say this to other people\nlike oh yeah that makes sense and like\nyou know people looking at me and me not\nlooking in the mirror it makes sense to\nthem but so I always thought that\nbipolar as it was described was\nsomething where it was like an\ninstantaneous shift of mood like with\nmid-conversation\nI always thought that that was why\npeople had trouble dealing with bipolar\nindividuals because in the middle of a\nconversation they've got really happy\nyou're really sad or something like that\nI didn't realize that bipolar happened\nover the course of numerous days or\nweeks or in some cases months and then\nyou can have these dramatic mood shifts\nmore gradually like that but you have\nthe stress of the overwatch league\nitself started to compress the frequency\nof my mood swings quite quite badly so\nif I compress the frequency let's just\nlet's just pause so what that means is\nthat you started to fluctuate more\nquickly due to stress yes okay okay and\nit became a big problem and then so\nafter that whole situation which I'm\njust gonna skip what did happen is that\nI was having massive amounts of anxiety\nand I couldn't figure out watching can I\nask you to pause for just one second\nyou're on an awesome rhythm but there's\nso much that you're talking about which\ni think is just so it's like a goldmine\nfor people i want to grab just i want to\ngrab like a notebook real quick and I\njust want to jot down a couple of things\nwhich I want to talk or ask about so and\nit's just too good to pass up so I have\nto interrupt you even though I feel like\nthat's criminal also I'm gonna just grab\nsomething to drink real quick I'll be\nright back\n[Music]\nyou\n[Music]\nall right because I think like this what\nyou're saying so this is you're\nabsolutely correct about you know people\nreally misunderstand how quickly and how\nslowly bipolar fluctuates and a lot of\npeople think that bipolar is like\nsomeone who has like mood swings but\nthat's not where bipolar is and that's a\nreally important point that I just don't\nwant to lose along with everything else\nyou're saying okay\nanyway please continue so I was I was\nwhen I came back from my break and I\nstarted to try and work with Dallas\nagain in stage four I was having anxiety\nattacks and panic attacks and they were\nreally kind of weird in the fact that I\nwould feel them coming like it's just\nsomething I could feel my body chemistry\nshift and I could be like oh here we go\nand I'd have to go over to my general\nmanager and be like hey I need to go to\nmy apartment I'm about to have a panic\nattack\nor Inc I don't know what the difference\nbetween anxiety attack or panic attack\nis I just know it's like [ __ ] that's\nwhat it did so he'd help me we go to my\napartment and I kind of wait for it all\nto blow over but working through the\ntherapist what I what I had realized is\nbasically that I had been kind of locked\ninto the depressive state for a while\nand I had kind of considered that to be\nmy normal and then when the I step back\nand I D stressed and I self-regulated\nagain started being healthier my body\nwas trying to go into the hypomanic\nstate move out a diversion but I hadn't\nbeen there for so long I was fighting\nagainst the mood correction into the\npositive territory but when you say\nfighting against what does that mean\nit's so just a bipolar - I still I'm\naware of my mood and in control of my\nmood so it's not like I ever lost\ncontrol or awareness over my actions or\nanything like that and the fact that you\nknow if I was like super happy and\nexcited and I wanted to just dance in\nthe middle of the room like I could just\nsit there and be like a normal person\nand pretend to be a professional you\nknow it's like so things of that variety\nis that you know despite my my body\nwanting to basically stand up and dance\nI could force myself to sit in that\nchair and do work but that's you are\nhaving you were having like these like\nimpulses and you would control the\nrelease its impulses it doesn't sound\nlike the right bird to me at all it's\nokay kind of like I would just I had\nenergy okay and I wanted to you know I\nwas energetic and wanted to do something\na little bit more stimulating than\nwhatever I was doing it okay basically\nand then fighting against that is what\nthe therapist suggested might have been\ncausing the anxiety so she suggested\nthat basically I stopped trying to\nlike that and just like you know be okay\nwith whatever state of energy my body\nwants to be at and so I did the next\ntime I felt an anxiety attack coming on\nI'm like finally your therapist is very\ngood yeah she is\nThank You Dallas but yeah so I just let\nit ride I let the anxiety attack right I\ndidn't try and fight it I wasn't worried\nabout it and then what had happened is\nthat after that that's the first time\nthat I entered a hypomanic state again\nand I worked for like 35 hours straight\nwhich was not healthy and my therapist\ndid not like that but I was like I was\nhaving a blast and I must have gotten\nlike two weeks worth of work done it's\nlike 35 hours and then I basically\ncollapsed physically I gave out mentally\nI was just wanted to keep working so\nthat was kind of like the first time\nthat was the kind of realizing what the\nanxiety was it was like my body wanted\nto be happy but I'd been unhappy for so\nlong that I was fighting against it\nthough and since then like I've been\nputting a lot of that energy into\nself-regulating working out eating\nhealthier like you know it is kind of\nnice when I post a photo on Instagram or\nlike people like wow are you looking\ngood it's like yeah I've got all this\nenergy and I kind of realized that you\ndo look good by the way thank you\nthe last time I saw you yes you look so\nmuch better thank you your face has\nsomething called orgeous in it oh just\nsomething weird is happening\ncan you still hear me yeah so you have\nsomething called Oh Jess I don't\nunderstand something weird just happened\nin my twitch chat but uh so gorgeous is\nlike glow is how it gets translated so\nyou have like a glow in your face like\nand you look it wasn't there last time\nyeah it's it's been well the last time\nyou saw me was yeah probably right in\nthe middle of that so where was I oh\nbasically like when I am in a hypomanic\nstate and being really productive it\nfeels like I'm a candle burning from\nboth ends and that I can feel the\nphysical toll of being that productive\ntakes on the fact that I'm pretty aware\nthat if I let myself work at maximum\ncapacity that I'd shorten my life span\nthere's no real other way to put it so\nI've been in order to my way of coal\nregulating has kind of been putting that\nenergy into keeping myself alive by\nstaying healthy making sure I'm working\nout and eating and now introspection\nmeditation things like that but it's\nbeen an unmarked increase in quality of\nlife yeah so I'm gonna I want to ask you\na question but um I need to figure out\nhow do I turn off the sound for gifts\nsubs as someone just gifted a hundred\nsubs I don't know what that means okay\nbut that's what it looks it looks\nsignificant but I gotta figure out can\nsomebody help me you have you have a\nbrowser source ah yes\nI don't know what that means or what are\nyou using to streams I'm using a stream\nlabs OBS so you'll find it in one of the\nI don't know stream labs OBS\nspecifically but look at one of the\nsources and you should be ok mute a\nsource individually\n[Music]\nI don't know okay who is it I'm gonna\nopen your Twitter stream\nit's this guy named Lodi PM so at first\nI thought it was a hack because like\nwhen someone starts spamming all that\n[ __ ] in my twitch it means someone is\nhacking stream waves calm\nI'm so sorry guys like Jane this is just\npure gold man you're just your journey\nis so good like I I think it's some\nis unable to find that person but like\nthe problem is my thing is like dinging\nevery few seconds oh yeah it's not the\nperson it's it'll have sent a stream\nLabs and stream Labs is sending you\nthose alerts so you can it's not wait\nlike you can't do anything which either\nyou have to do it through the stream\nlabs dashboard on the browser or in the\nstream labs OBS streaming program okay\nlet me see the browser source for it\nokay are you conditioning a lot in the\nstream line also just please I've\nactually did donate the hundred subs\nthank you so much yeah I mean I thank\nyou I wanna support it's huge\nand I think I think Jane thank you\nbecause I think like what so I like I\nthink what you're sharing right now is\nso important\nokay hold on did this stop we done okay\nI think we're so thank you very much for\neveryone who subscribed and followed I\ndon't get a chance to thank you guys\nenough and I think Jane like honestly\nlike this story is so classic and is\nbrilliant um so thank you so much for\nsharing it I didn't mean to derail you\nby talking about orgeous but I'm getting\nreally excited because I think you're\nyou're doing this in such an awesome way\nlike the way that first of all the way\nthat you discovered this the way that\nyou recognized that this is actually who\nyou've been your entire life and there's\nso many elements to this like I don't\nwant to cut you off but you were saying\nthat you know people are saying that\nyou're looking better now so so tell us\na little bit about how you're doing now\noh yeah it's just like so I've been like\nyou know ever since I kind of figured\nout this and I've actually been able to\nself-regulate a little bit I haven't\nactually been on the downside of bipolar\nsince August 18th now so I'm over two\nmonths maintaining kind of like positive\nmood state which is I like it\nare you hypomanic or you just kind of\nmiss no hypomanic yeah I put my had for\ntwo months now yeah how much are you\nsleeping every night about five hours\nusually so it does yeah that's always\nthe first question so at first it was\ndown to three hours just because the\nenergy persisted even through dreams\nwhich is really weird and wonky but\nsince then since I've been able to\nactually kind of through meditation be\nable to self-regulate a little bit more\nyou know five hours five six hours is\nprobably average and then you know if I\nreally push myself then yeah if I like\nif I exhaust myself then we can sleep\nfor a normal eight hours or so\nokay so I think\na couple of things that I want to ask\nyou so the first is so I'm noticing that\nyou're kind of attached to your bipolar\n- does that make sense yes because it's\nbeen kind of the starting point for me\nto figure out things that have actually\nmade marked improvements you know it's a\nI've always been very cautious against\nself diagnosis you know invests at the\nsame time it's you know that the DSM and\ndiagnostic manuals so I was very kind of\nhonest with my therapist be like you\nknow like what is this what are you\nthinking like you know don't give me the\nColes notes potions like what do you\nactually they just speak honestly sort\nof thing but yeah the reason that I kind\nof refer to bipolar 2 and hypomania as\nmuch as I do is just because in looking\nat how its treated and reading the\nstories about how other people have\nmanaged it I've found clues that have\nhelped me live a better life so it's not\nlike I I don't like to identify I don't\nthink I've ever actually mentioned\nhypomania on my own social medias before\nI've mentioned bipolar 2 once in a\nyoutube video and I specifically\nmentioned then that I didn't want to be\nknown as the guy with bipolar so like I\ndon't make any public references to it\nthis is just because your memoir is why\nI mention it so much yeah so I'm glad\nyou do because I think the first thing\nto recognize it's funny so like um you\nknow a guy named Evan Nash by chance I\ndon't know okay so III was he's he's\nalso like uh he was CEO of counter logic\ngaming a couple of years ago and so it's\nstill like sort of in the esports kind\nof film but so I was talking to Devin on\nFriday and the really fascinating thing\nis that like so we were talking about\nhis sense of inadequacy and he really is\nattached to a sense of inadequacy\nbecause he feels like it's responsible\nfor his success and that his inadequacy\nfuels him forward because he's never\nlike satisfied with himself in that that\ncauses him to move forward and I think\nthat the really fascinating thing that\nI've noticed about working with people\nwho have I don't really like to call it\nmental illness I think it's just a part\nof them right so like what I work with\npeople with anxiety they - like they\ndon't want to lose\ntheir anxiety and the people who are the\nmost attached to their quote-unquote\nmental illness are actually people with\nbipolar too because they don't want to\ngive us this there's quite a few people\nout there who credit hypomania to their\nsuccess in their field or the career\nit's not so at least from my own\nresearch that's not a unique experience\nit's this legitimate Lee it does make me\nmore productive not not only is it\nlegitimately that not only is it an\nuncommon experience I would argue it is\nlike a very common experience and and\nonce again when we're talking about\nundergrads at Harvard College like they\nare there because of their bipolar -\nthey are there because they can go two\nmonths sleeping four hours a night and\nstudy their asses off and enjoy it\nand enjoy because they feel great and\nthen when the other shoe Falls you know\nthey feel offer awful their productivity\ndrops but they're still able to sustain\nit just like you have like I'm hearing\nthat you needed to take a break from\ntime to time and it's also sounds like\nyou've been sort of struggling with this\ncycle for many years and yet you've\nbecome overwhelmingly professionally\nsuccessful like you were in the Air\nForce you're you know you've been in\neSports like you can't you can't drop\noff the face of the earth for like two\nmonths in eSports and have a job when\nyou come back you just can't\nso you manage the lows or maybe I'm\nmaking assumptions but I don't I mean\nthat hasn't been my experience cuz if\njust I mean the league is two years old\nso to like drop off the face of things\nfor like five percent of the time that\nthe league has been existence I don't\nthink you can stop yeah I took do it\nbecause I'm I'm large enough that you\nknow I can come back it's like my spot\nisn't okay I know I'm no longer\ncompeting for my spot so I literally can\ndisappear off social media for two\nmonths and then come back but for you\nknow for most people who are still on\nthe grind I don't listen to myself on\nthe grind anymore and the first thing\nthings to do but I'm not competing\nagainst others at this point yeah so\nthat's that's actually a wonderful\nstress-free sort of way at looking at\nthings that's something that I'd like to\ndive into but I just have too many\nthings written down in my notebook so\nthe first thing that I kind of want to\nlet people understand is that a lot of\nthe negative things we experience in our\nmind and a lot of the things that\nactually cause us suffering and\ndifficulty actually like help us out in\na very important way so you know anxiety\nin a weird way is like a protective\nmechanism right because it keeps you\nfrom getting hurt so like if you're\ngiving a presentation let's say to the\nPrime Minister of Canada and you have\nsocial anxiety you don't want to look\nlike an idiot in front of the Prime\nMinister of Canada so you don't speak\nbut in a weird way like that's actually\nhelping you out like it's protecting you\nfrom looking like an idiot in front of\nthe Prime Minister Minister of Canada\nfor people who have bipolar to their\nperiods of hypomania allow them to work\nfor 35 35 hours at a stretch really\nsounds a little bit more like mania but\nthe standard the standard you know\nbipolar to sort of pattern is like\nsleeping five hours a night and being\nlike pretty damn productive while you're\nawake\nright so normally like most human beings\nand some people can get get by with like\n4 to 6 hours of sleep but but most human\nbeings need a solid 8 hours and if they\nget less than that their productivity\nreally drops so the first thing I want\npeople to understand is that like in the\nsame way that that Jane and I were\ntalking about black and white thinking\nlike is bizarre as the sounds I'm not\nsaying that mental illness is a good\nthing in any way but at the same time\nunderstand that a lot of your negative\nmental patterns are doing something for\nyou even if we look at something like\nvideo game addiction video game\naddiction is doing something for you\nthat's why you do it so much right\npeople who are addicted to video games\nand escape from the world through\nplaying video games like that's what\nit's doing it's protecting you from the\nconsequences of the real world and so\nthe first thing in in Devon's inadequacy\nis fueling him towards material success\nthe first thing to understand is that\nyou know we classify mental illness is\nall bad and I I'm not saying that people\nshould go around trying to be bipolar\nI'm not saying that I think you can be\nfree from anxiety like that so what I\nwork towards and at the same time\nunderstand that it's like not all a\nnegative thing and that it's usually\ndoing something for in some cases like\nschizophrenia or you know really bad\ndepression I find it hard to understand\nexactly what it's doing for you um but\nyou know for a lot of people like if you\nhave some kind of mental pattern like we\nhad someone else on a couple weeks ago\nwho is talking about how they always end\nup dating someone who's emotionally like\noh sorry like so who's someone like\ntheir their parents and they're sort of\nlike emotionally unavailable and that\ncan be the kind of thing that feels\npainful and causes suffering and is\nactually doing something for so what I\nreally like about your story Jane is\nthat you're acknowledging that like even\nthough this has been a struggle for you\nand it's been hard and not that it's\ngood but that you recognize that there\nare parts of this that you really don't\nwant to give up right yes so I'm getting\nalso a lot of questions about you know\nwhat's true bipolar versus mood swings\nand I think you opened up with this\nwhich was awesome so people toss around\nthe word bipolar and you were saying\nthat you know you didn't realize that\nbipolar is something that happens\nmood shift happens over the course of\ndays or even weeks you were kind of\nenvisioning someone who's like really\nhappy one minute and is like throwing\n[ __ ] the next minute yeah and I was\nenvisioning also somebody who is hard to\ncommunicate with or was like socially\nawkward and I do not consider myself\nthat kind of person so that was another\nreason at least in my head I was like\nall of you have mood swings that must\nmake you like you know not very much fun\nat parties or you know yes perhaps in\nthe work environment or things like that\nbut no that's a great point right so we\nalso have conceptions of what mental\nhealth looks like and since we don't\nfeel like the stuff on TV looks we think\nthat that's not really what's going on\nso like even when you look at like\nschizophrenia for example on on TV like\nit's perceived in a very particular way\nor like you know even stuff like\naddiction is like perceived in like a\nvery like kind of almost like glamorous\nway like it's like really high highs and\nreally low lows and like this really\nlike noble struggle against addiction\nwhereas for the most part addiction is\nlike a slaw it's like just really\n[ __ ] boring okay if you made a TV\nshow about someone with addiction it\nwould be like them waking up maybe going\nto a job maybe not going to a job coming\nhome and then feeding their addiction\nand it's like just like West Wing it's\nyeah so it's not Leo McGarry for us from\nWest Wing right like oh yeah no no\nbecause Leo McGarry is like he's like\nit's a noble it's a noble like they\ndon't actually show him so if you want\nto really see that's a great example so\nif you want to see the real like what\naddiction really looks like it would be\nsix seasons of West Wing where Leo\nMcGarry is sitting in a room and\ndrinking alcohol every episode that's\nwhat real addiction looks like Leo\nMcGarry is a noble guy who's productive\nand has this kind of romanticized\nstruggle with addiction where they show\nthis really powerful scene where he's\nlike drinking and relapses and stuff\nlike that and his friends kind of come\nin and support him real addiction is\njust [ __ ] boring to watch\njust [ __ ] bore\nI think about people who are addicted to\nvideo games like that's not glamorous\nyou just wake up every day and you start\nlike you're queueing for overwatch and\nyou just play overwatch all day and then\nlike you switch to dota and you switch\nto loll then you go to sleep and then\nyou wake up and you do it the next day\nit's not romanticized at all\nin that same way so it kind of I think\nI've sorry for going off on a tangent\nbut what I wanted to share with people\nis like so so one of the biggest things\nthat I think Jane learned which is very\nimportant to understand is that bipolar\ndoesn't mean mood swings so a lot of\npeople like I hear people that come into\nmy office and they'll say like oh my my\nson is bipolar so it'll be like a parent\nand bipolar that means that he'll be\nlike playing video games one minute and\nthe next minute he's like throwing [ __ ]\nbecause they like unplug his internet\nthat's not bipolar that's not so bipolar\ndoesn't mean mood swings so mood\nreactivity is a different thing so there\nare some people who have like very high\ndegrees of mood reactivity so their mood\ncan swing from like one one thing to\nanother thing over the course of 5\nminutes or an hour 2 hours\nbipolar in depression is persistent\nperiods of mood that lasts in the case\nof bipolar one week or more like pretty\nmuch most days all day everyday kind of\nthing or in the case of depression like\ntwo weeks at a stretch so if you're\nsuper depressed for a weekend and are\nfine on Monday morning like that's not\nmajor depressive disorder that's not\nclinical depression that's not really\nbipolar so true depression or bipolar\ninvolved periods of mood that lasts days\nat a time or even weeks or even months\nup to about a year in the case of\ndepression that's one thing so mood\nswings different the second thing that I\nwanted to point out is that it sounds\nlike you've had this pattern for your\nentire life and also that certain things\nuse the word stress from overwatch\ncompressed the swings that's okay\nsomething that you know I don't know if\nthere was any other sort of\nphysiological changes that cause the the\nfluctuations to accelerate but that's at\nleast as far as I can tell what caused\nit to accelerate there so yeah it's go\nahead I'm going to just say this\nonce and I'll say it a thousand more\ntimes if you think something is going on\nchances are you're right\nso one of the biggest lessons that I've\nlearned as a psychiatrist is I can train\nas much as I want to I can read as many\nbooks or studies as much as I want to\nand if a patient walks into my office\nand they say I think this is what's\ngoing on like 90% chance that's what's\ngoing on\nand so like sure there could be like\nweird neuroscience or physiologic things\nbut because what I realized is that most\npeople like actually like have a good\ninstinct for like what's going on with\nthemselves\nand so stress absolutely does cause\nthese things to worsen and in terms of\nworsen there are a couple of different\ndimensions in which stress can cause\nthings stores and one is that it can\nmake your lows lower it can make your\nhighs higher it can make them more\ncalcified and harder to move or it can\naccelerate the the cycling process and\nthe cycling process is essentially like\nan attempt to balance and if you think\nabout like you know if you let's say\nlike you're you're like sailing a boat\nand then you get hit by a huge wave\nwhich is like a stress and then your\nboat starts to rock and if you try to\nlike overcompensate you're gonna make\nthings worse and then you're\novercompensating again and it's almost\nlike you know when people say that if\nyou lose control of a car you should let\ngo in the direction of the skin because\nif you if you go against the skid you're\ngonna just like you're gonna fishtail\nand you're gonna like actually end up\nworse right so the really fascinating\nthing is when our when our body goes\nunder a period or a brain goes under a\nperiod of stress sometimes our body\ntries too hard to overcompensate we try\ntoo hard to control things and it just\nmakes things worse which is why I think\nthat your therapist is so [ __ ]\nbrilliant because what she said is that\nlike your anxiety or panic is actually\ncoming is a manifestation of\ninappropriately dealing with something\nelse that you have this excessive energy\nwhich needs to come out and you're not\nletting it come out and since it can't\ngo out one way it's gonna blow a gasket\nsomewhere over here so like I want you\nguys so I want you guys to envision so\nenvision Jane like a closed system that\nhas pressure building up and he's got\nthis impulse like he's got this pressure\nvalve on this one side which is to get\nup and dance and that's what he wants to\ndo\nand if you don't open that pressure\nvalve and the pressure and the system\nkeeps building up like what's gonna\nhappen Jane increased heart rate you\nknow you're gonna start fidgeting you're\ngonna start having frantic thoughts yeah\nand your system is gonna blow a gasket\nsomewhere else like if you don't let\nthat pressure out it's gonna manifest\nsomewhere else\nand I'll give you guys like another\ngreat example of this so I I had a one\nof my teachers once taught me something\nreally awesome about depression which is\nthat the source of depression is anger\nturns against the self\nand that that depression really like\nfinds its roots and like anger towards\nyourself and when you can't express that\nanger towards yourself when you can't\nmetabolize or process that anger about\nyourself it transforms into depression\nand in your case go ahead I just tell\nyou the cause of mine you know I keep\ntalking about being a pilot in the Air\nForce but in my final year of university\nI was hit by a car at night it was a\nhit-and-run I got injured and I ended up\npushing out in my last year and then\nbecause I was at the military college\nnot only did that lose my trade but also\nmy degree so that was kind of the cause\nof you know it was and I was angry at\nmyself for having failed Yeah right\nbecause it mine yeah which is which is\ncrazy because like you got hit by\nsomeone right and yet somehow you you\nget angry at yourself and that anger\nsort of like in an alchemical process\nlike gets transmuted into depression and\nso something about sort of this internal\nenergy that you had got like\nalchemically transmuted into anxiety\nso yeah like I said this is just pure\ngold for me so the next thing is is you\nwere saying like you're not sure what\nthe difference between anxiety and panic\nis so I'm gonna just talk for a second\nabout that\nso anxiety is generally like worrying\nabout stuff so when I think about\nanxiety like I think like I so my\nclassic question for whether someone has\nanxieties I just ask them are you a\nworrier so Jane are you a worrier no I\ndon't mean warrior I mean like wor ril\nare know yeah so if you worry about\nstuff then chances are you're gonna be\nprone to anxiety yeah oh oh warrior is\ndifferent warrior and would it be if I\nuse the accent it is easier to\nunderstand and so what we think about is\npanic is usually discrete episodes so\nlike people who have anxiety generally\nlike worry all the time like you were\ntalking about social anxiety right so\nlike those like if you're if you become\nsocially anxious like if you're in the\nright setting like your mind is just\ngonna be worrying somewhat constantly\ndoes that make sense\nwhereas panic is usually like a discrete\nepisode of you know can last an hour\nmaybe even to of like highly elevated\nheart rate like sweating stuff like that\nyou can get that in social anxiety as\nwell but panic is sort of like episodic\nin nature and anxiety is generally like\nis a more general like experience over a\nprolonged period of time\num\nyeah so that's what I that's that's\nthat's what I got yeah so from from that\ndefinition it would have been social\nanxiety just general tolerant and then\nit it would have been panic attacks yeah\nabsolutely so I think I think the word\nattack is actually really good because\nthat implies like an episode so when\npeople talk about it I think they're\nhaving panic attacks yeah so it's like a\ndiscrete period of you know really\nstrong like overwhelming emotions in\nthat moment so I'm gonna ask so Jane\nanything else you want to mention or any\nquestions that you have I mean it's a\nthe story spans months so you know it's\nwherever you want to go so I was\nactually thinking maybe we could do some\nQ&A and we'll see if people have\nquestions for you or me sure and the\nother thing that I want to do is is\nI want to teach some meditation today\nand I just let me I've got\nI got 13 minutes okay perfect so let's\ndo questions yeah so I'm gonna say well\nso let's see if people have questions\nfor Jane let's start there\nand then I'll do meditation afterward\nand thanks for coming on by the way my\npleasure you know it's something like\nthis that happens me I just know that\nI'm not unique in this regard and I I\nsee a world where we are giving these\nyoung kids you don't know much about the\nworld don't have soft skills aren't\nlearning psychology aren't you know\nbeing introspective or really kind of\ncaring about themselves that either\nthey're gonna go through these\nbreakdowns and similar struggles or\nthey're gonna leave the league and\nsomething like you know maybe they have\none really successful year and they\nsacrificed everything to get where they\nare and then you know I don't know what\nthis dive in with the NBA of all the\nplayers going bankrupt after they left\nbut I do think that you know I've been\nalmost using the term dream Harvester\nit's kind of like you know people are\nsacrificing a lot for their dreams and\neven when they get them it might not be\nwhat's good for them so I want to kind\nof make sure that mental health\nespecially in eSports is something\nthat's talked more about and that you\nknow so that when people do kind of run\ninto these sort of times in their lives\nthat they are either more well prepared\nfor it or at least have resources that\nthey can go to to try and self educate\num what is molding me mad plus balding\nput together\nsomeone is I think someone is trolling\nyou yes be modeling to be a good coat\nyes it helps hi\nit sounded like a troll kind of question\nbut I wasn't sure what it meant but it's\na good of an illegitimate question I'm\nthe knight sir it's a common slang it's\nbeing thrown around - just like mess\nwith the balding streamers I think\nyeah but I mean that's dick man that's\ndick it's the Internet\nyeah\num okay so so risker asks why do you\nthink that players burn out so quickly\nin eSports compared to other stuff\nbut it's like there's a long which\nthere's a long list of reasons that I\ncould answer here but each did every\nsingle one because you know everybody's\ndifferent everybody's gonna burn out for\na different reason\nI think think that\nI'm gonna go with a little bit of a\nweird one one that I think is actually\nreally impactful but nobody is talking\nabout and I think it's the lack of role\nmodels for the players in that the\nplayers themselves are role models but a\nlot of them don't have role models of\ntheir own you know some players have\nvery supportive parents and that's good\nbut probably the majority of parents are\nnot supportive or are not involved in\nthe eSports athletes you know career\nchoice especially when you're having\nKorean players come over to America or\nEurope you know not only are they\nseparated from their parents and also\nbut from their culture you have some\npeople who started playing video games\nbecause they had a rocky relationship\nwith their parents so you're having this\nsituation where these people are the\nbest in the world and they're being\nlooked up to by kind of the next\ngeneration they're expected to kind of\nbe perfect be a good example but\nnobody's taught them how to do those\nthings and that pressure can really get\nto people so I think I think it's going\nto be the lack of role models that the\ncurrent professional players have that\nis a fantastic answer\nthat's brilliant what are some of the\nother things that kind of come to your\nmom\nsome people just want to play games and\nget paid for them they don't actually\nwant to be the best so when they get to\nthe league they stop trying and then\nanother one is that people's motivations\nto be the best is to be better than\nother people rather than be better than\nthemselves and both of those are also\npretty catastrophic once you make it to\nthe league yeah so\nso that a couple of things so one is\njust want to pay and play and get paid I\nthink that's something that I don't\na really interesting observation as far\nas people wanting to be better than\nothers and not better than themselves\nthat's actually something that I think\nonce again there's a lot of psychology\nneuroscience and actual interventions\nthat you can do to fix so right now I'm\ntrying to develop two years ago I\ndeveloped sort of an evidence-based or\nscientifically based meditation regimen\nfor addiction so we have like we know\nfrom like different kinds of fMRI\nstudies and things like that that\nthere's some deficiencies or\nvulnerabilities in the brain of people\nwho have addictions and we also know\nthat meditation affects the brain in\ndifferent ways so can we sort of look at\nwhat we understand about the brain and\ndevelop a meditation regimen that\nspecifically targets the weaknesses for\npeople who have addiction and the answer\nis yes and now actually what I'm working\non because I think this is actually way\nmore fascinating is a regimen to target\nnarcissist in ego\nand my experience has been that like\nwhen you target narcissism and ego it\ncultivates so it gets rid of that sort\nof my value or my sense of self is based\non a relationship to others the second\nthing it gets rid of or the second thing\nit does is it starts to cultivate\nempathy because if you think about like\nyour an identity that's based on a\nrelationship to others it's all like\nvery egocentric and so you don't the\nonly reason that you think about other\npeople is not to like think about what\ntheir experience is like their value in\nyour life is to use as a measuring stick\nfor yourself you don't really think\nabout them as human beings you just\nthink about them as like objects to beat\nthey become milestones instead of people\nand and I think it's really fascinating\nbecause this this is also very prevalent\nand investment-banking\nbecause everyone is sort of like you\nhave bonuses right so people get\nsalaries which is like 50% and then\npeople get bonuses of like you know\nanywhere between a hundred and like a\nmillion dollars a year and when you when\nyou're sort of fake figuring out how\nmuch you're value do you compare your\nbonus to other people\nand as long as you're kind of doing that\nthat can be very hard on your ego it can\nbe very like fueling for your ego and it\ncan cause a lot of suffering I think\nthat's huge in terms of you know don't\ntry to be better than anyone else\nbecause that's sort of like an\negotistical kind of thing and like there\nare ways to dissolve that ego which I\nthink at the same time is going to\nimprove empathy it's a fascinating any\nother thoughts so you mentioned lack of\nrome role models some people just want\nto play and they want to get paid and\nthen people who want to be better than\nothers as opposed to better than\nthemselves those are probably the main\nthree that yeah yeah you know there's\nobviously like not caring about your\nphysical health or thinking that\nphysical health has no bearing on a game\nperformance like I don't know why that\nmyth still exists yeah it's a very\ncommon it's like you know if you sleep\nand drink water and work out you're\ngonna play better\nand people are like no I just need to\nplay yeah you know you know why they\nthink that Jane because they've never\ncared about their physical health and\nlook how far they got yeah no kidding\nright right so I once heard a great\nthere's a great kind of quote about the\nNBA so I think the hardest moment in a\ncoach's life is when you go into a\nchampionship game at halftime or maybe\nthis is the NFL you go into the champion\nyou go to the Super Bowl at halftime and\ntell your team that the strategy is you\nso you're down at halftime in the Super\nBowl the hardest speech a coach has ever\nhad to give is going into the the locker\nroom at halftime of the Super Bowl when\nyou're down and telling your team the\nstrategy that got you to this point is\nnot working\nI feel like why don't they prioritize\nhis physical health because I haven't\nhad to yeah subsisting off of Doritos\nPizza and Mountain Dew has gotten them\nthis far\nwhy would they change\num so I guess so a question to Jane so\ncannabis asks you talked about people\nbeing inefficient learners how would you\nsuggest people learn people approach\nlearning over watch\nrun towards the fear is the phrase that\nI really like in that there's a lot of\npros who actually don't know how some of\nthe characters in the game work and I\ndon't understand how that's acceptable\nor even becomes a thing but what running\ntowards the fear means is that if\nsomething annoys you or frustrates you\nor you think it's overpowered or or\nunderpowered for example learning the\nextremes or the things that kind of\nstick out to you like it's no zenyatta\nplayers for example people who one trick\nheroes like Zenyatta for example they\nbecome very susceptible to being killed\nby flankers for example and they as any\nother player is always going to think\nthat Genji and tracer and Sombra are\noverpowered pieces of [ __ ] but what you\nshould do is if you're are playing that\nhero and you're you know you hate that\nthing you fear that thing it just didn't\nalways you with frustrates you just play\nthose heroes and try and assassinate\nZen's and you'll learn from the other\nperspective what it looks like it\nbecomes it gains you the ability to\nempathize with your opponent and empathy\ndoesn't have to be a good thing but\nthere's also the way that people\napproach a game psychologically in terms\nof winning competitive battles\none-on-one 66's because they always try\nto force always try to force something\nto happen and they never try and coax\nthen ever trying to coax the opponent\ninto doing something that they want to\nin the absence of force and in order to\nproperly coax an opponent you need to be\nable to empathize with them\nthat's that's awesome Joe um that is a\nanother principle which I haven't talked\nabout yet but I work with a lot which is\nthe difference between creation and\ncultivation so I think our our society\nhas has gotten to the point where we\nalways try to create something and we've\nforgotten the value of cultivate\nand a lot of the change that I advocate\nor is not is not for people to create\nchange in their life but to cultivate\nchange and I think what you just said\nabout forcing versus coaxing is to\nunderstand that like some of the best\nways to do things in life are not to\nactually like zero in and shoot for it\ngung-ho which is sort of what our\nsociety kind of propagates but to like\nlet things grow\nanyway I think we're at time for today\nso thanks for coming on Jane and\nyou know any any closing thoughts that\nyou have no I just I hope everyone\nenjoyed it and yeah I mean I think it\nwas awesome I think people are loving it\neverybody saying you is that your next\nlevel wise and a smart guy I appreciate\nthat but if I was the you know also also\nyou got us a hundred gift subs from Lodi\np.m. so that was I mean I've never seen\nthat I literally thought someone was\ngetting hacked that's funny but no like\none of the one of the most important\nthings that I would encourage anyone to\ndo is think about how you're thinking\nand learn how to learn that's the number\none piece of advice I'd give anyone who\nwants to improve it something or become\na master of any task\ncompletely agree man so thank you so\nmuch for coming on you know good luck\nwith everything you're doing with Team\nCanada and Dallas fuel and then you know\nif there's any way that that we can\nsupport you in terms of any of this\nstuff I know we talked a little bit\nabout like eSports stuff but if you guys\nwant to like learn meditation I just let\nme know and then the last thing is you\nknow when when you are ready to reveal\nthings in terms of your secret projects\nif there's any way any way that we can\nsupport you or help spread the word or\nthink like that um you know I started\nstreaming on Twitch about a month ago\nbut things are growing slowly and\nsteadily and so if there's any way that\nwe can help you because I I mean I agree\na hundred percent with your missions I\nthink that that's I mean what I loved\nabout going to India and studying to\nbecome a monk is that like Yoga is the\nsystem that teaches you how your mind\nworks like it teaches you like where new\ndesires come from why do thoughts happen\nwhere how do behaviors function like how\ndoes all this stuff inside you work it's\nlike a formal class on the self and so\nof anything to support that mission of\nhelping people like learn how they think\nand to think how about their thinking\nand to learn about how they learn is\nsomething that I'm 100% in favor\nbut thanks a lot man thanks for having\nme on enjoy the rest year stream take\ncare good luck right now\n[Music]"
