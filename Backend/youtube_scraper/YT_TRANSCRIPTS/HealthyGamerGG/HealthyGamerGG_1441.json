    "transcript": "everyone in the history of humanity has\nhad a different set of circumstances a\ndifferent psyche different stats\ndifferent circumstances they're playing\ntheir own like every other human being\nis playing their own unique campaign and\nyour campaign is different your villain\nat the end of it is different your stats\nare different your skills are different\nyour class is different so play your RPG\ninstead of trying to play someone else's\nhelen has has reached what most people\nin the last century would call call\nsuccessful a family and children doesn't\nthat ease her burden my own situation so\nlet's start with that question doesn't\nthat ease her burden no right so like\nthe whole thing like the whole point\nbehind helen is on paper she's very\nsuccessful but she still feels like a\nfailure\nand that's like that's the whole point\nlike our emotions and parts of our being\ndon't respond to logic right they just\nthat's not how it works you have people\nwho like Devin for example who's like\nplagued with inadequacy even though as I\nunderstand he's very successful I see\nthat [ __ ] all the time\nI see like invent investment bankers in\nmy office that make you know over a\nmillion dollars a year and they still\nfeel like failures like it's bizarre\nthat human beings don't respond to logic\nif you guys responded to logic then like\nyou would like you're able to figure out\nwhat you're supposed to do and then\nyou're logically you know what you\nshould do and then like you would do it\nbut that's not I human beings work so\nbeing successful doesn't actually do\nanything to assuage our feel at fear of\nfailure or feeling of failure\nand my own situation is how to become\nsuccessful or face failure without the\ntraditional route a family career is\nthat possible\nabsolutely absolutely it's possible the\nfirst thing you need to understand is\nthat you're not walking a traditional\nroute which is fine so then you've got\nto figure out your untraditional route\nso let me be really clear on this like\nwhen I said it was my karma to fail like\nthat was my untraditional route I'm a\npsychiatrist and I'm streaming on Twitch\ninstead of talking to patients in my\noffice\nthat's untraditional but that's what the\nworld needs the world doesn't need an\nadditional psychiatrist who's gonna talk\nto like you know 20 patients a week and\ntalk to them about depression or anxiety\nwhat the world needs right now is\nsomeone to talk to people on Twitch\nbecause you guys are so and it's not\nyour fault but like so much of the world\nis divorced from mental health resources\nand the old model of mental health is\njust not working like Helen has been\nlooking for a therapist for weeks or\nmonths and she can't find what like\nsomething needs to change and so what I\nwant you guys to recognize is that\nyou're untraditional path is like is is\nexactly where you need to be\nif I had not failed like let's say I had\na 4.0 GPA and I applied to medical\nschool and I got in I would not have\nbeen a psychiatrist I probably would\nhave done internal medicine in oncology\nlike the reason I became a psychiatrist\nis because I dealt with all my own [ __ ]\nand then that makes me the person that I\nam today and allows me to help gamers\nwhat you guys need to understand is cut\nyourself a break and recognize that this\nis part of your path and the more that\nyou accept that your path is like is\ngonna be your own like what is a\ntraditional path that's just a\ncomparison to other people but that's\nstupid because everyone in the history\nof humanity has had a different set of\ncircumstances a different psyche\ndifferent stats different circumstances\nthey're playing their own like every\nother human being is playing their own\nunique campaign and your campaign is\ndifferent your villain at the end of it\nis different your stats are different\nyour skills are different your class is\ndifferent so play your RPG instead of\ntrying to play someone else's and that\nstarts by like understanding that okay\nI'm not on a traditional path fine\nthen start from where you are instead of\nwhere you should be or where other\npeople have been\nthat's the first step and it's\nabsolutely possible I'd say the reason\nthat you feel like it's impossible is\nbecause you're trying to live someone\nelse's life you're looking at a system\nof success you're looking at a script\nfor success and you're saying that's not\nworking for me I can't achieve that well\ndamn right because that's not your life\nthat's someone else's life\nso start playing your own [ __ ] RPG\nand see where you get you'd be surprised\n[Music]\nyes Oh someone's asking is real life a\nroguelike absolutely it's some\nprocedurally generated crap that wasn't\nscripted by anyone and it's ugly it's\nnot like you know level 1 to level 2\nlevel 3 it's like random crap that gets\nthrown your way and you have to learn\nhow to deal with it\nyou\n[Music]\nokay\nyeah so like dr. Joe Bree says I believe\npeople who never felt like they belong\nto anywhere come to twitch hoping that\nthey would belong absolutely right so\nyou live in a day and time where there\nis a community for rejects like think\nabout that that's awesome there is a\nplace you can go where everyone else is\na reject those are your people and then\nthe other cool thing for me is that\nthere is there's literally a platform\nthat causes all you [ __ ] to coalesce\nin one place that I can talk to I don't\nhave to go and hunt you all down you'll\ncome here like that's amazing it makes\nmy job so much easier like it's amazing\nthe circumstances that we live with in\nmy roguelike magically this platform\nappears where you guys all show up and I\njust get to talk to my computer screen\nand I hit every single one of you like\nhow awesome is that now you could look\nat me and you could say that this is\nthis isn't like this is a\nnon-traditional road to success like\nabsolutely like thank God because if I\nhad to sit in my office and just talk to\nlike individual people talking about\ntheir individual problems all day long\nlike I would I just couldn't do it\nso my personality is also something that\nI get bored easily so I can't just be a\nregular therapist I have to do something\nelse so I could have looked at this and\nI could have said oh I can't work for 40\nhours a week I can only work for 20\nhours a week before I start pulling my\nhair out and I could say that I'm less\nI'm less successful because my\ncolleagues can sit in an office all day\nand I just can't do it I need to be\nbetter I need to be more patient I need\nto be able to like sit in the same\n[ __ ] chair this chair I can only sit\nin that chair for 20 hours a week it's\nall I can do and I could have said that\nI'm a failure by using someone else's\nstandard but God gave me twitch right so\nthat I can come on here and I can talk\nto myself I don't even know if you guys\nare real or Elle BOTS like I don't even\nknow\nbut this works and so take a look at\nyour life and realize that if you're a\nfailure it's because you're playing the\nwrong [ __ ] game\nlike you're going onto the golf course\nand you're saying like I can't hit a\nthree-pointer well yeah that's because\nyou're not playing basketball\nlike play your own game don't play\nsomeone else's game play your own game\nand then like see how far you can go if\nyou just play your own game accept\nyourself for who you are\naccept where you are\nand then like play that game right with\nyour stats with your busted-ass main\ncharacter who's got like those like like\nyou picked a lot of perk flaws right\nlike you know that [ __ ] that gives you\nlike extra points like you picked a lot\nof those you pick like lazy and you\npicked like addicted to video games and\nyou picked like body odor\nbut the cool thing is somewhere in there\nyou've got you've got some positive\nparts the problem is you're just not\nlike you've got like plus 30 skill two\nlike guns but the problem is like you\nnever use a gun so you're not\nrecognizing that you're actually amazing\nat something but the problem is that\nyou're trying to live a scripted life so\npick up a gun well don't pick up a gun\nthat's stupid\nI mean don't not literally a gun like I\ndon't want this to be misinterpreted\nbut you know like there's something that\nyou're good at you're just too busy\nblaming yourself for not being good at\nwhat other people are good at to even\nstop and figure that [ __ ] out\nso like think about what you like and\nnow we're gonna get to another question\nso some people have been asking me how\ndo you find your Dharma your Dharma\nmeans duty or responsibility how do you\nfind your Dharma by looking by stopping\nand thinking like what is it that you\nwhat is it that you like to start there\nstart start there right like what is it\nthat you like what is it that you're\ninterested in\nbut I want you guys to think about this\nfor a second\nso ten years ago someone I like let's\nsay hypothetically I was around ten\nyears ago and I asked someone what do\nyou what do you like and they said uh\ndoc I don't like anything except for\nvideo games and like I would say okay\nwell sucks for you because what you like\nwhich is just [ __ ] playing video\ngames all day is a non marketable skill\nwhat do you think about that now\nright like holy [ __ ]\nprize pools in dota 2 are larger than\nany professional physical sport\nthirty million dollars playing a [ __ ]\nvideo game\nthe world is changing\nand just because the the patterns of old\naren't working like let's even go back\nlike 10 years okay doc I want to make a\nvideogame well that's tough because in\norder to make a videogame you need to\napply for a job at a major publishing\ncompany and there's this whole pipeline\nand it's really hard to like break into\nthe industry\nyou guys know like this game axiom verge\nhave you guys heard of axiom verge or\nundertale like think about the world\nthat you live in axiom verge was made by\none guy game is amazing\nundertale made by one dude\nright you guys live in a world where\nlike you don't have to break into an\nindustry\nyou don't have to break into anything\nthe barrier to publication is so low\nthat you can just make something\nyou could just make it you can just\nwrite a book and you don't even have to\nget a contract from a publisher anymore\nyou just self publish on Amazon you can\nmake a video game and just Steam\ngreenlight\nyou could just buy a camp like this is\nwhat I did six weeks ago I was like I\nwant to start streaming on Twitch I'm\ntired of seeing people in my office\nbought a couple of cameras checked out\nTom's like he's got this great guide on\nhis website\nand then I started streaming so big\ndudas asks does it have to be good\nyou're damn right it has to be good so\nyou've got to work at it I'm not saying\nthat you're gonna be successful if you\njust half-ass a video game but that's\nsomething that you've got to like that's\nsomething that you've got to do right\nthat's something you can work at success\nisn't easy but you don't have to follow\nthe traditional model and you can follow\nthe traditional model too this is where\nyou start thinking about your career in\nterms of okay this is what I really love\nto do this is what I care about and then\nyou look at the array of options for\ncareers and you pick one that sort of\nfits so you could say like so yeah I\ndon't know if you guys know there's a\nthere's an author named Brandon\nSanderson so I loved his books he wrote\nlike Miss Bourne and things like that\nand so Brandon Sanderson you guys know\nwhat his job was he was the night\nmanager at a hotel which is brilliant\nbecause he got paid for being there and\nlike everyone is asleep at night over\nthe hotel so he could just write for\nlike eight hours a day while collecting\na paycheck to pay his bills\nand so like that's what I want you guys\nto rethink right so you're a failure\nfine like how can you make this work\nthink about it and be yeah thanks for\nlinking to Tom Tom scream I mean uh\ntwitch and think about like think about\nreally what your situation is and like\nthink about the circumstances of your\nlife think about the hand that you were\ndealt and it takes time and effort to\nstop and think about this think about\nwhat's getting in the way think about\nthe emotions that keep you from saying\nlike keep you from pursuing your dream\nlike if you want to write a fiction\nnovel start [ __ ] writing forget no\nnot November this is like NaNoWriMo you\nguys don't know what the National Novel\nWriting Month so a group of people all\nover the world sit down and over the\ncourse of 30 days they just write a\nnovel and they like meet at like\ndifferent coffee shops and people's\nhouses and they just start writing it's\namazing\nanyway my rant is complete"
