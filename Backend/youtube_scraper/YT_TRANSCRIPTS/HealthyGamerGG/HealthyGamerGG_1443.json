    "transcript": "right right you started off as a\ndeprived so you had no gear\nso when you get because you're running\naround in a loincloth at a club\nI'm a slow-rolling deprived for\nsomething yeah like if someone deserves\na break it's you buddy\nso bulliest is that what I'm calling you\ntoday buddy or Matt either one okay one\ndoesn't bother me so Matt thanks for\ncoming on thank thanks for coming on\nstream man you're welcome I mean yeah\nlike I said earlier should Google won\nhey thinking use them no worries so tell\nus a little bit about what's going on\nand and what's going on in your life and\nhow we can be helpful for you I mean\nit's like a lot of things right I I'd\nsay like I kind of struggle with like\nmoving forward in life and having a\npurpose and sort of like just knowing\nwhat to do with myself okay motivation\ndefinitely one big thing okay and so\nwhen you say it's a lot of different\nthings that sounds to me kind of like\none thing what do you mean with that\nwell having so it sounds like you just\ndon't know what to do with yourself like\nright that's why you don't have\nmotivation like you don't know what\nyou're what you don't know what you're\ndoing in life yeah okay yeah that's fair\nenough yeah so why is it that we if if\nyou just don't know what's going on like\nwhy do we come up with multiple answers\nlike how do you think that works say\nthat it again well okay let me ask you\nthis so the basic problem is that your\ndirectionless in life right right but\nwhen I asked you what's bringing you on\nyou say it's a lot of different stuff\nright right right so let's just let's\njust explore for a second why it is that\nwe feel like a lot of different things\nare going wrong when there's just one\nroot problem um maybe sort of the\nsymptoms of that absolutely absolutely\nso let me ask you something Matt do you\nfeel like you're overwhelmed I'd say so\nI think I'm pretty overwhelmed with\neverything yeah right so I want you to\njust notice for a second that even\nthough there's one problem that the\nfeeling of being overwhelmed makes you\nthink that there are a thousand\ndifferent\nlike you see all of the symptoms and\nthat's exactly what feeling overwhelmed\ndoes when we feel overwhelmed we take\none problem and we can see all of the\ndifferent things going on with it\nand that overwhelms us and also\nparalyzes us you're smiling\nwhy are you smiling either I don't know\nawkwardness or just okay realizing what\nyou're saying okay so how do you feel\nright now\nank yes okay what what do you mean by\nanxious um just being on streams like\nshare 50 people or whatever sort of\nthing okay Wow there are 50 people\nokay well we'll lose viewership soon\ndon't worry thanks for coming on and\nbeing honest with us because I think\nthis helps a lot of people so thank you\nfor doing that yeah no worries so what\nis it that feels overwhelming um it's\nyou're just trying to figure out cuz I\nfeel like there's so many options with\nlike what to do with my life and it's\nalso like I don't really know how to\nfind that or even figure out what I'm\ndoing or what I'm doing wrong or yeah\nyou know what I mean yeah so I'm here\nwhat I'm hearing from you is that you\ndon't know where to start\nI'd say yeah that's a pretty pretty\naccurate yeah so so I think that the\nchallenge here is that I think Matt\nyou're a smart guy and so the problem\nwith being a smart guy is that you can\nsee many different options right like\nyou're you're a hypothetical analytical\ncapability you can say to yourself oh I\ncould do this or I could do this or I\ncould do this or I could do this but\nthen it's hard for you to figure out\nwhich one to actually do right so what\ndo you what do you think it is that so\ntell me what don't you like about your\nlife right now and only I feel\nmyself all the time I don't like feeling\nlike there's a lot of like chaos and\nthings that are I can't\nI struggle they do like do the dishes or\nclean my room and do my laundry like so\nmuch stuff that regular people can just\nyou normally not feeling like I have a\npurpose or goal definitely as well okay\nhow do you feel about yourself it's been\nslowly getting better but I don't think\nI a lot of time I just don't feel good\nin general not kind of applies to myself\nas well\nlooking like what just not liking who I\nam or I've been I've been able to look\nin the mirror and like lay like how I\nlook more recently but just like um\nbeing beating myself up over mistakes\nand stuff like that okay do you feel\nlike you're kind of a bad person at\ntimes be like you're a waste of space no\nI don't think I'm a waste of space but\nokay yeah I mean I generally say I'm a\npretty decent person like I try not to\nbe a crappy person but I mean everyone\nis good for you man so but everyone what\neveryone has their moments right and\nlike everyone can mess up and do things\nthat aren't good right yeah and it\nsounds like you've been practicing yet\nforgiving yourself for those moments um\n[Music]\nyeah kind of I think so somewhat okay so\noddly enough I'm not hearing anything\nthat makes me think of so it sounds like\nyou have kind of a low estimation of\nyourself right help me understand what\nkind of thoughts you have I mean I can\nbe like very critical of myself over\nthings that are like dumb or like well\nokay hold on so why do you think they're\ndumb I think I don't know something\naren't important so do you see what\nyou're doing right there\nyou're being critical of the way that\nyou're critical of yourself because\nyou're calling them dumb great right you\nsee that it's a whole whole thing yeah\nyeah it's like a whole meta level thing\nyeah so what are you critical of\nyourself about it's hard to think okay\nokay so let me help you out so you\nmentioned earlier that you struggled to\ndo a lot of things that normal people\ncan do right like what like yeah like do\nmy dishes and I was going to the gym for\na while but then I stopped I'm okay and\nbroke up and like doing recycling like\ndoing just like the general things like\nshowering every day and okay brush my\nteeth like take care taking care of\nyourself yeah or not taking care of\nyourself right yeah and and is that\nsomething that what so do you this is\ngonna sound weird do you think that\nthat's a dumb thing to be mad at\nyourself about or an appropriate thing\nto be mad at yourself about no that's\nthat's appropriate okay so I want you to\njust notice the critical nature of your\nmind right it's like your mind has\nactually like a mode of operation what\nwhat game your gamer yeah what do you\nplay I was playing Dark Souls earlier I\nalso play a lot of like MMOs I grew up\non like Korean MMO is like maplestory\nand stuff like that okay\nokay so you know in Dark Souls we have\ndifferent loadouts right right so right\nnow your mind has equipped the self\ncritical loadout right and so it doesn't\nmatter like what you know it's like you\nknow so I would say the self critical\nloadout is almost like slow rolling in\nDark Souls like it doesn't matter what\narmor you're wearing if you're slow\nrolling you're slow rolling so you can\ntry to change as many different things\nas you want to about your equipment but\nif you're if you're slow rolling it's\nalways gonna be slow lowering it's the\nonly thing that your mind knows how to\ndo right so you can be self-critical\nlike so the\nfirst thing that I want you to do if if\nyou want to be free from your\nself-critical thoughts there are a\ncouple of things that we're gonna work\non the first thing though is just to\nnotice what your mind is doing right\nbecause this phone okay so a lot of\ntimes like we operate based on what our\nmind tells us to do but we don't really\nquestion the operations of our mind it's\nlike if you wake up one day and you\ndecide like okay I don't feel like\nshowering you sort of fight a little war\nwith your mind but you never try to\nunderstand like why is it that I am\ndon't want a shower you try to fight\nyour mind you don't try to understand it\nright so the first thing that I want you\nto do is just try to catch yourself when\nyou make a self critical thought and\nwe're gonna talk some more and I'm gonna\nkeep an eye out for it and I want twitch\nchat to keep an eye out for it okay\nokay I'm not actually watching twitch\nchat but I don't know I mean anything\nokay since we were saying don't was just\nyeah don't watch twitch chat so alright\nthe first thing is just I want you to\nnotice the the self-critical mind and\nnotice how like your neurons have\nbasically locked into a pattern of self\njudgment and the reason that this is a\nproblem like if you are judging yourself\nand you're critical towards yourself\nwhat do you think that does for your\nmotivation does not help okay so I want\nyou to now we're gonna expand that a\nlittle bit do you think it motivates you\nto do some things yeah\nI'd see sometimes yeah yeah like what\ndon't blink\nokay that's okay so so it's it's it's\nit's good enough that I think you're\naware that maybe somewhere in there\nthere's some kind of motivation you're\njust not able to figure out what it is\nand so let me help you out so this is\nwhat I want you to understand Matt when\nyou wake up to play video games like if\nyou play video games all day like what I\nwant you to think about for a moment and\nappreciate is not it's not that you lack\nmotivation it's just that you're\nmotivated to play video games all day\nlike if you think about like if you're\nif you're playing video games so much\nthat you're not like let's say showering\nor brushing your teeth or taking out the\nrecycling that's actually a very high\ndegree of motivation you're so motivated\nto play games that you're you're letting\nall this other basic stuff like fall to\nthe side like imagine I was an artist\nand I went into my studio and for three\ndays and three nights I shat in a bucket\nI didn't brush my teeth and I didn't\nshower and I produced this great work of\nart we would call me highly motivated\nright yeah but like so the first thing\nis that for you to understand that you\nactually have a lot of motivation it's\njust not in the direction that you want\nso this is where I think negative\nemotions and negative feelings about\nyourself are gonna motivate you to do\nsome things and mainly what they're\ngonna motivate you towards us to be\navoidant right let's just say you\nwouldn't yeah yeah right so give us some\nexamples help us understand that so for\nexample my I got in a car accident with\nmy with my ex like a pretty the end of\nSeptember okay and my parents didn't\nknow about it until like two-week nerds\nlike a weaker - yeah I think about a\nweek ago like last weekend sort of\nthings because I was just like so scared\nof like how they would react that I just\ndidn't didn't tell them okay so let's\nthink of\nthat for a second so when you're afraid\nof how they're going to react how can I\nsay this so that sounds like a\nreasonable fear or your parents rough\nwith you sometimes I'd say so\nokay can you tell us a little bit about\nthat um I know my brothers in here as\nwell so you can probably really sort of\nbut I think kind of my last brother yeah\nmy thoughts on it or I say my might I\nsaw my dad recently cuz he lives he\nlives in the province over so like kind\nof far and he can be very he can be very\nlike abrasive I guess he can be very\nnegative like hard to hard to get along\nwith cuz he's always like complaining\nabout stuff or I mean he's been better\nlike he's been more supportive but\nthat's like weird more recent uh-huh\nsometimes I would like I would visit him\nand I'd be like I don't want to be here\nbecause just because of the way he acts\nlike it's hard to be around him for like\na long period of time how does it how\ndoes that feel when you're around him it\njust feels weird I mean and it like he\nfeels just awkward sort of thing I feel\nlike what feels weird about it\njust I think my\nrelationship with him so it's like I\ndon't know how to how to act run him\nlike to dream like a friend really be\ndad like okay it's just odd yeah it\nsounds like you don't know what you're\nsupposed to do when you're with him\nright like you don't know what to say or\nyou don't know how to actor yeah it's I\nsee it's generally kind of what it feels\nlike with family and I feel like when I\nwhen I tried to be\nI tried to be like honest sometimes it\ncan get me in trouble or can you help me\nunderstand that so like I basically I\nhad a whole big argument with my parents\nthe other day over like I was kind of\ntalking about my mental health with my\nmom and she didn't um she's like oh do\nyou think your your mental health\naffects your motivation I was like yeah\nshe said where do you think that comes\nfrom and I'm like well I think when you\nguys got divorced those kind of the\nwhole catalyst for everything right or\nthe starting point because that's in my\nmind that's where I think it was like\nwhere it started from\nand what do you mean by that what\nstarted with what how old are you and\nyour parents got divorced probably 7 or\n8 yeah look at seven six seventy tumor\nin those three years and what do you\nthink it was that started I think like\njust sort of like a downward spiral of\nuh of me not feeling good about myself\nand not doing like things I should be\ndoing like my homework or just kind of\nyeah just not feeling good all the time\nor not I'm doing like good about\nanything or sort of just the depression\nsort of thing I think okay when you say\nthe depression sort of things so it\nsounds like you started to not do the\nthings that you were supposed to do it\nsounds like you started to feel bad\nabout yourself I'd say so long it's hard\nmy memories kind of been messed up over\nthe over the years they used to be a lot\nbetter\nbut so I don't really remember a lot of\nit but I know that was like the starting\npoint what do you remember um I just\nremember feeling like really alone in my\nlife\nfor a long time mm-hmm like it's\nprobably the biggest thing what is it\nlike to feel alone just I don't know\nlike there's nobody supports you or\nnobody cares about you enough to like\nwonder how you're feeling or or how\nyou're doing there mm-hmm and you did\nyour parents did your parents ever talk\nto you about how the divorce was\naffecting you not really I don't think\nso\nand you started feeling pretty alone\naround the age of 7 or 8 mm-hmm yeah\nthat I feel sorry right go ahead oh I\nwas saying because um it was like that\nand then moving a lot and having like a\nnew stepdad who wasn't the greatest I\nknow also with her stuff right so kind\nof compounded I guess okay tell me about\nmoving well I moved from Alberta to to\nto BC in probably I don't know how about\nhow long later like within a year of the\ndivorce so it was like I had I had lost\nall my friends and hmm\nwas it hard to make new friends at the\nat the\nI went to it wasn't too bad but I moved\nto and after that I moved to an area\nthat's like primarily East Indian people\nso like people similar to your ethnicity\nand because I'm like a white kid it was\nharder to make friends right so that's\nkind of part of it I think as well not\nhaving as many friends wow that sounds\nkind of rough cuz it sounds like you\nactually made the first transition okay\nmade some friends and then it sounds\nlike your mom and stepdad up and moved\nagain yeah just when things were going\nwell for you yeah you're making an\nadjustment and life kicks you when\nyou're when you're just about to get up\nright intends to I find yeah for sure\nthat's definitely you cut you kind of\ntalk about a downward spiral I think\nthat'll do it yeah sorry man that sucks\nthat's okay it's in the past I guess I\nthink it's in the present yeah what I\nwell I mean yeah it's still if all that\nstuff still affects me right so yeah I\nthink it's yeah isn't yeah I think it's\nimportant to acknowledge that mm-hmm\nbecause what does that say about you as\na person that it still affects me or\nyeah because remember I mean somewhere\nalong the way we were talking about how\nyou're like not a it's not that you're\nnot a good person but that you can't you\nknow you're kind of [ __ ] up yeah\nright that's the sentiment that I get\nit's not that you're a bad person it's\njust that you're kind of [ __ ] up\nlet's say so yeah and so what I'm kind\nof curious about is like do you deserve\na little bit of slack I think so but I\nmean when I try to be honest with like I\nthink he's so what I when I tried to be\nhonest with my parents about that like\nthey just got angry and thought I was\nlike blaming them for everything that\nI'd done and stuff I was like kind of\nunderstandable I mean I talked to about\nit with my therapist a little okay and I\ncan understand why\ngot mad but it's like I don't know but I\njust want them to kind of understand\nthat like everything had an effect on me\nmm-hmm but I don't think that's probably\nI don't think it's gonna happen so yeah\nI think it can be rough it can be hard\nfor parents to understand that it can be\nhard for one human being to understand\nthat my actions can affect you and that\nthat doesn't necessarily mean that it's\nmy fault but that at the same time it\ncan be hard for you right you know it\ncan be very hard for parents to not hear\nblame when you kind of talk about\nsomething like a divorce which may have\nbeen the right move on some level still\nlike I mean some some things are gonna\nbe shitty and like that's just how it is\nit doesn't mean that it's necessarily\ntheir fault right so do you think you\ndeserve some slack I think so\nbut I mean yeah at the same time I feel\nlike I'm still pretty critical of myself\nbecause of yeah right since there's the\nslow roll right so so when we think a\nlittle bit about what you've been\nthrough like it's reasonable to think\nthat you know you're not just [ __ ] up\neverything I mean I think you've been\ndealt a kind of a rough hand right right\nyou started off as a deprived so you had\nno gear it's when you get because you're\nrunning around in a loincloth in a club\nI'm a slow rolling deprived for saying\nyeah like if someone deserves a break\nit's you buddy\ncuz you managed to slow roll in a\nloincloth like that's not easy to do in\ndark school so why don't you give\nyourself a break cuz I feel like I could\nbe doing more to help myself\nbut I'm not I don't know how and what is\nthat that's the slow roll right see that\nmm-hmm you're you're you're not doing\ngood enough you're [ __ ] it up\nwe could be helping yourself more Matt\nwhy don't you help yourself more there\nit is again so I mean I think the hard\nthing is like you know these thoughts\nthat you have are kind of like a hedge\nmaze like everywhere you turn it's just\nhedge hedge hedge\neverywhere you turn it's like critical\ncritical critical right right it's hard\nto get anywhere when you're slow rolling\njust takes a long time yeah and so what\ndo we what do we do about that\nI don't know okay how do you think if\nyou were your friend what would you do\n[Music]\nstill don't know okay I'll just\nAsya my situation I don't know it's just\nweird to think about I don't know what I\nwould even do I probably help someone\nbut I don't know how I'd help them okay\nso oddly enough Matt that's the first\nfast roll you've done I want to point\nout what you did right so like you said\nlike I don't know how I would help them\nbut I would I want to help they deserve\nhelp I just don't know how that's not\nself-critical that's actually like\nacknowledgement you see that if not you\ngot to let me know I would even by its\nacknowledgment so I think that you're in\na tough situation and you don't know how\nto move forward but there's a big\ndifference between the slow roll which\nis why don't you know how to move\nforward Matt right and I don't know how\nto move forward do you see the\ndifference between those two statements\nyeah what's the difference once more\nconstructive in what way\nit's not just me beating myself you\nI think the other thing is it's an\nacknowledgement of where you are because\nall of your self-critical thoughts are\nabout where you should be\ndoes that make sense yeah you should be\nhelping yourself more you should be\ntaking care of yourself better you\nshouldn't let all this stuff from the\npast affect you we can we can replace\nall those self-critical thoughts with\nthe word shut there's actually a big\ndifference between I should be helping\nmyself more and I don't know how to help\nmyself even though that sounds like a\nstatement of ignorance I actually think\nit's a statement of knowledge it's I\nknow that I don't know what to do right\nthat I actually think is incredibly\npowerful that may not feel like it but I\nthink that's the first step for it and\nsort of saying hey like I'm sort of\nstuck here I'm not hearing any blame I'm\nnot I'm not hearing like why am I stuck\nhere like why did I end up in this place\nwhy didn't I why couldn't I get out of\nthis place you're just kind of saying\nlike well here I am I don't really know\nwhat to do here I have the slow rolling\ndeprived it's gonna be hard it's gonna\nbe hard to beat anything if I'm slow\nrolling around with the you know with\nthe obese body type in Dark Souls can't\neven begun dear yeah gun dears Hardman\nyeah I died to him three times every\nother class I've beaten in one try as\npontiff so gun dears in three right\nthere's the gun dieren wait yeah yeah\nyeah but the way to beat gun deer is\njust to hand your club and you don't\nneed to roll he's got a stun his ass\nhe's got he's got low fatigue right or\nwhatever that is guard brain or whatever\nPulis aminah yeah just go to town and\nthat's what you got a dude stop slow\nrolling just go to town start picking up\nthe clover yes yeah yeah so what is\npicking up the club for you what does\nthat mean doing something\nthat feels like I'm moving forward I\nguess yeah\nI would even stop but take a step back\nfrom feels like you're moving forward\njust do something move forward what does\nthat mean practically\num like yeah I just try to do something\nthat will lead to something better I\nguess yeah what does that mean I don't\nknow what's something that you're not\ndoing right you've mentioned a couple of\nconcrete things right like what if you\nmeant sure like what like cleaning my\nroom okay what in your room needs to be\ncleaned I need to do my laundry and\ndishes and stuff laundry and dishes how\nlong does that take\nthere's a lot of laundry so let's take a\nwhile but I think the dishes would take\nme a maybe like a half hour and how long\nhow are you gonna do your laundry like\njust put it in the washing machine and\nthen the dryer okay so we're gonna do a\nlittle bit of meditation because I hear\npeople on stream want to do more\nmeditation okay okay so I want you to\nclose your eyes sit up straight\nI want you to tell me how you feel right\nnow um I don't know kind of anxious a\nlittle I think but okay anxious\ngenerally okay what do you feel in your\nbody just like my hands I guess okay so\nI just want you to take a snapshot of\nhow you feel right now\nI want you to notice that there's some\nanxiety but I would guess that there's a\ncertain heaviness which you've gotten\nused to feeling mm-hmm right does that\nmake sense to you yeah I do so you kind\nof feel heavy although other time I'd\nsay yeah okay so I want you to check\nyour incumbrance right now and just make\na mental note of what it is\nokay okay that's what we're gonna do so\nnow I want you to open your eyes you\nhave dishes in your room yeah okay so\nyou have was the washing machine being\noccupied no okay you know where I'm\ngoing\nnobody go do dishes and wash yeah so I\nwant you to come back in ten minutes\ndo what you can ten minutes okay can go\nput in a load of laundry you have a\nphone or something yeah just set a timer\nokay and and go put in a load of laundry\nand do as many dishes as you can okay\nright so what are we doing right now\nyou're you're equipping that Club like\nyou made the mistake of like hitting the\nthe right direct d-pad button so you\nswapped out the club for the fists and\nthen it's like we got a straight sword\nyeah for the broken straight so are\nthere it is and that's not gonna work\ncuz that's not gonna hurt the not enough\nboys damage so go twitch at is waiting\nokay I'm losing viewers as we speak okay\nokay so so I know that twitch chat I\nhear people saying god I need someone\nlike this in my life who motivates me to\ndo things so news flash to a chat you\ncan do something too so I want you guys\nto think about the same thing right\nwe're gonna we're gonna do I want you\nguys to close your eyes and think about\nhow you feel feel the energy in your\nbody or the lack thereof feel the\nfatigue like focus on your lower back\nand feel like the gel in your lower back\nlike feel the heaviness just close your\neyes and and just feel the way that you\nfeel right now\nnow get now open your eyes and look\naround if you've already done yeah if\nyou don't understand what I'm saying\nthat's okay\nlook around at the things that you need\nto do and we've got seven minutes but\nwhat can you do in seven minutes if you\nhaven't if you've already done your\nlaundry fine is there anything that you\nneed to clean do you need to go through\nyour mail do you need to do anything you\nhave dishes to do you need to brush your\nteeth okay so if you've got dishes go to\nyour dishes and then otherwise if you\nguys don't have anything else to do I'm\ngonna do one round of Surya Namaskar and\nyou guys can do it with me okay I want\nyou guys to follow along and up straight\nfront of you let your heels touch gather\nand then arms up touch your biceps\nsecret here feel the stretch\nand touch your toes but yours let your\nhead hang\nlet the weight of your body drag you\ndown\n[Music]\nokay but the weight of your body hang\ndown now put your palms by your feet\nstraight line and extend one knee back\nso your two hands and one your left foot\nshould be aligned your other foot should\nbe back put the other foot back you're\ngonna kind of be

change that you want to\nsee in the world I want to see a bunch\nof inflexible gamers trying to touch\ntheir toes not a bunch of flexible yoga\nteachers actually touching their toes so\nI have a question for you guys what do\nyou guys think how do you guys think\nthat bully Asst is gonna feel when he\ncomes back anyone have any idea okay\nlet's see alright so we'll see but he's\ngot about a

aren't we supposed to be\ntalking about his feelings I'm a\npsychiatrist isn't that what we talk\nabout\ndoesn't he need therapy talking about\nhow he's depressed his parents are\ndivorced he feels alone\nhow does this work why am I doing this\nand the other question is so how is it\nthat twitch chat so I'm just gonna read\nout loud\nexhausted much better lifted lighter\naccomplished accomplished motivated\nrefreshed and slightly put proud anxious\nat peace mini quest completed better\ndishes aren't nagging him anymore\nrelieved to energized at beat the time\nnice\nokay so did you guys hear what he said\nWhat did he say I said it Oh am I\nsupposed to say out all right what did\nyou say to beat the timer nice yeah I\ndidn't think I was gonna hear you say\nthe word nice and the way that you did\nover the course of our session today\nwhat does that make sense\nOh cuz uh what how did you what is what\nis that nice what does that mean how's\nthat feels like a good feeling yeah how\ndo you feel right now better in what way\nyeah feel like I accomplished something\ndid something that I needed to do\nclose your eyes okay how do you feel um\na little better yeah just kinda happy\nexcited okay how's your encumbrance a\nlittle better but I still feel happy\nyeah it's a bully açaí think you have a\nlot of work how do you man I think sorry\nhow do you feel about that\nI don't know indifferent maybe mm-hmm\nwhat happens to that feeling of slight\nexcitement as you start to think about\nthe problems ahead it's like oh [ __ ]\nabsolutely right that's the feeling all\nright that's the feeling so now this is\nthe big revelation so like if we if I\nwanted to sell you guys a false sense of\njoy and hope I wouldn't have asked you\nwhat do you think about the future we\nwould have stopped the stream with how\ndo you feel you say better and then I\nsay cure rise and walk you were cured my\nfriend I have fixed but that's not how\nit works so now we're gonna wait back\ninto the ship and when you start\nthinking about changing your life you\nstart to feel like this is insignificant\nright right yeah so now we're gonna do\nthe real teaching okay okay which is\nwhat is the difference between how you\nfelt sixty seconds ago and how you feel\nnow or actually not not what is the\ndifference so you understand you feel\ndifferent you felt good sixty seconds\nago now I'm making you feel worse again\nright indifferent means that the evil\nogre that has been lurking in your mind\nis starting to come out again and it's\nlike like you feel conflicted because\nyou feel hope and that Specter is still\nthere does that make sense I don't think\nit's truly indifference I think it's\nconflict right yeah okay okay so what so\nlet's just think about what the mind was\ndoing when you were feeling good and\nwhat the mind was doing when you started\nto feel bad was your your mind in the\npast present or future when you were\nfeeling good present and when I asked\nyou what does this mean for you going\nforward where is your mind future yeah\nyeah and when you're critical about\nyourself where is your mind pastor\nbeautiful okay so now I just want you to\nappreciate that for a second\nand now we're gonna do I want you to do\nanother experiment for us okay and then\nwe're gonna move to QA bulliest unless\nyou want to like talk about your parents\nand stuff but my mom and I can talk more\nabout it I feel low that like the best\nway to help you right now is to actually\nhave you do to notice this for a minute\nso I'm gonna ask you to continue still\nhave more [ __ ] to clean yeah okay so\nwe're gonna we're gonna transition to\nwe're gonna transition to QA but I want\nyou to pay attention to something and I\nwant you to check back in with us in\nabout 15-20 minutes half an hour I want\nyou to do more work and then up and try\nto notice where your mind is like as you\ndo more work like try to get a sense of\nokay is my map mine in the past the\npresent or the future and then I want\nyou to come back on in about 15-20\nminutes after we answer a few questions\nand then we're gonna talk some more and\nI want you to try to notice as you start\nto feel bad where does your mind go okay\nokay do you have thoughts about what the\npunch line is or do you want to just\nwait until we get to the like until you\nactually do it well I'm sure the punch\nline is future bad president good okay\nso experiment right so this is what I\nwant you guys to do at home as well as\nlike understanding intellectually what\nthe punch line is is helpful but what\nreally needs to be done is an\nexperiential understanding in Sanskrit\nthere are two words for knowledge Vidya\nand yawn Vidya means information Vidya\nis transmissible in its objective Gian\nis experiential personal and subjective\nour society Matt which one do you think\nour society values more probably the\nthe former yeah Vidhya right yeah\ninformation and objective I completely\nagree with you but if you want to change\nyour life Vidya doesn't do it\ninformation does not change your life\nexperience changes your life so knowing\nthe punch line in feeling the punch line\nor two different things right like\nyou're a smart guy and I bet I could\nhave asked to a chat about like you know\npast present future but I just want you\nto appreciate for a moment that when you\nwere living in the present you actually\nstarted to feel better\nyou felt excitement twitch at was saying\nthat you looked happy okay like you were\nsmiling but that wasn't an anxious I'm\nembarrassed because I'm [ __ ] talking\nto the Internet smile that was like that\noh I actually did something today smile\nthose are two different things\nand then just think about all of the\ntimes that you're feeling bad where is\nyour mind somewhere else yeah so now go\nand test it right so go and continue to\ndo work and check back with us in 15-20\nminutes okay oh do some recycling huh\nokay so like how long what are you doing\nwill be doing 15 minutes 20 minutes help\nme understand what are we doing uh let's\ntry 15 I'm sure there's more stuff I\ncould do anyways okay 15 yeah plenty of\nstuff I could do okay\nso we'll check back with you in 15 okay\nI'll set the timer and then I'll just\nput music in or whatever okay okay so\nVidya and beyond good job dude go for it\nbuddy\nI think we can talk about your feelings\nwhen you get back awesome okay okay\nwe're gonna jump to Q&A for a little bit\nall right so for\nquestion\nokay our dude is back so we're gonna\nswitch alright so I don't know how much\nof our congressmen do you catch any of\nour conversation I heard like uh\nbasically like the latter half of that\nlast thing about girls okay so the\nquestion that we had was about like\nshould you focus on yourself or should\nyou ask girls out um but let's come back\nto the present so tell me how you feel\nMatt pretty okay what does that mean\nlike not a crappy just okay kind of okay\num observant or something like\nunconscious beautiful right so this is\nsomething that's actually really cool\nthat's happening\nso now you've you've noticed that\nthere's a third way of operating it's\nnot good or bad but that there's\nactually like there's perpendicular\nmovement on that axis like earlier we\nwere talking about feeling good or\nfeeling bad and now you've discovered\nthat there's a third layer like there's\nlike a layer up here does that make\nsense yeah and you're just watching\nyourself right and that that thing\ndoesn't feel good or bad right okay I'm\ngoing to ask\nyou something do you feel peaceful yeah\nI'd say peaceful is a good word for it\nright so this is something that's really\nimportant to understand peacefulness and\nsuffering is on a different axis from\nemotion excitement happiness joy sadness\nself-loathing all of those operate over\nhere and peacefulness and suffering are\nup here okay do you do you it's sort of\nlike a neutral feeling right yeah like\nyou're watching yourself right yeah so\nthat's the first step to something\ncalled vairagya or detachment there's\nspace you used to be all here and now a\npiece of you has moved over here and\nit's kind of like a weird neutral like\nit doesn't feel bad it doesn't feel\njoyous but it sort of feels good it's\nkind of chill it's like peace how often\ndo you feel like that um\nnot often\nI wouldn't think absolutely I think this\nis a relatively new experience for most\npeople now the question is how did you\nget there not sure yeah but so let's\njust let's just understand what's\nhappening you're starting to feel a\nlittle bit peaceful you don't know\nexactly how it happened you're kind of\nokay with it it's not excitement but how\nwould you would you be okay feeling this\nway for eight hours a day yeah\nyeah fair enough yeah I think so\nprobably ha yeah\nwhat do you mean by it so when you when\nyou're hesitating is it because you want\nto feel that way more or feel that way\nless um I don't know I don't like\nsitting in one emotion let's say like\nokay I can it I guess yeah so I don't\nthink this is actually an emotional\nstate or for the record I think this is\nseparate that's what I was trying to\nexplain to you is that like pieces up\nhere but your emotions can actually be\nbouncing around you can you can actually\ncultivate the sense of peace while\nyou're feeling happy or while you're\nfeeling sad right and I know that that's\nwhen you say right you understand she or\nyou're just logically I mean with me no\nthat makes sense\nokay so please explain this to us what\ndo you mean by that how is that possible\nwhat do you feel I know it's new to you\nbut like Justin stumble through the\nwords baby um like you kind of feel\nthings yeah like down here but like\nthere you're sort of more aware and like\nthinking about how they affect you and\nlike I'm probably more logical playing I\nguess okay I want you to pay attention\nto what you said how they affect you\nright there is a difference between your\nnegative emotions and you which until\nthis moment I'm not sure you appreciate\nit because you used to be your negative\nemotions does that make sense yeah but\nnow you're noticing that your negative\nemotions are not actually who you are\nthey are over there and you were over\nhere I know it's kind of weird and\nabstract but like I really got to know\nif you're with me or if you're not with\nme because it's only a Tamati sense make\nsense right so how does it feel to be\nseparate from your negative emotions\nlike good yeah so if you heard of this\nthing called enlightenment yeah I mean I\nthink once you've heard of it yeah so\nwhat's your understanding of what the\n[ __ ] does that even mean yeah that's\nkind of\nI'll give you so now Matt you've taken\nthe first step forward because\nenlightenment is when all of your\nemotions become fully separated from who\nyou are and that separation is permanent\nso that the the small inkling of peace\nthat you have now becomes your default\nstate and encompasses your entire\nawareness that's what enlightenment is\nright so somehow somehow you've started\nto cultivate a sense of detachment and\nseparation from your negative a negative\nemotions and you don't know how you did\nit so what what do you think happened\nlook at the [ __ ] like what did you do\nI don't know I was just thinking about\nrandom stuff and I was like listening to\nmusic doing it okay so were you in the\npast the present of the future I'd say\nmore so the present okay I was like\nthinking about stuff that like yeah I\nwas like thinking about like this dream\nand just like answers to questions and\nrandom stuff oh no okay so your mind was\nactive but you were like kind of\nreflecting yeah and maybe like\ndaydreaming a little okay your mind was\noperating and you got some more work\ndone yeah I did like a lot of okay\ngroceries and stuff and how do you how\ndo you feel right now like peaceful yeah\nokay so I'll take it\nokay so what does this mean for you\ngoing forward Matt have we cured you no\nof course not of course not\nit's a step in the right direction there\nwe go I'll take it\nso now the question becomes what's the\nnext step I'm ready it's not rhetorical\nactually asking oh not sure probably a\ngirl but I want to do with my life or\nsomething oh that's not a step buddy\nthat's uh that's a man II know that's\nlike that's like that's like saying okay\nlike what's the next step and you're\nsaying like okay I'm gonna climb to the\ntop of Mount Everest figuring out what\nyou want to do in life is not a step\nthat's the goal that's like what you\nreflect back on when you're 80 years old\non your deathbed that's when you figure\nthat out what's the next step\nMatt how did you get to this peaceful\nplace doing stuff and thinking\nabsolutely doing stuff and thinking\nthat's the motto you're absolutely right\naction and reflection that's a fancy\nself-help meditation yoga hippie Whole\nFoods magazine action and reflection but\nreally what it is is doing stuff and\nthinking so what are you gonna do what\nwhat is some stuff that you can do see\nthere's an easy answer this question\nwhat needs to be done\nright actually give me an answer\nprobably clean more or beautiful or what\nI mean there's like plenty of things\nthat could be doing right so there's no\nlike one right answer absolutely\nso just pick something so cleaning and\nwhat else pick one more thing well I\nwanted to like kind of figure out what I\nwant to do is streaming because I open\nstreaming but maybe edit videos or\nsomething but I feel like that'd be it\nlater\nbecause I want to figure out what I'm\ngonna do with that first so okay so how\ndoes one figure out what one wants to do\nuh no clue okay\nI'd start by talking to someone about\nwhat so you want to figure out what you\nwant to do with streaming right yeah so\nI defined a sounding board so like try\nto find someone that you can talk to\nabout streaming right okay\nlike who can you talk to about streaming\nlike my friends or something yeah I mean\nis that actually something you could do\nyeah I mean I could do it yeah okay so\nclean talk to your friends about\nstreaming and then what was the other\nthing you said you said do things and\nand what and think oh thank you okay so\nwhat are you gonna reflect on uh not\nsure okay\nthat's perfectly fine so I'm gonna tell\nyou what I want you to do so you did\nsomething that was a little bit more\nthan thinking you did some noticing and\nso if you want to cultivate that\npeaceful sense within yourself it's not\nabout thinking it's about awareness or\nnoticing you paid attention to what you\nwere feeling and thinking you observed\nit and do you see how paying attention\ncould pay paying attention does that\nhappen in the past the present or the\nfuture president absolutely so I just\nwant you to pay attention pay attention\nto your thoughts pay attention to your\nphysical sensations pay attention to\nmusic whatever you were paying attention\nto just think about like what were you\nactually paying attention to where was\nyour attention focused over the last\nfifteen minutes okay and as long as you\ncan notice and you can act and you can\nclean then you're gonna start to feel\nthis way more and more and we can get\nto as much psychological [ __ ] about\nyour parents and depression and all that\nkind of stuff all that stuff has value\nthat's really what therapy is about\ntwitch is about changing which is about\nchanging your life therapy is about\nfeeling better so you have a therapist\nright yeah\nokay little counsellor I don't know it's\nit's all yeah it's the same thing right\nsame difference okay any questions for\nme uh not really no yeah good so I want\nyou to notice what was that was that a\nfat roll or slow roll I'm sorry\nslow roller pastoral that was a fast\nroll right but just think about that\nlike you were making a statement about\nyour ignorance but it was actually a\nfast roll you're like I strongest II or\nyes yes my friend that's exactly what it\nis how does it feel to be honest about\nyour ignorance good let's say yeah this\nwas pretty good see that's [ __ ] weird\nshouldn't you be ashamed about showing\nthe internet how ignorant you are no you\nshould be but you're not so this is the\nother thing that I want to explain to\nall of you guys out there your negative\nemotions have power over you as long as\nthey live in the darkness like what is\ntherapy how does therapy help people\nyou're talking about your negative [ __ ]\nthat you keep inside and we know that\nthat therapeutically helps people that's\nwhat it does that's what it's for\nincreasingly enough Matt when you were\nhonest about the stuff that you suck at\nin life you feel better right but when\nyou are not even honest and you judge\nyourself and you talk about\nhypotheticals and you talk about should\nthat's all inauthentic and that makes\nyou feel bad so be honest with yourself\nand it's okay to sock\nit's okay to be rejected it's okay to\nfail it's okay to do all that stuff just\nbe honest with yourself and then cut\nyourself a break right because like hey\nwhat can you really expect when it comes\nto good deer if you're like a [ __ ]\nencumbered deprived with a club yeah not\ngonna happen\nYeah right let's go cut yourself a break\nand like acknowledge that you're gonna\nneed to grind for a little bit maybe\nfind yourself a decent weapon and like\nsome armor and a helmet and like a set\nof gloves and then you can like you know\nyou can go back your life isn't over it\nrequires a little bit of grinding which\nin this case is cleaning and talking to\nyour friends about streaming and\npracticing like noticing and then you're\ngonna like level up your meditation stat\nand as your meditation stat goes up\nyou're gonna get no you're gonna get to\nlike you can get a mala which is like\nyou're a little um what's the thing this\nthe stick what are they called in Dark\nSouls what let's stick like like no no\nno not the torch the spell-casting items\ncatalyst catalyst that's for a talisman\nthough yeah yeah that's right that's\nright\nOh talisman catalyst right it's like so\ngive yourself a little bit of time and\nwork at it and level up a little bit and\nyou can do it\nmm-hmm I faith in you man thanks buddy\nhow does that how does it feel to hear\nthat um I don't know I whenever it\ndoesn't have an impact on me anymore I\nfeel like yeah I can tell you've never\nsaid thanks buddy over the course of\nthis conversation like I couldn't just\nsay Oh sort of compliment snakes I don't\nknow react\nthere you go see that's inauthentic\nthanks buddy is inauthentic I can smell\nit from a [ __ ] mile away it's like\nJesus okay so if you don't know how to\naccept a compliment that's a\nconversation for a different day right\nif you can't accept a compliment and you\ncan't accept that people have faith in\nyou it's because you don't see you don't\nsee worth in yourself you think I'm just\nwrong\nor you think I just don't get it anyway\nconversation for a different way that\nmakes sense yeah yeah so we got to talk\nabout being unable to accept compliments\ntoo I think that's important okay\nbut um thanks for coming on anyone have\nquestions for my Lord Ghoulia's oh no I\ngets like a chest yeah the slow rolling\ndeprived\nI think we're gonna do we're gonna do\nokay so people are saying thank you yeah\nso thank you bad I think I think you\ntalked about a lot of really important\nstuff we appreciate that yeah I\nappreciate well they appreciate you\nhelping me realize and having an impact\nand stuff yeah I love it\nsee that's authentic I appreciate you\nhelping me realize and having an impact\nand stuff that's where the magic happens\nseriously man thank you so much for\ncoming on I think you know I really do\nthink you're gonna be okay you just got\nto work at it right you got a level up a\nlittle bit you got to understand that\nlike you can't take out pontiff with\nyour slow rolling stick like you gotta\nbe you got to get yourself some loot and\nthat takes time and cut yourself a break\nbecause you know your stats like you\nforgot to spend your life is the\nequivalent of not spending any of your\nstats at level one it doesn't mean that\nyou're just permanently worse it's just\nyou've got to look like you know you got\nto just spend those points and you'll be\namazed at what you can accomplish right\nyeah okay and then you know if you're if\nyou're what you know we let us know how\nyou're doing we can come back on and if\nthere's stuff are you gonna watch this\nvaad I was thinking about saving it yeah\nyeah so what watch the vaad and then if\nyou want to come back on in like a\ncouple of weeks and
