    "transcript": "I see like invent investment bankers in\nmy office that make you know over a\nmillion dollars a year and they still\nfeel like failures like it's bizarre\nso let's start with with this question\nhow do you accept failure so SAN asks\nhow do you accept failure when you know\nyou've done all that you can I feel that\nI have a really hard time accepting\nfailure when I tried my hardest and\nstill fail sometimes that seems to be\nhappening more and more as I get older I\ncan't help but think of my consequences\nas failures so oddly enough I'm gonna\nread the the question kind of a second\ntime so how do I oh [ __ ] where'd I just\ndo um how do I accept failure when I've\ndone everything that I can so I'm gonna\nstart by actually disputing the premise\nof the question so I believe that\ngenerally speaking when you truly\nbelieve that you've done everything that\nyou can it becomes easier and easier to\naccept failure failure becomes hard to\naccept when you don't believe that\nyou've done everything that you can so I\nwonder whether you truly believe that\nyou've done everything that you can\nbecause at that point it sort of becomes\nlike it becomes common sense right like\nif I you know if I if I like buy a\nlottery lottery tickets I'm just trying\nto think of a good example so if I like\nif I if I really dig down and I give it\nmy all my experience of that and people\nthat I've worked with is that generally\nspeaking when you give it your all and\nyou fail there's actually a bizarre\namount of peace with that right you kind\nof like the way that you feel is like\nokay I gave it my best shot and I can\nactually be proud of what I did like I\ncould be proud of the way that I showed\nup that day and I gave it my best and it\nwasn't good enough I work with some\nprofessional athletes and like one of\nthem is a golfer and he was kind of\ntelling me that like you know so golf is\nkind of a weird competitive sport\nbecause you're not really like competing\nagainst other people like nothing anyone\nelse does on the golf course can impact\nthe game that you play it's not like you\nknow a competitive eSports or donor\noverwatch where you get outplayed like\nyou can't outplay anyone in golf because\nyou're just competing against yourself\nreally\nand so when it comes to success or\nfailure in golf it's just about the game\nthat you played when you showed up and\neven when we think about eSports like\nwhen I work with eSports athletes like\npeople talk about you know how good of a\njob they did and there's a lot of peace\nwith doing the best job that you can and\nnot getting something in my experience\nif you feel like you're it's difficult\nto accept failure chances are you\nactually need to dig deeper and really\nthink about did you do everything that\nyou could do because then it's like if\nyou really did everything that you could\ndo like you know it's out of your\ncontrol like sometimes you're just when\nyou try you're just gonna fail like\nthat's just a given so why is it that\nyou can't accept that failure as an\noption is that because you have an\nunrealistic expectation about yourself\nis it because you actually think you you\nknow deep down and this is what I'd put\nmy money on you know deep down that you\ncould have done more\nbut you did it and there's something\nthat's holding you back and I think\nthat's what you really need to explore\neven when things are out of your control\nit can be hard to accept failure yeah\nthat's true I mean I think sometimes it\ncan be hard to accept failure and I\nthink that how can I say this\nso it's there's a difference between\nlet me just think\nso we talked about this a little bit I\nthink on our last stream so I introduced\nthis concept of gamma Faridah so karma\nmeans action and Faridah means root and\nso a couple thousand years ago there's\nthis there was this conversation between\na guy named krishna and a guy named\narjun christian is sort of viewed as\nlike a hindu god in Arjun was a prince\nand what Krishna explains to Arjuna in\nthis conversation called the\nbhagavad-gita is that as a human being\nyou're not actually entitled to the\nfruits of your actions all you're\nentitled to is your actions\nand that's kind of a bizarre way of\nthinking about life like let me put it\nthis way like I'm not entitled to an A\nin a class like I'm not actually\nentitled to an a the only thing I'm\nentitled to is like study I can study as\nhard as I want to for a test and there's\nstill a chance that I'm gonna fail\nthere's nothing I can do to guarantee\ngetting an A but that's not the way that\nwe think right we think that our actions\nactually control outcomes but it but in\nthe purest sense of the word like they\ndo not like that's just not absolutely\ntrue so I can work really hard to become\na doctor and I can on the day of my\ngraduation I can be walking down the\nstreet and I can get hit by a meteor\nit's possible I can work really hard to\nbecome a doctor but I can't actually\ncontrol whether I become a doctor or not\nright like maybe there are all kinds of\nbizarre things that can get in the way\nof like me controlling my future and so\nI think a lot of people have trouble\naccepting failure because the route of\naccepting failure is in understanding\nwhat you are entitled to and what you\nare not entitled to so like people get\nhung up like so if I let's say that\nthere's there's someone that I'm\nattracted to and I get so caught up in\nthem and I like really really want them\nto like I you know I want them to I want\nto ask them out and I want them to say\nyes and I do everything that I can to\ncontrol them saying yes I start being\nreally nice to them I start working out\nI demonstrate myself as caring I pick\nthem up from the airport I you know like\nwhen they break up with their current\nboyfriend I'm the shoulder to cry on I\ndo everything right in somewhere along\nthe way I start to become entitled just\nto having a relationship with them the\nmore that I invest in that relationship\nI become entitled to a particular\noutcome the more that I study for a test\nI become entitled tip to the a\nand then when I don't get the a it\nbecomes really hard to accept that\nthat the origin of being unable to\naccept failure comes from a\nmiscalculation to what you are truly\nowed in life\nand so the big thing that you need to do\nif you're having trouble accepting\nfailure is really stop and think about\nlike what was I owed in this situation\ndid I do the best that I can and like is\nit really mine to control whether I\nsucceed or fail because most of people\nlike go through life expecting a\nparticular success and so you really\nneed to stop and think about like I\nfailed and did I really deserve to\nsucceed was I entitled to success\nand the more you step away from that the\neasier the easier it is to actually like\nstart to accept failure\nso\nthis is sort of a slightly related\nquestion do you feel like you can hide\nbehind self-improvement in regards to\nyour calling ie same 'less\nself-improvement without concrete\nmeaningful goal in mind so I want to\ntalk a little bit about\nso I'm gonna just talk actually let me\njust jump into this question so how do\nyou reconcile with failure when you know\nyou could have done more but you didn't\nthat's the problem right so a lot of\nwhat's difficult to accept about failure\nis you feel like you could have done\nmore and that in a sense is a true\nfailure because it's sort of like you\nknow you could have acted more but you\ndidn't and I think the biggest way to\novercome let's just like understand what\nthat means right so when you how do you\nreconcile with failure when you know you\ncould have done more but you couldn't\nyou didn't so let's just think a little\nbit about Amina 320 97 s question so\nwhat are you doing to yourself when you\nacknowledge that you could have done\nmore but you didn't you're blaming\nyourself right so let's understand first\nof all that you're beating yourself up\nand you're blaming yourself so now the\nquestion becomes how do you help someone\nwho's getting beaten up how do you help\nsomeone who's getting blamed right so\nlike the answer there is compassion so\nif someone is like having like a rough\ntime and they're getting like beat up\nand this is the confusing thing because\nwe offer compassion to other people when\nthey when they're the one they're the\nones getting beat up we don't offer\ncompassion to ourselves we're so good at\nbeating the [ __ ] out of ourselves we're\nso good at putting ourselves down\nbecause we don't practice self\ncompassion\nso how do you reconcile failure when you\nknow you could have done mourn you\ndidn't\nthe answer is forgiveness forgiveness\nyou need to accept that you're not\nperfect and that you deserve some slack\nbecause you can't be perfect all the\ntime but that's not how our mind thinks\nright we think like oh I could have done\nit therefore I'm gonna beat myself up\nfor not doing it but if you think about\nlike let's say you've got a body who\nsays oh man like you know I'm trying to\ndiet and I I like didn't I like you know\nfor a week I like ate pizza and like all\nthis other stuff that I'm not supposed\nto like how do you respond to that\nperson you're like hey man that's okay\nlike cut yourself a break you've done\nsuch a good job here and here just like\ncut yourself some slack man but you\ndon't say that to yourself and so I\nthink if you're having trouble\nreconciling with your failure because\nyou felt like you could have done more\nfirst of all it's it's good to\nacknowledge that and the second thing\nthat you need to do to prevent that\nbecause those negative emotions are\ngonna actually lead to more failure in\nthe future so what you really need to do\nis learn how to forgive yourself and cut\nyourself a break right say like hey I'm\nnot perfect like I'm not perfect so\nsometimes I'm not going to be able to\nachieve I'm not going to be able to\nfunction like optimally and that'll help\nyou get you overcome the failure\nyeah and so now I'm getting\nall this stuff about how compassion\ndoesn't naturally\num exist so I'm a little bit torn\nbecause I have other questions but this\nfeels like it's resonating with people\nso I'm gonna stick with this thread for\na little bit\nso now I'm going to ask you guys like\nwhy aren't we compassionate towards\nourselves right like let's just think\nabout this for a second\nso like where do I like so let's think\nabout Helens interview like so Helen is\nnot really compassionate with herself\nright she blames herself for all kinds\nof stuff under the Sun so how do we\nlearn why is it that we aren't\ncompassionate towards ourselves and this\nis kind of a really dangerous idea but\nlike I want people to really understand\nthis like what kind of person doesn't\ndeserve so what kind of person are you\nnot compassionate towards like think\nabout that for a second\nwho would you so generally speaking\nwe're compassionate towards most people\nbut we're not compassionate towards some\npeople right\nabsolutely right so people are saying\nDeGeneres like there's some people out\nthere who we don't feel deserve\ncompassion so [ __ ] people with low\nself-worth a defiles degenerates and so\nif you're not compassionate towards\nyourself what can we logically conclude\nabout how you view yourself\nwhat we can conclude is that they don't\ndeserve compassion\nso just think about that for a second so\nwhy aren't you compassionate towards\nyourself it's because you don't feel\nlike you deserve better when we look at\nHelen we see that right she feels like\nshe's a failure\nbecause she doesn't and she's not\ncompassionate towards herself because\nshe doesn't deserve it\nhaving trouble being compassionate\ntowards yourself you need to really\nthink about how you view yourself you\nprobably view yourself as a piece of\n[ __ ] there's a part of you that isn't\nworthy of compassion there's a part of\nyou that's degenerate\nand like that's that's scary it's true\nbut it's scary because now the question\nbecomes\nhow did you learn like where did you get\nthat opinion of yourself like this is\nreally important to understand that a\nlot of people like like this is a\nlearned behavior right like we learned\nthat we're failures it's not it's not\nlike we just wake up and like the\ndefault position is for human beings to\nbelieve they're failures like with hell\nand we saw it\nit was like she applied to 13 PA schools\nshe didn't say a bunch she didn't say a\nfew she said she applied to 13 like that\nnumber is seared in her mind and she\ndidn't even get into a single one\nso that's when she gets the idea like oh\nman I'm a piece of [ __ ]\nthat's when that gets seared into a\nbrain it's it's like a brand that gets\nbranded into your psychology and for\neveryone out there who feels like\nthey're a degenerate and who feels like\nthey're a failure like the first place\nyou got to start is where did you learn\nthat because that's something you\nlearned it's not the default State"
