    "transcript": "and this is what I'm telling you guys if\nI can go from there to being faculty at\nHarvard [ __ ] Medical School you can\ntoo\nlet me go to the next question let's\ntalk about Dharma for a second there\nwell then we'll do meditation\nhey dr. K I know that you advocate for\nfinding your calling karma in life but I\nfeel like I'm having a hard time pinning\nthat down my question is what kinds of\nspecific things can be done to find that\ncalling and is it or can it be related\nto finding financial success yes so\nlet's talk about finding your Dharma the\nfirst thing that I want you to do is\ntake a piece of paper I've given out\nthis exercise before and if you haven't\ndone it and you've heard it before we\ngot to understand why you can't do this\nand write a page about what you think is\nwrong with the world\njust write a page about what you think\nis wrong with it and they're like all\nkinds of thoughts are gonna pop nd in\nyour head like oh like the list will be\nnever-ending like oh I could write about\nthis or I could write about this or I\ncouldn't write but that's why you need\nto sit down and actually write a page\nabout the world of what's wrong with the\nworld because when you sit down and you\nactually write a page then you'll see\nwhat comes out\nand then this is really important so we\nhave two modes of thinking we have our\ncreative mind and we have our analytical\nmind\nand so one of the biggest struggles if\nyou're a writer is that like when you\nsit down and write you sort of edit what\nyou're writing all the time and that can\nmake it hard to write like the sentence\ndoesn't feel right so one of the biggest\nthings that writers need to learn how to\ndo is shut off their editor so you have\nlike an author and you have like an\nartist and you have an editor in your\nhead and in learning learning how to\nwrite what you've got to do is like\nseparate the artist from the editor and\nwhat gamers do is they confuse they're\nalways in editor mode because they're\nthey're analytical mind is really strong\nand so they never get to exercise their\ncreative mind which is why you all end\nup on Twitch because you all are really\ngood at analyzing and commenting and\nreally bad at doing and why is that it's\nbecause you're your author your creative\nmind your artistic mind has become dead\nbecause video games don't train that\nmind at all they just train they just\ntrain your analytical mind because video\ngames so need you to create anything\nvideo games are all about analysis and\nlike following the script that you're\ngiven it's all about responding to\nexternal things it's nothing internal\nso what you guys need to do is like\nrecognize that\nyou have this creative part and you have\nan analytical part and right now it's\nalmost like you know it's like I'm gonna\ncreate some weird images but like\nimagine you just worked out like one arm\nlike you just did like curls with one\narm and you got that arm swole and then\nthe other arm you never worked out\nthat's what your brain is like if you're\na gamer your analytical mind is way\noverblown and you're like you're your\ncreative mind like you're your creative\nmind is like weak so it's like it's like\nyou know people who skip leg day but\nlike you know it's just like one part of\nyour mind is just really weak so when\nyou sit down to write you're starting to\nlike increase the strength of your\ncreative mind to actually like have a\nthought and put something out in the\nworld so if I had to diagnose your\nproblem is a gamer the problem is that\nyou have lots of thoughts and they never\nproduce anything you can think but you\ncan't produce so what we need to do is\njust literally practice the skill of\nproducing\npractice the skill producing it doesn't\nmatter what it is just start working out\nthat arm so write one page generate\nabsolutely just generate something the\nonly thing you guys are good at\ngenerating is semen and [ __ ] that's all\nyou guys can produce produce something\ndoesn't matter create something write a\npage\nthat's that's you should do just write\nsomething and in in the in the realm so\nthis is fascinating because even like in\nyogic texts the there's this idea that\nthere are two things in life that\nrequire manifestation you need energy\nand intention so this is like Shiva is\nthe principle of like consciousness or\nintention and Shakti is Shiva's consort\nthere's like a male God and his wife as\nthe female God and Shakti means energy\nand so if you want to accomplish\nanything in this world you need to\ncombine intention with energy in the way\nthat I view that is the analytical mind\nand the creative mind and you guys all\nhave a really good analytical mind you\nhave a very good Shiva but your Shakti\nis very weak your energy is very weak\nthe interesting thing is that in this in\nthe Hindu tradition Shiva is male and\nshucks these female so I see this\nproblem more with men than women\nand so start by just writing a page\nabout what's wrong with the world and if\nyou haven't done it yet so like show of\nhands like who's actually done this\nright and so if you just think about\nthat for a second if you've heard this\nexercise or even by the end of tomorrow\nif you haven't actually written like ask\nyourself why what gets in the way of you\nactually just riding one page\nand like riding what's wrong with the\nworld\nand so then we get to the second part\nwhich is like after you write one page\nthen turn on your analytical mind and\nsift through it and be your own\ntherapist and ask yourself okay out of\nthis so the second part of the question\nwas about financial financial stuff like\ncan you be financially successful\nthrough Therma absolutely because I\nbelieve that generally speaking like\nwhat matters to you is probably going to\nmatter to someone else out there\nand generally speaking money is\ncorrelated with value like sure there\nare lots of problems with like this\ngeneral premise but generally speaking I\nthink people are willing to pay for\nstuff that's like worth something and so\nif you see a problem and you go about\ntrying to correct it chances are you'll\ngenerate value so if we think about\nsomething like axiom verge if you guys\nhaven't checked out the game you check\nit I'm not getting paid or anything but\nlike axiom verge is a great game because\nthe guy was like I want to play like a\nMetroid game like I want to play like a\nMetroid game and so he like made a bunch\nof guns and he made a budget cool level\ndesigns and then it was just like making\nthe game that you want to play\nif we think about successful authors\nlike successful authors write the book\nthat they want to read because they say\nlike okay there's no book on the market\nthat scratches my itch for this kind of\nthing like this I think it would be\nreally cool if there was like you know a\nbook about this\num and yeah so Raman Berg just had an\ninteresting thought imagine if all of us\nhere on chat does this writing\nassignment and go beyond it write a book\ncalled what's wrong with the world so\n113 of these books all called the same\nbut written by different authors that's\na that's a brilliant idea so I think\nwhat you guys should do is write a page\nand then let's coalesce it and publish\nit as an e-book and let's see what\nhappens\nwhat you guys do it each of you write a\npage there are 113 viewers and then\nwe're gonna make a book right we're\ngonna actually do it like you [ __ ] no\nexcuses but y'all are gonna come up with\nit it's gonna fail it's gonna fail it's\ngonna [ __ ] fail 113 pages twitch\nwrites a book right it's like twitch\nplays pokemon but twitch writes a book\nlet's do it that's\nlike a brilliant idea\nand I'll write a page too I'll put my\nmoney where my mouth is dr. Joe Bri asks\nsingle-spaced to double who the [ __ ]\ncares if it's single space or double\nspace see that's the kind of [ __ ]\nthat I'm talking about you guys will\ncome up with any kind of yes single\nspace or double space like who cares\ndoes it matter what the font is or\nwhether it's single space or double\nspace your mind will come up with\nanything it can to not create any reason\nyou want anything it'll come up with all\nkinds of reasons to not actually create\nsomething\nanything you can to not get someone\npregnant and just jerk off\nthat's all you guys want\nand so like [ __ ] all of that\nso we got to figure out how to do this\nbut I want you guys to write and like\nwe're gonna see what we can put together\nand we're gonna like submit it somewhere\nand then\nlike we're gonna submit it to somewhere\nand we'll like post it on our website\nand then you guys can read what like\nother people have written so we've done\nthis on the past on our discord well we\ndo this exercise with like groups of\ngamers\nand and like people will like post their\nwhat their submissions and then it's\nit's been really helpful for everyone\nelse so if you guys want to write a book\ntogether let's do it\nright\nyeah so write a page about what's wrong\nwith the world\nand then and can be related to financial\nsuccess absolutely right so this is how\ntwitch is gonna make money like we're\ngonna make some money like let's see if\nwe can sell it like let's see if the\nbook is decent there's a piece [ __ ] fine\nno problem if it fails no big deal\nat least we learned something right at\nleast we did something because even if\nyou write a really crappy book like it'd\nbe cool right you don't even need\nfailure yeah you don't need success the\nbook can suck but you're gonna feel\namazing about yourself and that's the\nkey because remember everywhere that we\nstarted from is you don't feel like\nEurope\nyou deserve to succeed you feel like\nyour piece of [ __ ] and that's what's\nholding you back so how do we fix that\nproblem we write the shittiest book in\nthe history of humanity\nin somehow that's gonna make you feel\ngood just think about that this whole\nstream has been about overcoming failure\nhow about try something that you know is\ngonna be a piece of [ __ ] and feeling\ngood at the end of it\nlike if you can do that you could turn\nyour [ __ ] life around done it doesn't\neven have to succeed it doesn't have to\nbe successful it doesn't have to make\nyou rich\nyou're gonna produce the biggest turd\nof\nauthorship in the universe and you're\ngonna feel good about it and then you're\ngonna wake up the next day and you know\nwhat's crazy you know it's really crazy\nyou're gonna go to class\nyou're gonna go to class\nthat's going to happen\nyeah so we got to figure out so I don't\nknow if Kangas still around kanga how\ncould how can these guys submit\nsomething\nwe got to figure that out\nokay\nso let's talk about in tarma for a\nsecond\nso here's here's a great question yeah\nGoogle Doc would be fine\nso dank dank Moses is going to help us\nfigure out how to do this\num okay so hello over the past couple of\nmonths I've been struggling with what my\nDharma is my dream in life was to become\na professional eSports player yet I have\ncome to the realization that I'm not\ngood enough to be one this is pushed me\nto becoming more involved with school\nhowever I'm not passionate about it\nwhatsoever just wondering if there are\nany tips I could get to move on with my\nlife\num so this question comes from engine so\nI'm not quite sure what you mean by\nbeing involved with school but so like\nlet's just talk about shattered dreams\nfor a second so I think this question is\nabout shattered dreams right over the\npast couple of months I've been\nstruggling with what my Dharma is my\ndream in life was to become a\nprofessional eSports player yet I have\ncome to the realization that I'm not\ngood enough to be one perfect right so\nwe can start there this is what we've\nbeen talking about in the roguelike you\nare thinking like oh I want to be a mage\nand I want to find a fireball spell\nbecause I want to be a fire mage but you\nroll up your roguelike and there are no\nfire spells to be found so then you're\nlike well [ __ ] what what can I do so\nlike I wanted to be an eSports pro -\nlike it blows my mind I work with a\ncouple of people who had the opportunity\nto become eSports pros\nand they turned it down to [ __ ] go to\nmedical school and you know who you are\nand then when they tell me that like a\ncouple of people now and and when they\ntell me that I'm like you're crazy like\nwhy not pick eSports because that's what\nI wanted but I just wasn't good enough\nlike I played so much war three and I\nwas in top 100 on the ladder in North\nAmerica which is like nothing right like\ntop 100 is sort of an achievement but if\nwe really think about it like that's\njust not I was like numbered like 87 or\nsomething on the NA ladder so I was like\ngood at war 3 but like you 87 is it\ngonna get you anywhere in the eSports\nworld\nso\nyou know I think that's fine so like\nthat's not your karma in this life right\nso just accept that for a moment and be\nlike okay I wanted this thing and now\nthis is really important because like we\nlearned with Helen sometimes we don't\nlet ourselves want what we cannot have\nand then this the subtle thing is that\nthat want lives in our subconscious and\nand weighs us down so instead what you\nreally need to do is actually grieve you\nneed to grieve for the loss so what you\nneed to do is like be honest with\nyourself and say hey I really wanted\nthis but I've lost it like this is gone\nand this is not gonna be a part of my\nlife because grief is the appropriate\nplace is the appropriate way to move on\nfor something that you no longer have\nright so engine EADS to grieve his\npotential eSports career it's like I\nmean at this I don't mean to be\ninsensitive about this but it's almost\nlike a miscarriage like the appropriate\nway to deal with a miscarriage is grief\nbecause there was this potential right\nthere was this whole other life or track\nor Avenue of like joy and hope and love\nand like there was this whole career\nthere's this whole like trajectory in\nlife and it's gone\nit's never gonna be\nand so you need to grieve\nright and like how do you grieve for a\nmiscarriage like you just first of all\nacknowledge that you're entitled to feel\nbad for not having it that it's sad that\nit happened and also like that it\ndoesn't mean that your life is over and\nwhen I help people work through\nmiscarriages which happens a lot like so\nlike you know I think half of women have\na miscarriage like the numbers absurdly\nhigh\nit's like how do you deal with something\nlike you just say like yeah it's shitty\nlike that sucks like let's be honest\nabout that and you're sad and you're\nallowed to be sad and\nlet's not like delude ourselves about\nhow bad it is and also let's not delude\nourselves about like the limits of its\nbadness because just because you had one\nmiscarriage doesn't mean that you're\never able to have children and I've\nworked with people like that too we've\nhad miscarriage after miscarriage after\nmiscarriage and that too like you've got\nagree right you've got to grieve for the\nlife of never being able to have your\nown child but that doesn't mean that\nlife is over either because some of\nthose people end up adopting some of\nthose people we talked about surprises\nright and most of twitch chat is a\nsurprise some of those people end up\nhaving surprises later in life because\nthey stop using birth control and then\nlike the human body and reproductive\norgans are weird and when you stop when\nyou stop getting stressed out then\nyou're able to have babies and like\nsometimes like with at the age of 38 you\nget pregnant they're like well [ __ ] okay\nwhere did this come from and it's all\npart of life it's all part of your\nroguelike\nit's all part of your rug life you just\ndon't know you wanted that fireball\nspell and you've gotten through six\nlevels of the dungeon and there's no\nfireball spell and you've decided that\nyou're just gonna pump up your like\nbarbarian stats and so you're double\nwielding two-handed axes you've got a\nbunch of strength and con and on level\nseven you find your fireball spell and\nyou're like that's amazing\nright like that's that's what you've got\nto do you've gotta agree that you're not\ngonna be an eSports professional but\nthat's okay because eSports is such an\nevolving industry where most of the\npeople now in eSports don't play the\ngame\nthink about that for a second you have\nteams right and teams have players but\nthey also have coaches they have\nmanagers they have advertising people\nthey have PR people they have like\nfinancial people\nthey have CEOs CFOs they have all kinds\nthey have chefs they have psychologists\nso you can still get involved in eSports\nlike that's just your Dharma so if you\nwant to get involved in eSports get\ninvolved in eSports and now we come to\nour second don't write a page about this\nbut for that person what's missing in\neSports\nthat's the page you need to write what's\nmissing in eSports and then when you so\nlet your creative mind do that\nthen what you need to do is like think\nabout what your skill sets are and what\nyour cents are and what can you do about\nit\nright that's the second page"
