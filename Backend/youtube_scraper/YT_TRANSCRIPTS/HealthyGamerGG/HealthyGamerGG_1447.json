    "transcript": "if you can get in the zone on a regular\nbasis your performance is going to start\nyes I want you guys to think about\nsomething more safe so when I'm pitching\nto like Goldman Sachs what I do is I\nwalk in the room and I ask the people\nwhat is the difference between a good\nday and a like think about that\nas human beings we have good days and we\nhave bad days what's the difference like\nyour biology is the same every day that\nyou play a game like if you're playing\nit doesn't matter what game you're\nplaying every day your experience is\ngrowing so here you should be getting\nback right you know more about the game\ntoday than you did yesterday\nso if unless something drastic is\nhappening in general you should be\nimproving every single day to play so\nwhy do human beings have good days and\nwhy do they have bad things and the\nanswer is exactly what Mark said it's\nabout the state that you operated so\nlike when Michael Jordan is in the zone\nand we've all experienced it if you can\nget in the zone on a regular basis your\nperformance is going to start so this is\nwhere like what I do is I teach people I\nmade it my life's work to teach people\nthat getting in the zone is not random\nbecause you guys know like on some days\nyou have a bad day you're like it's just\nnot happening today I'm just not you\nguys never won before you know with like\nlosing streak and then you guys gone on\na winning streak something magical\nhappened and your players suddenly get\nbetter on Game five no the way that they\nshowed up to play changed not the person\nthat they are and so meditation is about\nlike structuring that flow snake is\nabout understanding that the difference\nbetween good days and bad days it can be\nreduced if you try if you change your\ndiet if you change your sleeping you\nlearn how to meditate\nit's I'm done that's probably gonna be\nhard to do this but I'm gonna ask you\nbest to do is sit up straight and then\njust raise one finger and we're gonna do\na practice called the ultimate not so\ngreat okay so I'm gonna demonstrate once\nyou guys can kind of do with me I'm\ngonna block my right nostril and I'm\nnever leaving through my left I'm going\nto switch to the other and also block it\nand then breathe out and then in through\nthe same nostril switch out\nthen again in\nswitch now\ninto the same nostril\nswitch now\nyou\nother teams pro teams that have salaries\nof millions of dollars a year when they\nlose a game they tear each other apart\nyou weren't doing this you want to doing\nthis weren't doing this the attitude in\nthe winning team was completely\ndifferent they support each other\nthey're like hey man it's okay don't\nworry about it don't rage don't tilt\ntilt prevention what I teach is tell\nprevention and if you can train yourself\nto not tilt imagine how good they also\nuse this one psychologist"
