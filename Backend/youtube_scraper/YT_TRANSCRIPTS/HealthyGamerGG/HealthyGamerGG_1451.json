    "transcript": "let's talk a little bit about toxicity\nso one of the things that Gamers\nstruggle with is that their brains are\nso used to like the more you play games\nand Men especially\num are are really good at this we're\nreally good at suppressing our emotions\nand games actually shut off our\nemotional circuitry and so what happens\nis games Gamers become something called\nAlexa thymic so Alexa thymia is the\ninability to recognize your internal\nemotional state\nand so what happens is a lot of Gamers\nactually are their emotions rolling\naround inside of them but they're not\naware of them because they're parts of\ntheir brain that are kind of suppressing\nthem all the time so let's say that like\nyou know I get into a fight with my\nparents and then I turn on a video game\nand then like all those emotions just\nget shut off\nand so a lot of times what happens with\num\nGamers is that they feel like everything\nis fine they feel like oh yeah they're\nhappy and they're healthy and they enjoy\ngaming but what actually happens is they\nhave a lot of subsurface emotions that\nthey're not even aware of and that's\nwhat Alexa thyme is and then what\nhappens is those those emotions kind of\nBobble to the surface and start to\nimpact their life so what what ends up\nhappening is when they're lexicon\nbecause Gamers get this illusion that\nthey're not actually experiencing\nnegative emotions and a lot of Gamers\nthat I talk to I'll ask them like you\nknow you know what's your relationship\nwith your emotions I mean I won't ask\nthat because that's a weird question\nlike I don't know how even I would\nanswer that but the more I ask them\nabout essentially the relationship to\ntheir emotions what they come back with\nis that oh I'm in control of my emotions\nand so when we talk about that like the\nfunny thing about Gamers is that they\nthey feel like they're in control of\ntheir emotions and by control of their\nemotions what that means is that they\ncan watch like let's say a sad movie and\nlike everyone else around them is crying\nbut they're not crying\num and so they're also like able to be\nin uncomfortable situations and like be\nkind of essentially like a blank slate\nand so if we really think about it what\nthat means is that a lot of Gamers it's\nnot that they're in control of their\nemotions like Vulcans\num what that really means is that\nthey're just they they just know how to\nsuppress their emotions\nand as those emotions get suppressed\nit's kind of like this this emotional\nlike pile is like building and building\nand building inside you and I'll give\nyou guys kind of an example for my\npersonal life like I remember feeling\nlike a failure right so I would wake up\nevery day I would skip class\nI would like game until I was exhausted\nand I'd like pass out at four in the\nmorning and every day that went by I'd\nfeel more and more like a failure and\nthe only way that I could get I could\ntolerate those feelings was by escaping\nthrough gaming\nand then I kind of\nI kind of like I kind of got stuck\nbecause\num what would happen is like every day\nthat goes by I'm not moving forward in\nlife and I'm actually failing in life\nmore and more and more and more and the\nonly way that I could so like day one\nlet's say I feel like a failure of five\nout of ten in day two it's six out of\nten because now I've up for two\ndays day three is seven out of ten and\nso I'm digging myself deeper and deeper\nand deeper and the more and more failure\nI feel inside me the more I have to turn\nto video games to like make that feeling\nof failure go away\nand so the more I turn to video games\nthe less for I mean the more stuck I get\nand so it's this vicious cycle and so\nGamers kind of get into this and so the\nonly way that they learn how to manage\ntheir emotions because gaming leads to\nescapism\nis through playing video games and so\nthey have this gigantic pile of emotion\nthat's building up and I remember for me\nsometimes like there's some moments and\nif you guys really pay attention to your\nlives maybe you can find out like when\nare these moments but for me there were\nsome moments that the emotions would\njust come flooding back and be like\ncompletely overwhelming and for me that\nwas when I was going to bed at night\nright so I like finish gaming and if I\ngot into bed and like my mind would\nstart to wander it would start to think\nabout how I was screwing up my life and\nI would feel such an overwhelming sense\nof hopelessness shame and guilt that it\nwas like intolerable so what I had to do\nwas game so much until I got so mentally\nexhausted that when I hit the sack I\nwould just pass out"
