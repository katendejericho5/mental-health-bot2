    "transcript": "so you guys want to learn a little bit\nof meditation\nyeah let's do some meditation I'm gonna\ndo it let's do it okay\nso we'll do the accent or meditation\nbecause it makes it more authentic\nokay so\nlet's do so we will do the nadi shodhana\npranayama\nokay so I want you to do this thumb this\nis okay put curl down the two fingers\nlike this\nand we will do the nadi shodhana\npranayama which in english is alternate\nnostril breathing\nyou must focus that's why you can focus\nI'm going to use it so you must learn to\nfocus so we are going to do this okay so\nI want to take the thumb block the right\nnostril and breathe in\nswitch and breathe out\nbreathing through the same one\nswitch and breathe out\nwe then\nyou\nswitch breathe out\nin\nswitch out\nyou\nyou shouldn't be smelling anything okay\nso let me just\nokay so what you want to do is block one\nalso breathe in through one switch\nbreathe out through the other and then\nbreathe in through the same nostril\nswitch and breathe out okay so I'm gonna\nI'm gonna start demonstrating one yeah\nlike so you guys need to stop\ntyping and wall Xing on Twitch at and\nactually do it because I mean watching\npeople meditate isn't gonna do for\nyou like you have to actually have to\nmeditate right like that's why we're\nhere so\nyeah so one of your nostrils is going to\nbe blocked\nright and it's okay if you do this you\ncan do pinky if you need to so one of\nyour nostrils is going to be more\nblocked than the other\nthat's completely normal if you have a\ndeviated septum you shouldn't do this\ncase in point yeah if you have a\ndeviated septum don't do this practice\nso\nI'm gonna I'm gonna demonstrate I'm\ngonna close my eyes so I want you guys\nto make sure you get the rhythm so it's\nin switch out in switch out in switch\nout in switch out it's not in switch out\nswitch in switch out you see that that's\nthe same one every time\nso your spine needs to be straight\nthat's the only important requirement\nyou can stand or said it doesn't matter\nso now we're gonna practice so block the\nright nostril\nthat's okay you get it so G you can just\nuse the pinky\nyou\ngo ahead and finish the round that\nyou're on\nlet your eyes remain closed\nand just sit with the natural slowing of\nyour thoughts\nyou\nEAL the slowness of your breath\nyou\nnow put your palms together in front of\nyou\nto rub them together rub rub rub rub rub\nrub feel the warmth the friction and\nthen cut them over your eyes\nnow I want you to take a deep breath in\nand as you exhale\nslowly open your eyes\nlet your hands come down\nyou\nyou\nokay\nso we'll pick back up I think on Friday\nso I'm going to be Co swimming with\nDevin Nash on Friday from three to five\nEastern\nand okay could you explain what we just\ndid\nyeah okay so I guess I guess we're not\ndone streaming okay so let me explain a\nlittle bit about meditation so the first\nthing is yeah you should let your mind\ngo wherever it wants to but the whole\ngoal of switching the fingers is\nis that it returns your attention to the\npresent so as your mind starts to wander\nlike this is what happens with your mind\nyour mind has a thought and then you\nfeed into that thought and it begets\nanother thought and then the thoughts in\nyour mind start breeding right and then\nsoon you have like an infestation of\nthoughts and that's what anxiety is like\nif you think about people who suffer\nfrom anxiety they worry about one thing\nthey're like oh my god like I was\nwalking and like one of my shoes is\nmuddy and then like what are people\ngonna think are they going to think that\nI don't know how to dress myself are\nthey gonna think I'm dirty like one\nthought leads to another thought leads\nto another thought leads to another\nthought and so the thoughts will start\nto breed\nnow thoughts are gonna have a certain\nenergy or momentum they're kind of like\nyou know if I if I like roll a tire down\nthe street like the tire is gonna fall\nover at some point but it has some\nmomentum and if I keep feeding the\nthoughts the tire is gonna keep going\nand my mind is gonna keep going that's\nwhat happens in anxiety and then the\nthoughts become overwhelming when we\nmeditate the momentum of your thoughts\nis still gonna be there but the\nadvantage of doing a practice like this\nis that you have to return to the\npresent and like you have to pay\nattention and every time you pay\nattention to switching your breath and\nfocusing on your breath you stop paying\nattention to your thoughts and you start\nto stop feeding them so even though a\nthought may pop up if you return to the\npractice that thought will just drift\naway and you'll be back to square one\nand the longer you do the practice the\nfewer thoughts are gonna pop up and so\nthe goal of this practice is to enter a\nno mind state which is consciousness\nwithout mental activity so we it's like\na hard state of mind to really think\nabout but it's it's like a very\nimportant\nlike it's just a really simple principle\nwhich is that you know you you want to\nfocus your attention on the present and\nlet the thoughts go and the more you let\nthe thoughts go the more you're gonna\nenter closer to a state of mind where\nyour consciousness without thinking so\nall you are is pure awareness and that's\nthe growth goal\nnow people ask me like what does this do\nthat's the most fundamental thing there\nare a lot of there are a lot of specific\nattributes to the meditation that I\nteach and I can't really go into that\nbut maybe what we can do is have a have\na stream exclusively about like the\nscience and theory behind meditation so\nwe can cover like from a neuroscience\nand physiologic perspective like what\ndoes it do to your brain what does it do\nto your hormones what does it do to your\ncortisol level what does it do to your\nadrenaline what does it do to your\nsympathetic nervous system and the other\nside of that is like what are the Yogi's\nin India like say like why do they say\nthis is good because they started doing\nthis stuff before we had MRI scanners\nand before we had heart rate monitors so\nwhat is their theory behind why this\nstuff works so let me just focus on\nmeditation for a second so you want to\ndo this for 3 to 5 minutes at a time and\nthen you ideally want to do it every day\nbut let's start with 3 to 5 minutes a\nday for 3 days a week and how do you\nkeep track of time so there - what you\ncan set a timer if you want to but the\nother thing that you can do is just do\nit until you're done doing it which I\nknow sounds weird but you just start the\npractice you can count like a certain\nnumber of breaths like you can do nine\nbreaths or 18 breaths or just like do it\nuntil you're done and I know that sounds\nweird but you'll be surprised you'll\nknow when you're done for the day and\nthat's ok don't be judgmental for\nyourself just just focus on on doing it"
